    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will analyze the connectivity of the source and target spaces. The connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that $f$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for all $i < k$ and an epimorphism for $i=k$.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the source and target spaces.** Let $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ be the source space and $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ be the target space.\n2.  **Calculate the connectivity of the source space, X.** We will use the following standard results from homotopy theory:\n    *   The loop space $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected for $n \\ge 2$.\n    *   For well-behaved CW complexes A and B, the smash product $A \\wedge B$ has connectivity equal to conn(A) + conn(B) + 2.\n    *   The suspension $\\Sigma A$ has connectivity equal to conn(A) + 1.\n3.  **Calculate the connectivity of the target space, Y.**\n    *   The smash product of spheres is a sphere: $S^m \\wedge S^n = S^{m+n}$.\n    *   The connectivity of $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$.\n4.  **Determine the connectivity of the map.** By comparing the connectivity of X and Y, we can determine the range in which their homotopy groups are trivial. Using the definition of map connectivity, we can find the highest value $k$ for which the conditions are met.\n\nThis step-by-step calculation will be performed by the following Python script.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map\n    f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Sphere dimensions\n    m = 4\n    n = 6\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the source space X = Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n)\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculating the connectivity of the source space X = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6).\")\n\n    # Connectivity of loop spaces\n    conn_omega_sm = m - 2\n    conn_omega_sn = n - 2\n    print(f\"The space Omega S^{m} is ({m}-2)-connected = {conn_omega_sm}-connected.\")\n    print(f\"The space Omega S^{n} is ({n}-2)-connected = {conn_omega_sn}-connected.\")\n\n    # Connectivity of the smash product\n    conn_smash_product = conn_omega_sm + conn_omega_sn + 2\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the smash product (Omega S^{m} wedge Omega S^{n}) is conn(Omega S^{m}) + conn(Omega S^{n}) + 2 = {conn_omega_sm} + {conn_omega_sn} + 2 = {conn_smash_product}.\")\n\n    # Connectivity of the suspension (the source space)\n    conn_source = conn_smash_product + 1\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the source space X = Sigma(Omega S^{m} wedge Omega S^{n}) is conn(smash product) + 1 = {conn_smash_product} + 1 = {conn_source}.\")\n    print(f\"This means pi_i(X) = 0 for i <= {conn_source}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the target space Y = Omega(S^m wedge S^n)\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculating the connectivity of the target space Y = Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\")\n\n    # The smash product of spheres is a sphere\n    target_sphere_dim = m + n\n    print(f\"The smash product S^{m} wedge S^{n} is the sphere S^{m+n} = S^{target_sphere_dim}.\")\n\n    # Connectivity of the target space\n    conn_target = target_sphere_dim - 2\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the target space Y = Omega(S^{target_sphere_dim}) is {target_sphere_dim}-2 = {conn_target}.\")\n    print(f\"This means pi_i(Y) = 0 for i <= {conn_target}, and pi_{conn_target + 1}(Y) = Z.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the connectivity of the map f: X -> Y\n    print(\"Step 3: Determining the connectivity of the map f: X -> Y.\")\n    print(\"A map f is k-connected if f* is an isomorphism on pi_i for i < k and an epimorphism on pi_k.\")\n\n    # The map f induces f*: pi_i(X) -> pi_i(Y).\n    # For i <= conn_target, both groups are 0.\n    # The map 0 -> 0 is an isomorphism.\n    k = conn_target\n    print(f\"For i < {k+1} (i.e., i <= {k}), let's check the induced map on homotopy groups.\")\n    print(f\"For i <= {k}, pi_i(X) = 0 (since X is {conn_source}-connected) and pi_i(Y) = 0 (since Y is {conn_target}-connected).\")\n    print(f\"The map f*: pi_i(X) -> pi_i(Y) is 0 -> 0, which is an isomorphism.
