    # The problem asks for the largest possible dimension of the coinvariant algebra R/I.
    # Let G be a group of order 10000. It acts on the polynomial ring R = C[x_1, ..., x_10]
    # via a homomorphism rho: G -> GL(10, C).
    # The group effectively acting on R is H = rho(G).

    # A key theorem by Chevalley states that for a finite group H acting on a polynomial ring R
    # (over a field of characteristic 0, like C), the dimension of the coinvariant algebra is
    # equal to the order of the acting group.
    # dim(R/I) = |H|

    # By the first isomorphism theorem, H is a homomorphic image of G.
    # This means the order of H must divide the order of G.
    # |H| <= |G|

    # The order of the group G is given.
    order_of_G = 10000

    # Therefore, the dimension of R/I is bounded by the order of G.
    # dim(R/I) <= 10000

    # To find the largest possible dimension, we need to show that this maximum value
    # is achievable. This requires finding a group G of order 10000 and a representation rho
    # such that the action is faithful, meaning rho is injective.
    # If rho is injective, then H is isomorphic to G, and |H| = |G| = 10000.

    # We need to confirm that a group of order 10000 can be a subgroup of GL(10, C).
    # Consider the cyclic group C_10000. Let zeta be a primitive 10000-th root of unity.
    # The group generated by the 10x10 diagonal matrix diag(zeta, 1, ..., 1) is
    # a subgroup of GL(10, C) and has order 10000.

    # Since such a group exists, a dimension of 10000 is achievable.
