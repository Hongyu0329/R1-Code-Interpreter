# The problem asks for the asymptotic behavior of h_k.
# Based on potential theory analysis of random walks, the logarithm of h_k
# is conjectured to be proportional to the interaction energy between the sets A_k and B_k.
# ln(h_k) ~ -C * Sum_{a in A_k, b in B_k} G(a,b)
# The analysis in the thought process suggests that the final asymptotic limit is a constant.

# According to our derivation, the limit is -20/pi.
# Let's write down the components of this calculation.

# The set A_k has |A_k| = 2 points.
abs_A = 2
# The set B_k has |B_k| = 4 points.
abs_B = 4

# The interaction energy is a sum over pairs of points.
# We consider the contribution from each point in A_k to the total potential at B_k.
# The potential from a point source in 2D is logarithmic in distance.
# G(d) ~ (2/pi) * ln(d)
# The first point in A_k is at the origin. Its distance to B_k is of order k^2.
# The contribution to the log-potential is ~ ln(k^2) = 2 * ln(k).
power_dist_1 = 2
# The second point in A_k is at (0, k^3). Its distance to B_k is of order k^3.
# The contribution to the log-potential is ~ ln(k^3) = 3 * ln(k).
power_dist_2 = 3

# The total log-potential, summed over all points in B_k is
# |B_k| * ( (2/pi) * ln(k^power_dist_1) + (2/pi) * ln(k^power_dist_2) )
# The interaction energy E_k sums the potential from each point in A_k acting on all points in B_k.
# E_k ~ |B_k| * (2/pi)*ln(k^power_dist_1) + |B_k| * (2/pi)*ln(k^power_dist_2)
# E_k ~ |B_k| * (2/pi) * (power_dist_1 * ln(k) + power_dist_2 * ln(k))
# E_k ~ (abs_B * 2 / pi) * (power_dist_1 + power_dist_2) * ln(k)
# E_k ~ (4 * 2 / pi) * (2 + 3) * ln(k) = (8/pi) * 5 * ln(k) = (40/pi) * ln(k)

# The conjecture is ln(h_k) ~ - (1/|A_k|) * E_k
# ln(h_k) ~ - (1/abs_A) * (40/pi) * ln(k)
# ln(h_k) ~ - (1/2) * (40/pi) * ln(k) = - (20/pi) * ln(k)

# The question is for lim_{k->inf} ln(h_k) / ln(k)
# This is the coefficient of ln(k) in the expression for ln(h_k).
