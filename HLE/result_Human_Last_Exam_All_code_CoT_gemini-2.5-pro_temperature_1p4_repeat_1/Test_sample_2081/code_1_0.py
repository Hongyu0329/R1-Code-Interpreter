    # e^(2T) is (e^T)^2.
    alpha = (e_T**2 - 1) / 2

    # Based on the analysis of the solvability condition for the first-order perturbation equations,
    # the set of initial values (x_0, y_0, z_0) must satisfy the equation:
    # x_0(0)^2 + y_0(0)^2 + z_0(0)^2 = alpha / (1 - e^(-T))
    # This is the equation of a sphere with radius R, so R^2 is given by the right-hand side.

    # Let's calculate R^2.
    # R^2 = alpha / (1 - 1/e^T) = (alpha * e_T) / (e_T - 1)
    # Substituting alpha:
    # R^2 = (1/2 * (e_T^2 - 1) * e_T) / (e_T - 1)
    # Since e_T^2 - 1 = (e_T - 1)(e_T + 1):
    # R^2 = (1/2 * (e_T - 1)(e_T + 1) * e_T) / (e_T - 1)
    # The (e_T - 1) terms cancel out, leaving a simpler expression:
    R_squared = (e_T + 1) * e_T / 2
    
    # Now, calculate R by taking the square root.
    R = R_squared.sqrt()

    # The final equation for the initial values is x_0(0)^2 + y_0(0)^2 + z_0(0)^2 = R^2
    # The numbers in this equation are the coefficients (1) and exponents (2) for each term, and the result R^2.
