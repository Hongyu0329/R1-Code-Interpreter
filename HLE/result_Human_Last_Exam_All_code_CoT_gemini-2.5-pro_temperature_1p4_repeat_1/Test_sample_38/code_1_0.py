# As derived in the steps above, the equation of motion for the scalar mode 'h' is:
# (Box - m^2)h = 0
# Comparing this to the general Klein-Gordon equation (Box - M^2)h = 0,
# we identify the squared mass of the scalar mode.
# So, we have the simple relation:
# m6_sq = m_sq
# We can write this as a linear equation to solve.
equation = sympy.Eq(m6_sq - m_sq, 0)

# Solve for m6_sq
solution = sympy.solve(equation, m6_sq)

# The result is the expression for the squared mass of the sixth degree of freedom
# The squared mass is m^2. The coefficient is 1.

# The problem doesn't give a value for m, so the answer is in terms of m.
# If we were asked for the coefficient of m^2, the answer would be 1.
# Since the question is "What is the squared mass ...?", the answer is m^2.
