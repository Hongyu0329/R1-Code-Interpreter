    "The convergence of the value iteration algorithm is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning. I will provide a step-by-step explanation within a Python code block to clarify why a specific range of rewards is or isn't required for the algorithm's convergence.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Recall the Value Iteration Update Rule:** Start with the Bellman optimality equation, which is the core of the value iteration algorithm.\n2.  **Analyze the Convergence Condition:** The algorithm's convergence is guaranteed because the Bellman operator is a \"contraction mapping.\" I will explain what this means.\n3.  **Prove the Contraction Property:** I will walk through the mathematical proof for the contraction mapping. The key part of this proof is observing which terms affect the convergence.\n4.  **Identify the Role of the Reward Function:** By examining the proof, we can determine how the reward function `R(s, a)` influences the algorithm's convergence.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, I will conclude the valid range for the reward function and print the final explanation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef explain_convergence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the convergence properties of the Value Iteration algorithm\n    and determines the required range for the reward function.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The Value Iteration Algorithm\")\n    print(\"Value iteration finds the optimal value function V* by repeatedly applying the Bellman optimality operator T:\")\n    print(\"V_{k+1}(s) = max_a [ R(s, a) + gamma * sum_{s'} P(s'|s, a) * V_k(s') ]\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: The Condition for Geometric Convergence\")\n    print(\"The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a unique V* at a geometric (or linear) rate if the operator T is a 'contraction mapping'.\")\n    print(\"A contraction mapping shrinks distances between any two points (in our case, value functions V and U).\")\n    print(\"Mathematically, for a discount factor gamma in [0, 1), this means:\")\n    print(\"||T(V) - T(U)||_inf <= gamma * ||V - U||_inf\")\n    print(\"where ||.||_inf is the maximum absolute difference across all states.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing the Contraction\")\n    print(\"Let's look at the difference |T(V)(s) - T(U)(s)| for any state s.\")\n    print(\"T(V)(s) - T(U)(s) = max_a[R(s,a) + gamma * E[V(s')]] - max_a'[R(s,a') + gamma * E[U(s')]]\")\n    print(\"\\nLet a* be the action that maximizes the first term (for V).
