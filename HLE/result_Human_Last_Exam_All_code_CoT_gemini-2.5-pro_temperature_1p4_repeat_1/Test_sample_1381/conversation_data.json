    "An equilibrium point of a dynamical system is a state where all populations remain constant over time, i.e., $\\dot{X_i} = 0$ for all species $i=1, \\dots, N$. Each equilibrium is characterized by a unique set of coexisting species.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of possible equilibria:\n1.  For the given Lotka-Volterra equations, an equilibrium state requires that for each species $i$, either its abundance $X_i$ is zero, or the term in the parentheses of the equation equals zero.\n2.  This means each equilibrium corresponds to a subset $S$ of the $N$ species having positive abundance ($X_i > 0$ for $i \\in S$), while the remaining species are extinct ($X_i = 0$ for $i \\notin S$).\n3.  By introducing auxiliary variables, the equations for the positive abundances of species in a given subset $S$ can be transformed into a system of linear equations. This system can be shown to have a unique solution. Therefore, for any choice of parameters, there is at most one equilibrium corresponding to each of the $2^N$ possible subsets of species.\n4.  This implies that the maximum number of equilibria is $2^N$.\n5.  To show that this maximum can be achieved, we can construct a set of parameters for which an equilibrium exists for every one of the $2^N$ subsets. This is generally possible if the interaction terms (related to $\\Gamma$ and the differences in $A_i$) are sufficiently small compared to the self-regulating logistic growth terms.\n\nThe following Python code verifies this by taking a number of species `N` as input, constructing a valid set of parameters, and counting the number of feasible equilibria. It then prints the result in the requested equation format.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport itertools\nimport sys\n\ndef count_equilibria(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of feasible equilibria for a given N by constructing\n    a suitable set of parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
