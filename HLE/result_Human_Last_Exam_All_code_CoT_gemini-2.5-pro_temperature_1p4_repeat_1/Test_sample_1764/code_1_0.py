    Solves for the number of embeddings in a simplified case.

    This problem is interpreted as finding the minimum number of isometric
    embeddings of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B,
    counting only embeddings that are distinct up to translation.

    This is equivalent to fixing one point, e.g., f(x_0) = 0.

    We consider the simplest case:
    - X = {x_0, x_1}, a 2-point space.
    - B = R (real numbers), a simple Banach space.
    - Let the distance be D. We must satisfy |f(x_1) - f(x_0)| = D.
