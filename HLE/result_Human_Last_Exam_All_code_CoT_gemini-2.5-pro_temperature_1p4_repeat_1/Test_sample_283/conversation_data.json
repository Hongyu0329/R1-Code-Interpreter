    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix and how many components it has.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Model the HSS Structure:** An HSS matrix is defined by a recursive partitioning. The structure of this partitioning can be represented by a tree. For a matrix recursively split along its diagonal, this forms a full binary tree where each node corresponds to a submatrix.\n2.  **Count Submatrices for One Matrix:** For a tree of a given depth `d`, we will calculate the total number of nodes. A full binary tree of depth `d` has levels from 0 to `d`. The number of nodes at level `l` is `2^l`. The total number of nodes (submatrices) is the sum of nodes at all levels.\n3.  **Count for Matrix Multiplication:** The multiplication operation `C = A * B` computes the HSS representation for the resulting matrix `C`. To compute each submatrix of `C`, the algorithm needs to access the corresponding submatrices from the input matrices `A` and `B`.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The total number of submatrices accessed will be `2 * (the number of submatrices in a single matrix)`.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation showing all the numbers.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_hss_multiplication():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication\n    of two HSS matrices of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The depth of the Hierarchical Semi-separable tree.\n    depth = 4\n\n    # In an HSS representation, the matrix is recursively partitioned. This creates\n    # a tree structure. The partitioning of diagonal blocks forms a full binary\n    # tree of the given depth. Each node in this tree represents a submatrix.\n\n    # We first calculate the number of submatrices for a single HSS matrix.\n    # A full binary tree of depth 'd' has levels 0, 1, ..., d.\n    # The number of nodes (submatrices) at level 'l' is 2^l.\n    nodes_per_level = [2**l for l in range(depth + 1)]\n\n    # The total number of submatrices for one matrix is the sum of nodes at all levels.\n    total_nodes_one_matrix = sum(nodes_per_level)\n\n    # During matrix multiplication (e.g., C = A * B), the algorithm accesses\n    # the submatrices from both input matrices, A and B.\n    num_input_matrices = 2\n\n    # The total number of submatrices accessed is 2 * (total for one matrix).\n    total_accessed_submatrices = num_input_matrices * total_nodes_one_matrix\n\n    print(f\"For an HSS tree of depth {depth}, the number of submatrices corresponds to the number of nodes in a full binary tree of that depth.\")\n    print(f\"The number of submatrices at levels 0 through {depth} are: {', '.join(map(str, nodes_per_level))}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe number of submatrices in one HSS matrix is their sum:\")\n    sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, nodes_per_level))\n    print(f\"  {sum_str} = {total_nodes_one_matrix}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nMatrix multiplication accesses the submatrices of the two input matrices.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the total number of submatrices accessed is:\\n\")\n    \n    # Final equation showing all the numbers.\n    print(f\"  {num_input_matrices} * ({sum_str}) = {total_accessed_submatrices}\")\n\n\nsolve_hss_multiplication()\n<<<62>>>\n```"
