    "In quantum mechanics, the total angular momentum `J` is the sum of the orbital angular momentum `L` and the spin angular momentum `S`. For a given `l` and `s`, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number `j` range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps. The eigenvalues of the operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ are given by $j(j+1)\\hbar^2$ and $m_j\\hbar$ respectively, where $m_j$ can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital quantum number `l` is 1, and the spin quantum number `s` is 1/2. My plan is as follows:\n1.  Determine the possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number `j`.\n2.  For each value of `j`, calculate the corresponding eigenvalue of $J^2$.\n3.  For each value of `j`, find all possible values of the magnetic quantum number `m_j`, which are the eigenvalues of $J_z$.\n4.  Print out the pairs of common eigenvalues, showing the calculations. For simplicity, we will assume $\\hbar=1$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For a p-electron, orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1\n    l = 1\n    # For an electron, spin angular momentum quantum number s=1/2\n    s = 0.5\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron with l = {l} and s = {s}:\\n\")\n\n    # The total angular momentum quantum number j can take values from |l-s| to l+s.\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    print(\"The eigenvalues of J^2 are j(j+1)hbar^2 and for J_z are m_j*hbar.\")\n    print(\"Setting hbar = 1, the common eigenvalues are:\\n\")\n\n    # Store the results for the final answer\n    eigenvalue_pairs = []\n\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Eigenvalue of J^2 is j*(j+1)\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(\"-----------------------------------------\")\n        print(f\"For the total angular momentum state j = {j}:\")\n        \n        # Print the J^2 eigenvalue calculation\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue of J^2 is {j} * ({j} + 1) = {j2_eigenvalue}\")\n        \n        # m_j ranges from -j to +j in steps of 1\n        m_j_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        print(f\"The corresponding eigenvalues of J_z (m_j) are: {list(m_j_values)}\")\n        print(\"-----------------------------------------\\n\")\n        \n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            eigenvalue_pairs.append((j2_eigenvalue, m_j))\n\n    # This part is just to generate the final answer string, not for the user to see in the script's output\n    final_answer = \", \".join([f\"({p[0]}, {p[1]})\" for p in eigenvalue_pairs])\n    # print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\n\nsolve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```\n<<<(0.75, -0.5), (0.75, 0.5), (3.75, -1.5), (3.75, -0.5), (3.75, 0.5), (3.75, 1.5)>>>"
