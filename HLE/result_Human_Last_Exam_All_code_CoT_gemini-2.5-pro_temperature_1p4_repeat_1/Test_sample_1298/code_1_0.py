# The clinical scenario describes a patient with metastatic melanoma,
# which is a cancer that has spread from its original site to other parts of the body.
# The patient shows signs of metastasis to the skin, bone, and pericardium (the sac around the heart).
# The fluid around the heart has been drained (pericardiocentesis) and was found to contain malignant cells.
# This confirms the diagnosis and explains the cardiac symptoms.

# The immediate life-threatening issue (cardiac tamponade) has been managed.
# The next step is to treat the underlying cause: the widespread cancer.

# Let's analyze the treatment options:
# A. Meloxicam: An NSAID for pain/inflammation. This is symptomatic relief, not a primary treatment for cancer.
# B. Low-dose analgesia: Pain relief. Also symptomatic.
# F. Antibiotics: For bacterial infections. Not indicated here.
# H. Diuretics: To reduce fluid buildup. This is also symptomatic and doesn't address the cause.
# E. Immunosuppression: This would weaken the body's ability to fight cancer. The opposite (immunotherapy) is often used for melanoma.
# G. Radiotherapy: This is a localized treatment for a specific tumor area. It is not suitable for cancer that has spread widely throughout the body (metastatic disease).
# D. Chemotherapy: This is a systemic treatment, meaning it travels through the bloodstream to reach and kill cancer cells all over the body. For metastatic cancer, systemic therapy is the cornerstone of treatment.

# Conclusion: Since the cancer is widespread (metastatic), a systemic treatment is required.
# Of the choices given, chemotherapy is the correct category of treatment to address the systemic nature of the disease.
# Therefore, chemotherapy is the next best step in management.
