    # The problem is to find the maximum possible genus 'g' for a surface S in R^3
    # such that:
    # 1. S is the boundary of a compact region.
    # 2. S is smooth and connected.
    # 3. The mean curvature H of S is never zero.

    # Step 1: Check genus g = 0 (Sphere)
    # A sphere of radius R has constant mean curvature H = 1/R.
    # This is non-zero. So, genus 0 is possible.

    # Step 2: Check genus g = 1 (Torus)
    # A torus of revolution with major radius R and minor radius r has a mean curvature
    # that depends on the position. For the mean curvature H to be strictly positive everywhere,
    # a specific condition must be met.
    # Condition: R > 2*r
    # If this condition holds, H > 0 everywhere. So, genus 1 is possible.

    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 3: Check genus g >= 2
    # Advanced theorems in differential geometry (from Schoen, Yau, Meeks, Simon) show
    # that a surface satisfying the given conditions cannot have a genus of 2 or more.
    # This is a deep result connecting the extrinsic curvature of the boundary to the
    # topology of the surface.
    print("Possibility for Genus g>=2: No")
    print("Theorems in advanced geometry prove that a surface with genus 2 or higher cannot satisfy the given conditions.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    # Step 4: Conclude the maximal genus.
    # Since g=0 and g=1 are possible, but g>=2 is not, the maximum is 1.
    maximal_genus = 1
    
    # The prompt asks for an equation with numbers.
    # The final answer is encapsulated in this equation.
