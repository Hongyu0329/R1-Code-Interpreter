    Solves the topology problem by identifying the properties of the space X.

    The problem describes a compact topological space X with two properties:
    1. X contains a dense copy of the long ray R. This means X is a compactification of R.
    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous function on X.
       This is the universal mapping property that uniquely defines the Stone-Čech compactification,
       denoted as βR.

    The Stone-Čech compactification of a Tychonoff space (like R) is unique up to homeomorphism.
    Therefore, any space X satisfying these properties must be homeomorphic to βR.
    This means all such spaces belong to a single homeomorphism class.
    """
    
    # The number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1, as the properties
    # uniquely define the Stone-Čech compactification of the long ray up to homeomorphism.
    number_of_classes = 1
    
    print(f"The given properties uniquely define the Stone-Čech compactification of the long ray, which is unique up to homeomorphism.")
    print(f"Therefore, there is only one such homeomorphism class.")
    print(f"The number of distinct homeomorphism classes is: {number_of_classes}")
