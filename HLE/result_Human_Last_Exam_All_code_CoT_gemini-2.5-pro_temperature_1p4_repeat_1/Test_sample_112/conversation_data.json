    "My plan is to first determine the answer to the user's question from my knowledge base. The question asks about a specific historical manuscript containing the poem \"Sir Launfal\". Once I have identified the accompanying book of manners, I will write a simple Python script. This script will store the name of the book in a variable and then use a `print` function to output the answer in a complete sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_accompanying_book():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the book of manners\n    preserved alongside the poem \"Sir Launfal\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # The poem \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in a manuscript\n    # alongside a well-known book of manners.\n    book_of_manners = \"The Boke of Curtasye\"\n    manuscript = \"Cotton Caligula A.ii\"\n\n    # Print the full answer for the user.\n    print(f\"The poem 'Sir Launfal' is preserved in the manuscript {manuscript} alongside a book of manners known as '{book_of_manners}'.\")\n\nfind_accompanying_book()\n```\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What book of manners was Sir Launfal preserved alongside?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
