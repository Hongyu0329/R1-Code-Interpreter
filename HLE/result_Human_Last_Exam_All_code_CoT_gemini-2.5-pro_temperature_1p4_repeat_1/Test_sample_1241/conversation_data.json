    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system. In the context of the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, the steady state is reached as time $t$ approaches infinity ($t \\to +\\infty$). At this point, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant, which we'll denote as $p_i$. Consequently, their time derivatives, $P_i'(t)$, become zero.\n\nThis transforms the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations:\n\n1.  $0 = -0.019 p_0 + 0.65 p_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 p_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) p_1 + 0.392 p_2 + 0.008 p_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 p_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) p_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 p_2 - 0.008 p_3$\n\nWe must also include the normalization condition, which states that the sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n\n5.  $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n\nAny one of the first four equations is redundant (it's a linear combination of the others). We can therefore drop one of them (e.g., the second one) and solve the remaining system of four linear equations for the four unknown probabilities $p_0, p_1, p_2,$ and $p_3$.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Set up a system of four linear equations using the first, third, fourth, and fifth equations from the list above.\n2.  Represent this system in matrix form, $A\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{b}$.\n3.  Solve for the vector of probabilities $\\mathbf{p} = [p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3]^T$ using Python's NumPy library.\n4.  Calculate the desired sum, $p_0 + p_1$, and print the result in the requested format.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the transition rate coefficients\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# At steady state (t -> +inf), let p_i = P_i(+inf). The derivatives are zero.\n# This gives a system of linear equations. We use three independent rate\n# equations plus the normalization equation.\n# 1. 0 = -lambda_01*p0 + lambda_10*p1\n# 2. 0 = lambda_12*p1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*p2\n# 3. 0 = lambda_23*p2 - lambda_31*p3\n# 4. 1 = p0 + p1 + p2 + p3\n#\n# We can write this system in matrix form A*p = b, where p = [p0, p1, p2, p3]^T.\n\nA = np.array([\n    [-lambda_01, lambda_10, 0, 0],\n    [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n    [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Solve the system of linear equations for p\ntry:\n    p = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n    p0 = p[0]\n    p1 = p[1]\n\n    # The value to be found is P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) = p0 + p1\n    result = p0 + p1\n\n    # Print the final equation with the calculated values\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    # The f-string formatting will display the full precision of the float variables.\n    print(f\"P0(inf) + P1(inf) = {p0} + {p1} = {result}\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations is singular and cannot be solved.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339464>>>"
