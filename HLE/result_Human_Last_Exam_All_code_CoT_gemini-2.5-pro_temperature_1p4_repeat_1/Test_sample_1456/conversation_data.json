    "This is a problem in the field of mathematics known as continuum theory. To solve it, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Recall the relevant theorem:** I'll use the established theorem that relates the number of composants of a product of continua to the number of composants of the individual continua. The theorem states that if `N(Z)` is the number of composants of a continuum `Z`, then for two continua `X` and `Y`, the number of composants of their product is `N(X x Y) = N(X) * N(Y)`.\n\n2.  **Determine the maximum number of composants:** I'll determine the maximum possible number of composants that a single nondegenerate continuum can have. This involves considering different types of continua, from simple ones like an arc to complex ones like indecomposable continua.\n\n3.  **Calculate the maximum for the product:** Using the theorem from step 1 and the maximum value from step 2, I'll calculate the largest possible number of composants for the product space `X x Y`.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that codifies this reasoning. The script will use string representations for cardinal numbers (like 'c' for the cardinality of the continuum) to explain the logic and present the final equation and answer.\n\n```python\ndef cardinal_product(card1, card2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the product of two cardinal numbers symbolically.\n    This is a simplified version for this specific problem.\n    'c' represents the cardinality of the continuum.\n    This function implements the rule that for any cardinal M > 0, M * c = c.\n    \"\"\"\n    if card1 == 'c' or card2 == 'c':\n        return 'c'\n    # This function is not comprehensive, only covering the case needed.\n    return None\n\ndef solve_composants_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the maximum number of composants\n    in the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Introduction to the problem and the main theorem.\n    print(\"This problem is solved using a theorem from continuum theory.\")\n    print(\"Let X and Y be two continua, and let N(Z) be the number (cardinality) of composants of a continuum Z.\")\n    print(\"The theorem states: N(X x Y) = N(X) * N(Y)\\n\")\n\n    # To maximize N(X x Y), we need to maximize N(X) and N(Y).\n    print(\"To find the largest possible value for N(X x Y), we must find the largest possible values for N(X) and N(Y).\")\n\n    # Discussion of the possible number of composants for a single continuum.\n    print(\"A nondegenerate continuum can have:\")\n    print(\" - A finite number of composants (1, 2, 3, ...).\")\n    print(\" - A countably infinite number of composants.\")\n    print(\" - An uncountably infinite number of composants.\")\n\n    # State the maximum number of composants for a single continuum.\n    # A nondegenerate continuum Z has at most 'c' points, where 'c' is the cardinality\n    # of the continuum.
