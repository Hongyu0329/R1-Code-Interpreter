    Calculates and demonstrates the VC dimension for the given problem.

    The problem asks for the VC dimension of a concept class defined by the
    fragment of first-order logic FO_{exists, and, true, false}[S], where S
    is a schema with 4 unary predicates.

    Step 1: Analyze the structure of the concepts.
    A formula phi(x) in this logic is equivalent, in any given model, to either
    'false' or a conjunction of atomic predicates involving the free variable x.
    This means the concept class is the set of all possible intersections of the
    base concepts defined by the 4 predicates. This includes the empty intersection
    (the whole universe) and the empty set.

    Step 2: Determine the VC dimension.
    The VC dimension is the size 'd' of the largest set of points that can be shattered.
    The number of concepts formed by intersecting 4 base sets is at most 2^4 = 16.
    To shatter a set of size d, we need to generate 2^d subsets.
    So, 2^d <= 16, which implies d <= 4. The VC dimension is at most 4.

    To show the VC dimension is exactly 4, we must demonstrate that a set of
    4 points can be shattered.
