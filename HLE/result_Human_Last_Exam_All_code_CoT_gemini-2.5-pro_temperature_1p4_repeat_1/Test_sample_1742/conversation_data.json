    "Here is my plan to solve the problem.\nFirst, I will identify the properties of the algebra $A = \\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$. This is the path algebra of a type $A_3$ quiver with linear orientation. This algebra is hereditary.\n\nSecond, I need to understand the definitions of a $\\tau$-tilting module and a slice module in this context.\n*   A **$\\tau$-tilting module** (in the modern sense relevant here) is a module $T$ that is $\\tau$-rigid (meaning $\\text{Hom}_A(T, \\tau T)=0$) and has $n=3$ non-isomorphic indecomposable summands.\n*   A **slice module** for a hereditary algebra like $A$ is equivalent to a classical tilting module. A key property of a tilting module is that it must be **sincere**, meaning its support involves all simple modules. The support of a module is the set of simple modules $S_i$ for which the corresponding idempotent $e_i$ does not annihilate the module.\n\nThe problem states there is a *unique* $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice. This implies we are looking for a unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is **not sincere**.\n\nMy strategy will be to:\n1.  List all 6 indecomposable modules over $A$.\n2.  Determine the action of the Auslander-Reiten translation, $\\tau$, on these modules. This is the crucial step for checking the $\\tau$-rigidity condition. For the given algebra, it turns out that the only non-zero action among the indecomposables is $\\tau(S_2) = S_1$.\n3.  Systematically check all possible combinations of 3 indecomposable modules. For each combination, I will check if it is $\\tau$-rigid.\n4.  For each $\\tau$-tilting module found, I will check if it is sincere.\n5.  I will identify the unique module that is $\\tau$-tilting but not sincere.\n6.  Finally, I will present this module, and as requested, provide an equation showing the sum of the dimension vectors of its summands.\n\nI will implement this logic in a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_module_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the unique tau-tilting module that is not a slice for the\n    path algebra A = C(1->2->3).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 6 indecomposable modules over A\n    indecs = [\"S1\", \"S2\", \"S3\", \"M12\", \"M23\", \"M13\"]\n\n    # The support of each indecomposable module, indicating which simple\n    # modules are involved in its structure.\n    supports = {\n        \"S1\": {1},\n        \"S2\": {2},\n        \"S3\": {3},\n        \"M12\": {1, 2},\n        \"M23\": {2, 3},\n        \"M13\": {1, 2, 3}\n    }\n\n    # The Auslander-Reiten translation (tau) acts on the indecomposables.\n    # For this algebra, the only non-zero translation is tau(S2) = S1.\n    # tau(M) = 0 for all other indecomposable modules M since they are\n    # either projective or injective.\n    tau_map = {\"S2\": \"S1\"}\n\n    # To check for tau-rigidity, Hom(T, tau(T)) = 0, we need to know\n    # which modules X have Hom(X, S1) != 0.\n    # These are the modules that have S1 as a quotient.\n    hom_to_S1_non_zero = {\"S1\", \"M12\", \"M13\"}\n\n    # Dimension vectors for each indecomposable module.\n    dim_vectors = {\n        \"S1\": (1, 0, 0), \"S2\": (0, 1, 0), \"S3\": (0, 0, 1),\n        \"M12\": (1, 1, 0), \"M23\": (0, 1, 1), \"M13\": (1, 1, 1)\n    }\n\n    def is_tau_rigid(module_summands):\n        \"\"\"A module is tau-rigid if Hom(M, tau(M)) = 0.\"\"\"\n        # This condition fails only if S2 is a summand, and another summand X\n        # has Hom(X, tau(S2)) = Hom(X, S1) != 0.\n        if \"S2\" in module_summands:\n            for m in module_summands:\n                if m in hom_to_S1_non_zero:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    def is_sincere(module_summands):\n        \"\"\"A module is sincere if its support covers all simple modules {1, 2, 3}.\"\"\"\n        total_support = set()\n        for m in module_summands:\n            total_support.update(supports[m])\n        return total_support == {1, 2, 3}\n\n    # The number of vertices in the quiver.\n    n = 3\n    \n    non_slice_modules = []\n\n    # Iterate through all combinations of n indecomposable modules.\n    for combo in itertools.combinations(indecs, n):\n        module_summands = set(combo)\n        # A module is tau-tilting if it is tau-rigid and has n summands.\n        if is_tau_rigid(module_summands):\n            # A slice module must be sincere.
