    "My plan is to provide a Python script that answers the user's question about the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define variables for the key components of the question: the container type (`single-dose ampule`), the environment (`sterile environment, ISO Class 5 or better`), and the corresponding BUD in hours based on USP <797> guidelines.\n2.  Use these variables to print a clear, explanatory sentence that states the rule.\n3.  The final print statement will explicitly state the number of hours, fulfilling the request to show the number in the final output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_bud_for_single_dose_ampule():\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates and explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n  opened in a sterile environment according to USP <797> guidelines.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  # Define the parameters based on the user's query\n  container_type = \"single-dose container (ampule or vial)\"\n  environment = \"ISO Class 5 or better sterile environment\"\n  \n  # According to USP <797> (revised 2023), the BUD for a single-dose container\n  # once opened or punctured in an ISO 5 environment is 12 hours.\n  bud_in_hours = 12\n  \n  # Print the explanation and the final answer\n  print(f\"The question is about the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a {container_type}.\")\n  print(f\"The container is opened (punctured or broken) in a {environment}.\")\n  print(\"Based on USP <797> guidelines, the BUD is determined by these factors.\")\n  print(\"\\nThe final answer is:\")\n  print(f\"The BUD is {bud_in_hours} hours from the time of puncture.\")\n\n# Execute the function\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  get_bud_for_single_dose_ampule()\n```\n<<<12>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
