    "To identify the ballet step that has the same ending leg position as the starting position, we need to analyze the execution of each movement. The key is to determine if the step, by its definition, returns the dancer to their exact starting stance, including which foot is in front.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n1.  **Define the condition:** We are looking for a step where `start_position` is identical to `end_position`. This means not only the same type of position (e.g., fifth) but also the same configuration (i.e., the same foot is in front at the start and end).\n2.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   **A. Entrechat six:** An even-numbered `entrechat` (like four, six) is a vertical jump with beats that, by definition, lands in the same position it started from. For example, if you start in fifth position with the right foot in front, you will land in fifth position with the right foot in front.\n    *   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The term `changé` means \"changed\". This step explicitly ends with the feet in the opposite configuration from the start.\n    *   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble\", this step typically involves bringing a leg from the back to the front (or front to back), thus changing the configuration of the feet in fifth position.\n    *   **D. Glissade derrière:** This is a \"gliding step to the back\". The front foot moves to close in the back, changing the feet.\n    *   **E. Gargouillade:** A complex, decorative step that is a form of `pas de chat` and does not end in the original starting position.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the definitions, only `Entrechat six` returns the dancer to the identical starting position.\n\nThe following Python code models this logic. It defines the properties of each step and programmatically finds the one that meets our condition. It then prints the analysis for the correct answer, including a representative \"equation\" as requested.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same\n    position it starts in.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the properties of each ballet step.\n    # 'changes_feet' being False means the start and end positions are identical.\n    Step = collections.namedtuple('Step', ['name', 'changes_feet'])\n    steps = [\n        Step(name='A.
