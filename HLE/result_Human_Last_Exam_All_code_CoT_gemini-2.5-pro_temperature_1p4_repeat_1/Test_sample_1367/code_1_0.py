    # Part (a): Is V(p) simple for all p in Z_>=1?
    # The vertex algebra V(p), known as the triplet W-algebra, is simple if and only if p is a prime number.
    # Since the question considers all positive integers p, which includes composite numbers, V(p) is not always simple.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b): If there exists a non-trivial ideal in V(p), what condition must be met?
    # By definition, a non-trivial ideal I is a submodule of V(p). Since the affine algebra L_k(sl_2) is
    # a subalgebra of V(p), I must be an L_k(sl_2)-module.
    # Also, a non-trivial ideal in a vertex algebra with a highest-weight structure is generated by
    # a singular vector. Therefore, the ideal must contain a singular vector. Both conditions are necessary.
    answer_b = "both"

    # Part (c): Does the simplicity of V(p) imply that it is also irreducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module?
    # Simplicity of V(p) means it is irreducible as a module over itself. However, it can still be reducible
    # when viewed as a module over a subalgebra. For p >= 3 and prime, V(p) is simple, but it decomposes
    # into a direct sum of irreducible L_k(sl_2)-modules, making it reducible.
    # Thus, simplicity does not imply irreducibility as an L_k(sl_2)-module.
    answer_c = "No"

    # Format the final output as specified in the question.
