# Plan: Calculate the number of carbon atoms in the fictitious molecule "mercedesbenzene".
# This is interpreted as the molecule 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.

# 1. Start with the number of carbons in the base molecule, benzene.
carbons_in_benzene = 6

# 2. The "Mercedes" part implies 3 symmetrically placed groups.
number_of_groups = 3

# 3. The simplest carbon-containing group is a methyl group, which has 1 carbon.
carbons_per_group = 1

# 4. Calculate the total number of carbon atoms.
total_carbons = carbons_in_benzene + (number_of_groups * carbons_per_group)

# Print out the reasoning and the final calculation
print("The molecule 'mercedesbenzene' is commonly interpreted as a benzene ring (6 carbons) with three methyl groups (1 carbon each) attached, resembling the Mercedes-Benz logo.")
print("The calculation is as follows:")
print(f"Carbons from the benzene ring + (Number of points * Carbons per point) = Total Carbons")
print(f"{carbons_in_benzene} + ({number_of_groups} * {carbons_per_group}) = {total_carbons}")
print(f"\nFinal equation: {carbons_in_benzene} + {number_of_groups * carbons_per_group} = {total_carbons}")
print(f"\nSo, mercedesbenzene would have {total_carbons} carbons.")
