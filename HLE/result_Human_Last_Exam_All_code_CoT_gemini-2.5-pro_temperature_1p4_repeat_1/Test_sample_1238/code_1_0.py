    print("\nThe user asks whether a smooth solution to the 2D Navier-Stokes equation can 'blow up' in finite time.")
    print("This is a fundamental question in the theory of partial differential equations.")
    print("\n-------------------------")
    print("        ANSWER")
    print("-------------------------")
    print("No, a solution to the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with smooth, divergence-free, and periodic initial data will NOT blow up in finite time.")
    print("It is a classical mathematical result, first proven by Jean Leray in the 1930s, that such solutions exist and remain smooth for all time (t >= 0).")

    print("\n-------------------------")
    print("   KEY REASONING (Vorticity Formulation)")
    print("-------------------------")
    print("The reason for this global regularity in 2D, which contrasts with the unresolved 3D case, lies in the behavior of vorticity.")

    print("\n1. Vorticity Equation in 2D:")
    print("   Let the vorticity be the scalar field omega = curl(u). Taking the curl of the Navier-Stokes equation gives the vorticity transport equation:")
    print("   (d/dt)omega + u . grad(omega) = nu * Delta(omega)")
    print("   (where nu is the viscosity, which is 1 in the problem statement).")

    print("\n2. Absence of Vortex Stretching:")
    print("   Crucially, in 2D, the 'vortex stretching' term (omega . grad(u)), which is present in the 3D vorticity equation, is identically zero.")
    print("   This term is the primary mechanism suspected of causing blowup in 3D, as it can potentially amplify vorticity very rapidly.")

    print("\n3. Maximum Principle:")
    print("   The 2D vorticity equation is a transport-diffusion equation. The maximum principle applies to this type of equation.")
    print("   It guarantees that the maximum value of the vorticity |omega(x, t)| at any time t can never exceed its maximum initial value, |omega(x, 0)|.")
    print("   i.e., ||omega(t)||_L_infinity <= ||omega_0||_L_infinity for all t.")

    print("\n4. Boundedness Guarantees Smoothness:")
    print("   Since the vorticity remains bounded for all time, one can use this fact (along with the Biot-Savart law and standard elliptic estimates) to show that all derivatives of the velocity field 'u' also remain bounded for all time.")
    print("   This means the solution 'u' remains smooth and cannot form a singularity (blow up).")

    print("\n--- CONCLUSION ---")
    print("The structure of the equations in two dimensions prevents the nonlinear term from creating unbounded growth. Therefore, for any smooth initial data, the solution remains smooth globally in time.")
