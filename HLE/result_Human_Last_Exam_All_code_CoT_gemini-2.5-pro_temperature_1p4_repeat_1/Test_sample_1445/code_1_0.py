    This function explains the reasoning and calculates the number of operations.
    The problem asks for the minimum number of operations n required to transform any 100-digit binary sequence into any other. This is a "worst-case" analysis.

    Let's analyze the operations:
    - Insertion/Deletion of identical digits. These operations fundamentally alter the "groups" of consecutive digits.
    - For example, `000110` has 3 groups (`000`, `11`, `0`). Its "skeleton" is `010`.

    Let's find a pair of sequences (S, T) that is hard to transform. A likely candidate involves a sequence with the maximum number of groups and one with a different group structure.
    - S: A sequence with maximum groups, e.g., `0101...01`. It has 100 groups, each of length 1.
    - T: A sequence like `00110011...`. It has 50 groups (`00`, `11`, etc.), each of length 2.

    The transformation from S to T can be done in two main phases:
    1.  Transform the skeleton of S to match the skeleton of T.
        - Skeleton of S is `(01)^50`.
        - Skeleton of T is `(01)^25`.
        - We need to remove 25 `01` pairs from the skeleton of S.
        - To remove one `01` pair from the middle of `...x(01)y...` takes 2 operations (one to delete the 0-group, one to delete the 1-group, causing merges).
        - Operations for this phase = 25 pairs * 2 ops/pair = 50 operations.
        - After this, we have a sequence with skeleton `(01)^25` where each group is length 1.

    2.  Adjust the lengths of the remaining groups.
        - The new sequence has 50 groups of length 1.
        - Target T has 50 groups of length 2.
        - Each of the 50 groups needs to be resized (e.g., `0` -> `00`), which takes 1 operation per group.
        - Operations for this phase = 50 groups * 1 op/group = 50 operations.

    The total number of operations for this specific worst-case pair is the sum of operations from both phases.
