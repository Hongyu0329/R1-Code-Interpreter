# The user wants to find the smallest number of operations to grow a k-item chain to a (k+1)-item chain.

# Let's outline the reasoning based on creating the simplest possible chain.
# A chain of items has a root of degree 1 (for a chain of length > 1).
# The only operation that can create a parent-child link is `Delete-min` via its consolidation phase.
# To create a single tree with a degree-1 root, the `consolidate` algorithm must combine roots.
# The simplest way to get a single degree-1 tree is to consolidate exactly two degree-0 trees.

print("At this point, the heap contains two trees, each being a single node (degree 0).")

print(f"Step 3: Now, we call 'Delete-min' to remove the dummy node 'm'. This requires {ops_to_consolidate} 'Delete-min' operation.")

print("The consolidation process will now run on the remaining roots 'y1' and 'y2'. Since they are both degree-0, they will be linked into a single tree of degree 1, which is a 2-item chain.")
