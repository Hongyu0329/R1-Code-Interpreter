    "The problem asks for the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. This is a classic problem in the field of symmetry analysis of differential equations, with the definitive result established by L.V. Ovsiannikov.\n\nThe dimension of a Lie group corresponds to the number of independent infinitesimal generators that constitute its Lie algebra. For the unforced incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions, the maximal Lie algebra of point symmetries is isomorphic to the Schrödinger algebra $sch(3)$.\n\nI will calculate the dimension of this algebra by identifying and counting the generators for each independent symmetry transformation.\n\nThe independent symmetry transformations are:\n1.  **Time translation**: The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on time), so they are invariant under shifts in time $t \\to t + c$. This provides **1** generator.\n2.  **Space translations**: The equations are defined in a homogeneous space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so they are invariant under spatial shifts $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}$. This provides **3** generators.\n3.  **Space rotations**: The equations are isotropic (rotationally invariant). This corresponds to the special orthogonal group $SO(3)$, which has **3** generators (rotations about the x, y, and z axes).\n4.  **Galilean boosts**: The equations obey Galilean relativity, meaning they are invariant under a change to a uniformly moving reference frame, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t, \\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$. This provides **3** generators, one for each direction of the boost velocity $\\mathbf{v}$.\n5.  **Dilations (scaling)**: The equations are invariant under a specific scaling transformation of all variables: $t \\to \\lambda^2 t, \\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, p \\to \\lambda^{-2} p$. This is a one-parameter group, providing **1** generator.\n6.  **Special Conformal Transformations**: There is one additional generator corresponding to a special conformal (or projective) transformation, which is a hallmark of the Schrödinger algebra. This provides **1** generator.\n\nThe total dimension of the Lie group is the sum of these independent generators. The Python code below will sum these values to find the total dimension.\n\n```python\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the\n    3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The symmetry group of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations corresponds to the\n    # Schrödinger group sch(3).
