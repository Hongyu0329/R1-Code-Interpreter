    Analyzes the provided R script to determine the expected number of chemotypes.

    The R script simulates two datasets, 'controls' and 'water_stress', by calling the `generate_chemistry` function separately for each.

    1. Data Generation: Inside `generate_chemistry`, all specimens are initially drawn from the same set of normal distributions. This creates a single cloud of data points.
    
    2. Baseline Subtraction: A single 'baseline' vector is generated. For a given call (e.g., for all controls), this exact same baseline is subtracted from every single specimen in that group. This operation shifts the entire cloud of data points but does not split it into distinct sub-clusters.
    
    3. Normalization: Normalizing each specimen's data to sum to 1 will rescale the data but will not create new clusters from a single, existing one.

    Conclusion: Since the simulation process for the 'controls' generates a single, unimodal population, and the process for the 'water_stress' group also generates a single, unimodal population, we should expect to see only one cluster (chemotype) within each group.
