# Step 1 & 2: Decipher Y1 and establish variables.
# Clue 1 points to the year Samuel Kier discovered petroleum in his salt wells.
Y1 = 1846

# From Y1 = X1X2X3X4 = 1846, we get X1=1, X2=8, X3=4, X4=6.
# This sets the structure for Y2 and Y3.

# Step 3: Solve for Y2, Y3, Y4 based on the cryptic Clue 2.
# The number sequence that fits the variable constraints is:
Y2 = 22842
Y3 = 4622
Y4 = 101

# Step 4: Calculate the indices for the Heck reaction reactants from Clue 3.
# Reactant 1: Iodobenzene (C6H5I)
# Reactant 2: Styrene (C8H8)
# The "topological state index" is interpreted as the sum of atomic numbers.
atomic_number_C = 6
atomic_number_H = 1
atomic_number_I = 53

# Index for Iodobenzene
index1 = (6 * atomic_number_C) + (5 * atomic_number_H) + (1 * atomic_number_I)

# Index for Styrene
index2 = (8 * atomic_number_C) + (8 * atomic_number_H)

# Step 5: Assemble and print the final result.
# The final result is the sequence of Y4, Y1, and the two reactant indices.
# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.

print("The final calculation results in the following numbers:")
print(f"Y4 = {Y4}")
print(f"Y1 = {Y1}")
print(f"Reactant Index 1 = {index1}")
print(f"Reactant Index 2 = {index2}")
print(f"The final equation can be represented by the sequence:")
print(f"{Y4} to the {Y1}-Hall indices are {index1}, {index2}")
# The problem asks to directly return the answer in a specific format at the end.
# I will output the final sequence of numbers.
final_answer_string = f"{Y4}, {Y1}, {index1}, {index2}"
print(f"<<<{final_answer_string}>>>")
