    Analyzes the provided statements about attack graph analysis.
    
    A. Correct. Attack graphs are directed graphs where graph theory algorithms are applicable.
    B. Correct. The state explosion problem is a key challenge, with complexity related to 2^N.
    C. Correct. The problem is computationally hard (PSPACE-complete, which is also NP-hard).
    D. Correct. Attack graphs are dynamic and require incremental update techniques.
    E. Correct. Model checking is a standard technique for formal verification using attack graphs.
    
    Since all statements are correct, the answer is 'N'.
