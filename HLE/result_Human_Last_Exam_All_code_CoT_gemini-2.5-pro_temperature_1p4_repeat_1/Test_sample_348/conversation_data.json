    "Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Functions**: We will represent the given supply `P = ln(Q³ - 2)` and demand `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` functions in Python.\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium**: The market reaches equilibrium where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. We need to solve the equation `ln(Q³ - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` to find the equilibrium quantity (`Q_E`). Since this equation cannot be solved analytically in a simple way, we will use a numerical solver from the SciPy library. Once `Q_E` is found, we will calculate the equilibrium price (`P_E`) by substituting `Q_E` back into either the supply or demand function.\n3.  **Calculate Surpluses**:\n    *   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the economic benefit to consumers. It is the area below the demand curve and above the equilibrium price line, calculated by integrating the demand function minus the equilibrium price from `Q=0` to `Q=Q_E`.\n    *   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the economic benefit to producers. It is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price line. We must note the supply function is only defined for `Q > (2)^(1/3)`. The integral will be calculated from this minimum quantity to `Q=Q_E`.\n    *   Both integrals will be computed numerically using SciPy.\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare**: The total welfare for the market is simply the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus (`Total Welfare = CS + PS`).\n5.  **Display the Final Result**: The script will output the calculated values for equilibrium, the surpluses, and the final total welfare.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_and_calculate_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines the supply and demand curves, finds the market equilibrium,\n    and calculates the consumer surplus, producer surplus, and total welfare.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
