    # The problem is to evaluate lim_{n->inf} P[V_n > 2/3].

    # 1. The process X_t is a complex Brownian motion conditioned to never hit the unit disk.
    #    This conditioning introduces an outward drift, making the process transient. A transient
    #    process in 2D has a path that goes to infinity and is not dense in the plane.

    # 2. V_n is the relative area of the disk B_n covered by the sausage of the path of X_t.
    #    For a transient process in 2D, the asymptotic density of its sausage is 0.
    #    We can show that V_n converges to 0 in probability.

    # 3. Formally, the expectation E[V_n] can be shown to behave like 1 / (log(n))^2.
    #    As n -> infinity, E[V_n] -> 0.

    # 4. Since V_n is a non-negative random variable, if E[V_n] -> 0, then V_n -> 0 in probability.
    #    This means that for any constant c > 0, the probability P(V_n > c) will approach 0.

    # 5. We are asked for the limit of P(V_n > 2/3).
