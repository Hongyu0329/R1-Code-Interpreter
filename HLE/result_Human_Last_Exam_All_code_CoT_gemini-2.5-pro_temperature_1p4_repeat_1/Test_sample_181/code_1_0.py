# The function foo(7) calculates the number of group structures on a set of 7 elements.
# Direct computation is infeasible. The problem can be solved using group theory.
# The number of group tables for a group of prime order 'n' is given by n! / phi(n).

n = 7

# Step 1: Calculate n! (factorial of n)
n_factorial = math.factorial(n)

# Step 2: Calculate phi(n) (Euler's totient function)
# For a prime number n, phi(n) = n - 1.
phi_n = n - 1

# Step 3: Calculate the final result
count = n_factorial // phi_n
