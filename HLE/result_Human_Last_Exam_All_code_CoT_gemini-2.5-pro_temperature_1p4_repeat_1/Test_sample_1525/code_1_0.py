# Step 1: Analyze each statement's correctness based on the provided logical framework.
# Statement A is correct because the "order of appearance" is not a well-defined property of a Datalog program (which is a set).
is_A_correct = True

# Statement B is incorrect because it misquotes the main claim and its reasoning about the uniqueness of applying γ is flawed.
is_B_correct = False

# Statement C is correct because aggregation (γ) is a lossy (many-to-one) operation, so γ⁻¹[γ[P]] would not generally equal P.
is_C_correct = True

# Statement D is correct because the segregation definition is complex and its application to a set of facts (S₀) is ambiguous.
is_D_correct = True

# Statement E is correct as it provides a sound high-level interpretation of the main claim's meaning regarding coarse-grained inference.
is_E_correct = True

# Step 2: Count the number of true statements.
correct_statements_list = [is_A_correct, is_B_correct, is_C_correct, is_D_correct, is_E_correct]
count_of_correct_statements = sum(correct_statements_list)

# Step 3: Print the final count as requested by the user prompt.
print(count_of_correct_statements)
