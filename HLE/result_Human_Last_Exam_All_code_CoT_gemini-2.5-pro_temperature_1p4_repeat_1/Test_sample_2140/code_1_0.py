# Step 1: Solve the first trivia question.
# The question refers to the Soviet Union's actions on the Moon in a game, and a related dangerous situation in another game.
# A word that fits both clues is "MINED". In strategy games, factions mine resources. In many other games, a "mined" territory is dangerous due to explosive traps.
answer1 = "MINED"
second_letter1 = answer1[1]
print(f"Answer 1: {answer1}")
print(f"The second letter is: {second_letter1}\n")

# Step 2: Solve the second trivia question.
# This refers to an incident where the wrong anthem was played for the Northern Ireland team in the game Pro Evolution Soccer 2008.
# The publisher of the game, Konami, issued a formal apology.
answer2 = "KONAMI"
second_letter2 = answer2[1]
print(f"Answer 2: {answer2}")
print(f"The second letter is: {second_letter2}\n")

# Step 3: Solve the third trivia question.
# This describes a famous easter egg. On a level in the game Earthworm Jim, a sound plays which, when reversed,
# is a voice saying "Eat your vegetables and brush after every meal".
answer3 = "EARTHWORM JIM"
second_letter3 = answer3[1]
print(f"Answer 3: {answer3}")
print(f"The second letter is: {second_letter3}\n")

# Step 4: Solve the fourth trivia question.
# This is a complex riddle referencing Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. The "armored heroine" is like Don Quixote, and her companion ("HIM") is like Sancho Panza, who rode a donkey.
# The Latin word for donkey is "ASINUS".
answer4 = "ASINUS"
second_letter4 = answer4[1]
print(f"Answer 4: {answer4}")
print(f"The second letter is: {second_letter4}\n")

# Step 5: Solve the fifth trivia question.
# This refers to pro-gamer Dennis Fong's pioneering use of the mouse for looking and keyboard for movement.
# While the clue about replacing letters in "MAGIC HAND" is confusing, a common term for a pro-player's skill and mindset is "GAMING HEAD".
answer5 = "GAMING HEAD"
second_letter5 = answer5[1]
print(f"Answer 5: {answer5}")
print(f"The second letter is: {second_letter5}\n")

# Final step: Combine the second letters in order to reveal the hidden word.
hidden_word = second_letter1 + second_letter2 + second_letter3 + second_letter4 + second_letter5
print("-----------------------------------------")
print(f"Combining the second letters ({second_letter1}, {second_letter2}, {second_letter3}, {second_letter4}, {second_letter5}) gives the hidden word:")
print(f"The hidden word is: {hidden_word}")
print("-----------------------------------------")
