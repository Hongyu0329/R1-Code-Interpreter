    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the function properties:** Let $f$ be a continuous function such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n    *   Since $\\exp(x)$ is injective, $f$ must be injective.\n    *   A continuous, injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotone (either increasing or decreasing).\n\n2.  **Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing.**\n    *   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then $f \\circ f$ is strictly increasing. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, which is strictly increasing.\n    *   From $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, we can deduce $f(\\exp(x)) = f(f(f(x))) = \\exp(f(x))$. So, $f$ and $\\exp$ commute.\n    *   A strictly decreasing continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have a unique fixed point $x_0$, i.e., $f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    *   Applying $f$ to this equation, we get $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    *   From the original equation, $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $x_0 = \\exp(x_0)$. However, the equation $x = e^x$ has no real solutions (since $e^x \\ge x+1$, with equality only at $x=0$, but $e^0=1 \\ne 0$).\n    *   This is a contradiction. Thus, there are no strictly decreasing continuous solutions. The cardinality for this case is 0.\n\n3.  **Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing.**\n    *   This case is consistent with $f \\circ f$ being increasing.\n    *   Solutions to $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ are known as functional square roots of the exponential function. These can be constructed using Abel's functional equation. The idea is to find a homeomorphism $\\psi: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\psi(\\exp(x)) = \\psi(x) + 1$.\n    *   Once such a $\\psi$ is found, a solution $f$ can be defined as $f(x) = \\psi^{-1}(\\psi(x) + 1/2)$. Let's verify this:\n        $f(f(x)) = \\psi^{-1}(\\psi(f(x)) + 1/2) = \\psi^{-1}(\\psi(\\psi^{-1}(\\psi(x) + 1/2)) + 1/2) = \\psi^{-1}((\\psi(x) + 1/2) + 1/2) = \\psi^{-1}(\\psi(x) + 1)$.\n        Since $\\psi(\\exp(x)) = \\psi(x) + 1$, we have $\\exp(x) = \\psi^{-1}(\\psi(x) + 1)$. Thus, $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n    *   The construction of $\\psi$ is not unique. One can define $\\psi$ arbitrarily on an interval of the form $[a, e^a]$ as any strictly increasing continuous function mapping $[a, e^a]$ to $[0,1]$. This definition can then be extended to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the relation $\\psi(\\exp(x)) = \\psi(x) + 1$.\n    *   The set of such initial functions (homeomorphisms from one interval to another) has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   It can be shown that different choices of the initial function can lead to different solutions $f$. The number of distinct solutions is also the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The set of solutions contains only strictly increasing functions, and its cardinality is $\\mathfrak{c}$, which is equal to $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThe following Python code will print the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the solution to the problem of finding the cardinality of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R with f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n\n    The mathematical derivation shows:\n    1. Any such function must be strictly monotone.\n    2. There are no strictly decreasing solutions.\n    3. The number of strictly increasing solutions is the cardinality of the continuum, c.\n\n    The cardinality of the continuum is c = 2^aleph_0. Aleph_0 is the cardinality of natural numbers.\n    The final equation for the cardinality (denoted as 'C') is C = 2^{\\u2135}.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The equation for the cardinality C. \\u2135 is the Unicode for the Aleph symbol.\n    equation = \"C = 2^{\\u2135}\"\n    \n    print(\"The cardinality of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R such that f(f(x)) = exp(x) is given by the equation:\")\n    print(equation)\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers in this final equation are:\")\n    \n    # As requested, printing each number in the final equation.\n    number_in_base = 2\n    number_in_exponent = 0 # From Aleph_0\n    \n    print(number_in_base)\n    print(number_in_exponent)\n\nsolve_cardinality()\n```\n<<<The cardinality of the set is $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the continuum.>>>"
