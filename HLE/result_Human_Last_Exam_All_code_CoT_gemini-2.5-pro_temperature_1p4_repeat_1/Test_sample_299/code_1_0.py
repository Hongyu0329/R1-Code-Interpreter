    This function presents the solution to the problem of finding the cardinality of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R with f(f(x)) = exp(x).

    The mathematical derivation shows:
    1. Any such function must be strictly monotone.
    2. There are no strictly decreasing solutions.
    3. The number of strictly increasing solutions is the cardinality of the continuum, c.

    The cardinality of the continuum is c = 2^aleph_0. Aleph_0 is the cardinality of natural numbers.
    The final equation for the cardinality (denoted as 'C') is C = 2^{\u2135}.
