    "The question asks for the number of different types of stable reduction for a curve of genus 2. This is a question from the field of algebraic geometry, specifically concerning the moduli space of curves. A stable reduction is the special fiber of a stable model of the curve, and it is itself a stable curve of the same arithmetic genus. The \"types\" refer to the different combinatorial structures these stable curves can have.\n\nMy plan to answer this is as follows:\n1.  I will classify the possible structures of a stable curve of arithmetic genus 2. A stable curve is a connected projective curve with only nodal singularities (ordinary double points) and a finite automorphism group.\n2.  This classification can be broken down by analyzing the number of irreducible components of the curve.\n3.  For each case, I will check the conditions for stability. A key condition is that any rational component (a curve of genus 0, isomorphic to P¹) must have at least three special points (i.e., nodes) on it.\n4.  By systematically enumerating all possible valid configurations, I will arrive at the total number of distinct types.\n\nThe classification yields the following types:\n\n**A) Irreducible Curves (1 component):** An irreducible curve of arithmetic genus 2 can have 0, 1, or 2 nodes.\n1.  **0 nodes:** A smooth curve of genus 2. This is the case of \"good reduction\".\n2.  **1 node:** The normalization is a smooth curve of genus 1 (an elliptic curve). This type is stable.\n3.  **2 nodes:** The normalization is a smooth curve of genus 0 (a rational curve, P¹). This type is also stable and appears as a boundary case in the moduli space.\n\n**B) Reducible Curves (more than 1 component):** These are classified by the genera of their components and how they are connected.\n4.  **Two elliptic components:** Two smooth curves of genus 1 meeting at a single node. This configuration is stable.\n5.  **One elliptic and one rational component:** For the overall curve to be stable, the components and their connections must be stable. A valid configuration consists of an elliptic curve meeting a rational curve that has one node on itself (a \"nodal rational curve\"). The two components meet at another point, distinct from the self-intersection. This structure is stable and has arithmetic genus 2.\n6.  **Only rational components:** For a stable curve of arithmetic genus 2 to be composed solely of rational curves, its dual graph (a graph where vertices are components and edges are nodes) must have a first Betti number of 2. For the components to be stable, each must have at least three nodes. The simplest such configuration consists of two rational curves meeting at three distinct nodes.\n\nSumming these up gives a total of 6 distinct types of stable reduction for a genus 2 curve. I will now provide the Python code to output this result.\n\n```python\n# This problem is a question of mathematical classification in algebraic geometry.\n# The number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2 corresponds to the number\n# of combinatorial types of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2.\n\n# The classification based on the structure of the stable curve (number of components, their genera, and their intersections) is as follows:\n\n# 1.
