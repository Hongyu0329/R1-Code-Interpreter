# This problem is a question of mathematical classification in algebraic geometry.
# The number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2 corresponds to the number
# of combinatorial types of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2.

# The classification based on the structure of the stable curve (number of components, their genera, and their intersections) is as follows:

# 1. Irreducible smooth curve of genus 2.
# 2. Irreducible curve with one node (normalization is an elliptic curve).
# 3. Irreducible curve with two nodes (normalization is a rational curve).
# 4. Two elliptic curves intersecting at one node.
# 5. An elliptic curve intersecting a nodal rational curve at one point.
# 6. Two rational curves intersecting at three nodes.

# These are the 6 fundamental types.

num_irreducible_types = 3
num_reducible_types_with_elliptic = 2
num_reducible_types_with_rational_only = 1

total_types = num_irreducible_types + num_reducible_types_with_elliptic + num_reducible_types_with_rational_only

# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted
# as showing the components of the final sum.
print(f"{num_irreducible_types} (irreducible) + {num_reducible_types_with_elliptic} (reducible with elliptic part) + {num_reducible_types_with_rational_only} (reducible with rational parts only) = {total_types}")
print(f"The number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2 is: {total_types}")
