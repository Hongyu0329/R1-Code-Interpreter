    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral to evaluate is `V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1. This integral is a classic form `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`, whose antiderivative is `ln|f(x)|`. In our case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:**\n    The definite integral is evaluated as `[ln|F₃(x)|]` from x=0 to x=1.\n    `V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n    Using the properties of logarithms, this can be written as `V = ln(|F₃(1)| / |F₃(0)|)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate F₃(1):** We need to compute the value of the function `F₃` at `x=1` by following the given definitions:\n    *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n    *   `F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)`\n    *   `F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n4.  **Calculate F₃(0):** Similarly, we compute the value of the function `F₃` at `x=0`:\n    *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n5.  **Calculate V:** Substitute the values of `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` back into the expression for V. Since `sin(1)` is positive, `e^(sin(1))` is greater than 1, making `F₃(1)` positive. `F₃(0) = ln(2)` is also positive. Therefore, the absolute value signs can be removed.\n    *   `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n    *   `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`. We will use a Python script to compute this numerical value.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the functions based on the problem description\ndef F0(x):\n    return x\n\ndef F1(x):\n    return math.sin(F0(x))\n\ndef F2(x):\n    return math.exp(F1(x))\n\ndef F3(x):\n    return math.log(1 + F2(x))\n\n# Step 2: Calculate F3(1) and F3(0)\nf3_at_1 = F3(1)\nf3_at_0 = F3(0)\n\n# The integral V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 evaluates to ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n# since the antiderivative of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln(F₃(x))\nV = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final required value\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(final_value)\n\n# Step 4: Print the results following the required format\n# The final equation is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n# We need to output each number in this equation\nprint(\"The definite integral V is evaluated as ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(2) ≈ {f3_at_0}\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting these values into the formula for V:\")\n# We need to output each number in the final equation: V = ln(f3_at_1) - ln(f3_at_0)\nprint(f\"V = ln({f3_at_1}) - ln({f3_at_0})\")\nprint(f\"V ≈ {V}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe required value is the closest integer to 10000 * V.\")\nprint(f\"10000 * V ≈ 10000 * {V} = {final_value}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {closest_integer}\")\n\n```\n<<<5493>>>"
