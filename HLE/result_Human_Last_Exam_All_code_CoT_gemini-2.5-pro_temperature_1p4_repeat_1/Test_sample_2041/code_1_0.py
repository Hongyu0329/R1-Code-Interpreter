# The number of distinct functions is the number of boolean functions
# of N independent atomic propositions.
# Based on the analysis of shallow expressions, we found that N=4.
N = 4

# The number of boolean functions of N variables is 2^(2^N).
# This is because a function is defined by its truth table. The truth table
# has 2**N rows, and for each row, the output can be one of 2 values (True/False).

# First, calculate the number of rows in the truth table for N variables.
truth_table_rows = 2**N

# Then, calculate the total number of distinct functions.
total_functions = 2**truth_table_rows
