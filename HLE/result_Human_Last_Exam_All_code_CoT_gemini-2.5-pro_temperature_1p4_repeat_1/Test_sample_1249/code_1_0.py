# Part (a): Condition for x^d a * r = 0
# Based on the derivation that the action of x^d on any element s is multiplication by w^d,
# the expression x^d a * r evaluates to w^d * (a * r).
# For this to be zero for all a in A and r in R, the simplest sufficient condition is w^d = 0.
# The parameters q and M in the prompt appear to be superfluous for this part based on direct derivation.

# Part (b): Expression for x^d * r
# Following the derivation x^k * r = w^k * (g^{-k} * r), and using the given g^d = 1,
# we have g^{-d} = (g^d)^{-1} = 1^{-1} = 1.
# Assuming the action of 1 is the identity, 1 * r = r.
# Therefore, the expression for x^d * r is w^d * r.

print("(b) {}".format(b_expression.replace("**","^")))


# Part (c): Can x^j a * r for j >= M be zero?
# The given condition w^M in Z(R) is redundant, as w is already in Z(R).
# This points to a likely typo for a nilpotency condition, w^M = 0.
# Assuming w^M = 0, then for any j >= M, w^j = w^{j-M} * w^M = w^{j-M} * 0 = 0.
# Consequently, x^j a * r = w^j * (a * r) = 0 * (a * r) = 0.
# So, the answer is yes.
