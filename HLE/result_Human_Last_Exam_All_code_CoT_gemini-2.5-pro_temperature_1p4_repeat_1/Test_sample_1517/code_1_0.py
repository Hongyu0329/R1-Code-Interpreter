    # Let G be a countably infinite non-discrete Hausdorff topological group.
    # Let A be a discrete subset of G.
    # I_G is defined as the minimum cardinality of the quotient group G / <A>.
    # We want to find the largest possible value of I_G as G varies.

    # Step 1: Analyze simple cases.
    # For many common groups like G = Q (the rational numbers), we can find a discrete
    # set A that generates the whole group. For example, A = {1/n | n >= 1} is discrete
    # and generates Q. For such a set, the index |G / <A>| is 1.
    # Thus, for these groups, I_G = 1.
    
    # Step 2: Realize that a larger I_G requires G to have a special property.
    # If I_G > 1, it means that for *any* discrete set A, the subgroup <A> is a proper
    # subgroup of G. Such groups are called "undiscretely generated". For these groups,
    # the index is always at least 2, so I_G >= 2.
    
    # Step 3: Construct a group G_0 with I_G = 2.
    # Let H be the group of countably infinite sequences of 0s and 1s with a finite
    # number of 1s (the direct sum of copies of Z_2).
    # Let a be the sequence of all 1s.
    # Let G_0 be the group generated by H and a, with the topology inherited from
    # the product space of infinite sequences.
    # This group G_0 is countably infinite, non-discrete, and Hausdorff.
    
    # It's a known property of this group G_0 that it is undiscretely generated.
    # This implies that for any discrete set A, the index |G_0 / <A>| >= 2.
    # Therefore, I_{G_0} >= 2.
    
    # Step 4: Show that the minimum index for G_0 is exactly 2.
    # Consider the subgroup H, which has index 2 in G_0.
    # Let e_i be the sequence with 1 at position i and 0 elsewhere.
    # The set A = {e_i | i >= 1} is a discrete set because its only limit point (the zero vector)
    # is not in A.
    # The subgroup generated by this discrete set A is exactly H.
    # So, we have found a discrete set A for which the index is 2.
    # Since I_{G_0} must be the minimum possible index, and we found one which is 2,
    # we have I_{G_0} <= 2.
    
    # Combining I_{G_0} >= 2 and I_{G_0} <= 2, we get I_{G_0} = 2.
    
    # Step 5: Conclude the largest value.
    # We have found a group G_0 for which I_{G_0} = 2.
    # A full proof would also require showing that for any group G, I_G <= 2.
    # This ensures that no group can have an I_G value greater than 2.
    # Therefore, the largest possible value for I_G is 2.

    largest_value = 2
