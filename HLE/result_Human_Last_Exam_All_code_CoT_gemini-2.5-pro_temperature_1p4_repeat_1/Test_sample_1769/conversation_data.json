    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to know the Modern English word for \"sister\" under a specific counter-factual condition: no Norse (Viking) invasion or interaction with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries. The answer should be presented through a Python script that explains the reasoning.\n\n2.  **Initial Etymological Research:**\n    *   What is the origin of the current word, \"sister\"? A quick check confirms it comes from Middle English *sister*, which was influenced by the Old Norse word *systir*.\n    *   What word did it influence or replace? The native Old English word was *sweostor*.\n    *   Both the Old Norse *systir* and the Old English *sweostor* trace back to the same Proto-Germanic root, **\\*swestēr*. This is why they are so similar.\n\n3.  **The \"What If\" Scenario:** The core of the task is to trace the development of the native word, *sweostor*, as if the Old Norse *systir* never came into the picture. This means I need to apply the known rules of sound change from Old English to Middle English and then to Modern English.\n\n4.  **Tracing the Linguistic Path:**\n    *   **Old English to Middle English:** How did words with the `eo` diphthong in Old English evolve? The Old English word *sweostor* would undergo a process of phonetic simplification. The most common, natural development of this word, especially in the southern dialects of England (which were less impacted by Norse), was for the `eo` sound to smooth into a `u` sound. This results in the Middle English form *suster*. This form is historically attested and was used concurrently with the Norse-influenced *sister* for some time.\n    *   **Middle English to Modern English:** Now, how would the Middle English word *suster* evolve into Modern English? We need to consider the Great Vowel Shift. The 'u' in *suster* would have been pronounced like the 'oo' in \"foot\" or the 'u' in \"put\" (/ʊ/). During the Great Vowel Shift, this sound typically shifted to /ʌ/, the \"uh\" sound we hear in words like \"cup\", \"but\", and \"sun\". The spelling, however, often remains unchanged from its Middle English form. For example, \"son\" comes from Middle English *sone*, and \"cup\" from *cuppe*. Therefore, the spelling would likely remain *suster*, but the pronunciation would change to sound like \"suster\" with the vowel of \"cup\".\n\n5.  **Formulating the Python Code:** I need to write a Python script to present this explanation.\n    *   The script won't compute anything complex, but will use `print()` statements to lay out the logic clearly.\n    *   I'll use variables to hold the key terms (`old_english_word`, `old_norse_word`, `result_word`) to make the code readable.\n    *   The script will first state the premise, explain the influence of Old Norse, introduce the original Old English word, and then trace its probable development into the final form.\n    *   Finally, as requested, I will output the final answer in the specified `<<<answer>>>` format.\n\nThis thought process directly leads to the Python code below, which walks through the etymological evidence to arrive at the most likely answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_alternate_history_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and determines what the Modern English word for \"sister\"\n    would be if we remove the historical influence of the Old Norse language.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the key words in the etymological history.\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n    old_norse_influence = \"systir\"\n    original_old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    \n    print(\"Investigating the word for 'sister' without Norse influence:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # Step 2: Explain the origin of the current word.\n    print(f\"1. The current Modern English word is '{current_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"2. This word's form is a result of influence from the Old Norse word '{old_norse_influence}',\")\n    print(\"   which was introduced during the Viking Age.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # Step 3: Identify the native word and trace its likely development.\n    print(f\"3. Without that influence, English would have used its native word, which in Old English was '{original_old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"4. Following the natural phonetic changes from Old to Middle English (specifically in southern dialects),\")\n    print(f\"   '{original_old_english_word}' would have simplified and evolved into the word 'suster'.\")\n    print(f\"5. This form, 'suster', was a real word used in Middle English. It would have likely become the standard form.\")\n    print(f\"6. As Middle English evolved into Modern English, the spelling would have remained,\")\n    print(f\"   while the pronunciation of the 'u' would have changed to the 'uh' sound we hear in 'cup' or 'but'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # Step 4: State the final conclusion.\n    hypothetical_modern_word = \"suster\"\n    print(\"Therefore, the Modern English word for 'sister' would most likely be:\")\n    print(hypothetical_modern_word)\n\nfind_alternate_history_word()\n<<<suster>>>\n```"
