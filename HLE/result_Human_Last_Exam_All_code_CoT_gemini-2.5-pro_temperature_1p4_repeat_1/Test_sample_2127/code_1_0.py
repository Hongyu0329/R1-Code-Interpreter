# Based on the analysis, the complex fraction's contribution to the x^4 term is 0.
# The coefficient is determined solely by the first term of the expression.
# The first term is (9 * x**4) / (16 * e).
# The coefficient of x**4 is therefore 9 / (16 * e).

# We use sympy to represent the mathematical constant e.
e = sympy.E
coefficient = 9 / (16 * e)

# Print the resulting coefficient.
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as
# printing the components of the final fraction.
numerator = 9
denominator_part1 = 16
denominator_part2 = e

# Printing the final equation C_4 = 9 / (16 * e)
