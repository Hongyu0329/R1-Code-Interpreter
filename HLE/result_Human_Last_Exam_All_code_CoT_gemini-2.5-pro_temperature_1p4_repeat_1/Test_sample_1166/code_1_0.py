    # Definition of Lebesgue Integrable:
    # A function f is Lebesgue integrable if and only if:
    # 1. f is a measurable function.
    # 2. The integral of its absolute value is finite: ∫|f| dμ < ∞.
    # A general domain of R with the standard Lebesgue measure is assumed
    # unless a specific interval like [a,b] or (a,b) is given.
