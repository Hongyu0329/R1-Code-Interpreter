    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of distinct orbits of the set of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R=\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ under the action of the group of invertible linear transformations $GL_2(R)$.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables is a polynomial of the form $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are elements of $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. Each form can be represented by a tuple of its coefficients $(a, b, c)$. Since each coefficient can take any of the 8 values in $R$, there are $8^3 = 512$ such quadratic forms in total.\n\nTwo quadratic forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are considered equivalent if there is an invertible linear transformation $T$ such that $Q_2(v) = Q_1(T v)$ for all vectors $v=(x,y)$. Such transformations are represented by $2 \\times 2$ matrices $P$ with entries in $R$, where the determinant $\\det(P)$ is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. The set of all such matrices forms the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe action of a matrix $P = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\\\ p_{21} & p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$ on a form $Q=(a,b,c)$ yields a new form $Q'=(a',b',c')$, whose coefficients can be calculated by substituting $x = p_{11}x' + p_{12}y'$ and $y = p_{21}x' + p_{22}y'$ into $Q(x,y)$.\n\nA direct computational approach is feasible. The plan is as follows:\n1.  Generate all $8^3 = 512$ possible quadratic forms $(a,b,c)$.\n2.  Generate the group of invertible matrices, $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n3.  An important property called the discriminant, $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\pmod 8$, is invariant for all forms within an equivalence class. We can group the forms by their discriminant value.\n4.  For each group of forms sharing the same discriminant, we will count the number of equivalence classes (orbits). We iterate through each form in the group. If it hasn't been visited yet, we count it as a representative of a new class, and then find all other forms in its orbit by applying every matrix in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$. We mark all forms in the orbit as visited.\n5.  The total number of classes is the sum of the counts from each discriminant group.\n\nThe following Python code implements this algorithm to find the number of equivalence classes.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_quadratic_form_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Generate the group GL(2, Z/8Z)\n    gl2_z8 = []\n    units = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n    for p11 in range(8):\n        for p12 in range(8):\n            for p21 in range(8):\n                for p22 in range(8):\n                    det = (p11 * p22 - p12 * p21) % 8\n                    if det in units:\n                        gl2_z8.append(((p11, p12), (p21, p22)))\n\n    # Step 2: Define the action of GL(2, Z/8Z) on a quadratic form\n    def apply_transform(q, p):\n        a, b, c = q\n        (p11, p12), (p21, p22) = p\n        \n        a_prime = (a * p11**2 + b * p11 * p21 + c * p21**2) % 8\n        c_prime = (a * p12**2 + b * p12 * p22 + c * p22**2) % 8\n        b_prime = (2 * a * p11 * p12 + b * (p11 * p22 + p12 * p21) + 2 * c * p21 * p22) % 8\n        \n        return (a_prime, b_prime, c_prime)\n\n    # Step 3: Group all 512 forms by their discriminant\n    forms_by_discriminant = collections.defaultdict(list)\n    for a in range(8):\n        for b in range(8):\n            for c in range(8):\n                q = (a, b, c)\n                delta = (b**2 - 4 * a * c) % 8\n                forms_by_discriminant[delta].append(q)\n\n    # Step 4: Count classes for each discriminant\n    class_counts = {}\n    total_classes = 0\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing equivalence classes based on discriminant:\")\n    \n    # Sort discriminants for consistent output order\n    sorted_discriminants = sorted(forms_by_discriminant.keys())\n\n    for delta in sorted_discriminants:\n        forms_in_group = forms_by_discriminant[delta]\n        visited_forms = set()\n        num_classes_for_delta = 0\n        \n        for q in forms_in_group:\n            if q in visited_forms:\n                continue\n            \n            num_classes_for_delta += 1\n            \n            # Find the orbit of q\n            orbit = {apply_transform(q, p) for p in gl2_z8}\n            visited_forms.update(orbit)\n            \n        class_counts[delta] = num_classes_for_delta\n        print(f\"Number of classes with discriminant {delta}: {num_classes_for_delta}\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Sum the results\n    total_classes = sum(class_counts.values())\n    \n    equation_parts = [str(c) for c in class_counts.values()]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Total number of classes = {equation_str} = {total_classes}\")\n\nsolve_quadratic_form_classes()\n```\n<<<54>>>"
