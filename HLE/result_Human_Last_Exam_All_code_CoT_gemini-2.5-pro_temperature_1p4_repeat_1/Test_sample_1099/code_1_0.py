    # --- Introduction ---
    print("The problem of simulating quantum correlations from a singlet state with a Local Hidden Variable (LHV) model requires additional resources.")

    # --- Key Calculation ---
    # The amount of "non-locality" to be simulated corresponds to the maximum quantum
    # violation of the CHSH inequality. This value, when normalized by the non-locality
    # of a single PR-box, gives the required number of PR-boxes if communication is not used.
    # Max quantum CHSH value = 2 * sqrt(2)
    # Max classical CHSH value = 2
    # Max PR-Box CHSH value = 4
    # The required resource 'k' = (2*sqrt(2) - 2) / (4 - 2) = sqrt(2) - 1.
    k = math.sqrt(2) - 1

    # The simulation can be achieved perfectly at two extreme points:
    comm_only_C = 1.0
    comm_only_N = 0.0

    pr_box_only_C = 0.0

    print(f"   - Average PR-Boxes (N): sqrt(2) - 1 â‰ˆ {pr_box_only_N:.8f}\n")

    # --- Final Trade-off Equation ---
    # The trade-off between C and N is a line connecting the two points (1, 0) and (0, k).
    # The equation for this line is C/1 + N/k = 1.
