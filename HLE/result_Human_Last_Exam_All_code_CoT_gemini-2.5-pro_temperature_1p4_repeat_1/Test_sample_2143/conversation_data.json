    "Based on the clues provided, I will deduce the identity of the person referred to as \"HE\".\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues**: The prompt contains several key phrases:\n    *   \"prohibition against representation\": This is a direct reference to the Second Commandment in the Abrahamic traditions, which forbids the creation of graven images or idols.\n    *   \"another's material possessions\": This points to the Tenth Commandment, which warns against coveting a neighbor's property.\n    *   \"at the end of HIS work\": The Ten Commandments, or the Decalogue, is a foundational part of this person's work. The commandment against coveting is the last one.\n    *   \"HE\": The historical and religious figure who received these commandments from God on Mount Sinai.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Information**: The figure who connects the Ten Commandments, including the prohibitions on graven images and coveting, is universally recognized as Moses.\n\n3.  **Plan the Code**: I will write a simple Python script that stores the name \"Moses\" in a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\n```python\n# The riddle describes the person who received the Ten Commandments.\n# \"prohibition against representation\" = The Second Commandment (against idols).\n# \"another's material possessions\" = The Tenth Commandment (against coveting).\n# The lawgiver who received these is Moses.\nhis_full_name = \"Moses\"\n\n# This will print the final answer.\nprint(his_full_name)\n```\n<<<Moses>>>"
