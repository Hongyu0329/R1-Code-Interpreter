    "Here is a step-by-step phonetic transcription of the English term \"shock absorber\" into Puerto Rican Spanish, based on its phonological rules.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Source Word:** Start with the English word \"shock absorber\" and its standard pronunciation.\n2.  **Simplify for Borrowing:** Recognize that loanwords are often shortened or simplified. \"Shock absorber\" is commonly contracted to a form like \"chosorber\".\n3.  **Apply Phonological Rules:** Apply the specific, prominent sound changes from Puerto Rican Spanish to this simplified form, syllable by syllable.\n    *   **Rule 1: \"sh\" to \"ch\"**: The English /ʃ/ sound (sh) becomes the Spanish /tʃ/ sound (ch).\n    *   **Rule 2: Syllable-Final \"s\" Aspiration**: An \"s\" at the end of a syllable is pronounced as a soft puff of air, like an English \"h\".\n    *   **Rule 3: \"r\" Lateralization**: An \"r\" at the end of a syllable is frequently pronounced as an \"l\".\n    *   **Rule 4: \"b\" Frication**: A \"b\" sound between two vowels softens to a fricative sound, represented by [β].\n4.  **Assemble the Final Transcription:** Combine the transformed sounds to create the final phonetic representation.\n\n```python\ndef transcribe_to_puerto_rican_spanish():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and constructs the phonetic transcription for\n    the English borrowing \"shock absorber\" in Puerto Rican Spanish.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: The original English word is 'shock absorber', pronounced roughly as /ʃɑk əbˈsɔɹbɚ/.\")\n    print(\"Step 2: When borrowed into Spanish, it's commonly shortened and blended into a single word like 'chosorber'.\")\n    print(\"\\nApplying the phonological rules of Puerto Rican Spanish to 'chosorber':\\n\")\n\n    # Breaking down the word into its phonetically relevant parts for transformation\n    part1 = \"'cho-'\"\n    part2 = \"'-s-'\"\n    part3 = \"'-or-'\"\n    part4 = \"'-ber'\"\n\n    # Applying rules to each part\n    result1_char = \"tʃo\"\n    result1_explanation = \"(The 'sh' sound /ʃ/ becomes 'ch' /tʃ/, and the vowel 'o' is used).\"\n\n    result2_char = \"h\"\n    result2_explanation = \"(Syllable-final 's' is aspirated, sounding like an 'h').\"\n\n    result3_char = \"ol\"\n    result3_explanation = \"(The 'r' in 'or' is at the end of a syllable, so it is lateralized to an 'l').\"\n\n    result4_char = \"ˈβel\"\n    result4_explanation = \"(The 'b' is between vowels, so it softens to [β].
