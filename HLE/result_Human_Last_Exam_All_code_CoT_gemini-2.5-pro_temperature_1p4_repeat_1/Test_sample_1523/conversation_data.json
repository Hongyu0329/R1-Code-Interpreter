    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I will lay out the theoretical framework for the problem.\n1.  **Start with the Partition Function:** The core of statistical mechanics and quantum field theory at finite temperature is the partition function `Z`. For a scalar field `ϕ`, it's represented by a functional integral `Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S[ϕ])`, where `S[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action.\n2.  **Define the Euclidean Action:** For a free (non-interacting) neutral scalar field, the Euclidean action `S[ϕ]` is the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density over spacetime: `S[ϕ] = ∫ d⁴x_E [1/2 (∂_μ ϕ)² + 1/2 m² ϕ²]`.\n3.  **Rewrite the Action:** I will use integration by parts to rewrite the action into a quadratic form, `S[ϕ] = 1/2 ∫ d⁴x_E ϕ(x) D ϕ(x)`. This process will reveal the explicit form of the operator `D`.\n4.  **Identify the Inner Product:** The general form `S[ϕ] = 1/2 (ϕ, Dϕ)` allows us to identify the definition of the inner product `(f, g)` and the operator `D`.\n5.  **Formulate the final expression:** Based on the previous steps, I will construct the final expression for `(ϕ, Dϕ)`.\n\nFinally, I will write a Python script to print out this derivation and the final expression. The script will also explicitly identify and print the numbers (`4` for the dimension and `2` for the power of the mass term) that appear in the symbolic formula, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_field_theory_inner_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the inner product (ϕ, Dϕ)\n    in the context of finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define the components of the expression ---\n    integral_symbol = \"∫\"\n    spacetime_measure = \"d⁴x_E\"\n    field_phi = \"ϕ(x)\"\n    operator_D = \"(-□_E + m²)\"\n    inner_product_expression = f\"{integral_symbol} {spacetime_measure} {field_phi} {operator_D} {field_phi}\"\n\n    # --- Step 2: Provide the derivation ---\n    print(\"Derivation of the inner product (ϕ, Dϕ):\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"1.
