# Task: Identify two languages, 'a' and 'b', based on a set of linguistic clues.

# Reasoning for Language 'a':
# 1. The language is currently in use and officially recognized.
# 2. The orthography lacks the letters 'k' and 'w'.
# 3. The letter 'à' is present.
# These clues strongly point to Italian. The standard Italian alphabet excludes 'k' and 'w',
# and the grave accent ('à') is a common feature.
language_a = "Italian"

# Reasoning for Language 'b':
# 1. The language is currently in use and officially recognized.
# 2. The letter combinations "ggj" and "skt" are very widely used.
# This points to Northern Sámi. The consonant gradation system in this language
# results in complex and frequent consonant clusters like "ggj" (e.g., in "loggjelit")
# and "skt" (e.g., in "okskat"). It is a recognized minority language in several Nordic countries.
language_b = "Northern Sámi"

# Print the final answer
print("Based on the clues provided:")
print(f"Language a is: {language_a}")
print(f"Language b is: {language_b}")
