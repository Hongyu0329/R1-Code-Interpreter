    "To determine the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Noble Gases:** List all naturally occurring noble gases: Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n2.  **Gather Abundance Data:** Find the abundance of each gas. The vast majority of these gases are found in the atmosphere, so atmospheric concentration is an excellent proxy for overall rarity. The relative abundances have not changed significantly since 2002.\n3.  **Include Radon:** Radon is a noble gas, but it is radioactive with a short half-life. It is formed from the decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. Its concentration is extremely low and often cited separately, but for the purpose of identifying the \"rarest,\" it must be included. Its atmospheric abundance is many orders of magnitude lower than any other noble gas.\n4.  **Create a Script:** Write a Python script to store these abundance percentages in a dictionary.\n5.  **Compare and Find the Minimum:** The script will print the percentage of each noble gas for comparison and then programmatically find the one with the minimum percentage.\n6.  **Output the Result:** The script will print the name of the rarest noble gas and its approximate percentage in the atmosphere.\n\n```python\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the rarest noble gas on Earth by comparing their\n    abundances as a percentage of volume in the atmosphere. These values are\n    a reliable proxy for overall rarity as the atmosphere is the primary\n    reservoir for these elements. The abundances for 2002 are effectively\n    the same as today's values for this comparison.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary of noble gases and their abundance in Earth's atmosphere (in percent).\n    # Radon's value is an estimate based on its typical atomic fraction.\n    abundances_percent = {\n        \"Helium\": 0.000524,\n        \"Neon\": 0.001818,\n        \"Argon\": 0.934,\n        \"Krypton\": 0.000114,\n        \"Xenon\": 0.0000087,\n        \"Radon\": 6e-18 # (approx. 6.0 x 10^-18 %)\n    }\n\n    print(\"To find the rarest noble gas, we compare their percentages in Earth's atmosphere:\")\n    # The 'equation' is the comparison of all the values to find the minimum.\n    # The following lines output each number involved in this comparison.\n    for gas, percentage in abundances_percent.items():\n        print(f\"{gas}: {percentage:.2e} %\")\n\n    # Find the gas with the minimum percentage\n    rarest_gas = min(abundances_percent, key=abundances_percent.get)\n    min_percentage = abundances_percent[rarest_gas]\n\n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(f\"The calculation shows that the gas with the lowest percentage is {rarest_gas}.\")\n    print(f\"The final answer is that the rarest noble gas is {rarest_gas} with a percentage of approximately {min_percentage:.2e} %.\")\n\n\nfind_rarest_noble_gas()\n```\n<<<Radon>>>"
