    "My plan is to identify the major rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid, find their modern-day lengths, and then programmatically determine the three longest ones.\n\n1.  **Data Collection:** I will compile a list of rivers explicitly mentioned in the Aeneid, such as the Nile, Tiber, Rhine, Danube (Ister), and Euphrates. Many of these are found in the description of Aeneas's shield in Book VIII, which depicts the future triumphs of Rome over distant peoples.\n2.  **Length Association:** I will associate each river with its approximate length in kilometers based on current geographical data.\n3.  **Sorting and Selection:** I will use a Python script to store this data in a suitable structure (like a dictionary or a list of tuples). The script will then sort these rivers in descending order based on their length.\n4.  **Output:** Finally, the script will select the top three rivers from the sorted list and print their names and lengths, providing the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport operator\n\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n\n    The script contains a dictionary of major rivers mentioned in the text\n    and their approximate modern lengths.
