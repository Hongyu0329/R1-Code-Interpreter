    This function solves the problem about the number of totally bounded group topologies on the integers
    with no nontrivial convergent sequences.

    The argument proceeds as follows:
    1.  The totally bounded group topologies on the integers (Z) are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of the circle group T. Let's denote the topology corresponding to a subgroup H by tau_H.

    2.  The condition "no nontrivial convergent sequences" means that the only integer sequence k_n that converges to 0 in this topology is the one that is eventually zero. Convergence k_n -> 0 in tau_H means that for every alpha in H, the sequence k_n * alpha (mod 1) converges to 0.

    3.  Consider the Bohr topology on Z, which corresponds to the case where H = T (the whole circle group). It can be shown that this topology has no nontrivial convergent sequences.
        - Assume a sequence of non-zero integers k_n converges to 0. This implies that for every alpha in T, k_n * alpha (mod 1) -> 0.
        - This means the sequence of group homomorphisms phi_n: T -> T defined by phi_n(alpha) = k_n * alpha converges pointwise to the zero homomorphism.
        - Since T is compact, pointwise convergence of homomorphisms to a continuous homomorphism implies uniform convergence.
        - So, for any epsilon > 0, there exists N such that for all n > N and for all alpha in T, the distance from k_n * alpha to the nearest integer is less than epsilon.
        - But for any k_n != 0, we can choose alpha = 1 / (2 * k_n). For this alpha, the distance is exactly 1/2.
        - This leads to the contradiction 1/2 < epsilon for an arbitrarily small epsilon.
        - Thus, the Bohr topology has no nontrivial convergent sequences. This means there is at least one such topology.

    4.  The Bohr topology is the finest possible totally bounded group topology on Z. Any other such topology, tau_H, corresponds to a proper subgroup H of T and is thus coarser than the Bohr topology.
        A key result in the theory of topological groups states that the Bohr topology is the *coarsest* totally bounded group topology on Z with no nontrivial convergent sequences.

    5.  Let tau be such a topology. It must be coarser than or equal to the Bohr topology. It must also be finer than or equal to the Bohr topology (by the cited result). Therefore, it must be equal to the Bohr topology.

    This proves that there is exactly one such topology.
