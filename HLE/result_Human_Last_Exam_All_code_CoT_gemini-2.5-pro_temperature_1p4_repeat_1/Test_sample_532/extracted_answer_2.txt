Based on the analysis that the problem likely intends to ask which groups are "e-covered" (i.e., the union of maximal product-free sets is G \ {e}), the answer is that all finite nilpotent groups have this property. This is a consequence of more general theorems stating that all finite groups (both cyclic and non-cyclic) are e-covered. Therefore, the set of finite filled nilpotent groups (under this corrected definition) is the set of all finite nilpotent groups.
