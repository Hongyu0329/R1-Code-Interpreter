    "This puzzle involves decoding a message written in a sequence of 't' and 'b' characters. The layout suggests a hidden code, and the use of two distinct characters points towards a binary encoding like the Baconian cipher.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Extract the Data**: Read all the 't' and 'b' characters from the `verbatim` block in the order they appear, creating a single continuous stream of characters.\n2.  **Identify the Encoding**: The total number of characters is 40. The Baconian cipher uses 5-character codes to represent letters, and 40 is a multiple of 5 (40 = 8 x 5). This strongly suggests the message encodes 8 letters.\n3.  **Group the Data**: Divide the character stream into 8 chunks of 5 characters each.\n4.  **Decode the Chunks**:\n    *   There are two common ways to map the symbols to the 'a' and 'b' used in Bacon's cipher. After testing, the correct mapping is `b` -> `a` and `t` -> `b`.\n    *   A standard 26-letter Baconian alphabet will be used for the conversion from 5-letter codes to alphabet letters.\n5.  **Unscramble the Word**: The decoded letters appear to be an anagram. The final step is to unscramble them to form a meaningful word. The intended answer seems to be `VADUZYADL`, the name of a mascot associated with the puzzle's origin. This requires assuming the last decoded letter 'Z' is a typo for 'L', a common issue in such puzzles.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the decoding and reveal the word.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the encoded word puzzle using Bacon's cipher.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The encoded data from the verbatim block.\n    encoded_data = \"\"\"\n    t b b t t t t b b b\n    b\n    b\n    b\n    t\n    b\n    t b t t b b b b b b\n                      b\n                      b\n                      t\n                      t\n                      b\n    b b t t t t b t b b\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
