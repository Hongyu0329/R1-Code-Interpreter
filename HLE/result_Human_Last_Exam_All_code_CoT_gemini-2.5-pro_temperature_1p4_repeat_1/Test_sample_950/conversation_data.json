    "To find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the space**: The space of $3$-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $Gr(3, 5)$. It is diffeomorphic to $Gr(2, 5)$. The dimension of this manifold is $d = k(n-k) = 3 \\times (5-3) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Determine cohomology dimensions over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$**: The dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^i(Gr(k, n); \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$, denoted $d_i$, are given by the coefficients of the PoincarÃ© polynomial. This polynomial is the q-binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}_q$. For $Gr(3, 5)$, this is $\\binom{5}{3}_q = \\frac{(1-q^5)(1-q^4)}{(1-q)(1-q^2)} = 1+q+2q^2+2q^3+2q^4+q^5+q^6$.\n    So, $d_i = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)$ for $i=0, \\dots, 6$.\n\n3.  **Relate different cohomology/homology groups**: We use the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT). Let $\\beta_i$ be the $i$-th Betti number (rank of the free part of $H_i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$), and let $\\tau_i$ be the rank of the 2-torsion subgroup of $H_i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. The dimensions $d_i$ are related by the formula: $d_i = \\beta_i + \\tau_i + \\tau_{i-1}$.\n    Furthermore, the rank of the 2-torsion in cohomology, $t_j$, is related to homology torsion by $t_j = \\tau_{j-1}$.\n\n4.  **Use known topological properties of $Gr(3,5)$**:\n    *   For a connected space, $\\beta_0=1$ and $\\tau_0=0$.\n    *   The fundamental group $\\pi_1(Gr(3,5))$ is $\\mathbb{Z}/2$. By Hurewicz theorem, $H_1(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2$. This means $\\beta_1=0$ and $\\tau_1=1$.\n    *   $Gr(3,5)$ is a non-orientable manifold since $n=5$ is odd. For a non-orientable manifold of dimension $d=6$, the top Betti number is zero, so $\\beta_6=0$.\n\n5.  **Solve for torsion ranks**: We have a system of equations. We will solve for the unknown $\\beta_i$ and $\\tau_i$ values. The required answer is the sum of cohomology torsion ranks, $\\sum t_j = \\sum \\tau_{j-1}$.\n\nHere is the Python code that carries out this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_grassmannian_torsion():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\n    of the Grassmannian Gr(3, 5).\n    \"\"\"\n    k = 3\n    n = 5\n    dim = k * (n - k)\n    print(f\"The space is the Grassmannian Gr({k}, {n}) of dimension {dim}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Dimensions of mod 2 cohomology from q-binomial coefficient\n    # (1-q^5)(1-q^4)/((1-q)(1-q^2)) = (1+q+q^2+q^3+q^4)(1+q^2)\n    # = 1 + q + 2q^2 + 2q^3 + 2q^4 + q^5 + q^6\n    d = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine dimensions of H^i(Gr(3,5); Z/2Z)\")\n    for i, val in enumerate(d):\n        print(f\"d_{i} = dim H^{i}(Gr(3,5); Z/2Z) = {val}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Initialize arrays for Betti numbers and homology torsion ranks\n    beta = [-1] * (dim + 1)\n    tau = [-1] * (dim + 1)\n    \n    # Step 2: Apply topological constraints\n    print(\"Step 2: Apply known topological properties as constraints\")\n    # For any connected space\n    beta[0] = 1\n    tau[0] = 0\n    print(f\"From general properties of connected spaces: beta_0 = {beta[0]}, tau_0 = {tau[0]}\")\n    \n    # From pi_1(Gr(3,5)) = Z/2\n    beta[1] = 0\n    tau[1] = 1\n    print(f\"From H_1(Gr(3,5); Z) = Z/2: beta_1 = {beta[1]}, tau_1 = {tau[1]}\")\n\n    # From non-orientability of Gr(3,5) (n=5 is odd)\n    beta[dim] = 0\n    print(f\"From non-orientability of Gr(3,5): beta_{dim} = {beta[dim]}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Solve the system of equations d_i = beta_i + tau_i + tau_{i-1}\n    print(\"Step 3: Solve the system of equations d_i = beta_i + tau_i + tau_{i-1}\")\n\n    # Equation for i = 2\n    # d_2 = beta_2 + tau_2 + tau_1 => 2 = beta_2 + tau_2 + 1 => beta_2 + tau_2 = 1\n    # This implies (beta_2, tau_2) is (1,0) or (0,1).\n    # From the theory of Stiefel-Whitney and Pontryagin classes, it is known that\n    # H^2(Gr(2,5); Z) has torsion, but H^3(Gr(2,5); Z) also has torsion.\n    # The rank of torsion in cohomology is t_j = tau_{j-1}.\n    # So t_3 = tau_2 must be > 0.
