    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$, we can follow a systematic computational approach.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The problem asks for the number of ordered 5-tuples of non-negative integers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that satisfy the given equation.\n\n2.  **Strategy:** A direct brute-force search over five nested loops would be too slow. A more efficient strategy is to first find all unique *sets* of five non-negative integers $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$ whose squares sum to 2024. Then, for each unique set, we calculate the number of distinct ordered tuples (permutations) that can be formed from its elements.\n\n3.  **Finding Unordered Sets:** To find the unique sets efficiently and without duplicates, we can search for solutions under an ordering constraint, for example, $x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge x_3 \\ge x_4 \\ge x_5 \\ge 0$. This is achieved using nested loops where the range of each subsequent variable is limited by the value of the previous variable and the remaining sum. The maximum value for any $x_i$ is $\\lfloor\\sqrt{2024}\\rfloor = 44$.\n\n4.  **Calculating Permutations:** For each unordered set found, say $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$, we need to count how many distinct ordered tuples can be formed. This is a permutation with repetition problem. The number of permutations is given by the formula $\\frac{5!}{n_1! n_2! \\ldots n_k!}$, where $k$ is the number of distinct values in the set and $n_i$ is the frequency of each distinct value. For example, for the set `{a, a, b, c, c}`, the number of permutations is $\\frac{5!}{2! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 2!} = 30$.\n\n5.  **Summing Up:** The total number of solutions is the sum of the permutation counts for all unique unordered sets found.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It will:\n-   Search for all unique unordered solution sets.\n-   For each set, it will print the set itself, the corresponding equation, and the number of permutations it contributes to the total count.\n-   Finally, it will print the total number of solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_diophantine_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n    x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(target))\n    \n    # Pre-calculate squares for performance improvement\n    squares = [i*i for i in range(limit + 1)]\n    \n    # Use a set to store unique unordered solutions (as sorted tuples)\n    solution_sets = set()\n\n    # Find solutions with the constraint x1 >= x2 >= x3 >= x4 >= x5 >= 0\n    # This avoids finding duplicate sets and speeds up the search.\n    for i1 in range(limit, -1, -1):\n        s1 = squares[i1]\n        \n        limit2 = int(math.sqrt(target - s1))\n        for i2 in range(min(i1, limit2), -1, -1):\n            s2 = squares[i2]\n            \n            limit3 = int(math.sqrt(target - s1 - s2))\n            for i3 in range(min(i2, limit3), -1, -1):\n                s3 = squares[i3]\n\n                limit4 = int(math.sqrt(target - s1 - s2 - s3))\n                for i4 in range(min(i3, limit4), -1, -1):\n                    s4 = squares[i4]\n                    \n                    remaining_sum = target - (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4)\n                    \n                    # The value for x5^2 must be non-negative.\n                    if remaining_sum >= 0:\n                        i5 = int(math.sqrt(remaining_sum))\n                        \n                        # Check if remaining_sum is a perfect square and ordering is maintained\n                        if squares[i5] == remaining_sum and i5 <= i4:\n                            solution_tuple = (i1, i2, i3, i4, i5)\n                            solution_sets.add(solution_tuple)\n\n    total_solutions = 0\n    fact5 = math.factorial(5)\n\n    print(f\"Finding non-negative integer solutions for x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 + x5^2 = {target}\\n\")\n    print(\"Found the following unique solution sets (and their permutations):\\n\")\n\n    # Sort sets for deterministic output\n    sorted_sets = sorted(list(solution_sets), reverse=True)\n\n    for sol_set in sorted_sets:\n        # Count frequency of each number in the set\n        counts = Counter(sol_set)\n        denominator = 1\n        for count in counts.values():\n            denominator *= math.factorial(count)\n        \n        num_perms = fact5 // denominator\n        total_solutions += num_perms\n        \n        # Output the numbers in the equation\n        squares_str = [f\"{x}^2\" for x in sol_set]\n        values_str = [f\"{x*x}\" for x in sol_set]\n        \n        print(f\"Solution Set: {sol_set}\")\n        print(f\"Equation: {' + '.join(squares_str)} = {' + '.join(values_str)} = {target}\")\n        print(f\"Number of distinct permutations: {num_perms}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Total number of non-negative integer solutions: {total_solutions}\")\n    return total_solutions\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    final_answer = solve_diophantine_equation()\n    print(f\"\\n<<< {final_answer} >>>\")\n\n```\n<<<4360>>>"
