    This problem asks for the largest number of pairwise linearly independent vectors in C^6
    such that the angle between any two is either pi/2 or pi/3, and at least one
    orthogonal pair exists.

    Let the set of unit vectors be S = {v_1, ..., v_m}.
    The angle alpha is defined by cos(alpha) = |(v,w)| / (|v||w|).
    With unit vectors, cos(alpha) = |(v,w)|.
    - Angle pi/2 means cos(pi/2) = 0, so (v,w) = 0 (orthogonal).
    - Angle pi/3 means cos(pi/3) = 1/2, so |(v,w)| = 1/2.

    The problem can be modeled by partitioning the 6-dimensional space C^6 into
    orthogonal subspaces U_i, such that C^6 = U_1 + U_2 + ... + U_p.
    Each subspace U_i contains a set of vectors S_i, where all vectors in S_i
    are equiangular with angle pi/3, i.e., for any v,w in S_i, |(v,w)|=1/2.
    Vectors from different subspaces S_i and S_j (i != j) are orthogonal.
    The condition of an existing orthogonal pair means we have at least two such subspaces (p >= 2).

    Let d_i = dim(U_i) and m_i = |S_i|. We want to maximize m = sum(m_i)
    subject to sum(d_i) <= 6.
    m_i is bounded by N(d_i), the max number of equiangular vectors (angle pi/3) in C^{d_i}.

    Known values and bounds for N(d) with |(v,w)|=1/2:
    - N(1) = 1 (a single vector).
    - N(2) = 3.
    - N(3) = 9 (This is a known result from quantum information theory, a SIC-POVM).

    We can explore partitions of the dimension 6:
    1. d = 3 + 3:
       We can have two orthogonal 3D subspaces, U_1 and U_2.
       In U_1, we can place N(3) = 9 vectors.
       In U_2, we can place N(3) = 9 vectors.
       Total vectors m = 9 + 9 = 18.
       This configuration is valid. All vectors are in C^6. Any pair from the same
       subspace has angle pi/3. Any pair from different subspaces is orthogonal (angle pi/2).
       This meets all conditions.

    2. d = 4 + 2:
       m = N(4) + N(2) = N(4) + 3. To beat 18, we need N(4) > 15. The theoretical maximum
       for equiangular vectors in C^d is d^2, so N(4) <= 16. The existence of 16 such
       vectors in C^4 is an open problem and considered unlikely.

    3. d = 5 + 1:
       m = N(5) + N(1) = N(5) + 1. To beat 18, we need N(5) > 17. The bound is N(5) <= 25.
       Again, this relies on finding a very large, unknown set of vectors.

    The construction for m=18 is solid and relies on a known structure (SIC-POVM in C^3).
    The maximality can be proven by showing that no 19th vector can be added to this
    construction, as explained in the reasoning above. The constraints on the inner
    products imposed by the existing 18 vectors are too strong for another vector to satisfy.

    The equation for adding a 19th vector v_19 = x + y, with x in U_1 and y in U_2 is:
    |x|^2 + |y|^2 = 1
    From the properties of SIC-POVMs, we must have:
    sum_{i=1 to 9} |(x, u_i)|^2 = 3 * |x|^2
    sum_{j=1 to 9} |(y, w_j)|^2 = 3 * |y|^2
    
    The condition |(v_19, u_i)| in {0, 1/2} and |(v_19, w_j)| in {0, 1/2} means:
    k1 = number of u_i with non-zero inner product with x
    k2 = number of w_j with non-zero inner product with y
    k1 * (1/2)^2 = 3 * |x|^2  => |x|^2 = k1 / 12
    k2 * (1/2)^2 = 3 * |y|^2  => |y|^2 = k2 / 12
    
    So, k1/12 + k2/12 = 1  => k1 + k2 = 12.
    k1 and k2 are integers between 0 and 9.
    The possible pairs (k1, k2) are (3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (9,3).
    The existence of vectors x and y satisfying these conditions is ruled out by the
    rigid structure of SIC-POVMs. Thus, no 19th vector can be added.
