# Step 1 & 2: Analyze the process and select a proxy formula.
# The specified process e⁻ + ν̄ₑ → μ⁻ + ν̄μ violates lepton family number conservation
# and is forbidden in the Standard Model. For this calculation, we assume the process
# can occur and use a well-established formula for a similar weak interaction that
# correctly models the production of a massive muon near the energy threshold.
# We will use the formula for the total cross-section of inverse muon decay
# (ν_μ + e⁻ → μ⁻ + ν_e), which neglects the electron mass.

# Step 3: State the formula.
# The formula for the cross-section (σ) is: σ = (G_F² * (s - m_μ²)²) / (π * s)

# Step 4: Implement the calculation with the given values.
G_F = 1.0
m_mu = 1.0
m_e = 1.0  # Note: The electron mass is neglected in the chosen formula.
s = 2.0

# Value of pi from the math library
pi = math.pi

# Calculation
numerator = (G_F**2) * ((s - m_mu**2)**2)
denominator = pi * s
sigma = numerator / denominator

# Step 5: Format and print the output.
