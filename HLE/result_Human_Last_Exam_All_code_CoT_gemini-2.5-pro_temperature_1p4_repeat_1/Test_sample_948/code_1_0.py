    # Property 2: Does the particle number go to zero?
    # No. The quantum Zeno effect protects the system from complete decay.
    # The system is projected into a "dark state" subspace with no doubly-occupied sites,
    # leading to a stable many-body state with non-zero particles.

    # Property 3: Are there losses in the final state?
    # No. The final state, by construction, has no doubly-occupied sites.
    # The loss rate is proportional to the number of doublons, which is now zero.

    # Properties 5 & 6: What are the spin correlations?
    # Ferromagnetic |up, up> alignment is protected by Pauli exclusion.
    # Anti-ferromagnetic |up, down> alignment is penalized because hopping can
    # create a doublon, leading to loss. The system favors FM correlations.

    # Property 1: Is there tunneling in the final state?
    # The system reaches a steady state. In a steady state, there are no net particle
    # currents. Since tunneling drives these currents, the expectation value of
    # the current operator is zero. We interpret "Zero tunneling" in this sense.
    analysis[1] = True

    # Property 4: Is there spin entanglement?

    # dissipative process. Such states are generally entangled and not simple
    # product states.
