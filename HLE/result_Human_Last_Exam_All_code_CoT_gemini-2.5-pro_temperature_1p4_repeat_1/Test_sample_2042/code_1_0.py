    # The chosen option is D. Here's the reasoning presented step-by-step.
    reasoning_steps = {
        "Step 1: Evaluate the core problem": "A high-pressure mechanical device (stapler) has failed while clamped on delicate tissue (the base of the appendix, near the cecum).",
        "Step 2: Consider the options involving force (B, C, E)": "Attempting to pry the stapler open, whether laparoscopically or through a larger incision, is highly dangerous. It risks an uncontrolled tear of the appendix or cecum, which could lead to major bleeding and contamination of the abdomen with stool. This approach is unpredictable and unsafe.",
        "Step 3: Consider the option of re-stapling (A)": "Stapling again to resect the appendix along with a piece of the cecum is poor surgical practice. It does not solve the primary problem of the stuck stapler and creates a new, more significant problem by unnecessarily removing part of the large intestine, increasing the risk of a leak from the cecal staple line.",
        "Step 4: Consider converting to an open procedure (D, F)": "When a laparoscopic procedure becomes unsafe or an instrument fails catastrophically, the safest course of action is to convert to an open surgery. This allows for direct vision, manual control, and a safe resolution.",
        "Step 5: Choose the best incision for conversion": "Option D suggests extending the existing port site, while Option F suggests a new midline incision. Extending the port site used for the stapler is the most direct and least morbid approach. It turns the port into a small, targeted open incision (a mini-laparotomy) exactly where it is needed. A new midline incision is significantly more invasive and unnecessary.",
        "Conclusion": "Therefore, extending the port of the stapler into a longer incision and then completing an open appendectomy (Option D) is the 'next best step'. It prioritizes patient safety, provides optimal control of the situation, and uses the most appropriate surgical approach to resolve the complication."
