    "To find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we can use a known theorem from graph theory without needing to perform complex calculations from the definition. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **State the relevant theorem**: We will use a theorem that connects the Alon-Tarsi number of a bipartite graph to the existence of a specific type of matching.\n2.  **Define the graph**: We identify the properties of $K_{1000,1000}$, including its partitions.\n3.  **Apply the theorem**: We'll check if the condition of the theorem is met by $K_{1000,1000}$ using Hall's Marriage Theorem.\n4.  **Conclude the result**: Based on the outcome, we will state the Alon-Tarsi number.\n\nThe following Python script automates this logical reasoning process and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_alon_tarsi_k1000_1000():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning and determines the Alon-Tarsi number\n    for the complete bipartite graph K_1000,1000.\n    \"\"\"\n    m = 1000\n    n = 1000\n\n    print(f\"Finding the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph K_{m},{n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: State the relevant theorem.\")\n    print(\"A key theorem states that for a bipartite graph G=(A U B, E),\")\n    print(\"its Alon-Tarsi number, AT(G), is 2 if and only if G has a matching that saturates\")\n    print(\"at least one of the partitions (i.e., a matching of size |A| or a matching of size |B|).\")\n    print(\"The existence of such a matching can be verified using Hall's Marriage Theorem.\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: Apply the theorem to K_{m},{n}.\")\n    print(f\"Let the partitions of K_{m},{n} be A and B, with |A| = {m} and |B| = {n}.\")\n    print(\"To check for a matching that saturates A, we verify Hall's condition for partition A:\")\n    print(\"For every subset S of A, is the size of its neighborhood |N(S)| greater than or equal to the size of S, |S|?\")\n    \n    # Check for empty set\n    print(\"\\n - If S is the empty set: |S| = 0 and its neighborhood N(S) is also empty, so |N(S)| = 0.\")\n    print(\"   The condition |N(S)| >= |S| becomes 0 >= 0, which is true.\")\n    \n    # Check for non-empty sets\n    print(f\"\\n - If S is a non-empty subset of A: Since the graph is a *complete* bipartite graph,\")\n    print(f\"   every vertex in A is connected to all {n} vertices in B.\")\n    print(f\"   Therefore, the neighborhood N(S) for any non-empty S is the entire partition B.\")\n    print(f\"   This means |N(S)| = |B| = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"   The size of the subset S, |S|, is at least 1 and at most {m}.\")\n    print(f\"   So, the condition |N(S)| >= |S| becomes {n} >= |S|.\")\n    print(f\"   Since the maximum value for |S| is {m}, and we know that {n} >= {m} (as 1000 >= 1000), this condition holds for all subsets S.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Conclusion.\")\n    print(f\"Since Hall's condition holds for partition A, K_{m},{n} has a matching of size {m} that saturates A.\")\n    print(\"(In fact, since m=n, it has a perfect matching).\")\n    print(\"According to the theorem, because such a matching exists, the Alon-Tarsi number is 2.\")\n    \n    result = 2\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"AT(K_{m},{n}) = {result}\")\n\nsolve_alon_tarsi_k1000_1000()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
