Word Concreteness Rating,A,-,+,Children learn concrete words (e.g., 'apple') easily as they can be grounded in sensory experience. LLMs lack this grounding, and the meaning of concrete words is less captured by textual statistics alone compared to abstract words. This leads to a negative effect for LLMs.
Number of Characters,B,-,-,Longer words are generally harder for both children to say and for models to process. The effect is negative for both.
Mean Length of Sequences,C,+, -,LLMs benefit from more context (longer sequences) for prediction. Children find longer sentences harder to parse. The effects are opposite to what the question asks.
Word Complexity Rating,D,-,-,More complex words are harder for both children and language models to learn. The effect is negative for both.
Word Imageability Rating,E,-,+,Similar to concreteness. Words that are easy to form a mental image of are easier for children (grounded cognition) but not necessarily for a text-only LLM.
Lexical Class,F,N/A,N/A,This is a categorical feature, not one with a simple positive/negative linear effect on acquisition difficulty in this manner.
Word Log Frequency,G,+,+,Higher frequency words are easier for both LLMs and children to learn due to more exposure. The effect is positive for both.
