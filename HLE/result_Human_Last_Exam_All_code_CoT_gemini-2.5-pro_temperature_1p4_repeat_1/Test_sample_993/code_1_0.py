    Explains the factors leading to low 18O isotope levels in lake sulfate deposits.

Scientific Rationale:
The concentration of the heavy oxygen isotope, 18O, in lake water (and the sulfate that forms from it) is controlled by a balance between the isotopic composition of water inflow and the effects of evaporation.

1.  Effect of Evaporation: During evaporation, water molecules containing the lighter oxygen isotope (16O) enter the vapor phase more readily than those with the heavier isotope (18O). This process, known as isotopic fractionation, leaves the remaining lake water enriched in 18O. Therefore, to achieve low 18O levels, evaporation must be minimized.
    -   Conditions that minimize evaporation include:
        -   Cold temperatures.
        -   High humidity (i.e., a wet climate).

2.  Effect of Inflow Water (Precipitation): The primary source of water for the lake is precipitation. Water vapor that evaporates from the ocean is already depleted in 18O. As this vapor travels inland and cools, water with 18O precipitates first. Consequently, precipitation in cold climates is significantly depleted in 18O (has a very low 18O signature). This low-18O water feeds the lake.

3.  Effect of Lake Level: In a wet climate, where precipitation and river inflow exceed evaporation, lake levels will be high. A large, deep lake has a smaller surface-area-to-volume-ratio, which further reduces the overall impact of evaporation on the lake's total water body, helping to preserve the low-18O signature of the inflow.

Conclusion:
Putting these factors together, a 'Wet, cold climate with high lake levels' is the ideal scenario for producing sulfate layers with low levels of the 18O isotope. The cold climate provides low-18O precipitation and minimizes evaporation, while the wet conditions ensure high lake levels that buffer against evaporative enrichment.
