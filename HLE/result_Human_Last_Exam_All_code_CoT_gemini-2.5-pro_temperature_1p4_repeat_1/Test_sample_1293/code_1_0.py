# Objective: Select the best solution to mitigate DNS Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) attacks,
# considering the threat of low-level system compromise (firmware/kernel implants).

# Analysis: The core challenge is that a compromised endpoint can undermine any cryptographic
# protection by intercepting data before encryption or after decryption. The solution must
# therefore address the integrity of the software itself.

# - Options A, B, C, D, E, and F fail because they are either impractical, misapplied,
#   or do not solve the root problem of a compromised client system.
# - Option G, a Secure Blockchain Software Update Mechanism, directly tackles this issue.
#   It aims to prevent malicious implants from being installed via the supply chain,
#   thereby establishing a "root of trust" in the DNS software. Trusted software can
#   then reliably use cryptographic validation (like DNSSEC) to defeat AitM attacks.

# Therefore, the best choice is G. This script will print the final answer.
