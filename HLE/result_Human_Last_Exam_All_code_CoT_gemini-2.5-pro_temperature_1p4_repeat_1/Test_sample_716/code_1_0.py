# The Hausdorff dimension of a curve can be determined by its mathematical properties.
# The given curve is defined by the parametric equations:
# x(t) = sin(pi*t)
# y(t) = sin(t)
# z(t) = cos(2t)

# These functions are all continuously differentiable (smooth).
# We can find the tangent vector by taking the derivative of each component with respect to t:
# r'(t) = (pi * cos(pi*t), cos(t), -2 * sin(2t))

# A key property for determining the dimension is whether the curve is "regular",
# which means its tangent vector r'(t) is never the zero vector.
# As shown in the step-by-step reasoning, it's impossible for all three components
# of r'(t) to be zero for the same value of t.

# A fundamental theorem in fractal geometry states that the Hausdorff dimension of any
# smooth, regular curve (a C^1 manifold of dimension 1) is 1.

# Therefore, the Hausdorff dimension of the given curve is a well-defined integer value.
# The following code prints this definitive dimension.
