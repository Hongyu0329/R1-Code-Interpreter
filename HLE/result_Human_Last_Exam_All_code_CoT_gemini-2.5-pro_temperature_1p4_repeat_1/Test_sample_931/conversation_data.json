    "Here is a Python script that analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans to determine the correct answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I'll establish the known food sources for adult Raphidiopterans based on entomological knowledge. They are primarily predators but are also known to supplement their diet.\n2.  Next, I'll systematically evaluate each answer choice against these known facts.\n3.  The script will print an analysis for each individual choice (A, B, C, D, E), stating whether it's a known food source.\n4.  Finally, it will determine which of the combined answer choices (F or G) is the most accurate and print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_snakefly_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided options to determine the diet of adult Raphidiopterans.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define known dietary facts for adult Raphidiopterans (Snakeflies).\n    # They are predators and also feed on pollen/nectar.\n    primary_diet = \"small, soft-bodied arthropods (e.g., aphids, mites)\"\n    supplementary_diet = \"pollen and nectar\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidiopterans...\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate each option.\n    # Option A: Nectar\n    analysis_A = \"Nectar\" in supplementary_diet\n    print(f\"1.
