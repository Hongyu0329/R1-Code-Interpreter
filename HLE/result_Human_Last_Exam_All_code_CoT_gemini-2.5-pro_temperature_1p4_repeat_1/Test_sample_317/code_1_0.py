    # Step 1: Explain Burke's distinction between Motion and Action.
    print("Kenneth Burke's framework rests on a crucial distinction:")
    print(" - Motion: The realm of the purely physical, non-symbolic (e.g., a falling rock). It is what 'is'.")
    print(" - Action: The realm of the symbolic, involving language, choice, motive, and morality. It is unique to humans.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 2: Explain the role of the Negative.
    print("The defining feature that elevates Motion to Action is the 'Negative.'")
    print("Burke argues that there is no 'no' in nature; the negative is a function of language and symbolism.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 3: Connect the "Tribal No" to Action.
    print("The 'Tribal No' refers to the foundational prohibitions of a society (e.g., 'Thou shalt not...').")
    print("Since these are built entirely on the concept of the Negative, they cannot be part of the realm of Motion.")
    print("Therefore, the 'Tribal No' is definitively in the realm of Action.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    # Step 4: Justify the sub-clause 'it is imaginal'.
    print("These prohibitions do not describe physical reality but a socially constructed moral order.")
    print("This order is a product of the human imaginationâ€”the ability to conceive of and enforce rules about what is not to be done.")
    print("Thus, 'imaginal' is the most accurate descriptor.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    # Final Answer
    # Choice A: Action; it is imaginal.
    print("The final answer is A.")
