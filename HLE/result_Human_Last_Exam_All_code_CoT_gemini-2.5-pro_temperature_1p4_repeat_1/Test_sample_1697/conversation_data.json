    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) reaction. Here is the step-by-step reasoning to determine the final product.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material:** The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This is a benzene ring with two substituents: a diethylamide group [-C(=O)N(Et)2] and a dimethylamino group [-N(Me)2] at the meta-position (1,3-positions) relative to each other.\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction Step:** The molecule is treated with sec-BuLi and TMEDA.\n    *   `sec-BuLi` is a very strong base.\n    *   `TMEDA` is a ligand that coordinates to the lithium ion, increasing the basicity of the sec-BuLi and helping to direct the reaction.\n    *   This combination of reagents is standard for directed ortho-metalation, where a proton on the aromatic ring is removed (deprotonation) to form a lithiated intermediate (an organolithium species).\n3.  **Determine the Site of Metalation:** The position of deprotonation is directed by the substituent groups on the ring. These groups are called Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs). Both the diethylamide and the dimethylamino groups are excellent DMGs. However, the amide group (`-CONR2`) is a significantly stronger directing group than the amino group (`-NR2`). Therefore, the deprotonation will occur at a position *ortho* (adjacent) to the stronger directing group, the diethylamide.\n4.  **Pinpoint the Exact Position:** The diethylamide group is at position 1. The ortho positions are 2 and 6. The dimethylamino group is at position 3. The proton at position 2 is located between the two directing groups, making it the most acidic and sterically accessible for this type of reaction. The base will therefore selectively remove the proton at position 2.\n5.  **Analyze the Second Reaction Step:** The resulting lithiated intermediate (a strong nucleophile) is then treated with methyl iodide (`CH3I`). This is an electrophile. The nucleophilic carbon at position 2 will attack the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion.\n6.  **Identify the Final Product:** This reaction sequence results in the substitution of the hydrogen atom at position 2 with a methyl group. The final product is therefore N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\nHere is the Python code that describes this process and prints the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the product of a two-step organic reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    starting_material = \"N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    reagent1 = \"sec-BuLi/TMEDA\"\n    reagent2 = \"Methyl Iodide (CH3I)\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Reaction\")\n    print(f\"Starting Material: {starting_material}\")\n    print(f\"The first step involves reacting the starting material with {reagent1}.\")\n    print(\"This is a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) reaction.
