    "To answer the physics question, we first need to understand the rules of integration for Grassmann variables. I will write a Python script to demonstrate these rules, which are the foundation of the path integral for fermions.\n\nMy plan for the script is as follows:\n1.  The Pauli exclusion principle is encoded in the property that Grassmann variables square to zero (e.g., `η² = 0`). This means any function of a single Grassmann variable can be written as `f(η) = A + Bη`.\n2.  The integration over a Grassmann variable, known as Berezin integration, is defined by a set of simple rules: `∫dη = 0` and `∫dη η = 1`.\n3.  Combining these, the integral of a general function `f(η)` is `∫dη (A + Bη) = A∫dη + B∫dη η = A*0 + B*1 = B`. The integral simply projects out the coefficient of the `η` term.\n4.  My script will define a function that implements this rule. It will then demonstrate the integration for the two fundamental cases: `f(η) = 1` (where `A=1, B=0`) and `f(η) = η` (where `A=0, B=1`) to show how the measure is defined by these operations. The output will be formatted to look like the integration equations.\n\n```python\ndef berezin_integral(A, B):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs the Berezin integral for a function of a single Grassmann variable.\n    A function of a single Grassmann variable eta can be written as f(eta) = A + B*eta.\n    The integral is defined as: integral d(eta) f(eta) = B.\n\n    Args:\n        A (float or int): The constant part of the function.\n        B (float or int): The coefficient of the eta term.\n\n    Returns:\n        float or int: The result of the integration, which is B.\n    \"\"\"\n    return B\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates the rules of Berezin integration for two primary cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"In Grassmann algebra, any analytic function of a variable 'eta' is f(eta) = A + B*eta, since eta*eta = 0.\")\n    print(\"The Berezin integral is defined by the rule: integral d(eta) * f(eta) = B.\\n\")\n\n    # Case 1: Integrate a constant function, f(eta) = 1.\n    # Here, A=1, B=0.\n    A1, B1 = 1, 0\n    result1 = berezin_integral(A1, B1)\n    print(f\"Case 1: Integrating f(eta) = {A1} + {B1} * eta\")\n    # Using 'η' for a more standard look in the output string.\n    print(f\"∫ d(η) ({A1} + {B1}η) = {result1}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Case 2: Integrate the Grassmann variable itself, f(eta) = eta.\n    # Here, A=0, B=1.\n    A2, B2 = 0, 1\n    result2 = berezin_integral(A2, B2)\n    print(f\"Case 2: Integrating f(eta) = {A2} + {B2} * eta\")\n    print(f\"∫ d(η) ({A2} + {B2}η) = {result2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe second case, ∫d(η)η = 1, defines the normalization of the integration measure.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
