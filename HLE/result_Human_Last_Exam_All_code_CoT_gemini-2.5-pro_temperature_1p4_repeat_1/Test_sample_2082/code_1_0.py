Detailed Analysis of Options:

A. Through direct vasodilation: This is the correct mechanism. Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker. The influx of calcium into vascular smooth muscle cells is necessary for their contraction, which leads to vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and increased blood pressure. By antagonizing calcium, magnesium promotes the relaxation of these muscle cells, causing vasodilation (widening of blood vessels). This reduces systemic vascular resistance and lowers blood pressure.

B. By protecting elastic fibers from calcium deposition: While magnesium may play a role in inhibiting vascular calcification, which contributes to long-term arterial stiffness, the most direct and immediate mechanism for blood pressure reduction is vasodilation.

C. By increasing white matter and gray matter in the brain: Magnesium is vital for neurological health, but changes in brain matter are not a direct mechanism for blood pressure control via supplementation.

D. By stimulating an inflammatory response: This is incorrect. Chronic inflammation is associated with an increased risk of hypertension. Magnesium is known to have anti-inflammatory properties, which is a beneficial effect.

E. It raises systemic blood calcium levels: This is incorrect. Magnesium and calcium often have an antagonistic relationship. Raising calcium levels would tend to cause vasoconstriction and increase blood pressure.
