    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements a non-trivial, non-discrete topology T on a set X of cardinality c can have.

    Step 1: Understand the definition of a complement.
    A topology S is a complement to T if:
    1. T U S generates the discrete topology (their supremum in the lattice of topologies is the discrete topology).
    2. T intersect S is the trivial topology {empty_set, X} (their infimum is the trivial topology).

    Step 2: Can the number of complements be zero?
    A key theorem in general topology, first proved by J. Hartmanis in 1958, states that the lattice of topologies on any set is 'complemented'. This means that for *every* topology T, there exists at least one complement S satisfying the conditions above. Therefore, the number of complements can never be zero. The minimum possible number is at least 1.

    Step 3: Can the number of complements be exactly one?
    To show that 1 is the minimum possible number, we need to find an example of a topology that has exactly one complement. Let's construct one.
    - Let X be a set of cardinality c.
    - Pick an arbitrary point p in X.
    - Consider the 'particular point topology' T_p, where the open sets are the empty set and any subset of X that contains p. T_p is non-trivial and non-discrete.

    Step 4: Prove that T_p has a unique complement.
    Let S be any complement to T_p.
    - From the condition (T_p intersect S = {empty_set, X}), any set in S (other than X or the empty set) cannot contain the point p.
    - From the condition that T_p U S generates the discrete topology, we must be able to form the singleton set {x} for any x in X by intersecting an open set from T_p and an open set from S.
    - Let's consider a point x != p. To form {x}, we can choose the open set X from T_p. Then we must have {x} = X intersect V for some V in S. This implies V = {x}.
    - Therefore, for every point x different from p, the singleton {x} must be an open set in S.
    - Since S is a topology, it must be closed under arbitrary unions. If S contains all singletons {x} for x != p, it must contain the entire power set of X \\ {p}. So, P(X \\ {p}) is a subset of S.
    - We have two constraints on S:
        1. P(X \\ {p}) is a subset of S.
        2. Every set in S \\ {empty_set, X} is a subset of X \\ {p}.
    - The only topology on X that satisfies these constraints is S = P(X \\ {p}) U {X}, known as the 'excluded point topology'.
    - This proves that the particular point topology T_p has exactly one complement.

    Step 5: Final Conclusion.
    Since the number of complements must be at least 1, and we have found a topology that has exactly 1 complement, the smallest possible number of complements is 1.
