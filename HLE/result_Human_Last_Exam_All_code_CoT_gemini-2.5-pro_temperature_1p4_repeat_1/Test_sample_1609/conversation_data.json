    "To find a(4), where a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables, we can use a known formula from combinatorics and Boolean logic.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Identify the formula for a(n). The maximal number of prime implicants for a function of n variables is given by the sum:\n    `a(n) = Î£ C(n, k) * C(k, floor(k/2))` for k from 0 to n.\n    Here, `C(n, k)` represents the binomial coefficient \"n choose k\".\n\n2.  Apply this formula for n = 4. This means we need to calculate the sum:\n    `a(4) = C(4,0)*C(0,0) + C(4,1)*C(1,0) + C(4,2)*C(2,1) + C(4,3)*C(3,1) + C(4,4)*C(4,2)`\n\n3.  Write a Python script to perform these calculations. The script will:\n    *   Include a function to compute binomial coefficients.\n    *   Loop from k = 0 to 4.\n    *   In each iteration, calculate the term `C(4, k) * C(k, floor(k/2))`.\n    *   Print each step of the calculation to show how the final result is obtained.\n    *   Sum up all the terms to get the final value of a(4).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the binomial coefficient C(n, k), also known as \"n choose k\".\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    # This is an efficient way to calculate n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\n    return math.factorial(n) // (math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(n - k))\n\ndef calculate_a_n(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables.\n    It prints the step-by-step calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_sum = 0\n    terms = []\n    \n    print(f\"To find a({n}), we use the formula: a(n) = sum for k=0 to {n} of [C(n, k) * C(k, floor(k/2))]\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    for k in range(n + 1):\n        # Calculate the two combination terms\n        c_nk = combinations(n, k)\n        k_floor_div_2 = k // 2\n        c_k_floor = combinations(k, k_floor_div_2)\n        \n        # Calculate the product for the current k\n        term_value = c_nk * c_k_floor\n        \n        # Print the breakdown for the current term\n        print(f\"Term for k={k}: C({n}, {k}) * C({k}, {k_floor_div_2}) = {c_nk} * {c_k_floor} = {term_value}\")\n        \n        # Add to the total sum and store the term for the final equation\n        total_sum += term_value\n        terms.append(str(term_value))\n\n    # Construct and print the final equation\n    final_equation = \" + \".join(terms)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"So, a({n}) = {final_equation}\")\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {total_sum}\")\n\n\n# The user wants to know a(4)\nn_value = 4\ncalculate_a_n(n_value)\n\n```\n<<<35>>>"
