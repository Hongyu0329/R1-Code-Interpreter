    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will define the core concepts: \"critical-level views\" from population ethics and the \"Non-Elitism\" condition from Arrhenius's impossibility theorems.\n2.  I will then create a Python script to model a critical-level view. This script will include a function that calculates the value of a population based on a given critical level.\n3.  Using this model, I will construct a clear example that demonstrates how a critical-level view violates the Non-Elitism principle.\n4.  The script will simulate the condition of Non-Elitism by comparing two populations:\n    *   A population `A` composed of a growing number of people (`n`) at a welfare level `u` which is positive but *below* the critical level.\n    *   A population `B` composed of one person with very high welfare.\n5.  The script will show that according to the critical-level view, the value of population `A` is always negative and can never exceed the positive value of population `B`, no matter how large `n` becomes. This directly contradicts the Non-Elitism principle.\n6.  The code will print out each step of this logical demonstration, including the numbers used in the equations, to make the reasoning clear. Finally, it will conclude which condition is violated.\n\n```python\ndef explain_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and demonstrates which of Arrhenius's conditions\n    is violated by critical-level views in population ethics.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Understanding the Concepts ---\")\n    print(\"1.
