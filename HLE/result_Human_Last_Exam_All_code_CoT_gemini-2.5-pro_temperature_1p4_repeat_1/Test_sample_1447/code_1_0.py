def solve_translation_challenge():
    """
    This function determines and prints the valid translation practices for the described problem.

    The problem centers on translating a language-specific pun crucial to a story's plot.
    The analysis identifies the following practices as capable of overcoming this challenge:

    I. Transcreation: Recreates an analogous pun in the target language, preserving the puzzle.
    IV. Using a foreign character's accent: A creative method to justify a new pun, enabling transcreation.
    VI. Footnotes: Explains the original pun, ensuring the plot is comprehensible, even if it spoils the puzzle.

    The practices are presented as Roman numerals in ascending order, separated by hyphens.
