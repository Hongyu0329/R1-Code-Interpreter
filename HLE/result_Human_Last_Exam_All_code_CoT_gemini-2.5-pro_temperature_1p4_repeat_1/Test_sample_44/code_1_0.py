The analysis with the most backing from archaeological historians is C.

This statement is the most accurate because it is almost entirely derived from the description given by the geographer Strabo, who was a contemporary of Augustus. His work, 'Geography' (Book 5, Chapter 3, Section 8), is the single most important primary source for the Mausoleum's original appearance.

Key points from Strabo's account reflected in choice C:
1.  A great mound ('tumulus') on a high foundation of white marble.
2.  The mound was covered to the top with 'evergreen trees'.
3.  A bronze statue of Augustus stood at the summit.
4.  The mound contained chambers for the ashes of his 'relatives and friends'.
5.  A separate cremation ground ('ustrinum') was nearby.

Because these details form the very foundation of modern archaeological reconstructions, the statement summarizing them has the most direct backing.
