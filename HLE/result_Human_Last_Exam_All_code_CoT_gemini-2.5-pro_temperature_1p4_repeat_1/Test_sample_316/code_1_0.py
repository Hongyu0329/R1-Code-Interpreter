# The user wants to find the second critical exponent for a reverse square
# function estimate for the cone in R^3.
# One critical exponent is given as p = 4, which arises from bilinear interactions.
# The other critical exponent in the theory of restriction/decoupling for the cone
# is p = 10/3, which arises from more complex Kakeya/multilinear interactions.

# The other critical exponent is p = 10/3.
# We can represent this as the solution to the equation 3 * p = 10.
# The following code will output the numbers in this equation and its solution.

p_numerator = 10
p_denominator = 3

print("The other critical exponent, p, is the solution to the following equation:")
print(f"{p_denominator} * p = {p_numerator}")
print(f"The numbers in the final equation are: {p_denominator}, {p_numerator}")
print(f"The solution is p = {p_numerator}/{p_denominator}")
