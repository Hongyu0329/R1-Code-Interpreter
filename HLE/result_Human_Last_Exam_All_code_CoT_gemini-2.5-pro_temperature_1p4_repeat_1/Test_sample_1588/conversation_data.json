    "To determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a result from the theory of free Lie algebras. The terms of a given order `n` in the BCH formula form a basis for the free Lie algebra with two generators (X and Y) of degree `n`. The number of these basis elements is given by Witt's formula.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  **Introduce Witt's Formula:** The formula for the number of basis elements `L_k(n)` of degree `n` in a free Lie algebra with `k` generators is:\n    `L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n    where the sum is over the positive divisors `d` of `n`, and `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  **Apply the formula to the problem:**\n    *   The order `n` is 10.\n    *   The number of generators `k` is 2 (for X and Y).\n\n3.  **Implement the calculation in Python:**\n    *   Find all divisors `d` of `n=10`.\n    *   For each divisor `d`, calculate its Möbius function value `μ(d)`.\n    *   Calculate each term `μ(d) * 2^(10/d)`.\n    *   Sum these terms and divide by 10 to get the final result.\n    *   The code will print out the full equation and its solution.\n\nThe Möbius function `μ(n)` is defined as:\n*   `μ(1) = 1`.\n*   `μ(n) = 0` if `n` has a squared prime factor.\n*   `μ(n) = (-1)^r` if `n` is a product of `r` distinct prime numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(num):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Mobius function mu(num).\"\"\"\n    if num == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(num)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n            \n    return (-1) ** len(factors)\n\ndef solve_bch_order_10():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the BCH expansion\n    using Witt's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    k = 2\n\n    # Find divisors of n\n    divisors = sorted([d for d in range(1, n + 1) if n % d == 0])\n\n    numerator_sum = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n    calculation_parts = []\n\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term_val = mu_d * (k ** power)\n        numerator_sum += term_val\n        \n        # Build strings for printing the equation and calculation\n        part_str = f\"μ({d}) * {k}^({n}/{d})\"\n        equation_parts.append(part_str)\n        \n        calc_str = f\"({mu_d}) * {k}^{power}\"\n        calculation_parts.append(calc_str)\n\n    result = numerator_sum // n\n\n    # Print the explanation and final equation\n    print(\"The number of nonzero coefficients is given by Witt's formula for the dimension of the free Lie algebra L_k(n):\")\n    print(f\"L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{{d|n}} μ(d) * k^(n/d)\")\n    print(\"\\nFor this problem, n=10 and k=2.
