    # 1. Symmetric: Yes.

    # The property D_22 = (D_11)^2 is very specific. For the generators v=(a,b),

    # An argument based on Jensen's inequality shows that if D were a convex

    # The (2,2) element being 0 means it must be a combination of generators

    # We can take v1=(6,0) -> S1=[[36,0],[0,0]] and v2=(7,0) -> S2=[[49,0],[0,0]].
    # 42 = lambda * 36 + (1-lambda) * 49 -> 13*lambda = 7 -> lambda = 7/13.
