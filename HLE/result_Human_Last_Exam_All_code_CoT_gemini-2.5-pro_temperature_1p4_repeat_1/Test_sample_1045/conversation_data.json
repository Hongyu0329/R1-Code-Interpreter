    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the molecule:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it consists of 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set for each atom type:**\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:** It has core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) electrons.\n        *   The core 1s orbital is described by 1 contracted function (from 6 primitive Gaussians).\n        *   The valence 2s and three 2p orbitals are each split into two parts: an inner part (3 primitives) and an outer part (1 primitive). This results in 2 contracted functions for the 2s orbital and 2 for each of the three 2p orbitals.\n        *   Total per Carbon atom = 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 3 * 2 (for 2p) = **9 contracted functions**.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** It only has a valence 1s orbital.\n        *   The 1s orbital is split into two parts, similar to the valence orbitals of carbon.\n        *   Total per Hydrogen atom = 2 contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Multiply the number of each type of atom by its corresponding number of contracted functions and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 (1s) + 2 (2s) + 3*2 (2p) = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 2 (1s)\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions for each element\ntotal_carbon_functions = num_carbon * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_hydrogen_functions = num_hydrogen * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the grand total\ntotal_functions = total_carbon_functions + total_hydrogen_functions\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation\nprint(f\"For toluene (C{num_carbon}H{num_hydrogen}) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Number of functions for Carbon = {num_carbon} atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/atom = {total_carbon_functions}\")\nprint(f\"Number of functions for Hydrogen = {num_hydrogen} atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/atom = {total_hydrogen_functions}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of contracted Gaussian functions = {total_carbon_functions} + {total_hydrogen_functions} = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
