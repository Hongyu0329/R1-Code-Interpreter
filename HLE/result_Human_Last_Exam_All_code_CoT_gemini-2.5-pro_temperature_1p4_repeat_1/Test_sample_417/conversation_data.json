    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry to count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central benzene ring substituted at all six positions. The pattern of substitution, with identical large groups at 1,3,5 and identical methyl groups at 2,4,6, gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. This means we only need to count the unique proton environments in one-third of the molecule and sum them up.\n2.  **Identify Unique Proton Environments:** We will break down one repeating unit of the molecule into three parts:\n    *   The methyl group on the central benzene ring.\n    *   The `-CH2-` linker group.\n    *   The complex chiral arm: `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`.\n3.  **Count the Signals:** We will count the number of signals expected from each part and sum them to find the total.\n\n### Step-by-step Signal Count:\n\n1.  **Central Core Methyls:** The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 of the central benzene ring are chemically equivalent due to the molecule's C3 symmetry. Therefore, they will produce a single, combined signal.\n    *   Number of signals = **1**\n\n2.  **Methylene (`-CH2-`) Linkers:** The three `-CH2-` groups are also equivalent due to C3 symmetry. Each linker is attached to the chiral indazole arm. The presence of this adjacent chiral center makes the two protons of the `-CH2-` group diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and are expected to produce two distinct signals (which may appear as an AB quartet).\n    *   Number of signals = **2**\n\n3.  **The Chiral Arm:** The three arms are identical. We only need to count the signals for one. The arm is a rigid, asymmetric, bicyclic system derived from camphor. Due to its lack of internal symmetry, almost all of its protons are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   **Pyrazole ring proton:** There is one proton on the indazole ring system. -> **1 signal**\n    *   **Bridgehead proton:** There is one proton on a bridgehead carbon of the bicyclic system. -> **1 signal**\n    *   **Other bicyclic ring protons:** There are two `CH2` groups in the six-membered ring. In this rigid chiral environment, all four protons are diastereotopic and thus chemically unique. -> **4 signals**\n    *   **Methyl protons:** There are three methyl groups in the arm. All three are in unique environments due to the overall asymmetry (one is at bridgehead C7, and the two at C8 are diastereotopic). -> **3 signals**\n    *   Total signals from one arm = 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 = **9 signals**.\n\n4.  **Total Signals:** By summing the signals from each distinct part, we get the total number of expected peaks.\n    *   Total = (Core Methyls) + (Linker Protons) + (Arm Protons)\n    *   Total = 1 + 2 + 9 = **12**\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints this sum.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. The molecule has C3 symmetry. We count the signals for one repeating unit.\n# 2. A repeating unit consists of a core methyl group, a CH2 linker, and a complex chiral arm.\n# 3. Sum the signals from each part to get the total.\n\n# Number of signals from the three equivalent methyl groups on the central benzene ring.\n# Due to C3 symmetry, they are all equivalent.\nsignals_core_methyls = 1\n\n# Number of signals from the protons of one CH2 linker group.\n# The three CH2 linkers are equivalent by C3 symmetry.\n# The two protons on a single CH2 group are diastereotopic because they are adjacent to a chiral group.\n# Diastereotopic protons are non-equivalent.\nsignals_linker_CH2 = 2\n\n# Number of signals from one of the three equivalent chiral arms.\n# The arm is a rigid, asymmetric bicyclic system.\n# We count the non-equivalent protons within one arm:\n# - 1 signal from the proton on the pyrazole ring.\n# - 1 signal from the bridgehead proton.\n# - 4 signals from the four non-equivalent protons of the two CH2 groups in the bicyclic frame.\n# - 3 signals from the three non-equivalent methyl groups.\n# Total = 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 9\nsignals_arm = 9\n\n# Calculate the total number of expected 1H NMR peaks\ntotal_signals = signals_core_methyls + signals_linker_CH2 + signals_arm\n\n# Print the final calculation, showing each component\nprint(f\"Calculation of total 1H NMR signals:\")\nprint(f\"Signals from central methyl groups: {signals_core_methyls}\")\nprint(f\"Signals from one CH2 linker: {signals_linker_CH2}\")\nprint(f\"Signals from one substituent arm: {signals_arm}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of signals = {signals_core_methyls} + {signals_linker_CH2} + {signals_arm} = {total_signals}\")\n```\n<<<H>>>"
