    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Basics:** First, I'll start with the fundamental principle of how logical qubits are determined in a surface code. The number of logical qubits is not related to the number of physical qubits (like `d^2`), but rather to the topology of the surface.\n2.  **State the Formula:** For a single, simple patch of surface code (which is topologically a plane or a disk), the number of logical qubits, `k`, that can be encoded is equal to the number of \"holes\" or \"boundaries\", `h`, created within it. The formula is simply `k = h`.\n3.  **Analyze the Problem Setup:** The problem specifies we have two separate patches of surface code and a total of two holes distributed between them.\n4.  **Calculate Total Qubits:** Since the patches are separate systems, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch. We can represent the number of holes in the first patch as `h1` and in the second as `h2`.\n    *   The total number of holes is `h1 + h2 = 2`.\n    *   The total number of logical qubits will be `k_total = k1 + k2 = h1 + h2`.\n5.  **Synthesize the Result:** By substituting the total number of holes into the equation, it becomes clear that the total number of logical qubits is 2, regardless of how the holes are distributed (e.g., one hole in each patch, or two holes in one patch and none in the other).\n6.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that defines these variables and prints the calculation, explicitly showing how the numbers sum up to the final answer, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_qubit_encoding():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for a given surface code setup.\n\n    The number of logical qubits 'k' on a single planar surface code patch is\n    equal to the number of holes 'h' on that patch (k = h).\n\n    For multiple, separate patches, the total number of logical qubits is the\n    sum of the qubits on each patch. Therefore, the total number of logical\n    qubits is equal to the total number of holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of holes specified in the problem.\n    total_holes = 2\n    \n    # The problem specifies two separate patches. The distribution of the 2 holes\n    # between these patches does not change the total number of logical qubits.\n    # We can illustrate with any valid distribution, e.g., 1 hole per patch.\n    holes_patch1 = 1\n    holes_patch2 = 1\n    \n    # For each patch, the number of logical qubits equals its number of holes.\n    logical_qubits_patch1 = holes_patch1\n    logical_qubits_patch2 = holes_patch2\n    \n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum from each patch.\n    total_logical_qubits = logical_qubits_patch1 + logical_qubits_patch2\n    \n    print(\"The total number of logical qubits is the sum of logical qubits from each patch.\")\n    print(\"Let's demonstrate with a distribution of 1 hole per patch:\")\n    print(f\"Logical qubits from Patch 1 (with {holes_patch1} hole): {logical_qubits_patch1}\")\n    print(f\"Logical qubits from Patch 2 (with {holes_patch2} hole): {logical_qubits_patch2}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    # The final output needs to show each number in the equation.\n    print(f\"{logical_qubits_patch1} + {logical_qubits_patch2} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThus, at most {total_logical_qubits} logical qubits can be encoded.\")\n\nsolve_qubit_encoding()\n\n# The final answer as a raw value.\nsys.stdout.write(\"<<<2>>>\\n\")\n```"
