    The reaction is a classic Anionic Oxy-Cope rearrangement.
    1.  KH deprotonates the tertiary alcohol to form a potassium alkoxide.
    2.  The alkoxide undergoes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, which is driven by
        the release of strain from the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene ring system.
    3.  This forms an enolate intermediate with a new, larger, fused-ring skeleton.
    4.  Aqueous workup protonates the enolate, which tautomerizes to the final ketone product.
    
    The reaction is an isomerization, so the product has the same molecular formula
    as the starting material.
