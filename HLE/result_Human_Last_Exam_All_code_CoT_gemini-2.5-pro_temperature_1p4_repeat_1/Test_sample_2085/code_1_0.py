    explanation = """
The name "Odobeccus" is not Gaulish, but rather of Germanic (specifically, Frankish) origin. Odobeccus was a Frankish chieftain who opposed Clovis I in the late 5th century.

The name's first element, 'Odo-', derives from a Proto-Germanic root meaning 'wealth' or 'prosperity'. This element is the direct linguistic ancestor of the French name 'Eudes', which was a common name during the early Middle Ages in France.

Therefore, while the full, latinized name 'Odobeccus' does not have a direct, single-word equivalent in modern French, the closest and most direct equivalent for its root is: Eudes.
