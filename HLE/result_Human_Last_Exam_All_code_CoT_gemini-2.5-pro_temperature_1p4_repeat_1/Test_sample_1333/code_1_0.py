    The question asks for the maximum possible value of the ratio χ(D)/χ(D_N) for a regular dessin D
    with negative Euler characteristic that is a smooth covering of a quotient dessin D_N.

    1. Euler Characteristic Formula:
    For a regular dessin D defined by a group G = <b, w>, the Euler characteristic of the underlying surface is given by:
    χ(D) = |G| * (1/|b| + 1/|w| + 1/|bw| - 1)
    where |G| is the order of the group G, and |b|, |w|, |bw| are the orders of the respective group elements.

    2. Quotient Dessin and Smooth Covering:
    The quotient dessin D_N is defined by the quotient group G/N, where N is a normal subgroup of G. Its Euler characteristic is:
    χ(D_N) = |G/N| * (1/|bN| + 1/|wN| + 1/|(bw)N| - 1)
    The condition that D is a "smooth covering" of D_N means they share the same bi-valency and face length. For regular dessins, this translates to:
    |b| = |bN|
    |w| = |wN|
    |bw| = |(bw)N|

    3. Calculating the Ratio:
    Let's compute the ratio χ(D) / χ(D_N):
    Ratio = [|G| * (1/|b| + 1/|w| + 1/|bw| - 1)] / [|G/N| * (1/|bN| + 1/|wN| + 1/|(bw)N| - 1)]

    Due to the smooth covering condition, the terms in the parentheses are identical.
    Since χ(D) < 0, this term is a non-zero negative constant. We can cancel it out.
    Ratio = |G| / |G/N|
    Using Lagrange's theorem, |G| = |G/N| * |N|.
    Ratio = |N|

    4. Maximizing the Ratio:
    The problem is now equivalent to finding the maximum possible order of a normal subgroup N of a group G = <b, w>, subject to two conditions:
    a) 1/|b| + 1/|w| + 1/|bw| < 1 (since χ(D) < 0)
    b) The smooth covering conditions |b|=|bN|, |w|=|wN|, |bw|=|bwN| must hold. These conditions are equivalent to N having a trivial intersection with the cyclic subgroups generated by b, w, and bw.

    5. Unbounded Nature of |N|:
    The question allows us to choose any such dessin D. This means we can choose the group G.
    It is possible to construct finite groups G with normal subgroups N of arbitrarily large order that satisfy the required conditions.
    This can be shown by considering finite quotients of infinite hyperbolic triangle groups, which correspond to these dessins.
    For any integer k > 1, one can construct a valid pair of dessins D and D_N such that the ratio |N| is greater than k.

    For example, one can start with an infinite hyperbolic group Γ (e.g., the (2,3,7) triangle group) and find a suitable finite-index normal subgroup M to define D_N. Since M is an infinite (but finitely generated) group, it contains characteristic subgroups K of arbitrarily large index. A characteristic subgroup of a normal subgroup is normal in the parent group. By choosing K, we define a dessin D such that χ(D)/χ(D_N) = [M:K]. This index can be arbitrarily large.

    Conclusion:
    Since |N| can be made arbitrarily large, there is no maximum possible value for the ratio χ(D)/χ(D_N).
