    # --- Calculation Steps ---

    # 1. Determine the maximum possible Recall.
    # Without external linguistic resources, an alignment model can only reliably identify
    # relations that are lexically identical. The 'p'% of relations that are lexically
    # different cannot be aligned with certainty and will be missed.
    # Therefore, the maximum recall is the proportion of relations that are lexically identical.
    # Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = (1 - p/100) / ((1 - p/100) + p/100)
    recall = (100 - p) / 100.0

    # 2. Determine the maximum possible Precision.
    # To achieve a theoretical maximum F1 score, the ideal model would make no
    # incorrect alignments (False Positives = 0). It would only align the pairs
    # it is certain about (the lexically identical ones).
    # Precision = TP / (TP + FP). Since FP = 0, Precision = TP / TP = 1.
    precision = 1.0

    # 3. Calculate the maximal F1 score.
    # The F1 score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
    # F1 = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
    f1_score_numerator = 2 * precision * recall
