    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the topological relations for Feynman graphs.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the relevant formulas:** There are two key relationships for a Feynman diagram:\n    *   The formula connecting the number of loops (L), internal propagators (I), and vertices (V): `L = I - V + 1`.\n    *   The formula relating the number of lines connected to vertices to the number of propagators and external lines (E). For a scalar field theory with a $\\phi^4$ interaction, each vertex connects four lines. This gives: `4 * V = 2 * I + E`.\n\n2.  **Combine the formulas:** We will solve this system of two equations to express the number of vertices (V) in terms of the number of loops (L) and external lines (E).\n\n3.  **Minimize the number of vertices:** We are given that the diagram has two loops (`L=2`). To find the minimum possible value for V, we need to find the minimum valid number of external lines (E). The number of external lines, E, must be a non-negative even integer for V to be an integer. The smallest possible value is `E=0`, which corresponds to a vacuum diagram (a diagram with no external particles).\n\n4.  **Calculate the final answer:** Substitute `L=2` and `E=0` into the derived formula for V to find the minimum number of vertices. The Python code below will carry out these steps and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in a scalar phi^4 theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the minimum number of vertices (V) in a two-loop (L=2) Feynman diagram\")\n    print(\"for a scalar phi^4 theory, we use two fundamental topological relations:\")\n    print(\"1.
