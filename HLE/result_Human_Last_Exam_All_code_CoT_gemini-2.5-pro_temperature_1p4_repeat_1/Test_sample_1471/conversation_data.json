    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the equation:\n\n1.  **Decode the Numerals:** The equation uses a mix of Chinese and Cuneiform numerals. I will first translate each of these into modern Arabic numerals.\n    *   `四` is the Chinese numeral for 4.\n    *   `𒌋𒌋𒌋` is composed of three Cuneiform symbols for 10 (`𒌋`), so it represents 30.\n    *   `𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹` is composed of two symbols for 10 (`𒌋`) and three symbols for 1 (`𒁹`), so it represents 23.\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:** After decoding, the equation becomes `4 / 30 - 23`.\n3.  **Create a Python Script:** I will write a simple Python script to calculate the result of this equation and print both the translated equation and its solution.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the equation:\n\n```python\n# 1. Decode the numerals into modern numbers\nnum1 = 4  # Represents the Chinese numeral '四'\nnum2 = 30 # Represents the Cuneiform numeral '𒌋𒌋𒌋' (10+10+10)\nnum3 = 23 # Represents the Cuneiform numeral '𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹' (10+10+1+1+1)\n\n# 2. Perform the calculation\nresult = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# 3. Print the equation with modern numbers and the final answer\nprint(f\"The equation can be translated to: {num1} / {num2} - {num3}\")\nprint(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<-22.866666666666667>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
