    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the integer value `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression and then calculate its base-2 logarithm.\n\nThe SKI expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`.\n\nA Church integer `n` is a function that, when applied to another function `f` and a value `x`, results in `f` being applied to `x` a total of `n` times, i.e., `n(f)(x) = f(f(...f(x)...))`.\n\nManually reducing this complex expression is tedious and highly prone to error. A more robust approach is to write a program that simulates the reduction of SKI combinator expressions.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Represent SKI expressions:** I will define Python classes to represent the combinators `S`, `K`, `I`, and applications (one expression applied to another).\n2.  **Parse the expression:** The input string will be parsed into an internal tree structure representing the nested applications. I will use Python's `eval` function in a controlled environment for this.\n3.  **Implement a reduction engine:** I will write a function that repeatedly applies the SKI reduction rules (`I x → x`, `K x y → x`, `S x y z → x z (y z)`) to an expression until it reaches its simplest form (normal form). The reduction will follow the \"normal order\" (leftmost, outermost) evaluation strategy, which is crucial for correctness in lambda calculus.\n4.  **Determine n:** I will apply the parsed expression to symbolic variables representing `f` and `x`. After the reduction is complete, the resulting expression will have the form `f(f(...f(x)...))`. I will count the number of times `f` is applied to determine the value of `n`.\n5.  **Calculate the final answer:** Once `n` is found, I will compute `log_2(n)` and print the result.\n\nThis computational approach avoids the complexity of manual derivation and provides a reliable way to find the value of `n`.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\n# Increase recursion limit for deep expression trees\nsys.setrecursionlimit(20000)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function encapsulates the entire logic for solving the problem.\n    It defines the necessary classes and functions for SKI combinator logic,\n    parses the expression, reduces it, and computes the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
