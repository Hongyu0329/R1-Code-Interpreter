In the context of Interval Type-3 Membership Functions (IT3 MFs) using Gaussian paradigms, the vertical cross-section at a fixed primary input `x'` is an Interval Type-2 Membership Function (IT2 MF) over the secondary variable `u`. Its upper and lower bounds are defined by the following mathematical formulations:

The **Upper Membership Function (UMF)** of the vertical cross-section is given by:
`μ̄_A(x')(u) = exp(-1/2 * ((u - μ̄_A(x')) / σ_u)²) `
where `μ̄_A(x')` is the value of the upper bound of the primary membership function at `x'`, and `σ_u` is the standard deviation for the secondary variable `u`.

The **Lower Membership Function (LMF)** of the vertical cross-section is given by:
`μ̲_A(x')(u) = exp(-1/2 * ((u - μ̲_A(x')) / σ_u*)²) `
where `μ̲_A(x')` is the value of the lower bound of the primary membership function at `x'`, and `σ_u*` is a modified standard deviation calculated as:
`σ_u* = σ_u * sqrt(ln(l) / ln(ε))`
Here, `l` is a `LowerLag` parameter (`l ∈ [0, 1]`), and `ε` is machine epsilon.
