    "The haiku provided is a riddle describing the events leading to the end of World War II in the Pacific in August 1945. The title, \"The Bays,\" is a question asking for the key locations of these events, which are indeed bays.\n\nThe haiku can be interpreted as follows:\n*   **\"An August tempest\"** refers to the \"rain of ruin\" brought by the atomic bombs. The United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"** points to the date of August 30th (2 x 15 = 30). Around this time, Allied forces began to arrive in Japan, representing a significant \"wind of change.\" The formal occupation of Japan began on August 28th.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"** alludes to the surrender of the Japanese Emperor Hirohito, who was considered a divine figure by his people. The Emperor's announcement of surrender was broadcast to the Japanese people on August 15, 1945.\n\nThe significant events described—the atomic bombings and the subsequent surrender and occupation—are geographically linked to three bays in Japan:\n*   The city of **Hiroshima** is situated on Hiroshima Bay.\n*   The city of **Nagasaki** is located on Nagasaki Bay.\n*   The formal surrender ceremony took place aboard the USS Missouri, which was anchored in **Tokyo Bay** on September 2, 1945.\n\nIn alphabetical order, the answer is:\nHiroshima Bay, Nagasaki Bay, Tokyo Bay\n\n<<<Hiroshima Bay, Nagasaki Bay, Tokyo Bay>>>"
