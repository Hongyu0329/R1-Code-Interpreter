    "According to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797>, opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any period of time. This is because once an ampule is broken, it cannot be resealed, which compromises its sterility.\n\nTherefore, the contents of a single-dose ampule should be used immediately after it is opened in a sterile environment, and any remaining contents must be discarded. There is no Beyond-Use Date (BUD) assigned to a punctured ampule as it is intended for single use and immediate administration.\n\nThis guidance is consistent across various regulatory and professional bodies, including the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) and the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA), which all state that ampules are for one-time use and cannot be stored.\n\n<<<A single-dose ampule has no Beyond-Use Date (BUD) after being punctured in a sterile environment; it must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded.>>>"
