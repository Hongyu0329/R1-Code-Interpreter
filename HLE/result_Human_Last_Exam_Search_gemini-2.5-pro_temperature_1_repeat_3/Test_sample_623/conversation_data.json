    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose goes through glycolysis, zero ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules are released.\n\nGlycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one six-carbon molecule of glucose into two three-carbon molecules of pyruvate. This process does not produce any carbon dioxide (CO₂). The net chemical reaction for glycolysis is:\n\nGlucose + 2 NAD⁺ + 2 ADP + 2 Pi → 2 Pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 H⁺ + 2 ATP + 2 H₂O\n\nAs the equation shows, all six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are present in the two pyruvate molecules at the end of glycolysis.\n\nCO₂ is released in a subsequent step called pyruvate decarboxylation, where pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA before entering the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). To determine if the CO₂ released at this later stage would be labeled, we must trace the position of the ¹³C atoms:\n\n*   **Carbon-1** of glucose becomes **carbon-3** (the methyl carbon) of one pyruvate molecule.\n*   **Carbon-4** of glucose becomes **carbon-1** (the carboxyl carbon) of the other pyruvate molecule.\n\nDuring pyruvate decarboxylation, it is the carboxyl carbon (carbon-1) of pyruvate that is removed and released as CO₂. Therefore, the CO₂ molecule originating from the pyruvate that came from carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose would be ¹³C-labeled. However, this reaction is not part of glycolysis. The question specifically asks about the process of glycolysis, during which no CO₂ is released.\n\n<<<0>>>"
