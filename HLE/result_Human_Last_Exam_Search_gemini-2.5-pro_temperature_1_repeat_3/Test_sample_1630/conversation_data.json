    "The maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n### 1. Defining the Problem\nA fixed point of a function $h(x)$ is a value of $x$ for which $h(x) = x$. In this case, our function is the composition of two polynomials, $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the maximum number of solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n### 2. Determining the Degree of the Composite Polynomial\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3.\nThe degree of the composite function $f(g(x))$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n$deg(f(g(x))) = deg(f) \\times deg(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nThe equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. This is a polynomial equation. Since the degree of $f(g(x))$ is 9, the degree of the polynomial $f(g(x)) - x$ is also 9. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. This establishes an initial upper bound of 9.\n\n### 3. Incorporating the Constraints\nThe problem states that the derivatives $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n*   $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This means that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function.\n*   $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This means that $g(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\nThe derivative of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ can be found using the chain rule:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$\n\nSince $g'(x)$ is always positive, and $f'(y)$ is always positive for any input $y$, $f'(g(x))$ must also be always positive. Therefore, $h'(x)$ is the product of two positive functions, which means $h'(x)$ is also strictly positive for all $x$.\n\n### 4. Using Rolle's Theorem\nThe number of fixed points is the number of roots of the equation $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\nAccording to Rolle's Theorem, if a differentiable function $k(x)$ has $N$ distinct real roots, then its derivative, $k'(x)$, must have at least $N-1$ distinct real roots. This means the number of roots of $k(x)$ is at most one more than the number of roots of its derivative.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $k(x)$:\n$k'(x) = h'(x) - 1 = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$\n\nTo find the maximum number of roots of $k(x)$, we need to find the maximum number of roots of $k'(x)$.\n\n### 5. Analyzing the Derivative's Degree\nLet's determine the degree of the polynomial $k'(x)$:\n*   $f(x) = ax^3 + \\dots$ (with $a \\neq 0$)\n*   $g(x) = px^3 + \\dots$ (with $p \\neq 0$)\n*   $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + \\dots$ (degree 2)\n*   $g'(x) = 3px^2 + \\dots$ (degree 2)\n\nThe term $f'(g(x))$ involves substituting the degree-3 polynomial $g(x)$ into the degree-2 polynomial $f'(x)$. The degree of $f'(g(x))$ is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n\nThe degree of $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is the sum of the degrees of $f'(g(x))$ and $g'(x)$, which is $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nSo, $k'(x) = h'(x) - 1$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots.\n\n### 6. Final Conclusion\nSince $k'(x)$ can have at most 8 real roots, by Rolle's Theorem, $k(x)$ can have at most $8 + 1 = 9$ real roots.\n\nIt can be shown that it is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ has exactly 9 real roots. This confirms that the maximum number of fixed points is indeed 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
