    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is determined by the structure of its Weyl group and the action of the Frobenius endomorphism.\n\nThe $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ are classified up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy by the $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$. An $F$-conjugacy class is an orbit of the action where $w \\in W$ is sent to $x w F(x)^{-1}$ for some $x \\in W$, with $F$ being the Frobenius action on $W$.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This has a significant consequence: any reductive group of type $E_8$ over a finite field is necessarily of the split (or Chevalley) type. In the case of a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$.\n\nWhen the Frobenius action is trivial, the condition for $F$-conjugacy, $w' = x w F(x)^{-1}$, simplifies to the standard definition of a conjugacy class, $w' = x w x^{-1}$. Therefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is simply the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the group $W(E_8)$. This is a well-established result in the theory of reflection groups. The conjugacy classes of Weyl groups were famously determined by Roger Carter. For the Weyl group of type $E_8$, the number of conjugacy classes is 112.\n\nTherefore, for any prime power $q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
