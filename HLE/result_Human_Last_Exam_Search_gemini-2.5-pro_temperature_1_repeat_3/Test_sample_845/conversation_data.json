    "The value computed between consecutive heartbeats is most commonly called the **inter-beat interval (IBI)**. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of the variation in the time of these intervals.\n\nWhen using different measurement technologies, the terminology for this interval can be more specific:\n*   **R-R Interval (RRI):** When measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG), the value is the time between successive R-peaks of the QRS complex. The ECG is considered the gold standard for measuring HRV.\n*   **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI) or Inter-Pulse Interval (IPI):** When derived from a photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal, which detects blood volume changes, the value is the time between consecutive pulse waves. The analysis of the variability in these intervals is technically called Pulse Rate Variability (PRV), which is used as a surrogate for HRV.\n\nIn essence, while IBI is the general term, the specific value derived from PPG is the pulse-to-pulse interval.\n\n<<<inter-beat interval (IBI) or pulse-to-pulse interval (PPI)>>>"
