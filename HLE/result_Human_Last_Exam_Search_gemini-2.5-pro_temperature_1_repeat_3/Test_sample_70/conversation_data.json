    "To identify which flags of African nations share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, a two-step process is required. First, the maximal rank of the Danish flag must be determined. Second, the flags of all 54 African nations must be analyzed to find those with a matching rank.\n\n### Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nThe flag of Denmark, the Dannebrog, consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. To determine its maximal linear algebraic rank, the flag is modeled as a matrix where different colors are assigned distinct numerical values. A simplified matrix representation where 'a' represents red and 'b' represents white would be:\n\n```\na b a\nb b b\na b a\n```\n\nThe rows of this matrix are the vectors [a, b, a] and [b, b, b]. Since the first and third rows are identical, the rank of the matrix is determined by the number of linearly independent vectors in the set {[a, b, a], [b, b, b]}. Assuming 'a' and 'b' are distinct non-zero values to maximize the rank, these two vectors are linearly independent. Therefore, the maximal linear algebraic rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n### African Flags with Rank 2\n\nA national flag will have a maximal rank of 2 if its design consists of patterns that can be described by two, and only two, linearly independent row or column vectors. This is in contrast to flags with simple horizontal or vertical stripes, which have a rank of 1, and flags with more complex designs like multiple chevrons, triangles, or intricate emblems, which typically have a rank of 3 or higher.\n\nBased on an analysis of the designs of the 54 recognized national flags of Africa, the following 17 countries have flags with a maximal linear algebraic rank of 2, matching that of Denmark.\n\nThe designs of these flags fall into several distinct patterns that result in a rank of 2:\n\n*   **Horizontal or vertical divisions with an emblem:** This includes tricolor flags with a central emblem on one of the stripes, or bicolors with an emblem on the dividing line.\n*   **A field with a contrasting vertical and horizontal element:** This pattern involves a vertical band at the hoist with horizontal stripes on the fly.\n*   **A monochrome field with a central emblem or corner element:** This includes flags with a solid color background and a simple emblem or a distinct element in one of the corners.\n\nHere is the list of the identified African nations:\n\n*   **Algeria:** The flag has two vertical bars of green and white, with a red star and crescent in the center.\n*   **Benin:** The flag features two horizontal stripes of yellow and red on the fly side, and a vertical green band at the hoist.\n*   **Burkina Faso:** This flag is a horizontal bicolor of red and green with a yellow five-pointed star in the center.\n*   **Cameroon:** A vertical tricolor of green, red, and yellow, with a yellow star located in the central red stripe.\n*   **Egypt:** A horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black, with the golden Eagle of Saladin in the center white stripe.\n*   **Ethiopia:** This flag is a green, yellow, and red horizontal tricolor with the national emblem, a blue disk with a yellow pentagram, in the center.\n*   **Ghana:** A horizontal tricolor of red, yellow, and green with a black five-pointed star in the middle of the yellow stripe.\n*   **Guinea-Bissau:** The design includes a vertical red band with a black star at the hoist, and two horizontal stripes of yellow and green.\n*   **Lesotho:** A horizontal tricolor of blue, white, and green, with a black *mokorotlo* (a traditional Basotho hat) in the center.\n*   **Libya:** This flag consists of a horizontal tricolor of red, black, and green, with a white star and crescent in the central black stripe.\n*   **Madagascar:** Features a vertical white stripe at the hoist with horizontal stripes of red and green.\n*   **Malawi:** A horizontal tricolor of black, red, and green, with a red rising sun in the top black stripe.\n*   **Mauritania:** A green field, with a gold crescent and star, and red stripes at the top and bottom.\n*   **Niger:** This flag is a horizontal tricolor of orange, white, and green, with an orange circle in the center of the white stripe.\n*   **Rwanda:** Comprised of three horizontal stripes of blue, yellow, and green, with a yellow sun in the top-right corner.\n*   **Senegal:** A vertical tricolor of green, yellow, and red with a green star in the central yellow stripe.\n*   **Somalia:** A light blue field with a single white five-pointed star in the center.\n\n<<<Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia>>>"
