    "The largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that can fit inside a cube with an edge length of 15 is 351.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the calculation:\n*   The volume of the large cube is 15 x 15 x 15 = 3375 cubic units.\n*   The volume of a single block is 9 x 1 x 1 = 9 cubic units.\n*   In theory, the maximum number of blocks would be the total volume of the cube divided by the volume of a single block: 3375 / 9 = 375 blocks.\n\nHowever, a perfect packing of 375 blocks is not possible. For a rectangular prism to be perfectly tiled by smaller bricks, the length of the brick must evenly divide at least one of the dimensions of the prism. In this case, 9 does not divide 15. This means there will inevitably be some wasted space.\n\nA practical method for packing the blocks yields 351:\n1.  **First Section:** A volume of 9 x 15 x 15 is filled with blocks oriented along the 9-unit dimension. This accommodates (9/9) x 15 x 15 = 225 blocks.\n2.  **Second Section:** The remaining space is a 6 x 15 x 15 volume. Blocks can be placed with their 9-unit length along one of the 15-unit dimensions. This fills a 6 x 9 x 15 section with (6/1) x (9/9) x 15 = 90 blocks.\n3.  **Third Section:** The new remaining space is a 6 x 6 x 15 volume. The blocks must be oriented along the 15-unit dimension. This fills a 6 x 6 x 9 section with (6/1) x (6/1) x (9/9) = 36 blocks.\n4.  **Wasted Space:** This leaves a final remaining volume of 6 x 6 x 6. A 9 x 1 x 1 block cannot fit into this space, as its longest side (9) is greater than any dimension of the remaining volume (6).\n\nBy adding the blocks from each section (225 + 90 + 36), we arrive at a total of 351 blocks.\n\n<<<351>>>"
