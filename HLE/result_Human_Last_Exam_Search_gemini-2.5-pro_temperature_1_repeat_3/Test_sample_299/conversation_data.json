    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification:\n\n### 1. Properties of the Function *f*\n\nFirst, we deduce the fundamental properties of any such function $f$.\n*   **Injectivity**: The function $f$ must be one-to-one (injective). If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is strictly increasing, this implies $x_1 = x_2$.\n*   **Monotonicity**: A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. Therefore, $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n### 2. The Case of a Strictly Decreasing Function\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function. A composition of two decreasing functions is an increasing function, and indeed, $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing.\n\nHowever, a strictly decreasing continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ leads to a contradiction:\n1.  Let $M = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $M$ can be a finite real number or $+\\infty$.\n2.  Taking the limit of the equation as $x \\to -\\infty$:\n    $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y \\to M} f(y)$.\n    $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\exp(x) = 0$.\n3.  Therefore, we must have $\\lim_{y \\to M} f(y) = 0$.\n4.  If $M = +\\infty$, then $\\lim_{y \\to \\infty} f(y) = 0$. But as a decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, if $f$ has a finite limit at $+\\infty$, its limit at $-\\infty$ must be greater. This doesn't yet yield a contradiction.\n5.  Let's consider the fixed point of $f$. A strictly decreasing continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must have a unique fixed point $x_0$ where $f(x_0)=x_0$. If such a point exists, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. This would imply $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. However, the equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions (since $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$). Therefore, $f$ cannot have a fixed point. This proves that no strictly decreasing continuous function can satisfy the condition.\n\nAn alternative way to see the contradiction is by using the identity $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$. For a decreasing function $f$, there must be a point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)=x_0$. Then $e^{x_0} = f(f(x_0))=f(x_0)=x_0$, which is impossible.\n\nThus, there are **no solutions** that are strictly decreasing.\n\n### 3. The Case of a Strictly Increasing Function\n\nNow, assume $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function.\n1.  Since $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, the range of $f \\circ f$ is $(0, \\infty)$. This implies that the range of $f$ must also be a subset of $(0, \\infty)$, because if $f(y) \\le 0$ for some $y$, then $y$ cannot be in the range of $f$. Thus, $f$ is a strictly increasing function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $(0, \\infty)$.\n2.  The problem of finding such a function, known as the functional square root or half-iterate of the exponential function, is a classic problem in functional equations. It has been shown that not only do solutions exist, but there are infinitely many.\n3.  The number of such functions can be determined by considering a construction method. It can be shown that constructing such a function $f$ is equivalent to constructing a strictly increasing solution $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ to the simpler functional equation $g(g(y)) = y+1$.\n4.  A family of solutions for $g(g(y)) = y+1$ can be built as follows:\n    *   Choose a constant $c \\in (0, 1)$.\n    *   Choose any strictly increasing continuous function $\\phi$ that maps the interval $[0, c]$ onto $[c, 1]$. This is a homeomorphism from $[0,c]$ to $[c,1]$.\n    *   Define $g(y)$ on $[0, c]$ as $g(y) = \\phi(y)$.\n    *   For $y \\in (c, 1]$, define $g(y) = \\phi^{-1}(y) + 1$.\n    *   Extend $g$ to all of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the relation $g(y+1) = g(y)+1$.\n5.  This construction yields a valid, strictly increasing, continuous solution $g(y)$ for every choice of $c$ and $\\phi$.\n6.  The number of choices for the function $\\phi$ needs to be determined. A continuous function is determined by its values on a dense set, like the rational numbers. The number of ways to define an increasing function from the rationals in $[0, c]$ to the reals in $[c, 1]$ is at least the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. More formally, the set of all continuous functions from a real interval to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. The subset of these that are strictly increasing also has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSince for each choice of an increasing homeomorphism $\\phi$ (of which there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices), a unique increasing solution $f$ to the original equation is generated, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such solutions. The total number of continuous functions on $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$, so there can be no more than $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions.\n\nBy the Cantor-Bernstein theorem, the cardinality of the set of strictly increasing solutions is precisely $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe set of solutions contains no decreasing functions and has a set of increasing functions with cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, the total cardinality of the set of solutions is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<$\\mathfrak{c}$>>>"
