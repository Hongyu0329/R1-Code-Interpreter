    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we follow a systematic approach by analyzing the structure of these characters.\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\nSo, $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### 2. Decomposition of Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi_i$ for each prime power factor of $N$. Let\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$\nwhere:\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2 = 4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2 = 9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its constituent characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\n\nWe are looking for characters of order 6. This imposes two conditions on the orders of the component characters, $k_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$:\n1.  Each $k_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders $\\{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4, k_5\\}$ must contain at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3.\n\n### 3. Analyzing Characters for Each Prime Power\nWe now determine the number of possible choices for each $\\chi_i$ based on its modulus and the required order properties. The number of primitive characters of a specific order is related to Euler's totient function, $\\phi$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$):** The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is a cyclic group of order 2. There is one primitive character, and its order is 2. This order divides 6. So, there is **1** choice for $\\chi_1$.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$):** The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(9) = 6$. The primitive characters are those whose order does not divide $\\phi(3)=2$. Thus, the primitive characters have orders 3 and 6. Both of these orders divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    This gives a total of $2 + 2 = \\textbf{4}$ choices for $\\chi_2$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7:** The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. Their orders can be 2, 3, or 6, all of which divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    This gives a total of $1 + 2 + 2 = \\textbf{5}$ choices for $\\chi_3$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11:** The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(11) = 10$. The orders of primitive characters can be 2, 5, or 10. The only one of these that divides 6 is 2.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    This gives **1** choice for $\\chi_4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13:** The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(13) = 12$. The orders of primitive characters can be 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12. The orders that divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    This gives a total of $1 + 2 + 2 = \\textbf{5}$ choices for $\\chi_5$.\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\nTo have an overall order of 6, the lcm of the individual orders must be 6.\n*   The choice for $\\chi_1$ ensures its order is 2. This satisfies the requirement for the lcm to be a multiple of 2.\n*   The choices for $\\chi_2$ ensure its order is either 3 or 6, which is always a multiple of 3. This satisfies the requirement for the lcm to be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the order of any selected $\\chi_1$ is a multiple of 2 and the order of any selected $\\chi_2$ is a multiple of 3, the lcm of the orders of the five characters will always be a multiple of 6. As all individual orders are divisors of 6, their lcm must also divide 6. Therefore, the lcm is guaranteed to be exactly 6 for any combination of the allowed characters.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of characters = (choices for $\\chi_1$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_2$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_3$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_5$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
