    "A standard 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total. The edge squares are those on the first and last rows and the first and last files. This gives a total of 28 edge squares (8+8+6+6). These 28 squares are evenly divided into 14 dark squares and 14 light squares.\n\nThe game's objective is to place the maximum number of bishops on these edge squares. Since the two players are working together to achieve this common goal, they will place bishops in a way that none can attack each other.\n\nA crucial rule of chess is that bishops move and attack diagonally, meaning a bishop on a dark square can only ever attack pieces on other dark squares, and a bishop on a light square can only attack pieces on other light squares. This effectively separates the problem into two independent puzzles: one for the 14 dark edge squares and one for the 14 light edge squares.\n\nFor each set of 14 squares (dark and light), the challenge is to find the maximum number of bishops that can be placed without any two threatening each other. This is a classic combinatorial problem known as the maximum independent set problem.\n\nBy analyzing the attack patterns of bishops on the 14 dark edge squares, it's determined that a maximum of 7 bishops can be placed. A similar analysis for the 14 light edge squares also yields a maximum of 7 bishops.\n\nTherefore, the total number of bishops the two players can place on the edge squares is the sum of the maximums for the dark and light squares, which is 7 + 7 = 14.\n\nTo find the number of edge squares without bishops, we subtract the total number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares:\n\nNumber of empty edge squares = 28 (total edge squares) - 14 (placed bishops) = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
