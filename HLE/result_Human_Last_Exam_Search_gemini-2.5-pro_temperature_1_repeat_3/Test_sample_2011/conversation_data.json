    "Let G be a graph with n = 128 vertices. The question asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs of G.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the key terms:\n*   An **induced subgraph** H of a graph G is a graph formed from a subset of vertices of G and *all* of the edges connecting pairs of vertices in that subset.\n*   A **clique** is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. This means the subgraph induced by a clique is a complete graph (K_k). The size of the clique is the number of vertices in it.\n\nLet S(G) be the set of integers `k` such that G contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to a complete graph on `k` vertices (K_k). In other words, S(G) is the set of all possible clique sizes in G. The problem is to find the maximum possible value of |S(G)| over all graphs G with 128 vertices.\n\nLet ω(G) be the **clique number** of G, which is the size of the largest clique in G. By definition, ω(G) is the maximum value in the set S(G).\n\nNow, consider a graph G that has a clique C of size ω(G). This clique is a set of ω(G) vertices that are all connected to each other. If we take any subset C' of C with size `k`, where 1 ≤ k ≤ ω(G), the vertices in C' are also all connected to each other. Therefore, C' is also a clique in G, and its size is `k`.\n\nThis has a crucial consequence: if a graph G contains a clique of size ω(G), it must also contain cliques of all integer sizes from 1 to ω(G). This is because any `k`-vertex subset of the maximum clique forms a `k`-clique.\n\nTherefore, the set of all possible clique sizes in any graph G is S(G) = {1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}. The number of different clique sizes is simply the clique number, |S(G)| = ω(G).\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible clique number, ω(G), for a graph G with n = 128 vertices. The clique number of any graph cannot exceed its number of vertices. Thus, for any graph G on 128 vertices, ω(G) ≤ 128.\n\nThis maximum value is achieved by the **complete graph** K_128, which is the graph on 128 vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\nFor G = K_128:\n*   The largest clique consists of all 128 vertices, so ω(K_128) = 128.\n*   For any integer `k` from 1 to 128, we can select any `k` vertices, and they will form an induced K_k (a clique of size `k`).\n*   Therefore, the set of clique sizes is S(K_128) = {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}.\n*   The number of different clique sizes is |S(K_128)| = 128.\n\nSince no graph on 128 vertices can have a clique number greater than 128, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
