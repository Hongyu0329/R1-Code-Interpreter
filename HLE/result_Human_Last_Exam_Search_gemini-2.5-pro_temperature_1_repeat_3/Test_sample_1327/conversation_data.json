    "The user wants to find the next number in the sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n\nI have performed a search and found some potentially related sequences, but not an exact match for the pattern.\n\nLet's re-analyze the sequence and the relationships between the terms.\nSequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119\n\nLet's try to find a pattern of the form `x_n = a * x_(n-1) + b_n`.\n\nIf a = 2:\n11 = 2 * 2 + 7\n23 = 2 * 11 + 1\n51 = 2 * 23 + 5\n119 = 2 * 51 + 17\nThe sequence `b_n` is 7, 1, 5, 17. There is no obvious simple pattern here.\n\nIf a = 3:\n11 = 3 * 2 + 5\n23 = 3 * 11 - 10\n51 = 3 * 23 - 18\n119 = 3 * 51 - 34\nThe sequence `b_n` is 5, -10, -18, -34. Not a simple pattern.\n\nLet's look at a different kind of pattern.\nA Quora answer for a similar sequence `2, 11, 38, 119` suggests a pattern `x_n = 3 * x_(n-1) + 5`. Let's check that.\n11 = 3*2 + 5 (Correct)\n38 is not in our sequence. So this is not the pattern.\n\nAnother Quora answer for `2, 11, 21, 32` suggests a pattern where the difference increases by 1 each time.\n11 - 2 = 9\n21 - 11 = 10\n32 - 21 = 11\nThis is not our sequence.\n\nA similar sequence `2, 5, 11, 23, 47` has a pattern where the difference doubles each time (3, 6, 12, 24). This is also not our sequence.\n\nLet's go back to the pattern `x_n = 2 * x_(n-1) + k`.\nx1 = 2\nx2 = 2 * x1 + 7 = 11\nx3 = 2 * x2 + 1 = 23\nx4 = 2 * x3 + 5 = 51\nx5 = 2 * x4 + 17 = 119\nThe sequence of `k` is 7, 1, 5, 17. This is not simple.\n\nLet's try another one. Maybe `x_n = 2 * x_(n-1) +/- k`.\n11 = 2 * 2 + 7\n23 = 2 * 11 + 1\n51 = 2 * 23 + 5\n119 = 2 * 51 + 17\n\nWhat if the pattern is `x_n = x_(n-1) + x_(n-2) + k`?\n23 = 11 + 2 + 10\n51 = 23 + 11 + 17\n119 = 51 + 23 + 45\nThe sequence `k` is 10, 17, 45. No clear pattern.\n\nLet's look at the sequence again: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\nA different Quora answer for the sequence `9, 11, ?, 51, 119, 249` provides a clue.\nThe proposed solution for that sequence is:\n11 = 9*1 + 2\n23 = 11*2 + 1\n51 = 23*2 + 5\n119 = 51*2 + 17\n249 = 119*2 + 11\nThe pattern seems to be `x_n = 2 * x_(n-1) + k` but the `k` values are `1, 5, 7, 11`. The person asking for the pattern on Quora questions where these numbers came from. The sequence in the Quora post is slightly different from the user's (`9` instead of `2` at the start, and `249` at the end).\n\nLet's re-examine my initial analysis of `x_n = 2 * x_(n-1) + k`.\nx1 = 2\nx2 = 11 = 2 * 2 + 7\nx3 = 23 = 2 * 11 + 1\nx4 = 51 = 2 * 23 + 5\nx5 = 119 = 2 * 51 + 17\nThe sequence of added numbers `k` is 7, 1, 5, 17. I still don't see a pattern here.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's reconsider the differences.\nDifferences: 9, 12, 28, 68\nLet's try to express these differences using powers.\n9 = 3^2\n12\n28\n68\nThis doesn't seem to lead anywhere.\n\nLet's try another common pattern: `x_n = 2*x_(n-1) + c` or `x_n = 2*x_(n-1) - c`.\nLet's see:\n11 = 2*2 + 7\n23 = 2*11 + 1\nLet's try `y_n = 2 * y_(n-1) +/- k`\n11 = 2 * 2 + 7\n23 = 2 * 11 + 1.  No.\n\nLet's try `x_n = 3 * x_(n-1) +/- k`\n11 = 3 * 2 + 5\n23 = 3 * 11 - 10\n51 = 3 * 23 - 18\n119 = 3 * 51 - 34\nThe sequence of k is 5, -10, -18, -34. Differences are -15, -8, -16. Still no obvious pattern.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure of the numbers themselves.\n2\n11\n23\n51\n119\nThese are close to `2 * previous number`.\n11 = 2*2 + 7\n23 = 2*11 + 1\n51 = 2*23 + 5\n119 = 2*51 + 17\n\nLet's re-examine my very first idea.\n11 = 2*2 + 7\n23 = 2*11 + 1\n51 = 2*23 + 5\n119 = 2*51 + 17\nThe added values are 7, 1, 5, 17. Is there a hidden pattern? Maybe not a simple arithmetic one. Let's look at the Quora answer again. That person suggested `x_n = 2*x_(n-1) + k` where k was a sequence of prime numbers, but it didn't quite fit.\n\nLet's try to work backwards from the options.\nIf the next term is 291 (A):\n119 * 2 + k = 291\n238 + k = 291\nk = 53\nSo the sequence of added numbers would be 7, 1, 5, 17, 53.\n\nIf the next term is 285 (B):\n119 * 2 + k = 285\n238 + k = 285\nk = 47\nSo the sequence of added numbers would be 7, 1, 5, 17, 47.\n\nIf the next term is 171 (C):\n119 * 2 + k = 171 => k is negative. This is unlikely.\n\nIf the next term is 167 (D):\n119 * 2 + k = 167 => k is negative. This is unlikely.\n\nSo the pattern is likely `x_n = 2*x_(n-1) + k` or something similar, and the answer is likely A or B.\nLet's look at the sequence of k's again: 7, 1, 5, 17. This is very strange.\n\nLet me rethink the whole pattern.\nSequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119\nLet's try `x_(n+1) = 2*x_n + a` and `x_(n+2) = 2*x_(n+1) - b`\n11 = 2*2 + 7\n23 = 2*11 + 1\n51 = 2*23 + 5\n119 = 2*51 + 17\n\nThere must be a mistake in my analysis or a very obscure pattern. Let me try a different relation.\n`x_n * 2 + some_constant`\n2*2 + 7 = 11\n11*2 + 1 = 23\n23*2 + 5 = 51\n51*2 + 17 = 119\n\nLet's try `x_n * 2 + some_sequence`\n`x_1 = 2`\n`x_2 = 2*x_1 + 7 = 11`\n`x_3 = 2*x_2 + 1 = 23`\n`x_4 = 2*x_3 + 5 = 51`\n`x_5 = 2*x_4 + 17 = 119`\nThe sequence of added numbers is `7, 1, 5, 17`.\nThis is not a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence. Let me search for this specific sequence of numbers `7, 1, 5, 17`.\n\nI'll try another search on the original sequence, perhaps formulated differently.\n\nLet's try a different base pattern. `x_(n+1) = 3*x_n - k`\n11 = 3*2 + 5\n23 = 3*11 - 10\n51 = 3*23 - 18\n119 = 3*51 - 34\nThe sequence k is 5, 10, 18, 34.\nLet's look at the differences of this k sequence.\n10 - 5 = 5\n18 - 10 = 8\n34 - 18 = 16\nThe differences are 5, 8, 16. This is not a clear pattern either (close to 2^n but not quite).\n\nLet's go back to the most promising pattern `x_(n+1) = 2*x_n + k`.\nLet's reconsider the numbers being added: 7, 1, 5, 17. I was too quick to dismiss it.\nLet's look at the differences: -6, 4, 12.\nDifferences of differences: 10, 8.\n\nOkay, let's try a completely different approach.\nMaybe it is an alternating series.\nx1 = 2\nx2 = 11\nx3 = 23 = 2*11 + 1\nx4 = 51\nx5 = 119 = 2*51 - 17. Wait, 119 = 2*51 + 17.\n\nLet's assume there's a simple logical error in my initial calculation.\n11 = 2 * 2 + 7\n23 = 2 * 11 + 1. Okay.\n51 = 2 * 23 + 5. Okay.\n119 = 2 * 51 + 17. Okay.\nThe sequence of added numbers is `7, 1, 5, 17`. There is no simple arithmetic or geometric relationship. It is not a sequence of primes. It is not a sequence of powers of 2.\n\nWhat if the pattern is `x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + (-1)^n * k`?\n11 = 2 * 2 + 7\n23 = 2 * 11 + 1\n51 = 2 * 23 + 5\n119 = 2 * 51 + 17\nThis doesn't seem to be the case.\n\nLet's try to find another pattern in the search results that might match.\nThe search results show similar problems but not this exact one.\n\nLet's try to think outside the box.\n2, 11, 23, 51, 119\nThe numbers are all odd after the first one.\n\nLet's try to relate them to powers of 2 again, but differently.\n2 = 2^2 - 2\n11 = 2^4 - 5\n23 = 2^5 - 9\n51 = 2^6 - 13\n119 = 2^7 - 9\nThe subtracted numbers are 2, 5, 9, 13, 9. The differences are 3, 4, 4, -4. Doesn't work.\n\nLet's try `y = 2x + a`, `z = 2.5y + b`... No, too complex.\n\nLet me assume the pattern is simpler and I'm missing it.\n2\n11 (2*5 + 1)\n23 (11*2 + 1)\n51 (23*2 + 5)\n119 (51*2 + 17)\nThe search from `sankar`'s blog had a very similar sequence: `9, 11, ?, 51, 119, 249`. The proposed solution was `11=9*1+2`, `23=11*2+1`, `51=23*2+5`, `119=51*2+17`, `249=119*2+11`. The multipliers are `1, 2, 2, 2, 2`. The added numbers are `2, 1, 5, 17, 11`. The author of the comment was asked to explain the source of `2,1,5,7,11` (he made a typo, it was 17). It's possible the pattern is `*2 + k` but `k` is not a simple sequence.\n\nLet's revisit `x_(n+1) = 3*x_n - k`.\nk sequence: 5, 10, 18, 34.\nDifferences: 5, 8, 16.\nThis is `5`, `5+3`, `8+8`. Let's try `5`, `5+2^1+1`, `8+2^3`. Doesn't seem right.\nWhat if the difference pattern is `3, 8, ...`? No.\nWhat if the differences of `k` are `5, 8, 16`? The next difference should be `32`?\nThen the next `k` would be `34 + 32 = 66`.\nThe next term in the main sequence would be `3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`.\nThis gives option A.\n\nLet's verify this pattern.\nSequence `x_n`: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119\n`x_(n+1) = 3*x_n - k_n`\n`k_1 = 3*2 - 11 = -5`. This is not right. It should be `x_(n+1) = 3*x_n - k_(n+1)`.\nNo, let's define it as `x_n = 3 * x_(n-1) - k_n`.\n`k_2 = 3*x_1 - x_2 = 3*2 - 11 = -5`.\n`k_3 = 3*x_2 - x_3 = 3*11 - 23 = 33 - 23 = 10`.\n`k_4 = 3*x_3 - x_4 = 3*23 - 51 = 69 - 51 = 18`.\n`k_5 = 3*x_4 - x_5 = 3*51 - 119 = 153 - 119 = 34`.\nSo the sequence of `k` is `-5, 10, 18, 34`.\nLet's look at the differences of this `k` sequence.\n`10 - (-5) = 15`\n`18 - 10 = 8`\n`34 - 18 = 16`\nThe differences are `15, 8, 16`. This does not look like a consistent pattern.\n\nLet's try another pattern. Maybe `x_(n+1) = 2*x_n + x_(n-1) ...`\n`23 = 2*11 + 2`? No.\n`23 = 2*11 + 1`.\n`51 = 2*23 + 5`.\n`119 = 2*51 + 17`.\n\nLet's try to find a pattern in `1, 5, 17`.\nThe pattern seems to be `x_n = 2*x_{n-1} + k`.\nLet's look at the sequence starting from the second term: 11, 23, 51, 119.\n`23 = 2*11 + 1`\n`51 = 2*23 + 5`\n`119 = 2*51 + 17`\nThe added numbers are `1, 5, 17`.\nLet's look at the differences here: `4, 12`. This is `4*1`, `4*3`. The next difference could be `4*5 = 20` or `4*9 = 36`.\nIf the next difference is 20, the next added number is `17 + 20 = 37`.\nThen the next term of the sequence is `2 * 119 + 37 = 238 + 37 = 275`. Not in the options.\nIf the next difference is 36, the next added number is `17 + 36 = 53`.\nThen the next term of the sequence is `2 * 119 + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291`. This is option A.\n\nLet's re-verify this hypothesis.\nThe sequence is `x_n`.\n`x_3 = 2*x_2 + k_1` where `k_1=1`\n`x_4 = 2*x_3 + k_2` where `k_2=5`\n`x_5 = 2*x_4 + k_3` where `k_3=17`\n`x_6 = 2*x_5 + k_4` where `k_4=?`\n\nThe sequence `k` is `1, 5, 17`.\nThe differences of `k` are `d_1 = 5-1=4`, `d_2 = 17-5=12`.\nThe sequence of differences `d` is `4, 12`.\nThis looks like a geometric progression with a factor of 3.\nSo the next difference `d_3` would be `12 * 3 = 36`.\nThen `k_4 = k_3 + d_3 = 17 + 36 = 53`.\nThen the next term in the main sequence `x_6` would be `2 * x_5 + k_4 = 2 * 119 + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n\nThis seems like a plausible and consistent mathematical pattern.\nThe first term `2` is a bit of an outlier to this specific pattern `x_n = 2*x_{n-1} + k_n`, since `11 = 2*2 + 7`, and 7 doesn't fit the `k` sequence. However, in number series problems, it's common for the pattern to establish itself from the second or third term.\n\nLet's assume this pattern is correct.\nThe sequence is defined by:\n`x_1 = 2`\n`x_2 = 11`\nFor n > 2: `x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + k_{n-2}`\nwhere `k_1 = 1`, and `k_m = k_{m-1} + 4 * 3^(m-2)` for `m > 1`.\nLet's check:\n`k_2 = k_1 + 4 * 3^0 = 1 + 4 = 5`. Correct.\n`k_3 = k_2 + 4 * 3^1 = 5 + 12 = 17`. Correct.\n`k_4 = k_3 + 4 * 3^2 = 17 + 36 = 53`.\nSo, `x_6 = 2 * x_5 + k_4 = 2 * 119 + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n\nThis provides a solid argument for 291.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  Assume a pattern of the form `x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + C_n`.\n2.  Calculate the values of `C_n` for the given sequence.\n    - `11 = 2 * 2 + 7`\n    - `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`\n    - `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`\n    - `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`\n3.  Notice that the pattern for `C_n` becomes regular from the second step (`1, 5, 17`).\n4.  Analyze the sequence `k = (1, 5, 17)`.\n5.  Find the differences between the terms of `k`: `4, 12`.\n6.  Hypothesize that the differences form a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.\n7.  Calculate the next difference: `12 * 3 = 36`.\n8.  Calculate the next term in the `k` sequence: `17 + 36 = 53`.\n9.  Calculate the next term in the main sequence: `2 * 119 + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n10. This matches option A.\n\nThe logic holds together.\n\nFinal answer seems to be A.\nThe pattern can be described as follows:\nStarting from the second term, the next number is obtained by multiplying the current number by 2 and adding a value. This added value is part of a sequence (let's call it k).\nThe sequence of operations is:\n- 11 * 2 + 1 = 23\n- 23 * 2 + 5 = 51\n- 51 * 2 + 17 = 119\nThe sequence of added numbers `k` is 1, 5, 17.\nTo find the next term in `k`, we look at the differences between its terms:\n- 5 - 1 = 4\n- 17 - 5 = 12\nThe differences are 4 and 12. This is a geometric progression where the next difference is 12 * 3 = 36.\nTherefore, the next term in sequence `k` is 17 + 36 = 53.\nFinally, the next term in the main sequence is:\n- 119 * 2 + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291.\nThis corresponds to option A.\nTherefore, A is the correct answer.The pattern in the sequence is determined by the relationship between consecutive terms. Let's analyze the sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n\nThe pattern can be described by the formula: `Next Term = 2 * Current Term + k`, where `k` changes with each step.\n\nLet's see how this works for the given sequence:\n*   To get from 2 to 11: `2 * 2 + 7 = 11`\n*   To get from 11 to 23: `2 * 11 + 1 = 23`\n*   To get from 23 to 51: `2 * 23 + 5 = 51`\n*   To get from 51 to 119: `2 * 51 + 17 = 119`\n\nThe sequence of the numbers added (`k`) is 7, 1, 5, 17.  A clear pattern for `k` isn't immediately obvious with the first term. However, if we look at the sequence of `k` starting from the second step (1, 5, 17), a pattern emerges. Let's analyze this new sequence: 1, 5, 17.\n\nNow, let's find the differences between the terms in this sequence `k`:\n*   `5 - 1 = 4`\n*   `17 - 5 = 12`\n\nThe differences are 4 and 12. This suggests a geometric progression where each difference is 3 times the previous one.\n*   `4 * 3 = 12`\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should be:\n*   `12 * 3 = 36`\n\nNow, we can find the next term in the sequence `k` by adding this new difference to the last term of `k`:\n*   `17 + 36 = 53`\n\nFinally, we can find the next term in the original sequence by applying the initial formula (`Next Term = 2 * Current Term + k`) with the new value of `k`:\n*   `2 * 119 + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291`\n\nTherefore, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
