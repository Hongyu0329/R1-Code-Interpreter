    "The Grigorchuk group, denoted by G, has a rich and complex subgroup structure. To determine the number of subgroups of index 4, we can analyze the homomorphisms from G to the symmetric group S4. Since G is a 2-group (meaning every element has an order that is a power of 2), any finite quotient of G must also be a 2-group. A subgroup of index 4 gives rise to a homomorphism into S4 whose image is a transitive subgroup of order being a power of 2. The transitive subgroups of S4 are the cyclic group of order 4 (C4), the Klein four-group (V4), the dihedral group of order 8 (D8), the alternating group A4, and the symmetric group S4. The only of these that are 2-groups are C4, V4, and D8.\n\nThe abelianization of the Grigorchuk group, which is the quotient group G/[G,G] where [G,G] is the derived subgroup, is known to be isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, i.e., (C₂)³. Any homomorphism from G to an abelian group must factor through this abelianization.\n\nA subgroup H is of index 4 in G if the quotient group G/H has order 4. Since all groups of order 4 are abelian, the derived subgroup [G,G] must be a subgroup of H for any subgroup H of index 4. This implies that all subgroups of index 4 are normal subgroups.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of normal subgroups of index 4. These subgroups are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of index 4 in the abelianization G/[G,G] ≅ (C₂)³. A subgroup of index 4 in (C₂)³, which has order 8, is a subgroup of order 2.\n\nTo find the number of subgroups of order 2 in (C₂)³, we need to count the number of non-identity elements and divide by the number of generators for each subgroup. In (C₂)³, every non-identity element has order 2 and generates a unique subgroup of order 2. The group (C₂)³ has 2³ = 8 elements. Excluding the identity element, there are 7 elements of order 2. Each of these generates a distinct subgroup of order 2.\n\nThus, there are 7 subgroups of order 2 in (C₂)³. Each of these corresponds to a unique normal subgroup of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n\n<<<7>>>"
