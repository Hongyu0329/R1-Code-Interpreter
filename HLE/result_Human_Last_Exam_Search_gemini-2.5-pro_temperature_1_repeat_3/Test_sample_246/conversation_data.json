    "The minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of the 4-sphere ($S^4$) over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is one.\n\nThis result is determined by applying a theorem from knot theory concerning the fundamental groups of branched covers of twist-spun knots. The process involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the components**: The problem involves the trefoil knot, and the \"5-twist-spun\" construction indicates that the number of twists, denoted as *n*, is 5.\n\n2.  **Determine the knot determinant**: The determinant of a knot is a classic invariant. For the trefoil knot, the determinant is 3.\n\n3.  **Apply Suzuki's Theorem**: A key theorem by Shin'ichi Suzuki describes the fundamental group of the 2-fold branched cover of $S^4$ over an *n*-twist-spun knot. It states that this group fits into a mathematical structure called a short exact sequence:\n    $1 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_d \\to \\pi_1(M_2(\\tau_n K)) \\to \\pi_1(M_2(K)) \\to 1$\n\n    In this sequence:\n    *   $\\pi_1(M_2(\\tau_n K))$ is the fundamental group we want to find.\n    *   $\\pi_1(M_2(K))$ is the fundamental group of the 2-fold branched cover of the 3-sphere ($S^3$) over the original knot (the trefoil).\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}_d$ is a cyclic group of order *d*.\n    *   The integer *d* is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the number of twists (*n*) and the determinant of the knot.\n\n4.  **Calculate *d***: For this problem, *n* = 5 and the determinant of the trefoil is 3. Therefore, $d = \\text{gcd}(5, 3) = 1$.\n\n5.  **Simplify the sequence**: Since $d=1$, the group $\\mathbb{Z}_1$ is the trivial group. The exact sequence shows that the fundamental group we are looking for is isomorphic to the fundamental group of the 2-fold branched cover of $S^3$ over the trefoil knot.\n\n6.  **Identify the fundamental group of the trefoil's branched cover**: The 2-fold branched cover of $S^3$ over the trefoil knot is a well-known 3-manifold called the lens space L(3,1). The fundamental group of this space is the cyclic group of order 3, denoted as $\\mathbb{Z}_3$.\n\n7.  **Determine the minimal number of generators**: The fundamental group in question is therefore isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. A cyclic group is, by definition, generated by a single element. Thus, the minimal number of generators is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
