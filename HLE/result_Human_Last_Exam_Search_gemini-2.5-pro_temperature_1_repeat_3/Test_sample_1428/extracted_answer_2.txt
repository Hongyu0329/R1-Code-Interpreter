The one-step transformation of the probability distribution is $P_{t+1}(i) = \frac{1}{2} P_t(i-1) + \frac{1}{2} P_t(i+1)$. The transition probability matrix is a circulant matrix with elements $A_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} (\delta_{j, i-1} + \delta_{j, i+1})$. The eigenvectors are $e^{ljk}$ with eigenvalues $\cos(k_n)$ for $k_n = 2\pi n/N$. The rate of relaxation is determined by the second-largest eigenvalue, which is $\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{N}\right)$.
