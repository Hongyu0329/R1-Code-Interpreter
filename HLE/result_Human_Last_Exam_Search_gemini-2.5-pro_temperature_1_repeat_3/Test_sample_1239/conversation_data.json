    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ for the homogeneous case (i.e., without an external force) is the extended Galilei group, which has a dimension of 11. This group is composed of several one-parameter subgroups of transformations that leave the equations invariant.\n\nThe symmetries and their corresponding dimensions are:\n\n*   **Time translation:** The equations are invariant under a shift in time ($t \\rightarrow t + a$). This contributes **1 dimension** to the group.\n*   **Space translations:** The equations are invariant under a spatial shift ($ \\vec{x} \\rightarrow \\vec{x} + \\vec{a}$). As this can be done independently in three spatial directions, this contributes **3 dimensions**.\n*   **Spatial rotations:** The equations are invariant under rotations of the spatial coordinates ($ \\vec{x} \\rightarrow R\\vec{x} $, where R is a rotation matrix). The group of rotations in 3D, SO(3), has **3 dimensions**.\n*   **Galilean boosts:** The equations are invariant under a transformation to a uniformly moving reference frame ($ \\vec{x} \\rightarrow \\vec{x} + \\vec{v}t $, $ \\vec{u} \\rightarrow \\vec{u} + \\vec{v} $). The velocity of the moving frame can be in any of the three spatial directions, contributing **3 dimensions**.\n*   **Scaling transformations:** The Navier-Stokes equations possess a scaling symmetry of the form $t \\rightarrow \\lambda^2 t$, $ \\vec{x} \\rightarrow \\lambda \\vec{x} $, $ \\vec{u} \\rightarrow \\lambda^{-1} \\vec{u} $, and $p \\rightarrow \\lambda^{-2} p$. This single-parameter scaling transformation adds **1 dimension** to the group.\n\nThe total dimension of the Lie group is the sum of the dimensions of these independent symmetries: 1 (time translation) + 3 (space translations) + 3 (rotations) + 3 (Galilean boosts) + 1 (scaling) = 11.\n\nIt is worth noting that in the presence of an external force, the symmetry group can be different. For certain forms of external forces, such as one derivable from a potential, the symmetry group can become infinite-dimensional. Additionally, the pressure in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is determined only up to an additive constant (or a function of time), which is sometimes referred to as a pressure symmetry or a gauge symmetry. However, this is typically not included when counting the dimensions of the spacetime symmetry group.\n\n<<<11>>>"
