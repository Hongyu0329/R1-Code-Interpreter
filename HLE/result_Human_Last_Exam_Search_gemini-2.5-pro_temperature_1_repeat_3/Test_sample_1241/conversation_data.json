    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the stationary distribution of the given system. The stationary state is achieved as time $t$ approaches infinity, at which point the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant, and their derivatives $P_i'(t)$ are equal to zero.\n\nThe given Kolmogorov-Chapman system of equations is:\n$$\nP_{0}'(t) = -0.019 P_{0}(t) + 0.65 P_{1}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{1}'(t) = 0.019 P_{0}(t) - (0.65 + 0.4)P_{1}(t) + 0.392 P_{2}(t) + 0.008 P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{2}'(t) = 0.4 P_{1}(t) - (0.392  + 0.008)P_{2}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{3}'(t) = 0.008 P_{2}(t) - 0.008 P_{3}(t)\n$$\n$$\nP_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1\n$$\n\nLet $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ be the stationary probabilities. Setting the derivatives to zero, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations:\n\n1.  $0 = -0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 P_0 - 1.05 P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 P_1 - 0.4 P_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3$\n5.  $1 = P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3$\n\nFrom equation (4), we can deduce:\n$0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_2 = P_3$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_1 = P_2$\n\nCombining these results, we get $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$\n\nNow, we substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019})P_1 + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) P_1 = 1$\n\nTo solve for $P_1$:\n$(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}) P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}) P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}) P_1 = 1$\n$P_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\nNow, we can find $P_0$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nThe problem asks for the sum $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768$\n\nRounding to four decimal places, the result is 0.9463.\n\n<<<0.9463>>>"
