    "An analysis of the provided number sequence reveals a consistent underlying rule. Each number in the sequence is a multiple of the sum of its own digits, a property that defines them as Harshad or Niven numbers. Furthermore, every number in the sequence is also a multiple of 6.\n\nTo verify this pattern, let's examine a few terms from the sequence:\n*   **1014**: The sum of the digits is 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 = 6. 1014 is divisible by 6 (1014 / 6 = 169), and it is also divisible by 6, thus it fits the pattern.\n*   **1224**: The sum of the digits is 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 9. 1224 is divisible by 9 (1224 / 9 = 136), and it is a multiple of 6 (1224 / 6 = 204).\n*   **2352**: The sum of the digits is 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 12. 2352 is divisible by 12 (2352 / 12 = 196), and it is a multiple of 6 (2352 / 6 = 392).\n\nThe task is to find the next number in the sequence that adheres to these two conditions: being a Harshad number and being a multiple of 6. The last number given is 2352. We must find the next integer after 2352 that satisfies both properties.\n\nLet's test the subsequent multiples of 6:\n*   2352 + 6 = 2358.\n    *   The sum of the digits of 2358 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 = 18.\n    *   We check if 2358 is divisible by 18. 2358 / 18 = 131.\n    *   Since 2358 is divisible by the sum of its digits (18) and is a multiple of 6, it is the next number in the sequence.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
