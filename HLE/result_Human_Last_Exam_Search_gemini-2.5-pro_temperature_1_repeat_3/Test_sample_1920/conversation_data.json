    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we first need to analyze the conductor $d$.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $d$.\nThe prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nSince $d$ is a square-free integer, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if its component characters modulo each prime factor are non-trivial.\n\nLet $\\chi$ be a character modulo $d$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the group of characters modulo $d$ is the direct product of the character groups for each prime factor:\n$\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\cong \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\times \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\times \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/19\\mathbb{Z})^\\times} \\times \\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/31\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$.\n\nA character $\\chi$ corresponds to a tuple of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$, where $\\chi_p$ is a character modulo $p$. For $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $d$, each component character $\\chi_p$ must be non-trivial (i.e., not the principal character).\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters. We need this order to be 6.\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\nThis condition implies two things:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  At least one component character must have an order divisible by 2, and at least one must have an order divisible by 3.\n\nSince each $\\chi_p$ must be non-trivial, its order must be greater than 1. Thus, the possible orders for each component character are 2, 3, or 6.\n\nLet's check the group of characters for each prime factor. The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $p-1$.\n*   For $p=7$, the order is $7-1=6$.\n*   For $p=13$, the order is $13-1=12$.\n*   For $p=19$, the order is $19-1=18$.\n*   For $p=31$, the order is $31-1=30$.\n\nIn all cases, the order of the character group is a multiple of 6. Therefore, for each prime factor, there exist characters of orders 2, 3, and 6. The number of characters of order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ (where $k|n$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nFor each prime factor $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, we must choose a non-trivial character $\\chi_p$ whose order divides 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, or 6. The number of available choices for each prime is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ where each $\\chi_p$ has an order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. The total number of such tuples is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$. Each of these tuples corresponds to a primitive character whose order divides 6.\n\nWe need the order to be exactly 6. We must therefore exclude the cases where the order is a proper divisor of 6, i.e., 2 or 3.\n*   The order is 2 if and only if all component characters have order 2. For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. So there is $1^4 = 1$ such character.\n*   The order is 3 if and only if all component characters have order 3. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. So there are $2^4 = 16$ such characters.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6 is the total number of primitive characters with order dividing 6, minus those with order 2 or 3.\nNumber of characters = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
