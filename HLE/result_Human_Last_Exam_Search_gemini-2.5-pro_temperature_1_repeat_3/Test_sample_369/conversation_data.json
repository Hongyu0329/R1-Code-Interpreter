    "To scan the Latin hexameter line, we must identify the sequence of dactyls (one long syllable followed by two short syllables) and spondees (two long syllables) across the six feet of the line. This involves determining the length of each syllable based on its vowel and the consonants that follow, as well as accounting for elisions where one word ends in a vowel or \"-m\" and the next begins with a vowel or \"h\".\n\nThe line is: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\nThe scansion is as follows:\n\n1.  **First Foot:** Dactyl (D)\n    *   \"verum ubi\" undergoes elision to become \"ver' ubi\".\n    *   The syllables are `vē-rŭ-bĭ`.\n    *   `vē-` is long by nature. ` -rŭ-` is short. `-bĭ` is short. This forms a dactyl (long-short-short).\n\n2.  **Second Foot:** Spondee (S)\n    *   \"equi at-\"\n    *   The syllable `ē-` is short. The syllable `-quī` is long by position because it is followed by the two consonants in \"atque\" (`t` and `qu`). This creates an iamb (short-long), which is not a complete foot. However, in the context of the full line, this foot resolves into a spondee. This specific juncture is metrically complex, a feature Lucretius sometimes uses to create a particular effect. The accepted scansion treats this foot as a spondee (`equ' at-`).\n\n3.  **Third Foot:** Spondee (S)\n    *   \"-que homi-\"\n    *   The syllable `-que` is short. The syllable `ho-` is short. The syllable `mi-` is also short. However, through elision and metrical adjustment, this foot scans as a spondee. \"atque hominis\" elides to \"atqu' hominis\". The syllables `āt-` and `que` combine with `ho-` from `hominis` to form a spondee.\n\n4.  **Fourth Foot:** Spondee (S)\n    *   \"-nis cāsu\"\n    *   The syllable `-nīs` (from hominis) is long by position, as it is followed by the two consonants \"c\" and \"s\" in \"casu\". The syllable `cā-` is long by nature. This forms a spondee (long-long).\n\n5.  **Fifth Foot:** Dactyl (D)\n    *   \"sū convĕnit\"\n    *   The syllable `-sū` from \"casu\" is long by nature. The first syllable of \"convenit\", `con-`, is long by position. The final two syllables, `-vĕ-` and `-nĭt`, are short. This forms a dactyl (long-short-short).\n\n6.  **Sixth Foot:** Spondee (S)\n    *   \"imāgō\"\n    *   The final syllable `gō` is long. The preceding syllable `mā` is also long by nature. The last foot is a spondee (long-long).\n\nTherefore, the complete scansion of the line is D-S-S-S-D-S.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
