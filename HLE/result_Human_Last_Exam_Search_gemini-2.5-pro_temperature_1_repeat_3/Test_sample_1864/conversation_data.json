    "For a high-quality flow cytometry sorting experiment using five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750) and a streptavidin-based detection system, you should prepare a minimum of 13 essential control samples. These controls are crucial for accurate data interpretation, proper compensation of spectral overlap, and precise gating for cell sorting.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n**1. Unstained Control (1 sample):** This sample contains only the cells and beads without any fluorescent labels. It is fundamental for assessing the natural autofluorescence of your cells and setting the baseline voltage for the detectors.\n\n**2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (6 samples):** These are required to correct for the spectral overlap between fluorochromes. You need one for each fluorescent dye in your panel.\n\n*   **Marker Compensation (5 samples):** A separate sample stained with only one of the following fluorochromes: AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750.\n*   **Viability Dye Compensation (1 sample):** For cell sorting, using a viability dye to exclude dead cells is essential to prevent false positives and ensure you are sorting live cells. This dye requires its own channel and a corresponding single-stain control for compensation.\n\n**3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):** These controls are critical for accurately setting the boundaries (gates) for your positive populations in a multicolor experiment. Each FMO control contains all the stains in your panel except for one. For a five-marker experiment, you should prepare five FMO controls, one for each marker channel.\n\n**4. Streptavidin System Control (1 sample):** Since you are using streptavidin beads, which implies a biotin-streptavidin staining system, you must control for non-specific binding of the streptavidin reagent. This sample consists of cells incubated with the fluorescently labeled streptavidin in the absence of any biotinylated antibody.\n\nIn summary, the total number of essential controls is the sum of these individual requirements: 1 (unstained) + 6 (compensation) + 5 (FMO) + 1 (streptavidin) = 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
