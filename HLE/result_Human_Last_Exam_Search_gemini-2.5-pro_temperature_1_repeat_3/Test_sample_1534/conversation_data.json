    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**. The entire posterior portion of the brain is encased in cranial cartilage.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is part of the posterior subesophageal mass, which controls various motor actions in the more posterior part of the cuttlefish's body. The palliovisceral lobe itself is involved in controlling escape movements and inking. Situated with it in the posterior region of the subesophageal mass are the posterior chromatophore lobes, which control the chromatophores of the mantle, and the fin lobes, which control the movement of the fins.\n\nA 3D brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish, available through the Cuttlebase web tool, provides a visual representation of these structures and their relative positions. The posterior view of the brain model clearly shows the arrangement of these lobes.\n\n<<<The posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
