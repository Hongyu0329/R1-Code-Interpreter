    "Let the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$. We can write this polynomial as a sum of its terms: $P(x) = \\sum_k a_kx^k$. The problem asks for the value of $\\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\nThe sum of the squares of the coefficients of a polynomial can be found by evaluating the constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$. This is a known result related to Parseval's theorem for Fourier series.\n\nLet's compute $P(x)P(x^{-1})$:\n$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\n$P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+(x^{-1})^{3^i}+(x^{-1})^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ (x^{-1})^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\n\nThen, the product is:\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left[ \\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i} \\right) \\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i} \\right) \\right]$\n\nThe constant term of a product of polynomials is the product of their individual constant terms. Let's find the constant term of one of the factors in the product. Let $y = x^{3^i}$. The factor is:\n$F_i(x) = (1+y+y^2+y^3)(1+y^{-1}+y^{-2}+y^{-3})$\n\nTo find the constant term of $F_i(x)$, we multiply the terms from the first parenthesis with the terms from the second that result in a term with $y^0=1$.\nThe combinations are:\n*   $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n*   $y \\cdot y^{-1} = 1$\n*   $y^2 \\cdot y^{-2} = 1$\n*   $y^3 \\cdot y^{-3} = 1$\n\nThe sum of these products gives the constant term of $F_i(x)$, which is $1+1+1+1 = 4$.\n\nThis holds for each factor in the product, from $i=0$ to $i=19$. There are $19 - 0 + 1 = 20$ such factors.\n\nThe constant term of $P(x)P(x^{-1})$ is the product of the constant terms of each $F_i(x)$. Therefore, the total constant term is:\n$\\prod_{i=0}^{19} 4 = 4^{20}$\n\nThis constant term is equal to the desired sum of the squares of the coefficients.\nSo, $\\sum_k a_k^2 = 4^{20}$.\n\nWe can also express this as a power of 2:\n$4^{20} = (2^2)^{20} = 2^{40}$.\nCalculating this value gives:\n$2^{40} = (2^{10})^4 = 1024^4 = 1,099,511,627,776$.\n\nThus, the sum of the squares of the coefficients is $4^{20}$.\n\n<<<4^20>>>"
