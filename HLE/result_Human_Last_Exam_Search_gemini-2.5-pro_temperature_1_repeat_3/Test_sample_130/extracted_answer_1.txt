When the local median operator is applied iteratively to a binary image, the edges of the image evolve in a process that is a discrete approximation of motion by mean curvature. This means that sharp corners are rounded, and curved edges become smoother. Convex shapes will shrink over time, become more circular, and eventually vanish. Concave regions will tend to fill in. As the number of iterations ($t$) approaches infinity, the image will converge to a fixed point. For most initial configurations, this fixed point will be a solid image (all 0s or all 1s), as all bounded regions of one color will have shrunk and disappeared. The edges are thus eliminated.
