    "To solve the equation XL/CCC-MMCDLXXXVIII, we must first convert the Roman numerals to modern Arabic numbers.\n\n*   **XL**: In Roman numerals, when a smaller value (X = 10) precedes a larger value (L = 50), it is subtracted. Therefore, XL equals 40.\n*   **CCC**: The letter C represents 100. When repeated, the values are added together, so CCC is 100 + 100 + 100, which equals 300.\n*   **MMCDLXXXVIII**: This numeral is broken down as follows:\n    *   MM = 1000 + 1000 = 2000\n    *   CD = 500 - 100 = 400\n    *   LXXX = 50 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 80\n    *   VIII = 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8\n    *   Adding these values together, MMCDLXXXVIII is 2000 + 400 + 80 + 8 = 2488.\n\nNow, substitute these modern numbers back into the equation:\n\n40 / 300 - 2488\n\nNext, perform the calculation:\n\n1.  **Division**: 40 divided by 300 is approximately 0.1333...\n2.  **Subtraction**: 0.1333... minus 2488 equals -2487.8667...\n\nThe solution can be expressed as a fraction for precision. 40/300 simplifies to 2/15. So the equation is 2/15 - 2488. To express this as a single fraction, we find a common denominator: 2/15 - (2488 * 15)/15 = 2/15 - 37320/15 = -37318/15. As a mixed number, this is -2487 and 13/15.\n\n<<<−2487.8666...>>>"
