    "In the semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD_512, there are 9 power subgroups.\n\nThe semidihedral group SD_512 can be described by the presentation G = <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^127>. A subgroup H of a group G is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer k such that H is the set of all k-th powers of elements in G (H = G^k = {g^k | g âˆˆ G}).\n\nThe power subgroups of SD_512 are:\n1.  The group G itself, which is generated when k is an odd integer not congruent to 3 modulo 4 (e.g., k=1, 5, 9,...).\n2.  The eight cyclic subgroups of the form <r^d>, where d is an even divisor of 256. These are:\n    *   <r^2>\n    *   <r^4>\n    *   <r^8>\n    *   <r^16>\n    *   <r^32>\n    *   <r^64>\n    *   <r^128>\n    *   <r^256> = {1} (the trivial subgroup)\n\nThese subgroups are generated for various even values of k. For example, for k=2, the power subgroup is <r^2>. For k=4, it is <r^4>, and for k=256, it is the trivial subgroup {1}.\n\nIn total, there is one power subgroup that is the group itself and eight cyclic power subgroups, making a total of 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
