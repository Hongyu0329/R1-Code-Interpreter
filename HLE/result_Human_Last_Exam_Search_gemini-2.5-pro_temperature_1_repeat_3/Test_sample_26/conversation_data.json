    "Let $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in the complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. We want to determine the rank of its third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\n### Topological Properties of the Hypersurface\n\nFirst, we establish some fundamental topological properties of $X$. Since $X$ is a complex surface, it is a real 4-dimensional manifold. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem relates the topology of $X$ to the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. It states that the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ for $k < \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 2$.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Group ($\\pi_1$)**: For $k=1$, we have an isomorphism $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is simply connected for all $n \\ge 1$, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$. Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$, meaning $X$ is simply connected.\n\n2.  **Homology Groups**: Since $X$ is a smooth, compact, orientable 4-manifold, we can determine its Betti numbers.\n    *   $b_0(X) = 1$ (since $X$ is connected).\n    *   $b_1(X) = 0$ (since $\\pi_1(X) = 0$).\n    *   By Poincaré duality, $b_4(X) = b_0(X) = 1$ and $b_3(X) = b_1(X) = 0$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic of a degree-$d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is given by the formula $\\chi(X) = d^3 - 4d^2 + 6d$. For our quintic surface ($d=5$), this gives $\\chi(X) = 5^3 - 4(5^2) + 6(5) = 125 - 100 + 30 = 55$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic is also the alternating sum of Betti numbers: $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$. Plugging in the known values, we get $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1$, which yields $b_2(X) = 53$.\n\n### Homotopy and Homology Relationship\n\nThe Hurewicz theorem provides a crucial link between homotopy and homology groups.\n\n*   For a simply connected space like $X$, the second homotopy group is isomorphic to the second homology group: $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. Since the rank of $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is $b_2(X)=53$, the rank of $\\pi_2(X)$ is 53.\n*   The **Rational Hurewicz Theorem** states that for a simply connected space, the rationalized Hurewicz map $h_n \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} : \\pi_n(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\to H_n(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ is an isomorphism up to the first dimension where $\\pi_k(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is non-zero. In our case, $\\pi_2(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong \\mathbb{Q}^{53}$, so the theorem applies for $n=2$.\n*   For higher dimensions in a simply connected space, Serre's \"mod C\" version of the Hurewicz theorem implies that the kernel of the Hurewicz map $h_n: \\pi_n(X) \\to H_n(X)$ consists entirely of torsion elements. This means that the rank of $\\pi_n(X)$ is the same as the rank of $H_n(X)$.\n\n### Calculating the Rank of $\\pi_3(X)$\n\nWe apply this result to our case for $n=3$:\n*   The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is equal to the rank of $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The rank of $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is given by the third Betti number, $b_3(X)$.\n*   As calculated above from the simple connectivity and Poincaré duality, $b_3(X) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0. This implies that the group $\\pi_3(X)$ is a torsion group.\n\n<<<0>>>"
