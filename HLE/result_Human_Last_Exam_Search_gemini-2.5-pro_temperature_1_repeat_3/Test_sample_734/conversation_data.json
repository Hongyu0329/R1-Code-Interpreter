    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology applicable to changes in the laws of nature, such as the virgin birth of Jesus and potential alterations at the Fall, was **Thomas Aquinas**.\n\nAquinas developed the concept of **\"obediential potency\"** (in Latin, *potentia obedientialis*). This term describes the inherent capacity within all created things to be acted upon by God in a way that surpasses their own natural capacities. It is a passive potentiality that makes a creature \"obedient\" to God's divine will, allowing for events that are outside the ordinary course of nature.\n\nWhile earlier theologians like **Augustine of Hippo** spoke of the \"laws of nature\" being \"changed\" for the virgin birth, Aquinas provided a more systematic and philosophical framework with the specific terminology of \"obediential potency\". In his *Summa Theologiae* and other works, Aquinas explained that miracles are not violations of the natural order but rather events caused directly by God's power, acting beyond the secondary causes that normally govern the world.\n\nThis concept is applicable to:\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** Aquinas would explain that while human conception has a natural process, the Virgin Mary's human nature possessed an obediential potency to be elevated by God's power to conceive without a human father.\n*   **The Fall:** The concept could also be applied to theological discussions about possible alterations in the natural world after the Fall of man. While theologians like Augustine and Aquinas argued that many aspects of nature we perceive as harsh were part of the original created order, obediential potency provides a framework for understanding how God could have altered the functioning of the natural world as a consequence of sin if He had so willed.\n\nTherefore, Thomas Aquinas is the theologian credited with developing the specialized term \"obediential potency\" to describe the capacity of nature to be altered by divine action, a concept applicable to miracles like the virgin birth and the theological problem of the Fall.\n\n<<<Thomas Aquinas>>>"
