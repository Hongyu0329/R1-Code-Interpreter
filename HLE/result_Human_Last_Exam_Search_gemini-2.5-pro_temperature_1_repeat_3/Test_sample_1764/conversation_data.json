    "It is possible for the number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space into a Banach space to be zero.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we can construct a specific example of a finite ultrametric space *X* and a Banach space *B* for which no isometric embedding exists.\n\n1.  **Define the finite ultrametric space X:**\n    Let X be a set with three distinct points, {x, y, z}. Let the distance function *d* be defined as:\n    *   d(x, y) = 1\n    *   d(y, z) = 1\n    *   d(x, z) = 1\n    *   d(a, a) = 0 for any a in X.\n    *   d(a, b) = d(b, a) for any a, b in X.\n\n    This space is an ultrametric space because for any three points, the strong triangle inequality, d(a, c) ≤ max{d(a, b), d(b, c)}, is satisfied. For instance, d(x, z) = 1 ≤ max{d(x, y), d(y, z)} = max{1, 1} = 1.\n\n2.  **Define the Banach space B:**\n    Let B be the set of real numbers **R** with the standard norm, ||a|| = |a|. **R** is a complete normed vector space, so it is a Banach space. Its cardinality K is the cardinality of the continuum, *c*.\n\n3.  **Attempt to find an isometric embedding f: X → B:**\n    An isometric embedding *f* must preserve distances. This means that the distances between the images of the points in X under *f* must be equal to the distances in X. Let f(x) = a, f(y) = b, and f(z) = c, where a, b, and c are real numbers. The following conditions must hold:\n    *   ||f(x) - f(y)|| = |a - b| = d(x, y) = 1\n    *   ||f(y) - f(z)|| = |b - c| = d(y, z) = 1\n    *   ||f(x) - f(z)|| = |a - c| = d(x, z) = 1\n\n    Let's try to find three real numbers a, b, and c that satisfy these equations.\n    From |a - b| = 1, we have either b = a + 1 or b = a - 1. Let's assume b = a + 1 without loss of generality.\n    Now, from |b - c| = 1, we have c = b + 1 or c = b - 1.\n    *   Case 1: c = b + 1. Substituting b = a + 1, we get c = (a + 1) + 1 = a + 2. In this case, the distance |a - c| = |a - (a + 2)| = |-2| = 2. This contradicts the required condition |a - c| = 1.\n    *   Case 2: c = b - 1. Substituting b = a + 1, we get c = (a + 1) - 1 = a. In this case, the distance |a - c| = |a - a| = 0. This also contradicts the required condition |a - c| = 1.\n\n    Since both cases lead to a contradiction, there are no three points in **R** that are all at a distance of 1 from each other. Therefore, no isometric embedding of this particular space *X* into the Banach space **R** exists.\n\nSince we have found an example of a finite ultrametric space and a Banach space for which the number of isometric embeddings is 0, and the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
