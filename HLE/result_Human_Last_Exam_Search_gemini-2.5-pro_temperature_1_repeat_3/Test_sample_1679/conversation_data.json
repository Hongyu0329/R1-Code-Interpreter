    "**\"An American in Paris\" (1951) is the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to feature a depiction of a Luxor Obelisk.**\n\nThe iconic Parisian landmark is showcased in the film's celebrated 17-minute ballet sequence. This elaborate finale, designed in the style of French painter Raoul Dufy, presents a dreamlike version of the Place de la Concorde. While the film was primarily shot on MGM studio lots, detailed sets were created to evoke the spirit of the French capital.\n\nThe ballet's centerpiece is a fountain directly inspired by the real one in the Place de la Concorde. The Luxor Obelisk, the actual monument at the center of the famous square, is represented as part of this stylized Parisian backdrop. Though not a location shoot, the artistic rendering of the Place de la Concorde in \"An American in Paris\" marks the first instance of a Luxor Obelisk appearing in a Best Picture-winning film.\n\nOther Best Picture winners filmed in Paris, such as \"Gigi\" (1958) and \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956), do not feature scenes in the Place de la Concorde. There is no evidence of any Best Picture-winning film having been shot in Luxor, Egypt, where the other Luxor Obelisk is located.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
