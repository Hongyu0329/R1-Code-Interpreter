    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate (third from the end) syllable of a word, often as a result of adding a suffix.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n*   **southern**: This word derives from *south*. The vowel in *south* is a tense diphthong (/aʊ/), which becomes a lax vowel (/ʌ/) in the disyllabic word *southern*. This is considered an example of the trisyllabic laxing rule because its Old English predecessor, *sūðerne*, had three syllables, which triggered the shortening of the long vowel *ū*.\n*   **derivative**: This word is related to *derive*. The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative*. This change is a classic example of the set of sound changes that includes trisyllabic laxing, where certain suffixes cause a vowel to become lax.\n*   **serenity**: This word is the noun form of *serene*. The tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *serenity*, where it is in the third-to-last syllable. This is a textbook case of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **pleasant**: This word is related to *please*. The tense vowel /iː/ in *please* becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *pleasant*. However, *pleasant* has only two syllables. The shortening is due to a different rule called pre-cluster shortening, which occurs before a consonant cluster, not because of the syllable position.\n*   **gratitude**: This word is related to *grateful*. The tense vowel /eɪ/ in *grateful* becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in *gratitude*. This fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing, as the vowel is in the third-to-last syllable of a derived word.\n*   **shadow**: This word comes from the Old English *sceadu* (oblique form *sceadwe*), which in turn comes from Proto-Germanic **skadwaz*. The vowel in the root of this word was historically short. Since the vowel was never long or tense, it could not undergo laxing (shortening).\n\nBased on this, *southern*, *derivative*, *serenity*, and *gratitude* all show the effects of trisyllabic laxing. *Pleasant* shows vowel laxing, but through a different process. *Shadow* did not undergo laxing because its vowel was never long to begin with. Therefore, it has not undergone the process of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
