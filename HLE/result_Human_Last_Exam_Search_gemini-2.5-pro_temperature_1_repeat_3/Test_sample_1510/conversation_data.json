    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nA wallpaper group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern. There are a total of 17 distinct wallpaper groups. Each of these groups is associated with a point group, which describes the symmetries of the pattern that leave at least one point fixed. The order of a point group is the number of symmetry operations it contains.\n\nThe point groups for two-dimensional crystallography are the cyclic groups (C_n) and the dihedral groups (D_n), where 'n' can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 due to the crystallographic restriction theorem. The order of the cyclic group C_n is 'n', and the order of the dihedral group D_n is '2n'. Therefore, a point group of order 2 can be either C₂ (with order 2) or D₁ (with order 2*1 = 2).\n\nThe four wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group has a C₂ point group. It features twofold rotational symmetry but lacks reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm**: This group's point group is D₁, characterized by reflection symmetry across parallel lines.\n*   **pg**: This group also has a D₁ point group. Its symmetry is defined by glide reflections.\n*   **cm**: This group is associated with the D₁ point group and contains both reflections and glide reflections.\n\nOther wallpaper groups possess point groups of different orders. For instance, groups like pmm, pmg, pgg, and cmm have the point group D₂ (order 4), while p1 has the simplest point group C₁ (order 1).\n\n<<<4>>>"
