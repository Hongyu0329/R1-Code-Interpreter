    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that is read by a ribosome, beginning with a start codon and ending with a stop codon. Since the provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an ORF, it should not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) in its correct reading frame.\n\nThe process of converting a nucleotide sequence into a protein sequence is called translation. By translating the given DNA in all three possible reading frames, the correct frame can be identified as the one lacking a stop codon.\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Starts at the first nucleotide (`g`): `gga cat tgt tgt tag...`. The fifth codon, `tag`, is a stop codon.\n*   **Frame 2:** Starts at the second nucleotide (`g`): `gac att gtt gtt agc...`. This frame contains no stop codons.\n*   **Frame 3:** Starts at the third nucleotide (`a`): `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...`. The eighth codon, `tga`, is a stop codon.\n\nFrame 2 is the only reading frame without a stop codon.\n\n**Reading Frame:** 2\n\n**Protein Sequence:**\n<<<DIVVSNEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
