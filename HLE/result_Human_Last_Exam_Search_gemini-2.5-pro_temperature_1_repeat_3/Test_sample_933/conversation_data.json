    "The most efficient and commonly cited temperature for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is 400°C. The production of XeF₄ is achieved by the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gases.\n\nThe synthesis is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine, usually in a 1:5 molar ratio, in a nickel vessel at 400°C and a pressure of 6 atmospheres. Nickel is used for the container because it forms a protective layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its surface, which prevents further reaction with the highly reactive fluorine gas. The initial synthesis of XeF₄ in 1962 was also performed at this temperature.\n\nWhile the reaction can occur within a range of 350°C to 450°C, 400°C is noted as the preferable temperature for a quantitative reaction. The use of different temperatures can affect the product, with lower temperatures favoring the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF₂) and higher temperatures potentially leading to xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). Flow methods have been described at temperatures between 300-500°C, but these can lead to impurities such as XeF₂.\n\nTherefore, based on established and efficient synthesis methods, 400°C is the appropriate temperature.\n\n<<<B>>>"
