    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide is a Pummerer-type reaction. The IUPAC name of the resulting product is 2-phenylsulfanylacetonitrile.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in the following manner:\n1.  The oxygen atom of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This step activates the sulfoxide.\n2.  An elimination step occurs, forming a thionium ion intermediate (\\[Ph-S=CH2]+).\n3.  The trimethylsilyl cyanide delivers a cyanide ion (CN-), which acts as a nucleophile.\n4.  The cyanide ion attacks the electrophilic carbon of the thionium ion, leading to the final product.\n\nThe final product has the chemical structure Ph-S-CH2-CN. According to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) nomenclature, this compound is named 2-phenylsulfanylacetonitrile. It is also commonly referred to as (phenylthio)acetonitrile. This reaction is a known method for creating α-thio-substituted nitriles and is related to the Pummerer rearrangement, which involves the transformation of a sulfoxide into an α-acyloxy thioether. In this case, the reaction is \"interrupted\" by an external nucleophile (cyanide) instead of the counterion from the anhydride.\n\n<<<2-phenylsulfanylacetonitrile>>>"
