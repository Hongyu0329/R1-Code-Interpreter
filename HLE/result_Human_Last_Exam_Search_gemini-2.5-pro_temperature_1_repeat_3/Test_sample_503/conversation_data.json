    "An internal adjunction in a locally posetal 2-category, such as the simplex category $\\Delta$ viewed as a subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, is a specific instance of an adjunction in a 2-category.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Simplex Category ($\\Delta$) as a Locally Posetal 2-Category\n\n*   **Objects:** The objects of the simplex category $\\Delta$ are the finite ordered sets $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for any integer $n \\ge 0$. For this problem, the objects are $$ and $$.\n*   **Morphisms (1-cells):** A morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ in $\\Delta$ is an order-preserving map; that is, a function such that if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **2-Morphisms:** When we view $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-category, for any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ if and only if $f \\le g$ in the pointwise order. This means $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n\n### 2. Definition of an Internal Adjunction\n\nAn internal adjunction between two objects, say $[m]$ and $[n]$, consists of a pair of morphisms, $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $u: [n] \\to [m]$, and two 2-morphisms which act as the unit and counit of the adjunction.\n\nIn the context of a locally posetal category, these 2-morphisms translate to inequalities:\n1.  **Unit ($\\eta$):** $\\text{id}_{[m]} \\le u \\circ f$. This means for all $i \\in [m]$, $\\text{id}_{[m]}(i) \\le (u \\circ f)(i)$, which simplifies to $i \\le u(f(i))$.\n2.  **Counit ($\\epsilon$):** $f \\circ u \\le \\text{id}_{[n]}$. This means for all $j \\in [n]$, $(f \\circ u)(j) \\le \\text{id}_{[n]}(j)$, which simplifies to $f(u(j)) \\le j$.\n\nThis pair of conditions defines a **Galois connection** between the posets $[m]$ and $[n]$, where $f$ is the lower adjoint (or left adjoint) and $u$ is the upper adjoint (or right adjoint).\n\n### 3. Counting the Adjunctions\n\nThe phrase \"adjunction from $$ to $$\" typically implies that the left adjoint functor goes from $$ to $$. Thus, we are looking for the number of pairs $(f, u)$ where $f: \\to$ is a left adjoint and $u: \\to$ is its corresponding right adjoint.\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by its left adjoint (or its right adjoint). Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of possible left adjoint maps $f: \\to$.\n\nA map between complete lattices is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). The posets $[n]$ are complete lattices.\n*   For any non-empty subset of $[m]$, its supremum is its maximum element. Any order-preserving map between totally ordered sets preserves maxima.\n*   The crucial case is the supremum of the empty set, which is the bottom element of the lattice. In $[m]$, the bottom element is $0$. Thus, a join-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ must satisfy $f(\\sup(\\emptyset_{[m]})) = \\sup(f(\\emptyset))$. This means $f(0_m) = 0_n$.\n\nSo, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ that satisfy the additional condition $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSuch a map is defined by the sequence of values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$. We are given:\n*   $f(0) = 0$.\n*   $0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis means we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23, namely $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$, where each value is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem of choosing $k$ items from a set of $n$ with replacement, where order does not matter (as the non-decreasing condition fixes the order). This is also known as counting multisets.\n*   The number of items to choose is $k = 23$ (the values for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$).\n*   The set of possible values is $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $n = 38$ elements.\n\nThe number of such sequences is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nCalculating this value:\n$$ \\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!} = 472,313,133,333,333,188,160 $$\n\nThus, there are $\\binom{60}{23}$ such maps $f$, and therefore the same number of internal adjunctions from $$ to $$.\n\n<<<472313133333333188160>>>"
