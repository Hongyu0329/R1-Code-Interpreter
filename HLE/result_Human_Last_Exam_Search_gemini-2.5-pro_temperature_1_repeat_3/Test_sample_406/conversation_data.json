    "An **FGH-tripled fixed point** for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is an element (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically established within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces. The conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point generally involve a combination of completeness of the underlying spaces, continuity or a mixed monotonicity property of the functions, and a contractive condition.\n\nBased on the generalization from tripled fixed point theorems, the primary conditions are as follows:\n\n**1. Properties of the Spaces:**\n*   (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) are complete metric spaces.\n*   The spaces are equipped with partial orderings (≼). The product space X × Y × Z is endowed with the partial order defined as: (u, v, w) ≼ (x, y, z) if and only if u ≼ x, y ≼ v, and w ≼ z.\n\n**2. Mixed Monotonicity Property:**\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property. For F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z, this property is defined as follows:\n*   **F** is said to have the mixed monotone property if for any x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n    x₁ ≼ x₂ , y₂ ≼ y₁ , z₁ ≼ z₂ ⇒ F(x₁, y₁, z₁) ≼ F(x₂, y₂, z₂)\n*   **G** is said to have the mixed monotone property if for any y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, x₁, x₂ ∈ X:\n    y₁ ≼ y₂ , x₂ ≼ x₁ ⇒ G(y₁, x₁, y₁) ≼ G(y₂, x₂, y₂)\n*   **H** is said to have the mixed monotone property if for any z₁, z₂ ∈ Z, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, x₁, x₂ ∈ X:\n    z₁ ≼ z₂ , y₂ ≼ y₁ , x₂ ≼ x₁ ⇒ H(z₁, y₁, x₁) ≼ H(z₂, y₂, x₂)\n\n**3. Contractive Condition:**\nThere exist constants k, l, m ∈ [0, 1) with k + l + m < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z for which u ≼ x, y ≼ v, and w ≼ z, the following inequality holds:\n\nd_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) + d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * d_X(x, u) + l * d_Y(y, v) + m * d_Z(z, w)\n\n**4. Existence of an Initial Point:**\nThere must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies:\n*   x₀ ≼ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   G(y₀, x₀, y₀) ≼ y₀\n*   z₀ ≼ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nUnder these conditions, the functions F, G, and H have an FGH-tripled fixed point. Additional conditions, such as the uniqueness of the point of comparison, can be imposed to guarantee the uniqueness of the FGH-tripled fixed point. These theorems are a generalization of the well-known Banach contraction principle to a multi-dimensional setting with multiple functions.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) in the product space X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.\n\nThe conditions for the existence of such a fixed point are typically established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces and involve the following key components:\n\n1.  **Metric Space Properties:** The spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete metric spaces.\n\n2.  **Partial Ordering and Mixed Monotonicity:**\n    *   The spaces are endowed with a partial order.\n    *   The functions F, G, and H must satisfy a \"mixed monotone property\". This means that the functions are non-decreasing in some arguments and non-increasing in others with respect to the partial order. For instance, F(x, y, z) is non-decreasing in x and z, and non-increasing in y.\n\n3.  **Contractive Condition:** The functions must satisfy a contractive inequality. This condition ensures that when the mappings are applied iteratively, the distances between successive points decrease. An example of such a condition is the existence of non-negative constants k, l, and m whose sum is less than 1, such that:\n    d(F(x,y,z), F(u,v,w)) + d(G(y,x,y), G(v,u,v)) + d(H(z,y,x), H(w,v,u)) ≤ k * d(x,u) + l * d(y,v) + m * d(z,w)\n    for all comparable elements (x,y,z) and (u,v,w).\n\n4.  **Initial Point Condition:** There must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that has a specific relationship with the functions, such as x₀ being less than or equal to F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ being greater than or equal to G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ being less than or equal to H(z₀, y₀, x₀) under the defined partial ordering.\n\nIf these conditions are met, along with a continuity assumption on the functions or a regularity condition on the space, then the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed.
