    "The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **triangulene**.\n\nTriangulene (C₂₂H₁₂) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon composed of six fused benzene rings arranged in a triangular shape. This unique structure gives the molecule its name. While not formally named after an extinct creature, its triangular and somewhat segmented appearance has led to it being informally and illustratively compared to fossils of trilobites, marine arthropods that went extinct during the Permian-Triassic extinction event around 252 million years ago.\n\nThe link to creatures from over 65 million years ago also stems from the fact that high concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, the class of compounds to which triangulene belongs, are found in the Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary layer. This geological layer marks the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs approximately 66 million years ago.\n\nTriangulene was first theorized in 1953 by Czech chemist Erich Clar, but due to its extreme reactivity, it was not successfully synthesized until 2017. Researchers at IBM, in collaboration with the University of Warwick, were the first to create and image the molecule. Its unique electronic properties, stemming from its non-Kekulé structure, make it a subject of significant interest in the fields of electronics and quantum computing.\n\n<<<triangulene>>>"
