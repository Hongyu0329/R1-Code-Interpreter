    "For the supersymmetric sigma-model describing disordered systems of symmetry class D with n replicas, the relevant target space is the supermanifold SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n). The non-Grassman variables correspond to the coordinates of the bosonic sector of this space. The number of these variables is therefore the dimension of the bosonic part of this coset.\n\nThe dimension of the bosonic part of a supergroup coset G/K is the dimension of the bosonic part of G minus the dimension of the bosonic part of K.\n\nFor the case of n=2 replicas:\n\n1.  **Denominator:** The denominator is the supergroup U(2|2). Its bosonic subgroup is U(2) × U(2). The dimension of the Lie group U(m) is m². Thus, the dimension of the bosonic part of U(2|2) is 2² + 2² = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\n2.  **Numerator:** The numerator is the supergroup SpO(4, R|4). Its bosonic subgroup is the direct product of the symplectic group Sp(4, R) and the orthogonal group O(4).\n    *   The dimension of the symplectic group Sp(2m, R) is m(2m+1). For m=2, the dimension of Sp(4, R) is 2(2*2+1) = 10.\n    *   The dimension of the orthogonal group O(m) is m(m-1)/2. For m=4, the dimension of O(4) is 4(4-1)/2 = 6.\n    *   Therefore, the total dimension of the bosonic part of SpO(4, R|4) is 10 + 6 = 16.\n\nThe number of non-Grassman variables is the difference between the bosonic dimensions of the numerator and the denominator:\n\n16 - 8 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
