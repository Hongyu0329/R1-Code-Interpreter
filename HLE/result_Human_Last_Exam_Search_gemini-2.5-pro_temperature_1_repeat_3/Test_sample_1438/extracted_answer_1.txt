The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a numerical value but is defined by the Berezin integration rules: for a single Grassmann variable \( \theta \), the integral of a constant is 0, and the integral of \( \theta \) itself is 1. This is often summarized as \( \int d\theta = 0 \) and \( \int d\theta \, \theta = 1 \). This definition, particularly the property that \( \theta^2 = 0 \), directly enforces the Pauli exclusion principle.
