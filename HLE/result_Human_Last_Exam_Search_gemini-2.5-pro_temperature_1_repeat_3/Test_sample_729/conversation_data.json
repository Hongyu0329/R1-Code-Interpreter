    "A power subgroup is a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group. The generalized quaternion group of order 128, denoted as Q128, has a specific structure that allows for the counting of its cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe structure of Q128 can be described by the presentation:\nQ128 = < a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹ >\n\nThe elements of Q128 consist of two types:\n1.  Powers of the element 'a': These form a cyclic subgroup <a> of order 64.\n2.  Elements of the form aⁱx: There are 64 such elements, where 'i' ranges from 0 to 63.\n\nTo find the total number of power subgroups, we count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by each type of element.\n\n### Cyclic Subgroups from <a>\nThe subgroup <a> is a cyclic group of order 64. The number of subgroups in a finite cyclic group is equal to the number of divisors of its order. The order is 64 = 2⁶, and its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. Therefore, there are **7** cyclic subgroups generated by the powers of 'a'.\n\n### Cyclic Subgroups from aⁱx\nThe elements of the form aⁱx all have an order of 4. Each of these elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4. A subgroup generated by aⁱx is {1, aⁱx, a³², aⁱ⁺³²x}.\n\nWe need to count how many of these subgroups are distinct. The elements aⁱx and aⁱ⁺³²x generate the same subgroup. Since there are 64 elements of this form, and they form pairs that generate the same subgroup, we have 64 / 2 = **32** distinct cyclic subgroups of this type.\n\nThese 32 subgroups are distinct from the cyclic subgroups of <a> (except for the trivial subgroup), as they contain elements involving 'x'. The only non-trivial element they share with the subgroups of <a> is a³², which is the unique element of order 2 in Q128.\n\n### Total Number of Power Subgroups\nThe total number of power subgroups is the sum of the distinct subgroups from both sets:\nTotal Subgroups = (Subgroups from <a>) + (Subgroups from aⁱx)\nTotal Subgroups = 7 + 32 = 39\n\nA known mathematical formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in a generalized quaternion group of order 2ⁿ is 2ⁿ⁻² + n. For Q128, n=7, so the number of subgroups is 2⁷⁻² + 7 = 2⁵ + 7 = 32 + 7 = 39. This confirms the result.\n\n<<<39>>>"
