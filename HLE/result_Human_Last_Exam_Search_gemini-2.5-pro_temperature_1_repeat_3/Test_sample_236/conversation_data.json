    "I have gathered some initial information. I understand that the homology cobordism group consists of equivalence classes of 3-manifolds, where two are equivalent if they bound a 4-manifold with the same homology as a cylinder. Integral surgery on a knot is a way to construct 3-manifolds. The key to the user's question is to identify which 3-manifolds, obtained by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings, are distinct in the homology cobordism group. I need to find a list of knots with at most four crossings, then determine the 3-manifolds resulting from integral surgery on them, and finally, figure out their classification within the homology cobordism group. The initial search did not directly provide a list of homology cobordism group elements for surgeries on these specific knots. I will proceed to the next steps to find this information.The search results have provided a list of knots with at most four crossings. These are the unknot (0 crossings), the trefoil knot (3 crossings), and the figure-eight knot (4 crossings). I have also found information about how integral surgery on a knot creates a 3-manifold and how the homology cobordism group classifies these manifolds. The key missing piece is to determine which specific integral surgeries on these three knots yield distinct elements in the homology cobordism group. Some results suggest that for a given knot, different surgery coefficients can lead to homology cobordant manifolds, and that surgeries on different knots can also result in homology cobordant manifolds. To answer the user's question, I need to find results that explicitly classify the homology cobordism classes of 3-manifolds obtained by integral surgery on the unknot, the trefoil knot, and the figure-eight knot.I have now gathered specific information about the homology cobordism of manifolds obtained by integral surgery on the unknot, the trefoil knot, and the figure-eight knot.\n\nFor the unknot, ±1 surgery results in S³, which is the trivial element in the homology cobordism group. Other integral surgeries (with framing other than ±1) on the unknot result in lens spaces. The set of lens spaces forms a subgroup of the homology cobordism group, and different lens spaces can represent distinct elements. In particular, L(p,q) and L(p,q') are homology cobordant if and only if q' is in the subgroup of (Z/pZ)* generated by q and certain other elements.\n\nFor the trefoil knot, +1 surgery gives the Poincaré homology sphere, which is known to have infinite order in the homology cobordism group. The left-handed and right-handed trefoils are not concordant, and their -1 surgeries are not homology cobordant.\n\nFor the figure-eight knot, it is known to have concordance order two. This implies that the connected sum of two figure-eight knots is slice, and thus surgery on it would be homology cobordant to surgery on the unknot. However, the figure-eight knot itself is not slice. This means that 0-surgery on the figure-eight knot gives a non-trivial element in the homology cobordism group.\n\nThe information suggests there are infinitely many elements. For instance, surgeries on the unknot can generate an infinite subgroup of lens spaces. Also, the Poincaré sphere from the trefoil knot has infinite order.\n\nI need to consolidate this information to provide a clear count of the number of distinct elements. The initial results point towards an infinite number. I will perform one final search to confirm if there are any subtle relations or if the count is indeed infinite, and to see if there is a concise summary of the homology cobordism classes for these specific knots.\nAn infinite number of elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings. Here is a breakdown of why:\n\nThe knots with at most four crossings are the unknot (with 0 crossings), the trefoil knot (with 3 crossings), and the figure-eight knot (with 4 crossings).\n\n*   **Integral Surgery on the Unknot:** An integral surgery on the unknot with an integer framing *p* results in the lens space L(p, 1). For *p* = ±1, the resulting 3-manifold is the 3-sphere (S³), which represents the trivial element in the homology cobordism group. For other integer values of *p*, we obtain various lens spaces. The set of lens spaces generates a subgroup of the rational homology cobordism group that has infinite rank. This implies that there are infinitely many distinct elements in the homology cobordism group that are lens spaces obtained by surgery on the unknot.\n\n*   **Integral Surgery on the Trefoil Knot:** The trefoil knot is a non-trivial knot. A +1 integral surgery on the right-handed trefoil knot yields the Poincaré homology sphere, Σ(2, 3, 5). It is a well-established result in low-dimensional topology that the Poincaré sphere represents an element of infinite order in the homology cobordism group. This single example is sufficient to demonstrate that integral surgery on a knot with three crossings can generate an infinite cyclic subgroup of the homology cobordism group (by taking connected sums of the Poincaré sphere with itself), though the question asks for elements represented by a single surgery. However, different integral surgeries on the trefoil knot can produce other homology spheres, such as other Brieskorn spheres, which are also known to generate elements of infinite order and can be distinct from each other in the homology cobordism group.\n\n*   **Integral Surgery on the Figure-Eight Knot:** The figure-eight knot is also non-trivial and provides additional elements to the homology cobordism group. For instance, 0-surgery on the figure-eight knot results in a manifold that is not homology cobordant to the 3-sphere. While the figure-eight knot itself has a finite order (order 2) in the knot concordance group, the 3-manifolds resulting from its surgeries still contribute to the landscape of the homology cobordism group.\n\nSince both surgery on the unknot and surgery on the trefoil knot can each produce infinitely many distinct elements in the homology cobordism group, the total number of such elements is infinite.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
