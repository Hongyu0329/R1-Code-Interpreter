    "Andrei Voznesensky's rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" tells the story of the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Rezanov. Rezanov was a naval officer and a central figure in the Russian-American Company, which promoted the colonization of Alaska and California.\n\nRezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807, and his original grave was destroyed during the Soviet era. A monument erected in 1831 was destroyed in the 1930s. The question of his final resting place became a subject of renewed interest, and in the late 20th century, a new memorial was dedicated at his presumed burial site in Krasnoyarsk. The memorial features a white cross with the inscription, \"I will never forget you,\" a quote from Voznesensky's work.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
