    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nand\nP2 = [[s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. A standard method for finding the GCRD of two matrices P1 and P2 is to find the greatest common left divisor (GCLD) of their transposes, P1^T and P2^T, and then transpose the result.\n\nThe GCLD of two matrices A and B can be found by forming a stacked matrix M = [A; B] and reducing it to a row-echelon form [G; 0] using elementary row operations (swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, or adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another). The resulting matrix G is a GCLD of A and B.\n\nLet's define A = P1^T and B = P2^T:\nA = P1^T = [[s^2 + s, -s^2 - 1],\n            [-s,       s^2]]\n\nB = P2^T = [[s,       -s - 1],\n            [0,        1]]\n\nNow, form the stacked matrix M = [A; B]:\nM =\nR1: [s^2 + s,  -s^2 - 1]\nR2: [-s,        s^2]\nR3: [s,        -s - 1]\nR4: [0,         1]\n\nWe perform elementary row operations to reduce M.\nFirst, use R4 to eliminate the second column entries in the other rows.\n1.  R1 → R1 + (s^2 + 1) * R4\n    [s^2 + s, -s^2 - 1 + (s^2 + 1)*1] = [s^2 + s, 0]\n2.  R2 → R2 - s^2 * R4\n    [-s, s^2 - s^2*1] = [-s, 0]\n3.  R3 → R3 + (s + 1) * R4\n    [s, -s - 1 + (s + 1)*1] = [s, 0]\n\nThe matrix becomes:\nR1': [s^2 + s,   0]\nR2': [-s,        0]\nR3': [s,         0]\nR4': [0,         1]\n\nNow, we work on the first three rows which have a non-zero first column.\n4.  R1' → R1' + (s + 1) * R2'\n    [s^2 + s + (s + 1)*(-s), 0] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, 0] =\n5.  R3' → R3' + R2'\n    [s + (-s), 0] =\n\nThe matrix is now:\n[0,   0]\n[-s,  0]\n[0,   0]\n[0,   1]\n\nBy swapping rows and multiplying R2 by -1, we can bring it to the final reduced form:\n[[s, 0],\n,\n,\n]\n\nThe non-zero part is G = [[s, 0],]. This is a GCLD of P1^T and P2^T.\n\nThe GCRD of P1 and P2 is the transpose of G.\nGCRD(P1, P2) = G^T = [[s, 0],]^T = [[s, 0],].\n\n<<<[[s, 0],]>>>"
