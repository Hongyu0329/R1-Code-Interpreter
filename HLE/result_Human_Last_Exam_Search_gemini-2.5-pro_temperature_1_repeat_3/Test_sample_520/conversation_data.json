    "I have been unable to find any information regarding a Belgian refugee named Andre Vernault who was suspected of being a German spy by British counterintelligence during World War II due to concealing his profession.\n\nExtensive searches using various spellings of the name and different keyword combinations related to Belgian refugees, espionage, and World War II in the United Kingdom have not yielded any specific case matching this description. Historical records and online resources covering this period discuss the general suspicion and vetting of refugees by agencies like MI5, including the interrogation of individuals at facilities such as the Royal Victoria Patriotic School. However, the particular story of Andre Vernault and the profession he allegedly concealed could not be verified through the available search results.\n\nIt is possible that the name is incorrect, the details of the case have been altered over time, or it is a story that is not publicly documented in the searched archives. Therefore, his true profession cannot be identified."
