    "### Unraveling the Optimal Ni/Ce Ratio for Enhanced Catalysis in Water Gas Shift and Water Splitting Reactions\n\nThe ideal nickel-to-cerium (Ni/Ce) ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is not a one-size-fits-all answer, with distinct optimal ranges emerging for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting. The ideal composition is intricately linked to the specific reaction conditions, the presence of dopants, and the morphology of the catalyst.\n\nFor the **Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, a key process in producing high-purity hydrogen, research indicates that a nickel content in the range of **5 to 15 wt%** is highly effective. One study focusing on the reverse WGS reaction identified an optimal nickel proportion of approximately **7% molar** for CO2 reduction. Another investigation found that catalysts with nickel content between 5 and 12.5 wt% demonstrate significant activity for the WGS reaction. Furthermore, a 15 wt% NiO/CeO2 catalyst was reported to be both active and stable for CO oxidation. The introduction of other elements can also influence the ideal ratio, as seen in a highly active Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂ catalyst, where the presence of tungsten plays a crucial role.\n\nIn the realm of **water splitting** for hydrogen production, the optimal Ni/Ce ratio varies depending on whether the focus is on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the two half-reactions of water splitting.\n\nFor the **hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)**, a computational study predicted that a **3Ni/1Ce ratio** provides a favorable adsorption energy for water splitting. Experimental work has shown that a catalyst with a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2, specifically Ni₃N-2CeO₂/NF, exhibits the best HER performance.\n\nFor the **oxygen evolution reaction (OER)**, catalysts with Ni/Ce molar ratios of **75:25 and 50:50** have demonstrated strong performance. In studies involving co-doping, a combination of nickel and iron in a 1:1 ratio at a high concentration of 20 mol% in ceria has been shown to be effective for overall water splitting, highlighting the synergistic effects of multiple dopants.\n\nIn conclusion, while Ni-Ceria nanoparticles are promising for both the WGS reaction and water splitting, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is highly dependent on the specific application. For the WGS reaction, a nickel loading of 5-15 wt% appears to be a favorable range. For water splitting, the optimal ratio is more nuanced, with different compositions being ideal for the HER and OER, and is also sensitive to the presence of other catalytic promoters.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio to maximize catalytic performance differs for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting. For the WGS reaction, an optimal range is between 5 and 15 wt% of nickel. For water splitting, the ideal ratio varies, with a 3Ni/1Ce ratio being favorable for the overall reaction, a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 being optimal for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and Ni/Ce ratios of 75:25 or 50:50 being effective for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).>>>"
