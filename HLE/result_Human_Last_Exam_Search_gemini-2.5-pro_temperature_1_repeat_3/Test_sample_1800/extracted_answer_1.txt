The ideal Ni/Ce ratio to maximize catalytic performance differs for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting. For the WGS reaction, an optimal range is between 5 and 15 wt% of nickel. For water splitting, the ideal ratio varies, with a 3Ni/1Ce ratio being favorable for the overall reaction, a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 being optimal for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and Ni/Ce ratios of 75:25 or 50:50 being effective for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
