    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** of the neutron noise in the nuclear criticality community.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), describes the probability of finding a pair of neutrons separated by a distance r and a time interval t. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space and time provides information about the frequency and wavevector dependence of the neutron fluctuations in the system.\n\nThis transformed function is more generally known in condensed matter physics and scattering theory as the dynamic structure factor, S(q, ω). However, within the nuclear criticality community, the focus is typically on analyzing the temporal fluctuations of the neutron population to determine reactor parameters, such as the prompt neutron decay constant, α.\n\nExperimental techniques like the Rossi-alpha and Feynman-alpha methods are employed to measure these time correlations. The Rossi-alpha method, for instance, directly measures the time correlation between neutron detection events, which is a component of the pair correlation function. The Fourier transform of this time correlation function yields the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the neutron noise. The PSD reveals the characteristic frequencies of the system, with the prompt neutron decay constant (alpha) being a prominent feature. Therefore, in the context of nuclear criticality safety analysis, the space-time double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is most commonly referred to as the Power Spectral Density.\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the neutron noise>>>"
