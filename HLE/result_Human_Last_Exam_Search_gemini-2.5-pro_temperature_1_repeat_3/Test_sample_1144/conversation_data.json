    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Calculate the uncertainty in the electron's momentum using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n2.  Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.\n3.  Compute the ratio of these two values.\n\n### 1. Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) must be at least of the order of the reduced Planck constant (ħ). The formal relation is:\nΔx ⋅ Δp ≥ h / 4π\n\nWhere:\n*   Δx is the uncertainty in position = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m\n*   h is the Planck constant ≈ 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n\nWe can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) from this principle:\nΔp ≈ h / (4π ⋅ Δx)\nΔp ≈ (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (4π ⋅ 10 x 10⁻¹² m)\nΔp ≈ 5.273 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n### 2. Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p)\n\nAccording to Bohr's model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron in the n-th orbit is quantized:\nL = n ⋅ (h / 2π)\n\nFor the first Bohr orbit, the principal quantum number (n) is 1. Angular momentum is also defined as L = p ⋅ r, where p is the linear momentum and r is the orbit's radius.\n\nTherefore, for the first orbit (n=1):\np ⋅ r₁ = 1 ⋅ (h / 2π)\np = h / (2π ⋅ r₁)\n\nThe radius of the first Bohr orbit (r₁) for a hydrogen atom is a well-established physical constant, known as the Bohr radius (a₀), which is approximately 52.9 pm or 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n\nNow, we can calculate the momentum:\np ≈ (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s) / (2π ⋅ 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\np ≈ 1.993 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s.\nThis value is consistent with calculations made using the electron's velocity in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n### 3. Ratio of Uncertainty in Momentum to Momentum (Δp / p)\n\nFinally, we calculate the ratio:\nRatio = Δp / p\nRatio ≈ (5.273 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s) / (1.993 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nRatio ≈ 2.646\n\nThis result indicates that the uncertainty in the electron's momentum is more than two and a half times its actual momentum in the first Bohr orbit when its position is localized to a region of 10 picometers.\n\n<<<2.646>>>"
