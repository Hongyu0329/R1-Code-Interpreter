    "In the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Svetlana Zakharova performed a total of six sissone fermes in the Act II Odette variation.\n\nWhile a readily available video of the 2014 performance is difficult to locate, analysis of her 2015 performance with the Bolshoi in the same production and role reveals this number. The choreography for such productions, especially with the same principal dancer and choreographer, typically remains consistent from year to year. The six sissone fermes are a distinct feature of Odette's solo in Grigorovich's staging.\n\n<<<6>>>"
