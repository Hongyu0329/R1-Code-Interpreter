I was unable to find an island town that meets all the specified criteria. Tristan da Cunha is the most remote, but its town and bay don't match the naming and geographical requirements. Easter Island's town and bay share a name, but the bay is not a caldera. Aogashima has a village in a caldera but is not remote enough.
