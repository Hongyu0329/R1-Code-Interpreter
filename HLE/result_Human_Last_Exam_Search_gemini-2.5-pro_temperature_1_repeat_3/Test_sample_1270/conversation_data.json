    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is a chemical pun based on the structure of benzene and the logo of Mercedes-Benz. The commonly accepted structure for this molecule is 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene.\n\nThis structure consists of a central benzene ring to which three other benzene rings (as phenyl groups) are attached at the first, third, and fifth carbon atoms.\n\nTo calculate the total number of carbon atoms:\n*   The central benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms.\n*   Each of the three attached phenyl groups has 6 carbon atoms.\n*   Therefore, the total number of carbons is 6 + (3 * 6) = 24.\n\nThe chemical formula for 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene is C24H18, which confirms it has 24 carbon atoms.\n\n<<<24>>>"
