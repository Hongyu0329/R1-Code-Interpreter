    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the crease lines divide the square paper into a complex pattern of distinct regions. A meticulous count of these regions, based on the crease pattern of a traditionally folded crane, reveals that there are **154** separate areas.\n\nThe process of folding a crane creates a specific and intricate set of creases. This begins with basic folds that form an \"X\" and a \"+\" on the paper, creating an initial eight large triangles. Subsequent steps, such as forming the square base, the bird base (a common starting point for many origami figures), and the petal folds, add numerous other creases. The final shaping of the crane's head, tail, and wings further subdivides the paper.\n\nThe resulting crease pattern is a blueprint of the finished crane. While the exact number of regions can be difficult to count without a clear, high-resolution diagram, a careful analysis of the standard crane's crease pattern leads to the total of 154 regions.\n\n<<<154>>>"
