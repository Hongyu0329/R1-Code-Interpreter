    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat of a system with short-range interactions is determined using the epsilon (ε) expansion near the upper critical dimension, which is d_c = 4.\n\nThe epsilon expansion is a perturbative approach where the critical exponents are calculated as a power series in the small parameter ε = d_c - d. For a system with a spatial dimension of d=3, the value of epsilon is ε = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nFor the universality class of the Ising model (an n-vector model with n=1), which is a common reference for such systems, the specific heat exponent α can be expressed to the first order in ε as:\n\nα = (4-n)ε / 2(n+8)\n\nFor n=1, this simplifies to:\n\nα = 3ε / 18 = ε / 6\n\nBy substituting ε = 1 for a three-dimensional system, we obtain the value of the scaling exponent α.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
