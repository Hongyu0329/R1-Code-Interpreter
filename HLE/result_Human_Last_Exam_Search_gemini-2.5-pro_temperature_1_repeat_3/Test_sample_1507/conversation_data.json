    "The minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\nThe great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron, meaning its faces intersect each other. The \"outer-hull,\" or more formally the convex hull, of the great icosahedron is the smallest convex shape that encloses it. For the great icosahedron, its convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid that is composed of 20 equilateral triangular faces. Since the faces of the regular icosahedron are already triangles, the surface of the outer-hull is already triangulated by its own faces. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed for this triangulation is simply the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\n\n<<<20>>>"
