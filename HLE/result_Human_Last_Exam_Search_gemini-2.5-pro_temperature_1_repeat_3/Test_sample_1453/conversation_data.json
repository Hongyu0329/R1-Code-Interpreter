    "Based on the principles of knobs-into-holes packing and the identities of the amino acids at the core positions of the coiled-coil, the oligomeric state of the protein can be predicted.\n\nFirst, the provided amino acid sequence, **GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG**, needs to be analyzed to identify the heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `abcdefg`. In this pattern, the 'a' and 'd' positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues and form the core of the coiled-coil structure, dictating its oligomeric state through knobs-into-holes packing.\n\nBy aligning the sequence, we can determine the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions. A consistent hydrophobic repeat suggests the following registration:\n\n`g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a`\n`G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\nThis alignment reveals a highly regular pattern for the core positions:\n*   **'a' positions:** Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I), Isoleucine (I)\n*   **'d' positions:** Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L), Leucine (L)\n\nThe key to determining the oligomeric state lies in the specific combination of amino acids at these 'a' and 'd' positions. Landmark studies on the GCN4 coiled-coil have established rules for how these residues influence oligomerization.\n\nThe findings from these studies can be summarized as follows:\n*   **Dimer (Oligomeric state of 2):** Favored when Isoleucine (a β-branched amino acid) is at the 'a' position and Leucine (a γ-branched amino acid) is at the 'd' position. This specific arrangement provides optimal packing efficiency for a two-stranded coiled-coil.\n*   **Trimer (Oligomeric state of 3):** Tends to form when Isoleucine is present at both the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n*   **Tetramer (Oligomeric state of 4):** Favored when the arrangement is reversed, with Leucine at the 'a' position and Isoleucine at the 'd' position.\n\nThe sequence in question, with Isoleucine consistently at the 'a' positions and Leucine at the 'd' positions, perfectly matches the established pattern for the formation of a dimer. The Tryptophan (W) at a 'c' position is on the outside of the coil and does not affect the core packing. Therefore, the protein is expected to have an oligomeric state of 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
