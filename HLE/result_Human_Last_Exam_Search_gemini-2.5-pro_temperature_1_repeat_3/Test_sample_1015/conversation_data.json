    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso, with the hips held level. The movement is initiated from the upper back, and the core is engaged to support the spine, ensuring the hips do not displace. This method prioritizes a clean and precise line, with the stability of the torso and hips being a fundamental principle.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine technique often encourages more dynamic and exaggerated lines. This can include a greater sense of freedom in the upper body and a willingness to move off the strictly square alignment to create a more dramatic visual effect. In movements like an arabesque, Balanchine is known for an open hip that faces the audience, and this principle of creating longer, more dynamic lines can extend to the cambré derrière, allowing for a different hip placement than in the Vaganova method. The Balanchine style is also characterized by its speed and fluidity of movement.\n\nWhile there may also be subtle differences in arm placement, speed, the degree of the backbend, and head placement, the foundational difference in the use of the torso and hips is a primary distinguishing feature.\n\n<<<B>>>"
