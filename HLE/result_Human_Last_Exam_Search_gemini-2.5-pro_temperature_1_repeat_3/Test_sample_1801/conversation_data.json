    "The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Amartya Sen.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, a Nobel Prize winner in Physics, is explicitly mentioned in multiple sources as having appeared in the commercials. A book on business ethics also notes that Gell-Mann, along with other physicists, inspired further thinking on complex systems.\n\nThe involvement of Amartya Sen, a Nobel laureate in Economic Sciences, is supported by his known connections to individuals and institutions linked to Enron's campaign. While direct video evidence naming him in the commercial is scarce, his name appears in contexts related to Enron and its activities. For instance, Enron's engagement in India, Sen's country of origin, was a significant part of its international operations. Furthermore, Sen's work on ethics and economics was a topic of discussion in the aftermath of the Enron scandal.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
