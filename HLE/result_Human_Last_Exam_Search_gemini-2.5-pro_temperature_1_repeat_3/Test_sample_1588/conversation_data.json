    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 99.\n\nThe terms of order *n* in the BCH formula, which expresses the solution *Z* to the equation e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup> = e<sup>Z</sup> for non-commuting *X* and *Y*, correspond to the basis elements of the free Lie algebra with two generators of degree *n*. The number of these basis elements, and thus the number of nonzero coefficients, is given by Witt's formula.\n\nWitt's formula for the dimension of the *n*-th homogeneous component of a free Lie algebra with *k* generators is:\n\n*l*<sub>*n*</sub>(*k*) = (1/*n*) Σ<sub>*d*|*n*</sub> μ(*d*) *k*<sup>*n*/*d*</sup>\n\nwhere the sum is over the divisors *d* of *n*, and μ is the Möbius function. For the BCH expansion of two operators, *k* = 2.\n\nFor order *n* = 10, the divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The corresponding values of the Möbius function are:\n*   μ(1) = 1\n*   μ(2) = -1\n*   μ(5) = -1\n*   μ(10) = 1\n\nSubstituting these values into Witt's formula gives:\n\n*l*<sub>10</sub>(2) = (1/10) [μ(1)⋅2<sup>10/1</sup> + μ(2)⋅2<sup>10/2</sup> + μ(5)⋅2<sup>10/5</sup> + μ(10)⋅2<sup>10/10</sup>]\n*l*<sub>10</sub>(2) = (1/10) [1⋅2<sup>10</sup> + (-1)⋅2<sup>5</sup> + (-1)⋅2<sup>2</sup> + 1⋅2<sup>1</sup>]\n*l*<sub>10</sub>(2) = (1/10) [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]\n*l*<sub>10</sub>(2) = (1/10)\n*l*<sub>10</sub>(2) = 99\n\nThis number is confirmed by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The sequence A001037, which counts the number of binary Lyndon words of length *n* and is equivalent to the dimension of the *n*-th homogeneous component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, gives the value 99 for *n*=10.\n\n<<<99>>>"
