To cope with the silence and the sterile environment of the station, one of the scientists, Gibarian, devises a simple yet ingenious method of taping strips of paper to the air vents to simulate the sound of rustling leaves. The protagonist, Kris Kelvin, also adopts this practice. However, the character of Dr. Sartorius initially makes fun of his colleagues for this sentimental act.
