    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide in refluxing THF, followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the formation of 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n*   **Reactants**: The starting material is 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene, a polyhalogenated aromatic compound. The reagent is phenylmagnesium bromide (PhMgBr), a Grignard reagent, which acts as a strong nucleophile and a strong base.\n*   **Reactivity of Halogens**: In nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, including Grignard cross-coupling, the reactivity of the halogens as leaving groups follows the order: I > Br > Cl > F. This is due to the bond strengths, with the C-I bond being the weakest and most easily broken.\n*   **Reaction Sequence**:\n    1.  **First Substitution**: The first equivalent of phenyl magnesium bromide will preferentially react at the most reactive site, which is the carbon atom bonded to the iodine. This results in the substitution of the iodine atom with a phenyl group, forming 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n    2.  **Subsequent Substitutions**: The problem specifies the use of *excess* phenyl magnesium bromide and *refluxing* conditions. These conditions provide enough reactivity to also substitute the less reactive bromine atoms. The two bromine atoms on 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene will be sequentially replaced by phenyl groups.\n*   **Final Product**: After all three halogen atoms have been replaced by phenyl groups, the resulting molecule consists of a central benzene ring substituted with three phenyl groups at the 1, 2, and 3 positions.\n*   **Aqueous Work-up**: The final aqueous work-up step is standard procedure for Grignard reactions. It serves to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent and protonate any magnesium alkoxide intermediates, yielding the neutral organic product.\n*   **IUPAC Name**: The systematic IUPAC name for the final product, which has a benzene ring with phenyl groups at positions 1, 2, and 3, is **1,2,3-triphenylbenzene**.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
