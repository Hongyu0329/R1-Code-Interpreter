Charles needs to adjust his diet to ensure it is balanced and sustainable, rather than severely limiting multiple macronutrient groups at once. His initial focus should be on incorporating adequate amounts of healthy carbohydrates for energy and sufficient protein to maintain muscle and feel full, especially since he has started a new exercise program.

A diet that drastically limits fats, carbohydrates, and animal protein can lead to fatigue and may not be sustainable, particularly for a frequent traveler. Healthy carbohydrates, such as those from whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, are the body's main source of energy, which is crucial for his new workout routine. Adequate protein intake is vital for repairing muscle, managing metabolism, and promoting a feeling of fullness, which can help control overall calorie intake. While he chooses to limit animal protein, he must ensure sufficient intake from other sources. Healthy fats are also necessary for hormone balance and nutrient absorption.

For long-term success, especially given his high BMI, travel schedule, and history of seizures, Charles should prioritize a balanced, nutrient-dense diet over extreme restriction. This will provide the energy he needs, support his fitness goals, and make the diet easier to maintain while traveling.
