    "A total of 10 finite groups contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for all elements *a* and *b* in *S*, their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is considered maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by C. S. Anabanti and S. B. Hart. Their work confirmed that any finite group with a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 must have an order of 24 or less.\n\nA comprehensive table in their paper, \"Locally maximal product-free sets of size 3,\" lists all such groups. The finite groups that contain these sets are:\n\n*   **C₆** (Cyclic group of order 6)\n*   **C₈** (Cyclic group of order 8)\n*   **C₁₀** (Cyclic group of order 10)\n*   **C₁₂** (Cyclic group of order 12)\n*   **D₁₀** (Dihedral group of order 10)\n*   **D₁₂** (Dihedral group of order 12)\n*   **A₄** (Alternating group on 4 elements)\n*   **Q₁₂** (Dicyclic group of order 12)\n*   **C₂ x A₄** (Direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and the alternating group on 4 elements)\n*   **SL(2,3)** (Special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the finite field of 3 elements)\n\nThis gives a total of 10 distinct finite groups.\n\n<<<10>>>"
