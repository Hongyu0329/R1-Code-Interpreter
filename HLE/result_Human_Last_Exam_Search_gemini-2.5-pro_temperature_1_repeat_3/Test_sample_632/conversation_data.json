    "Until the late 19th century, the Pantheon in Rome's \"Piazza della Rotonda\" was flanked by a pair of bell towers. These were removed by the city administration between 1881 and 1883. It is likely that this is the unique architectural feature to which the question refers, although the date mentioned is 1950.\n\nThe twin bell towers were added to the Pantheon in the 17th century, during the papacy of Urban VIII, and are often attributed to the famous architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini. However, their addition was a point of contention among art critics and the Roman populace, who gave them the derogatory nickname \"the ass's ears.\"\n\nThe removal of the bell towers was part of a broader effort in the late 19th century to restore the Pantheon to its original, classical appearance by removing medieval and baroque additions. This initiative also included the demolition of several structures that were built adjoining the Pantheon over the centuries.\n\nWhile historical records show various changes to the Piazza della Rotonda throughout its long history, including the clearing of market stalls and the demolition of an ancient arch, the removal of the twin bell towers remains one of the most significant architectural alterations to the iconic square. There is no evidence of a major architectural feature being removed in the year 1950.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers of the Pantheon>>>"
