In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the expression:

`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  ϕ(x, τ) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(x, τ)`

where:
*   `ϕ(x, τ)` is the neutral scalar field.
*   `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature.
*   `τ` is the imaginary time coordinate.
*   `x` represents the spatial coordinates.
*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.
*   `∇²` is the spatial Laplacian operator.
*   `-∂_τ² - ∇²` is the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator.

This inner product represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action `S_E[ϕ]`, such that `S_E[ϕ] = ½ (ϕ, D_ϕ)`.
