    "In the framework of finite-temperature field theory, the partition function `Z` for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` is expressed through a functional integral over all field configurations that are periodic in imaginary time with a period `β = 1/T`, where `T` is the temperature. The expression is given by:\n\n`Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])`\n\nHere, `S_E[ϕ]` represents the Euclidean action for the scalar field. For a free, neutral scalar field with mass `m`, the Euclidean action is:\n\n`S_E[ϕ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ ½ (∂_μ ϕ)² + ½ m² ϕ² ]`\n\nIn this expression, the integral is performed over Euclidean spacetime, where the imaginary time coordinate `τ` ranges from 0 to `β`, and `x` represents the spatial coordinates. The Euclidean metric is used, so `(∂_μ ϕ)² = (∂_τ ϕ)² + (∇ϕ)².\n\nThe action `S_E[ϕ]` is quadratic in the field `ϕ` and can be written in the form of a general inner product. To identify the operator `D`, we can perform an integration by parts on the kinetic term. Assuming the field `ϕ` vanishes at spatial infinity and is periodic in `τ` (which makes the boundary terms vanish), the action can be rewritten as:\n\n`S_E[ϕ] = ½ ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(x, τ) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(x, τ)`\n\nThis expression for the action has the form `S_E[ϕ] = ½ (ϕ, Dϕ)`, a structure common in theories with Gaussian integrals. [2]\n\nThe inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is therefore identified as the integral part of this expression. It represents the integral of the field `ϕ` against the result of the differential operator `D` acting on `ϕ`.\n\nThus, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  ϕ(x, τ) D[ϕ(x, τ)]`\n\nwhere the differential operator `D` is given by:\n\n`D = -∂_μ∂^μ + m² = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²`\n\nHere, `-∂_μ∂^μ` is the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the expression:\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x  ϕ(x, τ) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(x, τ)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `ϕ(x, τ)` is the neutral scalar field.\n*   `β = 1/T` is the inverse temperature.\n*   `τ` is the imaginary time coordinate.\n*   `x` represents the spatial coordinates.\n*   `m` is the mass of the scalar field.\n*   `∇²` is the spatial Laplacian operator.\n*   `-∂_τ² - ∇²` is the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator.\n\nThis inner product represents the quadratic part of the Euclidean action `S_E[ϕ]`, such that `S_E[ϕ] = ½ (ϕ, D_ϕ)`."
