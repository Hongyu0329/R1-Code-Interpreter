    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion, denoted as a₂, for the spectral action of a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is a geometric invariant constructed from the curvature of the spacetime manifold and the field strength of the gauge field.\n\nThe heat kernel expansion is an asymptotic expansion of the trace of the heat kernel for a differential operator, in this case, the square of the Dirac operator D², as the proper time parameter *t* approaches zero:\n\nTr(e⁻ᵗᴰ²) ~ (4πt)⁻ᵈ/² Σ_{n=0}∞ aₙ tⁿ\n\nHere, *d* is the dimension of the manifold, and the coefficients *aₙ* are the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients. The spectral action is a function of the spectrum of the Dirac operator, and its asymptotic expansion is determined by these coefficients.\n\nFor a massless Dirac spinor field minimally coupled to a gauge field (with field strength *F*<sub>μν</sub>) on a *d*-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the square of the Dirac operator can be written in the form of a generalized Laplacian:\n\nD² = - (g<sup>μν</sup>∇<sub>μ</sub>∇<sub>ν</sub> + E)\n\nwhere ∇<sub>μ</sub> is the total covariant derivative including both the spin connection and the gauge connection, and *E* is an endomorphism given by:\n\nE = (1/4)R + (1/2)σ<sup>μν</sup>*F*<sub>μν</sub>\n\nwith *R* being the Ricci scalar and σ<sup>μν</sup> = (1/2)[γ<sup>μ</sup>, γ<sup>ν</sup>].\n\nThe second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient, a₂, is given by the integral over the manifold of a local density, also denoted by a₂(*x*):\n\na₂ = ∫ dᵈx √g a₂(*x*)\n\nThe trace of the density, tr(a₂(*x*)), has been calculated and is a standard result in quantum field theory in curved spacetime. For a four-dimensional manifold (*d*=4), the trace of the a₂ coefficient for a Dirac spinor is:\n<br>\ntr(a₂(*x*)) = (1/360) tr [ (5R² - 2R<sub>μν</sub>R<sup>μν</sup> + 2R<sub>μνρσ</sub>R<sup>μνρσ</sup>)𝟙 + 60R * E + 180E² + 30Ω<sub>μν</sub>Ω<sup>μν</sup> ]\n\nwhere 𝟙 is the identity in the spinor space, and Ω<sub>μν</sub> = [∇<sub>μ</sub>, ∇<sub>ν</sub>] is the curvature of the full connection. For a gauged Dirac field, this curvature is Ω<sub>μν</sub> = (1/4)R<sub>μνρσ</sub>γ<sup>ρ</sup>γ<sup>σ</sup> + *F*<sub>μν</sub>𝟙.\n\nUpon substituting the expressions for *E* and Ω<sub>μν</sub> and taking the trace over the spinor indices (with tr(𝟙) = 4 in 4D), the final expression for the trace of the a₂ coefficient is:\n\n**tr(a₂(*x*)) = (1/240) (5R² - 8R<sub>μν</sub>R<sup>μν</sup> - 7R<sub>μνρσ</sub>R<sup>μνρσ</sup>) - (1/12)tr(F<sub>μν</sub>F<sup>μν</sup>)**\n\nThis formula expresses the second coefficient in terms of the scalar curvature, the Ricci tensor, the Riemann tensor, and the field strength of the gauge field.\n\n<<<**tr(a₂(*x*)) = (1/240) (5R² - 8R<sub>μν</sub>R<sup>μν</sup> - 7R<sub>μνρσ</sub>R<sup>μνρσ</sup>) - (1/12)tr(F<sub>μν</sub>F<sup>μν</sup>)**>>>"
