    "The dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique is the European Tango.\n\nThe fundamental difference lies in the technical execution of the Tango compared to the other four \"swing\" dances (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, Quickstep).\n\n*   **Tango Technique:** Tango is characterized by staccato movements, no rise and fall, and a specific walking action. The Basic Reverse Turn in Tango is a precise sequence of steps, often described as \"Quick, Quick, Slow,\" which involves stepping forward, to the side, and then crossing or closing the feet. This action is compact and does not use the continuous, swinging momentum found in other ballroom dances. The turn is generated through sharp body rotation and specific foot placements, not through a flowing swing. Attempting to rotate more than the prescribed amount would require abandoning this core staccato technique, changing the footwork, and breaking the essential character of the dance.\n\n*   **Swing Dance Technique:** In contrast, the Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep are swing dances that use Contrary Body Movement (CBM), body sway, and continuous, flowing momentum to generate turns. This technique allows for more flexibility in the amount of rotation. While a standard amount of turn is prescribed for figures, it is technically possible to \"overturn\" or \"underturn\" them to navigate the dance floor or to enter into different alignments, even if it is sometimes difficult or not part of the standard syllabus. Similarly, while overturning a Reverse Turn in the Viennese Waltz is considered very difficult and not used to navigate corners, the continuous rotational nature of the dance doesn't make it technically impossible in the way it is in Tango.\n\nTherefore, the unique, non-swinging, and staccato nature of the European Tango's technique makes it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without fundamentally violating how the step is danced.\n\n<<<C>>>"
