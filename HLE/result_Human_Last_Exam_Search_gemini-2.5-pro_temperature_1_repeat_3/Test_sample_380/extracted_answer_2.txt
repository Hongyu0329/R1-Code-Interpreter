In summary, your expectation is correct. The calculation of normalized magnetic helicity for AIC waves should use the magnetic components perpendicular to the local magnetic field. The local magnetic field at the L1 point is not radial due to the Parker Spiral. Therefore, a coordinate transformation into a field-aligned system is the standard and necessary procedure for an accurate calculation. The use of Y and Z components from a non-aligned standard coordinate system would be an often-invalid simplification.
