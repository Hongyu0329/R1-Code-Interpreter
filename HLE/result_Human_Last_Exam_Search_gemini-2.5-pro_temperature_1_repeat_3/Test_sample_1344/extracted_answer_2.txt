A Hafnium-based Constrained-Geometry Catalyst (CGC) supported on sulfated alumina (AlS) represents the optimal combination. The switch between polymerization and degradation is achieved by changing reaction conditions: polymerization occurs at lower temperatures (~80-100°C) with olefin monomer, while hydrogenolysis is induced by increasing the temperature (~150-200°C) and introducing high-pressure hydrogen gas.
