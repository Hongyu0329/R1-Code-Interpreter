    "A barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each (K5), connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is referred to as the bottleneck edge.\n\nIn a randomized uniform gossiping protocol, a node is selected uniformly at random from the set of all nodes, and then this node selects one of its neighbors uniformly at random to communicate with. This defines how an edge is sampled.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation of the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge:\n\n1.  **Graph Structure**: The graph has N=10 nodes, divided into two K5 cliques.\n2.  **Node Degrees**:\n    *   A complete graph of 5 nodes (K5) has edges between all pairs of vertices. Each node in a standalone K5 has a degree of 4.\n    *   In the barbell graph, most nodes retain this degree. For each clique, 4 of the 5 nodes have a degree of 4.\n    *   The two nodes that are connected by the bottleneck edge have one additional connection. Their degree is the 4 connections within their own clique plus the 1 connection to the other clique, resulting in a degree of 5.\n    *   So, the graph has 8 nodes of degree 4 and 2 nodes of degree 5.\n3.  **Sampling the Bottleneck Edge**: Let the bottleneck edge connect node `u` and node `v`. The degrees of these nodes are `deg(u) = 5` and `deg(v) = 5`. The bottleneck edge is sampled in one of two mutually exclusive ways:\n    *   Node `u` is selected and it chooses to contact node `v`.\n    *   Node `v` is selected and it chooses to contact node `u`.\n4.  **Calculating the Probability**:\n    *   The probability of selecting any specific node from the 10 nodes is 1/10.\n    *   If node `u` is selected, the probability that it chooses node `v` from its 5 neighbors is 1/5. The combined probability of this event is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n    *   Similarly, if node `v` is selected, the probability that it chooses node `u` from its 5 neighbors is 1/5. The combined probability of this event is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n\nP(bottleneck edge) = P(u selects v) + P(v selects u) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1/25, or 0.04.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
