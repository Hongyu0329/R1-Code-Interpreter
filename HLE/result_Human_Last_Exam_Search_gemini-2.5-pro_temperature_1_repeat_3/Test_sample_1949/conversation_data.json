    "### The Don, Aras, and Hebrus are the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the Aeneid.\n\nWhen considering the real-world rivers referenced in the ancient text, the Don River, known in antiquity as the Tanais, stands out as the longest. It flows for approximately 1,870 kilometers (1,162 miles) through Russia to the Sea of Azov.\n\nThe second longest is the Aras River, referred to in the Aeneid by its Greek name, Araxes. This river stretches for about 1,072 kilometers (666 miles) and passes through Turkey, Armenia, Iran, and Azerbaijan.\n\nThe third in length is the Hebrus River, now known as the Maritsa. It has a length of approximately 480 kilometers (300 miles) and flows through Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey.\n\nVirgil's epic also features several other rivers. The most prominent of these is the Tiber, the river of Rome, which is 406 kilometers (252 miles) long. Additionally, the Aeneid mentions the mythological rivers of the underworld: Styx, Acheron, Cocytus, Lethe, and Phlegethon. While the Acheron is also a real river in Greece, its mythological counterpart in the underworld does not have a measurable length."
