The new food, likely velvet bean (*Mucuna pruriens*), is a significant natural source of L-DOPA, a precursor to dopamine. Its importance is twofold: 1) It pharmacologically mimics the effects of the recently withdrawn dopamine agonist medication by suppressing prolactin. 2) It poses a substantial clinical risk by increasing dopamine levels, which can severely exacerbate the patient's underlying schizophrenia.
