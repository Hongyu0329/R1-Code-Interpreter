    "There have been 27 players who have won the Triple Crown in Major League Baseball history. This number includes players from the American League, National League, and the Negro Leagues, which are now officially recognized in MLB's historical records.\n\nA player achieves the Triple Crown by leading their respective league in three specific statistical categories in a single season: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs).\n\nOf the 27 winners, four players have accomplished this feat multiple times, bringing the total number of Triple Crowns to 28. The players who have won the Triple Crown more than once are:\n*   **Oscar Charleston** (3 times)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (2 times)\n*   **Josh Gibson** (2 times)\n*   **Ted Williams** (2 times)\n\nThe most recent player to win the Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera in 2012 while playing for the Detroit Tigers in the American League. Before Cabrera, there was a 45-year gap without a Triple Crown winner. Other notable winners include Mickey Mantle (1956), Frank Robinson (1966), and Carl Yastrzemski (1967).\n\nThe inclusion of statistics from seven Negro Leagues from 1920 to 1948 added eight players to the official list of Triple Crown winners, such as Oscar Charleston, Josh Gibson, and Mule Suttles.\n\n<<<27>>>"
