The appropriate management for the patient involves a phased approach. Initially, the focus should be on managing the avulsed teeth sockets without replantation due to the 28-hour delay, which renders periodontal ligament cells non-viable.

For definitive treatment, her skeletal Class III condition (SNB 88Â°) presents options of corrective jaw surgery or dental camouflage
