    "The parametric curve is defined in two parts.\n\nFor the interval $t\\in[0,\\pi]$, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$. This describes the upper half of a unit circle, since for these values of $t$, $y \\ge 0$. The x-values range from $\\cos(0) = 1$ to $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$, and the y-values range from $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ down to $\\sin(0) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\n\nFor the interval $t\\in(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$. This can be recognized as the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin, with a horizontal semi-axis of length 1 and a vertical semi-axis of length 5. For this interval of $t$, the value of $\\sin t$ is negative, so the y-values are negative. The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$. The y-values range from $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ to 0.\n\nTo find the smallest square that circumscribes the figure, we need to determine the overall width and height of the composite shape.\n\n*   **Width (x-range):** Both parts of the curve span from $x = -1$ to $x = 1$. Therefore, the total width of the figure is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Height (y-range):** The first part of the curve covers y-values from 0 to 1. The second part covers y-values from -5 to 0. The total height of the figure is the difference between the maximum y-value (1) and the minimum y-value (-5), which is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe side length of the smallest square that can enclose the figure must be equal to the larger of its width and height. In this case, the height (6) is greater than the width (2). Therefore, the side length of the smallest circumscribing square is 6.\n\nThe area of this square is the side length squared.\n\nArea = $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
