I am unable to provide a specific upper bound without a precise definition of the term $(k_{k,\infty})$. The relationship between a "maximum norm" and "covolume" in the context of squarefree natural numbers is ambiguous due to non-standard notation. The answer depends on whether $(k_{k,\infty})$ refers to the regulator, the norm of ideal class group generators, or the norm of a lattice vector in the sense of geometry of numbers.
