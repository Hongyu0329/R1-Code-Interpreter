    "Fairy bees, 2020.\n\nThe currently used common name for the genus *Perdita* (Smith, 1853) in their native range of North America is \"fairy bees\". This name is fitting for these bees, which are among the smallest in the world, with some species measuring only about 2 millimeters in length.\n\nThe exact date when the name \"fairy bees\" was first used for this genus is not officially documented, and it appears to be a relatively recent moniker. An article from the Vermont Center for Ecostudies in April 2020 noted that common names for many bee genera were still in their infancy. However, by 2020, the term was being used in various online publications and university outreach materials. For example, a Florida State University Public Media blog post in August 2020 and an Ohio State University Extension blog post in September 2020 both refer to the genus *Perdita* as fairy bees. Some suggest the name may have been popularized through informal channels like social media.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 2020>>>"
