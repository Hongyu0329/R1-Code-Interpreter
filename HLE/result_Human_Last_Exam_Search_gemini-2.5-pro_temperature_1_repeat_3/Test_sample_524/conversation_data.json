    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA complete classification of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua was achieved in 2014 by Hoehn and Oversteegen, which settled a long-standing question in topology. They demonstrated that every non-degenerate homogeneous continuum in the plane must be homeomorphic to one of the following three types:\n\n1.  **The circle:** This is the most straightforward example of a homogeneous planar continuum.\n2.  **The pseudo-arc:** Discovered by Bing in 1948, the pseudo-arc is a complex, snake-like continuum that is hereditarily indecomposable, meaning it cannot be broken down into two proper subcontinua. Any two pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic to each other.\n3.  **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This continuum, constructed by Bing and Jones in 1959, can be visualized as a circle where each point is replaced by a pseudo-arc. Similar to the pseudo-arc, any two circles of pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic.\n\nIn addition to these three non-degenerate continua, there is also the **degenerate case**:\n\n4.  **A single point:** A single point is a compact, connected metric space and is trivially homogeneous.\n\nTherefore, in total, there are four distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<4>>>"
