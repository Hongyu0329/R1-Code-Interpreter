    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which occurs where the supply and demand functions are equal. The total welfare is the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus at this equilibrium point.\n\n**1. Market Equilibrium**\n\nThe market equilibrium is found by setting the supply price equal to the demand price:\n*   Supply: `P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)`\n*   Demand: `P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n\nAt equilibrium, `Q_S = Q_D = Q*` and the prices are equal.\n`ln(Q*^3 - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q*))`\n\nDue to the complexity of this equation, a numerical solver is required to find the equilibrium quantity (Q\\*). Using computational tools, the solution is approximately:\n`Q* ≈ 4.689`\n\nWe can find the equilibrium price (P\\*) by substituting Q\\* into either the supply or demand function:\n`P* = ln(4.689^3 - 2) ≈ 4.618`\n`P* = 18e^(-arctan(4.689)) ≈ 4.618`\n\nThus, the market equilibrium point is approximately **(Q\\*, P\\*) = (4.689, 4.618)**.\n\n**2. Consumer Surplus (CS)**\n\nThe consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price. It is calculated by the definite integral:\n`CS = ∫[from 0 to Q*] (Demand P) dQ - (P* * Q*)`\n`CS = ∫[from 0 to 4.689] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - (4.618 * 4.689)`\n\nThe integral does not have a simple closed-form solution and must be evaluated numerically.\n`∫[from 0 to 4.689] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ ≈ 29.749`\n\n`P* * Q* ≈ 21.654`\n\n`CS ≈ 29.749 - 21.654 = 8.095`\n\n**3. Producer Surplus (PS)**\n\nThe producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. It's calculated by the integral:\n`PS = (P* * Q*) - ∫[from Q_min to Q*] (Supply P) dQ`\n\nThe supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is defined for `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, which means the minimum quantity `Q_min` is `2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26`.\n`PS = (4.618 * 4.689) - ∫[from 1.26 to 4.689] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`\n\nThis integral is also evaluated numerically:\n`∫[from 1.26 to 4.689] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ ≈ 11.144`\n\n`PS ≈ 21.654 - 11.144 = 10.510`\n\n**4. Total Welfare (TW)**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.\n`TW = CS + PS`\n`TW ≈ 8.095 + 10.510 = 18.605`\n\nAlternatively, total welfare can be calculated directly by summing the integral of the demand function and subtracting the integral of the supply function over their respective domains up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\n`TW = ∫[from 0 to Q*] (Demand P) dQ - ∫[from Q_min to Q*] (Supply P) dQ`\n`TW ≈ 29.749 - 11.144 = 18.605`\n\n<<<18.605>>>"
