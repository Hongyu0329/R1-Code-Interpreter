    "In Natalia Osipova's renowned 2008 performance of the Kitri variation in Act I of *Don Quixote* with the Bolshoi Ballet, she did not perform any single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n\nThe choreography of Kitri's Act I variation does not traditionally include single pirouettes from the fifth position. The variation is famous for a fast-paced diagonal of piqu√© turns, which are a different type of turn. While Osipova's performance is celebrated for its technical brilliance and high energy, the specific step mentioned in the question is not part of the standard choreography she performed.\n\nTherefore, the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position performed by Osipova in that particular variation is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
