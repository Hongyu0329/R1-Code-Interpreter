    "The leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, in ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions can be determined through the epsilon expansion, where ϵ = 4 - d and d is the number of spatial dimensions.\n\nThe renormalization group beta function for the coupling constant *u* to one-loop order is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²))u²\n\nA fixed point, u*, is a value of the coupling where the beta function vanishes, meaning the coupling does not change with the energy scale. Therefore, we set β(u*) = 0:\n\n-ϵu* + (3 / (16π²))(u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions. One is the trivial Gaussian fixed point at u* = 0. The other is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point. To find it, we can divide by u* (assuming u* ≠ 0):\n\n-ϵ + (3 / (16π²))u* = 0\n\nSolving for u* yields the leading order expression in ϵ:\n\nu* = (16π² / 3)ϵ\n\nThis result is valid for small positive ϵ.\n\n<<<u* = (16π² / 3)ϵ>>>"
