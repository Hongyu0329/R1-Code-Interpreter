    "True.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), which is measured by the amount of phenotypic variance it explains (R²), is practically always lower than the SNP heritability for the same trait.\n\nSNP heritability (h²_snp) represents the proportion of variation in a phenotype that can be explained by all measured single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a given population. This value is considered the theoretical upper limit or ceiling for the predictive power of a polygenic score constructed from that set of SNPs.\n\nA polygenic score is a tool that aggregates the effects of many genetic variants to predict an individual's genetic predisposition to a trait. However, the creation of a PGS relies on data from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) to estimate the effect size of each variant. Several factors cause the predictive power of a PGS to be lower than the SNP heritability:\n\n*   **Estimation Error:** The effect sizes from GWAS are estimates and contain statistical noise or error, especially for variants with small effects or in studies with limited sample sizes.\n*   **\"Hidden\" or \"Missing\" Heritability:** Current PGS methods and GWAS may not capture all the genetic variants contributing to a trait, leading to a gap between the variance explained by the PGS and the estimated SNP heritability.\n*   **Sample Differences:** The predictive accuracy of a PGS can decrease if the characteristics of the sample in which the score is being tested differ from the characteristics of the sample from which the original GWAS data were derived.\n\nIn an idealized theoretical scenario, if the effect sizes of all causal SNPs were known without any error, the variance explained by the polygenic score could, in principle, equal the SNP heritability. However, since this is never the case in practice with finite GWAS samples, the predictive ability of a polygenic score is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability. As GWAS sample sizes increase, the accuracy of the effect size estimates improves, and the predictive power of the PGS can get closer to the SNP heritability.\n\n<<<True>>>"
