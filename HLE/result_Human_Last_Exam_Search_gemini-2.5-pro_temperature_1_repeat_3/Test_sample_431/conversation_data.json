    "Based on the analysis of the amino acid sequence of the human GABAAρ1 receptor subunit (UniProt accession number P24046), there is one Cysteine residue located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain.\n\nThe transmembrane domains are located at the following positions in the amino acid sequence:\n*   **TM3:** 342-362\n*   **TM4:** 454-474\n\nThe linker domain between TM3 and TM4 therefore spans from amino acid 363 to 453. The sequence for this linker is:\n\n`EYAAVNYLTTVQERKEQKLREKLPCTSGLPPPRTAMLDGNYSDGEVNDLDNYMPENGEKPDRMMVQLTLASERSSPQRKSQRSSYVSMRIDTHAIDKYSRIIFPAAYILFNLIY`\n\nWithin this sequence, there is a single Cysteine (C) residue at position 378.\n\nA study also identified a single intracellular cysteine residue in the TM3-TM4 linker of the ρ1 subunit.\n\n<<<1>>>"
