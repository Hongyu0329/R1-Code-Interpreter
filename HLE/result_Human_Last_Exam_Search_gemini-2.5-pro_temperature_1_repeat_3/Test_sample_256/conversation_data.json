    "The symmetry group of the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C1.\n\nThis is according to the comprehensive database of circle packings provided by Eckard Specht. In this database, for a packing of N=1135 circles, the specified symmetry group is C1.\n\nThe Schoenflies notation C1 denotes a group with no symmetry elements other than the identity element, which corresponds to a full 360-degree rotation. In other words, the arrangement of the 1135 circles lacks any rotational or reflectional symmetry.\n\n<<<C1>>>"
