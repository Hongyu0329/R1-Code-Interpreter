    "The stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x^5 + x^2 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + 8x$ over the 2-adic field has 5 double points.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of this number:\n\n1.  **Genus of the Curve**: The equation is of the form $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 5. This defines a hyperelliptic curve. The genus $g$ of such a curve is given by the formula $g = \\lfloor (\\deg(f)-1)/2 \\rfloor$. In this case, $g = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\n\n2.  **Transformation of the Model**: To analyze the reduction properties, it is often helpful to find a more suitable model of the curve through a change of variables. By substituting $x = X/2$ and $y = Y/2$, the original equation is transformed into:\n    $Y^2 = X^5 + X^4 + 2X^3 + X^2 + 16X$.\n    This new equation defines a curve over the 2-adic integers that is birationally equivalent to the original curve, and thus has the same stable reduction.\n\n3.  **Valuations of the Roots**: The structure of the stable reduction is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial defining the curve. We use the Newton polygon method to find these valuations for the polynomial $f_1(X) = X(X^4 + X^3 + 2X^2 + X + 16)$.\n    *   One root is evidently $X=0$.\n    *   For the other four roots, which are the roots of $g_1(X) = X^4 + X^3 + 2X^2 + X + 16$, the Newton polygon shows that there is one root with a 2-adic valuation of 4, and three roots with a 2-adic valuation of 0.\n\n4.  **Root Clustering**: The components of the stable reduction correspond to \"clusters\" of roots. Two roots, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, belong to the same cluster if the 2-adic valuation of their difference, $v_2(\\alpha - \\beta)$, is positive.\n    *   Let the roots of $f_1(X)$ be $r_0=0$, $r_1$ (with $v_2(r_1)=4$), and $r_2, r_3, r_4$ (with $v_2(r_i)=0$).\n    *   Since $v_2(r_0 - r_1) = v_2(r_1) = 4 > 0$, the roots $0$ and $r_1$ form a single cluster.\n    *   The roots $r_2, r_3, r_4$ all have valuation 0. Reducing the polynomial $g_1(X)$ modulo 2 gives $X(X^3+X^2+1)$. The three roots with valuation 0 correspond to the roots of the irreducible polynomial $X^3+X^2+1$, which are distinct. This implies that for $i \\neq j$ among $\\{2,3,4\\}$, the difference $r_i-r_j$ is a 2-adic unit, so $v_2(r_i-r_j) = 0$. Therefore, each of these three roots forms its own cluster.\n    *   This analysis reveals a total of 4 distinct clusters of roots.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Number of Double Points**: For a curve of genus $g$, the number of double points (nodes) in its stable reduction, $N$, is related to the number of components, $k$, by the formula:\n    $N = g - 1 + k$\n    This formula assumes that the components of the stable reduction are rational curves (genus 0), which is the case here.\n    *   With genus $g=2$ and the number of components $k=4$, the calculation is:\n        $N = 2 - 1 + 4 = 5$.\n\nThus, the stable reduction of the given curve has 5 double points.\n\n<<<5>>>"
