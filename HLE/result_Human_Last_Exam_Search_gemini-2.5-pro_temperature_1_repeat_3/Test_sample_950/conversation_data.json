    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 3.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of the result:\n\n1.  **The Space:** The space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G(3, 5)$. This space is diffeomorphic to the Grassmannian of 2-planes in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, denoted $G(2, 5)$, by taking the orthogonal complement of each 3-subspace. Therefore, their cohomology rings are isomorphic.\n\n2.  **Integral Cohomology:** The integral cohomology groups, $H^k(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, describe the topological structure of this space. These groups can have both a free part (copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$) and a torsion part (finite cyclic groups). The torsion in the cohomology of real Grassmannians is known to be entirely 2-torsion, meaning every torsion element has order 2.\n\n3.  **Cohomology Groups of $G(2, 5)$:** The integral cohomology groups of $G(2, 5)$ have been computed and are as follows:\n    *   $H^0(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H^1(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n    *   $H^2(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n    *   $H^3(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n    *   $H^4(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $H^5(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n    *   $H^k(G(2, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k \\ge 6$\n\n4.  **The Torsion Subgroup:** The torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each cohomology group. From the list above, the torsion parts are found in degrees 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   Torsion in $H^2$: $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n    *   Torsion in $H^3$: $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n    *   Torsion in $H^5$: $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\n    Thus, the total torsion subgroup $T$ is the direct sum $T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n5.  **The Rank of the Torsion Subgroup:** The term \"rank\" of an abelian group formally refers to the number of independent generators of its free part. Since a torsion group by definition has no free part, its rank is strictly 0. However, in the context of group theory and topology, \"rank\" is often used to denote the number of generators of the group. For the group $T \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$, which is a vector space over the field $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, this corresponds to its dimension, which is 3. This is also referred to as the \"2-rank\" of the group. Given the specific nature of the question, this is the intended meaning.\n\nThe torsion subgroup is generated by three elements, one in degree 2, one in degree 3, and one in degree 5.\n\n<<<3>>>"
