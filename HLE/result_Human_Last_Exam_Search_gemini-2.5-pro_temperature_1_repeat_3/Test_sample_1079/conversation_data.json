    "An element of a reflection group is considered \"regular\" if its eigenspace is not on any of the reflection hyperplanes. The question asks for the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that possess a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10. The order of the H3 group is 120, and its Coxeter number is 10.\n\nAn element with a regular eigenvector is by definition a regular element. If such an element has an eigenvalue of order 10, the element's order must be a multiple of 10. For any finite Coxeter group, the order of a regular element must divide the Coxeter number, h. In this case, h=10. Consequently, the order of the elements in question must be exactly 10.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of regular elements of order 10 in the H3 group. The number of regular elements of order *d* (where *d* divides *h*) in a finite Coxeter group *W* can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber = φ(d) * |W| / h\n\nWhere:\n*   φ(d) is Euler's totient function, which counts the positive integers up to a given integer *d* that are relatively prime to *d*.\n*   |W| is the order of the group.\n*   h is the Coxeter number.\n\nFor this specific problem:\n*   d = 10\n*   |W| (the order of H3) = 120\n*   h (the Coxeter number of H3) = 10\n*   φ(10) = 4, because there are four positive integers less than or equal to 10 that are relatively prime to 10 (1, 3, 7, 9).\n\nPlugging these values into the formula gives:\n\nNumber = 4 * 120 / 10 = 48\n\nThus, there are 48 such elements.\n\n<<<48>>>"
