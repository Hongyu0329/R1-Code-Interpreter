The post-reset covariance `Σ'` is computed from the pre-reset covariance `Σ` using the formula `Σ' = G * Σ * G^T`, where `G` is the block matrix `G = [ J_l(δ_hat), 0; 0, I ]`. The matrix `J_l(δ_hat)` is the left Jacobian of the attitude deviation estimate `δ_hat` being reset. The exact expression for the left Jacobian of a vector `φ` with magnitude `θ = ||φ||` is: `J_l(φ) = I + (1 - cos(θ))/θ^2 * [φ]× + (θ - sin(θ))/θ^3 * [φ]×^2`, where `[φ]×` is the skew-symmetric matrix of `φ`.
