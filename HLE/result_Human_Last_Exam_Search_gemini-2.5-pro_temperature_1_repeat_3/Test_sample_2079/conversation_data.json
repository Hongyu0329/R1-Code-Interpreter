    "I am unable to identify the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 based on the available information.\n\nWhile historical records confirm that Bártfa was a free royal town with a town council, a judge, and lay judges during the 15th century, the specific name of the judge for the year 1461 is not mentioned in the accessible digital sources. The town was a significant economic and cultural center, and its administration was well-organized.\n\nDocuments from the era, such as letters and charters, refer to the \"judge and lay judges of Bártfa\" in the context of regional events, including military conflicts in 1461, but do not provide individual names for that year. For instance, records show that the town of Bártfa was involved in the siege of Sáros (Šariš) Castle in July 1461.\n\nThe most likely source to contain this specific information is a publication titled \"Bártfa szabad királyi város levéltára, 1319-1526\" (The Archives of the Free Royal Town of Bártfa, 1319-1526) by Béla Iványi, which is a comprehensive collection of the town's archival documents. However, the full content of this extensive work is not available through online searches. Similarly, the \"ius civile register of the city of Bardejov\" has been noted in academic research as a source for the town's history, but its specific contents for the year 1461 are not digitally accessible.\n\nTherefore, without access to these specific archival publications, the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 cannot be determined.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to the question.>>>"
