    "The sequence provided is a list of the total stopping times of the Collatz conjecture for the integers from 27 down to 1, followed by the stopping time for 124.\n\nThe Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3x+1 problem, involves a sequence where for a given number *n*, the next term is `n/2` if *n* is even, and `3n + 1` if *n* is odd. The conjecture posits that any starting positive integer will eventually reach 1. The \"total stopping time\" is the number of steps required to reach 1.\n\nThe provided sequence can be understood as follows:\n\n*   The sequence begins with the total stopping time for the number 27, which is 111 steps.\n*   It is followed by the stopping time for 26, which is 10.\n*   Then the stopping time for 25, which is 23.\n*   ...and so on, down to the stopping time for 1, which is 0.\n\nThe appearance of numbers like 142, 41, 67, etc. within the provided list are individual stopping time values for integers in the range of 27 down to 1. The repetitions, such as for 67, occur because different starting numbers can have the same total stopping time.\n\nThe last number in the provided sequence is 124, which is the total stopping time for the number 36. To find the next number in the sequence, we need to determine the total stopping time for the number that follows 36 in this descending series, which is 35.\n\nLet's calculate the Collatz sequence for the starting number 35:\n35 -> 106 -> 53 -> 160 -> 80 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1\n\nThe number of steps for 35 to reach 1 is 13.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
