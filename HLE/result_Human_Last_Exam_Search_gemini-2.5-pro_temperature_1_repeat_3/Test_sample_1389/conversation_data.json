    "An all-or-nothing vaccine provides complete protection to a portion of vaccinated individuals, while the rest receive no protection. In contrast, a leaky vaccine reduces the risk of infection for all vaccinated individuals by a certain percentage per exposure. The term \"vaccine efficacy\" (VE) is a population-level measure, often calculated as 1 minus the incidence rate ratio (1 - IRR).\n\nTo determine the relationship between 1-IRR and per-exposure efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine, consider the following:\n\n*   Let 'p' be the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected (100% efficacy).\n*   The remaining '1-p' proportion has no protection, meaning their susceptibility is the same as that of unvaccinated individuals.\n*   The incidence rate in the unvaccinated group is IRu.\n*   The incidence rate in the vaccinated group (IRv) is entirely due to infections in the unprotected subgroup. Therefore, IRv = (1-p) * IRu.\n*   The incidence rate ratio (IRR) is IRv / IRu = [(1-p) * IRu] / IRu = 1-p.\n*   The vaccine efficacy calculated from the incidence rate ratio is VE = 1 - IRR = 1 - (1-p) = p.\n\nThis calculation shows that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the standard VE measurement (1 - IRR) correctly estimates 'p', the proportion of the vaccinated population that is fully protected. This value, 'p', represents the vaccine efficacy against susceptibility.\n\nThe concept of \"per-exposure\" efficacy in an all-or-nothing model applies differently to the two subgroups of vaccinated individuals:\n*   For the protected group (proportion 'p'), the per-exposure efficacy is 100%.\n*   For the unprotected group (proportion '1-p'), the per-exposure efficacy is 0%.\n\nThe value calculated by `1 - IRR` is `p`, which is the average efficacy across the entire vaccinated population. Unless the vaccine is 100% effective (meaning p=1), this calculated efficacy (`p`) will be lower than the 100% per-exposure efficacy experienced by the protected individuals. However, the measure `1 - IRR` is considered an appropriate and direct measure of efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine model. It correctly estimates the proportion of people protected, which is the mechanism of action for this type of vaccine. Studies confirm that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the parameter for protective vaccine efficacy is equivalent to the direct effectiveness of the vaccine.\n\nTherefore, the `1-incidence rate ratio` correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy, interpreted as the proportion of individuals who are fully protected from any exposure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
