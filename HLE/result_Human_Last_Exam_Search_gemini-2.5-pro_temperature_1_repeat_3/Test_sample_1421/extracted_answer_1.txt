The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ e<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̄, ψ]</sup>, where ψ̄ and ψ are Grassmann-valued fermionic fields, Dψ̄ Dψ is the functional integration measure, and S<sub>E</sub> is the Euclidean action. The integral is performed over all field configurations that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction, i.e., ψ(x, τ + β) = -ψ(x, τ), where β is the inverse temperature.
