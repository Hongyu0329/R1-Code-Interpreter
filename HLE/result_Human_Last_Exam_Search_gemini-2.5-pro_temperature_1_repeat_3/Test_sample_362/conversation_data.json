    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes using a phosphonium ylide (Wittig reagent). The reaction mechanism involves the nucleophilic addition of the ylide to the carbonyl group, forming a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane. This intermediate then decomposes to yield the final alkene product and triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\nThe reactants in this specific case are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** An aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane:** This is the Wittig reagent, a phosphorus ylide. Its structure is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where Ph is a phenyl group and the chloro-substituted phenyl ring is attached to the ethylidene group.\n\nThe reaction proceeds by replacing the oxygen atom of the pivalaldehyde's carbonyl group (C=O) with the carbon part of the ylide (=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)). This results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nThe resulting product has the chemical structure (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl). Following IUPAC nomenclature rules, the longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a pentene chain. Numbering the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number (starting from the end with the chlorophenyl group), the product is named **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe stereochemistry of the alkene (whether it is the E or Z isomer) is determined by the nature of the ylide.\n*   **Stabilized ylides**, which have electron-withdrawing groups, typically produce the E-alkene.\n*   **Non-stabilized ylides**, which have electron-donating groups like alkyl groups, generally yield the Z-alkene as the major product.\n\nThe ylide in this reaction, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, has a substituted alkyl group attached to the carbanionic carbon. This classifies it as a **non-stabilized ylide**. Therefore, the reaction is expected to be Z-selective, predominantly forming **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThus, the principal product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
