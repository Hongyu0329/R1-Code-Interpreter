    "Two patches of surface code, each with two holes, can encode a maximum of **four** logical qubits.\n\nIn the surface code, a type of quantum error-correcting code, logical qubits can be encoded by introducing \"holes\" or defects into the lattice of physical qubits. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded on a given surface is determined by its topological properties. Specifically, each hole introduced into the surface code patch can encode one logical qubit.\n\nA standard surface code patch without any holes can typically encode a single logical qubit, depending on its boundary conditions. By creating holes in the lattice, one increases the number of non-trivial loops that can be drawn on the surface, which correspond to the logical operators of the encoded qubits.\n\nTherefore, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode two logical qubits. Since the problem specifies two such independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of those encoded in each patch.\n\nIt is worth noting that while it is possible to encode one logical qubit per hole, a common and practical method involves creating a pair of holes to define a single logical qubit. This is often done to simplify the application of logical operators. However, the fundamental capacity for encoding logical qubits is determined by the number of holes.\n\nThus, with two patches of surface code, each containing two holes, a maximum of four logical qubits can be encoded.\n\n<<<4>>>"
