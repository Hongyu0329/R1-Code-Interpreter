The number of cardinalities is not a fixed integer; it depends on axioms beyond ZFC, such as the Continuum Hypothesis. The number of cardinals in the interval is $|\beta+1|$, where $\aleph_\beta = 2^{\aleph_2}$. This can be a finite number (like 4, under GCH) or a large infinite cardinal (like $\aleph_2$ or larger) in other consistent models of set theory.
