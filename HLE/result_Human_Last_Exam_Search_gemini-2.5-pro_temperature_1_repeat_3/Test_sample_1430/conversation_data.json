    "Let C be a genus 3 Riemann surface and X be its 15th symmetric power, denoted as C^(15). We want to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted as ρ(X).\n\nThe structure of the symmetric power of a curve is deeply connected to its Jacobian variety. For a smooth projective curve C of genus g and an integer d, the d-th symmetric power C^(d) is a smooth projective variety. When d ≥ g, there is a fundamental relationship between the Picard group of C^(d) and the Picard group of the Jacobian of C, denoted Jac(C).\n\nIn this case, with genus g=3 and d=15, the condition d ≥ g is satisfied. The variety X = C^(15) is a projective bundle over the Jacobian of C. Specifically, X is a **P**^(15-3) = **P**^12 bundle over Jac(C). This structure leads to a direct relationship between their Néron-Severi groups. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is given by:\n\nρ(X) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety is minimal when the variety has the fewest possible endomorphisms. For a generic algebraic curve C of genus g, its Jacobian variety Jac(C) has an endomorphism ring that is just the integers, Z. In this case, the Néron-Severi group NS(Jac(C)) is of rank 1, generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\n\nFor a generic genus 3 curve C, we have ρ(Jac(C)) = 1.\nThis gives the smallest possible rank for ρ(X):\nρ_min(X) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group is maximized for special curves whose Jacobians have a large ring of endomorphisms, known as complex multiplication (CM). For a complex abelian variety of dimension g, the theoretical maximum for the rank of its Néron-Severi group is g^2. For a Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, this maximum is 3^2 = 9.\n\nThis maximum is achieved if the Jacobian is isogenous to a product of elliptic curves with complex multiplication. A prominent example of a genus 3 curve with this property is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0. The genus of this curve is (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3. The Jacobian of the Fermat quartic is isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 - x, which has complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers Z[i].\n\nFor such a curve C, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian is indeed 9.\nρ_max(Jac(C)) = 9.\n\nThis gives the largest possible rank for ρ(X):\nρ_max(X) = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
