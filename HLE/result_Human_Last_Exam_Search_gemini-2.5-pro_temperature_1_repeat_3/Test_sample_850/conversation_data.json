    "The question of which achiral and non-polar crystal classes exhibit optical activity is based on a nuanced understanding of crystallographic and optical principles. While it is a fundamental concept that optical activity is a property of chiral materials, there are specific instances where achiral crystals can display this phenomenon.\n\n### The Contradiction and the Nuance\n\nTypically, optical activity—the rotation of the plane of polarized light—is considered a hallmark of chirality. A chiral structure is one that cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. Crystal classes that are achiral possess symmetry elements of the second kind, such as mirror planes or a center of inversion, which would seemingly preclude optical activity. Similarly, non-polar crystal classes often have a center of symmetry, which also makes them achiral.\n\nHowever, a distinction arises between optical activity in the visible light spectrum and at other wavelengths, such as in the X-ray range. Furthermore, the interplay between molecular chirality and the overall crystal structure's symmetry can lead to surprising optical phenomena.\n\n### Optically Active Achiral Crystal Classes\n\nResearch has identified four crystal classes that are non-enantiomorphic (achiral) yet can exhibit optical activity. This behavior can be observed under specific conditions, for example, when the effect of birefringence, which is usually much stronger, is minimized.\n\nThe achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are:\n*   **Class m (C_s)**\n*   **Class mm2 (C_2v)**\n*   **Class -4 (S_4)**\n*   **Class -42m (D_2d)**\n\nThese crystal classes are all non-centrosymmetric, a necessary condition for optical activity, but they do contain mirror planes or rotoinversion axes, which makes them achiral. The observation of optical activity in these classes is a more complex phenomenon than in chiral crystals and is often studied using techniques like X-ray Natural Circular Dichroism (XNCD). For example, a study on copper metaborate, which belongs to the crystal class -42m, utilized circularly polarized X-rays to investigate its optical activity.\n\nIn summary, while the initial premise seems contradictory, there are indeed four specific achiral and non-polar crystal classes where the symmetry allows for the observation of optical activity, particularly when considering advanced experimental techniques and a broader definition of the phenomenon beyond simple solutions of chiral molecules.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are m (C_s), mm2 (C_2v), -4 (S_4), and -42m (D_2d).>>>"
