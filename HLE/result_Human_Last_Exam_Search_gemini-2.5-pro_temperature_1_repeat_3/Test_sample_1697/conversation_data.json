    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by the addition of methyl iodide, results in the formation of **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThis transformation is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) reaction. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction mechanism:\n\n1.  **Directed Ortho-Metalation:** The starting material has two functional groups that can direct the metalation: the N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂). Both are known as Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs) because the heteroatoms (oxygen and nitrogen) can coordinate to the lithium ion of the organolithium reagent. sec-Butyllithium is a very strong base, and its basicity is enhanced by the addition of TMEDA, which chelates the lithium ion and breaks up organolithium aggregates.\n\n2.  **Regioselectivity:** The amide group is at position 1 of the benzene ring, and the dimethylamino group is at position 3.\n    *   The amide group directs the deprotonation (lithiation) to the adjacent *ortho* positions (C2 and C6).\n    *   The dimethylamino group directs lithiation to its *ortho* positions (C2 and C4).\n\n    The C2 position is *ortho* to both directing groups. The tertiary amide group (-CONR₂) is a significantly stronger directing group than the tertiary amine group (-NR₂). Therefore, the lithiation occurs selectively at the C2 position, which is activated by both groups, leading to the formation of a lithiated intermediate.\n\n3.  **Electrophilic Quench:** The resulting aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile. In the second step, it reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH₃I). The nucleophilic carbon at the C2 position attacks the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\nThe final product is thus N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
