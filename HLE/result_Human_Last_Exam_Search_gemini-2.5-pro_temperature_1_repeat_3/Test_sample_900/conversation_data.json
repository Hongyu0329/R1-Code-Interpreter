  "response_list": [
    "It is not possible to provide a precise number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo for several reasons:\n\nFirst, the video of the specified 2015 performance by the Semperoper Ballett is not publicly available, preventing a direct analysis of the choreography.\n\nSecond, the term \"pas de Balanchine\" does not refer to a formally recognized step in the classical ballet lexicon. It is a colloquialism that has gained popularity on social media platforms, with several dancers demonstrating a similar, specific sequence of movements under this name. The School of American Ballet, founded by George Balanchine, has noted that this is not a term used in their training. Therefore, there is no official definition of what this step entails, making it impossible to identify and count definitively within a choreographed piece.\n\nFinally, while William Forsythe's work was heavily influenced by George Balanchine, there is no publicly available choreographic note or detailed analysis of the \"Jete Woman\" solo that enumerates the specific steps performed.\n\nDue to the unavailability of the specific performance video and the informal, undefined nature of the term \"pas de Balanchine,\" any numerical answer would be speculative.\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a definitive answer.>>>"
