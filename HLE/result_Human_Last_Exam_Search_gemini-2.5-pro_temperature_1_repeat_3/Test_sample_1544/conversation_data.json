    "In the given position, the optimal move for White is **Qxc5+**.\n\nThis move forces a queen trade, leading to a pawn endgame that is winning for White. After 1. Qxc5+ Kxc5, White's passed pawn on d6 becomes a decisive advantage. Black's king is tied down to stopping this pawn, which allows White's king to become active and attack Black's remaining pawns. With precise play, White can create a second passed pawn or win Black's pawns, ultimately leading to a victory.\n\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
