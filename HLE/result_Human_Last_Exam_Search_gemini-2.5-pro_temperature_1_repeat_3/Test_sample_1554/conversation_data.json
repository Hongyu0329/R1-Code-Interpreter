    "## Tadeusz Pawłowski: Deconstructing Concepts in the Lviv-Warsaw School\n\n**Tadeusz Pawłowski**, a prominent philosopher of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the thinker who decomposed the notion of a hallmark into a more nuanced framework of **symptoms and signals**. His work, particularly in the realm of semiotics and the methodology of the sciences, delved into the intricate ways concepts are formed and understood.\n\nPawłowski's analysis is most thoroughly explored in his book, *Concept Formation in the Humanities and the Social Sciences*. While he may not have used the exact term \"hallmark\" in a rigidly defined sense, his work on **indicators** provides the intellectual foundation for this decomposition. For Pawłowski, an indicator is an observable phenomenon that points to the existence of another, unobservable property or state of affairs. This is closely aligned with the concept of a symptom.\n\nHis writings, including *On Concepts and Methods in the Humanities and the Social Sciences*, further elaborate on different types of indicators, such as \"definitional indicators,\" \"factual indicators,\" and \"probabilistic indicators.\" These can be understood as various forms of symptoms that signify a particular concept.\n\nFurthermore, Pawłowski's semiotic theory incorporates the role of **signals**. In this context, signals are a crucial component of how meaning is constructed and transmitted, serving as the carriers of information that allow us to recognize and interpret phenomena.\n\nTherefore, while the direct phrase \"decomposing a hallmark into symptoms and signals\" might not be a verbatim quote, Tadeusz Pawłowski's philosophical framework provides a systematic analysis of how we identify and understand complex concepts through the interplay of observable indicators (symptoms) and the semiotic carriers of meaning (signals). This approach is a testament to the Lviv-Warsaw School's commitment to logical clarity and the precise analysis of language and concepts.\n\n<<<Tadeusz Pawłowski>>>"
