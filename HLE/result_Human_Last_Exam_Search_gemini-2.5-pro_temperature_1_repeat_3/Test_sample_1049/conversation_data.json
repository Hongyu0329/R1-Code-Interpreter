    "A closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$ can be found using the method of generating functions.\n\nLet $C_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$. The generating function for the central binomial coefficient $\\binom{2m}{m}$ is given by $B(x) = \\sum_{m=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2m}{m}x^m = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$. The sum $C_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the convolution of the sequence $\\left(\\binom{2k}{k}\\right)$ with itself. Therefore, the generating function for $C_n$ is $(B(x))^2 = \\frac{1}{1-4x} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 4^n x^n$. This leads to the well-known identity $C_n = 4^n$.\n\nThe given sum is a convolution of the sequences $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$. Let the generating function for the sequence $(a_k)$ be $A(x)$. The generating function for the given sum $S_n$ is then $G(x) = A(x)B(x)$.\n\nThe generating function $A(x)$ can be obtained by applying the operator $\\theta = x \\frac{d}{dx}$ to $B(x)$. Specifically, the generating function for $(2k+1)u_k$ is $(2\\theta+1)U(x)$, where $U(x)$ is the generating function for $u_k$. Let $A_m(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^m \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$. Then $A_m(x) = (2\\theta+1)A_{m-1}(x)$, with $A_0(x) = B(x)$.\n\nThe generating function for the sum $S_n(m) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (2k+1)^m \\binom{2k}{k} \\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$ is $G_m(x) = A_m(x)B(x)$.\nThis process, while systematic, leads to complex calculations. An alternative is to compute the first few terms of the sum and deduce the structure of the closed form. We expect the sum to be of the form $P(n) \\cdot 4^n$, where $P(n)$ is a polynomial in $n$ of degree 5.\n\nLet's calculate the first few values of $S_n$:\n*   $S_0 = (2(0)+1)^5 \\binom{0}{0}\\binom{0}{0} = 1$\n*   $S_1 = (1)^5 \\binom{0}{0}\\binom{2}{1} + (3)^5 \\binom{2}{1}\\binom{0}{0} = 2 + 2(243) = 488$\n*   $S_2 = (1)^5\\binom{0}{0}\\binom{4}{2} + (3)^5\\binom{2}{1}\\binom{2}{1} + (5)^5\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{0}{0} = 6 + 243(4) + 3125(6) = 6 + 972 + 18750 = 19728$\n\nThe sum can be expressed as $S_n = 4^n P(n)$, where $P(n)$ is a polynomial.\n*   $P(0) = S_0/4^0 = 1$\n*   $P(1) = S_1/4^1 = 488/4 = 122$\n*   $P(2) = S_2/4^2 = 19728/16 = 1233$\n\nBy computing further values for $n=3, 4, 5$ and using the theory of finite differences, we can determine the polynomial $P(n)$.\nThe polynomial can be written using Newton's series as:\n$P(n) = \\sum_{k=0}^5 \\binom{n}{k} \\Delta^k P(0)$\nAfter computing $S_3, S_4, S_5$ and the forward differences of $P(n)$ at $n=0$, we get:\n$\\Delta^0 P(0) = 1$\n$\\Delta^1 P(0) = 121$\n$\\Delta^2 P(0) = 990$\n$\\Delta^3 P(0) = 2550$\n$\\Delta^4 P(0) = 2625$\n$\\Delta^5 P(0) = 945$\n\nThis gives the closed form in the Newton basis:\n$S_n = 4^n \\left( \\binom{n}{0} + 121\\binom{n}{1} + 990\\binom{n}{2} + 2550\\binom{n}{3} + 2625\\binom{n}{4} + 945\\binom{n}{5} \\right)$.\n\nExpanding this expression into a polynomial in the standard basis gives:\n$P(n) = \\frac{1}{8}(63n^5 + 245n^4 + 355n^3 + 235n^2 + 70n + 8)$.\n\nTherefore, the final closed form is:\n$S_n = \\frac{4^n}{8}(63n^5 + 245n^4 + 355n^3 + 235n^2 + 70n + 8)$.\n\n"
