    "To solve this problem, we first need to establish the value of S. In the context of mathematical competitions, \"SNYWR\" typically stands for \"Special Number of the Year Which is Relevant,\" which is the current year, 2025. Therefore, S = 2025.\n\nThe problem describes a triangle ABC with the following properties:\n*   Side `BC = a = 2025`\n*   Angle `B = 30°`\n*   Side `AC = b` is an integer.\n\nWe are looking for the number of possible integer values for `AC` such that there are two possible values for the side length `AB`. This is known as the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines, which occurs when we are given two sides and a non-included angle (SSA).\n\nFor two distinct triangles to be possible, the following conditions must be met when given sides `a`, `b` and a non-included acute angle `B`:\n1.  Angle `B` must be acute, which it is (30°).\n2.  The side opposite the given angle (`b = AC`) must be shorter than the other given side (`a = BC`).\n3.  The side `b` must be longer than the altitude `h` from vertex C to the line containing side AB.\n\nThe altitude `h` can be calculated as:\n`h = a * sin(B)`\n\nCombining these conditions, we get the inequality:\n`h < b < a`\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values:\n*   `a = 2025`\n*   `B = 30°`\n\nFirst, calculate the altitude `h`:\n`h = 2025 * sin(30°)`\nSince `sin(30°) = 0.5`,\n`h = 2025 * 0.5 = 1012.5`\n\nNow, we set up the inequality for `b` (the length of side AC):\n`1012.5 < b < 2025`\n\nThe problem asks for the number of *integer* values of `AC` (which is `b`). Therefore, we need to find the number of integers between 1012.5 and 2025.\n*   The smallest integer value `b` can take is 1013.\n*   The largest integer value `b` can take is 2024.\n\nTo find the number of integers in this range, we use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of integer values = `2024 - 1013 + 1 = 1011 + 1 = 1012`.\n\nThus, there are 1012 integer values for the length of side AC for which two possible triangles can be formed.\n\n<<<1012>>>"
