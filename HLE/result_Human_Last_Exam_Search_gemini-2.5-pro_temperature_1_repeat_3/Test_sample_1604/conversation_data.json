    "The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **Charge at Huj**, which took place on **November 8, 1917**. This World War I engagement was immortalized by Butler in her painting titled \"The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj\".\n\nLady Butler, a renowned British painter of military scenes, created works that spanned a significant period of British military history. While many of her famous pieces depict 19th-century conflicts, such as the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War, she continued to paint into the 20th century, addressing contemporary conflicts.\n\nHer works depicting World War I are the latest in terms of the historical events they portray. Among these, the Charge at Huj in 1917 is the latest dated battle. Other paintings by her from this era include \"In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards\" (painted in 1927), which shows an event from August-September 1914, and \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" (painted in 1929), which depicts a more general scene from the war in Flanders. However, the Charge at Huj has a specific and later date.\n\nThe charge itself was a significant cavalry action during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I, carried out by the 5th Mounted Brigade against an Ottoman rearguard. Lady Butler's painting captures the drama of what is considered one of the last great British cavalry charges.\n\n<<<The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj>>>"
