### 1. Residues for Interaction with alpha-1 subunit:
The hotspots for interaction on the human beta-1 subunit are located within the **Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain**, which forms a hydrophobic **Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP)**. This pocket accommodates the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the Cav2.3 alpha-1 subunit. Structural studies indicate this pocket is formed by conserved hydrophobic residues. One study specifically notes the importance of a **quartet of leucine residues** in the GK domain for this interaction and for controlling the number of channels at the cell surface. While the exact positions for human beta-1 are not explicitly listed in a single publication, the interaction site is well-defined in structural models (e.g., PDB: 7VFW) as the hydrophobic groove of the GK domain.

### 2. Residues for Gating Modulation:
The primary hotspots for fine-tuning the gating properties of the Cav2.3 alpha-1 subunit are the **same residues within the GK domain's Alpha-Binding Pocket** that are responsible for the physical interaction. The binding of the AID to this pocket is the direct mechanism that modulates channel gating, including voltage-dependence of activation and inactivation. The GK domain alone is sufficient to confer significant gating modulation.

Furthermore, the overall modulatory effect is dependent on the structural integrity and correct orientation of the entire beta-1 subunit core, specifically the interaction between the **Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain and the GK domain**. This indicates that while the ABP residues are the direct hotspots, other residues that maintain the SH3-GK conformation are allosterically critical for proper gating modulation.
