**1. Amlodipine**
*   **Drug Class:** Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB)
*   **Rationale:** CCBs are a first-line treatment for hypertension in African American patients. They are effective at lowering blood pressure by relaxing blood vessels. A long-acting CCB like amlodipine is a foundational component of a multi-drug regimen for resistant hypertension. Given that the patient cannot take verapamil (a non-dihydropyridine CCB), a dihydropyridine like amlodipine is an excellent choice.

**2. Losartan**
*   **Drug Class:** Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB)
*   **Rationale:** For patients with hypertension and diabetes (MM's A1C is 6.7%), an ARB or ACE inhibitor is recommended to protect kidney function and lower cardiovascular risk. ARBs are often preferred over ACE inhibitors in African American patients due to a lower risk of side effects like cough. Combining an ARB with a CCB like amlodipine is a highly effective and well-tolerated strategy for achieving significant blood pressure reduction.

**3. Spironolactone**
*   **Drug Class:** Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist (MRA) / Potassium-Sparing Diuretic
*   **Rationale:** MM's condition is defined as resistant hypertension because her blood pressure is not at goal despite being on three medications. After a regimen of a RAAS blocker (like an ARB), a CCB, and a standard diuretic fails, the addition of an MRA like spironolactone is the recommended next step and is proven to be highly effective. It is considered the most appropriate fourth-line agent, but since the patient has contraindications to all listed thiazide and loop diuretics, spironolactone becomes a critical third-line option. It works by targeting aldosterone, which can be a key factor in difficult-to-treat hypertension. While eplerenone is contraindicated for this patient, spironolactone is not and can provide substantial blood pressure lowering. Close monitoring of her potassium levels will be necessary as it is being used with an ARB.
