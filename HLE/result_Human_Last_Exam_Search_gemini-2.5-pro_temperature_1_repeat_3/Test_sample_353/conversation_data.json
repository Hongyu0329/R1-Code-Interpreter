    "The exact value for the A($\\alpha$) stability angle of the BDF4 method has been a subject of study, with precise expressions being derived in recent years. The BDF4 method is known to be A($\\vartheta_4$)-stable, with $\\vartheta_4$ being the maximum angle.\n\nThe stability of the BDF4 method is determined by the roots of its characteristic polynomial. The method is considered A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the angular sector $S_{\\alpha} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$. The angle for BDF4 is approximately 73.35Â°.\n\nThe exact value for the tangent of the stability angle $\\alpha$ for BDFk methods can be found by analyzing the boundary of the stability region. For the BDF4 method, the exact value of tan($\\alpha$) is derived from the positive root of the polynomial $100t^4 - 440t^2 + 129$. The positive root for $t^2$ is $\\frac{440 + \\sqrt{440^2 - 4 \\cdot 100 \\cdot 129}}{200} = \\frac{440 + \\sqrt{193600 - 51600}}{200} = \\frac{440 + \\sqrt{142000}}{200} = \\frac{440 + 20\\sqrt{355}}{200} = \\frac{22 + \\sqrt{355}}{10}$.\n\nThus, the exact value for the angle $\\alpha$ is given by:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{22 + \\sqrt{355}}{10}}\\right)$\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{22 + \\sqrt{355}}{10}}\\right)$>>>"
