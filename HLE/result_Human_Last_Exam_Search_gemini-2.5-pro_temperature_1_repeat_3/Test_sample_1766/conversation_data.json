    "In the problem of spin-orbit coupling for a p-electron, the total angular momentum **J** is the sum of the orbital angular momentum **L** and the spin angular momentum **S**. To find the common eigenvalues of the operators **J²** and **Jz**, we first need to determine the possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*.\n\n### Determining the Quantum Numbers\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is *l* = 1. As an electron is a spin-1/2 particle, its spin quantum number is *s* = 1/2.\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are obtained by the vector addition of the orbital and spin angular momenta, ranging from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps.\n\nTherefore, for a p-electron:\n*   *j* = |1 - 1/2|, ..., 1 + 1/2\n*   *j* = 1/2, 3/2\n\nThis indicates that the energy level of a p-electron splits into two levels due to spin-orbit coupling, characterized by *j* = 1/2 and *j* = 3/2.\n\n### Eigenvalues of J² and Jz\n\nThe eigenvalues of the **J²** and **Jz** operators are determined by the quantum numbers *j* and *mⱼ*, where *mⱼ* is the total magnetic quantum number that can take values from -*j* to +*j* in integer steps.\n\nThe general forms of the eigenvalues are:\n*   Eigenvalue of **J²**: ħ² *j*(*j* + 1)\n*   Eigenvalue of **Jz**: ħ *mⱼ*\n\nWe can now find the specific common eigenvalues for each possible value of *j*.\n\n#### Case 1: *j* = 3/2\n\n*   The eigenvalue of **J²** is ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = **(15/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible values for *mⱼ* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2.\n*   The corresponding eigenvalues for **Jz** are **(-3/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, and (3/2)ħ**.\n\nThe common eigenvalues for the state with *j* = 3/2 are:\n*   $J^2 = (15/4)ħ^2, J_z = (3/2)ħ$\n*   $J^2 = (15/4)ħ^2, J_z = (1/2)ħ$\n*   $J^2 = (15/4)ħ^2, J_z = (-1/2)ħ$\n*   $J^2 = (15/4)ħ^2, J_z = (-3/2)ħ$\n\n#### Case 2: *j* = 1/2\n\n*   The eigenvalue of **J²** is ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = **(3/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible values for *mⱼ* are -1/2 and 1/2.\n*   The corresponding eigenvalues for **Jz** are **(-1/2)ħ and (1/2)ħ**.\n\nThe common eigenvalues for the state with *j* = 1/2 are:\n*   $J^2 = (3/4)ħ^2, J_z = (1/2)ħ$\n*   $J^2 = (3/4)ħ^2, J_z = (-1/2)ħ$\n\nIn summary, the spin-orbit coupling splits the p-electron state into a quartet of states with *j* = 3/2 and a doublet of states with *j* = 1/2, each with distinct and quantized values for the total angular momentum and its projection along the z-axis.\n\n<<<The common eigenvalues for $J^2$ are (15/4)ħ² and (3/4)ħ². For $J^2 = (15/4)ħ^2$, the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, and (-3/2)ħ. For $J^2 = (3/4)ħ^2$, the eigenvalues of $J_z$ are (1/2)ħ and (-1/2)ħ.>>>"
