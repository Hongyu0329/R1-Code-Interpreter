    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when using the CFOP method on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, a solver must see a minimum of five non-top-facing stickers.\n\nThe PLL stage of the CFOP method is the final step, where the pieces of the last layer are permuted into their correct positions after being oriented. There are 21 distinct PLL cases that a solver needs to recognize.\n\nIt is a well-established practice among speedcubers to use \"two-sided PLL recognition,\" which means that all 21 cases can be uniquely identified by observing the six non-top-facing stickers on two adjacent faces of the cube's last layer. These six stickers consist of the two side-facing stickers of the two corner pieces and the one side-facing sticker of the edge piece on each of the two adjacent faces.\n\nHowever, to determine the absolute minimum number of stickers required, it's necessary to consider redundant information. When viewing two adjacent faces, you see two stickers of one of the corner pieces. Since the top-facing color of the last layer is already solved (all the same color), knowing two of a corner's three colors is enough to identify that corner piece and its orientation. This makes one of the six stickers redundant. Therefore, the theoretical minimum number of stickers required is five.\n\nWhile it's possible to distinguish some PLL cases with fewer than five stickers, there are sets of cases that would appear identical if only four stickers were observed. For example, distinguishing between certain G perms or between a U perm and an F perm often requires observing the state of multiple pieces across the two faces. The comprehensive two-sided recognition guides rely on patterns formed by these five or six stickers, such as \"headlights\" (two corner stickers of the same color on one face), \"blocks\" (a 1x2 or 2x2 group of same-colored stickers), or \"bookends\" (the two outer corner stickers on the two faces being the same color). The necessity of observing these patterns across the full two faces demonstrates that a view of at least five stickers is essential for complete and accurate identification of any of the 21 PLL cases without rotating the cube to see a third face.\n\n<<<5>>>"
