To be functionally accurate, the picnic table, shaped like an azobenzene molecule, must change from a straighter form to a bent form when the sun rises and return to the straighter form when the sun sets. This mimics the molecule's photoisomerization, where UV light from the sun converts the stable *trans* isomer to the bent *cis* isomer, and the absence of light allows it to relax back to the *trans* state.
