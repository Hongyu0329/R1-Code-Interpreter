    "For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the calculation:\n\n*   **Toluene Composition**: The molecule consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   **6-31G Basis Set Definition**: This is a split-valence basis set.\n    *   For non-hydrogen atoms (like Carbon), the core orbitals are described by a single contracted function composed of 6 primitive Gaussians. The valence orbitals are split into two functions: an inner part contracted from 3 primitives and an outer part represented by a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   For Hydrogen atoms, the valence orbital is also split into two functions, one contracted from 3 primitives and the other being a single primitive.\n\n**Calculation per Atom:**\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n    *   **Core (1s orbital):** 1 contracted basis function.\n    *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** This shell is split.\n        *   Inner part (2s, 2pₓ, 2pᵧ, 2p₂): 4 contracted basis functions (one for each orbital).\n        *   Outer part (2s, 2pₓ, 2pᵧ, 2p₂): 4 basis functions.\n    *   **Total per Carbon:** 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 contracted basis functions.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   **Valence (1s orbital):** This orbital is split.\n        *   Inner part: 1 contracted basis function.\n        *   Outer part: 1 basis function.\n    *   **Total per Hydrogen:** 1 + 1 = 2 contracted basis functions.\n\n**Total Calculation for Toluene (C₇H₈):**\n\n*   **From Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **From Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total Contracted Functions:** 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\n<<<79>>>"
