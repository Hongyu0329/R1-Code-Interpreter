    "Based on Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, we can predict the ratio of the two products by analyzing the allowed and competing reaction pathways for the thermal electrocyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reaction and Applicable Rules\nThe reaction is a thermal electrocyclization of a conjugated tetraene. The reacting π-system involves 8 electrons (an octatetraene system). According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal pericyclic reactions, systems with 4n π-electrons (where n=2 in this case) proceed through a **conrotatory** ring closure. This is the symmetry-allowed pathway.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Allowed Pathway\nTo predict the stereochemistry of the product, we must examine the conformation of the starting material, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, as it closes.\n\n1.  **Reactive Conformation:** For cyclization to occur, the polyene chain adopts a 'C'-like shape, which requires s-cis conformations about the single bonds.\n2.  **Substituent Positions:** We need to determine the relative orientation of the methyl groups at the termini (C2 and C9). In the reactive conformation, the substituents can be described as pointing \"inward\" toward the forming ring or \"outward\" away from it.\n    *   The double bond at C2 is **Z**. This configuration causes the methyl group at C2 to point **outward**.\n    *   The double bond at C9 is **E**. When the all s-cis \"C\" shape is formed, this E-geometry also results in the C9-methyl group pointing **outward**.\n    *   Therefore, the reactive conformation has both terminal methyl groups pointing **outward**.\n\n3.  **Conrotatory Closure:** During a conrotatory closure, both termini rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise). When both substituents are pointing \"outward\", this mode of rotation brings both groups to the same face of the newly formed ring.\n\n    *   This leads to the formation of **cis-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene**, which is isomer A.\n\nThus, the FMO-allowed pathway predicts the formation of the *cis*-isomer A.\n\n### Step 3: Account for the Formation of the trans-Isomer B\nThe problem states that the *trans*-isomer B is also formed. Since the allowed conrotatory pathway exclusively yields the cis-isomer, the trans-isomer must be formed through a different, competing pathway.\n\nThis competing pathway is the symmetry-forbidden **disrotatory** closure. While this pathway is \"forbidden\" for a standard (Hückel-type) planar transition state, it becomes allowed if the π-system can twist into a Möbius topology. For an 8-membered ring, the strain required to achieve this twisted transition state is significant but not insurmountable, allowing this pathway to compete, albeit less effectively.\n\n*   **Disrotatory Closure:** In a disrotatory motion, the termini rotate in opposite directions. For a starting conformation where both methyl groups are \"outward,\" a disrotatory closure places them on opposite faces of the new ring.\n*   This leads to the formation of **trans-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene**, which is isomer B.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the Ratio of A to B\nFMO theory predicts that the symmetry-allowed pathway has a lower activation energy than the symmetry-forbidden pathway.\n\n*   **Pathway A (allowed):** (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene → [Conrotatory TS] → *cis*-isomer (A)\n*   **Pathway B (forbidden):** (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene → [Disrotatory Möbius TS] → *trans*-isomer (B)\n\nBecause the conrotatory pathway to product A has a lower activation energy, it will be faster than the disrotatory pathway to product B. Consequently, the *cis*-isomer A will be the major product, and the *trans*-isomer B will be the minor product.\n\nThe ratio of A to B will be greater than 1.\n\n<<<The ratio of A to B is predicted to be greater than 1.>>>"
