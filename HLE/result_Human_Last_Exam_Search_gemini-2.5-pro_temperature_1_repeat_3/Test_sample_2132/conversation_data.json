    "The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, when treated with a base such as sodium ethoxide, is **ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate**. This reaction characteristically involves the contraction of the initial six-membered ring into a five-membered ring.\n\nThe **Böttcher Molecular Complexity** is a sophisticated metric used to quantify the structural complexity of a molecule. It is calculated by summing the information content of each atom's microenvironment, taking into account factors like the number and type of bonds, element diversity, and stereochemistry. This method is distinct from other complexity indices, such as the \"PubChem Complexity.\" For example, the PubChem database reports a complexity value of 114 for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, but this is calculated using a different system and is not the Böttcher score.\n\nDetermining the precise Böttcher Molecular Complexity requires specialized software, such as the online Böttcher Score calculator, or a manual calculation following the defined formula. Without access to these tools, it is not possible to provide the specific numerical value for the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate.\n\n<<<Unable to provide a numerical answer.>>>"
