    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G_0, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to understanding the behavior of the system before the introduction of interactions.\n\nThe bare Green's function for a non-interacting system is derived from the path integral over a non-interacting action, S_0. This action is typically quadratic in the fields, which allows for exact calculation of the resulting Gaussian integrals. The two-point correlation function, which defines the Green's function, can be computed directly from this path integral.\n\nIn the frequency-momentum (or energy-wavevector) domain, the time-ordered bare Green's function, G_0(k, ω), has a distinct and explicit dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. This relationship is typically expressed as:\n\n**G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ω - μ))**\n\nwhere:\n*   **ω** is the frequency.\n*   **k** is the wavevector.\n*   **ϵ_k** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a particle with wavevector k.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential, which sets the Fermi level.\n*   **η** is an infinitesimal positive number that ensures the correct causal behavior of the Green's function. It displaces the poles of the Green's function slightly off the real axis.\n*   **sgn** is the signum function.\n\nAlternatively, the expression is often presented in a form that distinguishes between particle and hole propagation:\n\n**G_0(k, ω) = [ (1 - n_k) / (ω - ϵ_k + iη) ] + [ n_k / (ω - ϵ_k - iη) ]**\n\nHere, **n_k** is the occupation number of the state with wavevector k. For a system at zero temperature, n_k is 1 for states below the Fermi level (ϵ_k < μ) and 0 for states above it (ϵ_k > μ).\n\n*   The first term, with the **+iη**, corresponds to the propagation of a particle (an electron added to an empty state above the Fermi level). The pole is in the lower half of the complex ω-plane.\n*   The second term, with the **-iη**, describes the propagation of a hole (an electron removed from an occupied state below the Fermi level). This pole is located in the upper half of the complex ω-plane.\n\nIn summary, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k is characterized by the presence of ϵ_k as a simple pole in the denominator of the Green's function in the frequency-momentum representation. This pole structure is a direct consequence of the non-interacting nature of the system as described by the path integral formalism. The poles of the bare Green's function precisely define the energy-momentum dispersion of the free particles in the system.\n\n<<<In the frequency-momentum representation, the bare Green's function G_0(k, ω) is inversely proportional to (ω - ϵ_k), with a small imaginary part added to the denominator to ensure proper causality. Specifically, the time-ordered Green's function is given by G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ω - μ)), where ϵ_k are the single-particle energy eigenvalues.>>>"
