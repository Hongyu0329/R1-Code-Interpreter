In the frequency-momentum representation, the bare Green's function G_0(k, ω) is inversely proportional to (ω - ϵ_k), with a small imaginary part added to the denominator to ensure proper causality. Specifically, the time-ordered Green's function is given by G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ω - μ)), where ϵ_k are the single-particle energy eigenvalues.
