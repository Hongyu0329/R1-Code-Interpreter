The displacement field, D, through the transistor can be described by the average of the displacement fields generated by the top and bottom gates. The displacement field from the top gate ($D_{tg}$) is $C_{tg}V_{tg}$, and from the bottom gate ($D_{bg}$) is $C_{bg}V_{bg}$.

The average displacement field is therefore:
$D = \frac{D_{tg} + D_{bg}}{2} = \frac{C_{tg}V_{tg} + C_{bg}V_{bg}}{2}$

This average displacement field is the primary parameter that controls the total charge density in the transistor channel.
