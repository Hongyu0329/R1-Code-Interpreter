    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Athos.\n\nHomer's epic poem references several real-world mountains that were significant in the ancient Greek world. While Mount Olympus stands as the highest peak in Greece and the mythical home of the gods, other mountains also feature in the narrative.\n\nMount Athos, located on the Athos peninsula in northeastern Greece, is explicitly mentioned in the *Iliad*. It has an elevation of 2,033 meters (6,670 feet).\n\nAnother notable mountain in the *Iliad* is Mount Ida, a range in northwestern Turkey, near the ancient city of Troy. The gods are said to have witnessed the Trojan War from its peaks. Its highest point is 1,770 meters (5,820 feet).\n\nMount Pelion in Thessaly, Greece, is also mentioned, particularly as the source of the wood for Achilles' spear. Its highest summit is 1,624 meters (5,328 feet).\n\nComparing their elevations, Mount Athos is the tallest among these historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*, second only to Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
