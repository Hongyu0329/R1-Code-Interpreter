    "There are many ways to form boolean expressions with exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}. To find the number of expressions that evaluate to true, we can categorize them by their structure. The precedence of operators is ! > & > |.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the distinct structures of 5 symbols and the number of true expressions for each:\n\n### 1. Three Literals, Two Operators\nThis category includes expressions with three operands (T or F) and two binary operators (& or |) without any parentheses. The structure is `A op1 B op2 C`.\n\n*   **`A & B & C`**: This expression is true only if A, B, and C are all T. There is only **1** such expression: `T&T&T`.\n*   **`A | B | C`**: This expression is false only if A, B, and C are all F. Out of the 8 possible combinations of literals, **7** result in a true expression.\n*   **`A & B | C`**: Due to operator precedence, this is parsed as `(A & B) | C`. This is true if C is T (4 combinations), or if C is F and (A & B) is T (1 combination: `T&T|F`). This gives **5** true expressions.\n*   **`A | B & C`**: This is parsed as `A | (B & C)`. This is true if A is T (4 combinations), or if A is F and (B & C) is T (1 combination: `F|T&T`). This gives **5** true expressions.\n\nTotal for this category: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18**.\n\n### 2. Negations and Two Literals\nThis category involves the `!` operator combined with two literals and one binary operator.\n\n*   **`!A op !B`**: This structure is parsed as `(!A) op (!B)` and has a length of 5 (e.g., `!T|!F`).\n    *   `!F & !F` is true (**1** expression).\n    *   `!T | !F`, `!F | !T`, and `!F | !F` are true (**3** expressions).\n    *   This gives a subtotal of **4** true expressions.\n*   **`(!A) op B`**: This structure requires parentheses to make the length 5.\n    *   `(!F) & T` is true (**1** expression).\n    *   `(!T) | T`, `(!F) | T`, and `(!F) | F` are true (**3** expressions).\n    *   This gives a subtotal of **4** true expressions.\n*   **`A op (!B)`**: This is symmetric to the previous structure.\n    *   `T & (!F)` is true (**1** expression).\n    *   `T | (!T)`, `T | (!F)`, and `F | (!F)` are true (**3** expressions).\n    *   This gives a subtotal of **4** true expressions.\n\nTotal for this category: 4 + 4 + 4 = **12**.\n\n### 3. Expressions with Parentheses Around Sub-expressions\nThis category includes expressions where parentheses are used to group sub-expressions.\n\n*   **`(A op B)`**: Here, A and B are single literals (T/F). This structure has a length of 5.\n    *   `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)` are all true.\n    *   This gives **4** true expressions.\n*   **`A op (B)`**: Here A and B are single literals. The parentheses make the length 5 (e.g., `T|(F)`).\n    *   `T & (T)` is true (**1** expression).\n    *   `T | (T)`, `T | (F)`, and `F | (T)` are true (**3** expressions).\n    *   This gives a subtotal of **4** true expressions.\n*   **`(A) op B`**: This is symmetric to the previous structure, giving another **4** true expressions.\n\nTotal for this category: 4 + 4 + 4 = **12**.\n\n### 4. Expressions with Nested Negations and Parentheses\nThis category involves more complex nesting of `!` and `()`.\n\n*   **`!!(A)`**: Where A is a single literal. `!!(T)` is true, giving **1** expression.\n*   **`!((!A))`**: Where A is a single literal. `!((!T))` evaluates to `!(F)`, which is true. This gives **1** expression.\n*   **`!(A&B)`**: This requires `A&B` to be false. The combinations `T&F`, `F&T`, and `F&F` are false, giving **3** true expressions.\n*   **`!(A|B)`**: This requires `A|B` to be false. Only `F|F` is false, giving **1** true expression.\n\nTotal for this category: 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = **6**.\n\n### Final Calculation\nSumming up the counts from all the distinct categories:\n*   Three Literals, Two Operators: 18\n*   Negations and Two Literals: 12\n*   Expressions with Parentheses: 12\n*   Nested Negations and Parentheses: 6\n\nTotal True Expressions = 18 + 12 + 12 + 6 = 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
