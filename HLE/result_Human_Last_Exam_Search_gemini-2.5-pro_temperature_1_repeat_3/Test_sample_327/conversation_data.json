    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number 13/16 in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we can use a standard algorithm that translates a number's binary representation into a stack of red and blue pieces.\n\nFirst, we express the number 13/16 in binary.\n13/16 = 0.8125\n$0.8125 \\times 2 = 1.625 \\rightarrow 1$\n$0.6250 \\times 2 = 1.250 \\rightarrow 1$\n$0.2500 \\times 2 = 0.500 \\rightarrow 0$\n$0.5000 \\times 2 = 1.000 \\rightarrow 1$\nSo, the binary representation of 13/16 is $0.1101_2$.\n\nThis can be written as a sum of powers of 2:\n$13/16 = 1 \\cdot 2^{-1} + 1 \\cdot 2^{-2} + 0 \\cdot 2^{-3} + 1 \\cdot 2^{-4}$\n\nThe construction of the Hackenbush stalk is based on the sequence of binary coefficients ($c_i$). The piece at each position (corresponding to a power of 2) is determined by comparing the coefficient at that position ($c_i$) with the coefficient of the next lower power ($c_{i-1}$).\n\nLet's list the coefficients, including those that are zero, from the lowest power upwards:\n*   $c_{-5} = 0$ (a starting reference point)\n*   $c_{-4} = 1$\n*   $c_{-3} = 0$\n*   $c_{-2} = 1$\n*   $c_{-1} = 1$\n*   $c_{0} = 0$\n*   $c_{1} = 0$\n\nThe rule for determining the pieces is as follows: a piece exists at a position `i` if the coefficient $c_i$ is different from $c_{i-1}$. If they are the same, no piece is placed at that position. Specifically, the game for a number `x` is constructed by swapping the colors of the game representing `-x`. The direct construction for `x` is:\n*   If $c_i - c_{i-1} = 1$, a **Red** piece is placed at position `i`.\n*   If $c_i - c_{i-1} = -1$, a **Blue** piece is placed at position `i`.\n*   If $c_i - c_{i-1} = 0$, there is no piece at position `i`.\n\nApplying this to our coefficients:\n*   **Position -4 ($2^{-4}$):** $c_{-4} - c_{-5} = 1 - 0 = 1$. This means a **Red** piece.\n*   **Position -3 ($2^{-3}$):** $c_{-3} - c_{-4} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This means a **Blue** piece.\n*   **Position -2 ($2^{-2}$):** $c_{-2} - c_{-3} = 1 - 0 = 1$. This means a **Red** piece.\n*   **Position -1 ($2^{-1}$):** $c_{-1} - c_{-2} = 1 - 1 = 0$. This means **no piece**.\n*   **Position 0 ($2^{0}$):** $c_{0} - c_{-1} = 0 - 1 = -1$. This means a **Blue** piece.\n*   **Position 1 ($2^{1}$):** $c_{1} - c_{0} = 0 - 0 = 0$. This means **no piece**, and all subsequent pieces will also be absent.\n\nSo, the Hackenbush representation for 13/16 consists of pieces at positions -4, -3, -2, and 0. This gives a total of 4 pieces. The composition is two red pieces and two blue pieces.\n\n<<<4>>>"
