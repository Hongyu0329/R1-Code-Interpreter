    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, have been recorded feeding on both nectar and aphids. Adult snakeflies are primarily predators, and their diet consists of soft-bodied arthropods like aphids.\n\nIn addition to being predatory, some species of snakeflies have been observed to feed on pollen and nectar. Pollen has been discovered in the digestive systems of adult snakeflies, although it is not definitively known if this is a required part of their diet.\n\nThere is no scientific evidence to suggest that adult Raphidiopterans feed on fungus or the leaf tissue of plants like Karamū.\n\nTherefore, of the choices provided, snakeflies have been recorded feeding on nectar and aphids.\n\n<<<F>>>"
