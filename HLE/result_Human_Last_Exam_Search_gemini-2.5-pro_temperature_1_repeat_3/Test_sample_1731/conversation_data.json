    "The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas) can be determined using the principles of large deviation theory, as formalized by the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a framework for understanding why a system at equilibrium is found in its most probable macroscopic state.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**: This theorem applies to the empirical distribution of particles across different energy states. It states that the probability of observing a macroscopic state (a specific distribution of photons in energy levels) that deviates from the true equilibrium distribution is exponentially small. The rate of this exponential decay is given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the observed distribution and the equilibrium one. In the context of statistical mechanics, maximizing the Boltzmann entropy (`S = k log W`, where W is the number of microstates for a given macrostate) is equivalent to finding the most probable macrostate. For a gas of bosons (photons), this maximization under the constraint of a fixed total energy leads to the Bose-Einstein distribution for the average occupation number `<n_ε>` of a state with energy ε.\n\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem**: This theorem addresses the probability of large deviations in the sum of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. When applied to the total energy of the photon gas (the sum of the energies of individual photons), it shows that the probability of the mean energy deviating significantly from its equilibrium value is exponentially unlikely. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Cramer-Chernoff large deviation rate function, which is related to the thermodynamic free energy, attains its minimum value, corresponding to the most probable mean energy.\n\nFor a photon gas, which is a collection of non-interacting bosons, both approaches converge on the same equilibrium description, which is governed by Bose-Einstein statistics with a chemical potential of zero.\n\nThe resulting equilibrium values are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\nThe mean energy of a photon gas in a volume V at a temperature T is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
