The assertion that the second postulate of special relativity is superfluous and can be deduced from the first is a nuanced issue with no simple "yes" or "no" answer.

The prevailing view in physics is that the **first postulate alone is insufficient to derive the second**. The first postulate, which states that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference, when combined with assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy of spacetime, allows for different possible sets of transformation equations between inertial frames. One of these is Galilean relativity, where time is absolute and velocities add up classically, and the other is Lorentz relativity, which features a universal, finite speed limit. Without an additional postulate, there is no logical reason to prefer one over the other.

However, the second postulate can be seen as a consequence of the first if one makes an additional, powerful assumption: **that Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism are fundamental laws of physics**. Since Maxwell's equations predict a constant speed of light, *c*, in a vacuum, the first postulate would then imply that this speed must be the same for all inertial observers. From this perspective, the second postulate is a logical consequence of applying the principle of relativity to electromagnetism. Einstein himself was greatly motivated by the apparent conflict between classical mechanics and Maxwell's theory.

It is also argued that many attempts to derive the second postulate from the first often rely on "hidden assumptions" that are equivalent to the second postulate itself. For example, assuming that there is a maximum possible speed for any particle that is the same in all inertial frames is essentially a restatement of the core physical content of the second postulate.

In conclusion, while the second postulate is not derivable from the first in a purely logical sense without additional assumptions, its postulation is strongly motivated by applying the principle of relativity to the laws of electromagnetism. Therefore, it is generally considered an independent postulate necessary to single out the specific form of relativity that describes our universe.
