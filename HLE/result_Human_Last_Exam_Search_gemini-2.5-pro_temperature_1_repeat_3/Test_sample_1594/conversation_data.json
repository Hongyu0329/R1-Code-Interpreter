    "When viewed from above, the buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa form the letter \"H\".\n\nThe two high schools are located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce. The main structures of the two institutes are parallel to each other and are joined in the center by a connecting building. This architectural layout gives the complex its distinct \"H\" shape when observed from an aerial perspective. The schools also share an internal courtyard.\n\n<<<H>>>"
