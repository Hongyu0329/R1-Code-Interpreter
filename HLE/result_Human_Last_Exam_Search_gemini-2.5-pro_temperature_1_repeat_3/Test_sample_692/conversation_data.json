    "### Earliest Known Date Recorded by Pre-Columbian Civilization Identified in Mesoamerica\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is a subject of scholarly discussion, with two primary candidates emerging from the Olmec and Zapotec civilizations. These early inscriptions are calendrical notations from the 260-day ritual calendar, a system used throughout Mesoamerica.\n\nThe leading contender for the earliest recorded date is found on a ceramic cylinder seal discovered at San Andrés, near the Olmec center of La Venta in Tabasco, Mexico. Dated to approximately 650 BCE, the seal contains glyphs that have been interpreted as \"3 Ajaw,\" a day in the 260-day calendar. This interpretation, put forth by archaeologists such as Mary E.D. Pohl, suggests the Olmecs were the first to develop a system of writing that included calendrical dates and was associated with rulership. However, some scholars express caution, suggesting the symbols may be iconographic rather than a definitive written date.\n\nA close competitor for the earliest recorded date comes from the Zapotec civilization at the site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico. Monument 3, a carved stone slab, depicts a sacrificed captive with two glyphs between his feet. These glyphs are interpreted as the calendrical name \"1 Earthquake\" or \"1 Motion\". Initially dated to between 600 and 500 BCE, this monument was long considered the earliest evidence of writing in Mesoamerica. While some debate on its precise dating exists, it remains a pivotal artifact in understanding the origins of writing and calendrics in the region.\n\nOther significant early dates have been discovered, but they are from later periods. For instance, the earliest known Maya calendar notation, \"7 Deer,\" discovered at San Bartolo, Guatemala, dates to between 300 and 200 BCE. Later still is a Long Count date found on an Epi-Olmec stela from Chiapa de Corzo, which corresponds to 36 BCE.\n\nWhile architectural alignments suggest the 260-day calendar may have been in use as early as 1100 BCE, the San Andrés cylinder seal and the San José Mogote monument remain the earliest known physical records of a specific date inscribed within a writing system. The ongoing scholarly discussion surrounding the interpretation of these artifacts underscores the complexity of tracing the precise origins of writing in the Americas.\n\n<<<The earliest known recorded date is on a ceramic cylinder seal from the Olmec site of San Andrés, dated to approximately 650 BCE, which is interpreted as bearing the day \"3 Ajaw\" from the 260-day calendar.>>>"
