  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.\n\nThe teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+4.\n\nYou've got the sum that was written on the board.

    "The search results confirm the proposed \"counting sort\" approach is very efficient for this problem, as the range of numbers is extremely small. The most memory-efficient variation involves reading the input character by character instead of storing the whole string.\n\nThe memory calculation depends on the size of C data types.\n*   `sizeof(char)` is guaranteed to be 1 byte.\n*   `sizeof(int)` is compiler and platform-dependent, but on virtually all modern competitive programming platforms (like 32-bit and 64-bit Linux or Windows systems), it is 4 bytes.\n\nMy analysis of the memory usage of the variables declared on the stack for the function seems correct. These local variables exist only for the duration of the function call.\n\nBased on this, the first C code I outlined is the most memory-efficient. Let's re-verify the calculation for that version.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int count1 = 0;\n    int count2 = 0;\n    int count3 = 0;\n    int count4 = 0;\n    char c;\n    int first = 1;\n\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c == '1') count1++;\n        else if (c == '2') count2++;\n        else if (c == '3') count3++;\n        else if (c == '4') count4++;\n    }\n\n    // A loop counter 'i' will be needed for printing.\n    // Let's assume a single 'i' is declared at the top for reuse.\n    // However, declaring it inside the for-loop scope is more modern and doesn't change the stack allocation much.\n    // For simplicity of counting, let's consider one counter.\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < count1; i++) { /* ... */ }\n    for (int i = 0; i < count2; i++) { /* ... */ }\n    // ...and so on.\n    // Even if 'i' is re-declared, the stack space can be reused. We only need to account for one instance of it.\n}\n```\n\n**Variable Memory Calculation:**\n*   `count1`: `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n*   `count2`: `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n*   `count3`: `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n*   `count4`: `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n*   `c`: `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte\n*   `first`: `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n*   `i` (loop counter): `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n\nTotal `m` = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 25 bytes.\n\nThis seems to be the most accurate and minimal calculation based on the problem and standard C practices.\n\nFinal check on the refined version using an array:\n* `counts[4]`: 4 * `sizeof(int)` = 16 bytes\n* `c`: `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte\n* `first`: `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n* `num_val`: `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n* `i`: `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\nTotal `m` = 16 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 29 bytes.\n\nSo, the version without arrays is indeed slightly more memory-efficient. I will use that one for the final answer.\n\nThe plan is complete. I will now write the final response.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdbool.h> // For using bool type\n\n// A more compact printing logic\nvoid print_numbers(int count, int number, bool* is_first) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {\n        if (!(*is_first)) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar(number + '0');\n        *is_first = false;\n    }\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int count1 = 0;\n    int count2 = 0;\n    int count3 = 0;\n    int count4 = 0;\n    char c;\n\n    // Read the input character by character and count the numbers\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        switch (c) {\n            case '1':\n                count1++;\n                break;\n            case '2':\n                count2++;\n                break;\n            case '3':\n                count3++;\n                break;\n            case '4':\n                count4++;\n                break;\n        }\n    }\n\n    bool is_first = true; // To handle printing '+' correctly\n\n    // Print the numbers in non-decreasing order\n    print_numbers(count1, 1, &is_first);\n    print_numbers(count2, 2, &is_first);\n    print_numbers(count3, 3, &is_first);\n    print_numbers(count4, 4, &is_first);\n\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nLet's analyze the memory of this new version with the helper function.\nVariables in `main`:\n*   `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `count4`: 4 * `sizeof(int)` = 16 bytes\n*   `c`: `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte\n*   `is_first`: `sizeof(bool)` = 1 byte (typically)\nTotal in `main`: 16 + 1 + 1 = 18 bytes.\n\nVariables in `print_numbers` (called multiple times, but memory is reused on the stack):\n*   `count` (parameter): `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n*   `number` (parameter): `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n*   `is_first` (parameter, a pointer): `sizeof(bool*)` = 8 bytes on 64-bit, 4 on 32-bit. Let's assume 8 for the worst case.\n*   `i` (loop variable): `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\nTotal in function call stack frame: 4 + 4 + 8 + 4 = 20 bytes.\n\nThe total memory in use at any one time would be the sum of `main`'s stack and the deepest call stack. Here it's just `main` + `print_numbers`. `18 + 20 = 38` bytes. This is more than the initial simple version.\n\nTherefore, the first implementation remains the most memory-efficient. Let's write that one out clearly.\n\n<<<\n### C Program\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem. It reads the input string one character at a time, counts the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4), and then prints the sorted sum. This approach avoids storing the entire input string in memory.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Four integer variables to count the occurrences of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    int count1 = 0;\n    int count2 = 0;\n    int count3 = 0;\n    int count4 = 0;\n    \n    // A character variable to read input one by one.\n    char c;\n\n    // Read characters from the input stream until a newline or end-of-file is reached.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c == '1') {\n            count1++;\n        } else if (c == '2') {\n            count2++;\n        } else if (c == '3') {\n            count3++;\n        }\n        // The problem statement guarantees input only contains '1','2','3','4' and '+'.\n        // We can ignore the '+' character. An else-if for '4' is not strictly needed\n        // if the string length is the only constraint, but including it is safer.\n        else if (c == '4') {\n            count4++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // A flag to determine if a '+' should be printed before the next number.\n    int is_first = 1; \n\n    // Print the sorted sum.\n    // A single loop counter 'i' can be used, but declaring it in each loop's scope\n    // is modern practice and doesn't significantly impact memory.\n    for (int i = 0; i < count1; i++) {\n        if (!is_first) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('1');\n        is_first = 0;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < count2; i++) {\n        if (!is_first) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('2');\n        is_first = 0;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < count3; i++) {\n        if (!is_first) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('3');\n        is_first = 0;\n    }\n    for (int i = 0; i < count4; i++) {\n        if (!is_first) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('4');\n        is_first = 0;\n    }\n\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Calculation\n\nThe total memory (m) used for variables in this program is calculated by summing the sizes of all variables declared. The calculation assumes a standard environment where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte, which is typical for competitive programming platforms.\n\nThe variables are stored on the stack and their memory usage is as follows:\n*   `int count1`: 4 bytes\n*   `int count2`: 4 bytes\n*   `int count3`: 4 bytes\n*   `int count4`: 4 bytes\n*   `char c`: 1 byte\n*   `int is_first`: 4 bytes\n*   `int i` (loop counter, space is reused for each loop): 4 bytes\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nm = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 25 bytes.\n\n<<<25>>>"
