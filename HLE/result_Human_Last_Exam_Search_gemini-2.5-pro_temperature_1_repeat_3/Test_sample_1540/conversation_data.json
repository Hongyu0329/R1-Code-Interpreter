    "To solve this problem with the utmost memory efficiency in C, the core idea is to avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously. Since the input strings are provided on separate lines, we can read the first string into a buffer and then read the second string character by character, performing the comparison on the fly. This approach eliminates the need for a second large buffer.\n\nFurther memory optimization can be achieved by carefully selecting the data types for our variables. The problem states that the string length will not exceed 100. For the loop counter that tracks the position in the first string, an `unsigned char` is sufficient, as its range (0-255) comfortably covers the required index range (0-99). An `unsigned char` typically occupies only 1 byte of memory.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Buffer for the first string. Max length is 100, plus 1 for the null terminator.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // Use an unsigned char for the index 'i' as string length is <= 100.\n    // This is more memory-efficient than a standard 4-byte int.\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    // Variable to hold characters from the second string.\n    // It must be an 'int' to correctly handle the End-Of-File (EOF) value.\n    int c;\n\n    // Loop through the first string until its null terminator is reached.\n    while (s1[i] != '\\0') {\n        c = getchar();\n\n        // Skip any whitespace characters (like the newline between inputs).\n        while (isspace(c)) {\n            c = getchar();\n        }\n\n        // Convert characters to the same case for comparison.\n        char c1 = tolower(s1[i]);\n        char c2 = tolower(c);\n\n        // Perform lexicographical comparison.\n        if (c1 < c2) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (c1 > c2) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the sizes of the variables declared in the program:\n*   **`char s1[101]`**: An array to hold the first string, requiring 101 bytes.\n*   **`unsigned char i`**: The loop index. An `unsigned char` uses 1 byte.\n*   **`int c`**: A variable to read characters from the second string via `getchar()`. `getchar()` returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` value, so this variable requires `sizeof(int)`, which is typically 4 bytes on most systems.\n\nThus, the total memory used for variables is:\nm = `sizeof(s1)` + `sizeof(i)` + `sizeof(c)`\nm = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 4 bytes = 106 bytes.\n\n<<<106>>>"
