    "Based on current mycological knowledge, there is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While several mushroom species exhibit a vibrant blue coloration in their fruiting bodies, their spore prints are of other colors.\n\nNotable examples of blue-colored mushrooms and their actual spore print colors include:\n\n*   ***Lactarius indigo*** **(Indigo Milk Cap):** This mushroom is a striking indigo blue but produces a cream to yellowish spore print.\n*   ***Entoloma hochstetteri*** **(Sky-Blue Mushroom):** Famous for its brilliant blue color and being featured on a New Zealand fifty-dollar note, this mushroom has a pink spore print.\n*   ***Stropharia caerulea*** **(Blue Roundhead):** This species has a blue-green cap but produces a purple-brown spore print.\n*   ***Panaeolus cyanescens*** **(Blue-Staining Panaeolus):** Known for its blue-staining reaction, this mushroom has a black spore print.\n*   ***Cortinarius rotundisporus*** **(Elegant Blue Webcap):** This Australian mushroom has a steely blue cap and a reddish-brown spore print.\n*   ***Pleurotus columbinus*** **(Blue Oyster):** While the cap can be bluish-gray, its spore print is not blue.\n\nOne fungus, ***Terana caerulea*** **(Cobalt Crust Fungus)**, is a vibrant blue crust-like fungus. Its spore print is generally considered white, though some sources note a faint \"bluish tinge\" to the white print or describe the microscopic spores as \"pale blue\". However, this is not a distinct and solid blue spore print and it is a crust fungus, not a gilled mushroom which is what is typically referred to when discussing spore prints in this context.\n\nIn summary, the premise that a mushroom genus with a distinctly blue spore print exists is not supported by scientific evidence. Mushroom spore prints are most commonly found in shades of white, pink, brown, and black.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
