There are a finite number of non-isomorphic finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2. The complete classification by Giudici and Hart identifies several families and specific instances of such groups, including certain cyclic groups (C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₂), the group C₂ × C₂, the dihedral group D₆, and the quaternion group Q₁₂. The exact count requires a detailed analysis of the isomorphisms within the provided classification tables.
