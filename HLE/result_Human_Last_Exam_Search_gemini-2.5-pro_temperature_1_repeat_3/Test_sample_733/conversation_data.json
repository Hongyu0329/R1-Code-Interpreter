    "A finite group can have a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2. The classification of such groups was accomplished by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart in their paper \"Small maximal sum-free sets\". A \"sum-free\" set is the term used in the context of abelian groups, but it is equivalent to a \"product-free\" set in general group theory.\n\nA non-empty subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for all *a, b* in *S*, the product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (also referred to as locally maximal) if it is not properly contained within any other product-free set in the group.\n\nAccording to the work of Giudici and Hart, the finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are classified as follows:\n\n**Case 1: The maximal product-free set *S* of size 2 generates the entire group *G*.**\n\nIn this scenario, two sub-cases arise:\n*   **No element in *S* is an involution (an element of order 2):** The group *G* must be a cyclic group C_n, where *n* can be 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 12. The specific maximal product-free sets are detailed in the paper's Table 1.\n*   **One element in *S* is an involution:** The group *G* can be one of the following:\n    *   The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2 (C₂ × C₂).\n    *   The cyclic group of order 6 (C₆).\n    *   The dihedral group of order 6 (D₆).\n\n**Case 2: The maximal product-free set *S* of size 2 does not generate the entire group *G*.**\n\nHere, the group *G* is determined by the structure of the subgroup generated by *S*, denoted as &lt;S&gt;, and the relationship between *G* and &lt;S&gt;. The possibilities for *G* include:\n*   The cyclic group of order 8 (C₈).\n*   The quaternion group of order 12 (Q₁₂).\n*   Other groups as specified in the paper's Table 3, which details the relationship between *G* and the subgroup generated by the maximal product-free set.\n\nTherefore, there is a finite number of such non-isomorphic groups. To determine the exact number, one would need to carefully analyze the tables in the referenced paper to eliminate any isomorphisms between the listed groups. Based on the provided classification, there are more than a dozen such groups.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the classification of groups with maximal product-free sets of size 1 was also completed, resulting in the groups C₂, C₃, C₄, and the quaternion group Q₈. The study of these small maximal product-free sets is a significant area within combinatorial group theory.\n\n<<<There are a finite number of non-isomorphic finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2. The complete classification by Giudici and Hart identifies several families and specific instances of such groups, including certain cyclic groups (C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₂), the group C₂ × C₂, the dihedral group D₆, and the quaternion group Q₁₂. The exact count requires a detailed analysis of the isomorphisms within the provided classification tables.>>>"
