    "To find the general solution of the differential equation:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nFirst, we can rearrange the equation. Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n$x^2y^2 - 9x^2 = x^3yp + y^2p^2 + xyp$\n\nWe can group the terms as follows:\n$x^2(y^2 - 9) = y\\frac{dy}{dx}(x^3 + x) + (y\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can use the substitution $u = y^2$. Differentiating this with respect to $x$ gives $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y\\frac{dy}{dx}$, which means $y\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$. Substituting $u$ and $y\\frac{dy}{dx}$ into the rearranged equation yields:\n$x^2(u - 9) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}(x^3 + x) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2$\n\nMultiplying the entire equation by 4 to eliminate the fractions gives:\n$4x^2(u - 9) = 2x(x^2 + 1)\\frac{du}{dx} + \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2$\n\nRearranging this gives a standard form:\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2 + 1)\\frac{du}{dx} - 4x^2(u - 9) = 0$\n\nNow, introduce a new variable $w = u - 9$. This implies $\\frac{dw}{dx} = \\frac{du}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n$\\left(\\frac{dw}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2 + 1)\\frac{dw}{dx} - 4x^2w = 0$\n\nThis equation can be further simplified with another substitution, $t = x^2$. Then $\\frac{dw}{dx} = \\frac{dw}{dt} \\cdot \\frac{dt}{dx} = \\frac{dw}{dt} \\cdot 2x$. Substituting this into the equation for $w$:\n$(2x \\frac{dw}{dt})^2 + 2x(x^2 + 1)(2x \\frac{dw}{dt}) - 4x^2w = 0$\n$4x^2(\\frac{dw}{dt})^2 + 4x^2(x^2+1)\\frac{dw}{dt} - 4x^2w = 0$\n\nFor $x \\neq 0$, we can divide by $4x^2$:\n$(\\frac{dw}{dt})^2 + (t+1)\\frac{dw}{dt} - w = 0$\n\nLet $P_t = \\frac{dw}{dt}$. The equation can be written as:\n$w = (t+1)P_t + P_t^2$\nThis is a Lagrange differential equation. To solve it, we differentiate with respect to $t$:\n$\\frac{dw}{dt} = P_t = \\frac{d}{dt}((t+1)P_t + P_t^2)$\n$P_t = P_t + (t+1)\\frac{dP_t}{dt} + 2P_t\\frac{dP_t}{dt}$\n$0 = (t + 1 + 2P_t)\\frac{dP_t}{dt}$\n\nThis equation gives two possibilities:\n\n1.  $\\frac{dP_t}{dt} = 0$, which implies $P_t = c$ where $c$ is an arbitrary constant. Substituting this back into the Lagrange equation gives the general solution:\n    $w = c(t+1) + c^2$\n\n2.  $t + 1 + 2P_t = 0$, which gives the singular solution.\n\nTo find the general solution of the original equation, we substitute back the original variables.\nRecall that $w = u - 9 = y^2 - 9$ and $t = x^2$.\nSubstituting these into the general solution $w = c(t+1) + c^2$:\n$y^2 - 9 = c(x^2 + 1) + c^2$\n\nThis is the general solution of the given differential equation. It can also be written as $y^2 = c(x^2+1) + c^2 + 9$.\n\nWe can also find the singular solution from the second case:\n$P_t = -\\frac{t+1}{2}$\n$w = (t+1)(-\\frac{t+1}{2}) + (-\\frac{t+1}{2})^2 = -\\frac{(t+1)^2}{2} + \\frac{(t+1)^2}{4} = -\\frac{(t+1)^2}{4}$\nSubstituting back $y^2-9$ for $w$ and $x^2$ for $t$:\n$y^2-9 = -\\frac{(x^2+1)^2}{4}$, or $4y^2 + (x^2+1)^2 - 36 = 0$.\n\n<<<The general solution of the equation is $y^2 - 9 = c(x^2+1) + c^2$, where c is an arbitrary constant.>>>"
