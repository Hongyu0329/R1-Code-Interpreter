    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first need to understand the definition and calculation method for these numbers as established in the context of generalized cluster algebras and snake graphs. The generalized Markov numbers, denoted \\(m_{p/q}\\), are associated with rational numbers and are defined as the number of perfect matchings of a certain \"snake graph\" \\(G_{p/q}\\). There is a direct algorithm to find a continued fraction that describes the structure of this graph, based on the continued fraction of the rational number \\(p/q\\) itself.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Compute the continued fraction of the rational number.**\n    The rational number is \\(r = 4/7\\). Its continued fraction is calculated as:\n    \\( \\frac{4}{7} = 0 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} = 0 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3}{4}} = 0 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}}} = 0 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} \\)\n    So, the continued fraction for \\(4/7\\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\). The coefficients are \\(a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=3\\).\n\n2.  **Determine the sign sequence from the continued fraction.**\n    The structure of the associated snake graph is described by a path on the Farey graph, which can be translated into a sign sequence. The rule is that for a continued fraction \\([0; a_1, a_2, a_3, \\dots]\\), the path consists of \\(a_1\\) steps to the right (R), followed by \\(a_2\\) steps to the left (L), then \\(a_3\\) to the right (R), and so on. A right step corresponds to a '+' sign, and a left step corresponds to a '-' sign.\n    For \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\), the path is \\(R^1 L^1 R^3\\), which translates to the sign sequence `+ - +++`.\n\n3.  **Form a new continued fraction from the lengths of consecutive signs.**\n    We now look at the sign sequence `+ - +++` and group consecutive identical signs:\n    *   One `+`\n    *   One `-`\n    *   Three `+`s\n    The lengths of these consecutive sign groups form a new sequence of integers: `1, 1, 3`.\n\nThis sequence of integers defines the continued fraction that is associated with the structure of the snake graph \\(G_{4/7}\\), and thus with the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\).\n\nTherefore, the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is \\([1; 1, 3]\\).\n\n<<<[1; 1, 3]>>>"
