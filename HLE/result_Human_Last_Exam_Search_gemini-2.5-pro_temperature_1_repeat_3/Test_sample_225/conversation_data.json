    "The number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt) can be determined by a standard formula when a and b are integers.\n\nThe general form of a Lissajous curve is given by x(t) = A sin(at + δ) and y(t) = B sin(bt). The shape of the curve is highly dependent on the ratio of the frequencies, a/b, and the phase shift δ. The curve is a closed path if the ratio a/b is rational.\n\nFor the specific case of the curve (cos(at), sin(bt)), which is equivalent to (sin(at + π/2), sin(bt)), the number of self-intersection points can be calculated when the greatest common divisor of a and b is 1 (gcd(a,b)=1).\n\nThe formula depends on the parity of a and b. For the given curve, the parametric equations are x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t). Here, a = 9 and b = 5. Both a and b are odd integers, and their greatest common divisor is 1.\n\nFor the case where a and b are both odd and relatively prime, the number of self-intersection points (N) is given by the formula:\nN = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2.\n\nSubstituting the values a = 9 and b = 5 into this formula:\nN = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nN = (8)(4) / 2\nN = 32 / 2\nN = 16\n\nThus, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
