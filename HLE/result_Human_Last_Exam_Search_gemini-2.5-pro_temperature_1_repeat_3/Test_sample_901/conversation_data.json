    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The base, potassium tert-butoxide, is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base, which influences the regioselectivity of the reaction.\n\nFor an E2 elimination to occur in a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (bromine) and the proton being abstracted must be in a trans-diaxial (anti-periplanar) orientation.\n\nThe starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, has a *cis* relationship between the bromo and methyl groups. This means that in the chair conformation, one group must be axial and the other equatorial. For the E2 reaction to proceed, the bromine atom must be in the axial position.\n\nIn the conformer where bromine is axial, there are two different beta-hydrogens that are also in an axial position (and thus, anti-periplanar to the bromine):\n1.  The hydrogen on carbon 2 (which also bears the methyl group).\n2.  The hydrogen on carbon 6.\n\nElimination of the hydrogen from carbon 2 would lead to the more substituted, thermodynamically more stable Zaitsev product, **1-methylcyclohexene**. Elimination of the hydrogen from carbon 6 would lead to the less substituted Hofmann product, **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nBecause potassium tert-butoxide is a large, bulky base, it preferentially abstracts the more sterically accessible proton. The proton on carbon 6 is more accessible than the proton on carbon 2, which is more sterically hindered by the adjacent methyl group. Therefore, the reaction favors the formation of the Hofmann product.\n\nThe major product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
