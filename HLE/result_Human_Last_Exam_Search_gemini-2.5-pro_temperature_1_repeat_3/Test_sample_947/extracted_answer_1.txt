The expression for the magnetic field vector `H(x,z) = H_x \hat{x} + H_z \hat{z}` for `Ha > H0` and `|x| >> w` is given by its components:

`H_x(x,z) = -\frac{\pi J_c d w^2}{D^2} \exp\left(-\frac{2\pi|x|}{D}\right) \cos\left(\frac{2\pi z}{D}\right)`

`H_z(x,z) = H_a + \frac{\pi J_c d w^2}{D^2} \text{sign}(x) \exp\left(-\frac{2\pi|x|}{D}\right) \sin\left(\frac{2\pi z}{D}\right)`

where:
*   `J_c` is the critical current density.
*   `d` is the thickness of each strip.
*   `2w` is the width of each strip.
*   `D` is the stacking interval.
*   `H_a` is the applied magnetic field in the z-direction.
*   `sign(x)` is the sign function, which is `+1` for `x>0` and `-1` for `x<0`.
