    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nThis calculation is based on the structure of a specific, well-documented nanocar molecule. The term \"perfluoro\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms on the molecule's chassis are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nThe nanocar in question consists of two main parts:\n*   **Four wheels:** These are spherical C60 fullerene molecules. Fullerenes are composed entirely of carbon atoms and have no hydrogens, so they are not affected by the perfluorination process.\n*   **A chassis:** The H-shaped chassis connects the four wheels. For a specific \"flexible chassis\" nanocar, the chemical formula has been identified as C₇₀H₃₄. This chassis is a type of oligo(phenylene ethynylene).\n\nIn a perfluoronanocar, each of the 34 hydrogen atoms on the chassis would be substituted with a fluorine atom. Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in the resulting molecule would be 34.\n\n<<<34>>>"
