The effective electron-electron interaction potential, for a given momentum transfer **q** and Matsubara frequency $i\nu_n$, is given by:
$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\nu_n) = -g^2 \sum_j \frac{q_j^2}{m} \frac{1}{\nu_n^2 + w_q^2}$
where:
*   $g$ is the electron-phonon coupling constant.
*   $q_j$ is the j-th component of the momentum transfer vector **q**.
*   $m$ is the mass term from the coupling definition.
*   $w_q$ is the phonon frequency at momentum **q**.
*   $\nu_n$ is the bosonic Matsubara frequency.
*   The sum is over the phonon polarizations *j*.
