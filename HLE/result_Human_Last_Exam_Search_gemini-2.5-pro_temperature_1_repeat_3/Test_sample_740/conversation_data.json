    "Answering the question \"For what values of λ does the equation u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 have no solutions?\" requires analyzing the provided integral equation.\n\nThe given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind, which has the general form u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ₐᵇ K(x, y)u(y)dy.\nIn this specific case:\n*   f(x) = 1\n*   The kernel is K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)\n*   The integration interval is\n\nThe kernel can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:\nK(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k)y^k\n\nThis shows that the kernel is a polynomial in x and y, and is symmetric, meaning K(x, y) = K(y, x).\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative theorem, a unique solution to this equation exists if and only if the corresponding homogeneous equation has only the trivial solution (u(x) = 0). The homogeneous equation is:\nv(x) = λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y)v(y)dy\n\nIf the homogeneous equation has non-trivial solutions (eigenfunctions) for certain values of λ (characteristic values or eigenvalues), the inhomogeneous equation has a solution only if a specific orthogonality condition is met. If this condition is not met, there is no solution.\n\n### Step 1: Finding the Characteristic Values (Eigenvalues)\n\nLet's analyze the homogeneous equation. The integral operator maps any function to a polynomial of degree at most n-1. Therefore, the eigenfunctions v(x) must be polynomials of this form. Let's write the eigenfunction as:\nv(x) = ∑_(j=0)^(n-1) c_j x^j\n\nSubstituting this into the homogeneous equation:\n∑_(j=0)^(n-1) c_j x^j = λ ∫₀¹ (∑_(i=0)^(n-1) x^i y^(n-1-i)) (∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^k) dy\n\nBy equating the coefficients of the powers of x, we can transform the integral equation into a matrix eigenvalue problem.\nThe coefficient of x^i on the right-hand side is:\nλ ∫₀¹ y^(n-1-i) (∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^k) dy = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(n-1-i+k) dy = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (n-i+k)\n\nEquating the coefficients of x^i on both sides gives:\nc_i = λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (n-i+k)\n\nThis is a system of linear equations for the coefficients c = (c₀, c₁, ..., c_(n-1))ᵀ. It can be written as:\nM*c = (1/λ)*c\n\nwhere M is an n×n matrix with entries M_ik = 1/(n-i+k) for i, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nFor a non-trivial solution (c ≠ 0) to exist, 1/λ must be an eigenvalue of the matrix M. The characteristic values λ are therefore the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of M.\n\n### Step 2: The Orthogonality Condition\n\nWhen λ is a characteristic value, the inhomogeneous equation u(x) = 1 + λ ∫ K(x,y)u(y)dy has a solution if and only if the function f(x) = 1 is orthogonal to all eigenfunctions of the adjoint homogeneous equation.\nThe adjoint kernel is K*(y, x) = K(x, y), and since our kernel is symmetric, the operator is self-adjoint. This means the eigenfunctions of the adjoint equation are the same as the eigenfunctions v(x) of the original homogeneous equation.\n\nThe orthogonality condition is:\n∫₀¹ f(x)v(x)dx = 0\n∫₀¹ 1 * v(x)dx = 0\n\nLet's check if this condition can be satisfied for any eigenfunction v(x). An eigenfunction has the form v(x) = ∑_(i=0)^(n-1) c_i x^i, where c is the corresponding eigenvector of the matrix M.\n∫₀¹ v(x)dx = ∫₀¹ (∑_(i=0)^(n-1) c_i x^i) dx = ∑_(i=0)^(n-1) c_i / (i+1)\n\nLet's test this for the case n=2. The matrix is M = [[1/2, 1/3], [1, 1/2]]. The eigenvalues are μ = 1/λ = (3 ± 2√3)/6. An eigenvector c = (c₀, c₁)ᵀ satisfies M*c = μ*c, which gives the relation c₀ = (μ - 1/2)c₁. The orthogonality condition is c₀ + c₁/2 = 0. Substituting c₀ gives (μ - 1/2)c₁ + c₁/2 = μc₁ = 0. Since c₁ ≠ 0 (for a non-trivial solution), this would imply μ=0. However, the calculated eigenvalues are non-zero. Thus, the orthogonality condition is never satisfied.\n\nThis holds for the general case n. The condition ∫₀¹ v(x)dx = 0 is never satisfied for any eigenfunction of this integral operator.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe equation has no solutions if and only if λ is a characteristic value of the homogeneous integral equation. This is because for these values of λ, the required orthogonality condition for the existence of a solution is never met.\n\nThe values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n×n matrix M, where the elements are given by:\nM_ik = 1 / (n - i + k)  for i, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n-dimensional matrix M defined by M_ik = 1/(n-i+k), where i and k range from 0 to n-1."
