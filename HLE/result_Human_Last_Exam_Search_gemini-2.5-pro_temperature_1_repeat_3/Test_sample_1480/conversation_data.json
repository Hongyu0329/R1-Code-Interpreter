    "The rule activation level in a fuzzy system is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership degree of the consequent. A t-norm, or triangular norm, is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic. Common t-norms include the minimum t-norm, the product t-norm, and the Lukasiewicz t-norm.\n\nThe calculation of the rule activation level depends on the specific t-norm being used. Given the values `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`, the activation level can be calculated as follows for different t-norms:\n\n*   **Minimum t-norm:** This is the most common t-norm, which takes the minimum of the two values.\n    `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n*   **Product t-norm:** This t-norm calculates the product of the two values.\n    `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n*   **Lukasiewicz t-norm:** This t-norm is calculated as `max(0, a + b - 1)`.\n    `max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6`\n\nSince the specific t-norm was not provided in the question, and the minimum t-norm is the most frequently used in fuzzy logic systems, it is often the default assumption.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
