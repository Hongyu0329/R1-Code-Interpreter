    "The puzzle involves transforming a grid of numbers based on a specific rule. Let's break down the logic by analyzing the provided examples.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\nFirst, we represent the input and output strings as grids of characters.\n\n**Example A:**\n*   `Input_A`:\n    ```\n    0 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 2 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   `Output_A`:\n    ```\n    2 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\nObservation: The '2' at position (1, 1) moves to position (0, 0). The original position (1, 1) becomes a '0', and the destination position (0, 0), which was a '0', becomes a '2'.\n\n**Example B:**\n*   `Input_B`:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   `Output_B`:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\nObservation: The '2' at position (3, 6) moves to position (2, 7). The original position (3, 6) becomes a '0', and the destination (2, 7), which was a '0', becomes a '2'.\n\n### The Rule\n\nThe core rule is as follows:\n1.  Locate the number '2' in the grid.\n2.  The '2' will move to an adjacent cell (including diagonals) that contains a '0'.\n3.  The original cell of the '2' is replaced with a '0'.\n\nThe crucial part is determining *which* adjacent '0' the '2' moves to if there are multiple options. We need to establish a priority order for the eight possible directions.\n\nLet's denote the directions as relative coordinate pairs `(row_change, column_change)`:\n*   Up-Left: `(-1, -1)`\n*   Up: `(-1, 0)`\n*   Up-Right: `(-1, 1)`\n*   Left: `(0, -1)`\n*   Right: `(0, 1)`\n*   Down-Left: `(1, -1)`\n*   Down: `(1, 0)`\n*   Down-Right: `(1, 1)`\n\nFrom Example A: The '2' is at (1, 1). The adjacent '0's are at (0, 0) and (0, 1). The '2' moves to (0, 0). This means the direction Up-Left `(-1, -1)` has a higher priority than Up `(-1, 0)`.\n\nFrom Example B: The '2' is at (3, 6). The adjacent '0's are at (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), and (3, 5). The '2' moves to (2, 7). This means the direction Up-Right `(-1, 1)` has the highest priority among the available options `[(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1)]`.\n\nCombining these findings, we can establish a partial priority list for the directions of movement:\n1.  Up-Right `(-1, 1)`\n2.  Up-Left `(-1, -1)`\n3.  Up `(-1, 0)`\n4.  ...and so on.\n\n### Solving for Input_C\n\nNow we apply this rule to `Input_C`.\n\n*   `Input_C`: `'000000,011120,111111'`\n*   Grid representation:\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 1 1 1 2 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n\n1.  The '2' is located at position (1, 4).\n2.  We check the adjacent cells for a '0' based on our priority list:\n    *   **Priority 1: Up-Right `(-1, 1)`**: The target position is `(1-1, 4+1) = (0, 5)`. The cell at (0, 5) contains a '0'.\n3.  Since we found a valid move with the highest priority, this is the transformation that will occur.\n    *   The '2' moves from (1, 4) to (0, 5).\n    *   The cell at (1, 4) becomes '0'.\n    *   The cell at (0, 5) becomes '2'.\n\nThe resulting grid is:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n```\n\nConverting this grid back to the string format gives the value for MISSING.\n\n`'000002,011100,111111'`\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
