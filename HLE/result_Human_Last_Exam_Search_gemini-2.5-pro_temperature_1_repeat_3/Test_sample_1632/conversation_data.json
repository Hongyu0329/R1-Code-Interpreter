    "The number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, which is equivalent to a square lattice, is given by the sequence a(n). This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once.\n\nThe initial terms of the sequence a(n), starting from n=0, are:\n1, 4, 12, 36, 100, 284, 780, 2172, 5916, 16268, 44100, ...\n\nHere, a(n) represents the number of self-avoiding walks of length n. To find a(10), we need the 11th term of this sequence (since the sequence starts with a(0)).\n\nThe values are as follows:\n*   a(0) = 1\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   a(10) = 44100\n\nThus, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
