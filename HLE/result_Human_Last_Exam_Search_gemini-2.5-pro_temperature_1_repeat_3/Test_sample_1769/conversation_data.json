    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **Suster**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the linguistic journey the word would have taken:\n\n*   **The Original Anglo-Saxon Word**: Before the Viking invasions, the word for a female sibling in Old English was **sweostor**. There were also regional variations, with **swuster** being a common form, particularly in the influential West Saxon dialect.\n\n*   **The Norse Influence**: The modern word \"sister\" is a hybrid. It evolved from the Middle English word *suster* but was heavily influenced by the Old Norse word **systir**. The distinct \"i\" sound in \"sister\" was borrowed from the Norse term and eventually became standard, likely because of the large Scandinavian-speaking population in the Danelaw region of England.\n\n*   **A Different Path**: Without the influence of the Norse *systir*, the native Old English word would have evolved on its own. The Middle English form *suster* (derived from the Old English *swuster*) would have been the dominant version. Following the typical sound changes in the English language, the 'u' in *suster* (pronounced like the 'oo' in \"foot\") would have likely shifted to the /ÊŒ/ vowel sound, the same \"uh\" sound we use today in words like \"cup\" and \"nut.\"\n\nTherefore, the pronunciation would have evolved from the Middle English \"suster\" to a modern English \"Suster\" (pronounced SUSS-ter).\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
