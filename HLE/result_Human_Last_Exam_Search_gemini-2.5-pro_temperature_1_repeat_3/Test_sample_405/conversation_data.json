    "Five distinct colors can be observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus: white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\nThe most common allotropes of phosphorus are named for their colors. Pure white phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid. However, it often appears as a white or yellowish solid due to impurities or exposure to light, and is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\nRed phosphorus is another well-known allotrope and is characterized by its deep red color. Its shade can vary, sometimes exhibiting an iron-grey luster or ranging from orange-red to a dark red-purple.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most thermodynamically stable form and has a black, flaky appearance with a metallic luster, similar to graphite.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is a distinct crystalline form that is violet or has a red-purple hue. It can also appear as dark orange or brown transparent plates.\n\nA more recently discovered allotrope is blue phosphorus. Initially predicted through computational models, it has since been synthesized. As its name suggests, this allotrope adds blue to the palette of phosphorus colors.\n\nTherefore, the pure allotropes of phosphorus exhibit five main colors:\n*   **White/Yellow**\n*   **Red**\n*   **Black**\n*   **Violet**\n*   **Blue**\n\n<<<5>>>"
