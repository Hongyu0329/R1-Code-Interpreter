    "While the exact number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is a specific mathematical problem, a definitive answer is not readily available in publicly indexed online sources. However, the context of this problem is well-established within the field of recreational mathematics and chess problems.\n\nThe more general problem of placing *n* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board has been studied extensively. A key result in this area is a theorem by George Pólya, which states that a solution for placing *n* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board exists if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. For the 5x5 board, since 5 is not divisible by 2 or 3, it is indeed possible to place 5 non-attacking queens. According to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), there are 10 ways to do this.\n\nThe question of placing a number of queens different from the board's dimension (k queens on an n x n board) is a known variation. The comprehensive work on such problems is often attributed to Václav Kotěšovec, particularly in his book \"Non-attacking chess pieces\". This extensive compilation contains numerous formulas and tables for various chess piece configurations. However, the specific number for 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is not found in the readily accessible snippets of this work.\n\nA closely related problem found in the OEIS is for placing \"semi-queens\" (which have a restricted diagonal attack) on a toroidal board. For a 5x5 board, there are 75 ways to place 4 non-attacking semi-queens. This suggests that the number for standard queens is also a computable, specific integer, though it remains elusive in general web searches.\n\nIn summary, while the problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is a standard one in combinatorial mathematics, the precise number of solutions is not available in the searched web results. The answer is likely contained within specialized publications such as Václav Kotěšovec's \"Non-attacking chess pieces\".\n\n<<<I was unable to provide a specific numerical answer for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard based on the available search results.>>>"
