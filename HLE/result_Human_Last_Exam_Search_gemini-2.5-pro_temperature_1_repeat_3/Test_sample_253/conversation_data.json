    "To determine the binary pattern resulting from applying cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 iterations starting from a single cell in state 1, a step-by-step application of the rule is performed. Rule 110 dictates the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the states of its two immediate neighbors.\n\nThe rule is defined by the binary sequence 01101110, which corresponds to the decimal number 110. This sequence provides the output for each of the eight possible three-cell neighborhood patterns:\n\n| Current Neighborhood | New State for Center Cell |\n|:--------------------:|:-------------------------:|\n|          111         |             0             |\n|          110         |             1             |\n|          101         |             1             |\n|          100         |             0             |\n|          011         |             1             |\n|          010         |             1             |\n|          001         |             1             |\n|          000         |             0             |\n\nStarting with a single '1' (represented as a black cell) surrounded by '0's (white cells), the pattern evolves with each iteration. An analysis of the first 20 steps of this evolution reveals a specific binary pattern. An image displaying the 256-step evolution of Rule 110 from a single cell confirms the pattern at the 20th iteration.\n\nAfter 20 applications of Rule 110, the following binary pattern is generated:\n\n<<<1110110111001111>>>"
