    "The symmetry group of the molecule with the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is **D3h**.\n\nThe molecule, a hexaethynyl-substituted triangular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is planar and possesses a high degree of symmetry. An analysis of its structure reveals the following symmetry elements that define its point group:\n\n*   **A principal C3 axis of rotation:** This axis is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule and passes through its center. A rotation of 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **Three C2 axes of rotation:** These axes are perpendicular to the principal C3 axis and lie within the plane of the molecule. Each axis passes through one of the ethynyl groups and the center of the molecule.\n*   **A horizontal mirror plane (σh):** This plane is coincident with the plane of the molecule itself. As the molecule is planar, this symmetry element is present.\n*   **Three vertical mirror planes (σv):** Each of these planes contains the principal C3 axis and one of the C2 axes.\n*   **An S3 improper rotation axis:** This is also present, coincident with the C3 axis.\n\nThe combination of a principal C3 axis, three perpendicular C2 axes, and a horizontal mirror plane unequivocally places the molecule in the D3h point group. This group is characteristic of trigonal planar molecules with high symmetry.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
