    "In William Morris's novel, *The House of the Wolfings*, the character who visits a Roman city and describes their religious practices in a manner that alludes to Romulus and Remus is **Wood-Sun**.\n\nWood-Sun, a supernatural being and the lover of the protagonist Thiodolf, travels to a Roman city to glean intelligence about the impending invasion. Upon her return, she describes the Romans' power and societal structure to Thiodolf. She recounts her awe at their organized might and the grandeur of their cities, contrasting it with the Goths' more communal and natural way of life.\n\nIn a key passage, she says, \"I tell thee their banner of battle is a wise and a mighty God. For these are the folk of the cities, and in wondrous wise they dwell 'Mid confusion of heaped houses, dim and black as the face of hell; Though therefrom rise roofs most goodly, where their captains and their kings. Dwell amidst the walls of marble in abundance of fair things\".\n\nThe allusion to Romulus and Remus is understood through the context of the Wolfing clan's own totem. The Wolfings, as their name suggests, bear a wolf on their banners and are marked with the image of a wolf. While the text does not explicitly name Romulus and Remus, the description of the Romans also using a wolf emblem on their battle standard is interpreted by readers and scholars as a direct reference to the founding myth of Rome. From the perspective of the Gothic characters, this is seen as the Romans appropriating their sacred symbol.\n\n<<<Wood-Sun>>>"
