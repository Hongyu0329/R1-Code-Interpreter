    "The Hopf charge, or Hopf invariant, of a vector field `n(x,y,z)` that maps from 3D space (compactified to a 3-sphere S³) to the 2-sphere S² can be calculated using Whitehead's integral formula. However, for vector fields with a specific symmetry, the calculation can be simplified by interpreting the Hopf charge as the product of two winding numbers.\n\nThe given vector field is:\n`f = atan2(y,x)`\n`r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`\n`G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))`\n`nx = sin(G)*cos(f)`\n`ny = sin(G)*sin(f)`\n`nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is a unit vector, so it represents a map from R³ to the unit sphere S². To ensure the Hopf charge is well-defined, the field must be constant at infinity. As any coordinate `x, y,` or `z` approaches infinity, `r2` approaches infinity. This causes `G` to approach `PI * exp(-infinity) = 0`. Consequently, the vector `n` approaches `(0, 0, cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)` at infinity. This allows us to consider the domain R³ as being compactified to S³.\n\nThe structure of this vector field is that of a toroidal hopfion. We can analyze it in cylindrical coordinates `(rho, phi, z)`, where `rho = sqrt(x² + y²)`, `phi = atan2(y,x) = f`, and `z=z`.\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` for such an axisymmetric field configuration is given by the product of the toroidal winding number (`n_tor`) and the poloidal winding number (`n_pol`): `H = n_tor * n_pol`.\n\n1.  **Toroidal Winding Number (`n_tor`)**: This number describes how many times the vector `n` wraps around the equator of the target sphere S² as the spatial azimuthal angle `phi` goes from 0 to 2π. In the given definition, the azimuthal angle of the vector `n` is `f`, which is equal to `phi`. This means the vector field rotates once around the z-axis on the target sphere for every one rotation in physical space. Therefore, the toroidal winding number is `n_tor = 1`.\n\n2.  **Poloidal Winding Number (`n_pol`)**: This number is the topological degree of the map from any poloidal plane (a half-plane with `phi` = constant) to the target sphere S². Let's consider the `phi=0` half-plane (`y=0, x>=0`, which corresponds to `rho>=0`). The vector field in this plane is `n = (sin(G), 0, cos(G))`.\n    *   At the spatial boundary (i.e., `rho -> infinity` or `|z| -> infinity`), `r2 -> infinity`, which makes `G -> 0`. So, `n -> (0, 0, 1)`. This means the entire boundary of the poloidal half-plane is mapped to the North Pole of the S² sphere. This allows us to treat the poloidal plane as a compact S².\n    *   At the point where `r2 = 0`, which is `rho = sqrt(0.5)` and `z=0`, `G` takes its maximum value `G = PI`. Here, `n = (0, 0, -1)`, which is the South Pole of the S² sphere.\n\nThe map from the compactified poloidal plane to the target S² covers the sphere exactly once. It maps the boundary of the plane to the North Pole and a single point in the interior to the South Pole. The degree of such a map is 1. Therefore, the poloidal winding number is `n_pol = 1`.\n\nThe Hopf charge is the product of these two winding numbers:\n`H = n_tor * n_pol = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\nThe Whitehead formula provides the formal definition of the Hopf charge. It can be expressed as an integral of the dot product of a vector potential and its curl (the emergent magnetic field) over the volume. For topologically non-trivial field configurations like this one, this integer invariant can be interpreted as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points on the target sphere. The calculation based on winding numbers is a practical method for fields with appropriate symmetry.\n\n<<<1>>>"
