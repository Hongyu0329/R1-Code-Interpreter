    print("  - The hypercomputer follows the same logic (Steps 1 & 2) and determines that it cannot compute Ω.")
    print("  - However, to formally output the answer 'Ω is not in S', the hypercomputer would have to successfully complete its problem-solving task.")
    print("  - But the very act of succeeding in this task would be a way of 'computing' or 'determining' the nature of Ω.")
