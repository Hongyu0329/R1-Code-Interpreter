    # Step 1 & 2: From the matrix equation, we derive a system of scalar equations.
    # LHS = [[x11 + x21, x12 + x22], [x21, x22]]
    # RHS = [[1 + c1*u1, 0], [0, 1 + c2*u2]]
    # Equating the elements gives:
    # (1) x11 + x21 = 1 + c1*u1
    # (2) x12 + x22 = 0
    # (3) x21 = 0
    # (4) x22 = 1 + c2*u2
    #
    # From (3), x21 is 0. Substituting into (1):
    # x11 = 1 + c1*u1
    # This is the key equation we need to solve. It can be rearranged to:
    # u1 = (x11 - 1) / c1

    # Step 3: Use the provided l_1 and alpha_1 to find x_11.
    # We assume x_11 = alpha_1 / l_1 based on the structure of the problem.
    # l_1 = (1 + 10^5)^5
    # alpha_1 = (1 + 10^5)^6 * (1 - 10^5 + 10^10)
    # x_11 = alpha_1 / l_1 = (1 + 10^5) * (1 - 10^5 + 10^10)
    # Using the factorization (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)=a^3+b^3 where a=1 and b=10^5,
    # x_11 simplifies to 1 + (10^5)^3 = 1 + 10^15.

    x11 = 1 + 10**15
    c1 = 10**4

    # Step 4: Calculate u_1
    u1 = (x11 - 1) / c1
