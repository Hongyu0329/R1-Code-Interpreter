def solve_beam_shaping_problem():
    """
    Analyzes the feasibility of generating an arbitrary vector beam
    from a linearly polarized, spatially modulated input.

    The core of the problem lies in comparing the degrees of freedom at the
    input versus the degrees of freedom required for the desired output.

    Input: A single controllable scalar field (the complex amplitude of one
           polarization component). This is 1 degree of freedom.

    Output: An arbitrary vector beam, which requires specifying two independent
            scalar fields (the complex amplitudes for two orthogonal
            polarization components). This requires 2 degrees of freedom.

    Since the number of controllable input degrees of freedom (1) is less than
    the number of required output degrees of freedom (2), it is not possible
    to generate an arbitrary vector beam with the proposed system.
