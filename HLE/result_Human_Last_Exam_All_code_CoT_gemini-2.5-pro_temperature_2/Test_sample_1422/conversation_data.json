    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the topological properties of Feynman diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Introduce the key topological formula** that relates the number of loops (L), internal lines (I), and vertices (V) in any connected Feynman diagram: `L = I - V + 1`.\n2.  **Set the number of loops to two (L=2)** as required by the problem, and rearrange the formula to relate I and V.\n3.  **Introduce the second formula** that relates the properties of the vertices (n-point interaction), the number of vertices (V), internal lines (I), and external lines (E): `n * V = 2 * I + E`.\n4.  **Combine these two formulas** to derive a general expression for the number of vertices (V) in terms of the interaction type (n) and the number of external lines (E).\n5.  **Analyze this expression to find the minimum V**. This involves minimizing the number of external lines (E) and choosing the simplest interaction types (e.g., n=3 for a $\\phi^3$ theory and n=4 for a $\\phi^4$ theory).\n6.  **Calculate and compare** the minimum V for these theories to find the overall minimum. The code will perform and display these calculations step by step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"### Finding the Minimum Number of Vertices for a Two-Loop Diagram ###\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Use the loop formula\n    print(\"Step 1: Use the topological formula for Feynman diagrams.\")\n    print(\"The number of loops (L) is given by L = I - V + 1, where:\")\n    print(\"  I = number of internal lines\")\n    print(\"  V = number of vertices\")\n    \n    L = 2\n    print(f\"\\nFor a two-loop diagram, L = {L}.
