    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the time complexity of the provided algorithm.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Algorithm's Structure:** I will first examine the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm to identify its main computational steps. The core of the algorithm is the `while` loop.\n2.  **Determine the Loop's Driving Factor:** I'll analyze how the loop's control variables change with each iteration. The key is to see how many times the loop will run as a function of the input `n`. In this algorithm, the value of the quotient `q` (and `x` in the subsequent iteration) decreases multiplicatively (i.e., by division) in each step.\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Iterations:** I will formulate a mathematical expression for the number of iterations. Since `n` is effectively divided by `c` repeatedly, the number of iterations will be related to the logarithm of `n`.\n4.  **State the Time Complexity:** Based on the number of iterations and the fact that the operations inside the loop are constant-time, I will determine the overall time complexity in Big O notation.\n5.  **Provide a Python Script:** I will create a Python script that programmatically prints out this step-by-step analysis, leading to the final answer. This fulfills the request to provide code that solves the task.\n\nHere is the Python script that performs the analysis:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity\n    for the given algorithm IMAG(n, c).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"### Analysis of Time Complexity for IMAG(n, c) ###\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the Main Operation\")\n    print(\"The algorithm's runtime is dominated by the 'while q > 0' loop.\")\n    print(\"The number of times this loop executes determines the overall time complexity, as the operations before and inside the loop (assignments, division, subtraction) are constant-time operations.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze How the Loop Progresses\")\n    print(\"The loop continues as long as the quotient 'q' is greater than 0.\")\n    print(\"In each iteration, the variable 'x' is updated with the value of 'q' from the previous step.\")\n    print(\"The new 'q' is calculated as floor(x / c).\")\n    print(\"This means that in every iteration, the magnitude of the number we are working with ('x') is divided by the base 'c'.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the Number of Iterations\")\n    print(\"Let 'k' be the total number of iterations.
