# 3. Conclude which lipid will have a lower surface area.
print("Conclusion:")
print("Because C16-dihydroceramide can pack more tightly and form a denser monolayer, it will occupy a smaller area per molecule.")
print("Therefore, when compressed, C16-dihydroceramide will have a lower surface area.")
