    # Step 1: Define the problem.
    # We are looking for the maximum number m for two sets of non-attacking queens
    # (m white, m black) on an N x N board.

    # Step 2: Establish the upper bound for m.
    # The maximum number of non-attacking queens of a single color on an N x N board
    # is N. This is the solution to the N-Queens problem.
    # Therefore, m cannot be greater than N.
    max_m_possible = N

    # Step 3: Prove that m = N is achievable.
    # This requires finding two disjoint solutions to the N-Queens problem.
    # For a board of even size N, we can take any N-Queens solution and reflect it
    # across the vertical midline to get a second, guaranteed-to-be-disjoint solution.
    #
    # Proof:
    # Let S be a solution containing a queen at position (r, c).
    # The reflected solution S' will have a queen at (r, N-1-c).
    # If S and S' were not disjoint, they would share a common position (r_q, c_q).
    # This implies that the original solution S must contain queens at two positions
    # in the same row: (r_q, c_q) and (r_q, N-1-c_q).
    # This is only possible in a valid solution if the columns are the same: c_q = N-1-c_q.
    # This simplifies to 2 * c_q = N - 1.
    # For N = 16, this gives 2 * c_q = 15, or c_q = 7.5.
    # Since the column index c_q must be an integer, this is impossible.
    # Thus, the two solutions are always disjoint.

    # Step 4: Conclude the maximum value of m.
    # Since m <= 16 and we have proven that m = 16 is achievable, the maximum value is 16.
    final_m = N

    # Step 5: Output the explanation and the final answer.
    # The prompt requests that the final output includes numbers in an equation.
