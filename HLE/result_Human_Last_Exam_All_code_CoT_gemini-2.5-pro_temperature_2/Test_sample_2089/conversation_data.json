    "The film you are referring to is the 1995 Oscar-nominated thriller \"Se7en\". In a tense chase scene, the killer, John Doe, is a passenger on a bus that Detective Mills boards in pursuit of a different suspect. As Mills passes him, John Doe quietly says \"Thank you,\" allowing him to go unnoticed and escape, which is a pivotal moment that seals the tragic fate of the protagonists.\n\nHere is a Python script that states this information. To fulfill the prompt's unique requirement for an \"equation,\" the script will also demonstrate a simple calculation related to the film's central theme of the Seven Deadly Sins.\n\n```python\ndef solve_movie_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the movie trivia question and\n    a thematic equation as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n    film_title = \"Se7en\"\n    character_name = \"John Doe\"\n    key_moment_quote = \"Thank you\"\n    \n    # Thematic \"equation\" based on the seven deadly sins.\n    # We will show the equation 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7,\n    # representing one for each sin.\n    number_of_sins = 7\n    summands = [1] * number_of_sins\n    total = sum(summands)\n    \n    print(f\"In the Oscar-nominated film '{film_title}', the character {character_name} seals his fate by saying \\\"{key_moment_quote}\\\" while boarding a bus.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a simple thematic equation related to the film's plot:\")\n    \n    # Print each number in the final equation\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, summands))\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total}\")\n\nsolve_movie_trivia()\n```\n<<<Se7en>>>"
