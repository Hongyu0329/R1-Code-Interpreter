    "To determine which peptide is most likely to bind an integrin receptor, we need to analyze the amino acid sequences provided. All the peptides contain the \"RGD\" (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) motif, which is the primary recognition site for many integrins. However, the affinity and specificity of this binding are heavily influenced by the amino acids flanking the RGD core.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Define a list of the provided peptide options.\n2.  Establish a \"knowledge base\" containing well-documented RGD-containing sequences known to bind integrins with high affinity. A prominent example is the `RGDSP` sequence from fibronectin, a major component of the extracellular matrix that binds strongly to integrins like α5β1 and αvβ3.\n3.  Iterate through each peptide option and check if it contains a known high-affinity sequence from our knowledge base.\n4.  Print the analysis for each peptide and conclude which one is the most probable binder based on this established biological data.\n\n```python\ndef find_integrin_binding_peptide():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of peptides to find the one most likely to bind an integrin receptor.\n\n    This is based on checking for the presence of well-known integrin-binding motifs\n    beyond the core 'RGD' sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The choices of peptides given in the problem\n    peptides = {\n        \"A\": \"RGDMAA\",\n        \"B\": \"RGDSPSS\",\n        \"C\": \"RGDLTTP\",\n        \"D\": \"RGDQVSK\",\n        \"E\": \"RGDARGG\"\n    }\n\n    # A knowledge base of well-characterized integrin-binding motifs.\n    # The 'RGDSP' sequence from the protein fibronectin is a classic and potent\n    # binder for several types of integrin receptors.\n    known_high_affinity_motifs = [\"RGDSP\"]\n\n    most_likely_option = None\n    reason = \"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing which peptide is most likely to bind an integrin receptor:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    for option, peptide_sequence in peptides.items():\n        is_known_binder = False\n        for motif in known_high_affinity_motifs:\n            if motif in peptide_sequence:\n                print(f\"Checking Option {option}: {peptide_sequence} -> Found the known high-affinity motif '{motif}'.\")\n                most_likely_option = option\n                reason = f\"Peptide B ({peptides['B']}) contains the well-documented '{motif}' sequence from fibronectin, a major ligand for integrins.
