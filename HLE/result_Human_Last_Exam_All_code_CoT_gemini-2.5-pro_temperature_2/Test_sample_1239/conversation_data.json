    "To find the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations of the independent variables (time and space) and dependent variables (velocity and pressure) that leave the equations unchanged. The set of these symmetries forms a Lie group, and its dimension is the number of independent generators of this group.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine this dimension:\n\n1.  **Acknowledge the infinite-dimensional nature:** The full symmetry group is actually infinite-dimensional. This arises because the pressure $p$ only appears through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. Consequently, shifting the pressure by an arbitrary function of time, $p \\rightarrow p + f(t)$, is a symmetry since $\\nabla(p + f(t)) = \\nabla p$. This introduces an infinite number of degrees of freedom.\n\n2.  **Focus on the principal Lie algebra:** In practice, the question usually refers to the maximal finite-dimensional part of the symmetry algebra, often called the \"principal Lie algebra\". This algebra includes the more \"physical\" or \"geometric\" symmetries.\n\n3.  **Categorize and count the generators:** We will categorize the generators of this finite-dimensional algebra and count how many there are for each type in three-dimensional space ($\\mathbb{R}^3$).\n    *   **Time translation:** Shifting the time origin ($t \\rightarrow t + s$). This gives 1 generator.\n    *   **Spatial translations:** Shifting the spatial origin ($\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$). This gives 3 generators in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n    *   **Spatial rotations:** Rotating the coordinate system ($\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{x}$, with $R \\in SO(3)$). This gives 3 generators in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n    *   **Galilean boosts:** Changing to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity ($\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$). This gives 3 generators in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n    *   **Scaling transformations:** A specific dilation of time, space, velocity, and pressure leaves the equations invariant. This gives 1 generator.\n    *   **Constant pressure shift:** Out of the infinite-dimensional family of pressure shifts, the simplest one—a constant shift ($p \\rightarrow p + c$)—is included to form a closed, finite-dimensional algebra. This gives 1 generator.\n\n4.  **Sum the counts:** The total dimension is the sum of the number of generators from each category.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this summation and present the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_lie_group_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the principal Lie group of symmetries\n    of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Introduction explaining the context\n    print(\"The symmetry group of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3 is, strictly speaking, infinite-dimensional due to pressure gauge freedom.\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(\"However, the dimension of its maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra (the principal Lie algebra) is a well-defined integer value.\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(\"\\nThis dimension is the sum of the number of generators from different types of symmetries:\", file=sys.stdout)\n\n    # Number of generators for each type of symmetry\n    time_translation = 1\n    space_translations = 3\n    spatial_rotations = 3\n    galilean_boosts = 3\n    scaling = 1\n    pressure_shift = 1 # Constant pressure shift\n\n    # Calculate the total dimension\n    total_dimension = (time_translation + space_translations + spatial_rotations +\n                       galilean_boosts + scaling + pressure_shift)\n\n    # Print the detailed breakdown of the calculation\n    print(f\"\\nDimension = (Time Translations) + (Space Translations) + (Spatial Rotations) + (Galilean Boosts) + (Scaling) + (Constant Pressure Shift)\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(f\"Dimension = {time_translation} + {space_translations} + {spatial_rotations} + {galilean_boosts} + {scaling} + {pressure_shift}\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(f\"Total Dimension = {total_dimension}\", file=sys.stdout)\n\nsolve_lie_group_dimension()\n```\n<<<12>>>"
