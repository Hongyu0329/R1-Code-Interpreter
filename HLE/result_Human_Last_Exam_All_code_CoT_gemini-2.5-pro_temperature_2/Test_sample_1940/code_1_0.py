    Calculates and explains the minimal number of CCZ gates to synthesize a CCCZ gate.

    The problem asks for the minimal number of CCZ gates to exactly synthesize a CCCZ gate
    without ancilla qubits, given a universal gate set of {CCZ, arbitrary single-qubit rotations}.

    Analysis Steps:
    1. The problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of Toffoli (CCX) gates
       to build a C^3-X gate, because single-qubit rotations are free, and
       CCZ is equivalent to CCX up to Hadamard gates (H) on the target:
       CCX = H * CCZ * H. Similarly, C^3-X = H * CCCZ * H.

    2. Standard decompositions of multi-controlled gates rely on CNOT gates.
       Synthesizing a CNOT from CCZ and rotations without an ancilla is not possible.
       Therefore, we adopt the standard interpretation in circuit synthesis literature:
       CNOT gates are assumed to be available (as logical operations) but their cost
       is zero; only the number of CCZ/Toffoli gates is counted.

    3. The minimal number of Toffoli gates required to synthesize a C^3-X gate
       (a Toffoli gate with 3 controls) without ancillas is known to be 6.
       This is a result from optimal reversible circuit synthesis research.

    We will now describe one such decomposition.

    # We choose one of several known optimal circuits with 6 Toffoli gates.

    # Since H is a single-qubit rotation, each CCX gate costs 1 CCZ gate.
