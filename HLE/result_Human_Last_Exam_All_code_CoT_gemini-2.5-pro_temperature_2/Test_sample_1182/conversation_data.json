    "To find the number of double points of the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8*x+1*x^2+4*x^3+4*x^4+8*x^5$ above 2, we need to find a new model for the curve whose reduction modulo 2 is a stable curve (i.e., its only singularities are ordinary double points or nodes). Then we count the number of these nodes.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial model:** Start with the given equation $F(x, y) = y^2 - (8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5) = 0$. Reduce the equation modulo 2 to get the special fiber.\n2.  **Transform the model:** The initial reduction is singular in a way that is not stable (a \"fat line\"). We will perform a birational transformation to find a better model. An analysis of the equation suggests the transformation $y_1 = (y-x)/2$. This is valid because for any 2-adic point on the curve, $y-x$ is divisible by 2. We will substitute $y = 2y_1 + x$ into the original equation to get a new model.\n3.  **Analyze the new model's reduction:** Reduce the new equation in variables $(x, y_1)$ modulo 2. This gives a new curve over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n4.  **Find singular points:** For the reduced curve $\\tilde{G}(x,y_1)=0$, find its singular points by solving the system of equations $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{G}}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{G}}{\\partial y_1} = 0$.\n5.  **Classify the singularities:** For each singular point, we determine its type. An ordinary double point (a node) is identified if the Hessian of the lowest degree terms of the polynomial at that point is non-degenerate. A node on the reduced curve corresponds to a double point in the stable reduction.\n6.  **Count the double points:** The number of nodes found is the answer to the question. For this problem, we will focus on the affine part of the curve, as this is where the interesting transformation occurs.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that carries out these steps using the `sympy` library.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of double points of the stable reduction of the given curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\n\n    # Step 1: Define the original polynomial equation of the curve\n    print(\"Original curve equation: y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5\\n\")\n    f = 8*x + x**2 + 4*x**3 + 4*x**4 + 8*x**5\n    \n    # Reducing the equation modulo 2\n    f_mod2 = sympy.Poly(f, x, domain=sympy.GF(2)).as_expr()\n    print(f\"The reduction of the curve equation mod 2 is: y^2 = {f_mod2}\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to (y-x)^2 = 0, a 'double line', which is not a stable curve.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Perform a birational transformation\n    # The original equation can be written as y^2 - x^2 = 8x + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5\n    # The RHS is divisible by 4 for any 2-adic integer x.\n    # This implies v_2(y^2-x^2) >= 2, which shows y = x (mod 2).\n    # So we can define a new integer coordinate y1 = (y-x)/2.\n    # Substitute y = 2*y1 + x into the original equation.\n    # (2*y1 + x)^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5\n    # 4*y1^2 + 4*x*y1 + x^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5\n    # 4*(y1^2 + x*y1) = 8x + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5\n    # y1^2 + x*y1 = 2x + x^3 + x^4 + 2x^5\n    \n    y1 = y # Use y to represent y1 for simplicity in sympy\n    new_g = y1**2 + x*y1 - (2*x + x**3 + x**4 + 2*x**5)\n    print(\"Step 2: Transform the model.\")\n    print(f\"The new model is given by the equation: {y1}**2 + {x}*{y1} - (2*{x} + {x}**3 + {x}**4 + 2*{x}**5) = 0\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the new model's reduction\n    # Reduce the coefficients modulo 2.\n    G_mod2 = sympy.Poly(new_g, x, y1, domain=sympy.GF(2)).as_expr()\n    print(\"Step 3: Reduce the new model modulo 2.\")\n    print(f\"The reduced curve over F_2 is: {G_mod2} = 0\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Find the singular points of the reduced curve\n    G_poly = sympy.Poly(G_mod2, x, y1, domain=sympy.GF(2))\n    \n    # Partial derivatives\n    dG_dx = G_poly.diff(x)\n    dG_dy = G_poly.diff(y1)\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Find singular points of the reduced curve.\")\n    print(f\"Partial derivative w.r.t. x: {dG_dx.as_expr()} = 0\")\n    print(f\"Partial derivative w.r.t. y: {dG_dy.as_expr()} = 0\")\n    \n    # Solve the system of equations over F_2\n    singular_points = sympy.solve([dG_dx.as_expr(), dG_dy.as_expr()], [x, y1], domain=sympy.GF(2))\n    \n    if not singular_points:\n        print(\"There are no singular points.
