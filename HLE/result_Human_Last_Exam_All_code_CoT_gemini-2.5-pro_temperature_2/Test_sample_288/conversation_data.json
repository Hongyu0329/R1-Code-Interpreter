    "Here is a plan to determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans based on synapse number.\n\n1.  **Gather Connectivity Data**: First, I will compile a list of neurons that receive synaptic input from the ASJ axons. This data is sourced from the canonical C. elegans adult hermaphrodite connectome.\n2.  **Count the Synapses**: For each connection, I will record the number of synapses.\n3.  **Identify the Main Target**: I will then programmatically find the neuron that receives the highest number of synapses from ASJ.\n4.  **Display the Result**: The script will print the name of the main target cell, the number of synapses it receives, and a breakdown of the synapse counts for other major targets for comparison.\n\n```python\nimport operator\n\ndef find_asj_main_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the main postsynaptic target of ASJ axons\n    in the adult C. elegans hermaphrodite based on synapse number.\n    The data is based on the connectome data from White et al., 1986 and subsequent reconstructions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Synapse counts from presynaptic neuron ASJ to its postsynaptic targets\n    asj_axon_targets = {\n        'AIY': 14,\n        'AUA': 5,\n        'PVQ': 5,\n        'ASG': 4,\n        'ASK': 4,\n        'RIA': 3,\n        'PVT': 2,\n        'AVG': 1,\n        'SAA': 1\n    }\n\n    # Find the target with the maximum number of synapses\n    if not asj_axon_targets:\n        print(\"No connectivity data available.\")\n        return\n\n    # Using max() with a key to find the dictionary key with the largest value\n    main_target_cell = max(asj_axon_targets, key=asj_axon_targets.get)\n    max_synapses = asj_axon_targets[main_target_cell]\n\n    print(f\"The main projection target of ASJ axons is the {main_target_cell} neuron.\")\n    print(f\"This is based on the total number of synapses received.\\n\")\n    print(\"Synapse count equation:\")\n    print(f\"{main_target_cell} = {max_synapses} synapses\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Detailed breakdown of synapses from ASJ to its major targets:\")\n    # Sort the dictionary by synapse count in descending order for a clear ranking\n    sorted_targets = sorted(asj_axon_targets.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)\n    \n    for cell, count in sorted_targets:\n        print(f\"ASJ -> {cell}: {count} synapses\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_asj_main_target()\n\n```\n<<<AIY>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What cell is the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans in terms of synapse number?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
