# The reasoning to find the other critical exponent is based on mathematical analysis
# from harmonic analysis, specifically related to restriction theory for the cone.
# The best constant alpha as a function of p is determined by the maximum of bounds
# derived from different geometric counterexamples.

# One counterexample, Wolff's "hairbrush", gives a bound alpha_W(p) which is
# piecewise linear in 1/p with a change in slope at p = 4.
# alpha_W(p) = 1 - 2/p for 2 < p <= 4
# alpha_W(p) = 1/2 for p > 4

# Another counterexample, by Bourgain, gives a bound alpha_B(p).
# alpha_B(p) = 3/p - 1/2

# The actual best alpha is the maximum of these bounds.
# alpha(p) = max(alpha_W(p), alpha_B(p))

# A new critical exponent, where the slope of alpha(1/p) changes, will be found
# where these two bounds are equal. We must solve alpha_W(p) = alpha_B(p).
# We check for the intersection in the range 2 < p <= 4:
# 1 - 2/p = 3/p - 1/2

# We can represent this equation with variables to make it clear.
# Let x = 1/p. The equation is:
# 1 - 2*x = 3*x - 1/2
# We solve for x:
# 1 + 1/2 = 3*x + 2*x
# 1.5 = 5*x
# x = 1.5 / 5
# x = 0.3

# Now convert x back to p.
# p = 1 / x
p = 1 / 0.3

# The equation for the exponent p is:
# 3/2 = 5/p
# Which gives 3*p = 10.
