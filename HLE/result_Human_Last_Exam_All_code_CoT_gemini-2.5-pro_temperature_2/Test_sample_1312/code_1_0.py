The question asks for a genomic feature that compensates for the lack of genetic recombination. In populations with limited recombination, deleterious mutations accumulate irreversibly, a process known as "Muller's Ratchet," which leads to genetic deterioration.

The correct answer is Polyploidy because it provides a powerful, genome-wide compensatory mechanism. Here's a breakdown of the options:

A. Tandem repeats: These are sequences repeated in a head-to-tail fashion. They are sources of variation but do not systematically protect against the functional loss of genes across the genome.

B. Chromosomal inversions: These genomic rearrangements suppress recombination and thus would exacerbate, not compensate for, the effects of limited recombination.

C. Transposable elements: These "jumping genes" create mutations and can rearrange the genome, but their effects are often disruptive and are not a reliable mechanism to compensate for mutation accumulation.

D. Multigene families: Like polyploidy, this provides gene redundancy, but it is typically localized to specific families of genes. While a valid form of compensation, it is less comprehensive than polyploidy.

E. Polyploidy: This is the state of having multiple complete sets of chromosomes (e.g., 3n, 4n). This provides multiple copies of almost every gene. If a deleterious mutation inactivates one copy of a gene, the other functional copies on the other chromosome sets can mask its effect. This massive redundancy directly counteracts Muller's Ratchet and is hypothesized to be a key reason for the long-term evolutionary success of some asexual lineages.

Therefore, Polyploidy is the intrinsic genome architectural feature that serves as a powerful compensatory mechanism against genetic deterioration.
