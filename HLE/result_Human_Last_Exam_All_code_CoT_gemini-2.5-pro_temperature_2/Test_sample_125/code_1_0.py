# The task is to identify the first card J. Daniel Atlas shows to the camera
# in the opening scene of the movie "Now You See Me".

# In the scene, a woman from the audience chooses the "Seven of Diamonds".
# Atlas then magically produces this card and holds it up for the camera to see,
# right before flicking his wrist to change it to the Four of Hearts.

# Therefore, the first card shown is the Seven of Diamonds.
first_card = "Seven of Diamonds"

# Print the name of the card.
