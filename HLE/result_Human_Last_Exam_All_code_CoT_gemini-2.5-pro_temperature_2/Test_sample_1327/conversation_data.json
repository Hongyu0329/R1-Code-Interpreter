    "The user wants me to find the next number in the sequence.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the sequence:** I will denote the sequence as `x_n`, where `x_1=2`, `x_2=11`, and so on. I'll look for a relationship between consecutive terms.\n2.  **Identify the primary pattern:** I will test for a pattern of the form `x_{n+1} = k * x_n + c`. Trying with `k=2`, I find that the value of `c` changes for each step. Let's call this changing value `a_n`. So the pattern is `x_{n+1} = 2 * x_n + a_n`.\n3.  **Calculate the `a_n` sequence:**\n    *   `x_3 = 2 * x_2 + a_2` => `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`. So, `a_2 = 1`.\n    *   `x_4 = 2 * x_3 + a_3` => `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`. So, `a_3 = 5`.\n    *   `x_5 = 2 * x_4 + a_4` => `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`. So, `a_4 = 17`.\n    This gives a new sequence for `a_n`: `1, 5, 17, ...`\n4.  **Identify the secondary pattern:** I will analyze the `a_n` sequence (`1, 5, 17`) to find its rule. I will look at the differences between its terms.\n    *   Difference 1: `5 - 1 = 4`.\n    *   Difference 2: `17 - 5 = 12`.\n    The sequence of differences is `4, 12`.\n5.  **Identify the tertiary pattern:** The sequence of differences `4, 12` is a geometric progression with a common ratio of `3` (since `12 / 4 = 3`).\n6.  **Calculate the next terms:**\n    *   The next term in the difference sequence is `12 * 3 = 36`.\n    *   The next term in the `a_n` sequence is `17 + 36 = 53`.\n7.  **Calculate the final result:** Using the primary pattern, the next term in the original sequence is `x_6 = 2 * x_5 + a_5`.\n    *   `x_6 = 2 * 119 + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n8.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# The given sequence\nsequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n# We observe the pattern x_n+1 = 2 * x_n + a_n starting from the second term.\n# Let's find the sequence a_n.\na_n = []\n# Start from the second term of the sequence (index 1)\nfor i in range(1, len(sequence) - 1):\n  a = sequence[i+1] - 2 * sequence[i]\n  a_n.append(a)\n\n# The sequence a_n is [1, 5, 17]\n\n# Now, let's find the pattern in a_n by looking at the differences.\ndifferences = []\nfor i in range(len(a_n) - 1):\n  diff = a_n[i+1] - a_n[i]\n  differences.append(diff)\n  \n# The differences are [4, 12]\n\n# This is a geometric progression with a ratio of 3.\nratio = differences[1] / differences[0]\n\n# Calculate the next difference.\nnext_difference = differences[-1] * ratio\n\n# Calculate the next term in the a_n sequence.\nnext_a = a_n[-1] + next_difference\n\n# Get the last term of the original sequence.\nlast_term = sequence[-1]\n\n# Calculate the final result.\nresult = 2 * last_term + next_a\n\n# Print the final equation with all its components.\n# The formula is 2 * last_term + next_a = result\nprint(f\"2 * {last_term} + {int(next_a)} = {int(result)}\")\n```\n<<<291>>>"
