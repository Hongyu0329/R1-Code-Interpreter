    # Step 1 & 2: Define and simplify the ratio of Euler characteristics.
    # The Euler characteristic of a regular dessin D defined by a group G is:
    # chi(D) = |G| * (1/l + 1/m + 1/n - 1)
    # where l, m, n are the orders of the generators b, w, and their product bw.

    # D_N is the quotient dessin defined by the group G/N. Its Euler characteristic is:
    # chi(D_N) = |G/N| * (1/l_N + 1/m_N + 1/n_N - 1)
    # where l_N, m_N, n_N are the orders of bN, wN, and (bw)N in G/N.

    # Step 3: Interpret the "smooth covering" condition.
    # "D is a smooth covering of D_N" means the bi-valency and face length are the same.
    # This implies that the orders of the corresponding generators are preserved:
    # l = l_N, m = m_N, n = n_N.

    # The condition `ord(g) = ord(gN)` for an element g in G and a normal subgroup N
    # is equivalent to the cyclic group <g> generated by g intersecting N trivially,
    # i.e., <g> \cap N = {e}, where 'e' is the identity element.

    # With l=l_N, m=m_N, n=n_N, the term (1/l + 1/m + 1/n - 1) is a common factor.
    # The problem states that chi(D) is negative, so this factor is non-zero.
    # Therefore, we can simplify the ratio:
    # chi(D) / chi(D_N) = |G| / |G/N| = |G| / (|G|/|N|) = |N|.

    # Step 4: Reframe the problem in group-theoretic terms.
    # The question is now: "What is the maximum possible order of a normal subgroup N
    # in a finite group G = <b, w> such that:
    # 1. 1/|b| + 1/|w| + 1/|bw| < 1 (for chi(D) to be negative).
    # 2. <b_G> \cap N = {e}
    # 3. <w_G> \cap N = {e}
    # 4. <(bw)_G> \cap N = {e}"

    # Step 5 & 6: Construct groups to find the maximum |N|.
    # This can be achieved using quotients of infinite hyperbolic triangle groups.
    # Let Gamma = Delta(l, m, n) be the triangle group for a hyperbolic triple (l, m, n), e.g., (2, 3, 7).
    # Gamma is residually finite, which means it has a rich family of finite index normal subgroups.

    # We can construct a descending chain of finite-index normal subgroups of Gamma: Gamma > K1 > K2.
    # We can choose K1 and K2 such that the orders of the generators are preserved in the quotients Gamma/K1 and Gamma/K2.
    # Let G = Gamma/K2 and N = K1/K2. N is a normal subgroup of G.
    # G is a finite group that satisfies the conditions, and the ratio is |N| = [K1:K2], the index of K2 in K1.

    # It is a known result in group theory that for a group like K1 (finitely generated and residually finite),
    # one can always find a normal subgroup K2 (which can be chosen to be normal in all of Gamma) such that the
    # index [K1:K2] is larger than any pre-assigned number.

    # This means that |N| can be arbitrarily large. There is no finite maximum value.

    # Step 7: Final Conclusion.
