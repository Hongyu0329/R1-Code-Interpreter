  # (a) Is alpha(K) context-free for every rational subset K of F?
  # Reasoning: The conjugacy closure of a rational subset in a free group is
  # a rational subset. Every rational subset is also a context-free subset.
  answer_a = "Yes"

  # (b) If alpha(K) is context-free, does this imply that Geo(alpha(K)) is also context-free?
  # Reasoning: This follows from the standard definition of a context-free subset
  # in a free group, where a subset is context-free if and only if its set of
  # geodesic words forms a context-free language.
  answer_b = "Yes"

  # (c) If K is context-free, determine if Geo(alpha(K)) must be context-free for a different choice of generating set A.
  # Reasoning: The conjugacy closure of a context-free set is not necessarily
  # context-free. The property of being a context-free set is independent of the
  # choice of generators, but the closure operation itself can produce a
  # non-context-free set from a context-free one.
  answer_c = "No"
