    "This problem asks for the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$. This is a classic application of the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Chebotarev Density Theorem**: This theorem connects the factorization of a polynomial modulo a prime $p$ to the structure of its Galois group $G$. The density of primes for which the polynomial has a certain factorization pattern is determined by the proportion of elements in $G$ that have a corresponding cycle structure. For $f(x)$ (a degree 7 polynomial) to be irreducible modulo $p$, the Frobenius element at $p$ must act as a single 7-cycle on the roots of $f(x)$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Galois Group**: The polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is a well-known example in Galois theory. Its Galois group over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the Projective Special Linear group $G = \\text{PSL}(2,7)$. This is the simple group of order 168.\n\n3.  **Count 7-cycles**: Our goal is to find the proportion of elements in $G$ that are 7-cycles. In a permutation group acting on 7 elements, an element is a 7-cycle if and only if its order is 7. So, the task reduces to counting the number of elements of order 7 in $\\text{PSL}(2,7)$.\n\n4.  **Sylow's Theorems**: We can find the number of elements of order 7 using Sylow's Theorems. Let $n_7$ be the number of Sylow 7-subgroups of $G$.\n    *   The order of $G = \\text{PSL}(2,7)$ is 168.\n    *   A Sylow 7-subgroup has order 7.\n    *   According to Sylow's Theorems, $n_7$ must divide $|G|/7 = 168/7 = 24$.\n    *   Also, $n_7$ must be congruent to $1 \\pmod 7$.\n    *   Since $\\text{PSL}(2,7)$ is a simple group, it cannot have a unique (and therefore normal) Sylow subgroup, so $n_7 \\neq 1$. The only divisor of 24 that is congruent to $1 \\pmod 7$ and is not 1 is 8. Thus, $n_7=8$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Density**: Each Sylow 7-subgroup is cyclic and contains $7-1=6$ elements of order 7. Since distinct Sylow p-subgroups intersect only at the identity element, the total number of elements of order 7 is $n_7 \\times 6 = 8 \\times 6 = 48$. The desired density is the ratio of this number to the total number of elements in the group: $48/168$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the polynomial\n    f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 remains irreducible mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The Galois group G of the polynomial is PSL(2,7).\n    # Its order is |G| = (p^2-1)(p^2-p) / (2(p-1)) for p=7.\n    G_order = 168\n    p = 7\n    \n    # By the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the density is the proportion of elements\n    # in G that are 7-cycles.
