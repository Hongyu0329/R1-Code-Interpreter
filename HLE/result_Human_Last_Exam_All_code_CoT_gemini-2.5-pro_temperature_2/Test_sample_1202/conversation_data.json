    "To answer your question, I will analyze the provided options about the fate of duplicated genes. My approach will be to use a Python script to evaluate each mechanism against the two key criteria mentioned in the question: **retention** (the duplicated gene is kept in the genome) and **divergence** (it evolves to be different from the original copy).\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define each biological mechanism from the answer choices.\n2.  Assign a score to each mechanism based on how well it explains \"retention\" (score of 1 for yes, 0 for no) and \"divergence\" (1 for yes, 0 for no).\n3.  Calculate a total score for each mechanism by adding the two scores.\n4.  Print a summary of each option, including its description and its final score \"equation\".\n5.  Finally, identify the mechanism(s) with the highest score, which are most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_mechanisms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and scores mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n    \"\"\"\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Gene conversion',\n            'description': 'A process that homogenizes duplicate genes, making them more similar.
