        "A. Daubechies1 (db1): This is the Haar wavelet. It's a discontinuous step-function. Its blocky shape and minimal support (length 2) make it perfect for localizing the sharp, sudden 'on/off' nature of daily rainfall.",
        "B. Symlet2 (sym2): Smoother and longer than db1. This would smear the sharp rainfall events across time.",
