    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that determines the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid based on their approximate modern lengths.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will compile a list of major rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n2.  Next, I will find the approximate modern lengths of these rivers in kilometers.\n3.  Then, I will store this data in a Python dictionary.\n4.  Finally, the script will sort the rivers by length in descending order and print the names and lengths of the top three.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and prints them.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate modern lengths in kilometers.\n    # Sources for mentions include the full text of the Aeneid.\n    # For example: Nile (Aen. 6.800, 8.711-13), Danube/Ister (Aen. 6.800), Euphrates (Aen. 8.726),\n    # Ganges (Aen. 9.31), Tiber (frequent), Rhine/Rhenus (Aen. 8.727), Tigris (Aen. 8.728),\n    # and Eridanus/Po (Aen. 6.659).\n    river_lengths = {\n        \"Nile\": 6650,\n        \"Danube (Ister)\": 2850,\n        \"Euphrates\": 2800,\n        \"Ganges\": 2525,\n        \"Tigris\": 1850,\n        \"Rhine (Rhenus)\": 1233,\n        \"Eridanus (Po)\": 652,\n        \"Hebrus\": 480,\n        \"Tiber\": 406\n        # Other rivers like Simois, Xanthus, Numicus, etc., are much shorter and omitted for clarity.\n    }\n\n    # Sort the dictionary items by length (the value) in descending order.\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(river_lengths.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers.\n    top_three_rivers = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, (name, length) in enumerate(top_three_rivers):\n        print(f\"{i + 1}. {name}: approximately {length} km\")\n\nfind_longest_rivers()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile, the Danube (referred to as Ister), and the Euphrates.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
