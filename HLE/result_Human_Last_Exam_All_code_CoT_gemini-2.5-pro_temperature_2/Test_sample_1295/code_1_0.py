The molecule that satisfies all the given constraints is represented by the following SMILES string:
SMILES: {smiles_representation}

Here is a summary of how this structure meets all the requirements:
- Molecular Formula: C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens}N{num_nitrogens}
- Heavy Atoms: {num_carbons} Carbons + {num_nitrogens} Nitrogens = 14.
- Heteroatoms: {num_nitrogens} Nitrogen atoms.
- Functional Groups:
  - 1 Azo Group (-N=N-).
  - 2 Amidine Groups (-C(=NH)-NH-).
- Nitrogen Atom Classification:
  - 2 Primary (the two '=NH' nitrogens).
  - 2 Secondary (the two '-NH-' nitrogens).
  - 2 Tertiary (the two '-N=N-' nitrogens).
- Hydrogen Bond Donors/Acceptors:
  - Donors: 4 (from the four N-H bonds).
  - Acceptors: 4 (interpreted as the 2 '-NH-' and 2 azo nitrogens).
- Rotatable Bonds: 4 (2 from the N-N single bonds in the backbone and 2 from the neopentyl group).
- Acyclicity: The SMILES string contains no ring-closure numbers, confirming an acyclic structure.
- Formal Charge: 0.

Final Equation (Valence Electron Calculation):
The total number of valence electrons is calculated as follows:
({num_carbons} C * {carbon_valence_e} e-) + ({num_hydrogens} H * {hydrogen_valence_e} e-) + ({num_nitrogens} N * {nitrogen_valence_e} e-) = {num_carbons * carbon_valence_e} + {num_hydrogens * hydrogen_valence_e} + {num_nitrogens * nitrogen_valence_e} = {total_valence_electrons}
