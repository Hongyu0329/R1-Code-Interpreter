    "To find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function matrix $H(s)$, we seek two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ and $D(s), N(s)$ are left-coprime.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding a suitable polynomial matrix $D(s)$ such that $D(s)H(s)$ yields a polynomial matrix $N(s)$. The coprimeness condition is satisfied if the determinant of $D(s)$ has the minimal possible degree, which corresponds to the degree of the pole polynomial of $H(s)$.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Represent the transfer function matrix $H(s)$ using Python's `sympy` library.\n2.  Analyze the condition $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$ row by row. For each row $d_i(s)$ of $D(s)$, the product $d_i(s)H(s)$ must be a row of polynomials. This provides conditions on the elements of $d_i(s)$.\n3.  Based on these conditions, I will determine a set of basis vectors for the rows of $D(s)$. I found through analysis that the rows of $D(s)$ can be constructed as linear combinations of two fundamental polynomial vectors: $v_1(s) = [s+1, 0]$ and $v_2(s) = [1, s-1]$.\n4.  To form a valid and coprime $D(s)$, I will use these basis vectors as its rows. This choice ensures that $D(s)$ is invertible and meets the minimality condition for coprimeness.\n5.  With $D(s)$ established, I will compute $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$.\n6.  The Python code will construct these matrices and print them out. To be explicit as requested, the code will print each element of the resulting matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function matrix H(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the transfer function matrix H(s)\n    H = sympy.Matrix([\n        [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n        [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n    ])\n\n    # Based on the method described, we choose the rows of D(s) to be the\n    # basis vectors that clear the denominators of H(s) when left-multiplied.\n    # These basis vectors are found to be [s+1, 0] and [1, s-1].\n    # This choice leads to a coprime factorization because the determinant of D(s)\n    # is s^2 - 1, and its degree (2) is equal to the degree of the system's\n    # characteristic polynomial.\n    \n    # Construct the denominator matrix D(s)\n    D = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s + 1, 0],\n        [1, s - 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Calculate the numerator matrix N(s) using the formula N(s) = D(s) * H(s)\n    # The result must be a matrix of polynomials.\n    N = sympy.simplify(D * H)\n\n    # Print the results in the required format.\n    print(\"The left coprime factorization of H(s) is given by H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe matrix D(s) is:\")\n    for i in range(D.rows):\n        row_str = \"  \".join(str(elem) for elem in D.row(i))\n        print(f\"  [ {row_str} ]\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nThe matrix N(s) is:\")\n    for i in range(N.rows):\n        row_str = \"  \".join(str(elem) for elem in N.row(i))\n        print(f\"  [ {row_str} ]\")\n\n    # The final answer in a compact format for submission\n    d_list = D.tolist()\n    n_list = N.tolist()\n    final_answer = f\"D(s) = {d_list}, N(s) = {n_list}\"\n    # The output format for the final answer is requested to be in a specific format,\n    # so we'll wrap it with \"<<< >>>\"\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_factorization()\n```\n<<<D(s) = [[s + 1, 0], [1, s - 1]], N(s) = [[s - 1, s + 1], [1, 1]]>>>"
