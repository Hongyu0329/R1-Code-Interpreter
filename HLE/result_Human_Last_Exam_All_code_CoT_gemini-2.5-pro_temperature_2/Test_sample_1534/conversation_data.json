    "To answer your question, I will first research the neuroanatomy of the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*) or closely related cephalopods to identify the structures posterior to the palliovisceral lobe. The palliovisceral lobe is part of the larger subesophageal mass, which controls many motor and autonomic functions. My plan is to create a Python script that will store the names of these adjacent posterior regions and then print them out in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain regions located\n    posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    \n    The information is based on established cephalopod neuroanatomical studies.\n    The palliovisceral lobe is a key part of the subesophageal mass.\n    The structures lying directly posterior to it are also part of this mass\n    and are involved in motor control, particularly for the fins and escape responses.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the brain regions posterior to the palliovisceral lobe\n    posterior_regions = [\"magnocellular lobe\", \"posterior fin lobes\"]\n\n    # Print the answer in a full sentence\n    region_string = \" and \".join(posterior_regions)\n    print(f\"In the dwarf cuttlefish, the brain regions lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the {region_string}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer\nfind_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<In the dwarf cuttlefish, the brain regions lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the magnocellular lobe and posterior fin lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
