    print("Step 1: Understand the context of Calvin Bridges' classic experiment.")
    print("   - Cross: White-eyed female (XwXw) x Red-eyed male (XW Y).")
    print("   - Expected Offspring: Red-eyed females (XW Xw) and white-eyed males (Xw Y).")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 2: Analyze the exceptional offspring observed.")
    print("   - Bridges found two types of unexpected offspring in ~1 of 2000 flies.")
    print("     1. White-eyed females, proven to have an XXY genotype (XwXwY).")
    print("     2. Red-eyed, sterile males, proven to have an X0 genotype (XW 0).")
    print("   - The question focuses on the male (phenotype: 'red eyes, miniature wings', genotype: X0), which is analogous to Bridges' red-eyed X0 male.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 3: Determine the origin of the abnormal gametes.")
    print("   - The X0 male got his X chromosome from his father. This means the mother must have produced an egg with NO X chromosome (a 'nullo-X' or 'O' egg).")
    print("   - The XXY female got both X chromosomes from her mother. This means the mother must have produced an egg with TWO X chromosomes (a 'di-X' or 'XX' egg).")
    print("   - Therefore, the error, or non-disjunction, occurred in the female during meiosis.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    print("Step 4: Distinguish between Meiosis I and Meiosis II non-disjunction.")
    print("   - A) Non-disjunction in Meiosis I: The homologous X chromosomes fail to separate. This single error produces two types of cells after Meiosis I: one with XX and one with no X chromosomes (O). These lead to XX gametes and O gametes exclusively. This cleanly explains the observation of both exceptional offspring types in roughly equal numbers.")
    print("   - B) Non-disjunction in Meiosis II: Sister chromatids fail to separate. This event would occur in only one of the two cells resulting from Meiosis I. This would produce XX gametes, O gametes, and importantly, NORMAL X gametes from the other cell that divided correctly. This does not explain the 1:1 ratio of the exceptional offspring as elegantly.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Conclusion: The most direct cause for the simultaneous production of XX and O gametes, which leads to the XXY and X0 exceptional offspring, is the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate. This is, by definition, non-disjunction in female meiosis I.")
