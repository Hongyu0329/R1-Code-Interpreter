    "My plan is to deduce the correct answer by analyzing the fundamental techniques of each ballroom dance listed. The key to solving this is understanding what \"overturning a turn\" means and which dance's core principles would be violated by it.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Action**: \"Overturning a turn\" means rotating more than the standard amount prescribed for a figure. This is typically achieved by using momentum, body sway, and continuous body rotation (drive).\n2.  **Analyze the Dances**:\n    *   **Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep**: These are \"swing\" dances. They all use Contrary Body Movement (CBM), body sway, and continuous drive and momentum to execute turns. While excessive overturning can be poor technique, the *mechanics* for overturning are part of the dance's technical foundation. Therefore, it's possible to overturn without fundamentally *disregarding* the technique, you're just exaggerating it.\n    *   **European Tango**: This dance is the exception. It is not a swing dance. Its technique is based on a staccato (sharp, non-continuous) action. Crucially, the Tango Reverse Turn is performed *without* body sway. The movement is direct and sharp, with feet picked up and placed.\n3.  **Synthesize**: To overturn a turn, you need to use swing and sway to generate rotational momentum. Introducing swing and sway into a Tango Reverse Turn is not just an exaggeration; it is a direct violation and disregard for the core technique of the dance, which explicitly forbids sway.\n\nI will write a Python script that models this logic to arrive at the final answer. The script will define the technical characteristics of each dance and then check which one has characteristics that make overturning a turn a fundamental violation of its technique.\n\n```python\ndef find_dance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes ballroom dance techniques to answer the user's question.\n    It identifies the dance where overturning a reverse turn is technically impossible\n    without violating the dance's core principles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the core technical principles for turning in each dance.\n    # The key distinction is the use of 'sway' and 'swing', which enable overturning.\n    dance_techniques = {\n        'A': {'name': 'Viennese Waltz', 'sway_and_swing': True},\n        'B': {'name': 'English Waltz', 'sway_and_swing': True},\n        'C': {'name': 'European Tango', 'sway_and_swing': False},\n        'D': {'name': 'Slow Foxtrot', 'sway_and_swing': True},\n        'E': {'name': 'Quickstep', 'sway_and_swing': True}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing which dance's technique is fundamentally incompatible with overturning a reverse turn.\")\n    print(\"The action of 'overturning' relies on using rotational momentum, typically generated from swing and sway.\\n\")\n\n    result = None\n    violation_reason = \"\"\n\n    for key, properties in dance_techniques.items():\n        dance_name = properties['name']\n        uses_sway = properties['sway_and_swing']\n\n        if not uses_sway:\n            result = (key, dance_name)\n            violation_reason = (\n                f\"The {dance_name} technique is fundamentally 'staccato' and has no 'sway'. \"\n                \"Attempting to overturn a turn would require introducing sway and swing, \"\n                \"which is a direct disregard for the core technique.\"\n            )\n            break\n\n    # Print the logical \"equation\" to reach the answer\n    # As there are no numbers, we'll represent the components of the logical deduction.\n    print(\"Final Logical Equation:\")\n    \n    dance_name_part = f\"Dance({result[1]})\"\n    technique_part = \"Technique(No_Sway + No_Swing)\"\n    action_part = \"Action(Overturn_Turn)\"\n    result_part = \"Result(Technical_Violation)\"\n\n    print(f\"'{dance_name_part}' + '{technique_part}' + '{action_part}' => '{result_part}'\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n\" + violation_reason)\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the correct answer is {result[0]}: {result[1]}.\")\n\nfind_dance()\n<<<C>>>\n```"
