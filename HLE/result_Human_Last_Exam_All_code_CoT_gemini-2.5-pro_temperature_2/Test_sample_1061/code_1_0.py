    print("Step 1: Understand the primary drivers of the 13C ratio in tree rings.")
    print("The 13C/12C ratio in tree rings is influenced by two main factors:")
    print("1. The isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2.")
    print("2. The tree's physiological response to local environmental conditions (like water availability).")
    print("\nGlobally, the period of 1886-1990 saw a significant decline in the atmospheric 13C ratio due to the 'Suess Effect' - the burning of fossil fuels which are depleted in 13C. This is the primary background trend.")
    print("\nLocally, drought stress is a key factor. During droughts, trees close their stomata (pores) to save water. This reduces their ability to discriminate against the heavier 13C isotope during photosynthesis, leading to a HIGHER 13C ratio in the rings.")
    print("-" * 70)

    print("Step 2: Evaluate the given answer choices.")
    print("A. An increase in tree ring thickness as the tree matures: While there can be a physiological 'juvenile effect', it is not considered the predominant factor driving a consistent, century-long decline.")
    print("B. Periods of drought: This is incorrect. Drought leads to a HIGHER (less negative) 13C ratio, which is the opposite of the observed decline.")
    print("C. Increased photosynthetic reserves of starch: Using stored starch can cause year-to-year variability but is unlikely to be the primary cause of a 100-year trend.")
    print("D. Thinning earlywood tree ring proportion: This is a secondary response to climate, not the overarching cause itself.")
    print("E. Changes in the SE Asia monsoon: This is the most plausible answer. A strengthening of the monsoon would lead to increased rainfall and humidity. This reduces water stress on the trees, allowing their stomata to remain open. With an ample supply of CO2, the tree can more strongly discriminate against the heavier 13C, resulting in a LOWER 13C ratio in its wood. This climatic effect would amplify the global declining trend caused by the Suess effect, and is a major regional factor.")
    print("-" * 70)
    
    print("Conclusion: While the global decline is due to fossil fuel emissions (the Suess effect), among the given choices, changes in a major climatic system like the SE Asia monsoon is the only factor that could act as a predominant regional driver for a declining 13C ratio.")
