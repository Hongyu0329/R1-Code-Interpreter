# The final result is a concatenation of the answers for each case from A to F.
# Case A: Depends (D)
# Case B: Depends (D)
# Case C: Depends (D)
# Case D: Yes (Y)
# Case E: No (N)
# Case F: Yes (Y)

# Combine the individual answers into the final string format.
answer = "D" + "D" + "D" + "Y" + "N" + "Y"
print(answer)

# Printing the final answer in the requested format
# Although there is no equation, following the spirit of the instruction to output components,
# this could be interpreted as showing how the final string is constructed.
# However, the simple print of the final string is the most direct fulfillment of the task.
