    1.  The Problem: The goal is to use a one-way door (a 'Brownian ratchet') to trap all gas molecules in one compartment. This process would decrease the entropy of the gas, which seemingly violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

    2.  The Second Law and Equilibrium: The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can only increase over time. In a system at uniform thermal equilibrium, where everything is at the same temperature, particles will distribute themselves randomly and evenly.

    3.  Why a simple ratchet fails: If the entire apparatus—the gas in both compartments and the one-way door—is at the same temperature, the door itself will be subject to random thermal motion (Brownian motion). This thermal energy will cause the door to jiggle and flutter. While it's a "one-way" door, this jiggling means it will occasionally open in the "wrong" direction, allowing particles to leak back. At thermal equilibrium, the rate of particles moving from A to B will be balanced by the rate of particles leaking back from B to A. No net change will occur.

    4.  The Required Condition: To make the door a true one-way gate and trap the gas, you must break this thermal equilibrium. This is achieved by creating a temperature difference. If the door mechanism is at a significantly lower temperature than the gas, its own thermal jiggling is suppressed. The higher-energy gas particles can force the door open in the intended direction, but the cold, "stiff" door will not randomly open in the reverse direction. This allows a net flow of particles into one compartment.

    5.  Conclusion: Therefore, the essential experimental parameter that must be controlled and manipulated to create a non-equilibrium state is Temperature.
