# The number of distinct nucleotide bases in this lifeform's DNA.
# This is also the modulus used for the function f(x).
num_bases = 8

# The success condition for the replication is that for each base x (from 0 to 7),
# the count of that base, N_x, must not be equal to x when taken modulo num_bases.
# This means for each of the `num_bases` conditions, there is one forbidden value for the remainder.
# The number of allowed remainder values for each base count is therefore `num_bases - 1`.
num_allowed_remainders = num_bases - 1

# The limiting probability P(n) as n approaches infinity can be found by
# considering the probability that each of the 8 remainder conditions is met.
# As derived from the analysis, the various statistical dependencies between the
# base counts average out, leading to a simple final expression.
# The limiting probability is the ratio of the number of "successful" states
# to the total number of states, raised to the power of the number of bases.
numerator = num_allowed_remainders
