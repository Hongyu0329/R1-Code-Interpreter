    "Here is a step-by-step plan to compute the continued fraction of the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Generalized Markov Number \\(m_{p/q}\\)**\n    The generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) for a rational number \\(p/q\\) is defined as a solution to the Diophantine equation \\(x^2 + p^2 + (q')^2 = 3xpq'\\), where \\(p', q'\\) are integers that satisfy the relation \\(pq' - qp' = 1\\). This relation is a form of BÃ©zout's identity. The number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is conventionally taken as the larger of the two roots of this quadratic equation in \\(x\\).\n\n2.  **Solve for the Specific Case \\(p/q = 4/7\\)**\n    *   First, we need to find integers \\(p'\\) and \\(q'\\) for \\(p=4\\) and \\(q=7\\). We solve the linear Diophantine equation \\(4q' - 7p' = 1\\). The Extended Euclidean Algorithm gives a solution.\n    *   By inspection or algorithm, we find \\(4(2) - 7(1) = 8 - 7 = 1\\). So we can take \\(q'=2\\) and \\(p'=1\\).\n    *   Substitute these values into the generalized Markov equation:\n        \\(x^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 = 3x(4)(2)\\)\n        \\(x^2 + 16 + 4 = 24x\\)\n        \\(x^2 - 24x + 20 = 0\\)\n\n3.  **Find the Value of \\(m_{4/7}\\)**\n    *   Solve the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 24x + 20 = 0\\) using the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\).\n    *   \\(x = \\frac{24 \\pm \\sqrt{(-24)^2 - 4(1)(20)}}{2} = \\frac{24 \\pm \\sqrt{576 - 80}}{2} = \\frac{24 \\pm \\sqrt{496}}{2}\\).\n    *   Simplifying the square root: \\(\\sqrt{496} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 31} = 4\\sqrt{31}\\).\n    *   The solutions are \\(x = \\frac{24 \\pm 4\\sqrt{31}}{2} = 12 \\pm 2\\sqrt{31}\\).\n    *   The generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\) is the larger root: \\(m_{4/7} = 12 + 2\\sqrt{31}\\).\n\n4.  **Compute the Continued Fraction**\n    *   We will use the standard algorithm for finding the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational number of the form \\(\\frac{A + \\sqrt{D}}{B}\\). Our number is \\(12 + 2\\sqrt{31} = 12 + \\sqrt{124}\\). This can be written as \\(\\frac{12 + \\sqrt{124}}{1}\\).\n    *   So, we start with \\(D=124\\), \\(A_0=12\\), and \\(B_0=1\\).\n    *   The algorithm proceeds iteratively:\n        1.  The integer part is \\(a_k = \\lfloor \\frac{A_k + \\sqrt{D}}{B_k} \\rfloor\\).\n        2.  The next terms are computed with the recurrences: \\(A_{k+1} = a_k B_k - A_k\\) and \\(B_{k+1} = \\frac{D - A_{k+1}^2}{B_k}\\).\n    *   We repeat this process until the pair \\((A_k, B_k)\\) repeats, which indicates that the periodic part of the continued fraction has been found.\n    *   The final output will present the value of \\(m_{4/7}\\) and its full continued fraction representation.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_{4/7}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Set up the equation for the Markov number m_{4/7}\n    p, q = 4, 7\n    # We solve 4*q_prime - 7*p_prime = 1.
