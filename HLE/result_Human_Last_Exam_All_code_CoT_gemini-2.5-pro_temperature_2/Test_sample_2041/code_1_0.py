    Solves the problem by analyzing the structure of "shallow" expressions

    # The problem asks for the number of extensionally distinct functions `λp.λx. e` where:
    # - x has type X
    # - p has type PPPX = ((X -> Bool) -> Bool) -> Bool
    # - e has type Bool
    # - e is "shallow": p is never applied to an argument that depends on p.

    # Step 1: Analyze the structure of a shallow expression `e`.
    # Since `e` must be of type Bool, and the highest-order variable available is `p`,
    # `e` must be constructed from applications of `p`.
    # The shallow condition dictates that in any sub-expression `p(q)`, the argument `q` must be free of `p`.
    
    # Step 2: Identify the possible `p`-free arguments `q`.
    # A term `q` must have type PPX, which is (X -> Bool) -> Bool.
    # It must be constructed without `p`, so it can only use the variable `x:X`.
    # Let `q = λr. b`, where `r` has type PX = X -> Bool, and `b` has type Bool.
    # To construct `b`, `q` can apply its argument `r` to `x`, resulting in the boolean `r(x)`.
    
    # Step 3: Count the distinct forms of `q`.
    # Any `p`-free `q` is determined by how it transforms the boolean `r(x)` into its final boolean result `b`.
    # There are exactly four functions from Bool to Bool in lambda calculus:
    # 1. Identity: `λb. b`
    # 2. Negation (NOT): `λb. NOT(b)`
    # 3. Constant True: `λb. True`
    # 4. Constant False: `λb. False`
    
    # Applying these four functions to `r(x)` gives the four possible behaviors for `q`.
    # Thus, there are exactly four distinct `p`-free terms `q` we can construct:
    # q_1 = λr. r(x)
    # q_2 = λr. NOT(r(x))
    # q_3 = λr. True
    # q_4 = λr. False

    print(f"3. We found there are exactly {num_atomic_args} such distinct arguments `q`.")

    # Step 4: Construct the shallow expression `e`.
    # Applying `p` to these four `q` terms gives us four "atomic" booleans:
    # b_1 = p(q_1), b_2 = p(q_2), b_3 = p(q_3), b_4 = p(q_4)
    # Any shallow expression `e` is a boolean combination of these four atomic booleans.
    # This means `e` is equivalent to some function `f(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4)`, where `f` is
    # a function that takes 4 boolean inputs and returns 1 boolean output.
    
    print(f"4. `e` is a boolean function of the {num_atomic_args} atomic results: p(q_1), p(q_2), p(q_3), p(q_4).")

    # Step 5: Count the number of distinct functions `λp.λx. e`.
    # This number is equal to the number of distinct boolean functions `f: Bool^4 -> Bool`.
    
    # A function with `k` boolean inputs has `2^k` possible input combinations.
