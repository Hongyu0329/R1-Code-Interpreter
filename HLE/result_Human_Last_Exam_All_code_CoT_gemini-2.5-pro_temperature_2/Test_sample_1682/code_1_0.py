# The task is to identify the incorrect statement about Chinese wedding traditions.
# Statement C claims that brides used folding fans (折扇) in the Tang and Song dynasties.
# Historical evidence shows that while fans were used to cover the bride's face,
# the type of fan popular during that era was the rigid, circular fan (团扇 or 障扇).
# The folding fan (折扇) became popular much later, during the Ming Dynasty.
# Therefore, statement C is historically incorrect.

incorrect_statement_choice = 'C'
