    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I will determine the nature of the function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. Since $f$ and $g$ are polynomials of degree 3, their composition $h(x)$ will be a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n2.  A fixed point of $h(x)$ is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$. This is equivalent to finding the roots of the polynomial equation $h(x) - x = 0$.\n3.  According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n4.  Next, I must show that this maximum of 9 is achievable. To do this, I need to demonstrate that there exist polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ satisfying the given conditions (degree 3, positive derivatives) such that $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ has 9 distinct real roots.\n5.  By Rolle's Theorem, if a function $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ has 9 roots, its derivative $k'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$ must have at least 8 real roots.\n6.  The derivative $k'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. I will construct an example of such a polynomial using valid forms for $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ and show numerically that it can indeed have 8 real roots.\n7.  I will write a Python script that defines this 8th-degree polynomial and uses `numpy` to find its roots. By showing that 8 real roots are possible for $k'(x)$, I can conclude that 9 fixed points are possible for $h(x)$. The script will then print the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpy.polynomial.polynomial as poly\n\n# Step 1: Theoretical maximum\n# Let f(x) and g(x) be polynomials of degree 3.\n# The composite function h(x) = f(g(x)) is a polynomial of degree 3 * 3 = 9.\n# The fixed points of h(x) are the solutions to the equation h(x) = x.\n# This is equivalent to finding the roots of the polynomial P(x) = h(x) - x = 0.\n# A polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots.\n# Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n# Step 2: Show that 9 is achievable\n# We need to show there exist f and g (degree 3, with f'(x)>0 and g'(x)>0 for all x)\n# such that h(x) - x = 0 has 9 distinct real roots.\n# By Rolle's Theorem, if h(x) - x has 9 roots, its derivative h'(x) - 1 must have 8 real roots.\n# Let's construct a plausible h'(x) - 1 and check the number of its real roots.\n# h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).
