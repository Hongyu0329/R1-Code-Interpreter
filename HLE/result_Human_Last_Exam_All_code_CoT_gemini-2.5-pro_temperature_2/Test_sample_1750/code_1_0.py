    This function solves the problem based on the derivation.
    The integral I simplifies to integral from 0 to pi of (sin(4x) - sin(2x))^50 dx.
    This type of integral evaluates to C * pi, where C is a rational coefficient.
    The problem's requirement for a fractional answer suggests we should find C.
    The coefficient C is given by the formula C = binomial(50, 25) / 2**49.
    This script calculates the numerator and denominator of this fraction.
