    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\nThe user is asking a historical trivia question, not a computational one. My plan is to find the historical fact and then present it within the requested Python code format.\n\n1.  Research the historical figure Andre Vernault and the circumstances of his interrogation by British counterintelligence during WWII.\n2.  Identify the true profession he was concealing.\n3.  Create a Python script that stores this information in a variable.\n4.  Use the `print()` function to output the answer in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\nHere is the Python code to provide the answer:\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Store the true profession of Andre Vernault in a variable.\n# 2. Print the answer in a complete sentence.\n\ndef find_profession():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the answer to the historical question about Andre Vernault.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee, was suspected of being a spy by MI5\n  # because he was evasive during questioning. He lied about his profession\n  # because he feared his true, criminal occupation would get him deported or arrested.\n  true_profession = \"safe-breaker\"\n\n  # Print the final answer.\n  print(f\"Andre Vernault concealed his true profession from British counterintelligence during WWII.\")\n  print(f\"His true profession was a: {true_profession}\")\n\nfind_profession()\n```\n<<<safe-breaker>>>"
