    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms. A systematic enumeration of all possible structures is required.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Mandatory Morphisms**: A category with two objects, say `A` and `B`, must have an identity morphism for each: `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. These are two of our four morphisms.\n2.  **Place the Remaining Morphisms**: This leaves us with two other morphisms to place, let's call them `f` and `g`. We need to consider all possible assignments of source and target objects for `f` and `g`.\n3.  **Define Composition**: For each assignment, we must define the composition rules such that they satisfy the category axioms (associativity and identity laws).\n4.  **Case Analysis**: We can break down the problem into distinct cases based on how `f` and `g` are distributed among the four possible Hom-sets: `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(B, B)`, `Hom(A, B)`, and `Hom(B, A)`.\n5.  **Count Non-Isomorphic Structures**: For each case, we'll determine how many unique (non-isomorphic) category structures can be formed. This will rely on some known results from algebra, specifically the number of non-isomorphic monoids of orders 2 and 3, since `Hom(X, X)` must form a monoid for any object `X`.\n6.  **Sum the Results**: The total count is the sum of the counts from all disjoint cases.\n\nThe Python script below will codify this case analysis, explaining each step and calculating the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n    \n    The solution is found by a combinatorial case analysis. A category with 2 objects, A and B,\n    must contain two identity morphisms, id_A and id_B. This leaves 2 additional morphisms, f and g,\n    to place.
