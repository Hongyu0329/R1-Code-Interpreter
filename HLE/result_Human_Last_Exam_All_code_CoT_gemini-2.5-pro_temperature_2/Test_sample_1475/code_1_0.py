    This function provides the solution to the stated mathematical problem.
    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of an intersection of countably
    many open dense subsets of a specific topological space P(X).

    The reasoning, as outlined in the introductory text, leads to the conclusion that
    the space P(X) is a non-empty, perfect, completely metrizable space. By the Baire
    Category Theorem and results from descriptive set theory, any such intersection
    (which is a dense G-delta set) must have the cardinality of the continuum.
    This result does not depend on the specific choice of X, as long as it satisfies the given conditions.
    Thus, the smallest possible cardinality is the cardinality of the continuum.

    The cardinality of the continuum is represented as 2 raised to the power of aleph-null (the cardinality
    of the natural numbers).
