    This function explains the reasoning to find the smallest possible nonzero
    number of fixed points in the Stone-Cech remainder.

    1. Problem Definition:
    Let f: R -> R be a continuous function.
    Let X be the Stone-Cech compactification of R, denoted beta(R).
    Let F: X -> X be the unique continuous extension of f.
    The Stone-Cech remainder is R* = X \\ R.
    We are looking for the minimum |{p in R* | F(p) = p}|, given that this number is not zero.

    2. Existence of Fixed Points:
    - If f(R) is a bounded set (e.g., f(x) = sin(x)), its extension F maps X into a
      compact subset of R. Any fixed point must therefore lie in R, meaning there are
      zero fixed points in the remainder R*.
    - To have a fixed point in the remainder, f must be "unbounded" in some sense.
      For example, f(x) = x+1. This function is a homeomorphism of R with no fixed points.
      A known theorem states that its extension F has exactly TWO fixed points in R*.

    3. Finding the Minimum Nonzero Number:
    The previous example shows that 2 is a possible number of fixed points. Can we do better?
    The key is to construct a function that is not a homeomorphism and behaves differently
    at positive and negative infinity.

    4. Construction of a function with ONE fixed point:
    Consider the function f(x) defined as:
        f(x) = x + 1   if x >= 0
        f(x) = 1       if x < 0

    This function is continuous on all of R. It has no fixed points in R.

    - Analysis for x < 0:
      A point p in the remainder corresponding to "negative infinity" is mapped by F to the
      point 1 in R. This is because any filter for such a p contains sets like (-infinity, a)
      for a < 0, and f maps these sets to {1}. F(p)=1 is not a point in the remainder, so it cannot be a fixed point.

    - Analysis for x >= 0:
      On the interval [0, infinity), f(x) = x+1. The space [0, infinity) is homeomorphic to R.
      The map g(x) = x+1 is a fixed-point-free homeomorphism on this space.
      Its extension to the Stone-Cech compactification of [0, infinity) is known to have
      a single, unique fixed point at "infinity". This fixed point is in the remainder R*.

    5. Conclusion:
    The constructed function has exactly one fixed point in the remainder. Since it is possible to
    have zero fixed points (as shown with sin(x)), the smallest *nonzero* number of fixed
    points must be 1.

    Therefore, the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points is 1.
