# The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes of spaces with a specific property.
# Our analysis has led to two main categories of spaces satisfying the condition,
# based on the smallest n for which the configuration space F_n(X) is disconnected.

# Case 1: The space has a cut point (e.g., the interval [0, 1]).
# The number of homeomorphism classes for 1-manifolds in this case.
class1_count = 1
print(f"There is {class1_count} homeomorphism class among compact connected 1-manifolds with a cut point: the Arc [0,1].")

# Case 2: The space has no cut points, but is disconnected by removing more than one point (e.g., the circle S^1).
# The number of homeomorphism classes for 1-manifolds in this case.
class2_count = 1
print(f"There is {class2_count} homeomorphism class among compact connected 1-manifolds with no cut points but that satisfy the condition: the Circle S^1.")

# The total number of such classes is the sum of the counts from these two disjoint cases.
total_classes = class1_count + class2_count

# Displaying the final calculation as an equation
print("\nFinal calculation:")
print(f"{class1_count} (Arc) + {class2_count} (Circle) = {total_classes}")

print(f"\nThus, there are {total_classes} distinct homeomorphism classes for such X under the assumption that X is a 1-manifold.")
