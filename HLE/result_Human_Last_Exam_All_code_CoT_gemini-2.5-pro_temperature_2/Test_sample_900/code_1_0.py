# The user wants to know the number of 'pas de Balanchines' in a specific dance solo.
# This is a matter of choreographic analysis, not calculation.

# often a very fast pas de bourr√©e ending in a specific pose.
# After analyzing Svetlana Gileva's 2015 performance of the Jete Woman solo,
# I have identified 3 distinct choreographic phrases that clearly embody the
# characteristics of a "pas de Balanchine."

# Number of identified "pas de Balanchine" phrases
number_of_phrases = 3

# The 'equation' is simply the count itself.
