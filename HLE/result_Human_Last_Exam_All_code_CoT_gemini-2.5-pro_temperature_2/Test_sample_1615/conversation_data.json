    "The problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph. This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for such a graph.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Define the number of vertices**: Let $n$ be the number of vertices in the graph $G$. We are given $n = 12345$.\n\n2.  **Recall the upper bound for chromatic number**: A fundamental theorem in graph theory states that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, its chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n$.\n    $$ \\chi(G) \\le n $$\n\n3.  **Condition for the maximum chromatic number**: The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, thus requiring $n$ distinct colors for a proper coloring.\n\n4.  **Apply the problem's constraint**: The problem explicitly states that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. Therefore, $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n\n5.  **Deduce the new upper bound**: Since $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$.\n    $$ \\chi(G) < n \\implies \\chi(G) \\le n - 1 $$\n    For our case, this means the maximum number of colors is at most $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n6.  **Show that this maximum is achievable**: To confirm that $n-1$ is the maximum possible number of colors, we need to show that there exists at least one graph on $n$ vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of $n-1$.\n    *   Consider the graph $G'$ constructed by taking the complete graph $K_n$ and removing a single edge, say $e=(u,v)$. This graph, denoted $K_n - e$, has $n$ vertices and is not complete.\n    *   The chromatic number of a graph is at least the size of its largest clique (a subgraph that is complete). In $K_n - e$, the set of all vertices except for one of the endpoints of the removed edge (e.g., all vertices except $u$) forms a complete subgraph of size $n-1$, i.e., a $K_{n-1}$ clique.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatic number of $K_n - e$ is at least $n-1$.\n    $$ \\chi(K_n - e) \\ge n - 1 $$\n    *   Combining the upper bound from step 5 ($\\chi(G) \\le n-1$) and this lower bound, we can conclude that the chromatic number of $K_{12345} - e$ is exactly $12344$.\n\n7.  **Final conclusion**: The maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$. The following Python code will calculate this value.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors for a non-complete graph with n vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n\n    # A graph G with n vertices has a chromatic number of n if and only if it is a complete graph (K_n).\n    # Since G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than n.\n    # The maximum possible chromatic number is therefore n - 1.\n    \n    # This maximum is achievable. For instance, the graph K_n with one edge removed\n    # is not complete and contains a clique of size n-1, thus its chromatic number is at least n-1.\n    # Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is exactly n-1.\n    max_colors = n - 1\n\n    print(\"The number of vertices in the graph is n = 12345.\")\n    print(\"For any graph G with n vertices that is not a complete graph, the maximum number of colors needed is n - 1.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
