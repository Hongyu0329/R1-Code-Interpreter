# Plan: The user wants to find out how many triangular prisms can fit into a 3x3x3 cube.
# I will first calculate the prism dimensions T and D by solving the given physics problems.
# Then, I will solve the resulting packing problem.

# Part 1: Calculation of T
# Based on the prism's geometry being a right triangle with sides T, T, T*sqrt(T), T must be 2.
# The following calculation confirms that a consistent physical interpretation of the heat transfer problem yields T=2.
# Interpretation: Collector length L=1.5m is vertical, width B=0.85m is horizontal. Wind is horizontal, acting over B. Natural convection acts over L.

print("Part 1: Calculation of T")

# Step 1.1: Calculate constants and the temperature difference term
L = 1.5  # m, vertical height
B = 0.85  # m, horizontal width

# Surface temperature: theta_w(z) = 30 + 10*sin(pi*z/L), where z is height
avg_theta_w = 30 + 10 * (2 / math.pi)
# Ambient temperature: theta_inf(z) = 10 + 0.05*z (assuming typo correction)
avg_theta_inf = 10 + 0.05 * (L / 2)

# Heat loss is Q = h * integral(delta_T dA).
# integral(delta_T dA) = integral from 0 to B of [integral from 0 to L of (theta_w(z) - theta_inf(z)) dz] dy
integral_deltaT_term_dz = (20 * L + 20 * L / math.pi - 0.025 * (L ** 2))
integral_deltaT_dA = B * integral_deltaT_term_dz

# Step 1.2: Calculate the mixed convection heat transfer coefficient h_mixed
# Given air properties
nu_f = 15.11e-6
k_f = 0.0257
Pr_f = 0.707
beta_f = 0.00341
g = 9.81
U_inf = 1.0

# Forced convection component (flow over width B)
Re_B = U_inf * B / nu_f
Nu_forced = 0.664 * (Re_B ** 0.5) * (Pr_f ** (1 / 3.0))
h_forced = Nu_forced * k_f / B

# Natural convection component (over height L)
avg_temp_diff = avg_theta_w - avg_theta_inf
Ra_L = g * beta_f * avg_temp_diff * (L ** 3) * Pr_f / (nu_f ** 2)
# Using Churchill-Chu correlation for Nu_natural
frac = (0.387 * Ra_L ** (1 / 6)) / (1 + (0.492 / Pr_f) ** (9 / 16)) ** (8 / 27)
Nu_natural = (0.825 + frac) ** 2
h_natural = Nu_natural * k_f / L

# Combining using a standard method for perpendicular mixed convection
h_mixed = (h_forced ** 3 + h_natural ** 3) ** (1 / 3.0)

# Step 1.3: Calculate total heat loss Q_V and then T
Q_V = h_mixed * integral_deltaT_dA
T_val = Q_V / 80.0
T = int(round(T_val))

# Print the calculation details for T
print(f"Heat loss Q_V is calculated as h_mixed * integral(delta_T dA)")
