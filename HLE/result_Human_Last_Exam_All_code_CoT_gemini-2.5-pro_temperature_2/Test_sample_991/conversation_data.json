    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle. I will break down the clues to construct the character step-by-step.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **\"A wooden stick\"**: This directly refers to the Chinese radical for wood or tree, which is **木** (mù). This will be the base of our character.\n2.  **\"hanging a square box\"**: This describes a component that sits on top of the \"wooden stick\" (木). The component is a square box, represented by **口** (kǒu).\n3.  **\"a ladder placed in the center\"**: This is the most figurative clue. It describes a shape inside the \"square box\" (口). A simple visual representation of a ladder or a structure in the center of a box is a cross, **十** (shí).\n4.  **Assembly**: We combine the \"square box\" (口) and the \"ladder\" (十) to get the character **田** (tián), which means \"field\".\n5.  **Final Character**: We then \"hang\" this assembled part (田) on top of the \"wooden stick\" (木). This forms the final character: **果** (guǒ).\n\nThe Python code below will print out this step-by-step logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Chinese character riddle by breaking it down and printing the logic.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This riddle describes the parts of a Chinese character:\")\n    print(\"1.
