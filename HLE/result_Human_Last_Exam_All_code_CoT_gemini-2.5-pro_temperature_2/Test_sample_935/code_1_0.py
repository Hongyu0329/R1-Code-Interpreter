    # Reasoning for each choice
    print(f"Choice A: '{options['A']}' - Incorrect. The sample is not about space.")
    print(f"Choice B: '{options['B']}' - Incorrect. The sample is a pre-recorded female voice, not a live band performance.")
    print(f"Choice C: '{options['C']}' - Incorrect. Similar to B, this doesn't match the sample's nature.")
    print(f"Choice D: '{options['D']}' - Incorrect. While TMBG used their answering machine for 'Dial-A-Song', this specific sample is more structured than an accidental recording.")
    print(f"Choice E: '{options['E']}' - Incorrect. The sample provides time information, it is not a joke service.")
    print(f"Choice G: '{options['G']}' - Incorrect. The voice is a generic announcement voice, not an interview with a specific person.")
    print(f"Choice F: '{options['F']}' - Correct. The content, including phrases about the call being free and announcements of the time, directly corresponds to the automated time services that were common telephone features in that era.")

    correct_answer = 'F'
