# The problem asks for the largest value of p such that no non-zero L^p function
# on R^3 can have its Fourier support lying on the moment curve.
# This value is determined by a critical exponent from Fourier restriction theory.

# Let n be the dimension of the space. In this problem, we are in R^3, so n=3.
n = 3

# For a non-degenerate curve in R^n (like the moment curve), a necessary condition
# for the existence of non-zero L^q functions with Fourier support on the curve
# is that q is greater than or equal to a critical value. Below this value,
# no such functions are expected to exist. The question asks for the boundary
# of this phenomenon.
# This critical exponent, which represents the largest possible value of p for the
# given property to hold, is calculated by the formula:
# p = n * (n + 1) / (n - 1)

# We will now calculate this value for n = 3.

# Numerator of the formula
n_plus_1 = n + 1
numerator = n * n_plus_1

# Denominator of the formula
n_minus_1 = n - 1
denominator = n_minus_1

# Calculate the critical value of p
p_critical = numerator / denominator

# The final equation is p = (n * (n + 1)) / (n - 1)
# We will print each component of this calculation.
