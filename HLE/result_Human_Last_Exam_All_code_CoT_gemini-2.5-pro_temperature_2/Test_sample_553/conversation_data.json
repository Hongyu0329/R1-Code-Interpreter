    "This is a music theory question. My plan is to identify the Beatles song that features the specified chord progression at its beginning.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the musical request**:\n    *   **Tonic**: This is the \"home\" chord of a key, represented by the Roman numeral 'I' (or 'i' if it's a minor key).\n    *   **Minor fifth chord**: This is a minor chord built on the 5th degree of the scale, represented by the Roman numeral 'v'. This is a very distinctive sound, as the 'V' chord in most Western music is major.\n    *   **Chord jump**: A direct progression from one chord to the next.\n    *   **Starts with**: The progression should be a key feature of the song's introduction.\n\n2.  **Analyze Beatles songs**: I will go through my knowledge of The Beatles' discography to find a match. The song \"Michelle\" from the album *Rubber Soul* is a prime candidate.\n\n3.  **Confirm the progression in \"Michelle\"**:\n    *   The song is in the key of F minor.\n    *   The tonic chord (i) is therefore F minor.\n    *   The fifth degree of the F minor scale is C. A minor chord built on C is C minor.\n    *   The song's vocal melody begins with the line \"Michelle, ma belle...\" sung over the tonic F minor chord (i).\n    *   The very next phrase, \"These are words that go together well...\" is sung over a C minor chord (v).\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: \"Michelle\" perfectly fits the description. I will now create a Python script to present this answer, as requested. The script will print the explanation and the name of the song, incorporating the Roman numerals `i` (1) and `v` (5) to satisfy the \"output each number\" constraint.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song_with_progression():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the Beatles song that fits the user's\n    musical description.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    key = \"F minor\"\n    tonic_chord_name = \"F minor\"\n    minor_fifth_chord_name = \"C minor\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Musical Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"The song is in the key of {key}.\")\n\n    # \"Equation\" Part 1: The Tonic Chord\n    # Using the roman numeral 'i' for the first chord in the progression.\n    print(f\"1.
