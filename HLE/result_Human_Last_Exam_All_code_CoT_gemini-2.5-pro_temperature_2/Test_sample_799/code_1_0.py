    This function provides the established mathematical answer to the question.

    - A Sidon set S is a set where for any a, b, c, d in S, the equation a + b = c + d
      implies that the pair {a, b} is identical to the pair {c, d}.
    - The Hausdorff dimension measures the 'fractal' dimension of a set.

    It has been proven that despite the sparseness property of Sidon sets, it is possible
    to construct a Sidon set within the interval [0, 1] that has the maximum possible
    Hausdorff dimension for a subset of the real line.
