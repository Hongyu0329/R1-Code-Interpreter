    # --- Part (a) ---
    # The question is about the decomposition of the VOA V(p). For the given level k = -2 + 1/p,
    # the representation category is known to be logarithmic and not semisimple. This means a direct sum
    # decomposition into simple (irreducible) modules is not possible.
    # However, any module can be decomposed into a direct sum of indecomposable modules.
    answer_a_part1 = "No"

    # --- Part (b) ---
    # The top-level of the module L(p)_n is defined as rho_n. The problem statement
    # specifies that rho_n is the (n+1)-dimensional irreducible representation of sl_2.

    # --- Part (c) ---
    # For p=2, we need the minimal positive conformal weight in V(2).
    # The VOA V(p), also known as the triplet W-algebra W_p, contains a Virasoro subalgebra,
    # which implies the existence of the state L_{-2}|0> with conformal weight 2.
    # The VOA is also strongly generated by a triplet of primary fields of weight 2*p - 1.
    p = 2
    
    # Weight from the Virasoro field sector of the VOA:

    # Weight of the W-algebra's characteristic triplet generators is 2*p - 1:
    weight_triplet_generators = 2 * p - 1
    
    # The minimal positive conformal weight in the VOA is the minimum of the weights of its generators.
