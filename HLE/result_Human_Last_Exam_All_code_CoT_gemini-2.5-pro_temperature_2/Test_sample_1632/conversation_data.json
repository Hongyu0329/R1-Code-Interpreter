    "To find a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, I will write a Python script.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Walk:** A self-avoiding walk starts at an origin point, say (0, 0). At each step, it moves one unit up, down, left, or right. The key constraint is that the walk can never visit the same point more than once.\n\n2.  **Algorithm: Recursive Backtracking:** I will implement a recursive function to explore all possible paths. This is a suitable approach for this kind of combinatorial problem.\n\n3.  **Function Signature:** The recursive function, `count_walks`, will take the following parameters:\n    *   `steps_left`: The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n    *   `x`, `y`: The current coordinates of the walk's head.\n    *   `visited`: A `set` of `(x, y)` tuples representing the path taken so far. Using a set provides fast lookups to check if a point has been visited.\n\n4.  **Execution Flow:**\n    *   **Base Case:** When `steps_left` reaches 0, it means we have successfully completed a valid 10-step walk. The function will return 1 to count this path.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** From the current position `(x, y)`, the function will iterate through the four possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n        *   For each move, it calculates the new position `(nx, ny)`.\n        *   It checks if `(nx, ny)` is in the `visited` set.\n        *   If the new position is not yet visited, the function will:\n            1.  Add `(nx, ny)` to the `visited` set.\n            2.  Call itself recursively with the updated state (`steps_left - 1`, `nx`, `ny`, `visited`).\n            3.  Add the result of the recursive call to a running total.\n            4.  **Backtrack:** Remove `(nx, ny)` from the `visited` set. This is crucial as it allows other paths to be explored from the same point.\n    *   The function returns the total count of valid walks found from its state.\n\n5.  **Initialization:** The script will start the process by calling this recursive function with `steps_left = 10`, starting coordinates `(0, 0)`, and an initial `visited` set containing only the origin, `{(0, 0)}`.\n\nThis method will systematically count every unique self-avoiding walk of length 10.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # On some systems, the default recursion limit might be too low for deep searches,\n    # though it should be sufficient for n=10.\n    # It's good practice to increase it for such problems.\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n    n = 10\n\n    # The recursive backtracking function to count walks.\n    # A dictionary is used as a simple cache (memoization), though for n=10, \n    # the performance gain is not strictly necessary but good practice.\n    # The state is defined by the remaining steps and a frozenset of the path\n    # relative to the current position.
