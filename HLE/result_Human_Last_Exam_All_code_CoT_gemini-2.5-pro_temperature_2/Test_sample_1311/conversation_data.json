    "To determine the binding affinity of the specified compound to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), I will programmatically query the ChEMBL database, a large, open-access database of bioactive drug-like small molecules.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the molecule in ChEMBL. The provided chemical name is long and complex, but this molecule is also known as SY-5609, which I will use as a search term.\n2.  Next, I will identify the protein target, \"Cyclin-dependent kinase 7\", specifically the human version, which is the relevant biological target.\n3.  Then, using the ChEMBL IDs for both the molecule and the target, I will search for measured bioactivity data that links them. I will look for standard affinity measures like IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) or Ki (inhibition constant).\n4.  Finally, I will retrieve the reported affinity value, typically in nanomolar (nM) units, and compare it to the given ranges to identify the correct answer.\n\nThis script requires the `chembl_webresource_client` library.
