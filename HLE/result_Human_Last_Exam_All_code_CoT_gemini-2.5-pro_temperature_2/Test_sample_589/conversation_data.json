    "My plan is to first identify the movie that contains the specific scene described. The user is looking for a Hollywood film where a teenager rides a pink bicycle directly into the path of an oncoming car. This very specific and memorable scene occurs in the 1985 horror sequel, *A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge*.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that will print the name of this movie as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_with_pink_bike_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Hollywood movie\n    featuring a teenager on a pink bike riding towards a car.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\"\n    print(\"The Hollywood feature film in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car is:\")\n    print(movie_title)\n\nfind_movie_with_pink_bike_scene()\n```\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"
