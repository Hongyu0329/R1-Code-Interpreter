    Solves the group theory problem about stingray duos.

    The problem asks about the irreducibility of a pair of elements (g1, g2)
    in GL_d(q) with specific properties.

    Given parameters:
    d = 5 (degree)
    q = 4 (field size)
    e1 = 3 (stingray parameter for g1)
    e2 = 2 (stingray parameter for g2)

    Definitions from the problem:
    - G = GL_d(q)
    - U_i = im(g_i - 1), F_i = ker(g_i - 1)
    - g_i is an e_i-stingray element: dim(U_i) = e_i and g_i acts irreducibly on U_i.
      This implies dim(F_i) = d - e_i.
    - (g_1, g_2) is an (e1, e2)-stingray duo: g1, g2 are stingray elements and U_1 cap U_2 = {0}.

    Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.
