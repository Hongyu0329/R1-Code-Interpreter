    "This is a fascinating historical riddle. Let's break down the clues to find the answer.\n\n**My plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 1: \"a joy-discovering sailor\" from Andrei Voznesensky.** This points to a Russian figure, likely a poet or artist, known for themes of travel, exploration, and a vibrant outlook on life.\n2.  **Analyze Clue 2: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"** This strongly indicates the person's burial place was unknown for a very long time, which often implies they were a victim of political execution or disappearance.\n3.  **Analyze Clue 3: The answer \"emerged in the late 1980s.\"** This is a critical historical marker. The late 1980s was the era of *Glasnost* in the Soviet Union, a time when state secrets were declassified and the fates of many people executed during the Soviet period were finally revealed.\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues:** I'm looking for a Russian poet-explorer who was executed by the Soviet state, and whose secret mass grave was located or publicly confirmed in the late 1980s.\n5.  **Identify the person:** The description perfectly fits the great Acmeist poet Nikolai Gumilyov. He was an avid traveler (especially to Africa, fitting the \"sailor\" metaphor), was executed by the Cheka (the secret police) in 1921, and his burial site was a subject of mystery until it was identified during the Glasnost period.\n6.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that outlines these steps and prints the final last name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the clues provided in the riddle to identify the historical figure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clue 1: The description and its author.\n    author = \"Andrei Voznesensky\"\n    description = \"a joy-discovering sailor\"\n    \n    # Clue 2: The long-standing mystery.\n    mystery_quote = \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n    \n    # Clue 3: The time of resolution.\n    resolution_period = \"late 1980s\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the clues to identify the man:\")\n    print(f\"1. He was described by the Russian poet {author} as '{description}'.\")\n    print(\"   - This suggests an adventurous figure, likely a fellow poet, whose work celebrated exploration and life.\")\n    print(f\"\\n2. His final resting place was a mystery for decades, encapsulated by the question: '{mystery_quote}'\")\n    print(\"   - This points to someone who was a victim of a secret execution or disappearance.\")\n    print(f\"\\n3. The mystery was solved in the {resolution_period}.\")\n    print(\"   - This timeline points directly to the period of Glasnost in the USSR, when information about victims of Soviet political repression was revealed.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSynthesizing the facts:\")\n    print(\"- The man is a famous Russian poet known for his travels (fitting 'sailor').\")\n    print(\"- He was executed by the Soviet state in its early years.\")\n    print(\"- His mass grave was finally located during the late 1980s.\")\n\n    # The person who fits all these criteria is Nikolai Gumilyov.\n    last_name = \"Gumilyov\"\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe person who fits this description is Nikolai Gumilyov.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the requested last name is:\")\n    print(last_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Gumilyov>>>"
