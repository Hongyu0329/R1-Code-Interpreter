    # Evaluation of 3D Diffusion
    print("   - [E] 3D Diffusion:")
    print("     - Analysis: This is an approximation of neutron transport. Its assumptions of slowly-varying, nearly isotropic neutron flux are violated in accident scenarios involving voids or relocated fuel.")
    print("     - Suitability: Inaccurate and unsuitable for high-fidelity accident prediction.\n")

    # Evaluation of Deterministic Transport
    print("   - [A] Pn Transport & [B] Discrete Ordinates (Sn):")
    print("     - Analysis: These methods solve the transport equation and are more accurate than diffusion. However, they discretize angle and/or space, which makes modeling the extreme geometric complexity of a damaged core very challenging.")
    print("     - Suitability: Less suitable than methods that can handle arbitrary geometry without approximation.\n")

    # Evaluation of Monte Carlo
    print("   - [C] & [D] Monte Carlo Method:")
    print("     - Analysis: This method simulates individual neutron histories in a fully explicit 3D model. It is considered the 'gold standard' for neutronic accuracy because it makes very few physics approximations and can model any geometry.")
    print("     - Suitability: Its high fidelity is essential for accurately capturing the physics of a complex accident scenario, making it the most suitable method despite being computationally intensive.\n")

    print("-" * 70)
    print("3. Differentiate between the Monte Carlo options [C] and [D]:\n")
    print("   - Option C: Monte Carlo - Serpent with ENDF/B-VII.1 Data")
    print("   - Option D: Monte Carlo - MCNP with ENDF/B-VIII.1 Data\n")

    print("   - Both MCNP and Serpent are state-of-the-art Monte Carlo codes capable of this analysis.")
    print("   - The primary difference for this decision is the nuclear data library. The Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF/B) version VIII.1 is newer and more advanced than version VII.1, incorporating improved data and models.")
    print("   - Therefore, the combination of a premier Monte Carlo code with the latest nuclear data library represents the most robust and accurate approach available on the list.\n")

    print("Final Conclusion:")
    print("The most suitable choice is D, as it pairs the most physically accurate method (Monte Carlo) with the most up-to-date nuclear data library (ENDF/B-VIII.1).")
