    "This is a geographical riddle. My plan is to identify the location by breaking down the query into distinct constraints and finding the single place on Earth that matches all of them.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Constraints:**\n    *   **Location:** An island town.\n    *   **Remoteness:** More than 500 kilometers from the nearest inhabited island. This points to extremely remote locations like Easter Island, Tristan da Cunha, or the Pitcairn Islands.\n    *   **Geology:** The town sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera. This is a very specific geological feature.\n    *   **Naming:** The town and the bay share the same name.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates:**\n    *   Candidates like Santorini (Greece) or Pago Pago (American Samoa) have towns on caldera bays but are not more than 500 km from other inhabited islands.\n    *   Candidates like Tristan da Cunha are extremely remote but the main settlement is not on a caldera bay.\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui)** fits all criteria. Its main town is **Hanga Roa**, located on **Hanga Roa Bay**. The island is volcanic, and its landscape (and thus its bays) is a direct result of the volcanic activity that formed the island's prominent calderas (like Rano Kau). Most importantly, Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited places on Earth, over 2,000 km from the Pitcairn Islands.\n\n3.  **Code Execution:** I will write a Python script to state the answer and show how each condition is met, including the numerical distance required.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script provides the answer to the geographical riddle by breaking down the requirements.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the elements of the answer based on the riddle's clues.\n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    bay_name = \"Hanga Roa Bay\"\n    geological_feature = \"volcanic caldera\"\n    required_distance_km = 500\n    actual_distance_to_neighbor_km = 2075 # Approximate distance to Pitcairn Islands\n\n    # Print the solution, explaining how each condition is met.\n    print(f\"The island town that matches the description is: {town_name}\")\n    print(f\"1. Name: The town '{town_name}' sits on '{bay_name}', so the names are shared.\")\n    print(f\"2. Geology: The town is on a bay formed by the island's volcanic landscape, which includes a major '{geological_feature}'.\")\n    print(f\"3. Remoteness: The distance to the nearest inhabited island is ~{actual_distance_to_neighbor_km} km, which is more than the required {required_distance_km} km.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which island town, more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island, sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
