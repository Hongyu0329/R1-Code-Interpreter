# The problem, while framed with complex mathematical concepts, can be solved
# by interpreting the non-standard terminology and applying logical deduction.
#
# Plan:
# 1. Interpret the term "discretizes": In mathematics, to discretize a structured set
#    is to remove its structure. For a poset, this means turning it into an antichain
#    (a discrete poset), where no two distinct elements are related. We assume the
#    functor `f`'s description means its source, the poset `I`, is discrete.
#
# 2. Analyze the representation category Fun(I, Vect_K): The category of
#    vector-space-valued functors on a finite discrete poset has a global dimension of 0.
#    This means every object (functor) in this category is projective.
#
# 3. Use the property of projectivity: Since every object is projective, any functor G
#    from this category has a minimal projective resolution of length 0.
#
# 4. Use the property of the linking functor f^k: The problem states that f^k is
#    exact. An exact functor which preserves projectivity (a property of Kan extensions)
#    maps a projective resolution of G to a projective resolution of F=f^k(G).
#    Therefore, F also has a projective resolution of length 0.
#
# 5. Define "n-resolvable": This term logically refers to the length of the minimal
#    resolution of F.
#
# 6. Conclusion: The length of the resolution is 0, so n = 0.

# The final equation is n = 0.
# The number we need to output is 0.
