    # (a) True or false: The energy J_t becomes unbounded from below as t -> +inf if p > 2(1 + 3s) / (1 + s).
    # Analysis:
    # We analyze the scaling of each term in J_t = J(u_t, v_t).
    # The term ||u||_L^p^p scales with t to the power of A_p = (1+s)*(p/2 - 1).
    # The dominant part of the kinetic energy ||u||_{H^{1,s}}^2 scales with t to the power of A_K = 2*s.
    # The functional J_t becomes unbounded below if A_p > A_K for any of the nonlinear terms.
    # The condition is (1+s)*(p/2 - 1) > 2s.
    # Solving for p:
    # p/2 - 1 > 2s / (1+s)
    # p/2 > 1 + 2s/(1+s)
    # p/2 > (1+s+2s)/(1+s) = (1+3s)/(1+s)
    # p > 2*(1+3s)/(1+s)
    # Since the derived condition matches the one in the question, the statement is correct.
    answer_a = "True"

    # (b) Given J_t(u, v) has a mountain pass geometry, does the existence of a critical point
    # imply the existence of a positive ground state solution?
    # Analysis:
    # The Mountain Pass Theorem guarantees a critical point, but not necessarily a ground state
    # (lowest energy solution). The solution could be an excited state. Also, for systems,
    # positivity of solutions is not guaranteed.
    answer_b = "No"

    # (c) If r_1 + r_2 lies in the range (2, 2s), does the minimisation of J_t over P(a,b)
    # yield a unique solution?
    # Analysis:
    # Uniqueness of ground states for coupled nonlinear systems is a very strong property that
    # rarely holds in general. The condition on r_1 + r_2 is likely for the existence of a
    # minimizer. Uniqueness typically fails for broad ranges of parameters and strong coupling.
