    This function explains the logical contradiction inherent in the problem's conditions.
    According to the problem, we need a graph G with n vertices such that:
    1. G is 7-regular.
    2. The chromatic number Ï‡(G) = 5.
    3. The graph contains exactly n copies of C5 (cycles of length 5).
    4. No three of these n C5s can share a common vertex.
    
    Let's analyze the constraints on the cycles.
