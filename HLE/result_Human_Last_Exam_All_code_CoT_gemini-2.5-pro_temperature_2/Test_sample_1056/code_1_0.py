# The problem asks for the rank (r) and torsion order (t) of the abelianization Ab(G) of a group G.

# Step 1: Analyze the group G.
# G is the group of piecewise linear orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of [0, 1].
# - Breakpoints are in Z[τ], where τ = (sqrt(5) - 1) / 2.
# - Slopes are powers of τ, i.e., in τ^Z.
# This group is a well-known object in mathematics, often called the "golden ratio" Thompson's group, or F_τ.
# It is a generalization of the famous Thompson's group F, where breakpoints are dyadic rationals and slopes are powers of 2.

# Step 2: Find the abelianization of G.
# The abelianization of G is Ab(G) = G / G', where G' is the commutator subgroup of G.
# For Thompson-like groups, the abelianization can be found by considering the derivatives at the endpoints 0 and 1.
# Let f be an element of G. Since f is piecewise linear, the right derivative at 0, f'(0), and the left derivative at 1, f'(1), are well-defined.
# By definition of G, the slopes of the linear pieces must be powers of τ.
# Therefore, f'(0) = τ^k and f'(1) = τ^m for some integers k and m.

# Step 3: Define a homomorphism to an abelian group.
# We can define a map φ: G -> Z × Z (the direct product of two copies of the integers) by:
# φ(f) = (k, m) = (log_τ(f'(0)), log_τ(f'(1)))
# This map is a group homomorphism. For any f, g in G, using the chain rule:
# (f∘g)'(0) = f'(g(0)) * g'(0) = f'(0) * g'(0) since g(0)=0.
# (f∘g)'(1) = f'(g(1)) * g'(1) = f'(1) * g'(1) since g(1)=1.
# Taking log_τ shows that φ(f∘g) = φ(f) + φ(g), where addition is component-wise in Z × Z.

# Step 4: Use known results about F_τ.
# It is a standard theorem for Thompson's group F_τ (our group G) that this homomorphism φ is surjective.
# Furthermore, the kernel of φ is exactly the commutator subgroup G'.
# ker(φ) = {f ∈ G | f'(0)=1 and f'(1)=1} = G'.
# By the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, we have G / ker(φ) ≅ Im(φ).
# Substituting what we know: G / G' ≅ Z × Z.
# Therefore, the abelianization of G is isomorphic to Z × Z.
# Ab(G) ≅ Z × Z.

# Step 5: Determine the rank and torsion of Ab(G).
# We need to find the rank (r) and torsion subgroup order (t) for Z × Z, which is isomorphic to Ab(G).
# The rank of an abelian group is the size of the largest set of linearly independent elements. For Z × Z, this is 2.
# An example basis is {(1, 0), (0, 1)}.
r = 2

# The torsion subgroup of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order.
# In Z × Z, the only element with finite order is the identity element (0, 0).
# For any non-zero element (a, b), and any integer n > 0, n * (a, b) = (na, nb) is never (0, 0).
# Thus, the torsion subgroup is the trivial group, which has one element.
t = 1

# We are asked for the pair (r, t).
