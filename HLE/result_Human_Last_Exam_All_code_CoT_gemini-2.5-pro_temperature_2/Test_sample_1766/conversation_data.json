    "Of course, I can help you solve this spin-orbital coupling problem. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers**: A p-electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number `l=1` and a spin quantum number `s=1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j)**: The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, can take values from `|l-s|` to `l+s` in integer steps. We will calculate these possible `j` values.\n3.  **Determine Magnetic Quantum Number (m_j)**: For each `j`, the magnetic quantum number, `m_j`, can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues**: The eigenvalues for the operators are given by:\n    *   $J^2$ eigenvalue = `j(j+1)ħ²`\n    *   $J_z$ eigenvalue = `m_j ħ`\n    We will calculate these pairs of common eigenvalues, setting `ħ=1` for simplicity (atomic units).\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out the results clearly, showing the intermediate steps and final eigenvalue pairs for each multiplet. To improve readability, floating point numbers will be converted to fractions.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef to_frac(x):\n  \"\"\"Converts a float to a string representation of a fraction.\"\"\"\n  return str(Fraction(x).limit_denominator())\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    l = 1  # Orbital angular momentum for a p-electron\n    s = 0.5  # Spin angular momentum for an electron\n\n    print(f\"For a p-electron (l={l}, s={to_frac(s)}), we first find the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j.\")\n    print(f\"j ranges from |l-s| to l+s.\\n\")\n    \n    # Calculate possible j values\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    print(f\"The possible j values are: {', '.join([to_frac(j) for j in j_values])}.\")\n    print(\"We will now find the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for each j multiplet.\")\n    print(\"(Units are in terms of h-bar=1)\\n\")\n    \n    # Iterate through each j value to find the corresponding eigenvalues\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate the J^2 eigenvalue for the current j\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n        print(f\"For the j = {to_frac(j)} multiplet:\")\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue of J^2 is {to_frac(j)} * ({to_frac(j)} + 1) = {to_frac(j2_eigenvalue)}\")\n        \n        # Determine the possible m_j values for the current j\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        print(f\"The corresponding eigenvalues of Jz (m_j) are: {', '.join([to_frac(mj) for mj in mj_values])}\")\n        \n        print(\"\\nThe common eigenvalues (J^2, Jz) are:\")\n        # Print each pair of common eigenvalues\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            print(f\"({to_frac(j2_eigenvalue)}, {to_frac(mj)})\")\n        print()\n\nsolve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n\n# The final answer is the complete set of eigenvalue pairs.\n# There isn't a single numerical answer to provide in the <<<>>> format,\n# as the question asks for the set of all eigenvalues.\n# So I will select a representative eigenvalue as the answer.\n# The largest J^2 eigenvalue is 15/4.\nfinal_answer = 15.0/4.0\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
