    "To find the closed-form expression for the given infinite product, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factorize the general term**: The term inside the product, $1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3}$, can be factored using the complex cube roots of unity, $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$. The factorization is:\n    $1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right)$.\n\n2.  **Relate to the Gamma function**: I will first find the value of the product starting from $n=1$. This product has a known representation based on the Weierstrass product for the Gamma function. The established identity is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n\n3.  **Adjust the starting index**: The problem asks for the product starting from $n=3$. We can obtain this by taking the result from step 2 and dividing out the first two terms (for $n=1$ and $n=2$):\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1 - \\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n4.  **Simplify the expression**: By substituting the formula from step 2 and simplifying the denominator, I will arrive at the final closed-form expression. The denominator becomes $(1 - z^3)(1 - z^3/8)$. After simplification, this yields the final formula.\n\nThe following Python code constructs and prints this final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef generate_formula_string():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates and prints the symbolic formula for the infinite product.\n    The derivation involves the Gamma function and adjusting the product's starting index.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The left-hand side of the equation is the product itself.\n    # The numbers 3 and 3 are explicitly written.\n    lhs = \"Product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3/n^3)\"\n    \n    # The term for n=1 is (1 - z^3/1^3). The number 1 and 3 are present.\n    # The term for n=2 is (1 - z^3/2^3). 2^3 = 8. The numbers 2 and 3 -> 8 are here.\n    # The simplification leads to 8 in the numerator.\n    rhs_numerator = \"8\"\n    \n    # The denominator consists of the polynomial part from the n=1 and n=2 terms\n    # and the Gamma function part from the product starting at n=1.\n    denominator = \"(1 - z^3) * (8 - z^3) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*w) * Gamma(1 - z*w^2)\"\n    \n    # Definition of w (omega) which contains numbers 2 and 3.\n    w_definition = \"where w = exp(2*pi*i/3) is a primitive cube root of unity.\"\n    \n    # Construct the final string representation of the equation.\n    equation = f\"{lhs} = {rhs_numerator} / ({denominator})\"\n    \n    full_answer = f\"{equation},\\n{w_definition}\"\n    \n    print(full_answer)\n\ngenerate_formula_string()\n\n```\n<<<Product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3/n^3) = 8 / ((1 - z^3) * (8 - z^3) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*w) * Gamma(1 - z*w^2)),\nwhere w = exp(2*pi*i/3) is a primitive cube root of unity.>>>"
