    "To solve this problem, we need to find the dimensions of the smallest square that can enclose the given parametric curve. This is determined by the maximum extent of the curve in the x and y directions.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the x-coordinate:** The x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The cosine function has a minimum value of -1 and a maximum value of 1.\n2.  **Analyze the y-coordinate:** The y-coordinate is defined in two parts:\n    *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $y = \\sin(t)$. In this interval, $\\sin(t)$ ranges from 0 to 1.\n    *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5\\sin(t)$. In this interval, $\\sin(t)$ ranges from -1 to 0, so $y$ ranges from -5 to 0.\n    *   Combining both intervals, the overall range for the y-coordinate is from -5 to 1.\n3.  **Determine the figure's dimensions:**\n    *   The width of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values: $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    *   The height of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values: $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n4.  **Find the side of the enclosing square:** The smallest square that outcircles the figure must have a side length equal to the larger of the figure's width and height. In this case, that is $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n5.  **Calculate the area:** The area of this square is the side length squared.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final area.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the min and max for the x-coordinate from x = cos(t)\nx_min = -1.0\nx_max = 1.0\n\n# Step 2: Define the min and max for the y-coordinate\n# For t in [0, pi], y = sin(t), so y is in [0, 1]\n# For t in (pi, 2pi), y = 5*sin(t), so y is in [-5, 0)\ny_min = -5.0\ny_max = 1.0\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the width and height of the figure's bounding box\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\n# Step 4: The side of the smallest outcircling square is the maximum of the width and height\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the area of the square\narea = side_length ** 2\n\nprint(f\"Width of the figure: {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}\")\nprint(f\"Height of the figure: {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}\")\nprint(f\"Side length of the smallest enclosing square: max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}\")\nprint(f\"The final equation for the area is:\")\nprint(f\"{int(side_length)} * {int(side_length)} = {int(area)}\")\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
