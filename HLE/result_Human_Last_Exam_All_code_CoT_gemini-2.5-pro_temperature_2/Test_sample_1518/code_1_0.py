    print("The 't Hooft anomaly matching condition is a fundamental principle in quantum field theory. It states that the anomaly associated with any global symmetry must be the same whether it is calculated using the high-energy (UV) fundamental fields or the low-energy (IR) effective degrees of freedom (like composite particles). This must hold even if the theory undergoes confinement and the global symmetry is spontaneously broken.")

        'B': "Consistency of UV and IR anomalies. (Correct, but this is a restatement of the condition, not its primary *implication*.)",
        'C': "Constraint on low-energy effective theories. (Correct - This is the key physical implication. The condition places powerful, non-perturbative restrictions on what the low-energy theory can look like.)",
        'D': "Requirement of anomaly cancellation. (Incorrect - This applies to GAUGE anomalies. 't Hooft matching is for GLOBAL anomalies, which do not need to be cancelled.)",
        'E': "Matching chiral and gauge currents. (Imprecise - The condition matches the *anomalies* calculated from the currents, not the currents themselves.)",
        'F': "Anomalies dictate symmetry realization. (Correct, but this is a specific example of the broader constraint in C.)",
        'G': "Testing IR theory's validity. (Correct, this is a use-case for the condition, which is a direct consequence of it being a constraint.)",
        'H': "Anomalies guide symmetry breaking patterns. (Correct, but like F, this is a specific manifestation of the general constraint in C.)",
        'I': "Ensures IR fields replicate anomalies. (Correct, but again, this is more of a restatement of the condition itself, similar to B.)",
        'J': "Constrains low-energy degrees of freedom. (Correct, and very similar to C, as the effective theory is defined by its low-energy degrees of freedom.)"

    print("Many of the options describe correct aspects or consequences of the condition. However, the question asks for the physical *implication*. The most powerful and encompassing implication is that the matching requirement acts as a fundamental **constraint** on what form a low-energy effective theory can take. Options F, G, H, and J are all specific ways this constraint manifests. Therefore, C is the best and most general answer.")
