# The problem asks for the definition of the set M used to prove the existence
# and uniqueness of a solution to a boundary value problem using the Banach
# fixed-point theorem.

# The boundary value problem is:
# u''(x) - exp(u(x)) = 0, for x in (0, 1)
# with boundary conditions u(0) = 0 and u(1) = 0.

# A key insight from the equation is that u''(x) = exp(u(x)) > 0, which means
# any solution u(x) must be a convex function. A convex function on [0, 1]
# with u(0)=0 and u(1)=0 must be non-positive (u(x) <= 0).
# This property is used to define the appropriate set M.

# The numbers defining the set M are the interval endpoints and function values
# at these points.
