    # Step 1: Analyze the patient's multi-system symptoms.
    analysis = """
    1.  **Symptom Analysis**: The patient presents a complex clinical picture involving multiple organ systems:
        *   **Eyes**: Transient monocular vision loss.
        *   **Neurology**: Pulsatile headaches and hearing loss.
        *   **Joints**: Joint pain.
        *   **Lungs**: Dyspnea.
        *   **Skin**: A painful lower extremity lesion.
    
    This constellation points toward a systemic inflammatory condition.
    """
    
    # Step 2: Formulate the most likely diagnosis.
    diagnosis = """
    2.  **Likely Diagnosis**: The combination of findings strongly suggests Sarcoidosis, a multi-system granulomatous disorder.
        *   **Neurosarcoidosis** explains the vision loss, hearing loss, and headaches.
        *   **Pulmonary and Systemic Sarcoidosis** explain the dyspnea and joint pain.
        *   The skin lesion is likely **erythema nodosum**, a classic sign of sarcoidosis.
    """
    
    # Step 3: Evaluate the imaging choices based on the likely diagnosis.
    evaluation = """
    3.  **Imaging Finding Evaluation**: With Neurosarcoidosis as the likely diagnosis, we examine the MRI findings:
        *   Choice A is typical for Rheumatoid Arthritis.
        *   Choice C, while possible, is not a common finding in Sarcoidosis.
        *   Choices D and E are less specific and do not fit the overall clinical picture as well as B.
        *   Choice B, **Leptomeningeal enhancement with 'snowball' hyperintensities visualized by MRI**, describes the classic and most characteristic findings of Neurosarcoidosis.

    # Step 4: Final Conclusion.
    conclusion = """
    4.  **Conclusion**: The patient's presentation is most consistent with Sarcoidosis. The expected MRI findings for the neurological symptoms described are those of Neurosarcoidosis.
