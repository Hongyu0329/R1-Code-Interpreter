    print("Analyzing Option A: 'The more knowledge you have, the more knowledge gaps occur, and the stronger is the self-stabilizing effect.'")
    print(f"  - Logic: This suggests the effect increases linearly and indefinitely. However, in the late phase, with 'comprehensive knowledge', the number of discoverable gaps would naturally decrease as you approach mastery. Thus, the effect weakens, making this statement incorrect.\n")

    print("Analyzing Option B: 'In the early learning phase, many knowledge gaps occur... Thus, the self-stabilizing effect is strongest.'")
    print(f"  - Logic: In the early phase, a learner has 'limited knowledge' and often doesn't know enough to even perceive the specific gaps (the 'you don't know what you don't know' phenomenon). Therefore, the effect is weakest, not strongest. This statement is incorrect.\n")

    print("Analyzing Option C: 'The self-stabilizing effect peaks in the late learning phase...'")
    print(f"  - Logic: The peak in discovering new gaps should occur in the intermediate phase, where a learner has enough foundational knowledge to see the connections and the 'holes' between them. The late phase is defined by 'comprehensive knowledge', which implies the rate of discovering new gaps has slowed. Therefore, the peak is unlikely to be in the late phase. This statement is incorrect.\n")

    print("Analyzing Option E: 'The self-stabilizing effect remains constant throughout all learning phases...'")
    print(f"  - Logic: The effect is described as a dynamic process dependent on knowledge acquisition and the perception of gaps. It inherently changes through the learning phases, so it cannot be constant. This statement is incorrect.\n")

    print("======================================\n")
    print("Final Conclusion:")
    print("  - Options A, B, C, and E are all inconsistent with the logical progression described in the provided text.")
    print("  - The effect is weak in the early phase, likely peaks in the intermediate phase, and declines in the late phase.")
