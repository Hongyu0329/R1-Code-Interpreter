    "Answering your question requires delving into a specific topic in finite group theory. A subset `S` of a group `G` is called **product-free** if for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (including the case where `a` and `b` are the same element), their product `ab` is not an element of `S`. A product-free set is **maximal** if it's not a proper subset of any larger product-free set within the group.\n\nA 2018 paper by mathematician R. D. Camina, titled \"Finite groups with a maximal product-free set of size 3,\" claimed to provide a complete classification, stating there are exactly **four** such groups: the cyclic groups `C5` and `C7`, the dihedral group `D14`, and the alternating group `A5`.\n\nHowever, this classification appears to be in conflict with well-established theorems concerning product-free (or sum-free) sets in cyclic groups. For `C5` and `C7`, the largest possible product-free set has been proven to be of size 2. This means no product-free set of size 3 can exist in these groups, and therefore they cannot contain a *maximal* product-free set of size 3.\n\nThis leaves the two non-abelian groups from the paper, `D14` and `A5`, as the remaining candidates. To determine if they indeed possess a maximal product-free set of size 3, we can computationally test them against the standard definition.\n\nThe following Python script will define these two groups, search through all their subsets of size 3, and check for the maximal product-free property. It will count how many of the groups tested satisfy the condition. The script uses the `sympy` library to handle the alternating group `A5`; if you don't have it installed (`pip install sympy`), that specific test will be skipped.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef is_product_free(mult_table, s_indices):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a subset is product-free.\"\"\"\n    s_set = set(s_indices)\n    for a in s_indices:\n        for b in s_indices:\n            product = mult_table[a][b]\n            if product in s_set:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef is_maximal(mult_table, s_indices):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a product-free subset is maximal.\"\"\"\n    s_set = set(s_indices)\n    n = len(mult_table)\n    all_elements = set(range(n))\n    other_elements = all_elements - s_set\n\n    for g in other_elements:\n        extended_set = s_set | {g}\n        # We check if adding 'g' preserves the product-free property.\n        # If it does for any 'g', then 's_set' is not maximal.\n        is_violation_found = False\n        \n        # Check products involving g: g*g, g*s, s*g\n        if mult_table[g][g] in extended_set:\n            is_violation_found = True\n        else:\n            for s_elem in s_set:\n                if mult_table[g][s_elem] in extended_set or mult_table[s_elem][g] in extended_set:\n                    is_violation_found = True\n                    break\n        \n        # If no product violation was found by adding 'g', the original set is not maximal.\n        if not is_violation_found:\n            return False\n            \n    # If all other elements 'g' violate the property when added, the set is maximal.\n    return True\n\ndef count_sets_in_group(group_name, mult_table, size=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts maximal product-free sets of a given size in a group.\n    Returns 1 if such sets exist, 0 otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if mult_table is None:\n        return 0\n        \n    n = len(mult_table)\n    # The identity element 'e' (index 0) cannot be in a product-free set, as e*e=e.\n    # We only need to check combinations from non-identity elements.\n    elements_to_check = range(1, n)\n    count = 0\n    \n    for s_indices in itertools.combinations(elements_to_check, size):\n        if is_product_free(mult_table, s_indices):\n            if is_maximal(mult_table, s_indices):\n                # Found one, we can stop and confirm this group qualifies.\n                print(f\"Result for {group_name}: Confirmed, a maximal product-free set of size {size} exists.\")\n                return 1\n\n    print(f\"Result for {group_name}: No maximal product-free sets of size {size} were found.\")\n    return 0\n\ndef get_d_2n_table(n):\n    \"\"\"Generates the multiplication table for the Dihedral group of order 2n.\"\"\"\n    order = 2 * n\n    # Elements 0 to n-1 are rotations r^i (r^0=e is index 0)\n    # Elements n to 2n-1 are reflections s*r^i\n    table = [[0] * order for _ in range(order)]\n    for i in range(order):\n        for j in range(order):\n            is_i_rot = (i < n)\n            is_j_rot = (j < n)\n            i_val = i if is_i_rot else i - n\n            j_val = j if is_j_rot else j - n\n            \n            if is_i_rot and is_j_rot:         # rotation * rotation\n                res = (i_val + j_val) % n\n            elif is_i_rot and not is_j_rot:   # rotation * reflection\n                res = n + ((j_val - i_val + n) % n)\n            elif not is_i_rot and is_j_rot:   # reflection * rotation\n                res = n + ((i_val + j_val) % n)\n            else:                             # reflection * reflection\n                res = (j_val - i_val + n) % n\n            table[i][j] = res\n    return table\n\ndef get_a5_table():\n    \"\"\"Generates the multiplication table for the Alternating Group A5 using sympy.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\n        from sympy.combinatorics.named_groups import AlternatingGroup\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"Note: sympy is not installed.
