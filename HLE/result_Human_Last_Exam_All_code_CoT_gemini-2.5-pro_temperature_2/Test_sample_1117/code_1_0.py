    # Step 1: Define the system and reaction type.
    # The reaction is between Ce2@C80 and a disilirane derivative.
    # The disilirane is too large to enter the fullerene cage.
    # The reaction is an exohedral addition, occurring on the outer surface of the C80 cage.
    print("Step 1: The reaction is an exohedral functionalization.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the state of the cerium atoms before and after the reaction.
    # Before the reaction, the two cerium atoms are in free random motion inside the cage.

    # X-ray crystallography has shown that for Ce2@C80 reacted with this disilirane,

    # These positions are located near the six-membered rings at the poles of the elongated fullerene cage.
