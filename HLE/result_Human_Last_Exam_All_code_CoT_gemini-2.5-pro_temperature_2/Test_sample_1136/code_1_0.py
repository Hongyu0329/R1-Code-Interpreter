    Explains the concepts of Liveness and Safety in a blockchain
    and analyzes the given scenario.

1.  **Understanding Liveness and Safety:**
    *   **Liveness:** This property ensures that the system keeps making progress. For a blockchain, it means that valid transactions submitted by users will *eventually* be processed and included in a block.
    *   **Safety:** This property ensures that nothing incorrect happens. For a blockchain, it means that once a transaction is confirmed on the chain, it cannot be undone or altered (immutability), and no invalid transactions are ever confirmed.

2.  **Analyzing the Scenario:**
    *   **The Problem:** No transaction has been included for 1 day.
    *   **Impact on Liveness:** The system is clearly not making progress. Transactions are pending but not being added to the chain. This is a direct failure of the liveness property. Therefore, it is for sure that liveness is broken.
    *   **Impact on Safety:** The existing, confirmed history of the blockchain is not mentioned as being compromised. The chain hasn't been re-organized, and no confirmed transactions have been reversed. The system has simply stalled. Because the integrity of the existing ledger may still be intact, we cannot be sure that safety is broken. It might be, or it might not be.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    The most accurate statement is that liveness is definitely broken, but safety may not be. The system has failed to progress, but its historical record may still be secure.
