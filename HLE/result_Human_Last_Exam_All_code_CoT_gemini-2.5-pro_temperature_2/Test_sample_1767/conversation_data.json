    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** The Chern number is a topological invariant. For non-interacting or weakly interacting systems that are combined, the Chern number of the composite system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n2.  **Extract the given values:** We have two Chern insulators.\n    *   Chern number of the first insulator (C1) = 1.\n    *   Chern number of the second insulator (C2) = 1.\n3.  **Calculate the total Chern number:** The Chern number of the junction (C_total) will be the sum of C1 and C2.\n4.  **Generate the code:** Write a Python script to perform the addition and print the result in the format of a full equation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers for the two insulators\nc1 = 1\nc2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the calculation step by step\nprint(\"The Chern number of a junction of two Chern insulators is the sum of their individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
