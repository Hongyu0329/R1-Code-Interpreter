    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThis is a legal history question. My plan is to first identify the correct statute based on my knowledge of Israeli law. The concept of \"good faith\" was a major innovation introduced in a specific piece of legislation in the 1970s. After identifying the correct law, I will write a simple Python script to print its name, as requested, without the year or any preceding articles.\n\n```python\n# The Israeli statute that is widely recognized for explicitly introducing\n# the principle of \"good faith\" into the legal system is the\n# Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973.\n# This script will print the name of that law as requested.\n\nstatute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\nprint(statute_name)\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
