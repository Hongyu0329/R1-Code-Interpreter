def solve():
    """
    This function encapsulates the reasoning and calculation for the solution.
    
    The analysis of the graph process leads to the following conclusions:
    1. The process described simplifies to a parallel removal of all local degree minima in each step.
    2. The maximum number of steps (T) on a forest is tightly related to its maximum degree (Delta) and is bounded by O(log n). A specific tree construction (H_k) shows that T can be as high as Omega(log n).
    3. Thus, for any forest, the maximum number of steps is Theta(log n). For forests with a restricted maximum degree Delta, the number of steps is Theta(Delta).

    # Case 1: Max degree Delta <= sqrt(log n).
    # The max number of steps is f_1(n) = Theta(Delta) = Theta(sqrt(log n)).
    # We check the provided categories for f(n) = Theta(sqrt(log n)):
    # - Is it O(log^0.9 n)? Yes, since log^0.5(n) is O(log^0.9 n).
    # - Is it 2^omega(sqrt(log log n))? To check, we take logs. log(sqrt(log n)) = 0.5*log(log n).
    #   We compare 0.5*log(log n) with omega(sqrt(log log n)). Let y = log(log n).
    #   0.5*y is omega(sqrt(y)), so yes.
    # This combination matches category 6.

    # Case 2: Max degree Delta <= log n.
    # The max number of steps is f_2(n) = Theta(Delta), up to Theta(log n).
    # The H_k construction with k = Theta(log n) provides a matching lower bound.
    # Therefore, f_2(n) = Theta(log n).
    # This matches category 8.

    # Case 3: Any forest.
    # The maximum number of steps on any n-vertex forest for this process is known
    # to be O(log n). The H_k construction shows this is tight.

    # This also matches category 8.
