    # --- Introduction and Premise Analysis ---
    print("--- Premise Analysis ---")
    print("The question's premise is 'For an existentially forgeable digital signature scheme (e.g. ECDSA belongs to this family)'.")
    print("This premise is confusing because ECDSA is designed to be 'existentially UNforgeable under chosen message attack' (EU-CMA), which is the standard security goal for digital signatures.")
    print("An 'existentially forgeable' scheme is, by definition, an insecure one.")
    print("We will evaluate each statement based on standard cryptographic definitions, keeping this contradiction in mind.\n")
    
    # --- Analysis of Option A ---
    print("--- Option A Analysis ---")
    print("Statement A: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This property is known as 'strong existential unforgeability' (sEU-CMA). It means an attacker cannot produce a new signature even for a message they have already seen signed. ECDSA is designed to be sEU-CMA secure. Therefore, an adversary's success probability should indeed be negligible.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement A is TRUE.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Option B ---
    print("--- Option B Analysis ---")
    print("Statement B: 'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This is the most fundamental security guarantee of any public-key cryptosystem. The inability to compute the secret key (sk) from public information (pk, m, sig) relies on the hardness of the underlying mathematical problem (for ECDSA, this is the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem or ECDLP). If an adversary could do this, the system would be completely broken.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement B is TRUE.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Option C ---
    print("--- Option C Analysis ---")
    print("Statement C: 'For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This statement talks about schemes that are 'existentially forgeable' (i.e., insecure). By definition, such a scheme is one where an adversary can successfully forge a signature. The statement simply claims that such schemes exist. This is correct; for example, 'textbook' RSA without proper padding is vulnerable to certain forgeries.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement C is TRUE.\n")
    
    # --- Analysis of Option D ---
    print("--- Option D Analysis ---")
    print("Statement D: 'For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.'")
    print("Analysis: This property (not being able to recover the message from the signature) is not a requirement for all signature schemes. A scheme's main purpose is integrity and authenticity, not confidentiality. We can easily construct a simple (and forgeable) scheme where the signature is the message itself (sig = m), making message recovery trivial. Thus, the statement that this holds for 'all' such schemes is false.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement D is FALSE.\n")

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("We have determined that statements A, B, and C are all true.")
    print("A and B are true statements about the security of standard ECDSA.")
    print("C is a true statement about the definition of insecure ('forgeable') schemes.")
    print("Since more than one of the options A-D are true, the correct answer is E.")
