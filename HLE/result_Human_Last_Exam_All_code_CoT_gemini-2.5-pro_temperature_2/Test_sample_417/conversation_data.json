    "My thinking process to determine the number of 1H NMR peaks is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecule's Name and Structure:** The molecule is `1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene`.\n    *   **Core:** The central part is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) ring.\n    *   **Substituents:** At positions 1, 3, and 5, there are three identical, large, and chiral substituents.\n\n2.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the benzene ring. This symmetry is crucial because it makes:\n    *   The three methyl groups on the central benzene ring (at C2, C4, C6) chemically equivalent.\n    *   The three large substituents (at C1, C3, C5) chemically equivalent.\n    *   Due to this symmetry, we only need to count the unique proton signals for one-third of the molecule (one arm) plus the signals from the central core.\n\n3.  **Count Peaks for Each Unique Section (assuming fast rotation at room temperature):**\n\n    *   **Part 1: The Central Core Protons**\n        *   **Methyl groups (on C2, C4, C6):** The three methyl groups are equivalent due to C3 symmetry. They will produce a single peak.\n        *   **Contribution: 1 peak.**\n\n    *   **Part 2: Protons on a Single Substituent Arm**\n        *   We analyze one `[((...)-methyl]` arm.\n        *   **a) The Methylene (`-CH2-`) Linker:** This `CH2` group is bonded to the chiral camphor-based substituent. Protons on a carbon adjacent to a chiral center are \"diastereotopic,\" meaning they are in different chemical environments and are not equivalent.\n        *   **Contribution: 2 peaks.**\n\n        *   **b) The Chiral Camphor-Pyrazole Moiety:** This part is a rigid, bicyclic, and chiral structure. Due to its chirality and lack of internal symmetry, all protons that cannot be interchanged by simple bond rotation are chemically distinct.\n            *   **Methyl groups:** There are three methyl groups in the structure (derived from camphor's 1,7,7-trimethyl skeleton). They are all in unique environments. **Contribution: 3 peaks.**\n            *   **Pyrazole ring proton:** There is a single proton on the five-membered pyrazole ring. **Contribution: 1 peak.**\n            *   **Bicyclic framework protons:**\n                *   There is one proton at a bridgehead position (a `CH` group). **Contribution: 1 peak.**\n                *   There are two methylene (`CH2`) groups in the saturated framework. For each `CH2` group, the two protons (often labeled `endo` and `exo`) are diastereotopic. Thus, the two `CH2` groups give rise to a total of 2 * 2 = 4 unique proton signals. **Contribution: 4 peaks.**\n            *   **Total for the chiral moiety:** 3 (methyls) + 1 (pyrazole H) + 1 (bridgehead CH) + 4 (framework CH2s) = **9 peaks.**\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Peaks:**\n    *   Summing the contributions from all parts:\n    *   Total Peaks = (Core Methyls) + (Linker CH2) + (Chiral Moiety)\n    *   Total Peaks = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\nI will now create a Python script that walks through this logic and prints the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the molecule\n    1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n    by analyzing its structure and symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step determination of the number of 1H NMR peaks:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # 1.
