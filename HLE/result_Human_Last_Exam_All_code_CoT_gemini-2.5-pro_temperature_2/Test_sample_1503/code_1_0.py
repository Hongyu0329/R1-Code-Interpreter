A critical point must satisfy J'(u, v) = 0, which is a partial differential equation. Satisfying a single integral identity does not guarantee solving the full PDE.")

# Rechecking the derivative of J(u_t). J = K/2 - V. So d/dt(-V_t) = - dV_t/dt.
# My phi calculation was J(u_t)=1/2 K_t - V_t. Derivative is 1/2 dK_t/dt - dV_t/dt.
# dV_t/dt = V * (-(s+1)/s) * t**(-(2s+1)/s). So derivative is -(-(...)) = +... Correct.
