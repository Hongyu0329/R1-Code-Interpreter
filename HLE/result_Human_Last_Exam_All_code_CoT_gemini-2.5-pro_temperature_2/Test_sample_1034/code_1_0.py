# The problem states S = SNYWR. This is a placeholder for a specific number.
# We will use S = 589 as an example. You can change this value as needed.
S = 589

# In triangle ABC, we are given BC = S and m∠B = 30°.
# We need to find the number of integer values of AC for which there are two possible triangles.
# This corresponds to the ambiguous case (SSA) in trigonometry.

# For two triangles to exist, the length of side AC must be greater than the
# altitude from C to side AB, and less than the length of side BC.
# Altitude h = BC * sin(B) = S * sin(30°) = S * 0.5.
# The condition is: S/2 < AC < S.

# We need to find the number of integers in the interval (S/2, S).
# For S = 589, this interval is (294.5, 589).

# The smallest integer in this interval is floor(S/2) + 1.
# Using integer division, floor(S/2) is S // 2.
min_ac_val = S // 2 + 1

# The largest integer in this interval is S - 1.
max_ac_val = S - 1

# The total number of integer values is (max_ac_val - min_ac_val + 1).
count = max_ac_val - min_ac_val + 1

# Print the final result including the numbers in the equation.
