    Solves a topology problem about the number of components of a set.

    Problem Statement:
    Let X be a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c,
    A a connected subset of X, and C a component of X \setminus A.
    What is the largest number of components X \setminus C can have?

    """

    # Step 1: Deconstruct the space X \ C
    # We are looking for the number of components of the set X \ C.
    # The space X can be partitioned into three disjoint sets:
    # A, C, and B = (X \ A) \ C.
    # Therefore, X \ C = A U B.
    # A is a connected set by the problem's premise.
    # B is a union of some components of X \ A.
    explanation = [
        "Let the set we are analyzing be S = X \\ C.",
        "We can express S as the union of two disjoint sets: S = A U B, where B = (X \\ A) \\ C.",
        "A is given to be connected.",
        "B is the union of all components of X \\ A, except for C."
    ]

    # Step 2: Use the Boundary Bumping Theorem.
    # A key theorem states that if K is a component of a subset Y of a connected space X,
    # then the closure of K must intersect the boundary of Y in X.
    # Here, Y = X \ A. Any component K of Y must satisfy cl(K) intersect boundary(Y) != empty.
    # boundary(X \ A) = cl(X \ A) intersect cl(A).
    # Thus, for any component K of X \ A, we have cl(K) intersect cl(A) != empty.
    # This applies to C, and also to every component that makes up B.
    explanation.extend([
        "\nA key theorem in topology implies that the closure of any component of X \\ A must intersect the closure of A.",
        "This means cl(K) intersects cl(A) for every component K in B."
    ])

    # Step 3: Group the components of X \ C.
    # The components of S = A U B are formed by A and the components of B.
    # Let K_A be the component of S that contains A.
    # Any component of B that is not separated from A will be part of K_A.
    # A component K from B might be separated from A. This means cl(A) does not intersect K, and A does not intersect cl(K).
    # All such separated components form their own components in S.
    explanation.extend([
        "\nLet K_A be the component of X \\ C containing A. Any component of B not separated from A belongs to K_A.",
        "It is possible to construct a space where a component of B is separated from A, forming a new component in X \\ C."
    ])


    # Step 4: State the concluding theorem.
    # A non-trivial theorem in topology (a generalized Two-Component Theorem) states that all the parts of B that are
    # separated from A must, in fact, form a single connected component.
    # Intuitively, if there were two such components, K_2 and K_3, then C could not "bridge" the separation
    # between K_A, K_2, and K_3 simultaneously to make the whole space X connected.
    # This leads to a maximum of two components for X \ C:
    # 1. The component containing A.
    # 2. At most one other component.
    explanation.extend([
        "\nA powerful theorem shows that all components of B that are separated from A must together form a single connected component.",
        "This means that X \\ C can have at most two components:"
    ])

        "Component 1": "The component containing A (and everything in B connected to it).",
        "Component 2": "A potential second component formed by all parts of B that are separated from A."
