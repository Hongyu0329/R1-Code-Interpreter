    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation followed by the Python code to display the result.\n\n### Plan\nMy plan is to first outline the theoretical steps to derive the inner product `(φ, D_φ)` for a neutral scalar field in finite-temperature field theory. I will start from the functional integral representation of the partition function and the corresponding Euclidean action. By rewriting the action in a quadratic form, `S[φ] = (1/2) ∫ d⁴x φ D φ`, I will identify the operator `D`. Then, I will apply the standard definition of the inner product in this context, which is `(f, g) = ∫ d⁴x f(x)g(x)`, and simplify the resulting expression using integration by parts.\n\nThe final Python script will not perform a numerical calculation but will instead symbolically construct and print the derived mathematical expression, following these steps. This ensures the output is the clear, theoretical result you're looking for, with all coefficients explicitly stated as requested.\n\n### Theoretical Steps\n\n1.  **Partition Function and Euclidean Action:** In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function `Z` is given by a functional integral over the field `φ` which is periodic in imaginary time `τ` with period `β=1/T`:\n    `Z = ∫ Dφ exp(-S[φ])`\n    The Euclidean action `S[φ]` for a free, neutral scalar field with mass `m` is:\n    `S[φ] = ∫ dτ d³x L_E = ∫ dτ d³x (1/2)[(∂φ/∂τ)² + (∇φ)² + m²φ²]`\n\n2.  **Identifying the Operator D:** We want to express the action in the form `S[φ] = (1/2)(φ, Dφ)`, where the inner product `(f,g)` is `∫ d⁴x f g`. Using integration by parts on the derivative terms (and assuming boundary terms vanish), we can rewrite the action as:\n    `S[φ] = (1/2) ∫ d⁴x φ [(-∂²/∂τ² - ∇²) + m²] φ`\n    From this, we can identify the operator `D` as `D = -∂²/∂τ² - ∇² + m²`.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Inner Product (φ, D_φ):** Using the definition of the inner product:\n    `(φ, D_φ) = ∫ d⁴x φ(x) [Dφ](x) = ∫ d⁴x φ [(-∂²/∂τ² - ∇²) + m²] φ`\n\n4.  **Simplification:** We can simplify this expression again using integration by parts. The term `-∫ φ (∂²/∂τ² + ∇²) φ` becomes `∫ [(∂φ/∂τ)² + (∇φ)²] d⁴x`. This gives the final result for the inner product.\n\nHere is the Python code that prints this derivation and the final expression.\n\n```python\ndef solve_inner_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the inner product (φ, D_φ)\n    in finite-temperature scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Define symbolic representations as strings for clarity ---\n    phi = \"φ\"\n    d_phi_d_tau = f\"(∂{phi}/∂τ)\"\n    grad_phi = f\"(∇{phi})\"\n    m = \"m\"\n\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"In finite-temperature field theory, the Euclidean action S[φ] for a neutral scalar field φ is:\")\n    print(f\"S[φ] = (1/2) ∫ dτ d³x [ {d_phi_d_tau}² + {grad_phi}² + {m}²{phi}² ]\")\n    print(\"\\nThis action can be expressed in the quadratic form S[φ] = (1/2)(φ, Dφ), where D is an operator.\")\n    print(\"By using integration by parts, the operator D is found to be:\")\n    print(f\"D = -∂²/∂τ² - ∇² + {m}²\")\n    \n    # --- The Inner Product Calculation ---\n    print(\"\\nThe inner product (φ, Dφ) is defined as ∫ d⁴x φ(Dφ).\")\n    print(f\"(φ, Dφ) = ∫ dτ d³x {phi} [ (-∂²/∂τ² - ∇² + {m}²) {phi} ]\")\n    \n    # --- Simplification and Final Result ---\n    print(\"\\nUsing integration by parts again (and dropping boundary terms), this simplifies.\")\n    print(\"The term with second derivatives becomes a term with first derivatives squared:\")\n    print(f\"∫ dτ d³x [-{phi}(∂²/∂τ²){phi}] = ∫ dτ d³x {d_phi_d_tau}²\")\n    print(f\"∫ dτ d³x [-{phi}(∇²){phi}] = ∫ dτ d³x {grad_phi}²\")\n\n    # Construct the final equation with explicit numerical coefficients as requested\n    term1 = f\"1 * {d_phi_d_tau}²\"\n    term2 = f\"1 * {grad_phi}²\"\n    term3 = f\"1 * {m}²{phi}²\"\n    final_equation = f\"(φ, Dφ) = ∫ dτ d³x [ {term1} + {term2} + {term3} ]\"\n\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the final expression for the inner product is:\")\n    print(final_equation)\n    print(\"\\nNote: This is equal to 2 * S[φ].\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution\nsolve_inner_product()\n\n```\n<<<∫ dτ d³x [ (∂φ/∂τ)² + (∇φ)² + m²φ² ]>>>"
