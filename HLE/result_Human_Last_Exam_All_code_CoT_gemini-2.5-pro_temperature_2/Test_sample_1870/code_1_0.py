    This function explains the solution to the set theory problem.
    
    The problem asks for the minimal ordinal δ (delta) for a tower of uncountable
    subsets of ω_1 (omega-1). This is a question from set theory, a branch of
    mathematical logic. The objects ω_1 and δ are transfinite cardinal numbers,
    not standard numbers that can be computed with directly in Python.
    
    - ω_1 is the first uncountable cardinal, which is the set of all countable ordinals.
    - The problem defines a structure and asks for its minimal possible length, δ.
    - This minimal length is equivalent to a cardinal characteristic known as the
      "tower number for ω_1", denoted t(ω_1).
      
    Through set-theoretic arguments, we can establish the value of this cardinal:
    
    1. δ must be greater than ω (the first infinite cardinal, representing countable
       infinity). This is proven by a diagonalization argument that leverages the fact
       that ω_1 is a regular cardinal. A tower of countable length can always be
       shown to have a "lower bound", which violates the tower definition.
       
    2. δ must also be greater than ω_1. This is a deeper theorem in Zermelo-Fraenkel
       set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), which states that for any regular
       uncountable cardinal κ, the tower number t(κ) is strictly greater than κ.
       In our case, κ = ω_1, so we have t(ω_1) > ω_1.
       
    Combining these facts, δ must be a cardinal number strictly greater than ω_1.
    The smallest cardinal number greater than ω_1 is its successor cardinal, which is
    denoted by ω_2 (omega-2).
    
    Since it is known to be consistent with ZFC that such a tower of length ω_2 exists,
    the minimal possible value for δ is indeed ω_2.
