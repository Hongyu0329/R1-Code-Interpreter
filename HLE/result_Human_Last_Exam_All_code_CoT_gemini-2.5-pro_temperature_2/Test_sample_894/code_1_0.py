    Identifies and prints the letters of San Francisco propositions from the
    November 2024 election that could be nullified by a competing proposition.

    The conflicting pairs are:
    - B and C
    - D and E
    - K and L
    - M and N

    In each pair, if both propositions pass, the one with fewer 'yes' votes
    is nullified. Therefore, all of these are candidates for nullification.
