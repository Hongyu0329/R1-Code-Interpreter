    "To find the missing intermediate step in the elementary cellular automaton sequence, we first need to determine the specific rule (out of 256 possibilities) that governs the evolution of the cells. The same rule must correctly transform the initial state to the intermediate state, and then the intermediate state to the final state.\n\nMy plan is to perform a brute-force search over all 256 possible rules. For each rule, I will:\n1.  Define the initial state `01101001` and the target final state `10000111`.\n2.  Simulate the first step of the automaton by applying the current rule to the initial state to generate a candidate for the intermediate step. I'll use periodic boundary conditions, where the grid wraps around.\n3.  Simulate the second step by applying the same rule to this candidate intermediate state.\n4.  Compare the result of the second step with the target final state `10000111`.\n5.  If they match, I have found the correct rule and the unique intermediate state as implied by the problem.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_automaton_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 1D elementary cellular automaton evolution\n    by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    initial_state = \"01101001\"\n    target_final_state = \"10000111\"\n\n    def apply_rule(rule_num, gen_str):\n        \"\"\"\n        Applies a given ECA rule to a generation string to produce the next generation.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Per Wolfram convention, rule bits correspond to neighborhood integer values.\n        # We reverse the binary string so rule_bits[0] corresponds to '000', etc.\n        rule_bits = [int(c) for c in reversed(format(rule_num, '08b'))]\n        \n        gen_int = [int(c) for c in gen_str]\n        n = len(gen_int)\n        next_gen_int = [0] * n\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get neighborhood values with periodic (wraparound) boundary conditions.\n            left_val = gen_int[(i - 1 + n) % n]\n            center_val = gen_int[i]\n            right_val = gen_int[(i + 1) % n]\n            \n            # The neighborhood's integer value (0-7) is the index for the rule bit.\n            neighborhood_index = 4 * left_val + 2 * center_val + 1 * right_val\n            next_gen_int[i] = rule_bits[neighborhood_index]\n            \n        return \"\".join(map(str, next_gen_int))\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible rules.\n    solutions_found = []\n    for rule in range(256):\n        intermediate_state = apply_rule(rule, initial_state)\n        final_state = apply_rule(rule, intermediate_state)\n        \n        if final_state == target_final_state:\n            # A valid solution is found.\n            solutions_found.append(intermediate_state)\n            \n    # As per the prompt, a unique solution is expected.\n    if len(solutions_found) == 1:\n        the_solution = solutions_found[0]\n        # Print the full evolution sequence as requested.\n        print(\"The only valid solution follows the equation:\")\n        print(f\"{initial_state} -> {the_solution} -> {target_final_state}\")\n    elif len(solutions_found) == 0:\n        print(\"No valid solution was found.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Found {len(solutions_found)} solutions, expected only one:\")\n        for sol in solutions_found:\n            print(sol)\n\n# Execute the solver function.\nsolve_automaton_puzzle()\n```\n<<<01010100>>>"
