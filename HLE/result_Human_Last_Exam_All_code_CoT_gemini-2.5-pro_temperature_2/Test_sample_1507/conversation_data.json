    "To determine the number of triangles for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron, let's break down the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Object:** The object is the \"great icosahedron,\" a non-convex regular polyhedron.\n2.  **Identify the Surface:** The question asks about its \"outer-hull.\" The outer-hull, or more formally, the convex hull of a great icosahedron is a standard **regular icosahedron**.\n3.  **Triangulation:** The task is to find the minimal number of triangles needed to \"triangulate\" this surface. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose surface is already composed entirely of equilateral triangles.\n4.  **Count the Faces:** A regular icosahedron has 20 faces, and all of them are triangles. Therefore, the surface is already perfectly triangulated by its own faces.\n\nThe minimal number of triangles required is simply the number of faces of a regular icosahedron, which is 20. The great icosahedron itself also has 20 (intersecting) triangular faces.\n\nThe following Python code will print this result.\n\n```python\n# The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. Its convex hull (or \"outer-hull\")\n# is a regular icosahedron.\n# A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid made up of 20 identical equilateral triangles.\n# Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed to form its surface is its number of faces.\n\n# Number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\nnum_triangles = 20\n\n# The problem asks for the minimal number of triangles needed for the triangulation.\n# The equation is simply stating this number.\nprint(\"The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(f\"A regular icosahedron is composed of {num_triangles} triangular faces.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed is {num_triangles}.\")\n\n```\n<<<20>>>"
