    """
    Determines and prints the IUPAC name of the product from the described reaction.

    The reaction involves 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide
    under reflux. The reaction proceeds through a series of benzyne intermediates,
    leading to an exhaustive phenylation of the starting material.

    The sequence is as follows:
    1.  Initial coupling replaces iodine with phenyl -> 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.
    2.  HBr elimination via a benzyne mechanism leads to -> 1-bromo-2,4-diphenylbenzene.
    3.  A second HBr elimination via a benzyne mechanism leads to the final product.
    4.  The substitution pattern rearranges to give the symmetrical product: 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene.
