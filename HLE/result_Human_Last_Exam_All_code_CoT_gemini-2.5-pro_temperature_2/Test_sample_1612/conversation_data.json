    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\n1.  First, I will create a list of the names of all the unique players who have won the MLB Triple Crown for batting.\n2.  Next, I will use Python to count the number of items in this list. This count represents the total number of Triple Crown winners.\n3.  Finally, to satisfy the request to show the \"equation\", I will print an addition equation that adds '1' for each player, summing to the final total. I will then print the final count.\n\n```python\ndef count_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function lists the MLB Triple Crown winners,\n    constructs an equation to count them, and prints the total.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of unique players who have won the MLB Triple Crown.\n    # Note: Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won twice, but are counted as one winner each.\n    winners = [\n        \"Paul Hines\",\n        \"Tip O'Neill\",\n        \"Hugh Duffy\",\n        \"Nap Lajoie\",\n        \"Ty Cobb\",\n        \"Heinie Zimmerman\",\n        \"Rogers Hornsby\",\n        \"Chuck Klein\",\n        \"Jimmie Foxx\",\n        \"Lou Gehrig\",\n        \"Joe Medwick\",\n        \"Ted Williams\",\n        \"Mickey Mantle\",\n        \"Frank Robinson\",\n        \"Carl Yastrzemski\",\n        \"Miguel Cabrera\"\n    ]\n\n    # The total number of winners is the length of the list.\n    total_winners = len(winners)\n\n    # Create a string representing the equation 1 + 1 + ... = total\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(['1'] * total_winners)\n\n    print(\"The equation for counting the number of MLB Triple Crown winners is based on adding 1 for each unique player:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total_winners}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThere are {total_winners} MLB Triple Crown winners.\")\n\n# Run the function\ncount_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<16>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
