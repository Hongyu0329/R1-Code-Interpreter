    "To find the number of real intersection points for the two given plane quadrics, we need to solve the system of two polynomial equations:\n1. $164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n2. $864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\nA systematic way to solve this is to eliminate one variable, say $y$, to obtain a single polynomial in $x$. The roots of this polynomial will give us the x-coordinates of the intersection points. The resultant is a standard tool for this elimination.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  Define the two equations as polynomials in $x$ and $y$.\n2.  Treat them as polynomials in $y$, where the coefficients are polynomials in $x$.\n3.  Compute the resultant of these two polynomials with respect to $y$. This gives a single polynomial in $x$.\n4.  The degree of the resulting polynomial will be at most 4 (since we are intersecting two conics).\n5.  Find the real roots of this resultant polynomial. The number of distinct real roots corresponds to the number of real intersection points. We will use a numerical method to find the roots reliably.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef count_real_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of real intersection points between two quadrics.\n    \n    The equations are:\n    Q1: 164*x**2 - 216*x*y + 72*y**2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\n    Q2: 864*x**2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y**2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define symbolic variables\n    x, y = sympy.symbols('x y')\n    \n    # Define the two quadric equations\n    q1_expr = 164*x**2 - 216*x*y + 72*y**2 - 16*x + 31\n    q2_expr = 864*x**2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y**2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149\n    \n    # Treat the expressions as polynomials in y\n    p1 = sympy.Poly(q1_expr, y)\n    p2 = sympy.Poly(q2_expr, y)\n    \n    # Compute the resultant with respect to y to eliminate it.\n    # The resultant is a polynomial in x whose roots are the x-coordinates\n    # of the intersection points.\n    resultant_poly = sympy.resultant(p1, p2)\n    \n    # Get the coefficients of the resultant polynomial\n    coeffs = sympy.Poly(resultant_poly, x).all_coeffs()\n    \n    # Convert sympy coefficients to floating point numbers for numerical root finding\n    coeffs_float = [float(c) for c in coeffs]\n    \n    # Find all roots (real and complex) using numpy\n    roots = np.roots(coeffs_float)\n    \n    # Count the number of roots that are real (i.e., imaginary part is close to zero)\n    real_roots_count = 0\n    for root in roots:\n        if abs(root.imag) < 1e-9:  # A small tolerance for floating point errors\n            real_roots_count += 1\n            \n    # Each real root for x corresponds to a real intersection point.\n    print(real_roots_count)\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the number of real intersections\ncount_real_intersections()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
