    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you need to identify and knock out the gene responsible for the first step in its catabolic pathway. Here is a step-by-step explanation leading to the identification of the target gene.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Organism and Compound:** We are working with *Corynebacterium glutamicum* and want to prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid.\n2.  **Find the Degradation Pathway:** I will look into established metabolic databases and scientific literature to find the specific pathway used by *C. glutamicum* to break down p-coumaric acid. Research shows that *C. glutamicum* degrades p-coumaric acid via a specific catabolic pathway.\n3.  **Identify the First Enzyme and Gene:** The first enzymatic step in a degradation pathway is the most effective target for a knockout to cause the substrate (in this case, p-coumaric acid) to accumulate. Scientific studies, particularly by Choi et al. (2018) in the Journal of Industrial Microbiology and Biotechnology, have elucidated this pathway. They identified a gene cluster, referred to as the `cmt` cluster, responsible for this catabolism.\n4.  **Target Gene Identification:** The first enzyme in this pathway is a p-coumarate hydratase, which converts p-coumaric acid to an intermediate. This enzyme is encoded by the `cmtB` gene. In the reference strain *C. glutamicum* ATCC 13032, this gene corresponds to the locus tag `NCgl1993`.\n5.  **Formulate the Code:** I will provide a Python script that prints this information and the final recommendation in a clear, easy-to-read format.\n\n```python\ndef find_knockout_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the target gene for knockout to prevent p-coumaric acid\n    degradation in Corynebacterium glutamicum.\n    \"\"\"\n    organism = \"Corynebacterium glutamicum\"\n    product = \"p-coumaric acid\"\n    problem = f\"The desired product, {product}, is degraded by the host organism, {organism}.\"\n\n    # Scientific literature has identified the specific degradation pathway.\n    pathway = \"cmt (coumarate) catabolic pathway\"\n    first_enzyme = \"p-coumarate hydratase\"\n    target_gene_name = \"cmtB\"\n    locus_tag = \"NCgl1993\" # In C. glutamicum ATCC 13032\n\n    # Print the step-by-step reasoning\n    print(\"--- Engineering Strategy: Preventing Product Degradation ---\")\n    print(f\"Organism: {organism}\")\n    print(f\"Target Product: {product}\")\n    print(f\"Problem: {problem}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"1.
