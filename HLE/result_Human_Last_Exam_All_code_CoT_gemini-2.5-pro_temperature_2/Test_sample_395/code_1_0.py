def solve_set_union_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the smallest possible value of the union of 2024 sets
    based on the given conditions.

    The problem states:
    For i in {1, ..., 2024}, let A_i be 2024 sets such that:
    - The number of sets, n = 2024
    - The size of each set, |A_i| = k = 45
    - For every i != j, |A_i intersect A_j| = 1

    The reasoning shows that there must be exactly one element common to all 2024 sets.
    Let this element be p_0.
    Then, A_i intersect A_j = {p_0} for all i != j.
    This means the other 44 elements in each set A_i must be unique to that set.
    Let A_i = {p_0} U B_i, where |B_i| = 44 and B_i are pairwise disjoint.

    The size of the union is the sum of the size of the central element
    and the sizes of all the unique surrounding elements.
    |Union(A_i)| = 1 + sum(|B_i|) for i=1 to n
                   = 1 + n * (|A_i| - 1)
                   = 1 + 2024 * (45 - 1)
    """
    n = 2024
    k = 45

    # As derived in the explanation, the structure of the sets is fixed.
    # There is one central element, and each set brings in k-1 unique new elements.
    k_minus_1 = k - 1
    result = 1 + n * k_minus_1

    print(f"The analysis shows there's a unique structure for the sets, leading to a single possible value for the union size.")
    print(f"The value is calculated by the formula: 1 + n * (k - 1)")
    print(f"Substituting the values n=2024 and k=45:")
    print(f"1 + {n} * ({k} - 1) = 1 + {n} * {k_minus_1} = {result}")
