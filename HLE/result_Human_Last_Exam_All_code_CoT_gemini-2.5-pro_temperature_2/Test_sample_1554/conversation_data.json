    "This is a knowledge-based question rather than a computational one. I will find the correct philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made this distinction. Then, to adhere to the requested format, I will present this information using a Python script.\n\nThe plan is to:\n1.  Identify the specific philosopher who analyzed the concept of a \"hallmark\" (or sign) by dividing it into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n2.  Create a Python script that stores the philosopher's name and the related concepts in variables.\n3.  Use the `print()` function to display the components and the final answer as a complete sentence. This will fulfill the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\" by treating the key terms as the components.\n\n```python\ndef solve_philosophy_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School\n    who decomposed the notion of hallmark into symptoms and signals.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The philosopher who made this distinction.\n    philosopher = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n\n    # The concepts involved in the decomposition.\n    central_notion = \"hallmark\"\n    component1 = \"symptoms\"\n    component2 = \"signals\"\n\n    print(\"The question asks to identify a specific philosopher and their conceptual decomposition.\")\n    print(\"Here are the components of the answer:\")\n    print(f\"Philosopher: {philosopher}\")\n    print(f\"Central Notion: {central_notion}\")\n    print(f\"Decomposition Part 1: {component1}\")\n    print(f\"Decomposition Part 2: {component2}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n    # Printing the final statement as requested.\n    print(f\"The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher {philosopher} decomposes the notion of '{central_notion}' into '{component1}' and '{component2}'.\")\n\nsolve_philosophy_question()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
