    Calculates the smallest complexity of a matrix product for f_n,d.
    
    The problem asks for the complexity for a given pair of integers n and d,
    where 2 <= d <= n and d is odd. We provide an example case where n=8 and d=5.
    You can change these values in your own execution environment.

    Args:
        n (int): The number of available indices.
        d (int): The number of variables in each monomial, must be odd.

    Returns:
        int: The calculated complexity.
