    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the differential equation.\n\n**1. Analyze the Equation and Choose a Substitution:**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a non-linear first-order ODE. It's complex, but we can notice the presence of terms like $y^2$ and $y\\frac{dy}{dx}$. This suggests a substitution to simplify the equation. Let's use the substitution $u = y^2$.\n\n**2. Perform the Substitution:**\nIf we let $u = y^2$, then by differentiating with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\nFrom this, we can express the terms involving derivatives of $y$ in terms of $u$ and its derivative:\n*   $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$\n*   $\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4y^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4u}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2$\nSo, the term $y^2\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2$ becomes $y^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4y^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2$.\n\nSubstituting these into the original equation:\n$x^2 u = x^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + x\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + 9x^2$\n\n**3. Simplify and Identify the Type of the New ODE:**\nLet's rearrange the equation to a more standard form. First, multiply by 4 to clear the denominators:\n$4x^2 u = 2x^3 \\frac{du}{dx} + \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x \\frac{du}{dx} + 36x^2$\n\nNow, group the terms:\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + (2x^3 + 2x)\\frac{du}{dx} + (36x^2 - 4x^2 u) = 0$\nThis is an equation of the form $p^2 + f(x)p + g(x,u) = 0$, where $p = \\frac{du}{dx}$. This is a type of equation known as a Lagrange differential equation.\n\n**4. Solve the Lagrange Equation:**\nTo solve this, we first express $u$ in terms of $x$ and $p = \\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$4x^2 u = p^2 + 2x(x^2+1)p + 36x^2$\n$u = \\frac{p^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2x^2}p + 9$\n$u = \\frac{p^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}p + 9$\n\nNow, we differentiate this equation with respect to $x$. Remember that $\\frac{du}{dx} = p$.\n$p = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{p^2}{4x^2}\\right) + \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{x^2+1}{2x}p\\right) + \\frac{d}{dx}(9)$\nAfter applying the product and quotient rules and simplifying, this differentiation leads to the following factored equation:\n$(p + x^3 + x)(p - x\\frac{dp}{dx}) = 0$\n\nThis gives two cases:\n*   **Case 1: $p + x^3 + x = 0$**. This leads to the singular solution, which is not the general solution.\n*   **Case 2: $p - x\\frac{dp}{dx} = 0$**. This will give us the general solution.\n\n**5. Find the General Solution:**\nFrom Case 2, we have a separable equation for $p$:\n$p = x\\frac{dp}{dx} \\implies \\frac{dp}{p} = \\frac{dx}{x}$\nIntegrating both sides gives $\\ln|p| = \\ln|x| + \\ln|c_1|$, which simplifies to $p = c_1x$, where $c_1$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $p$ back into the equation for $u$:\n$u = \\frac{(c_1x)^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x}(c_1x) + 9$\n$u = \\frac{c_1^2 x^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{c_1(x^2+1)}{2} + 9$\n$u = \\frac{c_1^2}{4} + \\frac{c_1}{2}(x^2+1) + 9$\n\nFor a cleaner form, let's define a new arbitrary constant $C = c_1/2$. This means $c_1 = 2C$.\n$u = \\frac{(2C)^2}{4} + \\frac{2C}{2}(x^2+1) + 9$\n$u = C^2 + C(x^2+1) + 9$\n\n**6. Substitute Back to the Original Variable:**\nFinally, we substitute back $u = y^2$ to get the general solution:\n$y^2 = C(x^2+1) + C^2 + 9$\n\nThis equation represents the family of functions that are the general solution to the original differential equation, with $C$ being an arbitrary constant.\n\n```python\n# The final equation is y^2 = C*(x^2 + 1) + C^2 + 9, where C is an arbitrary constant.\n# This code prints the solution and the specific numbers present in its final form.\n\nprint(\"The general solution to the differential equation is expressed by the equation:\")\nprint(\"y^2 = C*(x^2 + 1) + C^2 + 9\")\nprint(\"In this equation, 'C' represents an arbitrary constant.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe fixed numeric values that appear in this final equation are:\")\n# These are the numbers from y^2, x^2, x^2+1, and +9\nprint(2)\nprint(1)\nprint(9)\n\n```\n<<<y^2 = C(x^2+1) + C^2 + 9>>>"
