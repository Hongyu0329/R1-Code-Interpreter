    This function identifies the incorrect or inappropriate explanations for the described trends in Japanese higher education.

    A. The decrease in the 18-year-old population was smaller than predicted: This is factually incorrect. The decline has been sharp and well-documented.
    B. Increase in university enrollment rate: This is correct. The enrollment rate has significantly increased, offsetting the population decline.
    C. Increased demand for re-learning by working adults: This is a minor factor and not a primary driver for the large-scale trend.
    D. Diversification of higher education: This is incorrect. The role of two-year and specialized colleges is not primarily as feeder schools, and their popularity has generally declined in favor of 4-year universities.
    E. Government policies: This is correct. Deregulation and subsidies led to an increase in the number of universities.

    The most incorrect or inappropriate options are A and D.
    The final answer should be these options in alphabetical order, separated by a comma.
