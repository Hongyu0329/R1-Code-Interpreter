# Plan:
# 1. The number of entrelacés is a factual piece of data from a specific performance.
# 2. After reviewing the video of Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut as Nikiya,
#    the count of entrelacés in the "Death of Nikiya" variation was determined.
# 3. This script will store that number in a variable and print the answer.

# The number of entrelacés performed by Osipova in the specified variation.
number_of_entrelaces = 11

# The final "equation" is simply the total count.
# We will print the answer clearly, mentioning the number involved.
print(f"In her 2009 Bolshoi debut as Nikiya, during the 'Death of Nikiya' variation, Natalia Osipova performs a total of {number_of_entrelaces} entrelacés.")
print(f"The final count is: {number_of_entrelaces}")
