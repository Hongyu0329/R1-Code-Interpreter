    "To find the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the method of elementary row operations, which is analogous to the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Form a stacked matrix**: Create a 4x2 matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`.\n    ```\n    M = [ P1 ]\n        [ P2 ]\n    ```\n2.  **Perform elementary row operations**: The goal is to transform `M` into an upper trapezoidal form by introducing as many zero rows as possible at the bottom. The allowed elementary row operations are:\n    a. Swapping any two rows.\n    b. Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    c. Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n    These operations are equivalent to left-multiplying the matrix `M` by a unimodular matrix.\n\n3.  **Extract the GCRD**: After the row reduction process, the remaining non-zero rows of the transformed matrix form the GCRD, let's call it `G(s)`.\n\n4.  **Normalize the result**: The GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant). The common practice is to present the GCRD in a simple, canonical form, such as the identity matrix `I` if the original matrices are right coprime.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this procedure using the `sympy` library for symbolic calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices\n    P1 and P2 using the elementary row operations method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sp.symbols('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sp.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sp.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"Original Matrix P1:\")\n    sp.pretty_print(P1)\n    print(\"\\nOriginal Matrix P2:\")\n    sp.pretty_print(P2)\n\n    # Step 1: Form the stacked matrix M\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n    print(\"\\nInitial stacked matrix M:\")\n    sp.pretty_print(M)\n    \n    # Step 2: Perform elementary row operations\n    \n    # Let the rows of M be R0, R1, R2, R3\n    # M = [ R0 ]\n    #     [ R1 ]\n    #     [ R2 ]\n    #     [ R3 ]\n    \n    # Reduce rows with the highest degree (deg=2) using rows with lower degree (deg=1)\n    # R0_new = R0 - (s+1)*R2\n    M[0, :] = M.row(0) - (s + 1) * M.row(2)\n    # R1_new = R1 + s*R2\n    M[1, :] = M.row(1) + s * M.row(2)\n    print(\"\\nAfter first reduction step (reducing degrees of top rows):\")\n    sp.pretty_print(M)\n    # M is now:\n    # [[   0,   -s],\n    #  [  -1,  s**2],\n    #  [   s,     0],\n    #  [-s-1,     1]]\n\n    # Reduce the new R1 (now at index 1), which has the highest degree (2).\n    # R1_new = R1 + s * R0\n    M[1, :] = M.row(1) + s * M.row(0)\n    print(\"\\nAfter second reduction step (reducing row 1):\")\n    sp.pretty_print(M)\n    # M is now:\n    # [[   0, -s],\n    #  [  -1,  0],\n    #  [   s,  0],\n    #  [-s-1,  1]]\n\n    # Reduce rows 2 and 3 using the new row 1 (at index 1), which is now degree 0.\n    # R2_new = R2 + s * R1\n    M[2, :] = M.row(2) + s * M.row(1)\n    # R3_new = R3 - (s+1) * R1\n    M[3, :] = M.row(3) - (s + 1) * M.row(1)\n    print(\"\\nAfter third reduction step (reducing rows 2 and 3):\")\n    sp.pretty_print(M)\n    # M is now:\n    # [[ 0, -s],\n    #  [-1,  0],\n    #  [ 0,  0],\n    #  [ 0,  1]]\n\n    # Reduce row 0 using the new row 3.\n    # R0_new = R0 + s * R3\n    M[0, :] = M.row(0) + s * M.row(3)\n    print(\"\\nAfter final reduction step (reducing row 0):\")\n    sp.pretty_print(M)\n    # M is now:\n    # [[0,  0],\n    #  [-1, 0],\n    #  [0,  0],\n    #  [0,  1]]\n\n    # Step 3: Extract the GCRD\n    # The non-zero rows form the GCRD.\n    # The non-zero rows are [-1, 0] and [0, 1].\n    G_unnormalized = sp.Matrix([M.row(1), M.row(3)])\n    \n    # Step 4: Normalize the result\n    # We can multiply rows by -1 to make the diagonal elements positive (monic).\n    G_unnormalized[0,:] = -1 * G_unnormalized.row(0)\n    G = sp.Matrix([G_unnormalized.row(0), G_unnormalized.row(1)])\n\n    # Rearranging for canonical form I\n    if G.row(0) == sp.Matrix([[1,0]]) and G.row(1) == sp.Matrix([[0,1]]):\n        GCRD = sp.Matrix([[1, 0], [0, 1]])\n    else: # This case is for ordering rows if needed, but here it's already correct.\n        GCRD = G\n\n    print(\"\\nThe GCRD matrix G(s) is:\")\n    sp.pretty_print(GCRD)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe determinant of the GCRD is:\", GCRD.det())\n    print(\"Since the determinant is a non-zero constant, the matrices P1 and P2 are right coprime.\")\n    \n    # As requested, output each number in the final equation for the GCRD matrix\n    print(\"\\nFinal equation for the GCRD matrix:\")\n    for i in range(GCRD.rows):\n        for j in range(GCRD.cols):\n            print(f\"G[{i},{j}] = {GCRD[i,j]}\")\n            \n    return GCRD\n\nG = solve_gcrd()\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>\n```"
