# The purpose of this code is to print the step-by-step reasoning that leads to the correct answer.

print("Based on the problem description, we can deduce the following:")

print("\n1. Analyze the 'no cycles with non-zero sum' condition:")
print("   - A cycle in the graph corresponds to a vector 'z' in the kernel (null space) of the incidence matrix B1, so that B1 @ z = 0.")
print("   - The 'sum over a cycle' for an edge signal x1 is the dot product z.T @ x1.")
print("   - The condition means z.T @ x1 = 0 for all z in ker(B1).")
print("   - This implies x1 is in the orthogonal complement of ker(B1), which is the image of B1's transpose, Im(B1.T).")
print("   - Conclusion: x1 is in Im(B1.T) (x1 is a gradient field).")

print("\n2. Analyze the 'B1 @ x1 @ 1.T = 0' condition:")
print("   - This expression is the outer product of the vector (B1 @ x1) and a vector of ones.")
print("   - For the resulting matrix to be zero, the vector (B1 @ x1) must be the zero vector.")
print("   - This means x1 has zero divergence everywhere, so x1 is in the kernel of B1.")
print("   - Conclusion: x1 is in ker(B1) (x1 is a cycle flow).")

print("\n3. Combine the two conclusions:")
print("   - From linear algebra, we know that the subspaces Im(B1.T) and ker(B1) are orthogonal complements.")
print("   - The only vector that belongs to both a subspace and its orthogonal complement is the zero vector.")
print("   - Therefore, the edge signal x1 must be the zero vector: x1 = 0.")

print("\n4. Incorporate the definition of x1:")
print("   - We are given that for each edge e = {u, v}, the signal is defined as: x1_e = |x0_u - x0_v|.")
print("   - Since x1 = 0, every component x1_e must also be 0.")
print("   - This gives us the equation for every edge: |x0_u - x0_v| = 0.")

print("\n5. Draw the final inference about the Total Variation:")
print("   - The Total Variation (TV) of the vertex signal x0 on graph G is the sum of these absolute differences over all edges.")
print("   - TV(x0) = sum_{e={u,v} in E} |x0_u - x0_v|")
print("   - Since we deduced that each term |x0_u - x0_v| is 0, the total sum must be 0.")
print("   - The final equation is:")
print("     TV(G) = |x0_u1 - x0_v1| + |x0_u2 - x0_v2| + ... + |x0_u|E| - x0_v|E|| = 0 + 0 + ... + 0 = 0")

print("\nThis means the graph G has a total variation of 0, which corresponds to option D.")
