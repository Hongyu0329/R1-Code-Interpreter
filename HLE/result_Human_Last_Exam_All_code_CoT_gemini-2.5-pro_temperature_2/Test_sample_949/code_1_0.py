def solve():
    """
    This function solves the user's puzzle.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. False. A 'broomstick' graph, which is a long path ending in a wide star, can be constructed. For k nested pairs ending in m pairs, let k = log(m). The sum of log(L) will grow faster than sum of log(D).
    2. False. Same reason as 1.
    3. False. Same reason as 1.
    4. False. Interpreting the statement term-wise, we need L(x) <= D(x)^c for some c. For the root of a star graph with N pairs, L=2N and D=2. 2N <= 2^c is false for large N.
    5. True. The exponent on the D side is larger than on the L side (0.11 > 0.1). This extra power is sufficient to compensate for the fact that L(x) can be larger than D(x). For all standard string families (deeply nested, wide, etc.), the sum of L^0.1 is bounded by the sum of D^0.11.
    6. True. Similar to statement 5, the exponent on the D side is larger (1/2 > 1/4).
