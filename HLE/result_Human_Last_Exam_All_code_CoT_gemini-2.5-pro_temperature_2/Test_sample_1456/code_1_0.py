# This script explains the reasoning to find the maximum number of composants
# in the product of two nondegenerate continua.

# Step 1: Define the number of composants for the two fundamental types of continua.

# A decomposable continuum (e.g., a line segment) is the union of two proper subcontinua.
# It has exactly one composant.
num_composants_decomposable = 1

# An indecomposable continuum (e.g., a Knaster continuum) cannot be written as such a union.
# It has 'c' composants, where 'c' is the cardinality of the continuum (an uncountable infinity).
# We will represent this with a string, as it is not a standard integer.
num_composants_indecomposable = "c"

print(f"A decomposable continuum has {num_composants_decomposable} composant.")
print(f"An indecomposable continuum has {num_composants_indecomposable} composants.")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 2: Consider the product space X x Y.
# A key theorem states: The product X x Y is indecomposable if and only if
# BOTH X and Y are indecomposable.

# Case A: If at least one of X or Y is decomposable, the product X x Y is also decomposable.
# The number of composants would be 1.
result_case_A = num_composants_decomposable

# Case B: If both X and Y are indecomposable, the product X x Y is also indecomposable.
# The number of composants would be 'c'.
result_case_B = num_composants_indecomposable

print("To find the largest possible number of composants, we must make the product space X x Y indecomposable.")
print("This requires selecting two indecomposable continua for X and Y.")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 3: Formulate the final answer.
# The question asks for the largest *possible* number, so we take the maximum of the possible outcomes.

print("The symbolic equation representing our choice is:")
# The 'equation' shows that we are choosing the maximum value between the two cases.
print(f"Largest Number of Composants = max({result_case_A}, {result_case_B})")

# The maximum of 1 and 'c' is 'c'.
final_answer = result_case_B

print(f"\nTherefore, the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is {final_answer}.")
