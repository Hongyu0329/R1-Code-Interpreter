    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree and count the number of submatrices that are defined and used in its operations.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the HSS Tree Structure:** An HSS matrix is built by recursively partitioning a matrix. A tree of **depth 4** means the partitioning process is applied 4 times. This creates a binary tree structure with 5 levels of nodes (level 0 to level 4).\n2.  **Identify Submatrix Types:** During matrix operations (like multiplication), the algorithm accesses two distinct types of submatrices from this structure:\n    *   **Off-diagonal Submatrices:** At each partitioning step (from level 0 to level 3), the off-diagonal blocks are created and represented in a compressed format. We need to count all of these.\n    *   **Leaf Diagonal Submatrices:** The recursive partitioning stops at the deepest level (level 4). The diagonal blocks at this level are the \"leaves\" of the tree and are treated as standard dense matrices.\n3.  **Count the Submatrices:**\n    *   At each partitioning level `l` (where `l` ranges from 0 to 3), there are `2^l` parent matrices being partitioned. Each partition creates 2 off-diagonal blocks. We will sum these up.\n    *   The number of leaf diagonal blocks corresponds to the number of nodes at the final level, level 4, which is `2^4`.\n4.  **Sum the Counts:** The total number of accessed submatrices is the sum of all off-diagonal blocks and all leaf diagonal blocks.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out each step clearly, including the final equation with the computed numbers.\n\n```python\n# The depth of the Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree.\n# A tree of depth 'd' means the partitioning process is applied 'd' times,\n# resulting in levels 0, 1, ..., d.\ndepth = 4\n\n# --- Introduction ---\nprint(f\"Calculating the number of submatrices for an HSS tree of depth {depth}.\\n\")\nprint(\"An HSS matrix is built on a recursive partitioning.
