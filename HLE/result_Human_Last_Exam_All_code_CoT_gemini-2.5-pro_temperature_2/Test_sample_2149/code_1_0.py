# Step 1: Define the base of the equation, Y4.
# Y4 is composed of X9, X10, and X11.
# From the puzzle's logic:
# The reactants (Iodobenzene C6H5I, Styrene C8H8) give a set of atom counts: {1, 5, 6, 8, 8}.
# Y1 (from the Hall-HÃ©roult process, 1886) uses the digits {1, 8, 8, 6}.
# The single remaining digit from the reactant set is 5.
# This implies X9, X10, and X11 are all 5.
y4 = 555

# Step 2: Define the exponent of the equation.
# The exponent is the "Y1-Hall topological state indices for the reactants".
# This is interpreted as the reactant index not used by Y1.
# Reactant indices: {1, 5, 6, 8, 8}
# Y1 indices: {1, 6, 8, 8}
# The remaining index is 5.
exponent = 5

# Step 3: Calculate the result of Y4 to the power of the exponent.
result = y4 ** exponent

# Step 4: Print the final equation with all its components, as requested.
print(f"The equation is Y4 ^ (reactant index) = {y4} ^ {exponent}")
print(f"The result of the calculation is: {result}")
