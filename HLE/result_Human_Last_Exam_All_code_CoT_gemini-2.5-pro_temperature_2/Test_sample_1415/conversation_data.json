    "My plan is to solve this problem by first recognizing the form of the integral, which simplifies the calculation significantly, and then using Python to compute the final numerical value.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the integrand:** The expression to integrate is `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This is a classic form of `u'/u`.\n2.  **Evaluate the indefinite integral:** The integral of `u'(x)/u(x)` with respect to `x` is `ln|u(x)| + C`. Therefore, the integral of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1, which equals `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n4.  **Analyze F₃(x):**\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`.\n    *   For `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, `sin(x)` is between 0 and sin(1). `e^(sin(x))` is always positive. `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than 1. Therefore, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always positive. This allows us to remove the absolute value signs.\n    *   The integral `V` is `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n5.  **Calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0):**\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(2)`.\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`.\n6.  **Calculate the final value:**\n    *   The integral `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\n    *   I will use a Python script to compute this value `V`.\n    *   Finally, I will calculate `10000 * V` and round it to the nearest integer as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the definite integral and computes the final required value.\n    The integral is ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n    This simplifies to ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Calculate F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n    F3_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\n\n    # Calculate F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n    F3_0 = math.log(2)\n\n    # The value of the integral, V\n    V = math.log(F3_1) - math.log(F3_0)\n\n    # The final answer is the closest integer to 10000 * V\n    final_answer = round(10000 * V)\n\n    # Output the steps as requested\n    print(\"The integral V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 simplifies to ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Intermediate Values ---\")\n    print(f\"The final equation for V is: ln({F3_1:.6f}) - ln({F3_0:.6f})\")\n    \n    # Print the result of the calculation\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"The value of the integral V is: {V:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"The value of 10000 * V is: {10000 * V:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is: {final_answer}\")\n\n    # Output the final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve_integral()\n```"
