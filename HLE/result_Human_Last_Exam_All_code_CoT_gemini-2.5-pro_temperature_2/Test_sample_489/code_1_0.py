def solve_statements():
    """
    Solves the seven statements and prints the result.

    The analysis for each statement is as follows:
    a) False (N). The quotient space Omega_g^rt / GL_g(Z) is not Hausdorff because the action of GL_g(Z)
       is not proper on the boundary of the cone (strata of positive semidefinite matrices of rank < g),
       where stabilizers can be infinite. This prevents the separation of certain points in the quotient.

    b) True (Y). It is a standard theorem in polyhedral geometry that the barycentric subdivision of any
       rational polyhedral cone complex produces a simplicial cone complex. The perfect cone
       decomposition is such a complex.

    c) True (Y). Standard cone decompositions like the second Voronoi decomposition are "locally finite,"
       meaning any point in the ambient space has a neighborhood that intersects only finitely many cones.
       For a compact set K, the union of these neighborhoods covering K can be reduced to a finite
       subcover, implying K intersects only finitely many cones.

    d) True (Y). The GL_g(Z)-orbits of maximal cones in the perfect cone decomposition are in bijection
       with the classes of g-ary perfect quadratic forms. The number of these classes for g=7 has
       been determined to be 33.

    e) True (Y). If a cone `sigma` intersects Omega_g (the open set of positive definite matrices), it must
       be a top-dimensional cone (i.e., its dimension is g(g+1)/2). The stabilizer of a top-dimensional
       cone in the central cone decomposition is the automorphism group of its corresponding lattice type,
       which is a finite group.

    f) True (Y). This is a known, non-trivial computational result from the study of the topology of
       moduli spaces. The number of GL_5(Z)-orbits of cones of all dimensions in the second Voronoi
       decomposition of Omega_5^rt is indeed 222.

    g) False (N). The stabilizer of a face `tau` is generally larger than the stabilizer of the cone `sigma`
       itself, not a subset. For example, the stabilizer of a boundary cone (a face) can be an infinite
       parabolic subgroup, while the stabilizer of a top-dimensional cone (`sigma`) that contains it as a
       face is finite. An infinite group cannot be a subgroup of a finite one.
