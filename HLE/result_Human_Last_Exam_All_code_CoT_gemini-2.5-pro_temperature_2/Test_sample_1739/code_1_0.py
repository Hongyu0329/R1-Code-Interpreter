    This function calculates and prints the 3rd term of the nonlinear frequency correction.
    
    The derivation shows that the overall nonlinear frequency shift is a sum of several terms.
    We interpret the "3rd term" as the contribution from the quadratic velocity term (3/2 * R_dot^2)
    in the Rayleigh-Plesset equation.

    The derivation using the method of multiple scales yields this term's contribution
    to the frequency correction factor (delta_omega / (amplitude^2)) as:
    
    Term 3 = - (9 * gamma * (gamma + 2)) / (8 * omega_0)
