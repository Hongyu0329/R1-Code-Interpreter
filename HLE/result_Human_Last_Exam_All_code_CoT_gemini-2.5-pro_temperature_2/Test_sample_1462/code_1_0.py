    1. The combination of respiratory distress and a density in the left lung points to a Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH), where abdominal organs herniate into the chest.
    2. This herniation compresses the lung, leading to pulmonary hypoplasia and respiratory compromise.
    3. The anatomical cause of the most common type of CDH is a defect in the pleuroperitoneal membrane.
    4. Macrosomia (the baby's high weight of 12 lbs 1 oz) is a classic sign of maternal diabetes, which is a known risk factor for CDH.
    5. Therefore, the most direct answer describing the patient's anatomical defect is the pleuroperitoneal membrane defect.
