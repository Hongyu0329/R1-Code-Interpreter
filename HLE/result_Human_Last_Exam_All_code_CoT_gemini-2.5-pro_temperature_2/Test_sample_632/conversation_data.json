    "I will answer the historical question you've posed. Since the question requires a factual answer rather than a computation, my plan is to first state the answer and then, as per your instructions, provide a simple Python script that prints this answer to the console.\n\n```python\ndef reveal_feature():\n  \"\"\"\n  Prints the architectural feature that was removed from Piazza della Rotonda.\n  \"\"\"\n  feature = \"Tramway lines\"\n  location = \"Piazza della Rotonda\"\n  year_approx = 1950\n  \n  print(f\"The unique architectural feature in the {location} that was removed around the year {year_approx} was the city's {feature}.\")\n\nreveal_feature()\n```\n<<<Tramway lines>>>"
