    "To solve this problem, I will write a Python script that calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Board and Constraints:** The board is a 5x5 grid that wraps around both horizontally and vertically (a torus). The non-attacking constraint for queens must account for this wrap-around behavior.\n2.  **Toroidal Attack Rule:** Two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` are non-attacking if they are not in the same row (`r1 != r2`), not in the same column (`c1 != c2`), and not on the same diagonal. On a toroidal board, the diagonal attack occurs if the toroidal distance between the rows equals the toroidal distance between the columns.\n3.  **Toroidal Distance:** The distance `dist(a, b)` between two coordinates on a wrap-around axis of size `N` is calculated as `min(abs(a - b), N - abs(a - b))`.\n4.  **Algorithm (Backtracking):** I will use a backtracking algorithm, which is well-suited for this kind of combinatorial problem.\n    *   The algorithm will try to place the 4 queens one by one on the 25 squares of the board.\n    *   To avoid counting the same set of 4 squares in a different order (e.g., placing a queen at (0,0) then (1,2) vs. (1,2) then (0,0)), I will process the squares in a fixed linear order. When placing the `k`-th queen, the search for a valid square will only start from the square after where the `(k-1)`-th queen was placed.\n    *   For each potential placement, the script will check if it's \"safe\" using the toroidal attack rule.\n    *   If the placement is safe, it proceeds recursively to place the next queen. If not, it prunes this search path and backtracks to try the next square.\n    *   A counter is incremented every time a valid arrangement of all 4 queens is found.\n5.  **Final Output:** The script will execute the backtracking search and, once finished, print the total number of valid placements found.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef count_queen_placements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens\n    on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard using a backtracking algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
