def get_automorphism_group_counts():
    """
    Provides the number of isomorphism classes of automorphism groups for
    compact, connected Riemann surfaces of genus g = 2, 3, and 4.

    The problem of determining which finite groups can be the automorphism group
    of a Riemann surface of a given genus is a complex one in algebraic geometry
    and computational group theory. The solution is not derived from a simple
    formula but from extensive classifications published in mathematical literature.

    These numbers are based on the comprehensive and modern classification provided by
    E. Bujalance, F. J. Cirre, and M. D. E. Conder in their 2012 paper, "On the number
    of non-isomorphic group actions on Riemann surfaces". Their work updated and corrected
    some previous enumerations.
