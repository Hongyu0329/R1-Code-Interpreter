    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan to find the power subgroups of Q_128\n\n1.  **Understand the Group Q_128**: The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$, can be described by generators and relations. Let's define it as $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. The group has 128 elements, which can be split into two types:\n    *   64 elements of the form $x^i$ for $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, 63\\}$. These form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n    *   64 elements of the form $x^i y$ for $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, 63\\}$. The order of each of these elements is 4.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroup**: A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. That is, $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n\n3.  **Computational Strategy**:\n    *   **Represent Elements**: We can represent each element of $Q_{128}$ uniquely. A tuple format works well, for example: `('x', i)` for $x^i$ and `('xy', i)` for $x^i y$.\n    *   **Implement Power Operation**: We'll create a function `power(g, k)` that calculates $g^k$.\n        *   For an element $g=x^i$, the result is $x^{ik \\pmod{64}}$.\n        *   For an element $g=x^i y$, its powers repeat every 4th power: $(x^i y)^2 = x^{32}$ and $(x^i y)^4=1$. The result of $(x^i y)^k$ depends on `k % 4`.\n    *   **Find All Power Subgroups**: We will iterate through exponent values `k` from 0 up to the group order (127). For each `k`, we compute the set $G^k$ by taking every element of $Q_{128}$ to the power of `k`.\n    *   **Count Unique Subgroups**: The generated sets $G^k$ are the power subgroups. We store them (using frozensets, which are hashable) to identify and count the unique ones.\n    *   **Output Results**: The code will print the details of each unique power subgroup found and then state the final count.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this strategy.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_q128_elements():\n    \"\"\"Generates all 128 elements of the group Q_128.\"\"\"\n    elements = set()\n    # Elements of the form x^i\n    for i in range(64):\n        elements.add(('x', i))\n    # Elements of the form x^i y\n    for i in range(64):\n        elements.add(('xy', i))\n    return elements\n\ndef element_power(g, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes g^k for an element g in Q_128.\n    The group is Q_128 = <x, y | x^64=1, x^32=y^2, y^-1xy=x^-1>.\n    n is such that |G| = 4n, so n=32.
