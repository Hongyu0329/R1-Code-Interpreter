    "This is a problem in topology concerning the cardinality of metric spaces. My plan is to use the properties given to establish that the space $X$ must be separable, and then use the known upper bound for the cardinality of separable metric spaces.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the subset $U$**: We are given that $U$ is an open subset of $X$ and every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. This is the definition of a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\n2.  **Properties of Manifolds**: A key property of any topological manifold (of any dimension) is that it is *second-countable*. A space is second-countable if its topology has a countable basis.\n3.  **Separability**: For a metric space, being second-countable is equivalent to being *separable*. A space is separable if it contains a countable dense subset. Therefore, $U$ is a separable metric space and contains a countable dense subset, let's call it $D$.\n4.  **From $U$ to $X$**: We have that $D$ is dense in $U$ (meaning the closure of $D$ in $U$ is $U$) and $U$ is dense in $X$ (meaning the closure of $U$ in $X$ is $X$). The property of denseness is transitive. If $D$ is dense in $U$ and $U$ is dense in $X$, then $D$ must be dense in $X$. Therefore, $X$ is also a separable metric space.\n5.  **Cardinality of Separable Metric Spaces**: Any separable metric space has a cardinality of at most $c$, the cardinality of the continuum. This is because every point in the space can be uniquely identified by its relationship to the countable dense subset, and there are $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ ways to do this. For example, each point $x \\in X$ corresponds to a set of open balls $\\{B(d_i, q_j) \\mid d_i \\in D, q_j \\in \\mathbb{Q}^+, x \\in B(d_i, q_j)\\}$. The collection of all such balls is countable, and the number of subsets of a countable set is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n6.  **Conclusion**: An upper bound for the cardinality of $X$ is $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. This bound is achievable, for instance, by the topologist's sine curve, which satisfies all the conditions of the problem and has cardinality $c$.\n\nThe following python code prints out the logical steps leading to the answer and the final inequality.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_cardinality_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the derivation for the upper bound on the cardinality of X.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The given open subset U is a 1-dimensional manifold.\")\n    print(\"         This is because every point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Any manifold is second-countable.

Since D is dense in U, D is also dense in X.\")\n    print(\"         Therefore, X is a separable metric space.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Any separable metric space has a cardinality of at most 'c', the cardinality of the continuum.\")\n    print(\"         This bound can be shown to be achievable (e.g., using the topologist's sine curve).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 5: The final conclusion is that the cardinality of X, denoted |X|, is bounded by the continuum.\")\n    print(\"         The cardinality of the continuum is c = 2^ℵ₀ (2 to the power of aleph-naught).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    \n    # As requested, output each part of the equation |X| <= 2^ℵ₀\n    var = \"|X|\"\n    inequality = \"<=\"\n    base = 2\n    power = \"ℵ₀\"  # Using unicode for aleph_0\n    \n    print(f\"{var} {inequality} {base}^{power}\")\n\n\nsolve_cardinality_bound()\n\n```\n<<<2^ℵ₀>>>"
