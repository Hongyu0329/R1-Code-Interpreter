    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will interpret the given Hamiltonian, `H^ = -μN^`, in the context of the grand canonical ensemble. This is typically shorthand for the grand canonical operator `K^ = H_system - μN^`, which implies that the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian, `H_system`, is zero. This describes a system of non-interacting particles where energy is solely dependent on their number.\n\nNext, I will use the path integral formulation for the grand canonical partition function `Z`. For a system of non-interacting bosons described by a complex field `φ`, the partition function is given by `Z = ∫ D[φ*, φ] exp(-S)`, where `S` is the Euclidean action.\n\nI will then write down the action `S` corresponding to our zero-energy Hamiltonian. The resulting path integral is a standard Gaussian integral whose result is well-known. The general result for non-interacting bosons is `ln(Z) = -∑ᵢ ln(1 - exp(-β(εᵢ - μ)))`, where `εᵢ` are the single-particle energy levels.\n\nFinally, by substituting `εᵢ = 0` for all `M` single-particle states into the general solution, I will arrive at the final expression for the partition function `Z`. The Python code below will print this final derived formula and its components.\n\n```python\ndef solve_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function presents the derivation and final formula for the partition function Z\n    for the given system.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The partition function Z for a system with the grand canonical operator H = -μN is derived using the path integral for non-interacting bosons with zero single-particle energy.\")\n    print(\"The resulting equation is:\")\n\n    # Define the numerical components of the equation as per the instructions\n    term_A = 1\n    exponent_multiplier = -1\n\n    # The final formula is constructed from these components and symbolic variables.\n    # The full equation is Z = (term_A - exp(β*μ))**(exponent_multiplier * M)\n    \n    final_equation = \"Z = (1 - exp(β*μ))**(-M)\"\n    print(f\"\\n{final_equation}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Where:\")\n    print(\"  Z: The Grand Canonical Partition Function\")\n    print(\"  M: The total number of available single-particle states\")\n    print(\"  β: The inverse temperature (1 / k_B * T)\")\n    print(\"  μ: The chemical potential\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe numbers present in the final equation are:\")\n    print(f\"  - In the base (1 - exp(β*μ)), the number is: {term_A}\")\n    print(f\"  - In the exponent (-M), the minus sign corresponds to the number: {exponent_multiplier}\")\n\nsolve_partition_function()\n```\n<<<Z = (1 - exp(β*μ))**(-M)>>>"
