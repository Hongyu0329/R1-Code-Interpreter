    "Of course. My plan to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881 is as follows:\n\n1.  **Trial Division Algorithm**: I will use the trial division method, which is an efficient way to find the prime factors of a number.\n2.  **Initialization**: Start with the number `n = 8139881`. I'll create an empty list to store its prime factors.\n3.  **Divide by 2**: First, I will repeatedly divide `n` by 2 until it's no longer even, adding 2 to my list of factors each time. Since 8139881 is odd, this step will be skipped.\n4.  **Divide by Odd Numbers**: Next, I will iterate through odd numbers (`i = 3, 5, 7, ...`) up to the square root of the current `n`.\n5.  **Factor Extraction**: For each odd number `i`, I'll check if it divides `n`. If it does, I will add `i` to my list of factors and divide `n` by `i` repeatedly until it's no longer divisible.\n6.  **The Final Factor**: After the loop finishes, if the remaining value of `n` is greater than 1, it means this remaining number is itself a prime factor (and it will be the largest one). I will add it to the list of factors.\n7.  **Identify Largest Factor**: The largest prime divisor is simply the largest number in the list of factors I've collected.\n8.  **Output**: Finally, the script will print the full prime factorization as an equation and then state the largest prime factor found.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the prime factors of 8139881 using trial division,\n    constructs an equation showing the factorization, and prints the largest factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    number = 8139881\n    n = number\n    factors = []\n\n    # Account for the factor 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Account for odd factors up to the square root of the remaining n\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n //= i\n        i += 2\n\n    # If n is a prime number greater than 2, it's the last factor\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # Print the factorization equation and the final answer\n    if factors:\n        factor_equation = \" * \".join(map(str, factors))\n        print(f\"{number} = {factor_equation}\")\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n        print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {number} is {largest_prime}\")\n    else:\n        # This case is for when the number itself is prime\n        print(f\"{number} is a prime number, so its largest prime divisor is itself.\")\n\nfind_largest_prime_divisor()\n```\n<<<42617>>>"
