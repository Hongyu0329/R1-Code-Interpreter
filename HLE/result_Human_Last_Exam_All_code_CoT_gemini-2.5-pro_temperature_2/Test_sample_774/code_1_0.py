    # The term l(n, p) is the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold M(n,p).
    # A detailed analysis of the provided exponential map formula reveals a contradiction
    # for the given parameters unless the tangent vectors are purely "vertical".
    # This restriction leads to the conclusion that the injectivity radius is that
    # of the fiber, which is O(p). For the induced metric, this is pi for p >= 2.
    # The primes involved are all for indices > 14567, so p >= 5.
    # Thus, l(n,p) = pi for all terms in the sum.
