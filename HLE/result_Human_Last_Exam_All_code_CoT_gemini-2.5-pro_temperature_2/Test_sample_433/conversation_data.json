    "Based on sterile compounding guidelines, such as those from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), the rules for single-dose containers are very strict to prevent microbial contamination and ensure patient safety.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the key terms: \"single-dose ampule\" and \"sterile environment\". An ampule is a glass container that cannot be resealed once broken open. A sterile environment refers to an ISO Class 5 air quality environment.\n2.  Recall the specific guideline from USP Chapter <797>. For an opened ampule, it is an open system exposed to the environment.\n3.  Because it cannot be resealed, it cannot be stored. The official guideline states it must be used immediately.\n4.  Therefore, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for storage is effectively zero. Any unused portion must be discarded immediately after the needed dose is withdrawn.\n5.  The python code will state this conclusion clearly.\n\n```python\ndef get_ampule_bud():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to USP <797> sterile compounding standards, an ampule is a single-dose container\n    # that cannot be resealed after it is opened.\n    \n    # The rule for an opened ampule in a sterile environment is that it must be used immediately.\n    # It cannot be stored for any period of time.\n    bud_for_storage_in_hours = 0\n    \n    print(\"For a single-dose container ampule punctured in a sterile environment:\")\n    print(\"The contents must be used immediately.\")\n    print(f\"The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for storage is {bud_for_storage_in_hours} hours, as it cannot be stored.\")\n    print(\"After the initial dose is withdrawn, the ampule and any remaining contents must be discarded immediately.\")\n\nget_ampule_bud()\n```\n<<<Immediate use (0 hours storage time)>>>"
