    "The task is to identify the common name for the space-time double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function within the nuclear criticality community and to provide this information using a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Concept:** The generalized pair correlation function, *g(r, τ)*, quantifies the correlation of neutron detection events separated by a spatial vector *r* and a time interval *τ*. This is a central concept in reactor noise analysis techniques like Rossi-alpha and Feynman-alpha measurements.\n2.  **Define the Transform:** A double Fourier transform will convert this function from the space-time domain *(r, τ)* to the wavevector-frequency domain *(k, ω)*.\n3.  **Name the Result:** The resulting function, *S(k, ω)*, is most commonly known in the nuclear criticality and reactor physics community as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**.\n4.  **Provide the Simplified Form:** For a simple point reactor model, the spatial dependence is ignored, and the PSD's frequency dependence is described by a Lorentzian function, *PSD(ω) ∝ 1 / (ω² + α²)*, where *α* is the prompt neutron decay constant, or Rossi-alpha.\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Prints the name of the transformed function.\n    *   Explains the concept and displays the general formula for the transform.\n    *   Shows the simplified but very common result from point reactor kinetics.\n    *   Explicitly prints each component of the simplified formula (variables, constants, and operators) to meet the output requirements.\n\n```python\ndef describe_correlation_transform():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the space-time Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function\n    in the context of nuclear criticality.\n    \"\"\"\n    name = \"Power Spectral Density (PSD)\"\n    equation_symbol = \"S(k, ω)\"\n    correlation_function = \"g(r, τ)\"\n\n    print(f\"The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function ({correlation_function}) is commonly called the '{name}'.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Conceptual Explanation ---\")\n    print(f\"The pair correlation function, {correlation_function}, measures the probability of finding a neutron at a certain position and time relative to another neutron.\")\n    print(\"Applying a Fourier transform in both space (r -> k, wavevector) and time (τ -> ω, frequency) yields a function in the frequency domain.\")\n    print(f\"This transformed function is denoted as {equation_symbol} and is defined as:\")\n    print(f\"  {equation_symbol} = ∫∫ {correlation_function} * e^(-i(k·r - ωτ)) dr dτ\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Result in a Simplified Model ---\")\n    print(\"For many applications, a simplified 'point reactor' model is used.
