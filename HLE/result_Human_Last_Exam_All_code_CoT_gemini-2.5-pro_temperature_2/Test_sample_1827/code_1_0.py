# The problem concerns a K meson, which consists of a strange quark and an
# up or down antiquark. This implies a universe with at least three quark
# flavors (u, d, s). We will set the number of flavors, Nf, to 3.
Nf = 3

# Step 1: Calculate the number of generators for the symmetry group in the gas phase.
# Before condensation, the introduction of a chemical potential for the strange quark
# reduces the U(Nf) vector symmetry to G_gas = U(Nf-1) x U(1).
# The number of generators of a U(N) group is N^2.
# So, the number of generators for G_gas is ((Nf-1)^2) for the U(Nf-1) part
# and (1^2) for the U(1) part.
num_gen_gas = (Nf - 1)**2 + 1**2

# Step 2: Calculate the number of generators for the unbroken symmetry group after condensation.
# Kaon condensation pairs the strange quark with one of the light quarks.
# The G_gas symmetry is spontaneously broken down to a smaller group, H, that acts
# on the remaining (Nf-2) light quarks. This unbroken group is H = U(Nf-2).
# The number of generators for H is (Nf-2)^2.
# For Nf=2, U(0) is the trivial group with 0 generators.
# For Nf=3, H = U(1), which has 1^2 = 1 generator.
num_gen_condensed = (Nf - 2)**2

# Step 3: Apply Goldstone's theorem to find the number of Goldstone bosons.
# The number of Goldstone bosons equals the number of broken generators, which is the
# difference between the dimensions of the original and final symmetry groups.
num_goldstone_bosons = num_gen_gas - num_gen_condensed

# Final step: Print the calculation step-by-step as requested.
# The output will show the number of generators for the gas phase group,
# the condensed phase group, and the resulting number of Goldstone bosons.
