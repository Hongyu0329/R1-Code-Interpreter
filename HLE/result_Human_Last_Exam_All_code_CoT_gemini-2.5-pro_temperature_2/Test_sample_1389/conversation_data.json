    "To determine the relationship between the vaccine efficacy estimated from the incidence rate ratio (1-IRR) and the true per-exposure efficacy for an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine, we can set up a hypothetical scenario and calculate the relevant values.\n\n**Our Plan:**\n\n1.  **Model an \"All-or-Nothing\" Vaccine:** We'll start by defining a true vaccine efficacy, let's say `VE_true = 90%`. In an all-or-nothing model, this means 90% of vaccinated people are perfectly immune, and the other 10% are just as susceptible as unvaccinated people.\n2.  **Define a Population and Force of Infection:** We'll create hypothetical vaccinated and unvaccinated groups and assume a constant force of infection (the rate at which susceptible individuals get infected).\n3.  **Calculate Incidence Rates:**\n    *   For the unvaccinated group, all individuals are at risk. The incidence rate (`IR_u`) is simply the force of infection.\n    *   For the vaccinated group, only the non-protected fraction (10% in our case) is at risk. We calculate the number of cases in this subgroup but divide by the total person-time of the *entire* vaccinated group, as is standard practice in cohort studies. This will give us `IR_v`.\n4.  **Calculate Estimated VE:** We will compute the Incidence Rate Ratio (`IRR = IR_v / IR_u`) and then the estimated vaccine efficacy (`VE_estimated = 1 - IRR`).\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** We will compare the `VE_estimated` with the `VE_true` we defined in step 1. If they are equal, `1-IRR` is a correct estimator.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\n# 1. Define the model parameters\nve_true = 0.90  # True vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine (90%)\nforce_of_infection = 0.05  # 5 cases per 100 person-years among susceptibles\npopulation_size = 10000  # Size of each group\ntime_years = 1  # Duration of the study in years\n\n# 2. Calculate person-time at risk for each group\nperson_time_u = population_size * time_years\n# For a cohort study, all vaccinated individuals are considered in the denominator\n# for person-time, even though a fraction is immune.\nperson_time_v = population_size * time_years\n\n# 3. Calculate expected number of cases and Incidence Rates\n# Unvaccinated Group: All are susceptible\ncases_u = population_size * force_of_infection * time_years\nir_u = cases_u / person_time_u\n\n# Vaccinated Group: Only the (1 - VE_true) fraction is susceptible\nsusceptible_v_fraction = 1 - ve_true\ncases_v = (population_size * susceptible_v_fraction) * force_of_infection * time_years\nir_v = cases_v / person_time_v\n\n# 4. Calculate IRR and the estimated VE from the IRR\nirr = ir_v / ir_u\nve_estimated = 1 - irr\n\n# 5. Print results and compare\nprint(\"--- Model Parameters ---\")\nprint(f\"True All-or-Nothing VE (VE_true): {ve_true:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Force of Infection (among susceptibles): {force_of_infection}\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Calculated Incidence Rates ---\")\nprint(f\"Incidence Rate in Unvaccinated (IR_u): {ir_u:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Incidence Rate in Vaccinated (IR_v):   {ir_v:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\n--- VE Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR = IR_v / IR_u): {irr:.2f}\")\n# The user wants the full equation in the output.\nprint(f\"Estimated VE = 1 - IRR\")\nprint(f\"             = 1 - {irr:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"             = {ve_estimated:.2f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\nif abs(ve_estimated - ve_true) < 1e-9:\n    print(f\"The estimated VE ({ve_estimated:.2f}) correctly estimates the true VE ({ve_true:.2f}).\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The estimated VE ({ve_estimated:.2f}) does not correctly estimate the true VE ({ve_true:.2f}).\")\n\n```\n<<<C>>>"
