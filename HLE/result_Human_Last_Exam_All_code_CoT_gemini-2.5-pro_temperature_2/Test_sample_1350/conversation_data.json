    "My plan is to answer your question by first identifying the correct character from William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*. I will search through the book's plot and character descriptions to find who visited a Roman city and witnessed their customs. Specifically, I'll look for a passage describing a scene that clearly references the Roman foundation myth of Romulus, Remus, and the she-wolf.\n\nOnce the character is identified, I will write a simple Python script as you requested. The script will define variables to hold the character's name and a description of their experience, and then it will use the `print()` function to present this information as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_character_in_wolfings():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and describes the character from \"The House of the Wolfings\"\n    who describes Roman religious practices related to Romulus and Remus.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    character_name = \"Otter\"\n    \n    description = (\n        \"In Chapter VI, 'Otter tells of the Romans', the character Otter describes his time as a thrall (slave) in a Roman city. \"\n        \"He recounts seeing a statue of 'a She-wolf giving suck to two men-children' in the city's forum. \"\n        \"He explains to his fellow Wolfings that the Romans believe themselves to be 'the sons of the Wolf' and that their war-god is 'the Wolf-god's very self.' \"\n        \"This is a clear reference to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus, who were suckled by a she-wolf and were said to be the sons of the war-god, Mars.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"The character who visited a Roman city is: {character_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the context of his description:\")\n    print(description)\n\nfind_character_in_wolfings()\n```\n<<<Otter>>>"
