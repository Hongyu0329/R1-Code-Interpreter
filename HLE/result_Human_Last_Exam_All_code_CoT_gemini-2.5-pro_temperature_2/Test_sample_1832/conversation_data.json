    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols, $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$, for the spacetime geometry outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged massive object.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Metric:** The geometry of spacetime in this case is described by the Schwarzschild metric.\n2.  **Coordinates and Metric Tensor:** We'll use the standard Schwarzschild coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$. The metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ in these coordinates is diagonal. Its components depend only on the radial coordinate $r$ and the polar angle $\\theta$. We will use geometrized units where $G=c=1$.\n3.  **Christoffel Symbol Formula:** The Christoffel symbols are calculated from the metric tensor and its derivatives using the formula:\n    $$ \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\nu\\sigma}}{\\partial x^\\mu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\sigma}}{\\partial x^\\nu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right) $$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor.\n4.  **Symbolic Calculation:** Due to the complexity of the derivatives and the summation, the most reliable way to perform this calculation is by using a symbolic math library. I will use Python's `sympy` library.\n5.  **Implementation:**\n    *   Define the symbolic variables and coordinates.\n    *   Construct the Schwarzschild metric tensor `g` and its inverse `g_inv`.\n    *   Loop through all possible indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$. To count only the unique symbols, we'll enforce the condition $\\mu \\le \\nu$, since the Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower indices ($\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$).\n    *   For each combination, calculate $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ using the formula.\n    *   Use `sympy.simplify()` to check if the resulting expression is mathematically zero.\n    *   If a symbol is non-zero, the code will print its definition and increment a counter.\n    *   Finally, the code will print the total count of unique non-zero symbols.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and counts the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
