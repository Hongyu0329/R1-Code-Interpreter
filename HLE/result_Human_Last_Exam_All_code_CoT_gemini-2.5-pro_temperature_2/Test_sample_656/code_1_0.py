# Step 1: Define parameters for the optimal container found.
L, W, H = 12.0, 12.0, 15.5
container_description = "box 12.0x12.0x15.5"

# Step 2: Define ball properties.
large_ball_diameter = 4.0
small_ball_diameter = 2.0

# Step 3: Calculate the number of large balls.
# They are packed in a 3x3x3 configuration inside a 12x12x12 portion of the box.
num_large_L = int(L / large_ball_diameter)
num_large_W = int(W / large_ball_diameter)
# The height for the large ball packing is chosen to be 12.0 to form a full grid.
large_ball_packing_H = 12.0
num_large_H = int(large_ball_packing_H / large_ball_diameter)
num_large_balls = num_large_L * num_large_W * num_large_H

# Step 4: Calculate the number of small balls in the remaining space.

# 4a. Voids: A n_L x n_W x n_H grid of spheres has (n_L-1)x(n_W-1)x(n_H-1) interstitial voids.
num_small_voids = (num_large_L - 1) * (num_large_W - 1) * (num_large_H - 1)

# 4b. Leftover Slab: Calculate dimensions and pack small balls.
slab_L = L
slab_W = W
slab_H = H - large_ball_packing_H
num_small_slab = int(slab_L / small_ball_diameter) * int(slab_W / small_ball_diameter) * int(slab_H / small_ball_diameter)

# Step 5: Sum up and print the final result.
total_num_small_balls = num_small_voids + num_small_slab
total_num_large_balls = num_large_balls

# The problem requires printing the numbers in the final formatted string.
# Each number is calculated and then included.
# 'a' is the number of 1-cm balls (small)
a = total_num_small_balls
# 'b' is the number of 2-cm balls (large)
b = total_num_large_balls

final_answer = f"[{container_description}]{a};{b}"
print(final_answer)

# <<<[box 12.0x12.0x15.5]44;27>>>
