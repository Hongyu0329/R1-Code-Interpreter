    "To find the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), we first need to clarify the term \"sum of graphs\". In graph theory, this term most commonly refers to the **graph join** operation, denoted by \\( + \\).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem based on this interpretation:\n1.  **Define the Graph Join:** The join of two graphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), written as \\( G_1 + G_2 \\), is formed by taking their disjoint union and adding an edge between every vertex of \\( G_1 \\) and every vertex of \\( G_2 \\).\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Join:** A key property of the graph join is that its chromatic number is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\).\n3.  **Apply to the Problem:** Our graph \\( G \\) is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), which we can write as \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\). Using the property from step 2, its chromatic number is \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) \\).\n4.  **Find the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( \\chi(C_n) \\)):** The chromatic number of a cycle \\( C_n \\) (for \\( n \\geq 3 \\)) depends on whether \\( n \\) is even or odd.\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **even**, the cycle is bipartite and can be colored with 2 colors. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **odd**, the cycle is not bipartite and requires 3 colors. So, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n5.  **Calculate \\( \\chi(G) \\):** Now we can calculate the chromatic number of \\( G \\) for both cases:\n    *   For even \\( n \\): \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6 \\).\n    *   For odd \\( n \\): \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\cdot \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\).\n6.  **Determine the Maximal Value:** The possible values for the chromatic number of \\( G \\) are 6 and 9. The maximal value is therefore 9.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this logic and calculates the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G which is the\n    sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the interpretation of \"sum\" as graph join.\n    print(\"Step 1: Interpreting the 'sum' of graphs as the graph join operation.\")\n    print(\"The graph G is taken to be the join of three cycles, G = C_n + C_n + C_n.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: State the formula for the chromatic number of a join.\n    print(\"Step 2: Use the formula for the chromatic number of a join:\")\n    print(\"χ(G1 + G2) = χ(G1) + χ(G2)\")\n    print(\"This implies χ(G) = χ(C_n) + χ(C_n) + χ(C_n) = 3 * χ(C_n).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Define a function for the chromatic number of a cycle.\n    def chromatic_number_of_cycle(n):\n        if n < 3:\n            # Cycles are defined for n >= 3.\n            return 0\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            return 2\n        else:\n            return 3\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate χ(G) for both even and odd n.\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate χ(G) based on the parity of n.\")\n    \n    # Case 1: n is even (e.g., n=4)\n    n_even = 4\n    chi_cn_even = chromatic_number_of_cycle(n_even)\n    chi_g_even = 3 * chi_cn_even\n    print(f\"For even n (e.g., n={n_even}):\")\n    print(f\"  - χ(C_{n_even}) = {chi_cn_even}\")\n    print(f\"  - χ(G) = 3 * {chi_cn_even} = {chi_g_even}\\n\")\n\n    # Case 2: n is odd (e.g., n=5)\n    n_odd = 5\n    chi_cn_odd = chromatic_number_of_cycle(n_odd)\n    chi_g_odd = 3 * chi_cn_odd\n    print(f\"For odd n (e.g., n={n_odd}):\")\n    print(f\"  - χ(C_{n_odd}) = {chi_cn_odd}\")\n    print(f\"  - χ(G) = 3 * {chi_cn_odd} = {chi_g_odd}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Determine the maximal value.\n    print(\"Step 5: Determine the maximal chromatic number.\")\n    possible_values = [chi_g_even, chi_g_odd]\n    maximal_chromatic_number = max(possible_values)\n\n    # Format the final equation as requested\n    numbers_in_equation = \", \".join(map(str, sorted(possible_values)))\n    final_equation = f\"Maximal χ(G) = max({numbers_in_equation})\"\n    \n    print(f\"The possible values for χ(G) are {set(possible_values)}.\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation is: {final_equation} = {maximal_chromatic_number}\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"The maximal chromatic number of G is {maximal_chromatic_number}.\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<9>>>\n```"
