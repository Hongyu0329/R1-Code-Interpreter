    "Here is a plan to determine which ROMM RGB colors fall outside the sRGB gamut:\n\n1.  **Understand Color Gamuts**: The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a wider gamut than the standard sRGB color space. This means there are colors in ROMM RGB that cannot be accurately displayed on an sRGB monitor.\n2.  **Conversion Process**: To check if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert it to sRGB. The key is to check the color's values *after* conversion to linear sRGB, but *before* the final gamma correction (companding).\n3.  **Linear sRGB Check**: If any of the R, G, or B components in the linear sRGB space are less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the color is \"out-of-gamut\" for sRGB and cannot be represented correctly.\n4.  **Transformation Steps**: The full conversion from non-linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB involves three main steps:\n    a.  **Linearization (Inverse Companding)**: Convert the gamma-corrected ROMM RGB values to linear light values. ROMM RGB uses a gamma of approximately 1.8.\n    b.  **Matrix Transformation to XYZ**: Convert the linear ROMM RGB values to the standard CIE XYZ color space using a specific conversion matrix (based on D50 illuminant).\n    c.  **Matrix Transformation to sRGB**: Convert the XYZ values to linear sRGB values using another matrix. This step also involves a chromatic adaptation from the D50 illuminant of ROMM to the D65 illuminant of sRGB.\n5.  **Execution**: I will write a Python script that implements these transformations for each of the given colors and checks if the resulting linear sRGB values are within the [0.0, 1.0] range. The indices of the colors that fall outside this range will be collected and presented as the answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_color_gamut():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which ROMM RGB colors cannot be represented in sRGB.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Conversion matrix from linear ROMM RGB (D50) to CIE XYZ (D50)\n    ROMM_TO_XYZ_D50 = np.array([\n        [0.7976749, 0.1351917, 0.0313534],\n        [0.2880402, 0.7118741, 0.0000857],\n        [0.0000000, 0.0000000, 0.8252100]\n    ])\n\n    # Conversion matrix from CIE XYZ (D50) to linear sRGB (D65)\n    # This matrix includes the Bradford chromatic adaptation transform.\n    XYZ_D50_TO_SRGB_D65 = np.array([\n        [ 3.1338561, -1.6168667, -0.4906146],\n        [-0.9787684,  1.9161415,  0.0334540],\n        [ 0.0719453, -0.2289914,  1.4052427]\n    ])\n    \n    # Input ROMM RGB colors\n    colors = {\n        1: (0, 0, 1),\n        2: (0, 1, 0),\n        3: (0, 0.5, 0.6),\n        4: (0.4, 0.5, 0.6),\n        5: (1, 1, 1)\n    }\n\n    cannot_represent_indices = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors can be represented in sRGB...\")\n\n    for i, rgb_romm in colors.items():\n        # --- The Conversion Equation Starts Here ---\n        \n        # Step 1: Linearize ROMM RGB (Inverse Companding)\n        # ROMM uses a gamma of 1.8.
