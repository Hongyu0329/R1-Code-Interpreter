    """
    Calculates the sum over all natural dimensions of the specified ratio.

    The problem asks for the sum S = sum_{d=1 to infinity} V_d, where V_d = A_d / B_d.

    1. A_d is the expected volume of the convex hull of {0, p_1, ..., p_d}, where
       p_i = c_i * e_i and c_i ~ U(-1, 1).
       A_d = E[(1/d!) * |c_1 * ... * c_d|] = (1/d!) * (E[|c|])^d = (1/d!) * (1/2)^d.

    2. B_d is the expected pairwise Euclidean distance between any pair of points
       in the same set.
       There are d*(d+1)/2 pairs. The average of expected distances is calculated.
       E[dist(0, p_i)] = E[|c_i|] = 1/2.
       E[dist(p_i, p_j)] is a constant I = (sqrt(2) + log(1+sqrt(2)))/3.
       B_d = (d * (1/2) + (d*(d-1)/2) * I) / (d*(d+1)/2)
           = (1 + (d-1)*I) / (d+1).

    3. The sum S is computed numerically by summing the terms V_d = A_d / B_d until
       the terms become negligibly small.
