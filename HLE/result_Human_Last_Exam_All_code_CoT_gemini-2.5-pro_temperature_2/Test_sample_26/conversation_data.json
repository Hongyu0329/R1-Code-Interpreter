    "The user wants to find the rank of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$, for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\nHere is my thinking process to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the object X**: $X$ is a surface defined by a degree 5 polynomial in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. Its complex dimension is 2, so its real dimension as a manifold is 4.\n2.  **Determine basic topological invariants**:\n    *   By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, the inclusion $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\cong \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ for $k < \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 2$.\n    *   Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$), we have $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. So $X$ is simply connected (1-connected).\n    *   For a compact, orientable 4-manifold like $X$, Poincaré Duality implies that the Betti numbers satisfy $b_k = b_{4-k}$.\n    *   From $\\pi_1(X)=0$, we get $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$, so the first Betti number $b_1=0$.\n    *   By Poincaré Duality, $b_3 = b_{4-3} = b_1 = 0$. This means the homology group $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is purely torsion. In fact, a deeper look using the Universal Coefficient Theorem and Poincaré Duality ($H_3(X) \\cong H^1(X)$) shows that $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$.\n3.  **Calculate the second Betti number $b_2$**:\n    *   I will compute the topological Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$.\n    *   Using our known Betti numbers, this becomes $\\chi(X) = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n    *   The Euler characteristic can be calculated using Chern classes and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(T_X)$, or via Noether's formula for complex surfaces: $12\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) = \\int_X (c_1(T_X)^2 + c_2(T_X))$.\n    *   Let's find the components:\n        *   The canonical bundle of a degree $d=5$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is $K_X = \\mathcal{O}_X(d - (n+1)) = \\mathcal{O}_X(5 - 4) = \\mathcal{O}_X(1)$.\n        *   $c_1(T_X)$ corresponds to $-K_X$. The self-intersection number of the canonical bundle, $K_X^2 = \\int_X c_1(K_X)^2$, equals the degree of $X$, which is 5. So $\\int_X c_1(T_X)^2 = 5$.\n        *   The geometric genus $p_g = h^{2,0}(X) = \\dim H^0(X, K_X) = \\dim H^0(\\mathcal{O}_X(1)) = 4$. The irregularity $q = h^{1,0}(X)=0$ as $b_1=0$.\n        *   The arithmetic genus is $\\chi(\\mathcal{O}_X) = p_g - q + 1 = 4 - 0 + 1 = 5$.\n        *   Plugging into Noether's formula: $12 \\cdot 5 = 5 + \\int_X c_2(T_X) \\implies 60 = 5 + \\chi(X) \\implies \\chi(X) = 55$.\n    *   Now we can find $b_2$: $55 = 2 + b_2 \\implies b_2 = 53$.\n4.  **Connect homology to homotopy**:\n    *   Since $X$ is 1-connected, the Hurewicz Theorem states that $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    *   Since $b_1=0$, Universal Coefficient Theorem implies $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a free abelian group. Thus, $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{b_2} = \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n    *   So, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n5.  **Compute $\\pi_3(X)$**:\n    *   For a 1-connected 4-manifold like $X$, a theorem by J.H.C. Whitehead gives the structure of the third homotopy group: $\\pi_3(X) \\cong H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))$.\n    *   The group $\\Gamma(A)$ is Whitehead's universal quadratic functor.\n    *   We found $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$ and $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n    *   So, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$.\n    *   The rank of the free part of the group $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^k)$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{k}{2}$.\n    *   The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is therefore $\\binom{53}{2}$.\n6.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\binom{53}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times (53-1)}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 53 \\times 26 = 1378$.\n\nThis step-by-step derivation will now be implemented in a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_homotopy_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
