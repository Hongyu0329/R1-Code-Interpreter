    "To answer your question, I will analyze the definition of each ballet step provided in the options. My goal is to determine which step, by its standard definition, finishes in the same leg position from which it started. The analysis will consider whether a step is classified as \"changé\" (changed) or \"sans changer\" (unchanged).\n\nI will write a Python script that codifies this dance knowledge. The script will hold the properties of each step and programmatically determine the correct answer by finding the step that does not change the starting foot position. It will print the step-by-step reasoning and then the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Helper class to capture print output for final formatting\nclass Capturing(list):\n    def __enter__(self):\n        self._stdout = sys.stdout\n        sys.stdout = self._stringio = io.StringIO()\n        return self\n    def __exit__(self, *args):\n        self.extend(self._stringio.getvalue().splitlines())\n        del self._stringio    # free up some memory\n        sys.stdout = self._stdout\n\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same position it starts.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    steps = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'changes_position': False,\n            'reason': ('An even-numbered entrechat (like quatre, six) is defined as a jump that lands in the '\n                       'same fifth position from which it started.
