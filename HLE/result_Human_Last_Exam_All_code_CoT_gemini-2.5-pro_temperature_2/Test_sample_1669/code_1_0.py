    print("A valid k-vector 'v' for G has two properties:")

    print("\nLet's build a consistent assignment of values:")
    print("1. Take any cycle C in the 2-factor F. All edges on this cycle must have the same value, s_C, which can be +1 or -1. This is because at any vertex on the cycle, its two cycle-edges must have the same value 's' to satisfy the '{s, s, -2s}' pattern.")
    print("2. Once the value s_C for a cycle C is chosen, the value of any matching edge 'm' connected to a vertex on C is determined. Its value must be -2*s_C.")
    print("3. This construction is always possible. For any such graph G, we can find a 2-factor F, assign a sign (+1 or -1) to the cycles in each connected component of its 'cycle-graph', and this uniquely determines a valid assignment for all edges in G.")
    print("This constructive proof shows that a valid vector with values in {+/-1, +/-2} always exists.\n")

    print("Step 5: Conclusion.")
    print("---------------------")
