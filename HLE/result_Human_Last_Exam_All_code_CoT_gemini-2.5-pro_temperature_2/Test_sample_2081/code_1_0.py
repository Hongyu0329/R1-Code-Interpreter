# The problem requires finding the radius R of the set of initial values 
# (x0, y0, z0) for which the nonlinear boundary-value problem has a solution.
# Through perturbation analysis, we find that the initial values must satisfy the equation:
# x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2 = R^2
# where R^2 is determined by the parameters T and alpha.

# The derived formula for the squared radius is R^2 = 0.5 * (exp(T) + 1) * exp(T).
# We are given T = ln(10^34).

# We can use floating point numbers with high precision from Python's standard library.
# The value exp(T) = exp(ln(10^34)) = 10^34.
e_T = 10**34

# Calculate the squared radius R^2 using the derived formula.
# Note: In standard float representation, (10**34 + 1) is indistinguishable from 10**34.
# This approximation is acceptable as the relative error is extremely small.
R_squared = 0.5 * (e_T + 1) * e_T

# The final equation for the set of initial values (x0, y0, z0) is x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2 = R^2
# The question asks for the radius R of this set.
R = math.sqrt(R_squared)

# As requested, we output the number in the final equation for the initial values.
