  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.\n\nThe teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+4.\n\nYou've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a non-empty string s — the sum Xenia needs to count. String s contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters \"+\". Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. String s is at most 1000 characters long.\n\nOutput\nPrint the new sum that Xenia can count.\n\nTask:\n\nWrite the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem.

    "Of course, I can help you with this. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will address the main task of rearranging the sum for Xenia. The core idea is to extract the numbers from the input string, sort them in non-decreasing order, and then join them back together with '+' signs to form the new sum string. For the Python solution, this can be efficiently done using built-in string and list methods.\n\nSecond, as per your specific request, I will analyze the most memory-efficient C program to solve this same problem. The goal is to calculate `m`, the total memory in bytes used by the variables in that C program. A memory-efficient C solution would not store all the numbers in an array. Instead, it can use a \"counting sort\" approach. It would read the input string character by character, counting the occurrences of '1', '2', '3', and '4' without storing the whole string or the list of numbers. After counting, it can directly print the sorted sum.\n\nThe variables needed for such a C program would be:\n*   An integer array of size 4 to store the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Assuming an `int` is 4 bytes, this takes `4 * 4 = 16` bytes.\n*   A `char` variable to read each character from the input. This takes 1 byte.\n*   A few integer variables for loop counters and for managing the printing of the '+' signs. Three `int` variables would suffice (e.g., two for nested loops, one as a flag). This takes `3 * 4 = 12` bytes.\n\nTherefore, the total memory `m` used for variables would be `16 + 1 + 12 = 29` bytes.\n\nFollowing this plan, here is the Python code to solve the problem for Xenia.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function reads a sum as a string, rearranges the numbers in non-decreasing\n    order, and prints the new sum.\n    Example: 1+3+2+1 -> 1+1+2+3\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the sum from standard input.\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # The summands are separated by '+'. We can split the string by the '+'\n    # character to get a list of the numbers (as strings).\n    numbers = s.split('+')\n\n    # Sort the list of numbers. Since the numbers are single digits '1', '2', '3', '4',\n    # a simple lexicographical sort works correctly.\n    numbers.sort()\n\n    # Join the sorted list of numbers back into a single string, with '+'\n    # as the separator.\n    new_sum = '+'.join(numbers)\n\n    # Print the final rearranged sum.\n    print(new_sum)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<29>>>"
