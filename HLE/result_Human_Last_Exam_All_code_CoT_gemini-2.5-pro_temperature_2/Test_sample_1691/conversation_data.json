    "To solve this problem, we need to find an analytical approximation for the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for small positive $\\epsilon$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the dominant contribution:** The parameter $\\epsilon$ is small. The integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + f(x)}$ becomes very large when the denominator is very small. The denominator is smallest when $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$ is close to zero. Since all coefficients are positive, this happens only for $x$ close to 0. Therefore, the main contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the integrand:** For small $x$, the term $9.0 x^{5.0}$ is the dominant part of $f(x)$. So, we can approximate $f(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$. This simplifies the integral to:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.0} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n3.  **Rescale the integral:** To handle the $\\epsilon$ dependency, we use a change of variables. Let $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5} u$. Then $dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5} du$.\n    Substituting this into the approximate integral, the denominator becomes:\n    $\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} = \\epsilon + 9.0 \\left(\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5} u\\right)^{5.0} = \\epsilon + 9.0 \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right) u^{5.0} = \\epsilon(1 + u^{5.0})$.\n\n    The upper limit of integration for $u$ becomes $x=15.0 \\implies u = 15.0 \\left(\\frac{9.0}{\\epsilon}\\right)^{1/5}$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, this upper limit goes to infinity.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the simplified integral:**\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.0 (9/\\epsilon)^{1/5}} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon(1 + u^{5.0})} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5} du$\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9.0}\\right)^{1/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^{5.0}} du$\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\epsilon^{-4/5} (9.0)^{-1/5} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^{5.0}} du$\n\n5.  **Use the standard integral formula:** The definite integral $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+t^n} dt$ has a known value: $\\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$. For our case, $n=5$, so the integral is $\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n6.  **Construct the final formula:** By combining the parts, we get the analytical approximation:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx (9.0)^{-1/5} \\left( \\frac{\\pi/5.0}{\\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\right) \\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n    This is of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\epsilon^{a}$, where we can compute the constants $C$ and $a$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the constants and prints the final formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_approximation_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the constants for the analytical approximation of the integral I(epsilon).\n    The integral is I(epsilon) = integral from 0 to 15 of 1/(epsilon + 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8) dx.\n    For small epsilon, this is approximated by C * epsilon^a.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Parameters from the leading term f(x) approx a * x^p near x=0\n    a = 9.0\n    p = 5.0\n    \n    # The exponent of epsilon in the approximation is -(p-1)/p\n    exponent_val = -(p - 1.0) / p\n    \n    # The coefficient C is given by a^(-1/p) * integral(0,inf) of 1/(1+u^p) du\n    # The integral part is (pi/p)/sin(pi/p)\n    integral_const = (math.pi / p) / math.sin(math.pi / p)\n    coefficient_c = math.pow(a, -1.0 / p) * integral_const\n    \n    # Print the derived analytical formula with the computed constants\n    print(\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) \\u2248 {coefficient_c} * \\u03B5^({exponent_val})\")\n    \nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    get_approximation_formula()\n\n```\n<<<0.6888495029969408>>>"
