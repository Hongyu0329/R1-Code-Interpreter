# The stability operator L for a catenoid is a well-studied object in differential geometry.
# The number of positive eigenvalues of this operator corresponds to the number of ways
# the surface can be varied to decrease its area, a concept known as the stability index.
# For a catenoid, which is a complete minimal hypersurface with two ends and finite total curvature
# in Euclidean space, it is a known theorem that there is exactly one positive eigenvalue
# for its stability operator. This eigenvalue corresponds to the instability associated with
# translations of the catenoid's neck.

# Therefore, the number of positive eigenvalues is 1.

number_of_positive_eigenvalues = 1

# The final answer is the number of positive eigenvalues.
# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# Here, the final result is simply the number 1.
