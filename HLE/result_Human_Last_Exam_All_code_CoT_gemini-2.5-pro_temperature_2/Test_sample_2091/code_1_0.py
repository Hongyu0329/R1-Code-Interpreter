# The poem's form is a double sestina, where the end-words of each stanza
# rotate in a fixed pattern. The prompt states that two lines have been swapped,
# but a check of the end-word pattern reveals it to be perfectly intact.
# This implies the two swapped lines must share the same end-word,
# making the swap invisible to a pattern-only analysis.
#
# By analyzing the content and grammar of the stanzas, the swap can be identified.
#
# Stanza 5 (Strephon's, lines 25-30) appears disjointed.
# Stanza 6 (Klaius's, lines 31-36) is thematically consistent.
#
# Line 26, "Hath made itself a crier of the morning,", is in Strephon's stanza.
# Its subject is ambiguous.
#
# Line 34, "Long since I hate the night, more hate the morning;", is in Klaius's stanza.
#
# Swapping these two lines, which both end in "morning", resolves issues in both stanzas:
# 1. Moving line 34 into Stanza 5 consolidates Strephon's "Long since" complaints.
# 2. Moving line 26 into Stanza 6 gives it a clear subject: Klaius's "strange
#    exclaiming music" from line 32, making the stanza grammatically sound
#    and thematically coherent.
