    The patient has undergone heart valve surgery. A major and life-threatening risk following this procedure, particularly with mechanical valves, is the formation of blood clots on the new valve. These clots can break off and travel to the brain, causing a stroke (a thromboembolic event).

    While other measures like pain control, physical therapy, and dietary advice are important for overall recovery, they do not address this specific, high-stakes risk. The standard of care to prevent this complication is to start the patient on anticoagulation therapy (e.g., blood thinners like Warfarin) or antiplatelet therapy. This is a critical preventative measure that must be initiated before discharge to ensure the patient's safety in the following weeks and months. Therefore, prescribing medication to prevent thrombotic events is the most crucial next step.
