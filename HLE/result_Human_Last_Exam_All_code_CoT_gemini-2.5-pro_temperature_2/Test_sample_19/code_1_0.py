    Analyzes whether Kant's account of aesthetic judgment is descriptive, normative, or both.

    A descriptive account simply explains how things are.
    Kant's theory does this by describing the cognitive faculties (imagination, understanding)
    and their "free play" during an aesthetic experience.

    A normative account prescribes how things should be or sets a standard.
    Kant's theory also does this by establishing the conditions for a "pure judgment of taste."
    For example, he argues a valid aesthetic judgment *must* be disinterested and *must*
    claim universal validity, implying that everyone *ought* to agree.
    This sets a standard for correct judgment, distinguishing it from mere personal preference.

    Therefore, the account is both descriptive and normative.
