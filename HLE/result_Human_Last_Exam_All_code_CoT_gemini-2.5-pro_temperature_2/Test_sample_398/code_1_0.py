    print("Let G be a maximal planar graph on n vertices.")
    print("A maximal planar graph is a planar graph to which no more edges can be added without losing planarity.")

    print("Since G is 'maximally' planar, adding any edge between existing non-adjacent vertices makes it non-planar.")
    print("Therefore, G' is non-planar and cannot be drawn without edge crossings. This rules out choices A and D, which claim G' has a plane drawing.\n")

    print("the crossing number of G' = G + e is exactly one. The final equation is:")

    print("To determine if the one-crossing drawing is unique, let's consider a specific example.")
    print("Let G be the graph K5 - f, where K5 is the complete graph on 5 vertices and f is a single edge. Let's label the vertices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and let the missing edge be f = (4, 5).")

    print("3. Place vertex 5 outside the triangle C and connect it to 1, 2, and 3.")

    print("  Possibility 3: We draw the edge (4, 5) so it crosses edge (3, 1). The single crossing is between {(4, 5), (3, 1)}.\n")

    # Step 6: Conclude.
    print("Since we can create different drawings of G' that each have one crossing (by choosing which edge of G is crossed), the one-crossing drawing is not unique.")
