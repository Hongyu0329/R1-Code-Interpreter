    # Explanation of the biological context
    explanation = """
    1.  Context: Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by an unstable CTG repeat expansion. This repeat tract is somatically unstable, meaning it tends to get longer in certain cells over a person's lifetime, which worsens the disease. This expansion process is linked to DNA replication and repair.

    2.  Role of LIG1: LIG1 (DNA Ligase I) is a key enzyme in DNA replication. Its job is to seal the final gaps (nicks) between Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of newly synthesized DNA.

    3.  Mechanism of Instability: The CTG repeats on the lagging strand can form secondary structures, like hairpins, in the transient gaps before LIG1 seals them. These hairpins can be processed incorrectly by the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) machinery, leading to an expansion of the repeat count.

    4.  Impact of LIG1 Knockout/Reduction: Studies using mouse models of DM1 have shown that reducing LIG1 function has a profound effect.
        - A complete, systemic LIG1 knockout is lethal, so experiments use models with reduced function (hypomorphs).
        - In these models, reducing LIG1 activity dramatically suppresses the expansion of the CTG repeats.
        - Instead of causing more errors, the lack of LIG1 disrupts the expansion-prone repair pathway. The persistent DNA nicks are thought to be handled by other pathways that resolve the hairpins correctly, leading to a stabilization or even a contraction (shortening) of the repeat tract.

    5.  Conclusion: Therefore, knocking down LIG1 reduces the overall somatic instability of the CTG repeat.
