    print("--- Step 1: Understanding the question ---")
    print("The question asks if a special type of function, f, can exist.")
    print("Let's define the function and its property:")
    print("  - κ (kappa) is an infinite cardinal number.")
    print("  - The function f maps pairs of ordinals below κ⁺⁺ to ordinals below κ.")
    print("    In notation: f: [κ⁺⁺]² → κ")
    print("  - The required property: For EVERY subset 'x' of κ⁺⁺ that has an order type of κ⁺ + κ,")
    print("    the number of distinct values f takes on pairs from 'x' must be exactly κ.")
    print("    In notation: |f''[x]²| = κ")
    print("The question also assumes the existence of a κ⁺-Kurepa tree.")

    print("\n--- Step 2: Rephrasing the question using Partition Calculus ---")
    print("The existence of such a function 'f' is a negative partition property (an 'anti-Ramsey' property).")
    print("It claims that it's possible to color pairs from κ⁺⁺ with κ colors in such a way that no set 'x' of type κ⁺ + κ is 'almost monochromatic' (i.e., uses fewer than κ colors).")
    print("In partition calculus notation, the existence of such a function 'f' would mean:")
    print("  κ⁺⁺ ↛ (κ⁺ + κ)²_{<κ}")
    print("(This reads: κ⁺⁺ does not arrow κ⁺ + κ, with 2-element subsets, and a set of image cardinalities less than κ)")

    print("\n--- Step 3: Checking the negation and applying a ZFC theorem ---")
    print("Let's consider the opposite statement (the positive partition relation):")
    print("  κ⁺⁺ → (κ⁺ + κ)²_{<κ}")
    print("This statement means that for ANY function f: [κ⁺⁺]² → κ, there ALWAYS exists a set 'x' of type κ⁺ + κ where the number of colors used is less than κ (i.e., |f''[x]²| < κ).")
    print("\nA deep theorem by Saharon Shelah, a leading set theorist, proves that this positive partition relation is TRUE for any infinite cardinal κ.")
    print("This result is a theorem of ZFC, the standard axiomatic system for mathematics. It doesn't require any extra assumptions.")

    print("\n--- Step 4: Drawing the conclusion ---")
    print("Since Shelah's theorem is true in ZFC, it means that for any function f we try to construct, we will always fail. There will always be a counterexample set 'x' of type κ⁺ + κ that gets colored with fewer than κ colors.")
    print("Therefore, a function 'f' satisfying the condition for ALL such sets 'x' can never exist.")
    print("\nThe assumption about the existence of a κ⁺-Kurepa tree is extraneous information. While this assumption has other important consequences in set theory, it cannot contradict a theorem of ZFC. The conclusion holds regardless of this assumption.")
    print("\nBased on this reasoning, the correct answer is that such a function can never exist.")
