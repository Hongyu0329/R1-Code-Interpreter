    "To design a deadbeat observer, we need to find an observer gain matrix `L` such that the state estimation error `e(k)` converges to zero in the shortest possible time. The error dynamics are described by the equation `e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)`. To make the error vanish as quickly as possible, we should place all the eigenvalues (poles) of the error dynamics matrix `(A - LC)` at the origin (i.e., make them all zero).\n\nThis is a pole placement problem. This problem is dual to the state-feedback control problem. We can solve it by finding a state-feedback gain `K_obs` for the dual system, which is described by matrices `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`. The objective is to place the poles of `A_d - B_d * K_obs` at zero. The desired observer gain `L` is then the transpose of `K_obs`, i.e., `L = K_obs^T`.\n\nThe prerequisite for being able to place the poles arbitrarily is that the system must be observable. For the given system, the observability matrix has a full rank of 4, so the system is indeed observable.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `control` library, a standard tool for control systems analysis and design, to perform the pole placement for the dual system and determine the observer gain `L`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport control as ct\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Designs a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the system matrices\n    A = np.array([\n        [-1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [1, 0, 0, 2],\n        [0, 1, 0, -1],\n        [-1, 0, 1, -1]\n    ])\n\n    C = np.array([\n        [1, 0, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # For observer pole placement, we use the dual system (A.T, C.T)\n    # This is equivalent to finding a feedback gain K for A' - C'K\n    A_dual = A.T\n    B_dual = C.T\n\n    # We want to place all observer poles at 0 for a deadbeat response\n    desired_poles = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n\n    # Use a pole placement algorithm to find the gain for the dual system\n    # The place function finds K such that eigenvalues of (A - BK) are desired_poles\n    # Here, our A is A_dual and B is B_dual\n    K_obs = ct.place(A_dual, B_dual, desired_poles)\n\n    # The observer gain L is the transpose of the calculated gain K_obs\n    L = K_obs.T\n\n    print(\"The observer gain matrix L is:\")\n    print(L)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<[[ 0.3125 -1.3125]\n [-2.1875 -2.8125]\n [-2.625   0.625 ]\n [ 3.5     1.5   ]]>>>"
