    Analyzes the Pioneer probe's energy ball container problem to find a more efficient design.

    The function determines the capacity and surface area of the initial 12x12x12 cm box.
    It then searches for a new rectangular box with dimensions (L, W, H) that:
    1. Has a smaller surface area than the initial box.
    2. Can contain at least the same number of energy balls (radius 2 cm).
    3. Has dimensions and ball center coordinates that are multiples of 0.5 cm.

    The core of the problem lies in the packing constraints. To fit 'n' balls along an
    axis, a certain length is required. For 3 balls, the centers can be placed at
    2, 6, and 10 cm. The last ball (center at 10) has a radius of 2 and extends to 12 cm.
    Therefore, fitting 3 balls along an axis requires a minimum length of 12 cm.

    Since the initial box holds 3x3x3 = 27 balls, any new box holding 27 balls
    in a 3x3x3 grid must have dimensions of at least 12x12x12 cm. A box with
    these dimensions has a surface area of 864 cm^2, offering no improvement.

    Other packing arrangements (e.g., a 2x3x5 grid = 30 balls) result in less
    cube-like shapes, which have a larger surface area for a similar volume,
    making them less efficient in terms of material usage.

    After analyzing various packing strategies under the given constraints (axis-aligned box,
    0.5 cm grid for centers), it's concluded that no box with a smaller surface
    area can be designed.

    # 3. Reasoning for the final answer
    # A packing of 3 spheres along an axis requires a length of at least 12cm.
    # Proof:
    # Let centers be c1, c2, c3. Radii r=2. Coordinates are multiples of 0.5.
    # Constraint 1: c1 >= r = 2
    # Constraint 2: c2 - c1 >= 2*r = 4
    # Constraint 3: c3 - c2 >= 2*r = 4
    # To minimize the final center position c3:
    # c3 = c1 + (c2-c1) + (c3-c2)
    # The minimal values are c1=2, c2-c1=4, c3-c2=4.
    # This gives centers at c1=2, c2=6, c3=10.
    # The box must contain the full extent of the last sphere.
    # Box Length L >= c3 + r = 10 + 2 = 12.
    # So, to pack a 3x3x3 grid of 27 balls, the box must be at least 12x12x12 cm.

    # Any box with L, W, H >= 12 will have a surface area >= 864 cm^2.
    # Exploring packing more balls (e.g., 28+) results in less cubical shapes which have
    # even larger surface areas (e.g., an 8x8x28 box for a 2x2x7 grid has SA=1024).

    # Conclusion: No better design is possible under the given constraints.
