    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Cubes in a Coordinate System:** I will start by defining the position and size of the first cube. The simplest approach is to place one of its corners at the origin (0, 0, 0). Since its side length is 1, this cube will occupy the space where `0 <= x <= 1`, `0 <= y <= 1`, and `0 <= z <= 1`.\n\n2.  **Interpret and Apply the Shift:** The problem describes the second cube as being \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" relative to the first. For the cube at `[0,1]x[0,1]x[0,1]`, the main diagonal vector is (1, 1, 1). A shift of 1/2 \"along\" this diagonal is interpreted as a shift vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). I will apply this shift to the first cube's coordinates to find the position of the second cube.\n\n3.  **Determine the Intersection Region:** The intersection is the volume of space where both cubes exist simultaneously. This intersection will form a smaller cube. To find its boundaries, I will calculate the overlapping interval for each of the x, y, and z coordinates. The start of the overlap is the maximum of the two cubes' starting coordinates, and the end is the minimum of their ending coordinates.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Volume:** From the boundaries of the intersection cube, I can find its side lengths. The volume is then simply the product of these three side lengths.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the volume.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_intersection_volume():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two shifted cubes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
