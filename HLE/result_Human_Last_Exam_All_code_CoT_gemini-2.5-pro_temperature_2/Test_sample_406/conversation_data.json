    "An FGH-tripled fixed point is a point `(x, y, z)` that simultaneously satisfies a system of three equations involving three functions F, G, and H. The existence and uniqueness of such a point can be guaranteed under specific contractive conditions on the functions, which are a generalization of the well-known Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  **Define the Mathematical Setting**: The foundation for these conditions rests on the functions operating on complete metric spaces. I will define the functions and spaces involved, clarifying a likely typo in the problem description.\n2.  **Define the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**: I will state the system of equations that a point `(x, y, z)` must satisfy to be considered an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n3.  **State the Contractive Conditions**: The core of the solution is a set of \"contraction\" inequalities that the functions F, G, and H must satisfy. These inequalities limit how much the functions can increase the \"distance\" between any two points in their domain.\n4.  **Present the Final Conditions in Code**: To meet the prompt's requirements, I will write a Python script whose sole purpose is to `print` a clear, formatted explanation of these mathematical conditions. This script will explicitly print the numbers in the final equations as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that explains and presents the conditions:\n```python\ndef explain_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an\n    FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    A set of conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point\n    can be derived using the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem on a product space.\n\n    ---\n    1. The Setting\n    ---\n    - Let (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) be complete metric spaces.\n    - Let F, G, and H be the three functions with the following signatures:\n        F: X × Y × Z → X\n        G: Y × X × Y → Y\n        H: Z × Y × X → Z\n      (Note: The problem description listed 'G' twice. We assume the third function is\n      'H' for clarity, as its domain and codomain are distinct from the second function's.)\n\n    ---\n    2. Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n    ---\n    An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triple (x, y, z) where x ∈ X, y ∈ Y, z ∈ Z, that\n    satisfies the following system of equations:\n    \"\"\"\n\n    fixed_point_equations = \"\"\"\n      F(x, y, z) = x\n      G(y, x, y) = y\n      H(z, y, x) = z\n    \"\"\"\n\n    conditions_intro = \"\"\"\n    ---\n    3. The Conditions\n    ---\n    For an FGH-tripled fixed point to be guaranteed to exist and be unique, the functions\n    F, G, and H must be 'contractions' in a specific sense. This means there must exist\n    non-negative constants (a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, a3, b3, c3) such that for any two points\n    (x, y, z) and (u, v, w) in X × Y × Z, the following inequalities hold:\n\n    A. Function Contraction Inequalities:\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    inequalities = \"\"\"\n      (1) d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ a1*d_X(x, u) + b1*d_Y(y, v) + c1*d_Z(z, w)\n      (2) d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ a2*d_X(x, u) + b2*d_Y(y, v)\n      (3) d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ a3*d_X(x, u) + b3*d_Y(y, v) + c3*d_Z(z, w)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    constants_intro = \"\"\"\n    B. Conditions on the Constants:\n    The collection of all these constants must ensure that a combined mapping on the\n    product space X × Y × Z is a contraction. This leads to the following final\n    conditions on the sums of the coefficients for each dimension. Each sum must be\n    less than the number 1.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    constants_conditions = f\"\"\"\n      a1 + a2 + a3 < {1}\n      b1 + b2 + b3 < {1}\n      c1 + 0 + c3 < {1}  (The 'c' coefficient for G is 0 as its output doesn't depend on an input from Z)\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"Fixed-Point Equations:\")\n    print(fixed_point_equations)\n    print(conditions_intro)\n    print(inequalities)\n    print(constants_intro)\n    print(\"Final Conditions (The numbers in the final equations):\")\n    print(constants_conditions)\n\nexplain_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions()\n```\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` exists and is unique if `(X,d_X), (Y,d_Y), (Z,d_Z)` are complete metric spaces and the functions `F: X*Y*Z→X`, `G: Y*X*Y→Y`, `H: Z*Y*X→Z` satisfy a set of contraction inequalities `d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ a1*d_X(x, u) + b1*d_Y(y, v) + c1*d_Z(z, w)`, `d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ a2*d_X(x, u) + b2*d_Y(y, v)`, and `d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ a3*d_X(x, u) + b3*d_Y(y, v) + c3*d_Z(z, w)`, where the non-negative constants `a_i, b_i, c_i` satisfy `a1+a2+a3 < 1`, `b1+b2+b3 < 1`, and `c1+c3 < 1`.>>>"
