    explanation = """
    A set of conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point
    can be derived using the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem on a product space.

    ---
    1. The Setting
    ---
    - Let (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) be complete metric spaces.
    - Let F, G, and H be the three functions with the following signatures:
        F: X × Y × Z → X
        G: Y × X × Y → Y
        H: Z × Y × X → Z
      (Note: The problem description listed 'G' twice. We assume the third function is
      'H' for clarity, as its domain and codomain are distinct from the second function's.)

    ---
    2. Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point
    ---
    An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triple (x, y, z) where x ∈ X, y ∈ Y, z ∈ Z, that
    satisfies the following system of equations:
    """

    fixed_point_equations = """
      F(x, y, z) = x
      G(y, x, y) = y
      H(z, y, x) = z
    """

    conditions_intro = """
    ---
    3. The Conditions
    ---
    For an FGH-tripled fixed point to be guaranteed to exist and be unique, the functions
    F, G, and H must be 'contractions' in a specific sense. This means there must exist
    non-negative constants (a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, a3, b3, c3) such that for any two points
    (x, y, z) and (u, v, w) in X × Y × Z, the following inequalities hold:

    A. Function Contraction Inequalities:
    """
    
    inequalities = """
      (1) d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ a1*d_X(x, u) + b1*d_Y(y, v) + c1*d_Z(z, w)
      (2) d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ a2*d_X(x, u) + b2*d_Y(y, v)
      (3) d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ a3*d_X(x, u) + b3*d_Y(y, v) + c3*d_Z(z, w)
    """

    constants_intro = """
    B. Conditions on the Constants:
    The collection of all these constants must ensure that a combined mapping on the
    product space X × Y × Z is a contraction. This leads to the following final
    conditions on the sums of the coefficients for each dimension. Each sum must be
    less than the number 1.

      b1 + b2 + b3 < {1}
      c1 + 0 + c3 < {1}  (The 'c' coefficient for G is 0 as its output doesn't depend on an input from Z)
