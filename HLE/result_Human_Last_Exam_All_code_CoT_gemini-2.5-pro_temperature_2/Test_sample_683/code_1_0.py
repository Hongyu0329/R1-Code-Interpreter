# The final product is a result of a pinacol rearrangement.
# The reaction involves the expansion of a five-membered ring into a six-membered ring,
# resulting in a spirocyclic compound.

# The name is constructed as follows:
# 'spiro' indicates a spirocyclic compound.
# '[4.5]' indicates the number of carbons in each ring, excluding the shared spiro carbon
# (4 carbons in the five-membered ring part, 5 in the six-membered ring part).
# 'decan' indicates a total of 10 carbons.
# '-6-one' indicates a ketone functional group at position 6, according to IUPAC spiro numbering rules.
