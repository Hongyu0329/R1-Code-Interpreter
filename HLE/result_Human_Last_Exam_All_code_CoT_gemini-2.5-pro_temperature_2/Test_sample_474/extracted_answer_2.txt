The described research approach is not ecologically valid. The primary selective pressure for mimicry syndromes in Bombus species comes from avian predators, not humans. Human vision (trichromatic) is a poor proxy for avian vision (often tetrachromatic, including UV perception), so what appears similar to a human may not appear similar to the predator that drives the evolution of the mimicry. Therefore, the resulting clusters would not reliably represent ecologically functional mimicry syndromes.
