    # Explain the core CARS process
    print("1. In standard CARS (Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering), two laser beams (pump and Stokes) excite a specific molecular vibration.")
    print("   A probe beam then scatters off this vibration, creating an 'anti-Stokes' signal at a new, higher frequency.")
    print("   The signal's strength tells you how much of that specific molecule is present.\n")

    # Explain the "broadband" aspect
    print("2. In 'Broadband' CARS, the goal is to measure many different molecular vibrations at once, not just one.")
    print("   This is achieved by using a laser source with a wide range of frequencies (a broadband spectrum).")
    print("   This allows the system to simultaneously match and excite a whole range of different vibrational frequencies (Ω1, Ω2, Ω3, etc.) present in the sample.\n")

    # Describe the resulting signal
    print("3. Because multiple different vibrations are excited simultaneously, multiple different anti-Stokes signals are generated simultaneously.")
    print("   Each generated signal has a unique frequency corresponding to the specific vibration that created it.")
    print("   The total anti-Stokes beam is therefore a spectrum of light, where each 'color' or frequency in the beam carries information about a distinct molecular vibration.\n")

    # Conclude and evaluate choices
    print("### Conclusion ###")
    print("The anti-Stokes beam is not a single, uniform beam. Instead, it is a composite signal that can be separated by a spectrometer to reveal a vibrational spectrum.")
    print("Therefore, the generated anti-Stokes beam contains distinguishable information about the different chemical bonds in the sample.\n")

    # Print final answer based on evaluation
    print("Based on this analysis, the correct answer is C.")
