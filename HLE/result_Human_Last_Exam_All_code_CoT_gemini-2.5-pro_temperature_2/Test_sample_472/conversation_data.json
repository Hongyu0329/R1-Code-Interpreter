    "Of course, I can help with that. To scan the line of Latin poetry, we must identify each syllable as either long (L) or short (S) based on the rules of Latin prosody and then group these syllables into metrical feet.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the scansion of \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\":\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Elision:** First, we break the line into its basic syllables. We also look for elisions, where a word ending in a vowel or '-m' is followed by a word starting with a vowel.\n    *   The line is: `et ti-bi be-ne es-se so-li quom si-bi sit ma-le`.\n    *   There is one elision: the final `-e` of `bene` is dropped because the next word, `esse`, begins with a vowel. The line is scanned as if it were `...ben' esse...`. After elision, the line has 14 syllables.\n\n2.  **Determine Syllable Quantity:** We apply the rules of prosody to determine if each syllable is long or short.\n    *   A syllable is long by nature if its vowel is long (e.g., `sōlī`).\n    *   A syllable is long by position if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants.\n    *   Otherwise, the syllable is short.\n\n3.  **Scan the Line:**\n    *   `et tibi`: The syllable `et` is **L** (long by position, as the vowel `e` is followed by the consonant `t` and the `t` of `tibi`). The syllables in `tibi` (`ti-` and `-bi`) are both **S** (short by nature and in an open syllable). This gives us the foot **L S S**.\n    *   `bene esse`: With elision, this is pronounced `ben' esse`. Syllabified, this becomes `ben-es-se`. The syllable `ben-` is **L** (long by position, as `e` is followed by `n` and `s`). The syllables `-es-` and `-se` are both **S**. This gives the foot **L S S**.\n    *   `soli`: This is the dative of `sōlus`, and both the `o` and `i` are naturally long. This gives the foot **L L**.\n    *   `quom sibi`: The syllable `quom` is **L** (long by position, as `o` is followed by `m` and the `s` of `sibi`). The syllables in `sibi` are both **S**. This gives the foot **L S S**.\n    *   `sit male`: The syllable `sit` is **L** (long by position, as `i` is followed by `t` and the `m` of `male`). The `a` in `male` is naturally short (**S**). The final `-e` is also short (**S**). This allows the foot to resolve as a dactyl to fit the meter. This gives the foot **L S S**.\n\n4.  **Identify the Meter:** The pattern of feet is Dactyl (LSS) | Dactyl (LSS) | Spondee (LL) | Dactyl (LSS) | Dactyl (LSS). This is a line of Dactylic Pentameter.\n\nThe following Python code will print the final scansion.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the scansion of a given Latin line from Catullus.\n    L = Long syllable\n    S = Short syllable\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n    \n    # The words are grouped by metrical foot based on the analysis.\n    feet_words = [\"et tibi\", \"bene esse\", \"soli\", \"quom sibi\", \"sit male\"]\n    \n    # The scansion for each foot.\n    feet_scansion = [\"L S S\", \"L S S\", \"L L\", \"L S S\", \"L S S\"]\n\n    print(f\"Line: {line}\\n\")\n    print(\"Scansion:\")\n\n    # Print the feet with the corresponding words and scansion aligned.\n    header = \" | \".join(f\"{word:<10}\" for word in feet_words)\n    scansion_line = \" | \".join(f\"{scansion:<10}\" for scansion in feet_scansion)\n    \n    print(header)\n    print(scansion_line)\n\nscan_latin_line()\n<<<L S S | L S S | L L | L S S | L S S>>>\n```"
