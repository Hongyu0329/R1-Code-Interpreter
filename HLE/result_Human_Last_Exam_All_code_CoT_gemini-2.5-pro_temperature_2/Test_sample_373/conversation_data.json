    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph Structure:** The problem specifies a barbell graph with 10 nodes. A barbell graph is constructed by taking two identical complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge. With 10 nodes in total, this means we have two 5-node cliques (K5) connected by one edge, which is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Understand the Sampling Process:** In randomized uniform gossiping, a single round consists of two steps:\n    *   First, a node is selected uniformly at random from the set of all N nodes (here, N=10).\n    *   Second, the selected node chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to interact with.\n3.  **Identify the Event of Interest:** We want to find the probability that the sampled edge is the bottleneck edge. Let's call the two nodes connected by this edge Node A and Node B. This event can happen in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    *   Case 1: Node A is chosen first, and it then selects Node B.\n    *   Case 2: Node B is chosen first, and it then selects Node A.\n4.  **Calculate Probabilities:**\n    *   The degree of the bottleneck nodes (A and B) must be calculated. Each is connected to 4 other nodes within its 5-node clique and to 1 node via the bottleneck edge. So, `degree(A) = degree(B) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   The probability for Case 1 is: `P(pick A) * P(A chooses B) = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree(A))`.\n    *   The probability for Case 2 is: `P(pick B) * P(B chooses A) = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree(B))`.\n    *   The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this logic, calculate the final probability, and print the full equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\n# Define the parameters of the barbell graph\ntotal_nodes = 10\n# The graph consists of two equal-sized cliques\nclique_size = total_nodes // 2\n\n# Calculate the degree of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n# Each of these nodes is connected to (clique_size - 1) nodes within its clique,\n# plus 1 connection via the bottleneck edge.\ndegree_of_bottleneck_node = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n# In randomized uniform gossiping, the probability of sampling an edge (A, B) is:\n# P(A is chosen) * P(A chooses B) + P(B is chosen) * P(B chooses A)\n# which is (1/N) * (1/deg(A)) + (1/N) * (1/deg(B))\n\n# Calculate the probability\nprob_pick_node = fractions.Fraction(1, total_nodes)\nprob_node_chooses_neighbor = fractions.Fraction(1, degree_of_bottleneck_node)\n\nprob_one_way = prob_pick_node * prob_node_chooses_neighbor\ntotal_prob = 2 * prob_one_way\n\n# Print the step-by-step derivation of the formula\nprint(\"The probability 'P' of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of two cases:\")\nprint(\"1. Picking the first bottleneck node and it choosing the second.\")\nprint(\"2. Picking the second bottleneck node and it choosing the first.\")\nprint(\"\\nP = P(pick node A) * P(A chooses B) + P(pick node B) * P(B chooses A)\")\nprint(f\"P = (1/{total_nodes}) * (1/{degree_of_bottleneck_node}) + (1/{total_nodes}) * (1/{degree_of_bottleneck_node})\")\nprint(f\"P = {prob_one_way} + {prob_one_way}\")\nprint(f\"P = {total_prob}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe final probability is {float(total_prob)}\")\n```\n<<<0.04>>>"
