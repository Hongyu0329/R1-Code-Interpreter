kag1_monomer_mass = 32350  # Mass of Kag1 in CHAPS (Da)
kag1_og_complex_mass = 101553 # Mass of Kag1 in OG (Da)

# The prompt states a molecule of 15001 Da was detected in negative ion mode.
# This is likely a typo for a lipid mass, such as cardiolipin (~1500 Da).
# Let's calculate the expected mass of the bound molecule.
# First, we determine the number of Kag1 units in the complex.
oligomeric_state_ratio = kag1_og_complex_mass / kag1_monomer_mass
# Since the ratio is ~3.14, we can assume the complex is a trimer (3 units) of Kag1.
num_kag1_units = 3

# Calculate the mass of the protein-only trimer
kag1_trimer_mass = num_kag1_units * kag1_monomer_mass

# Calculate the remaining mass, which must be from bound molecules (lipids)
mass_of_bound_molecules = kag1_og_complex_mass - kag1_trimer_mass

# The data suggests the complex is a trimer with additional molecules.
# If we assume there are 3 bound lipid molecules (one per protein unit),
# we can calculate the mass of a single lipid.
num_lipids = 3
calculated_lipid_mass = mass_of_bound_molecules / num_lipids
