    Calculates the number of codimension 2 boundary strata of M_bar_{3,1}.

    A boundary stratum's codimension is the number of nodes on the generic curve
    it parameterizes. We are looking for strata with k=2 nodes.

    The arithmetic genus g of a connected nodal curve is given by the formula:
    g = sum(g_i) + k - |V| + 1
    where g_i are the geometric genera of the irreducible components, k is the
    number of nodes, and |V| is the number of components.

    For g=3 and k=2, this simplifies to:
    3 = sum(g_i) + 2 - |V| + 1  =>  sum(g_i) = |V|.

    The stability condition for a component C_i with genus g_i and n_i special
    points (nodes or marked points) is:
    - If g_i = 0, we need n_i >= 3.
    - If g_i = 1, we need n_i >= 1.
    - If g_i > 1, the component is always stable.
