    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step reasoning that leads to the answer, presented as a Python script.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum generalised hypertreewidth (ghtw) for a hypergraph with exactly 3 hyperedges, `H = (V, E)` where `E = {e1, e2, e3}`. The size of the hyperedges (the rank) can be arbitrarily large.\n\n**Our Plan:**\n1.  **Establish an upper bound:** We will show that for any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, its ghtw is at most 3.\n2.  **Establish a lower bound:** We will construct a specific hypergraph with 3 hyperedges and prove that its ghtw is at least 3.\n3.  **Conclude:** If the ghtw is always `<= 3` and we have an example where it is `>= 3`, then the maximum possible value must be exactly 3.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hypertreewidth():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the reasoning to find the maximum generalised hypertreewidth\n    of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Establishing the Upper Bound for the Generalised Hypertreewidth (ghtw).\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n    print(\"Let H = (V, E) be any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, so E = {e1, e2, e3}.\")\n    print(\"The definition of generalised hypertreewidth relies on finding a tree decomposition with the minimum possible width.\")\n    print(\"We can always construct a simple tree decomposition consisting of a single node 't'.\")\n    print(\"For this decomposition to be valid, its single bag, chi(t), must cover all hyperedges.\")\n    print(\"We can choose the bag to be the set of all vertices in the hypergraph: chi(t) = V(H).\")\n    print(\"\\nWith this bag, two properties must hold:\")\n    print(\"1.
