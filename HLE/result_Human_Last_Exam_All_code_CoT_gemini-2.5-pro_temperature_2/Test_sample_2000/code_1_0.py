    print("1. For every edge e in E, e is a subset of chi(t). This is true by our definition of chi(t).")
    print("2. For every vertex v in V, the set of nodes {t' | v in chi(t')} forms a subtree. This is trivially true as there is only one node.")
    print("\nThe width of this decomposition is the size of the set lambda(t) = {e in E | e intersects chi(t)}.")
    print("Since chi(t) contains all vertices, and hyperedges are non-empty, our bag chi(t) will intersect all 3 hyperedges.")

    print("----------------------------------------------------\n")

    print("If t is in T_v1 and T_v2, then {v1, v2} is a subset of chi(t).")
    print("  - Because v1 is in e1 and e3, chi(t) must intersect e1 and e3.")
    print("  - Because v2 is in e1 and e2, chi(t) must intersect e1 and e2.")
    print("  - Therefore, chi(t) intersects all three hyperedges: e1, e2, and e3.")
    print("  - This would make the width |lambda(t)| = 3, which contradicts our assumption of width <= 2.")
    print("  - Thus, the intersection of T_v1 and T_v2 must be empty.")
    print("\nBy the same logic, T_v1, T_v2, and T_v3 must be pairwise disjoint.")
    print("\nNow, consider the edge covering property of a valid decomposition:")
    print("The hyperedge e1 = {v1, v2} must be fully contained in some bag chi(t_e1).")

    print("So, the node t_e1 must be in T_v1 and in T_v2. This implies the intersection of T_v1 and T_v2 is non-empty.")
