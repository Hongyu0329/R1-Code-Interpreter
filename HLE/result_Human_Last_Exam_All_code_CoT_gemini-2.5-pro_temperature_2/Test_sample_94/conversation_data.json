    "This is a knowledge-based question. The physicist who is best known for his work in the microscopy field and who discovered the phase-contrast optical effect after it was accidentally observed on cleaned concave mirrors is Frits Zernike. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope.\n\nI will provide a simple Python script to output the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_physicist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the physicist based on the clues provided.\n    \n    Clues:\n    1. Better known for work in the microscopy field.\n    2. Discovered an optical effect in real imagery.\n    3. Discovery was inspired by an accidental observation on cleaned concave mirrors.\n    \n    The answer is Frits Zernike, who developed phase-contrast microscopy.\n    \"\"\"\n    physicist_name = \"Frits Zernike\"\n    print(f\"The physicist who discovered an optical effect after it was observed on cleaned concave mirrors is: {physicist_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_physicist()\n```\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which physicist better known for work in the microscopy field discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
