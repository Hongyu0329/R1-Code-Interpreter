    "To find an analytical expression for the solution of the given differential equation in the large $x$ regimes, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the ODE and Initial Conditions**: The equation is $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$. The initial conditions $y(0)=0$, $y'(0)=3$, and $y''(0)=2$ indicate that the solution starts increasing from the origin. The high-power nonlinear terms $y^4$ and $(y')^4$ suggest that the solution is likely to grow very fast and diverge at a finite value of $x$, say $x_0$. This is known as a \"finite-time blow-up\". In this context, the \"large $x$ regime\" is interpreted as the behavior of the solution as $x$ approaches this singularity $x_0$.\n\n2.  **Apply Dominant Balance**: Near the singularity at $x_0$, the terms involving $y$ and its derivatives are expected to become infinitely large. Compared to them, the other terms in the ODE, $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ and $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$, become negligible. The governing equation simplifies to a balance between the most singular terms: $y''' \\approx y^4 + (y')^4$.\n\n3.  **Posit an Ansatz**: For a blow-up singularity at $x=x_0$, the solution can be approximated by the form $y(x) \\approx A(x_0 - x)^\\alpha$.\n\n4.  **Find the Dominant Balance and Solve**:\n    *   We substitute the ansatz into the simplified ODE. The corresponding terms are:\n        *   $y''' \\approx -A\\alpha(\\alpha-1)(\\alpha-2)(x_0-x)^{\\alpha-3}$\n        *   $y^4 \\approx A^4(x_0-x)^{4\\alpha}$\n        *   $(y')^4 \\approx (-A\\alpha(x_0-x)^{\\alpha-1})^4 = A^4\\alpha^4(x_0-x)^{4\\alpha-4}$\n    *   As $x \\to x_0$, $(x_0-x) \\to 0$. The term with the most negative exponent will dominate. Since $4\\alpha - 4 < 4\\alpha$, the term $(y')^4$ dominates over $y^4$.\n    *   Thus, the dominant balance is $y''' \\approx (y')^4$.\n    *   Equating the powers of $(x_0-x)$:\n        $\\alpha - 3 = 4\\alpha - 4 \\implies 3\\alpha = 1 \\implies \\alpha = 1/3$.\n    *   Equating the coefficients:\n        $-A\\alpha(\\alpha-1)(\\alpha-2) = A^4\\alpha^4$.\n        For a non-trivial solution ($A\\neq 0, \\alpha\\neq0$), we can simplify this to:\n        $-(\\alpha-1)(\\alpha-2) = A^3\\alpha^3$.\n        Substituting $\\alpha=1/3$, we solve for $A^3$:\n        $-(1/3 - 1)(1/3 - 2) = A^3(1/3)^3$\n        $-(-2/3)(-5/3) = A^3/27$\n        $-10/9 = A^3/27 \\implies A^3 = -30$.\n        This gives $A = (-30)^{1/3}$.\n\n5.  **Final Expression**: The following Python code will calculate the value for the constant $A$, round it to two decimal places as requested, and then print the final analytical approximation for $y(x)$. The term $x_0$ remains an undetermined constant, representing the location of the singularity, which would depend on the initial conditions.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_asymptotic_ode():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the parameters of the asymptotic solution for the given ODE.\n    The solution is assumed to be of the form y(x) = A * (x_0 - x)^alpha.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # As derived from the dominant balance analysis, the exponent alpha is 1/3.\n    alpha_numerator = 1\n    alpha_denominator = 3\n    alpha = alpha_numerator / alpha_denominator\n\n    # As derived from the coefficient balance, A^3 = -30.\n    A_cubed = -30\n    \n    # Calculate A\n    A = math.copysign(1.0, A_cubed) * (abs(A_cubed))**alpha\n\n    # Round A to two decimal places as requested\n    A_rounded = round(A, 2)\n    \n    # Print the parameters\n    print(f\"The analysis leads to the following parameters for the asymptotic solution y(x) = A * (x_0 - x)^alpha:\")\n    print(f\"alpha = {alpha_numerator}/{alpha_denominator}\")\n    print(f\"A = (-30)^(1/3) which is approximately {A:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Rounding A to two decimal places gives {A_rounded}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    \n    # Construct and print the final expression for y(x).\n    # The term x_0 is an integration constant determined by the initial conditions.\n    # The output format follows the requirement to show each number in the equation.\n    print(\"The final analytical expression that approximates the solution in the large x regime (approaching the singularity) is:\")\n    \n    # Creating the equation string with the required numbers\n    final_equation = f\"y(x) = {A_rounded} * (x_0 - x)^({alpha_numerator}/{alpha_denominator})\"\n    \n    print(final_equation)\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the solution\nsolve_asymptotic_ode()\n```\n<<<y(x) = -3.11 * (x_0 - x)^(1/3)>>>"
