    "The user wants me to identify the major product of an organic chemistry reaction and present the reasoning and answer using a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. I need to determine its structure, specifically its stereochemistry (cis/trans) and its preferred chair conformation.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol. This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The conditions (alkyl halide + strong base) strongly suggest an E2 elimination reaction.\n\n2.  **Determine Substrate Stereochemistry:**\n    *   By assigning R/S configurations to chair conformations or by using the wedge/dash notation, I will determine the relative orientation of the bromo and methyl groups. (1S, 2R) on a cyclohexane ring corresponds to the **trans** isomer.\n    *   A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations: one with both substituents equatorial (diequatorial) and one with both substituents axial (diaxial).\n    *   The diequatorial conformer is significantly more stable and will be the predominant form of the starting material at equilibrium.\n\n3.  **Apply E2 Elimination Rules:**\n    *   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed (a β-proton) must be **anti-periplanar**.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair, this means both the leaving group and the β-proton must be in **axial** positions.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction cannot proceed from the stable diequatorial conformer. The molecule must first ring-flip into the much less stable, but reactive, diaxial conformer.\n\n4.  **Identify the Product:**\n    *   In the reactive diaxial conformer, the bromine is axial. I need to check the β-protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is also axial, which means the hydrogen on C2 is equatorial. There is no axial hydrogen on C2 to eliminate.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has an axial hydrogen which is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n    *   Elimination is only possible between C1 and C6. The base will abstract the axial proton from C6, and the bromine will leave, forming a double bond between C1 and C6.\n    *   This results in the formation of **1-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:**\n    *   The Python script will not perform calculations but will use `print` statements to narrate the logical steps outlined above.\n    *   It will define the reactants, explain the mechanism's requirements, analyze the conformations, and state the final product's name, ensuring the number '1' is explicitly printed.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium\n    tert-butoxide and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
