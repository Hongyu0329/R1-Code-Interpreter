    # Part (a): Is it true that an even unimodular lattice of rank 12 can have farness exactly 2?
    # A well-known theorem in the theory of integral lattices states that the rank of an even
    # unimodular lattice must be a multiple of 8. Since 12 is not a multiple of 8,
    # no even unimodular lattice of rank 12 exists.
    # The question is about the existence of such a lattice with a given property.
    # Since no such lattice exists, the statement is false.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b): Suppose L is an odd unimodular lattice of rank 14 with far(L) = 3. 
    # Can L have a vector x such that x*x is divisible by 6 and x is a 3-primitive vector?
    # By definition, far(L) = 3 means L is a 3-neighbor of Z^14. This implies that there exists
    # a 3-primitive vector v in L such that its norm v*v is a multiple of 3.
    # A vector v is 3-primitive in L if v/3 is not an element of L. Let v*v = 3k for some integer k.
    # Let's construct a new vector x = 2v. Since v is in L, x = 2v must also be in L.
    # Let's check the properties of x:
    # 1. Norm: x*x = (2v)*(2v) = 4 * (v*v) = 4 * (3k) = 12k. This is always divisible by 6.
    # 2. 3-primitivity: We need to check if x/3 is in L. x/3 = (2v)/3. If 2v/3 is in L,
    #    then 2v = 3z for some z in L. Since lattices are torsion-free Z-modules, this implies
    #    that v must be divisible by 3 in L (i.e., v = 3w for some w in L). But if v were
    #    divisible by 3, then v/3 = w would be in L, which contradicts the fact that v is
    #    3-primitive. Thus, x/3 cannot be in L, meaning x is 3-primitive.
    # So, we have constructed a vector x that satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the answer is yes.
    answer_b = "yes"

    # Part (c): If an even unimodular lattice L in R^24 has a visible root system of type D_24, 
    # what is the smallest d for which L can be a d-neighbor of Z^24?
    # The lattice L described is the Niemeier lattice with root system D_24.
    # The farness of L, far(L), is the smallest integer d >= 1 such that L is a d-neighbor of Z^24.
    # 1. Check for d=1: L is a 1-neighbor iff it is isometric to Z^24. L is even, but Z^24 is odd,
    #    so they are not isometric. Thus, far(L) > 1.
    # 2. Check for d=2: L is a 2-neighbor of Z^24 if and only if there exists a 2-primitive vector x
    #    in L whose norm x*x is divisible by 2.
    # - Since L is an even lattice, the norm of any vector is even, so the norm condition is always met.
    # - We just need to find a 2-primitive vector x in L (i.e., a vector x such that x/2 is not in L).
    # - The root system of L is D_24, which means L contains vectors of norm 2 (the roots).
    # - Any root vector x in a lattice is primitive, meaning x cannot be written as k*y for k > 1
    #   and y in L. Therefore, x/2 is not in L.
    # - This means any root vector is 2-primitive.
    # Since L has roots, it has 2-primitive vectors. Thus, L is a 2-neighbor of Z^24.
    # As far(L) > 1, the smallest d must be 2.
    answer_c = 2
