    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that solves the puzzle step-by-step.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Calculate the Total Number of Edge Squares:** I will first determine the total number of squares that are on the edges of a standard 8x8 chessboard.\n2.  **Determine the Maximum Number of Bishops:** Next, I will determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on these edge squares. This is a well-known chess problem, and the maximum is `2 * N - 2` for an N x N board. A simple placement proving this is possible using only edge squares is to place bishops on all squares of the top row (8 bishops) and all squares of the bottom row excluding the two corners (6 bishops), for a total of `8 + 6 = 14` non-attacking bishops.\n3.  **Calculate the Difference:** Finally, I will subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares to find out how many are left empty. The code will print the full equation for this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The size of a standard chessboard\nboard_size = 8\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n# On an N x N board, there are N squares on the top row, N on the bottom row,\n# and (N - 2) on both the left and right columns (as corners are already counted).\n# Total edge squares = N + N + (N-2) + (N-2) = 4*N - 4.\ntotal_edge_squares = 4 * (board_size - 1)\n\nprint(f\"First, we calculate the total number of edge squares on a {board_size}x{board_size} board.\")\nprint(f\"There are {board_size} squares on each of the 4 sides, but the 4 corner squares are counted twice.\")\nprint(f\"So, the total number of edge squares is 4 * {board_size} - 4 = {total_edge_squares}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge.\n# The maximum number of non-attacking bishops on an N x N board is 2*N - 2.\n# For an 8x8 board, this is 2 * 8 - 2 = 14.\n# This number can be achieved by placing bishops only on edge squares. For example,\n# placing bishops on all 8 squares of the first row (a1 to h1) and all 6 squares\n# of the eighth row excluding the corners (b8 to g8).\n# This gives a total of 8 + 6 = 14 non-attacking bishops.\nmax_bishops = 2 * board_size - 2\n\nprint(\"Next, we determine the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these edge squares without any attacking each other.\")\nprint(f\"The maximum for a {board_size}x{board_size} board is 2 * {board_size} - 2 = {max_bishops}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of edge squares lacking bishops.\nempty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops\n\nprint(\"Finally, we subtract the number of bishops from the total number of edge squares to find the number of empty squares.\")\n# The final equation as requested\nprint(f\"The final calculation is: {total_edge_squares} - {max_bishops} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\n<<<14>>>\n```"
