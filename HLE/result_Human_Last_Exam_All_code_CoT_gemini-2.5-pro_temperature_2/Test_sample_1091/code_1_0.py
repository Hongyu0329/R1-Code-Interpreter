def solve_probability_limit():
    """
    Calculates the limit of n*P(n) as n -> infinity based on the problem description.

    The method involves the following steps:
    1.  The condition ||S|| <= sqrt(2) is simplified. The sum S lives on a lattice, and this
        condition forces S to be (0,0).
    2.  The probability P(n) becomes P(S=(0,0)).
    3.  P(S=(0,0)) is expressed as a sum of probabilities of underlying Rademacher sums.
    4.  This sum is approximated by an integral using the Local Central Limit Theorem.
    5.  The integral is solved to find the asymptotic value of P(n).
    6.  The final limit of n*P(n) is calculated from the asymptotic P(n).
