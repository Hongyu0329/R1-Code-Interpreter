    "To determine the number of isomers formed, we need to analyze the structure of the reactants and the resulting product complex.\n\n### **Step-by-step Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Ligand (L):** 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole. This is a bis-bidentate ligand, meaning it has two separate chelating sites. For this reaction, we'll assume it uses one of these sites to act as a single bidentate ligand. The coordinating atoms at one site are a nitrogen from a pyridyl ring and a nitrogen from an adjacent thiazole ring. Since a pyridyl-N is different from a thiazole-N, this ligand acts as an **asymmetric bidentate ligand** (we can denote it as type **AB**).\n    *   **Metal Complex:** *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), or `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`. Ruthenium(II) forms octahedral complexes. Bipyridine (bpy) is a **symmetric bidentate ligand** (type **AA**). The two chloride (Cl⁻) ligands are monodentate and are good leaving groups.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Product:**\n    The most likely reaction is a substitution where the bidentate ligand `L` replaces the two cis-positioned chloride ligands.\n    `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2] + L → [Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+ + 2Cl⁻`\n    The resulting product is an octahedral tris-chelate complex, `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`.\n\n3.  **Count the Stereoisomers of the Product:**\n    We need to find the number of stereoisomers for a complex with the general formula `[M(AA)2(AB)]`.\n\n    *   **Chirality:** Any octahedral complex with three bidentate ligands, `[M(L1)(L2)(L3)]`, is chiral (lacks a mirror plane or center of inversion). This fundamental chirality means the complex exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers. These are designated as **Δ** (delta) and **Λ** (lambda), based on the right- or left-handed \"propeller\" twist of the ligands. This gives us a factor of 2.\n\n    *   **Ligand Asymmetry:** We have one asymmetric ligand `L` (AB) and two symmetric ligands `bpy` (AA). Within a given chiral framework (e.g., the Δ framework), the asymmetric ligand `AB` can be positioned in distinct orientations relative to the two identical `bpy` ligands. This gives rise to different geometric arrangements, which are diastereomers. For a `[M(AA)2(AB)]` complex, there are **two** such possible orientations.\n\n    *   **Total Isomers:** To get the total number of isomers, we multiply the possibilities from each source of isomerism.\n\n        Total Isomers = (Isomers from overall chirality) × (Isomers from asymmetric ligand orientation)\n        Total Isomers = 2 × 2 = 4\n\nTherefore, four distinct stereoisomers are formed: two pairs of enantiomers.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and explains this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_isomer_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of isomers formed in the reaction between\n    2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (L) and\n    cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II).\n\n    The product is a tris-chelate complex [Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+.\n    We count the isomers for a complex of type [M(AA)2(AB)], where:\n    M = Ru\n    AA = bpy (symmetric bidentate ligand)\n    AB = L (asymmetric bidentate ligand)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
