        "1. Analyze the Goal: The core task is to transform a Small-World network (where the average path length L is proportional to log(n)) into an Ultra-Small World network (where L is proportional to log(log(n))).",
        "2. Identify the Necessary Structure: The ultra-small world property is a known characteristic of scale-free networks, which have a power-law degree distribution (P(k) is proportional to k^-gamma, with 2 < gamma < 3). The initial network is a regular-like graph where almost every vertex has a degree of 6.",
        "3. Quantify the Required Change: To transform the graph, the degree distribution must be fundamentally altered from a single spike at k=6 to a broad, power-law-like distribution over the allowed range [3, log(n)]. This means a constant fraction of the n vertices must change their degree. The number of vertices that need a degree change is therefore on the order of n, i.e., Theta(n).",
        "4. Calculate the Cost of Rewiring: A single edge rewiring operation consists of removing one edge and adding another, which changes the degrees of at most 4 vertices.",
        "5. Determine the Minimum Operations m(n): To change the degree of Theta(n) vertices, and since each operation can affect at most 4 vertices, the number of required operations m(n) must be at least Theta(n) / 4. Thus, m(n) must be at least proportional to n. This establishes that m(n) is in Omega(n).",
        "6. Conclude the Asymptotic Class: A number of operations proportional to n is also generally sufficient to reshape the graph's global properties. Therefore, the minimum number of operations m(n) is in Theta(n).",
        "7. Final Answer Selection: Based on this analysis, the statement 'm(n) is in Theta(n)' is the most accurate description of the minimum number of operations required for the specified transformation."
