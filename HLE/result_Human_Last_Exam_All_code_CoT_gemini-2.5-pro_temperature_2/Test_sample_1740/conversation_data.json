    "To find the number of let-7 family members in humans, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the members:** I will identify the canonical members of the human let-7 microRNA family by referencing established bioinformatics databases like miRBase and a consensus from scientific literature.\n2.  **Create a list:** I will store the names of these family members in a Python list.\n3.  **Count the members:** I will use Python's `len()` function to count the number of items in the list.\n4.  **Display the results:** I will write a Python script to print the list of members and the final count. To fulfill the requirement of showing an \"equation,\" the code will represent the total count as a sum of its individual components (1 + 1 + ...).\n\n```python\ndef count_human_let7_members():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies, lists, and counts the members of the\n    let-7 microRNA family in humans.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: A list of the canonical human let-7 family members based on miRBase and literature.\n    let7_family_members = [\n        \"let-7a\",\n        \"let-7b\",\n        \"let-7c\",\n        \"let-7d\",\n        \"let-7e\",\n        \"let-7f\",\n        \"let-7g\",\n        \"let-7i\",\n        \"miR-98\"\n    ]\n\n    # Step 3: Count the number of members.\n    count = len(let7_family_members)\n\n    # Step 4: Display the members and the final count.\n    print(\"The members of the let-7 family identified in humans are:\")\n    for member in let7_family_members:\n        print(f\"- {member}\")\n\n    # Display the counting process as a sum.\n    # The list comprehension creates a '1' for each member.\n    equation_parts = ['1' for member in let7_family_members]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe counting equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {count}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTo date, there are {count} members of the let-7 family identified in humans.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_human_let7_members()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
