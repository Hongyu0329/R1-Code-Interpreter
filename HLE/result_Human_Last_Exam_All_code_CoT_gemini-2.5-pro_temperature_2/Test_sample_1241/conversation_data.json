    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. The steady state is reached as $t \\to +\\infty$, at which point the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $P_i$.\n\nWhen the probabilities are constant, their time derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$. This transforms the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Set up the steady-state equations:** I will replace $P_i'(t)$ with 0 in the given system of equations.\n2.  **Simplify the equations:** From the first, third, and fourth equations, I will express $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ as multiples of $P_1$.\n3.  **Use the normalization condition:** The sum of all probabilities must be 1 ($P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$). I will substitute the expressions from step 2 into this equation to solve for $P_1$.\n4.  **Calculate the final sum:** Once I have an expression for $P_1$, I can find $P_0$ and compute the required sum $P_0 + P_1$. I will create a Python script to carry out the numerical calculations and print out the steps and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given transition rates\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# At steady state (t -> infinity), the derivatives are zero (P_i' = 0).\n# The system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n# 1) 0 = -lambda_01 * P0 + lambda_10 * P1   =>   lambda_01 * P0 = lambda_10 * P1\n# 2) 0 = lambda_12 * P1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23) * P2   =>   lambda_12 * P1 = (lambda_21 + lambda_23) * P2\n# 3) 0 = lambda_23 * P2 - lambda_31 * P3   =>   lambda_23 * P2 = lambda_31 * P3\n# 4) P0 + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1 (Normalization condition)\n\n# We can express P0, P2, and P3 in terms of P1.\n# From (1): P0 = (lambda_10 / lambda_01) * P1\n# From (2): P2 = (lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)) * P1\n# From (3): P3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * P2\n\n# Let's substitute the given values into the coefficients.\ncoeff_P0_vs_P1 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\ncoeff_P2_vs_P1 = lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)\ncoeff_P3_vs_P2 = lambda_23 / lambda_31\n\n# The relationship becomes simpler with the given values:\n# coeff_P2_vs_P1 = 0.4 / (0.392 + 0.008) = 0.4 / 0.4 = 1.
