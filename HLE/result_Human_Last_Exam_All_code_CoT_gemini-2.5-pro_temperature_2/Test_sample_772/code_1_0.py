    """
    This function determines the exponent alpha in the relation n(N) ~ N^alpha for the group G = SO(3).

    The value n(N) is the smallest integer n such that for any compact set X
    with Haar measure mu(X) = 1/N, the n-th product set X^n must equal G.
    This value is determined by the "worst-case" sets X, which are the slowest
    to cover G.

    The asymptotic behavior of n(N) is given by N^alpha, where alpha is the
    maximum of two values:
    1. 1/d, where d is the dimension of the group G. This corresponds to the case
       where X is a small ball.
    2. 1/c_min, where c_min is the minimum codimension of a proper subgroup of G.
       This corresponds to the case where X is a small neighborhood of a subgroup.

    The exponent with the larger value will dominate as N -> infinity.
