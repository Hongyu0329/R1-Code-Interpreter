    "Of course. This is a knowledge-based question about ballet technique. Since the instructions require a coded solution, I will write a Python script that explains the key differences between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods for a *cambré derrière* and then prints the correct answer choice.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define a data structure (a dictionary) in Python to hold the key characteristics of a *cambré derrière* in both the Vaganova and Balanchine styles.\n2.  Iterate through the characteristics and print a clear, comparative explanation.\n3.  The explanation will show that while several elements differ, the most foundational and distinct difference relates to the hips.\n4.  The script will conclude by identifying the correct answer choice from the list provided.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ballet_technique_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains the primary difference between a cambré derrière\n    in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    techniques = {\n        \"Vaganova\": {\n            \"Primary Principle\": \"Core stability and precise alignment.\",\n            \"Hip Placement\": \"Hips are kept strictly square to the front.
