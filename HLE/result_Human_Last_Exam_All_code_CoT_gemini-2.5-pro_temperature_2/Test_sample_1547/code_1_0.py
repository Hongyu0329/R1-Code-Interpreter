    This function illustrates that for a simple transient set A in Z^3,
    the hitting probability P_x(tau_A < infinity) tends to 0 as |x| increases,
    which contradicts the condition in the problem statement.

    We consider A = {(0,0,0)} and calculate the hitting probability from
    points x = (k,0,0) for increasing k.
    
    The hitting probability is given by P_x(tau_A < inf) = G(x,0)/G(0,0),
    where G is the Green's function. By translation invariance, this is G(0,-x)/G(0,0).
    
    We use the following known values/approximations for Z^3:
    - G(0,0) is a constant, approximately 1.516386.
    - For large |z|, G(0,z) is approximately (3 / (2 * pi * |z|)).
