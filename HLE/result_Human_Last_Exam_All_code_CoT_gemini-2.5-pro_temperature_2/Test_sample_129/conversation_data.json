    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Goal:** Find the number of syntactically correct boolean expressions of exactly length 5 that evaluate to `True`. The allowed symbols are `T, F, !, &, |, (, )`.\n\n2.  **Strategy:** Since the length of the expressions is small (5), we can generate all possible strings of length 5 from the given 7 symbols and test each one. The total number of combinations is 7^5 = 16,807, which is perfectly manageable for a script to check.\n\n3.  **Generation:** I will use Python's `itertools.product` to generate every possible combination of 5 symbols from the allowed set.\n\n4.  **Validation and Evaluation:** For each generated string, I need to check two things:\n    a. Is it a syntactically valid boolean expression?\n    b. If valid, does it evaluate to `True`?\n\n5.  **Execution using `eval`:** Python's built-in `eval()` function is ideal for this task. It can parse a string and evaluate it as a Python expression.\n    *   **Syntax Checking:** If an expression is not valid (e.g., `T(&F)` or `TF&()` ), `eval()` will raise a `SyntaxError`. I can catch this error and simply move to the next string.\n    *   **Translation:** The given symbols `T, F, !, &, |` need to be translated into their Python equivalents: `True, False, not, and, or`. The precedence order `! > & > |` conveniently matches Python's `not > and > or` precedence, so no special handling is needed for that. I will transform each string like `\"T&!F\"` into a Python-readable format like `\"True and not False\"`.\n    *   **Safe Evaluation:** To ensure the `eval()` function is safe and doesn't execute malicious code, it will be run in a restricted environment where only the boolean values `True` and `False` are defined.\n\n6.  **Counting:** I will initialize a counter to zero. For each string that is successfully evaluated as `True`, I will increment the counter.\n\n7.  **Final Output:** After checking all 16,807 possibilities, the script will print the final count, which is the answer to the problem.\n\nThis method is exhaustive and guarantees that we will find every single valid expression without missing any or counting any invalid ones.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_true_boolean_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all possible expressions of length 5 using a given set of\n    boolean symbols, evaluates them, and counts how many are true.\n    \"\"\"\n    symbols = ['T', 'F', '!', '&', '|', '(', ')']\n    length = 5\n    true_expression_count = 0\n\n    # The problem specifies precedence ! > & > |, which matches Python's\n    # `not`, `and`, `or`. We can leverage Python's eval().\n\n    # Generate all possible combinations of symbols of the given length.\n    all_combinations = itertools.product(symbols, repeat=length)\n\n    # Prepare a safe environment for eval().
