    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Model:** The problem concerns the supersymmetric (Susy) sigma-model used for disordered systems. The specific case is for symmetry class D with `n_r = 2` replicas.\n2.  **Identify the Mathematical Object:** The variables in this model parametrize a target manifold. For the Susy sigma-model of class D, this manifold is a symmetric superspace given by the quotient `G/H`, where `G = Osp(2*n_r | 2*n_r)` and `H = Osp(n_r | n_r) x Osp(n_r | n_r)`.\n3.  **Isolate the Bosonic Sector:** We are interested in the non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables. These correspond to the dimensions of the bosonic part of the supermanifold `G/H`. The dimension of this bosonic part is `dim(G_B) - dim(H_B)`, where `G_B` and `H_B` are the bosonic subgroups of `G` and `H`, respectively.\n4.  **Determine the Bosonic Subgroups:**\n    *   The bosonic part of the orthosymplectic group `Osp(p|2q)` is `O(p) x Sp(2q)`.\n    *   For `G = Osp(4|4)` (since `n_r=2`), the bosonic subgroup `G_B` is `O(4) x Sp(4)`.\n    *   For `H = Osp(2|2) x Osp(2|2)`, the bosonic subgroup `H_B` is `(O(2) x Sp(2)) x (O(2) x Sp(2))`.\n5.  **Use Dimension Formulas:** We will use the standard formulas for the dimensions of these Lie groups:\n    *   Dimension of the orthogonal group `O(k)` is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n    *   Dimension of the symplectic group `Sp(2k)` is `k * (2k + 1)`.\n6.  **Calculate and Print:** The Python code will define the number of replicas, calculate the dimensions of `G_B` and `H_B` step-by-step, and then find their difference to get the final answer, printing out each number in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bosonic_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables for the\n    supersymmetric sigma-model in symmetry class D with two replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas\n    n_r = 2\n    \n    print(f\"The number of replicas is n_r = {n_r}.\")\n    print(\"The target manifold for the bosonic sector is derived from the symmetric superspace G/H,\")\n    print(\"where G = Osp(2*n_r|2*n_r) and H = Osp(n_r|n_r) x Osp(n_r|n_r).\")\n    print(\"The number of bosonic variables is dim(G_B) - dim(H_B).\\n\")\n\n    # Define dimension calculation functions\n    def dim_O(k):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the dimension of the Orthogonal group O(k).\"\"\"\n        return k * (k - 1) // 2\n\n    def dim_Sp(two_k):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the dimension of the Symplectic group Sp(2k).\"\"\"\n        if two_k % 2 != 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Argument to Sp must be even.\")\n        k = two_k // 2\n        return k * (2 * k + 1)\n\n    # Calculate dimension of G_B = O(2*n_r) x Sp(2*n_r) = O(4) x Sp(4)\n    g_o_k = 2 * n_r\n    g_sp_2k = 2 * n_r\n    dim_O_G = dim_O(g_o_k)\n    dim_Sp_G = dim_Sp(g_sp_2k)\n    dim_G_B = dim_O_G + dim_Sp_G\n    \n    print(\"1.
