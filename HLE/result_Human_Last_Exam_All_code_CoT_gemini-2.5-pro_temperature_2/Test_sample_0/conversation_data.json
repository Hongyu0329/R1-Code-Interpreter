    "To answer this question, let's first understand the concepts involved.\n\n**Critical-Level Views:** In population ethics, these views state that adding a new person to the world is only a good thing if their quality of life (welfare) is above a certain positive \"critical level.\" Adding someone at the critical level is neutral, and adding someone below it is bad. The total value of a population is calculated by summing up the welfare of each person minus the critical level (`sum(w_i - c)` for all individuals `i`).\n\n**Non-Elitism Condition:** This condition states that for any high level of welfare `w`, it's always possible to find a sufficiently large number of people (`n`) at a slightly lower level of welfare (`w-ε`) such that the population of `n` people is considered at least as good as the population with just one person at level `w`. Essentially, it prevents a single \"elite\" life from being considered incalculably better than any number of \"very-good-but-not-quite-elite\" lives.\n\nNow, let's see how these two concepts conflict.\n\n**The Conflict:**\nImagine a critical level of `c = 20`.\n1.  Consider one \"elite\" person with a welfare level `w = 21`, which is just above the critical level. According to a critical-level view, the value of adding this person is `21 - 20 = 1`. This is a positive, good outcome.\n2.  Now consider a slightly lower welfare level, say `w-ε = 19`, which is just below the critical level. The value of adding a person at this level is `19 - 20 = -1`. This is a negative, bad outcome.\n3.  According to the Non-Elitism condition, we should be able to find *some* number of people (`n`) at welfare level 19 whose existence is better than one person at welfare 21.\n4.  However, with a critical-level view, the value of `n` people at level 19 is `n * (19 - 20) = -n`. No matter how large `n` gets, the total value (`-n`) will always be negative and therefore always worse than the value of the single person at level 21 (which is `+1`).\n\nBecause we have found a case (a welfare level just above the critical level) where no number of people at a slightly lower level can be considered better, the critical-level view violates the Non-Elitism condition.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this exact conflict numerically.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef demonstrate_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates why critical-level views violate the 'Non-Elitism' axiom.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define a positive critical level.\n    critical_level = 20\n\n    # Let's pick a welfare level 'w' just above the critical level.\n    welfare_high = 21\n\n    # Let's pick a slightly lower welfare level 'w_lower' just below the critical level.\n    welfare_low = 19\n    \n    # According to Non-Elitism, there should be some large number 'n' of people\n    # at 'welfare_low' that is at least as good as one person at 'welfare_high'.\n    # We will test this with a very large n.\n    num_people_in_large_pop = 1000000\n\n    # Define the value function for a critical-level view.\n    # Value = Sum of (welfare - critical_level) for each person.\n    def calculate_value(population_welfares, c_level):\n        total_value = 0\n        for w in population_welfares:\n            total_value += (w - c_level)\n        return total_value\n\n    # Calculate the value of a population with one \"elite\" person.\n    pop_A = [welfare_high]\n    value_A = calculate_value(pop_A, critical_level)\n\n    # Calculate the value of a large population of people at a slightly lower level.\n    pop_B = [welfare_low] * num_people_in_large_pop\n    value_B = calculate_value(pop_B, critical_level)\n\n    print(\"--- Demonstrating the Violation of Non-Elitism ---\")\n    print(f\"We assume a critical level of: {critical_level}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Population 1: The 'Elite' Case ---\")\n    print(f\"A population with one person at welfare level {welfare_high} (above critical level).\")\n    print(f\"Value = ({welfare_high} - {critical_level}) * 1\")\n    print(f\"Resulting Value = {value_A}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Population 2: The 'Numerous but Lower' Case ---\")\n    print(f\"A population with {num_people_in_large_pop:,} people at welfare level {welfare_low} (below critical level).\")\n    print(f\"Value = ({welfare_low} - {critical_level}) * {num_people_in_large_pop:,}\")\n    print(f\"Resulting Value = {value_B}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    if value_A > value_B:\n        print(f\"The value of Population 1 ({value_A}) is greater than the value of Population 2 ({value_B}).\")\n        print(\"No matter how many people are in Population 2, its value will remain negative and always be worse than Population 1.\")\n        print(\"This is a direct violation of the Non-Elitism condition.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"This specific example did not violate Non-Elitism.\")\n\ndemonstrate_violation()\n<<<C>>>"
