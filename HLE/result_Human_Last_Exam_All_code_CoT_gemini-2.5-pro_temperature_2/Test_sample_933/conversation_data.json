    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  I will create a Python script to answer this chemistry question.\n2.  The script will first define the most common and efficient synthesis reaction for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4), which is the direct combination of Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F2).\n3.  I will display the chemical equation for this reaction. As per your request, I will explicitly print out each numerical value present in the balanced chemical equation (the stoichiometric coefficients and atomic counts in the molecules).\n4.  Next, the script will state the established optimal temperature for this reaction to proceed efficiently, based on well-known chemical data.\n5.  Finally, I will compare this temperature to the provided list of options and select the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_xef4_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) to determine\n    the coldest temperature from the given options at which it can be produced.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Task: Find the coldest efficient synthesis temperature for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the synthesis reaction.\n    # The most common method is the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gases.\n    # The reaction must be controlled to favor XeF4.\n    print(\"\\nThe primary synthesis method for XeF4 is the direct reaction of Xenon and Fluorine.\")\n    print(\"The balanced chemical equation is: Xe + 2F₂ -> XeF₄\")\n    \n    # Step 2: As requested, output each number from the final equation.\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers found in this final equation are:\")\n    print(f\"The stoichiometric coefficient for Xenon (Xe) is: 1\")\n    print(f\"The stoichiometric coefficient for Fluorine (F₂) is: 2\")\n    print(f\"The number of fluorine atoms in a fluorine molecule (F₂) is: 2\")\n    print(f\"The stoichiometric coefficient for Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is: 1\")\n    print(f\"The number of fluorine atoms in a Xenon tetrafluoride molecule (XeF₄) is: 4\")\n\n    # Step 3: State the reaction conditions and identify the optimal temperature.\n    optimal_temp = 400\n    print(f\"\\nThis reaction requires heating the mixture of gases (typically in a 1:5 Xe to F₂ ratio) in a suitable vessel (e.g., made of Nickel).\")\n    print(f\"The established temperature for this synthesis to be efficient is approximately {optimal_temp}°C.\")\n    print(\"At much lower temperatures, the reaction is too slow.
