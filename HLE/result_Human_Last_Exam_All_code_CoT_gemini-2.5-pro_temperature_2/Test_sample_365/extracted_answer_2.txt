The product is a complex, isomeric bicyclic ketone that results from an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. In this transformation, the original bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton undergoes a ring expansion, and the tertiary alcohol group is converted into a ketone. The tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether and the dimethoxy ketal functional groups remain unchanged.
