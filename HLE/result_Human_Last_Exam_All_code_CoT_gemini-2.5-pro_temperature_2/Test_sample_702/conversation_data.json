    "In this problem, we need to determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. The connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $k$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n\nTo solve this, I will follow these steps:\n1.  Determine the connectivity of the source space $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the target space $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. The connectivity of a space is the largest integer $n$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ are trivial for $i < n$.\n2.  If both spaces have the same connectivity, say $m-1$, then the first non-trivial homotopy group to check is $\\pi_m$. I will calculate $\\pi_m(X)$ and $\\pi_m(Y)$.\n3.  I will then analyze the map $f_*: \\pi_m(X) \\to \\pi_m(Y)$. Based on established theorems in algebraic topology, this map is an isomorphism.\n4.  Next, I will investigate the map on the next homotopy group, $\\pi_{m+1}$. I will calculate $\\pi_{m+1}(X)$ and $\\pi_{m+1}(Y)$.\n5.  Finally, I will determine if the map $f_*: \\pi_{m+1}(X) \\to \\pi_{m+1}(Y)$ is a surjection. This will allow me to conclude the precise connectivity of the map $f$.\n\nThe calculations rely on fundamental theorems like the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, the Hurewicz Theorem, and the Künneth Theorem for homology. I will use a Python script to structure these steps and calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef conn_of_sphere(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the connectivity of the n-sphere S^n.\"\"\"\n    # A space is k-connected if pi_i is trivial for i <= k.\n    # For S^n, pi_i(S^n) is trivial for i < n.
