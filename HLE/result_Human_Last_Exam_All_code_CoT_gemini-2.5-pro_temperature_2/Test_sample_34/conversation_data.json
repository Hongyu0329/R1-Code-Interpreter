    "To determine the worst suited Jack to open from the button, we need to consider standard GTO (Game Theory Optimal) opening ranges. Here's the thinking process:\n\n1.  **Position is Key**: The Button (BTN) is the most powerful position in poker. You are last to act post-flop, which gives you a significant informational advantage. Consequently, you can profitably play a very wide range of hands. A typical BTN opening range in a 100BB cash game is around 45-50% of all possible hands.\n2.  **Hand Strength Components**: For a suited Jack (Jxs), its strength comes from three factors:\n    *   **High Card Value**: The Jack is a strong high card.\n    *   **Flush Potential**: Being suited adds significant equity, allowing you to win big pots when you make a flush.\n    *   **Kicker and Connectivity**: The second card (the 'x') is crucial. A higher kicker (like in JTs) gives you better straight potential (connectivity) and reduces the chances of being 'dominated' if a Jack hits the flop (e.g., your JTs is in much better shape than J2s against an opponent holding A J on a J-high flop).\n3.  **Ranking the Suited Jacks**: Based on the kicker and connectivity, we can rank the Jxs hands from best to worst.\n    *   **Best**: JTs, J9s, J8s are strong suited connectors/gappers.\n    *   **Medium**: J7s down to J5s are playable but have decreasing strength.\n    *   **Worst**: J4s, J3s, and J2s are at the very bottom of the category. They have the lowest kickers and the worst connectivity, making them the most difficult to play post-flop and the most likely to be dominated.\n4.  **Conclusion**: While a BTN opening range includes all suited Jacks, the one with the lowest profitability and weakest post-flop prospects is the one with the lowest kicker. Therefore, J2s is the worst suited jack you should still open from the button.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack():\n  \"\"\"\n  Determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button in a standard 100BB cash game.\n  \n  In poker, opening ranges from the button are very wide.
