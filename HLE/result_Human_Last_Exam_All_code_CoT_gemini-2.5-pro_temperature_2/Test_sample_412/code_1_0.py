1.  **Understanding Continuity in Nonstandard Analysis:**
    The fundamental idea of continuity at a point `x₀` is that "if `x` is close to `x₀`, then `f(x)` is close to `f(x₀)`". In nonstandard analysis, "infinitesimally close" provides a precise meaning for "close".

    A function `f` is continuous at a *standard point* `x₀` if and only if for every nonstandard point `x₁` that is infinitesimally close to `x₀`, the image `f(x₁)` is infinitesimally close to the image `f(x₀)`. To say `f` is continuous everywhere, this must hold for all standard points `x₀`.

2.  **Evaluating the Options:**

    *   **A. `∀ x₀, x₁ ∈ X: x₀ ~ x₁ ⟹ f(x₀) ~ f(x₁)`:** This is too weak. It only considers standard points, where `~` is the same as equality (in T1 spaces). It doesn't test the function's behavior with points that are infinitesimally close but not equal.

    *   **B. `∀ x₀ ∈ X, ∀ x₁ ∈ X*: x₀ ~ x₁ ⟹ f(x₀) ~ f(x₁)`:** This is the correct formulation. It perfectly captures the principle described above. For any standard point (denoted by the variable `x_0`, with index 0), if an arbitrary nonstandard point (`x_1`, with index 1) is in its monad (i.e., `x₀ ~ x₁`), then their images must also be in each other's monads (`f(x₀) ~ f(x₁)`). The universal quantification `∀ x₀ ∈ X` ensures this holds for the entire domain, defining continuity.

    *   **C. `∀ x₀, x₁ ∈ X*: x₀ ~ x₁ ⟹ f(x₀) ~ f(x₁)`:** This is too strong. It's a property called S-continuity (or microcontinuity), which for metric spaces is equivalent to uniform continuity. Not all continuous functions are uniformly continuous, so this is not equivalent.

    *   **D, E, F:** These are converses of the continuity conditions. They describe different properties, such as injectivity or being a closed map, but not continuity itself. For example, a simple continuous function like `f(x) = constant` fails option E.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    The property equivalent to `f` being a continuous map is that it preserves the infinitesimal closeness relation between a standard point and any nonstandard point near it.
