            'reasoning': "Highly plausible. The rigid social hierarchy of the Edo period often relegated women to specific roles. Techniques involving seduction or espionage by women would have been considered morally questionable, leading to self-censorship by scribes.",

            'description': "The circles are a mnemonic code for techniques transmitted orally.",

            'description': "The original page was damaged from overuse, and the ink wore away.",
