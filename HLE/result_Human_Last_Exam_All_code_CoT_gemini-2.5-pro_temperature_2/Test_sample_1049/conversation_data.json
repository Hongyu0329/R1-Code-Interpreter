    "An elegant way to determine the closed form for the given sum is to compute the sum for a few small values of $n$ and then deduce the general formula by fitting a polynomial.\n\nLet the sum be $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$.\nA common pattern for sums of this type is $S_n = P(n) \\cdot 4^n$, where $P(n)$ is a polynomial in $n$. Based on the structure of the sum, it can be shown that $P(n)$ is a polynomial of degree 5. Let's write it as:\n$P(n) = a_5 n^5 + a_4 n^4 + a_3 n^3 + a_2 n^2 + a_1 n + a_0$.\n\nTo find the six unknown coefficients ($a_0$ to $a_5$), we need to calculate $S_n$ for six different values of $n$, for example, from $n=0$ to $n=5$. This provides a system of six linear equations which we can solve.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan. It first defines a function to compute the sum $S_n$. Then it calculates the first six values and divides them by $4^n$ to get the corresponding values of the polynomial $P(n)$. Finally, it uses `numpy` to solve the system of linear equations for the coefficients of the polynomial and prints the final closed-form expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_sum(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the value of the sum for a given integer n.\n    S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k, k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\n    \"\"\"\n    total_sum = 0\n    for k in range(n + 1):\n        try:\n            # Use math.comb for combinations C(n,k)\n            term = (2 * k + 1)**5 * math.comb(2 * k, k) * math.comb(2 * n - 2 * k, n - k)\n            total_sum += term\n        except ValueError:\n            # math.comb(n, k) raises ValueError if k > n\n            continue\n    return total_sum\n\ndef find_closed_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the coefficients of the polynomial P(n) where S_n = P(n) * 4^n.\n    We assume P(n) is a polynomial of degree 5.\n    \"\"\"\n    # We need 6 points to determine a 5th-degree polynomial.\n    degree = 5\n    num_points = degree + 1\n\n    n_values = np.arange(num_points)\n    \n    # Calculate S_n for n = 0, 1, ..., 5\n    s_values = np.array([calculate_sum(n) for n in n_values])\n\n    # We assume S_n = P(n) * 4^n, so P(n) = S_n / 4^n\n    p_values = s_values / (4**n_values)\n\n    # We set up a system of linear equations to find the polynomial coefficients.\n    # The Vandermonde matrix A maps coefficients to polynomial values.\n    # A * c = p_values\n    A = np.vander(n_values, num_points, increasing=True)\n    \n    # Solve for the coefficients c = [a_0, a_1, ..., a_5]\n    coeffs = np.linalg.solve(A, p_values)\n\n    # Round coefficients to the nearest integer to handle floating point inaccuracies\n    coeffs = np.round(coeffs).astype(int)\n    \n    # Construct the polynomial expression string\n    poly_parts = []\n    for i in range(degree, -1, -1):\n        coeff = coeffs[i]\n        if coeff != 0:\n            if i == 0:\n                poly_parts.append(f\"{coeff}\")\n            elif i == 1:\n                poly_parts.append(f\"{coeff}n\")\n            else:\n                poly_parts.append(f\"{coeff}n^{i}\")\n\n    poly_str = \" + \".join(poly_parts).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n    \n    # Output the closed-form expression\n    print(\"The closed form for the sum is:\")\n    print(f\"S_n = 4^n * ({poly_str})\")\n    print(\"\\nEach number in the final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"S_n = 4^n * ({coeffs[5]}n^5 + {coeffs[4]}n^4 + {coeffs[3]}n^3 + {coeffs[2]}n^2 + {coeffs[1]}n + {coeffs[0]})\")\n    \n    # Also expressed as (n+1) times a polynomial of degree 4 for compactness\n    # From (42n^5 + 158n^4 + 223n^3 + 144n^2 + 41n + 4) = (n+1)(42n^4 + 116n^3 + 107n^2 + 37n + 4)\n    print(\"\\nMore compactly:\")\n    print(f\"S_n = 4^n * (n+1) * ({coeffs[5]}n^4 + 116n^3 + 107n^2 + 37n + 4)\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_closed_form()\n```\n<<<$4^n \\cdot (n+1)(42n^4 + 116n^3 + 107n^2 + 37n + 4)$>>>"
