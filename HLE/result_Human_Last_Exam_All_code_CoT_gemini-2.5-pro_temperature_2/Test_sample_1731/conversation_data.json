    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the task.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Framework**: I will use the principles of statistical mechanics to model a photon gas. The core idea, rooted in Boltzmann's work and formalized by large deviation theorems like Sanov's theorem, is that the equilibrium state of a system is the macrostate that corresponds to the largest number of microstates.\n2.  **Entropy Maximization**: I will start with the statistical definition of entropy, `S = k_B * ln(W)`, where `W` is the number of ways to arrange the photons (bosons) in different energy states. I will maximize this entropy subject to the physical constraint of a constant total mean energy, `U`. For photons, the particle number is not conserved, which sets the chemical potential to zero. This constrained optimization procedure is a practical application of the large deviation principle.\n3.  **Bose-Einstein Distribution**: The maximization process will yield the famous Bose-Einstein distribution function, which gives the average number of photons occupying each energy state at equilibrium.\n4.  **Mean Energy (U)**: I will then calculate the total mean energy `U` by summing the energy of all photons, using the derived distribution. This involves integrating over the density of states for photons in a three-dimensional volume, leading to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy.\n5.  **Entropy (S)**: Finally, I will derive the corresponding equilibrium entropy `S`. An elegant way to do this is to first calculate the Helmholtz free energy `F` from the partition function and then use the fundamental thermodynamic relation `S = (U - F) / T`.\n6.  **Code Implementation**: I will encapsulate this derivation within a single Python script. The script will use `print` statements to explain each step of the reasoning and present the final symbolic formulas for `U` and `S`, explicitly showing all numerical factors and constants as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef derive_bose_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and prints the equilibrium values for mean energy (U) and entropy (S)\n    for a photon gas using principles of statistical mechanics related to\n    large deviation theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"### Derivation of Equilibrium Properties for a Photon Gas (Bose Case) ###\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Statistical Entropy (Boltzmann-Sanov Principle) ---\n    print(\"1.
