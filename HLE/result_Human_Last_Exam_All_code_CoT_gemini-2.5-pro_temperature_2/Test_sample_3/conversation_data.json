    "To find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we will rely on the complete classification of such subgroups, which is a known result in the theory of elliptic curves. Specifically, F. Najman's work provides a full list of possible torsion subgroup structures for elliptic curves defined over this field.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Enumerate all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroup structures over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ based on the established classification. A non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over a number field has the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ where $m > 1$.\n2.  For each possible structure, calculate its order, which is the product of the orders of its cyclic components ($m \\times n$).\n3.  Iterate through all these orders to find the maximum value.\n4.  The final output will display the calculation for the largest order found, adhering to the requested format.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve\n    over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)) based on the known classification.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # According to the classification by Najman (2017), the possible non-cyclic\n    # torsion subgroups E(Q(sqrt(-3)))_tors are:\n    # 1.
