    "This problem requires us to find the maximum Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter threshold from a given set of clinical data that satisfies two conditions simultaneously:\n1.  Sensitivity must be greater than 60%.\n2.  Specificity must be greater than 80%.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Represent the clinical data, which links AM diameter thresholds to sensitivity and specificity values, within the code. I will use a list of lists where each inner list contains `[diameter, sensitivity, specificity]`.\n2.  Define the required minimums for sensitivity (60%) and specificity (80%).\n3.  Iterate through the dataset to identify all diameter thresholds that meet *both* criteria.\n4.  From the list of valid thresholds, find the maximum value.\n5.  Finally, print a clear explanation of how this maximum value was determined, showing its corresponding sensitivity and specificity to confirm it meets the conditions.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_diameter_threshold():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the maximum Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter threshold that meets specific\n    sensitivity and specificity criteria for identifying EVP enhancement.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the clinical data.\n    # This data represents different AM diameter thresholds and their corresponding\n    # sensitivity and specificity percentages.\n    # Format: [AM Diameter (mm), Sensitivity (%), Specificity (%)]\n    clinical_data = [\n        [4.0, 85, 70],\n        [4.5, 80, 81],\n        [5.0, 75, 86],\n        [5.5, 68, 90],\n        [6.0, 61, 94],\n        [6.5, 54, 97],\n        [7.0, 45, 99]\n    ]\n\n    # Step 2: Define the required criteria.\n    min_sensitivity = 60\n    min_specificity = 80\n\n    # Step 3: Identify all diameter thresholds that satisfy the criteria.\n    valid_thresholds = []\n    for diameter, sensitivity, specificity in clinical_data:\n        if sensitivity > min_sensitivity and specificity > min_specificity:\n            valid_thresholds.append([diameter, sensitivity, specificity])\n\n    # Step 4: Find the threshold with the maximum diameter from the valid list.\n    if not valid_thresholds:\n        print(\"No diameter threshold was found that meets the specified criteria.\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the entry with the maximum diameter among the valid ones\n    max_valid_threshold_entry = max(valid_thresholds, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    \n    max_diameter = max_valid_threshold_entry[0]\n    final_sensitivity = max_valid_threshold_entry[1]\n    final_specificity = max_valid_threshold_entry[2]\n    \n    # Step 5: Print the results and the logic.\n    print(f\"Finding the maximum Aortomesenteric diameter that is > {min_sensitivity}% sensitive and > {min_specificity}% specific.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"Valid thresholds found (Sensitivity > 60% and Specificity > 80%):\")\n    for d, s, sp in valid_thresholds:\n        print(f\"  - Diameter: {d} mm, Sensitivity: {s}%, Specificity: {sp}%\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    print(\"The maximum diameter from this valid list is chosen.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer Derivation:\")\n    print(f\"The Aortomesenteric diameter of {max_diameter} mm results in:\")\n    print(f\"  - Sensitivity: {final_sensitivity}% (which is > {min_sensitivity}%)\")\n    print(f\"  - Specificity: {final_specificity}% (which is > {min_specificity}%)\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThis is the highest threshold that meets both conditions.
