    Computes the first homology group of SL_2(Z) by finding the
    Smith Normal Form of the relation matrix of its abelianization.

    SL_2(Z) is isomorphic to the amalgamated free product Z_4 *_Z_2 Z_6.
    Let Z_4 be generated by 'a' and Z_6 by 'b'. The relations are a^4 = e, b^6 = e.
    The amalgamated subgroup Z_2 is generated by a^2 in Z_4 and b^3 in Z_6.
    So, the relation in the product is a^2 = b^3.

    For the abelianization, we add the relation [a,b] = e, so ab=ba.
    The group is generated by a, b with relations:
    1) 4a = 0
    2) 6b = 0
    3) 2a - 3b = 0
