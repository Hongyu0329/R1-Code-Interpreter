    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Problem:** The request is to find the \"4-point DFT\" of an 8-point sequence `{x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. A standard interpretation for finding an N-point DFT of a 2N-point sequence is to perform a decimation-in-frequency step. This means we will find the even-indexed components of the 8-point DFT of the full sequence. This result is equivalent to calculating the 4-point DFT of a new sequence `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)`, where `y(n)` is the original 8-point sequence.\n\n2.  **Find `x(n)` and `h(n)`:** First, we need the original 4-point time-domain sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We can obtain these by computing the 4-point Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) of the given `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\n3.  **Construct the Sequence `z(n)`:** The 8-point interleaved sequence is `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. We then construct the 4-point sequence `z(n)` by folding and adding the two halves of `y(n)`:\n    `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    This gives: `z(n) = {x(0)+x(2), h(0)+h(2), x(1)+x(3), h(1)+h(3)}`.\n\n4.  **Compute the Final DFT:** Finally, we compute the 4-point DFT of the sequence `z(n)`. The result will be the 4-point sequence requested.\n\nI will use the `numpy` library in Python to perform the FFT and IFFT calculations efficiently.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_dft_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the DFT problem as described in the prompt.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the given 4-point DFTs X(k) and H(k).\n    Xk = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j])\n    Hk = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j])\n\n    # Step 2: Find the original time-domain sequences x(n) and h(n) by computing the IDFT.\n    # The numpy.fft.ifft function calculates the scaled inverse DFT.\n    xn = np.fft.ifft(Xk)\n    hn = np.fft.ifft(Hk)\n\n    # Note: After this step, the sequences are:\n    # xn = [0, 0, 0, 1]\n    # hn = [0.75, -0.75, -0.25, 0.25]\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the 4-point sequence z(n) based on the interpretation.\n    # z(n) = {x(0)+x(2), h(0)+h(2), x(1)+x(3), h(1)+h(3)}\n    zn = np.array([\n        xn[0] + xn[2],\n        hn[0] + hn[2],\n        xn[1] + xn[3],\n        hn[1] + hn[3]\n    ])\n    \n    # Note: The sequence z(n) is [0, 0.5, 1, -0.5]\n\n    # Step 4: Compute the 4-point DFT of z(n).\n    Zk = np.fft.fft(zn)\n\n    # Print the final result in the format of an equation.\n    # The output is cleaned up to remove floating point artifacts.\n    print(\"The resulting 4-point DFT, let's call it Y_4(k), is:\")\n    for k, val in enumerate(Zk):\n        # Clean up small floating point inaccuracies for clearer output\n        clean_val = np.round(val.real, 10) + np.round(val.imag, 10) * 1j\n        print(f\"Y_4({k}) = {clean_val}\")\n\nsolve_dft_problem()\n<<<[1.0, (-1.0-1.0j), 1.0, (-1.0+1.0j)]>>>"
