    "The problem asks for the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a system consisting of two patches of surface code, with the condition of having \"two holes\".\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand Logical Qubits in a Surface Code:** For a planar patch of a surface code (which has a genus of 0), the number of logical qubits it can store is equal to the number of holes (internal boundaries) created within it. Let `k` be the number of logical qubits and `h` be the number of holes, then for a single patch, `k = h`.\n2.  **Analyze the System Configuration:** The system consists of \"two patches\". This means we have two physically separate surface codes. The total number of logical qubits in the system is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n3.  **Interpret the Ambiguity:** The phrase \"with two holes\" is ambiguous. It could mean:\n    *   **Interpretation A:** The entire system has a total of two holes, distributed between the two patches (e.g., one hole in each, or two in one and zero in the other). In this case, the total number of logical qubits would be `k_total = h_total = 2`.\n    *   **Interpretation B:** *Each* of the two patches has two holes.\n4.  **Apply the \"At Most\" Constraint:** The question asks for the maximum number (\"at most\") of logical qubits. We must choose the interpretation that yields the highest number.\n    *   Interpretation A gives 2 logical qubits.\n    *   Interpretation B gives `k_total = (qubits in patch 1) + (qubits in patch 2) = 2 + 2 = 4` logical qubits.\n5.  **Conclusion:** To find the maximum, we will proceed with Interpretation B, as it results in a larger number of logical qubits.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n*   Number of patches = 2\n*   Number of holes per patch = 2\n*   Logical qubits per patch = 2\n*   Total logical qubits = (Number of patches) × (Logical qubits per patch) = 2 × 2 = 4\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_qubit_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for the given surface code configuration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of separate patches of surface code.\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # The number of logical qubits in a single planar patch of surface code\n    # is equal to the number of holes created in it.\n    # The phrase \"two patches of surface code with two holes\" is ambiguous.\n    # To find the maximum (\"at most\") number of logical qubits, we must assume\n    # the configuration that maximizes this value. This occurs when each patch\n    # has two holes.\n    holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # Logical qubits per patch equals the number of holes in it.\n    logical_qubits_per_patch = holes_per_patch\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits for a system of multiple independent patches\n    # is the sum of the logical qubits on each patch.\n    total_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n\n    # Output the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(f\"The number of logical qubits on a planar surface code patch is equal to the number of holes, h.\")\n    print(f\"The system has {num_patches} patches.\")\n    print(f\"To find the maximum possible logical qubits, we assume each patch has {holes_per_patch} holes.\")\n    print(f\"Total logical qubits = Number of patches * Holes per patch\")\n    print(f\"{total_logical_qubits} = {num_patches} * {holes_per_patch}\")\n\nsolve_qubit_count()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
