# Step 1: Define the partial specific volume for a typical monoclonal antibody (mAb).
# This is a standard biophysical parameter found in literature.
# Units are in mL/g.
partial_specific_volume = 0.73

# Step 2: Calculate the steric-only second osmotic virial coefficient (B22,steric).
# The steric contribution is modeled using hard-sphere behavior, where
# B22,steric is four times the partial specific volume.
steric_coefficient = 4 * partial_specific_volume

# Step 3: Print the explanation and the final equation with the result.
