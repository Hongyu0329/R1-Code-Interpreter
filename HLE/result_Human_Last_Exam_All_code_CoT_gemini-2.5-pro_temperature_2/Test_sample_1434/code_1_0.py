# This problem is analytical, but python can be used to perform the final summation.
# We have deduced the number of possible values for m for each n.
# Let k(n) be the number of possible values m for a given n.
# From the analysis:
# k(1) = 2. The possible m values are 0 and 1.
# For n >= 2, the number of solutions k(n) becomes larger. Based on the analysis
# of the subproblems, it's known that non-trivial solutions for m can be constructed.
# The simplest plausible assumption that reflects this is that k(n)=4 for n>=2,
# representing the trivial solutions m=0, N_n, and a non-trivial one m=m_0 and its
# complement m=N_n-m_0.

# The sum is Sum_{n=1 to inf} k(n) / 4^n
# = k(1)/4^1 + Sum_{n=2 to inf} k(n)/4^n

k1 = 2
# Let's assume k_n=4 for n>=2
# The sum part is Sum_{n=2 to inf} 4/4^n = 4 * Sum_{n=2 to inf} (1/4)^n

# The sum of a geometric series Sum_{n=N to inf} r^n is r^N / (1-r)
# Here N=2, r=1/4.

# Or using the formula: (1/4)^2 / (1-1/4) = (1/16) / (3/4) = 1/12
