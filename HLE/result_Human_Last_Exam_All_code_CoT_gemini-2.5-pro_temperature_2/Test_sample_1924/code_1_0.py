    This function solves the given geometry problem by using a symmetry argument.

    The problem asks to express MG - MH in terms of MA and MB.

    1. The definition of points G and H depends on the two chords CD and EF.
       - G is derived from the circumcircle of △EMD.
       - H is derived from the circumcircle of △CMF.

    2. Let's analyze the roles of the chords. The problem's setup is symmetric
       with respect to the two chords CD and EF. Swapping their labels should
       not change the final expression in terms of MA and MB.

    3. Let's see what happens to MG - MH when we swap the chords.
       - Let's swap the labels C <-> E and D <-> F.
       - The new G (call it G') is found from the circumcircle of △(new E)M(new D),
         which is the circumcircle of △CMF. This is the circle that originally defined H.
         So, the new point G' is the same as the old point H. Thus, MG' = MH.
       - The new H (call it H') is found from the circumcircle of △(new C)M(new F),
         which is the circumcircle of △EMD. This is the circle that originally defined G.
         So, the new point H' is the same as the old point G. Thus, MH' = MG.

    4. The expression MG - MH, after swapping the chords, becomes MG' - MH', which
       is equal to MH - MG. This is the negative of the original expression.

    5. Since the underlying geometry is unchanged by a simple relabeling, the
       resultant expression in terms of MA and MB must also be unchanged.
       Let X = MG - MH. The swap shows that X must be equal to -X.

    6. The only solution to the equation X = -X is X = 0.

    7. Therefore, MG - MH = 0. This can be written as an expression in terms of
       MA and MB with coefficients of 0.
