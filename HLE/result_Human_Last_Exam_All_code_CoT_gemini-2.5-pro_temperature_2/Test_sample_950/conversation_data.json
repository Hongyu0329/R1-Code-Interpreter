    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the code to perform the necessary calculations.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Mathematical Object:** The user is asking about the \"space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$\". This space is known in mathematics as the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $Gr(3, 5)$. The object of study is its integral cohomology ring, $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, considered as an additive group.\n\n2.  **Address the Core Question:** The question is to find the \"rank of the torsion subgroup\" of this group.\n    *   The **torsion subgroup** of an abelian group consists of all elements that have a finite order.\n    *   The **rank** of an abelian group is the number of independent elements that generate its free part. For any finite group (like a non-trivial torsion subgroup), the rank is 0.\n\n3.  **Apply a Key Theorem:** A fundamental result in algebraic topology (due to Ehresmann, Chevalley, and Borel) states that the integral cohomology ring of any real Grassmannian $Gr(k, n)$ is **torsion-free**. This means its torsion subgroup is the trivial group, which contains only the zero element, i.e., $\\{0\\}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Rank:** The rank of the trivial group $\\{0\\}$ is, by definition, 0.\n\n5.  **Provide a Computational Demonstration:** Although the answer follows directly from a mathematical theorem, the request asks for a coding solution. I will provide a Python script that calculates a related property of $Gr(3, 5)$: its Betti numbers. The Betti numbers $b_i$ are the ranks of the individual cohomology groups $H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. Since these groups are torsion-free, this is their full structural description. The sum of the Betti numbers gives the rank of the entire cohomology ring. This will fulfill the requirement to provide code and to \"output each number in the final equation.\"\n\nNow, here is the Python code that implements the computational part of the plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define parameters for the Grassmannian Gr(k, n)\nk = 3\nn = 5\n\n# --- Step 1: State the direct answer based on a mathematical theorem ---\nprint(f\"The integral cohomology ring of the Grassmannian Gr({k}, {n}), denoted H*(Gr({k}, {n}); Z), is known to be torsion-free.\")\nprint(\"This means its torsion subgroup contains only the zero element, i.e., it is the trivial group {0}.\")\nprint(\"The rank of the trivial group {0} is 0.\")\nprint(\"---\")\n\n# --- Step 2: Perform a related calculation for demonstration ---\n# We calculate the Betti numbers of Gr(k, n), which are the ranks of the\n# individual cohomology groups H^i(Gr(k,n); Z).\n\n# By the duality property of Grassmannians, Gr(k, n) is diffeomorphic to Gr(n-k, n).\n# The formula for the Poincare polynomial is simpler with the smaller index, k' = min(k, n-k).\nk_calc = min(k, n - k)\n\n# The Poincare polynomial P(t) for Gr(k, n) is given by the formula:\n# P(t) = Product_{i=1 to k'} [ (1 - t^(n-i+1)) / (1 - t^i) ]\n# For Gr(2, 5), this is [(1-t^5)*(1-t^4)] / [(1-t^1)*(1-t^2)].\n\n# Calculate the numerator polynomial: Product_{i=1 to k'} (1 - t^(n-i+1))\np_num = np.poly1d([1])\nfor i in range(1, k_calc + 1):\n    power = n - i + 1\n    # Creates a polynomial like 1 - t^power\n    poly_coeffs = [1] + [0] * (power - 1) + [-1]\n    p_num = np.polymul(p_num, np.poly1d(poly_coeffs))\n\n# Calculate the denominator polynomial: Product_{i=1 to k'} (1 - t^i)\np_den = np.poly1d([1])\nfor i in range(1, k_calc + 1):\n    power = i\n    poly_coeffs = [1] + [0] * (power - 1) + [-1]\n    p_den = np.polymul(p_den, np.poly1d(poly_coeffs))\n\n# The Poincare polynomial is the quotient of the two.\npoincare_poly, remainder = np.polydiv(p_num, p_den)\n# The coefficients are the Betti numbers. We round them to the nearest integer\n# and reverse the list to have them in increasing order of index (b_0, b_1, ...).\nbetti_numbers = np.round(poincare_poly.coeffs).astype(int)[::-1]\n\nprint(f\"For context, we can compute the Betti numbers (b_i) of Gr({k}, {n}), which represent the ranks of the (torsion-free) cohomology groups H^i.\")\nfor i, b in enumerate(betti_numbers):\n    print(f\"b_{i} = {b}\")\n\n# The rank of the full cohomology ring is the sum of the Betti numbers.\n# The \"final equation\" is presented here as the sum of Betti numbers.\ntotal_rank = np.sum(betti_numbers)\nequation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, betti_numbers))\nprint(f\"\\nThe rank of the entire cohomology ring H*(Gr({k}, {n}); Z) is the sum:\")\nprint(f\"{equation_str} = {total_rank}\")\n\n# --- Step 3: Conclude with the final answer to the user's question ---\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the rank of the torsion subgroup is definitively:\")\nprint(\"0\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
