# The plan is to calculate the value of r based on the formula derived
# from the geometric and graph-theoretic analysis of the problem.
# The largest possible r is the diagonal length of the largest regular
# pentagon that can be placed in a unit square.
# The formula for this value is r = cos(18 degrees) / cos(9 degrees).

# Convert degrees to radians for Python's math functions
angle_18_deg_in_rad = math.radians(18)
angle_9_deg_in_rad = math.radians(9)

# Calculate the cosine values
cos_18 = math.cos(angle_18_deg_in_rad)
cos_9 = math.cos(angle_9_deg_in_rad)

# Calculate the final value for r
r = cos_18 / cos_9
