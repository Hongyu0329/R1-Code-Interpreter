    "To determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to find the number of permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the notation**: \\(av_n^k(\\pi)\\) represents the number of permutations of length `n` that have exactly `k` inversions and avoid the pattern `\\pi`. In this problem, we are given `n = 333`, `k = 3`, and the pattern `\\pi = 1324`.\n\n2.  **Simplify the problem**: For a fixed number of inversions `k` and a fixed pattern `\\pi` of length `m`, the number of avoiding permutations \\(av_n^k(\\pi)\\) becomes constant for sufficiently large `n`. A commonly used bound for this stability is `n >= 2k`. In our case, `k=3`, so the value of \\(av_n^3(1324)\\) is constant for `n >= 6`. Since `333` is much larger than `6`, we can find the answer by computing the value for `n=6`. The problem is thus simplified to finding \\(av_6^3(1324)\\).\n\n3.  **Computational approach**: We will write a Python script to find \\(av_6^3(1324)\\) by following these steps:\n    *   Generate all possible permutations of length 6. The total number of such permutations is `6! = 720`.\n    *   For each permutation, we will count its number of inversions.\n    *   If a permutation has exactly 3 inversions, we will then check if it avoids the `1324` pattern.\n    *   The `1324` pattern means there exists a subsequence of four elements `(p_i, p_j, p_k, p_l)` with indices `i < j < k < l` such that their values are in the relative order `p_i < p_k < p_j < p_l`.\n    *   We will count the number of permutations that satisfy both conditions (3 inversions and avoiding 1324). This count will be our final answer.\n\nThis approach is efficient and reliable for a small permutation length like 6.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_inversions(p):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of inversions in a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inversions = 0\n    n = len(p)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if p[i] > p[j]:\n                inversions += 1\n    return inversions\n\ndef has_1324_pattern(p):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a permutation contains the 1324 pattern.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    # The pattern is represented by the relative order of four elements.\n    # We look for four indices i < j < k < l such that p[i] < p[k] < p[j] < p[l].\n    for i in range(n - 3):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n - 2):\n            for k in range(j + 1, n - 1):\n                # Optimization: if p[i] >= p[k] or p[k] >= p[j], this triplet cannot form the start of a 1324 pattern\n                if not (p[i] < p[k] and p[k] < p[j]):\n                    continue\n                for l in range(k + 1, n):\n                    if p[j] < p[l]:\n                        return True\n    return False\n\ndef calculate_avoider_count(n, k, pattern_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates av_n^k(pattern).
