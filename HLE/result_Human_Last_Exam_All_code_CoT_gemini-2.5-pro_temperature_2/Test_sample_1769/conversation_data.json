    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the Modern English word for \"sister\" had the Norse language not influenced Old English.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Origin of \"Sister\"**: The current word \"sister\" is derived from Old English *sweostor*, but its modern spelling and pronunciation were heavily influenced by the Old Norse equivalent, *systir*. The Norse word essentially replaced or merged with the native English form.\n2.  **Identify the Native Word**: The original, native Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word for sister was *sweostor*.\n3.  **Trace Hypothetical Development**: To find what *sweostor* would have become, we can look at documented sound changes that occurred as Old English evolved into Middle and then Modern English.\n    *   **Vowel Simplification**: The Old English cluster *sweo-* often simplified. A common attested pathway for *sweostor* was a change to *suster* in Middle English. This involves the `w` being dropped and the vowel `eo` shifting to `u`.\n    *   **Unstressed Ending Reduction**: In many English words, the unstressed final syllable `-or` was reduced to `-er`. We see this in other family words like *brōþor* -> \"brother\" and *mōdor* -> \"mother\". Applying this change to *sustor* gives us *suster*.\n4.  **Final Form**: The form *suster* was a common Middle English word for sister before it was displaced by the Norse-influenced form. Had it continued its natural development into Modern English, it would have retained this spelling. The pronunciation of the 'u' would have changed from /ʊ/ to /ʌ/ during the \"foot-strut split,\" resulting in a word spelled \"suster\" and pronounced to rhyme with \"duster\" or \"buster.\"\n\nThe following Python code simulates this linguistic transformation.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the linguistic evolution of the Old English word for \"sister\"\n    to what it might have become in Modern English without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Start with the original Old English word.\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    print(f\"The native Old English word for sister was: {old_english_word}\")\n\n    # 2. Apply the first major sound change: the 'sweo' cluster simplifies to 'su'.\n    # This was a common path, resulting in the attested Middle English form \"suster\".\n    # old_english_word[0] + old_english_word[3:] gives us \"sstor\", not what we want.\n    # old_english_word.replace(\"weo\", \"u\") gives us \"sustor\".\n    middle_english_form = \"sustor\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: The 'sweo' vowel cluster simplified to 'su'. Transformation: {old_english_word} -> {middle_english_form}\")\n\n    # 3. Apply the second major sound change: the unstressed ending '-or' reduces to '-er'.\n    # This is a consistent change seen in words like brother (from brōþor).\n    final_form = middle_english_form.replace(\"or\", \"er\")\n    print(f\"Step 2: The unstressed ending '-or' reduced to '-er'. Transformation: {middle_english_form} -> {final_form}\")\n\n    # 4. Present the final result.\n    print(f\"\\nConclusion: Without the influence from Old Norse 'systir', the native word '{old_english_word}' would have most likely evolved into '{final_form}'.\")\n\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
