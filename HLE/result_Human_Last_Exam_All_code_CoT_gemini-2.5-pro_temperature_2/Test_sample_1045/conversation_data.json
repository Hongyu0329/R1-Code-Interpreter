    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) calculation with the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name (6-31G):**\n    *   **6-**: Represents the core electrons. Each core atomic orbital is described by a single contracted function, which is a combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   **-31**: Represents the valence electrons. The valence shell is split into two parts (a \"split-valence\" or \"double-zeta valence\" basis set). The inner part is described by one contracted function per orbital made from 3 primitives, and the outer part is described by one contracted function per orbital made from 1 primitive.\n\n2.  **Count Functions for Each Atom Type:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** It is a first-row atom with core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) electrons.\n        *   Core (1s): 1 contracted function.\n        *   Valence (2s, 2p): The s and three p orbitals are split.\n            *   Inner valence (2s', 2px', 2py', 2pz'): 1s + 3p = 4 contracted functions.\n            *   Outer valence (2s'', 2px'', 2py'', 2pz''): 1s + 3p = 4 contracted functions.\n        *   Total per C atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 functions.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** It has only a valence electron (1s).\n        *   Valence (1s): The s orbital is split.\n            *   Inner valence (1s'): 1 contracted function.\n            *   Outer valence (1s''): 1 contracted function.\n        *   Total per H atom = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = 2 functions.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total for Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   Sum the functions for all 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe following Python script will perform the final calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in Toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 core (1s) + 4 inner valence (2s, 2p) + 4 outer valence (2s, 2p) = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1 inner valence (1s) + 1 outer valence (1s) = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions contributed by each element\ntotal_from_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_from_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the grand total\ntotal_functions = total_from_carbon + total_from_hydrogen\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation and the final result\nprint(f\"For toluene (C{num_carbon_atoms}H{num_hydrogen_atoms}) with the 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Each carbon atom contributes {functions_per_carbon} functions.\")\nprint(f\"Each hydrogen atom contributes {functions_per_hydrogen} functions.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon_atoms} C atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/C) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} H atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/H) = {total_functions}\")\nprint(f\"{total_from_carbon} + {total_from_hydrogen} = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
