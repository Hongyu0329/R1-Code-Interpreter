The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the generalized dihedral groups `Dih(H)`. These are formed as the semidirect product `H ⋊ Z₂`, where `H` is any abelian group of order `q^m`, and the generator of `Z₂` acts on `H` by inversion (i.e., `h ↦ h⁻¹` for all `h ∈ H`).
