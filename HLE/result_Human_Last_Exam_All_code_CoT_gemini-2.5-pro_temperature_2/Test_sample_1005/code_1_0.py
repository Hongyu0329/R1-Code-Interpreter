# Based on the symbolic derivation, the value of the definite integral is 2^(15/16).
# The final equation is: Integral = base^(numerator/denominator)

base = 2
numerator = 15
denominator = 16

# Calculate the value
value = math.pow(base, numerator / denominator)

# Print the components of the final equation and the result
print(f"The equation for the result is: {base}^({numerator}/{denominator})")
