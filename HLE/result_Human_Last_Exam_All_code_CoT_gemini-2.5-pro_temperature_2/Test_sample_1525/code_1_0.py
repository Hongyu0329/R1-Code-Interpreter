    # A: The segregation process relies on an "order of appearance", which is ambiguous
    # for set-based Datalog programs. This makes the definition ill-defined without
    # further specification. So, the statement is correct.
    is_A_correct = True

    # B: This statement misrepresents the central claim. The claim is about the program's
    # evaluation on a set of facts, P(S₀), not just syntactic equality of programs.
    # The reasoning within the statement is also flawed. So, the statement is incorrect.
    is_B_correct = False

    # C: Aggregation (γ) can map multiple distinct constants to one, losing information.

    # Therefore, γ⁻¹[γ[P]] is generally not identical to P. The statement is correct.

    # D: The definition for segregation, while complex, uses a `Union` operator. This
    # explicitly points towards generating all specified combinations, not replacing with a
    # "single representative". The statement's claim of ambiguity in this specific regard is incorrect.

    # evaluating at the coarse level (P(S₀)) yields the same result as refining to a
    # detailed level, evaluating, and then coarsening the result. It correctly frames this
    # as coarse-grained inference not losing information. The statement is correct.
