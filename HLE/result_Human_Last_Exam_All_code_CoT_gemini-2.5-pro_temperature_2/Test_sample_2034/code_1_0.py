# The problem asks for the determination of constants c1 and c2 in an inequality
# related to the beta-SVM model. A theoretical analysis based on perturbation
# theory and the KKT conditions of the optimization problem yields specific
# values for these constants.

# Determined value for the constant c1
c1 = 2

# Determined value for the constant c2
c2 = 1

# We print the final determined values for c1 and c2.
# These values make the inequality hold for small beta.
print(f"The constant c1 is: {c1}")
print(f"The constant c2 is: {c2}")

# The final inequality is:
# - (K * alpha_D-i)_i <= +(1 + 2*beta)*alpha_D_i - (1 + 1*beta)*(K * alpha_D)_i + o(beta)
# As requested, here are each of the numbers in the final equation's beta-coefficients:

print("Numbers in the final equation's coefficients:")
print(f"From (1 + c1*beta): 1, {c1}")
print(f"From -(1 + c2*beta): 1, {c2}")
