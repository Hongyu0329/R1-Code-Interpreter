    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent of 「弟」 (otouto), we can use a program to look up this information. The program will store the definitions of the main pitch accent types and then identify and explain the correct one for the specified word.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the four main types of Japanese pitch accent: Heiban, Atamadaka, Nakadaka, and Odaka.\n2.  Identify the correct pitch accent for the word 「弟」, which is read as 「おとうと」.\n3.  Based on linguistic data, the pitch accent for 「おとうと」 is [0], which corresponds to the Heiban (平板) pattern.\n4.  The program will print the word, its correct pattern, and an explanation of how the Heiban pitch works for this specific word.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_kanji = \"弟\"\n    word_reading = \"おとうと (otouto)\"\n    correct_pattern_name = \"Heiban\"\n    pitch_notation = \"[0]\"\n\n    # Dictionary explaining the different pitch accent patterns\n    patterns = {\n        \"Heiban\": \"The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and remains high to the end of the word. A following particle is also high.\",\n        \"Atamadaka\": \"The pitch is high only on the first mora and drops from the second mora onwards.\",\n        \"Nakadaka\": \"The pitch rises after the first mora and falls on a specific mora in the middle of the word.\",\n        \"Odaka\": \"The pitch rises after the first mora and stays high until the last mora. A following particle is pronounced low, causing a drop after the word.\"\n    }\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(f\"Word: {word_kanji} ({word_reading})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The standard pitch accent pattern is: {correct_pattern_name} ({pitch_notation})\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(f\"The '{correct_pattern_name}' pattern means: {patterns[correct_pattern_name]}\")\n    \n    # Illustrate the pattern for the specific word\n    # おとうと has 4 morae: お(o), と(to), う(u), と(to)\n    print(\"\\nFor 「おとうと」, the pitch contour is:\")\n    print(\"Mora 1 (お): Low\")\n    print(\"Mora 2 (と): High\")\n    print(\"Mora 3 (う): High\")\n    print(\"Mora 4 (と): High\")\n    print(\"Pattern: L-H-H-H\")\n\nfind_pitch_accent()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
