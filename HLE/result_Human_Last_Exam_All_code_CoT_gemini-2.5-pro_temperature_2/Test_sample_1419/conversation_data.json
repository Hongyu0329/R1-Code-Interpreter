    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in `ϕ⁴` theory near four dimensions, we use the renormalization group (RG) framework.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Beta Function:** We start with the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling `u` in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions. The beta function describes how the coupling changes with the energy scale.\n    `β(u) = μ(du/dμ) = -ϵu + B u² + O(u³)`\n    The `-ϵu` term arises from the engineering dimension of the coupling, and the `u²` term comes from one-loop quantum corrections. For the standard single-component scalar `ϕ⁴` theory, the constant `B` has been calculated to be `3 / (8π²)`.\n\n2.  **Fixed Point Condition:** A fixed point `u*` represents a scale-invariant point in the theory, where the RG flow halts. This is mathematically defined by the condition `β(u*) = 0`.\n    `-ϵu* + (3 / (8π²)) (u*)² = 0`\n\n3.  **Solve for u*:** We will solve this equation for `u*`. There are two solutions: the trivial Gaussian fixed point (`u* = 0`) and the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which governs the critical behavior of the system. We are interested in the latter.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to symbolically define and solve the fixed point equation. The script will then print the final expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, `u*`, explicitly showing how it depends on `ϵ` and outputting each component of the resulting formula.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbols for the calculation\n    u_star = sp.Symbol('u^*')\n    epsilon = sp.Symbol('epsilon')\n    pi = sp.pi\n\n    # In phi^4 theory in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions, the one-loop beta function\n    # for the dimensionless coupling 'u' is beta(u) = -epsilon*u + B*u^2.\n    # The constant B for the single-component theory is 3 / (8*pi^2).\n    B = 3 / (8 * pi**2)\n\n    # The fixed point u* is found by solving beta(u*) = 0.\n    # We construct the equation: -epsilon*u* + B*(u*)^2 = 0\n    fixed_point_equation = sp.Eq(-epsilon * u_star + B * u_star**2, 0)\n\n    # Solve the equation for u*.
