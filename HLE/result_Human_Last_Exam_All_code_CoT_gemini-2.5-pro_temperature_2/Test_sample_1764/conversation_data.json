    "To find the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$, we need to see what values this number can take by choosing $X$ and $B$ appropriately. The number of embeddings is a non-negative integer. If we can find a specific space $X$ and a specific space $B$ for which there are zero embeddings, then 0 would be the smallest possible number.\n\nHere is my plan to demonstrate this:\n1.  I will construct a simple finite ultrametric space, which I will call $X$. It will have four points.\n2.  I will choose a simple, common Banach space, $B$, which will be the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual absolute value distance.\n3.  I will then show, through a logical proof by contradiction, that no isometric embedding of this specific $X$ into this specific $B$ can exist. The Python script below will walk through this proof step-by-step.\n4.  Since there are no embeddings in this case, the number of embeddings is 0. As this number cannot be negative, 0 is the smallest possible number.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates that the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings\n    from a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B is 0.\n\n    It does this by constructing a specific X and B for which no embedding exists.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The setup\")\n    print(\"Let X be a finite ultrametric space with four points {x1, x2, x3, x4}.\")\n    print(\"Let the distances d(x_i, x_j) be defined as follows:\")\n    d_x1_x2 = 1\n    d_x3_x4 = 1\n    d_x1_x3 = 2\n    d_x1_x4 = 2\n    d_x2_x3 = 2\n    d_x2_x4 = 2\n    print(f\"d(x1, x2) = {d_x1_x2}\")\n    print(f\"d(x3, x4) = {d_x3_x4}\")\n    print(f\"d(x1, x3) = d(x1, x4) = d(x2, x3) = d(x2, x4) = {d_x1_x3}\")\n    print(\"\\nLet B be the Banach space of real numbers (R) with the usual distance |a - b|.\")\n    print(\"An isometric embedding is a function f: X -> R that preserves these distances.\")\n    print(\"This means we need to find four points p1, p2, p3, p4 in R such that |pi - pj| = d(xi, xj).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The proof by contradiction\")\n    print(\"Let's assume such an embedding f exists, where f(x1)=p1, f(x2)=p2, f(x3)=p3, f(x4)=p4.\")\n    \n    # We can shift the entire set of points without changing their relative distances.\n    # This is equivalent to composing the embedding f with a translation, which is an isometry of R.\n    # Let's set p1 = 0 for simplicity.\n    p1 = 0\n    print(f\"Due to translational symmetry, we can set p1 = {p1} without loss of generality.\")\n    \n    # Now use the distance conditions from p1.\n    print(f\"\\nThe condition |p1 - p3| = d(x1, x3) means |{p1} - p3| = {d_x1_x3}.\")\n    print(f\"This implies p3 must be either {d_x1_x3} or -{d_x1_x3}.\")\n    \n    print(f\"Similarly, the condition |p1 - p4| = d(x1, x4) means |{p1} - p4| = {d_x1_x4}.\")\n    print(f\"This implies p4 must be either {d_x1_x4} or -{d_x1_x4}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nAn isometric embedding of a metric space must be injective, so f(x3) cannot equal f(x4).\")\n    print(\"This means p3 != p4.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, one of p3, p4 must be {d_x1_x3} and the other must be -{d_x1_x3}.\")\n    \n    p3 = 2\n    p4 = -2\n    print(f\"Let's choose p3 = {p3} and p4 = {p4}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: The Contradiction\")\n    print(\"Now we check if the other distance conditions are met.\")\n    print(f\"Let's look at the required distance d(x3, x4) = {d_x3_x4}.\")\n    print(f\"The corresponding equation for our points in R is |p3 - p4| = {d_x3_x4}.\")\n    \n    calculated_distance = abs(p3 - p4)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nLet's calculate the actual distance |p3 - p4| with our values:\")\n    print(f\"|{p3} - ({p4})| = {calculated_distance}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nWe have derived that |p3 - p4| must be {calculated_distance}, but the problem requires this distance to be {d_x3_x4}.\")\n    print(f\"The equation {calculated_distance} = {d_x3_x4} is false.
