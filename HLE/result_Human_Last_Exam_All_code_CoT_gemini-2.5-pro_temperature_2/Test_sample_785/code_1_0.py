# The problem is to find the number of orbits |S/G|.
# Based on the analysis of the relations, any tuple (A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4) in S
# must satisfy A_1 = A_2 = A_3 = A_4 = A, where A is a 1000x1000 complex matrix
# satisfying A^2 = I.

# The action of G = GL(1000) on such a tuple is by simultaneous conjugation:
# B * (A, A, A, A) = (BAB^{-1}, BAB^{-1}, BAB^{-1}, BAB^{-1}).
# The orbits are therefore in one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes
# of matrices A such that A^2 = I.

# A matrix A such that A^2 = I is diagonalizable and its eigenvalues can only be +1 or -1.
# The conjugacy class of such a matrix is completely determined by the number of its
# eigenvalues equal to -1. Let this number be k.
# Since A is a 1000x1000 matrix, the number of eigenvalues is 1000.
# The possible values for k are integers from 0 to 1000.
# k=0: All eigenvalues are +1, so A is the identity matrix I.
# k=1000: All eigenvalues are -1, so A is -I.
# In general, k can be any integer in {0, 1, 2, ..., 1000}.

# The number of possible values for k is the number of orbits.
n = 1000
num_orbits = n + 1

# We print the calculation explicitly.
print(f"The number of conjugacy classes for a 1000x1000 matrix A with A^2=I is determined by the number of -1 eigenvalues, k.")
print(f"k can be any integer from 0 to 1000.")
print(f"The total number of possibilities for k is 1000 - 0 + 1 = 1001.")
print(f"So the number of orbits is {n} + {1} = {num_orbits}.")

# The final answer requested
# print(f"<<<{num_orbits}>>>")
