    Calculates and explains a minimax lower bound based on Le Cam's method.

    The minimax risk R_n^* for an estimator is bounded below by reducing the
    estimation problem to a hypothesis testing problem between a null hypothesis P_0
    and a mixture of alternatives (1/N) * sum(P_j). The performance in this
    testing problem is limited by the statistical distance (measured by KL divergence)
    between the hypotheses.

        delta (float): The minimum separation between the parameter theta_0 and
                       any alternative theta_j, i.e., delta = min_j rho(theta_0, theta_j).
        Phi (function): A non-decreasing function for the loss Phi(rho(.,.)).
