    1.  Magnesium acts as a natural calcium channel blocker. Calcium is essential for muscle contraction. For the smooth muscles in the walls of your blood vessels to contract, calcium must enter the muscle cells.
    2.  Magnesium competes with calcium and blocks its entry into these vascular smooth muscle cells.
    3.  This inhibition of calcium influx leads to the relaxation of the muscle cells.
    4.  When the smooth muscles in the vessel walls relax, the blood vessels widen. This process is called vasodilation.
    5.  Vasodilation reduces peripheral resistance to blood flow, which directly results in a lowering of blood pressure.
    
    Therefore, the primary mechanism by which magnesium helps lower blood pressure is through direct vasodilation.
