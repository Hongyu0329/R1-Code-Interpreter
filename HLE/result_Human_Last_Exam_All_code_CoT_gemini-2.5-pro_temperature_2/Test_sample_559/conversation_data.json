    "Of course, I can help you with this task. Here is my plan to find the separatrix for the given system of differential equations:\n\n### Plan\n1.  A separatrix in a dynamical system is a special trajectory that divides the phase plane into regions with different long-term behaviors. These special trajectories are often the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle-type equilibrium points.\n2.  Our first step is to find all the equilibrium points of the system in the `u >= 0` phase plane. An equilibrium point `(d, u)` is a point where both `d'(t)` and `u'(t)` are zero.\n3.  Next, we'll analyze the stability of these equilibrium points by computing the Jacobian matrix and its eigenvalues at each point. This will allow us to identify the saddle point(s).\n4.  The separatrix corresponds to the unstable manifold of the saddle point. We will find the unstable eigenvector at the saddle, which gives the initial direction of the separatrix.\n5.  By numerically integrating forward and backward in time from a point very close to the saddle along the unstable direction, we can trace the path of the entire separatrix curve.\n6.  By observing the shape of this numerically-computed curve, we can hypothesize its analytical form. A common approach is to look for a simple polynomial relationship between `d` and `u`. We will test the hypothesis that the curve is a parabola, `d = -u^2`.\n7.  Finally, we will verify this hypothesis by comparing the analytical curve to the numerical data and then present the equation of the separatrix and its components.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy import linalg\nfrom scipy.integrate import solve_ivp\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a system of ODEs to find its separatrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the system and find equilibrium points\n    def system(t, y):\n        \"\"\"Defines the system of differential equations.\"\"\"\n        d, u = y\n        # The line u=0 is an invariant manifold, so trajectories starting with u>=0 will remain in this half-plane.\n        d_prime = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1 - u)\n        u_prime = u**2 * (u - 1)\n        return [d_prime, u_prime]\n\n    def find_equilibria_func(y):\n        \"\"\"Function to find roots for, representing equilibrium points.\"\"\"\n        return system(0, y)\n\n    # Find equilibrium points using initial guesses derived from analytical inspection.\n    # From u'(t) = 0, we get u=0 or u=1.\n    # If u=0, d'(t)=2d^2 => d=0.
