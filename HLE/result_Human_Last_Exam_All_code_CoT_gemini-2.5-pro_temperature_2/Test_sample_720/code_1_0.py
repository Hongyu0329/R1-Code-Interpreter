    Here is a step-by-step derivation of the minimum curvature cost for the NGD update.

    1.  **Analyze the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)**
        -   The model is a linear network: `f(x; W) = Wx`, where `W` is a `d x d` matrix. The parameters `θ` are the flattened elements of `W`, so `θ` is a `d^2 x 1` vector.
        -   For a least squares loss, the FIM `F` is given by the expectation of the outer product of the Jacobians of the output with respect to the parameters. For the empirical FIM over `n` samples `(x_1, ..., x_n)`, this is `F = (1/n) * Σ_i J_i^T J_i`.
        -   The Jacobian `J_i = ∇_θ f(x_i; W)` can be shown to be `I_d ⊗ x_i^T`.
        -   Therefore, `F = (1/n) * Σ_i (I_d ⊗ x_i^T)^T (I_d ⊗ x_i^T) = I_d ⊗ ((1/n) Σ_i x_i x_i^T)`.
        -   Let `X = [x_1, ..., x_n]` be the `d x n` data matrix. The sample covariance matrix is `C = (1/n)XX^T`.
        -   So, the FIM has a Kronecker product structure: `F = I_d ⊗ C`.

    2.  **Simplify the Inversion Target**
        -   The term to be inverted is `M = F + αI = (I_d ⊗ C) + αI_{d^2}`.
        -   Using the identity `I_{d^2} = I_d ⊗ I_d`, we get `M = I_d ⊗ C + α(I_d ⊗ I_d) = I_d ⊗ (C + αI_d)`.
        -   The NGD update requires computing the vector `v = M⁻¹ g`. Due to the block-diagonal structure of `M` (as a result of the Kronecker product), this computation decouples. If we partition the `d^2` gradient vector `g` into `d` blocks `g_j` of size `d`, the update for each corresponding block of parameters `v_j` is `v_j = (C + αI_d)⁻¹ g_j`.
        -   This means the problem is reduced from one huge `d^2 x d^2` inversion to `d` independent `d x d` inversions (or solving `d` linear systems).

    3.  **Apply the Woodbury Matrix Identity**
        -   The matrix to be inverted is `C_reg = C + αI_d = (1/n)XX^T + αI_d`.
        -   Naively inverting this `d x d` matrix costs `O(d^3)`.
        -   However, since `n < d`, the matrix `XX^T` has rank at most `n`. We can exploit this low-rank structure using the Woodbury matrix identity.
        -   The identity allows us to compute the inverse (or solve a linear system) by inverting a much smaller `n x n` matrix of the form `(I_n + (1/(nα)) X^T X)`. The cost of inverting this `n x n` matrix is only `O(n^3)`.

    4.  **Calculate Total Computational Cost**
        -   To compute the full update efficiently, we don't form the inverse explicitly. We solve the `d` linear systems `(C_reg) v_j = g_j`.
        -   The overall process involves a pre-computation step and a loop over the `d` blocks.
        -   **Pre-computation**:
            a) Compute `G = X^T X` (an `n x n` matrix): This costs `O(n^2 * d)`.
            b) Form and compute the LU decomposition of the `n x n` matrix `M_inv = (nαI_n + G)`: This costs `O(n^3)`.
        -   **Main Loop** (for each of the `d` blocks):
            a) For each `g_j`, solve the linear system using the Woodbury formula and the pre-computed LU decomposition. This involves matrix-vector products.
            b) The main cost driver in this loop for each block is `O(n*d)`. Since this is done `d` times, the total cost for the loop is `O(n * d^2)`.
    
    5.  **Identify the Dominant Term and Final Answer**
        -   The total cost is the sum of the costs from all steps: `Cost = O(n^2 * d) + O(n^3) + O(n * d^2)`.
        -   Given the condition `n < d`, we can compare the terms:
            - `n^3` vs `n^2 * d`: `n^3 = n * n^2 < d * n^2`. So `O(n^3)` is smaller.
            - `n^2 * d` vs `n * d^2`: `n^2 * d = n * (nd) < n * (d*d) = n * d^2`. So `O(n^2 * d)` is smaller.
        -   The asymptotically dominant term is therefore `O(n * d^2)`.

    Therefore, the minimum curvature cost achievable in the NGD update rule is O(n * d^2).
