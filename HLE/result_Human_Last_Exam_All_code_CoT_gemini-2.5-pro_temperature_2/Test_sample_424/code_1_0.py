# This script formalizes the reasoning for finding the number of points
# whose removal disconnects the described planar set into three or more components.

# The points that can create more than two components are junction points
# where multiple paths or branches of the set meet.
# We analyze each major junction point.

# --- Analysis of Point (0, 1) ---
# This point is where the unit circle, the upper spoke, and the horizontal bar intersect.
# Removing this point separates several "dangling arms" from the main figure.
# 1. The arm from the horizontal bar to the left: [-1/2, 0) x {1}
# 2. The arm from the horizontal bar to the right: (0, 1/2] x {1}
# 3. The arm from the upper spoke going up: {0} x (1, 3/2]
# 4. The arm from the upper spoke going down towards the origin: {0} x [1/2, 1)
# These four arms become separate components.
# The rest of the figure remains connected, forming a fifth component.
num_components_at_p1 = 4 + 1
is_solution_p1 = num_components_at_p1 >= 3

# --- Analysis of Point (-1, 0) ---
# This point connects the unit circle to the left spoke: [-3/2, -1/2] x {0}.
# This spoke is only connected to the figure at this point. Removing (-1, 0) splits the spoke.
# 1. The arm of the spoke going left: [-3/2, -1) x {0}
# 2. The arm of the spoke going right (towards origin): (-1, -1/2] x {0}
# These two arms become separate components.
# The rest of the figure remains connected, forming a third component.
num_components_at_p2 = 2 + 1
is_solution_p2 = num_components_at_p2 >= 3

# --- Analysis of other points like (1,0) and (0,-1) ---
# Removing (1,0) results in separating one arm ([1/2, 1) x {0}) and the rest,
# leading to 2 components.
# Removing (0,-1) results in separating one arm ({0} x [-1/2,-1)) and the rest,
# leading to 2 components.
# Thus, they are not solutions.

# --- Calculate the total number of points ---
