    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the relevant knots:** I will list all knots with four or fewer crossings. These are the unknot (0 crossings), the trefoil knot (3 crossings), and the figure-eight knot (4 crossings). I'll also need to consider both orientations (right-handed and left-handed) of the trefoil knot, as they can yield different results.\n2.  **Understand the surgery:** The question concerns integral surgery on these knots to create homology 3-spheres. This occurs precisely when the surgery coefficient is +1 or -1.\n3.  **Apply key topological results:** I will use established theorems from low-dimensional topology to determine the homology cobordism class of each resulting 3-manifold. A key result is that certain surgeries yield manifolds that are homology cobordant to the standard 3-sphere (S³), which represents the trivial element in the group. Other surgeries yield non-trivial elements. The main non-trivial manifold that appears here is the Poincaré homology sphere.\n4.  **Count the distinct elements:** I will systematically go through each knot and its ±1 surgeries, identify the resulting homology cobordism class (trivial, Poincaré sphere, or its mirror image), and count the total number of unique elements generated.\n\nI will write a Python script to automate this counting process based on these known topological facts. The script will define the knots, the results of their surgeries, and then calculate and print the total number of unique elements found.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements representable\n    by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n    The solution relies on known results from low-dimensional topology regarding\n    which surgeries on specific knots produce homology spheres that are\n    trivial in the homology cobordism group.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The homology cobordism group elements are identified by names.\n    # 'trivial' represents the class of the 3-sphere S^3.\n    # 'poincare' represents the class of the Poincare homology sphere.\n    # 'poincare_mirror' represents the class of its mirror image.\n    # These three are known to be distinct elements.\n\n    # Dictionary to store the results of +/- 1 surgery for each knot.\n    # Key: knot name, Value: (result of +1 surgery, result of -1 surgery)\n    surgery_results = collections.OrderedDict({\n        \"Unknot (0_1)\": (\"trivial\", \"trivial\"),\n        \"Right-handed Trefoil (3_1)\": (\"poincare\", \"trivial\"),\n        \"Left-handed Trefoil (mirror 3_1)\": (\"trivial\", \"poincare_mirror\"),\n        \"Figure-eight Knot (4_1)\": (\"trivial\", \"trivial\")\n    })\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of elements from surgery on knots with at most 4 crossings:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    unique_elements = set()\n    knot_contributions = {}\n\n    for knot, results in surgery_results.items():\n        initial_count = len(unique_elements)\n        plus_one_surgery_result, minus_one_surgery_result = results\n        \n        # Add the elements from the surgeries to our set of unique elements\n        unique_elements.add(plus_one_surgery_result)\n        unique_elements.add(minus_one_surgery_result)\n        \n        # Calculate how many *new* elements this knot contributed\n        new_elements_count = len(unique_elements) - initial_count\n        knot_contributions[knot] = new_elements_count\n        \n        print(f\"Knot: {knot}\")\n        print(f\"  +1 surgery yields the '{plus_one_surgery_result}' element.\")\n        print(f\"  -1 surgery yields the '{minus_one_surgery_result}' element.\")\n        print(f\"  New elements contributed by this knot: {new_elements_count}\\n\")\n\n\n    print(\"Summary of contributions:\")\n    total = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n    for knot, count in knot_contributions.items():\n        print(f\"  Contribution from {knot}: {count}\")\n        total += count\n        equation_parts.append(str(count))\n    \n    equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Total number of unique elements = {equation} = {total}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe distinct elements found are:\")\n    for element in sorted(list(unique_elements)):\n        print(f\"  - {element}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThus, the total number of distinct elements is {total}.\")\n    \n    # Returning the final answer for the wrapper\n    return total\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    final_answer = solve_homology_cobordism_question()\n    # The format below is for the final answer extraction.\n    # print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\n```\n<<<3>>>"
