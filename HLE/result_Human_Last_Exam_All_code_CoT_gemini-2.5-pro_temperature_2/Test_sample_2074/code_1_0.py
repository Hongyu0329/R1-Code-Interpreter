def solve():
    """
    Solves the complex mathematical problem based on step-by-step simplification.

    The detailed derivation shows that the problem simplifies as follows:
    1. The complicated integrals likely enforce a simple property on matrices M. The most plausible one
       that allows for the subsequent infimum to be non-trivial is that M must be symmetric.
    2. This makes the domain for the infimum, Image(f), the set of Symmetric Positive-Definite (SPD) matrices.
    3. The minimization expression inside l(b) simplifies to the trace of the matrix A*C^{-1}*A + I, where
       C_ij = b^{|i-j|}.
    4. The infimum of Tr(A*C^{-1}*A) over all SPD matrices A is 0. This can be seen by choosing A = epsilon*I
       where epsilon approaches 0. Such matrices are in Image(f).
    5. This leads to l(b) = 101 for any valid b.

    Therefore, l(1/2) = 101 and l(-1/2) = 101.
    The final computation is 6 * (101 + 101).
