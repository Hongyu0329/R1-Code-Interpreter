    print("Let D be the poset of real numbers with the natural order (R, <=).")
    print("The 1-skeleton of the nerve of D is a graph whose vertices are the real numbers, and an edge connects any two distinct numbers.")
    print("The problem states to consider this 'as a directed graph'. The natural orientation given the poset D is to have a directed edge from u to v if and only if u < v. Let's call this directed graph G.")
    print("The graph G is acyclic because the '<' relation is transitive and irreflexive. A cycle like u < v < ... < u is impossible.")
    print("X is the line graph of G. The vertices of X are the edges of G. So, a vertex of X is an ordered pair (u, v) representing an edge in G, which requires u < v.")
    print("An edge exists in the directed line graph X from a vertex e1=(u,v) to a vertex e2=(a,b) if the head of e1 matches the tail of e2, i.e., v = a.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: Understand the Clique Number Calculation")
    print("The 'clique number' of a directed graph X usually refers to the size of the largest clique in its underlying undirected graph, U(X).")
    print("A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.")
    print("Two vertices in X, e1=(u1, v1) and e2=(u2, v2), are adjacent in U(X) if there is an edge between them in X in at least one direction.")
    print("This means their adjacency condition is: (head of e1 = tail of e2) OR (head of e2 = tail of e1).")
    print("In formula, this is: (v1 = u2) or (v2 = u1).")

    print("\nStep 3: Establish an Upper Bound for the Clique Number")
    print("Let's test if a clique of size 3, {e1, e2, e3}, can exist.")
    print("This would require e1, e2, and e3 to be pairwise adjacent.")
    print("A crucial observation follows from the adjacency condition: ")
    print(" - A clique cannot contain two edges that start at the same vertex in G (e.g., (a, b) and (a, c)). The adjacency check for these two fails because b != a and c != a.")
    print(" - Similarly, a clique cannot contain two edges that end at the same vertex in G (e.g., (b, a) and (c, a)).")
    print("This means for any clique, the set of tail-endpoints and the set of head-endpoints must each consist of distinct numbers.")
    print("For any clique of size k > 2, it can be proven that the set of its tail-endpoints must be identical to the set of its head-endpoints. Let this set be S.")
    print("This implies the edges in the clique must form a permutation of the vertices in S, breaking down into one or more disjoint cycles.")
    print("For example, a 3-clique would correspond to a cycle in G, such as edges (s1, s2), (s2, s3), (s3, s1).")
    print("For these edges to exist in G, we must have the inequalities s1 < s2, s2 < s3, and s3 < s1, which simplifies to the contradiction s1 < s1.")
    print("Since the graph G is acyclic, no such structure is possible for any size k >= 2 (for k=2 it is a path, not a cycle). A cycle is required for a clique of size k >= 3 to fulfill the all-to-all adjacency.")
    print("Therefore, no clique of size 3 or more can exist. The clique number is at most 2.")

    print("\nStep 4: Establish a Lower Bound for the Clique Number")
    print("We can demonstrate a clique of size 2 exists.")
    print("Let's pick three real numbers, for example, 1, 2, and 3, satisfying 1 < 2 < 3.")
    print("Construct two edges from G: e1 = (1, 2) and e2 = (2, 3).")
    print("e1 and e2 are valid vertices in the line graph X.")
    print("To check if they are adjacent, we check the condition: (v1 = u2) or (v2 = u1).")
    print("Here, e1 has head v1 = 2, and e2 has tail u2 = 2. Since v1 = u2, they are adjacent.")
    print("The set {e1, e2}, which is {(1, 2), (2, 3)}, forms a clique of size 2.")
    print("This shows that the clique number is at least 2.")

    print("\nStep 5: Conclusion")
    print("The clique number is at most 2 and at least 2.")
    clique_number = 2
    print("Therefore, the clique number of X is exactly 2.")
    print("Final Equation: CliqueNumber(X) = 2")
