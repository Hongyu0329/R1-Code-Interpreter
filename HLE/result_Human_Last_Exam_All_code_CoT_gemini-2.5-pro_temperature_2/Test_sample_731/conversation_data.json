    "This problem requires understanding the structure of semidihedral groups and a concept called \"power subgroups\". I will first define these terms, then analyze the subgroups generated by taking powers of all elements in the group, and finally count the number of unique subgroups that result from this process.\n\n### My plan:\n1.  **Define the Semidihedral Group `SD_512`:** I will state the presentation of the group, which defines its structure through generators and relations. `SD_512` is of order `2^9`.\n2.  **Define \"Power Subgroup\":** A power subgroup `G^n` is the subgroup generated by the `n`-th powers of all elements in `G`.\n3.  **Analyze `G^n` for odd `n`:** I'll show that for any odd integer `n`, the resulting power subgroup `G^n` is the entire group `G` itself. This accounts for one unique subgroup.\n4.  **Analyze `G^n` for even `n`:** For even `n`, I'll demonstrate that `G^n` simplifies to a cyclic subgroup of the one generated by the element `r`.\n5.  **Count the distinct subgroups:** I will systematically count how many different cyclic subgroups arise from the previous step. This will depend on the power of 2 that divides `n`.\n6.  **Sum the results:** I will add the count of subgroups from odd `n` and even `n` to get the final total.\n\nThis analysis is implemented in the Python code below, which walks through the mathematical reasoning step-by-step and prints the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the number of power subgroups\n    in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # General parameters for the semidihedral group SD_{2^k}\n    # For SD_512, k=9\n    k = 9\n    group_order = 2**k\n    r_order = 2**(k - 1)\n    \n    print(\"### Analysis of Power Subgroups in the Semidihedral Group of size 512 ###\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the Group and the Question\")\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_order}, denoted SD_{group_order}, is defined by the presentation:\")\n    print(f\"G = <r, s | r^{r_order} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{{{2**(k-2) - 1}}}>\")\n    print(f\"For size 512, k=9.
