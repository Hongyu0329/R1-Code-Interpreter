    This function explains the reasoning and prints the final answer.
    The problem is a theoretical one in point-set topology and topological groups.
    The final answer is a cardinal number, not a standard integer or float.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. We show that the conditions on the group G allow for it to be connected but not locally connected. A solenoid group is a key example that fulfills all criteria (Hausdorff, cardinality c, and the special neighborhood property).
    2. In a space that is not locally connected, open subsets can have non-open components.
    3. We leverage the local structure of a solenoid, which is homeomorphic to the product of a Cantor set (C) and an interval (I), i.e., C x I. The Cantor set has cardinality c (the continuum).
    4. We construct an open set within this local structure, U = C x (0, 1).
    5. The components of this set U are the "fibers" {c} x (0, 1) for each c in the Cantor set C.
    6. There are |C| = c such components.
    7. None of these components are open. An open neighborhood of a point (c, y) must contain points (c', y) with c' != c, because the Cantor set has no isolated points.
    8. This construction yields c non-open components. The number of components cannot exceed the cardinality of the group itself, which is c.
    9. Thus, the largest possible number is c.

    # The symbol for the cardinality of the continuum is often denoted by a lowercase 'c' or a Fraktur 'c'.
    # In the context of python, we will represent this symbol as a string.
    continuum_cardinality_symbol = 'c'

    # There is no numerical calculation or equation to output.
    # The question asks for the largest possible number, which is a cardinality.
    # We print the symbol representing this cardinality.
    print("The largest possible number of non-open components is the cardinality of the continuum.")
    print(f"This is represented by the symbol: {continuum_cardinality_symbol}")
