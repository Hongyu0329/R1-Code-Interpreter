    Analyzes a poem to determine the meaning behind a specific phrase.

    The task is to identify the two key reasons why the author of "Archipelago"
    says the sea "measures and re-measures/distance".

    Analysis Steps:
    1.  The phrase "measures and re-measures" points to a rhythmic, repetitive action.
        The most obvious physical action of the sea that fits this description is the
        movement of the tides. The tides constantly shift the shoreline, changing the
        distance between land and sea. The poem's final line, "And the moon unveils
        herself," reinforces this interpretation, as the moon directly controls the tides.
        This covers the first reason: "to show the flow of tides."

    2.  The poem is set "At the grave edge of the world," suggesting a mood of
        seriousness and introspection. The repetitive act of "measuring" also functions as
        a metaphor for deep thought or contemplationâ€”turning over an idea or feeling
        in one's mind. The speaker's statement "I am agate, opaline" suggests a
        complex inner self, which aligns with this theme of self-examination. This
        covers the second reason: "to evoke ideas of introspective contemplation."

    3.  Comparing this two-part analysis with the answer choices, option A aligns perfectly.
        - A: To show the flow of tides and evoke ideas of introspective contemplation. (Correct)
        - B: "sound of the sea" is secondary to the visual and conceptual idea of tides.
        - C: "sea as a boundary" is true, but "introspective contemplation" is a richer metaphorical reading.
        - D: "erosion" is a much slower process than the rhythm suggested by "re-measures".
        - E: The connection is more to the speaker's inner state than the literal distance to the moon.
