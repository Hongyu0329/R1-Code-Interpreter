# The chemical synthesis described leads to a final product with a specific name.
# This script will print the name of the final compound, Compound 4.

# Step 1: (2-bromphenyl)methanol reacts with n-BuLi and diethyl carbonate
# to form bis(2-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl)methanone (Compound 1).
# Step 2: Compound 1 is treated with dichlorodimethylsilane to form a
# cyclic silyl ether (Compound 2).
# Step 3: Compound 2 undergoes reductive cyclization with Li/naphthalene
# to yield 1,8-bis(hydroxymethyl)-9,10-dihydroanthracen-9-ol (Compound 3).
# Step 4: Compound 3 is oxidized with Jones reagent.
# The primary alcohols are oxidized to carboxylic acids, and the
# dihydroanthracen-9-ol moiety is oxidized to an anthraquinone core.
