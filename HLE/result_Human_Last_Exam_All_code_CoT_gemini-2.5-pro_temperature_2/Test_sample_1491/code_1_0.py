# I. Goal-driven locomotion is essential for the visual cliff task, where the subject must decide whether to crawl toward a goal. It is not used in the swinging room, where the subject stands still.
capability_I = "cliff"

# II. A functional analogue of MST, which processes optic flow, is the core perceptual mechanism needed for the swinging room illusion. The visual cliff relies more on static depth cues like disparity and texture gradient.
capability_II = "room"

# III. Evaluating the relative size of visual elements (a monocular depth cue) is a key way to perceive the depth of the cliff from the texture of the checkerboard pattern. This is not the primary mechanism in the motion-based swinging room.
capability_III = "cliff"

# IV. Resolving binocular disparity is a powerful stereoscopic cue for perceiving depth, making it central to the visual cliff. The swinging room effect does not depend on stereoscopic vision.
capability_IV = "cliff"

# V. A mechanism to control posture is fundamental to the swinging room experiment, as the entire result is the measurement of involuntary postural sway. In the visual cliff, the focus is on the decision to move, not reflexive balance control.
capability_V = "room"
