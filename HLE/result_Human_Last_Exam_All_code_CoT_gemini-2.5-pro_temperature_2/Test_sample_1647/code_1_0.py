    # --- Step 1: Calculate the Schwarzschild Radius (Rs) ---
    # The formula derived from combining Kepler's Law and the Rs formula is:
    # Rs = (8 * pi^2 * a^3) / (c^2 * T^2)
    # This avoids needing the gravitational constant G and the black hole's mass directly.
    
    numerator_rs = 8 * (math.pi**2) * (a**3)
    denominator_rs = (c_ms**2) * (T**2)
    Rs = numerator_rs / denominator_rs

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the time dilation factor (f) ---
    # We use the binomial approximation suitable for the Bagua architecture:
    # f â‰ˆ 1 + (Rs / (2 * r)), where r = Rs + d.
    
    r = Rs + d
    f = 1 + (Rs / (2 * r))
    
    # --- Step 3: Determine the memory usage (z) ---
    # The most memory-efficient Bagua program would use a single `frac` variable (8 trits),
    # first storing Rs, then overwriting it with the final value of f.
