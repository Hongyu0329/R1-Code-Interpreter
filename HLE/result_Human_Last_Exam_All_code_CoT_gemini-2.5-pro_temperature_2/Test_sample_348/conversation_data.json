    "To solve this problem, we need to find the total welfare, which is the sum of consumer and producer surplus. The total welfare can be calculated by integrating the difference between the demand curve and the supply curve from the minimum possible quantity to the equilibrium quantity.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Supply and Demand Functions:** Create Python functions for `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` and `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`.\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium:** The equilibrium point (Qe, Pe) is where the supply and demand curves intersect. We will find the equilibrium quantity `Qe` by numerically solving the equation `Demand(Q) = Supply(Q)`. The equilibrium price `Pe` can then be found by plugging `Qe` into either function.\n3.  **Determine Integration Bounds:** The upper bound for the integration is the equilibrium quantity `Qe`. The lower bound is the minimum quantity for which the supply function is defined. For `ln(Q^3 - 2)`, we must have `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`.\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** The total welfare is the definite integral `∫ [P_demand(Q) - P_supply(Q)] dQ` from `2^(1/3)` to `Qe`. We will use numerical integration to compute this value.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `scipy` library for numerical calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Step 1: Define the supply and demand functions\ndef supply_func(q):\n    \"\"\"Calculates price based on the supply function P = ln(Q^3 - 2).\"\"\"\n    # The function is defined only for Q^3 - 2 > 0\n    # We add this check to avoid math domain errors\n    if np.any(q**3 <= 2):\n        return np.nan\n    return np.log(q**3 - 2)\n\ndef demand_func(q):\n    \"\"\"Calculates price based on the demand function P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q)).\"\"\"\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(q))\n\n# Step 2: Find the market equilibrium quantity (Qe)\n# We need to solve the equation: demand_func(q) - supply_func(q) = 0\ndef equilibrium_equation(q):\n    return demand_func(q) - supply_func(q)\n\n# The supply curve is defined for Q > 2^(1/3) which is ~1.26.\n# By testing values, we can find the root is between 2 and 6.\n# We use a numerical solver to find the root Qe.\nsolution = root_scalar(equilibrium_equation, bracket=[2, 6])\nq_equilibrium = solution.root\n\n# Calculate the equilibrium price (Pe)\np_equilibrium = demand_func(q_equilibrium)\n\nprint(\"--- Market Equilibrium ---\")\nprint(f\"Equilibrium Quantity (Qe): {q_equilibrium:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Equilibrium Price (Pe): {p_equilibrium:.4f}\\n\")\n\n# Step 3 & 4: Calculate Total Welfare\n# Total Welfare = ∫ [demand_func(q) - supply_func(q)] dq\n# The lower bound for integration is where the supply curve starts.\nlower_bound = np.cbrt(2)\n# The upper bound is the equilibrium quantity.\nupper_bound = q_equilibrium\n\n# We use scipy.integrate.quad for numerical integration.\n# The function to integrate is the same as the equilibrium_equation.\ntotal_welfare, integration_error = quad(equilibrium_equation, lower_bound, upper_bound)\n\nprint(\"--- Total Welfare Calculation ---\")\nprint(\"Total Welfare is the integral of (Demand(Q) - Supply(Q)) dQ.\")\nprint(\"The final equation for total welfare is:\")\nprint(f\"∫ from Q_min={lower_bound:.4f} to Qe={upper_bound:.4f} of [18*e^(-arctan(Q)) - ln(Q^3 - 2)] dQ\")\nprint(f\"\\nCalculated Total Welfare: {total_welfare:.4f}\")\n\n<<<10.8931>>>"
