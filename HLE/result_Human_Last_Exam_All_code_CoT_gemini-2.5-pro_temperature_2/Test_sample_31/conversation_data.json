    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers (the \"side stickers\") one must observe to uniquely identify which of the 21 PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) cases is present.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The goal is to distinguish among 21 different permutations of the 4 top-layer corners and 4 top-layer edges. The top faces of these pieces are all correctly oriented (e.g., all yellow), so we can only use the side stickers for identification. There are a total of 12 side stickers (2 on each of the 4 corners, 1 on each of the 4 edges).\n\n2.  **Establish a Lower Bound:** We can first determine the absolute minimum number of stickers required from an information theory perspective. Since there are 21 possible states, we need enough information to distinguish them. Each side sticker can be one of 4 colors (Front, Right, Back, Left), so it provides `log2(4) = 2` bits of information. The total information needed is `log2(21) â‰ˆ 4.39` bits. Therefore, the theoretical minimum is `ceil(4.39 / 2) = 3` stickers.\n\n3.  **Test the Lower Bound:** We'll check if 3 stickers are practically sufficient. We will test a sample set of 3 stickers and see if they can create a unique \"signature\" for every PLL case. If we find even one pair of PLLs that produce the same signature for our 3-sticker set, then 3 is not enough. For instance, let's consider the set of stickers on the front face of the front-row pieces: `{UF(f), ULF(f), URF(f)}`. This set fails to distinguish the **H-perm** from the **Ub-perm**. Thus, 3 stickers are insufficient.\n\n4.  **Test the Next Level (4 Stickers):** Since 3 is not enough, the minimum must be at least 4. We need to find if there exists a set of 4 stickers that can distinguish all 21 cases. The key is to select a set that observes a mix of edge and corner pieces on more than one face. A good candidate set is `{UF(f), UR(r), URF(f), URF(r)}`, which observes:\n    *   The front sticker of the front-face edge piece.\n    *   The right sticker of the right-face edge piece.\n    *   Both side stickers of the front-right corner piece.\n    This combination provides information about the placement of two different edges and the precise placement and orientation of a corner.\n\n5.  **Verify the 4-Sticker Set:** We will demonstrate that this set of 4 stickers can resolve ambiguities that other sets couldn't, such as distinguishing the **Y-perm** from the **Ub-perm**, which a different set of 4 stickers `{UF(f), ULF(f), URF(f), UR(r)}` failed to do.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since 3 stickers are proven insufficient and a specific set of 4 stickers appears to be sufficient, we can conclude that the minimum number required is 4. The following Python code will walk through this logic and print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_pll_sticker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers required\n    to uniquely identify a PLL case.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_pll_cases = 21\n    num_sticker_colors = 4\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the theoretical minimum using information theory.\n    # This gives us a starting point for our search.\n    bits_needed = math.log2(num_pll_cases)\n    bits_per_sticker = math.log2(num_sticker_colors)\n    theoretical_min = math.ceil(bits_needed / bits_per_sticker)\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: Determine the theoretical minimum number of stickers.\")\n    print(f\"There are {num_pll_cases} PLL cases to distinguish.\")\n    print(f\"Each side sticker can be one of {num_sticker_colors} colors.\")\n    print(f\"Information needed: log2({num_pll_cases}) = {bits_needed:.2f} bits.\")\n    print(f\"Information per sticker: log2({num_sticker_colors}) = {bits_per_sticker:.2f} bits.\")\n    print(f\"Theoretical minimum stickers: ceil({bits_needed:.2f} / {bits_per_sticker:.2f}) = {theoretical_min}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Test if the theoretical minimum is practically sufficient.\n    # We can prove it's not by finding a counterexample (an ambiguity).\n    insufficient_sticker_count = 3\n    print(f\"Step 2: Test if {insufficient_sticker_count} stickers are sufficient.\")\n    print(\"Let's consider a set of 3 stickers, for example, the 3 stickers on the front face:\")\n    print(\"{UF(front), ULF(front), URF(front)}\")\n    print(\"This set of 3 stickers fails to distinguish some cases.
