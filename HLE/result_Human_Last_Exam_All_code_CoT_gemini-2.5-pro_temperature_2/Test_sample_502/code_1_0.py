    # The group G acts on a 10-dimensional complex vector space, C^10.
    # The ring R is the ring of polynomials in 10 variables, C[x_1, ..., x_10].
    # The ideal I is generated by the homogeneous G-invariant polynomials of positive degree.
    # The quotient R/I is the coinvariant algebra.

    # According to a fundamental theorem of invariant theory, the dimension of the coinvariant
    # algebra is equal to the order of the group that acts effectively on the vector space.
    # Let the action of G be given by a representation rho: G -> GL_10(C).
    # The effective group is the image, rho(G). Its order is |rho(G)| = |G| / |ker(rho)|.
    # Thus, dim(R/I) = |G| / |ker(rho)|.

    # We are asked for the largest possible dimension of R/I. To maximize this, we need
    # to choose a group G (of order 10000) and a representation rho such that the size of
    # the kernel, |ker(rho)|, is minimized.
    # The minimum possible size of the kernel is 1 (the trivial group).
    # This corresponds to a faithful representation, where rho is injective.
    
    # If a faithful representation exists, the maximum dimension will be:
    # max_dim = |G| / 1 = |G|
    max_dim = order_G

    # We must confirm that such a group and representation exist.
    # The cyclic group G = C_10000 has order 10000. It has a faithful 10-dimensional
    # representation (e.g., mapping a generator to a diagonal matrix with a primitive
    # 10000-th root of unity). This group also satisfies the condition of being
    # embeddable in GL_100(C).
    
    # Therefore, the maximum possible dimension is attainable and is equal to the order of G.
