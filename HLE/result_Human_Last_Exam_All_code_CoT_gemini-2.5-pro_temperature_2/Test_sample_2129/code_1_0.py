# Step 1: Determine parameters a and lambda from the analysis.
# Based on the analysis of the roots of y_2'(x), we found that there is
# exactly one extremum for y_2(x) for both n=10000 and n=-2000.
a = 1  # Number of extrema for n = 10000
lam = 1  # Number of extrema for n = -2000, referred to as lambda in the problem.

# Step 2: Determine the value of y_3 at x_0.
# The equation for y_3 is (d^(1/2)y_3)/(dx^(1/2)) + ((a-lam)/(lam**a)) * y_2s'(x) = 0
# With a=1 and lam=1, the coefficient (a-lam)/(lam**a) becomes (1-1)/(1**1) = 0.
# The equation simplifies to (d^(1/2)y_3)/(dx^(1/2)) = 0.
# Given the initial condition y_3(0) = 0, the solution is y_3(x) = 0 for all x.
x0 = (math.pi / lam)**lam
y3_at_x0 = 0

# Step 3: Determine N.
# N is the number of integers n for which y_1(x) and y_2(x) intersect at most once.
# The final result does not depend on the value of N, as it is multiplied by zero.
# We can represent it symbolically or use a placeholder, but its explicit value is not required.
# In the context of the printout, we can mention its irrelevance.
N_symbolic = "N"

# Step 4: Calculate the final expression.
# The expression is (N + lam) * (y3_at_x0)**(lam / a)
exponent = lam / a
final_result = 0 # Since y3_at_x0 is 0 and the exponent is positive (1.0).

# Step 5: Print the final answer and the components of the equation as requested.
