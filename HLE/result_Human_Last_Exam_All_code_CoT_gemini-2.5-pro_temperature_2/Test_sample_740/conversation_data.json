    "Of course, I can help you with this task. Here's a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Equation:** The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, is a separable (or degenerate) kernel. It can be expanded as a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and `y`:\n    `K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n\n2.  **Convert to a Linear System:** By substituting the expanded kernel into the equation, the solution `u(x)` can be shown to be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. This allows us to convert the integral equation into a system of `n` linear algebraic equations for `n` unknown coefficients. The system takes the form `(I - λA)c = b`, where `I` is the identity matrix, `A` is an `n x n` matrix, and `b` is a vector.\n\n3.  **Find the Condition for No Solution:** According to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system has no unique solution if the determinant of the matrix `(I - λA)` is zero. This happens when `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. If `det(I - λA) = 0`, the equation will have either no solution or infinitely many solutions. For the cases `n=1` and `n=2`, it can be explicitly shown that no solution exists. We will assume this holds for the general case.\n\n4.  **Determine the Matrix A:** Through derivation, the elements of the `n x n` matrix `A` are found to be `A_{ij} = 1 / (i - j + n)`, where `i` and `j` are the 0-indexed row and column numbers, respectively.\n\n5.  **Solve Computationally:** Finding the eigenvalues of `A` analytically is difficult for a general `n`. Therefore, a numerical approach using Python is suitable. The following code will construct the matrix `A` for a given `n`, find its eigenvalues `μ`, and then calculate the values of `λ = 1/μ`.\n\n6.  **Example Case:** Since the value of `n` is not specified, the code below is set up for the non-trivial case `n=2`. You can easily change the value of `n` in the code to solve for other cases. For `n=2`, the characteristic equation for `λ` is `λ² + 12λ - 12 = 0`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_for_lambda():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the given integral equation has no solution,\n    for a specific integer n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem is given for a general integer n.\n    # We will solve for the non-trivial case n=2 as an example.\n    # The user can modify this value to solve for other integers.\n    n = 2\n\n    # The problem reduces to finding lambda such that det(I - lambda*A) = 0,\n    # where A is an n x n matrix with elements A[i,j] = 1 / (i - j + n).\n    # This is equivalent to finding the eigenvalues mu of A, where lambda = 1/mu.\n    # We assume that for these lambda, the system is inconsistent, leading to no solutions.\n    \n    # Construct the matrix A\n    A = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            A[i, j] = 1.0 / (i - j + n)\n\n    try:\n        # Find the eigenvalues of A\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A)\n        \n        # Lambda is the reciprocal of the eigenvalues\n        lambda_values = 1.0 / eigenvalues\n\n        print(f\"For n = {n}, the values of λ for which the equation likely has no solution are:\")\n        for val in lambda_values:\n            print(val)\n        \n        # The prompt requires outputting the numbers in the final equation.\n        # For n=2, the characteristic equation is λ^2 + 12λ - 12 = 0.\n        if n == 2:\n            a = 1\n            b = 12\n            c = -12\n            print(\"\\nThese values are the roots of the characteristic equation:\")\n            print(f\"{a}λ^2 + {b}λ + {c} = 0\")\n\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        print(\"Could not compute the eigenvalues for the generated matrix.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_for_lambda()\n```\n<<<\n-6.0\n-12.928203230275509\n0.9282032302755094\n>>>"
