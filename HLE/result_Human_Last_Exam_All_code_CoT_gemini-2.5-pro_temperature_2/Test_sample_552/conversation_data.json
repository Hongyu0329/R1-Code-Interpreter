    "My plan is to first identify the scientist whose lectures and related work Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion. I will research the citations and influences for this specific paper, \"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\". Then, I will write a Python script that stores the name of this scientist in a variable and prints a clear, complete sentence to answer the question.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_scientist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the scientist\n    whose lectures and work were cited by Albert Einstein in his 1905\n    paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion was heavily influenced\n    # by the foundational principles of statistical mechanics.\n    # A key figure whose work, including his \"Lectures on Gas Theory\"\n    # (*Vorlesungen Ã¼ber Gastheorie*), was cited is Ludwig Boltzmann.\n    scientist_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\n    print(f\"In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the lectures and theoretical work of {scientist_name}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nfind_cited_scientist()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
