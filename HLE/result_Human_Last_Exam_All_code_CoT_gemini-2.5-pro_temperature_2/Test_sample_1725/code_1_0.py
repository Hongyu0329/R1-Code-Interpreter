# Here is the python code to solve the problem based on the reasoning above.

# Part A: What is the dimension of pi's fibers?
# The theory must be consistent with detecting dislocations, while the energy functional E
# is defined on the stalks (fibers) of the bundle pi. This implies that the variable on
# the fiber is the dislocation density tensor, alpha_ij.
# This tensor is a general second-rank tensor in 3 dimensions.
dim1 = 3
dim2 = 3
fiber_dimension = dim1 * dim2

# Part B: How many coefficients specify E?
# The energy E is a quadratic function of the dislocation density tensor alpha_ij.
# The number of coefficients is the number of independent quadratic invariants of alpha_ij
# under the crystal's symmetry group.
# The problem describes a cubic crystal with a special property along the z-axis, which
# reduces the symmetry from cubic to tetragonal (we assume the D4h point group).
# We can find the number of invariants by considering the symmetric and anti-symmetric
# parts of the tensor alpha_ij separately.

# For the symmetric part, the number of invariants equals the number of independent
# elastic constants for the D4h group.
coeffs_symmetric = 6

# For the anti-symmetric part (a pseudovector), its 3D representation under the D4h group
# splits into two irreducible representations (1D and 2D). Each corresponds to one
# quadratic invariant.
coeffs_antisymmetric = 2

# The total number of coefficients is the sum.
num_coefficients = coeffs_symmetric + coeffs_antisymmetric

# Print the final answer in the requested format "9 8"
print(f"{fiber_dimension} {num_coefficients}")
