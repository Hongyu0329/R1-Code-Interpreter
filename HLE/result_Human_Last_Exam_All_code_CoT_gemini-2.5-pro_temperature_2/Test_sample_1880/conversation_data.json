    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for determining the Galois group of an irreducible quartic polynomial.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** We will first determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$). Eisenstein's criterion is a good candidate for this. If it is reducible, the problem changes, but typically for these questions, it will be irreducible.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant of the polynomial helps narrow down the possible Galois groups. If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number, the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. Otherwise, it is not. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4, A_4, D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $V_4$ (Klein four-group), and $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n3.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic:** We will construct the resolvent cubic polynomial associated with our quartic.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** We will check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The reducibility of the resolvent cubic distinguishes between the remaining possible Galois groups.\n    *   If the discriminant is not a square and the resolvent is irreducible, the group is $S_4$ (order 24).\n    *   If the discriminant is not a square and the resolvent is reducible, the group is $D_4$ (order 8).\n    *   If the discriminant is a square and the resolvent is irreducible, the group is $A_4$ (order 12).\n    *   If the discriminant is a square and the resolvent is reducible (splits completely), the group is $V_4$ (order 4).\n5.  **Determine the Group and its Order:** Based on the results of the previous steps, we will identify the Galois group and state its order.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the reasoning at each step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to get all integer divisors of a number.\"\"\"\n    n = abs(n)\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(-i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n            divs.add(-(n // i))\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Polynomial f(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14\n    # Standard form: ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e\n    # Our poly form: x^4 + c_x*x + d_x\n    c_x = 8\n    d_x = 14\n\n    print(\"The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility using Eisenstein's criterion.\n    print(\"Step 1: Check for irreducibility over Q.\")\n    p = 2\n    print(f\"We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p = {p}.\")\n    print(f\"1. p={p} divides the coefficients 14, 8, 0, 0.\")\n    print(f\"2. p={p} does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\")\n    print(f\"3. p^2=4 does not divide the constant term 14.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The polynomial is irreducible over Q.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the discriminant.\n    # For a polynomial x^4 + cx + d, the discriminant is 256*d^3 - 27*c^4.\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the discriminant (Delta).\")\n    delta = 256 * (d_x**3) - 27 * (c_x**4)\n    print(f\"The formula for the discriminant of x^4 + {c_x}x + {d_x} is Delta = 256*({d_x}^3) - 27*({c_x}^4).\")\n    print(f\"Delta = 256 * ({d_x**3}) - 27 * ({c_x**4})\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {256 * d_x**3} - {27 * c_x**4}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {delta}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Check if Delta is a perfect square.\n    print(\"Step 3: Check if Delta is a perfect square in Q.\")\n    sqrt_delta = math.isqrt(delta)\n    is_square = (sqrt_delta * sqrt_delta == delta)\n    print(f\"The square root of {delta} is approximately {math.sqrt(delta):.2f}.\")\n    if is_square:\n        print(f\"Delta = {delta} is a perfect square.\")\n        print(\"Conclusion: The Galois group is a subgroup of A4.
