    Solves the mathematical problem about the Haar measure on SL_2(R).

    The problem is to find the largest constant K such that for any compact
    subset X of G = SL_2(R) with Haar measure mu, the inequality
    mu(X^3) >= K * mu(X) always holds.
    """

    # Step 1: Explain the reasoning to find a lower bound for K.
    # We want to show that K >= 1. This means showing mu(X^3) >= mu(X) for any X.
    # The proof relies on the right-invariance and monotonicity of the Haar measure.
    # Let X be a non-empty compact subset of G. Let mu be a right Haar measure.
    # Since X is non-empty, we can pick an element x_0 from X.
    # Consider the set X^2 = {ab | a, b in X}.
    # The set Xx_0 = {ax_0 | a in X} is a subset of X^2 because x_0 is in X.
    # By right-invariance of mu, mu(Xx_0) = mu(X).
    # By monotonicity of mu (since Xx_0 is a subset of X^2), mu(X^2) >= mu(Xx_0).
    # Therefore, mu(X^2) >= mu(X).
    # Similarly, consider X^3 = X^2 * X. Let x_1 be an element from X.
    # The set X^2 * x_1 is a subset of X^3.
    # By right-invariance, mu(X^2 * x_1) = mu(X^2).
    # By monotonicity, mu(X^3) >= mu(X^2 * x_1).
    # Thus, mu(X^3) >= mu(X^2).
    # Combining the two inequalities, we get mu(X^3) >= mu(X).
    # This implies that the ratio mu(X^3) / mu(X) is always at least 1.
    # The greatest lower bound K must therefore be at least 1.

    # Step 2: Explain the reasoning to find an upper bound for K.
    # We need to find an example set X for which the ratio mu(X^3)/mu(X) is small.
    # This provides an upper bound on K = inf(mu(X^3)/mu(X)).
    # Consider the special orthogonal group SO(2), which is the group of rotation matrices:
    # R(theta) = [[cos(theta), -sin(theta)], [sin(theta), cos(theta)]].
    # SO(2) is a subgroup of SL_2(R) because det(R(theta)) = 1.
    # SO(2) is a compact set (it's homeomorphic to a circle).
    # Let's choose our compact set X to be H = SO(2).
    # Since H is a group, the product set X^3 = H*H*H = H = X.
    # For this choice of X, mu(X^3) = mu(X).
    # The ratio is mu(X^3) / mu(X) = mu(X) / mu(X) = 1.
    # Since K must be less than or equal to the ratio for any set, K <= 1.

    # Step 3: Conclude the value of K.
    # From Step 1, we have K >= 1.
    # From Step 2, we have K <= 1.
    # Combining these, the only possible value for K is 1.
