    "Here is a plan to answer the user's question using a Python script.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Physics Principle:** The phenomenon in question, Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC), is a nonlinear optical process. For a material to exhibit it, its crystal structure must be non-centrosymmetric (i.e., it must lack a center of inversion symmetry). This property allows for a non-zero second-order electric susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is required for SPDC.\n2.  **Investigate Boron Nanosheets:** I will research the properties of different synthesized or predicted structures (polymorphs) of boron nanosheets, also known as borophene. The key property to check for each polymorph is whether its crystal lattice is centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric.\n3.  **Construct a Python Script:** I will write a Python script that codifies this investigation.\n    *   The script will store data on different borophene polymorphs in a suitable data structure (e.g., a list of dictionaries). This data will include the polymorph's name and its symmetry property (centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric).\n    *   The script will iterate through the data, evaluating each structure's potential for SPDC based on its symmetry.\n    *   It will print the analysis for the user, concluding whether SPDC is expected in boron nanosheets.\n4.  **Fulfill the Equation Requirement:** As requested, the script will conclude by presenting a final equation with numbers. The law of energy conservation in SPDC (`E_pump = E_signal + E_idler`) is a perfect candidate. I will use a practical example, such as a blue pump photon converting into two red photons, and calculate the corresponding energy values in electron volts (eV) to display in the equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef check_spdc_potential():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the potential for boron nanosheets to exhibit Spontaneous\n    Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) by examining their crystal symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the physical requirement for SPDC.\")\n    print(\"For a material to exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC),\")\n    print(\"it must have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which allows for\")\n    print(\"a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\\n\")\n\n    # Data on different polymorphs of borophene (boron nanosheets)\n    # This data is based on theoretical and computational studies in materials science.\n    borophene_phases = [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"β12-sheet Borophene\",\n            \"is_centrosymmetric\": True,\n            \"comment\": \"Possesses a center of inversion symmetry.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"χ3-sheet Borophene\",\n            \"is_centrosymmetric\": True,\n            \"comment\": \"Possesses a center of inversion symmetry.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Puckered/Anisotropic Borophene\",\n            \"is_centrosymmetric\": False,\n            \"comment\": \"Lacks a center of inversion symmetry.
