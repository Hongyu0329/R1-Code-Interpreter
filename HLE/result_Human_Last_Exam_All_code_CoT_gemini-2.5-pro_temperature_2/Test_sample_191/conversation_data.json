    "The user is asking a biological question about the protein that facilitates the engulfment of amyloid by macrophages. I will identify this protein and its mechanism of action. The core of the answer lies in the complement system, a part of the immune system that enhances the ability of phagocytic cells to clear cellular debris and pathogens.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the specific protein in the complement cascade that is responsible for tagging amyloid for removal.\n2.  Explain the process: This protein gets cleaved or \"broken down.\"\n3.  The resulting fragment then coats the amyloid. This process is called opsonization.\n4.  Macrophages (specifically microglia in the brain) have receptors that recognize this fragment, leading to the engulfment (phagocytosis) of the amyloid.\n5.  Based on this biological pathway, I will provide the name of the protein.\n6.  Finally, I will create a Python script that prints this information, as requested by the prompt format.\n\nThe protein in question is **Complement component 3 (C3)**. When activated, it is broken down into C3a and C3b. The C3b fragment is the key component that binds to the surface of amyloid plaques, marking them for destruction and engulfment by macrophages that have C3b receptors.\n\n```python\ndef find_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the role of the key protein\n    whose breakdown allows macrophages to engulf amyloid deposits.\n    \"\"\"\n    protein_name = \"Complement component 3\"\n    protein_abbreviation = \"C3\"\n    number_in_name = 3\n\n    print(f\"The protein whose breakdown allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is {protein_name} ({protein_abbreviation}).\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the breakdown of the process:\")\n    print(\"1.

This binding event triggers the macrophage to engulf and clear the amyloid plaque.\")\n\nfind_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment()\n```\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
