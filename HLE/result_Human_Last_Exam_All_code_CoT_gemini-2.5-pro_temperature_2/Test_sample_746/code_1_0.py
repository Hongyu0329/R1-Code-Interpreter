    Solves the topological problem regarding the maximum number of dispersion points.

    Problem: For a compact connected metric space X, what is the maximum
    cardinality of the set of dispersion points?

    A dispersion point x is a point such that X \ {x} is totally disconnected.
    """

    # Step 1: Analyze the properties of the space.
    # The space is a "compact connected metric space".
    # A key property of any metric space is that it is also a Hausdorff space.
    # A Hausdorff space is one where any two distinct points have disjoint open neighborhoods.
    # So, we are looking for the maximum number of dispersion points in a
    # compact, connected, Hausdorff space.

    # Step 2: Apply the relevant theorem from topology.
    # Theorem: A connected Hausdorff space can have at most one dispersion point.
    #
    # Proof Sketch (by contradiction):
    # 1. Assume there are two dispersion points, p and q.
    # 2. Since the space is Hausdorff, there are disjoint open sets U containing p and V containing q.
    # 3. Consider the space Y = X \ {p}. It is totally disconnected.
    # 4. In Y, the point q has a neighborhood A âŠ‚ V which is both open and closed (clopen).
    # 5. In the original space X, the boundary of A must be exactly {p} (due to X being connected).
    # 6. This implies p is in the closure of A, and thus in the closure of V.
    # 7. This contradicts that U and V are disjoint.
    # 8. Therefore, the assumption of two dispersion points is false.
    max_cardinality_by_theorem = 1

    # Step 3: Verify that this maximum is achievable.
    # The existence of a compact connected metric space with exactly one dispersion point
    # has been proven. The "Knaster continuum" is a famous example.
    # This means the maximum value of 1 is not just an upper bound, but is attainable.

    # Step 4: Final conclusion and output.

    # The final equation is simply that the maximum cardinality equals 1.
