# Step 1: Define the chromatic number of the Asian graph before the Soviet dissolution.
# A country map graph is planar. By the Four-Color Theorem, its chromatic number is at most 4.
# Due to the complexity of the Asian continent's map, it's assumed to require 4 colors.
chromatic_number_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian map graph before 1991 is taken to be {chromatic_number_before}.")

# Step 2: Define the chromatic number after the dissolution.
# The dissolution increased the graph's complexity, adding new states and borders in Central Asia.
# The graph remains planar, and the increased complexity makes it unlikely to require fewer colors.
# Therefore, the chromatic number is assumed to remain 4.
chromatic_number_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian map graph after 1991 is taken to be {chromatic_number_after}.")

# Step 3: Calculate the incremental change, delta_soviet.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The incremental change in chromatic number, delta_soviet, is {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 4: Determine the planarity change factor, beta.
# The graph of country borders is planar by definition. This property was unchanged by the political dissolution.
# The problem states beta=1 if planarity did not change, and beta=2 if it did.
beta = 1
print(f"The graph remained planar, so the planarity change factor, beta, is {beta}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final answer.
# The final result is the product of beta and delta_soviet.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final result is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
