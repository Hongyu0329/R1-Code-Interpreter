    "To find the thickness of the double point, we can follow a procedure based on analyzing the discriminant of the polynomial defining the curve. The thickness of a singularity is related to the valuation of the discriminant of a minimal model of the curve. For many hyperelliptic curves, this valuation can be directly computed from the discriminant of the polynomial on the right-hand side.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Define the polynomial `f(x) = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1` from the curve equation.\n2.  Compute the discriminant of this polynomial, let's call it `D`. The discriminant tells us about where the roots of the polynomial collide, which corresponds to the location of branch points of the cover `C -> P^1`, and is intimately related to the singularities of the curve models.\n3.  The valuation `v_2` of this discriminant, which is the exponent of the highest power of 2 that divides `D`, provides the information we need. For a genus 2 curve of this form, when the stable reduction consists of a single genus 1 component with one node, the thickness `delta` of that node is equal to the valuation of the minimal discriminant. Under favorable conditions (which hold here), the valuation of the minimal discriminant is simply the valuation of the discriminant of `f(x)`.\n4.  We will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform the calculation and then find the power of 2 dividing the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve\n    z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1 above 2.\n\n    The thickness can be determined from the 2-adic valuation of the discriminant\n    of the polynomial f(x) = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    f = 2 * x**5 + 2 * x**3 + 1\n\n    print(f\"The curve is defined by z^2 = f(x), where f(x) = {f}\")\n\n    # Step 1: Compute the discriminant of the polynomial f(x).\n    D = sympy.discriminant(f)\n    print(f\"Step 1: The discriminant of f(x) is D = {D}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Compute the 2-adic valuation of the discriminant D.\n    # This is the largest integer 'v' such that 2^v divides D.\n    if D == 0:\n        # This would mean f(x) has repeated roots over Q.\n        print(\"The discriminant is 0, which implies repeated roots.\")\n        thickness = float('inf')\n    else:\n        thickness = 0\n        temp_D = abs(D)\n        while temp_D > 0 and temp_D % 2 == 0:\n            thickness += 1\n            temp_D //= 2\n            # Showing the process of finding the power of 2\n            print(f\"    D is divisible by 2.
