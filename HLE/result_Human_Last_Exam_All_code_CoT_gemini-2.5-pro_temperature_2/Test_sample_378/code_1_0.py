# This script addresses the user's question about Goodluck Jonathan's name.
# The premise of the question is that he started identifying as "Azikiwe" at a certain point.
# Historical records show "Azikiwe" has always been part of his given name.

explanation = """
Based on public records, the full name of the former President of Nigeria is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.

'Azikiwe' is one of his given names from birth, not a name he adopted or chose to identify with at a later date.

Therefore, a specific year when he first publicly identified himself as 'Azikiwe' does not exist, as it has been part of his official name throughout his life.
