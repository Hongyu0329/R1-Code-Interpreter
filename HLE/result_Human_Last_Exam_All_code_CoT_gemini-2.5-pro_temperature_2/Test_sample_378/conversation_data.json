    "Based on my research, the user's question is based on a false premise. Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. \"Azikiwe\" is his given middle name from birth, not a name he adopted or started using at a specific point in time. Therefore, there is no year he \"publicly identified himself as Azikiwe\" because it has always been part of his name.\n\nI will provide a Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\n# This script addresses the user's question about Goodluck Jonathan's name.\n# The premise of the question is that he started identifying as \"Azikiwe\" at a certain point.\n# Historical records show \"Azikiwe\" has always been part of his given name.\n\nexplanation = \"\"\"\nBased on public records, the full name of the former President of Nigeria is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n\n'Azikiwe' is one of his given names from birth, not a name he adopted or chose to identify with at a later date.\n\nTherefore, a specific year when he first publicly identified himself as 'Azikiwe' does not exist, as it has been part of his official name throughout his life.\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(explanation)\n```\n<<<There is no specific year for this event, as \"Azikiwe\" is part of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's given birth name.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
