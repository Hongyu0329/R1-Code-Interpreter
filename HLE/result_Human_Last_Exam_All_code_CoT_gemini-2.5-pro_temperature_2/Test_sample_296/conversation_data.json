    "Answering this question requires delving into the structure of the Grigorchuk group, a fascinating object in modern algebra. The number of subgroups of a given index in a group G is related to the number of ways G can act on a set of that size.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  A subgroup of index 4 corresponds to a transitive action of the Grigorchuk group G on a set of 4 elements. Such an action is defined by a homomorphism from G into the symmetric group $S_4$, where the image is a transitive subgroup.\n2.  The Grigorchuk group G is a 2-group, which means the order of every element is a power of 2. Consequently, the image of any homomorphism from G must also be a 2-group.\n3.  The transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are the cyclic group $C_4$, the Klein four-group $V_4$, the dihedral group $D_8$, the alternating group $A_4$, and the symmetric group $S_4$. We only need to consider the 2-groups, which are $C_4$, $V_4$, and $D_8$.\n4.  The group $G$ cannot have a $C_4$ quotient. This is because the abelianization of G is known to be $(C_2)^3 = C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, which has no elements of order 4. So, the image of our action can only be $V_4$ or $D_8$.\n5.  **Case 1: The image is $V_4$.** These actions correspond to normal subgroups of index 4. The number of these is the number of distinct epimorphisms from G to $V_4$. We can calculate this using the abelianization of G.\n6.  **Case 2: The image is $D_8$.** These actions correspond to non-normal subgroups of index 4. Calculating the number of homomorphisms from G to $D_8$ is complex and relies on known, advanced results about the group's structure.\n7.  Finally, we use the formula that the total number of subgroups of index $n$ is the total number of transitive homomorphisms to $S_n$ divided by $(n-1)!$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the number of subgroups of index 4.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_subgroup_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing actions with V4 as the image (Normal Subgroups).\")\n    \n    # The number of homomorphisms from (C2)^3 to (C2)^2 (which is isomorphic to V4).\n    # This is equivalent to maps from a 3D vector space over F_2 to a 2D space.\n    # Total number of linear maps is |F_2^2|^(dim F_2^3) = 4^3\n    total_homomorphisms_c2_3_to_c2_2 = 4**3\n\n    # Number of non-surjective homomorphisms.\n    # Image is trivial (1 map).\n    non_surjective_trivial = 1\n    # Image is C2 (order 2).
