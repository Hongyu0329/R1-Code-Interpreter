    "Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a measure of the variation in time between consecutive heartbeats. This is a non-coding knowledge question, so a textual explanation is most appropriate.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Query:** The user wants to know the name of the \"value between heartbeats\" that is used to compute HRV. The measurement technology mentioned is PPG (Photoplethysmography).\n2.  **Define HRV:** HRV is not the heart rate itself, but the analysis of the consistency (or lack thereof) of the time intervals between each heartbeat.\n3.  **Identify the Core Measurement:** The fundamental data point captured for HRV analysis is the duration of the time interval from one heartbeat to the next.\n4.  **Determine the Technical Term:** In electrocardiography (ECG), the most prominent peak of a heartbeat is the \"R-wave.\" Therefore, the time interval between two consecutive heartbeats is called the **R-R interval**.\n5.  **Consider the Mention of PPG:** While PPG measures blood volume changes and doesn't have a literal R-wave like an ECG, the terminology \"R-R interval\" has become standard in the field and is commonly used interchangeably with the more general term **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**, even when discussing data from PPG sensors.\n6.  **Conclude the Answer:** The value measured between heartbeats is the time interval, which is most commonly referred to as the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval"
