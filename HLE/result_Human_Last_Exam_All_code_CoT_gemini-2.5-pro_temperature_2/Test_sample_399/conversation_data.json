    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step solution to the initial value problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the type of differential equation:** The given equation $x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$ is a separable ordinary differential equation (ODE).\n2.  **Separate the variables:** I will rearrange the equation so that all terms involving $x$ are on one side and all terms involving $t$ are on the other.\n3.  **Integrate both sides:** I will integrate both sides of the separated equation to find the general solution, which will include a constant of integration, $C$.\n4.  **Apply the initial condition:** I will use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$ to solve for the constant $C$ and find the particular solution.\n5.  **Calculate the final value:** Finally, I will substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find the value of $x(1)$.\n6.  **Code implementation:** The Python code will programmatically perform the calculations for steps 4 and 5 and print out the derivation clearly, including the final evaluation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_ivp():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the initial value problem and prints the steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The initial value problem is:\")\n    print(\"x'(t) = (t-1) * x(t)^2, with x(0) = -8.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The equation is separable.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
