def solve_set_theory_problem():
    """
    This function determines and prints the order type based on the provided set theory problem.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. Let X be the set of possible cofinalities of 2^omega. Let lambda be in X.
    2. From Konig's theorem, lambda > aleph_0.
    3. Cofinalities are always regular cardinals, so lambda is a regular cardinal >= aleph_1.
    4. The problem states 2^omega is singular, so lambda < 2^omega.
    5. The problem states 2^omega < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.
    6. Combining these, lambda is a regular cardinal such that aleph_1 <= lambda < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.
    7. Standard results in set theory (via forcing methods) show that any such regular cardinal lambda is a possible cofinality for 2^omega.
    8. So, X is the set of all regular cardinals in the interval [aleph_1, aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}).
    9. The task is to find the order type of X. The upper bound, kappa = aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}, is a regular cardinal because its index, delta = omega_{omega+5}, is a regular limit ordinal.
    10. A theorem in set theory states that for any regular cardinal kappa, the set of regular cardinals less than kappa has order type kappa (as an initial ordinal).
    11. Therefore, the order type of X is the initial ordinal for the cardinal aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}, which is omega_{omega+5}.
    12. The following code constructs and prints this result.
    """

    # The final answer is the ordinal omega_(omega+5)
    # The components of the final expression are 'omega' and the number '5'.
    
    omega_symbol = "omega"
    the_number_in_the_equation = 5

    # Construct the string representation for the answer
    subscript_part = f"{omega_symbol}+{the_number_in_the_equation}"
    final_answer = f"{omega_symbol}_({subscript_part})"

    print(f"The order type of X is: {final_answer}")
