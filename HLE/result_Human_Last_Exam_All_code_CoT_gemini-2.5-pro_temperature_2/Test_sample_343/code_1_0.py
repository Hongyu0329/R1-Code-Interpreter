    This function demonstrates the core of the polynomial interpolation argument.
    It calculates the coefficient 'A_k' of the term C(m,k) in a polynomial 
    p(m) = A_k * C(m,k) + A_{k-1} * C(m, k-1) + ... + A_0,
    given the values of the polynomial at m = 0, 1, ..., k.

    This method allows us to isolate the count of one type of combinatorial object
    (e.g., k-Independent Sets, which is a #W[1]-hard problem) from the total count
    returned by a hypothetical PCount oracle.

    The formula for the leading coefficient A_k is derived from the calculus of finite differences:
