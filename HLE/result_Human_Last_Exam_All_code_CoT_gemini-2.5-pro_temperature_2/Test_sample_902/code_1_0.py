Step 1: The Assumption
Let's assume for the sake of argument that such a program `P` actually exists.
This means we can write and execute a Python function, let's call it `def_superfast(n)`,
that correctly computes the result as described.

Step 2: The Paradoxical Program
If `def_superfast(n)` exists as a computable function, we can then write a new, very simple
Python program. Let's call this program `Q`:

Program Q:
-----------------------------
print(def_superfast(10000))
-----------------------------

Step 3: The Contradiction
Let's analyze our program `Q` based on the rules from the original problem:

  a) Length: The source code for program `Q` is `print(def_superfast(10000))`. The number
     of symbols in this source code is exactly 28. This is less than the limit of 10000 symbols.

  b) Output: Since we assumed `def_superfast(10000)` can be computed, program `Q` will run, halt,
     and print an integer.

  c) The value: The integer that `Q` prints is the return value of `def_superfast(10000)`.
     By its own definition, this value is `Huge_int + 1`.

This leads to a direct logical contradiction:
 - The definition of `Huge_int` says it is the LARGEST integer that can be returned by ANY
   halting program with a source code shorter than 10000 symbols.
 - But our program `Q` is shorter than 10000 symbols, and it returns the value `Huge_int + 1`.

This means we have found a program that returns a number greater than the supposed maximum,
which is impossible. The equation `Huge_int < Huge_int + 1` is always true, but program Q's existence would require it to be part of the set used to define Huge_int, thus Huge_int would need to be greater than or equal to its output (`Huge_int + 1`), which is false.

Step 4: Conclusion
Since our initial assumption (that program `P` exists) leads to an inescapable contradiction, the assumption must be false.

Therefore, no program P can exist that computes def_superfast(10000).
