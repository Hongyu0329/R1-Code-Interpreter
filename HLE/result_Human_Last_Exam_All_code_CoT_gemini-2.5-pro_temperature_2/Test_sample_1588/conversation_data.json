    "To find the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use Witt's formula. This formula calculates the dimension of the n-th graded part of the free Lie algebra on k generators, which corresponds to the number of independent Lie bracket structures of order n.\n\nThe formula is:\n`N(n, k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n-   `n` is the order, which is 10.\n-   `k` is the number of generators (X and Y), which is 2.\n-   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n-   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1.  Find all divisors of `n=10`.\n2.  For each divisor `d`, calculate the value of the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n3.  Calculate each term `μ(d) * k^(n/d)`.\n4.  Sum these terms and divide by `n`.\n\nThe following Python code will execute these steps and print the full calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num.\n    e.g., get_prime_factorization(12) -> {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_num = num\n    while d * d <= temp_num:\n        while temp_num % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_num //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_num > 1:\n        factors[temp_num] = factors.get(temp_num, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    - mu(n) = 1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    - mu(n) = -1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    - mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n            \n    if len(factors) % 2 == 1:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return 1\n\ndef solve_bch_order_10():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the BCH expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    k = 2\n\n    # Find divisors of n\n    divisors = [d for d in range(1, n + 1) if n % d == 0]\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # Store terms for printing\n    equation_parts = []\n    sum_parts = []\n\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        n_over_d = n // d\n        term = mu_d * (k ** n_over_d)\n        total_sum += term\n        \n        sign = \"+\" if term >= 0 else \"-\"\n        # Don't show + for the first term\n        if not equation_parts:\n            sign = \"\" if term >= 0 else \"-\"\n\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{sign} {abs(mu_d)}*({k}^({n}//{d}))\")\n        sum_parts.append(f\"{sign} {abs(term)}\")\n        \n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    print(f\"Witt's formula for n={n} and k={k} is: N = (1/{n}) * Σ_{{d|{n}}} μ(d) * k^(n/d)\")\n    print(\"\\nThe divisors of 10 are: 1, 2, 5, 10.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    \n    # Build the full equation string with values substituted\n    equation_str = f\"N = (1/{n}) * [ \" + \" \".join(equation_parts) + \" ]\"\n    equation_str = equation_str.replace('[ +', '[')\n    print(equation_str)\n\n    sum_str = f\"N = (1/{n}) * [ \" + \" \".join(sum_parts) + \" ]\"\n    sum_str = sum_str.replace('[ +', '[')\n    print(sum_str)\n    \n    print(f\"N = (1/{n}) * [ {total_sum} ]\")\n    print(f\"N = {result}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThus, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is:\")\n    print(result)\n\nsolve_bch_order_10()\n\n```\n<<<99>>>"
