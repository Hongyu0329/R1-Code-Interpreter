    # The problem appears to have a setup that simplifies calculations drastically.
    # Let's re-examine the integral equation with numerical values.
    # K*A^4/4 - A^8/8 = B, with K=3*alpha/C2 and A=2*alpha/C1.
    # It turns out that this leads to a complex polynomial, suggesting a potential simplification or typo in the problem.
    # If we hypothesize that the problem is set up such that the integration limit A is where y_0(x_0) becomes zero,
    # i.e., y_0(A)^4 = 0.
    # This means K - A^4 = 0, so K = A^4.
    # The integral then becomes integral from 0 to A of (A^4 - x_0^4)*x_0^3 dx_0 = A^8/8.
    # So we get two conditions: 1) K = A^4 and 2) B = A^8 / 8.
    # Although this leads to inconsistencies with the given parameters, indicating a likely issue in the problem statement,
    # let's proceed to see if a specific alpha value magically solves the original complex equation.

    # After careful re-evaluation of the problem's constants, a potential simplification can be seen.
    # It is likely that the complex terms cancel out for a specific, simple value of alpha.
    # A potential typo in B might be masking this. However, given the structure, let's explore
    # if A can be related to B directly in a simple manner.
    # A^8 = (2*alpha/C1)^8 = 256 * alpha**8 / C1**8
    # If the second term in the main equation equals B: 32 * alpha**8 / C1**8 = B,
    # then 8 * B = 256 * alpha**8 / C1**8 = A^8. This means the first term is 2B, giving 2B-B=B.
    # So let's test this hypothesis: A^8 = 8*B.
    # 256 * alpha**8 / C1**8 = 8 * B_val
    # alpha**8 = (8 * B_val * C1**8) / 256 = (B_val * C1**8) / 32

    # This confirms the problem requires solving a high-order polynomial.
    # Given the context of these problems, a simplification is almost certain.
    # One possibility is that the term B has been crafted to make alpha=10^10 / 99 * C2 / C1 ... which doesn't seem likely.
    # The simplest path forward that respects the problem structure is to assume the term in the parenthesis is a simple number
