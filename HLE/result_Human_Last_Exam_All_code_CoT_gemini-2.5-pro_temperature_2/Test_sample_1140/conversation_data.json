    "For a peptide of this size (100 amino acids), especially one containing an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine (AzF), standard solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) becomes very difficult due to decreasing yields with each coupling step. A more effective strategy is needed.\n\nThe most helpful technique would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**. This powerful method involves synthesizing the 100aa peptide in smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., two 50aa peptides). One fragment would be synthesized with a C-terminal thioester, and the other with an N-terminal cysteine. The fragment containing the unnatural amino acid (AzF) could be easily produced using SPPS, while the other fragment could be made either by SPPS or via recombinant expression in *E. coli* for higher yield. These two fragments are then chemically joined (ligated) together in solution to form the full-length 100aa peptide. This approach bypasses the limitations of synthesizing long peptides by a single method and allows for the precise incorporation of unnatural amino acids.\n\nAs an excellent alternative, **recombinant expression using genetic code expansion** could also be used. This involves engineering a host organism (like *E. coli*) with an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair that specifically recognizes AzF and incorporates it in response to a nonsense codon (like the amber codon UAG) engineered into the peptide's gene.\n\nHere is a Python script to perform a relevant calculation: determining the molecular weight of a representative 100-amino acid peptide containing Azido Phenylalanine (X).\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_peptide_mw():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the monoisotopic molecular weight of a peptide.\n    The plan is to:\n    1.

Create a dictionary of monoisotopic molecular weights for the residues of all standard amino acids and Azido Phenylalanine.\n    3. Iterate through the peptide sequence, summing the masses of each residue.\n    4. Add the mass of a water molecule (H2O) to account for the N- and C-termini.\n    5.
