    "The user wants to find the maximal rank of the complementary channel for a Pauli channel acting on a qudit.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel Definition:** A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit) is described by the operator-sum representation:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{j,k} U_{j,k} \\rho U_{j,k}^\\dagger $$\n    -   $\\rho$ is the qudit's density matrix.\n    -   $\\{U_{j,k} = X^j Z^k\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, which are unitary and form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n    -   $\\{p_{j,k}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{j,k} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{j,k} p_{j,k} = 1$.\n    -   The Kraus operators for this channel are $A_{j,k} = \\sqrt{p_{j,k}} U_{j,k}$.\n\n2.  **Complementary Channel's Rank:** For any quantum channel, the rank of its complementary channel is equal to the number of linearly independent operators in a minimal Kraus representation of the original channel.\n\n3.  **Applying to Pauli Channel:** The rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its Kraus operators, $\\{A_{j,k}\\}$.\n    -   The generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_{j,k}\\}$ are linearly independent.\n    -   Therefore, the Kraus operators $A_{j,k} = \\sqrt{p_{j,k}} U_{j,k}$ are linearly independent as long as their corresponding probabilities $p_{j,k}$ are greater than zero.\n    -   This means the rank of the complementary channel is exactly the number of non-zero probabilities, $p_{j,k}$, in the channel's definition.\n\n4.  **Finding the Maximal Rank:** To maximize the rank, we need to maximize the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{j,k}$.\n    -   The indices $j$ and $k$ both range from $0$ to $d-1$, giving a total of $d \\times d = d^2$ distinct operators $U_{j,k}$.\n    -   It is possible to define a valid channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero. For example, the completely depolarizing channel sets $p_{j,k} = 1/d^2$ for all $j,k$. This is a valid probability distribution.\n    -   Therefore, the maximum number of non-zero probabilities is $d^2$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel on a $d$-dimensional system is $d^2$.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by calculating the result for a user-specified dimension `d`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_maximal_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and explains the maximal rank of the complementary\n    channel for a Pauli channel on a d-dimensional system.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The dimension 'd' of the qudit system is not specified in the problem.\n    # The answer is d^2. We will use d=2 (a qubit) as a concrete example for calculation.\n    # The user of this code can change the value of 'd' to explore other systems.\n    d = 2\n\n    print(\"--- Derivation Summary ---\")\n    print(\"The rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel is equal to the number of non-zero Pauli error probabilities.\")\n    print(\"To maximize this rank, we can choose a channel where all possible Pauli errors occur with some non-zero probability.\")\n    print(f\"For a d-dimensional system, there are d*d = d^2 generalized Pauli operators.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the maximal rank is d^2.\")\n    print(\"\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Calculation for an Example System ---\")\n    print(f\"Let's consider a system with dimension d = {d}.\")\n    \n    # The maximal rank is d squared.\n    maximal_rank = d ** 2\n    \n    # The final equation and its evaluated numbers\n    print(f\"The equation for the maximal rank is: d^2\")\n    print(f\"Substituting the value of d: {d}^2 = {d} * {d}\")\n    print(f\"Result = {maximal_rank}\")\n\n    # Output the final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{maximal_rank}>>>\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_maximal_rank()\n```"
