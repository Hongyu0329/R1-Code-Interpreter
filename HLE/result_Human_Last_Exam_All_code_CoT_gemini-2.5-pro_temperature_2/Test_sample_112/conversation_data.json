    "The poem \"Sir Launfal\" by Thomas Chestre is preserved in a single important manuscript. To answer the question, I need to identify that manuscript and then find which work within it is considered a \"book of manners.\"\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the manuscript containing the Middle English poem \"Sir Launfal.\"\n2.  Examine the contents of this manuscript to find a text focused on etiquette or courtesy.\n3.  Create a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints the answer in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_accompanying_book():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the book of manners preserved alongside 'Sir Launfal'.\n    \"\"\"\n    poem = \"Sir Launfal\"\n    manuscript = \"British Library manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii\"\n    book_of_manners = \"The Boke of Curtasye\" # The Book of Courtesy\n\n    print(f\"The poem '{poem}' is preserved in the {manuscript}.\")\n    print(f\"Alongside it, a book of manners was also preserved, known as '{book_of_manners}'.\")\n\nfind_accompanying_book()\n```\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
