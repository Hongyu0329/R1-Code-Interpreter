# The number of pirates (vertices).
V = 9
# The number of gunpoint pairs (edges).
E = 16

# The problem can be modeled as finding the maximum number of cycles in a planar
# graph with V=9 vertices and E=16 edges. The wheel graph W_9 fits these
# parameters and is a strong candidate for maximizing the number of cycles.

# In a W_9 graph, there is a central hub and an outer rim with k vertices.
k = V - 1

# 1. Cycles involving the hub vertex.
# A cycle involving the hub is formed by a path on the outer rim (a C_k)
# connected back through the hub.
# For each of the k vertices on the rim, there are (k-1) possible paths
# starting from it and ending at another rim vertex (one path for each of the k-1 other vertices).
# This gives k * (k-1) cycles involving the hub.
hub_cycles = k * (k - 1)

# 2. The cycle of the outer rim itself.
rim_cycle = 1

# The maximum number of standoffs is the total number of cycles.
total_standoffs = hub_cycles + rim_cycle
