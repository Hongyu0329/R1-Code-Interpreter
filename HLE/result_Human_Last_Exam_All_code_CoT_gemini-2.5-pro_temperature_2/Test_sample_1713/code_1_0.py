    Calculates and explains the firm's profit/loss based on geometric areas.

    In a perfectly competitive market, a firm's profit is Total Revenue (TR)
    minus Total Cost (TC).
    - Total Revenue (TR) is Price * Quantity. This corresponds to area S.
    - Total Cost (TC) is Average Total Cost * Quantity. This corresponds to area H.
    - Therefore, Profit = TR - TC = S - H.

    This script demonstrates the calculation with example values.
