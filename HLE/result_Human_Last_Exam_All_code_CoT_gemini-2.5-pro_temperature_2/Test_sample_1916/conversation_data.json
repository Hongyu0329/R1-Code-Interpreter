    "To find the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object up to isomorphism, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The morphisms of the category are the elements of the monoid, composition of morphisms is the monoid operation, and the identity morphism is the monoid's identity element.\n2.  We have 3 morphisms. Let's call the corresponding monoid elements `e`, `a`, and `b`, where `e` is the identity element.\n3.  The structure of the monoid is determined by the multiplication table. The identity element `e` has a fixed behavior: `e*x = x*e = x` for all `x`.\n4.  We only need to define the four products involving the non-identity elements: `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b`. Each of these products can be `e`, `a`, or `b`. This gives `3^4 = 81` possible multiplication tables.\n5.  We will write a Python script to perform the following steps:\n    a. Represent the elements `e, a, b` as `0, 1, 2`.\n    b. Iterate through all `81` possible multiplication tables for `a` and `b`.\n    c. For each table, check if the associativity law `(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)` holds for all elements. Store the tables that represent valid (associative) monoids.\n    d. Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by relabeling the non-identity elements. In our case, this means swapping the roles of `a` and `b`. We will generate the \"isomorphic twin\" for each valid monoid table.\n    e. To count the number of unique monoids, we define a \"canonical representation\" for each isomorphism class (e.g., the lexicographically smaller of the two table representations). We then count the number of unique canonical representations.\n6. The final count will be the number of categories asked for in the question.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    This is equivalent to the number of categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]  # 0: identity 'e', 1: 'a', 2: 'b'\n    non_identity = [1, 2]\n    \n    # All possible outcomes for the 4 key products: a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b\n    product_choices = list(itertools.product(elements, repeat=4))\n\n    valid_monoids = []\n    \n    # 1.
