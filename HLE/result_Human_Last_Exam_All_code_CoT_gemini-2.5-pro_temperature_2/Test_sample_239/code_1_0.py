# This script calculates the answers to the four questions about the XVM C program.

# --- Answer to Question 1: How many lines of code have complier errors? ---
# 1. `unsigned long long ...;`: The `unsigned long long` type is not defined in XVM.
# 2. `scanf("%d %d %d", ...);`: The `%d` format specifier is for `digit` (1D), which is too small for n, m, and a. The correct specifiers would be `%n` or `%u`.
# 3. `printf("%d", ...);`: The `%d` specifier is incorrect for the large result of `na * ma`. The correct specifier would be `%n`.
# Total lines with errors: 3
answer1 = 3

# --- Answer to Question 2: Memory usage for an optimal version. ---
# To store the inputs, we need:
# - n (up to 4*10^9): needs `unsigned long` (12D).
# - m (up to 4*10^9): needs `unsigned long` (12D).
# - a (up to 10^6-1): `unsigned int` (6D, max 999,999) is sufficient.
# An optimal version wouldn't need variables for intermediate results 'na' and 'ma'.
# Total memory = 12D (for n) + 12D (for m) + 6D (for a).
answer2 = 30

# --- Answer to Question 3: Can this problem be solved without branching statements? ---
# Yes. The ceiling of a division `ceil(x/y)` can be calculated with branchless integer
# arithmetic using the formula `(x + y - 1) // y`.
answer3 = "Y"

# --- Answer to Question 4: Expected output for n=4*10^9, m=4*10^9, a=1 ---
# This requires calculating `ceil(n/a) * ceil(m/a)`.
n = 4 * 10**9
m = 4 * 10**9
a = 1
# Flagstones for the n-dimension
flagstones_n = (n + a - 1) // a
# Flagstones for the m-dimension
flagstones_m = (m + a - 1) // a
# Total flagstones
total_flagstones = flagstones_n * flagstones_m
# Formatting the answer as an equation as requested.
answer4 = f"{flagstones_n} * {flagstones_m} = {total_flagstones}"

# --- Final Combined Answer ---
# The prompt requests the answer in the format x:y:z:t.
final_output = f"{answer1}:{answer2}:{answer3}:{answer4}"
print(final_output)
