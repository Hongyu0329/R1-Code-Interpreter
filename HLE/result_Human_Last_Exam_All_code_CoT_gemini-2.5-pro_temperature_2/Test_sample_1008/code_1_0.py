# The hierarchy of sound importance in a dance scene is determined by the element's role in driving the scene.
# 1. Music: This is the most crucial element. It dictates the pace, rhythm, mood, and emotional core of the dance. The choreography is built around it.
# 2. Sound Effects: These add texture and realism. Sounds like footsteps, tapping, and the swish of fabric ground the dance in a physical space. They are mixed to support the music, not overpower it.
# 3. Speech: Dialogue is usually absent or minimal during a dance sequence. If present, it's often in the background or used as a brief narrative cue, making it the least important element so as not to break the immersion of the performance.

# Define the order of importance
sound_hierarchy = ["Music", "Sound Effects", "Speech"]

# Format the list into a string separated by a comma and a space
output_string = ", ".join(sound_hierarchy)

# Print the final ranked order
print(output_string)
