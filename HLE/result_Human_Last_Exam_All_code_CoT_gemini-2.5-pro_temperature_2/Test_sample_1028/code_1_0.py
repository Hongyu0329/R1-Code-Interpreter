def solve_phylogenetics_identifiability():
    """
    Analyzes strategies for mitigating identifiability issues in birth-death models.

    The core problem is that on a phylogeny of only extant species, different
    combinations of speciation (lambda) and extinction (mu) rates over time
    can produce the same data, making the specific rates unidentifiable.

    We evaluate the given strategies:
    A. Piecewise-constant rates: Simplifies the model but doesn't solve the core
       ambiguity within each time piece.
    B. Bayesian priors: Adds external information, which constrains the model and
       helps distinguish between parameter sets. This HELPS.
    C. High-degree polynomial rates: Drastically increases model complexity and
       flexibility without adding new data. This EXACERBATES the identifiability
       problem, making it worse. This does NOT HELP.
    D. & F. Incorporating fossils: Fossils provide direct evidence of extinct lineages,
       which is the key information missing from extant-only phylogenies. This HELPS.
    E. & G. Reparametrizing to pulled rates: This focuses the inference on combinations
       of parameters that are mathematically proven to be identifiable from the data,
       thus circumventing the problem. This HELPS.

    Therefore, fitting a highly flexible polynomial model is the strategy that
    does not help mitigate the issue.
