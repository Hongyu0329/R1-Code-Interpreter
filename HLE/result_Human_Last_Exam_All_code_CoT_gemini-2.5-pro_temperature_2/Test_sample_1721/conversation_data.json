    "The problem asks for the largest number `c` such that there's a subset `A` of `{1, ..., N}` with size `|A| = (c + o(1))N`, where `A+A` (the set of sums of pairs of elements from `A`) contains no perfect squares.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Understanding the problem:** We need to find a subset `A` of the first `N` integers that is as large as possible, with the constraint that for any two elements `a_1, a_2 \\in A` (they can be the same), their sum `a_1 + a_2` is not a perfect square. The size of this set is given as a fraction `c` of `N` for large `N`.\n\n2.  **Using Modular Arithmetic:** A powerful technique for problems involving sums and properties like being a square is to consider the numbers modulo some integer `m`. If we can construct a set `A` where all sums `a_1 + a_2` fall into a specific residue class `k` modulo `m`, and we can show that no perfect square can be in that residue class `k`, then we have found a valid set `A`.\n\n3.  **Choosing the modulus `m`:** Let's try small values for `m`.\n    *   `m=2`: Squares modulo 2 are `0^2 \\equiv 0` and `1^2 \\equiv 1`. All residues are squares. This modulus is not helpful.\n    *   `m=3`: Squares modulo 3 are `0^2 \\equiv 0`, `1^2 \\equiv 1`, and `2^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1`. So, the quadratic residues modulo 3 are `{0, 1}`. The number `2` is a quadratic non-residue modulo 3. This means that any number congruent to `2 \\pmod 3` cannot be a perfect square.\n    *   `m=4`: Squares modulo 4 are `0^2 \\equiv 0`, `1^2 \\equiv 1`, `2^2 \\equiv 0`, `3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 1`. The quadratic residues are `{0, 1}`. The non-residues are `{2, 3}`.\n\n4.  **Constructing the set `A`:**\n    *   Let's use `m=3`. We want the sum of any two elements from `A` to be congruent to `2 \\pmod 3`.\n    *   If we choose `A` to be the set of numbers `n` such that `n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`, then for any `a_1, a_2 \\in A`, we have `a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3` and `a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3`. Their sum is `a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 1 + 1 = 2 \\pmod 3`.\n    *   Since no perfect square can be `2 \\pmod 3`, the sum `a_1 + a_2` can never be a perfect square.\n    *   This gives us a valid construction: `A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} | n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}`.\n\n5.  **Calculating the density `c`:**\n    *   The set `A` consists of the numbers `{1, 4, 7, 10, ...}` up to `N`.\n    *   The number of elements in `A` is approximately `N/3`. As `N \\to \\infty`, the size `|A|` approaches `N/3` exactly.\n    *   This construction shows that we can achieve a density of `c = 1/3`. Thus, `c \\ge 1/3`.\n\n6.  **Can we do better?** What if we use `m=4`?\n    *   We can choose `A` such that all sums are `2 \\pmod 4`. For this to happen, all elements of `A` must be `1 \\pmod 4` (since `1+1=2`) or all must be `3 \\pmod 4` (since `3+3=6\\equiv2`).\n    *   If `A = \\{n \\le N | n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\}`, then `|A| \\approx N/4`. This gives `c = 1/4`, which is smaller than `1/3`.\n    *   Trying other moduli or more complex constructions (like unions of residue classes) has not yielded a better result. For example, trying to find a set of residues `R` mod 12 such that `R+R` avoids squares mod 12 yields a maximum density of `4/12 = 1/3`.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The construction based on modulo 3 gives `c = 1/3`. It is a long-standing conjecture in number theory (by Erdős) that this is the best possible value. While the problem is still open, the value `1/3` is the largest known `c`.\n\nThe following python code demonstrates the `c=1/3` construction by building the set `A` for a given `N` and calculating the resulting density `|A|/N`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_square_free_sum_set(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the construction of a set A such that A+A contains\n    no square numbers, based on modular arithmetic.\n    \n    The construction A = {n in {1,...,N} | n = 1 (mod 3)} yields the\n    best-known density c = 1/3.\n    \n    This function calculates the size of this set A for a given N and shows\n    the ratio |A|/N.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Let A be the set of numbers up to N that are congruent to 1 mod 3.\n    A = [n for n in range(1, N + 1) if n % 3 == 1]\n    \n    # The size of this set A.\n    size_A = len(A)\n    \n    # The density c is the ratio of the size of A to N.\n    c = size_A / N\n    \n    print(f\"For N = {N}:\")\n    # print(f\"The set A is: {A}\")\n    print(f\"The size of set A is |A| = {size_A}\")\n    print(\"The density c is given by the equation: c = |A| / N\")\n    print(f\"Plugging in the numbers: c = {size_A} / {N}\")\n    print(f\"The resulting density is c = {c:.5f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFor any two numbers a1, a2 from set A, their sum is (1 mod 3) + (1 mod 3) = 2 mod 3.\")\n    print(\"However, any perfect square k^2 can only be 0 or 1 mod 3 (0^2=0, 1^2=1, 2^2=4=1).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, no sum of two elements from A can be a perfect square.\")\n    print(\"\\nAs N approaches infinity, this density approaches 1/3.\")\n    print(\"The largest known and conjectured value for c is 1/3.\")\n\n# We can run this for a large N to see the density approaching 1/3.\nN = 1000000\nsolve_square_free_sum_set(N)\n\n```\n<<<1/3>>>"
