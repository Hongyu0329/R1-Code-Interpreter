    # --- Step 1: Analyze HNY's effect ---
    # HNY is a reactive electrophile that induces a cellular stress response.
    # This response is mediated by the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway.
    # Nrf2 activation leads to the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, including ALDH.

    # --- Step 2: Analyze 4-OI's effect ---
    # 4-OI lacks the key reactive groups of HNY and is a much weaker electrophile.
    # Therefore, it is a significantly weaker inducer of the Nrf2 pathway.

    # --- Step 3: Identify the key protein ---
    # Keap1 is the sensor protein for electrophiles in the Nrf2 pathway. It binds Nrf2 and
    # releases it upon modification by electrophiles like HNY.
    # JAK1 is involved in cytokine signaling (JAK-STAT pathway), not this process.
