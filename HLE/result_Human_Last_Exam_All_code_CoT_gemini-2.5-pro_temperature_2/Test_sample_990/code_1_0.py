def solve_fall_time():
    """
    Calculates the time it takes for the raindrop to fall.

    The problem is solved by first deriving the acceleration of the raindrop.
    The equation of motion for the raindrop is d(mv)/dt = mg.
    The rate of mass increase is dm/dt = Rho * pi * r^2 * v.
    By solving the resulting differential equation, the acceleration 'a' is found
    to be constant and equal to g/7.

    We can then use the kinematic equation for an object falling from rest:
    h = (1/2) * a * t^2
    where h is the height, a is the acceleration, and t is the time.

    We are given h = 350*g.
    Substituting the values:
    350*g = (1/2) * (g/7) * t^2

    We can solve this equation for t.
