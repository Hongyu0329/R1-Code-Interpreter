    Calculates the smallest integer t for which the lower filtration of Gal(K/Q_2) is trivial,
    where K is the splitting field of x^4 - 2 over Q_2.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Identify the Galois group G = Gal(K/Q_2). It's the dihedral group D_4 of order 8.
    2. Compute the valuation of the discriminant of the extension K/Q_2. This value is known to be 30.
    3. Use Hilbert's different formula, which states that the valuation of the different (equal to the discriminant valuation for this extension) is the sum of (|G_s| - 1) over all s >= 0.
    4. Based on the properties of ramification groups, solve for the sizes of the groups at each step.
    5. Find the first integer t for which G_t is the trivial group.
