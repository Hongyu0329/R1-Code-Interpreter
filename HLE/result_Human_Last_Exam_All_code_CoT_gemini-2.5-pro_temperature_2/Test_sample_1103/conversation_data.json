    "This problem, known as the Gauss class number problem, requires finding the number of negative fundamental discriminants for a given class number. Calculating these from first principles is a highly complex task in computational number theory. The standard approach is to use pre-computed tables of results established by mathematicians.\n\nMy plan is to use the data from the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), specifically sequence A006203, which tabulates the number of negative fundamental discriminants for each class number `n`. I will create a Python script that stores these known values and retrieves the count for the requested class number, 48.\n\n```python\ndef find_class_number_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Gauss class number problem for h=48 by looking up the result\n    in a pre-computed list of values from authoritative sources (OEIS A006203).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # This dictionary stores the number of negative fundamental discriminants\n    # for a given class number 'h'.
