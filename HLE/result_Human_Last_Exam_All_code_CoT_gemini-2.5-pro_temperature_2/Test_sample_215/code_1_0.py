# This script analyzes the provided R code to determine the number of expected chemotypes.

# 1. For the 'control' group, the R script calls `generate_chemistry(..., 'control')`.
#    This ensures all 360 specimens are treated as 'control'. A single baseline
#    is generated and subtracted from ALL of them. This means they are all
#    generated from a single underlying pattern.
control_chemotypes = 1

# 2. For the 'water_stress' group, the R script calls `generate_chemistry(..., 'water_stress')`.
#    Similarly, this ensures all 510 specimens are 'water_stress'. A new, single
#    baseline is generated for this group and subtracted from ALL of them.
#    They also come from a single underlying pattern.
water_stress_chemotypes = 1

# The R script simulates two distinct datasets, but within each dataset,
# there is only one chemotype being modeled. The question asks for the number
# of chemotypes expected for the control group and the water stressed group, respectively.

# Output the conclusion
print(f"Based on the R script's logic, we should expect the following number of chemotypes:")
print(f"Control group: {control_chemotypes}")
print(f"Water stressed group: {water_stress_chemotypes}")
sys.stdout.flush()
# This corresponds to answer B.
