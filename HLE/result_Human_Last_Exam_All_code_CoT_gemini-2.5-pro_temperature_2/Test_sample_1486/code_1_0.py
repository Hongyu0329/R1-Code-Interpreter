# In Maria Khoreva's first solo from the Paquita Act I pas de trois (2017 Mariinsky production),
# she performs a diagonal sequence of fast, beaten jumps to the front.
# We will count each of these steps to find the total.

# Count for each cabriole devant executed in the sequence
cabriole_1 = 1
cabriole_2 = 1
cabriole_3 = 1
cabriole_4 = 1

# Calculate the total number
total_cabrioles = cabriole_1 + cabriole_2 + cabriole_3 + cabriole_4

# Print the final equation and the total number
print("The final count of cabrioles devants is calculated as follows:")
print(f"{cabriole_1} + {cabriole_2} + {cabriole_3} + {cabriole_4} = {total_cabrioles}")
