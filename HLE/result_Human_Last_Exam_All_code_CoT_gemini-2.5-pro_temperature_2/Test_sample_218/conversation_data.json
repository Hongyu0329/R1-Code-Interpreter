    "To find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension less than 500,000, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Representations and Partitions:** There is a fundamental theorem in the representation theory of the symmetric group stating that its irreducible representations are in a one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. For $S_{25}$, we need to consider all integer partitions of 25.\n\n2.  **Dimension Calculation:** The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a specific partition $\\lambda$ of $n$ can be calculated using the Hook Length Formula. For each cell in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, its hook length is the number of cells to its right in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus one for the cell itself. The dimension $d_{\\lambda}$ is given by:\n    $d_{\\lambda} = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{ij}}$\n    where the product in the denominator is the product of the hook lengths of all cells $(i,j)$ in the diagram.\n\n3.  **Computational Plan:** The plan is to implement a Python script that will:\n    a. Generate all integer partitions of 25. The number of partitions of 25 is $P(25) = 1958$, which is a manageable number for a computer.\n    b. For each partition, construct its Young diagram and calculate the hook lengths for all its cells.\n    c. Use the hook lengths to compute the dimension of the corresponding irrep using the formula above. Python's ability to handle arbitrarily large integers is crucial here, as 25! and the product of hooks are very large numbers.\n    d. Check if the calculated dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n    e. Count the number of partitions that satisfy this condition.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It will iterate through all partitions, calculate the dimensions, and print out the partitions and their corresponding dimensions that are below the limit, along with the final total count.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef partitions_generator(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    A generator function that yields all integer partitions of n\n    in descending order.\n    \"\"\"\n    def generate(target, max_val, current_partition):\n        if target == 0:\n            yield current_partition\n            return\n        # The next part can be at most min(target, max_val) to keep the\n        # partition in descending order.\n        for part in range(min(target, max_val), 0, -1):\n            # The yield from statement chains the generators.\n            yield from generate(target - part, part, current_partition + [part])\n    \n    yield from generate(n, n, [])\n\ndef calculate_dimension(partition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of an irreducible representation of S_n\n    for a given partition using the Hook Length Formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = sum(partition)\n    \n    # Python handles large integers automatically.\n    n_factorial = math.factorial(n)\n\n    hook_product = 1\n    # Iterate over each cell (i, j) in the Young diagram of the partition.\n    # i is the row index, row_len is the length of the row.\n    for i, row_len in enumerate(partition):\n        # j is the column index.\n        for j in range(row_len):\n            # Calculate the hook length for the cell (i, j).\n            \n            # 1.
