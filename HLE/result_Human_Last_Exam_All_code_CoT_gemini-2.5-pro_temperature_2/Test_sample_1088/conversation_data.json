    "Of course. The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set depends on the specific atom. The notation \"6-311G**\" is a Pople-style basis set, and its meaning varies slightly for hydrogen versus other \"heavy\" atoms.\n\nHere is a plan to answer your question:\n1.  First, I will decode the meaning of each part of the \"6-311G**\" notation for a representative heavy atom (Carbon, C) and for Hydrogen (H).\n2.  I will then calculate the total number of primitive Gaussians for Carbon by summing the primitives from its core orbitals, valence orbitals, and polarization functions.\n3.  Finally, I will provide a Python script that performs this calculation for Carbon and prints a step-by-step breakdown, including the final equation and result, as requested.\n\n### Decoding the 6-311G** Basis Set\n\n*   **For a heavy atom (like Carbon, from Li-Ne):**\n    *   `6-`: The core `1s` atomic orbital is represented by one contracted function made from **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   `-311G`: The valence `2s` and `2p` orbitals are split into three functions each (a triple-zeta representation).\n        *   The inner valence (`2s`, `2p`) is described by one function made from **3** primitives.\n        *   The middle valence is described by one function made from **1** primitive.\n        *   The outer valence is described by one function made from **1** primitive.\n        For these atoms, the `s` and `p` valence shells share exponents, so we count primitives for both `s` and `p` types at each level.\n    *   `**`: The first `*` adds a set of `d`-type polarization functions to the heavy atom. This is a single set of uncontracted `d` functions (5 functions total, each from one primitive). The second `*` applies to Hydrogen.\n\n*   **For a Hydrogen atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n    *   `-311G`: Its `1s` valence orbital is split into three functions made from **3**, **1**, and **1** primitives, respectively.\n    *   `**`: The second `*` adds a set of `p`-type polarization functions to Hydrogen.\n\nThe following Python script calculates the total number of primitives for a Carbon atom as a representative example.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_primitives_for_carbon():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of primitive Gaussians for a Carbon atom\n    in the 6-311G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n    atom_symbol = \"C\"\n    atom_name = \"Carbon\"\n\n    # The number of functions for each angular momentum (l)\n    # s (l=0) has 1 function\n    # p (l=1) has 3 functions (px, py, pz)\n    # d (l=2) has 5 functions (using spherical harmonics, the modern standard)\n    deg = {'s': 1, 'p': 3, 'd': 5}\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set for {atom_name} ({atom_symbol}).\\n\")\n    print(\"The total is a sum of primitives for core, valence, and polarization functions.\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
