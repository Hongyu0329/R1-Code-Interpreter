    "An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer could use Grover's algorithm to speed up the brute-force search for a symmetric key. This algorithm provides a quadratic speedup, which means that to search a space of N possibilities, it only takes roughly sqrt(N) operations, whereas a classical computer would take about N/2 operations.\n\nFor a symmetric key of length `n` bits, there are 2^n possible keys.\n- A classical brute-force attack would have a complexity of approximately 2^n.\n- A quantum brute-force attack using Grover's algorithm would have a complexity of approximately sqrt(2^n) = 2^(n/2).\n\nThis means a quantum computer effectively halves the bit-strength of a symmetric key.\n\nThe current industry standard for strong classical encryption is a 128-bit key (like in AES-128). To achieve an equivalent level of security against a quantum computer, we need the post-quantum security strength to be at least 128 bits.\n\nLet `n` be the new required key length. We set up the equation:\n`n / 2 = 128`\n\nSolving for `n` gives us `n = 256`. Therefore, to maintain a 128-bit security level against a quantum attacker, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long.\n\n```python\ndef explain_quantum_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimum symmetric key length required\n    to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The target security level we want to maintain, equivalent to strong\n    # classical algorithms like AES-128.\n    target_security_level = 128\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the Threat\")\n    print(\"An ideal quantum computer can use Grover's algorithm for search problems.\")\n    print(\"This provides a quadratic speedup over classical computers for brute-force attacks.\")\n    print(\"\\nClassical Attack Complexity on an n-bit key: 2^n\")\n    print(\"Quantum Attack Complexity on an n-bit key: sqrt(2^n) = 2^(n/2)\")\n    print(\"This means the effective bit-strength of a key is halved.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Define the Security Requirement\")\n    print(f\"We want to achieve a post-quantum security level of at least {target_security_level} bits.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Set up the Equation\")\n    print(\"Let 'n' be the required minimum key length.\")\n    print(f\"The post-quantum security strength is n/2.
