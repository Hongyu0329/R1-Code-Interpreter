    A very high concentration of a substance like 500 mM GalNAc can be

    effects. A major concern is that the cells might reduce the amount of the
    MUC1 protein expressed on their surface through internalization or shedding.

    By comparing the anti-FLAG signal in the control (PBS) vs. the inhibitor (GalNAc)
