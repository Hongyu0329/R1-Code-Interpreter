# Step 1: Explain the physical principles and the derivation of the simplified expression.
print("The solution to this problem lies in using a quantity that is a Lorentz invariant, meaning it is the same in all inertial frames of reference.")
print("This quantity is derived from the scalar product of the four-momenta of photons from two stars (i and j):")
print("E_i * E_j * (1 - cos(θ_ij)) = constant")
print("where E is the photon energy and θ_ij is the angle between the stars.")

print("\nIn the first frame, due to the perfect symmetry (all angles are equal), we can assume the energy E from each star is the same.")
print("Thus, the invariant `C` has the same value for any pair of stars in this frame.")

print("\nIn the second frame, we want to find the ratio (1 - cos(θ'_{14})) / (1 - cos(θ'_{34})).")
print("Using the invariant, we can write:")
print("1 - cos(θ'_{14}) = C / (E'_{1} * E'_{4})")
print("1 - cos(θ'_{34}) = C / (E'_{3} * E'_{4})")
print("\nDividing these two expressions, the problem elegantly simplifies to finding the ratio of the observed energies in the second frame:")
print("(1 - cos(θ'_{14})) / (1 - cos(θ'_{34})) = (C / (E'_{1} * E'_{4})) / (C / (E'_{3} * E'_{4})) = E'_{3} / E'_{1}")

print("\nStep 2: Calculate the energy ratio E'_{3} / E'_{1} using the angles given for the second frame.")
print("From the invariant relationship for pairs (1,3) and (1,2) in the second frame, we get:")
print("1) E'_{1} * E'_{3} * (1 - cos(θ'_{13})) = C")
print("2) E'_{1} * E'_{2} * (1 - cos(θ'_{12})) = C")

print("By also considering the pair (2,3), which has the same angle as (1,3), we find that E'_{1} = E'_{2}.")
print("Substituting E'_{1} for E'_{2} into equation (2), and using θ'_{12} = π/2 (so cos(θ'_{12}) = 0), gives: (E'_{1})² = C.")

print("\nNow we substitute C = (E'_{1})² into equation (1):")
print("E'_{1} * E'_{3} * (1 - cos(θ'_{13})) = (E'_{1})²")
print("Dividing by E'_{1} yields the energy ratio:")
print("E'_{3} / E'_{1} = 1 / (1 - cos(θ'_{13}))")

print("\nStep 3: Calculate the final numerical value using θ'_{13} = 3π/4.")

cos_val = math.cos(3 * math.pi / 4) # This is -sqrt(2)/2
sqrt_2_val = math.sqrt(2)

# Symbolic simplification: 1 / (1 - (-sqrt(2)/2)) = 1 / (1 + sqrt(2)/2) = 2 / (2 + sqrt(2))
# Rationalize: 2*(2 - sqrt(2)) / ((2+sqrt(2))*(2-sqrt(2))) = 2*(2 - sqrt(2)) / (4 - 2) = 2 - sqrt(2)
final_value = 2 - sqrt_2_val

print("The calculation proceeds as follows:")
print(f"Ratio = 1 / (1 - cos(3π/4))")
print(f"Ratio = 1 / (1 - ({-sqrt_2_val/2:.7f}))")
print(f"Ratio = 1 / (1 + {sqrt_2_val/2:.7f})")
