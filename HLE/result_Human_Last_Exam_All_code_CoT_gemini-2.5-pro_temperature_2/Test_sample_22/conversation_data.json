    "To answer this question, I will perform a simulation to demonstrate the relationship between SNP heritability and the predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Simulate Genetic Data:** I will create a simulated dataset with a specific number of individuals and SNPs. A subset of these SNPs will be designated as \"causal,\" meaning they have a true effect on a phenotype.\n2.  **Simulate a Phenotype:** Based on the causal SNPs and their true effects, I will calculate a \"true genetic value\" for each individual. Then, I will add random \"environmental\" noise to create the final phenotype. The proportion of the total phenotypic variance that is due to the genetic value is the **SNP heritability (h²_SNP)**. This represents the theoretical maximum predictive power of the SNPs.\n3.  **Simulate a GWAS:** I will split the data into a \"discovery\" set (for the GWAS) and a \"target\" set (for prediction). In the discovery set, I will estimate the effect size of each SNP, mimicking a GWAS. These estimated effects will be noisy due to the finite sample size.\n4.  **Build and Test a PGS:** Using the *estimated* effect sizes from the simulated GWAS, I will build a PGS for the individuals in the target set. I will then measure the predictive ability of this PGS by calculating how much of the variance in the target set's phenotype it can explain (**R²_PGS**).\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** Finally, I will compare the SNP heritability (the theoretical maximum) with the PGS predictive ability (the achieved prediction). The simulation will show that the R²_PGS is lower than the h²_SNP, demonstrating that the statement is true.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport scipy.stats\n\ndef simulate_pgs_heritability_comparison():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates genetic data to demonstrate that the predictive\n    ability of a Polygenic Score (PGS) is lower than the SNP heritability.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
