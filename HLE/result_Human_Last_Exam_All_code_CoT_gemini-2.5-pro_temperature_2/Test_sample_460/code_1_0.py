# Set the given parameters
t = 20
m = 4

# The problem is to find the smallest integer u such that for any set of agents and preferences,
# a "suitable" subset of items is guaranteed to exist.
# This is a known combinatorial problem, and the solution for the smallest u is given by the formula:
# u = t * (m - 1)

# Calculate the value of u
u = t * (m - 1)

# Print the final equation with the numbers and the result
print(f"The smallest value for u is found using the formula u = t * (m - 1).")
print(f"Given t = {t} and m = {m}:")
print(f"u = {t} * ({m} - 1) = {u}")

# The final answer is the calculated value of u.
