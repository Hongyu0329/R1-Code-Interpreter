# Based on the reasoning that the complex fractional part of the function is
# singular at x=0 (implying a typo) and should be disregarded, we only
# consider the first term of the expression: T1(x) = 9*x^4 / (16*e).

# The coefficient of the x^4 term is 9 / (16*e).
# This script defines and prints this value.

# Define the numbers in the coefficient equation symbolically.
numerator = 9
denominator = 16
e_symbol = sympy.E

# The symbolic expression for the coefficient.
coefficient = numerator / (denominator * e_symbol)

# As requested, output the numbers forming the final equation for the coefficient.
