    "This riddle is a math puzzle hidden within a haiku. My approach is to decipher the numerical values from the poem and solve the underlying equation.\n\n**Step-by-step Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Haiku:** The three lines of the haiku will be interpreted as the three coefficients—a, b, and c—of a standard quadratic equation, `ax² + bx + c = 0`.\n    *   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**: \"August\" is the 8th month of the year, so we can infer `a = 8`.\n    *   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: \"Twice fifteen\" is a straightforward calculation: 2 * 15 = 30. This gives us `b = 30`.\n    *   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**: For a puzzle of this nature to have a clean solution, the discriminant of the quadratic formula (`b² - 4ac`) should be a perfect square. Given `a = 8` and `b = 30`, using the number 7, which is often considered a \"divine\" number in many cultures, for `c` fulfills this requirement. Therefore, `c = 7`.\n\n2.  **Solve the Equation:** With the coefficients `a=8`, `b=30`, and `c=7`, I will form the equation `8x² + 30x + 7 = 0` and solve for the two roots of `x` using the quadratic formula.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Answer:** The riddle's question, \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\", implies there are two solutions that must be compared alphabetically. I will convert the two numerical roots into their English word equivalents (e.g., \"-1/4\" becomes \"negative one quarter\"). The root whose name comes first alphabetically is the correct answer.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport fractions\n\ndef solve_haiku_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle presented in the haiku by treating it\n    as a quadratic equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Decode the coefficients a, b, and c from the haiku.\n    # a: \"An August tempest\" -> \"August\" is the 8th month.\n    a = 8\n    # b: \"Twice fifteen\" -> 2 * 15.\n    b = 30\n    # c: \"A divine one yields\" -> 7 is often considered a \"divine\" number.\n    # This choice makes the discriminant a perfect square, a common feature in such riddles.\n    c = 7\n\n    # The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"The riddle describes the quadratic equation: {a}x^2 + {b}x + {c} = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.\n    # x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a\n    discriminant = (b**2) - (4 * a * c)\n\n    if discriminant < 0:\n        print(\"The equation has no real roots.\")\n        return\n\n    # Calculate the two roots\n    sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)\n    \n    # Root 1\n    root1_numerator = -b + sqrt_discriminant\n    root1_denominator = 2 * a\n    root1 = root1_numerator / root1_denominator\n    \n    # Root 2\n    root2_numerator = -b - sqrt_discriminant\n    root2_denominator = 2 * a\n    root2 = root2_numerator / root2_denominator\n\n    # Represent roots as precise fractions\n    frac1 = fractions.Fraction(root1).limit_denominator()\n    frac2 = fractions.Fraction(root2).limit_denominator()\n    \n    print(f\"The two solutions (roots) are {root1} and {root2}.\")\n    print(f\"Expressed as fractions, the roots are {frac1} and {frac2}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    # Step 3: Determine the final answer based on the alphabetical order constraint.\n    # The word representations of the fractions need to be compared.\n    # We assign the word forms based on which fraction corresponds to which root.\n    root_words = {\n        str(frac1): \"negative one quarter\",\n        str(frac2): \"negative seven halves\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The question asks for the answer in alphabetical order.\")\n    print(\"Comparing the English names of the roots:\")\n    print(f\"'{frac1}' is read as '{root_words[str(frac1)]}'\")\n    print(f\"'{frac2}' is read as '{root_words[str(frac2)]}'\")\n\n    # Determine which comes first alphabetically\n    final_answer_word = min(root_words.values())\n    \n    final_answer_fraction = \"\"\n    for k, v in root_words.items():\n        if v == final_answer_word:\n            final_answer_fraction = k\n            break\n            \n    print(f\"\\nAlphabetically, '{final_answer_word}' comes first.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the final answer is {final_answer_fraction}.\")\n\nsolve_haiku_riddle()\n```\n<<<-1/4>>>"
