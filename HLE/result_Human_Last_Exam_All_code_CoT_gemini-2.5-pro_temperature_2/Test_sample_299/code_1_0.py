Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function f.
Let f be a continuous function from the real numbers to the real numbers such that f(f(x)) = exp(x).

Injectivity:
If f(x1) = f(x2), then f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)), which implies exp(x1) = exp(x2).
Since exp(x) is an injective (one-to-one) function, we must have x1 = x2.
Therefore, f must be an injective function.

Monotonicity:
A continuous injective function defined on the entire real line must be strictly monotonic.
This means f must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. We analyze these two cases separately.

Step 2: Case 1: f is strictly increasing.
If f is strictly increasing, for x1 < x2, we have f(x1) < f(x2).
Applying f again, we get f(f(x1)) < f(f(x2)), which means exp(x1) < exp(x2). This is consistent with exp(x) being a strictly increasing function.

Let's explore the properties of an increasing solution f.
- f can have no fixed points. If f(x0) = x0, then f(f(x0)) = x0, which would mean exp(x0) = x0. The function g(x) = exp(x) - x has derivative g'(x) = exp(x) - 1. The minimum value is at x=0, where g(0) = 1. Thus, exp(x) > x for all x, and there are no fixed points.
- This implies that for all x, either f(x) > x or f(x) < x. If f(x) < x, then f(f(x)) < f(x) < x, which implies exp(x) < x. This is false. Therefore, we must have f(x) > x for all x.
- Combining f(x) > x and applying f to both sides gives f(f(x)) > f(x), so exp(x) > f(x).
- So, any strictly increasing solution must satisfy x < f(x) < exp(x).

We can construct these functions, showing there's a continuum of them.
Let's define f by making a choice for f(0). Let f(0) = c. From the inequality above, 0 < f(0) < exp(0), so 0 < c < 1.
This single choice, f(0)=c, starts to define f at a series of points:
f(c) = f(f(0)) = exp(0) = 1
f(1) = f(f(c)) = exp(c)
f(exp(c)) = f(f(1)) = exp(1) = e
... and so on.

To define f everywhere, we can make a continuous, strictly increasing choice for f on the interval [0, c]. Let this be a function h(x) which maps [0, c] to [c, 1], with h(0)=c and h(c)=1. There is a continuum of choices for such a function h (itself an increasing homeomorphism).
For each specific choice of c in (0,1) and each choice of such a function h, the function f is uniquely determined over the entire real line through the equation f(f(x)) = exp(x). For instance, for x in [c, 1], we can write x = h(y) for some y in [0, c]. Then f(x) must be defined as f(h(y)) = f(f(y)) = exp(y) = exp(h^-1(x)).
The set of choices for c has cardinality c (the cardinality of the continuum). For each c, the set of possible functions h also has cardinality c.
The total number of such functions is c * c = c.
So, there is a continuum of strictly increasing solutions.

Step 3: Case 2: f is strictly decreasing.
If f is strictly decreasing, for x1 < x2, we have f(x1) > f(x2).
Applying the decreasing function f again reverses the inequality: f(f(x1)) < f(f(x2)), which means exp(x1) < exp(x2). This is consistent.

However, we can prove by contradiction that no such function exists.
- As f is a strictly decreasing continuous function defined on R, its graph must cross the line y=x.
- To be formal, consider g(x) = f(x) - x. As x -> +infinity, f(x) -> -infinity (or a finite limit), so g(x) -> -infinity. As x -> -infinity, f(x) -> +infinity (or a finite limit), so g(x) -> +infinity.
- Since g(x) is continuous and goes from +infinity to -infinity, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a point x0 where g(x0) = 0, i.e., f(x0) = x0.
- As shown before, if f has a fixed point x0, then exp(x0) = x0, which has no real solutions.
- This contradiction proves that there are no strictly decreasing continuous functions f: R -> R that satisfy the equation. (A more detailed proof showing the range of f need not be all of R leads to the contradiction that exp(M) < M for some M, which is also impossible.)

Step 4: Conclusion.
The set of all solutions consists only of the strictly increasing functions.
We have shown that the cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum (c).
