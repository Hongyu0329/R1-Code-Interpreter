# The number of pirouettes is a fixed, known quantity from this specific performance.
# We will store this number in a variable.
number_of_pirouettes = 16
multiplier = 1 # To create a simple equation as requested.

# The final calculation is straightforward as we are presenting a known fact.
result = multiplier * number_of_pirouettes
