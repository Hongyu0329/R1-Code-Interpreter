    "My plan is to determine the structure of the hydrocarbon compound by systematically analyzing the provided molecular formula and $^{13}$C NMR data.\n\nHere is my thinking process:\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** Using the molecular formula $C_7H_{14}$, I will calculate the DoU to determine if the compound contains rings or double/triple bonds. The formula is DoU = C - (H/2) + 1.\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Data:** I will interpret each signal (`chemical shift (multiplicity)`) to identify the type of carbon atom it represents (e.g., CH3, CH2, CH, or quaternary C) and its likely chemical environment (alkane vs. alkene).\n3.  **Deduce the Core Structure:** The signals in the alkene region (100-150 ppm) will help identify the structure of the C=C double bond.\n4.  **Reconcile Carbon Count:** The molecular formula specifies 7 carbons, but there are only 6 NMR signals. This indicates that one signal must represent two chemically equivalent carbons due to symmetry. I will identify which signal type (`q`, `t`, `d`, `s`) is likely to be overlapping.\n5.  **Assemble the Fragments:** Based on the deduced fragments (e.g., the C=C group, isopropyl group, ethyl group, etc.), I will piece together the complete molecular structure that is consistent with all the given data.\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:** Once the correct structure is determined, I will apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to find the official name of the compound.\n7.  **Final Code:** I will present this entire logical deduction as a Python script that prints the analysis step-by-step, as requested. The script will calculate the DoU, analyze the NMR signals, explain the structural deduction, and print the final IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine the IUPAC name of a hydrocarbon.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given data\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    carbons = 7\n    hydrogens = 14\n    nmr_signals = \"145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)\"\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\")\n    print(f\"Molecular Formula: {molecular_formula}\")\n    dou = carbons - (hydrogens / 2) + 1\n    print(f\"DoU = Carbon atoms - (Hydrogen atoms / 2) + 1\")\n    # The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"DoU = {carbons} - ({hydrogens} / 2) + 1 = {int(dou)}\")\n    print(\"A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Signals\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Signals\")\n    print(f\"Signals: {nmr_signals}\")\n    print(\"Signal multiplicity hints at the number of attached hydrogens:\")\n    print(\"  s = singlet (Quaternary C, 0H)\")\n    print(\"  t = triplet (Methylene CH2, 2H)\")\n    print(\"  d = doublet (Methine CH, 1H)\")\n    print(\"  q = quartet (Methyl CH3, 3H)\\n\")\n    print(\"Interpreting the signals:\")\n    print(\" - 145(s): A quaternary C in the alkene region (>100 ppm), suggesting a >C= structure.\")\n    print(\" - 112(t): A CH2 carbon in the alkene region, suggesting a =CH2 structure.\")\n    print(\"   ==> These two signals point to a terminal, disubstituted alkene: R1-C(=CH2)-R2.\\n\")\n    print(\" - 48(t): An sp3 (alkane) CH2 group.\")\n    print(\" - 27(d): An sp3 (alkane) CH group.\")\n    print(\" - 22(q): An sp3 (alkane) CH3 group.\")\n    print(\" - 21(q): Another sp3 (alkane) CH3 group.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Reconcile atom count and deduce the structure\n    print(\"Step 3: Assemble the molecular structure\")\n    print(f\"The formula has {carbons} carbons, but the NMR spectrum shows only 6 distinct signals.\")\n    print(\"This indicates that one signal must represent two chemically equivalent carbons.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Identifying the overlapping signal:\")\n    print(\"The molecule has C, CH, CH2, and CH3 groups.
