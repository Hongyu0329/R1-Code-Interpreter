def run_strategy_simulation():
    """
    This function simulates and explains Alice's winning strategy for Case (A).

    The problem states there's a sequence of numbers in boxes which is eventually zero.
    This means the set of boxes with non-zero numbers, let's call it D, is finite.
    Alice's goal is to guess the number in a closed box with >= 9/10 probability.

    Alice's Winning Strategy for (A):
    1.  The 'representative' sequence for any eventually-zero sequence is the all-zero
        sequence, r = (0, 0, 0, ...). So Alice's guess for any box will be 0.
    2.  She wins if she chooses to guess a box `k` that is not in the finite set D.
    3.  To choose `k`, she can partition the boxes into two infinite sets, e.g.,
        Evens (which she decides to open) and Odds (which she decides to leave closed).
    4.  The set of boxes she can guess from is C = {1, 3, 5, ...}, which is infinite.
        The set of boxes where she would be wrong is `D_C = D \cap C`, which is finite.
    5.  The strategy is to pick a box `k` randomly from C. The probability of
        picking one of the few 'bad' boxes from an infinite set is 0. So she wins
        with probability 1.

    The simulation below models this.
