    This function solves the riddle based on Fernand Braudel's citation of Paul Morand.

    Fernand Braudel, in his work "The Perspective of the World," discusses the
    importance of a global context for understanding history. He uses a quote
    from French writer Paul Morand to make his point.

    The quote essentially states that a fact, like the existence of a nation,
    is meaningless by itself. To acquire significance, it must be placed within a
    larger frame of referenceâ€”the "sphere," which represents the world or a world-economy.
    Therefore, the conceptual entity being discussed is the nation itself.
