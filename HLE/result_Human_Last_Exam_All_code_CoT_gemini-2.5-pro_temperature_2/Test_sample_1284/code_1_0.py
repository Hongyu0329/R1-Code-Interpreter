# The problem asks for the smallest integer dimension 'n' for which a specific
# Fourier restriction estimate fails.
# Let the inequality be denoted by I(n, X, f, R).
#
# I(n, X, f, R):  ||Ef||_{L^{2n/(n-1)}(X)} <= C_epsilon * R^epsilon * ||f||_2
#
# 1. Status of the conjecture for X = B_R (a ball of radius R):
#    The endpoint restriction conjecture for the paraboloid states that the
#    inequality should hold for X = B_R.
#    - For dimensions n >= 3, this has been proven to be TRUE by Larry Guth,
#      building upon work by Bourgain, Tao, and others.
#
# 2. Relationship between the estimate on X and on B_R:
#    The set X is defined as a union of unit balls within B_R.
#    This means X is a subset of B_R.
#    For any function g and any p > 0, if X is a subset of B_R, then
#    ||g||_{L^p(X)} <= ||g||_{L^p(B_R)}.
#
# 3. Conclusion for n >= 3:
#    From (1) and (2), for any n >= 3, we have:
#    ||Ef||_{L^{2n/(n-1)}(X)} <= ||Ef||_{L^{2n/(n-1)}(B_R)} <= C_epsilon * R^epsilon * ||f||_2.
#    This means that for n >= 3, the inequality in the problem ALWAYS HOLDS.
#
# 4. Finding the failure dimension:
#    The problem explicitly states that the inequality "DOES NOT always have" to hold.
#    This implies that there must exist a dimension 'n' for which a counterexample exists.
#    Since the inequality holds for all n >= 3, the failure must occur at n < 3.
#
# 5. The smallest dimension:
#    The dimension 'n' of the ambient space must be at least 2 for the (n-1)-dimensional
#    paraboloid to be non-trivial (for n=1, it would be a point).
#    Therefore, the smallest possible dimension 'n' for which the inequality can fail is 2.
