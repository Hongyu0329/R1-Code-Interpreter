    "My plan to solve this problem is to use the computational group theory system GAP, which can be conveniently called from Python using the `pygap` library.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the Group G**: I will represent the three given permutations `a`, `b`, and `c` in a format that GAP understands. Then, I will construct the group `G` as the group generated by these three elements.\n2.  **Compute the Schur Multiplier**: I will use GAP's `SchurMultiplier` function on the group `G`. The Schur multiplier, which the problem calls `A`, is a finite abelian group. GAP provides its structure in terms of its abelian invariants, for example, as a list `[n1, n2, ...]`, which corresponds to the group structure $\\mathbb{Z}_{n1} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{n2} \\times \\dots$.\n3.  **Count Subgroup Isomorphism Classes**: To find the number of proper subgroups of `A` up to isomorphism, I will first find the number of *all* subgroup isomorphism classes of `A`. An effective way to do this is to instruct GAP to generate all subgroups of `A`, determine the isomorphism type (represented by their abelian invariants) for each of these subgroups, and then count the number of unique isomorphism types found.\n4.  **Final Calculation**: The number of isomorphism classes of *proper* subgroups is one less than the total number of isomorphism classes of all subgroups (this excludes the isomorphism class of `A` itself). The Python code will perform this calculation and print the details, including the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\nimport pygap\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Schur multiplier of a given permutation group G,\n    and then counts the number of its proper subgroups up to isomorphism.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script uses the 'pygap' library to interface with the GAP system.\")\n    print(\"Please ensure GAP is installed on your system for this script to run.\")\n    \n    # Initialize GAP\n    try:\n        gap = pygap.gap_instance(max_workspace_size=2048)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(\"\\nFailed to initialize GAP.
