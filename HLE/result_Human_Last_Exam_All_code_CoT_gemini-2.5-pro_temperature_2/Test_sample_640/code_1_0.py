# The problem asks to identify all correct statements about the relationships
# between the potential (V), the Jost matrix (F), and the scattering matrix (S)
# in multi-channel quantum scattering.
#
# Our analysis concluded the following:
# 1. Correct: A nontrivially coupled S-matrix requires a nontrivially coupled potential.
# 2. Incorrect: A diagonal S-matrix does not necessarily mean the potential is diagonal.
# 3. Incorrect: A nontrivially coupled potential can, in some cases, produce a trivially coupled (e.g., diagonal) Jost matrix.
# 4. Correct: The coupling properties of the S-matrix and Jost matrix are tightly linked; a nontrivially coupled Jost matrix implies a nontrivially coupled S-matrix.
# 5. Correct: It is possible to construct nontrivially coupled potentials that have diagonal Jost matrices.
