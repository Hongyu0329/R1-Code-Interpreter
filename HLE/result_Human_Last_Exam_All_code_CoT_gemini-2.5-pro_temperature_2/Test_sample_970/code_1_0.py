    Analyzes the assumptions for the convergence of expected information gain for a Bayesian agent.

    The problem asks for the necessary assumption to prove that the expected information
    gain, E[KL(P_{t+1} || P_t)], converges to zero.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The total expected information an agent can gain is bounded by its initial uncertainty.
    2. The initial uncertainty is measured by the entropy of the prior distribution, H(P_0).
    3. The sum of all future expected information gains is less than or equal to H(P_0).
    4. If H(P_0) is finite (Assumption a), the infinite sum of non-negative expected information
       gains must converge.
    5. For an infinite series of non-negative terms to converge, the terms themselves must
       approach zero.
    6. Therefore, assuming the prior has finite entropy (a) is sufficient to prove that
       the expected information gain approaches zero. The other options are either too restrictive (d),
       consequences rather than preconditions (c, e), or not directly related to the
       convergence of belief itself (b).

    The required format is Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). For a single choice 'a',
    the CNF is [(a)].
