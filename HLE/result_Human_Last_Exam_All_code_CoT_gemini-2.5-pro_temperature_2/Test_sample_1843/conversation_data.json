    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factor the Conductor:** First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$. A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi_{p^k}$, where $p^k$ are the prime power factors of $N$. The character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p^k}$ is primitive.\n2.  **Order of Characters:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its component characters. We need this LCM to be 6.\n3.  **Count Primitive Characters for Each Factor:** For each prime power factor $p^k$ of $N$, we will count the number of available primitive characters whose orders are divisors of 6. Let $c(p^k, d)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $p^k$ and order $d$.\n4.  **Combine the Results:** We will determine the total number of combinations of these component characters such that the LCM of their orders is exactly 6. The total count will be the product of the number of valid choices for each factor.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom sympy import factorint, totient\n\ndef num_primitive_chars_prime_power(p, a, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor p^a and order k.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k == 0:\n        return 0\n    # The trivial character (order 1) is only primitive for conductor 1.\n    if k == 1:\n        return 0\n\n    # Case p=2\n    if p == 2:\n        if a == 1: # Conductor 2 does not have primitive characters.
