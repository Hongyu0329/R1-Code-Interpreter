def solve_hopf_algebra_problem():
    """
    This function formulates and prints the solution to the posed abstract algebra problem.
    The reasoning is based on the properties of module algebras over Hopf algebras.

    The key derivation steps are:
    1.  The action of an element `h` from a Hopf algebra `H` on an element `s` in an `H`-module algebra `R` is given by the formula: h . s = Σ (h_(1) . 1_R) * (h_(2) . s).
    2.  For the group-like element `g`, its coproduct is `Δ(g) = g ⊗ g`. Applying the formula gives `g . s = (g . 1_R) * (g . s)`. With the given `g . 1_R = 0`, this implies `g . s = 0` for any `s` in `R`.
    3.  For the skew-primitive element `x`, its coproduct is `Δ(x) = x ⊗ 1 + g ⊗ x`. Applying the formula and assuming a unital action (`1 . s = s`), we get:
        `x . s = (x . 1_R) * (1 . s) + (g . 1_R) * (x . s)`.
        Using `w = x . 1_R` and `g . 1_R = 0`, this simplifies to `x . s = w * s`.
    4.  The action of a power `x^d` is derived from the associativity of the action: `x^d . r = x . (x . (...(x . r)))`. Since `x` acts as left-multiplication by the central element `w`, it follows that `x^d . r = w^d * r`.

    With these results, the questions are answered as follows:
    """

    # (a) Condition for x^d * a . r = 0
    # The action is x^d . (a . r). Applying our formula, this is w^d * (a . r).
    # For this to be 0 for any `a` and `r` (in a non-trivial module), we need w^d to be 0.
    a_expr = "w^d = 0"

    # (b) Expression for x^d . r
    # As derived above, the action is multiplication by w^d.
    b_expr = "w^d * r"

    # (c) Can x^j * a . r for j >= M be zero?
    # The expression is w^j * (a . r). This expression *can* be zero. For instance,
    # if w itself is zero or a nilpotent element, the expression will be zero for
    # a sufficiently large j. Thus, the possibility exists.
    c_ans = "yes"

    # Construct the final output string as per the user's format.
    final_answer_string = f"(a) [{a_expr}] (b) [{b_expr}] (c) [{c_ans}]"

    print(final_answer_string)
