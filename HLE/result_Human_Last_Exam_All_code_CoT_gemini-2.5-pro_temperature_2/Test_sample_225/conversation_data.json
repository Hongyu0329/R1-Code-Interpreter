    "The user wants to find the number of self-intersection points for the parametric curve given by the equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the type of curve:** The given curve is a Lissajous curve.\n2.  **Use the standard form:** To apply a known formula, we'll express both trigonometric functions in the same form (cosine). We can use the identity `sin(θ) = cos(θ - π/2)`. This transforms our equations to `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = cos(5t - π/2)`.\n3.  **Find the appropriate formula:** The number of self-intersections for a Lissajous curve of the form `x(t) = cos(nt)`, `y(t) = cos(kt + ψ)` depends on the integer parameters `n` and `k`. For the case where `n` and `k` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), there is a standard formula.\n4.  **Check the conditions:** In our case, `n=9` and `k=5`. Their greatest common divisor, `gcd(9, 5)`, is 1, so they are coprime. Also, both `n` and `k` are odd integers.\n5.  **Apply the formula:** The formula for the number of self-intersections `N` when `n` and `k` are coprime and both are odd is:\n    `N = (n*k - n - k + 1) / 2`\n    The number of intersection points is independent of the phase shift `ψ` as long as the curve does not pass through the origin, which this curve does not.\n6.  **Implement in Python:** Write a Python script to substitute `n=9` and `k=5` into the formula and print the calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the curve\n    (cos(9t), sin(5t)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The curve is given by x(t) = cos(nt) and y(t) = sin(kt)\n    # with n = 9 and k = 5.\n    n = 9\n    k = 5\n\n    # This is a Lissajous curve. To use a standard formula, we write it as:\n    # x(t) = cos(nt)\n    # y(t) = cos(kt + psi), where sin(5t) = cos(5t - pi/2).\n\n    # The number of self-intersections for coprime n and k is given by a formula.\n    # First, confirm they are coprime.\n    if math.gcd(n, k) != 1:\n        print(f\"Error: n={n} and k={k} are not coprime.\")\n        return\n\n    # For n, k coprime and both odd, the formula is:\n    # N = (n*k - n - k + 1) / 2\n    \n    # Calculate the number of intersections\n    numerator_val = n * k - n - k + 1\n    num_intersections = numerator_val / 2\n\n    print(\"To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve (cos(9t), sin(5t)), we use a standard formula for Lissajous curves.\")\n    print(\"The parameters are n=9 and k=5.\")\n    print(\"Since n and k are coprime and both odd, the number of self-intersections is given by:\")\n    print(\"N = (n*k - n - k + 1) / 2\")\n    print(f\"N = ({n}*{k} - {n} - {k} + 1) / 2\")\n    print(f\"N = ({n*k} - {n+k} + 1) / 2\")\n    print(f\"N = ({numerator_val}) / 2\")\n    print(f\"N = {int(num_intersections)}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
