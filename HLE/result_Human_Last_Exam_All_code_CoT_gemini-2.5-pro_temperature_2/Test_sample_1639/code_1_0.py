# Step 1: Calculate the mass of the itaconate adduct (C5H6O4) left after cleavage.
# The probe is derived from itaconic acid (C5H6O4) and propargylamine.
# After Michael addition and cleavage of the amide bond, the itaconate moiety remains.
num_C_adduct = 5
num_H_adduct = 6
num_O_adduct = 4

mass_itaconate_adduct = (num_C_adduct * C_mass) + (num_H_adduct * H_mass) + (num_O_adduct * O_mass)

# Step 2: Account for the additional mass modification.
# Formic acid can reduce the alkyne group on the probe before cleavage.
# The reduction of an alkyne (Câ‰¡C) to an alkane (CH2-CH2) adds 4 hydrogen atoms.
num_H_reduction = 4
mass_reduction = num_H_reduction * H_mass

# Step 3: Calculate the total variable modification mass (x).
# This is the sum of the itaconate adduct mass and the reduction mass.
total_modification_mass = mass_itaconate_adduct + mass_reduction

# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result
