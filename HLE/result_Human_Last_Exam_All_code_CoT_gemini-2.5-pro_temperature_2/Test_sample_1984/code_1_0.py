# Step 1: Determine the value of m.
# The equilibrium points are the roots of -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0, which are x=0 and x=1.
# The derivative f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 determines stability.
# At x=0, f'(0) = -1 < 0, so it's a stable point.
# At x=1, f'(1) = 0, which is inconclusive. A sign analysis shows it's a semi-stable point.
# Therefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is 1.
m = 1

# Step 2: Define the other numbers in the expression.
base = 2
exponent = 4048

# Step 3: Calculate the final result.
# Python's integers can handle arbitrary size, so we can compute this directly.
result = m - (base**exponent)

# Step 4: Print the final equation and its result.
# We explicitly show each number involved in the final equation.
