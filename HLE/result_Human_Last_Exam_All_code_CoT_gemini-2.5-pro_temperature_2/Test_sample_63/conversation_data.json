    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this. First, I will identify the person Kurt Vonnegut described as looking like a porcupine. This description comes from his book *A Man Without a Country*. The man in question is a famous composer. Second, I will confirm his name is two words and that both words start with the same letter. Finally, I will write a simple Python script to print his name as the answer.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the man Kurt Vonnegut described as looking like a porcupine.\n# The criteria are that his name is two words, both starting with the same letter.\n\n# Storing the first and last name in variables.\nfirst_name = \"Burt\"\nlast_name = \"Bacharach\"\n\n# Printing the full name to the console.\nprint(first_name + \" \" + last_name)\n```\n<<<Burt Bacharach>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    As Kurt Vonnegut noted, this man looks like a porcupine in all the pictures.
