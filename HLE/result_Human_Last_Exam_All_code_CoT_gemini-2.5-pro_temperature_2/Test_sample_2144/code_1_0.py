# Step 2: Determine the equation for the specific trajectory using a parameterization
# At the initial point (x=0, y=-1), we can find p=dy/dx from the ODE:
# p^3 + (-1)^2 = 0 * (-1) * p
# p^3 + 1 = 0  => p = -1

# Step 3: Solve for the final state
# We are looking for x0 where y(x0) is -3.
# The parameterization gives y = t^2(x-t).
# This creates a system of two equations for the final state (x0, t0):
# 1) (3*t0 - x0)(t0 - x0) = 3
# 2) t0^2 * (x0 - t0) = -3
# Solving this system leads to a polynomial equation for t0.
