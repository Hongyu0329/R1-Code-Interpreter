    # Step 1: Mathematical Formulation
    # A convex body K intersects the line px + qy = 1 if and only if the
    # line does not strictly separate K from the origin. This can be expressed
    # using the support function of K, h_K(n), where n = (p, q). The condition is:
    # -h_K(-p, -q) <= 1 <= h_K(p, q) for all coprime integer pairs (p, q).

    # Step 2: Simplification to an Origin-Symmetric Body
    # It can be shown that the optimal body K must have its SantalÃ³ point at the
    # origin. If not, its support function would have to be unbounded to satisfy
    # the condition for all coprime (p, q), leading to an infinite area.
    # For a body centered at the origin, it must be origin-symmetric to be optimal.
    # For an origin-symmetric body, h_K(-n) = h_K(n), which simplifies the condition to:
    # h_K(p, q) >= 1 for all coprime integers (p, q).

    # Step 3: Polar Duality
    # For an origin-symmetric convex body K, its polar dual K* is also origin-symmetric.
    # The condition h_K(p, q) >= 1 is equivalent to the geometric condition that
    # the interior of the polar body, int(K*), must not contain any primitive
    # integer point (p, q). Our goal is to minimize Area(K).

    # Step 4: Applying Mathematical Theorems
    # Mahler's inequality for 2D origin-symmetric convex bodies states:
    # Area(K) * Area(K*) >= 8.
    # Equality holds if K (and K*) is a parallelogram.
    # To minimize Area(K), we must maximize Area(K*).
    #
    # The problem thus reduces to finding the maximum area of an origin-symmetric
    # convex body K* whose interior contains no primitive lattice points. A result
    # from the Geometry of Numbers states that this maximum area is 4. This maximum
    # is achieved for the square K* = {(x, y) | |x| <= 1, |y| <= 1}.

    # Step 5: Calculation
    # We now have all the components for the final calculation.
    mahler_bound = 8
    max_area_K_star = 4
    
    # The minimal area of K is derived from Mahler's inequality by using the
    # maximum possible area for the polar body K*.
