    "This problem asks for the minimal area of a convex set `K` that intersects every line of the form `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. This is a classic problem in the field of geometry of numbers. Here is a plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Rephrase the condition mathematically:** We translate the geometric condition of intersecting lines into a condition on the support function of the convex set `K`.\n2.  **Simplify by centering:** We'll show that the optimal set must be centered at the origin. This makes the set origin-symmetric and simplifies the conditions on its support function.\n3.  **Use polar duality:** The properties of the set `K` can be described by properties of its polar dual, `K*`. Polar duality is a powerful tool that transforms geometric properties and is especially useful for problems involving areas and volumes.\n4.  **Apply known theorems:** The problem on the polar body `K*` is a known problem in the geometry of numbers. We can use Mahler's inequality, which provides a lower bound for the product of the areas of a set and its polar dual, `Area(K) * Area(K*)`.\n5.  **Calculate the final result:** By combining these results, we can calculate the minimal area for `K`. The final result will be derived from an equation involving these established mathematical constants and bounds.\n\nThe python code below carries out this plan and calculates the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_minimal_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines\n    px + qy = 1 for coprime integers p and q.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Mathematical Formulation\n    # A convex body K intersects the line px + qy = 1 if and only if the\n    # line does not strictly separate K from the origin. This can be expressed\n    # using the support function of K, h_K(n), where n = (p, q). The condition is:\n    # -h_K(-p, -q) <= 1 <= h_K(p, q) for all coprime integer pairs (p, q).\n\n    # Step 2: Simplification to an Origin-Symmetric Body\n    # It can be shown that the optimal body K must have its SantalÃ³ point at the\n    # origin. If not, its support function would have to be unbounded to satisfy\n    # the condition for all coprime (p, q), leading to an infinite area.\n    # For a body centered at the origin, it must be origin-symmetric to be optimal.\n    # For an origin-symmetric body, h_K(-n) = h_K(n), which simplifies the condition to:\n    # h_K(p, q) >= 1 for all coprime integers (p, q).\n\n    # Step 3: Polar Duality\n    # For an origin-symmetric convex body K, its polar dual K* is also origin-symmetric.\n    # The condition h_K(p, q) >= 1 is equivalent to the geometric condition that\n    # the interior of the polar body, int(K*), must not contain any primitive\n    # integer point (p, q). Our goal is to minimize Area(K).\n\n    # Step 4: Applying Mathematical Theorems\n    # Mahler's inequality for 2D origin-symmetric convex bodies states:\n    # Area(K) * Area(K*) >= 8.\n    # Equality holds if K (and K*) is a parallelogram.\n    # To minimize Area(K), we must maximize Area(K*).\n    #\n    # The problem thus reduces to finding the maximum area of an origin-symmetric\n    # convex body K* whose interior contains no primitive lattice points. A result\n    # from the Geometry of Numbers states that this maximum area is 4. This maximum\n    # is achieved for the square K* = {(x, y) | |x| <= 1, |y| <= 1}.\n\n    # Step 5: Calculation\n    # We now have all the components for the final calculation.\n    mahler_bound = 8\n    max_area_K_star = 4\n    \n    # The minimal area of K is derived from Mahler's inequality by using the\n    # maximum possible area for the polar body K*.\n    min_area_K = mahler_bound / max_area_K_star\n\n    print(\"The problem is to find the minimum Area(K).\")\n    print(\"From Mahler's inequality for origin-symmetric bodies: Area(K) * Area(K*) >= 8.\")\n    print(\"To minimize Area(K), we need to maximize Area(K*).\")\n    print(\"The maximum area of a symmetric convex body K* with no primitive integer points in its interior is 4.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"Minimal Area(K) = (Mahler's Bound for Parallelograms) / (Max Area(K*))\")\n    print(f\"Minimal Area(K) = {mahler_bound} / {max_area_K_star}\")\n    print(\"\\nResult:\")\n    print(f\"The minimal area is {min_area_K}.\")\n\nsolve_minimal_area()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
