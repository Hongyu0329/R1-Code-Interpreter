    "Of course. I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the memory usage for the most memory-efficient C program to solve this problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the task:** The goal is to compare two strings lexicographically while ignoring case. A standard approach would be to read both strings into two separate character arrays and then loop through them to compare.\n2.  **Optimize for Memory:** A more memory-efficient C program can avoid storing the second string entirely. We must read and store the first string. Then, we can read the second string one character at a time and compare it with the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n3.  **Identify Necessary Variables:** For this optimized approach in C, we need the following variables:\n    *   A character array to store the first string. The maximum length is 100, so we need a buffer of size 101 to account for the null terminator (`\\0`). Let's call it `s1`.\n    *   A loop counter to iterate through the string. An `int` variable is standard for this. Let's call it `i`.\n    *   A single `char` variable to hold the character currently being read from the second string. Let's call it `c2`.\n4.  **Calculate Memory Usage (m):** We'll calculate the total memory `m` by summing the sizes of these variables, assuming a common system architecture (like one used in competitive programming platforms) where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n5.  **Create a Python Script:** Finally, I will provide a Python script that programmatically calculates `m` based on this analysis and prints out the components of the final sum.\n\nHere is the Python script that performs the calculation.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the memory usage in bytes for the variables\n# in a memory-efficient C program designed to solve the problem.\n\n# 1. Memory for the first string's buffer.\n# The maximum string length is 100 characters. In C, we need an extra byte\n# for the null terminator '\\0'.\n# C declaration: char s1[101];\n# Size = 101 characters * 1 byte/character.\nsize_s1 = 101\n\n# 2. Memory for the loop counter variable.\n# A standard integer is used to iterate from the beginning to the end of the string.\n# C declaration: int i;\n# On most 32-bit and 64-bit systems, an int takes 4 bytes.\nsize_i = 4\n\n# 3. Memory for a single character from the second string.\n# We read the second string one character at a time to compare, so we only need to store one.\n# C declaration: char c2;\n# A char in C takes 1 byte.\nsize_c2 = 1\n\n# 4. Calculate the total memory 'm'.\nm = size_s1 + size_i + size_c2\n\n# Output the equation and the final result as requested.\nprint(f\"To solve the problem with minimal memory, we need variables for:\")\nprint(f\"- The first string buffer: {size_s1} bytes\")\nprint(f\"- The loop counter: {size_i} bytes\")\nprint(f\"- The character from the second string: {size_c2} bytes\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe final equation for total memory m is:\")\nprint(f\"{size_s1} + {size_i} + {size_c2} = {m}\")\n```\n<<<106>>>"
