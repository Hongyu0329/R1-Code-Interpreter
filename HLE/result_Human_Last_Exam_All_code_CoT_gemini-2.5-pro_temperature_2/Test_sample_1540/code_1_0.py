# This script calculates the memory usage in bytes for the variables
# in a memory-efficient C program designed to solve the problem.

# 1. Memory for the first string's buffer.
# The maximum string length is 100 characters. In C, we need an extra byte
# for the null terminator '\0'.
# C declaration: char s1[101];
# Size = 101 characters * 1 byte/character.
size_s1 = 101

# 2. Memory for the loop counter variable.
# A standard integer is used to iterate from the beginning to the end of the string.
# C declaration: int i;
# On most 32-bit and 64-bit systems, an int takes 4 bytes.
size_i = 4

# 3. Memory for a single character from the second string.
# We read the second string one character at a time to compare, so we only need to store one.
# C declaration: char c2;
# A char in C takes 1 byte.
size_c2 = 1

# 4. Calculate the total memory 'm'.
m = size_s1 + size_i + size_c2

# Output the equation and the final result as requested.
