    "My plan is to answer your question about Jacek Dukaj's novel, \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość.\" The question is a factual lookup, not a computational task. To comply with your request for a code-based solution, I will write a simple Python script. This script will store the character's name in a variable and then use the `print` function to display the name as the output.\n\n```python\n# The main character of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski.\n# He marries (or the post-human equivalent of it) a stahs,\n# which is a self-organizing swarm of intelligent matter.\n# This entity adopts a female persona and name.\n\n# Storing the name in a variable\ncharacter_name = \"Angelina\"\n\n# Printing the name\nprint(character_name)\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What's the name of the character that the main character of Jacek Duke's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonalość\" marries?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
