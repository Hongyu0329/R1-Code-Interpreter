    print("\nAnswer: Yes.")
    print("\nExplanation:")
    print("The quiver-Taft map sigma is defined based on a set of properties involving an action 'g'. In the problem statement, this action 'g' is explicitly defined as a reflection. The entire framework for sigma's existence and properties is built upon this premise. Therefore, the existence of a sigma map with the given properties inherently assumes that 'g' is a reflection.")

    print("Question: Provide a condition on d for which sigma(a) != 0 must hold for all a in Q_1.")
    
    print("\nDerivation:")
    print("1. Start with the given relation: sigma(g . a) = lambda^(-1) * g . sigma(a).")
    print("2. The action g . e_i = e_{n-d-i} implies g^2 . e_i = g . e_{n-d-i} = e_{n-d-(n-d-i)} = e_i. So, g^2 = id.")
    print("3. Applying the sigma relation twice: sigma(g^2 . a) = lambda^(-2) * g^2 . sigma(a).")
    print("4. Since g^2 = id, this becomes: sigma(a) = lambda^(-2) * sigma(a), which means (1 - lambda^(-2)) * sigma(a) = 0.")
    print("5. For sigma(a) to be potentially non-zero, we must have 1 - lambda^(-2) = 0, which yields lambda^2 = 1. So, lambda is either +1 or -1.")

    print("\n6. A contradiction will arise if for some arrow 'a', sigma(a) is forced to be 0. We analyze the more restrictive case, lambda = -1.")
    
    print("\n7. Consider an arrow 'a' that is a fixed point under g's action (i.e., g . a = a).")
    print("   - For an arrow 'a' from vertex i to vertex j, g . a goes from n-d-i to n-d-j.")
    print("   - For g . a = a, the start/end points must match: n-d-i = i and n-d-j = j.")
    print("   - This implies i = j and requires the satisfaction of the equation for the vertex i:")
    print("     2 * i = n - d")
    print("   - Thus, a fixed arrow must be a loop at a vertex 'i' that satisfies this equation.")

    print("\n8. If such a fixed loop 'a' exists at vertex i, let's analyze sigma(a) with lambda = -1:")
    print("   - The relation becomes sigma(g . a) = (-1) * g . sigma(a).")
    print("   - Since g . a = a, we have sigma(a) = -g . sigma(a), or g . sigma(a) = -sigma(a).")

    print("\n9. The map sigma preserves the endpoints, so sigma(a) is a linear combination of loops at vertex i.")
    print("   - Since 2 * i = n - d, the vertex i is a fixed point of g's action on vertices: g . e_i = e_i.")
    print("   - The action of g on any loop 'b' at a fixed vertex 'i' is the identity (g . b = b).")
    print("   - Therefore, g acts as the identity on sigma(a), meaning g . sigma(a) = sigma(a).")

    print("\n10. We have a contradiction:")
    print("    - From step 8: g . sigma(a) = -sigma(a)")
    print("    - From step 9: g . sigma(a) =  sigma(a)")
    print("    This implies sigma(a) = -sigma(a), so 2 * sigma(a) = 0.")
    print("    Assuming the field k does not have characteristic 2, this forces sigma(a) = 0.")
    
    print("\n11. This contradicts the requirement that sigma(a) must be non-zero for ALL arrows 'a'.")
    print("    To avoid this contradiction, we must prevent the existence of any g-fixed arrows.")
    print("    This is achieved by ensuring the equation '2 * i = n - d' has no integer solution for any vertex i.")

    print("\nFinal Condition:")
    print("Since 2 * i is always an even integer, the equation can be made impossible to satisfy if n - d is an odd integer.")
    print("Therefore, the condition on d is that n - d must be odd.")
