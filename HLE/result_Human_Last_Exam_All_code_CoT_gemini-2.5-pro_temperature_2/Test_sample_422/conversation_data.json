    "Of course, here is the explanation formatted as a Python script.\n\nMy plan is to first identify two core philosophical problems with the Justified True Belief (JTB) model of knowledge, setting aside the famous Gettier problems as requested.\n1.  **The Regress Problem of Justification**: I will focus on the \"J\" (Justification) component. The theory doesn't explain what makes a justification valid, leading to an infinite regress, circularity, or a halt at an unjustified, dogmatic belief (Agrippa's Trilemma).\n2.  **The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition**: I will focus on the \"T\" (Truth) component. This is an external condition about the state of the world that the believer cannot directly access. From the believer's perspective, a justified false belief can feel identical to a justified true belief, making it impossible for the person themselves to confirm they have \"Knowledge.\"\n\nI will then embed this explanation within a Python print function as requested by the prompt format.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the two primary problems with the JTB definition of knowledge,\n    ignoring Gettier problems, as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nIgnoring Gettier problems, the two main issues with the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge are the Regress Problem of Justification and the Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition.\n\n1. The Regress Problem of Justification\nThe \"Justified\" (J) component of JTB is not clearly defined. If a belief (P) must be justified, it is typically justified by another belief (Q). For the justification to be valid, the believer must also be justified in believing Q. This leads to a logical dilemma with three problematic outcomes:\n   - Infinite Regress: The chain of justifications (P is justified by Q, Q by R, R by S...) continues infinitely, meaning no belief is ever fully and finally justified.\n   - Circularity: The chain of justification eventually circles back on itself (e.g., P justifies Q, which in turn justifies P), resulting in a self-supporting but foundationless loop.\n   - Dogmatism: The chain of justifications stops at a foundational belief that is held without justification. If knowledge ultimately rests on an unjustified assumption, the entire claim to knowledge becomes weak.\n\n2. The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition\nThe \"True\" (T) component of JTB is a condition about objective reality, which is external to and inaccessible from the believer's mind. A person has access to their beliefs and their justifications, but they cannot step outside their own perspective to verify if their belief is actually true. From the believer's internal point of view, a strongly justified belief that is false feels identical to a strongly justified belief that is true (Knowledge). Because one cannot independently verify the \"truth\" of their own belief, the JTB definition works as an external checklist for a third-party observer but is not a practical tool for the individual trying to ascertain if they possess knowledge.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nexplain_jtb_problems()\n```\n<<<The two problems are the Regress Problem of Justification (justification can lead to an infinite regress, circularity, or dogmatism) and the Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition (a believer cannot internally verify if their belief is objectively true).>>>"
