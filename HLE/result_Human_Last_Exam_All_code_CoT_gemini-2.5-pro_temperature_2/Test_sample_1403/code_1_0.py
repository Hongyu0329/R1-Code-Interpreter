    # Total number of individuals
    num_individuals = 9

    # --- SCENARIO 1: Simultaneous Guessing (Finding N) ---
    #
    # The best strategy is to form pairs. There are two hat colors, let's call them 0 and 1.
    # Consider a pair of individuals, Person A and Person B.
    # Strategy for the pair:
    # - Person A guesses that Person B's hat color is the same as their own guess. So, A effectively guesses the color of B's hat.
    # - Person B guesses that Person A's hat color is the *opposite* of their own guess. So, B effectively guesses the opposite of A's hat color.
    #
    # Let's check the outcomes:
    # 1. If A and B have the same color hat: A's guess is correct, B's is incorrect. (1 correct)
    # 2. If A and B have different color hats: A's guess is incorrect, B's is correct. (1 correct)
    # In both cases, exactly one person in the pair is guaranteed to be correct.
    #
    # We can form floor(9 / 2) = 4 such pairs.
    num_pairs = num_individuals // 2
    guaranteed_correct_from_pairs = num_pairs

    # The 9th person is not in a pair. Their guess depends only on the 8 hats they see.
    # For any guessing strategy they devise, there is a possible color for their own hat that
    # makes their guess incorrect. So, their guaranteed number of correct guesses is 0.
    guaranteed_correct_from_remainder = 0
    
    # N is the total number of guaranteed correct guesses.
    N = guaranteed_correct_from_pairs + guaranteed_correct_from_remainder


    # --- SCENARIO 2: One Person Guesses First (Finding M) ---
    #
    # One person (the "leader") guesses first, and the other 8 ("the team") listen.
    # The leader's guess can convey one bit of information.
    #
    # Strategy:
    # 1. The leader looks at the 8 hats of the team members.
    # 2. The leader calculates the "parity" of these hats (e.g., let Black&Yellow=0, Blue&White=1, the sum modulo 2).
    # 3. The leader's guess for their own hat *is* this calculated parity.
    # 4. Each of the 8 team members hears the leader's guess (which is the parity of their group).
    # 5. Each team member can see the other 7 team members' hats. By calculating the parity of the 7 hats they see,
    #    and comparing it to the total parity announced by the leader, they can deduce their own hat color with 100% certainty.
    #
    # This means all 8 team members will guess correctly.
    guaranteed_correct_from_team = num_individuals - 1

    # The leader's guess for their own hat is not guaranteed. It will be correct about 50% of the time.
    # However, the question asks for the number of people who will *definitely* guess correctly.
    # In the worst case, the leader is wrong, but the other 8 are correct.
    
    # M is the total number of guaranteed correct guesses in this scenario.
    M = guaranteed_correct_from_team

    # --- FINAL CALCULATION ---
    # The question asks for how many more people will definitely guess correctly (M - N).
    difference = M - N

    print(f"For simultaneous guessing, the maximum number of guaranteed correct guesses is N = {N}.")
    print(f"When one person guesses first, the number of guaranteed correct guesses is M = {M}.")
