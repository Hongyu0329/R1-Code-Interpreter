    "To find the probability that the particle is located in a specific interval, we need to integrate the probability density function, |Ψ(x)|², over that interval.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Wavefunction (Ψ):** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' for a quantum state 'n' is:\n    Ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)\n\n2.  **Probability Density (|Ψ|²):** The probability density is the square of the wavefunction. For n=2, this is:\n    |Ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)\n\n3.  **Probability Integral:** The probability (P) of finding the particle between x₁ = 0.495a and x₂ = 0.505a is the definite integral of the probability density function over this interval:\n    P = ∫ (from 0.495a to 0.505a) (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx\n\n4.  **Numerical Calculation:** We will use a Python script with the SciPy library to numerically solve this integral. For the calculation, we can set the box length `a = 1.0` as it simplifies the expression without affecting the final probability value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import integrate\n\ndef solve_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box in a given interval.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters for the problem\n    n = 2  # Quantum number\n    # We can set the box length 'a' to 1.0, as it will cancel out mathematically.\n    a = 1.0\n    x1 = 0.495 * a\n    x2 = 0.505 * a\n\n    # Define the probability density function, |Ψ(x)|², for the particle in a 1D box.\n    def probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n        \"\"\"\n        The function to be integrated: (2/a) * sin^2(n*pi*x/a).\n        \"\"\"\n        return (2 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n    # Perform the numerical integration using scipy.integrate.quad\n    # quad returns the integral result and an estimated error.\n    probability, _ = integrate.quad(\n        probability_density,\n        x1,\n        x2,\n        args=(n, a)\n    )\n\n    # Print the equation being solved, with all numbers included\n    print(\"The probability (P) is found by solving the following integral:\")\n    print(f\"P = integral from {x1:.3f} to {x2:.3f} of (2/{a:.1f}) * sin^2({n}*pi*x/{a:.1f}) dx\")\n    \n    # Print the final result\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated probability is: {probability}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_probability()\n\n```\n<<<0.0003289868202453535>>>"
