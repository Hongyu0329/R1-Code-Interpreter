    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic problem in Fourier analysis. The answer is yes, the function must be zero. The proof relies on the properties of the Fourier transform.\n\nHere is the plan for the solution:\n1.  I will outline the mathematical proof that leads to the conclusion. The argument connects the moments of a function to the derivatives of its Fourier transform at the origin.\n2.  The steps of the proof are:\n    a. The n-th derivative of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ evaluated at $\\xi=0$ is proportional to the n-th moment of the function $f(x)$, which is $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^n f(x) \\, dx$.\n    b. The condition that all moments are zero ($\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$) implies that all derivatives of the Fourier transform at the origin, $\\hat{f}^{(n)}(0)$, must also be zero.\n    c. For a Schwartz class function, its Fourier transform is analytic. An analytic function is entirely determined by its derivatives at a single point.\n    d. Since all derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at $\\xi=0$ are zero, its Taylor series expansion around zero is identically zero. As $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is analytic, it must be zero everywhere.\n    e. Finally, the Fourier transform is invertible. If $\\hat{f}(\\xi)=0$ for all $\\xi$, then the original function $f(x)$ must be zero everywhere.\n3.  I will provide a Python script that presents this argument in a structured way and prints the final conclusion, `f(x) = 0`, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the question: If a Schwartz function f has all its moments\n    (integral of x^k * f(x)) equal to zero for all k, does it imply f=0?\n\n    The function explains the reasoning step-by-step and prints the conclusion.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The question is: If f is a Schwartz function and integral(x^k * f(x) dx) = 0 for all k in {0, 1, 2, ...}, does it follow that f(x) = 0?\")\n    print(\"The answer is YES.
