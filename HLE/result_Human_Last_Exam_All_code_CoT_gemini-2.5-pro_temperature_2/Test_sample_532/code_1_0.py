    explanation = [
        "Step 1: Understand the core definitions.",
        "  - Product-Free Set (S): A subset of a group G where for all a, b in S, the product a*b is not in S.",
        "  - Maximal Product-Free Set (M): A product-free set that cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group.",
        "  - Filled Group (G): A group G where the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to G.",
        "  - Finite Nilpotent Group: A finite group that is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.",

        "\nStep 2: Use the primary characterization theorem for filled groups.",
        "  A key theorem by Belyaev and Chueshev provides the conditions for a group to be filled:",
        "  'A finite group G is filled if and only if G has an odd order AND every non-identity element g is conjugate to its inverse g⁻¹.'",

        "\nStep 3: Apply the theorem to the case of a finite nilpotent group.",
        "  Let G be a finite filled nilpotent group. From the theorem, we know two things about G:",
        "  a) The order of G, |G|, must be odd.",
        "  b) Every element g in G (where g is not the identity) must be conjugate to its inverse.",

        "\nStep 4: Analyze the implications for the structure of G.",
        "  - Since G is nilpotent, G can be written as the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups: G = P₁ × P₂ × ... × Pₖ.",
        "  - The condition that |G| is odd means that each p-subgroup Pᵢ is a pᵢ-group for an ODD prime pᵢ.",
        "  - The property that every element is conjugate to its inverse must also hold for each component Sylow p-subgroup Pᵢ.",

        "\nStep 5: Apply a known result about p-groups.",
        "  There is a theorem (from Chillag and Mann) on p-groups where every element is conjugate to its inverse (a 'real' p-group). It states:",
        "  'A p-group P is real if and only if it is an elementary abelian 2-group.'",
        "  - However, our Sylow subgroups Pᵢ are pᵢ-groups for ODD primes. A group cannot be both an odd p-group and a 2-group unless it is the trivial group {e} of order 1.",
        "  - Therefore, each Sylow subgroup Pᵢ of G must be the trivial group.",

        "\nStep 6: Conclude the structure of G.",
        "  - If all Sylow subgroups of G are trivial, then G itself must be the trivial group, G = {e}.",
        "  - This implies that if a finite filled nilpotent group exists, it can only be the trivial group.",

        "\nStep 7: Final verification of the trivial group.",
        "  - We must check if G = {e} is filled by its original definition.",
        "  - The only product-free subset of {e} is the empty set ∅.",
        "  - The empty set is also maximal in {e}, because adding the only other element 'e' makes the new set {e} not product-free (since e*e=e).",
        "  - The union of all maximal product-free sets is therefore ∅.",
        "  - Since ∅ is not equal to G = {e}, the trivial group is NOT a filled group.",
        
        "\nStep 8: Reach the final conclusion.",
        "  - Our reasoning shows that any finite filled nilpotent group must be the trivial group.",
        "  - However, the trivial group itself is not a filled group.",
        "  - This is a contradiction, which means the initial assumption that such a group exists must be false."
