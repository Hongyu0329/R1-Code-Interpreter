# Parameters for the problem
m = 23
n = 37

# The number of adjunctions is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+m, m)
# or equivalently C(n+m, n).
# This is derived from counting order-preserving maps f:[m]->[n] with f(0)=0.
# The number of items to choose (k) is m=23.
# The number of options to choose from (N) is the size of {0, ..., n}, which is n+1=38.
# The formula is C(N+k-1, k) = C(38+23-1, 23) = C(60, 23).
n_comb = n + m
k_comb = m

# Calculate the binomial coefficient C(60, 23)
result = math.comb(n_comb, k_comb)

# Print the final result, including the numbers used in the final equation.
