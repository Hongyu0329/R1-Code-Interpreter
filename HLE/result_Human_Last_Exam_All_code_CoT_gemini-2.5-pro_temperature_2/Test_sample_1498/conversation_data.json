    "In the famous Islamic poem on creed, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam (The Creed of the Laymen)' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the section detailing the 25 prophets one must know by name is found in a specific sequence of verses (bayts).\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to identify these verses:\n1.  First, I will locate a standard numbered version of the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'.\n2.  Next, I will find the verse that introduces the list of prophets. This verse states that knowing the details of twenty-five prophets is a requirement. This is generally Bayt 18.\n3.  The actual enumeration of the prophets' names begins in the subsequent verse. I will identify this starting verse number.\n4.  I will then follow the list of names through the poem until the last prophet is mentioned to find the ending verse number.\n5.  Finally, the Python code will display this information, including the Arabic text of the verses and the starting and ending bayt numbers that constitute the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses_in_aqeedah():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the range of verses (bayts) in the poem\n    'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    start_bayt = 19\n    end_bayt = 22\n    \n    print(\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the prophets are mentioned in a sequence of four verses (bayts).\")\n    print(\"The listing begins at bayt number 19 and concludes at bayt number 22.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- The Verses Listing the Prophets ---\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Bayt {start_bayt}:\")\n    print(\"هُمْ آدَمٌ اِدْرِيْسٌ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ  **  صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\")\n    print(\"(Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim; each to be followed)\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Bayt {start_bayt + 1}:\")\n    print(\"لُوْطٌ وَاِسْمَاعِيْلُ اِسْحَاقُ كَذَا  **  يَعْقُوْبُ يُوْسُفُ وَأَيُّوْبُ احْتَذَى\")\n    print(\"(Lut, Isma'il, and Ishaq as well; Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed their path)\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Bayt {start_bayt + 2}:\")\n    print(\"شُعَيْبُ هَارُوْنُ وَمُوْسَى وَالْيَسَعْ  **  ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\")\n    print(\"(Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, and al-Yasa'; Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman followed suit)\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Bayt {end_bayt}:\")\n    print(\"اِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى  **  عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\")\n    print(\"(Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya; 'Isa and Taha (Muhammad), the seal; leave misguidance)\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"---------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the names of the prophets are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n    \n# Execute the function\nfind_prophet_verses_in_aqeedah()\n\n```\n<<<From bayt 19 to bayt 22>>>"
