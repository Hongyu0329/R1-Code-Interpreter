    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the 3x3 matrix provided. The name \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is the specific name for the given matrix A. The value \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) is contextual information that does not alter the matrix itself, which is explicitly defined. Therefore, the task simplifies to a direct computation of the determinant of A.\n\nI will use the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\nFor a matrix\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \na & b & c \\\\ \nd & e & f \\\\ \ng & h & i \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nthe determinant is calculated as \\( \\det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\).\n\nI will write a Python script that follows these steps:\n1.  Define the matrix A.\n2.  Extract the elements a, b, c, ..., i.\n3.  Print the calculation process step-by-step, showing how the numbers from the matrix are substituted into the formula.\n4.  Show the simplified intermediate calculations.\n5.  Finally, print the final equation and the resulting determinant value. This will fulfill the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_determinant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix and displays the step-by-step calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given matrix from the problem description\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The task is to compute the determinant of the matrix A:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Extracting elements for the determinant formula for a 3x3 matrix:\n    # det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Substitute the matrix values into the determinant formula.\")\n    print(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n    equation_str = f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\"\n    print(equation_str)\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Calculate the values inside the parentheses (the minors' determinants)\n    minor1 = e * i - f * h\n    minor2 = d * i - f * g\n    minor3 = d * h - e * g\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Simplify the expressions inside the parentheses.\")\n    simplified_str = f\"det(A) = ({a}) * ({minor1}) - ({b}) * ({minor2}) + ({c}) * ({minor3})\"\n    print(simplified_str)\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Calculate the product of the terms\n    term1 = a * minor1\n    term2_prod = b * minor2\n    term3_prod = c * minor3\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the products.\")\n    product_str = f\"det(A) = {term1} - ({term2_prod}) + ({term3_prod})\"\n    print(product_str)\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    # Final calculation by summing the terms\n    determinant = term1 - term2_prod + term3_prod\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Perform the final addition and subtraction to get the result.\")\n    final_equation_str = f\"det(A) = {term1} - {term2_prod} + {term3_prod} = {determinant}\"\n    print(final_equation_str)\n    print(f\"\\nThe determinant of the matrix is {determinant}.\")\n\ncompute_determinant()\n<<<0>>>"
