    "My plan is to find the plot summary of the 1997 movie *Ovosodo*. I will search for information specifically about the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, and his journey to the United States to identify the city he moves to. Once I have found the city, I will create a Python script that stores the name of the city in a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\n```python\n# The movie in question is \"Ovosodo\" (1997).\n# The character is Tommaso, a friend of the protagonist.\n# The destination is a major US city.\n\nus_city = \"New York City\"\n\nprint(\"In the movie 'Ovosodo', the character Tommaso moves to the following US city:\")\nprint(us_city)\n```\n<<<New York City>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In the 1997 movie Ovosodo (Hard Boiled Egg), Tommaso – played by Marco Cocci – moves to the United States.
