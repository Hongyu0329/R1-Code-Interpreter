    Analyzes five statements about the set L = {(x,y) in R^2 : y = |x|}

    print("L is a V-shaped curve in the plane. Topologically, it is homeomorphic to the real line R via the map h(t) = (t, |t|).")
    print("The key feature is the 'corner' at the origin (0,0), which means L is not a regular (or embedded) smooth submanifold of R^2.\n")

    print("--- Evaluating Statement A ---")
    print("A. L can be given the structure of an immersed submanifold of R^2 with boundary.")
    print("An immersed submanifold is the image of an immersion (a smooth map with an everywhere-injective derivative).")
    print("We can construct L from a 1-dimensional manifold M with a boundary. Let M be the disjoint union of two copies of the half-line [0, infinity).")
    print("Define a map f: M -> R^2 where one half-line maps as t -> (t,t) and the other as t -> (-t,t).")
    print("This map is smooth and its derivative is never zero, so it is an immersion. It is also injective.")
    print("The image of f is L. Thus, L is the image of an injective immersion from a manifold with boundary.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement A is TRUE.\n")

    print("--- Evaluating Statement B ---")
    print("B. There exists a smooth curve gamma: R -> R^2 such that gamma(R) = L.")
    print("This requires finding a smooth map gamma(t) = (x(t), |x(t)|) whose image is L.")
    print("This is possible if x(t) is a smooth function from R to R that covers the entire real line and has a 'zero of infinite order' where it passes through 0 (meaning x(t) and all its derivatives are zero at that point).")
    print("Such a function x(t) can be constructed, and for this function, |x(t)| is also smooth.")
    print("Therefore, a smooth curve parametrizing L exists.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement B is TRUE.\n")

    print("--- Evaluating Statement C ---")
    print("C. L can be given a smooth structure so that it is diffeomorphic to S^n for any n in N.")
    print("For two manifolds to be diffeomorphic, they must first be homeomorphic (topologically equivalent).")
    print("The set L has the topology of the real line R. The n-sphere S^n is compact for any n >= 1, while R is non-compact.")
    print("Since compactness is preserved by homeomorphism, L cannot be homeomorphic to S^n.")
    print("Additionally, for n > 1, the dimension of S^n is n, while L is 1-dimensional. A diffeomorphism preserves dimension.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement C is FALSE.\n")

    print("--- Evaluating Statement D ---")
    print("D. L can be given a smooth structure so it is diffeomorphic to a Lie group.")
    print("Since L is homeomorphic to R, we can give L the smooth manifold structure of R.")
    print("With this structure, L becomes diffeomorphic to R by definition.")
    print("The real line R, with the group operation of addition, is a fundamental example of a Lie group.")
    print("Thus, L can be given a smooth structure making it diffeomorphic to a Lie group (namely R).")
    print("Conclusion: Statement D is TRUE.\n")

    print("--- Evaluating Statement E ---")
    print("E. There exists a unique z in L such that L \\ {z} can be given the structure of a smooth manifold.")
    print("This statement becomes clear if 'can be given the structure of a smooth manifold' is interpreted in the context of the ambient space R^2, i.e., as 'is a regular submanifold of R^2'.")
    print("If we take z = (0,0), the set L \\ {z} consists of two disjoint open rays: {(x,x) : x > 0} and {(x,-x) : x < 0}. This set IS a regular submanifold of R^2.")
    print("If we take any other point z != (0,0), the set L \\ {z} still contains the corner at the origin, which prevents it from being a regular submanifold of R^2.")
    print("Therefore, z = (0,0) is the unique point with this property under this standard interpretation.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement E is TRUE.\n")
