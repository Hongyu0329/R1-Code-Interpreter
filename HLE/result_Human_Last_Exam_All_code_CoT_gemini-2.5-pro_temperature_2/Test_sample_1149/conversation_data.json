    "Based on paleontological sources, the skull of *Irritator challengeri* possesses two depressions in the area of the lacrimal recess. These are often identified as two separate accessory fossae.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that reflects this by:\n1.  Assigning the count of each depression to a separate variable.\n2.  Summing these variables to find the total.\n3.  Printing the calculation and the final result in a descriptive sentence, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The Irritator challengeri skull features two distinct depressions near the lacrimal recess.\n# We will represent the count of each depression in a variable.\nanterior_depression_count = 1\nposterior_depression_count = 1\n\n# Calculate the total by summing the individual counts.\ntotal_depressions = anterior_depression_count + posterior_depression_count\n\n# Display the calculation and the final answer.\nprint(\"To find the total number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri, we sum the counts of the identified fossae.\")\nprint(f\"Equation: {anterior_depression_count} + {posterior_depression_count} = {total_depressions}\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {total_depressions} depressions.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
