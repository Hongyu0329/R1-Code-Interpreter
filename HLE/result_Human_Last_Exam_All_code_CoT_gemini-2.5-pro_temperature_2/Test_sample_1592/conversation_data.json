    "To determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec (outside of Quebec), I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Coordinates**: First, I'll find the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the Waskaganish gathering place.\n2.  **Identify Neighboring Regions**: I will identify the provinces and territories that share a border with Quebec: Ontario, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut.\n3.  **Find Closest Points**: For each neighboring province/territory, I'll identify a representative location that is geographically close to Waskaganish.\n    *   **Ontario**: The town of Moosonee is located just across James Bay from Waskaganish.\n    *   **Nunavut**: The islands in James Bay, such as Akimiski Island, belong to Nunavut and are also close.\n    *   **Newfoundland and Labrador**: The closest point is in Labrador, represented by Labrador City.\n    *   **New Brunswick**: A border town like Edmundston will serve as a representative point.\n4.  **Calculate Distances**: Using the Haversine formula, which calculates the great-circle distance between two points on a sphere, I will compute the distance from Waskaganish to each of the representative locations.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**: By comparing the calculated distances, I will find the minimum distance and identify the corresponding province or territory as the closest.\n\nI will use a Python script to perform these calculations accurately.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef haversine_distance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the great-circle distance in kilometers between two points\n    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert decimal degrees to radians\n    lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2 = map(math.radians, [lon1, lat1, lon2, lat2])\n\n    # Haversine formula\n    dlon = lon2 - lon1\n    dlat = lat2 - lat1\n    a = math.sin(dlat / 2)**2 + math.cos(lat1) * math.cos(lat2) * math.sin(dlon / 2)**2\n    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a))\n    r = 6371  # Radius of Earth in kilometers\n    return c * r\n\n# Coordinates for the Waskaganish gathering place in Quebec\nwaskaganish_coords = (51.49, -78.76)\nwaskaganish_name = \"Waskaganish, QC\"\n\n# Representative coordinates for nearby locations in other provinces/territories\nlocations = {\n    \"Ontario\": (\"Moosonee, ON\", (51.27, -80.64)),\n    \"Nunavut\": (\"Akimiski Island, NU\", (53.00, -81.33)),\n    \"Newfoundland and Labrador\": (\"Labrador City, NL\", (52.94, -66.91)),\n    \"New Brunswick\": (\"Edmundston, NB\", (47.37, -68.32))\n}\n\nprint(f\"Calculating distances from {waskaganish_name} ({waskaganish_coords[0]}° N, {abs(waskaganish_coords[1])}° W)\\n\")\n\ndistances = {}\nfor province, (location_name, coords) in locations.items():\n    distance = haversine_distance(waskaganish_coords[0], waskaganish_coords[1], coords[0], coords[1])\n    distances[province] = distance\n    print(f\"Distance to {location_name}: {distance:.2f} km\")\n\n# Find the closest province/territory\nclosest_province = min(distances, key=distances.get)\nmin_distance = distances[closest_province]\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is {closest_province}.\")\nprint(f\"The approximate distance to its border area is {min_distance:.2f} km.\")\n<<<Ontario>>>"
