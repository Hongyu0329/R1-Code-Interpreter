    "Pavel Milyukov, a significant political figure in late Tsarist Russia, was also a cultural conservative. He viewed the emerging avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century as a sign of cultural decay and decadence in the West.\n\nIn a famous 1912 public lecture, he railed against the art of the \"Jack of Diamonds\" (Бубновый валет) group, which included artists who would be central to the Russian Futurist and Cubo-Futurist movements. He derisively labeled this new art a \"stagnant swamp.\" Therefore, \"X-Ys\" refers to the artists of this movement.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to present the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_milyukov_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the term \"X-Ys\" that Pavel Milyukov denounced.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Pavel Milyukov was a critic of modern art movements in the early 20th century.\n    # The term \"X-Ys\" in the question refers to the artists of a specific avant-garde movement.\n    target_of_criticism = \"Cubo-Futurists\"\n    \n    # Construct the full sentence to provide context.\n    denouncement_sentence = f\"Pavel Milyukov frequently accused the Western culture of his time and even denounced {target_of_criticism} as a 'stagnant swamp'.\"\n    \n    print(denouncement_sentence)\n    print(f\"\\nWhat is X-Y?
