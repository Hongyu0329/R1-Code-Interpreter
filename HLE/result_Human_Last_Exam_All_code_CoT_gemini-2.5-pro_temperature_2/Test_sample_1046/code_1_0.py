    print("Step 1: Understand the core paradox.")
    print("The problem states that a bacterium evolving 'slowly' via mutation keeps pace with one evolving 'quickly' via Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT). We need to find a mechanism that makes the 'slow' path exceptionally efficient.\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the components of the most comprehensive answer (B).")
    print("Answer B includes three key concepts that, when combined, solve the paradox:\n")
    
    print("  a) Rare Resistance Mutation: This is the starting point for the stable-genome bacterium. A random mutation occurs that confers resistance to a drug.")
    
    print("  b) Compensatory Mutations: Resistance often comes with a fitness cost (e.g., slower growth). Compensatory mutations are subsequent mutations that alleviate this cost, allowing the new resistant strain to compete effectively and spread rapidly through the population.")

    print("  c) Cross-Resistance: This is the critical factor for matching the *pace*. Cross-resistance means a single mutation provides resistance to multiple, different drugs. This makes one rare event extremely powerful, providing a similar advantage to acquiring multiple separate resistance genes via LGT.")

    print("\nStep 3: Evaluate why other options are less likely.")
    print(" - A is too simple; 'rare mutations' alone don't explain the rapid pace.")
    print(" - C dismisses the biological question by assuming an error.")
    print(" - D and E are incomplete. They lack either compensatory mutations (making spread difficult due to fitness cost) or cross-resistance (failing to explain the accelerated pace).\n")

    print("Conclusion: The combination of compensatory mutations (for spread) and cross-resistance (for pace) makes option B the best explanation for how rare mutational events can lead to rapid acquisition of a drug-resistant phenotype, rivaling the speed of LGT.")
