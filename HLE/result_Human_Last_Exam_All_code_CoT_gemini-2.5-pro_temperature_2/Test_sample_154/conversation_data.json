    "To solve this problem, I will use Python and the `networkx` library, which is a powerful tool for graph analysis. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Goal**: Find the number of simple, non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n2.  **Method**: I will programmatically check every non-isomorphic graph with 5 vertices and count how many of them meet the connectivity criteria.\n3.  **Tool**: The `networkx` library has a built-in collection of all small simple graphs called the \"graph atlas\". I will use this as my source of graphs to check.\n4.  **Algorithm**:\n    *   Iterate through each graph (`G`) provided by the `networkx.graph_atlas_g()` function.\n    *   For each graph, first check if it has exactly 5 vertices.\n    *   If it does, check if it's 2-vertex-connected. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex.\n    *   To test this, I'll first ensure the graph is connected using `nx.is_connected(G)`. A disconnected graph cannot be 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   If it is connected, I will then use `nx.vertex_connectivity(G)` to find the minimum number of vertices that must be removed to disconnect it.\n    *   If this connectivity value is 2 or greater, the graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   I will keep a running count of all graphs that satisfy these conditions.\n5.  **Output**: The final code will print the total count. The \"equation\" mentioned in the prompt instructions is interpreted here as showing the inputs (5 vertices) and the final calculated result.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef solve_graph_counting():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices we are interested in.\n    num_vertices = 5\n    \n    # A counter for the graphs that match our criteria.\n    biconnected_count = 0\n\n    # The networkx.graph_atlas_g() function provides a list of all nonisomorphic simple\n    # graphs for small numbers of vertices (up to 7). We will search this list.\n    all_small_graphs = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n\n    # Iterate through each graph in the atlas.\n    for G in all_small_graphs:\n    \n        # We only care about graphs with exactly num_vertices vertices.\n        if G.number_of_nodes() == num_vertices:\n        \n            # A graph must be connected to be 2-vertex-connected.\n            # The nx.vertex_connectivity function also requires a connected graph as input.\n            if nx.is_connected(G):\n            \n                # A graph is 2-vertex-connected if its vertex connectivity is 2 or greater.\n                # This means removing any single vertex will not disconnect the graph.\n                if nx.vertex_connectivity(G) >= 2:\n                    biconnected_count += 1\n    \n    # The problem asks for a count of graphs with 5 vertices. The numbers in this \"equation\"\n    # are the number of vertices (5) and the final count.\n    print(f\"Number of vertices = {num_vertices}\")\n    print(f\"Number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs = {biconnected_count}\")\n\n# Run the function to get the answer.\nsolve_graph_counting()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
