# The following code prints the list of answers to the 9 questions.
# The answers are derived from the step-by-step reasoning provided above.

# Question (1): cd(H)
ans1 = "∞"
# Question (2): cd(G)
ans2 = "∞"
# Question (3): vcd(H)
ans3 = 1
# Question (4): vcd(G)
ans4 = 1
# Question (5): ends of H
ans5 = 2
# Question (6): ends of G
ans6 = "∞"
# Question (7): cd_p(P)
ans7 = 0
# Question (8): vcd_p(P)
ans8 = 0
# Question (9): dim H^1(G, F_p)
ans9 = 0

# Combine all answers into a single list
all_answers = [ans1, ans2, ans3, ans4, ans5, ans6, ans7, ans8, ans9]

# Format the list into a comma-separated string for printing
output_string = ", ".join(map(str, all_answers))

print(output_string)
