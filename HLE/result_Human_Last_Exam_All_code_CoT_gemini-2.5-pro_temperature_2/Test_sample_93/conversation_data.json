    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  The problem asks for the number of non-negative integer solutions $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ to the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$. The order of elements in the tuple matters, so $(a, b, c, d, e)$ is a different solution from $(b, a, c, d, e)$ if $a \\neq b$.\n\n2.  A brute-force approach iterating through all possible values for each of the five variables would be too slow. The maximum value for any $x_i$ is $\\lfloor\\sqrt{2024}\\rfloor = 44$. A search space of $45^5$ is too large.\n\n3.  A more efficient method is to first find the unique sets of five non-negative integers $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ (as multisets) that satisfy the equation. For example, if we find that $\\{2, 2, 4, 8, 44\\}$ is a valid set, we then calculate how many distinct ordered tuples can be formed by permuting these numbers.\n\n4.  To find these unordered sets, I will write a Python script that iterates through all combinations of 5 numbers from the range $[0, 44]$ with replacement. The `itertools.combinations_with_replacement` function is perfect for this, as it is efficient and avoids duplicate sets.\n\n5.  For each combination (which is a sorted tuple), I will check if the sum of the squares of its elements equals 2024.\n\n6.  For every valid set of numbers found, I will calculate the number of distinct permutations. The formula for permutations of a multiset is $N! / (n_1! n_2! \\dots n_k!)$, where $N$ is the total number of items (5 in our case), and $n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k$ are the counts of each distinct item in the set. For instance, for the set $\\{2, 2, 4, 8, 44\\}$, the number of permutations is $5! / (2! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1! \\cdot 1!) = 120 / 2 = 60$.\n\n7.  The script will print each unique solution set, show how the numbers form the sum, and state the number of permutations for that set.\n\n8.  Finally, the script will sum up the permutation counts for all unique sets found to get the total number of solutions to the Diophantine equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_diophantine_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n    x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024\n    \"\"\"\n\n    target = 2024\n    # The maximum possible value for any x_i is floor(sqrt(2024)) = 44\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(target))\n    \n    ordered_solution_sets = []\n\n    # We generate combinations of 5 numbers from 0 to 44 with replacement.\n    # This ensures that we find all unique sets of numbers {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5}\n    # where the order doesn't matter yet, and repetitions are allowed.\n    # `itertools.combinations_with_replacement` generates them in sorted (non-decreasing) order.\n    possible_values = range(limit + 1)\n    \n    for combo in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(possible_values, 5):\n        current_sum_sq = sum(x*x for x in combo)\n        if current_sum_sq == target:\n            # We found a set of numbers that works.\n            # Store it as a tuple in our list of solutions.\n            ordered_solution_sets.append(combo)\n\n    # Now, for each unique set of solutions, we calculate the number of distinct\n    # permutations.
