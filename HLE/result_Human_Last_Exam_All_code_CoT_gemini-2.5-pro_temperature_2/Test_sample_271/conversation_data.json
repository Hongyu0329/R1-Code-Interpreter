    "Answering your question requires a multi-step analysis using Galois theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Factor the Polynomial:** First, I will factor the given polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ into irreducible polynomials over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. A good starting point is to test for simple algebraic roots, like $\\sqrt{2}$.\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group:** For each irreducible factor, I'll determine the Galois group of its splitting field over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group of the splitting field $K$ of the original polynomial $f(x)$ will be the direct product of the Galois groups of its factors, provided their splitting fields are disjoint except for $\\mathbb{Q}$. I will verify this condition by checking the discriminants of the polynomials.\n3.  **Identify Normal Subgroups:** According to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset L \\subset K$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, where $H$ is neither the trivial group nor the full group $G$.\n4.  **Calculate Degrees:** The degree of each such normal extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is equal to the index of the corresponding normal subgroup, $[G:H] = |G|/|H|$. I will list all such possible indices.\n\nExecuting this plan reveals the possible degrees. Below is the Python code that automates this process.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_possible_degrees():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by following the planned steps:\n    1.
