    "This is a problem of mathematical classification in the field of topology. A full classification of homogeneous planar continua was a significant result of 20th-century mathematics, with major contributions from mathematicians like R. H. Bing. A homogeneous space is one that \"looks the same\" from every point. A planar continuum is a compact, connected set that can be drawn in a plane.\n\nThe task is to count the number of unique types (homeomorphism classes) of these mathematical objects. Based on established theorems, there is a finite and well-known list.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to:\n1.  List the names of the distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua as strings.\n2.  Count the number of items in this list.\n3.  Print each class and then display the total number by formatting it as a simple sum, fulfilling the request to show the numbers in an equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# A full classification of homogeneous planar continua reveals a small, finite number of such spaces.\n# This script lists these classes and counts them.\n\n# 1. Define the known homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n#    These are the Point, the Circle, the Pseudo-arc, and the Circle of pseudo-arcs.\n#    Each represents one unique class.\nclasses = {\n    \"The Point\": 1,\n    \"The Circle\": 1,\n    \"The Pseudo-arc\": 1,\n    \"The Circle of pseudo-arcs\": 1\n}\n\n# 2. Print the name of each class.\nprint(\"The distinct homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua are:\")\nfor name in classes:\n    print(f\"- {name}\")\n\n# 3. To find the total number, we can sum the counts (1 for each class).\ntotal_classes = sum(classes.values())\n\n# 4. Display the calculation as a sum, showing each number in the final equation.\n#    Create a string like \"1 + 1 + 1 + 1\".\nsum_expression = \" + \".join([str(v) for v in classes.values()])\n\nprint(\"\\nThe total number is the sum of one for each class:\")\nprint(f\"{sum_expression} = {total_classes}\")\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many homeomorphism classes are there of homogeneous planar continua?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
