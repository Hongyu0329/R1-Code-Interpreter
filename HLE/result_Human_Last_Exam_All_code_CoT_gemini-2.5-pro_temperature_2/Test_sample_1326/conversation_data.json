    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 4$.\n\nFirst, we must split the integral into two parts, because the definition of the function $p(x)$ changes at $x = 3$.\n\nThe total integral is:\n$\\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} p(x) dx + \\int_{3}^{4} p(x) dx$\n\n**Part 1: Integral from 0 to 3**\n\nIn the range $0 \\le x \\le 3$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8} = \\frac{x^3}{4}$.\nThe integral is:\n$\\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{x^3}{4} dx = [\\frac{x^4}{16}]_{0}^{3} = \\frac{3^4}{16} - \\frac{0^4}{16} = \\frac{81}{16} = 5.0625$\n\n**Part 2: Integral from 3 to 4**\n\nIn the range $3 < x \\le 5$, the function is $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x}$.\nThis integral can be solved analytically. We recognize that the term is in the form of $e^x(f(x) + f'(x))$.\nUsing trigonometric identities, we can simplify $\\frac{1 + \\sin x}{1 + \\cos x}$:\n$\\frac{1 + \\sin x}{1 + \\cos x} = \\frac{1 + 2\\sin(x/2)\\cos(x/2)}{2\\cos^2(x/2)} = \\frac{1}{2\\cos^2(x/2)} + \\frac{2\\sin(x/2)\\cos(x/2)}{2\\cos^2(x/2)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sec^2(x/2) + \\tan(x/2)$\nLet $f(x) = \\tan(x/2)$. Its derivative is $f'(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sec^2(x/2)$.\nThe integrand is $e^x(f'(x) + f(x))$, and its antiderivative is $e^x f(x) = e^x \\tan(x/2)$.\n\nSo, the definite integral is:\n$\\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x} dx = [e^x \\tan(\\frac{x}{2})]_{3}^{4} = e^4 \\tan(\\frac{4}{2}) - e^3 \\tan(\\frac{3}{2}) = e^4 \\tan(2) - e^3 \\tan(1.5)$\n\nThe total integral is the sum of these two parts. The following Python code calculates this sum and prints the breakdown of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the definite integral of a piecewise function from x=0 to x=4.\n\n# Part 1: Integral of (2*x**3)/8 from x=0 to x=3.\n# The analytical solution is [x**4 / 16].\npart1_upper = 3**4 / 16\npart1_lower = 0**4 / 16\npart1_result = part1_upper - part1_lower\n\n# Part 2: Integral of e^x(1+sin x)/(1+cos x) from x=3 to x=4.\n# The analytical solution is [e^x * tan(x/2)].\n# Note: angles for trigonometric functions are in radians.\npart2_upper = math.exp(4) * math.tan(4 / 2)\npart2_lower = math.exp(3) * math.tan(3 / 2)\npart2_result = part2_upper - part2_lower\n\n# Total integral is the sum of the two parts.\ntotal_integral = part1_result + part2_result\n\nprint(\"The total integral is the sum of the integrals over two intervals:\")\nprint(\"Integral(from 0 to 3) + Integral(from 3 to 4)\\n\")\nprint(\"Final Equation:\")\nprint(f\"([{3**4}/16] - [{0**4}/16]) + ([e^4 * tan(2)] - [e^3 * tan(1.5)])\")\nprint(f\"= ({part1_upper:.4f} - {part1_lower:.4f}) + ({part2_upper:.4f} - {part2_lower:.4f})\")\nprint(f\"= {part1_result:.4f} + ({part2_result:.4f})\")\nprint(f\"= {total_integral:.4f}\")\n```\n<<<-397.4685>>>"
