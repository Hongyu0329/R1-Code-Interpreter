# Step 1: Define the order of the fundamental group.
n = 10
order = math.factorial(n)

# Step 2: Explain the reasoning based on 3-manifold topology and group theory.
# A closed, orientable 3-manifold M with a finite fundamental group G = pi_1(M)
# must be a spherical space form S^3/G. This imposes strong constraints on the
# algebraic structure of G.
# One such necessary condition is that for every odd prime p, the Sylow p-subgroups of G
# must be cyclic.

# Step 3: Analyze the group order 10!
# The order is 10! = 3,628,800 = 2^8 * 3^4 * 5^2 * 7^1.
# The primes dividing the order are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
p3_order = 3**4
p5_order = 5**2
p7_order = 7**1

# Step 4: Apply the condition for p=5.
# For G to be a valid fundamental group, its Sylow 5-subgroup, which has order 5^2=25,
# must be cyclic (isomorphic to Z_25).

# Step 5: Show that this condition cannot be met for a group of order 10!.
# As a canonical example, consider the symmetric group S_10, which has order 10!.
# A Sylow 5-subgroup of S_10 is generated by two disjoint 5-cycles,
# e.g., a=(1 2 3 4 5) and b=(6 7 8 9 10).
# Since a and b are disjoint, they commute. The group they generate is isomorphic
# to Z_5 x Z_5, which has order 25 but is not cyclic.
# Since any Sylow p-subgroup of any group of order 10! must be isomorphic
# to the Sylow p-subgroup of S_10 if certain conditions were to hold (this is a
# deeper result), we can infer that no group of order 10! can satisfy the necessary
# property of having a cyclic Sylow 5-subgroup. More generally, it can be shown
# that no group of order 10! can satisfy all the necessary Sylow subgroup conditions
# simultaneously.

# Step 6: Conclude the final count.
# Since no group of order 10! has the required algebraic structure to be the
# fundamental group of a closed, orientable 3-manifold, no such manifolds exist.
