    "This puzzle is a wordplay that connects a geographical feature in Vienna to the name of an English poet through the Russian language. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify the key clue:** The puzzle mentions the \"wide boulevards of Vienna\". The most famous of these is the circular Ringstrasse, often simply called \"The Ring\".\n2.  **Translate to Russian:** The prompt specifies a \"Russian translation\". The Russian word for \"ring\" (like a circular road) is \"кольцо\" (pronounced \"kol'tso\").\n3.  **Find the phonetic link:** The next step is to find a famous English poet whose surname sounds very similar to the Russian word \"кольцо\".\n4.  **Identify the Poet:** The surname of the English poet Samuel Taylor **Coleridge**, when written in Russian Cyrillic, is \"Кольридж\" (pronounced \"Kol'ridzh\"). The strong phonetic similarity between \"кольцо\" (kol'tso) and \"Кольридж\" (Kol'ridzh) is the solution to the riddle.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this logic and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_vienna_poet_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and solves the riddle about the English poet's\n    surname found in a description of Vienna's boulevards.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: The key geographical feature in Vienna is its famous\n    # Ringstrasse boulevard, often just called \"The Ring\".\n    location_clue = \"The Ring (Ringstrasse)\"\n    \n    # Step 2: In Russian, as per the puzzle's constraint, the word for \"ring\"\n    # is \"кольцо\".\n    russian_word = \"кольцо\"\n    russian_pronunciation = \"kol'tso\"\n    \n    # Step 3: We need to find an English poet whose surname sounds like \"кольцо\".\n    # The surname \"Coleridge\" is a very close match when transliterated into Russian.\n    poet_surname_english = \"Coleridge\"\n    poet_surname_russian = \"Кольридж\"\n    poet_surname_russian_pronunciation = \"Kol'ridzh\"\n\n    # Step 4: Present the logic and the final answer.\n    print(\"Solving the riddle step-by-step:\")\n    print(f\"1. The 'wide boulevards of Vienna' hints at the famous '{location_clue}'.\")\n    print(f\"2. In the 'Russian translation', the word for 'ring' is '{russian_word}' (pronounced '{russian_pronunciation}').\")\n    print(f\"3. An English poet's surname sounds very similar to this Russian word.\")\n    print(f\"4. The poet is Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
