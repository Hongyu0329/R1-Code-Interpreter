Based on its role in promoting T cell survival, persistence, and a less exhausted phenotype, interleukin-15 would be predicted to **increase** the release of effector cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) from CAR T cells upon antigen stimulation when compared to CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15. This is because IL-15 generates a more functionally potent and fit CAR T cell product.
