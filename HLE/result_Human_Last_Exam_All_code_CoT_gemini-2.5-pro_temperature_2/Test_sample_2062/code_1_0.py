# Part (b) calculation:
# This script calculates the number of similarity classes for 3x3 diagonal matrices
# with eigenvalues chosen from a set of 3 distinct values {alpha, beta, gamma}.

# This is a combination with repetition problem.
# Let k be the size of the multiset (matrix dimension).
k = 3
# Let n be the number of distinct elements to choose from (number of distinct eigenvalues).
n = 3

# The formula for combinations with repetition is C(k + n - 1, k).
# We will now calculate this value.
num_classes = math.comb(k + n - 1, k)

# The problem asks to show the numbers in the final equation.
