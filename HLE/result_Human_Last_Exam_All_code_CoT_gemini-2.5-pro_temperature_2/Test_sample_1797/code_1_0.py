    This function identifies the incorrect statement about attack graph analysis.
    The analysis of each option is as follows:
    A: Correct. This describes the basic graph structure and the application of graph algorithms.
    B: Correct. This accurately describes the state explosion problem.
    C: Incorrect. While some related problems are NP-hard, the generation of the attack graph itself is not generally considered NP-hard. The primary difficulty is the potential for an exponentially large output, not the complexity class of the generation algorithm itself.
    D: Correct. This accurately describes the need for dynamic analysis and incremental updates.
    E: Correct. Model checking is a key application for formally verifying security properties on attack graphs.

    Therefore, the only incorrect statement is C.
