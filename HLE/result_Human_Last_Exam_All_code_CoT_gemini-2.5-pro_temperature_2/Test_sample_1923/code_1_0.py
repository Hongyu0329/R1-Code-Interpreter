def calculate_gravitational_aberration():
    """
    Calculates the apparent shift of a moving mass due to the finite speed of gravity.

    This model demonstrates the principle of aberration. We assume:
    - Mass 1 (the observer) is at the origin (0, 0).
    - Mass 2 (the source) moves at a constant velocity `v` along a line `y = d`.
    - The gravitational field propagates at the speed of light, `c`.
    - The force felt by Mass 1 at `t_obs` is determined by the position of Mass 2
      at an earlier "retarded" time, `t_ret`.

    The key equation we solve is: t_obs = t_ret + (distance_at_t_ret / c)
