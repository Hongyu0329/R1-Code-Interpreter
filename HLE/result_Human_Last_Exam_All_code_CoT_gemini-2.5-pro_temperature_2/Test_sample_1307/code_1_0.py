    # Choice C

    # Choice F
    print(f"  - Choice F ({choices['F']}): This is a contained hematoma resulting from an arterial puncture that remains in communication with the arterial lumen. It is a well-known complication of cardiac catheterization and characteristically presents as a pulsatile mass with an associated thrill and bruit.
