The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\omega$ and the single-particle energy $\epsilon_k$ (shifted by the chemical potential $\mu$). Its mathematical form is $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - (\epsilon_k - \mu) + i\eta}$. The poles of this function correspond to the allowed single-particle energies.
