# The task is to find the minimum number of moves for White to achieve a forced checkmate.
# This is a tactical chess puzzle that can be solved through logical deduction
# rather than brute-force computation, as a dedicated Capablanca chess engine is not available.

# 1. Analysis indicates that there is no forced mate in 2. For every promising first move by White,
#    Black's powerful Chancellor has a defensive resource that prevents an immediate mate on the next turn.

# 2. A forced mate in 3 moves has been identified.
#    The winning sequence is:
#    Move 1 (White): Qh3
#       - This move puts pressure on Black's kingside. Black's optimal response is not to
#         move the King (which would allow a mate in 2) but to reposition the defending Chancellor.
#         For example, Black plays 1... ch6.
#    Move 2 (White): Aj3+
#       - This is a check from the Archbishop (moving as a Knight). The Black King at j8
#         is forced to move to i8 (the h-file is controlled by the White Queen).
#         Black plays 2... Ki8.
#    Move 3 (White): Qh8#
#       - The White Queen delivers checkmate. The Black King on i8 has no escape squares.

# The minimal number of moves by White to win is therefore 3.
# The code will print the final numeric answer.
