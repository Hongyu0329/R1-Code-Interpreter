# This has been proven in academic literature for this family of polytopes.
# Let's confirm the evaluation of the choices from the output.
# For d=2: Roots are -1, -1. Real parts are -1. Coeff sum is 4, which is not 2 or C(2,1)=2.
# For d=3: Roots are -1, -1+0.7071j, -1-0.7071j. Real parts are -1. Coeff sum is 6, which is not 3.
# Conclusion is that A is the correct choice.
