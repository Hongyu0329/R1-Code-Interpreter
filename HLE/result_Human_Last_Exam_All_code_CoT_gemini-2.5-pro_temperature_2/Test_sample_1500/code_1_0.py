    # is a KÃ¤hler manifold. This is a known theoretical result.

    # Part (b): Verification
    # The statement is that for G = SU(n), b_2(O_lambda) is always n - 1.
    # We use a counterexample to check this claim.
    # Consider the case G = SU(3), so n = 3.
    n = 3
    
    # According to the statement, the second Betti number should be:
    b2_proposed = n - 1
    
    # Now, consider a singular coadjoint orbit for SU(3), which is the complex
    # projective space CP^2.
    # The Betti numbers for CP^k are b_{2j} = 1 for 0 <= j <= k, and 0 otherwise.
    # For CP^2, the second Betti number b_2 is 1.

    # Part (c): Verification
    # The statement is that the equivariant cohomology ring of an orbit is isomorphic
    # to the cohomology ring of a GKM graph. This is true because coadjoint orbits
    # of compact semisimple Lie groups satisfy the conditions to be GKM manifolds.
