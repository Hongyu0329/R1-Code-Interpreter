# From the reasoning, we have determined the values for n_2 and n_3.
# n_2 is the smallest possible number of vertices for such a 2-planar graph.
# Our analysis concluded that n_2 = 21.
n_2 = 21

# n_3 is the smallest possible number of vertices for such a 3-planar graph.
# Our analysis concluded that n_3 = 21.
n_3 = 21

# The problem asks for the calculation of (n_2 + n_3) * n_2.
result = (n_2 + n_3) * n_2

# We print the final equation with the numbers plugged in, as requested.
print(f"({n_2} + {n_3}) * {n_2} = {result}")

# The final result in the specified format
print(f"<<<{result}>>>")
