    "This is a mathematical problem that can be solved with logical deduction. I will first lay out the step-by-step reasoning and then provide a Python script that explains this reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The goal is to find the maximum number of *different* clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with exactly `n = 128` vertices.\n2.  **Establish an upper bound:** A clique is a subgraph where all vertices are connected. An induced clique of size `k` requires `k` vertices. Since the graph has a total of `n=128` vertices, any clique within it can have a size of at most 128. This means the number of different clique sizes cannot possibly exceed 128 (for sizes 1, 2, ..., 128).\n3.  **Propose a construction:** To see if this upper bound of 128 is achievable, we need to construct a graph on 128 vertices that contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. The simplest candidate for this is the complete graph `K_128`.\n4.  **Verify the construction:** In a complete graph `K_128`, every pair of vertices is connected. Therefore, if you take any subset of `k` vertices from `K_128`, the subgraph induced by this subset is also a complete graph, `K_k`. This holds for any `k` from 1 to 128.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the theoretical maximum is 128 and we have found a graph (`K_128`) that achieves this, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128. The Python script will walk through this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_clique_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum number of different clique sizes in a graph with n vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices in the graph.\n    n = 128\n\n    print(f\"Problem: Find the maximum number of different induced clique sizes in a graph with n = {n} vertices.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the upper bound.\n    # A clique of size k is an induced subgraph on a set of k vertices.\n    # In a graph with n vertices, the size k of any subset of vertices must be 1 <= k <= n.\n    # Therefore, there can be at most n different possible clique sizes (1, 2, ..., n).\n    upper_bound = n\n    print(\"Step 1: Finding the theoretical maximum (upper bound).\")\n    print(f\"An induced clique is formed from a subset of the graph's vertices.\")\n    print(f\"Since the graph has {n} vertices, the size of any such subset 'k' must be 1 <= k <= {n}.\")\n    print(f\"This means the number of different possible clique sizes cannot be greater than {n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    # Step 2: Show that this upper bound is achievable with a specific graph.\n    # We can propose the complete graph K_n as a candidate.\n    print(\"Step 2: Constructing a graph that achieves this maximum.\")\n    print(f\"Consider the complete graph on {n} vertices, known as K_{n}.\")\n    print(f\"In a complete graph, every vertex is connected by an edge to every other vertex.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 3: Verify the construction.\n    # In K_n, any subset of k vertices forms an induced clique of size k.\n    # This is because all vertices in the subset are already connected to each other in the original graph.\n    # This property holds for any integer k from 1 to n.\n    print(\"Step 3: Verifying the construction.\")\n    print(f\"Let's select any integer 'k' such that 1 <= k <= {n}.\")\n    print(f\"Now, choose any subset of {n} vertices with size k.\")\n    print(\"The subgraph induced by this subset is a clique of size k (K_k),\")\n    print(\"because all its vertices are connected to each other in the original complete graph.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the graph K_{n} contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to {n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Step 4: Final Conclusion.\n    # The number of different clique sizes in K_128 is 128.\n    # Since we established an upper bound of 128 and found a graph achieving it, this is the maximum.\n    final_answer = n\n    print(\"Step 4: Conclusion.\")\n    print(\"The set of different clique sizes found in K_128 is {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of elements in this set is {final_answer}.\")\n    print(\"\\nSince the maximum possible number is 128, and we have constructed a graph\")\n    print(\"that achieves it, the final answer is:\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer = {final_answer}\")\n\n\nsolve_clique_problem()\n```\n<<<128>>>"
