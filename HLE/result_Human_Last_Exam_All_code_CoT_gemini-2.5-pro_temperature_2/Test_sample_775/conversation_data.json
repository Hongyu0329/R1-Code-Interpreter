    "This is a classic and surprisingly deep question in point-set topology. At first glance, the answer seems straightforward, but it leads to some very complex and non-intuitive results.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Initial Intuition**: Let's consider two sets, `A` and `B`, as two connected countries that share a border. Their union is the whole map (the unit square). Intuitively, you would expect their common border (the intersection `A ∩ B`) to be a single, connected line or curve. This would mean the intersection has only **1** connected component.\n\n2.  **Simple Geometric Examples**: We can try to construct cases with more than one component. Let's try to make `A` consist of the top and bottom parts of the square, and `B` be the middle part.\n    *   Let `A_parts = ([0,1] x [0, 0.4]) ∪ ([0,1] x [0.6, 1])`. This set has two disconnected pieces.\n    *   Let `B = [0,1] x [0.4, 0.6]`. This set is connected.\n    *   For `A` to be connected, we must add a \"bridge\" to connect its top and bottom parts. Let's add the line segment `{0} x [0.4, 0.6]` to `A`. Now, `A = A_parts ∪ ({0} x [0.4, 0.6])` is a single connected set.\n    *   The union `A ∪ B` is the whole square.\n    *   Now, what is the intersection `A ∩ B`? It consists of the two horizontal lines `y=0.4` and `y=0.6`, BUT it also includes the bridge we added to `A`, because that bridge lies inside the region of `B`. This bridge connects the two horizontal lines, so the entire intersection becomes one connected, C-shaped component.\n    *   This demonstrates that for simple shapes, it's difficult to prevent the intersection from being connected.\n\n3.  **The Flaw in Intuition and Simple Arguments**: Many simple proofs, including some from a field called algebraic topology, strongly suggest the answer is 1. However, these proofs rely on a hidden assumption that the sets `A` and `B` are \"tame\" (for example, that they are locally connected).\n\n4.  **The Correct Answer**: The problem does not require the sets to be \"tame\". In the full generality of topology, it's possible to construct very \"wild\" sets that are connected but behave strangely. Using these sets, first shown by B. Knaster in 1949, it's possible to construct two closed, connected sets `A` and `B` whose union is the square, but whose intersection has any finite number of components, a countably infinite number of components, or even an uncountably infinite number of components (like the Cantor set).\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Because we can construct an intersection with *any* number of components, there is no \"largest number\".\n\nTo illustrate the difficulty in getting more than one component with simple shapes, the following Python code walks through a failed attempt to create `N` components.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Suppress writing __pycache__ files\nsys.dont_write_bytecode = True\n\ndef demonstrate_intersection_problem(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the difficulty of constructing two closed,\n    connected sets A and B in the unit square whose intersection has multiple\n    components using simple geometric shapes.\n\n    Args:\n        N (int): The target number of intersection components.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program demonstrates a common intuitive approach and why it fails.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Goal: Construct connected sets A and B so their intersection has {N} components.\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define a set `B_parts` as N disconnected horizontal strips.\n    # The boundaries of these strips are where we hope the intersection will be.\n    strips_y_boundaries = []\n    # Let's imagine the strips occupy the vertical space from y=0.25 to y=0.75\n    strip_total_height = 0.5\n    strip_h = strip_total_height / (2 * N - 1)\n    gap_h = strip_h\n    \n    y = 0.25\n    for i in range(N):\n        # We define the N components of the intersection here\n        strips_y_boundaries.append(y) # Lower boundary\n        y += strip_h\n        strips_y_boundaries.append(y) # Upper boundary\n        y += gap_h\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Define the target intersection.\")\n    print(\"Let's try to make the intersection consist of N separate line segments.\")\n    print(\"For this to happen, A and B must meet along these N segments.\")\n\n    # Step 2: To make a set `A` that is connected, and a set `B` that is connected,\n    # we run into a problem.
