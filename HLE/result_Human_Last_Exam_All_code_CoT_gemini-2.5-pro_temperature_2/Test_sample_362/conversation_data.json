    "Of course. Here is a Python script that determines the product of the specified Wittig reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants**: The reaction involves pivalaldehyde (an aldehyde) and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane (a phosphorus ylide).\n2.  **Understand the Reaction**: The Wittig reaction forms a new carbon-carbon double bond (an alkene) by combining the carbon backbone of an aldehyde/ketone with that of a phosphorus ylide. The carbonyl oxygen (`=O`) from the aldehyde and the triphenylphosphine (`=PPh₃`) from the ylide are eliminated, forming triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n3.  **Determine Product Structure**: I will computationally \"cut\" the fragments from the reactants and \"paste\" them together to form the product.\n    *   From pivalaldehyde `(CH₃)₃C-CH=O`, we take the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part.\n    *   From the ylide `Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)`, we take the `=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)` part.\n    *   Combining them gives the product: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)`.\n4.  **Analyze the Product**: The script will then determine the IUPAC name, chemical formula, and molar mass for this resulting structure.\n5.  **Present the Result**: The final output will clearly display the reactants, the overall reaction equation, and a detailed analysis of the main organic product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a Wittig reaction to determine its product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the reactants\n    aldehyde_name = \"pivalaldehyde (2,2-dimethylpropanal)\"\n    aldehyde_structure = \"(CH3)3C-CHO\"\n    aldehyde_fragment = \"(CH3)3C-CH=\"\n\n    ylide_name = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\n    # Ph3P is triphenylphosphine, -(o-ClC6H4) is an ortho-chlorophenyl group\n    ylide_structure = \"Ph3P=CH-CH2-(o-ClC6H4)\"\n    ylide_fragment = \"=CH-CH2-(o-ClC6H4)\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Define the byproduct\n    byproduct_name = \"triphenylphosphine oxide\"\n    byproduct_structure = \"Ph3P=O\"\n\n    # Step 3: Combine the fragments to form the product\n    product_structure = aldehyde_fragment + ylide_fragment.lstrip('=')\n\n    # Step 4: Analyze the product\n    product_iupac_name = \"1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\"\n    product_formula = \"C13H17Cl\"\n    \n    # Calculate molar mass\n    atomic_weights = {'C': 12.011, 'H': 1.008, 'Cl': 35.453}\n    molar_mass = (13 * atomic_weights['C'] + \n                  17 * atomic_weights['H'] + \n                  1 * atomic_weights['Cl'])\n\n    # Step 5: Print the full analysis\n    print(\"Wittig Reaction Analysis\")\n    print(\"-\" * 45)\n    print(\"Reactant 1 (Aldehyde):\")\n    print(f\"  Name:      {aldehyde_name}\")\n    print(f\"  Structure: {aldehyde_structure}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nReactant 2 (Wittig Reagent):\")\n    print(f\"  Name:      {ylide_name}\")\n    print(f\"  Structure: {ylide_structure}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 45)\n    print(\"The Wittig Reaction Equation:\")\n    # This line shows each component of the final reaction \"equation\"\n    print(f\"{aldehyde_structure} + {ylide_structure} --> {product_structure} + {byproduct_structure}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 45)\n\n    print(\"Major Organic Product:\")\n    print(f\"  IUPAC Name: {product_iupac_name}\")\n    print(f\"  Structure:  {product_structure}\")\n    print(f\"  Formula:    {product_formula}\")\n    print(f\"  Molar Mass: {molar_mass:.3f} g/mol\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution\nsolve_wittig_reaction()\n\n```\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
