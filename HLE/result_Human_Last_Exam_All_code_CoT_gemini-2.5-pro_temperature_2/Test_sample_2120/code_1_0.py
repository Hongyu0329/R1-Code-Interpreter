# Step 1: Identify the poles from the E-field equation.
# The functional equation for E(z) has arguments with poles at z=1 and z=2.
# These are the first two coordinates.
poles_from_E = [1, 2]

# Step 2: Identify the poles from the B-field equation.
# The poles are the roots of the denominator of the RHS of the equation.
# The polynomial is 4z^4 - z^3 + z^2 + 1 = 0.
# We can find the sum of its roots using Vieta's formulas.
# For a polynomial a_n*z^n + a_{n-1}*z^{n-1} + ... + a_0 = 0, the sum of roots is -a_{n-1}/a_n.
a_4 = 4
a_3 = -1
num_roots_from_B = 4

# Use Fraction for exact arithmetic
sum_of_roots_from_B = Fraction(-a_3, a_4)

# Step 3: Calculate the total sum of all coordinates.
total_sum = sum(poles_from_E) + sum_of_roots_from_B

# Step 4: Calculate the total number of coordinates.
total_poles = len(poles_from_E) + num_roots_from_B

# Step 5: Calculate the average value.
average_value = total_sum / total_poles

# Step 6: Print the final calculation step-by-step as requested.
p1, p2 = poles_from_E[0], poles_from_E[1]
print("The average value is calculated by summing all identified coordinates and dividing by the count.")
print(f"Calculation: ({p1} + {p2} + {sum_of_roots_from_B}) / {total_poles}")
print(f"Total sum: {total_sum}")
print(f"Total count: {total_poles}")
print(f"Final Average = {average_value}")

# The final answer in the required format
final_answer = average_value
