    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Sequence:** The problem asks for `a(3)`, where `a(n)` is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for the electron or photon propagators in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). This is a well-known sequence in mathematical physics. The calculation of these numbers is highly complex and doesn't follow a simple formula. The results are typically generated using specialized computer programs for graph enumeration.\n2.  **Use Established Values:** I will use the established, known values for this sequence. This sequence is cataloged as A000171 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). The first few terms are:\n    *   `a(1)` = 1 (for order 2)\n    *   `a(2)` = 2 (for order 4)\n    *   `a(3)` = 10 (for order 6)\n    *   `a(4)` = 74 (for order 8)\n3.  **Implement a Lookup Function:** I will write a Python script that contains these known values. The script will retrieve the value for `n=3` as requested.\n4.  **Format the Output:** The final code will print the \"equation\" that shows the result. In this case, the equation is the statement `a(3) = 10`. This output will include the number `3` and the resulting number `10`, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to find the value of a(3):\n\n```python\ndef get_qed_propagator_diagram_count(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Retrieves the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n\n    for electron or photon propagators in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).\n    \n    The sequence a(n) is known from physics research (OEIS A000171), \n    and this function stores the first few established terms.\n    \"\"\"\n    known_counts = {\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 10,\n        4: 74,\n        5: 706\n    }\n    \n    if n in known_counts:\n        return known_counts[n]\n    else:\n        # The calculation for higher-order terms is a subject of active research\n        # and requires significant computational resources.\n        raise ValueError(f\"The value for n={n} is not available in this simplified context.\")\n\n# The user is asking for the value of a(n) when n=3.\nn_value = 3\n\n# We \"calculate\" the result by retrieving it from the list of known values.\nresult = get_qed_propagator_diagram_count(n_value)\n\n# The final equation shows the value of a(n) for the given n.\n# We will print each number involved in this equation.\nprint(f\"The number of diagrams, a(n), for n = {n_value} is requested.\")\nprint(f\"Based on the established sequence from QED calculations, the result is:\")\nprint(f\"a({n_value}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<10>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    If a(n) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics, what is a(3)?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
