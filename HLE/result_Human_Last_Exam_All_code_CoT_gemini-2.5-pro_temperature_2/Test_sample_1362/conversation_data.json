    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction for all primes `p > 2`, we first need to check the condition for \"good reduction\". A curve `z^2 = f(x)` has good reduction at an odd prime `p` if the reduction of the curve modulo `p` is smooth. This is equivalent to the condition that `p` does not divide the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)`. Therefore, for a curve to have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`, the discriminant of `f(x)` must not have any odd prime factors. That is, the discriminant must be of the form `±2^k` for some integer `k ≥ 0`.\n\nMy plan is to use Python with the `sympy` library to perform the following steps for each option:\n1.  Define the polynomial `f(x)` corresponding to the curve.\n2.  Calculate the discriminant of `f(x)`.\n3.  Find the prime factors of the discriminant's absolute value.\n4.  Check if there are any odd prime factors. The curve with no odd prime factors in its discriminant is the candidate for having good reduction above 2.\n\nThe condition of \"ordinary\" reduction is more subtle, but a curve must first have good reduction. The discriminant test is the most direct way to check this necessary condition.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef analyze_curve(label, f_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the discriminant of a polynomial, factors it,\n    and checks for good reduction for odd primes.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.symbols('x')\n    try:\n        # Parse the string into a sympy expression\n        f = sympy.sympify(f_str)\n        # Calculate the discriminant\n        disc = sympy.discriminant(f, x)\n        \n        # Factor the discriminant\n        if disc == 0:\n            factors = {}\n            odd_prime_factors = []\n        else:\n            factors = sympy.factorint(abs(disc))\n            odd_prime_factors = [p for p in factors if p != 2]\n\n        print(f\"Curve {label}: z^2 = {f}\")\n        print(f\"Discriminant: {disc}\")\n        \n        if not odd_prime_factors:\n            print(\"The discriminant has no odd prime factors.
