# The structural model is E->A->B->C<-D<-E.
# We are asked if an observed correlation between A and D implies causation between them.

# 1. Analyze the causal relationship between A and D from the model.
#    - There is no arrow A->D or D->A, so there is no direct causation.
#    - There is no mediating path like A->...->D or D->...->A, so there is no indirect causation.

# 2. Analyze the source of the correlation between A and D.
#    - The model shows that E is a common cause of both A and D (E->A and E->D).
#    - A path that connects A and D is A <- E -> D.
#    - This structure is a classic example of "confounding", where a third variable (E)
#      causes two other variables (A and D), creating a non-causal ("spurious") correlation between them.

# 3. Answer the question.
#    - The correlation is explained by the confounder E, not by a causal link between A and D.
#    - Therefore, the correlation does not imply causation.
