    This function provides the answers to the nested SQS doubling construction problem.
    Let v be the order of the original SQS(v), with v >= 4.

    (a) True or False: In the doubling construction, each element of Q x {0, 1}
        is contained in exactly v - 1 ND-pairs.
    Explanation: ND-pair means D-pair. This asks if the D-graph of the SQS(2v)
    is regular with degree v-1. The degree of a vertex (x,0) in the new D-graph is
    deg_D(x) + v - 1, where deg_D(x) is its degree in the original D-graph.
    deg_D(x) is not always 0 (e.g., for v=4, deg_D(x)=2).
    So, the statement is False in general.

    (b) What is the multiplicity of an ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)} in SQS(2v) if {x, y}
        had multiplicity mu in SQS(v)?
    Explanation: The multiplicity of a pair {x,y} is the number of blocks it appears in.
    In a nested SQS, the multiplicity as a D-pair is either 0 (if it's an N-pair)
    or (v-2)/2 (if it's a D-pair). If the new multiplicity of {(x,0),(y,0)} is
    independent of the original, a constant value related to v is likely.
    A common feature of such constructions is the regularization of substructures.
    A plausible value is the maximum possible original multiplicity, which is (v-2)/2.

    (c) Must there exist ND-pairs with multiplicity exactly v in the constructed nested SQS(2v)?
    Explanation: The multiplicity of any pair {a,b} in an SQS(n) is the number of blocks
    it's contained in. For SQS(2v), the total number of blocks containing any given pair
    is r_2 = (2v - 2) / 2 = v - 1. The multiplicity as a D-pair cannot exceed this
    total number of occurrences. Since v >= 4, v - 1 is strictly less than v.
    Therefore, no pair can have a D-multiplicity of v. The answer is No.
