    # Analysis Summary:
    # 1. Contract: Sale of a specific good (MacBook Pro) that was not yet in a deliverable state.
    # 2. Seller's Obligation: Jake needed to replace the screen to make it deliverable.
    # 3. Rule for Transfer of Risk: Risk passes to the buyer only after the seller completes the work AND notifies the buyer.
    # 4. Timeline Application:
    #    - Jake completed the screen replacement.
    #    - On June 5, Jake notified Luke that the laptop would be ready on June 6. This notice confirms the completion of the work.
    #    - The flood happened after the work was done and after notice was given.
    # 5. Conclusion: The risk of loss had transferred to Luke before the flood. Therefore, Jake is not required to refund the money.

    # This corresponds to answer choice B.
    correct_choice = 'B'

    answer_text = "B. Jake is not required to return the money paid to him by Luke because risk of loss passed from Jake to Luke as a result of Jake completing the repairs, and thereby putting the laptop in a deliverable state, and notifying Luke of a precise date on which the laptop will be ready."
