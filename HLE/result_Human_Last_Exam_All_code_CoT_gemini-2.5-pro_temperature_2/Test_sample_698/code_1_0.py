# Description: This script will analyze the provided options for the Word Avalanche problem and print the correct answer.

# The target word is "computer", which has the syllable pattern: com-pu-ter.
# The description is: "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."

# We need a pun that repeats the syllable pattern and matches the description.

# Let's analyze the correct option:
# B. Computer: "Come poo, tern!"

# Syllable analysis:
word_1 = "Computer"
syllables_1 = ["com", "pu", "ter"]

word_2 = '"Come poo, tern!"'
syllables_2 = ["Come", "poo", "tern"]

# The syllables in "Come poo, tern!" phonetically match the syllables in "Computer".
# "tern" is a type of bird.
# "Come poo" matches the description of software telling a bird where to relieve itself.

# Therefore, this is the correct answer as it is a True Avalanche and it fits the description.
print("The original word 'Computer' establishes the syllable pattern: com - pu - ter.")
print("The pun 'Come poo, tern!' repeats this pattern: come - poo - tern.")
print("This fits the description because the 'computer' is giving a command ('Come poo') to a bird ('tern').")
print("\nThe correct choice is B.")

print("\n<<<B>>>")
