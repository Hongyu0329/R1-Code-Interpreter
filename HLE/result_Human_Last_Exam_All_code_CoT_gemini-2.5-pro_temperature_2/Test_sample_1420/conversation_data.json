    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to calculate the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Theory and Parameters:** The problem requires using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion from renormalization group theory. We need to identify the key parameters:\n    *   `d`: The spatial dimension, given as `d=3`.\n    *   `d_c`: The upper critical dimension. For models in the O(n) universality class (which includes the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models), `d_c = 4`.\n    *   `n`: The number of components of the order parameter. As the specific model isn't named, I will use the most common case, the Ising universality class, where `n=1`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Epsilon (ϵ):** The expansion parameter `ϵ` is defined as the deviation from the upper critical dimension: `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n\n3.  **State the Formula:** The specific heat exponent `α` can be calculated to the first order in `ϵ` using the standard formula from the O(n) model:\n    `α ≈ (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** I will write a Python script that defines the parameters, calculates `ϵ`, substitutes all values into the formula for `α`, and prints out each step of the calculation, including the final numerical result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha (α)\n    using the first-order epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the parameters\n    d = 3  # Spatial dimension\n    d_c = 4 # Upper critical dimension for the O(n) model\n    n = 1  # Number of components of the order parameter (n=1 for the Ising universality class)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate epsilon (ε)\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the first-order expansion formula for alpha (α)\n    # The formula is: α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    denominator = 2 * (n + 8)\n    alpha = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n\n    # Step 4: Print the detailed calculation\n    print(\"Calculation of the specific heat exponent alpha (α) using the ε-expansion:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"We use the following parameters:\")\n    print(f\"  - Spatial dimension (d): {d}\")\n    print(f\"  - Upper critical dimension (d_c): {d_c}\")\n    print(f\"  - Order parameter components (n): {n} (assuming the Ising universality class)\")\n    print(\"\\nFirst, we calculate the expansion parameter ε:\")\n    print(f\"  ε = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\n    print(\"\\nNext, we use the first-order formula for α:\")\n    print(f\"  α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"  α = ({4} - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"  α = {numerator} / ({2} * {n + 8}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"  α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Result:\")\n    # The result is 1/6, which is a repeating decimal\n    print(f\"  α = {alpha}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_alpha_exponent()\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
