    # --- Introduction to A4 and Projections ---
    print("Step 1: Understanding the 3D rotation group A_4")
    print("The group A_4 is the alternating group of degree 4, with order 12. In 3D, it represents the group of rotational symmetries of a regular tetrahedron.")
    print("The rotations in A_4 have orders 1 (identity), 2 (about axes through midpoints of opposite edges), and 3 (about axes through a vertex and the center of the opposite face).\n")

    print("Step 2: Understanding Symmetry under Projection")
    print("When a 3D object is projected onto a 2D plane, the resulting image can sometimes have a higher-order rotational symmetry than the 3D rotation group has about the projection axis. This is known as symmetry enhancement.")
    print("This can happen when an improper rotation (like a roto-reflection) in 3D becomes a proper rotation in the 2D projection.\n")
    print("An object's rotation group can be G, but its full symmetry group (including reflections) can be larger. For an object with A_4 rotation group, the full symmetry group could be T, T_d, or T_h.\n")

    # --- Analyzing each case ---
    print("Step 3: Examining each possible order.\n")

    # Case i) Order 3
    order_3_possible = True
    print("i) Is order 3 possible?")
    print("Yes. A tetrahedron has four 3-fold rotation axes. If we project an object with A_4 symmetry along one of these 3-fold axes, the rotational symmetries about this axis are preserved in the projection.")
    print("The projection will have a 3-fold rotational symmetry. Its rotation group is C_3, which has order 3.")
    print("Result for order 3: Possible.\n")

    # Case ii) Order 4
    order_4_possible = True
    print("ii) Is order 4 possible?")
    print("Yes. A_4 itself does not contain any element of order 4. However, we can have an object 'A' whose rotation group is A_4 but its full symmetry group is T_d (the full tetrahedral group, isomorphic to S_4).")
    print("The T_d group contains 4-fold roto-reflection axes (S_4). These axes are the same as the 2-fold rotation axes of A_4.")
    print("An S_4 operation consists of a 90-degree rotation followed by a reflection in the plane perpendicular to the axis.")
    print("If we project the object along such an S_4 axis, this improper rotation in 3D becomes a proper 90-degree rotation (C_4) in the 2D projection.")
    print("For example, a tetrahedron with vertices (1,1,1), (1,-1,-1), (-1,1,-1), (-1,-1,1) has rotation group A_4. Projecting it onto the xy-plane (along its S_4 axis) results in the vertices of a square, which has a C_4 rotation group of order 4.")
    print("Result for order 4: Possible.\n")

    # Case iii) Order 6
    order_6_possible = True
    print("iii) Is order 6 possible?")
    print("Yes. This is also possible through symmetry enhancement. Consider an object 'A' whose rotation group is A_4, but whose full symmetry group is T_h (the pyritohedral group).")
    print("The T_h group contains 6-fold roto-reflection axes (S_6), which coincide with the 3-fold rotation axes of A_4.")
    print("An S_6 operation consists of a 60-degree rotation followed by a reflection.")
    print("If we project such an object along an S_6 axis, this S_6 operation in 3D becomes a proper 60-degree rotation (C_6) in the 2D projection.")
    print("A pyritohedron is an example of a shape with T_h symmetry.")
    print("Result for order 6: Possible.\n")

    # Case iv) Infinity
    order_inf_possible = False
    print("iv) Is order Infinity possible?")
    print("No. A projection with infinite rotational symmetry (C_infinity, like a circle) would require the original 3D object to have a continuous rotational symmetry (e.g., being a surface of revolution).")
    print("However, the object's rotation group is the finite group A_4. A finite group cannot have a continuous rotational symmetry subgroup.")
    print("Any symmetry operation in a finite group is discrete. The projection of an object with finite symmetry cannot create a continuous symmetry in the projection, unless the projection is trivial (e.g., a single point), which is not possible for a non-trivial object whose rotational symmetry group is exactly A_4.")
    print("Result for order Infinity: Impossible.\n")

    # --- Final Conclusion ---
    print("---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The possible orders for the projection's group of rotations are those that can be generated either directly from the A_4 group's axes or through symmetry enhancement from a corresponding full symmetry group (T_d or T_h).")
