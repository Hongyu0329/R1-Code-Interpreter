    "My plan is to determine the value of 'n' by using established theorems from the representation theory of posets. The steps are as follows:\n\n1.  First, I will clarify the meaning of an \"n-resolvable\" functor in the context of homological algebra. It refers to a functor having a projective dimension of at most `n`.\n2.  Next, I will relate the projective dimension of functors to the global dimension of the associated category algebra, denoted as `KJ`.\n3.  I will then invoke a standard theorem regarding the global dimension of the category algebra `KJ` when `J` is a finite partially ordered set (poset).\n4.  This theorem will provide an upper bound for the projective dimension of *any* functor from `J` to `Vect_K`.\n5.  Finally, I will conclude that since an upper semilattice is a specific type of poset, and the result holds for any functor (including tame ones), this bound applies directly to the given problem, thus determining the value of `n`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Suppress the __pycache__ directory\nsys.dont_write_bytecode = True\n\ndef solve_homological_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and calculates the value of n for which a tame functor\n    f: J -> Vect_K (where J is an upper semilattice) is n-resolvable.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the term 'n-resolvable'.\")\n    print(\"A functor is 'n-resolvable' if it has a projective resolution of length at most n.\")\n    print(\"This is equivalent to saying its projective dimension is less than or equal to n.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Connecting to the category algebra KJ.\")\n    print(\"The homological properties of functors from J to Vect_K are governed by the category algebra KJ.\")\n    print(\"Specifically, the projective dimension of any functor is bounded by the global dimension of the algebra KJ.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Citing a key theorem from representation theory.\")\n    print(\"For any finite partially ordered set (poset) J and any field K, the category algebra KJ is a hereditary algebra.\")\n    print(\"An algebra is defined as 'hereditary' if and only if its global dimension is at most 1.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, Global Dimension(KJ) <= 1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Drawing the conclusion for the functor f.\")\n    print(\"Since the global dimension of KJ is at most 1, any functor f: J -> Vect_K must have a projective dimension of at most 1.\")\n    print(\"The specific conditions that J is an 'upper semilattice' and the functor is 'tame' do not alter this general result, as an upper semilattice is a poset and the result holds for all functors.\")\n    print(\"This means the functor is 1-resolvable.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 5: Final Answer.\")\n    print(\"The functor is n-resolvable for n determined by the following equation:\")\n    \n    # The final equation is n = 1.
