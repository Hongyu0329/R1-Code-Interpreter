    "Answering this question requires delving into the theory of stable reduction of algebraic curves, a topic in arithmetic geometry. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the question**: Understand the constraints imposed by \"stable reduction,\" \"genus 4,\" and \"Jacobian has good reduction.\"\n2.  **Relate Jacobian reduction to the curve's reduction**: The good reduction of the Jacobian imposes a strong topological constraint on the special fiber of the stable model. Specifically, the dual graph of the stable reduction must be a tree.\n3.  **Apply the genus formula**: For a stable curve with a tree-like dual graph, its arithmetic genus is simply the sum of the genera of its components.\n4.  **Use the stability condition**: Each component of the stable curve, viewed as a pointed curve, must itself be stable. This gives us an inequality involving the genus of the component and the number of nodes on it.\n5.  **Systematic Enumeration**: We can now rephrase the problem as a combinatorial one. We need to find all possible combinations of tree structures and genus assignments to their vertices that satisfy the conditions. We'll iterate through the number of components in the stable reduction.\n6.  **Code the Enumeration**: We will write a Python script that carries out this enumeration, explaining each step of the process and counting the valid configurations. Each valid configuration corresponds to one \"type\" of stable reduction.\n\nThe core formula for the arithmetic genus `g` of the special fiber is:\n`g = sum(g_i) + h_1(G)`\nwhere `g_i` are the geometric genera of the components and `h_1(G)` is the first Betti number of the dual graph `G` (i.e., the number of independent cycles).\n\nThe condition that the Jacobian has good reduction is equivalent to `h_1(G) = 0`, which means the dual graph `G` is a tree. Thus, the formula simplifies to:\n`g = sum(g_i)`\n\nFor our problem, `g = 4`, so we are looking for partitions of the number 4.\n\nEach irreducible component `C_i` (represented by a vertex `v_i` in the tree `G`) with genus `g_i` and `k_i` intersection points (nodes) with other components must be stable. The number of nodes `k_i` is the degree of the vertex `v_i`. The stability condition is:\n`2*g_i - 2 + k_i > 0`\n\nThe following Python code enumerates all possible configurations that satisfy these rules.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_stable_reductions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions of genus 4 curves\n    whose Jacobians have good reduction by enumerating all valid configurations.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"This script calculates the number of types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve\")\n    print(\"under the assumption that its Jacobian has good reduction.\\n\")\n    print(\"The key insight is that the Jacobian having good reduction implies the dual graph\")\n    print(\"of the stable reduction is a tree.
