    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor `d`**: We start by finding the prime factorization of $d=53599$. The structure of primitive characters depends on this factorization. A character $\\chi \\pmod{d}$ is primitive if its conductor is exactly $d$. For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$, a character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$ (where $\\chi_i$ is a character mod $p_i$) is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive. A character mod a prime $p$ is primitive if and only if it is non-trivial (i.e., not the principal character, which has order 1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Order `k`**: The order of the character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components, i.e., $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$. We are given that the required order is $k=6$.\n\n3.  **Count the Characters**: We need to count the number of tuples of non-trivial characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_r)$ such that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r)) = 6$. We can solve this using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. Let $N(m)$ be the number of characters where the order of each component $\\chi_i$ is a divisor of $m$. The total number of characters with order exactly 6 is given by:\n    $N_{=6} = N(\\text{divisors of } 6) - N(\\text{divisors of } 3) - N(\\text{divisors of } 2) + N(\\text{divisors of } 1)$\n    *   The number of characters mod $p$ of an order $j$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(j)$, provided that $j$ divides the order of the group of characters, which is $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n    *   For a given $m$, $N(m)$ is the product over the prime factors $p_i$ of the number of available characters for each prime. The number of characters for a prime $p_i$ is the sum of $\\phi(j)$ for all $j > 1$ that divide both $m$ and $p_i-1$.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**: We will write a Python script to perform these calculations, explaining each step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their counts.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    result = n\n    for p in factors:\n        result -= result // p\n    return result\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters\n    of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    k = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order k = {k}.\")\n    print(\"=\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: Factorize d\n    prime_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes = sorted(list(prime_factors.keys()))\n    print(f\"Step 1: Analyze the conductor d = {d}\")\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of d is: {d} = {' * '.join(map(str, primes))}\")\n    print(\"Since d is square-free, a character chi mod d is primitive if and only if its\")\n    print(\"component chi_p for each prime factor p is itself primitive (i.e., non-trivial, order > 1).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the counting method using Inclusion-Exclusion\n    print(\"Step 2: Method for counting characters of a specific order\")\n    print(\"The order of a character chi = product(chi_p) is lcm(order(chi_p)).
