# We analyze the geometric configuration where the centers of the two circles
# lie on different angle bisectors of the tangent lines.
# This leads to a unique solution for the radius r.

# Let r1 be the radius of the first circle, which is r.
# Let r2 be the radius of the second circle, which is 2.
r2 = 2

# The geometric relationship for this configuration yields the quadratic equation:
# r^2 - 2*r*r2 + r2^2 = 0
# Let's define the coefficients of this equation for r.
a = 1
b = -2 * r2
c = r2**2

# We solve the quadratic equation a*r^2 + b*r + c = 0.
# The discriminant is b^2 - 4*a*c.
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

# Since discriminant is 0, there is exactly one real solution for r.
r_sol = -b / (2*a)

# The question asks for the value of r^2.
r_squared = r_sol**2
