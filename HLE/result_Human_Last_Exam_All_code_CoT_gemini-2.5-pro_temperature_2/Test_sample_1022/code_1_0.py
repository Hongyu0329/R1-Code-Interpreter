# A python script to compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology
# group of T x T, where T is Thompson's group.

# The problem is to compute dim(H_b^4(T x T; R)).

# We identify the parameters of the problem.
# The group is a product of n groups G_i.
# G = G_1 x G_2 x ... x G_n
# In our case, G = T x T, so there are two groups in the product.
n = 2

# The groups are G_1 = T and G_2 = T.

# We are asked to compute the dimension of the cohomology group in degree k.
k = 4

# We use a theorem by Burger, Iozzi, and Monod (2009).
# Theorem: Let G_1, ..., G_n be countable groups acting on the circle S^1
# by orientation-preserving homeomorphisms, each with a dense orbit.
# Let G = G_1 x ... x G_n.
# Then, H_b^k(G; R) = 0 for all k > n.

# We check the conditions for Thompson's group T:
# 1. T is a countable group. (True)
# 2. T acts on the circle by orientation-preserving homeomorphisms. (True, by definition)
# 3. The action of T on the circle has a dense orbit. (True)
# The conditions of the theorem are satisfied.
