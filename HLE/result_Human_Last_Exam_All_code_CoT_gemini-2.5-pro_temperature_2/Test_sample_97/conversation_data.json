    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of the solid and the formation of a complex ion.\n\n1.  **Dissolution of Al(OH)3:**\n    Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷\n\n2.  **Formation of the Al(OH)₄⁻ complex ion:**\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) <=> Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹\n\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nTo find the solubility, we first need to determine the equilibrium concentration of hydroxide ions, [OH⁻]. We can do this by setting up a charge balance equation for all ions in the solution (Al³⁺, Al(OH)₄⁻, H⁺, OH⁻):\nTotal Positive Charge = Total Negative Charge\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [Al(OH)₄⁻] + [OH⁻]\n\nWe can express each concentration in terms of [OH⁻] and the equilibrium constants (including K_w = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴ for the autoionization of water, [H⁺][OH⁻] = K_w):\n*   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   From K_f and K_sp: [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻]\n*   From K_w: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n\nSubstituting these into the charge balance equation yields a single equation in terms of [OH⁻]. This equation can be solved for [OH⁻], which then allows us to calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species and the total solubility. The following Python code performs these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nK_sp = 5.3e-27\nK_f = 1.1e31\nK_w = 1.0e-14\n\n# The charge balance equation leads to a quadratic equation for x = [OH-]^2 of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0\n# The coefficients are:\na = 1 + K_f * K_sp\nb = -K_w\nc = -3 * K_sp\n\n# Solve the quadratic equation for x = [OH-]^2\n# x = [-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a (we take the positive root)\ndiscriminant = math.sqrt(b**2 - 4 * a * c)\nx = (-b + discriminant) / (2 * a)\n\n# Calculate [OH-]\noh_conc = math.sqrt(x)\n\n# Now calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species\nal3_conc = K_sp / (oh_conc**3)\naloh4_conc = K_f * K_sp * oh_conc\n\n# The total solubility (S) is the sum of the concentrations of the aluminum species\nsolubility = al3_conc + aloh4_conc\n\nprint(\"This script calculates the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water considering complex ion formation.\\n\")\nprint(f\"Calculated equilibrium [OH-] = {oh_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"Calculated equilibrium [Al^3+] = {al3_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"Calculated equilibrium [Al(OH)4-] = {aloh4_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\\n\")\nprint(\"The total solubility (S) is given by the sum of the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species:\")\nprint(f\"S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4-]\")\nprint(f\"S = {al3_conc:.3e} mol L^-1 + {aloh4_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"S = {solubility:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n\n# The problem asks for the answer in mol L^-1.\n# The variable 'solubility' holds this value.\nfinal_answer = f\"<<<{solubility:.3e}>>>\"\nprint(final_answer)\n\n```"
