    Calculates the exact value of l(d) based on analytical derivation.

    The function f(d, p, o) is defined as a limit of a fraction N(x)/D(x) as x -> infinity.

    1. Numerator Analysis (N(x)):
    The terms in the numerator are:
    N(x) = 1 + exp(-2x)*dist(g_o(x), p) + exp(-2x)*(x+1)^(1+1/x) - ||g_o(2x)||_2 - exp(-2x)*x*(1 - x^(1/(x+sqrt(d))))
    - The term ||g_o(2x)||_2 is tanh(x). As x -> inf, 1 - tanh(x) = 2*exp(-2x) / (1 + exp(-2x)), which approaches 0.
    - All other terms contain a factor of exp(-2x). For large x, these terms also approach 0. For example, exp(-2x) * dist(g_o(x), p) behaves like exp(-2x) * x, which goes to 0.
    Therefore, the numerator N(x) converges to 0 as x -> infinity. A more detailed asymptotic analysis shows N(x) ~ 2*x*exp(-2x).

    2. Denominator Analysis (D(x)):
    The denominator is:
    D(x) = Product_{k=1 to inf}(1 + 16x^2/(pi^2*(2k-1)^2)) - 2 * Product_{k=1 to inf}(x + 4x^3/(pi^2*k^2))
    - The first product is the standard infinite product expansion for cosh(2x).
      cosh(2x) grows exponentially as (e^(2x))/2.
    - The second product term can be written as: -2 * Product_{k=1 to inf} x * (1 + 4x^2/(pi^2*k^2)).
      The term 'x' is factored out for each k from 1 to infinity. For any x > 1, this product diverges.
      Let P_N(x) = Product_{k=1 to N} x * (...), then P_N(x) = x^N * Product_{k=1 to N}(...).
      As N -> inf, x^N -> inf, and the second part converges to sinh(2x)/(2x). So the entire product diverges to +infinity.
    - Therefore, D(x) = cosh(2x) - (divergent term to +inf), which tends to -infinity for large x.

    3. Limit Calculation:
    The limit is f(d, p, o) = lim_{x->inf} N(x)/D(x).
    This is of the form 0 / (-infinity), which evaluates to 0.
    The result f(d, p, o) = 0 is independent of d, p, and o.

    4. Final value l(d):
    l(d) = min_o f(d, p, o) = min_o(0) = 0.
    The final equation is l(d) = 0.
