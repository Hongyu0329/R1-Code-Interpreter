    "To find the rule activation level, we need to apply a t-norm operation to the given fuzzy membership values. A t-norm is a function that models a fuzzy logical 'AND'. The most common and standard t-norm is the minimum operator, `min(a, b)`.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define two variables for the given values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these two values to find the rule activation level.\n3.  Print the equation and the final calculated value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given membership values\nphi_k = 0.7\nmu_g = 0.9\n\n# The t-norm operation combines the membership values. We will use the most\n# common t-norm, which is the minimum operator.\nactivation_level = np.minimum(phi_k, mu_g)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(\"The rule activation level (w) is calculated using the minimum t-norm operation:\")\nprint(f\"w = min({phi_k}, {mu_g}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
