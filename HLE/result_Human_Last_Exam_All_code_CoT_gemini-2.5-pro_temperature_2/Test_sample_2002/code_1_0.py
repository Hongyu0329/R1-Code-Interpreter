def find_winning_strategy_for_p2():
    """
    Solves the token game to find for which initial number of tokens T
    the second player (P2) has a winning strategy.

    The analysis of the game reveals that it belongs to a class of games
    whose winning and losing positions are determined by the Fibonacci sequence.
    A position is a 'losing position' if the player about to move will lose if
    the opponent plays optimally. The second player has a winning strategy if
    the starting number of tokens T is a losing position for the first player.

    Through analysis of small cases:
    - T=1: P1 has no moves, so P2 wins.
    - T=2: P1 must take 1, leaving 1. P2 can take up to 2*1=2 tokens, so P2 wins.
    - T=3: P1 can take 1 or 2. In both cases, P2 can take the remaining tokens and win.
    - T=4: P1 can take 1, which leads to a situation where P1 will win. So P1 wins for T=4.
    - T=5: P2 has a winning strategy. This is a Fibonacci number.

    The pattern that emerges is that P2 has a winning strategy if and only if T is a
    Fibonacci number. The sequence starts {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...}.
    This script generates and prints these numbers.
    The instruction 'output each number in the final equation' is interpreted
    as printing the values for T which form the solution set.
