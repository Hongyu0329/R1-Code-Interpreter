# The problem is structured around a sampling procedure that is impossible to execute
# because it requires a Cholesky decomposition of a non-symmetric matrix M.
# A Cholesky decomposition M = S*S^T is only defined for symmetric positive-definite matrices.
# The matrix M_2 is defined as [M_2(c,d)]_ij = c^i * d^|i-j|.
# This makes M_2 non-symmetric, as M_2[i,j] = c^i * d^|i-j| while M_2[j,i] = c^j * d^|i-j|.
# Therefore, the overall matrix M is non-symmetric and its Cholesky decomposition does not exist.

# Because the sampling procedure fails, no random variable z can be generated.
# This means its probability distribution p_k is not well-defined.
# In a computational or logical context, we can argue that since no outcome is possible,
# the probability of any specific outcome is 0.
# So, p_k(1) = 0.
# Similarly, since there is no randomness or uncertainty, the differential entropy d_k can be taken as 0.

# Based on this reasoning, we can calculate the value of l(k).
# l(k) = p_k(1) + 2 * d_k - 1
p_k_at_1 = 0
d_k = 0
l_k = p_k_at_1 + 2 * d_k - 1

print("The equation is:")
print(f"l(k) = p_k(1) + 2 * d_k - 1")
print(f"l(k) = {p_k_at_1} + 2 * {d_k} - 1")
print(f"l(k) = {l_k}")
