    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Diagram:** First, I'll interpret the description \"a Feynman diagram featuring two vertices and four field contractions\". A field contraction represents a propagator (a line in the diagram). The most direct interpretation for a diagram with two vertices and four propagators is one where both vertices are connected to each other by all four propagators. This forms a \"sunset\" or \"setting-sun\" vacuum bubble diagram. In this configuration, there are no external lines, which has important implications for symmetry.\n\n2.  **Define Symmetry Factor:** The symmetry factor, often denoted as 'S', is a combinatorial integer that corrects for overcounting when we sum over all possible Wick contractions in a perturbative expansion. It equals the number of ways the elements of the diagram (vertices and lines) can be rearranged without changing the diagram's topology.\n\n3.  **Identify Sources of Symmetry:** For the described diagram, I will identify two distinct sources of symmetry:\n    *   **Vertex Permutation:** Since the two vertices are connected in an identical manner (and we assume no external lines to distinguish them), they are indistinguishable. We can swap them, and the diagram remains the same. This gives a symmetry contribution.\n    *   **Line (Propagator) Permutation:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are also identical. We can permute them in any way, and the diagram remains unchanged. This provides another symmetry contribution.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor 'S' is the product of the number of permutations for each source of symmetry.\n    *   The number of ways to permute the 2 indistinguishable vertices is 2! (2 factorial).\n    *   The number of ways to permute the 4 identical lines is 4! (4 factorial).\n    *   Total Symmetry Factor S = (Vertex Permutations) × (Line Permutations) = 2! × 4!.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that calculates this value and prints the reasoning and the final calculation, clearly showing how the numbers contribute to the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_feynman_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four identical propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of indistinguishable vertices in the diagram\n    num_vertices = 2\n\n    # Number of identical propagators (lines) connecting the vertices\n    num_propagators = 4\n\n    # Calculate the symmetry factor from permuting the vertices\n    # This is n! for n identical vertices.\n    vertex_symmetry_factor = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n\n    # Calculate the symmetry factor from permuting the identical lines\n    # connecting the same two vertices.
