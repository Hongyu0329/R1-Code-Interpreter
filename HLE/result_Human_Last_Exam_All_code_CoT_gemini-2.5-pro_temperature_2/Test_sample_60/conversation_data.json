    "My plan is to simulate each of the three Turing Machines provided and count the number of steps each one takes before it halts. The machine that takes the most steps is the answer.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n1.  **Interpret the Rules:** I'll interpret the rule strings for each machine. Based on the format, it appears to be a list of rules for 5 states (A, B, C, D, E), with two rules per state (one for reading a '0' and one for reading a '1'). For example, in the first machine, the first two rules `B1L` and `B0R` correspond to State A reading a 0 and 1 respectively. Each rule `SVD` means: transition to state `S`, write value `V`, and move the tape head in direction `D` (L for Left, R for Right). The state 'H' is the halting state.\n\n2.  **Create a Simulator:** I will write a Python function that can simulate a Turing Machine given its rules. This simulator will need to keep track of:\n    *   The tape, which can be thought of as an infinite line of cells, initially all containing '0'. A dictionary is a good data structure for this, as it can grow dynamically.\n    *   The current state of the machine (e.g., 'A', 'B', ...).\n    *   The current position of the tape head.\n    *   The number of steps taken.\n\n3.  **Run the Simulation:** The simulation for each machine starts in state 'A' at position 0 on an empty tape. It proceeds step-by-step:\n    a. Read the symbol on the tape at the current head position.\n    b. Find the corresponding rule for the current state and symbol.\n    c. If the rule leads to the 'H' (Halt) state, the simulation ends.\n    d. Otherwise, update the tape with the new symbol, change to the new state, move the head, and increment the step counter.\n    e. To prevent potential infinite loops, I'll set a high step limit (e.g., 50 million steps). If a machine reaches this limit, it will be considered non-halting for the purpose of this problem.\n\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** After running the simulation for all three machines, I will compare their final step counts. The machine with the highest count is the winner. The program will print which machine it is and the number of steps it took.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef simulate_turing_machine(rules_string: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a Turing Machine based on a given rule string.\n\n    Args:\n        rules_string: A space-separated string of 3-character rules.\n\n    Returns:\n        The number of steps until the machine halts.
