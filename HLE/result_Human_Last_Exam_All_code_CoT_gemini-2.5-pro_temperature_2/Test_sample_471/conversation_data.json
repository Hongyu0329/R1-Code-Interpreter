    "To solve this problem, we will use a fundamental result from Morse theory, which connects the topology of a manifold to the properties of smooth functions defined on it.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the mathematical framework:** The problem is about finding the minimum number of critical points of a smooth function on a compact manifold (the 2-torus, $T^2$). This is a classic problem addressed by Morse theory.\n2.  **Use the Morse Inequalities:** The Morse inequalities provide a lower bound for the number of critical points. Specifically, for a Morse function $f$ on a manifold $M$, the number of critical points of index $k$, denoted $c_k(f)$, must be at least the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold, $b_k(M)$. This implies that the total number of critical points must be at least the sum of the Betti numbers. This result also holds for any smooth function, not just Morse functions.\n3.  **Determine the Betti Numbers of the 2-Torus ($T^2$):**\n    *   $b_0$: The number of connected components. The torus is one connected object, so $b_0 = 1$.\n    *   $b_1$: The number of one-dimensional \"holes\". A torus has two independent circular directions (one around the \"donut\" and one through the \"hole\"), so $b_1 = 2$.\n    *   $b_2$: The number of two-dimensional \"voids\". The torus encloses a single space, so $b_2 = 1$.\n4.  **Calculate the Lower Bound:** Sum the Betti numbers to find the minimal number of critical points: $C(f) \\ge b_0 + b_1 + b_2$.\n5.  **Confirm the Bound is Achievable:** Verify that there exists a smooth function on the torus that has exactly this number of critical points. A standard example is the height function of a torus placed \"sideways\" in Euclidean 3-space, which has one minimum, one maximum, and two saddle points, for a total of four critical points.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this minimal number by summing the Betti numbers of the 2-torus.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points_on_torus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus\n    using Morse theory and Betti numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2) describe its topological properties.\n    # b_0 is the number of connected components.\n    b_0 = 1\n    # b_1 is the number of 1-dimensional \"holes\".\n    b_1 = 2\n    # b_2 is the number of 2-dimensional \"voids\".\n    b_2 = 1\n\n    print(\"To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function f: T^2 -> R, we use Morse Theory.\")\n    print(\"The total number of critical points is bounded below by the sum of the Betti numbers of the manifold T^2.\\n\")\n    print(f\"The Betti numbers for the 2-torus are:\")\n    print(f\"b_0 = {b_0} (number of connected components)\")\n    print(f\"b_1 = {b_1} (number of 1-dimensional holes)\")\n    print(f\"b_2 = {b_2} (number of 2-dimensional voids)\\n\")\n    \n    # According to the Morse inequalities, the total number of critical points must be at least the sum of the Betti numbers.\n    min_critical_points = b_0 + b_1 + b_2\n    \n    print(\"The minimal number of critical points is the sum of these Betti numbers.\")\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{b_0} + {b_1} + {b_2} = {min_critical_points}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis bound is achievable.
