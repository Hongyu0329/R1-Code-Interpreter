    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Formula:** The rank of the Néron-Severi group of the d-th symmetric power of a curve C, denoted as $\\rho(C^{(d)})$, is related to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian, $\\rho(Jac(C))$. The formula is:\n    $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(Jac(C)) + 1$\n    Note that the degree of the symmetric power, in this case, d=15, does not affect the rank.\n\n2.  **Determine the Bounds for the Jacobian:** The rank $\\rho(Jac(C))$ depends on the specific geometry of the curve C. Its value is bounded by the genus, g. For a curve of genus g, the bounds for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian are:\n    *   **Minimum:** $\\rho_{min}(Jac(C)) = 1$. This is achieved for a generic curve.\n    *   **Maximum:** $\\rho_{max}(Jac(C)) = g^2$. This is achieved for special curves, for example, those whose Jacobian is a product of elliptic curves with complex multiplication.\n\n3.  **Apply to the Specific Problem:**\n    *   The given curve C has genus g = 3.\n    *   We will calculate the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(Jac(C))$ using g=3.\n    *   Finally, we will use the formula from step 1 to find the smallest and largest possible ranks for X, the 15th symmetric power.\n\n4.  **Code the Solution:** I will write a Python script that implements these steps and prints the final calculation for both the smallest and largest possible ranks.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    for the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The genus of the Riemann surface C\n    g = 3\n    \n    print(f\"The curve C has genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^(15) is given by the formula: rho(X) = rho(Jac(C)) + 1.\")\n    print(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian, rho(Jac(C)), is bounded by 1 <= rho(Jac(C)) <= g^2.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Smallest possible rank\n    # This occurs for a generic curve C, where rho(Jac(C)) = 1.\n    rho_jac_min = 1\n    rho_X_min = rho_jac_min + 1\n    print(\"Calculating the smallest possible rank:\")\n    print(f\"The minimum rank for rho(Jac(C)) is {rho_jac_min}.\")\n    print(f\"Smallest rank of NS(X) = {rho_jac_min} + 1 = {rho_X_min}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Largest possible rank\n    # This occurs for a special curve C, where rho(Jac(C)) = g^2.\n    rho_jac_max = g**2\n    rho_X_max = rho_jac_max + 1\n    print(\"Calculating the largest possible rank:\")\n    print(f\"The maximum rank for rho(Jac(C)) is g^2 = {g}^2 = {rho_jac_max}.\")\n    print(f\"Largest rank of NS(X) = {rho_jac_max} + 1 = {rho_X_max}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\nsolve_neron_severi_rank()\n\n```\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
