# Based on the mathematical derivation, the expression
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / ((pi^2/6) - 1) + 10^15
# simplifies to 1 + 10^15.

# This script will confirm this by calculating the components
# and then computing the final result.

# Step 1: Analytically, the fraction part of the expression simplifies to 1.
# We calculate it here to demonstrate.
pi_val = math.pi
denominator = (pi_val**2 / 6) - 1
alpha_norm_squared = 0.5 * denominator
numerator = 2 * alpha_norm_squared
fraction_value = numerator / denominator # This will be 1.0

# Step 2: The second term in the sum is 10^15.
constant_term = 10**15

# Step 3: The final result is the sum of these two terms.
final_result = fraction_value + constant_term

# As requested, here are the numbers in the final simplified equation.
# The final equation is: 1 + 10^15 = result
