def solve_algebra_problem():
    """
    This function solves a specific problem from tensor-triangulated geometry.

    The problem asks to identify which of 20 specific objects generate a prime
    tt-ideal in a category related to representations of the cyclic group C_p,
    and how many prime ideals are not generated by this list. The problem is
    understood to be set for characteristic p=5.

    Based on the mathematical theory of Balmer spectra for these categories:
    - For p=5, there are p+1 = 6 prime tt-ideals.
    - An analysis of the 20 objects identifies the following as generators
      of prime ideals:
        - 3 ([p-1](0)): generates a ghost prime (P_gh,4).
        - 5 (gap^1): generates the ghost prime P_gh,1.
        - 6 (gap^{p-1}): generates the ghost prime P_gh,4.
        - 15 (S): generates the trivial prime P_triv.
        - 16, 17 (S tensored with large objects): also generate P_triv.
        - 18, 19, 20 (tensor products of distinct prime generators): are zero
          and thus generate the zero ideal, P_gen.
    - This covers 4 of the 6 prime ideals (P_gen, P_triv, P_gh,1, P_gh,4).
    - The remaining 2 prime ideals (P_gh,2, P_gh,3) are not generated by
      any object on the list.
