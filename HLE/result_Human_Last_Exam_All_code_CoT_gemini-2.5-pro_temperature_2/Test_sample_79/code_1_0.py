    print("Analyzing the statements based on the provided population genetics scenario:\n")

    # Analysis of Statement 1
    print("Statement 1: There is no selection occurring on the phenotype measured.")
    print("  - The problem states the phenotype has 'no bearing on fitness' and 'all genotypes have equal fitness'.")
    print("  - This is the definition of an absence of natural selection.")
    print("  - Conclusion: Statement 1 must be true.\n")

    # Analysis of Statement 2
    print("Statement 2: Parents will not raise their offspring.")
    print("  - The problem states 'discrete and non-overlapping generations'.")
    print("  - This is a common modeling assumption that means the parental generation is gone by the time the offspring generation reproduces. It simplifies analysis but does not forbid parental care behavior before the parents die.")
    print("  - Conclusion: Statement 2 does not have to be true.\n")

    # Analysis of Statement 3
    print("Statement 3: The population will never speciate even in future generations.")
    print("  - The conditions given (no selection, no mutation, no drift, etc.) are only stated as 'currently true'.")
    print("  - There is no guarantee these conditions will persist indefinitely. Future changes could introduce evolutionary pressures leading to speciation.")
    print("  - Conclusion: Statement 3 does not have to be true.\n")

    # Analysis of Statement 4
    print("Statement 4: The researcher will not find a substantial difference in the phenotype measured between the west and east groups of individuals.")
    print("  - The trait's broad-sense heritability (H^2) is 0.7. This means Total Phenotypic Variance (VP) is composed of 70% Genetic Variance (VG) and 30% Environmental Variance (VE).")
    print("  - While random mating keeps gene frequencies uniform, the environment might not be uniform across the entire region.")
    print("  - A systematic environmental difference between the west and east halves (e.g., different sunlight or nutrient levels) could cause a substantial difference in the average phenotype, as VE is a non-zero component of the trait's variance.")
    print("  - Conclusion: Statement 4 does not have to be true.\n")

    print("--------------------------------------------------")
    print("Final Conclusion: Only Statement 1 must always be true based on the information given.")
    print("This corresponds to answer choice A.")
