    "Here is my plan to solve the equation:\n1.  First, I will convert each Roman numeral in the equation to its corresponding modern number.\n    *   `VIII` = 8\n    *   `C` = 100\n    *   `CCXVI` = 200 + 10 + 6 = 216\n2.  Next, I will substitute these modern numbers back into the equation, which becomes: `8 / 100 - 216`.\n3.  Then, I will perform the calculation following the order of operations (division first, then subtraction).\n4.  Finally, I will use a Python script to compute and print the full equation with the final result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the modern numbers corresponding to the Roman numerals.\nnum_viii = 8\nnum_c = 100\nnum_ccxvi = 216\n\n# Step 2: Perform the calculation following the order of operations (division then subtraction).\nresult = (num_viii / num_c) - num_ccxvi\n\n# Step 3: Print the full equation with the final result.\nprint(f\"{num_viii} / {num_c} - {num_ccxvi} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-215.92>>>"
