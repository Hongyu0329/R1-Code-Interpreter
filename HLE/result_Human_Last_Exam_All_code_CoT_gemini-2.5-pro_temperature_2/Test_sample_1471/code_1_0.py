# Step 1: Define the modern numbers corresponding to the Roman numerals.
num_viii = 8
num_c = 100
num_ccxvi = 216

# Step 2: Perform the calculation following the order of operations (division then subtraction).
result = (num_viii / num_c) - num_ccxvi

# Step 3: Print the full equation with the final result.
print(f"{num_viii} / {num_c} - {num_ccxvi} = {result}")
