    print("A. Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class.")
    print("   Verdict: TRUE. This is due to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) constraint `sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0` in the dual problem. If all support vectors (where `alpha_i > 0`) belong to one class (e.g., `y_i = 1`), the sum would be strictly positive, violating the constraint. Thus, support vectors from both classes are required.\n")

    print("B. With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM.")
    print("   Verdict: TRUE. In cost-sensitive SVM, we can assign a higher penalty for misclassifying the minority class. This often results in an optimal decision boundary that is shifted, creating unequal geometric margins to better protect the minority class.\n")

    print("C. Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels.")
    print("   Verdict: TRUE. This is the famous 'kernel trick'. For example, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, K(x, z) = exp(-gamma * ||x-z||^2), allows us to compute dot products in an infinite-dimensional feature space without ever explicitly calculating the coordinates of the data in that space.\n")

    print("D. It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points.")
    print("   Verdict: TRUE. The SVM decision boundary is defined only by the support vectors (the points on or within the margin). Interior points are not support vectors, and they can be moved or added without changing the boundary, as long as they don't cross the margin.\n")

    print("E. Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer.")
    print("   Verdict: FALSE. This general mathematical statement is not true without further conditions. A strictly convex function only has a unique minimizer if a minimizer exists. A counterexample is f(x) = e^x on the domain of all real numbers. It is strictly convex, but its value approaches an infimum of 0 as x approaches negative infinity; it never attains a minimum value.")
