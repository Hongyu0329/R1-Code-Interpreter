    Calculates and prints the upper bound H for the given problem.

    The problem is to estimate the integral |∫(f(τ,x)/ρ(τ,x))dτ| from 0 to t.
    We derived the upper bound H to be:
    H = (-k * ||ρ(0,.)||_L1 * t) / (π * ν^2 * r)
    where r is a positive lower bound for ρ(τ,x), i.e., ρ(τ,x) >= r > 0.

    a = k (a negative constant)
    b = ||ρ(0,.)||_L1 (L1 norm of the initial function)
