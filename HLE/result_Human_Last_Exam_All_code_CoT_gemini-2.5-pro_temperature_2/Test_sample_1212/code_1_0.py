    Analyzes the Go puzzle to find all killing moves for White.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. The critical points for the Black group's life are identified as
       {A1, A3, A4, B1, B2}. These are the points Black needs to form two eyes.
    2. We test each of these five points as a potential first move for White.
    3. Scenario 1: White plays the central point B2. This creates a "nakade"
       (a dead internal shape). Black cannot form two eyes from the remaining
       2x2 space, so B2 is a killing move.
    4. Scenario 2: White plays a peripheral point from {A1, A3, A4, B1}.
       - Black's only viable response is to play at B2 to connect his groups
         and form one eye.
       - After this exchange, it is White's turn. The remaining eye space
         is a 3-point area.
       - With White to play on a 3-point space, White can prevent Black from
         forming a second eye.
       - Therefore, all four peripheral points are also killing moves.
