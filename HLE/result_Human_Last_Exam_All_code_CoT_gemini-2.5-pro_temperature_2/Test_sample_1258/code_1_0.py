    This function returns the analytical expression for the magnetometric
    demagnetizing factor of a cylinder, which matches the provided constraints.

    The standard formula for the FLUXMETRIC demagnetizing factor (N_f) is:
    N_f = 1 - g / sqrt(1 + g**2)
    This is a simple algebraic expression and does not use elliptic integrals.

    However, the provided modulus k^2 = 1/(1 + g^2/4) and the mention of
    elliptic integrals F(k) and E(k) point to the formula for the
    MAGNETOMETRIC demagnetizing factor (N_m). This code provides the expression
    for N_m.
