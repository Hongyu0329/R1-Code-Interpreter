# Step 1: Define the given probability of measuring |0⟩ in the output state.
# This is provided in the problem statement.
p_out_0 = 0.36

# Step 2: Calculate the probability of measuring |1⟩.
# In a single-qubit system, the probabilities of measuring |0⟩ and |1⟩ must sum to 1.
# So, P_out(1) = 1 - P_out(0).
p_out_1 = 1 - p_out_0

# Step 3: Set up the equation based on our interpretation of the problem's properties.
# The literal statement of Property 1 leads to a contradiction.
# We interpret it as P_out(1) = (|α|²)², linking the output measurement to the input state's probability.
# This allows for a consistent solution. Let's call |α|² as 'alpha_squared'.
# The equation is: (alpha_squared)² = p_out_1

# Step 4: Solve the equation for |α|².
# We take the square root of p_out_1 to find alpha_squared.
alpha_squared = math.sqrt(p_out_1)

# Step 5: Display the calculation steps as requested.
