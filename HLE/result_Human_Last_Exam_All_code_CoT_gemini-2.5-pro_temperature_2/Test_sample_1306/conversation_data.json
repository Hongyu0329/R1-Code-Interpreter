    "To determine the percentage of irreducible objects in the category $C$ of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $q$ a primitive third root of unity, we first need to understand the structure of this category.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1.  **Identify the algebraic structure**: The quantum group is $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ with $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$. The representation theory depends on the parameter $l$, which is the multiplicative order of $q^2$. Since $q^2=e^{4\\pi i/3}$, its order is $l=3$.\n2.  **Decompose the category**: The category of finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is a direct sum of subcategories called \"blocks\". For $l=3$, there are two blocks.\n3.  **Analyze the blocks**:\n    *   One block, let's call it $B_1$, contains only the simple module $L(3)$ (a 3-dimensional representation). This module is also indecomposable, projective, and injective. So, this block contains exactly one indecomposable object, which is irreducible.\n    *   The other block, $B_0$, is the \"principal block\". It contains the simple modules $L(1)$ and $L(2)$. For $l=3$, which is odd, the principal block is of finite representation type. More specifically, its structure is described by a Brauer tree algebra of type $A_{l-1}$. For $l=3$, this is the tree $A_2$, which is a line segment with 2 vertices and 1 edge.\n4.  **Count the objects in each block**:\n    *   For block $B_1$: Number of irreducible objects = 1. Number of indecomposable objects = 1.\n    *   For the principal block $B_0$:\n        *   The number of irreducible objects is the number of simple modules it contains, which is $l-1 = 3-1 = 2$.\n        *   The number of indecomposable modules for a Brauer tree algebra without exceptional vertices (which is our case) can be calculated from the structure of the tree. For a tree with $|V|$ vertices and $|E|$ edges, the number of indecomposable modules (all of which are \"string modules\") is $|V| + |E|(|E|+1)/2$. For the tree $A_2$, we have $|V|=2$ vertices and $|E|=1$ edge. Thus, the number of indecomposable modules is $2 + 1(1+1)/2 = 2+1=3$.\n5.  **Calculate the total numbers and the percentage**:\n    *   Total number of irreducible objects = (from $B_0$) + (from $B_1$) = $2 + 1 = 3$.\n    *   Total number of indecomposable objects = (from $B_0$) + (from $B_1$) = $3 + 1 = 4$.\n    *   The percentage of irreducible objects is the ratio of these two numbers, multiplied by 100.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The parameter l is the order of q^2, where q is a primitive 3rd root of unity.\n# q = exp(2*pi*i/3), q^2 = exp(4*pi*i/3). The order of q^2 is 3.\nl = 3\n\n# Number of simple modules in the principal block.\nnum_irreducible_principal_block = l - 1\n\n# Number of indecomposable modules in the principal block.\n# This block's structure corresponds to a Brauer tree A_{l-1}.\n# The number of vertices in this tree is |V| = l-1.\n# The number of edges is |E| = l-2.\nnum_vertices = l - 1\nnum_edges = l - 2\n# The number of indecomposables is |V| + |E|*(|E|+1)/2\nnum_indecomposable_principal_block = num_vertices + (num_edges * (num_edges + 1)) // 2\n\n# The other block contains L(l), which is both irreducible and indecomposable.\nnum_irreducible_other_block = 1\nnum_indecomposable_other_block = 1\n\n# Calculate total numbers across all blocks.\ntotal_irreducible_objects = num_irreducible_principal_block + num_irreducible_other_block\ntotal_indecomposable_objects = num_indecomposable_principal_block + num_indecomposable_other_block\n\n# Calculate the percentage.\npercentage = (total_irreducible_objects / total_indecomposable_objects) * 100\n\nprint(f\"Total number of irreducible objects: {total_irreducible_objects}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of indecomposable objects: {total_indecomposable_objects}\")\nprint(f\"The percentage of irreducible objects is ({total_irreducible_objects} / {total_indecomposable_objects}) * 100.\")\nprint(f\"Result: {percentage}%\")\n```\n<<<75.0>>>"
