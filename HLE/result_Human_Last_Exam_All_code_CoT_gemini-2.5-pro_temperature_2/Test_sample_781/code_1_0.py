# The problem defines a special type of topological space X with 5 distinguished points.
# We are asked for the largest number 'n' of subcontinua in a minimal decomposition of X.
# Our step-by-step analysis concluded that the structure of this space is
# fundamentally determined by the connections between pairs of these 5 points.
# Therefore, the maximum number n corresponds to the number of ways to choose a pair
# of points from the set of 5, which is a combinatorial calculation C(5, 2).

num_points = 5
pair_size = 2

# Calculate the number of combinations
n = math.comb(num_points, pair_size)

# To display the full equation as requested, we calculate the factorials
num_points_factorial = math.factorial(num_points)
pair_size_factorial = math.factorial(pair_size)
diff_factorial = math.factorial(num_points - pair_size)

# Print the final result including the equation
print("The largest number n is given by the binomial coefficient C(5, 2).")
print(f"The calculation is C({num_points}, {pair_size}) = {num_points}! / ({pair_size}! * ({num_points}-{pair_size})!)")
print(f"n = {num_points_factorial} / ({pair_size_factorial} * {diff_factorial}) = {int(n)}")
