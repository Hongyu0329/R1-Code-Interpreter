    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Model SKI Combinators in Python:** I will create Python classes to represent the S, K, and I combinators, as well as function application (`App`). Making these classes properly comparable and hashable is crucial for efficiency.\n2.  **Construct the Expression:** The provided SKI expression is complex. I will manually construct this expression tree using the classes defined in step 1. This avoids any ambiguity from parsing the string representation. I will assume standard left-associative application, e.g., `A B C` means `((A B) C)`.\n3.  **Implement a Reduction Engine:** I will write a function that performs SKI reduction. It will repeatedly scan the expression and apply the reduction rules (`S f g x` -> `f x (g x)`, `K x y` -> `x`, `I x` -> `x`) following a leftmost, outermost evaluation strategy until no more reductions are possible. I'll use memoization (caching) to handle the repetitive computations that arise during reduction.\n4.  **Evaluate the Church Numeral:** The problem states the expression is a Church numeral, `n`. A Church numeral is a function that takes two arguments, `f` and `x`, and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times. To find `n`, I will apply the reduced SKI expression to two symbolic variables representing `f` and `x`, and then reduce this new expression.\n5.  **Extract the Integer `n`:** The final, fully reduced expression should have the form `f(f(...f(x)...))`. I'll write a helper function to traverse this structure and count the number of applications of `f` to get the integer `n`.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** With the value of `n`, I will compute `log_2(n)` and print the result as a complete equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\nfrom functools import total_ordering\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by modeling SKI combinator logic in Python,\n    reducing the given expression to a Church numeral, and then\n    calculating the required logarithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a higher recursion limit for deep object hashing and representation.\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(20000)\n\n    # Step 1: Define hashable data structures for combinators, variables, and applications.\n    @total_ordering\n    class S:\n        def __repr__(self): return \"S\"\n        def __eq__(self, other): return isinstance(other, S)\n        def __lt__(self, other): return type(other).__name__ > \"S\"\n        def __hash__(self): return hash(\"S\")\n\n    @total_ordering\n    class K:\n        def __repr__(self): return \"K\"\n        def __eq__(self, other): return isinstance(other, K)\n        def __lt__(self, other):\n            if isinstance(other, S): return False\n            return type(other).__name__ > \"K\"\n        def __hash__(self): return hash(\"K\")\n\n    @total_ordering\n    class I:\n        def __repr__(self): return \"I\"\n        def __eq__(self, other): return isinstance(other, I)\n        def __lt__(self, other):\n            if isinstance(other, (S, K)): return False\n            return type(other).__name__ > \"I\"\n        def __hash__(self): return hash(\"I\")\n\n    @total_ordering\n    class Var:\n        def __init__(self, name): self.name = name\n        def __repr__(self): return self.name\n        def __eq__(self, other): return isinstance(other, Var) and self.name == other.name\n        def __lt__(self, other):\n            if not isinstance(other, Var): return True\n            return self.name < other.name\n        def __hash__(self): return hash(self.name)\n\n    @total_ordering\n    class App:\n        def __init__(self, f, x):\n            self.f = f\n            self.x = x\n            self._hash = None\n        def __repr__(self): return f\"({self.f!r} {self.x!r})\"\n        def __eq__(self, other): return isinstance(other, App) and self.f == other.f and self.x == other.x\n        def __lt__(self, other):\n            if not isinstance(other, App): return True\n            if self.f != other.f: return self.f < other.f\n            return self.x < other.x\n        def __hash__(self):\n            if self._hash is None: self._hash = hash((self.f, self.x))\n            return self._hash\n\n    _reduction_cache = {}\n\n    def reduce_expr(expr):\n        \"\"\"Reduces an expression to its normal form using a cache.\"\"\"\n        original_expr = expr\n        if original_expr in _reduction_cache:\n            return _reduction_cache[original_expr]\n\n        current_expr = expr\n        # Use a loop to prevent deep recursion on the top-level reductions.\n        while True:\n            next_expr, changed = _reduce_step(current_expr)\n            if not changed:\n                _reduction_cache[original_expr] = next_expr\n                return next_expr\n            current_expr = next_expr\n\n    def _reduce_step(expr):\n        \"\"\"Performs one step of leftmost-outermost reduction.\"\"\"\n        if isinstance(expr, (S, K, I, Var)):\n            return expr, False\n        \n        # Outermost reduction: Check for S, K, I redexes at the top level.\n        # Rule S: S(f)(g)(x) -> f(x)(g(x))\n        if isinstance(expr.f, App) and isinstance(expr.f.f, App) and isinstance(expr.f.f.f, S):\n            f, g, x = expr.f.f.x, expr.f.x, expr.x\n            return App(App(f, x), App(g, x)), True\n\n        # Rule K: K(x)(y) -> x\n        if isinstance(expr.f, App) and isinstance(expr.f.f, K):\n            x = expr.f.x\n            return x, True\n\n        # Rule I: I(x) -> x\n        if isinstance(expr.f, I):\n            x = expr.x\n            return x, True\n        \n        # If no top-level redex, reduce sub-expressions (left first for leftmost strategy).\n        new_f, changed_f = _reduce_step(expr.f)\n        if changed_f:\n            return App(new_f, expr.x), True\n\n        new_x, changed_x = _reduce_step(expr.x)\n        if changed_x:\n            return App(expr.f, new_x), True\n            \n        return expr, False\n\n    def count_f_applications(expr, f_var, x_var):\n        \"\"\"Counts how many times `f_var` is applied in a Church numeral structure.\"\"\"\n        if expr == x_var:\n            return 0\n        if isinstance(expr, App) and expr.f == f_var:\n            return 1 + count_f_applications(expr.x, f_var, x_var)\n        raise ValueError(f\"Expression is not a simple Church Numeral form.
