    """
    Identifies the mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis from a predefined list.

    Mutualists are organisms that engage in a relationship where both species benefit.
    In this context, mutualists are the adult insects that act as pollinators or defenders.

    - Danaus plexipus (adults) are pollinators. (Mutualist)
    - Megachile spp. (adults) are pollinators. (Mutualist)
    - Formica rufa (adults) can act as defenders, feeding on nectar. (Mutualist)
    - Sphex ichneumoneus (adults) are pollinators. (Mutualist)
    - Pepsis thisbe (adults) are pollinators. (Mutualist)

    - Danaus plexipus (larvae) are herbivores. (Not a mutualist)
    - The larvae of the other listed insects do not interact directly with the plant. (Not mutualists)

    Therefore, the mutualists are the organisms with indices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
