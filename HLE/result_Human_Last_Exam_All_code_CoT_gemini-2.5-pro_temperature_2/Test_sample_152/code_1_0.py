    # Step 1: Determine the shape for Cell 9.
    # The shapes are in groups of three:
    # Cells 1-3: Circle
    # Cells 4-6: Square
    # Cells 7-9: Triangle
    # Therefore, Cell 9's shape is Triangle.
    shape = "Triangle"

    # Step 2: Determine the number of dots for Cell 9.
    # We observe an alternating operation between the 2nd and 3rd cell of each shape group.
    # - Circle Group: Cell 2 (4 dots) -> Cell 3 (2 dots). The operation is division by 2.
    # - Square Group: Cell 5 (1.5 dots) -> Cell 6 (3 dots). The operation is multiplication by 2.
    # The pattern alternates, so for the Triangle group, the operation is division by 2.
    # Cell 8 has 3 dots.

    # Step 3: Determine the arrow position for Cell 9.
    # The arrow position follows the same alternating operation.
    # - Circle Group: Cell 2 (4π/3 rad) -> Cell 3 (2π/3 rad). Division by 2.
    # - Square Group: Cell 5 (π/2 rad) -> Cell 6 (π rad). Multiplication by 2.
    # For the Triangle group, the operation is again division by 2.
    # Cell 8 has an arrow position of π radians.
    angle_cell_8_rad = math.pi
    angle_cell_9_rad = angle_cell_8_rad / 2

    # Step 4: Format the arrow position according to the specific rules.
    # Rule: Use radians if divisible by π/3, degrees otherwise.
    # We check if (angle_cell_9_rad / (π/3)) is a whole number.
    # (π/2) / (π/3) = 1.5, which is not a whole number.
    # Therefore, we must use degrees.
    angle_cell_9_deg = math.degrees(angle_cell_9_rad)
