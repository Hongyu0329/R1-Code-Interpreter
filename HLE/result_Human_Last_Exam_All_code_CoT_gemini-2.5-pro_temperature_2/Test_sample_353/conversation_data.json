    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Formulate the stability boundary:** The stability region of a linear multistep method is determined by its characteristic polynomial $\\pi(r, z) = \\rho(r) - z\\sigma(r)$. The boundary of this region, $\\partial S$, is the set of complex numbers $z$ for which $\\pi(r, z)$ has a root on the unit circle, i.e., $r = e^{i\\theta}$. This gives a parametric curve $z(\\theta) = \\rho(e^{i\\theta}) / \\sigma(e^{i\\theta})$. For the BDF4 method, the standard formulation yields the stability boundary function:\n    $z(\\theta) = \\frac{25}{12} - 4e^{-i\\theta} + 3e^{-i2\\theta} - \\frac{4}{3}e^{-i3\\theta} + \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i4\\theta}$.\n\n2.  **Define $A(\\alpha)$-stability:** A method is $A(\\alpha)$-stable if its stability region $S$ contains the angular sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha\\}$. This sector is a cone in the left half-plane, symmetric about the real axis, with its boundaries being rays at angles $\\pi-\\alpha$ and $\\pi+\\alpha$.\n\n3.  **Find the tangency condition:** The maximum angle $\\alpha$ is found when the boundary of the cone $S_\\alpha$ is tangent to the stability boundary $\\partial S$. At such a point of tangency, $z_t = z(\\theta_t)$, the position vector from the origin to $z_t$ is parallel to the tangent vector of the curve, $z'(\\theta_t)$. This leads to the condition that the derivative of the argument of $z(\\theta)$ is zero: $\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\arg(z(\\theta)) = 0$. Algebraically, this is equivalent to solving the equation $y'(\\theta)x(\\theta) - y(\\theta)x'(\\theta) = 0$, where $z(\\theta)=x(\\theta)+iy(\\theta)$.\n\n4.  **Solve for the angle of tangency:** This condition can be transformed into a polynomial equation for $c = \\cos(\\theta)$. For BDF4, this equation is a cubic:\n    $50c^3 - 136c^2 + 123c - 40 = 0$.\n    This cubic has three real roots. One root, $c > 1$, is irrelevant. The other two roots correspond to points on the unit circle. It is known from literature (Hairer & Wanner, 1996) that the root defining the stability angle is the largest root less than 1. Let's call this root $c_0$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the stability angle $\\alpha$:** Once the correct root $c_0 = \\cos(\\theta_0)$ is found, we determine the coordinates of the tangency point $z_0 = x_0 + iy_0 = z(\\theta_0)$. The argument of this point is $\\phi_0 = \\arctan(y_0/x_0)$. The stability boundary lobe for BDF4 lies in the right half-plane, tangent to the cone from the left. Thus, the ray of the cone boundary has the same argument as the point of tangency, $\\phi_0 = \\pi-\\alpha$. From this, we find $\\alpha = \\pi - \\phi_0 = \\pi - \\arctan(y_0/x_0)$. The final step is to express $\\alpha$ in terms of arctan and the calculated numerical values.\n\nI will now implement this plan in Python to find the numerical values and construct the final expression for $\\alpha$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
