No. Such a set and function do not necessarily exist. The provided Python code demonstrates the key principles behind constructing a counterexample in ZFC. First, it shows the diagonalization method used to build functions that grow faster than any countable set of predecessors. Second, it illustrates how a carefully constructed sequence of functions can have values at a specific coordinate that are cofinal in ω1, making them impossible to be bounded by a single function whose range is also ω1.
