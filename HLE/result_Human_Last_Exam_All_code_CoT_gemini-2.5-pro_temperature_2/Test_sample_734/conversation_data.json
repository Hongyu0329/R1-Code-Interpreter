    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the key components of your request:\n1.  **Theologian**: I need to identify a specific person, not a school of thought.\n2.  **Christian**: The person must be from within the Christian tradition.\n3.  **First developed**: This points to an early, foundational figure, likely in the Patristic or early Medieval period.\n4.  **Specialized terminology**: This implies the creation of a conceptual framework or specific terms to discuss the topic.\n5.  **Changes in the laws of nature**: The core philosophical/theological concept.\n6.  **Applicable to both the virgin birth and the Fall**: These are two specific theological events the terminology must address. The virgin birth is typically seen as a miracle (an act *outside* the normal laws of nature), while the Fall is often seen as an event that *altered* the state of nature itself (introducing death, decay, etc.).\n\nBased on these points, the most fitting answer is **Augustine of Hippo** (354â€“430 AD). He extensively wrote about miracles, creation, and God's providence. He argued that what we call \"laws of nature\" are simply God's consistent and ordinary will for creation. A miracle, like the virgin birth, is not something \"against nature\" in an absolute sense, but rather an act of God that is outside the *usual course* of nature that we are familiar with. He also discussed how the state of humanity and the natural world was altered after the Fall, which represents a change in how nature operates, at least in relation to humanity. This constitutes the development of a framework and terminology to address exactly the scenarios you described.\n\nTo meet the requirement of providing a code-based answer, I will now provide a Python script that prints the name of this theologian.\n\n```python\ndef solve_theological_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Christian theologian who first developed\n    specialized terminology applicable to changes in natural laws,\n    specifically concerning the virgin birth and the Fall.\n    \n    The key figure for this is Augustine of Hippo. He distinguished between\n    the ordinary course of nature (God's regular will) and miracles\n    (God's special will), and wrote about how nature's state was\n    altered by the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The name of the theologian who fits the description.\n    theologian = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    \n    # Print the answer to the user.\n    print(theologian)\n\nsolve_theological_query()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
