The problem asks for the smallest cardinality of a family F of topological spaces
such that any infinite topological space X contains a subspace homeomorphic to some
member of F.

Here is the logical deduction to find this number:

Step 1: Classification via Separation Axioms

We can classify any infinite topological space X based on the separation axioms it satisfies.

- If X is not a T0 space: There must be an infinite set of points that are all
  topologically indistinguishable from each other. Such a set, with the subspace
  topology, is an infinite indiscrete space. We can take a countably infinite
  subspace, which is homeomorphic to what we'll call T_indiscrete.

- If X is T0 but not T1: There's an associated partial order (the specialization
  order). Since the space is infinite, by Dilworth's Theorem, it must contain either
  an infinite chain or an infinite antichain. An infinite antichain would form a T1
  subspace. An infinite chain forms a subspace homeomorphic to the initial segment
  topology on a countable set. We'll call this space T_chain.

- If X is a T1 space (or contains an infinite T1 subspace): We need to analyze the
  possible structures of infinite T1 spaces.

This decomposition shows that any infinite space must contain a subspace
homeomorphic to T_indiscrete, T_chain, or some minimal type of T1 space.

Step 2: Analysis of Infinite T1 Spaces

A key theorem in topology states that any infinite T1 space must contain a
subspace homeomorphic to one of the following three spaces on a countably
infinite set:
  1. The discrete space (T_discrete).
  2. The cofinite space (T_cofinite).
  3. The convergent sequence space (T_special). This space has a unique non-isolated
     point, and its neighborhoods are the cofinite sets containing it.

Step 3: Forming a Universal Family

Combining these findings, any infinite topological space must contain a subspace
homeomorphic to a member of the following family of five spaces:
F_5 = {T_indiscrete, T_chain, T_discrete, T_cofinite, T_special}.

Step 4: Reducing the Family

We need the *smallest* such family. We can reduce F_5 if one member contains
another as a subspace. The space T_special (convergent sequence) consists of a
countably infinite set of isolated points and one limit point. The set of its
isolated points is itself an infinite discrete subspace, homeomorphic to T_discrete.

Therefore, if a space X has a subspace homeomorphic to T_special, it automatically
has a subspace homeomorphic to T_discrete. This means T_special is not required in
our fundamental family, as the cases it covers are already covered by T_discrete.
Our new, smaller family is:
F_4 = {T_indiscrete, T_chain, T_discrete, T_cofinite}.
The cardinality of this family is 4.

Step 5: Proving Minimality

To show that 4 is the smallest possible cardinality, we must demonstrate that no
family of size 3 will work. We do this by showing each of the four spaces in F_4
is essential.

- Consider the space X = T_indiscrete. Any infinite subspace of X is also
  indiscrete. It cannot be homeomorphic to T_chain, T_discrete, or T_cofinite.
  So, T_indiscrete is necessary.
- Consider X = T_chain. Any infinite subspace is homeomorphic to T_chain. It cannot
  be homeomorphic to the other three. So, T_chain is necessary.
- Consider X = T_discrete. Any infinite subspace is discrete. It cannot be
  homeomorphic to the other three. So, T_discrete is necessary.
- Consider X = T_cofinite. Any infinite subspace is cofinite. It cannot be
  homeomorphic to the other three. So, T_cofinite is necessary.

Since all four spaces are required, no smaller family is possible.
