    Analyzes the logic puzzle and presents the correct answer.
    The problem is that we have a contradiction:
    The initial rule is P→Q (If intruder, then bark).
    The evidence is P ∧ ¬Q (Intruder detected, but no bark).
    This means the initial rule P→Q must be incomplete or flawed.

    We need to find a new logical statement that explains how P ∧ ¬Q can be true.

    Let's analyze Choice C:
    P: The dog detects an intruder.
    Q: The dog barked.
    R: The dog was asleep.

    The statement is: [(P ∧ ¬R)→Q] ∧ (¬Q ∧ P),∴R

    Let's break it down:
    1.  [(P ∧ ¬R)→Q]: "If the dog detects an intruder AND is not asleep, then it will bark."
        This is a revised, more realistic premise. It states that being awake (¬R) is a necessary condition for the dog to bark at an intruder.

    2.  (¬Q ∧ P): "The dog did not bark AND the dog detected an intruder."
        This part of the statement represents the "verifiable proof" given in the problem.

    3.  ∴R: "Therefore, the dog was asleep."
        This conclusion is derived from the first two parts. If the dog barks only when it detects an intruder AND is awake, but we know it detected an intruder and did NOT bark, the only possible explanation is that the "awake" condition was not met. The dog must have been asleep.

    This logic is sound and provides a valid explanation for the observed facts without contradicting the given evidence.
