    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Determine the dimension of the system (n):** The dimension of the system of differential equations is the number of unknown functions $x_i(t)$. I will deduce this from the definition of the vector $x(t)$ and the boundary conditions.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k):** The problem provides a list of six boundary conditions. Some of these might be redundant (linearly dependent on others). I will determine the number of unique, independent conditions by setting up a coefficient matrix for these conditions and finding its rank.\n\n3.  **Calculate the index:** The index of a linear boundary-value problem of this form is given by the formula: `Index = k - n`. I will compute this value using the numbers found in the previous steps.\n\nI will implement this logic in a Python script. The script will explicitly define the coefficient matrix for the boundary conditions and use the `numpy` library to find its rank, ensuring a correct count of `k`. Finally, it will calculate and print the index.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_bvp_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the index of the given boundary-value problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system (n).\n    # The vector x(t) is defined as (x_1(t), x_2(t), ..., x_2024(t)).\n    # This means the system consists of 2024 differential equations.\n    n = 2024\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k).\n    # The given boundary conditions are:\n    # 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0\n    # 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0\n    # 3. 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0\n    # 4. 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0\n    # 5. 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0\n    # 6. 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0\n    #\n    # We can represent these conditions in a matrix form.
