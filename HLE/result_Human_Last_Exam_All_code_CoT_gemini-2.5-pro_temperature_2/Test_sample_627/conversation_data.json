    "To find an upper bound for the braid index of the three-twist knot (also known as the $6_1$ knot) using Vogel's algorithm, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the HOMFLY-PT Polynomial:** First, we need the HOMFLY-PT polynomial, denoted as $P_K(a, z)$, for the three-twist knot. The polynomial is:\n    $P(a, z) = a^2z^4 + (a^4 - 2a^2)z^2 - 2a^4 - a^6$\n\n2.  **Understand Vogel's Algorithm:** One formulation of Vogel's algorithm provides an upper bound for the braid index $b(K)$ as follows:\n    a. Rewrite the polynomial $P(a, z)$ in terms of powers of the variable 'a', where the coefficients are polynomials in 'z': $P(a,z) = \\sum_i P_i(z)a^i$.\n    b. Let $a_{max}$ and $a_{min}$ be the maximum and minimum powers of 'a' in the polynomial.\n    c. The upper bound is given by the formula: $b(K) \\le 1 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{deg}_z(P_{a_{min}}) - \\text{deg}_z(P_{a_{max}}))$, where $\\text{deg}_z$ is the degree of the polynomial in the variable 'z'.\n\n3.  **Apply the Algorithm:**\n    a. Rearrange the HOMFLY-PT polynomial for the $6_1$ knot by powers of 'a':\n       $P(a, z) = (-1)a^6 + (-2 + z^2)a^4 + (z^4 - 2z^2)a^2$\n    b. Identify the minimum and maximum powers of 'a':\n       *   The maximum power of 'a' is $a_{max} = 6$. Its coefficient is $P_{a_{max}}(z) = -1$.\n       *   The minimum power of 'a' is $a_{min} = 2$. Its coefficient is $P_{a_{min}}(z) = z^4 - 2z^2$.\n    c. Determine the degrees of the coefficient polynomials in 'z':\n       *   $\\text{deg}_z(P_{a_{max}}) = \\text{deg}_z(-1) = 0$.\n       *   $\\text{deg}_z(P_{a_{min}}) = \\text{deg}_z(z^4 - 2z^2) = 4$.\n    d. Calculate the upper bound using the formula.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to compute the upper bound.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef get_z_degree(poly_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the highest power of 'z' in a polynomial string.\n    Assumes format like 'z**4 - 2*z**2' or a constant like '-1'.\n    \"\"\"\n    if 'z' not in poly_str:\n        return 0\n    # Find all occurrences of z**<number> or z\n    powers = re.findall(r'z(?:\\*\\*(\\d+))?', poly_str)\n    # Handle standalone 'z' which has a power of 1\n    # Convert found powers (as strings) to integers.
