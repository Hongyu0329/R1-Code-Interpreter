    "Based on the principles of historical linguistics, I will trace the development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh2gieti` through its descendant Germanic languages.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Reconstruct the Proto-Germanic Form:** The provided PIE form `*seh2gieti` and its cognates (Latin `sāgīre`) point to a verb root meaning 'to track, seek out'. In Proto-Germanic (PGmc), this root appears as a class 1 weak verb, typically reconstructed from a causative PIE form with a lengthened root grade. The PIE lengthened grade `*sāg-` is the source.\n    *   **Grimm's Law:** The voiced stop `*g` becomes the voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   **Vowel Shift:** The long vowel PIE `*ā` becomes `*ō` in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   Therefore, the root becomes `*sōk-`. The standard infinitive reconstruction is **`*sōkijaną`** ('to seek').\n\n2.  **Trace to Daughter Languages:** I will now apply the specific sound changes of Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German to the Proto-Germanic form `*sōkijaną`.\n    *   **Old Norse:** The `j` in the suffix causes \"i-umlaut,\" fronting the back vowel `*ō` to `œ`. The verb becomes **`sœkja`**.\n    *   **Old English:** I-umlaut also occurs here, changing `*ō` to `ē`. The `k` sound is then palatalized to `ċ` (pronounced /tʃ/) before this new front vowel. The verb becomes **`sēcan`**.\n    *   **Old High German:** This dialect undergoes the High German Consonant Shift, where `*k` becomes the fricative `hh` after a vowel. Unlike in other West Germanic languages, `*ō` does not undergo i-umlaut but \"breaks\" into `uo`. The verb becomes **`suohhan`**.\n\n3.  **Generate Code:** I will create a Python script to print the final results in a clear and structured sentence, presenting each derived word.\n\n```python\ndef trace_etymology():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the etymological development of a PIE root\n    through several Germanic languages.\n    \"\"\"\n    pie_form = \"*seh2gieti\"\n    meaning = \"'(s)he's giving a sign'\"\n\n    # Derived forms based on historical linguistic rules\n    proto_germanic = \"*sōkijaną\"  # from PIE *sāg-eyo-\n    old_norse = \"sœkja\"\n    old_english = \"sēcan\"\n    old_high_german = \"suohhan\"\n\n    # Print the final result in a clear sentence\n    # The prompt asked to output each word, which this print statement does.\n    print(\n        f\"The Proto-Indo-European form {pie_form} {meaning} gives us the following cognates:\\n\"\n        f\"Proto-Germanic: {proto_germanic}\\n\"\n        f\"Old Norse: {old_norse}\\n\"\n        f\"Old English: {old_english}\\n\"\n        f\"Old High German: {old_high_german}\"\n    )\n\ntrace_etymology()\n```\n<<<The Proto-Indo-European form *seh2gieti '(s)he’s giving a sign' gives us the following cognates:\nProto-Germanic: *sōkijaną\nOld Norse: sœkja\nOld English: sēcan\nOld High German: suohhan>>>"
