    Solves for the number of Quantum Temporal Fixed Points (QTFPs).

    A proposition P is a QTFP if P ⊙ P gives the same result in forward and backward time-flows.

    Forward: P ⊙ P = sqrt((P ∧ P) ∨ (¬P ∧ ¬P))
    Backward: P ⊙ P = sqrt((P ∧ ¬P) ∨ (¬P ∧ P))

    The core of the problem is to establish an equality between the 'values' of the expressions.
    Let v(P) be the truth value of a proposition P, represented by a probability p, where p is between 0 and 1.
    For a quantum proposition |P⟩ = α|T⟩ + β|F⟩, this value is p = |α|².
    We use the rules of Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic to evaluate the expressions.
