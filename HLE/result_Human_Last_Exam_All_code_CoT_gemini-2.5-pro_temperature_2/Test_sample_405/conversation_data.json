    "To determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Allotropes**: First, I will identify the main, structurally distinct allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  **Determine Colors**: For each allotrope, I will identify its characteristic color. The most well-known allotropes are white, red, violet, and black phosphorus.\n3.  **Count the Colors**: I will count the number of unique colors identified.\n4.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that enumerates these colors, demonstrates the counting process by displaying it as a simple addition equation, and prints the final count.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the colors of phosphorus allotropes and calculates the total number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The main allotropes of phosphorus have distinct colors.\n    # Let's list them to find the total count.\n    colors_info = {\n        \"White phosphorus\": \"White (or yellowish)\",\n        \"Red phosphorus\": \"Red\",\n        \"Violet phosphorus\": \"Violet (Hittorf's phosphorus)\",\n        \"Black phosphorus\": \"Black\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors of pure phosphorus allotropes are:\")\n    for allotrope, color in colors_info.items():\n        print(f\"- {color}, from {allotrope}\")\n\n    num_colors = len(colors_info)\n\n    # To fulfill the requirement of showing the numbers in an equation,\n    # we will represent the count of each color as '1'.\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the total number of colors:\")\n    \n    # Create the equation string like \"1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\"\n    equation_parts = [\"1\"] * num_colors\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n    print(f\"\\nIn total, there are {num_colors} primary colors that can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
