    # Fact 1: Cholesterol is an essential sterol precursor for the molting hormone Ecdysone.

    # Fact 3: A diet with 2 mg/L cholesterol is insufficient for larvae to survive to adulthood.
    # Fact 4: Cholestanol is not a usable sterol precursor, as a 250 mg/L cholestanol diet leads to zero adult survival.
