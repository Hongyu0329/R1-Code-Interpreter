    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence, we must first identify the hydrophobic core residues. In coiled-coils, this is done by aligning the sequence to a heptad repeat pattern `(abcdefg)n`, where residues at positions 'a' and 'd' are typically hydrophobic and form the core. The identity of these residues dictates the optimal packing arrangement (knobs-into-holes), which in turn determines the number of helices in the bundle (the oligomeric state).\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Write a Python script to analyze the provided sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\n2.  The script will test all 7 possible alignments (heptad frames) to find the one that places the most hydrophobic residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions. This is the most chemically favorable arrangement.\n3.  Once the optimal frame is found, the script will identify the repeating residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions.\n4.  Based on established principles of coiled-coil packing, the script will analyze the identified core residues (`a`/`d` combination) to predict the oligomeric state.\n5.  The script will print the step-by-step reasoning, including the identified core residues and the scoring calculation that led to the register, and finally conclude with the predicted oligomeric state.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
