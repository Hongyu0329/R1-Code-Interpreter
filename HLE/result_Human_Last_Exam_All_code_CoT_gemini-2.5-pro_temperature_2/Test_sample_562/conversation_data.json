    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the radical for the character 謄:\n\n1.  **Decomposition:** First, I will break down the kanji 謄 into its components. The character is a phono-semantic compound, meaning it has a semantic part (the radical) and a phonetic part.\n2.  **Radical Identification:** I will identify the radical, which typically indicates the general meaning of the character. For 謄, the component on the left, 言, signifies \"speech\" or \"words\". This is the radical.\n3.  **Name of the Radical:** When the radical 言 is used on the left side of a character (a position called *hen* or 偏), its specific name is \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n4.  **Code Generation:** Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints the answer in a clear, user-friendly format.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the radical for a given Kanji and prints its name.\n    \"\"\"\n    character = \"謄\"\n    radical_char = \"言\"\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n    radical_name_japanese = \"ごんべん\"\n\n    print(f\"The character is: {character}\")\n    print(f\"The radical component is: {radical_char}\")\n    print(f\"The Hepburn transcription of the radical's name is: {radical_name_hepburn}\")\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
