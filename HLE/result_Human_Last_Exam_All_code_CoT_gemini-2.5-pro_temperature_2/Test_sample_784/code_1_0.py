    # to compute the total log likelihood for that specific answer sequence.

    # prompt, each one requires its own, separate forward pass.

    # To calculate the log likelihood of a single-token answer, we only need the
    # model's predicted probability distribution for the very next token after the prompt.
    # This distribution is automatically computed during the forward pass for any of the
    # multi-token answers. For instance, when processing '(Prompt, Answer_1)', the
    # model first calculates the probabilities for the token following the Prompt.
    # We can inspect this distribution to get the scores for all four single-token
    # answers without needing any new forward passes.
