    "This is a historical question that can be answered by consulting biographical information about Geoffrey Chaucer. I will outline the known facts and then use a Python script to present the answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Establish the year of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n2.  Determine Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts and occupation during that year from historical records.\n3.  A key piece of evidence is Chaucer's poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, which is an elegy for Blanche. This strongly links him to the event within the English court.\n4.  Consolidate these facts into a Python script that prints the information and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides historical context to determine Chaucer's location\n    at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Historical facts\n    death_year_blanche = 1368\n    death_location_blanche = \"Bolingbroke Castle, Lincolnshire, England\"\n    chaucer_role = \"esquire in the royal household of King Edward III\"\n    chaucer_location = \"England\"\n    commemorative_work = \"The Book of the Duchess\"\n\n    # Print the reasoning\n    print(f\"Blanche of Lancaster died in the year {death_year_blanche} in England.\")\n    print(f\"At that time, Geoffrey Chaucer was living and working in {chaucer_location} as an {chaucer_role}.\")\n    print(f\"His famous poem, '{commemorative_work}', is a lament for her death, reinforcing his presence and connection to the English court during this period.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, Geoffrey Chaucer was in England.\")\n\nsolve_historical_question()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
