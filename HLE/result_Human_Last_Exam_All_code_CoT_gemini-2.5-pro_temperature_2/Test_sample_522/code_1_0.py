    Solves the puzzle by transforming the input grid based on a derived rule set.
    
    The transformation rule involves moving a '2' on the grid. Its original
    position becomes '0', and a target '0' cell becomes '2'. The direction of the
    move is determined by the values of the '2's immediate neighbors.
