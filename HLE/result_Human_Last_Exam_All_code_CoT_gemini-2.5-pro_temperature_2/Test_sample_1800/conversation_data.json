    "Based on a review of scientific literature, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not one single value but falls within an optimal range that depends on the specific synthesis method and reaction conditions. However, a general consensus for achieving maximum catalytic performance in both Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting reactions points to a composition that favors high dispersion of nickel on the ceria support, which is typically achieved at a relatively low Ni content.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that explains this reasoning. The script will:\n1.  Summarize the findings from scientific research for both WGS and water splitting.\n2.  Identify a frequently cited optimal molar composition.\n3.  Calculate the corresponding atomic Ni/Ce ratio from this composition.\n4.  Print the final recommended ratio, explaining why it is considered ideal.\n\n```python\ndef find_ideal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio\n    for Ni-Ceria catalysts based on findings from scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Investigating the ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for catalytic reactions...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    # General Principle\n    print(\"The ideal ratio is a balance between catalytic activity and stability.\")\n    print(\"High Ni content can lead to particle agglomeration (sintering) and formation of less active bulk NiO.\")\n    print(\"Low Ni content ensures high dispersion and maximizes the crucial Ni-Ceria interface.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Evidence from Literature\n    print(\"Scientific studies for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting point to a similar optimal range.\")\n    print(\"A frequently reported high-performance composition is where nickel constitutes about 10 molar percent of the total metal cations (Ni + Ce).\")\n    print(\"This can be represented as: Ni / (Ni + Ce) = 0.1\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Calculation of the Atomic Ratio\n    print(\"To find the ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio from this composition, we can perform a simple calculation:\")\n    \n    # Let molar fraction Ni / (Ni + Ce) = 0.1\n    # This means for every 1 total mole of metal:\n    # Moles of Ni = 0.1\n    # Moles of Ce = 1.0 - 0.1 = 0.9\n    \n    ni_moles = 1\n    ce_moles = 9\n    \n    print(f\"If Ni / (Ni + Ce) = 0.1, then the ratio of Ni to Ce atoms is 0.1 / 0.9.\")\n    print(f\"This simplifies to the fraction: {ni_moles} / {ce_moles}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Conclusion\n    print(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"The ideal atomic ratio of Ni/Ce to maximize catalytic performance is approximately {ni_moles}:{ce_moles}.\")\n    print(\"This ratio ensures high nickel dispersion, maximizes active sites at the metal-support interface, and prevents the deactivation of the catalyst, making it highly effective.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the analysis\nfind_ideal_ni_ce_ratio()\n\n```\n<<<1/9>>>"
