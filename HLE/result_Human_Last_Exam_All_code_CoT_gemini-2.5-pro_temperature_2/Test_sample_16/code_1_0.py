    to explain this reasoning and present the final answer.

    Let C be the number of classes.

    print("   - To correctly classify the centroid C_i, there must be a 'champion' prototype whose influence favors class i.")
    print("   - Such a prototype must have a soft label that is highest in the i-th component. This happens if it is closer to C_i than to any other centroid C_j.")
    print("   - To guarantee correct classification for ALL C centroids, each must have its own champion prototype.")
    print("   - If we had fewer than C prototypes (e.g., C-1), at least one class centroid would not have a dedicated champion prototype placed nearest to it. It would likely be misclassified as the class of the nearest available prototype.")
    print("   - Therefore, we need at least C prototypes.")

    print("\n3. Sufficiency (Why C prototypes are enough):")
    print("   - We can devise a placement strategy with exactly C prototypes that guarantees success.")

    print("   - When classifying any centroid C_i:")
    print("     a) The nearest prototype will be P_i. Its distance is near-zero.")
    print("     b) In a distance-weighted kNN, the weight (e.g., 1/distance) for P_i will be enormous, while the weights for all other prototypes P_j (j!=i) will be comparatively small.")
    print("     c) The soft label of P_i will also inherently favor class i because P_i is closest to C_i.")
    print("     d) The final classification is a weighted average of soft labels. Due to its massive weight, P_i's soft label will dominate the final result, guaranteeing the classification of C_i as class i.")
    print("   - Since this works for all C centroids, C prototypes are sufficient.")
