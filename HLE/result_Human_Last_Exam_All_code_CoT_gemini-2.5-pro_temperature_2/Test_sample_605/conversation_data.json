    "To determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the specified Calabi-Yau Link, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical structure**: The problem concerns a Calabi-Yau threefold, which is described as a hypersurface in a 4-dimensional weighted projective space, denoted as `P(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)`. The weights are given as `(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the hypersurface**: For a hypersurface in a weighted projective space to be Calabi-Yau, its degree `d` must be equal to the sum of the weights of the ambient space. I will calculate this degree `d` from the given weights.\n    While the provided polynomial equation contains one monomial (`z_1^4z_2^3z_3`) with a weighted degree of 224, all other monomials consistently have a weighted degree of 225. This discrepancy is likely a typo in the problem statement. The defining polynomial for a hypersurface must be homogeneous, so we can confidently proceed by using the degree `d = 225`, which also satisfies the Calabi-Yau condition `d = sum(w_i)`.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant**: For a smooth Calabi-Yau threefold `X` realized as a hypersurface of degree `d = sum(w_i)` in `P(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)`, the Crawley-Nordström invariant `cn(X)` is given by the formula:\n    `cn(X) = (1/2) * (d^2 - sum(w_i^2))`\n\n4.  **Execute the calculation**: I will write a Python script to perform the calculations:\n    *   Sum the weights to find `d`.\n    *   Calculate `d^2`.\n    *   Sum the squares of the weights.\n    *   Substitute these values into the formula to compute the invariant.\n    The script will print out each step of the calculation to ensure clarity.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface\n    in a weighted projective space.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights of the ambient projective space P(w1, w2, w3, w4, w5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    weights_str = \", \".join(map(str, weights))\n    \n    print(f\"The Calabi-Yau manifold is a hypersurface in the weighted projective space P({weights_str}).\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # For the manifold to be Calabi-Yau, its degree 'd' must equal the sum of the weights.\n    # We verify that most terms in the provided polynomial have this degree.\n    # Term z_1^8*z_3: 8*22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225\n    # Term z_1*z_2^7: 22 + 7*29 = 22 + 203 = 225\n    # All other terms also have degree 225, except for one likely typo.\n    # The degree d is the sum of the weights.\n    d = sum(weights)\n    \n    # Create the string for the sum of weights calculation\n    d_calculation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, weights))\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the degree 'd' of the hypersurface.\")\n    print(\"The degree 'd' is the sum of the weights for the manifold to be Calabi-Yau.\")\n    print(f\"d = {d_calculation_str} = {d}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    \n    # The formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant cn(X) is (1/2) * (d^2 - sum(w_i^2))\n    print(\"Step 2: Apply the formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\")\n    print(\"The formula is: cn(X) = (1/2) * (d^2 - sum(w_i^2))\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate d^2\n    d_squared = d**2\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the terms in the formula.\")\n    print(f\"First, we calculate d^2:\")\n    print(f\"d^2 = {d}^2 = {d_squared}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the squares of the weights\n    weights_squared = [w**2 for w in weights]\n    sum_of_squares_of_weights = sum(weights_squared)\n    \n    # Create the strings for the calculation breakdown\n    weights_squared_str = \" + \".join(map(str, weights_squared))\n    weights_squared_calc_str = \" + \".join([f\"{w}^2\" for w in weights])\n\n    print(\"Next, we calculate the sum of the squares of the weights, sum(w_i^2):\")\n    print(f\"sum(w_i^2) = {weights_squared_calc_str}\")\n    print(f\"           = {weights_squared_str}\")\n    print(f\"           = {sum_of_squares_of_weights}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Final calculation of the invariant\n    numerator = d_squared - sum_of_squares_of_weights\n    invariant = numerator // 2 # Use integer division as the result is an integer\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Substitute the values back into the formula and solve.\")\n    print(f\"cn(X) = (1/2) * ({d_squared} - {sum_of_squares_of_weights})\")\n    print(f\"cn(X) = (1/2) * {numerator}\")\n    print(f\"cn(X) = {invariant}\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    print(f\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau Link is {invariant}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n```\n<<<19387>>>"
