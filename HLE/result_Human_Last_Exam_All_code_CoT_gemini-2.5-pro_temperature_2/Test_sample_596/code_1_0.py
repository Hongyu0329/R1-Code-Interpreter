# The question is: "How many higher dimensional rooted forests (F,R) of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band fail to have the forest F simplicially collapse onto the root R?"

# 1. Understanding the terminology:
# The term "higher dimensional rooted forest" refers to a concept in algebraic and combinatorial topology.
# While there are several related concepts of higher-dimensional 'trees' or 'forests', a common and relevant definition for a "rooted forest" comes from the work of G. Kuperberg ("Spanning trees and torsion", 1996) and R. Forman.
# In this context, a "rooted forest" of a cell complex X is a pair of subcomplexes (F, R), where R is a subcomplex of F, and F simplicially collapses onto R (denoted F -> R).
# The term "higher dimensional" applies here because the triangulation of a Möbius band is a 2-dimensional simplicial complex.

# 2. Analyzing the logical structure of the question:
# Let A be the statement "(F,R) is a higher dimensional rooted forest".
# Let P be the property "the forest F simplicially collapses onto the root R".
# From the definition found in the literature, statement A is defined to be true if and only if property P holds for the pair (F,R).
# The question asks for the number of items A that fail to have property P.
# In other words, it asks for the number of objects that are defined by property P, which simultaneously do not have property P.

# 3. Deducing the answer:
# The set of "higher dimensional rooted forests" is the set of pairs (F,R) for which F collapses to R.
# The question asks for the number of elements in this set that do not satisfy the condition of F collapsing to R.
# By definition, there are no such elements. The set of such objects is the empty set.
# The cardinality of the empty set is 0.

# 4. Final Answer Calculation
# The calculation is a matter of pure logic.
number_of_failing_forests = 0

# Outputting the final equation. In this case, the result is just a single number.
# The "equation" is simply: Final Answer = 0
print("The final equation is: result = 0")
print("The number of such forests is:")
print(number_of_failing_forests)
