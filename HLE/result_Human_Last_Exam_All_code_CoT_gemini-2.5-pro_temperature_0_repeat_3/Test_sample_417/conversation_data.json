    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify all chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Overall Symmetry:** The molecule has a central benzene ring substituted at positions 1, 3, and 5 with identical large groups, and at positions 2, 4, and 6 with identical methyl groups. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 axis of rotational symmetry. Due to this symmetry, we only need to count the number of unique proton signals in one of the three identical \"arms\" of the molecule, plus the signals from the central core.\n\n2.  **Central Core Protons:**\n    *   The three methyl groups on the benzene ring (at C2, C4, C6) are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Number of signals = 1**\n\n3.  **Substituent Arm Protons:** Let's analyze one arm, which consists of a methylene (-CH2-) linker and the chiral indazole derivative.\n    *   **Methylene (-CH2-) linker:** This CH2 group is attached to the chiral indazole moiety. The presence of a chiral center makes the two protons of the CH2 group diastereotopic, meaning they are in different chemical environments and are non-equivalent. They will produce two distinct signals (likely an AB quartet).\n    *   **Number of signals = 2**\n    *   **Indazole Derivative Protons:** This part is a rigid, chiral bicyclic system derived from camphor. In such a system, protons that are not interchangeable by rotation or symmetry are generally non-equivalent.\n        *   **Indazole Ring Proton:** There is one proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole ring (at position C3). This is a unique proton. **(1 signal)**\n        *   **Methyl Groups:** There are three methyl groups on the camphor-like skeleton. One is at C7, and two are at C8. The two methyl groups at C8 are geminal and are attached to a carbon (C8) which is adjacent to a stereocenter (C7). This makes them diastereotopic and non-equivalent. Therefore, the three methyl groups are all in unique environments. **(3 signals)**\n        *   **Bicyclic Skeleton Protons:**\n            *   There is one proton at the C4 bridgehead position. **(1 signal)**\n            *   There is a CH2 group at the C5 position. Its two protons are diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n            *   There is a CH2 group at the C6 position. Its two protons are also diastereotopic. **(2 signals)**\n        *   Total signals from the indazole derivative = 1 (ring H) + 3 (methyls) + 1 (C4-H) + 2 (C5-H2) + 2 (C6-H2) = **9 signals**.\n\n4.  **Total Number of Signals:** We sum the signals from all the unique parts.\n    *   Total = (Central Core Signals) + (Linker Signals) + (Indazole Derivative Signals)\n    *   Total = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\nTherefore, we expect a total of 12 peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this sum based on the analysis.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the expected number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum\n# of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n# based on its chemical structure and symmetry.\n\n# The molecule has C3 symmetry, so we count signals for 1/3 of the molecule.\n\n# 1.
