    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that analyzes the text of Chaucer's \"The Book of the Duchess\" to determine which of the given words is not used in a rhyme.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Fetch the Text**: I will retrieve the complete text of \"The Book of the Duchess\" from the Project Gutenberg website.\n2.  **Isolate the Poem**: I'll extract the poem itself, removing the introductory and concluding text from the file.\n3.  **Process Lines**: The script will then read the poem line by line, extracting the last word from each line. These words will be cleaned of punctuation and converted to lowercase.\n4.  **Identify Rhyming Couplets**: Since the poem is written in rhyming couplets (AABB structure), I will pair the last words of consecutive lines (line 1 with 2, 3 with 4, and so on).\n5.  **Check Target Words**: I will check if each of the words from the answer choices (\"Wente\", \"Here\", \"Fool\", \"Hool\", \"Countour\") appears in these rhyming pairs.\n6.  **Report Findings**: Finally, the script will print the results of the analysis for each word, showing its rhyming partner if one is found. The word that is not found in any rhyme will be the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the analysis:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_chaucer_rhyme():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes \"The Book of the Duchess\" to find which of a given\n    list of words is not used in a rhyme.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing Chaucer's 'The Book of the Duchess' for rhyming words...\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
