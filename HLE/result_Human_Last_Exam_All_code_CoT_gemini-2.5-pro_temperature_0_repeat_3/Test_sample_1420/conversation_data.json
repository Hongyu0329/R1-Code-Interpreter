    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the Theory and Key Parameters**: The problem is in the context of the renormalization group and uses the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. The key parameters are the spatial dimension `d=3` and the physical quantity, the specific heat, which is characterized by the scaling exponent `α`.\n2.  **Determine the Upper Critical Dimension (d_c)**: For problems involving thermal phase transitions like the one described (Ising/O(n) universality class), the upper critical dimension `d_c` is 4. Above this dimension, mean-field theory becomes exact.\n3.  **Calculate Epsilon (ϵ)**: The epsilon expansion is a perturbative expansion in the small parameter `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n4.  **Find the Formula for α**: The first-order epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent `α` in the O(n) model (where `n` is the number of components of the order parameter) is given by the formula:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (n + 8) * ϵ`\n5.  **Specify the Model (n)**: The most common case, corresponding to the Ising model, uses `n=1` (a scalar order parameter). We will use this value.\n6.  **Substitute and Calculate**: Substitute the values of `n` and `ϵ` into the formula to calculate `α`.\n7.  **Generate Python Code**: Write a Python script to perform and display this calculation, clearly showing each step and the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the first-order\n    epsilon expansion for the 3D Ising model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the dimensions and model parameter n\n    d_c = 4  # Upper critical dimension for the O(n) model\n    d = 3    # Spatial dimension\n    n = 1    # Number of components for the order parameter (n=1 for Ising model)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate epsilon\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # Step 4 & 5: Use the first-order epsilon expansion formula for alpha\n    # Formula: alpha = (4 - n) / (n + 8) * epsilon\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    denominator = n + 8\n\n    # Step 6: Calculate the final value of alpha\n    alpha = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n\n    # Print the explanation and the calculation step-by-step\n    print(\"Calculation of the specific heat scaling exponent α using the first-order epsilon expansion:\")\n    print(f\"The upper critical dimension is d_c = {d_c}.\")\n    print(f\"The spatial dimension is d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The expansion parameter is ϵ = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}.\")\n    print(f\"For the Ising universality class, the number of order parameter components is n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe first-order expansion formula for α is: α = (4 - n) / (n + 8) * ϵ\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the equation:\")\n    print(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / ({n} + {8}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {alpha}\")\n\ncalculate_alpha_exponent()\n```\n<<<0.3333333333333333>>>"
