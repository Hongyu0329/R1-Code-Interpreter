    Step 1: Analyze the properties of the space X.
    The space X is a metric space, locally compact, a one-to-one continuous image of the real line R,
    and for any two distinct points x, y in X, there exists a closed connected set K such that x is in the interior of K and y is not in K.

    Step 2: Show that X is a Hausdorff space.
    Let x and y be two distinct points in X. By the given property, there is a closed set K with x in Int(K) and y not in K.
    Let U = Int(K) and V = X \\ K.
    - U is an open set containing x.
    - Since K is closed, V is an open set. Since y is not in K, y is in V.
    - U and V are disjoint because Int(K) is a subset of K.
    Thus, X is a Hausdorff space.

    Step 3: Analyze the map from R to X.
    We are given a continuous bijection f: R -> X.
    - The domain R is a locally compact Hausdorff space.
    - The codomain X is given as locally compact and we have shown it is Hausdorff.

    Step 4: Apply a key theorem.
    A theorem in topology states that a continuous bijection from a locally compact Hausdorff space to another Hausdorff space is a homeomorphism.
    Therefore, the map f: R -> X is a homeomorphism.

    Step 5: Conclude the number of homeomorphism classes.
    This means any space X satisfying the conditions must be homeomorphic to the real line R.
    Since all such spaces are homeomorphic to R, they all belong to the same homeomorphism class.
    Therefore, there is only one such class.
