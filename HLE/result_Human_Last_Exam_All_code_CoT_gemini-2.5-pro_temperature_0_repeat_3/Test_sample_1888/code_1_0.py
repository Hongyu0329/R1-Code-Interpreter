    # Step 1: Determine gamma, the cofinality of the continuum's cardinality.
    # Based on the problem's constraints (2^omega is singular, < aleph_{omega_2})
    # and Konig's theorem (cf(2^omega) > omega), we deduce that gamma must be
    # a regular cardinal such that omega_1 <= gamma < omega_2.
    # The only such cardinal is omega_1.
    gamma = "omega_1"

    # Step 2: Determine delta, the order type of the set X of possible cardinalities.
    # The elements of X are singular cardinals kappa = aleph_alpha with cf(kappa) = omega_1
    # and aleph_2 <= kappa < aleph_{omega_2}.
    # This implies their indices alpha must satisfy omega_1 < alpha < omega_2 and cf(alpha) = omega_1.
    # The set of such ordinals alpha has an order type of omega_2.
    delta = "omega_2"

    # Step 3: Calculate the ordinal sum delta + gamma.
    # The sum is omega_2 + omega_1. In ordinal arithmetic, when adding a smaller
    # initial ordinal to a larger one, the result is the larger ordinal.
