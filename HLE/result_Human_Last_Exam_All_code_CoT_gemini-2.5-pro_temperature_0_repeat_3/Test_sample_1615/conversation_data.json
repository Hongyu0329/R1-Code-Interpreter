    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chromatic Number:** The chromatic number of a graph, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required to color its vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\n2.  **Recall Basic Graph Theory Properties:** For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is always less than or equal to the number of vertices, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n\n3.  **Consider the Condition for Maximum Chromatic Number:** The maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G) = n$, is achieved if and only if the graph $G$ is a complete graph ($K_n$), where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n4.  **Apply the Problem's Constraint:** The problem explicitly states that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This means its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. Therefore, for our graph $G$, we must have $\\chi(G) < n$, which implies $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n5.  **Find the Maximum Value:** We've established an upper bound of $n-1$. To show that this is the maximum possible value, we need to demonstrate that there exists at least one graph with $n$ vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of exactly $n-1$.\n\n6.  **Construct an Example Graph:** Let's construct such a graph. Start with the complete graph $K_n$ (where $n=12345$). Now, remove a single edge, say between vertices $u$ and $v$. Let's call this new graph $G'$.\n    *   $G'$ is not a complete graph because the edge $(u,v)$ is missing.\n    *   Consider the set of vertices $V' = V \\setminus \\{u\\}$. This set contains $n-1$ vertices. In $G'$, every vertex in $V'$ is connected to every other vertex in $V'$, forming a clique of size $n-1$.\n    *   A clique of size $k$ requires $k$ colors for a proper coloring. Therefore, our graph $G'$ requires at least $n-1$ colors. So, $\\chi(G') \\ge n-1$.\n\n7.  **Combine the Findings:** We have shown that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not complete, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$. We have also constructed a specific graph $G'$ that is not complete and for which $\\chi(G') \\ge n-1$. Combining these two facts, we can conclude that the chromatic number for our example graph is exactly $\\chi(G') = n-1$.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:** Since it is possible to have a chromatic number of $n-1$, this is the maximum possible value. With $n = 12345$, the maximum number of colors is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring\n    of a graph with n vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of vertices in the graph G\n    num_vertices = 12345\n\n    # For any graph with n vertices, the chromatic number is at most n.\n    # The chromatic number is n if and only if the graph is a complete graph (K_n).\n    # Since the graph is not a complete graph, its chromatic number is at most n-1.\n    # A graph K_n with one edge removed is not complete and has a clique of size n-1,\n    # so its chromatic number is exactly n-1.\n    # Therefore, the maximum number of colors is n-1.\n    max_colors = num_vertices - 1\n\n    # Print the equation and the result\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {num_vertices}.\")\n    print(\"The graph is not a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"The maximum number of colors required is n - 1.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n    print(f\"So, the maximum number of colours is {max_colors}.\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
