    # --- Conclusion ---
    print("Step 3: Conclusion")
    print("Player 1 can only win in the specific case where the number of 2-euro coins on odd positions is exactly 44 (and a 2-euro coin is at an end).")
    print("In almost all other scenarios, the result is a draw or a win for Player 2.")
    print("Since the choice of role is made before the coins are arranged, one should choose the role that has a higher probability of winning over all possible random arrangements.")
    print("This strategic advantage belongs to the second player.")
