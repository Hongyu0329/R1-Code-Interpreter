# The user wants to find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring
# of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5.

# Step 1: Identify the space.
# The space of k-dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space R^n is called
# the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted G(k, n).
# In this case, we are looking at the space of 3-subspaces of R^5, which is G(3, 5).
space_k = 3
space_n = 5
print(f"The space is the Grassmannian G({space_k}, {space_n}).")

# Step 2: Recall the structure of the integral cohomology ring.
# A fundamental theorem in algebraic topology states that the integral cohomology ring
# of any real Grassmannian, H*(G(k, n); Z), is a free abelian group.
# A free abelian group is, by definition, torsion-free.
print("The integral cohomology ring of a Grassmannian is known to be torsion-free.")

# Step 3: Characterize the torsion subgroup.
# The torsion subgroup of an abelian group A is the subgroup consisting of all elements
# of finite order.
# For a torsion-free group, the only element of finite order is the identity element (0).
# Therefore, the torsion subgroup is the trivial group {0}.
print("For a torsion-free group, the torsion subgroup is the trivial group {0}.")

# Step 4: Determine the rank of the torsion subgroup.
# The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring
# the group with the field of rational numbers.
# The rank of the trivial group {0} is 0.
rank = 0
print(f"The rank of the torsion subgroup is therefore {rank}.")
