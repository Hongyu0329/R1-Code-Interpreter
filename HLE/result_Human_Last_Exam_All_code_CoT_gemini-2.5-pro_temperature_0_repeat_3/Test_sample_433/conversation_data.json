    "My plan is to answer your question based on the official guidelines from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically Chapter <797> on sterile compounding.\n\n1.  **Identify the type of container:** The user specified a \"single dose container ampule.\" This is a crucial detail because single-dose containers do not contain antimicrobial preservatives.\n2.  **Identify the environment:** The user specified a \"sterile environment.\" In pharmaceutical terms, this typically refers to an ISO Class 5 primary engineering control (PEC), like a laminar airflow workbench.\n3.  **Consult USP <797>:** The guidelines state that once a single-dose container (like an ampule) is opened or punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment, it must be used within a specific time frame to prevent microbial contamination.\n4.  **Determine the time limit:** According to the most recent USP <797> standards, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a punctured single-dose container maintained in an ISO Class 5 environment is up to 12 hours.\n5.  **Create a Python script:** I will write a simple Python script to declare the number of hours for the BUD and print out the answer in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_for_ampule():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    punctured in a sterile environment, based on USP <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to USP <797>, the BUD is 12 hours for a single-dose container\n    # opened in an ISO Class 5 environment.\n    bud_hours = 12\n    number_of_doses = 1\n\n    # The final \"equation\" is a descriptive sentence using the variables.\n    print(f\"The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single ({number_of_doses}) dose container ampule, from the time of puncture in a sterile environment, is up to {bud_hours} hours.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis assumes the ampule is opened and maintained within an ISO Class 5 or better environment.\")\n\nget_bud_for_ampule()\n```\n<<<12 hours>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
