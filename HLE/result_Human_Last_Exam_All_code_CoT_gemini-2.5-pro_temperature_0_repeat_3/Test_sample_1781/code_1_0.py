    # The question concerns the monarch who shifted the royal title from
    # "King of the Franks" to "King of France". This was Philip II Augustus.

    # The question asks for two pieces of information:
    # 1. The year of this "morphing". The title change began in 1190.
    #    The monarch's reign, which cemented this change, ended in 1223.
    # 2. The biographer who was the source of the monarch's epithet ("Augustus").
    #    This was the monk Rigord.

    # Let's evaluate the choices based on this information.
    # Choice C is (1223, Rigord).
    # The year is the death of Philip II, marking the end of his transformative reign.
    # The person is Rigord, the correct contemporary biographer and source of the epithet.
    # This makes Choice C the most historically sound option among the choices.

    chosen_year = 1223
