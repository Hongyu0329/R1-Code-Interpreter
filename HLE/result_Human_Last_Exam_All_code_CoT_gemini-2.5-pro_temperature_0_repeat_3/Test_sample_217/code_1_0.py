# This script identifies and prints the numbers of the three correctly associated triplets.
# Based on biological analysis, the correct triplets are 3, 5, and 8.
# 3: Batesian mimicry is a valid mode, and both Eristalini (hoverflies) and Melipotini (moths) are groups containing species that act as Batesian mimics using color.
# 5: Müllerian mimicry is a valid mode, and Heliconiini (butterflies) and Melipotini (moths) are groups known to form Müllerian mimicry rings, sharing warning coloration.
# 8: Aposematism (warning signaling) is a valid mode, and both Danaus plexippus (Monarch) and Cycnia tenera (tiger moth) are classic examples using their respective traits (wing color and tymbal organs).
# This script will print the numbers of these correct triplets in ascending order.
