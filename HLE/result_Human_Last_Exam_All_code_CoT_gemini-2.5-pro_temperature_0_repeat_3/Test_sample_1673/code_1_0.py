    This script identifies Compound 1 based on the provided reaction and NMR data.

    The reaction is between Geraniol and O-(p-tolyl) chloro thionoformate.
    This is a nucleophilic substitution that forms a thionocarbonate ester.

    The key NMR evidence is the chemical shift of a specific proton:
    - In the starting material, geraniol, a vinylic proton signal is at 5.32-5.37 ppm.
    - In the product, Compound 1, this signal shifts downfield to 5.97 ppm.

    This large downfield shift confirms the attachment of the electron-withdrawing
    O-(p-tolyl) thionoformate group to the oxygen of geraniol.
