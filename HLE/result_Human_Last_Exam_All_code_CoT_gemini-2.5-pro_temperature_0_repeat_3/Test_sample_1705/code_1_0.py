# Step 1: Define the components of the measure calculation.
# The measure of the set S is known to be 2 / (3^6).
numerator = 2
denominator_base = 3
exponent = 6

# Step 2: Calculate the denominator.
denominator = denominator_base ** exponent

# Step 3: Calculate the measure of the set S.
measure_S = numerator / denominator

# Step 4: Multiply the measure by 10^6 as requested.
multiplier = 10**6
result = measure_S * multiplier

# Step 5: Print the final equation and the result.
print(f"The measure of S is {numerator}/{denominator}.")
print(f"The required value is ({numerator} / {denominator}) * {multiplier}.")
print(f"Calculation: ({numerator} / {denominator_base}^{exponent}) * {multiplier} = {result}")
