def solve_bundle_adjustment_query():
    """
    This function determines the maximum number of landmarks that can be marginalized
    in a bundle adjustment problem while ensuring solvability.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. Bundle Adjustment (BA) has a 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) gauge ambiguity
       (3 for translation, 3 for rotation, 1 for scale).
    2. To get a unique solution, this gauge must be fixed by adding 7 constraints.
    3. A robust method to fix the gauge, independent of the camera configuration,
       is to define the world coordinate system using the 3D landmarks.
    4. A minimum of 3 non-collinear landmarks are required to define a 3D coordinate
       frame and fix the scale. These 3 points act as the anchor for the system.
    5. Variables used to fix the gauge cannot be marginalized out during optimization.
    6. Therefore, these 3 essential landmarks must remain in the optimization state.
    7. If there are N total landmarks, and 3 must be kept, the maximum number
       that can be marginalized is N - 3.
