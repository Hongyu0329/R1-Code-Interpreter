    "My plan is to analyze the key characters and dialogue from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris* to determine which character expressed the specific sentiment of being ashamed for missing the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\n1.  **Analyze the character Dr. Snaut:** Dr. Snaut is one of the scientists already on the space station when the protagonist, Kris Kelvin, arrives. He often acts as a philosophical guide for Kris, explaining the strange phenomena related to the planet Solaris.\n2.  **Recall a key scene:** There is a significant conversation between Snaut and Kris where they discuss humanity's purpose in space.\n3.  **Identify the specific dialogue:** In this scene, Snaut confesses his feelings of homesickness. He says, \"We are in the foolish position of a man striving for a goal that he fears, that he has no need of... We have no need of other worlds. We need mirrors... Man needs man.\" He continues, expressing a deep-seated nostalgia for Earth and a sense of shame for this \"human\" feeling. He explicitly states that he misses Earth and dreams of it, including the simple, natural sounds like the rustling of leaves.\n4.  **Evaluate other characters:**\n    *   **Kris:** His nostalgia is primarily focused on his late wife, Hari, and their dacha (country house).\n    *   **Sartorius:** He is cold and clinical, actively suppressing such emotions in favor of scientific study.\n    *   **Hari:** As a \"visitor\" created by Solaris, she has no memories of Earth to miss.\n    *   **Gibarian:** He expresses despair and confusion in his final message but does not have the specific dialogue about leaves.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on his direct confession to Kris, Dr. Snaut is the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves on Earth. This corresponds to option C.\n\nI will now provide the final answer.\n<<<C>>>"
