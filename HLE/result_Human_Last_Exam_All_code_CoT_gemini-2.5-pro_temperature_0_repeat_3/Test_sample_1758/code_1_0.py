# This script prints the phonetic transcription of "shock absorber"
# as it would be pronounced in Puerto Rican Spanish.
# The transcription is derived based on key phonological rules:
# 1. /ʃ/ -> /tʃ/ (e.g., shock -> chok)
# 2. Vowel mapping from English to the 5-vowel Spanish system.
# 3. Lambdacism: Syllable-final /ɾ/ becomes /l/ (e.g., absorber -> absolbel).
# 4. Allophonic variation of /b/ to [β] in certain contexts.
# 5. Linking (liaison) between the two words.
