    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the sequence:** The given sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119. Let's denote the terms as `a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5`.\n2.  **Find a recursive pattern:** We'll test for a relationship of the form `a_n = k * a_{n-1} +/- C_n`, where `k` is a constant and `C_n` is a sequence of numbers. Let's try `k=3`.\n    *   `a_2 = 11`. `3 * a_1 = 3 * 2 = 6`. To get 11, we need to add 5. So, `a_2 = 3 * a_1 + 5`.\n    *   `a_3 = 23`. `3 * a_2 = 3 * 11 = 33`. To get 23, we need to subtract 10. So, `a_3 = 3 * a_2 - 10`.\n    *   `a_4 = 51`. `3 * a_3 = 3 * 23 = 69`. To get 51, we need to subtract 18. So, `a_4 = 3 * a_3 - 18`.\n    *   `a_5 = 119`. `3 * a_4 = 3 * 51 = 153`. To get 119, we need to subtract 34. So, `a_5 = 3 * a_4 - 34`.\n3.  **Identify the pattern in the subtracted numbers:** The pattern seems to be `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - b_n` starting from the third term. The sequence of subtracted numbers `b_n` is {10, 18, 34, ...}.\n4.  **Analyze the pattern of `b_n`:**\n    *   Let's look at the differences: `18 - 10 = 8`, `34 - 18 = 16`. The difference is doubling (`8, 16, ...`).\n    *   The next difference should be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n    *   Therefore, the next term in the `b_n` sequence is `34 + 32 = 66`.\n5.  **Calculate the next term of the main sequence:**\n    *   The next term, `a_6`, will be `3 * a_5 - 66`.\n    *   `a_6 = 3 * 119 - 66 = 357 - 66 = 291`.\n\nThe following Python code will implement this logic to find the next number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the given number sequence puzzle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    sequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    \n    # The pattern is a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - b_n for n >= 3\n    # Let's find the sequence b_n\n    # b_1 corresponds to a_3, b_2 to a_4, etc.\n    b = []\n    for i in range(2, len(sequence)):\n        b_i = 3 * sequence[i-1] - sequence[i]\n        b.append(b_i)\n        \n    # b is [10, 18, 34]\n    \n    # Now we find the pattern in b. The difference between terms doubles.\n    # diff1 = 18 - 10 = 8\n    # diff2 = 34 - 18 = 16\n    # The next difference will be 16 * 2 = 32\n    last_diff = b[-1] - b[-2]\n    next_diff = last_diff * 2\n    \n    # The next term in b is the last term of b + the next difference\n    next_b = b[-1] + next_diff\n    \n    # Now we can calculate the next term in the main sequence\n    last_term_in_sequence = sequence[-1]\n    next_term = 3 * last_term_in_sequence - next_b\n    \n    print(\"The sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ...\")\n    print(\"The pattern is a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} - b_n, where b_n is a sequence starting from the 3rd term.\")\n    print(f\"The sequence of subtracted numbers 'b' is: {b}\")\n    print(\"The pattern in 'b' is that the difference between consecutive terms doubles: 8, 16, ...\")\n    print(f\"The next difference is 16 * 2 = {next_diff}\")\n    print(f\"The next number to subtract is {b[-1]} + {next_diff} = {next_b}\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"3 * {last_term_in_sequence} - {next_b} = {next_term}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
