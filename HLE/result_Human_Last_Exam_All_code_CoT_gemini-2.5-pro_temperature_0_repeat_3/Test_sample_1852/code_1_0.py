# The problem is solved using principles of set theory and cardinal arithmetic.
# The cardinals are represented as strings for display purposes.

# From the analysis, we determined the set X of possible tower lengths.
# Given 2^omega_1 = omega_2, we found that X = {omega_2}.
X = ["omega_2"]

# delta_1 is the supremum of X.
delta_1 = "omega_2"

# delta_2 is the infimum of X.
delta_2 = "omega_2"

# The sum is calculated using cardinal arithmetic, where omega_2 + omega_2 = omega_2.
final_sum = "omega_2"

# Print the final equation, showing each term.
