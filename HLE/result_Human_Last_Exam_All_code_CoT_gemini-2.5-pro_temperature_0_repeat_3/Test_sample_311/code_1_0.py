    # Question 1: How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?
    # - Compound 11 (cis-2-butene-1,4-diol) has 4 carbons.
    # - Ozonolysis cleaves it into two identical 2-carbon fragments (aldehyde 12).
    # - The synthesis proceeds using one of these 2-carbon fragments.
    # - These 2 carbons are retained through all subsequent steps (Henry reaction, Michael addition, Wittig, Nef, another Wittig, RCM, deprotection, oxidation, and a final Wittig reaction).
    # - The final Wittig reaction converts R-CHO to R-CH=CHR', which retains the original carbon backbone.
    # - Therefore, 2 carbons from compound 11 are in compound 1.
    carbons_from_11_in_1 = 2

    # Question 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?
    # - Compound 11 has 2 oxygen atoms in its two hydroxy (-OH) groups.
    # - After cleavage, each 2-carbon fragment (aldehyde 12) contains one of these oxygen atoms, protected as a TESO- group.
    # - This TESO- group is stable and is carried through the synthesis to compound 14.
    # - Compound 14's structure retains this TESO- group.
    # - Therefore, 1 oxygen from compound 11 is in compound 14.
    oxygens_from_11_in_14 = 1

    # Question 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
    # - The reaction proceeds from 10 to 7 (10 + 6 -> 7), so the question is phrased backwards.
    # - We interpret the question as asking for the number of nitrogen atoms in the relevant compounds.
    # - Compound 10 is formed from aldehyde 12 and nitromethane (MeNO2). Nitromethane introduces one nitrogen atom.
    # - Thus, compound 10 contains one nitrogen atom.
    # - Compound 7 is formed from 10, and the nitrogen atom is retained.
    # - The most logical answer to the intended question is 1.
    nitrogens_in_10 = 1

    # Print the results as a comma-separated string.
    print(f"{carbons_from_11_in_1},{oxygens_from_11_in_14},{nitrogens_in_10}")
