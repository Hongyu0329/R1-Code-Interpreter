    "This is a fascinating question from a field of mathematics called point-set topology. The answer is not a simple integer but a type of infinite number called a cardinal number.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to arrive at the answer:\n1.  **Define the Terms:** First, I will clarify the mathematical objects in the question: \"continuum,\" \"indecomposable continuum,\" and \"composant.\"\n2.  **State the Core Theorem:** I will reference the fundamental theorem from topology that describes the nature of the set of composants in any indecomposable continuum. This theorem establishes a lower bound on how many there can be.\n3.  **Identify the Smallest Cardinal:** Based on the theorem, the number of composants must be \"uncountable.\" I will identify the smallest uncountable cardinal number, which provides the precise answer.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that prints this explanation, fulfilling the request to provide the answer via code. The script will clearly state the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and provides the answer to the question about the\n    smallest number of composants in an indecomposable continuum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The answer is a concept from set theory, a transfinite cardinal number.\n    # We represent it as a string.\n    final_answer = \"Aleph-one (ℵ₁)\"\n\n    print(\"--- Problem Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"The question is: What is the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have?\")\n    print(\"This is a question from point-set topology, and the answer is a transfinite number.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Key Definitions ---\")\n    print(\"1.
