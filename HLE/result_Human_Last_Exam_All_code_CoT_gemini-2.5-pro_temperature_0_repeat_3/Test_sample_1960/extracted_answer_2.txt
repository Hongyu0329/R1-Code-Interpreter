**Function `f(w)`:**

Let `A_0, A_1, \dots, A_b` be a sequence of distinct formulas defined as `A_0 = \bot` and `A_{k+1} = A_k \multimap \bot`.
The function `f` is defined as:
$$
f(w) = \bigotimes_{k=0}^{b-w} (A_k \multimap A_{k+w})
$$

**Formula `C(W, m, b)`:**

Using the same definition for `A_k`, the formula `C` is:
$$
C(W, m, b) = \bigotimes_{i=1}^{m} (A_0 \multimap A_b)
$$
This is the formula `(A_0 \multimap A_b)` tensored with itself `m` times.
