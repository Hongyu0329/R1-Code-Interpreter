    "This problem asks for a closed form of the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$. This is a convolution of two sequences, which suggests using generating functions.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the generating functions.** The sum is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of two generating functions. Let $C(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$ be the generating function for the central binomial coefficients. The sum $S_n$ is the $n$-th coefficient of the product $A(x)C(x)$, where $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$.\n2.  **Find a closed form for A(x).** We can derive a recurrence relation for the generating functions $A_p(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^p \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$. We can see that $A_{p+1}(x) = (2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1) A_p(x)$. Starting with $A_0(x) = C(x)$, we can iteratively find $A_5(x)$.\n3.  **Express A(x) in a structured form.** Through iteration, we find that $A_p(x)$ can be written as $\\frac{P_p(x)}{(1-4x)^p}C(x)$, where $P_p(x)$ is a polynomial in $x$. We can find a recurrence for these polynomials: $P_{p+1}(x) = 2x(1-4x)P_p'(x) + (8px+1)P_p(x)$, with $P_0(x)=1$.\n4.  **Calculate P_5(x).** We apply the recurrence relation five times starting from $P_0(x)=1$ to find the polynomial $P_5(x)$.\n    *   $P_0(x) = 1$\n    *   $P_1(x) = 1$\n    *   $P_2(x) = 8x+1$\n    *   $P_3(x) = 64x^2+40x+1$\n    *   $P_4(x) = 512x^3+960x^2+144x+1$\n    *   $P_5(x) = 4096x^4+18944x^3+8256x^2+464x+1$\n5.  **Calculate the final sum S_n.** The sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in $A_5(x)C(x)$.\n    $S_n = [x^n] (A_5(x)C(x)) = [x^n] \\left(\\frac{P_5(x)}{(1-4x)^5}C(x)^2\\right) = [x^n] \\frac{P_5(x)}{(1-4x)^6}$.\n    Using the expansion $(1-y)^{-k} = \\sum_{j=0}^\\infty \\binom{j+k-1}{k-1} y^j$, we can extract the coefficient of $x^n$.\n    $S_n = \\sum_{j=0}^{4} c_{5,j} [x^{n-j}] (1-4x)^{-6} = \\sum_{j=0}^{4} c_{5,j} \\binom{n-j+5}{5} 4^{n-j}$, where $c_{5,j}$ are the coefficients of $P_5(x)$.\n6.  **Simplify the expression.** The resulting expression for $S_n$ is a sum of binomial coefficients, which simplifies to $4^n$ times a polynomial in $n$. We will use Python with the SymPy library to perform this simplification and find the coefficients of the polynomial.\n\nThe following Python code implements step 6 to find the final closed form.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_closed_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the closed form for the given sum using symbolic mathematics.\n    The derivation involves generating functions, leading to an expression for the sum\n    as 4^n times a polynomial in n.
