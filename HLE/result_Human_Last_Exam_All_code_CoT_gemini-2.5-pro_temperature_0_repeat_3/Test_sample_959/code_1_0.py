    This function solves the problem by following these steps:
    1.  It recognizes that the group G is trivial based on the given presentation.
    2.  It identifies that there is only one central extension E of a trivial group,
        which is isomorphic to the cyclic group C.
    3.  It calculates the order of the outer automorphism group of this extension E.
    4.  It computes the final sum, which in this case is just a single term.
