    # Option A: not stable to oxygen because it is highly reactive
    # Analysis: This contradicts the premise of the question, which specifies "air-stable" radicals.
    print("Choice A is incorrect. The materials are defined as 'air-stable'.")

    # Option B: wide FWDH because it has multiple emissions
    # Analysis: Wide FWHM (color impurity) is a disadvantage, but not the most critical one.
    # The primary challenge for radical emitters is efficiency loss due to quenching.
    print("Choice B is a possible but not the primary disadvantage.")

    # Option C: low luminance because radical can quench with each other
    # Analysis: Radical-radical quenching is the correct mechanism. This does lead to low luminance.
    # However, the more fundamental performance metric affected is the efficiency (EQE).
    print("Choice C describes a correct mechanism and a real consequence, but 'low EQE' is a more fundamental problem.")

    # Option D: low EQE because excitons can be quenched by the radicals
    # Analysis: This is the most accurate and fundamental answer. The open-shell nature of radicals
    # leads to strong bimolecular quenching (e.g., doublet-doublet annihilation). This process
    # directly reduces the number of photons generated per electron, which is measured by the
    # External Quantum Efficiency (EQE). This efficiency loss is the most significant hurdle for radical OLEDs.
    print("Choice D is the best answer. Low EQE is the fundamental disadvantage caused by quenching.")

    # Option E: low EQE because delocalization of the radical will have multiple emissions
    # Analysis: The reasoning is flawed. Delocalization is a feature that provides stability to the radical,
    # not a primary cause for low efficiency.
    print("Choice E provides incorrect reasoning.")

    final_answer = "D"
    print("\nConclusion: The primary disadvantage is the low External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) due to bimolecular quenching processes inherent to radicals.")
