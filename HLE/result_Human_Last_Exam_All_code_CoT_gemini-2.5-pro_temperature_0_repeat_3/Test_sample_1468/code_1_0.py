    This function formalizes the derivation of the lower bound for m.
    
    The derivation proceeds by contradiction.
    1. Assume the hidden dimension m is less than N*q.
    2. This assumption implies that the linear transformation W must have a non-trivial kernel when restricted to the N*q-dimensional space of inputs corresponding to the y_i vectors.
    3. This means there exists a line of inputs x(t) that are all mapped to the same hidden representation Wx, and thus the same final output f(x).
    4. We can construct this line such that the true function qSA(x) changes significantly between two points x_a and x_b on the line.
    5. Specifically, for some output block i, the distance ||qSA(x_a)_i - qSA(x_b)_i|| can be made large. With a specific choice of z vectors, this distance is 2/q.
    6. The approximation guarantee is ||f(x)_i - qSA(x)_i|| <= epsilon, where epsilon = 1/(2q).
    7. Since f(x_a)_i = f(x_b)_i, the triangle inequality implies ||qSA(x_a)_i - qSA(x_b)_i|| <= 2 * epsilon.
    8. This leads to the inequality: 2/q <= 2 * (1/(2q)), which simplifies to 2/q <= 1/q, or 2 <= 1.
    9. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the initial assumption must be false.
    10. We conclude that m must be at least N*q.
