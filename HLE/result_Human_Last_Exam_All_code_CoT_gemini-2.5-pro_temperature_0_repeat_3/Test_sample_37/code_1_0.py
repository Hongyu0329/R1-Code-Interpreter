    print("     - If true, this contradicts Ω's definition ('cannot be computed').")

    print("3. Determining the properties of Ω:")
    print("   - Since the hypercomputer cannot compute Ω, the statement defining it is TRUE.")

    print("   - The problem is self-referential. The hypercomputer's own abilities are part of the question.")
    print("   - To prove 'Ω is not in S', the hypercomputer must first prove 'I cannot compute Ω'.")
    print("   - This proof is itself a complex computation about Ω, which its definition forbids.")
