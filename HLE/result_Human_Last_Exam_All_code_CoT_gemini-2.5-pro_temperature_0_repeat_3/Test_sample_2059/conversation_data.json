    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem and the corresponding Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\nLet the given product be $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$.\nBy definition, this polynomial can be written as $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$.\nWe are asked to find the value of the sum of the squares of the coefficients, which is $S = \\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\nThis sum has a special property: it is the constant term (the coefficient of $x^0$) of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$. Let's see why:\n$P(x^{-1}) = \\sum_j a_j (x^{-1})^j = \\sum_j a_j x^{-j}$.\nThe product is:\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\left(\\sum_k a_k x^k\\right) \\left(\\sum_j a_j x^{-j}\\right) = \\sum_{k,j} a_k a_j x^{k-j}$.\n\nThe constant term in this resulting polynomial is the sum of all terms where the exponent is zero, i.e., $k-j=0$, which means $k=j$. The sum of these terms is $\\sum_k a_k a_k = \\sum_k a_k^2 = S$.\nSo, our task is to find the constant term of $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n\nLet's write out the expression for $P(x)P(x^{-1})$:\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)\\right) \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)\\right)$\n\nWe can combine the terms under a single product:\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left[ \\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\right]$\n\nThe constant term of a product of polynomials is the product of the constant terms of each factor. Let's find the constant term of the $i$-th factor in the product above. Let's call the $i$-th factor $G_i(x)$:\n$G_i(x) = \\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) \\left( 1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{-3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\n\nWhen we multiply these two parts, the terms that result in a constant (i.e., $x^0$) are:\n*   $1 \\times 1 = 1$\n*   $x^{3^i} \\times x^{-3^i} = x^0 = 1$\n*   $x^{2\\cdot 3^i} \\times x^{-2\\cdot 3^i} = x^0 = 1$\n*   $x^{3\\cdot 3^i} \\times x^{-3\\cdot 3^i} = x^0 = 1$\n\nThe sum of the coefficients of these constant terms is $1+1+1+1=4$. So, the constant term of $G_i(x)$ is 4.\n\nThis holds true for each factor from $i=0$ to $i=19$. Since there are 20 such factors in the product for $P(x)P(x^{-1})$, the total constant term is the product of these 20 individual constant terms:\n$S = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} 4 = 4^{20}$.\n\nThe following Python code will calculate the final numerical value.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the polynomial P(x).\n# As derived in the plan, this sum is equal to the constant term of P(x)P(x^-1).\n# The constant term of each factor in the product P(x)P(x^-1) is 4.\n# There are 20 such factors (for i from 0 to 19).\n# Therefore, the final result is 4 raised to the power of 20.\n\n# Define the base and the exponent for the calculation.\nbase = 4\nexponent = 20\n\n# Calculate the result.\nresult = base ** exponent\n\n# Print the final equation with the numbers involved.\nprint(f\"The sum of the squares of the coefficients is given by the equation:\")\nprint(f\"{base} ** {exponent} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<1099511627776>>>"
