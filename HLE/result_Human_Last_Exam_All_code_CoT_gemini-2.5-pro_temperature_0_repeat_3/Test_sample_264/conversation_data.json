    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Cubes:** I'll represent the two cubes in a 3D coordinate system.\n    *   The first cube (Cube A) can be placed at the origin, occupying the space where `0 <= x <= 1`, `0 <= y <= 1`, and `0 <= z <= 1`.\n    *   The second cube (Cube B) is shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal. The main diagonal runs from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). A shift of 1/2 along this diagonal corresponds to a displacement vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Therefore, Cube B occupies the space where `1/2 <= x <= 3/2`, `1/2 <= y <= 3/2`, and `1/2 <= z <= 3/2`.\n\n2.  **Find the Intersection:** The intersection is the volume that is common to both cubes. To find this, I'll determine the overlapping range for each coordinate (x, y, and z).\n    *   For the x-coordinate, the overlap is between `max(0, 1/2)` and `min(1, 3/2)`, which is the range `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   Similarly, for the y and z coordinates, the overlapping range is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Volume:** The intersection forms a smaller cube. I will calculate the length of its sides from the overlapping ranges and then compute its volume (length * width * height).\n\n4.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation for the volume.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_cube_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two cubes shifted along the main diagonal.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the properties of the cubes\n    side_length = Fraction(1)\n    shift = Fraction(1, 2)\n\n    # Define the boundaries of the first cube (Cube A)\n    cube_a_min = Fraction(0)\n    cube_a_max = side_length\n\n    # Define the boundaries of the second cube (Cube B)\n    cube_b_min = shift\n    cube_b_max = side_length + shift\n\n    # Calculate the boundaries of the intersection for one dimension\n    # The result is the same for all three dimensions (x, y, z)\n    intersect_min = max(cube_a_min, cube_b_min)\n    intersect_max = min(cube_a_max, cube_b_max)\n\n    # Calculate the side length of the intersection cube\n    intersect_side_length = intersect_max - intersect_min\n\n    # Calculate the volume of the intersection\n    volume = intersect_side_length ** 3\n\n    # Print the final equation\n    print(f\"The intersection is a cube with side length {intersect_side_length}.\")\n    print(\"The volume is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"{intersect_side_length} * {intersect_side_length} * {intersect_side_length} = {volume}\")\n    # Also printing in decimal for clarity\n    print(f\"{float(intersect_side_length)} * {float(intersect_side_length)} * {float(intersect_side_length)} = {float(volume)}\")\n\n\nsolve_cube_intersection()\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
