    print("C is plausible: The presence of epistatic variance (Vi > 0) is a non-additive component and would cause H^2 and h^2 to differ.")
    print("E provides the best explanation: The presence of dominance variance (Vd > 0) is a primary cause for H^2 > h^2. The statement correctly highlights the reason: h^2 is defined to exclude non-additive effects like dominance. While Vd is part of Vg (for H^2), it is not part of Va (for h^2). This definitional exclusion is the fundamental reason for the difference.")
