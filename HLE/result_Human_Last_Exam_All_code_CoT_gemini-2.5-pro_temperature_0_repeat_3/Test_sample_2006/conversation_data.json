    "This haiku is a riddle that can be solved using mathematics. Here is the step-by-step plan to find the answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Haiku Structure:** The haiku follows the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure. We will count the syllables in each line to get our numbers.\n    *   Line 1: \"An August tempest\" -> 5 syllables.\n    *   Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\" -> 7 syllables.\n    *   Line 3: \"A divine one yields\" -> 5 syllables.\n2.  **Determine the Operations:** The words in the haiku hint at the mathematical operations.\n    *   Line 2 contains \"brings winds of change,\" which implies subtraction.\n    *   Line 3 contains \"yields,\" which implies addition.\n3.  **Form the Equation:** Based on the flow of the haiku, we can construct the equation starting with the first line's syllable count, subtracting the second, and adding the third: `5 - 7 + 5`.\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** The result of the equation is `3`.\n5.  **Find the Answer:** The prompt asks for the answer \"in alphabetical order.\" The 3rd letter of the alphabet is C. The title \"The Bays\" can be interpreted as a pun for \"The C's\" (seas), which fits the \"tempest\" theme and reinforces the answer.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will now provide a Python script that performs this calculation, prints the full equation, and reveals the final answer.\n\n```python\n# 1. The numbers are derived from the syllable count of each line of the haiku.\nline1_syllables = 5\nline2_syllables = 7\nline3_syllables = 5\n\n# 2. The words in the haiku suggest the mathematical operations.\n# \"An August tempest\" (5) is the starting value.\n# \"brings winds of change\" suggests subtracting the second line's count (7).\n# \"A divine one yields\" suggests adding the third line's count (5).\nresult = line1_syllables - line2_syllables + line3_syllables\n\n# 3. The result is a number corresponding to a letter's position in the alphabet.\n# We can find the letter by converting the number. A=1, B=2, C=3...\n# chr(67) gives 'C', so we need to add 64 to our result.\nfinal_letter = chr(result + 64)\n\n# 4. Print the steps and the final answer.\nprint(f\"The number of syllables for each line are {line1_syllables}, {line2_syllables}, and {line3_syllables}.\")\nprint(\"The haiku's phrasing suggests the following equation:\")\nprint(f\"{line1_syllables} - {line2_syllables} + {line3_syllables} = {result}\")\nprint(f\"The {result}rd letter of the alphabet is the answer.\")\nprint(f\"The answer is: {final_letter}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
