    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):** We use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is at least ħ/2 (where ħ is the reduced Planck constant). We will use the minimum uncertainty:\n    Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\n2.  **Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p):** In the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) is quantized: L = n * ħ. For the first orbit, n=1, so L = ħ. The angular momentum is also defined as L = p * r, where p is the linear momentum and r is the orbital radius. Therefore, the momentum is:\n    p = L / r = ħ / r₁\n    Here, r₁ is the radius of the first Bohr orbit, which is the Bohr radius (a₀ ≈ 52.9 pm).\n    So, p = ħ / a₀\n\n3.  **Find the ratio (Δp / p):** We divide the expression for Δp by the expression for p:\n    Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)\n    The reduced Planck constant (ħ) cancels out, simplifying the formula to:\n    Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\n\n4.  **Substitute the given values and calculate:**\n    *   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 10 pm\n    *   Bohr radius (a₀) ≈ 52.9177 pm\n    We can now compute the numerical value of the ratio.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants and given values in picometers (pm)\n# Bohr radius (a0)\na0_pm = 52.9177\n# Uncertainty in position (delta_x)\ndelta_x_pm = 10.0\n\n# The ratio is calculated using the simplified formula: a0 / (2 * delta_x)\nratio = a0_pm / (2 * delta_x_pm)\n\n# Print the explanation and the final calculation\nprint(\"To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum (Δp) to the momentum (p) in the first Bohr orbit, we use the formula:\")\nprint(\"Ratio = Δp / p = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\")\nprint(\"\\nWhere:\")\nprint(f\"  a₀ (Bohr radius) = {a0_pm} pm\")\nprint(f\"  Δx (Uncertainty in position) = {delta_x_pm} pm\")\nprint(\"\\nPlugging in the values, the final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {a0_pm} / (2 * {delta_x_pm})\")\nprint(f\"\\nResult:\")\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio is: {ratio}\")\n```\n<<<2.645885>>>"
