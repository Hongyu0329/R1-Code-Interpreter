def solve_attack_graph_question():
    """
    This function identifies the incorrect statements about State Enumeration Graphs (SEG)
    and Logical Attack Graphs (LAG) from the provided list.
    """

    # Analysis Summary:
    # A: Correct. Both have worst-case exponential time complexity for generation.
    # B: Correct. SEGs are more expressive and can model non-monotonic paths that standard LAGs cannot.
    # C: Incorrect. The primary reason for the size difference is the abstraction from states to logical facts, not monotonicity itself.
    # D: Incorrect. Calculating probabilities in cyclic graphs is difficult, but not impossible. Methods exist.
    # E: Correct. Standard LAGs assume monotonicity and cannot handle negation as an effect of an action.

    # The incorrect statements are C and D.
    incorrect_statements = ['C', 'D']

    # The problem asks for the answer in alphabetical order with comma separation.
