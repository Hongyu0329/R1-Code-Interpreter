    # --- Plan Explanation ---
    # The goal is to find the impedance transformation ratio for optimum power transfer
    # from a diode source to a 50 ohm load, with a 20% margin.
    #
    # 1.  Calculate the diode's dynamic resistance (rd), which acts as the source impedance.
    #     The problem provides conflicting information. The most consistent approach is to
    #     calculate rd at the given operating point I2 = 0.445 A using the small-signal
    #     model: rd = n * Vt / I_dc.
    # 2.  Calculate the ideal impedance transformation ratio (K) for maximum power transfer,
    #     which is K = rd / RL.
    # 3.  Apply the 20% startup margin to the final ratio.
