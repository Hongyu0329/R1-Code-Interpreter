    Calculates the second osmotic virial coefficient from Steric-only behavior (B22,steric).

    The steric contribution to the second virial coefficient is based on the
    excluded volume of the molecule, modeled as a hard sphere. It is calculated
    as four times the partial specific volume of the protein.

    The experimental value provided (-7.585 mL/g) represents the total interaction
    (steric + electrostatic + other attractions) and is not needed to find the
    steric-only component, which is an intrinsic property of the molecule's size.
