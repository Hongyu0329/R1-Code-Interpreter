    "The main task is to identify the primary difference between a *cambré derrière* (a bend of the body backwards) in the Vaganova (Russian) and Balanchine (American) styles of ballet. I will analyze the key technical aspects of this movement in both methods to determine the most accurate answer from the choices provided.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the characteristics of a *cambré derrière* in the Vaganova method. The Vaganova method emphasizes precise, codified technique with a focus on stability and control.\n2.  Define the characteristics of a *cambré derrière* in the Balanchine method. The Balanchine style is known for its speed, dynamism, and emphasis on creating long, extended lines, often with an \"off-balance\" aesthetic.\n3.  Compare the two methods against the given answer choices (A, B, C, D, E).\n4.  The most fundamental difference is the Vaganova requirement for square, stable hips, while the Balanchine method often uses a lifted and open hip to create a more dramatic, spiraling line.\n5.  I will write a Python script that prints this explanation and then outputs the final correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef explain_ballet_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n    \"\"\"\n    vaganova_description = {\n        \"Focus\": \"Stability, control, and purity of line.\",\n        \"Hip Placement\": \"Hips must remain perfectly square to the direction the dancer is facing. There is no twisting in the pelvis.\",\n        \"Backbend\": \"The bend is initiated from the upper back (thoracic spine), maintaining a long, supported lower back.\",\n        \"Head\": \"The head follows the line of the arm, looking up and back without dropping.\"\n    }\n\n    balanchine_description = {\n        \"Focus\": \"Dynamism, speed, and creating long, dramatic lines.\",\n        \"Hip Placement\": \"The hip of the gesturing leg is characteristically lifted and opened. This creates a spiral through the torso and allows for a deeper, more visually dramatic backbend.\",\n        \"Backbend\": \"The bend is often deeper and involves more of the spine, facilitated by the open hip position.\",\n        \"Head\": \"The head is often thrown back more dramatically to accentuate the line.\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Comparing Cambré Derrière: Vaganova vs. Balanchine ---\\n\")\n    print(\"Vaganova Method:\")\n    for key, value in vaganova_description.items():\n        print(f\"- {key}: {value}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nBalanchine Method:\")\n    for key, value in balanchine_description.items():\n        print(f\"- {key}: {value}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"While there are differences in head placement and the potential degree of the backbend, the most fundamental and defining technical distinction is the 'Placement of hip'.\")\n    print(\"The Vaganova method's insistence on square hips versus the Balanchine method's signature lifted hip is the core difference that changes the entire quality and aesthetic of the movement.\")\n    \n    final_answer = \"B\"\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\")\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nexplain_ballet_difference()\n```"
