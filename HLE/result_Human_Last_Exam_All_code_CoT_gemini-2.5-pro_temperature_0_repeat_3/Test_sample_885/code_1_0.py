def find_starting_material():
    """
    This function identifies the starting material for the described Robinson annulation reaction.
    
    The reaction proceeds as follows:
    1. A starting material (a substituted beta-ketoester) is deprotonated by a base (KOMe).
    2. The resulting enolate acts as a nucleophile in a Michael addition to methyl vinyl ketone (MVK).
    3. The intermediate undergoes an intramolecular aldol condensation to form the final bicyclic product.

    By performing a retrosynthetic analysis on the product, ethyl 4-methyl-7-oxo-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7-octahydronaphthalene-4a-carboxylate,
    we can deduce the structure of the initial reactant.

    - The ring containing the 7-oxo group is formed from MVK.
    - The other ring, containing the 4-methyl and 4a-carboxylate groups, constitutes the starting material.
    - Tracing the positions of the substituents back through the reaction mechanism leads to a specific substituted cyclohexanone.
