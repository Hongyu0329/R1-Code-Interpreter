# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a space X
# with the given properties.
# Based on the topological analysis, we identified two such classes:
# 1. The class of spaces homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1] (an arc).
# 2. The class of spaces homeomorphic to the circle S^1.

# The number of such classes is therefore 2.
