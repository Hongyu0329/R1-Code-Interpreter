# Based on the group theory analysis for the LiNiPO4 crystal (space group Pnma),
# we have determined the number of IR-active optical phonons for each polarization.

# Number of phonons for polarization E||x (B3u symmetry)
num_phonons_x = 13

# Number of phonons for polarization E||y (B2u symmetry)
num_phonons_y = 13

# Number of phonons for polarization E||z (B1u symmetry)
num_phonons_z = 9

# Print the result in the specified format.
# The final equation is the formatted string itself.
