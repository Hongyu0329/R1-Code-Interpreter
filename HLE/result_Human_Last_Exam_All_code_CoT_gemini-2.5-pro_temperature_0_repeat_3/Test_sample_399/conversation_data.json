    "To solve the initial value problem, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Separate the variables**: The given differential equation is $x'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t)$, which can be written as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. This is a separable equation. We can rearrange it to have all terms involving $x$ on one side and all terms involving $t$ on the other.\n    $$\n    \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1)dt\n    $$\n2.  **Integrate both sides**: We integrate both sides of the separated equation.\n    $$\n    \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n    $$\n    This gives us:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n    $$\n    where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n3.  **Apply the initial condition**: We use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$ to find the value of $C$. Substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{8} = C\n    $$\n4.  **Find the particular solution**: Now we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n    To get an explicit solution for $x(t)$, we can first get a common denominator on the right side:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{4t^2 - 8t + 1}{8}\n    $$\n    And then solve for $x(t)$:\n    $$\n    x(t) = -\\frac{8}{4t^2 - 8t + 1}\n    $$\n5.  **Calculate x(1)**: Finally, we substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution to find $x(1)$:\n    $$\n    x(1) = -\\frac{8}{4(1)^2 - 8(1) + 1} = -\\frac{8}{4 - 8 + 1} = -\\frac{8}{-3} = \\frac{8}{3}\n    $$\n\nThe following Python code will perform the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# The explicit solution for x(t) is x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1)\n# We need to evaluate this at t = 1.\n\n# Define the coefficients and the value of t\nnumerator = -8\nt_squared_coeff = 4\nt_coeff = -8\nconstant = 1\nt = 1\n\n# Calculate the denominator\ndenominator = t_squared_coeff * (t**2) + t_coeff * t + constant\n\n# Calculate x(1)\n# We need to handle the case where the denominator is zero.\nif denominator == 0:\n    print(\"Error: Division by zero.\", file=sys.stderr)\n    # In a real scenario, this would mean the solution has a vertical asymptote at t=1.\n    # For this problem, the denominator is not zero.\nelse:\n    x_1 = numerator / denominator\n\n    # Print the calculation steps\n    print(\"The explicit solution is x(t) = -8 / (4*t^2 - 8*t + 1).\")\n    print(\"To find x(1), we substitute t=1 into the equation:\")\n    # Note: We use abs() for printing to make the subtraction clear.\n    print(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({t_squared_coeff}*({t})^2 - {abs(t_coeff)}*({t}) + {constant})\")\n    print(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({t_squared_coeff * t**2} - {abs(t_coeff) * t} + {constant})\")\n    print(f\"x(1) = {numerator} / ({denominator})\")\n    print(f\"The final value of x(1) is: {x_1}\")\n\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
