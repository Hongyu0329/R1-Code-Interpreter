# Define the given parameters
# c: Confidence of the discriminatory pattern in the subgraph G
c = 0.85
# s: Support of the discriminatory pattern
s = 0.12
# c_prime: Confidence of the anti-correlated pattern in the 2-hop neighborhood
c_prime = 0.78
# beta: Bottleneck coefficient of the knowledge graph
beta = 0.23

# --- Explanation of the model ---
# The problem is to determine the minimum ratio of evidence required (E_r)
# to confirm a fairness violation, given conflicting signals.
# We model this as the ratio of counter-evidence to the adjusted initial evidence.

# The initial evidence for the violation is the confidence 'c'.
# However, its reliability is reduced by:
# 1. The hourglass structure (bottleneck 'beta'), which can create local artifacts.
#    A low beta means the local finding is less trustworthy.
# 2. The low support 's', which means the pattern is rare and could be a statistical fluke.
# So, the adjusted strength of the initial evidence is: c * beta * s.

# The counter-evidence is the confidence 'c_prime' from the wider neighborhood,
# which is considered more reliable.

# The evidence ratio E_r is therefore the strength of the counter-evidence
# divided by the adjusted strength of the initial evidence.
# Formula: E_r = c_prime / (c * beta * s)
# A high E_r value means the counter-evidence strongly outweighs the initial finding,
# suggesting it's likely a statistical artifact.

# --- Calculation ---
# Calculate the adjusted strength of the initial evidence
adjusted_initial_evidence = c * beta * s

# Calculate the evidence ratio E_r
E_r = c_prime / adjusted_initial_evidence

# --- Output the results ---
