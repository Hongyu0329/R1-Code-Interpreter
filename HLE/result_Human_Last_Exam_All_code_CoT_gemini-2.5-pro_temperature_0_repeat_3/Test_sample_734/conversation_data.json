    "My plan is to identify the specific Christian theologian who developed a conceptual framework and terminology to explain how events like the virgin birth could occur without God violating the natural laws He established. This framework would also need to be applicable to potential changes in nature resulting from the Fall. The most fitting historical figure is Augustine of Hippo, with his doctrine of *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons). I will create a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the theologian who developed specialized terminology\n    for changes in the laws of nature.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    terminology = \"rationes seminales (seminal reasons)\"\n    \n    explanation = (\n        f\"The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe \"\n        f\"changes in the laws of nature was {theologian}.\\n\\n\"\n        f\"He proposed the concept of {terminology}. Augustine argued that God, at creation, \"\n        f\"embedded latent causal principles or potentialities within nature. A miracle, \"\n        f\"like the virgin birth, was not a violation of natural law, but the activation by God \"\n        f\"of a pre-ordained potentiality that existed outside the normal, observable course of nature.\\n\\n\"\n        f\"This framework could also be applied to understand the alterations in the natural world \"\n        f\"at the Fall, where the regular functioning of nature was changed from its original state.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(explanation)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
