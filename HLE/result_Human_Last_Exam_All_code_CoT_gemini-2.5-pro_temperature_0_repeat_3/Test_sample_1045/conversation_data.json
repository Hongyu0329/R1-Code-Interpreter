    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** The toluene molecule consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set:** This notation tells us how many contracted functions are used for each atom.\n    *   **For Carbon (a second-row atom):**\n        *   The core 1s orbital is described by 1 contracted function (made from 6 primitive Gaussians).\n        *   The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are split. The inner part (2s, 2p) is described by 4 contracted functions (1 for s, 3 for p), each made from 3 primitives. The outer part (2s, 2p) is described by another 4 contracted functions, each made from 1 primitive.\n        *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted functions.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (a first-row atom):**\n        *   It has no core orbitals. The valence 1s orbital is split. The inner part is 1 contracted function (from 3 primitives), and the outer part is 1 contracted function (from 1 primitive).\n        *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = 2 contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** We multiply the number of each type of atom by the number of functions per atom and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_C = 7\nnum_H = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\nfuncs_per_C = 9  # 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence)\nfuncs_per_H = 2  # 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence)\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Carbon atoms\ntotal_C = num_C * funcs_per_C\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Hydrogen atoms\ntotal_H = num_H * funcs_per_H\n\n# Calculate the grand total for the molecule\ngrand_total = total_C + total_H\n\n# Print the explanation and the final calculation\nprint(\"For a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"- Each Carbon atom (C) has {funcs_per_C} contracted basis functions.\")\nprint(f\"- Each Hydrogen atom (H) has {funcs_per_H} contracted basis functions.\")\nprint(\"\\nFor Toluene (C7H8):\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = ({num_C} C atoms * {funcs_per_C} functions/C) + ({num_H} H atoms * {funcs_per_H} functions/H)\")\nprint(f\"                = {total_C} + {total_H}\")\nprint(f\"                = {grand_total}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, a total of {grand_total} contracted Gaussian functions are used.\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
