    This function solves the given topology problem.

    The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a compact
    topological space X with two specific properties related to the long ray R.

    1.  X contains a dense copy of the long ray R. This means X is a
        compactification of R.

    2.  Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique
        continuous function on X. This is the universal property that defines
        the Stone-Cech compactification.

    These two properties together uniquely define the Stone-Cech compactification
    of the long ray, denoted as βR, up to homeomorphism.

    Therefore, any space X satisfying these conditions must be homeomorphic to βR.
    Since all such spaces are homeomorphic to one another, they all belong to a
    single homeomorphism class.

    The number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.
