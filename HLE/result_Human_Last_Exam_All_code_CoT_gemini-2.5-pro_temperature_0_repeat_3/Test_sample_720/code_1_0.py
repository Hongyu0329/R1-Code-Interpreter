def solve_curvature_cost():

    Calculates and explains the minimum curvature cost for the given NGD update rule.

    The problem asks for the minimum cost of the inversion operation in the NGD update rule
    for a specific neural network configuration (d x d linear layer, n samples, n < d).

    The matrix to be inverted is F + alpha * I, where F is the d^2 x d^2 Fisher matrix.
    A naive inversion would cost O((d^2)^3) = O(d^6).

    However, we can exploit the structure of the problem. The NGD update requires calculating
    the product of the inverse curvature matrix and the gradient: (F + alpha * I)^-1 * g.

    By applying the Woodbury matrix identity (a.k.a. the matrix inversion lemma), this
    calculation can be performed by inverting a smaller n x n matrix, where 'n' is the
    number of data samples. The cost of inverting an n x n matrix using standard algorithms
    like LU decomposition is O(n^3).

    Since the problem states that n < d, the alternative approach of inverting a d x d
    matrix (costing O(d^3)) is more expensive. Therefore, the minimum achievable cost
    for the core inversion operation is O(n^3).

    The final equation for the minimum cost is O(n^3).
    This script prints the components of this equation as requested.
