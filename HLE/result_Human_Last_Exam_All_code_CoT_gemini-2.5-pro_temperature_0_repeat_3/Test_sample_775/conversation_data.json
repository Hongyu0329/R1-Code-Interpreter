    "This is a fascinating problem in point-set topology. While one might intuitively try to construct complex, interlocking shapes to create multiple points of intersection, a fundamental theorem of topology provides a definitive answer.\n\nMy plan is to present the logical proof that solves this problem. Since a direct computation is not possible, I will use a Python script to walk through the steps of the proof, making the reasoning clear and explicit. The script will explain the theorem, apply it to the given problem, and state the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_topology_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the solution to a topology problem by presenting a logical proof.\n    The problem is to find the maximum number of connected components in the\n    intersection of two closed, connected sets whose union is the unit square.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The Problem:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 20)\n    print(\"Consider two closed, connected subsets of the plane, let's call them A and B.\")\n    print(\"Their union, A U B, is the unit square S = [0, 1] x [0, 1].\")\n    print(\"What is the largest possible number of connected components of their intersection, A ∩ B?\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The Proof:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 20)\n    print(\"We will prove that the intersection must be connected, which means it can only have one component.\")\n    print(\"The proof is by contradiction and relies on the fundamental properties of connected spaces.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"1. Initial Setup:\")\n    print(\"   - Let S be the unit square.

Thus, A' U B' covers all of S).\")\n    print(\"   - Intersection: The intersection of these new sets is empty, A' ∩ B' = ∅.\")\n    print(\"     (A' ∩ B' = (A \\\\ K) ∩ (B \\\\ H) = (A ∩ B) \\\\ (K U H).
