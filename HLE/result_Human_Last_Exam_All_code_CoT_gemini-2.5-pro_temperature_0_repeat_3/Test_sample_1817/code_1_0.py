    This function identifies the inappropriate implementations based on the Domain Model pattern.

    A. Describe all the order processing logic in the Controller.
       - This is an anti-pattern (Anemic Domain Model, Fat Controller). Business logic should not be in the controller. Inappropriate.

    B. Put all the order processing logic in the Order class.
       - This is an anti-pattern (God Object). The Order class becomes responsible for too much, including logic that belongs to Customer (discounts) and Book (inventory). Inappropriate.

    C. Put the discount rate calculation logic in the Customer class, the inventory check logic in the Book class, and the order confirmation logic in the Order class.
       - This is a good implementation of a Rich Domain Model, where objects have behavior. Appropriate.

    D. Describe the order processing logic in a domain service such as OrderService.
       - This is a valid pattern for logic that coordinates multiple domain objects. Appropriate.

    E. Order processing logic is divided and described in the Order class and domain services such as OrderService.
       - This is a very robust and common approach, combining a Rich Domain Model with Domain Services for orchestration. Appropriate.

    The inappropriate options are A and B.
