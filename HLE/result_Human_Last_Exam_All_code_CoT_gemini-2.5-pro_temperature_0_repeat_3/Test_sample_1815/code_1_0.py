    # The problem asks for the number of group topologies on the integers (Z) that are
    # both "totally bounded" and have "no nontrivial convergent sequences".

    # Step 1: A totally bounded group topology on a countable group is first-countable.
    # A standard result in topological group theory states that a Hausdorff, totally bounded
    # topology on a countable group is metrizable. Metrizable spaces are always first-countable.
    # We can also show that any non-Hausdorff group topology on Z would have nontrivial
    # convergent sequences, so we can restrict our search to Hausdorff topologies.
    # Therefore, any topology satisfying the given conditions must be first-countable.
    step1 = "A totally bounded group topology on the integers (Z) must be first-countable."

    # Step 2: A first-countable space with no nontrivial convergent sequences is discrete.
    # A space has no nontrivial convergent sequences if the only sequences that converge
    # are those that are eventually constant. For a first-countable Hausdorff space, this
    # property implies that every point must be an isolated point. If there were a
    # non-isolated point, one could construct a nontrivial sequence converging to it.
    # A space where every point is isolated has the discrete topology.
    step2 = "A first-countable topological space has no nontrivial convergent sequences if and only if it is the discrete topology."

    # Step 3: The topology must be the discrete topology.
    # Combining the conclusions from Step 1 and Step 2, any topology on Z that satisfies
    # the problem's conditions must be the discrete topology.
    step3 = "Therefore, any such topology on Z must be the discrete topology."

    # Step 4: The discrete topology on the integers is not totally bounded.
    # To check if the discrete topology is totally bounded, we must verify its definition:
    # for every open neighborhood U of the identity (0), there must exist a finite set
    # of elements {g_1, ..., g_n} such that g_1 U U ... U g_n U = Z.
    # In the discrete topology, the singleton set U = {0} is an open neighborhood of 0.
    # The covering condition becomes g_1{0} U ... U g_n{0} = {g_1, ..., g_n} = Z.
    # This requires a finite set to be equal to the infinite set of integers, which is impossible.
    step4 = "The discrete topology on Z is not totally bounded."

    # Step 5: Conclusion.
    # The conditions given in the problem are contradictory. There is no topology that can
    # satisfy all of them simultaneously.
    step5 = "This leads to a contradiction, meaning no such topology exists."

    # The number of such topologies is 0.
