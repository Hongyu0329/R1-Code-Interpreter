    "My plan is to answer the user's question about the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" by Jacek Dukaj. Since this is a knowledge-based question rather than a computational one, I will create a simple Python script. The script will store the name of the character in a variable and then use the `print` function to display the answer clearly.\n\n```python\n# This script answers the question about Jacek Dukaj's novel.\n# The main character of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski.\n# The character he marries is Angelina.\n\ncharacter_name = \"Angelina\"\n\nprint(\"The main character of 'Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość' marries a character named:\")\nprint(character_name)\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What's the name of the character that the main character of Jacek Duke's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonalość\" marries?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
