def solve_planar_set_problem():
    """
    This function analyzes the connectivity of a given planar set S and
    finds the number of points p in S such that S \ {p} has 3 or more
    connected components.

    The planar set S is the union of:
    1. The unit circle.
    2. The line segment {0} x [1/2, 3/2].
    3. The line segment [1/2, 3/2] x {0}.
    4. The line segment [-3/2, -1/2] x {0}.
    5. The line segment {0} x [-3/2, -1/2].
    6. The line segment [-1/2, 1/2] x {1}.
    7. The bottom-right quarter of the circle of radius 3/2.

    Analysis reveals that S is a single connected set. The points that can
    split S into multiple components are the junction points. We are interested
    in points that split S into 3 or more components.
