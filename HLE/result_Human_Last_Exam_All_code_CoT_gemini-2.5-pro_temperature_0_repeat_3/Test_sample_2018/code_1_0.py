# The computational factor is a constant used in the Carman-Kozeny source term
# for simulating melting. The question asks for the value used in the original
# methods paper before it was adjusted for a specific benchmark.

# Based on the foundational paper by Voller and Prakash (1987),
# the value is constructed from a base and an exponent.

# The base of the number
base = 1.6

# The exponent for the power of 10
exponent = 6

# Calculate the final value
computational_factor = base * (10**exponent)

# Print the components of the equation as requested
print("The original computational factor is the product of two numbers:")
print(f"Base number: {base}")
print(f"Power of 10: 10^{exponent}")
print("-" * 30)
# The final equation is C = 1.6 * 10^6
print(f"Final Equation: C = {base} * 10**{exponent}")
print(f"The value of the original computational factor is: {computational_factor}")
