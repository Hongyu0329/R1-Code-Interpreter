    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the type of curve:** The curve is a Lissajous curve, which is described by parametric equations of the form `x(t) = A sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = B sin(bt)`. In our case, `A=1`, `B=1`, `a=9`, `b=5`, and `δ = π/2` since `cos(9t) = sin(9t + π/2)`.\n\n2.  **Use the standard formula:** There is a well-known formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve, which depends on the parameters `a` and `b`.\n\n3.  **Check the conditions for the formula:** For the case where `a` and `b` are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1) and both are odd integers, the number of self-intersection points `N` is given by the formula:\n    `N = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2`\n\n4.  **Apply the formula:**\n    *   Our parameters are `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n    *   Check conditions:\n        *   The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is 1, so they are coprime.\n        *   Both 9 and 5 are odd numbers.\n    *   The conditions are met, so we can apply the formula.\n\n5.  **Calculate the result:** Substitute `a=9` and `b=5` into the formula to find the number of self-intersection points.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lissajous_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the curve\n    (cos(at), sin(bt)) for given a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The parameters for the curve x(t) = cos(9t), y(t) = sin(5t)\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    print(f\"The curve is a Lissajous curve with parameters a = {a} and b = {b}.\")\n    print(\"To find the number of self-intersections, we can use a standard formula.\")\n    \n    # The formula applies if a and b are coprime and both are odd.\n    # Let's verify the conditions.\n    # Condition 1: a and b are coprime (GCD is 1).\n    p, q = a, b\n    while q:\n        p, q = q, p % q\n    gcd = p\n    \n    # Condition 2: a and b are both odd.\n    are_both_odd = (a % 2 != 0) and (b % 2 != 0)\n\n    if gcd == 1 and are_both_odd:\n        print(f\"The parameters a={a} and b={b} are coprime and both are odd.\")\n        print(\"The formula for the number of self-intersections is: N = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2\")\n        \n        # Perform the calculation step-by-step\n        a_minus_1 = a - 1\n        b_minus_1 = b - 1\n        numerator = a_minus_1 * b_minus_1\n        num_intersections = numerator / 2\n        \n        print(\"\\nCalculating the result:\")\n        print(f\"N = ({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2\")\n        print(f\"N = {a_minus_1} * {b_minus_1} / 2\")\n        print(f\"N = {numerator} / 2\")\n        print(f\"N = {int(num_intersections)}\")\n        \n    else:\n        print(\"The conditions for the simple formula are not met.\")\n\nsolve_lissajous_intersections()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
