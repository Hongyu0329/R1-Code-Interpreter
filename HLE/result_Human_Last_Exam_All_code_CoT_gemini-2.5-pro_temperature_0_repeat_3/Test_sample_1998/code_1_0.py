# Step 1: Define the u-invariant for the base field.
# The field K is built upon a residue field k, which is built upon a finite field k_0.
# k_0 is a finite field of characteristic 2, e.g., F_{2^m}.
# The u-invariant of any finite field is 2.
u_k0 = 2
print(f"The u-invariant of the base finite field k_0 is u(k_0) = {u_k0}.")

# Step 2: Calculate the u-invariant of the residue field k.
# k is a local field of characteristic 2, k = k_0((t)).
# The u-invariant is given by the formula u(k) = 2 * u(k_0).
u_k = 2 * u_k0
print(f"The u-invariant of the residue field k is u(k) = 2 * {u_k0} = {u_k}.")

# Step 3: Calculate the u-invariant of the field K.
# K is a complete discretely valued field of characteristic 2 with residue field k.
# The u-invariant is given by the formula u(K) = 2 * u(k).
u_K = 2 * u_k
print(f"The u-invariant of the field K is u(K) = 2 * {u_k} = {u_K}.")

# Step 4: Calculate the smallest natural number N.
# The number N is given by the formula N = u(K)/2 + 1.
# We perform the calculation and ensure the result is an integer.
N = int(u_K / 2 + 1)

print(f"The smallest natural number N with the desired property is calculated using the formula N = u(K) / 2 + 1.")
print(f"N = {u_K} / 2 + 1 = {N}")
