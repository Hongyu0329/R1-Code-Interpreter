    "To determine which animal might hear human muscle twitches, we first need to understand the frequency of that sound and then compare it to the hearing ranges of the animals listed.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Establish the frequency range for the sound produced by human muscle contractions. This is a very low-frequency sound, often categorized as infrasound.\n2.  Create a data structure containing the approximate low-frequency hearing limit for each animal in the answer choices.\n3.  Write a Python script to iterate through each animal and compare its hearing threshold to the muscle twitch frequency.\n4.  The script will print its analysis for each animal, showing the numbers involved, to identify which ones have the necessary hearing capability.\n5.  Based on the script's output, I will identify the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_animal_hearing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which animal might be able to hear the low-frequency sound\n    of human muscle twitches.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the frequency of the sound source.\n    # Human muscle contractions produce sounds in the infrasound range.\n    muscle_twitch_low_hz = 10\n    muscle_twitch_high_hz = 30\n    print(f\"The sound from human muscle twitches is in the very low-frequency range of {muscle_twitch_low_hz}-{muscle_twitch_high_hz} Hz.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define the approximate low-frequency hearing thresholds for the animals.\n    # Data is based on scientific studies of animal hearing ranges.\n    hearing_thresholds = {\n        \"A.
