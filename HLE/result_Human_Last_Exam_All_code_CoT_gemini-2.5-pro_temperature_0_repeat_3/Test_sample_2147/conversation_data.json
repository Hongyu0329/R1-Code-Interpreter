    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the key figure, Pavel Milyukov, and the context of the quote, which is his criticism of Western culture in the early 20th century.\n2.  I will research his known views and writings on art and culture to determine which specific movements he targeted with such strong language. The \"X-Y\" format suggests a compound term for one or more related movements.\n3.  Based on historical records, Milyukov, a classical liberal and historian, was a staunch critic of the avant-garde art movements that were emerging at the time. He saw them as a sign of cultural decay.\n4.  The specific movements he famously criticized, which fit the \"X-Y\" pattern, are Cubism and Futurism.\n5.  I will then write a Python script to present this information clearly, defining the variables and printing the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the cultural movement criticized by Pavel Milyukov.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The historical figure mentioned in the question\n    historical_figure = \"Pavel Milyukov\"\n\n    # The placeholder for the term to be identified\n    placeholder = \"X-Y\"\n\n    # The derogatory phrase used\n    criticism = \"stagnant swamp\"\n\n    # Research identifies the specific avant-garde art movements Milyukov denounced.\n    x = \"Cubism\"\n    y = \"Futurism\"\n\n    # Combine the terms to match the \"X-Y\" format\n    answer_term = f\"{x}-{y}\"\n\n    # Print the solution clearly\n    print(f\"The question asks what 'X-Y' stands for in the context of Pavel Milyukov's criticisms.\")\n    print(f\"Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian politician and historian, denounced the modern art movements of his time.\")\n    print(f\"He specifically referred to {answer_term} as a '{criticism}'.\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, X-Y is: {answer_term}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer\nsolve_historical_riddle()\n```\n<<<Cubism-Futurism>>>"
