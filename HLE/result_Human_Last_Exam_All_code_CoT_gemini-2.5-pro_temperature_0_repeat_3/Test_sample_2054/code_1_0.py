Here is the step-by-step reasoning for the answers:

Let P_free be the decision problem "is the semigroup S free?"
Let P_not_free be the decision problem "is the semigroup S not free?"
P_free and P_not_free are complementary problems.

(a) If the problem of deciding whether S is not free is NP-hard, does that imply the problem of deciding whether S is free is also NP-hard?

Reasoning:
1. We are given that P_not_free is NP-hard.
2. By definition, the complement of an NP-hard problem is co-NP-hard. Therefore, P_free is co-NP-hard.
3. The question asks if P_free is also NP-hard.
4. If P_free were NP-hard, this would mean that the classes NP-hard and co-NP-hard are the same. This is only known to be true if NP = co-NP.
5. Since NP = co-NP is a major unproven conjecture in computer science, we cannot assume it is true. The implication must hold regardless of this conjecture.
6. Therefore, knowing a problem is NP-hard does not generally imply its complement is also NP-hard.

Answer: No.

(b) If the problem of deciding whether S is not free is NP-complete, does that imply the problem of deciding whether S is free is also NP-complete?

Reasoning:
1. We are given that P_not_free is NP-complete. This means (i) P_not_free is in NP, and (ii) P_not_free is NP-hard.
2. From these two facts, we can deduce properties of the complementary problem, P_free.
   - (i) P_not_free is in NP implies that P_free is in co-NP.
   - (ii) P_not_free is NP-hard implies that P_free is co-NP-hard.
3. Combining these, if P_not_free is NP-complete, then P_free is co-NP-complete.
4. For P_free to be NP-complete, it must be in NP and be NP-hard.
5. However, we only know P_free is in co-NP. For it to be in NP, it would require NP = co-NP.
6. Since the implication cannot rely on the unproven assumption that NP = co-NP, we cannot conclude that P_free is NP-complete.

Answer: No.

(c) If the problem of deciding whether S is free is in NP, and the problem of deciding whether S is not free is NP-hard, does that imply the problem of deciding whether S is free is NP-complete?

Reasoning:
1. We are given two premises: (i) P_free is in NP, and (ii) P_not_free is NP-hard.
2. To prove that P_free is NP-complete, we must show it is in NP (which is given) and that it is NP-hard.
3. Let's analyze the premises. Premise (i) states P_free is in NP. This implies its complement, P_not_free, is in co-NP.
4. Premise (ii) states that P_not_free is NP-hard.
5. So, we have a problem, P_not_free, which is both in co-NP and is NP-hard.
6. A key theorem in complexity theory states that if an NP-hard problem is also in co-NP, then NP = co-NP.
7. If NP = co-NP, then the classes NP-hard and co-NP-hard are identical.
8. We know P_not_free is NP-hard, which implies its complement, P_free, is co-NP-hard.
9. Since NP-hard = co-NP-hard (because NP = co-NP), P_free must also be NP-hard.
10. We were given that P_free is in NP, and we have just proven that it must also be NP-hard. By definition, a problem with these two properties is NP-complete.
11. The implication holds based on the premises.

Answer: Yes.
