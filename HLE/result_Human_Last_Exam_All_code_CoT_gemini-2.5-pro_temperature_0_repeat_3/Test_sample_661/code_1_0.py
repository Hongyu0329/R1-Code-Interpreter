def solve_knuth_bendix():
    """
    Solves the Knuth-Bendix completion for the given TRS.

    This function follows a detailed derivation based on the assumption that the
    intended signature ordering was f > g > h, as the one provided (f < g < h)
    causes the completion to fail immediately.

    Initial Rules (with f > g > h):
    R1: f(g(x), h(x)) -> g(x)
    R2: f(y, y) -> g(h(y))
    R3: f(g(x), h(y)) -> h(x)

    Step 1: Find critical pair between R1 and R3.
    - Overlap f(g(x1), h(x1)) and f(g(x2), h(y2)).
    - MGU is {x2 -> x1, y2 -> x1}.
    - This yields the critical pair <g(x1), h(x1)>.
    - With f > g > h, this orients to a new rule:
      R4: g(x) -> h(x)

    Step 2: Find critical pair between R1 and the new rule R4.
    - Overlap f(g(x), h(x)) and g(z).
    - Unify g(x) with g(z), MGU is {z -> x}.
    - The critical pair is <f(h(x), h(x)), g(x)>.
    - Normalizing f(h(x), h(x)) using R2 gives g(h(h(x))).
    - The normalized pair is <g(h(h(x))), g(x)>.
    - This orients to a new rule:
      R5: g(h(h(x))) -> g(x)

    Step 3: Find critical pair between R3 and R4.
    - Overlap f(g(x), h(y)) and g(z).
    - Unify g(x) with g(z), MGU is {z -> x}.
    - The critical pair is <f(h(x), h(y)), h(x)>.
    - Both terms are in normal form.
    - This orients to a new rule:
      R6: f(h(x), h(y)) -> h(x)

    Step 4: Further critical pairs lead to trivial pairs, and the original rules
    R1 and R3 are simplified and made redundant by the new rules. The set of
    added rules is {R4, R5, R6}.

    Step 5: Order the added rules by their LHS using LPO with f > g > h.
    - LHSs are g(x), g(h(h(x))), and f(h(x), h(y)).
    - LPO ordering: g(x) < g(h(h(x))) < f(h(x), h(y)).
