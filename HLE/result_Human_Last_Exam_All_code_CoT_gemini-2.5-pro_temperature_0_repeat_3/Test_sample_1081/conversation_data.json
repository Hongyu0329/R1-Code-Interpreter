    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Mathematical Background**: The problem asks for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$. A key result from the theory of algebraic groups over finite fields, established by Steinberg, states that this number is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n2.  **Identify the Weyl Group**: For a group of type $E_8$, the corresponding Weyl group is denoted as $W(E_8)$.\n3.  **Find the Number of Conjugacy Classes**: The number of conjugacy classes for the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a known mathematical constant. I will use this known value.\n4.  **Construct the Python Code**: I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Stores the number of conjugacy classes for exceptional Weyl groups (including $E_8$) in a dictionary.\n    *   Retrieves the value for $E_8$.\n    *   Prints the reasoning and the final answer, showing the relationship between the number of tori and the number of conjugacy classes, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to determine the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Fq-rational maximal tori for a reductive group of type E8.\n\n    This number is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the corresponding Weyl group W(E8).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A dictionary storing the number of conjugacy classes for exceptional Weyl groups.\n    # This is a known mathematical fact.\n    conjugacy_classes_of_weyl_groups = {\n        'G2': 6,\n        'F4': 25,\n        'E6': 25,\n        'E7': 60,\n        'E8': 112,\n    }\n\n    # The group type from the problem statement.\n    group_type = 'E8'\n\n    # Retrieve the number of conjugacy classes for the Weyl group W(E8).\n    num_classes = conjugacy_classes_of_weyl_groups[group_type]\n\n    # The number of Fq-rational maximal tori is equal to this number.\n    num_tori = num_classes\n\n    # Print the step-by-step reasoning as an \"equation\".\n    print(f\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a group of type {group_type} is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group W({group_type}).\")\n    print(f\"The number of conjugacy classes for W({group_type}) is {num_classes}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the equation is:\")\n    print(f\"Number of tori = Number of conjugacy classes in W({group_type}) = {num_tori}\")\n\nsolve_tori_count()\n```\n<<<112>>>"
