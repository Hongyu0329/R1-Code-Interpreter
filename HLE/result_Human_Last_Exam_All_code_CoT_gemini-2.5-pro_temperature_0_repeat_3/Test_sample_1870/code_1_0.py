    print("\nStep 1: Understanding the problem")
    print("The problem defines a tower of uncountable subsets of omega_1, <x_alpha : alpha < delta>, with three properties:")
    print("  1. Each x_alpha is an uncountable subset of omega_1.")
    print("  2. For alpha < beta < delta, the set difference |x_beta \\ x_alpha| is countable. This means the tower is increasing under the 'almost subset' relation (x_alpha <=* x_beta).")
    print("  3. There is no uncountable subset y such that |y \\ x_alpha| is countable for all alpha. This means the tower has no 'lower bound'.")

    print("\nStep 2: Identifying the corresponding cardinal characteristic")
    print("The minimal length 'delta' of such a tower is a cardinal number known as a cardinal characteristic.")
    print("Specifically, this 'delta' is the bounding number for omega_1, denoted b(omega_1).")
    print("So, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal possible value of b(omega_1).")

    print("\nStep 3: Establishing a lower bound in ZFC")
    print("A standard theorem in ZFC (provable by a diagonalization argument) states that for any regular uncountable cardinal kappa, b(kappa) > kappa.")
    print("Since omega_1 is a regular uncountable cardinal, we can apply this theorem with kappa = omega_1.")
    print("This gives us b(omega_1) > omega_1.")
    print("As b(omega_1) is a cardinal, it must be at least the next cardinal after omega_1, which is omega_2.")
    print("So, we have proved in ZFC that delta >= omega_2.")

    print("\nStep 4: Determining the 'minimal possible' value")
    print("The exact value of b(omega_1) is independent of the ZFC axioms; it can vary between different models of set theory.")
    print("The question for the 'minimal delta possible' asks for the smallest value of delta that is consistent with ZFC.")
    print("From Step 3, we know this minimal value is at least omega_2.")

    print("\nStep 5: Showing the lower bound is achievable")
    print("To prove that omega_2 is the minimal possible value, we must show that 'delta = omega_2' is consistent with ZFC.")
    print("We can do this by considering GÃ¶del's constructible universe, L, which is a model of ZFC.")
    print("In L, the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) holds. For omega_1, GCH states that 2^omega_1 = omega_2.")
    print("Another ZFC theorem states that b(omega_1) <= 2^omega_1.")
    print("Combining these facts, in the model L, we have: omega_1 < b(omega_1) <= 2^omega_1 = omega_2.")
    print("The only cardinal delta that satisfies 'omega_1 < delta <= omega_2' is delta = omega_2.")
    print("Since there is a model of ZFC where delta = omega_2, it is a possible value.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The minimal value for delta must be at least omega_2 in any model of ZFC, and it can be equal to omega_2 in some models.")
    print("Therefore, the minimal possible value for delta is omega_2.")
