    Explains why using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for emission densities is a good idea.

    explanation = """
    A single Gaussian distribution is defined by its mean and variance, forcing it into a symmetric, bell-shaped curve. This is often too restrictive for real-world data, which can have multiple peaks (multi-modal), be skewed, or have other complex shapes.

    A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) overcomes this limitation by combining multiple Gaussian distributions. This allows it to approximate virtually any continuous probability distribution.

    Let's analyze the given options:
    - A: Correct. This is the primary and most fundamental reason. GMMs are powerful because they can model complex, multi-modal distributions that are common in real-world data.
    - B: Correct, but more specific. Handling outliers is one of the benefits derived from the flexibility described in A.
    - C: Correct, but also more specific. The ability to represent clusters is another consequence of the modeling power described in A.
    - D: Incorrect. The number of Gaussian components (K) is a hyperparameter of the model and does not grow with the length of the data sequence.

    Since options B and C are specific instances of the general principle described in option A, A is the best and most comprehensive answer.
