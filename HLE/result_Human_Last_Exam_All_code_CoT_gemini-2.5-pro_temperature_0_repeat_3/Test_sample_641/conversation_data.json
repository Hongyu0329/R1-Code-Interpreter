    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Group Structure:** The group is `G = PSU(n, q)` where `n = 4` and `q = 997`. This group is the quotient of the special unitary group `S = SU(n, q)` by its center, `Z = Z(S)`. An involution is an element of order 2.\n\n2.  **Relate Involutions in PSU to Elements in SU:** An element `g = xZ` in `PSU(n, q)` (where `x` is in `SU(n, q)`) is an involution if and only if `g^2` is the identity element of `PSU(n, q)` and `g` is not the identity. This means `(xZ)^2 = x^2 Z = Z`, which implies `x^2` must be in the center `Z`. Also, `x` must not be in `Z`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Center of SU(4, 997):** The center `Z` of `SU(n, q)` consists of scalar matrices `cI` such that `c^n = 1` and `c` has a norm of 1 (i.e., `c^(q+1) = 1`). The size of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    *   For our case, `n = 4` and `q = 997`.\n    *   `d = gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n    *   So, the center `Z` has 2 elements: the identity matrix `I` and `-I`.\n\n4.  **Count Preimages of Involutions:** We need to count the number of elements `x` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `x` is not in `{I, -I}` and `x^2` is in `{I, -I}`. This means we need to find the number of elements `x` where:\n    a. `x^2 = I` (i.e., `x` is an involution in `SU`) and `x` is not `I` or `-I`.\n    b. `x^2 = -I`.\n\n5.  **Count Elements of Type (a):** These are the non-central involutions in `SU(4, q)`. The conjugacy classes of involutions in `SU(n, q)` are characterized by the dimension `k` of the (-1)-eigenspace, which must be an even number. For `n=4`, the possible values for `k` are 2 and 4.\n    *   `k=4`: This corresponds to the single element `-I`, which is in the center. We exclude this.\n    *   `k=2`: The number of such involutions is given by the formula `|SU(4, q)| / |C(t)|`, where `C(t)` is the centralizer of an involution `t` of this type. The formula for the number of these involutions simplifies to `q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`.\n\n6.  **Count Elements of Type (b):** We need to find the number of elements `x` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `x^2 = -I`. An eigenvalue `λ` of such an `x` must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`. Since `x` is a unitary matrix, its eigenvalues must also satisfy `λ^(q+1) = 1`. From `λ^2 = -1`, we get `λ^4 = 1`. This implies `λ^gcd(4, q+1) = 1`. As calculated before, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`. So, we must have `λ^2 = 1`. This leads to a contradiction (`1 = -1`), which is impossible as the characteristic of the field is not 2. Therefore, there are no elements `x` such that `x^2 = -I` in `SU(4, 997)`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Number:**\n    *   The total number of elements in `SU(4, 997)` that map to involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is the number of non-central involutions in `SU(4, 997)`, which is `q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`.\n    *   Each involution in `PSU(4, 997)` corresponds to `|Z| = 2` elements in `SU(4, 997)`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is `(q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)) / 2`.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to compute this value for `q = 997`.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # The formula for the number of involutions in PSU(4, q) for q odd\n    # is (q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)) / 2.\n\n    # Calculate the terms of the formula\n    q2 = q * q\n    q4 = q2 * q2\n    term1 = q2 - q + 1\n    term2 = q2 + 1\n\n    # Calculate the total number of involutions\n    # Using integer division // as the result is guaranteed to be an integer.\n    num_involutions = (q4 * term1 * term2) // 2\n\n    # Print the equation with the numbers substituted\n    print(\"The number of involutions is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"(q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)) / 2\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting q = 997:\")\n    print(f\"({q}^4 * ({q}^2 - {q} + 1) * ({q}^2 + 1)) / 2\")\n    print(f\"= ({q4} * ({q2} - {q} + 1) * ({q2} + 1)) / 2\")\n    print(f\"= ({q4} * {term1} * {term2}) / 2\")\n    print(f\"= {q4 * term1 * term2} / 2\")\n    print(f\"= {num_involutions}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<487640311335484739911165>>>"
