    """
    Analyzes the nonstandard analysis characterizations of continuity and identifies the correct one.

    The problem asks for the property equivalent to a map f: X -> Y being continuous,
    using the language of nonstandard analysis.

    Let's break down the core idea:
    1.  Standard Continuity (at a point x0): For any neighborhood V of f(x0),
        the preimage f_inv(V) is a neighborhood of x0.
    2.  Nonstandard Translation: A point x1 is infinitesimally close to a standard point x0 (x1 ~ x0)
        if and only if x1 is in every standard neighborhood of x0. This set of points is the monad of x0.
    3.  The Equivalence: The statement "f is continuous at a standard point x0" is equivalent to
        "f maps points infinitesimally close to x0 to points infinitesimally close to f(x0)".
        In other words, f maps the monad of x0 into the monad of f(x0).
    4.  Formalizing the Equivalence: This translates to:
        For a standard point x0, and any nonstandard point x1, if x1 ~ x0, then f(x1) ~ f(x0).
    5.  Continuity on the whole space: The function f is continuous if it is continuous at EVERY
        standard point x0 in X. Therefore, we must quantify over all standard points.

    This leads to the final statement:
    For all x0 in X, and for all x1 in X*, if x0 ~ x1, then f(x0) ~ f(x1).

    Let's check the options:
    A. forall x0, x1 in X: x0 ~ x1 => f(x0) ~ f(x1)
       - Incorrect. This only considers standard points and is too weak.

    B. forall x0 in X, forall x1 in X*: x0 ~ x1 => f(x0) ~ f(x1)
       - Correct. This perfectly matches our derived condition. It checks the behavior of the function
         in the infinitesimal neighborhood (monad) of every standard point.

    C. forall x0, x1 in X*: x0 ~ x1 => f(x0) ~ f(x1)
       - Incorrect. This is the definition of UNIFORM continuity, a stronger condition.
         It requires the property to hold for any pair of infinitesimally close points,
         even those "at infinity" (i.e., non-finite points).

    D, E, F are converses of the continuity conditions and are not equivalent to continuity.
