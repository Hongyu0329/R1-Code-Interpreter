    This script solves a problem from invariant theory to find the maximum

    The problem asks for the largest possible dimension of R/I, where:
    - R = C[x_1, ..., x_10] is the polynomial ring in 10 variables.
    - G is a finite group of order 10000, realized as a group of 10x10 complex matrices.
    - G acts on C^10.
    - I is the ideal generated by G-invariant polynomials of positive degree.
