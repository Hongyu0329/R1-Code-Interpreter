    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Define the problem**: We need to find the maximum number of solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$, where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 3. A solution to this equation is called a fixed point of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the composite function**: Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $m=3$ and $g(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n=3$. The composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $m \\times n = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n3.  **Formulate the equation**: The fixed points are the roots of the equation $h(x) = x$, which can be rewritten as $h(x) - x = 0$. Since $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, the equation $h(x) - x = 0$ is also a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n\n4.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra**: A polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 distinct real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9.\n\n5.  **Consider the constraints**: We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$. This means that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\n6.  **Analyze the derivative of the composite function**: The derivative of $h(x)$ is given by the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any value $y$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for any $x$, their product $h'(x)$ must also be positive for all $x$. This means $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n7.  **Check if the constraints limit the number of fixed points**: A strictly increasing function can intersect the line $y=x$ multiple times. To have 9 distinct fixed points, say $x_1 < x_2 < \\dots < x_9$, the polynomial $P(x) = h(x) - x$ must have 9 distinct real roots.\n\n8.  **Apply Rolle's Theorem**: If a differentiable function $P(x)$ has 9 distinct real roots, then its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $9-1=8$ distinct real roots.\n\n9.  **Analyze the derivative equation**: The derivative is $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$. So, for $P(x)$ to have 9 roots, the equation $h'(x) = 1$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n\n10. **Determine the degree of $h'(x)$**:\n    *   Let $f(x) = ax^3 + \\dots$, so $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + \\dots$ (a polynomial of degree 2).\n    *   Let $g(x) = px^3 + \\dots$, so $g'(x) = 3px^2 + \\dots$ (a polynomial of degree 2).\n    *   The composite function $f'(g(x))$ has a degree of $\\deg(f') \\times \\deg(g) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   The function $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ has a degree of $\\deg(f'(g(x))) + \\deg(g'(x)) = 6 + 2 = 8$.\n\n11. **Conclusion**: The equation $h'(x) = 1$ is a polynomial equation of degree 8. A polynomial equation of degree 8 can have up to 8 distinct real roots. This is consistent with the requirement from Rolle's theorem. Since it is possible for $h'(x)=1$ to have 8 roots, it is possible for $h(x)=x$ to have 9 roots. The constraints that $f'$ and $g'$ are always positive do not fundamentally restrict the number of wiggles in $h'(x)$ needed to achieve 8 roots for $h'(x)=1$. Therefore, the theoretical maximum of 9 fixed points is achievable.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the maximum number of fixed points\n    for the composition of two degree-3 polynomials with positive derivatives.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let f(x) and g(x) be polynomials of degree 3.\n    deg_f = 3\n    deg_g = 3\n\n    # The composition h(x) = f(g(x)) is a polynomial.\n    # The degree of the composite polynomial is the product of the degrees.\n    deg_h = deg_f * deg_g\n    \n    # A fixed point of h(x) is a solution to the equation h(x) = x.\n    # This is equivalent to finding the roots of the polynomial P(x) = h(x) - x.\n    # The degree of P(x) is the same as the degree of h(x).\n    deg_P = deg_h\n    \n    # By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree n has at most n real roots.\n    # Therefore, the number of fixed points is at most the degree of P(x).\n    max_fixed_points = deg_P\n\n    # The problem states that f'(x) > 0 and g'(x) > 0 for all x.\n    # This means f and g are strictly increasing functions.\n    # The derivative of h(x) is h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x).\n    # Since f' > 0 and g' > 0, h'(x) is also always positive.\n    # So, h(x) is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n    # We need to confirm if it's possible to achieve this maximum number of fixed points.\n    # For h(x) = x to have 9 distinct roots, by Rolle's Theorem, h'(x) = 1 must have at least 8 distinct roots.\n    # Let's determine the degree of h'(x).\n    # f'(x) is a polynomial of degree deg_f - 1 = 2.\n    # g'(x) is a polynomial of degree deg_g - 1 = 2.\n    # The degree of f'(g(x)) is (deg_f - 1) * deg_g = 2 * 3 = 6.\n    # The degree of h'(x) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x) is deg(f'(g(x))) + deg(g'(x)) = 6 + 2 = 8.\n    \n    # The equation h'(x) = 1 is a polynomial equation of degree 8.\n    # A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots.\n    # This means it is possible for h'(x) = 1 to have 8 roots, which in turn allows h(x) = x to have 9 roots.\n    # The constraints on f' and g' do not preclude this possibility.\n    \n    # The final equation for the number of fixed points is based on the degree of the composite polynomial.\n    # Maximum number of fixed points = deg(f) * deg(g)\n    final_equation_deg_f = 3\n    final_equation_deg_g = 3\n    result = final_equation_deg_f * final_equation_deg_g\n    \n    print(f\"Let f and g be polynomials of degree 3.\")\n    print(f\"The composite function h(x) = f(g(x)) is a polynomial of degree {final_equation_deg_f} * {final_equation_deg_g} = {result}.\")\n    print(f\"A fixed point of h(x) is a solution to h(x) = x, which is a polynomial equation of degree {result}.\")\n    print(f\"A polynomial of degree {result} can have at most {result} real roots.\")\n    print(f\"The conditions f'(x) > 0 and g'(x) > 0 do not reduce this maximum possible number.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is {result}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
