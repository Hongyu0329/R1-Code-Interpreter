    This function determines and prints the properties of a 1D Fermi-Hubbard system
    with on-site two-body losses in the long-time limit.

    The analysis concludes that the system evolves towards a Mott insulating state,
    for which the following properties hold:
    1. Zero tunneling (interpreted as gapped charge transport)
    3. Zero losses (no double occupancy)
    4. Spin entanglement (the ground state is a collective spin singlet)
    5. Anti-ferromagnetic-like spin correlations (due to superexchange)
