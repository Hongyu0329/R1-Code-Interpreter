    "My plan is to determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence by analyzing its potential to form a coiled-coil structure. Here's the step-by-step process that the code will follow:\n\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat:** Coiled-coils are defined by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The stability and oligomeric state are primarily determined by the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions, which form the hydrophobic core.\n2.  **Find the Best Alignment:** The code will test all seven possible starting frames for the heptad repeat on the given sequence. It will score each frame based on how many hydrophobic residues fall into the 'a' and 'd' positions. The frame with the highest score represents the most likely alignment.\n3.  **Analyze Core Residues:** Once the best alignment is found, the code will extract the list of amino acids at all 'a' positions and all 'd' positions.\n4.  **Apply Packing Rules:** The code will then apply established principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing to determine the oligomeric state:\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** Often formed by \"Leucine Zippers\" (Leucine at 'd' positions) or by having a size asymmetry between 'a' and 'd' positions (e.g., a small residue like Alanine at 'a' and a large one like Leucine at 'd'). The pattern of Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd' also strongly favors dimers.\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** Often prefers a bulky, beta-branched residue (like Isoleucine) at the more buried 'a' position.\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** A canonical pattern is Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd'.\n5.  **Conclude and Report:** Based on the pattern found, the code will print a detailed explanation of the analysis and conclude the most probable oligomeric state.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_oligomeric_state():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to determine its oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = \"GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG\"\n    hydrophobic_residues = {'A', 'V', 'I', 'L', 'M', 'F', 'Y', 'W'}\n    \n    best_frame_info = {\n        \"score\": -1,\n        \"frame\": -1,\n        \"a_residues\": [],\n        \"d_residues\": []\n    }\n\n    # 1.
