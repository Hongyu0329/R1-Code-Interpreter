# Step 1: Define the given parameters
# R0 is the basic reproduction number of the virus.
R0 = 3.0
# This is the percentage of vaccinated people who still got the infection.
breakthrough_rate = 0.06

# Step 2: Calculate the Vaccine Effectiveness (VE)
# We interpret the breakthrough rate as the vaccine's failure rate.
# VE is the reduction in infection for vaccinated individuals.
VE = 1 - breakthrough_rate

# Step 3: Calculate the herd immunity threshold (H)
# This is the proportion of the population that must be immune to stop the spread (Rt < 1).
# The formula is H = 1 - 1/R0.
herd_immunity_threshold = 1 - (1 / R0)

# Step 4: Calculate the critical vaccination coverage (p_critical)
# This adjusts the herd immunity threshold for the vaccine's effectiveness.
# The formula is p_critical = H / VE.
p_critical = herd_immunity_threshold / VE

# Convert the result to a percentage for the final output.
p_critical_percent = p_critical * 100

# --- Output the explanation and results ---
