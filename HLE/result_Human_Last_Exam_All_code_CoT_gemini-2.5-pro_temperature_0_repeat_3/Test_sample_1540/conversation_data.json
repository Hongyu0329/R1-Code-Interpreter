    "To solve this, I will write a Python script that calculates the memory usage for the most memory-efficient C program that solves the given problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Problem for a C Solution:** The core task is a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings.\n2.  **Devise a Memory-Efficient C Strategy:** To minimize memory, we should avoid storing both full strings in memory if possible. The most efficient strategy is to:\n    *   Read the first string into a character array (buffer). The maximum length is 100, so we need a buffer of size 101 to accommodate the null terminator (`\\0`).\n    *   Read the second string one character at a time using a function like `getchar()`.\n    *   As each character of the second string is read, compare it (case-insensitively) with the corresponding character in the buffer for the first string.\n    *   This approach avoids allocating a second large buffer for the second string.\n3.  **Identify Necessary Variables in C:**\n    *   A `char` array for the first string: `char s1[101];`\n    *   An `int` variable to hold the input from `getchar()`: `int c;` (`getchar` returns an `int` to handle the special `EOF` value).\n    *   An `int` variable to act as an index for the first string's buffer: `int i;`\n4.  **Calculate Memory Usage:**\n    *   Assume standard data type sizes on a typical competitive programming platform (32-bit or 64-bit system): `char` = 1 byte, `int` = 4 bytes.\n    *   Calculate the total memory by summing the sizes of the identified variables.\n5.  **Construct the Python Script:** The script will perform the calculation and print the breakdown of the memory usage, including the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the memory usage for the most memory-efficient C program\n    to solve the Petya and Strings problem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Standard sizes of C data types in bytes on most platforms\n    char_size_bytes = 1\n    int_size_bytes = 4\n\n    # --- Variable Analysis for the most memory-efficient C solution ---\n\n    # 1. A buffer is needed for the first string.\n    # The problem states the max length is 100. In C, a string needs\n    # an extra character for the null terminator ('\\0').\n    # Variable: char s1[101];\n    s1_buffer_size = (100 + 1) * char_size_bytes\n\n    # 2. To read the second string character by character without storing it all,\n    # we can use getchar(). getchar() returns an int to handle EOF.\n    # Variable: int c;\n    char_input_var_size = int_size_bytes\n\n    # 3. An index is needed to iterate through the first string's buffer\n    # while we read the second string.\n    # Variable: int i;\n    index_var_size = int_size_bytes\n\n    # --- Total Memory Calculation ---\n    total_memory_bytes = s1_buffer_size + char_input_var_size + index_var_size\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the memory usage (m) for the most memory-efficient C program.\")\n    print(\"The strategy is to store the first string, then read the second string character by character and compare on the fly.\")\n    print(\"\\nVariables required and their memory usage in bytes:\")\n    print(f\"- Buffer for the first string (char s1[101]): {s1_buffer_size} bytes\")\n    print(f\"- Variable for character input (int c): {char_input_var_size} bytes\")\n    print(f\"- Index for the buffer (int i): {index_var_size} bytes\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for total memory 'm' is:\")\n    print(f\"{s1_buffer_size} + {char_input_var_size} + {index_var_size} = {total_memory_bytes}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<109>>>"
