    "My approach to solving this problem involves addressing a contradiction in the mathematical literature through a computational check.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  The question asks for the number of distinct finite groups that contain a \"maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3\".\n2.  A well-known 1976 paper by Street and Whitehead provides a list of exactly 7 such groups.\n3.  However, my analysis and more recent mathematical papers suggest that one of the groups on this list, `C₂ × C₂ × C₂` (the elementary abelian group of order 8), may not actually possess this property. If true, the correct answer would be 6.\n4.  To resolve this ambiguity, I will provide a Python script that performs an exhaustive search on the group `C₂ × C₂ × C₂`.\n5.  The script will:\n    *   Generate every possible subset of size 3.\n    *   Check each subset to see if it is product-free.\n    *   For each product-free set, check if it is maximal by inclusion (i.e., it cannot be extended by adding another element from the group while remaining product-free).\n6.  The script will then print its findings. If it finds 0 such sets in `C₂ × C₂ × C₂`, it confirms this group should be excluded from the original list, making the final answer 6. Otherwise, the answer is 7.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the number of finite groups containing a maximal\n    by inclusion product-free set of size 3 by computationally verifying a\n    disputed case.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Plan:\n    # 1. A 1976 theorem by Street and Whitehead states there are 7 such groups.\n    # 2. More recent analysis suggests one group, C₂ × C₂ × C₂, may not qualify.\n    # 3.
