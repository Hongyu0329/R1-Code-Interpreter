# Step 1: Define n1 and n2.
# Based on the analysis of the order of the Picard-Fuchs equation,
# the conditions are satisfied for all even integers n > 2.
# The two smallest such integers are 4 and 6.
n1 = 4
n2 = 6

# Step 2: Calculate the argument alpha.
# The argument for the function T is given by the formula (n1 - 1) / n2.
alpha_numerator = n1 - 1
alpha_denominator = n2
alpha = alpha_numerator / alpha_denominator

# Step 3: Define and evaluate the hypergeometric period function T(alpha).
# The Hamiltonian simplifies to that of a simple harmonic oscillator, whose period
# involves pi. The hypergeometric period function T(alpha) is identified as
# T(alpha) = pi / sin(pi * alpha), based on the Beta function B(alpha, 1-alpha).
result = math.pi / math.sin(math.pi * alpha)

# Step 4: Output the numbers in the final equation.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation T((n1-1)/n2) = result.
