    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the compound's structure and name from the provided data.\n\n**1. Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. A saturated acyclic alkane with 7 carbons would have the formula $C_nH_{2n+2}$, which is $C_7H_{16}$. The given compound has two fewer hydrogens, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This means the compound contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**2. Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe data provides the chemical shift (in ppm) and the multiplicity of each signal, which tells us the number of attached hydrogens (s = 0H, d = 1H, t = 2H, q = 3H).\n*   **145(s) and 112(t):** The chemical shifts greater than 100 ppm are characteristic of sp² hybridized carbons, confirming the presence of a C=C double bond. The signal at 145 ppm is a singlet (s), meaning it's a quaternary carbon (no attached H). The signal at 112 ppm is a triplet (t), meaning it's a CH₂ group. Together, these two signals strongly indicate a terminal alkene group of the type `>C=CH₂`.\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbons. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, producing a single overlapping signal.\n\n**3. Assemble the Structure**\nLet's identify the fragments of the molecule:\n*   **Fragment 1:** A `>C=CH₂` group, from the signals at 145(s) and 112(t).\n*   **Remaining Fragments:** We have 4 other signals: 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q). These correspond to a `-CH₂-` group, a `-CH-` group, and two different `-CH₃` groups.\n*   **Putting it together:** The structure must account for 7 carbons in total. The 6 signals correspond to 6 unique carbon environments. The 7th carbon must be part of a symmetric group. The presence of a `-CH-` group (27d) and two `-CH₃` groups (one of which must be for the two equivalent carbons) strongly suggests an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH₃)₂`. The remaining `-CH₂-` (48t) and `-CH₃-` (one of the q signals) must form an ethyl group, `-CH₂CH₃`.\n*   The only way to form a stable molecule is to attach both the ethyl group and the isopropyl group to the quaternary carbon of the alkene.\n\nThe resulting structure is:\n```\n      CH₃\n       |\n  CH₃-CH-C=CH₂\n        |\n        CH₂-CH₃\n```\n\n**4. Determine the IUPAC Name**\nTo name the compound, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. This is a 4-carbon chain (a butene). We number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond.\n*   The double bond is between C1 and C2.\n*   There is an ethyl group on C2.\n*   There is a methyl group on C3.\nThe IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene**.\n\nThe following Python code prints this detailed explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Given data\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't', 27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n    \n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze Molecular Formula\n    print(\"1.
