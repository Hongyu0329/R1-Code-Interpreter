Based on the information provided, here is a critical counseling recommendation for Allison:

The most immediate concern is the combination of her new prescription for Fluoxetine and the Excedrin she took for her headache.

1.  **Drug Interaction Warning:** The pharmacist should inform Allison that taking Fluoxetine {fluoxetine_dose}, which is an SSRI, together with Excedrin, which contains aspirin (an NSAID), significantly increases the risk of bleeding, particularly in the stomach. She should be advised to watch for symptoms like dark stools, stomach pain, or vomiting blood. For future headaches, it would be safer to use a product with only acetaminophen, after checking with her doctor.

2.  **Follow-up on Symptoms:** The pharmacist should also strongly recommend that Allison contact her doctor about her new headaches and the unusual symptom of smelling sea water. New or worsening headaches can be a side effect of both her Junel Fe {junel_fe_dose} and Fluoxetine {fluoxetine_dose}. When combined with an olfactory hallucination (unusual smell), it could indicate a migraine with aura, which is a serious condition that needs to be evaluated, especially since she is taking a combined oral contraceptive.

Her other prescription, Atorvastatin {atorvastatin_dose}, is less likely to be related to these specific symptoms, but her doctor should be aware of all the medications she is taking.
