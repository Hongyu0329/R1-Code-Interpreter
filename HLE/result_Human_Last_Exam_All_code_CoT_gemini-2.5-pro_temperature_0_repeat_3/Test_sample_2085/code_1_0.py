    # Step 1: Explain the origin of the name.
    print("1. Origin: The name 'Odobeccus' is the Latin form of a name belonging to a 4th-century Frankish chieftain. The Franks were a Germanic people, so the name's origin is Germanic, not Gaulish (Celtic).")
    print("")

    # Step 2: Break down the name and trace the main root.
    print("2. Etymology: The name can be broken down into 'Odo-' and '-beccus'.")
    print("   - The main part, 'Odo-', comes from the Germanic root '*audaz', meaning 'wealth' or 'prosperity'.")
    print("   - In the evolution from Germanic/Latin to French, the name 'Odo' consistently became 'Eudes'.")
    print("   - A well-known historical example is 'Odo of Paris', who is known in French as 'Eudes de Paris'.")

    # Step 3: Explain the suffix and conclude.
    print("3. Conclusion: The suffix '-beccus' does not have a standard equivalent and was likely dropped over time, a common process for names.")
    print("   Therefore, the modern French equivalent is derived from the principal part of the name.")
