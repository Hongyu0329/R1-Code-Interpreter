    "To determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure**: A standard barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two complete graphs (K5 cliques), each with 5 nodes. These two cliques are connected by a single edge, which is known as the bottleneck or bridge. Let's call the two nodes connected by this bridge `u` and `v`.\n\n2.  **Understand the Gossiping Process**: Randomized uniform gossiping involves two steps:\n    a. A node is selected uniformly at random from the set of all `N` nodes. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/N`.\n    b. The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random. The probability of it choosing a specific neighbor is `1/degree`, where `degree` is the number of neighbors the selected node has.\n\n3.  **Identify the Degrees of Bottleneck Nodes**: We need to find the degrees of nodes `u` and `v`.\n    *   Node `u` is part of a K5 clique, so it is connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique.\n    *   It is also connected to node `v` through the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the total degree of `u` is `deg(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   By symmetry, the degree of `v` is also `deg(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Probability**: The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` can be sampled in two distinct ways:\n    *   **Scenario 1**: Node `u` is selected first, and then it selects `v`.\n        *   Probability = `P(select u) * P(u selects v) = (1/N) * (1/deg(u))`\n    *   **Scenario 2**: Node `v` is selected first, and then it selects `u`.\n        *   Probability = `P(select v) * P(v selects u) = (1/N) * (1/deg(v))`\n\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the final probability.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    barbell graph with 10 nodes using randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the barbell graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # A 10-node barbell graph consists of two K5 cliques.\n    # The size of each clique is:\n    clique_size = total_nodes / 2\n\n    # The bottleneck edge connects a node 'u' from the first clique\n    # and a node 'v' from the second clique.\n\n    # Calculate the degree of the node 'u' at one end of the bottleneck.\n    # It is connected to (clique_size - 1) nodes in its own clique,\n    # plus 1 connection via the bottleneck edge.\n    degree_u = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n    # By symmetry, the degree of node 'v' is the same.\n    degree_v = degree_u\n\n    # The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge (u, v) is the sum of two cases:\n    # 1. Node u is picked, and it chooses v.\n    # 2. Node v is picked, and it chooses u.\n    # Formula: P = (1/N) * (1/deg(u)) + (1/N) * (1/deg(v))\n\n    # Calculate the probability of the first case\n    prob_u_to_v = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_u)\n\n    # Calculate the probability of the second case\n    prob_v_to_u = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_v)\n\n    # The total probability is the sum of the two cases\n    total_probability = prob_u_to_v + prob_v_to_u\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(\"P(sample edge) = P(select u) * P(u selects v) + P(select v) * P(v selects u)\")\n    print(f\"P(sample edge) = (1/{int(total_nodes)}) * (1/{int(degree_u)}) + (1/{int(total_nodes)}) * (1/{int(degree_v)})\")\n    print(f\"P(sample edge) = {prob_u_to_v} + {prob_v_to_u}\")\n    print(f\"P(sample edge) = {total_probability}\")\n    print(\"\\nAs a fraction, the probability is 2/50, which simplifies to 1/25.\")\n\nsolve_gossip_probability()\n```\n<<<0.04>>>"
