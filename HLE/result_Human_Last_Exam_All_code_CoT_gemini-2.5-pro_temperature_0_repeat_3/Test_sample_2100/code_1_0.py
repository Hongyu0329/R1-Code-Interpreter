# The man described in the riddle is Nikolai Rezanov.
# He was a Russian nobleman and statesman who promoted the project of Russian colonization of the Americas.
# The poet Andrei Voznesensky wrote the poem "Avos!", which was adapted into the rock opera "Juno and Avos", romanticizing Rezanov's story.
# Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk, and his grave was lost after the cathedral where he was buried was destroyed.
# In the late 1980s, a memorial was erected at his presumed burial site.
