    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar\", we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the base molecule**: The base molecule is the \"nanocar\". We will use the structure of the first synthesized nanocar as our reference.\n2.  **Find the chemical formula**: The original nanocar molecule has a complex structure consisting of a chassis, axles, and four fullerene (C60) wheels. Its chemical formula is C278H30. The crucial part of this formula is the number of hydrogen atoms, which is 30.\n3.  **Interpret the \"perfluoro-\" prefix**: In chemical nomenclature, the prefix \"perfluoro-\" signifies that all hydrogen atoms in the original organic molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms.\n4.  **Calculate the number of fluorine atoms**: Since there are 30 hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar, a \"perfluoronanocar\" would have all 30 of these hydrogens replaced by 30 fluorine atoms.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and explains this result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fluorine_atoms_in_perfluoronanocar():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical formula for the original nanocar is C278H30.\n    # We are interested in the number of hydrogen atoms.\n    num_hydrogens_in_nanocar = 30\n\n    # The prefix \"perfluoro-\" means every hydrogen atom (H) is replaced by a fluorine atom (F).\n    # This is a one-to-one replacement.\n    num_fluorine_replaces_hydrogen = 1\n\n    # Calculate the total number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version.\n    total_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogens_in_nanocar * num_fluorine_replaces_hydrogen\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(\"The base molecule, a nanocar, has 30 hydrogen atoms.\")\n    print(\"In a 'perfluoro-' compound, each hydrogen atom is replaced by one fluorine atom.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{num_hydrogens_in_nanocar} (hydrogens) * {num_fluorine_replaces_hydrogen} (fluorine per hydrogen) = {total_fluorine_atoms} (total fluorines)\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, a hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain {total_fluorine_atoms} fluorine atoms.\")\n\ncalculate_fluorine_atoms_in_perfluoronanocar()\n```\n<<<30>>>"
