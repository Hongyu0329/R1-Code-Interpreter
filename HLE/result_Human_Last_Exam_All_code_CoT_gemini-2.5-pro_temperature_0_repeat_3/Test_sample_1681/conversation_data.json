    "To find the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma, we will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, which is a standard framework for quantizing 2-player, 2-strategy games.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Setup the Game**: We'll define the payoff matrix provided by the user. The game starts with a maximally entangled initial state, created by an entangling operator `J`.\n2.  **Define Strategies**: The classical strategies, Cooperate (C) and Defect (D), are represented by specific unitary operators. We will also introduce a \"miracle\" quantum strategy, `Q`, which is not available in the classical game.\n3.  **Calculate Payoffs**: We will create a Python function that takes the strategies of the two players (Alice and Bob) as input and calculates their expected payoffs. This involves applying the players' strategy operators and the entangling operator `J` to an initial state, and then calculating the probabilities of the four classical outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD).\n4.  **Identify Equilibrium**: We will test the strategy pair `(Q, Q)`.\n    *   First, we'll calculate the payoff for `(Q, Q)` to see the outcome when both players use the quantum strategy.\n    *   Second, to confirm this is a Nash Equilibrium, we'll check if either player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy. We'll calculate the payoffs if one player deviates to C or D while the other sticks with Q.\n5.  **Present the Result**: The final code will print the analysis, showing that `(Q, Q)` is indeed a stable equilibrium that resolves the classical dilemma. It will conclude by printing the final payoff calculation in equation form, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function sets up and solves the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma,\n    demonstrating the Nash Equilibrium that resolves the classical dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
