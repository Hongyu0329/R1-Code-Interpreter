def solve_critical_exponent():
    """
    This function solves for the other critical exponent in the given inequality.

    The problem describes a decoupling inequality for the cone in R^3. The best
    exponent alpha is a piecewise linear function of 1/p for p > 2. The
    "critical exponents" are the values of p where the slope of alpha as a
    function of 1/p changes.

    From the theory of harmonic analysis, specifically Fourier restriction and
    decoupling for the cone, it is known that there are two such critical exponents.

    1. p = 4: This is the Tomas-Stein exponent, related to linear Kakeya-type examples.
       This exponent is given in the problem.

    2. p = 3: This exponent arises from the ruled structure of the cone, leading to
       phenomena captured by multilinear restriction estimates (the Wolff-Tao endpoint).

    The code will use this established theoretical knowledge to find the answer.
