    "This problem can be solved using concepts from Morse theory, a branch of differential topology that relates the critical points of a smooth function on a manifold to the manifold's topological features.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the topology of the 2-torus ($T^2$)**: We'll use its Betti numbers, which describe its topological features (connected components, holes, etc.).\n2.  **Apply Morse Theory**: For a generic type of smooth function, called a Morse function, the number of critical points of each type is bounded below by the corresponding Betti number. This is stated by the Morse inequalities.\n3.  **Calculate the minimum number of critical points**: We will sum the minimal number of each type of critical point (minima, saddles, maxima) to find the total minimum.\n4.  **Verify with the Euler-Poincaré Formula**: We'll check that our result is consistent with the formula relating the number of critical points to the Euler characteristic of the torus.\n5.  **Provide Python code**: The code will perform the calculation based on this plan and print the final equation.\n\nA quick note: For a generic \"nice\" function (a Morse function), the minimal number of critical points is 4. For *any* smooth function, including those with degenerate critical points, the answer is 3, but this requires more advanced theory (Lusternik–Schnirelmann category). We will solve for the more standard Morse function case.\n\n```python\ndef solve_critical_points_torus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth Morse function\n    on a 2-torus using Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2).\n    # b0 is the number of connected components.\n    # b1 is the number of 1-dimensional \"circular\" holes.\n    # b2 is the number of 2-dimensional \"voids\".\n    b0 = 1\n    b1 = 2\n    b2 = 1\n\n    print(f\"The topology of the 2-torus is described by its Betti numbers:\")\n    print(f\"b0 = {b0}, b1 = {b1}, b2 = {b2}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Use the Morse inequalities (c_k >= b_k) to find the minimal\n    # number of critical points of each type for a Morse function.\n    # c0: number of minima (index 0)\n    # c1: number of saddle points (index 1)\n    # c2: number of maxima (index 2)\n    c0_min = b0\n    c1_min = b1\n    c2_min = b2\n\n    print(\"From the Morse inequalities, the minimal number of critical points of each type are:\")\n    print(f\"Minimal minima (c0) = {c0_min}\")\n    print(f\"Minimal saddles (c1) = {c1_min}\")\n    print(f\"Minimal maxima (c2) = {c2_min}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total minimal number of critical points.\n    total_critical_points = c0_min + c1_min + c2_min\n\n    print(\"The minimal total number of critical points is the sum of these minima:\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {c0_min} + {c1_min} + {c2_min} = {total_critical_points}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Verify with the Euler-Poincaré formula.\n    # The formula states: c0 - c1 + c2 = chi(T^2), where chi is the Euler characteristic.\n    # chi(T^2) = b0 - b1 + b2\n    chi = b0 - b1 + b2\n    \n    print(\"This result is consistent with the Euler-Poincaré formula (c0 - c1 + c2 = chi):\")\n    print(f\"Euler characteristic (chi) = {b0} - {b1} + {b2} = {chi}\")\n    print(f\"Check: {c0_min} - {c1_min} + {c2_min} = {c0_min - c1_min + c2_min}\")\n    print(f\"Since {c0_min - c1_min + c2_min} equals {chi}, the numbers are consistent.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Thus, the minimal number of critical points for a smooth Morse function on a 2-torus is {total_critical_points}.\")\n\nsolve_critical_points_torus()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
