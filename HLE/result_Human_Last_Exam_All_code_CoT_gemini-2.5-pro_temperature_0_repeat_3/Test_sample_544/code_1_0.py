    This function returns the IUPAC name of the product from the reaction of
    methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide.
    """
    # The reaction is a Pummerer rearrangement.
    # Reactants:
    # 1. Methyl phenyl sulfoxide: Ph-S(=O)-Me
    # 2. Triflic anhydride: (CF3SO2)2O
    # 3. Trimethylsilyl cyanide: (CH3)3SiCN
    #
    # The reaction proceeds via activation of the sulfoxide, deprotonation
    # to form a Pummerer intermediate, and nucleophilic attack by cyanide.
    #
    # The final product structure is Ph-S-CH2-CN.
    #
    # IUPAC Naming:
    # - The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN).
    # - The parent chain is acetonitrile (CH3CN).
    # - A substituent, phenylthio (Ph-S-), is attached to the methyl carbon.
    #
    # Hence, the name is (phenylthio)acetonitrile.
