    "Of course. Here are the two primary problems with the JTB definition of knowledge, ignoring Gettier problems, presented in a Python script that will print the explanation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the JTB Definition:** Break down the \"Justified True Belief\" model into its core components.\n2.  **Identify Problem 1 (The Regress Problem):** Focus on the \"Justification\" component. If every justification needs its own justification, this creates an infinite regress. The JTB model does not solve this.\n3.  **Identify Problem 2 (The Strength/Fallibility Problem):** Focus on the tension between fallible human justification and the requirement for absolute truth. JTB doesn't specify how strong a justification needs to be to guarantee it connects to truth, leading to a choice between skepticism (if justification must be infallible) or vagueness (if it can be fallible).\n4.  **Construct a Python Script:** Write a simple script that uses `print()` statements to clearly explain these two problems. This fulfills the request for a code block.\n5.  **Format the Output:** Ensure the script is well-commented and the output is easy to read.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints an explanation of two non-Gettier problems with the\n    Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Ignoring Gettier problems, the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge runs into several issues.

If justification must be infallible (guaranteeing truth), then it becomes nearly impossible to know anything, leading to radical skepticism.\")\n    print(\"  2.
