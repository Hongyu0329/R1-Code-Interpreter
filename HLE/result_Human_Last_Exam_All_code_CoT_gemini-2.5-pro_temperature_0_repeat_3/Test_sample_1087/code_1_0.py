    This function calculates the largest real number r based on the geometric problem.

    The problem constraints imply a graph-theoretic structure on the distances between the 5 points.
    If we classify distances as "short" (< r) or "long" (>= r), the problem states that no three
    points form a triangle with all "short" or all "long" sides. For 5 points, this forces the
    graph of "short" distances to be a 5-cycle.

    This is geometrically realized by arranging the points in a configuration that resembles a
    regular pentagon. For a regular pentagon with side 's' and diagonal 'd', the condition is
    s < r <= d. To maximize r, we must maximize d.

    The problem thus becomes finding the maximum possible diagonal length 'd' of a regular
    pentagon that can fit inside a unit square. The known solution to this geometric
    problem is d = sec(27°).

    This script calculates that value.
