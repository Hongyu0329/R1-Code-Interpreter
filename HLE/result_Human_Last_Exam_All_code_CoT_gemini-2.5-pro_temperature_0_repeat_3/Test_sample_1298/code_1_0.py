    # Step 1: Analyze the patient's presentation.
    # The patient has a mole with features of melanoma (changing, irregular, dark).
    # She also has systemic symptoms (fatigue, weight loss) and signs of spread
    # (new dark spots, hip pain, shortness of breath).
    print("Patient presentation suggests malignant melanoma with metastasis.")

    # Step 2: Interpret diagnostic findings.
    # Pericardiocentesis revealed malignant cells in the fluid around the heart.
    # This confirms the cancer has spread, causing a life-threatening malignant pericardial effusion.
    print("Diagnosis is confirmed as Stage IV (metastatic) malignant melanoma.")

    # Step 3: Evaluate management options.
    # The immediate emergency (cardiac tamponade) was managed with pericardiocentesis.
    # The next step must address the underlying widespread cancer.
    print("The next step must be a systemic treatment to target cancer cells throughout the body.")

    # Step 4: Choose the best option.
    # A, B, H are symptomatic treatments, not curative.
    # F is for infection (not present).
    # E is the opposite of what's needed (immunotherapy, not suppression, is used).
    # G is a local therapy, not for widespread disease.
    # D, Chemotherapy, is a systemic therapy designed to kill malignant cells throughout the body.
    # This is the most appropriate choice to treat the underlying cause.
    print("Chemotherapy is the systemic treatment option provided that addresses the widespread malignant cells.")

    # Final Answer
    final_answer = "D"
    print(f"The next best step is D. Chemotherapy to kill the malignant cells.")
