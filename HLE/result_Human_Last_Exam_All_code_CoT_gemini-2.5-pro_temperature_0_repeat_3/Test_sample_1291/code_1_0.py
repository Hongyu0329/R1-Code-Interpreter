    print("Points are classified by type:")
    print(" - Type 1: Classical points (like points in C_p), correspond to disks of radius 0.")
    print(" - Type 2: Disks with a center in C_p and a positive, finite radius.")
    print(" - Type 3: Do not exist over C_p.")
    print(" - Type 4: The Gauss point, corresponds to a disk of infinite radius.\n")

    print("Step 2: Analyze the parameter space and its geometric interpretation.")
    print("The space is C_p^x * C_p, with points (z_0, z).")
    print("A point (z_0, z) can be interpreted as defining a disk D(z, |z_0|_p).\n")

    print("Step 3: Determine the range of possible disks.")
    print("The center of the disk is z, which can be any element of C_p.")
    print("The radius of the disk is |z_0|_p.")
    print("Since z_0 is in C_p^x, z_0 is not zero and has a finite p-adic norm.")
    print("Therefore, the radius |z_0|_p must be a positive and finite real number.\n")

    print("Step 4: Match the possible disks to the point types.")
    print(" - Disks with positive, finite radius are Type 2 points. Our construction generates all of these.")
    print(" - To get a Type 1 point, we would need radius = 0, which means |z_0|_p = infinity. This is not possible for z_0 in C_p.")
    print(" - To get the Type 4 point, we would need radius = infinity, which means |z_0|_p = 0. This is not possible as z_0 is in C_p^x (z_0 is non-zero).\n")

    print("Step 5: Conclusion.")
    print("The construction only generates disks with positive, finite radii.")
    print("These correspond exactly to the Type 2 points of the Berkovich projective line.")
    print("The equivalence relation given is consistent with this mapping, ensuring that different parameters defining the same disk are identified.")
