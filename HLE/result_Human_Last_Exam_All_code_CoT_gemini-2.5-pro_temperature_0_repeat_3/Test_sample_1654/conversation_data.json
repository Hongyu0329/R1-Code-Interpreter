    "To determine the number of times Chekov described Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon,\" I will write a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Fetch the Text**: The script will first download the full text of Anton Chekov's short stories from the Project Gutenberg website.\n2.  **Isolate the Story**: From the full text, it will isolate the specific short story, \"The Chameleon.\"\n3.  **Count Descriptions**: The coat's descriptions are tied to specific actions that symbolize Otchumyelov's shifting mentality. The script will count the occurrences of these key phrases:\n    *   The initial description of him wearing the coat.\n    *   The moment he takes the coat off.\n    *   The moment he puts the coat back on.\n    *   The final action of wrapping the coat around himself.\n4.  **Display the Result**: Finally, the script will print the count for each description, show the total sum as an equation, and state the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef count_coat_descriptions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the number of times Chekov described Otchumyelov's coat\n    in the short story \"The Chameleon\".\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Step 1: Fetch the collection of short stories from Project Gutenberg.\n        # This file contains \"The Chameleon\".\n        url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/13544/13544-0.txt\"\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes (like 404, 500).\n        full_text = response.text\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not fetch the story text from the internet.
