    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Decomposition Principle**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive with conductor $N$ if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\prod_{p^a || N} \\chi_{p^a}$, where each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character with conductor $p^a$ (the prime power factors of $N$). The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_{p^a}$.\n\n2.  **Factorization**: First, we find the prime power factorization of the conductor $N$:\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n3.  **Component Analysis**: We need to find the number of primitive characters for each conductor $p^a$ whose order divides 6. Let's denote this count as $C(p^a)$. The order of the final character will be $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\n4.  **Counting for each factor**:\n    *   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one primitive character of order 2. Since 2 divides 6, we have $C(4) = 1$.\n    *   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The primitive characters are those not induced from modulo 3, which are the ones with orders 3 and 6. Both orders divide 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 2 + 2 = 4$. So, $C(9) = 4$.\n    *   **Conductor 7**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. Their orders are 2, 3, and 6. All these orders divide 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. So, $C(7) = 5$.\n    *   **Conductor 11**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The primitive characters have orders 2, 5, and 10. Only order 2 divides 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) = 1$. So, $C(11) = 1$.\n    *   **Conductor 13**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. The primitive characters have orders 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The orders that divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. So, $C(13) = 5$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation and Verification**: The total number of combinations is the product of the counts for each factor: $C(4) \\times C(9) \\times C(7) \\times C(11) \\times C(13)$.\n    We must verify that the lcm of the orders is exactly 6 for every combination.\n    *   The character for conductor 4 has order 2.\n    *   The character for conductor 9 has order 3 or 6.\n    This guarantees the lcm is divisible by both 2 and 3, and therefore by 6. Since all component orders divide 6, the lcm must also divide 6. Thus, the lcm is always exactly 6.\n\nThe total number is the product of the counts.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factorize(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp = n\n    while p * p <= temp:\n        if temp % p == 0:\n            while temp % p == 0:\n                temp //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        result -= result // temp\n    return int(result)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_character_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    ORDER = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order {ORDER}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: Factorize N\n    print(\"Step 1: Factorize the conductor N.\")\n    factors = prime_factorize(N)\n    factor_str = \" * \".join([f\"{p}^{a}\" if a > 1 else str(p) for p, a in sorted(factors.items())])\n    print(f\"N = {N} = {factor_str}\")\n    print(\"\\nA character chi mod N is primitive with conductor N iff it is a product of primitive\")\n    print(\"characters chi_{p^a} with conductor p^a for each prime power factor p^a of N.\")\n    print(f\"The order of chi must be lcm(orders of components) = {ORDER}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    print(f\"Step 2: For each factor p^a, count primitive characters with order dividing {ORDER}.\")\n    \n    total_count = 1\n    component_counts = {}\n    \n    # Analysis for each prime power factor\n    # Conductor 4 = 2^2\n    p, a = 2, 2\n    pa = p**a\n    print(f\"\\nConductor {pa} ({p}^{a}):\")\n    group_order = phi(pa) if a > 1 else phi(p)\n    print(f\"  Group of characters is C_{group_order}.
