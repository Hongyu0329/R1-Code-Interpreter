# Define constants based on the problem statement.
# T = ln(10^34), which implies e^T = 10^34.
# We can work with these exponential values directly.
exp_T = 10.0**34
exp_2T = 10.0**68

# The solvability condition for the nonlinear problem leads to an equation
# for the radius R of the sphere of allowed initial values (x₀, y₀, z₀).
# This equation is R² = 0.5 * (e²ᵀ + eᵀ).

# The numbers in this final equation are:
factor = 0.5
term_A = exp_2T
term_B = exp_T

# Calculate R squared.
# Note: For very large numbers, term_A + term_B will be dominated by term_A
# in standard floating-point arithmetic, as term_B is much smaller.
R_squared = factor * (term_A + term_B)

# Calculate R by taking the square root.
R = math.sqrt(R_squared)

# As requested, we output each number in the final equation for R.
# The equation is R² = 0.5 * (e²ᵀ + eᵀ).
