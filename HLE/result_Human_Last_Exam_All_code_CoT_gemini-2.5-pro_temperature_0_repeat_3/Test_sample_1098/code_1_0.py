    # The problem describes a system with a one-way door (a Brownian ratchet)
    # that separates two compartments of gas. The goal is to trap all the gas on one side.

    # This process relies on the random movement of gas molecules.
    # Molecules from one side will eventually, by chance, hit the door and pass through.
    # Because the door is one-way, they cannot return.

    # The fundamental driving force for this process is the random thermal motion of the gas molecules.
    # This random motion is a direct consequence of the kinetic energy of the particles.

    # The physical quantity that measures the average kinetic energy of the particles in a gas is Temperature.
    required_parameter = "Temperature"

    # Let's consider why other parameters are not the fundamental requirement:
    # A. Pressure: Pressure is a result of the molecular collisions, which are caused by thermal motion. It's a consequence, not the root cause.
    # C. Chamber Size: The size of the chamber would affect how long the process takes, but the process would still occur.
    # D. Gas Type: Different gases have different molecular masses, but any gas above absolute zero will exhibit thermal motion.
    # E. Door Size: The size of the door affects the rate of transfer, not whether the transfer happens at all.

    # If the temperature were absolute zero (0 Kelvin), the molecules would have no kinetic energy.
    # They would be stationary, and none would ever pass through the door.
    # Therefore, a non-zero temperature is the essential experimental parameter for the apparatus to work.
