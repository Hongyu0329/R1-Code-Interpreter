    "An optimal move in Connect 4 is one that forces a win as quickly as possible, regardless of the opponent's moves. I will analyze the board to find such moves for player 'O'.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Board:** I'll examine the current board to identify any existing threats for player 'O'. A \"threat\" is a line of pieces that could become a winning line of four.\n2.  **Identify Key Threats:** The most significant existing threat for 'O' is a diagonal line of three pieces at `c6`, `d5`, and `e4`. To win with this line, 'O' needs to place a piece at `f3` (column 'f', row 3). However, the spot `f4` is currently empty, so a piece must be played there before `f3` becomes available.\n3.  **Evaluate Candidate Moves:** I will test each possible move for 'O'. The goal is to find a move that creates a new, immediate threat that forces the opponent ('X') to block.\n4.  **The Fork Strategy:** The best move will be one that forces 'X' to make a specific blocking move, which in turn opens up the winning move for our key diagonal threat. This is a classic \"fork\" or \"zugzwang\" situation.\n5.  **Test Move `c4`:** Placing an 'O' at `c4` creates a horizontal line of three (`c4, d4, e4`). This creates an immediate winning threat at `f4`. 'X' must block by playing at `f4`. This action by 'X' makes the `f3` spot available for 'O' on the next turn, allowing 'O' to complete the diagonal and win.\n6.  **Test Move `f4`:** Symmetrically, placing an 'O' at `f4` creates a horizontal threat at `c4`. 'X' must block at `c4`. Meanwhile, 'O's move at `f4` has already made the `f3` spot available for the next turn, again allowing 'O' to win with the diagonal.\n7.  **Conclusion:** Both `c4` and `f4` lead to a forced win for 'O' in two turns. Since no move wins in a single turn, these are the optimal moves.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that programmatically executes this logic to find all such optimal moves.\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\ndef solve_connect4_optimal_moves():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given Connect 4 board to find all optimal moves for player 'O'\n    that lead to a forced win in the minimum number of turns.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Board setup: 0,0 is top-left.
