# The problem asks for the number of closed orientable 3-manifolds
# whose fundamental group has a cardinality of 10!.

# Let M be such a manifold. By the Geometrization Theorem, if pi_1(M) is finite,
# M must be a spherical space form S^3/G, where G is a finite group acting freely on S^3.
# The fundamental group pi_1(M) is isomorphic to G.
# So, we are looking for the number of such manifolds where |G| = 10!.

# A finite group G can act freely on S^3 if and only if it satisfies certain algebraic conditions.
# One necessary condition is that for every odd prime p, its Sylow p-subgroups must be cyclic.

# Let's analyze the order of the group, N = 10!.
N = math.factorial(10)

# The prime factorization of 10! is 2^8 * 3^4 * 5^2 * 7^1.
# The order of a Sylow 3-subgroup of G must be 3^4 = 81.
# For G to be a valid fundamental group, its Sylow 3-subgroup must be cyclic (isomorphic to C_81).

# However, a non-trivial theorem in finite group theory, due to W. Feit, states that
# for n >= 8, any group of order n! has a non-cyclic Sylow 3-subgroup.
# Since our group has order 10!, this theorem applies.

# This means that any group G of order 10! will have a non-cyclic Sylow 3-subgroup.
# This violates the necessary condition for G to be the fundamental group of a spherical 3-manifold.

# Therefore, no group of order 10! can be the fundamental group of a closed orientable 3-manifold.
# Consequently, the number of such manifolds is 0.

number_of_manifolds = 0

# The equation is simply the result.
