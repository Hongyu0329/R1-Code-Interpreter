    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the properties of any function `f` that satisfies the given equation. The function `f` is continuous, and I will show that it must also be injective and therefore strictly monotonic.\n2.  Next, I will consider the two cases for monotonicity: strictly increasing and strictly decreasing.\n3.  I will demonstrate that the case where `f` is strictly decreasing leads to a contradiction. This is because the range of `f(f(x))` would be all of `R`, but the range of `exp(x)` is `(0, +inf)`. Thus, no such decreasing functions exist.\n4.  Then, I will focus on the case where `f` is strictly increasing. I will show that the construction of such a function depends on a continuous choice from an uncountably infinite set.\n5.  Specifically, the construction of an increasing solution `f` depends on choosing:\n    a. A real number `L` from the interval `(-inf, 0)`.\n    b. A continuous, strictly increasing function `h` that maps the interval `[L, 0]` to `[0, exp(L)]`.\n6.  I will argue that the number of choices for both `L` and `h` is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers).\n7.  Finally, I will conclude that the total number of such functions is `c * c = c`. The cardinality of the set is therefore `c`.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that prints this step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the cardinality of the set of\n    continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The equation in question\n    equation_str = \"f(f(x)) = exp(x)\"\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the cardinality of the set S of continuous functions f: R -> R satisfying the equation: {equation_str}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Basic properties of f(x)\")\n    print(\"1. f must be injective: If f(x1) = f(x2), then f(f(x1)) = f(f(x2)), which means exp(x1) = exp(x2).
