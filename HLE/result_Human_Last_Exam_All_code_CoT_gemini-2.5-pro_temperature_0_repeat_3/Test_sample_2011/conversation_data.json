    "Here is my thinking process for solving this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:**\n    *   **Goal:** Find the maximum number of different clique sizes that can be induced subgraphs in a graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n    *   **Output:** A Python script that solves the task and prints the result. The script should show the numbers in the final equation.\n    *   **Constraint:** Only one code block in the response.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Graph Theory Concepts:**\n    *   A **clique** is a set of vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set. A clique of size `k` is denoted `K_k`.\n    *   An **induced subgraph** `G[S]` on a set of vertices `S` contains all vertices from `S` and *only* the edges from the original graph `G` that connect two vertices in `S`.\n    *   The question asks for the maximum size of the set `C = {k | G has an induced subgraph K_k}` for a single graph `G` with 128 vertices.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Core Logic:**\n    *   Let's consider the properties of the set `C` of possible induced clique sizes.\n    *   Suppose the largest induced clique in a graph `G` has size `k_max`. This means there is a set of `k_max` vertices, let's call it `V_max`, such that the induced subgraph `G[V_max]` is a `K_{k_max}`.\n    *   Now, consider any integer `j` where `1 <= j < k_max`. Can we find an induced clique of size `j`?\n    *   Yes. We can simply take any subset of `V_max` with `j` vertices. Let's call this subset `V_j`. Because `V_j` is a subset of `V_max` and all vertices in `V_max` are fully connected, all vertices in `V_j` must also be fully connected.\n    *   Therefore, the induced subgraph `G[V_j]` is a `K_j`.\n    *   This proves a crucial point: if `k_max` is the size of the largest induced clique, then the set of all possible induced clique sizes is `{1, 2, ..., k_max}`.\n    *   The number of different clique sizes is simply `k_max`.\n\n4.  **Reframe the Problem:**\n    *   The problem is now simplified to: \"What is the maximum possible value of `k_max` (the size of the largest induced clique) for a graph with 128 vertices?\"\n    *   The size of a clique in a graph cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph. So, for `n = 128`, `k_max` must be less than or equal to 128.\n\n5.  **Find the Maximum and the Corresponding Graph:**\n    *   The absolute maximum possible value for `k_max` is `n = 128`.\n    *   Can we construct a graph that achieves this maximum? Yes. The complete graph `K_128`, where all 128 vertices are connected to each other.\n    *   In `K_128`, the entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique. Therefore, `k_max = 128`.\n    *   For this graph, the set of induced clique sizes is `{1, 2, ..., 128}`, and the number of different sizes is 128.\n\n6.  **Construct the Python Script:**\n    *   The script doesn't need to perform a complex search or calculation. Its main purpose is to articulate the logical steps that lead to the answer.\n    *   It will define `n = 128`.\n    *   It will explain that the number of clique sizes is determined by the size of the largest clique (`k_max`).\n    *   It will state the simple \"equation\" or constraint: `k_max <= n`.\n    *   It will conclude that the maximum possible value for `k_max` is `n`, which is achieved by the complete graph `K_n`.\n    *   The script will print this reasoning and the final answer. This fulfills the user's request for a script that shows its work.\n\nThis step-by-step process leads directly to the correct answer and the Python code to present it. I considered an alternative interpretation involving disjoint cliques but concluded it was incorrect because it doesn't yield the maximum possible value as requested by the problem.\n\n```python\ndef solve_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    for a graph on n vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph.\n    n = 128\n\n    # Let G be a graph with n vertices.\n    # Let S be the set of all possible sizes of induced cliques in G.\n    # We want to find the maximum possible value of |S|.\n\n    # Key Insight: If a graph G has an induced clique of size k_max,\n    # it must also have induced cliques of all sizes j where 1 <= j < k_max.\n    # This is because any subset of vertices from a clique also induces a clique.\n    # Therefore, the set of induced clique sizes S is always of the form {1, 2, ..., k_max},\n    # where k_max is the size of the largest induced clique in G (the clique number).\n    # The number of different clique sizes is |S| = k_max.\n\n    # The problem is now to find the maximum possible value of k_max for a graph with n vertices.\n    \n    # The size of any clique in a graph cannot be larger than the total number of vertices.\n    # This gives us the fundamental equation/constraint.\n    # k_max <= n\n    \n    # The maximum possible value for k_max is therefore n.\n    # This maximum is achieved by a specific graph: the complete graph K_n,\n    # where all vertices are connected to each other.
