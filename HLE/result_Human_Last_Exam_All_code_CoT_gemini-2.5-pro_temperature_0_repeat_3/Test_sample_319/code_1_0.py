def solve_special_points_exponent():
    """
    This function calculates the largest possible value of c.

    The problem asks for the largest possible value of c, where the number of special points
    in R^D from N k-dimensional planes is O(N^c).

    1.  A point is "special" if the direction vectors of all planes passing through it span the entire space.
        - The dimension of the ambient space is D = 10.
        - A plane is a k-dimensional subspace, where k = 2.

    2.  To span the D-dimensional space, we need at least D linearly independent vectors.
        - Each plane provides k direction vectors.
        - Therefore, a special point must be the intersection of at least m = ceil(D / k) planes.

    3.  Let's calculate this minimum number of planes, m.
        - D = 10
        - k = 2
        - m = 10 / 2 = 5

    4.  A special point is formed by the intersection of at least 5 planes. The maximum number of
        such intersection points is bounded by the number of ways to choose 5 planes from N.
        - This is given by the binomial coefficient "N choose 5", which is O(N^5).

    5.  It is also possible to construct a configuration of N planes that generates Omega(N^5)
        special points.

    6.  Since the number of special points is both upper-bounded by O(N^5) and can be as large as
        Omega(N^5), the tightest bound for the exponent is 5.
