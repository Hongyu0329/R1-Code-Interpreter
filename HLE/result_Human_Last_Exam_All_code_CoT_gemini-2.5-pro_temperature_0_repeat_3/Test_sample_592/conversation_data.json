    "Of course. Here is a Python script that will print the answer to your question.\n\nMy plan is to first find the correct US city from the movie's plot. Then, I will create a simple Python script that stores this city name in a variable and prints it out in a descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\n# This script provides the answer to the user's question about the movie Ovosodo.\n\n# The character Tommaso, Piero's best friend, moves to the United States.\n# The specific city he moves to is New York.\ncity = \"New York\"\n\nprint(f\"In the 1997 movie Ovosodo, Tommaso moves to the US city of {city}.\")\n```\n<<<New York>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
