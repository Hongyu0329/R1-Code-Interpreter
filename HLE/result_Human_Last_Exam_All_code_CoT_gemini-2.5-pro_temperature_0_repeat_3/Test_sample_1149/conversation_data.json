    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the answer and present it in a Python script.\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*.\n2.  **Information Retrieval:** This is a specific paleontological fact. I will access my knowledge base, which is trained on scientific literature, to find the description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull. The primary source for this information is the 2002 paper by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott, which describes the holotype specimen.\n3.  **Locate the Specific Detail:** Within the description of the skull, I will focus on the lacrimal bone and the feature known as the lacrimal recess. The scientific text describes this recess as containing a specific number of depressions.\n4.  **Code Formulation:** I will create a Python script that stores this number in a variable. The script will then print a clear, human-readable sentence stating the fact and the number. This fulfills the request to use code to provide the answer.\n\n```python\n# The scientific description of the Irritator challengeri skull (holotype SMNS 58022)\n# notes specific features of the lacrimal bone.\n\n# The number of depressions found within the lacrimal recess.\n# This information is based on the paper: Sues, H.-D., Frey, E., Martill, D. M., & Scott, D. M. (2002).\n# \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\"\n# Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 22(3), 535-547.\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# Print the final answer in a descriptive sentence.\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} depressions.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
