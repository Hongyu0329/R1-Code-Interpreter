    "This is a complex line of Latin hexameter from Lucretius that requires understanding several poetic licenses to scan correctly. Here is a step-by-step plan for the scansion:\n\n1.  **Identify Elisions**: Standard elisions occur when a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or \"h-\". In this line, we have `ver(um) ubi`, `ub(i) equi`, and `atqu(e) hominis`.\n2.  **Address Problematic Feet**: The sequence `atque hominis` creates a metrically impossible anapest (`U U —`). This is resolved by a poetic license called **syncope**, where `hominis` is shortened to `homnis`. This creates a spondee (`— —`).\n3.  **Resolve the Ending**: The ending `convenit imago` (`— U U U — —`) does not fit the required dactyl-spondee pattern (`— U U | — —`). This is a famous example of **tmesis**, where the word `convenit` is split. The line should be read as `...casu con, venit imago`. Furthermore, the verb is the perfect tense `vēnit` (`— U`), not the present `vĕnit` (`U U`).\n4.  **Combine Licenses**: By applying these licenses, we can break the line down into six valid metrical feet.\n5.  **Construct the Final Scansion**: The resulting pattern is Dactyl-Spondee-Spondee-Spondee-Dactyl-Spondee.\n\nThe Python code below will print out the line divided into its constituent feet, along with the final scansion pattern.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    This specific line from Lucretius is known for its complexity, requiring several poetic licenses.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    \n    # The feet are determined by a complex analysis involving:\n    # 1.
