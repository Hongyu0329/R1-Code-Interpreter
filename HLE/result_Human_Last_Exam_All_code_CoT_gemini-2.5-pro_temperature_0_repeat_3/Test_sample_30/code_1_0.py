    This function analyzes statements about interactive proof systems and identifies the correct one.

    The analysis of each option is as follows:
    A: Incorrect. Describes non-interactive proofs.
    B: Incorrect. The GNI proof is a canonical example.
    C: Incorrect. Entanglement is a powerful verification tool (MIP* = RE).
    D: Correct. This accurately describes the computational power asymmetry between the
       polynomial-time verifier and the computationally powerful prover.
    E: Incorrect. The statement about amplification is false.
    F: Incorrect. Two provers are more powerful than one (MIP = NEXP > IP = PSPACE).
    G: Incorrect. Interactive proofs can solve problems much harder than NP (IP = PSPACE).
    H: Incorrect. The standard alphabet is binary, not trinary.
    I: Incorrect. The soundness condition for NP is defined incorrectly.
    J: Incorrect. Describes a specific, non-general construction.

    The function will print the letter corresponding to the correct statement.
