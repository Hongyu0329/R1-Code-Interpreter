    # Analysis of the options based on medical knowledge
    # Magnesium acts as a physiological calcium channel blocker.
    # By blocking calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells, it causes the blood vessels to relax and widen (vasodilation).
    # This widening reduces peripheral resistance, which in turn lowers blood pressure.
    # Therefore, direct vasodilation is the correct mechanism.
