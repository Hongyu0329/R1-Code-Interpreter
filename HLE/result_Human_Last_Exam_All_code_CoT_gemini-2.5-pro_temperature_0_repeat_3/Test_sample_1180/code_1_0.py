# For the elliptic curve Y^2 = 2*x^3 + 1, which is of the form Y^2 = a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d
# The coefficients are a=2, b=0, c=0, d=1.
# This is not a standard Weierstrass form.
# We can transform it to y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B form, but it's easier to use the general discriminant formula for a cubic.
# For f(x) = a*x^3 + b*x^2 + c*x + d, the discriminant is
# Disc(f) = b^2*c^2 - 4*a*c^3 - 4*b^3*d - 27*a^2*d^2 + 18*a*b*c*d

# The discriminant of the curve y^2 = f(x) is related to the discriminant of the polynomial f(x).
# For y^2 = ax^3+d, the discriminant is -27*a*d^2 * (-16a) = 432 a^2 d^2? No.
# Let's use the standard formula for the discriminant of the curve y^2+a1*xy+a3*y = x^3+a2*x^2+a4*x+a6
# Our curve Y^2 = 2x^3 + 1 is not in this form.
# Let's use the discriminant for the general hyperelliptic curve y^2=f(x)
# Delta = 2^(4g) * Disc(f(x)) for g=1, so Delta = 16 * Disc(f(x))
# Delta = 16 * (-108) = -1728.
# This is not the minimal discriminant.

# Let's use the discriminant of the minimal model Y_1^2 = X^3 + 432, from y^2=2x^3+1 via x=X/6, y=Y/108
# No, let's use the standard invariants for Y^2 = 2x^3 + 1.
# This is birationally equivalent to y'^2 = x'^3 - 432.
# Let's use the form y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B.
# A = 0, B = 4. Discriminant = -16 * (4*A^3 + 27*B^2) = -16 * (27 * 4^2) = -16 * 27 * 16 = -6912.
# v2(-6912) = v2(-2^8 * 27) = 8. This is type I_2*.

# Let's stick to the model Y^2 = 2x^3+1 and its discriminant Delta = -16(4*a^3+27*b^2) for y^2=x^3+ax+b
# This formula is not applicable.
# Let's use the definition from Silverman, The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves, page 42.
# For y^2 = f(x), with f of degree 3.
# f(x) = 2x^3+1.
# b2 = 0, b4 = 0, b6 = 4*1 = 4.
# Delta = -b2^2 * b8 - 8 * b4^3 - 27 * b6^2 + 9 * b2 * b4 * b6
# b8 = a1^2*a6 + ... = 0.
# Delta = -27 * b6^2 = -27 * 4^2 = -27 * 16 = -432.
# v2(-432) = v2(-16 * 27) = 4.

# The discriminant of the elliptic curve Y^2 = 2x^3 + 1
# We can put it in Weierstrass form y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B.
# Let x_new = 2^(1/3) * x. Then Y^2 = x_new^3 + 1.
# This is not over Q.
# Let's use the general form y^2+a1xy+a3y = x^3+a2x^2+a4x+a6
# Our curve is Y^2 = 2x^3+1. This is not in this form.
# Let's use the definition for y^2=f(x).
# The discriminant is -432.

# disc_poly = -27 * 4 = -108

# The discriminant of the curve model is not the same as the polynomial.
# Let's use the formula for the general Weierstrass equation.
# y^2 + a1 xy + a3 y = x^3 + a2 x^2 + a4 x + a6
# We can transform Y^2 = 2x^3+1 into this form.
# Let x = u^2 x' + r, Y = u^3 y' + ...
# Let x = X/4, Y = Y'/8. (Y'/8)^2 = 2(X/4)^3+1 => Y'^2/64 = 2X^3/64+1 => Y'^2 = 2X^3+64.
# Let x = X, Y = sqrt(2) Y'. Not good.
# Let's trust the calculation v2(Delta_min) = 4.
# This corresponds to reduction type I_4.
