    # Step 1: Analyze the effect on proton energy.
    print("\nStep 1: Effect on Proton Energy")
    print("A standard laser focuses its energy to a small, intense spot. This high intensity is crucial for creating the strong electric field that accelerates protons to high energies.")
    print("A laser with OAM has an annular (doughnut-shaped) intensity profile. This means its energy is spread out over a larger ring, resulting in a lower peak intensity compared to a standard beam of the same power.")
    print("Lower laser intensity creates a weaker accelerating electric field. Therefore, the maximum energy of the resulting protons decreases.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the effect on the proton beam's shape.
    print("\nStep 2: Effect on Proton Beam Shape (Collimation vs. Dispersion)")
    print("OAM is a form of angular momentum. During the laser-target interaction, this angular momentum is transferred from the photons to the plasma particles (electrons and then protons).")
    print("This transfer imparts a rotational or 'sideways' velocity component to the protons, in addition to their forward velocity.")
    print("This rotational motion causes the protons to fly outwards in a helical or spiral pattern, spreading the beam out.")
    print("This spreading effect is known as dispersion, which is the opposite of collimation (focusing).")

    # Step 3: Combine the findings and select the answer.
    print("\nStep 3: Conclusion")
    print("Combining the two effects:")
    print("1. The proton beam spreads out, which is Dispersion.")
    print("2. The maximum proton energy Decreases.")
    print("\nThis directly corresponds to the answer choice: Dispersion and Proton Energy Decreases.")
