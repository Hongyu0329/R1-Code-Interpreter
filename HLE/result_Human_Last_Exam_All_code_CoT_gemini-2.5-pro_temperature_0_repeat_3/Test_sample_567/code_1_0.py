# This script calculates the value of 'a' where the volume constraint becomes the only
# obstruction for the symplectic embedding of the ellipsoid E(1,a) into a ball.
# This value is known to be the fourth power of the golden ratio.

# 1. Define the numbers used to calculate the golden ratio, phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2
one = 1
five = 5
two = 2

# 2. Calculate the golden ratio
phi = (one + math.sqrt(five)) / two

# 3. The value of 'a' is phi raised to the power of 4
exponent = 4
a_value = phi ** exponent

# 4. The exact form of a = phi^4 can be simplified to (7 + 3*sqrt(5)) / 2
seven = 7
three = 3

# 5. Print the explanation and the results, showing each number in the equations.
