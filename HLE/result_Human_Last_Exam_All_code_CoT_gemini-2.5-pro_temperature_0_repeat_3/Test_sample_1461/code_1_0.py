# Step 1: Define the number of atoms in the covalent backbone path for each monomer.
# This is the path from the first backbone atom (N) to the last (C').
# For Alanine (N-Ca-C'): 3 atoms, 2 bonds.
# For epsilon-Amino Acid (N-Ca-Cb-Cg-Cd-Ce-C'): 8 atoms, 7 bonds.
# We are interested in the atoms that form the covalent part of the H-bond ring.

# Step 2: Identify the atoms in the covalent path of the H-bond ring.
# The H-bond is from C=O of Ala(i) to N-H of Ala(i+1).
# The intervening monomer is the epsilon-amino acid (eAA).
# The covalent path is: C'(Ala_i) -> N(eAA) -> ... -> C'(eAA) -> N(Ala_{i+1})
# The number of atoms in the eAA backbone from N to C' is 8.
# The number of atoms in the covalent path of the ring is the number of atoms
# in the eAA backbone (8) plus the C' of the first Ala. Wait, that's not right.
# Let's count them directly:
# 1. C' of the first Alanine
# 2. N of the epsilon-AA
# 3. C-alpha of the epsilon-AA
# 4. C-beta of the epsilon-AA
# 5. C-gamma of the epsilon-AA
# 6. C-delta of the epsilon-AA
# 7. C-epsilon of the epsilon-AA
# 8. C' of the epsilon-AA
# 9. N of the second Alanine
covalent_path_atoms = 9

# Step 3: Calculate the total ring size.
# The ring includes the 9 atoms in the covalent path plus the
# carbonyl Oxygen (O) and the amide Hydrogen (H) forming the H-bond.
h_bond_atoms = 2
total_ring_size = covalent_path_atoms + h_bond_atoms

# Step 4: Print the final equation and conclusion.
print("The most likely helical pattern is determined by the size of the hydrogen-bonded ring.")
print("The ring is formed by an H-bond between two alanine residues, bridged by one epsilon-amino acid.")
print("The calculation for the ring size is:")
print(f"{covalent_path_atoms} (atoms in covalent path) + {h_bond_atoms} (O and H from H-bond) = {total_ring_size}")
print(f"This corresponds to an 11-helix. Based on known foldamer motifs, the 11/9-helix is the most likely pattern.")
