    # --- Analysis of X1 ---
    # X1 is the Hilbert scheme of subschemes of degree 11 in A^3, denoted Hilb^11(A^3).
    # - Type: It is a scheme (S).
    # - Separatedness: Schemes are separated (s).
    # - Universally closed: It is not universally closed (not proper) as points can be moved to infinity.
    # - Irreducibility: Hilb^d(A^n) is reducible for n>=3 and d>=4. So it's not irreducible.
    # - Dimension: The dimension is the dimension of the largest irreducible component.
    #   The component of d distinct points has dimension n*d.
    n1 = 3
    d1 = 11
    dim1 = n1 * d1
    # The "equation" for the dimension is dim1 = n1 * d1
    x1_props = f"[S,s,{dim1}]"

    # --- Analysis of X2 ---
    # X2 is the quotient stack [ (A^4 \ V(xy-zw)) / C* ] with weights (1,4,2,3).
    # - Type: The action of C* is free, as any point must have either x!=0 or w!=0,
    #   and the weights are 1 and 3 respectively, so the stabilizer is trivial.
    #   A quotient by a free action is an algebraic space, which is a Deligne-Mumford stack (DM).
    # - Separatedness: The quotient of a separated scheme by a reductive group is separated (s).
    # - Universally closed: The space A^4 \ V(xy-zw) is not proper, so the quotient is not universally closed.
    # - Irreducibility: A^4 \ V(xy-zw) is an open subset of an irreducible variety, so it's irreducible.
    #   The quotient by a connected group (C*) is irreducible (irr).
    # - Dimension: The dimension of the quotient stack is dim(total space) - dim(group).
    dim_A4 = 4
    dim_C_star = 1
    dim2 = dim_A4 - dim_C_star
    # The "equation" for the dimension is dim2 = dim_A4 - dim_C_star
    x2_props = f"[DM,s,irr,{dim2}]"

    # --- Analysis of X3 ---
    # X3 is the Picard stack of a genus 7 curve C0.
    # - Type: The objects are line bundles, and the automorphism group of any line bundle is G_m (C*).
    #   Since the stabilizer group is not finite, it is an Algebraic stack (A).
    # - Separatedness: The Picard stack is separated (s).
    # - Universally closed: The stack consists of connected components which are Gm-gerbes over
    #   projective varieties (Pic^d(C0)). These components are proper, hence universally closed (uc).
    # - Irreducibility: The stack has infinitely many connected components (indexed by degree),
    #   so it is not irreducible.
    # - Dimension: The dimension is dim(coarse moduli space) + dim(stabilizer).
    #   The coarse moduli space is Pic^d(C0), which has dimension g.
    g3 = 7
    dim_stabilizer_Gm = 1
    dim3 = g3 + dim_stabilizer_Gm
