    "Based on the user's request, I will first address the implicit coding task by creating a relevant problem and then provide the answer to the scientific question.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  The user has provided instructions for a coding task but has not specified the task itself. The prompt contains a scientific question about Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).\n2.  I will create a coding task related to the physics of SPDC. The fundamental principle of SPDC is the conservation of energy, which relates the wavelengths of the photons involved.\n3.  The energy conservation equation is `1/λ_p = 1/λ_s + 1/λ_i`, where `λ_p` is the pump photon's wavelength, and `λ_s` and `λ_i` are the signal and idler photons' wavelengths, respectively.\n4.  I will write a Python script that takes a given pump wavelength (e.g., from a common 532 nm green laser) and a signal wavelength (e.g., 800 nm) and calculates the corresponding idler wavelength.\n5.  As requested, the script will output the final, complete equation, showing all the numerical values.\n\n```python\n# Plan: Calculate the idler wavelength in a Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) process.\n# The calculation is based on the law of energy conservation.\n\n# 1. Define the known wavelengths in nanometers (nm).\n# We'll use a common green laser pump and a near-infrared signal wavelength.\npump_wavelength = 532.0\nsignal_wavelength = 800.0\n\n# 2. State the physical principle.\n# The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength (E = hc/λ).\n# Energy conservation in SPDC means: E_pump = E_signal + E_idler\n# This translates to the wavelength equation: 1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler.\n\n# 3. Rearrange the equation to solve for the unknown idler wavelength.\n# 1/λ_idler = 1/λ_pump - 1/λ_signal\n\n# 4. Perform the calculation.\n# Calculate the reciprocal of the idler wavelength first.\nreciprocal_idler_wavelength = (1 / pump_wavelength) - (1 / signal_wavelength)\n\n# Now, calculate the idler wavelength by taking the inverse.\nidler_wavelength = 1 / reciprocal_idler_wavelength\n\n# 5. Print the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.\nprint(\"The energy conservation equation for this SPDC process is:\")\n# The f-string below substitutes the variable values into the string.\n# The idler wavelength is formatted to one decimal place for clarity.\nprint(f\"1 / {pump_wavelength} = 1 / {signal_wavelength} + 1 / {idler_wavelength:.1f}\")\n\n# 6. Print the result separately for the user.\nprint(f\"\\nGiven a pump wavelength of {pump_wavelength} nm and a signal wavelength of {signal_wavelength} nm, the calculated idler wavelength is {idler_wavelength:.1f} nm.\")\n\n```\n<<<No. Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process, which requires a material to lack inversion symmetry. The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the β12 and χ3 phases, possess a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., they are centrosymmetric). Due to this symmetry, the second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero, forbidding processes like SPDC in the bulk material. While a weak signal might theoretically arise from symmetry breaking at edges, defects, or due to applied strain, the ideal, free-standing nanosheets themselves would not be expected to exhibit SPDC.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    When excited by incident light, would free-standing boron nanosheets be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
