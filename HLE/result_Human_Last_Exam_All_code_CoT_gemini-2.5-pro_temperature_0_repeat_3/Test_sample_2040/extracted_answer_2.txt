No. Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process, which requires a material to lack inversion symmetry. The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the β12 and χ3 phases, possess a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., they are centrosymmetric). Due to this symmetry, the second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero, forbidding processes like SPDC in the bulk material. While a weak signal might theoretically arise from symmetry breaking at edges, defects, or due to applied strain, the ideal, free-standing nanosheets themselves would not be expected to exhibit SPDC.
