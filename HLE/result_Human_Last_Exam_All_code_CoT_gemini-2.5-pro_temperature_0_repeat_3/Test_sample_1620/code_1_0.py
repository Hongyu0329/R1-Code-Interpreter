    # The core principle is lawyer-client confidentiality. However, this duty is not absolute.
    # The Law Society of Ontario's Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rule 3.3-3,
    # outlines the "public safety exception".

    # This exception allows a lawyer to disclose confidential information if:
    # 1. The lawyer has a reasonable belief...
    # 2. ...that there is an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm...
    # 3. ...and disclosure is necessary to prevent the death or harm.
    # The disclosure must be limited to the information required to prevent the harm.

    # Let's analyze the facts against these criteria:
    # - Threat of Death or Serious Bodily Harm: Eric stated he bought a gun to "end things for both of us." This is a clear threat of murder-suicide.
    # - Imminent Risk: Eric stated he would act "tonight." This makes the risk imminent.
    # - Reasonable Belief: Given Eric's recent behavior and the specificity of his statement, James's belief that the threat is real is reasonable.
    # - Necessary Disclosure: Contacting the police is the appropriate and necessary step to prevent such a violent act.
    # - Scope of Disclosure: James disclosed the identities and addresses of Eric and his ex-wife, as well as other potential locations. This information is directly relevant and necessary for the police to locate the individuals and intervene effectively. It is not overly broad.

    # Now, let's evaluate the options:
    # A: Incorrect. The threat is for "tonight," which is the definition of imminent.
    # B: Incorrect. The public safety exception explicitly exists, so confidentiality is not absolute.
    # C: Incorrect. The information disclosed was directly related to helping the police prevent the harm. It was not inappropriate in scope given the life-or-death circumstances.
    # D: Incorrect. The rule is that a lawyer *may* disclose, not that they *must*. The duty to disclose is not triggered by a police request but by the imminent threat itself.
    # E: Correct. This option accurately reflects the public safety exception. James had a reasonable belief of an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm, and his disclosure to the police was a necessary measure to prevent it.

    print("The lawyer, James, acted in accordance with his professional obligations.")
    print("The correct choice is E.")
    print("Explanation: James reasonably believed that there was an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm to his client and his client's ex-wife. Under the public safety exception to the duty of confidentiality, a lawyer is permitted to disclose the necessary information to prevent such harm. James's disclosure to the police was therefore justified.")
