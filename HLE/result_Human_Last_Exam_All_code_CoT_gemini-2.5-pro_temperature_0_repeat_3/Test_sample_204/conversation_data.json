    "To determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field, I will use a method based on its topological structure. The Whitehead formula for the Hopf charge can be geometrically interpreted as the linking number of the pre-images of two regular values on the sphere SÂ². For a field with the given toroidal symmetry, this calculation simplifies to the product of two integer winding numbers:\n\n1.  **Azimuthal Winding Number (`n_f`):** This number describes how many times the vector field wraps around the z-axis in the xy-plane. It is determined by the azimuthal angle `f`.\n2.  **Poloidal Winding Number (`n_G`):** This number describes how many times the vector field wraps in the poloidal direction (a plane containing the z-axis). It is determined by the polar angle `G`.\n\nThe total Hopf charge `Q_H` is the product of these two numbers: `Q_H = n_f * n_G`.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that:\n1.  Determines `n_f` by inspecting the definition of the angle `f`.\n2.  Determines `n_G` by analyzing the behavior of the function `G` along a radial path from the center to infinity.\n3.  Calculates the final Hopf charge `Q_H` and prints the full equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge for the given vector field by determining\n    the azimuthal and poloidal winding numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Hopf charge Q_H for a field with this structure is the product of\n    # two winding numbers: Q_H = n_f * n_G.\n\n    # 1.
