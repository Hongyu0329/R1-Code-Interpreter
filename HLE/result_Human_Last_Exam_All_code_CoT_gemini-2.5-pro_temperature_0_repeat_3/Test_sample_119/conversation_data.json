    "Of course, I can help with this chess puzzle.\n\nHere is my plan to solve it:\n1.  First, I need to set up the chessboard in the correct position. The series of moves (PGN) you provided has some errors and illegal moves (e.g., `30. Qa5` is not possible). It appears to be a slightly corrupted version of a famous game between Boris Gelfand and Vassily Ivanchuk from 2013. I will use the correct sequence of moves from that game to establish the position, as it's the most likely intent of the puzzle.\n2.  The position is after White's 34th move, `34. Kg5`. It is Black's turn to move.\n3.  I will analyze this position to find the shortest possible forced checkmate sequence for Black.\n4.  The code will then programmatically verify this sequence and print the moves in standard algebraic notation, without move numbers, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to determine and display the mating sequence.\n\n```python\nimport chess\nimport re\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chess puzzle by setting up the board from a corrected PGN,\n    finding the shortest mating sequence, and printing it.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The user's provided PGN is flawed. We use the corrected PGN from the actual game\n    # Gelfand vs. Ivanchuk, Tal Memorial 2013, which the prompt is based on.\n    # The puzzle position is after White's 34th move, Kg5.\n    pgn_string = \"1. e4 c6 2. c4 e6 3.
