# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
# A map of countries can be represented as a planar graph. The Four-Color Theorem states that any planar graph has a chromatic number of at most 4.
# To find the minimum number of colors, we search for the largest clique (a set of mutually adjacent nodes).
# Before 1991, a clique of size 4 (K4) existed, formed by the mutual borders of China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.
# The existence of a K4 clique requires a minimum of 4 colors.
# Therefore, the chromatic number before the dissolution was exactly 4.
chromatic_number_before = 4
print(f"Chromatic number before dissolution = {chromatic_number_before}")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
# After 1991, the Soviet Union was replaced by several new sovereign states in Asia (e.g., Kazakhstan, Russia, etc.).
# This event did not remove any of the countries or borders that formed the original K4 clique {China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India}.
# The new map is also a planar graph, so its chromatic number is still at most 4.
# Since the K4 clique still exists, the chromatic number must be at least 4.
# Therefore, the chromatic number after the dissolution remained 4.
chromatic_number_after = 4
print(f"Chromatic number after dissolution = {chromatic_number_after}")

# Step 3: Calculate delta_soviet, the incremental change in the chromatic number.
# delta_soviet is the difference between the 'after' and 'before' chromatic numbers.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"delta_soviet = {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}")

# Step 4: Determine beta by analyzing the change in planarity.
# A graph of countries on a map is, by definition, a planar graph.
# The dissolution of the Soviet Union was an act of subdividing a region on the map.
# Subdividing a region of a planar graph results in another planar graph.
# Therefore, the planarity of the Asian country graph did not change.
# As per the problem, if planarity does not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1
print(f"Planarity did not change, so beta = {beta}")

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
# The final result is the product of beta and delta_soviet.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"Final Answer: {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}")
