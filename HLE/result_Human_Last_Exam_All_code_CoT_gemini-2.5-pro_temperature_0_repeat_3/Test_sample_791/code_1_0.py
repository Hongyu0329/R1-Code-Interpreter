    """
    Analyzes the provided grammar and parser question to determine the correct statement.

    The grammar is:
    L = S V C '.' EOF
    S = N | ADJ N | N ADJ
    N = 'frogs' | 'snakes'
    V = 'jump' | 'swim'
    ADJ = 'red' | 'or alike' | REC
    REC = REC ADJ
    C = 'well' | 'swiftly'

    The key issue is the left recursion in 'REC = REC ADJ', which causes infinite loops
    in standard Recursive Descent (RD) and Packrat (PR) parsers.

    Let's analyze the options:

    A. The language contains "red frogs swim swiftly.", and it is not the longest sentence in the language.
       - Derivation of "red frogs swim swiftly.":
         - L -> S V C .
         - S -> ADJ N -> 'red' 'frogs'
         - V -> 'swim'
         - C -> 'swiftly'
         - The sentence is valid according to the grammar.
       - Longest sentence: The rule 'REC = REC ADJ' allows for an infinite sequence of adjectives.
         Therefore, the language is infinite and has no longest sentence.
       - Parser behavior: A top-down parser (RD or PR) can parse this sentence.
         When parsing S, it can choose the 'ADJ N' alternative. For ADJ, it can match 'red'
         without ever needing to expand the left-recursive 'REC' rule.
       - Conclusion: This statement is correct.

    B. RD accepts "snake big jump well." but PR does not.
       - The word "big" is not in the grammar's vocabulary. The sentence is not in the language.
       - Neither parser would accept it.
       - Conclusion: This statement is false.

    C. Both RD and PR accept "jump or alike frog swiftly." and do not run infinitely.
       - A valid sentence must start with a Subject (S). "jump" is a Verb (V).
       - The sentence does not follow the required 'S V C .' structure. It is not in the language.
       - Neither parser would accept it.
       - Conclusion: This statement is false.

    D. Neither RD nor PR can be implemented because the grammar contains left recursion.
       - This is false. The parsers can be implemented. They will simply fail (e.g., infinite loop)
         on inputs that require the left-recursive rule. As shown in the analysis of A, they can
         successfully parse sentences that do not use the 'REC' rule.
       - Conclusion: This statement is false.

    E. None of the above are correct.
       - Since statement A is correct, this is false.

    Final Answer is A.
