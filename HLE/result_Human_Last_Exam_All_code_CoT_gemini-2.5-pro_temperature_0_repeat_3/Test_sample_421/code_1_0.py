# Step 1: Define the number of vertices and edges in the essential graph of the space.
# The space consists of a circle and a line segment intersecting twice.
# The two intersection points are the key junctions, which we model as vertices.
num_vertices = 2

# The paths between these two vertices are the edges:
# 1. The part of the line segment between the intersection points.
# 2. The first arc of the circle between the intersection points.
# 3. The second arc of the circle between the intersection points.
num_edges = 3

# Step 2: Calculate the number of fundamental paths (the rank of the fundamental group).
# The formula for a connected graph is k = E - V + 1.
# This number represents the number of independent loops, which characterizes the
# different types of paths in the space.
num_fundamental_paths = num_edges - num_vertices + 1

# Step 3: Print the explanation and the result.
# The final code should output each number in the final equation.
print("To find the number of fundamental distinct paths, we model the space as a graph.")
print(f"The number of vertices (intersection points) is V = {num_vertices}.")
print(f"The number of edges (paths between vertices) is E = {num_edges}.")
print("The number of fundamental paths is calculated using the formula: k = E - V + 1.")
print(f"So, k = {num_edges} - {num_vertices} + 1 = {num_fundamental_paths}.")
