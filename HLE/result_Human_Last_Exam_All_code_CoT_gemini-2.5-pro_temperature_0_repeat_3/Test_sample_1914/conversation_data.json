    "To determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the basic components.** A category with 2 objects, let's call them A and B, must have an identity morphism for each, `id_A` and `id_B`. This accounts for 2 of the 4 total morphisms. Let the remaining two non-identity morphisms be `f` and `g`.\n\n2.  **Classify the structures based on morphism distribution.** The two non-identity morphisms `f` and `g` can be distributed among the four possible hom-sets: `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)`. I will enumerate all possible distributions.\n\n3.  **Group distributions by isomorphism.** Some distributions are isomorphic to others simply by swapping the labels of the objects A and B. I will group these together to avoid overcounting.\n\n4.  **Analyze each group.** For each unique type of distribution, I will determine the number of non-isomorphic ways to define the composition law, ensuring it is associative and respects the identity laws. This involves analyzing the constraints on composition and, in some cases, counting the number of small algebraic structures (monoids).\n\n5.  **Sum the results.** The total number of categories will be the sum of the counts from each distinct group of distributions.\n\nThis systematic approach ensures all possibilities are considered and none are counted more than once. The final calculation will be presented in a Python script that details each step of the summation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n    The logic is based on classifying categories by the distribution of their\n    non-identity morphisms and then analyzing the possible composition laws for each class.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A category with 2 objects (A, B) and 4 morphisms must include two identity\n    # morphisms, id_A and id_B.
