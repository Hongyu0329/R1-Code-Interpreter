    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The problem concerns the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$.\n2.  **Recall the Key Theorem:** A crucial theorem in group theory states that the number of distinct power subgroups in a finite group $G$ is equal to the number of divisors of the group's exponent. The exponent of a group is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of all its elements.\n3.  **Determine the Exponent of Q_128:**\n    *   The group $Q_{128}$ is defined by the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    *   Its elements are of the form $x^i$ (with orders dividing 64) and $x^i y$ (with order 4).\n    *   The maximum order of any element is 64. Since all other element orders (which are powers of 2 up to 4) divide 64, the exponent of $Q_{128}$ is 64.\n4.  **Count the Divisors of the Exponent:** The final step is to find the number of divisors of 64.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will provide a Python script that calculates the number of divisors of 64, clearly showing the mathematical steps involved in the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary of {prime: exponent}.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The exponent of the generalized quaternion group Q_128 is 64.\n    # The number of power subgroups is the number of divisors of the exponent.\n    exponent = 64\n\n    print(f\"The exponent of the generalized quaternion group of size 128 is {exponent}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of power subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of {exponent}.\")\n    \n    # Find the prime factorization of the exponent\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(exponent)\n    \n    # Build the explanation strings\n    factor_str_parts = []\n    for prime, power in factors.items():\n        factor_str_parts.append(f\"{prime}^{power}\")\n    factor_str = \" * \".join(factor_str_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTo find the number of divisors, we first get the prime factorization of {exponent}:\")\n    print(f\"{exponent} = {factor_str}\")\n\n    # Use the formula for the number of divisors: (e1+1)*(e2+1)*...\n    num_divisors = 1\n    formula_parts = []\n    result_parts = []\n    for prime, power in factors.items():\n        num_divisors *= (power + 1)\n        formula_parts.append(f\"({power} + 1)\")\n        result_parts.append(str(power + 1))\n\n    formula_str = \" * \".join(formula_parts)\n    result_str = \" * \".join(result_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe number of divisors is calculated from the exponents in the factorization:\")\n    if len(result_parts) > 1:\n        print(f\"Number of divisors = {formula_str} = {result_str} = {num_divisors}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Number of divisors = {formula_str} = {num_divisors}\")\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
