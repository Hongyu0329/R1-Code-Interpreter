    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this poker theory question using a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to identify the weakest \"suited Jack\" hand (a Jack and another card of the same suit, abbreviated as JXs) that should still be played as an opening raise from the button position in a standard poker game (100 big blinds deep, no rake).\n2.  **Consult Poker Strategy (GTO):** This question is about Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker strategy. In this specific scenario (button position), the strategy is to play a very wide and aggressive range of hands because you are guaranteed to have a positional advantage after the flop.\n3.  **Analyze the Suited Jack Range:** The hands in question are JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s. As the second card (the \"kicker\") gets lower, the hand's value decreases. A hand like J2s has much less potential than J9s.\n4.  **Determine the Cutoff:** According to standard GTO charts, the button's positional advantage is so great that *all* suited Jacks, from JTs down to J2s, are considered profitable hands to open-raise.\n5.  **Identify the \"Worst\" Hand:** Since all suited Jacks are opened, the \"worst\" one is the one with the lowest expected value. This corresponds to the hand with the lowest kicker.\n6.  **Develop a Python Script:** To demonstrate this, I will write a script that:\n    a.  Represents a simplified GTO opening chart.\n    b.  Filters this chart to find all the suited Jack hands that are recommended to be opened.\n    c.  Defines the value of each card to rank the hands.\n    d.  Programmatically finds and prints the hand with the lowest-ranked kicker from the list of playable suited Jacks.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_opening_hand():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker opening range to find the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing a standard 100BB GTO chart for the button position...\")\n    print(\"The goal is to find the worst suited jack (JXs) that is a standard open-raise.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define a simplified GTO opening range for the button.\n    # 1.0 means the hand is always opened.
