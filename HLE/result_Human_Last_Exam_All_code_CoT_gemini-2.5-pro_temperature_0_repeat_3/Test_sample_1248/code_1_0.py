  """
  This function provides the solution to the Hopf algebra problem based on the step-by-step derivation.
  """
  # Based on the derivation:
  # (a) The premise g . 1_R = 0 implies g^2 . 1_R = 0.
  # The condition g^2 . 1_R = 1_R leads to 0 = 1_R, making the implication vacuously true.
  answer_a = "Yes"

  # (b) The formula simplifies to x^j a . r = w^j(a . r).
  # For j=2 and r=1_R, this gives w^2(a . 1_R).
  # Let's represent w^2(a . 1_R) as a string.
  answer_b = "w^2(a . 1_R)"

  # (c) For j=3 and r=1_R, the simplified formula gives w^3(a . 1_R).
  answer_c = "w^3(a . 1_R)"

  # The final answer is formatted as requested.
  # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
  # The expressions w^2 and w^3 contain the numbers 2 and 3.
  # The expression for (b) is w^2(a . 1_R)
  # The expression for (c) is w^3(a . 1_R)
  # The numbers in the final equations are 2 and 3.
  # The problem statement is a bit ambiguous here. Let's assume it means the expressions are sufficient.
  # Let's re-read: "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
  # This might mean I should explicitly print the numbers.
  # Let's just format the answer string clearly.
  # The expressions are the "final equations".
