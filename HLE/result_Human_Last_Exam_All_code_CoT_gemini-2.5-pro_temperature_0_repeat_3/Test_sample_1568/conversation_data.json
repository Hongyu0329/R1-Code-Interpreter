    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Product:** The user wants to find the value of the infinite product $\\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$.\n2.  **Factor the Term:** I will factor the general term of the product, $1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3}$, using the complex cube roots of unity: $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$. The factorization is $\\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right)$.\n3.  **Relate to the Gamma Function:** The infinite product from $n=1$ can be related to the Weierstrass product representation of the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z)$. The identity is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n4.  **Adjust the Starting Index:** The given product starts from $n=3$. I will adjust the formula by dividing out the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$, which are $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)$ and $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)$.\n5.  **Final Formula:** This gives the final expression for the product:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(1-z^3)(1-z^3/8) \\cdot \\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n6.  **Python Implementation:** I will write a Python script that implements this formula. The script will define a function that takes a complex number `z` as input. To demonstrate its usage and fulfill the requirement of showing the numbers in the final equation, the function will print the calculated values of each component of the formula for a given `z` before printing the final result. I will use `z=0.5` as an example.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the value of the infinite product.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import gamma\n\ndef calculate_infinite_product(z_val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the value of the infinite product P = prod_{n=3 to inf} (1 - z^3/n^3)\n    for a given complex number z.\n\n    The calculation is based on the formula:\n    P = 1 / [ (1 - z^3) * (1 - z^3/8) * Γ(1-z) * Γ(1-ωz) * Γ(1-ω²z) ]\n    where ω is the principal cube root of unity.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        z = complex(z_val)\n    except (ValueError, TypeError):\n        print(\"Error: Input 'z' must be a number (or a string convertible to a number).\")\n        return\n\n    # Check for values of z that would make the denominator zero or infinite\n    if z.imag == 0 and z.real == int(z.real):\n        if z.real >= 1:\n            print(f\"Error: For integer z >= 1, Γ(1-z) is infinite, making the product 0.\")\n            print(\"∏_{n=3}^{∞} (1 - z^3/n^3) = 0\")\n            return\n    if (1 - z**3 == 0) or (1 - z**3 / 8 == 0):\n        print(f\"Error: For z = {z}, a term in the denominator is zero, making the product infinite.\")\n        return\n\n    # Define the principal cube root of unity, ω = e^(i*2*pi/3)\n    omega = np.exp(1j * 2 * np.pi / 3)\n    omega_sq = omega**2\n\n    # The final equation is Result = 1 / (term_n1 * term_n2 * gamma_z * gamma_omega_z * gamma_omega_sq_z)\n    # We will now calculate and print each of these numbers.\n    print(f\"Calculating the product for z = {z}\\n\")\n    print(\"The final equation is of the form: Result = 1 / (T1 * T2 * G1 * G2 * G3)\")\n    print(\"Here are the values of each component:\")\n\n    # Calculate the terms for n=1 and n=2\n    term_n1 = 1 - z**3\n    term_n2 = 1 - z**3 / 8\n    print(f\"T1 (term for n=1, 1 - z^3) = {term_n1}\")\n    print(f\"T2 (term for n=2, 1 - z^3/8) = {term_n2}\")\n\n    # Calculate the Gamma function components\n    gamma_z = gamma(1 - z)\n    gamma_omega_z = gamma(1 - omega * z)\n    gamma_omega_sq_z = gamma(1 - omega_sq * z)\n    print(f\"G1 (Γ(1-z)) = {gamma_z}\")\n    print(f\"G2 (Γ(1-ωz)) = {gamma_omega_z}\")\n    print(f\"G3 (Γ(1-ω²z)) = {gamma_omega_sq_z}\")\n\n    # Calculate the total denominator\n    denominator = term_n1 * term_n2 * gamma_z * gamma_omega_z * gamma_omega_sq_z\n    print(f\"\\nTotal Denominator (T1*T2*G1*G2*G3) = {denominator}\")\n\n    # The result is 1 / denominator\n    result = 1 / denominator\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Result (1 / Denominator) = {result}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Example usage with z = 0.5.
