    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we need to determine its value in scientific notation. Let the number be $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. We want to express it as $N = M \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le M < 10$ is the mantissa and $k$ is an integer exponent. The first two non-zero digits of $N$ will be the first two digits of the mantissa $M$.\n\nWe can find $M$ and $k$ by taking the base-10 logarithm of $N$:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$\n$\\log_{10}(N) = -7^{13} \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nSince $\\log_{10}(e) = \\frac{\\ln(e)}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)}$, we have:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = -\\frac{7^{13}}{\\ln(10)}$\n\nLet's calculate the value of this expression. Let $y = \\frac{7^{13}}{\\ln(10)}$. Then $\\log_{10}(N) = -y$.\nWe can decompose $y$ into its integer part $\\lfloor y \\rfloor$ and its fractional part $\\{y\\}$, so $y = \\lfloor y \\rfloor + \\{y\\}$.\nThen, $\\log_{10}(N) = -(\\lfloor y \\rfloor + \\{y\\})$.\n\nTo match the form $\\log_{10}(N) = k + \\log_{10}(M)$, where $k$ is an integer and $0 \\le \\log_{10}(M) < 1$, we can rewrite the expression:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = (1 - \\{y\\}) - (\\lfloor y \\rfloor + 1)$\n\nFrom this, we can identify:\n- The exponent: $k = -(\\lfloor y \\rfloor + 1)$\n- The logarithm of the mantissa: $\\log_{10}(M) = 1 - \\{y\\}$\n\nThis means the mantissa is $M = 10^{(1 - \\{y\\})}$.\n\nThe calculation involves very large numbers and requires high precision, so we will use Python's `decimal` library. The following script implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef find_first_two_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set the precision for decimal calculations. The numbers involved are large,\n    # so a high precision is necessary for the fractional part to be accurate.\n    decimal.getcontext().prec = 50\n\n    # The number is N = e^(-7^13).\n    # We express N in scientific notation: N = M * 10^k, where 1 <= M < 10.\n    # The first two non-zero digits of N are the first two digits of the mantissa M.\n\n    # To find M and k, we use the base-10 logarithm:\n    # log10(N) = -7^13 / ln(10)\n    # Let y = 7^13 / ln(10).\n    # log10(N) = -y = (1 - {y}) - (floor(y) + 1)\n    # So, k = -(floor(y) + 1) and M = 10^(1 - {y}).\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate y = 7^13 / ln(10)\n    val_7_13 = decimal.Decimal(7) ** 13\n    ln_10 = decimal.Decimal(10).ln()\n    y = val_7_13 / ln_10\n\n    # Step 2: Decompose y into its integer and fractional parts\n    floor_y = y.to_integral_value(decimal.ROUND_FLOOR)\n    frac_y = y - floor_y\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the exponent k for the scientific notation\n    k = -(floor_y + 1)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the mantissa M\n    mantissa_exponent = 1 - frac_y\n    M = decimal.Decimal(10) ** mantissa_exponent\n\n    # Step 5: The first two non-zero digits of N are the first two digits of M.\n    # We can get them by calculating floor(M * 10).\n    first_two_digits = (M * 10).to_integral_value(decimal.ROUND_FLOOR)\n\n    print(f\"The number e^(-7^13) can be written in scientific notation as M * 10^k.\")\n    print(f\"The numbers in this equation are:\")\n    print(f\"Mantissa M = {M}\")\n    print(f\"Exponent k = {k}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13) are the first two digits of the mantissa M.\")\n    print(f\"The first two digits are: {first_two_digits}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_first_two_digits()\n```\n<<<46>>>"
