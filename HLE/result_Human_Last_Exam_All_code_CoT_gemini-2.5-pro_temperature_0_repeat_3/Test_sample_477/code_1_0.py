    Explains the role of LIG1 in CTG repeat instability in Myotonic Dystrophy.

    print("Step 1: Understanding the problem.")
    print("Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1) is caused by an expansion of CTG repeats. These repeats are unstable in somatic cells, meaning they tend to get longer over time. This is called somatic instability.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 2: The role of DNA replication and repair.")
    print("The expansion process is linked to DNA replication. When the replication machinery copies the CTG repeat tract, the new DNA strand can slip and form a hairpin loop. This loop contains the 'extra' repeats.")
    print("For this expansion to become permanent, the replication and repair process must be completed. This involves filling any gaps and, crucially, ligating (sealing) the nicks in the DNA backbone.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 3: The specific function of LIG1.")
    print("LIG1 (DNA Ligase 1) is the primary enzyme responsible for sealing these nicks during DNA replication, especially on the lagging strand where Okazaki fragments are formed.")
    print("In the context of CTG expansion, LIG1 is required for the final step that makes the expansion permanent. It ligates the newly synthesized strand, locking in the extra repeats that were incorporated into the hairpin loop.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 4: The impact of knocking out or reducing LIG1.")
    print("Scientific studies using mouse models and cell lines have shown that reducing the amount of LIG1 (e.g., in a heterozygous LIG1+/- mouse) interferes with this final ligation step.")
    print("Without sufficient LIG1, the expansion process is stalled or aborted. The unligated intermediates are likely removed by other pathways that do not lead to expansion.")
    print("Therefore, reducing LIG1 function leads to a significant suppression of CTG repeat expansion.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The impact of knocking out (or reducing) LIG1 is a reduction in somatic instability of the CTG repeat.")
    print("This corresponds to Answer Choice C.")
