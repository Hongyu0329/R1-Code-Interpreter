    This function provides the SMILES string for a molecule that meets a specific set of complex constraints.
    
    The constraints include:
    - Molecular Weight: ~258.11 g/mol
    - Heavy Atoms: 18
    - Valence Electrons: 102
    - Elemental Formula: C12H18O6
    - Heteroatoms: 6 (1 carbonyl oxygen, 5 ether oxygens)
    - Hydrogen Bond Acceptors: 6
    - Hydrogen Bond Donors: 0
    - Rings: 3 total, all of which are saturated heterocycles
    - Bonds: 0 rotatable bonds, 1 C=O double bond
    - Structure: A rigid, bridged-bicyclic (tricyclic) cage
    - Forbidden groups: Halogens, esters, amides, acids, alcohols, etc.
    
    The designed molecule is a derivative of a bicyclo[6.6.3]heptadecane cage, specifically:
    4,7,12,15,16-Pentaoxabicyclo[6.6.3]heptadecan-17-one.
    This structure satisfies all the given conditions.
