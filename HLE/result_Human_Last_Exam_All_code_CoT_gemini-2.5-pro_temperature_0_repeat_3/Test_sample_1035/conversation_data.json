    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum total number of vertices in a set of bipartite graphs that collectively cover all edges of a complete graph $K_n$ with $n=35$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the core problem:** The question asks for the minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(G_i)|$, where $\\{G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k\\}$ is a family of bipartite graphs such that the union of their edge sets is the edge set of the complete graph $K_n$.\n2.  **Recall the relevant theorem:** This is a known problem in extremal graph theory. The minimum value is given by the formula $n \\cdot \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$. This result was established by R. Tichy and Zs. Tuza.\n3.  **Apply the formula for n=35:**\n    *   First, we need to calculate $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$.\n    *   Then, we multiply this result by $n=35$.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the result in a clear, descriptive format, including the final equation as requested.\n\nThe calculation for $\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$ can be done using `math.ceil(math.log2(n))` or, more efficiently using integer arithmetic, as `(n - 1).bit_length()` for $n > 1$.\n\nNow, let's execute this plan with the provided Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all the edges of the complete graph K_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    # The problem is a known result in graph theory.
