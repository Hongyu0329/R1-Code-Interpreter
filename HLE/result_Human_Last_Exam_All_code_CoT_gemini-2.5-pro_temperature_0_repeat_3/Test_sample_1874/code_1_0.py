# This script determines the second smallest possible cardinal for the described tower.
# The reasoning is based on established theorems in ZFC set theory.

# Let omega_n be the n-th infinite cardinal.
# The problem concerns subsets of omega_2.

# Step 1: The problem describes a cofinal chain in the poset P = ([omega_2]^(omega_2), subseteq^*).
# The smallest cardinal for such a chain is the cofinality of P, let's call it delta_1.

# Step 2: A theorem in ZFC states that cof(P) > omega_2.
# The index of the cardinal omega_2 is 2.
base_cardinal_index = 2

# Step 3: Since delta_1 is a cardinal and delta_1 > omega_2, the smallest possible
# value for delta_1 is the successor cardinal, omega_3. This is known to be consistent with ZFC.
smallest_possible_delta_index = base_cardinal_index + 1

# Step 4: The set of all possible cardinal lengths for such a tower is the set of all
# cardinals greater than or equal to the smallest possible length.
# Smallest possible length: omega_3
# Second smallest possible length: successor of omega_3, which is omega_4.
second_smallest_possible_delta_index = smallest_possible_delta_index + 1

# Step 5: The final answer is omega_4. We output the components of the final calculation.
print(f"The index of the base cardinal is {base_cardinal_index}.")
print(f"The index of the smallest possible delta is {base_cardinal_index} + 1 = {smallest_possible_delta_index}.")
print(f"The index of the second smallest possible delta is {smallest_possible_delta_index} + 1 = {second_smallest_possible_delta_index}.")
print(f"Therefore, the second smallest cardinal delta possible is omega_{second_smallest_possible_delta_index}.")
