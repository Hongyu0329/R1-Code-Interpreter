    # Step 1: Define the group and its dimension.
    # The group G is SO_3(R), the special orthogonal group in 3 dimensions (rotations in 3D space).
    # The dimension of SO(n) is given by the formula d = n * (n - 1) / 2.

    # Step 2: Explain the scaling argument.
    # The problem defines n(N) as the smallest integer n such that X^n = G for any
    # compact set X with Haar measure mu(X) = 1/N.
    # The asymptotic behavior is n(N) ~ N^alpha. We need to find alpha.

    # The "worst-case" set X (the one that takes the longest to cover G) is a small ball.
    # Let r be the radius of this ball.
    # The measure of the ball is proportional to r^d: mu(X) ~ r^d.
    # We are given mu(X) = 1/N, so 1/N ~ r^d, which implies r ~ (1/N)^(1/d) = N^(-1/d).

    # The set X^n is roughly a ball of radius n*r.
    # For X^n to cover the group G, its radius must be of the order of the diameter of G, which is a constant.
    # So, n*r ~ constant.

    # Step 3: Derive alpha.
    # From n*r ~ constant, we get n ~ 1/r.
    # Substituting r ~ N^(-1/d), we get n ~ 1 / (N^(-1/d)) = N^(1/d).
    # By comparing n ~ N^(1/d) with the given relation n(N) ~ N^alpha, we find that alpha = 1/d.
