    Analyzes the statements about attack graph analysis to find the incorrect one.

    A. Correct. Attack graphs are directed graphs, and graph theory algorithms are fundamental to their analysis.
    B. Correct. The state explosion problem is a well-known challenge where the graph size can be exponential, O(2^N), with respect to system variables.
    C. Incorrect. The attack graph generation/reachability problem is generally considered PSPACE-complete, which is a more precise and generally harder complexity class than NP-hard. While the problem is intractable, labeling it as NP-hard is an inaccurate simplification.
    D. Correct. Real-world systems are dynamic, necessitating incremental updates to attack graphs to maintain their relevance.
    E. Correct. Attack graphs serve as models for formal verification techniques like model checking to prove or disprove security properties.

    The only clearly incorrect statement is C.
