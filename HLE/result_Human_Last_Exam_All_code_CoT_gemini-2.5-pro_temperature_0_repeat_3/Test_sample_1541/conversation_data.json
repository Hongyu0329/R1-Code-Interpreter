    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem and determine the memory usage for the most efficient C program.\n\n### Plan\n\nMy goal is to determine the value of `m`, which represents the total memory in bytes used by the variables in the most memory-efficient C program for the given task.\n\n1.  **Design a Memory-Efficient C Program:** To minimize memory, the program should not store the entire input string. Instead, it can process the input character by character. The best approach is to use a \"counting sort\" method, as the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   The C program will read characters one by one using `getchar()`.\n    *   It will use a small integer array of size 4, let's call it `counts`, to keep track of the frequency of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4).\n    *   After counting all the numbers from the input, it will loop through the `counts` array to print the final sorted sum. It will print '1' `counts[0]` times, then '2' `counts[1]` times, and so on, adding a '+' between the numbers.\n\n2.  **Calculate Memory Usage (`m`):** I will calculate the total memory required for the variables declared in this C program. I will assume a standard environment where an `int` variable occupies 4 bytes.\n    *   `int counts[4]`: An array of 4 integers for counting `-> 4 * 4 = 16` bytes.\n    *   `int c`: A variable to store the input character from `getchar()` (which returns an `int`) `-> 4` bytes.\n    *   `int i, j`: Two integer variables for loops `-> 2 * 4 = 8` bytes.\n    *   `int first`: A flag to correctly handle printing the `+` separator `-> 4` bytes.\n    *   **Total `m`**: `16 + 4 + 8 + 4 = 32` bytes.\n\nFollowing the request to provide a Python script, here is a solution to the original problem of rearranging the sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), sorts the numbers,\n    and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the input string, e.g., \"3+2+1\"\n    s = input()\n\n    # Split the string by the '+' character to get a list of numbers as strings\n    # e.g., [\"3\", \"2\", \"1\"]\n    numbers = s.split('+')\n\n    # Sort the list of numbers. Since they are single digits,\n    # lexical sorting is equivalent to numerical sorting.\n    # e.g., [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"]\n    numbers.sort()\n\n    # Join the sorted list of numbers back into a string with '+' as the separator\n    # e.g., \"1+2+3\"\n    new_sum = \"+\".join(numbers)\n\n    # Print the final rearranged sum\n    print(new_sum)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<32>>>"
