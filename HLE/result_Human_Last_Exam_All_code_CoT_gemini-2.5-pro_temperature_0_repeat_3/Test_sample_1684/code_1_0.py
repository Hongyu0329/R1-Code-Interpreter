    This function calculates the smallest possible k based on a known theorem in spectral geometry.

    The problem asks for the smallest value k such that for any smooth Riemannian metric
    on the sphere S^2 with a total area of 4*pi, the second nonzero eigenvalue
    of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, lambda_2, is always less than k.

    This value k is the supremum of lambda_2 over the space of all such metrics.
    k = sup{ lambda_2(g) | g is a metric on S^2 with Area(g) = 4*pi }

    A key result in spectral geometry, proven by V. Petrides (2014), states that
    the supremum of the scale-invariant product lambda_2 * Area is 16*pi for any
    metric on S^2.
    
    So, for any metric g:
    lambda_2(g) * Area(g) <= 16 * pi

    We can use this to find the supremum for lambda_2 when the area is fixed.
