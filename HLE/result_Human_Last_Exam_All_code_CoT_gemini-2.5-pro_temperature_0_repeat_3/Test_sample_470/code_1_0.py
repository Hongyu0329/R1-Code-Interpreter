# This script calculates the value of k(B) - l(B) based on the provided information.

# Step 1: Define the parameters from the problem statement.
# The defect group D is (C_2)^5.
rank_of_D = 5
order_of_D = 2**rank_of_D

# The inertial quotient E has order 5.
order_of_E = 5

# Step 2: Calculate l(B), the number of irreducible Brauer characters.
# For a block with an abelian defect group, l(B) is the order of the inertial quotient E.
l_B = order_of_E

# Step 3: Calculate k(B), the number of irreducible ordinary characters.
# We use the formula for the number of orbits of E acting on D (Burnside's Lemma).
# k(B) = (1/|E|) * sum_{e in E} |C_D(e)|

# For the identity element e=1 in E, the number of fixed points is the size of D.
num_fixed_points_identity = order_of_D

# For any non-identity element e in E (there are |E|-1 such elements):
# The action of e on D corresponds to an automorphism of order 5.
# The space D is a 5-dimensional vector space over F_2.
# The characteristic polynomial of this action is (x-1)(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1).
# The number of fixed points |C_D(e)| is the size of the eigenspace for eigenvalue 1.
# The dimension of this eigenspace is the multiplicity of the factor (x-1), which is 1.
# So, the number of fixed points is 2^1 = 2.
num_fixed_points_non_identity = 2

# The sum of fixed points over all elements of E is:
# |C_D(1)| + (|E|-1) * |C_D(e)| for e != 1
sum_of_fixed_points = num_fixed_points_identity + (order_of_E - 1) * num_fixed_points_non_identity

# Now calculate k(B)
k_B = sum_of_fixed_points / order_of_E

# k(B) must be an integer.
k_B = int(k_B)

# Step 4: Compute the final value k(B) - l(B).
result = k_B - l_B

# Step 5: Print the calculation and the final result.
print(f"The number of ordinary characters is k(B) = {k_B}.")
print(f"The number of Brauer characters is l(B) = {l_B}.")
print("The value of k(B) - l(B) is calculated as:")
print(f"{k_B} - {l_B} = {result}")
