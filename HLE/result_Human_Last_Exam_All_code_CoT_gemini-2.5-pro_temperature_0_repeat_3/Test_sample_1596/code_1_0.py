def solve_quaternion_rope_statements():
    """
    Analyzes the statements about Quaternion RoPE and prints the sorted list of true statements.

    Based on the analysis:
    A: False. Depends on m-n, not |m-n|.
    B: False. Quaternion multiplication is not that simple.
    C: True. A fixed axis is required for the RoPE properties to hold.
    D: False. Encodes 1D position, not 3D.
    E: True. Rotation by a unit quaternion is an isometry and preserves the norm.
    F: True. Scalar multiplication is linear.
    G: True. Isometries preserve inner products and thus orthogonality.
    H: True. Composition of rotations with the same axis adds the angles.
    J: True. The commutator is 0, which is a purely imaginary quaternion.
    K: False. The real part is generally not preserved.
    L: True. The trace of the left-multiplication matrix is 4 times the real part.
    M: False. The commutator is always 0 for any fixed axis.
    N: False. The norm is always 1.

    The correct statements are C, E, F, G, H, J, L.
    Sorted, they are CEFGHJL.
