    # The patient's history (new workout clothes) and physical exam (rash on the periphery of the axillary folds, sparing the vault)
    # strongly suggest allergic contact dermatitis from textiles.
    # The question asks for the best next step in DIAGNOSIS.

    # Let's evaluate the options:
    # A. Skin biopsy: Too invasive for a first step in a classic case of suspected contact dermatitis.
    # B. KOH preparation: Used for fungal infections, which is less likely given the presentation.
    # C. Topical steroid: This is a TREATMENT, not a diagnostic test.
    # D. Patch test: This is the gold standard test to confirm allergic contact dermatitis and identify the specific allergen.

    # The case text itself confirms the utility of this test by stating:
    # "Patch testing was performed, and positive reactions were observed to resins used in textile manufacturing."

    # Therefore, the patch test is the most logical and appropriate next step.
