    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Stability Boundary**: The stability of the BDF4 method is determined by analyzing its behavior on the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$. This leads to a stability region in the complex plane for $z = h\\lambda$. The boundary of this region is given by the curve $z(\\theta) = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{j}(1-e^{-i\\theta})^j$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.\n\n2.  **A($\\alpha$)-stability**: The angle $\\alpha$ for A($\\alpha$)-stability is determined by the largest wedge of the form $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha\\}$ that is contained within the stability region. This wedge is bounded by the two tangent lines from the origin to the boundary of the instability region (the \"lobe\" described by $z(\\theta)$).\n\n3.  **Tangency Condition**: A tangent line from the origin to a curve $z(\\theta)$ occurs when the position vector $z(\\theta)$ is collinear with the tangent vector $z'(\\theta) = \\frac{dz}{d\\theta}$. In the complex plane, this means their ratio $z(\\theta)/z'(\\theta)$ must be a real number, so its imaginary part is zero: $\\text{Im}(z(\\theta)/z'(\\theta)) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Solving for the Tangent Point**: I will use the substitution $w = 1 - e^{-i\\theta}$. The tangency condition leads to an algebraic equation. By further substituting $w = 2\\cos(\\phi)e^{i\\phi}$ where $\\phi = (\\pi-\\theta)/2$, the equation simplifies to a polynomial in $x = \\cos(\\phi)$. Solving this equation gives the exact point on the boundary where the tangency occurs.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Angle**: Once the tangent point $z_t$ is found, the angle of the tangent line is $\\psi = \\arg(z_t)$. The stability angle is then $\\alpha = \\arctan(|\\tan(\\psi)|) = \\arctan(|\\text{Im}(z_t)/\\text{Re}(z_t)|)$.\n\n6.  **Python Implementation**: I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform these calculations symbolically, ensuring the final result is exact. The script will derive the tangent point, calculate the real and imaginary parts of $z_t$, and construct the final expression for $\\alpha$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the exact A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols for symbolic computation\n    # y represents x**2, where x = cos(phi) and phi = (pi - theta)/2\n    y = sympy.Symbol('y')\n\n    # Step 1: Find the tangent point.\n    # The condition for the tangent from the origin to the stability boundary z(theta)\n    # is Im(z(theta) / z'(theta)) = 0.\n    # This leads to a polynomial equation for x = cos(phi).\n    # The equation is -800/3 * x**8 + 320/3 * x**6 = 0.\n    # Since x=cos(phi) is not zero for the tangent point, we can divide by x**6.\n    # This gives -800/3 * x**2 + 320/3 = 0, which simplifies to x**2 = 320/800.\n    x_squared = sympy.Rational(320, 800)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate Re(z) and Im(z) at the tangent point.\n    # The real and imaginary parts of z can be expressed as polynomials in x.\n    # Re(z) = 32*x**8 - (64/3)*x**6\n    # Im(z) = sin(phi) * (32*x**7 - (16/3)*x**5 + (4/3)*x**3 + 2*x)\n    # We substitute y = x**2 into these expressions.\n\n    re_z_expr = 32*y**4 - sympy.Rational(64, 3)*y**3\n    re_z_val = re_z_expr.subs(y, x_squared)\n\n    # For Im(z), we have Im(z) = sin(phi) * cos(phi) * (32*x**6 - (16/3)*x**4 + (4/3)*x**2 + 2)\n    # sin(phi) = sqrt(1 - x**2) and cos(phi) = sqrt(x**2)\n    sin_phi = sympy.sqrt(1 - y)\n    cos_phi = sympy.sqrt(y)\n    \n    im_z_term_expr = 32*y**3 - sympy.Rational(16, 3)*y**2 + sympy.Rational(4, 3)*y + 2\n    im_z_term_val = im_z_term_expr.subs(y, x_squared)\n    im_z_val = sin_phi.subs(y, x_squared) * cos_phi.subs(y, x_squared) * im_z_term_val\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the tangent of the angle.\n    # The angle alpha is given by alpha = arctan(|Im(z)/Re(z)|).\n    tan_psi_val = im_z_val / re_z_val\n    abs_tan_psi = sympy.simplify(sympy.Abs(tan_psi_val))\n\n    # Extract coefficients for printing the final equation\n    num, den = abs_tan_psi.as_numer_denom()\n    num_coeff = num.args[0]\n    sqrt_part = num.args[1].args[0]\n\n    # Step 4: Print the results step-by-step.\n    print(\"The exact value of the angle alpha for the A(alpha)-stability of BDF4 is found as follows:\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
