def solve_group_properties():
    """
    This function solves for the rank and torsion order of the abelianization of the given group G.

    The problem is theoretical and its solution relies on established theorems in group theory.
    The code formalizes the result of this theoretical deduction.
    """

    # Step 1: Identify the group G.
    # The group G is a generalized Thompson's group, often denoted F_τ or F_Φ,
    # where τ = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 and Φ = 1/τ is the golden ratio.
    # Φ is a Pisot number, which is a key property.

    # Step 2: State the structure of the abelianization Ab(G).
    # A theorem by Bieri, Strebel, and others states that for a group F_λ where λ
    # is a Pisot number, the abelianization Ab(F_λ) is isomorphic to Z^2.
    # So, Ab(G) ≅ Z^2.

    # Step 3: Compute the rank (r) from Ab(G) ≅ Z^2.
    # The rank of an abelian group is the number of Z factors in its free part.
    # For Z^2 (which is Z ⊕ Z), the rank is 2.
    r = 2

    # Step 4: Compute the order of the torsion subgroup (t) from Ab(G) ≅ Z^2.
    # The torsion subgroup consists of elements of finite order. In Z^2, only the
    # identity element (0, 0) has finite order.
    # Therefore, the torsion subgroup is trivial, and its order is 1.
    t = 1

    # Step 5: Output the final result.
    # The problem asks for the pair (r, t).
    print(f"The rank of Ab(G) is r = {r}")
    print(f"The order of the torsion subgroup of Ab(G) is t = {t}")
    print(f"The final computed pair is (r, t) = ({r}, {t})")
