    "It is not possible to use the mathematics of quantum mechanics to prove Gödel's ontological argument for the existence of god-like entities. The two fields operate in fundamentally different domains.\n\n*   **Gödel's Ontological Proof** is a formal argument in metaphysics that uses **modal logic**. It is built upon a set of axioms (e.g., \"It is possible that a God-like being exists\") and definitions (e.g., \"A God-like being possesses all positive properties\") to logically deduce its conclusion. It is a work of pure logic, not empirical science.\n*   **Quantum Mechanics** is a physical theory that describes the behavior of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. Its mathematical framework is built on **linear algebra, probability theory, and functional analysis** (specifically, Hilbert spaces). It deals with physical observables, state vectors, and probabilities of measurement outcomes.\n\nAttempting to use the Schrödinger equation to prove a theorem in modal logic would be a category error, similar to trying to use the rules of grammar to solve an algebraic equation. The tools and subjects are entirely unrelated.\n\nTo illustrate this fundamental difference, the following Python code will print the key \"equation\" or conclusion from each domain. This highlights their distinct nature and the incompatibility of their formalisms.\n\n```python\ndef illustrate_incompatible_domains():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function illustrates the different mathematical and logical languages\n    of Gödel's Ontological Proof and Quantum Mechanics to show their incompatibility.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Domain 1: Gödel's Ontological Proof (Modal Logic) ---\")\n    print(\"This is a metaphysical argument using symbolic logic.\")\n    print(\"Its conclusion, that a God-like being necessarily exists, is written as:\")\n    # □ is the modal operator for \"necessarily\"\n    # ∃ is the existential quantifier for \"there exists\"\n    # G(x) means \"x is God-like\"\n    print(\"\\nEquation of Conclusion: □ ∃x G(x)\\n\")\n    print(\"This equation contains only logical symbols and predicates.\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Domain 2: Quantum Mechanics (Physics) ---\")\n    print(\"This is a physical theory describing the evolution of a quantum state.\")\n    print(\"Its central equation is the Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation:\")\n    # i is the imaginary unit\n    # ħ (h-bar) is the reduced Planck constant\n    # ∂/∂t is the partial derivative with respect to time\n    # |ψ(t)⟩ is the state vector of the quantum system\n    # H is the Hamiltonian operator (total energy of the system)\n    print(\"\\nCentral Equation: i * ħ * (∂/∂t)|ψ(t)⟩ = H|ψ(t)⟩\\n\")\n    print(\"This equation contains physical constants (ħ), mathematical numbers (i), operators (H, ∂/∂t), and state vectors (|ψ(t)⟩).\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: The formalisms are non-overlapping.
