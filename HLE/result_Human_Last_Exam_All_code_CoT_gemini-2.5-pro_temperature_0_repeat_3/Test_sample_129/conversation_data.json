    "This problem asks us to count the number of boolean expressions of a specific length (5) that evaluate to true. The set of allowed symbols is `T, F, !, &, |, (, )`. Since the total number of possible strings of length 5 is manageable (7^5 = 16807), we can use a computational approach to solve this.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Generate all possibilities:** I will create every possible string of length 5 using the given symbols. The `itertools.product` function in Python is perfect for this.\n2.  **Check for validity and truthfulness:** For each generated string, I need to determine if it's a valid boolean expression and if it evaluates to `True`.\n3.  **Safe Evaluation:** A straightforward way to do this is to convert the expression into a format that Python can understand and then use the `eval()` function. For example, `T&F` becomes `True and False`. To ensure safety, `eval()` will be executed in a restricted environment where only `True` and `False` are defined.\n4.  **Error Handling:** Many generated strings (like `T(F)!&` or `&&&&&`) will not be valid expressions. These will cause errors when evaluated. I will use a `try...except` block to catch these errors and simply ignore the invalid strings.\n5.  **Count and Output:** I will maintain a counter that increments each time a valid expression evaluates to `True`. The final count will be printed as the result.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It will iterate through all 16,807 possible strings, evaluate each one, and print the final count of expressions that are true.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_true_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all possible expressions of length 5 from the given symbols,\n    evaluates them, and counts how many are true.\n    \"\"\"\n    symbols = ['T', 'F', '!', '&', '|', '(', ')']\n    true_expression_count = 0\n\n    # Generate all possible strings of length 5\n    all_combinations = itertools.product(symbols, repeat=5)\n\n    for combo in all_combinations:\n        # Create the expression string, e.g., \"T&F|T\"\n        expr_str = \"\".join(combo)\n\n        # Convert the expression string into a Python-evaluable format.\n        # We add spaces around operators and values to ensure they are treated\n        # as distinct tokens by Python's parser.\n        py_expr = expr_str.replace('T', ' True ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('F', ' False ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('!', ' not ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('&', ' and ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('|', ' or ')\n\n        try:\n            # Evaluate the expression in a safe, restricted environment.\n            # The 'globals' dictionary only allows 'True' and 'False' to be recognized.\n            # The 'locals' dictionary is empty.\n            # This prevents the execution of any malicious code.\n            result = eval(py_expr, {\"True\": True, \"False\": False}, {})\n            \n            # Check if the expression evaluates to True\n            if result is True:\n                true_expression_count += 1\n        except Exception:\n            # If eval() raises any error (e.g., SyntaxError, TypeError),\n            # it means the string is not a valid boolean expression.\n            # We simply ignore it and move to the next combination.\n            pass\n            \n    return true_expression_count\n\n# Calculate and print the final count.\nfinal_count = count_true_expressions()\nprint(final_count)\n```\n<<<410>>>"
