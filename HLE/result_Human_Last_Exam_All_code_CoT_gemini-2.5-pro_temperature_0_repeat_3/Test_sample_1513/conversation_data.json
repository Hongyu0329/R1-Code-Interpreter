    "This is a geographical riddle. My plan is to solve it by identifying the key constraints and finding the location that matches all of them.\n\n1.  **Analyze the constraints:**\n    *   **Location:** An island town.\n    *   **Isolation:** More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island. This points to one of the most remote places on Earth.\n    *   **Geology:** Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    *   **Naming:** The bay and the town share the same name.\n\n2.  **Evaluate candidates:**\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** This is a prime candidate for remoteness. Its main town is Hanga Roa, which is situated on Hanga Roa Bay. The names match. The island is entirely volcanic and features famous calderas like Rano Kau. The nearest inhabited land is over 2,000 km away, satisfying the \"> 500 km\" rule. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha:** The main settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. It's extremely remote but doesn't sit in a bay that shares its name.\n    *   **Santorini, Greece:** Famous for its caldera bay, but it is not remote and is close to many other inhabited islands.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The answer is Hanga Roa. I will write a Python script that defines these criteria and prints the solution. The script will explicitly mention the 500 km distance from the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef solve_geography_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves a geographical riddle by encoding the clues\n    and presenting the location that matches them.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Clues from the riddle ---\n    # The final equation is the combination of these facts leading to the answer.\n    # Fact 1: Distance requirement\n    min_distance_km = 500\n\n    # Fact 2: Geological features\n    geological_feature = \"volcanic caldera\"\n    location_type = \"bay\"\n\n    # Fact 3: Naming convention\n    # The town's name is the same as the bay's name.\n\n    # --- The Solution ---\n    town = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    island = \"Easter Island (Rapa Nui)\"\n    bay = \"Hanga Roa Bay\"\n    distance_to_nearest_inhabited_land_km = 2075 # Distance to Pitcairn Islands\n\n    # --- Presenting the Answer ---\n    print(f\"Solving the riddle with the following facts:\")\n    print(f\"1.
