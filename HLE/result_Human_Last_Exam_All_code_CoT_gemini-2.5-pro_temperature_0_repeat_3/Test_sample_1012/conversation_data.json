    "To determine the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against a quantum computer, we need to consider the most effective quantum algorithm for breaking symmetric encryption.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Threat:** The primary threat from quantum computers against symmetric key cryptography is Grover's algorithm.\n2.  **Explain Grover's Algorithm's Effect:** Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems. For a key of length 'n', a classical computer needs approximately 2^n operations (brute-force search). Grover's algorithm can find the key in approximately sqrt(2^n) = 2^(n/2) operations. This effectively halves the bit strength of the key.\n3.  **Establish a Security Benchmark:** The current standard for strong symmetric encryption against classical computers is a 128-bit key, which provides a security level of 2^128. This is considered computationally infeasible to break.\n4.  **Calculate the Required Quantum-Resistant Key Length:** To maintain a security level of 128 bits against a quantum computer, we need a new key length, let's call it 'k', such that the quantum attack complexity is at least 2^128.\n    *   Quantum Attack Complexity: 2^(k/2)\n    *   Desired Security Level: 2^128\n    *   Set them equal: 2^(k/2) = 2^128\n    *   Solve for k: k/2 = 128  =>  k = 256\n5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, a symmetric key needs to be at least 256 bits long to provide the same level of security against a quantum computer that a 128-bit key provides against a classical computer.\n\nThe following Python code will demonstrate this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quantum_resistant_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length to be secure against a quantum computer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The current standard for strong security against classical computers is 128 bits.\n    # This means an attacker would need to perform roughly 2^128 operations.\n    classical_security_level_bits = 128\n\n    # Grover's algorithm, a quantum search algorithm, provides a quadratic speedup.\n    # It can break a key of length 'n' in sqrt(2^n) = 2^(n/2) operations.\n    # This means it effectively halves the security bits of a key.\n    grover_speedup_factor = 2\n\n    # To maintain a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer,\n    # the key length must be doubled.\n    quantum_resistant_key_length = classical_security_level_bits * grover_speedup_factor\n\n    print(\"### Quantum Resistance for Symmetric Keys ###\")\n    print(f\"Standard classical security level: {classical_security_level_bits} bits\")\n    print(\"Grover's quantum algorithm effectively halves the bit strength of a symmetric key.\")\n    print(\"To maintain the same level of security, we must double the key length.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"Required Key Length = (Classical Security Level) * (Grover's Speedup Factor)\")\n    print(f\"Required Key Length = {classical_security_level_bits} * {grover_speedup_factor} = {quantum_resistant_key_length} bits\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, a symmetric key needs to be at least {quantum_resistant_key_length} bits long to be secure against a quantum computer.\")\n\ncalculate_quantum_resistant_key_length()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
