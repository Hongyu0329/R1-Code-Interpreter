def solve_semantic_transparency():
    """
    This function models the semantic transparency of languages based on the
    theory of MÃ¼ller-Gotama (1994) and general linguistic principles.

    Semantic transparency refers to how easily the meaning of a complex word
    can be deduced from its parts.
    - Russian: High transparency due to a rich and regular derivational system.
    - German: High transparency due to productive compounding.
    - Old English: More transparent than Modern English, with clearer Germanic roots and compounds.
    - Modern English: Less transparent due to heavy borrowing of opaque words from Latin and French.

    We assign arbitrary scores to represent this ranking.
