    "My plan is to first deduce the transformation rule by examining the provided input-output grid pairs. After analyzing the examples, I've determined a consistent rule that applies to all of them. Then, I will apply this rule to the sixth test grid to generate its corresponding output grid.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation Rule:** I will compare the input and output grids for the first five examples to find a pattern. My analysis suggests that the value of each cell in the output grid depends on the state of the cells in its 3x3 neighborhood in the input grid.\n2.  **Identify the Specific Rule:** Through careful examination, I've found that the rule is a variation of Conway's Game of Life. A cell in the output grid is set to `1` if the sum of its eight neighbors in the input grid is exactly `2` or `3`. Otherwise, the cell is set to `0`. Notably, the original value of the cell itself does not affect the outcome.\n3.  **Implement the Rule in Python:** I will write a Python script to apply this rule to the sixth test input grid.\n    *   The script will store the input grid as a 2D list.\n    *   It will iterate through each cell of the grid.\n    *   For each cell, it will calculate the sum of its eight neighbors, correctly handling the cells on the edges and corners.\n    *   Based on the sum, it will determine the value of the corresponding cell in the output grid (`1` if the sum is 2 or 3, `0` otherwise).\n4.  **Generate and Print the Output:** The script will construct the final 5x5 output grid and then print it to the console, with each row on a new line.\n\nThis approach will systematically solve the problem and produce the required output grid for the test case.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the grid transformation puzzle.\n    The rule, derived from the examples, is as follows:\n    A cell in the output grid is 1 if the sum of its 8 neighbors in the input grid is 2 or 3.\n    Otherwise, the cell is 0. The cell's own original value is irrelevant.\n    This function applies this rule to the test grid and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    input_grid = [\n        [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n    ]\n\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            neighbor_sum = 0\n            # Iterate over the 8 neighbors\n            for i in range(r - 1, r + 2):\n                for j in range(c - 1, c + 2):\n                    # Skip the cell itself\n                    if i == r and j == c:\n                        continue\n                    # Check for boundary conditions\n                    if 0 <= i < rows and 0 <= j < cols:\n                        neighbor_sum += input_grid[i][j]\n            \n            # Apply the rule\n            if neighbor_sum == 2 or neighbor_sum == 3:\n                output_grid[r][c] = 1\n            else:\n                output_grid[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Print the output grid row by row\n    for row in output_grid:\n        print(\" \".join(map(str, row)))\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<1111010011101011000101111>>>"
