    "I will find the common name for the genus *Perdita* and the year it was prominently introduced. My plan is to:\n1.  Search entomological databases and literature for the common name associated with the bee genus *Perdita*.\n2.  Identify a key publication that coined or popularized this common name.\n3.  Write a Python script to store the name and year in variables and then print them in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef get_perdita_common_name_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the common name and year of coining for the bee genus Perdita.\n\n    The common name \"fairy bees\" was popularized in the influential 1996 book\n    \"The Forgotten Pollinators\" by Stephen L.
