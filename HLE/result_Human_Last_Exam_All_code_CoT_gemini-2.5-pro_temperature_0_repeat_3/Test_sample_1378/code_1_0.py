    # Choice A: The locals were wary of American intervention due to differing racial policy.
    # Analysis: Incorrect. Sources show the locals welcomed the American intervention for its practical benefits.

    # Choice B: The locals wanted independence from the British Empire but preferred Canadian annexation to American annexation.
    # Analysis: Incorrect. This incident does not provide evidence for a preference for Canadian annexation.
    print("B: Incorrect. The specific incident does not support a preference for Canadian annexation.")

    # Choice C: The locals were loyal British subjects and preferred colonial administration to American intervention.
    # Analysis: Incorrect. This represents the Governor's view, not the local population's. The locals were angry with the colonial administration's decision.
    print("C: Incorrect. This was the Governor's view, which the locals opposed.")

    # Choice D: The locals were agnistic to Ango-American affairs, anticipating Canadian annexation.
    # Analysis: Incorrect. The locals were not 'agnostic'; they had a strong opinion. No evidence for anticipating Canadian annexation in this context.
    print("D: Incorrect. Locals had a strong opinion, and the Canadian annexation part is unsupported.")

    # Choice E: The locals preferred American annexation over British rule due to the economic ties between the countries and associated material benefits.
    # Analysis: Correct. While 'annexation' might be a strong term, the locals' actions clearly showed they preferred the 'material benefits' from the Americans over the Governor's enforcement of British colonial authority. This choice best captures the essence of the local population's reaction.
