    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the final calculation.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression:**\n    The core of the problem is to understand the given SKI expression: `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`.\n    To do this, we first identify common and important combinator patterns.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Combinators:**\n    *   **Successor (`succ`):** The expression `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the standard SKI representation of the successor function for Church numerals. It takes a Church numeral `n` and returns `n+1`.\n    *   **Church Numeral 1 (`c1`):** The identity combinator `I` is equivalent to the Church numeral for 1 (`c1`), as it applies a function once to its argument (`I f x -> f x`).\n    *   **Self-Application (`U`):** The combinator `S(I)` is a self-application combinator. When applied to an argument `x`, it reduces as follows: `S(I) x -> I x (I x) -> x x`.\n    *   **Another `c1`:** The expression `S(I)(I)` reduces to `I I (I I) -> I I -> I`, which is also `c1`.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    Let's substitute these identified parts back into the main expression.\n    *   The sub-expression `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is `succ(I)`, which is `succ(c1)`, giving us the Church numeral for 2 (`c2`).\n    *   The sub-expression `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))` is `succ(S(I)(I))`, which simplifies to `succ(I)` or `succ(c1)`, also resulting in `c2`.\n\n    Now, the main expression simplifies to: `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(c2)))(c2)))`.\n\n4.  **Reduce the Simplified Expression:**\n    Using `U` for `S(I)`, the expression is `U(U(U(K(c2)))(c2)))`. We can now reduce this step-by-step:\n    *   First, `U(K(c2))` reduces to `(K(c2))(K(c2))`. By the rule for `K` (`K x y -> x`), this reduces to `c2`.\n    *   The expression becomes `U(U(c2)(c2)))`.\n    *   Next, `U(c2)` reduces to `c2 c2`.\n    *   The expression becomes `U((c2 c2)(c2)))`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Church Numeral Operations:**\n    In SKI combinator logic, applying one Church numeral to another, `c_a c_b`, corresponds to exponentiation, `b^a`. The applications are left-associative.\n    *   First, we evaluate `c2 c2`, which means `2^2 = 4`. This gives us `c4`.\n    *   The expression in the parentheses becomes `c4 c2`, which means `2^4 = 16`. This gives us `c16`.\n    *   So, the entire expression simplifies to `U(c16)`.\n\n6.  **Final Reduction:**\n    *   `U(c16)` reduces to `c16 c16`.\n    *   This final expression represents the Church numeral `n`. Its value is `16^16`.\n\n7.  **Calculate log_2(n):**\n    The problem asks for `log_2(n)`, where `n = 16^16`.\n    *   `log_2(16^16) = 16 * log_2(16)`\n    *   Since `16 = 2^4`, `log_2(16) = 4`.\n    *   The result is `16 * 4 = 64`.\n\nThe following Python code implements the numerical calculation based on this derivation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Based on the reduction of the SKI expression, the church integer n\n# is equivalent to 16^16.\n# This is derived from the structure ((c2 c2) c2) ((c2 c2) c2),\n# where c2 is the Church numeral for 2.\n\n# Let's represent the operations on the numbers.\n# c2 c2 -> 2^2\nc4_val = 2**2\n# (c4) c2 -> 2^4\nc16_val = c4_val**2 # This is (2^2)^2 = 2^4 = 16. A small correction in logic here.\n# Let's re-evaluate c4 c2. It's 2^4, not 4^2.\n# c_a c_b -> b^a. So c4 c2 -> 2^4 = 16.\nc16_val = 2**c4_val\n\n# The final expression is c16 c16, which is 16^16.\nn_base = c16_val\nn_exponent = c16_val\nn = n_base ** n_exponent\n\n# The final task is to calculate log_2(n).\nlog_base = 2\nresult = math.log2(n)\n\n# Print the final equation as requested.\n# The equation is log_2(16^16) = 64.\nprint(f\"The integer n is {n_base}^{n_exponent}.\")\nprint(f\"The calculation is: log_{log_base}({n_base}^{n_exponent}) = {n_exponent} * log_{log_base}({n_base}) = {n_exponent} * {int(math.log2(n_base))} = {int(result)}\")\nprint(\"The final answer is:\")\nprint(int(result))\n```\n<<<64>>>"
