    "Of course, I can help with that. The film you're referring to is a classic.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the film and the specific character and scene. The film is \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" and the character is Brooks Hatlen.\n2.  After being paroled after 50 years in prison, Brooks is disoriented and frightened by the outside world. His polite \"Thank you\" to the bus driver is a poignant moment that underscores his institutionalization.\n3.  This inability to adapt to life outside of prison ultimately leads him to take his own life, thus sealing his fate.\n4.  I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables and then prints it in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_film_and_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the film and character based on the user's query.\n    \"\"\"\n    film_title = \"The Shawshank Redemption\"\n    character_name = \"Brooks Hatlen\"\n    scene_context = (\n        \"After being paroled from prison after 50 years, \"\n        \"is overwhelmed by the modern world. While boarding a bus, he politely says 'Thank you' \"\n        \"to the driver. This small act highlights his deep-seated institutionalization and inability to cope \"\n        \"with his newfound freedom, which ultimately leads to his tragic fate.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"The Oscar-nominated film is '{film_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"The character is {character_name}, who seals his fate by saying \\\"Thank you\\\" while boarding a bus.\")\n    print(f\"Context: The character, {character_name}, {scene_context}\")\n\nfind_film_and_scene()\n```\n<<<The Shawshank Redemption>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Oscar-nominated film does a character seal his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
