    "This is a classic literary riddle. The solution relies on a multilingual pun that combines descriptive elements of Vienna with the name of an English poet. Here is the thinking process:\n\n1.  **Identify the key elements:** The riddle mentions a \"Russian translation,\" \"wide boulevards of Vienna,\" and the \"surname of an English poet.\"\n2.  **Focus on Vienna's boulevards:** The most famous boulevard in Vienna is the **Ringstrasse**, which translates to \"Ring Street.\" In conversation and writing, it's often just called the \"Ring.\"\n3.  **Consider the description:** Essays about Vienna, particularly by Russian authors like Joseph Brodsky, often comment on the distinctive color of the imperial-era buildings along the Ringstrasse. This color is a characteristic brownish-yellow.\n4.  **Combine the clues:** The description involves the color **\"brown\"** and the road's name, the **\"Ring.\"**\n5.  **Form the pun:** Putting these two elements together—\"Brown\" + \"Ring\"—phonetically forms the surname of the famous English poet, Robert **Browning**.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this logic and prints the resulting name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_vienna_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by combining descriptive elements of Vienna\n    to form the surname of an English poet.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The riddle points to the characteristic color of the buildings on Vienna's main boulevard.\n    descriptive_color = \"Brown\"\n\n    # The main boulevard in Vienna is the Ringstrasse, or \"Ring\" for short.\n    # The \"-ing\" part of the poet's name comes from \"Ring\".\n    boulevard_name_part = \"ing\"\n\n    # The surname is formed by combining the color and the part from the boulevard's name.\n    poet_surname = descriptive_color + boulevard_name_part\n\n    print(\"The riddle describes the boulevards of Vienna.\")\n    print(\"The logic combines two key observations:\")\n    print(f\"1. The color of the imperial buildings: '{descriptive_color}'\")\n    print(f\"2. The name of the main boulevard, the 'Ring', which gives us: '{boulevard_name_part}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"Combining these gives the surname: {descriptive_color} + {boulevard_name_part} = {poet_surname}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The English poet is Robert {poet_surname}.\")\n\nsolve_vienna_riddle()\n```\n<<<Browning>>>"
