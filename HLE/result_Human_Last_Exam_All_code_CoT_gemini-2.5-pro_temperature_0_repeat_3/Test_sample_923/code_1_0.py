# This script will print the exact error message produced by the Godot 4.3 IDE
# when it parses the provided GDscript.

# The error occurs on line 4: `if "texture" in list(json_data):`
# GDScript does not have a built-in `list()` function for converting dictionaries.
# The parser identifies `list` as an undeclared function.
# While there is another error later in the script (`JSON.new()`), the parser
# reports the first one it finds.
