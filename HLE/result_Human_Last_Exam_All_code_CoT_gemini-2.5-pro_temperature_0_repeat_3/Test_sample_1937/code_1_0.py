# This script identifies the correct options for the puzzle.
# The puzzle centers on a quote by Winston Churchill (Z) about John Foster Dulles (W).
# The quote is "a bull (X) with his own China shop (Y)".
# Churchill's nickname was the "British Bulldog" (XK).
# A pun connects "bulldog" to "bulgogi" (AK), a dish from Korea (G).

# Option A correctly identifies all these elements.
# Option C uses a plausible synonym ("China store") and more specific names
# ("J.F. Dulles", "Goryeo"), making it also a likely correct answer,
# especially with the "Select ALL that apply" instruction.
