    "To solve this problem, we will determine the number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group (Θ³_H) that can be created by performing an integral surgery on a knot with four or fewer crossings.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify Knots**: List all knots with a crossing number of 4 or less. These are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1).\n2.  **Identify Relevant Surgeries**: An integral surgery on a knot K produces a homology 3-sphere if and only if the surgery coefficient is +1 or -1. We will consider these two surgeries for each knot.\n3.  **Analyze Each Knot**:\n    *   For the **unknot (0_1)**, both +1 and -1 surgeries result in the 3-sphere S³, which represents the trivial element in Θ³_H.\n    *   For the **trefoil knot (3_1)**, we must consider both of its chiralities (left-handed and right-handed), as they are distinct knots. These surgeries produce four distinct, non-trivial homology spheres.\n    *   For the **figure-eight knot (4_1)**, which is a slice knot, any homology sphere resulting from surgery is homology cobordant to S³. Thus, it only contributes the trivial element.\n4.  **Count Unique Elements**: We will collect all the resulting homology cobordism elements and count the number of unique ones.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan by encoding these mathematical facts to calculate the total number of distinct elements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homology_cobordism_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements\n    representable by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the number of distinct homology cobordism group elements\")\n    print(\"from integral surgeries on knots with at most four crossings.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # A set to store the unique homology cobordism elements found.\n    # We use descriptive strings to represent the elements.\n    # \"Trivial\" represents the identity element (from S^3).\n    # Other strings represent known non-trivial homology spheres.\n    elements_found = set()\n    \n    # --- Unknot (0_1) ---\n    print(\"1.
