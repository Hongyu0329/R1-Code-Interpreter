def solve_quantum_symmetry_problem():
    """
    This function determines the correct statements about quantum symmetries and prints the final answer.

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    - A: False. The generator of a continuous symmetry, like the momentum operator p̂ for a free particle, has a continuous spectrum.
    - B1: True. This statement connects the generator of scale transformations (τ̂) with a potential of the form V(r) ∝ 1/r². This is a known physical principle for scale-invariant systems. The condition [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 is the mathematical expression of this symmetry. The addendum confirms this is the intended context.
    - B2: False. The generator τ̂ = x̂p̂ + p̂x̂ does not produce the transformation x̂ → e^θx̂, p̂ → e^{-θ}p̂. Direct calculation shows the scaling factors and signs are different.
    - C: False. The condition [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 is both necessary and sufficient for [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0, where Ŝ is the exponential of τ̂.
    - D: True. Given [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 and Ĥ|ψ⟩ = E|ψ⟩, we can show Ĥ(τ̂|ψ⟩) = τ̂Ĥ|ψ⟩ = τ̂(E|ψ⟩) = E(τ̂|ψ⟩). Thus, τ̂|ψ⟩ is an eigenstate with the same energy E.
    - E: True. In units where ħ=1, L̂_z is the generator of rotations about the z-axis, and Ŝ(θ) = e^{-iθL̂_z} is the corresponding rotation operator.
    - F: True. The time evolution of an expectation value is given by d⟨τ̂⟩/dt = (1/iħ)⟨[τ̂, Ĥ]⟩. The expectation value is conserved for all states if and only if the operator [τ̂, Ĥ] is zero.
    - G: True. The premise [Ŝ(θ₁), Ŝ(θ₂)] = 0 is always true for the given form of Ŝ. The statement thus reduces to "τ̂ must be Hermitian". Generators of physical symmetries correspond to unitary transformations, which requires the generator to be Hermitian.
    - H: False. An unbounded operator, such as the Hamiltonian for a quantum harmonic oscillator, can have a discrete spectrum.
    - I: True. According to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, e^A * e^B = e^(A+B) only if [A, B] = 0. Since [τ̂₁, τ̂₂] ≠ 0, the equality does not hold.
    - J: True. Given [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0 and Ĥ|ψ⟩ = E|ψ⟩, we can show Ĥ(Ŝ|ψ⟩) = ŜĤ|ψ⟩ = Ŝ(E|ψ⟩) = E(Ŝ|ψ⟩). Thus, Ŝ|ψ⟩ is an eigenstate with the same energy E.

    The true statements are B1, D, E, F, G, I, J.
    The final answer is the concatenation of these indices in sorted order.
    The index 'B1' contains the number 1, which is included in the final output string.
