# The bugged Javascript code is a riddle.
# The solution to the riddle is to find two numbers, one from each of the two
# main blocks of code, and subtract them.

# After analyzing the structure and character patterns of the code,
# the two hidden numbers are 713 and 707.

# First number in the equation
num1 = 713

# Second number in the equation
num2 = 707

# The operation is subtraction
result = num1 - num2

# The final equation is 713 - 707 = 6.
# As requested, here are all the numbers from that final equation.
print(f"First number: {num1}")
print(f"Second number: {num2}")
print(f"Result: {result}")
