    "This problem requires designing a secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol. A well-regarded and standardized scheme that fits these criteria is **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)**.\n\n### Plan\n\nI will provide a Python script that simulates the FROST protocol. This simulation will demonstrate the core logic without the complexity of a full cryptographic library for elliptic curves. Instead, it will use modular arithmetic over a large prime number, which preserves the mathematical properties of the protocol.\n\nThe simulation will proceed in the following steps:\n1.  **Setup (Simulated DKG)**: We will simulate the outcome of a Distributed Key Generation (DKG). A master secret key `x` will be created and split into `n` shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing. Each of the `n` parties will receive one share. The corresponding single public key `P` for the group will be computed.\n2.  **Signing - Round 1 (Commitment)**: A threshold `t` of the parties will participate in signing. Each participant will generate a secret nonce and broadcast a *commitment* to it. This prevents malicious parties from choosing their values after seeing others' values.\n3.  **Signing - Round 2 (Signing & Aggregation)**: After commitments are exchanged, participants broadcast their actual nonces. Each participant then computes their partial signature. These partial signatures are combined to form the final, complete signature.\n4.  **Verification**: Finally, the script will verify the aggregated signature against the group's public key, demonstrating that the protocol was successful. The final output will display the verification equation with the actual numbers used in the simulation.\n\nThe core of the scheme's security and two-round efficiency comes from the combination of Schnorr's signature properties (which are linear and thus easy to work with in a distributed manner) and the use of a commitment scheme in the first round.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport hashlib\nfrom math import prod\n\ndef design_threshold_signature_scheme():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a 2-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme based on FROST.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Helper function for modular inverse using Python's built-in power function\n    # pow(b, -1, q) is equivalent to b^(q-2) mod q for a prime q\n    def mod_inverse(b, q):\n        return pow(b, -1, q)\n\n    # Helper for a consistent hash function (SHA-256)\n    def H(*args):\n        \"\"\"A simple hash function wrapper.\"\"\"\n        s = \"\".join(map(str, args))\n        return int(hashlib.sha256(s.encode()).hexdigest(), 16)\n\n    # --- Elliptic Curve Simulation (using modulo arithmetic) ---\n    # We use a large prime number (the order of the secp256k1 curve) as our field\n    Q = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663\n    # G is a \"generator point\" on our simulated curve\n    G = 2\n\n    # --- 1.
