# --- Given Parameters ---
# In an LSM tree with 5 levels and a size ratio of 3, the number of entries is 4096.
# The write buffer size is 16KB.

# We need to find the minimum size of an entry in bytes.

# --- Step 1: Define variables from the problem statement ---
# The number of entries is stated as 4096. As analyzed in the thinking steps,
# interpreting this as the number of entries in the write buffer is the only way
# to get a sensible integer result.
num_entries_in_buffer = 4096
write_buffer_size_kb = 16

# --- Step 2: Convert the write buffer size from kilobytes to bytes ---
# 1 KB = 1024 Bytes
write_buffer_size_bytes = write_buffer_size_kb * 1024

# --- Step 3: Calculate the size of a single entry ---
# Entry Size = Total Buffer Size (Bytes) / Number of Entries in Buffer
entry_size_bytes = write_buffer_size_bytes / num_entries_in_buffer

# --- Step 4: Print the explanation and the final equation ---
print("The minimum size of an entry is calculated by dividing the write buffer's size in bytes by the number of entries it contains.")
print(f"First, we convert the buffer size to bytes: {write_buffer_size_kb} KB * 1024 = {write_buffer_size_bytes} Bytes.")
print(f"The number of entries in the buffer is given as {num_entries_in_buffer}.")
print("\nFinal Equation:")
print(f"Entry Size = {write_buffer_size_bytes} (Bytes) / {num_entries_in_buffer} (Entries)")

# --- Step 5: Print the final result ---
# The result should be an integer, as we are dealing with bytes.
print(f"\nThe minimum size of an entry is {int(entry_size_bytes)} bytes.")
