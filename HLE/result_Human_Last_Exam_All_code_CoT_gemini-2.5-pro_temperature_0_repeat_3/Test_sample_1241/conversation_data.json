    "To find the steady-state probabilities $P_{i}(+\\infty)$, which we will denote as $p_i$, we need to solve the system of equations when the derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_{i}'(t) = 0$. This is because, at equilibrium ($t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities are constant.\n\nThe given system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n5.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$ (The normalization condition)\n\nNote that one of the first four equations is redundant (it's a linear combination of the others). We will use equations 1, 3, 4, and 5 to solve for the probabilities $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Use equations 1, 3, and 4 to express $p_0$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ as multiples of $p_1$.\n2.  Substitute these expressions into the normalization equation (5) to solve for the numerical value of $p_1$.\n3.  Calculate the numerical value of $p_0$ using the relationship found in step 1.\n4.  Finally, compute the desired sum $p_0 + p_1$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_steady_state_probabilities():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Kolmogorov-Chepmen system for steady-state probabilities\n    and calculates P0(inf) + P1(inf).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given lambda values\n    lambda_01 = 0.019\n    lambda_10 = 0.65\n    lambda_12 = 0.4\n    lambda_21 = 0.392\n    lambda_23 = 0.008\n    lambda_31 = 0.008\n\n    # At steady state, P_i'(t) = 0.
