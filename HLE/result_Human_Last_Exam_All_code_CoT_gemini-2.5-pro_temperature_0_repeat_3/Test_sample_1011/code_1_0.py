    # The problem asks for the smallest possible number of accumulation points
    # of a set U = {u_1, u_2, ...} in the Stone-Cech remainder N*.

    # Step 1: Finding the lower bound.
    # The Stone-Cech remainder N* is a compact Hausdorff topological space.
    # The set U = {u_1, u_2, ...} is a countably infinite subset of N*.
    # A fundamental theorem in topology states that any infinite subset of a
    # compact space must have at least one accumulation point.
    # Therefore, the number of accumulation points must be at least 1.
    lower_bound = 1

    # Step 2: Showing the lower bound can be achieved.
    # We can achieve exactly one accumulation point if we can construct the
    # sequence of ultrafilters (u_i) to be a "coherent sequence".
    #
    # A sequence of ultrafilters (u_i) is coherent if, for any subset A of N,
    # the set of indices {i | A is in u_i} is either finite or cofinite.
    #
    # If a sequence is coherent, it has exactly one accumulation point, w,
    # which is the limit of the sequence. This limit w is defined by:
    # A is in w if and only if {i | A is in u_i} is cofinite.
    #
    # The final required step is to affirm that it is possible to choose a
    # partition P = {P_1, P_2, ...} and a coherent sequence of non-principal
    # ultrafilters (u_i) such that P_i is in u_i for each i. The existence
    # of such a construction is a known (though non-trivial) result in ZFC set theory.
    #
    # This construction ensures that the number of accumulation points can be exactly 1.
    achievable_number = 1

    # Step 3: Conclusion.
    # From Step 1, the number of accumulation points is >= 1.
    # From Step 2, the number of accumulation points can be made to be exactly 1.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible number of accumulation points is 1.

    final_answer = 1
    
    # The final equation is: min_accumulation_points = 1
    # The number in this equation is 1.
