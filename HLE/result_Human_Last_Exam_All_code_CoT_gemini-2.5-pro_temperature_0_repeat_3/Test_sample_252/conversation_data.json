    "To determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings required for computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS) from a single image, we need to understand how the 3D spectral data cube is encoded onto a 2D sensor.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the Problem:** The goal is to capture a 3D data set, known as a spectral volume or data cube (x, y, Î»), using a single 2D image from a sensor (like a CCD or CMOS).\n2.  **Relate to Computed Tomography (CT):** Standard CT reconstructs a 3D volume from multiple 2D projections taken at different angles. In CTIS, the \"projections\" are not from physical rotation but are different, spectrally-dispersed images of the scene.\n3.  **Role of Diffraction Gratings:** A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits light into its constituent wavelengths (colors). It disperses the light.\n4.  **Analyze the \"1 Grating\" Case:** A single one-dimensional (1D) grating disperses light along a single axis. This creates a series of overlapping, smeared images on the sensor. This is analogous to taking all CT projections from the same direction, which provides insufficient information to uniquely reconstruct the original 3D data cube. There is too much ambiguity.\n5.  **Analyze the \"2 Gratings\" Case:** To get the diverse \"projections\" needed for tomographic reconstruction, we must disperse the light in two dimensions. The simplest way to achieve this is to use two 1D gratings placed orthogonally (at 90 degrees to each other). The first grating disperses the light horizontally, and the second disperses it vertically. This combination creates a 2D grid of dispersed images on the sensor. Each image in the grid represents a unique \"projection\" of the data cube, providing the necessary information for the reconstruction algorithm.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, two gratings are the minimum necessary to create the 2D dispersion required for this technique. This allows for the capture of sufficient information in a single 2D snapshot to reconstruct the full 3D spectral volume.\n\nThe following Python code will articulate this logic and provide the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ctis_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the minimum number of diffraction gratings for CTIS.\n\n    This function explains the reasoning based on the principles of\n    Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the dimensions of the problem.\n    # We want to capture a 3D data cube (2 spatial, 1 spectral) on a 2D sensor.\n    spatial_dims = 2  # (x, y)\n    spectral_dim = 1  # (lambda, wavelength)\n    total_dims_to_capture = spatial_dims + spectral_dim\n\n    sensor_dims = 2  # A standard camera sensor is 2D\n\n    print(f\"Goal: Capture a {total_dims_to_capture}D spectral data cube on a {sensor_dims}D sensor in a single snapshot.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the role of gratings and the issue with using only one.\n    num_gratings_case_1 = 1\n    print(f\"Case 1: Using {num_gratings_case_1} diffraction grating.\")\n    print(\"A single grating disperses light along only one axis.\")\n    print(\"This creates multiple, overlapping 'projections' of the data cube, but they all have the same orientation.\")\n    print(\"This is insufficient information for a tomographic algorithm to uniquely reconstruct the 3D data cube.\")\n    print(\"Result: Fails to provide enough information for reconstruction.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Explain why two gratings are sufficient.\n    num_gratings_case_2 = 2\n    print(f\"Case 2: Using {num_gratings_case_2} diffraction gratings.\")\n    print(\"To enable tomographic reconstruction, we need 'projections' from different angles.\")\n    print(\"In CTIS, this is achieved by dispersing light in two dimensions (e.g., horizontally and vertically).\")\n    print(\"The minimum setup to achieve 2D dispersion is to use two 1D gratings oriented orthogonally (at 90 degrees).\")\n    print(\"This creates a 2D grid of dispersed images on the sensor, providing the necessary diversity of projections for reconstruction.\")\n    print(\"Result: Sufficient for tomographic reconstruction.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: State the final conclusion.\n    minimum_required_gratings = 2\n    print(f\"Conclusion: The minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is {minimum_required_gratings}.\")\n\nsolve_ctis_grating_problem()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
