    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to convert this fraction into its binary representation. The value of a Hackenbush stalk corresponds to a surreal number, and for simple stalks of red and blue pieces, this value is a dyadic rational number whose binary representation maps directly to the sequence of pieces.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Understand the Representation**: In red-blue-Hackenbush, a stalk of pieces represents a number. A red piece corresponds to a '1' in the binary expansion, and a blue piece corresponds to a '0'. The position of the piece determines its value; the first piece has a value of $2^{-1}$, the second $2^{-2}$, and so on.\n2.  **Convert Fraction to Binary**: We will convert the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ to its binary form. Since $16 = 2^4$, the binary representation will have 4 digits after the decimal point.\n3.  **Determine the Pieces**: We will convert the numerator, 13, to a 4-digit binary number. The resulting binary string will tell us the sequence of red ('1') and blue ('0') pieces.\n4.  **Count the Pieces**: The total number of pieces is simply the number of digits in the binary representation after the decimal point.\n5.  **Construct the Equation**: We will show the expansion of $\\frac{13}{16}$ as a sum of fractions with powers of 2 in the denominator, which corresponds to the value of each piece.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan, print the final equation, and state the total number of pieces required.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_pieces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces for a fraction in red-blue-Hackenbush,\n    prints the corresponding equation, and the final count.\n    \"\"\"\n    numerator = 13\n    denominator = 16\n\n    # The number of pieces is the power of 2 in the denominator.\n    # For 16 = 2^4, we need 4 pieces.\n    num_pieces = int(math.log2(denominator))\n\n    # Convert the numerator to its binary string representation,\n    # padded with leading zeros to match the number of pieces.\n    # bin(13) is '0b1101', so we take '1101'.\n    binary_numerator = bin(numerator)[2:].zfill(num_pieces)\n\n    print(f\"The fraction is {numerator}/{denominator}.\")\n    print(\"To find the number of pieces, we express this as a sum of fractions with powers of 2 in the denominator.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to the binary representation of the fraction.\")\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    for i, digit in enumerate(binary_numerator):\n        # The power of 2 for the denominator of the term\n        power = i + 1\n        term_denominator = 2**power\n        \n        # A '1' (red piece) contributes to the value, a '0' (blue piece) does not.\n        term_numerator = int(digit)\n        \n        equation_parts.append(f\"{term_numerator}/{term_denominator}\")\n\n    # Construct and print the final equation\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{numerator}/{denominator} = {equation_str}\")\n\n    # The total number of pieces is the length of the binary representation.\n    total_pieces = len(binary_numerator)\n    print(f\"\\nEach term in the sum represents one piece. Therefore, the total number of pieces needed is {total_pieces}.\")\n\nsolve_hackenbush_pieces()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
