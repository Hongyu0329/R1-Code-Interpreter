    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of triangular faces on the surface of the convex hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Shape:** The \"outer-hull\" of a non-convex polyhedron like the great icosahedron is its convex hull. The vertices of the great icosahedron are the same as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Therefore, its convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Identify the Faces:** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose faces are all equilateral triangles. The problem then becomes: \"How many faces does a regular icosahedron have?\"\n3.  **Use Euler's Formula:** We can derive the number of faces (F) using Euler's formula for convex polyhedra: `V - E + F = 2`, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.\n4.  **Express V and E in terms of F:** For a regular icosahedron:\n    *   Each face is a triangle (3 edges). Since each edge is shared by 2 faces, the total number of edges is `E = 3 * F / 2`.\n    *   At each vertex, 5 triangular faces meet. The total number of vertices is `V = 3 * F / 5`.\n5.  **Solve the Equation:** Substitute the expressions for V and E into Euler's formula and solve for F. The resulting value of F will be the number of triangles.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_triangulation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of triangles on the outer-hull of a great icosahedron\n    by finding the number of faces of its convex hull (a regular icosahedron)\n    using Euler's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is its convex hull, which is a regular icosahedron.\")\n    print(\"The faces of a regular icosahedron are triangles.
