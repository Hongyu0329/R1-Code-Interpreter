    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. This is a problem in algebraic topology, specifically homotopy theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the map and its context:** The map is a specific instance of a more general map $\\Sigma(\\Omega A \\wedge \\Omega B) \\to \\Omega(A \\wedge B)$, where $A=S^4$ and $B=S^6$. This map is known to be part of a homotopy fibration sequence.\n2.  **Use the fibration sequence:** The relevant sequence, established by G.J. Porter, is:\n    $$ \\Omega(A*B) \\to \\Sigma(\\Omega A \\wedge \\Omega B) \\xrightarrow{f} \\Omega(A \\wedge B) $$\n    This means that the homotopy fiber of the map $f$, let's call it $F_f$, is given by $F_f \\simeq \\Omega(A*B)$, where $A*B$ is the join of the spaces $A$ and $B$.\n3.  **Determine the connectivity of the fiber:** A map is defined as being $k$-connected if its homotopy fiber is $(k-1)$-connected. Therefore, we need to calculate the connectivity of $F_f$.\n    *   First, we identify the space $A*B = S^4 * S^6$. The join of two spheres $S^p * S^q$ is homotopy equivalent to a higher-dimensional sphere, $S^{p+q+1}$.\n    *   Next, we find the connectivity of this resulting sphere. The sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected.\n    *   Then, we find the connectivity of the fiber $F_f \\simeq \\Omega(S^{p+q+1})$. The connectivity of a loop space $\\Omega X$ is one less than the connectivity of $X$ (for a simply-connected space $X$).\n4.  **Calculate the map's connectivity:** Once the connectivity of the fiber is known, say $c$, the connectivity of the map is $c+1$.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that follows these steps to calculate the final connectivity value, printing each step of the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the dimensions of the spheres in the problem.\np = 4\nq = 6\n\nprint(f\"We want to find the connectivity of the map f: Sigma(Omega S^{p} wedge Omega S^{q}) -> Omega(S^{p} wedge S^{q}).\")\nprint(\"This map fits into a homotopy fibration sequence where its fiber is Omega(S^p * S^q).\")\nprint(\"The connectivity of the map is determined by the connectivity of its fiber.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the dimension of the join of the two spheres.\n# The join of S^p and S^q is S^(p+q+1).\ndim_join = p + q + 1\nprint(f\"The join of S^{p} and S^{q} is S^({p}+{q}+1) = S^{dim_join}.\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the connectivity of the join sphere.\n# A sphere S^n is (n-1)-connected.\nconn_join_sphere = dim_join - 1\nprint(f\"The sphere S^{dim_join} is ({dim_join}-1) = {conn_join_sphere}-connected.\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the connectivity of the fiber of the map.\n# The fiber is the loop space of the join sphere, Omega(S^dim_join).\n# The connectivity of Omega(X) is one less than the connectivity of X.\nconn_fiber = conn_join_sphere - 1\nprint(f\"The fiber of the map, Omega(S^{dim_join}), is therefore ({conn_join_sphere}-1) = {conn_fiber}-connected.\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the connectivity of the map itself.\n# A map is k-connected if its fiber is (k-1)-connected.\n# So, map_connectivity = fiber_connectivity + 1.\nconn_map = conn_fiber + 1\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"The connectivity of the map is the connectivity of its fiber plus one.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the final connectivity is {conn_fiber} + 1 = {conn_map}.\")\n\n```\n<<<10>>>"
