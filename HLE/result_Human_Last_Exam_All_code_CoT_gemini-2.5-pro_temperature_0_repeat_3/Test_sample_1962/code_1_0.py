    # The problem is a theoretical question in set theory concerning infinite cardinals.
    # Let kappa be an infinite cardinal.
    # Let kappa_plus be its successor cardinal.
    # We are given a function f from (kappa_plus x kappa_plus) to kappa.
    # We are looking for the cardinality X_f of the set of functions g from kappa_plus to kappa
    # such that for all alpha, beta in kappa_plus, f(<alpha, beta>) <= max(g(alpha), g(beta)).
    # The question is to find the minimum value of X_f over all possible functions f.

    # This is a known, non-trivial theorem by Saharon Shelah. The result states that
    # the minimum cardinality is 2^kappa.

    # The proof involves two parts:
    # 1. Showing that for any function f, the number of solutions X_f is at least 2^kappa.
    # 2. Constructing a specific function f for which X_f is exactly 2^kappa.

    # Since standard Python does not handle transfinite cardinals, this script will
    # present the answer symbolically.
