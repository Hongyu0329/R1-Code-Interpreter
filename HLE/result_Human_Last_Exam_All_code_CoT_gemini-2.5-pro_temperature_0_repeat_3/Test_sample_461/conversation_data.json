    "This is a knowledge-based question. I will first identify the creature and then the chemical compound named after it.\n\n1.  **Identify the creature:** The question mentions a creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago. This points directly to dinosaurs, which were wiped out during the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event around 66 million years ago.\n2.  **Identify the chemical:** I need to find a polycyclic hydrocarbon whose name is derived from \"dinosaur\". Searching for chemical compounds named after dinosaurs leads to a specific biomarker.\n3.  **Formulate the answer:** The chemical is a sterane, a type of tetracyclic (four-ring) hydrocarbon, which fits the \"polycyclic hydrocarbon\" description. It is a biomarker found in Mesozoic-era rocks and was named because of its association with the age of dinosaurs.\n4.  **Create the code:** I will write a simple Python script that stores the name of this hydrocarbon in a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\n```python\ndef find_dinosaur_hydrocarbon():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of a polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after a creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The creature is a dinosaur. The polycyclic hydrocarbon is a biomarker\n    # found in rocks from the Mesozoic Era, the age of dinosaurs.\n    hydrocarbon_name = \"Dino-sterane\"\n    \n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature extinct for over 65 million years is: {hydrocarbon_name}\")\n\nfind_dinosaur_hydrocarbon()\n```\n<<<Dino-sterane>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
