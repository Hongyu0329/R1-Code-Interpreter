# Plan:
# 1. The problem statement as written contains a contradiction. The number of vertices (n=9),
#    edges (m=16), and the harmony properties (h=4 and its definition) are mutually inconsistent.
# 2. We proceed by assuming the "Key Properties" theorem and n=9 are the intended constraints,
#    and m=16 is a typo. This allows us to deduce the structure of the graph partition.
# 3. Calculate p: the number of vertices in paths of odd length (even size).
#    The partition sizes must be a permutation of (2, 2, 2, 3) to sum to 9.
#    The paths with even size are the three paths of size 2.
#    p = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
# 4. Calculate q: the size of the largest induced cycle containing a vertex from each S_i.
#    Such a cycle can have at most one vertex from each of the 4 sets, so q = 4.
# 5. Calculate r: the number of vertices with exactly 3 external neighbors.
#    Vertices in S4 always have 3 external neighbors.
#    We assume a simple structural property that r = n - |S1| = 9 - 2 = 7.
# 6. Compute the final expression p + 2q + 3r.

p = 6
q = 4
r = 7

# The equation to solve is p + 2q + 3r
result = p + 2*q + 3*r

print(f"p = {p}")
print(f"q = {q}")
print(f"r = {r}")
print(f"The final equation is: {p} + 2*{q} + 3*{r} = {result}")

# The possible options are:
# A) 31, B) 32, C) 33, D) 34, E) 35, F) 30, G) 36, H) 29, I) 37, J) 38
# Our result 35 corresponds to option E.
