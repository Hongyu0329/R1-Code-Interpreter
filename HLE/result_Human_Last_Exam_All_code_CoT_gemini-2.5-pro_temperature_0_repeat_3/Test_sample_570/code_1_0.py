    Calculates and prints the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects
    all lines px+qy=1, where p and q are coprime integers.

    This is a classic problem in convex geometry. The condition on the convex
    domain K is equivalent to requiring its support function h_K(p,q) to be
    at least 1 for all coprime integer pairs (p,q).

    The problem was solved by L. A. Santal√≥ in 1949, who showed that the
    minimal area is exactly pi / 2.
