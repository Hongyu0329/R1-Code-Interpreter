    # Part a: Bi-degree of the terminal polynomial
    # A starter P with bi-degree (4, 3) is a lowest weight vector (FP=0).
    # Its sl(2) weight is b-a = 3-4 = -1.
    # For a full sl(2) string, the highest weight is -(-1) = 1.
    # The raising operator E increases the weight by 2.
    # The string is P (weight -1), EP (weight 1).
    # The terminal polynomial is EP.
    # The bi-degree of EP is (4-1, 3+1) = (3, 4).

    # Part b: Condition for a string starter
    # A polynomial of bi-degree (a, b) is a starter (lowest weight vector) if a >= b.
    # The problem implies a construction where the x-degree 'a' is determined by b indices r_i.
    # A plausible, but unstated, construction from the theory is a = sum(r_i - 1 for i in 1..b).
    # The condition a >= b becomes sum(r_i - 1) >= b, which simplifies.
    # sum(r_i) - b >= b  =>  sum(r_i) >= 2b.
    # We will represent the sum r_1 + ... + r_b symbolically.

    # Part c: Possibility of a (5, 2) bi-degree polynomial
    # A polynomial of bi-degree (a,b) = (5,2) can be a starter because a >= b (5 >= 2).
    # The existence of such a polynomial in DH_n can be shown by finding a basis element
    # (indexed by a parking function) with this bi-degree.
    # For n=5, the parking function (2,1,2,1,1) has area=2 and dinv=5.
    # The bi-degree of the corresponding basis element is (dinv, area) = (5,2).
    # The operators E_{r,0} for r=1,2 are p_1(Y) and p_2(Y), which are generators
    # for the ring of symmetric polynomials, so they don't restrict the construction.
    # Thus, it is possible.
