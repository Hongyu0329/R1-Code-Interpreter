    # Step 1: Define the problem.
    # We are looking for the largest constant c such that for any n >= 8 points
    # not all on a line, the number of ordinary lines L2 is always >= c*n.
    # This constant c is the infimum of the ratio L2/n over all possible
    # point configurations and all n >= 8.
    # c = inf_{n >= 8} (t_2(n) / n), where t_2(n) is the minimum number of
    # ordinary lines for n points.

    # Step 2: Analyze the configurations that minimize the ratio t_2(n)/n.
    # It is known that for any even number n = 2k (for n >= 6), configurations
    # exist with exactly k ordinary lines. These configurations provide an
    # upper bound on c.

    # Step 3: Calculate the ratio for these "worst-case" configurations.
    # We can use a symbolic representation or a concrete example.
    # Let's use n=8 as an example.
    n = 8
    k = n // 2

    # Step 4: Conclude the value of c.
    # The existence of these configurations for all even n >= 8 means that c cannot be
    # larger than 1/2.
    # Furthermore, it has been established that for all n >= 8, t_2(n)/n is always >= 1/2.
    # Therefore, the greatest lower bound (infimum) is exactly 1/2.
