    "To determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes, we need to understand how the topology of the surface affects the number of logical qubits.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the key concepts:** The ground state degeneracy (GSD) of a topological code like the toric code is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits.\n2.  **Relate logical qubits to topology:** The number of logical qubits `k` depends on the genus `g` of the surface and the number and type of boundaries (holes). The problem describes a surface with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. This is typically understood as punching holes in a sphere, so we assume the genus `g=0`.\n3.  **State the formula for logical qubits:** For a surface of genus `g` with `n` smooth boundaries and `m` rough boundaries, the number of logical qubits `k` is given by the formula:\n    `k = 2g + n + m - c`\n    where `c` is the number of types of boundaries present.\n4.  **Apply the formula to the specific case:**\n    *   We assume genus `g=0`.\n    *   We have `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. We consider the general case where both types of holes exist, meaning `n > 0` and `m > 0`.\n    *   In this case, two types of boundaries (smooth and rough) are present, so `c=2`.\n    *   Substituting these values into the formula gives:\n        `k = 2*0 + n + m - 2 = n + m - 2`\n5.  **Calculate the GSD:** The GSD is `2^k`, which becomes `2^(n + m - 2)`.\n6.  **Match with the answer choices:** This formula corresponds to option B.\n7.  **Create a Python script:** The script will print the final derived formula as a string.\n\n```python\ndef solve_toric_code_gsd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the formula for the ground space degeneracy (GSD)\n    of the toric code on a sphere with n smooth and m rough holes.\n\n    The GSD is 2^k, where k is the number of logical qubits.\n    The formula for k on a surface with genus g, n smooth boundaries,\n    and m rough boundaries is:\n        k = 2*g + n + m - c\n    where c is the number of boundary types present.\n\n    For a sphere, g=0. In the general case with both smooth (n>0) and\n    rough (m>0) holes, there are c=2 types of boundaries.\n    So, k = 2*0 + n + m - 2 = n + m - 2.\n\n    The GSD is therefore 2^(n + m - 2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The formula is derived from topological quantum field theory principles.\n    # The variables n and m represent the number of smooth and rough holes, respectively.\n    base = 2\n    exponent_term_n = \"n\"\n    exponent_term_m = \"m\"\n    exponent_constant = -2\n\n    # We will print the formula as a string.\n    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # The numbers are the base '2' and the constant '-2' in the exponent.\n    print(f\"The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is given by the formula:\")\n    print(f\"GSD = {base}^({exponent_term_n} + {exponent_term_m} - {abs(exponent_constant)})\")\n\nsolve_toric_code_gsd()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
