    This function solves for the number of positive eigenvalues of the given stability operator.

    Based on the theory of minimal surfaces, the stability operator for a catenoid
    is known to have a Morse index of 1. The Morse index corresponds to the number
    of negative eigenvalues of the standard stability operator J. The question asks
    for the number of positive eigenvalues of an operator L, which is conventionally
    related to J by L = -J.

    Therefore, the number of positive eigenvalues of L is equal to the Morse index of the catenoid.
