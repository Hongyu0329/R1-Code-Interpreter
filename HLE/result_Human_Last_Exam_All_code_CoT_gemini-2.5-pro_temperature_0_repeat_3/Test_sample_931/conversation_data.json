    "My plan to answer this question is as follows:\n1.  I will research the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans, which are commonly known as snakeflies.\n2.  I will evaluate each of the given options against the known facts about the snakefly diet.\n3.  Adult snakeflies are primarily predators, feeding on small, soft-bodied insects. Aphids are a classic example of their prey. This makes option E, \"Totara Aphids,\" a correct answer.\n4.  Research also indicates that some adult snakeflies supplement their predatory diet with nectar and pollen to gain energy. This makes option A, \"Nectar,\" also a correct answer.\n5.  Options B, C, and D are incorrect. Snakeflies are not known to be fungivores (C) or herbivores that eat leaf tissue (D). Furthermore, Māhoe (B) is a plant native to New Zealand, where snakeflies are not naturally found.\n6.  Since both A and E are correct, the most comprehensive and accurate choice is F, which combines both.\n7.  I will create a Python script that prints this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_biology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)\n    to determine the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known facts about adult Raphidopteran diet:\n    # 1.

They are also known to feed on nectar and pollen.\n\n    choice_A = \"Nectar\"\n    choice_E = \"Totara Aphids\"\n\n    print(f\"Adult Raphidiopterans have been recorded feeding on soft-bodied insects like aphids.
