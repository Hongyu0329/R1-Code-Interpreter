def solve_hyperbolic_group_questions():
    """
    Solves the theoretical questions about hyperbolic groups based on logical deduction.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    A key insight is that many hyperbolic groups contain torsion elements (elements of finite order).
    A word representing a torsion element cannot be a quasigeodesic, because its powers stay within a bounded
    distance of the identity, violating the definition of a quasigeodesic path. A "fully quasireduced" word
    must be a quasigeodesic, so words for torsion elements are not fully quasireduced.

    Let G be a hyperbolic group with a torsion element t. Consider the set K = {t}.
    This set is finite, making it both a rational and a context-free subset of G.
    The set of conjugates, alpha(K), is the conjugacy class of t, which consists entirely of torsion elements.

    A. Must every geodesic word representing an element in alpha(K) be fully quasireduced if K is rational?
    No. Our set alpha(K) contains the torsion element t. Its geodesic word is not fully quasireduced.

    B. Is there a finite bound for epsilon such that a fully (1, epsilon)-quasireduced word in alpha(K) exists for a rational K?
    No. For our set K = {t}, alpha(K) contains only torsion elements. No word for any of these elements can be
    a quasigeodesic, so a "fully quasireduced word" does not exist for this K. Therefore, no such universal bound can be guaranteed.

    C. Is it true that alpha(K) contains only quasigeodesic words if K is context-free?
    No. Our set K = {t} is context-free. alpha(K) contains t, whose words are not quasigeodesic. Thus, alpha(K)
    does not contain *only* quasigeodesic words.
