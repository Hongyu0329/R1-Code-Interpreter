# Parameters from the problem
alpha = 3.0
beta = 2.0

# The analytical derivation shows that the trace of the covariance matrix
# can be calculated with the formula: 1 - ((alpha - beta) / (alpha + beta))^2.
# The other parameters (d, theta, mu, Sigma, v1, v2) do not affect the final result.

# Step 1: Calculate the numerator of the ratio
numerator = alpha - beta

# Step 2: Calculate the denominator of the ratio
denominator = alpha + beta

# Step 3: Calculate the ratio
ratio = numerator / denominator

# Step 4: Square the ratio
ratio_sq = ratio**2

# Step 5: Subtract from 1 to get the final trace
trace_cov = 1 - ratio_sq

# Print the final equation with all the intermediate numbers
