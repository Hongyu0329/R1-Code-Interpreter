    print("\n- A. Transitivity: This is a fundamental assumption that allows indirect comparisons (e.g., A vs. C through A vs. B and B vs. C). It is necessary, but not sufficient. The analysis could still be invalid due to inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence.")
    print("\n- B. Consistency: This is the requirement that direct and indirect evidence agree. It is a condition that must be checked, not a foundational assumption. If consistency is violated, the NMA is invalid. Therefore, it is a necessary outcome, but not a sufficient initial assumption.")
    print("\n- C. Homogeneity: This assumes that studies within a single comparison (e.g., all A vs. B studies) are similar. While important, the entire network could be invalid due to a lack of transitivity across different comparisons, even if each comparison is internally homogeneous.")
    print("\n- D. Similarity of Effect Modifiers: This is the clinical basis for the transitivity assumption. It is crucial but not sufficient on its own for the same reasons as transitivity; other statistical issues like inconsistency could still invalidate the NMA.")
    print("\n- F. Exchangeability: This is a statistical assumption, often related to random-effects models, that is intertwined with homogeneity and transitivity. It does not, by itself, cover all the requirements for a valid NMA.")
    print("\nConclusion: A valid NMA requires that a set of conditions are met, including transitivity, homogeneity, and consistency. No single assumption is sufficient to guarantee the validity of the entire analysis. A failure in any one of these areas compromises the result.")
