    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the structure of the third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$, for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, and then find its rank. This involves a series of steps using powerful theorems from algebraic geometry and topology.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Apply the Andreotti-Frankel Theorem**: This theorem, a strong version of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for homotopy groups, relates the homotopy groups of a submanifold of complex projective space to the homotopy groups of the ambient space. We will use it to show that $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n2.  **Compute $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$**: We can compute the homotopy groups of complex projective space by using the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated with the Hopf fibration. This will show that $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_3(S^7)$.\n3.  **Identify $\\pi_3(S^7)$**: The group $\\pi_3(S^7)$ is a known stable homotopy group of spheres.\n4.  **Determine the Rank**: Once we know the group structure of $\\pi_3(X)$, we can determine its rank. The rank of a finitely generated abelian group is the size of the largest subset of linearly independent elements of infinite order.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, explaining each step and calculating the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homotopy_group_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic\n    hypersurface in the complex projective space CP^3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the problem parameters\n    # X is a smooth hypersurface in CP^N\n    N = 3\n    # The degree of the hypersurface is d\n    d = 5\n    # We want to find the rank of pi_k(X)\n    k = 3\n    # The complex dimension of X is dim_C_X = N - 1\n    dim_C_X = N - 1\n    # The real dimension of X is dim_R_X = 2 * dim_C_X\n    dim_R_X = 2 * dim_C_X\n\n    print(\"Problem: Find the rank of the third homotopy group, pi_3(X), of a smooth quintic hypersurface X in CP^3.\")\n    print(f\"The ambient space is the complex projective space CP^{N}.\")\n    print(f\"The hypersurface X is defined by a polynomial of degree d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"X is a complex submanifold of complex dimension {dim_C_X} and real dimension {dim_R_X}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the Andreotti-Frankel Theorem\n    print(\"Step 2: Apply the Andreotti-Frankel Theorem.\")\n    print(\"This theorem states that for a smooth complex subvariety Y in CP^N of real dimension m,\")\n    print(\"the inclusion map i: Y -> CP^N induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups pi_j(Y) -> pi_j(CP^N) for j <= m.\")\n    print(f\"In our case, Y = X and its real dimension is m = {dim_R_X}.\")\n    print(f\"We are interested in pi_{k}(X) where k = {k}.\")\n    print(f\"Since {k} <= {dim_R_X}, the theorem implies that the map i*: pi_{k}(X) -> pi_{k}(CP^{N}) is an isomorphism.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, pi_3(X) is isomorphic to pi_3(CP^3).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Compute pi_3(CP^3) using the Hopf fibration\n    print(\"Step 3: Compute pi_3(CP^3).\")\n    print(\"We use the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the Hopf fibration:\")\n    print(f\"S^1 -> S^(2*N+1) -> CP^N\")\n    print(f\"For N = {N}, this is S^1 -> S^7 -> CP^3.\")\n    print(\"The long exact sequence contains the segment:\")\n    print(\"... -> pi_3(S^1) -> pi_3(S^7) -> pi_3(CP^3) -> pi_2(S^1) -> ...\")\n    print(\"For the circle S^1, we know that pi_j(S^1) = 0 for all j >= 2.\")\n    print(\"So, pi_3(S^1) = 0 and pi_2(S^1) = 0.\")\n    print(\"The sequence simplifies to: ... -> 0 -> pi_3(S^7) -> pi_3(CP^3) -> 0 -> ...\")\n    print(\"This implies that pi_3(CP^3) is isomorphic to pi_3(S^7).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: State the value of pi_3(S^7)\n    print(\"Step 4: Determine the group pi_3(S^7).\")\n    print(\"The group pi_3(S^7) is a stable homotopy group of spheres, often denoted pi_3^s.\")\n    print(\"It is a known result in algebraic topology that pi_3^s is the cyclic group of order 24.\")\n    pi_3_S7 = \"Z_24\"\n    print(f\"pi_3(S^7) = {pi_3_S7}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 5: Conclude the structure of pi_3(X) and compute its rank\n    print(\"Step 5: Conclude the structure of pi_3(X) and find its rank.\")\n    print(\"Combining the steps, we have the following isomorphism:\")\n    print(f\"pi_3(X) ~= pi_3(CP^3) ~= pi_3(S^7) ~= {pi_3_S7}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe rank of a finitely generated abelian group is the number of Z factors in its decomposition.\")\n    print(f\"The group pi_3(X) is isomorphic to {pi_3_S7}, the cyclic group of order 24.\")\n    print(\"This is a finite group (a torsion group), so it has no Z (infinite order) factors.\")\n    rank = 0\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"rank(pi_3(X)) = rank({pi_3_S7}) = {rank}\")\n\n    return rank\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_homotopy_group_rank()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
