Problem: What is the minimal number of CCZ gates to synthesize a CCCZ gate without ancilla qubits, using arbitrary single-qubit rotations?

Step-by-step reasoning:

1.  The problem asks for the synthesis of a 4-qubit CCCZ gate from 3-qubit CCZ gates and single-qubit rotations.

2.  A key insight is that the allowed gate set is universal. Since arbitrary single-qubit rotations are allowed, we can use non-diagonal gates like the Hadamard (H) gate.

3.  The Hadamard gate allows us to convert a CCZ gate into a CNOT-controlled-NOT (CCX, or Toffoli) gate, and vice-versa, as they are related by H gates on the target qubit:
    CCX = H * CCZ * H

4.  Therefore, the cost of a CCX gate is one CCZ gate plus single-qubit gates. The problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of CCX gates to synthesize a CCCX gate without ancillas.

5.  This is a known problem in quantum circuit synthesis. While a simple lower bound can be derived using the T-gate count (a measure of non-Clifford complexity), the precise answer comes from established results in the field.

    The T-count equation for the lower bound is:
    - T-count of a single CCZ gate = 7
    - T-count of a single CCCZ gate = 14
    - Minimum gates >= T-count(CCCZ) / T-count(CCZ)
    - Minimum gates >= 14 / 7 = 2

6.  This lower bound of 2 is not tight. More advanced analysis and explicit constructions have shown that the true minimal number is higher. The established result for the ancilla-free synthesis of a CCCX (or C^3-Z) gate requires 4 CCX (or C^2-Z) gates.

Conclusion: The minimal number of CCZ gates required is 4.
