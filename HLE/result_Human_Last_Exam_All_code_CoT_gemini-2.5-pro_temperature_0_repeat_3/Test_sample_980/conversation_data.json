    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the next number in the sequence:\n\n1.  First, I will analyze the provided sequence: `111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124`.\n2.  The sequence does not appear to follow a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. Standard mathematical patterns are not immediately obvious.\n3.  However, the prompt includes a very specific instruction: \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\". This is a strong hint that the solution involves forming an equation.\n4.  The most direct way to form an equation at the end of a sequence is to use its last terms as operands.\n5.  I will hypothesize that the next number is the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence. This is a common pattern in \"find the next number\" puzzles and fits the hint perfectly.\n6.  The last two numbers in the sequence are 36 and 124.\n7.  I will calculate their sum: `36 + 124 = 160`.\n8.  Finally, I will write a Python script that defines these two numbers, calculates their sum, and prints the full equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the plan:\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the next number in the sequence based on the\n    hypothesis that it is the sum of the last two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    sequence = [111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124]\n\n    # The last two numbers in the sequence\n    second_to_last_number = sequence[-2]\n    last_number = sequence[-1]\n\n    # The next number is the sum of the last two\n    next_number = second_to_last_number + last_number\n\n    # Print the equation as requested\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {second_to_last_number} + {last_number} = {next_number}\")\n    print(f\"The next number in the sequence is: {next_number}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<160>>>"
