    # Biotic pressure (from herbivores, parasites) is highest at low latitudes (tropics)
    # and decreases with increasing latitude. This is a primary driver of the
    # "information arms-race".

    # 2. Analyze Alpha (α) Diversity: VOC diversity within a single plant.
    # In response to higher biotic pressure at low latitudes, individual plants
    # are selected to produce a more complex blend of VOCs for more robust defense.

    # 3. Analyze Beta (β) Diversity: VOC diversity among plants at a site.
    # At low latitudes, high variation in VOC profiles among plants creates a
    # "confusing chemical landscape", preventing specialist enemies from spreading easily.
    # This selective pressure for differentiation is weaker at high latitudes.
