# The scientist's name
name = "Max Born"

# Max Born's famous equation is the Born rule, which gives the probability density
# of finding a particle at a given point.
# p = probability density
# Ψ (Psi) = wave function
# The equation is p = |Ψ|^2

# Define the parts of the equation
equation_lhs = "p"
equation_rhs_part1 = "|Ψ|"
exponent = 2

# Print the name and the equation
print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Equation: {equation_lhs} = {equation_rhs_part1}^{exponent}")
