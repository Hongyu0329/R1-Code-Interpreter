    "To determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners, I will focus on the batting Triple Crown, which is the most common definition. This is achieved when a player leads their respective league (American or National) in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI) in the same season.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create two lists containing the names of players who won the Triple Crown in the American League (AL) and the National League (NL). Some players won multiple times, so they will appear more than once.\n2.  Use Python's `set` data structure to get the unique winners from each league.\n3.  Count the number of unique winners in the AL and the NL.\n4.  Add these two counts together to find the total number of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n5.  Print the lists of winners, the calculation, and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef count_mlb_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays the total number of unique players\n    who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data representing each time the batting Triple Crown was won in the AL and NL.\n    # Format: (Player Name, Year)\n    al_wins = [\n        (\"Nap Lajoie\", 1901), (\"Ty Cobb\", 1909), (\"Jimmie Foxx\", 1933),\n        (\"Lou Gehrig\", 1934), (\"Ted Williams\", 1942), (\"Ted Williams\", 1947),\n        (\"Mickey Mantle\", 1956), (\"Frank Robinson\", 1966),\n        (\"Carl Yastrzemski\", 1967), (\"Miguel Cabrera\", 2012)\n    ]\n\n    nl_wins = [\n        (\"Paul Hines\", 1878), (\"Tip O'Neill\", 1887), (\"Hugh Duffy\", 1894),\n        (\"Heinie Zimmerman\", 1912), (\"Rogers Hornsby\", 1922),\n        (\"Rogers Hornsby\", 1925), (\"Chuck Klein\", 1933), (\"Joe Medwick\", 1937)\n    ]\n\n    # Use a set to get the unique player names from each league.\n    al_unique_winners = set(player for player, year in al_wins)\n    nl_unique_winners = set(player for player, year in nl_wins)\n\n    # Count the number of unique winners in each league.\n    num_al_winners = len(al_unique_winners)\n    num_nl_winners = len(nl_unique_winners)\n\n    # Calculate the total number of unique winners.\n    total_unique_winners = num_al_winners + num_nl_winners\n\n    print(\"Calculating the number of unique MLB batting Triple Crown winners.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"There are {num_al_winners} unique winners from the American League.\")\n    print(f\"There are {num_nl_winners} unique winners from the National League.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"The final equation to find the total number of winners is:\")\n    print(f\"{num_al_winners} + {num_nl_winners} = {total_unique_winners}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"In total, there have been {total_unique_winners} unique players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\")\n\ncount_mlb_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
