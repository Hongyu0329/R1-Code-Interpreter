    "Of course. Here is the formula for the fermionic partition function in the imaginary time path integral formalism, along with its essential components.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I will state the main formula for the partition function, `Z`.\n2.  Next, I will define the Euclidean action, `S_E`, which appears in the exponent of the main formula.\n3.  Finally, I will state the crucial anti-periodic boundary condition that the fermionic fields must satisfy.\n4.  I will present these mathematical expressions using a Python script that prints them in a clear, readable format. The numbers `0` and `β` from the formula will be explicitly included in the output.\n\n```python\ndef display_fermionic_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The main formula for the partition function Z\n    partition_function_formula = (\n        \"Z = ∫ Dψ̄Dψ exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])\"\n    )\n\n    # The formula for the Euclidean action S_E\n    # Here, H is the Hamiltonian operator for the system.\n    # The integral is over imaginary time τ from 0 to β, and over d spatial dimensions x.\n    euclidean_action_formula = (\n        \"S_E[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫[from τ=0 to β] dτ ∫ d^d x  ψ̄(x, τ) * (∂/∂τ + H) * ψ(x, τ)\"\n    )\n\n    # The anti-periodic boundary condition for fermionic fields\n    # This is a consequence of the trace over the Fock space of fermions.\n    boundary_condition = (\n        \"Boundary Condition: ψ(x, τ=0) = -ψ(x, τ=β)\"\n    )\n\n    print(\"The formula for the fermionic partition function (Z) in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"1.
