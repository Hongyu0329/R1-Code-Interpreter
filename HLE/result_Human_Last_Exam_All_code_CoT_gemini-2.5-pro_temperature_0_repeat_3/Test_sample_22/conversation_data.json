    "The statement is **True**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **SNP Heritability (h²_snp):** This represents the *theoretical maximum* proportion of the variation in a trait that can be explained by the additive effects of all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) being considered. It is the \"ceiling\" of predictability using a linear model of these SNPs. It's an idealized value representing the total available genetic signal.\n\n2.  **Polygenic Score (PGS) Predictive Ability (R²):** A PGS is a practical tool used for prediction. It is constructed using SNP effect sizes (weights) that are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). Because any real-world GWAS has a finite sample size, these effect size estimates are not perfect; they contain statistical noise or \"estimation error\".\n\n3.  **The Gap between h²_snp and R²:** When the PGS, built with these noisy weights, is applied to a new, independent sample, its predictive ability (measured by R²) will be lower than the theoretical maximum (h²_snp). The noise in the estimated weights degrades the performance of the score. The predictive ability (R²) of a PGS approaches the SNP heritability (h²_snp) as the sample size of the GWAS used to create it gets larger and larger, but for any finite sample size, R² will be less than h²_snp.\n\nThe following Python script simulates this principle. It sets a \"true\" SNP heritability, simulates a GWAS to get noisy effect size estimates, and then calculates the predictive R² of the resulting polygenic score in a new sample, demonstrating that R² < h²_snp.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_pgs_heritability():\n    \"\"\"\n    A simulation to demonstrate that the predictive ability (R^2) of a\n    Polygenic Score (PGS) is lower than the SNP heritability (h_snp^2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
