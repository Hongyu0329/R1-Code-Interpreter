    "My plan is to analyze the provided multiple-choice question about gene duplication. I will create a Python script to systematically evaluate each answer choice based on established principles of molecular evolution.\n\nHere's the step-by-step breakdown of the plan:\n1.  **Define the criteria:** The question asks for a mechanism that explains both the **retention** (why the duplicate gene copy isn't lost) and the **divergence** (how the two copies become different) of genes.\n2.  **Represent the options:** I will store each answer choice along with a brief definition and a score based on how well it meets the criteria. The scoring will be based on:\n    *   Does it explain the **retention** of two functional copies?\n    *   Does it explain their subsequent **divergence**?\n    *   Is it considered a likely or common scenario?\n3.  **Process and score:** The script will iterate through each option, calculate a total score, and explain the reasoning behind the score. This will simulate a logical deduction process.\n4.  **Identify the best answer:** The option with the highest score will be identified as the most likely mechanism.\n5.  **Final Output:** The script will print the analysis and then declare the final, best-fitting answer in the required format.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes mechanisms of duplicate gene retention and divergence to find the best answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n\n    # Each option is evaluated based on key criteria for explaining the fate of duplicate genes.\n    # Scores are assigned for:\n    #   - explains_retention: Does it explain why both copies are kept?\n    #   - explains_divergence: Does it explain how the copies become different?\n    #   - is_primary_mechanism: Is it a direct molecular mechanism for this process?\n    #   - is_likely_preservation_route: Does it provide a high-probability path to avoid immediate loss (pseudogenization)?\n    options = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Gene conversion',\n            'description': 'A process that makes two homologous sequences identical.
