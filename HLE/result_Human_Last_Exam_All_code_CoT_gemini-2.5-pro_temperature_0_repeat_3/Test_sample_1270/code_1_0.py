# The fictitious molecule "mercedesbenzene" can be interpreted as a central
# benzene ring with three phenyl groups attached, resembling the three-pointed star logo.
# This corresponds to the real molecule 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene.

# 1. Define the number of carbons in the central benzene ring.
central_ring_carbons = 6

# 2. Define the number of points on the "star", which corresponds to the number of attached groups.
num_attached_groups = 3

# 3. Define the number of carbons in each attached group (a phenyl group).
carbons_per_group = 6

# 4. Calculate the total number of carbons.
total_carbons = central_ring_carbons + (num_attached_groups * carbons_per_group)

# 5. Print the explanation and the final calculation.
