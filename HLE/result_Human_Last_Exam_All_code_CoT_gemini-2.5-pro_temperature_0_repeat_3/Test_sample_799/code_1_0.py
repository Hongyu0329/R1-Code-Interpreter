    print("This is a known result from geometric measure theory. Here is the explanation:\n")

    print("Step 1: Key Concepts")
    print("----------------------")
    print(" - A Sidon Set 'S' is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are unique.")
    print("   (If x, y, z, w are in S and x+y = z+w, then it must be that {x, y} = {z, w}).")
    print(" - Hausdorff Dimension, dim_H(S), is a way to measure the 'fractal' size of a set S.\n")

    print("Step 2: The Sumset and its Dimension")
    print("------------------------------------")
    print("Let S be a Sidon set within the interval [0, 1].")
    print("The sumset S+S is defined as {x + y | x, y in S}.")
    print("Since S is in [0, 1], the sumset S+S must be in [0, 2].")
    print("A key property of Hausdorff dimension is that any subset of the real line has a dimension of at most 1.")
    print("Therefore, we have the inequality: dim_H(S+S) <= 1.\n")

    print("Step 3: Using the Sidon Property")
    print("--------------------------------")
    print("The dimension of the Cartesian product S x S (a set in the 2D plane) is:")
    print("dim_H(S x S) = dim_H(S) + dim_H(S) = 2 * dim_H(S).\n")
    print("The sumset S+S is a projection of S x S onto a line (via the map f(x,y) = x+y).")
    print("Normally, a projection can decrease dimension. However, because S is a Sidon set, the mapping is essentially one-to-one.")
    print("A major theorem states that for Sidon sets, this projection preserves dimension, meaning:")
    print("dim_H(S+S) = dim_H(S x S).\n")

    print("Step 4: Deriving the Final Equation")
    print("-----------------------------------")
    print("From Step 3, we can substitute to get: dim_H(S+S) = 2 * dim_H(S).")
    print("From Step 2, we know: dim_H(S+S) <= 1.")
    print("\nBy combining these two facts, we arrive at the crucial inequality:")
    
    # Printing the final equation with its components
    two = 2
    one = 1
    print(f"   {two} * dim_H(S) <= {one}")

    print("\nSolving this for dim_H(S) gives us the upper bound:")
    print("   dim_H(S) <= 1/2\n")

    print("Step 5: Conclusion")
    print("------------------")
    print("This shows that the Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in [0, 1] cannot exceed 1/2.")
    print("Furthermore, mathematicians have constructed Sidon sets that achieve this dimension.")
    print("Therefore, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is exactly 1/2.\n")
