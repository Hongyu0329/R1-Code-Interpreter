    "This is a problem that lies at the intersection of fractal geometry and additive combinatorics. The answer cannot be computed by a simple formula but is rather a significant theorem. The Python code below will explain the reasoning step-by-step to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the Terms**: I will start by defining a Sidon set and the concept of Hausdorff dimension.\n2.  **Introduce the Sumset**: I will consider the sumset `S+S` of a Sidon set `S` and establish a basic property of its dimension.\n3.  **Connect the Dimensions**: I will use the defining property of a Sidon set to relate the dimension of the set `S` to the dimension of its sumset `S+S`. This involves the dimension of the Cartesian product `S x S`.\n4.  **Derive the Bound**: By combining the results from the previous steps, I will derive an inequality that puts an upper limit on the Hausdorff dimension of `S`.\n5.  **State the Final Result**: I will state the final answer, which relies on the fact that this theoretical upper bound has been shown to be achievable.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sidon_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the derivation of the maximum Hausdorff dimension\n    for a Sidon set in the interval [0, 1].\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Finding the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in [0, 1].\")\n    print(\"This is a known result from geometric measure theory.
