    "To determine the rarest noble gas on Earth, we need to compare the abundances of all noble gases. The noble gases are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n\nTheir abundance is most easily measured in the atmosphere, which serves as a good proxy for their overall rarity in terrestrial matter. While gases like Argon are relatively common (almost 1% of the atmosphere), others are present in extremely small trace amounts.\n\nOf all the noble gases, Radon (Rn) is by far the rarest. This is because it is radioactive and has a very short half-life (its most stable isotope, ²²²Rn, has a half-life of only 3.8 days). It is only present on Earth because it is continuously generated through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the planet's crust. Its concentration is extremely low and variable.\n\nThe following Python code will identify the rarest gas from a list of their atmospheric abundances and calculate its percentage.\n\n```python\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rarest noble gas based on its atmospheric abundance and calculates its percentage.\n    The year 2002 does not significantly change these natural abundances.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for noble gas abundance in Earth's atmosphere (mole fraction).\n    # Atmospheric abundance is a good proxy for overall terrestrial abundance.\n    noble_gas_abundance = {\n        'Helium': 5.24e-6,\n        'Neon': 1.818e-5,\n        'Argon': 9.34e-3,\n        'Krypton': 1.14e-6,\n        'Xenon': 8.7e-8,\n        'Radon': 6e-18  # Source: Various chemistry resources, represents an average atmospheric mole fraction.\n    }\n\n    # Find the gas with the minimum abundance\n    rarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_abundance, key=noble_gas_abundance.get)\n    min_abundance_fraction = noble_gas_abundance[rarest_gas_name]\n\n    # Convert the fraction to a percentage\n    percentage = min_abundance_fraction * 100\n\n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is {rarest_gas_name}.\")\n    print(\"Its abundance as a percentage is calculated from its mole fraction in the atmosphere.\")\n    print(\"Final Equation:\")\n    # The format string \"{:.1e}\" displays the number in scientific notation with one decimal place.\n    print(f\"{min_abundance_fraction:.1e} (mole fraction) * 100 = {percentage:.1e}%\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_rarest_noble_gas()\n```\n<<<Radon>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
