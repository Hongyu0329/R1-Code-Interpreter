    "To solve this problem, we need to find an approximate analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for small positive $\\epsilon$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the dominant contribution:** For small $\\epsilon$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + g(x)}$ (where $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$) becomes very large when the denominator is close to zero. Since $g(x) \\ge 0$ for $x \\ge 0$, this happens for small values of $x$ where $g(x)$ is also small. This means the main contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the integrand:** Near $x=0$, the function $g(x)$ can be approximated by its term with the lowest power of $x$.\n    $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0} \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$ for small $x$.\n    So, the integral can be approximated as:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\n\n3.  **Simplify the integral:** The integrand is largest near $x=0$ and decreases rapidly as $x$ increases. The contribution from the upper part of the integration range (near $x=15.00$) is negligible compared to the contribution from the region near $x=0$. Therefore, we can extend the upper limit of integration to infinity without introducing a significant error in the leading-order approximation.\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\n\n4.  **Evaluate the integral:** This is a standard integral that can be evaluated analytically. We will use a substitution to solve it. The general form of the solution is $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^p$.\n\n5.  **Perform the substitution:** Let $a = 9.0$ and $n = 5.0$. We have $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + a x^n} dx$.\n    Let $u^n = \\frac{a x^n}{\\epsilon}$, which means $x = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{a})^{1/n} u$.\n    Then $dx = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{a})^{1/n} du$.\n    Substituting these into the integral:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\frac{\\epsilon}{a})^{1/n} du}{\\epsilon + a (\\frac{\\epsilon}{a}) u^n} = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\frac{\\epsilon}{a})^{1/n} du}{\\epsilon(1 + u^n)} = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/n} a^{-1/n}}{\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^n} du$\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx a^{-1/n} \\epsilon^{(1/n) - 1} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^n} du$\n\n6.  **Use the known integral formula:** The definite integral has a well-known value:\n    $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^n} du = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$\n    So, the approximation becomes:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\left( a^{-1/n} \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)} \\right) \\epsilon^{(1-n)/n}$\n\n7.  **Calculate the constants:** We will substitute $a=9.0$ and $n=5.0$ to find the coefficient $C$ and the power $p$.\n    $p = (1 - 5.0) / 5.0 = -4.0/5.0 = -0.8$\n    $C = 9.0^{-1/5.0} \\frac{\\pi/5.0}{\\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$\n\nThe following Python code will calculate the constant $C$ and present the final analytical formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and prints the analytical approximation for the given integral\n    in the small epsilon regime.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The integral is I(epsilon) = integral from 0 to 15 of 1 / (epsilon + g(x)) dx\n    # where g(x) = 9.0 * x**5.0 + 5.0 * x**6.0 + 9.0 * x**8.0\n\n    # For small epsilon, the integral is dominated by the behavior of g(x) near x=0.\n    # We approximate g(x) by its leading term, g(x) ~ a * x**n.\n    a = 9.0\n    n = 5.0\n\n    # The approximation for the integral takes the form: I(epsilon) ~ C * epsilon**p\n    \n    # The power p is determined by the scaling and is given by (1-n)/n.\n    p = (1.0 - n) / n\n\n    # The coefficient C is given by a**(-1/n) * integral_0^inf(1/(1+u**n)du)\n    # The integral part is equal to (pi/n) / sin(pi/n).\n    \n    # Let's calculate the components of C.\n    # First component from the coefficient 'a'\n    term1 = a**(-1.0/n)\n    \n    # Second component from the definite integral\n    term2 = (math.pi / n) / math.sin(math.pi / n)\n    \n    # The final coefficient C\n    C = term1 * term2\n\n    # Now, we print the derivation and the final formula.\n    print(\"The analytical approximation for the integral I(epsilon) for small epsilon is derived as follows:\")\n    print(\"1.
