# This script solves the theoretical physics problem by calculating the required values.

# Part (a): Analysis of the module decomposition.
# The category of modules for L_k(sl_2) at an admissible level k = -2 + 1/p is not semisimple.
# This means V(p) cannot decompose into a direct sum of simple modules.
# However, a decomposition into indecomposable modules does exist.
answer_a = "No; Yes"

# Part (b): Dimension of the top-level.
# The problem defines the top-level of L(p)_n as rho_n, which is the (n+1)-dimensional
# irreducible sl_2-module. The dimension is therefore n+1 by definition.
answer_b = "n+1"

# Part (c): Calculation of the minimal non-zero conformal weight for p=2.
# The conformal weight of the primary state in L(p)_n is h_n = p*n*(n+2)/4.
# The minimal non-zero weight corresponds to n=1. We calculate h_1 for p=2.
p = 2
n = 1
numerator = p * n * (n + 2)
denominator = 4
minimal_conformal_weight = numerator / denominator

# Print the calculation for part (c) showing each number.
print("Calculation for the minimal non-zero conformal weight (part c):")
print(f"The formula for the weight of the primary in L(p)_n is h_n = p*n*(n+2)/4.")

print(f"h_1 = ({p} * {n} * ({n} + 2)) / {denominator} = {numerator} / {denominator} = {minimal_conformal_weight}")
print("-" * 20)
