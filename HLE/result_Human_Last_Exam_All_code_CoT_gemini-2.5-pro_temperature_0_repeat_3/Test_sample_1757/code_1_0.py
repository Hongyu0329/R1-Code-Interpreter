    Calculates the sum described in the problem statement.

    The problem asks for the sum over all natural dimensions d of a ratio.
    The ratio for a given dimension d is:
    Ratio(d) = E[Volume] / E[Average Pairwise Distance]

    E[Volume] = 1 / (d! * 2^d)
    E[Average Pairwise Distance] = (1 + (d-1)*C_dist) / (d+1)
    where C_dist = E[sqrt(x^2+y^2)] for x,y ~ U(-1,1), which is
    (sqrt(2) + asinh(1))/3.

    So, Ratio(d) = (d+1) / (d! * 2^d * (1 + (d-1)*C_dist))
    The final answer is the sum of Ratio(d) for d = 1, 2, 3, ...
