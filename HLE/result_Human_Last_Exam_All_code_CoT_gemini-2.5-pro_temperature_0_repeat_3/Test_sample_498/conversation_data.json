    "This puzzle involves two interleaved sequences. Let's analyze the pattern to find the next letter.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Sequence:** The main sequence `ZXXCVYBN_` can be split into two separate, interleaved sequences:\n    *   Sequence 1 (letters at odd positions): `Z, X, V, B, _`\n    *   Sequence 2 (letters at even positions): `X, C, Y, N`\n2.  **Identify the Core Pattern:** The question asks for the next letter in the overall sequence, which corresponds to the next item in Sequence 1. This sequence is derived from the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard (`Z X C V B N M`).\n3.  **Determine the Rule:** The letters for Sequence 1 are chosen from the keyboard's bottom row by following a simple rule: \"take two, skip one\".\n    *   Take `Z` and `X`.\n    *   Skip `C`.\n    *   Take `V` and `B`.\n    *   Skip `N`.\n4.  **Find the Next Letter:** By continuing this pattern, the next letter to take after skipping `N` is `M`.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will demonstrate this logic by defining the keyboard row and applying the \"take two, skip one\" rule to find and print the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_letter():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the letter sequence puzzle by identifying an\n    interleaved pattern based on the QWERTY keyboard layout.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The original sequence contains two interleaved sequences.\n    # Sequence 1: Z, X, V, B, _\n    # Sequence 2: X, C, Y, N\n    # The task is to find the next letter in Sequence 1.\n\n    # The pattern for Sequence 1 is based on the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard.\n    keyboard_bottom_row = \"ZXCVBNM\"\n\n    print(\"The pattern is based on the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard: Z X C V B N M\")\n    print(\"The rule is: Take two letters, then skip one letter.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Applying the rule to find the sequence\n    # 1.
