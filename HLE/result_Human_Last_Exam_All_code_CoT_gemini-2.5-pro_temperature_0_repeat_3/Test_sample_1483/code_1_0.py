def solve_continuum_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the mathematical problem about continua.
    
    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the collection of 
    regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

    Based on theorems and constructions from continuum theory, the reasoning is as follows:
    1. A decomposable continuum must have at least one regular proper subcontinuum.
    2. A known theorem states that it must, in fact, have at least two.
    3. An example can be constructed (by joining two indecomposable continua at a point) 
       that has exactly two regular proper subcontinua.

    Combining these facts, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.
