    "Of course, I can help with that. The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a basis set depends on the specific atom. I will explain the calculation for different types of atoms and provide a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name:** I'll break down what each part of `6-311G**` means in terms of primitive and contracted functions.\n2.  **Atom-Dependent Calculation:** I'll explain how the rules apply differently to Hydrogen, 2nd-row heavy atoms (like Carbon or Oxygen), and 3rd-row heavy atoms (like Silicon).\n3.  **Python Script:** I will provide a Python script that calculates the number of primitive Gaussians for these representative atoms (H, C, O, Si).\n4.  **Example Molecule:** The script will also calculate the total number of primitives for a water molecule (H₂O) as a practical example.\n\n### Explanation of 6-311G**\n\n*   **6-**: This describes the core electrons. Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted function, which is a sum of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **-311G**: This describes the valence electrons. The \"G\" stands for Gaussian. The valence shell is split into three functions (a triple-zeta basis set):\n    *   The first function is a contraction of **3** primitives.\n    *   The second function is a single uncontracted primitive (**1**).\n    *   The third function is also a single uncontracted primitive (**1**).\n*   **\\*\\*** (or G-star-star): These are polarization functions added to improve the description of chemical bonding.\n    *   The first `*` adds a set of d-type polarization functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. A standard set consists of **6** Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   The second `*` adds a set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms. This set consists of **3** p-functions (p_x, p_y, p_z).\n\nNow, let's apply these rules with the following Python script.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_primitives(symbol):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Gaussian functions for a given atom\n    in the 6-311G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for elements up to Argon\n    element_data = {\n        'H':  {'period': 1}, 'He': {'period': 1},\n        'Li': {'period': 2}, 'Be': {'period': 2}, 'B':  {'period': 2},\n        'C':  {'period': 2}, 'N':  {'period': 2}, 'O':  {'period': 2},\n        'F':  {'period': 2}, 'Ne': {'period': 2},\n        'Na': {'period': 3}, 'Mg': {'period': 3}, 'Al': {'period': 3},\n        'Si': {'period': 3}, 'P':  {'period': 3}, 'S':  {'period': 3},\n        'Cl': {'period': 3}, 'Ar': {'period': 3},\n    }\n\n    if symbol not in element_data:\n        print(f\"Data for element {symbol} is not available in this script.\")\n        return None\n\n    period = element_data[symbol]['period']\n    total = 0\n\n    print(f\"--- Calculation for {symbol} in 6-311G** ---\")\n\n    # Case 1: Hydrogen\n    if symbol == 'H':\n        # Valence 1s orbital is split into 3, 1, 1\n        s_primitives = 3 + 1 + 1\n        # Polarization p-functions are added by the second '*'\n        p_pol_primitives = 3\n        total = s_primitives + p_pol_primitives\n        print(f\"Valence (1s): 3 + 1 + 1 = {s_primitives} primitives\")\n        print(f\"Polarization (p): {p_pol_primitives} primitives\")\n        print(f\"Total for {symbol}: {s_primitives} + {p_pol_primitives} = {total} primitives\\n\")\n        return total\n\n    # Case 2: Heavy atoms (non-Hydrogen)\n    core_primitives = 0\n    if period == 2:  # 2nd Row: Li - Ne\n        # Core is the 1s orbital, described by 6 primitives\n        core_primitives = 6\n        print(f\"Core (1s): {core_primitives} primitives\")\n    elif period == 3:  # 3rd Row: Na - Ar\n        # Core is 1s, 2s, 2p orbitals.
