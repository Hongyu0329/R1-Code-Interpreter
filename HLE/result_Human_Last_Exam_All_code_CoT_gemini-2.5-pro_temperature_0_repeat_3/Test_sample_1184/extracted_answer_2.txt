Analysis of Human Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel Subunit Interaction
Protein: Beta-1 Subunit (CACNB1) interacting with Alpha-1 Subunit (Cav2.3/CACNA1E)
================================================================================


1) Hotspots for Interaction (Binding to Alpha-1 Subunit):
------------------------------------------------------------
Residue(s): Y216
  Function: Tyrosine at position 216. Forms crucial hydrogen bonds and
            hydrophobic contacts within the binding pocket.
------------------------------------------------------------
Residue(s): L220
  Function: Leucine at position 220. A key hydrophobic residue that contributes
            to the core of the binding groove.
------------------------------------------------------------
Residue(s): V223
  Function: Valine at position 223. Contributes to the hydrophobic surface area
            for a tight alpha-1/beta-1 interaction.
------------------------------------------------------------
Residue(s): L261
  Function: Leucine at position 261. Another important hydrophobic residue
            lining the binding pocket.
------------------------------------------------------------
Residue(s): I284
  Function: Isoleucine at position 284. Lines the hydrophobic pocket,
            stabilizing the complex.
------------------------------------------------------------
Residue(s): M288
  Function: Methionine at position 288. Contributes to the hydrophobic nature
            of the binding interface.
------------------------------------------------------------
Residue(s): W342
  Function: Tryptophan at position 342. A critical anchor residue that forms
            extensive hydrophobic interactions at the base of the pocket.
------------------------------------------------------------


2) Hotspots for Gating Modulation (Fine-tuning Alpha-1 Subunit):
------------------------------------------------------------
Residue/Region: C3 & C4
  Function: Cysteine residues at positions 3 and 4. Located in the N-terminus,
            their post-translational modification (palmitoylation) is critical
            for membrane targeting and fine-tuning the gating properties of the
            Cav2.3 channel.
------------------------------------------------------------
Residue/Region: N-terminal Domain (approx. 1-70)
  Function: This entire domain is a key modulator. It directly influences the
            voltage-dependence of activation and the rate of channel
            inactivation.
------------------------------------------------------------
Residue/Region: SH3-GK Linker (approx. 168-212)
  Function: This is a variable region connecting the two main domains. Its
            length and composition, which differ between splice variants,
            significantly impact the kinetics of channel inactivation.
