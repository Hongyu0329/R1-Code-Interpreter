    "My plan is to first determine the specific protein involved in the process described. This involves understanding the biological pathway of amyloid clearance by macrophages. The key is identifying a protein that must be cleaved or \"broken down\" to initiate this process. Once I have identified the protein, I will create a simple Python script to present this information, as requested by the prompt format. The script will store the name of the protein and a description of its function in variables and then print a clear, explanatory sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the role of a key protein in macrophage-mediated amyloid clearance.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The protein in question is a central component of the complement system.\n    protein_name = \"Complement component 3 (C3)\"\n\n    # The process it undergoes is cleavage, or being \"broken down\".\n    process = \"cleaved into fragments like C3b and its derivative iC3b\"\n\n    # This process enables the engulfment of amyloid.\n    mechanism = \"These fragments act as opsonins, coating the surface of amyloid deposits. Macrophages have receptors that recognize these fragments, triggering phagocytosis (engulfment).\"\n\n    # Print the final answer in a descriptive sentence.\n    print(f\"The protein that, when broken down, allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is {protein_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Specifically, {protein_name} is {process}.\")\n    print(f\"Mechanism: {mechanism}\")\n\nfind_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment()\n```\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
