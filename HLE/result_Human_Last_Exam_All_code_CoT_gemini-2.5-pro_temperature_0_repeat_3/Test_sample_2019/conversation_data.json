    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to place 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Board and Attacks:**\n    *   The board is a 5x5 grid.\n    *   \"Toroidal\" means the edges wrap around. For example, row 0 is adjacent to row 4, and column 0 is adjacent to column 4.\n    *   Two queens are \"non-attacking\" if they are not in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n    *   On a toroidal board, the diagonal attack condition is best expressed using modular arithmetic. Two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` on an `N x N` board attack each other diagonally if `(r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N` or `(r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N`.\n\n2.  **Algorithm: Backtracking Search**\n    *   The problem can be solved by systematically exploring all possible placements of 4 queens and counting the valid ones. A backtracking algorithm is perfect for this.\n    *   We will represent the board as a 5x5 grid and try to place queens one by one.\n    *   To avoid counting the same set of 4 queens in different orders (permutations), we will iterate through the 25 squares in a fixed order (from square 0 to 24). When we place a queen, the next queen can only be placed on a square with a higher index. This ensures we only count unique combinations of squares.\n\n3.  **Implementation Details:**\n    *   We'll create a recursive function, let's call it `count_placements(k, start_index, placed_queens)`.\n    *   `k`: The number of queens we still need to place.\n    *   `start_index`: The linear index of the square (0-24) from which to start searching for the next placement.\n    *   `placed_queens`: A list of coordinates `(r, c)` where queens have already been placed.\n    *   The function will have a base case: if `k` is 0, it means we have successfully placed all 4 queens, so we've found one valid arrangement and return 1.\n    *   In the recursive step, the function will loop from `start_index` to 24. For each square, it checks if placing a queen there is \"safe\" (i.e., it doesn't attack any of the `placed_queens`).\n    *   If the placement is safe, it adds the new queen's position to the list and makes a recursive call to place the next queen (`k-1`).\n    *   The sum of the results from these recursive calls will be the total count.\n\nThis method will systematically check all combinations and find the exact number of ways.\n\n```python\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    BOARD_SIZE = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n\n    def is_safe(r2, c2, placed_queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if placing a new queen at (r2, c2) is safe with respect to the already placed queens.\n        A placement is safe if the new queen is not on the same row, column, or toroidal diagonal\n        as any existing queen.\n        \"\"\"\n        for r1, c1 in placed_queens:\n            # Check for row or column attack\n            if r1 == r2 or c1 == c2:\n                return False\n            # Check for toroidal diagonal attacks using modular arithmetic\n            # Main diagonals: (r1 - c1) mod N == (r2 - c2) mod N\n            if (r1 - c1) % BOARD_SIZE == (r2 - c2) % BOARD_SIZE:\n                return False\n            # Anti-diagonals: (r1 + c1) mod N == (r2 + c2) mod N\n            if (r1 + c1) % BOARD_SIZE == (r2 + c2) % BOARD_SIZE:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def count_placements(k, start_index, placed_queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts valid queen placements using backtracking.\n\n        :param k: The number of queens remaining to be placed.\n        :param start_index: The linear index on the board to start searching from.
