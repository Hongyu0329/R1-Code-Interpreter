    "To find a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles of the $9_{23}$ knot, we will use its HOMFLY polynomial, denoted as $P(a, z)$. There is a well-known inequality that connects the polynomial to the minimum number of Seifert circles, $s(K)$:\n\n$s(K) \\ge \\frac{\\text{span}_z(P)}{2} + 1$\n\nHere, $\\text{span}_z(P)$ is the difference between the maximum and minimum degrees of the variable $z$ in the HOMFLY polynomial.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Use the `spherogram` Python library to obtain the HOMFLY polynomial for the knot $9_{23}$.\n2.  From the resulting polynomial, identify all the powers of the variable $z$.\n3.  Determine the maximum and minimum of these powers.\n4.  Calculate the span: $\\text{span}_z(P) = \\text{max\\_degree}(z) - \\text{min\\_degree}(z)$.\n5.  Substitute the span into the inequality to compute the lower bound for $s(K)$.\n6.  Print the steps of the calculation and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport spherogram\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_knot_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles\n    for the 9_23 knot using its HOMFLY polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.
