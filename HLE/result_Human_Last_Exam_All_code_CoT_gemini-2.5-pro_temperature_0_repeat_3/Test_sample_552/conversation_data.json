    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, \"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Albert Einstein did not formally cite any specific lectures. The paper is well-known for its lack of citations to contemporary scientific literature.\n\nHowever, his work was deeply influenced by the principles of statistical mechanics developed by Ludwig Boltzmann, whose major work on the subject was published under the title *Lectures on Gas Theory*. So, while not a direct citation in the paper, the ideas from Ludwig Boltzmann's work were the most relevant influence.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
