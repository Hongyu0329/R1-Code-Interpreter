    This function determines the necessary assumption for a Bayesian agent's
    expected information gain to approach zero and formats the answer in
    Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).

    The analysis shows that the total expected information gain is bounded by the
    entropy of the prior distribution. For the sum of expected information gains
    to converge (which implies its terms must go to zero), the prior's entropy
    must be finite. This makes option 'a' the only necessary assumption.

    The answer 'a' is then formatted into CNF as [(a)].
