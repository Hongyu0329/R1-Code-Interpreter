    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagrams:** First, I will identify all the unique (topologically distinct) connected vacuum bubble diagrams at the second order for a $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory. A second-order diagram has two vertices, and in $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex has four lines (fields). I've determined there are two such diagrams:\n    *   **The \"Setting-Sun\" Diagram:** The two vertices are connected to each other by four propagators.\n    *   **The \"Figure-Eight\" Diagram:** Each vertex has one self-loop (a propagator starting and ending at the same vertex), and the two vertices are connected by two propagators.\n\n2.  **Calculate Symmetry Factors:** For each diagram, I will calculate its symmetry factor, denoted by $S$. The symmetry factor is a crucial correction that accounts for identical particles, fields, and vertices, preventing overcounting in calculations. I will use the combinatorial method, which is derived directly from the Wick expansion of the path integral. The formula is:\n    $S = \\frac{V! \\times (n!)^V}{C}$\n    *   $V$ is the number of vertices in the diagram (here, $V=2$).\n    *   $n$ is the number of fields in the interaction term (here, $n=4$ for $\\phi^4$).\n    *   $C$ is the combinatorial factor, which is the number of ways to form the specific diagram by contracting the fields from the vertices.\n\n3.  **Sum the Factors:** Finally, I will sum the symmetry factors of all the identified diagrams to get the total.\n\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out the steps, the individual symmetry factors, and the final sum in the required format.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef combinations(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function to calculate the number of combinations (n choose k).\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < 0 or k > n:\n        return 0\n    return math.factorial(n) // (math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(n - k))\n\n# --- Introduction ---\nprint(\"This script calculates the symmetry factors for the two second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 theory and sums them.\")\nprint(\"The symmetry factor S is calculated using the formula: S = (V! * (n!)^V) / C\")\nprint(\"Here, V=2 (vertices), n=4 (from phi^4), and C is the number of ways to form the diagram's contractions.\\n\")\n\n# --- Diagram 1: The \"Setting-Sun\" Diagram ---\nprint(\"1. The 'Setting-Sun' Diagram (4 propagators between 2 vertices)\")\n\n# Number of contractions (C_sun):\n# This is the number of ways to connect the 4 legs of vertex 1 to the 4 legs of vertex 2.\n# This is equivalent to the number of permutations of the 4 legs on one side, which is 4!.\nc_sun = math.factorial(4)\n\n# Symmetry factor (S_sun):\nV = 2\nn = 4\ns_sun = (math.factorial(V) * (math.factorial(n))**V) / c_sun\n\nprint(f\"   - Number of ways to form (C_sun): 4! = {c_sun}\")\nprint(f\"   - Symmetry factor (S_sun): (2! * (4!)^2) / {c_sun} = {int(s_sun)}\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Diagram 2: The \"Figure-Eight\" Diagram ---\nprint(\"2. The 'Figure-Eight' Diagram (1 loop on each vertex, 2 propagators between them)\")\n\n# Number of contractions (C_fig8):\n# Ways to form a loop on vertex 1: C(4, 2)\n# Ways to form a loop on vertex 2: C(4, 2)\n# Ways to connect the remaining 2 legs from vertex 1 to vertex 2: 2\nc42 = combinations(4, 2)\nc_fig8 = c42 * c42 * 2\n\n# Symmetry factor (S_fig8):\ns_fig8 = (math.factorial(V) * (math.factorial(n))**V) / c_fig8\n\nprint(f\"   - Number of ways to form (C_fig8): C(4,2) * C(4,2) * 2 = {c42} * {c42} * 2 = {c_fig8}\")\nprint(f\"   - Symmetry factor (S_fig8): (2! * (4!)^2) / {c_fig8} = {int(s_fig8)}\\n\")\n\n\n# --- Final Summation ---\nprint(\"--- Total Sum ---\")\ntotal_s = s_sun + s_fig8\n# The final equation is printed below as requested.\nprint(f\"{int(s_sun)} + {int(s_fig8)} = {int(total_s)}\")\n<<<64>>>\n```"
