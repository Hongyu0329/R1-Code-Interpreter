    "In the context of the representation theory of posets, a functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is considered $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$.\n\nAn upper semilattice $J$ is a partially ordered set (poset). A functor from a poset (viewed as a category) to the category of vector spaces, $\\text{Vect}_K$, is also known as a representation of the poset.\n\nThe key properties to determine the value of $n$ are:\n\n1.  **Tame Functor**: A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is called tame if it is determined by a finite amount of information. More formally, a functor is tame if it is the left Kan extension of a functor $g: I \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $I$ is a finite subposet of $J$. This means the homological properties of $f$ are inherited from the properties of functors on the finite poset $I$.\n\n2.  **Category of Representations of a Finite Poset**: The category of functors from a finite poset $I$ to $\\text{Vect}_K$, denoted $\\text{Fun}(I, \\text{Vect}_K)$, is equivalent to the category of modules over the incidence algebra of the poset, $KI$.\n\n3.  **Hereditary Algebras**: Since $I$ is a poset, its associated quiver (a directed graph representing the order relations) has no oriented cycles. An algebra whose underlying quiver has no oriented cycles is a hereditary algebra. This means the incidence algebra $KI$ is hereditary.\n\n4.  **Homological Dimension**: A key property of a hereditary abelian category is that the extension functor $\\text{Ext}^2$ is always zero. This implies that any object in the category has a projective resolution of length at most 1. Consequently, the global homological dimension of $\\text{Fun}(I, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is at most 1.\n\nTherefore, any functor $g: I \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ on a finite poset has a projective dimension of at most 1. Since the tame functor $f$ inherits its essential homological properties from such a $g$, it also has a projective dimension of at most 1.\n\nThe condition that $J$ is an upper semilattice ensures that the category of tame functors, $\\text{tame}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, is a well-behaved abelian category where every object admits a minimal free resolution. The length of this resolution is bounded as established above.\n\nThus, a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is 1-resolvable.\n\n<<<1>>>"
