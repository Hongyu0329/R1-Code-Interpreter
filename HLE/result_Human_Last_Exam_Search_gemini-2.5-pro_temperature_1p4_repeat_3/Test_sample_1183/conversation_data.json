    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a type of dehydrobenzoannulene. These molecules are known for their unique electronic and structural properties, often exhibiting high symmetry.\n\nBased on its structure, the molecule possesses the following symmetry elements:\n*   A principal three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. This means the molecule appears unchanged after a 120-degree rotation.\n*   Three two-fold axes of rotation (C₂) that lie in the plane of the molecule.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) that coincides with the plane of the molecule.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σᵥ) that each contain the principal C₃ axis.\n*   An improper three-fold rotation axis (S₃).\n\nA molecule that contains a C₃ axis and a perpendicular C₂ axis belongs to the D₃ point group family. The presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) further classifies this molecule into the **D₃ₕ** point group. The D₃ₕ point group is characterized by a high degree of symmetry.\n\n<<<D₃ₕ>>>"
