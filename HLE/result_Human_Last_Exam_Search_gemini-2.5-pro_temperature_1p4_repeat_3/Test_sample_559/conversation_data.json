    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates regions of different qualitative behavior, and it is often associated with the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe are interested in the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\n\n**1. Find Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe set $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find the equilibrium values for $u$ are $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3(0)+5(0)^2)d - 0(1-0)(0)^2 = 2d^2$.\n    Setting $d'(t)=0$ gives $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$.\n    Thus, an equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 2d^2 + 2d$.\n    Setting $d'(t)=0$ gives $2d^2+2d=0$, which factors to $2d(d+1)=0$. The solutions are $d=0$ and $d=-1$.\n    Thus, we have two more equilibrium points: **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the upper half-plane are (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow we evaluate the Jacobian at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & -3(0) + 10(0)(1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, (0, 1) is an **unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & -3(-1) + 10(-1)(1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since they have opposite signs, (-1, 1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    The linearization is inconclusive, indicating a degenerate equilibrium.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nSeparatrices are typically the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points. We have a saddle point at (-1, 1). Let's look for a special trajectory (invariant manifold) that connects any of the equilibria.\n\nConsider the curve defined by the equation **$d = -u^2$**. Let's check if this curve represents a trajectory of the system. We can do this by showing that if $d(t) = -u(t)^2$, the system of differential equations is satisfied.\n\nIf $d = -u^2$, then taking the time derivative gives $d' = -2u \\cdot u'$.\nWe know that $u' = (u-1)u^2 = u^3 - u^2$.\nSo, $d' = -2u(u^3 - u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nNow we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the first differential equation of the system:\n$d' = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u(1-u)u^2$\n$d' = 2u^4 + (3u^3 - 5u^4) - (u^3 - u^4)$\n$d' = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$\n$d' = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3$\n$d' = -2u^4 + 2u^3$\n\nSince both methods of calculating $d'$ yield the same result, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold, meaning it is a trajectory of the system.\n\nLet's examine the endpoints of this trajectory in the phase plane:\n*   When $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. This corresponds to the saddle point **(-1, 1)**.\n*   When $u=0$, $d = -(0)^2 = 0$. This corresponds to the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\nThe curve $d = -u^2$ is a heteroclinic orbit connecting the saddle point (-1, 1) to the degenerate equilibrium (0, 0). Such a trajectory, which is the unstable manifold of the saddle point, acts as a separatrix. It divides the phase plane into regions where trajectories have different long-term behaviors. For this system, it can be shown that trajectories starting on one side of this curve will eventually go to the origin, while trajectories on the other side escape to infinity.\n\nTherefore, the separatrix of the system on the upper half-plane is the parabolic curve $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<The separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
