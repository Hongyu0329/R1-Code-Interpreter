    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's fate is sealed by boarding a bus after saying \"Thank you\" is a scenario that does not appear to directly match the plot of any specific, well-known Oscar-nominated film based on available information.\n\nIt is possible that the user is recalling a scene with some variations in the dialogue or context, or perhaps the film was not an Oscar nominee. However, there are a few Oscar-nominated films with memorable and pivotal bus scenes that involve themes of fate and life-altering decisions:\n\n*   **Midnight Cowboy (1969):** This film, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, features a poignant and tragic bus scene at its conclusion. The character of Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) dies on a bus to Miami, a destination he longed to reach. While the specific line \"Thank you\" as a precursor to his doom isn't present, the bus journey itself is the final, fateful setting of his life.\n\n*   **Incendies (2010):** A nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, this Canadian drama includes a harrowing and pivotal bus scene that dramatically alters the course of the protagonist's life and sets in motion the central mystery of the film.\n\n*   **Speed (1994):** While a more action-oriented film, *Speed* did win two Academy Awards. The plot famously revolves around a bus that is rigged with a bomb, making any act of boarding or being on the bus a potentially fatal decision for its characters.\n\nIt is also conceivable that the scene in question belongs to a film that was not Oscar-nominated, such as the thriller *Final Destination* (2000), where characters' fates are sealed by seemingly innocuous choices and a character is famously killed by a bus. Similarly, the film *Get on the Bus* (1996), directed by Spike Lee, involves a cross-country bus journey where one of the characters dies.\n\nWithout a precise match to the described scene in an Oscar-nominated film, it's possible the user is conflating elements from different movies or recalling a less widely-known film.\n\n<<<The film you are looking for does not appear to directly match the plot of any known Oscar-nominated film.>>>"
