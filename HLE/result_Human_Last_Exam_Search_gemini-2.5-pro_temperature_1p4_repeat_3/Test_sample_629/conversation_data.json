    "The left-hand trefoil knot has two minimal grid diagrams, up to translation and rotation.\n\nThe trefoil knot, noted as 3‚ÇÅ in Alexander-Briggs notation, is the simplest non-trivial knot and the only knot with a crossing number of three. It is chiral, meaning it cannot be transformed into its mirror image, which results in two distinct forms: the left-handed and the right-handed trefoil knot.\n\nA grid diagram is a method for representing a knot on a square grid. The minimal size of this grid required to represent a specific knot is known as its grid number. For the trefoil knot, the minimal grid number is 3. The task is to determine how many distinct 3x3 grid diagrams exist for the left-handed version when considering diagrams that can be transformed into one another through rotation or translation as identical.\n\nResearch in knot theory has shown that there are two such minimal grid diagrams for the right-handed trefoil knot and, similarly, two minimal grid diagrams for the left-handed trefoil knot. These diagrams are distinct from each other under the operations of translation and rotation.\n\n<<<B>>>"
