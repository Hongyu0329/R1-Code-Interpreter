    "### Overturning a Reverse Turn: A Technical Impossibility in the Viennese Waltz\n\nIn the world of ballroom dancing, the Viennese Waltz stands out for a unique technical constraint: it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without fundamentally disregarding the dance's established technique. This is primarily due to the specific footwork and the rapid tempo that define this elegant and historic dance.\n\nThe reverse turn in the Viennese Waltz is characterized by the crossing of the feet on the third step. This action, performed at a high speed, is crucial to the authentic execution of the figure. Attempting to add more rotation than the standard amount—a practice known as overturning—clashes with the mechanics of this crossing step. The continuous, gliding motion that is a hallmark of the Viennese Waltz would be compromised, and the rapid pace makes any deviation from the prescribed technique both difficult and disruptive to the dance's flow.\n\nDancers typically use the reverse turn to travel down the long sides of the ballroom. When approaching a corner, where more turn is required to change direction, dancers will switch to a natural turn. The natural turn, which involves closing the feet instead of crossing them, can be more easily under-turned to navigate the corner smoothly. This highlights the inherent difficulty and technical incorrectness of trying to force extra rotation into a reverse turn.\n\nIn contrast, while not always desirable or easy, overturning a reverse turn is technically feasible in the other major ballroom dances without violating their core principles. For instance:\n\n*   In the **English Waltz**, the slower tempo and more pronounced rise and fall allow for greater flexibility in the amount of turn.\n*   In the **European Tango**, while overturning a reverse turn can lead to an entirely different figure like a Fallaway, the action itself is not considered technically impossible.\n*   The **Slow Foxtrot** and **Quickstep** also feature reverse turns that can be modified. Variations like the \"overturned Progressive Chassé\" in Quickstep are even part of the dance's vocabulary, demonstrating that altering the degree of turn is an accepted practice.\n\nTherefore, the specific combination of high speed and the essential crossing action of the feet makes the Viennese Waltz the only dance on the list where overturning a reverse turn constitutes a direct disregard for its fundamental technique.\n\n<<<A>>>"
