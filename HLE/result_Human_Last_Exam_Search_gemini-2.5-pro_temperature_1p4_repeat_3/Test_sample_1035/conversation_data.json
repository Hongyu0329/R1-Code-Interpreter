    "The question asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that covers all edges of the complete graph K_35. The phrasing \"number of vertices in a family\" is ambiguous. It could mean the total number of vertices counted with multiplicity across all bipartite graphs in the family (the capacity), or the number of distinct vertices (which would be 35), or it could be a misphrasing for the number of bipartite graphs in the family.\n\nGiven the common problems in this area of graph theory, the most likely interpretation is that the question is asking for the \"biclique covering number\", which is the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all edges of K_n. This is a well-known result in graph theory.\n\nThe minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all the edges of a complete graph K_n is given by the formula ⌈log₂(n)⌉. This is known as the biclique covering number. A covering means that every edge of K_n must belong to at least one of the bipartite subgraphs.\n\nFor the complete graph K_35, where n = 35, the calculation is as follows:\n- We need to find the smallest integer k such that 2^k ≥ 35.\n- 2^5 = 32\n- 2^6 = 64\n- Since 32 < 35 ≤ 64, the smallest integer exponent is 6.\n- Therefore, the minimum number of bipartite graphs is ⌈log₂(35)⌉ = 6.\n\nThis interpretation is distinct from the Graham-Pollak theorem, which states that a minimum of n-1 complete bipartite graphs are required to *partition* the edges of K_n, meaning each edge belongs to exactly one subgraph. The use of the word \"covering\" in the prompt indicates that an edge can be part of multiple bipartite graphs.\n\nAnother interpretation of the question could be the \"capacity\" of the covering, which is the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite graph. A known result by Hansel, and Katona and Szemerédi, states that the capacity of any bipartite covering of K_n is at least n*log₂(n). For n=35, this would be approximately 35 * 5.13 ≈ 179.5. However, this provides a lower bound and not necessarily an integer answer for the minimum sum. The most standard interpretation leading to a precise integer is the biclique covering number.\n\nThus, assuming the most common interpretation of this classic problem, the question refers to the number of bipartite graphs in the covering set.\n\n<<<6>>>"
