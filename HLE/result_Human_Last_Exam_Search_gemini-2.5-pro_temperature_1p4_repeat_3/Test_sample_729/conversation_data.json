    "There are 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 (Q_128).\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order 128, denoted as Q_128, can be defined by the presentation:\nQ_128 = < x, y | x⁶⁴ = 1, x³² = y², yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹ >.\n\nA power subgroup, Gᵏ, is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in the group G. To find the number of distinct power subgroups of Q_128, we analyze the subgroups generated for different values of k.\n\nThe elements of Q_128 are either powers of x, which form a cyclic subgroup of order 64, or elements of the form yxⁱ, which all have an order of 4. The exponent of the group, which is the least common multiple of the orders of all its elements, is 64.\n\nThe distinct power subgroups of Q_128 are as follows:\n1.  **For any odd k:** The subgroup generated by the k-th powers, (Q_128)ᵏ, is the group Q_128 itself. This is because for an odd k, the powers of x will still generate the entire cyclic subgroup <x>, and the k-th power of y will be an element outside of <x>, thus generating the whole group.\n2.  **(Q_128)²:** The subgroup generated by the squares of all elements is the cyclic subgroup <x²>, which is isomorphic to C₃₂, a cyclic group of order 32.\n3.  **(Q_128)⁴:** The subgroup generated by the fourth powers of all elements is the cyclic subgroup <x⁴>, isomorphic to C₁₆.\n4.  **(Q_128)⁸:** This power subgroup is the cyclic subgroup <x⁸>, isomorphic to C₈.\n5.  **(Q_128)¹⁶:** This power subgroup is the cyclic subgroup <x¹⁶>, isomorphic to C₄.\n6.  **(Q_128)³²:** This power subgroup is the cyclic subgroup <x³²>, which is the center of the group and is isomorphic to C₂.\n7.  **(Q_128)⁶⁴:** The subgroup generated by the 64th powers of all elements is the trivial subgroup, {1}, as all elements raised to the power of the group's exponent result in the identity element.\n\nAny other power k (an even number not a power of 2) can be expressed as k = 2ʲm, where m is odd. The resulting power subgroup will be the same as (Q_128)²ʲ. Therefore, the list above comprises all distinct power subgroups.\n\nIn summary, the 7 distinct power subgroups are: Q_128, C₃₂, C₁₆, C₈, C₄, C₂, and the trivial subgroup {1}.\n\n<<<7>>>"
