    "## Americas' Oldest Recorded Date Emerges from Mesoamerica, Shrouded in Scholarly Debate\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is a subject of ongoing archaeological and epigraphic debate. While several artifacts present compelling evidence, the most widely discussed and securely dated candidates point to the Zapotec and Olmec civilizations in Mesoamerica. The distinction of the \"earliest\" depends on the interpretation and dating of a handful of key artifacts, each with its own set of scholarly considerations.\n\nThe leading contender for the earliest calendrical inscription is found on **Zapotec Monument 3 from San José Mogote**, in what is now Oaxaca, Mexico. This carved stone slab, depicting a slain captive, bears glyphs between the figure's feet that have been interpreted as the day-name **\"1 Earthquake\"** from the 260-day ritual calendar. The monument is generally dated to **before 500 BCE**, with some estimates placing it around 600 BCE. This inscription is considered by many scholars to be the earliest physical evidence of the Mesoamerican calendar.\n\nA close competitor for this distinction comes from the Olmec civilization. At the site of **San Andrés** in Tabasco, Mexico, a ceramic cylinder seal and greenstone plaque fragments were discovered and dated to approximately **650 BCE**. The glyphs on the cylinder seal have been interpreted by some researchers as **\"3 Ajaw,\"** a day in the 260-day calendar. However, there is debate among scholars as to whether these symbols represent a true date or are more iconographic in nature.\n\nAnother intriguing, though less substantiated, claim for the earliest recorded date is an **Olmec earspool**, which is said to bear the inscription \"2 Ahau 3 Ceh\" along with a Long Count date corresponding to **September 2, 678 BCE**. While this date is remarkably early and specific, detailed information regarding the artifact's provenance, the methodology of its dating, and widespread scholarly verification remains limited in available sources.\n\nOther early, but later, calendrical inscriptions include the earliest known Maya date glyph, **\"7 Deer,\"** found on a mural fragment at San Bartolo, Guatemala, and dated to around **250 BCE**. The earliest recorded Long Count date, a more complex calendrical system, is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico, and corresponds to **36 BCE**.\n\nWhile architectural alignments at Olmec sites suggest the use of the 260-day calendar as far back as 1100 BCE, this does not represent a written record. Similarly, the **Cascajal Block**, an Olmec artifact with a writing system dated to circa 900 BCE, does not appear to contain any calendrical information.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Olmec earspool presents a tantalizing possibility for a much earlier date, the current balance of well-documented and debated evidence points to the Zapotec inscription of \"1 Earthquake\" from San José Mogote, dated to before 500 BCE, as the most frequently cited and widely discussed candidate for the earliest known recorded date in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n<<<Zapotec Monument 3 from San José Mogote, \"1 Earthquake,\" before 500 BCE>>>"
