    "The symmetry point group of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper ion.\n\nFor the **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)** complex, the cation [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂]⁺ has a tetrahedral coordination geometry around the copper atom. The point group for this complex is **S₄**. This structure possesses a four-fold improper rotation axis (S₄) but lacks other symmetry elements such as mirror planes or a center of inversion.\n\nIn the case of the **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)** complex, specifically the bis(tetrafluoroborate) salt, [Cu(C₄H₁₀S₂)₂](BF₄)₂, the copper ion is in a distorted octahedral environment. The two 2,5-dithiahexane ligands are in the equatorial plane, and two fluorine atoms from the tetrafluoroborate anions occupy the axial positions. In the crystal structure, the copper atom is located at a center of inversion. This results in the point group for the complex cation in this specific crystalline form being **Cᵢ**.\n\nTherefore, the symmetry point group is **S₄** for the copper(I) complex and **Cᵢ** for the copper(II) complex in its crystalline tetrafluoroborate salt.\n\n<<<S₄ for the copper(I) complex and Cᵢ for the copper(II) complex.>>>"
