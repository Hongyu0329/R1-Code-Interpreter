    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the intricate network of crease lines divides the paper into a surprisingly large number of regions. By carefully examining the crease pattern of a traditional crane, it's possible to count these distinct areas.\n\nThe process of folding a crane involves a series of steps that build upon each other, creating a complex pattern of mountain and valley folds. These folds, when the paper is flattened, intersect and enclose numerous polygonal regions. A detailed analysis of the standard crease pattern reveals a total of 130 distinct regions.\n\nThis can be determined by systematically counting each enclosed area on a clear diagram of the crane's crease pattern. The pattern is symmetrical, which can aid in the counting process, but care must be taken to account for all the small and irregularly shaped regions.\n\n<<<130>>>"
