    "Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8. To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation, we first need to find the number of functions for each type of atom.\n\nFor a 6-31G basis set:\n*   **Carbon (C)**, a second-row atom, has core and valence electrons. The '6' in 6-31G signifies that the 1s core orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function derived from 6 primitive Gaussians. The '31' indicates a split-valence basis set for the valence orbitals (2s and 2p). The 2s and 2p orbitals are each represented by two contracted functions: one from 3 primitive Gaussians and the other from 1 primitive Gaussian. This gives a total of 1 (for 1s) + 4 (one for 2s from 3 primitives, one for 2s from 1 primitive, and similarly for the three 2p orbitals) = 5 basis functions. However, standard basis sets provide functions for each of the three p orbitals (px, py, pz) and one s orbital for the valence shell, each split into two. So, for the valence shell, there are 2 (for s) + 2*3 (for p) = 8 basis functions. Adding the core 1s function gives a total of 9 contracted Gaussian functions for each carbon atom.\n*   **Hydrogen (H)** only has a valence 1s orbital. For the 6-31G basis set, this is represented by two contracted Gaussian functions: one composed of 3 primitive Gaussians and the other being a single primitive Gaussian. Thus, each hydrogen atom has 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8):\n*   7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total** = 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\n\nTherefore, for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene, 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used.The first step is to identify the number and type of atoms in the toluene molecule, C7H8. There are 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom using the 6-31G basis set.\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n    *   The 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set.\n    *   The '6' indicates that one contracted Gaussian function is used for the core (1s) orbital, which is formed from a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   The '31' indicates that the valence orbitals (2s and 2p) are split into two basis functions. One is a contracted Gaussian function from 3 primitives, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian function.\n    *   A carbon atom has one 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz).\n    *   So, for the valence shell, there are (1+1) functions for the 2s orbital and (1+1) functions for each of the three 2p orbitals. This gives a total of 2 + 3*2 = 8 valence functions.\n    *   Adding the core function, each carbon atom is described by 1 (core) + 8 (valence) = 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   A hydrogen atom only has a 1s valence orbital.\n    *   The 6-31G basis set describes this 1s orbital with two contracted Gaussian functions (one from 3 primitives and one from 1 primitive).\n    *   Therefore, each hydrogen atom has 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8):\n\n*   For the 7 carbon atoms: 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n*   For the 8 hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms * 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n*   Total number of functions = 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\n\n<<<79>>>To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we first need to understand what the 6-31G notation represents for each type of atom.\n\nFor a **carbon (C)** atom, the 6-31G basis set is a split-valence basis set. This means different numbers of functions are used for core and valence electrons.\n\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** The '6' signifies that the core 1s orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function. This function is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The '31' indicates that the valence orbitals are each described by two contracted Gaussian functions.\n    *   One function is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   The second function is a single, uncontracted Gaussian primitive.\n    *   A carbon atom has one 2s and three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz).\n    *   Therefore, the valence shell uses 2 functions for the 2s orbital and 2 functions for each of the three 2p orbitals, totaling 2 + (3 * 2) = 8 valence functions.\n*   **Total for Carbon:** Adding the core and valence functions, each carbon atom has 1 + 8 = 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nFor a **hydrogen (H)** atom, which only has a 1s valence orbital:\n\n*   The 6-31G basis set describes this 1s orbital with two contracted Gaussian functions.\n    *   One is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The other is a single primitive Gaussian.\n*   **Total for Hydrogen:** Each hydrogen atom is represented by 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total for toluene (C7H8):\n\n*   **7 Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **8 Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n*   **Total:** 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\nThus, a 6-31G basis set calculation for toluene uses 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n<<<79>>>"
