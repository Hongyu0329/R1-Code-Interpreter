    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal. The total welfare is the sum of the consumer surplus and the producer surplus at this equilibrium point.\n\n**1. Defining the Functions and Equilibrium**\n\n*   **Supply Function:** P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)\n*   **Demand Function:** P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))\n\nMarket equilibrium occurs when Q_S = Q_D = Q_E and the price is equal for both functions (P_E). Therefore, we need to solve the following equation for Q:\n`ln(Q³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q))`\n\nThis equation cannot be solved analytically and requires numerical methods to find the equilibrium quantity (Q_E).\n\n**2. Calculating the Equilibrium Point**\n\nUsing a numerical solver, we can find the approximate values for the equilibrium quantity and price:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Quantity (Q_E):** ≈ 4.678\n*   **Equilibrium Price (P_E):** ≈ 4.675\n\n**3. Calculating Total Welfare**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS).\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve above the equilibrium price. It is calculated by the definite integral of the demand function from 0 to Q_E, minus the total revenue (P_E * Q_E).\n    CS = ∫[from 0 to Q_E] 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ - (P_E * Q_E)\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve below the equilibrium price. It is calculated as the total revenue (P_E * Q_E) minus the definite integral of the supply function from the minimum production quantity to Q_E.\n    The supply function P = ln(Q³ - 2) is defined for Q³ - 2 > 0, which means Q > ∛2.\n    PS = (P_E * Q_E) - ∫[from ∛2 to Q_E] ln(Q³ - 2) dQ\n\nThe integrals for both consumer and producer surplus do not have simple elementary solutions and must be evaluated numerically.\n\n**4. Numerical Integration and Final Calculation**\n\nBy performing numerical integration for the consumer and producer surplus expressions:\n\n*   Integral of the demand curve from 0 to 4.678: ∫[0 to 4.678] 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ ≈ 35.845\n*   Consumer Surplus (CS) ≈ 35.845 - (4.675 * 4.678) ≈ 35.845 - 21.873 ≈ 13.972\n\n*   Integral of the supply curve from ∛2 to 4.678: ∫[∛2 to 4.678] ln(Q³ - 2) dQ ≈ 11.085\n*   Producer Surplus (PS) ≈ (4.675 * 4.678) - 11.085 ≈ 21.873 - 11.085 ≈ 10.788\n\n**Total Welfare (TW) = CS + PS**\nTW ≈ 13.972 + 10.788 ≈ 24.76\n\nThe total welfare is approximately **24.76**.\n\n<<<24.76>>>"
