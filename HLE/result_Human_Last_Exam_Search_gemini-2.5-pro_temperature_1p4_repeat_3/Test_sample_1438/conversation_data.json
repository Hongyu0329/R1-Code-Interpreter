    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the Pauli exclusion principle is fundamentally encoded by using anticommuting numbers known as Grassmann variables. The core property of these variables is that they anticommute, `ψᵢψⱼ = -ψⱼψᵢ`, which immediately leads to the crucial rule `ψᵢ² = 0`. This algebraic property is the direct mathematical representation of the Pauli exclusion principle, as it ensures that any term corresponding to two fermions occupying the same state vanishes.\n\nTo perform calculations within this formalism, one defines integration over these Grassmann variables, known as Berezin integration. The integral \"measure,\" `dψ`, is not a simple value but is defined by a set of specific rules that are consistent with the anticommuting nature of the variables. For a single Grassmann variable `ψ`, the value of the integral is defined by the following two rules:\n\n1.  The integral of the constant function 1 is zero:\n    `∫ dψ * 1 = 0`\n\n2.  The integral of the variable itself is one:\n    `∫ dψ * ψ = 1`\n\nThese two rules define the measure for a Grassmann variable integral. Any function of a single Grassmann variable can be expanded as `f(ψ) = A + Bψ` (because `ψ²=0`), and its integral is then `∫ dψ f(ψ) = B`. These definitions ensure that the path integral correctly implements the Pauli exclusion principle for fermionic systems.\n\n<<<The measure `dψ` for a Grassmann variable integral is defined by the rules: `∫ dψ = 0` and `∫ dψ ψ = 1`.>>>"
