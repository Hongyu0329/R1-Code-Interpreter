The critical amount of correlation `c`, defined as the expectation `c = <v_k s_k>`, required to balance potentiation and depression is given by the expression:
`c = 2Nθμ - μ - 2(N-1)μ^2`
where `N` is the number of neurons in each input population, `μ` is the average firing rate of the input neurons, and `θ` is the heterosynaptic depression constant.
