    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we must first understand the range of IP addresses each network covers.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Networks:**\n    *   **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0/19`\n        *   A `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n        *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0/19`\n        *   A `/19` subnet mask is also `255.255.224.0`.\n        *   This network includes IP addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n2.  **Combine the Ranges:**\n    The two networks are contiguous, meaning one ends where the other begins. The combined range of addresses to be matched is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n3.  **Find the Summary Address and Wildcard Mask:**\n    To cover this entire range with a single ACL entry, we need to find a summary address and a corresponding wildcard mask. This process is also known as supernetting.\n    *   **Binary Representation:** Let's look at the third octet of the starting and ending addresses in binary:\n        *   `96` = `01100000`\n        *   `159` = `10011111`\n    *   To cover this range, we need to find the common bits and the bits that vary. However, a simple summarization is not possible because the range cannot be represented by a single, standard network prefix.\n    *   The goal is to find an ACL entry `network wildcard-mask` that correctly identifies all hosts in the specified range.\n    *   The total number of addresses in the range is 16,384 (from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`). This corresponds to a `/18` block (`2^14 = 16,384` addresses, and `32 - 14 = 18`).\n    *   A `/18` subnet has a mask of `255.255.192.0`, which corresponds to a wildcard mask of `0.0.63.255`.\n    *   Now, we need to find the correct network address for the ACL entry. The network address for a summary route must be a multiple of its block size. The `/18` block size is 64 in the third octet. The summary `172.20.64.0/18` would cover `172.20.64.0` to `172.20.127.255`, and `172.20.128.0/18` would cover `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.191.255`. Neither of these perfectly matches our desired range.\n    *   However, in an ACL, the address and wildcard combination does not strictly need to align to a valid network ID for routing purposes. We can specify a starting address and a wildcard that covers the intended range.\n    *   Let's use the starting address of our range, `172.20.96.0`, and the wildcard mask we found, `0.0.63.255`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the ACL Entry:**\n    *   **Network Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.63.255`\n\nThis ACL entry `172.20.96.0 0.0.63.255` will match all IP addresses from `172.20.96.0` through `172.20.159.255`, which precisely covers the two specified networks.\n\n<<<172.20.96.0 0.0.63.255>>>"
