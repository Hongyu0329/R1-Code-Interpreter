    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride, more commonly known as Rhodamine B, is **Shocking Pink**.\n\nThe chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is identified as Rhodamine B, a synthetic dye known for its vibrant, fluorescent pink and red hues. Crayola produces a range of fluorescent crayons, and \"Shocking Pink\" is consistently listed among these specialty colors.\n\nWhile Crayola does not disclose the specific pigments used in their crayons, citing them as trade secrets, the evidence points to Rhodamine B being the pigment responsible for the distinct fluorescent quality of \"Shocking Pink\". Rhodamine B is described as a brilliant pink or red dye with strong fluorescence. It is also used in other applications like textile dyeing, inks, and as a tracer dye in water.\n\nThe introduction of fluorescent colors by Crayola in the 1970s included a vibrant pink which was eventually named \"Shocking Pink\" in 1990. This crayon is noted for its fluorescent properties and is included in Crayola's \"Neon Crayons\" sets. Given that Rhodamine B is a well-known fluorescent pink/red dye used in various applications, including crayons, it is the ingredient that gives \"Shocking Pink\" its characteristic color.\n\n<<<Shocking Pink>>>"
