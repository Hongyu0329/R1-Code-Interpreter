    "A unique architectural feature of the Piazza della Rotonda, which was removed, was an iron railing, known in Italian as a \"cancellata\". This railing was installed in 1668 by order of Pope Clement IX to enclose the pronaos (the portico) of the Pantheon, primarily to prevent the bustling market from spilling into the revered space.\n\nWhile historical accounts confirm the existence and subsequent removal of this railing, there is a discrepancy regarding the exact date of its removal. Several sources indicate that the railing was taken down between 1876 and 1883 as part of a larger project to transform the urban layout of the piazza. This beautification effort also included the demolition of the so-called \"ass's ears,\" two small bell towers that had been added to the Pantheon.\n\nAnother notable feature of the piazza is the \"Madonna of the Railing,\" a venerated image of the Virgin Mary. However, the railing associated with this image was a smaller one that protected the painting when it was located in a niche of the Pantheon's portico, and the image itself was later moved to a different location within the church, not removed from the piazza.\n\nAlthough the initial query specified that the removal of the architectural feature occurred in 1950, extensive research has not revealed any significant architectural removals from the Piazza della Rotonda in that year. The changes noted in the piazza around the mid-20th century were more commercial in nature, such as the disappearance of certain shops. Therefore, based on the available historical evidence, the prominent iron railing that once surrounded the Pantheon's portico is the most fitting answer, with the caveat that its removal date appears to be in the late 19th century, not 1950.\n\n<<<the iron railing (cancellata) that enclosed the portico of the Pantheon>>>"
