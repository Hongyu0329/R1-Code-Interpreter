There is no simple modification of the standard logistic map using only X and R that results in a stable equilibrium point of approximately 1.05 for R=3.57. The modifications that can tame the chaos result in equilibrium points that are not close to 1.05, and modifications that could potentially create an equilibrium at 1.05 do not make it stable without introducing new parameters.
