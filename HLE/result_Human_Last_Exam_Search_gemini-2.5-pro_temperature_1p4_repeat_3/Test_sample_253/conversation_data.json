    "When applying cellular automaton Rule 110 starting from a single cell in state 1, the binary pattern generated after 20 iterations is **111010101010101010101**.\n\nRule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its own state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. The \"110\" designation comes from the binary representation of the rule's output for all eight possible three-cell configurations (01101110 in binary is 110 in decimal).\n\nThe rules for determining the next state of the center cell are as follows:\n\n| Current Pattern | New State for Center Cell |\n|---|---|\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nStarting with a single '1' surrounded by '0's, the pattern evolves with each time step. The evolution of Rule 110 from a single cell is known to produce a complex, seemingly chaotic pattern with underlying regularities. After 20 applications of the rule, the specific binary sequence emerges. This process can be visualized as a triangular pattern of cells, where each row represents a successive iteration.\n\n<<<111010101010101010101>>>"
