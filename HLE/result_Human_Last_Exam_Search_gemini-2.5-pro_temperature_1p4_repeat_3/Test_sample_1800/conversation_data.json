    "The ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is not a single universal value; it is highly dependent on the specific reaction—either the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting (WS)—and the precise reaction conditions and catalyst preparation methods.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which converts carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and hydrogen, the optimal Ni/Ce ratio can vary. Research indicates that:\n*   A nickel content in the range of **10 to 12.5 wt%** in Ni/CeO₂ catalysts demonstrates high specific activity for CO conversion, with nearly identical performance at 400°C.\n*   In studies involving La-doped ceria for the reverse WGS reaction, an optimal nickel proportion of around **7% molar** has been identified.\n*   For CO oxidation, a reaction mechanistically related to WGS, a **15 wt% NiO/CeO₂** catalyst was found to be both active and stable.\n\nThe catalytic activity in the WGS reaction is strongly linked to factors such as the dispersion of nickel particles, the interaction between nickel and the ceria support, and the presence of oxygen vacancies in the ceria lattice, which are all influenced by the Ni/Ce ratio.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn the case of water splitting for hydrogen production, which can occur via different methods such as electrocatalysis or photocatalysis, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio also differs:\n\n*   **Computational studies** suggest that nanoparticles with a **3Ni/1Ce atomic ratio** exhibit favorable electronic properties that enhance the water-splitting reaction.\n*   For the **Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER)**, a critical step in electrocatalytic water splitting, catalysts with Ni/Ce atomic ratios of **3:1 (Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ)** and **1:1 (Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ)** have shown the highest activity. This enhanced performance is attributed to a greater concentration of oxygen vacancies.\n*   In systems co-doped with other elements, such as iron, a catalyst with **20 mol% total dopants**, composed of a 1:1 ratio of Ni and Fe in ceria, has demonstrated excellent performance for overall water splitting.\n*   For **photocatalytic hydrogen production** (specifically glycerol photoreforming), a bimetallic catalyst of gold and nickel on ceria showed that a very small amount of nickel (**0.1 wt% Ni** with 0.9 wt% Au) significantly improved the stability and activity of the catalyst.\n\nIn conclusion, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is intricately linked to the target application. For the WGS reaction, an optimal range for nickel appears to be between 7 and 15 wt%, depending on the specific catalyst formulation. For water splitting, higher Ni content, with atomic ratios of 1:1 and 3:1 relative to cerium, has proven effective for electrocatalysis, while much lower amounts may be beneficial in certain photocatalytic systems.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is not universal and depends on the specific catalytic application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, optimal nickel content generally falls in the range of 7 wt% to 15 wt%. For water splitting, particularly in electrocatalysis, Ni/Ce atomic ratios of 1:1 and 3:1 have shown high activity.>>>"
