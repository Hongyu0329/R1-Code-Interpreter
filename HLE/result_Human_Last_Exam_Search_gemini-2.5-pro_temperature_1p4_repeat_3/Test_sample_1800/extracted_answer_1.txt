The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is not universal and depends on the specific catalytic application. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, optimal nickel content generally falls in the range of 7 wt% to 15 wt%. For water splitting, particularly in electrocatalysis, Ni/Ce atomic ratios of 1:1 and 3:1 have shown high activity.
