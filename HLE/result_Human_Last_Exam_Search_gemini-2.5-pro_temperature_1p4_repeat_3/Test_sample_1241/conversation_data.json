    "To find the steady-state probabilities $P_i(+\\infty)$, which we denote as $P_i$, for the given Kolmogorov-Chapman system of equations, we need to solve the system under the condition that the probabilities are no longer changing. This means we set the derivatives with respect to time to zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$. This transforms the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations. The equilibrium probabilities must also satisfy the condition that their sum is equal to 1.\n\nThe system of equations at steady-state is:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 P_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) P_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3$\n5.  $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\nFrom the fourth equation, we find that $0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3$, which simplifies to $P_2 = P_3$.\n\nFrom the third equation, we have $0.4 P_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) P_2$, which simplifies to $0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2$, meaning $P_1 = P_2$. Therefore, we have the relationship $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n\nFrom the first equation, we can express $P_0$ in terms of $P_1$: $0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1$, which gives $P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1$.\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition (the fifth equation) and substitute the relationships we've found:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n\nCombining the terms with $P_1$:\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) P_1 = 1$\n\nSolving for $P_1$:\n$P_1 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}} = \\frac{0.019}{0.65 + 0.057} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\nNext, we calculate $P_0$ using the expression we found earlier:\n$P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707}$\n\nThe problem asks for the sum $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} + \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nPerforming the final calculation gives:\n$P_0 + P_1 \\approx 0.946251768$\n\nRounding to five decimal places, the value is 0.94625.\n\n<<<0.94625>>>"
