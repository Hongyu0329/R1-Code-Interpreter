    "While there are characters in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who have knowledge of Roman cities and their customs, no specific character is described as having visited a Roman city and then detailing their religious practices in a manner that directly alludes to the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\nThe novel focuses on the conflict between the Germanic Goths and the invading Roman legions. The central character, Thiodolf, is the war leader of the Wolfing tribe. Although the Romans are the antagonists, their culture and beliefs are not extensively detailed by any single character in a way that specifically references the founders of Rome.\n\nThere is a passage where a Wolfing warrior describes a Roman city, mentioning its \"mighty houses\" and \"wall of stone and lime,\" focusing on the city's wealth rather than its religious life. Critical analysis of the novel points to William Morris's broader thematic concerns, such as the virtues of the Germanic tribal community versus the perceived corruption and imperialism of Rome, rather than a detailed engagement with specific Roman myths through character dialogue.\n\nOne academic source notes a symbolic link, suggesting that the Romans' appropriation of the Wolfings' totemic wolf emblem hints at their own founding myth of Romulus and Remus. However, this is presented as a scholarly interpretation of the novel's symbolism and not as a description given by a character within the narrative.\n\nBased on available summaries and scholarly analyses of *The House of the Wolfings*, there is no evidence of a character who fulfills the specific role described in the question.\n\n<<<Based on the available information, no character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* is documented as having visited a Roman city and described their religious practices with a clear allusion to Romulus and Remus.>>>"
