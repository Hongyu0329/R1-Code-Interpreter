    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group $W$. For a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms, which implies that the group is of split type. Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\nAccording to a paper by Lusztig, the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112. This result is also confirmed by other sources that describe the structure and properties of the Weyl group of $E_8$.\n\nTherefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
