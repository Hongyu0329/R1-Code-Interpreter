The precise amino acid residues and their positions on the human beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit and for fine-tuning its gating properties are not explicitly detailed in the available literature. The interaction is known to be mediated by the Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP) within the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain of the beta-1 subunit, which binds to the Alpha-Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit. The GK domain is also the primary modulator of gating. While the domains involved are well-established, a specific list of hotspot residues on the human beta-1 subunit requires further detailed structural and mutagenesis studies.
