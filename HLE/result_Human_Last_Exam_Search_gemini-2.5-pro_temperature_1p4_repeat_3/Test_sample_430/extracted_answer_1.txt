The problem is not solvable with the given information. The derivation of the grand partition function is \(Z = \left(1 + \sum_{i=1}^{k} \exp\left[ -\beta \left( -\epsilon_1 - (i-1)\epsilon_v + z_l \epsilon_l \sum_{j=1}^{i} \theta_j - i\mu \right) \right]\right)^N\), where the coverages \(\theta_j\) must be found self-consistently. A numerical value cannot be computed because the interaction energies for the second and subsequent layers (\(\epsilon_2, \dots, \epsilon_k\)) are not provided.
