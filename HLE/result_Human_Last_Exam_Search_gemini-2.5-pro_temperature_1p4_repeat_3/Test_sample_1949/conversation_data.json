    "The three longest rivers mentioned in the context of the Greco-Roman world of the Aeneid are the Tiber, Haliacmon, and Acheloüs.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Tiber River**, flowing for 406 kilometers (252 miles) through Italy and famously through Rome. In the Aeneid, the Tiber is a significant geographical feature, prophesied as the location for the Trojans' new home.\n\nThe second longest is the **Haliacmon River** (modern Aliakmonas), which is the longest river entirely in Greece, with a length of 297 kilometers (185 miles). While not explicitly named in the Aeneid, it was a major river in the Macedonian region, part of the broader world known to the Romans.\n\nThe third is the **Acheloüs River** (also spelled Achelous), another significant river in Greece, with a length of approximately 220 kilometers (137 miles).\n\nOther rivers mentioned in the epic, such as the Alpheus in Greece with a length of about 112 kilometers (70 miles), are shorter. The rivers of the underworld that Aeneas encounters, including the Acheron, Styx, Phlegethon, Cocytus, and Lethe, are mythological and do not have literal, measurable lengths in the real world. There is a real Acheron river in Greece, but it is much shorter at 52 kilometers (32 miles).\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Tiber, Haliacmon, and Acheloüs.>>>"
