The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor is primarily due to the weak localization effect. This phenomenon arises from the constructive quantum interference of time-reversed, closed-loop electron paths, which enhances the probability of the electron returning to its origin. This increased "localization" hinders charge transport and reduces the overall conductivity.

The magnitude of this correction, Δσ, can be evaluated using the following formula for a 3-dimensional system:

**Δσ = - (e² / (2π²ħ)) * (1/l_e - 1/l_φ)**

Here, `e` is the electron charge, `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant, `l_e` is the elastic mean free path (the average distance between impurity scattering events), and `l_φ` is the phase coherence length. The phase coherence length is the crucial scale, representing the maximum size of an interfering loop before an inelastic scattering event destroys the electron's phase memory.

The electron's wavelength is implicitly crucial, as the diffusive regime where this model applies requires the mean free path to be much larger than the wavelength (`l_e >> λ`). The correction is negative because `l_φ > l_e`, signifying a reduction in conductivity. Since the phase coherence length `l_φ` increases as temperature decreases, this quantum correction becomes more pronounced at lower temperatures, leading to a characteristic rise in resistivity as the temperature is lowered.
