    "The initial analysis of the problem seems to be correct. The goal is to find the maximum number of different values of `k` for which a complete graph `K_k` exists as an induced subgraph within a single graph `G` on `n=128` vertices.\n\nA key aspect of the question is the term \"induced subgraphs.\" An induced subgraph is formed by a subset of vertices and *all* the edges that exist between them in the original graph. The search results often discuss \"maximal cliques,\" which are cliques that cannot be extended by adding another vertex. The question, however, is about the sizes of all possible induced cliques, not just the maximal ones.\n\nLet's break down the reasoning:\n1.  **The set of possible clique sizes:** For a graph with `n=128` vertices, the size `k` of any clique must be an integer between 1 and 128. This is because a clique is a set of vertices, and its size cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph.\n\n2.  **Upper Bound:** The number of different possible clique sizes is therefore at most 128. The set of all possible sizes is a subset of `{1, 2, ..., 128}`.\n\n3.  **Achievability:** To show that 128 is the maximum possible number, we need to demonstrate that there exists at least one graph on 128 vertices that contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n\n4.  **The Complete Graph (K_128):** Consider the complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted as `K_128`. In this graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n    *   To find an induced clique of any size `k` (where `1 <= k <= 128`), we can simply choose any subset of `k` vertices.\n    *   The subgraph induced by this subset of `k` vertices will include all the edges between them from the original graph `K_128`.\n    *   Since every pair of vertices in `K_128` is connected, every pair of vertices in our chosen subset is also connected.\n    *   Therefore, the induced subgraph is a complete graph of size `k`, i.e., a `K_k`.\n    *   This holds true for any integer `k` from 1 to 128.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The complete graph `K_128` contains induced subgraphs that are cliques for all possible sizes from 1 to 128. Thus, it achieves the maximum possible number of 128 different clique sizes. The search results, while discussing related concepts like maximal cliques, do not contradict this fundamental point about induced cliques in a complete graph.\n\nNo other graph can have more than 128 different clique sizes, as the size of a clique cannot exceed the number of vertices in the graph.\n\n<<<128>>>"
