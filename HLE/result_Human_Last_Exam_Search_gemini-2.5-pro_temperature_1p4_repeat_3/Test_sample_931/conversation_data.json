    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are primarily predatory insects. Their diet mainly consists of soft-bodied arthropods like aphids.\n\nIn addition to preying on other insects, some species of adult snakeflies have been observed to feed on pollen and nectar. Specifically, pollen has been found in the gut of adult snakeflies, and some are known to consume nectar or honeydew. Because adult snakeflies have been recorded feeding on both aphids (E. Totara Aphids) and nectar (A), the correct choice is F.\n\nThere is no scientific record of them feeding on fungus or leaf tissue, which eliminates options C and D.\n\n<<<F>>>"
