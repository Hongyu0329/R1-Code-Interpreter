Based on the body of evidence, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit a more robust and pro-inflammatory cytokine release profile—characterized by significantly increased levels of Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α)—compared to T cells manufactured without it. This is because IL-15 is a potent stimulator of T cell survival, proliferation, and effector function. It directly induces the production of these key anti-tumor cytokines and promotes a more cytotoxic T cell phenotype. Therefore, the inclusion of IL-15 in the manufacturing process would likely result in a more potent and persistent CAR T cell product capable of mounting a stronger and more sustained anti-cancer immune response.
