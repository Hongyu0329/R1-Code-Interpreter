    "The island town in question is **Edinburgh of the Seven Seas**, located on the island of **Tristan da Cunha**.\n\nTristan da Cunha is the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, situated in the South Atlantic Ocean. The nearest inhabited land is the island of Saint Helena, over 2,400 kilometers away, far exceeding the 500-kilometer condition.\n\nThe main island, also named Tristan da Cunha, is a volcanic island. Its only settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, often referred to locally as \"The Settlement\". The town sits on a flat coastal plain at the base of the island's volcano, Queen Mary's Peak. While the entire island is of volcanic origin, the town itself is not situated within a caldera in the traditional sense, unlike settlements on islands like Santorini. Furthermore, the bay it overlooks is not named after the town; it is adjacent to the sites of what were formerly Big and Little Beach before a 1961 volcanic eruption.\n\nOther remote volcanic islands with settlements in calderas exist, such as Aogashima in Japan and the Gambier Islands in French Polynesia. However, neither of these is as isolated as Tristan da Cunha. Aogashima's nearest inhabited neighbor is about 60 kilometers away, and the Gambier Islands are approximately 1,600 kilometers from Tahiti. Therefore, despite the geographical description in the question not being perfectly precise for Tristan da Cunha, its extreme remoteness makes it the correct answer.\n\n<<<Edinburgh of the Seven Seas>>>"
