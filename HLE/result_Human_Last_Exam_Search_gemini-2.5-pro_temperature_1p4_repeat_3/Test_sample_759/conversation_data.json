    "To determine the smallest number of edges, $e$, for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with an automorphism group of order 3, we can follow a systematic approach.\n\n1.  **Properties of the Automorphism Group:** An automorphism group of order 3 is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3, denoted $C_3$. This means there exists an automorphism $\\phi$ that permutes the vertices of the graph, such that applying $\\phi$ three times returns the vertices to their original positions ($\\phi^3 = \\text{identity}$), and $\\phi$ is not the identity automorphism.\n\n2.  **Orbits of Vertices and Edges:** The automorphism $\\phi$ partitions the set of vertices and the set of edges into orbits. The size of each orbit must divide the order of the group, which is 3. Therefore, orbits can have a size of 1 (an element fixed by $\\phi$) or 3.\n\n3.  **Constraint on the Number of Edges:** Every edge in the graph is either in an orbit of size 3 or an orbit of size 1. An edge is in an orbit of size 1 if and only if it is fixed by $\\phi$. For an edge $(u,v)$ to be fixed by an automorphism $\\phi$ of order 3, the endpoints $u$ and $v$ must also be fixed. If all edges were in orbits of size 1, then all vertices of the connected graph would be fixed, which would imply the automorphism group is trivial (order 1), a contradiction. Therefore, there must be at least one orbit of edges of size 3. This implies that the total number of edges, $e$, must be a multiple of 3. This eliminates the possibility of $e=1, 2, 4, 5, \\dots$. The smallest possible values for $e$ are 3, 6, 9, and so on.\n\n4.  **Case e=3:** If the graph has 3 edges, these edges must form a single orbit.\n    *   One way to form such a graph is with three vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ and edges forming a triangle, $\\{(v_1,v_2), (v_2,v_3), (v_3,v_1)\\}$. This graph is the cycle graph $C_3$. However, the automorphism group of $C_3$ is the dihedral group $D_3$, which has an order of 6.\n    *   Another 3-edge connected graph is the path $P_4$, which has an automorphism group of order 2.\n    *   A star graph $K_{1,3}$ also has 3 edges. The automorphism group consists of all permutations of the three leaf vertices, so it is $S_3$, which has an order of 6.\n    No simple, connected graph with 3 edges has an automorphism group of order exactly 3.\n\n5.  **Case e=6:** Since $e=3$ is not possible, the next multiple of 3 is 6. We look for a graph with 6 edges. The edges must be partitioned into two orbits of size 3. A known construction for a graph with an automorphism group of order 3 involves creating a structure that has rotational symmetry but lacks reflectional (mirror) symmetry. One such graph can be constructed as follows:\n    *   **Vertices:** Take two sets of three vertices each, let's call them $U = \\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$ and $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. This gives a total of 6 vertices.\n    *   **Edges:**\n        1.  Create a 3-cycle (a triangle) with the vertices in $U$. This gives the edges $\\{(u_1, u_2), (u_2, u_3), (u_3, u_1)\\}$. This is the first orbit of 3 edges.\n        2.  Connect the vertices of $U$ to the vertices of $V$ in a \"twisted\" manner. For example, connect $u_1$ to $v_1$, $u_2$ to $v_2$, and $u_3$ to $v_3$ will not work because it will have a reflectional symmetry. A twisted connection would be $\\{(u_1, v_2), (u_2, v_3), (u_3, v_1)\\}$. This forms the second orbit of 3 edges.\n\nThe resulting graph has 6 vertices and $3+3=6$ edges. Let's analyze its automorphism group:\n*   The vertices $\\{u_1, u_2, u_3\\}$ have a degree of 3.\n*   The vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ have a degree of 1.\n*   Any automorphism must map vertices to vertices of the same degree. So, the set $U$ is mapped to itself, and the set $V$ is mapped to itself.\n*   The induced subgraph on $U$ is a triangle ($C_3$). Any automorphism of the whole graph, when restricted to $U$, must be an automorphism of this $C_3$. The automorphism group of $C_3$ is $D_3$, which includes rotations and reflections.\n*   The cyclic permutation $\\phi = (u_1 u_2 u_3)(v_1 v_2 v_3)$ is an automorphism by construction. This gives a group of order at least 3.\n*   Let's check for reflectional symmetry, for example, the permutation $\\sigma = (u_1 u_2)(v_1 v_2)$. This swaps $u_1$ and $u_2$ while fixing $u_3$. The edge $(u_3, u_1)$ is mapped to $(u_3, u_2)$, which is an edge. However, the edge $(u_2, v_3)$ is mapped to $(u_1, v_3)$, which is not an edge in our graph. Thus, this reflection is not a symmetry of the graph.\n\nThe twisted connections break the reflectional symmetries that are present in more symmetric graphs, leaving only the cyclic symmetries. Therefore, the automorphism group of this graph is precisely $C_3$, which has order 3.\n\nSince a graph with 3 edges is not possible, and we have constructed a valid graph with 6 edges, the smallest such number of edges is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
