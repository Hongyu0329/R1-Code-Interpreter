    "The Hopf charge, or Hopf invariant, is a topological invariant that characterizes maps from the 3-sphere (S³) to the 2-sphere (S²). In the context of a 3D vector field like the one provided, the space R³ is compactified to S³ by requiring the field to be constant at infinity. The vector field itself represents a map to the unit sphere S².\n\nThe Hopf charge can be calculated using Whitehead's integral formula. For a vector field **n**, the Hopf invariant H is given by:\n\nH = - (1 / (4π²)) ∫ **A** ⋅ **B** dV\n\nwhere **B** is the emergent magnetic field and **A** is the corresponding vector potential (**B** = ∇ × **A**). The components of **B** are defined as:\n\nBᵢ = ½ εᵢⱼₖ **n** ⋅ (∂ⱼ**n** × ∂ₖ**n**)\n\nFor the specific class of vector fields known as \"toroidal hopfions,\" which your field belongs to, the Hopf charge is an integer product of two winding numbers, *m* and *n*: Q = mn. These numbers correspond to the poloidal and toroidal winding of the field lines.\n\nThe given vector field is:\n*   nx = sin(G)cos(f)\n*   ny = sin(G)sin(f)\n*   nz = cos(G)\n\nThis is a standard spherical coordinate representation of the vector **n**, where G is the polar angle and f is the azimuthal angle. The field is defined in terms of cylindrical coordinates (ρ, f, z), where ρ² = x² + y² and f = atan2(y, x).\n\nIn this specific case, the azimuthal angle of the vector field, `f = atan2(y,x)`, winds once as you go around the z-axis (a full circle in the x-y plane). This corresponds to a toroidal winding number of **n = 1**.\n\nThe definition of `G` depends on `r2`, which describes a family of nested tori around the circle defined by `rho = sqrt(0.5)` and `z = 0`. As you traverse a poloidal circle (a loop through the \"donut hole\" of one of these tori), the function `G` goes from a value at the center to π and back. However, the vector field's polar angle `G` itself does not complete a full 2π cycle. In the provided formulation, the poloidal winding number, which dictates how many times the vector field wraps around the poloidal direction, is **m = 1**.\n\nTherefore, the Hopf charge Q is the product of these two winding numbers.\n\n<<<1>>>"
