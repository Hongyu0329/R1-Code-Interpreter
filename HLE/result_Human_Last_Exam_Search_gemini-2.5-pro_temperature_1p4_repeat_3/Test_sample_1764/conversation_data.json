    "It is possible for the number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ to be zero.\n\nTo see this, consider the following example:\n*   Let $X$ be a set of three points, $X = \\{a, b, c\\}$, equipped with the discrete metric, where the distance between any two distinct points is 1. This means $d(a,b) = d(b,c) = d(c,a) = 1$. A discrete metric space is a type of ultrametric space, as it satisfies the strong triangle inequality $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$.\n*   Let $B$ be the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ with its usual norm (the absolute value). $\\mathbb{R}$ is a Banach space.\n\nAn isometric embedding of $X$ into $B$ would be a function $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that the distances are preserved. This requires finding three points in $\\mathbb{R}$, let's call them $p_a, p_b, p_c$, such that:\n*   $|p_a - p_b| = 1$\n*   $|p_b - p_c| = 1$\n*   $|p_c - p_a| = 1$\n\nLet's place $p_a$ at the origin, so $p_a = 0$.\nFrom $|p_a - p_b| = 1$, we have $|0 - p_b| = 1$, which means $p_b = 1$ or $p_b = -1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $p_b = 1$**.\n    The condition $|p_b - p_c| = 1$ becomes $|1 - p_c| = 1$. This implies $1 - p_c = 1$ (so $p_c = 0$) or $1 - p_c = -1$ (so $p_c = 2$).\n    *   If $p_c = 0$, then $p_c = p_a$. Since an isometric embedding of a metric space must be injective (unless the distance between the original points is zero), this is not a valid solution.\n    *   If $p_c = 2$, we must check the third condition: $|p_c - p_a| = |2 - 0| = 2$. This contradicts the requirement that the distance be 1.\n\n*   **Case 2: $p_b = -1$**.\n    The condition $|p_b - p_c| = 1$ becomes $|-1 - p_c| = 1$. This implies $-1 - p_c = 1$ (so $p_c = -2$) or $-1 - p_c = -1$ (so $p_c = 0$).\n    *   Again, $p_c=0$ is not a valid solution.\n    *   If $p_c = -2$, we check the third condition: $|p_c - p_a| = |-2 - 0| = 2$. This also contradicts the requirement that the distance be 1.\n\nIn all cases, it is impossible to find three such points in $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, there are no isometric embeddings of this particular finite ultrametric space $X$ into the Banach space $\\mathbb{R}$. The number of such embeddings is 0.\n\nSince the number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\nIf the question were to presuppose that at least one embedding exists, the answer would be 1. This minimum is achieved for a single-point space $X = \\{p\\}$ embedded into the trivial Banach space $B = \\{0\\}$. In this case, there is exactly one function from $X$ to $B$, and it is an isometry, so the number of embeddings is 1.\n\nHowever, without the explicit assumption of existence, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
