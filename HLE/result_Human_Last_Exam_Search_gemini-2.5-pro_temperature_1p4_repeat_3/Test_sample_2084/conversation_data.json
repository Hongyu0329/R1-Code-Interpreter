    "The provided SMILES string `CC12COC(OC1)(OC2)C1=CC=CC=C1` represents a specific type of ketal known as a trioxaspiro-octane derivative. Adding this compound to an acidic aqueous solution, such as 0.01 M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water, will cause it to hydrolyze. This reaction breaks down the ketal into its two original components: a ketone and a diol (an alcohol with two hydroxyl groups) or in this specific case a triol.\n\nThe hydrolysis of the starting ketal will yield two products:\n1.  **Acetophenone**: This is an aromatic ketone.\n2.  **Glycerol**: This is a simple triol (an alcohol with three hydroxyl groups).\n\nTo answer the question, we need to compare the molar masses of these two products.\n\n*   The molar mass of **Acetophenone** (chemical formula C8H8O) is approximately 120.15 g/mol.\n*   The molar mass of **Glycerol** (chemical formula C3H8O3) is approximately 92.09 g/mol.\n\nComparing the two molar masses, acetophenone has the higher value.\n\nThe SMILES string for acetophenone is `CC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1`.\n\n<<<CC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1>>>"
