    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for the electron propagator (also known as the electron self-energy) in quantum electrodynamics is a well-established sequence in physics. The question asks for the value of `a(3)`, which corresponds to the diagrams of order `2n = 6`.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A005412. The terms of the sequence `a(n)` for `n=1, 2, 3, ...` represent the number of diagrams at order 2, 4, 6, and so on.\n\nThe sequence begins:\n*   `a(1)` (order 2): 1 diagram\n*   `a(2)` (order 4): 3 diagrams\n*   `a(3)` (order 6): 18 diagrams\n*   `a(4)` (order 8): 153 diagrams\n\nThis information is corroborated by seminal papers on the topic, such as the work by CvitanoviÄ‡, Lautrup, and Pearson, which provides a table listing the number of various types of Feynman diagrams in QED. Their results for the proper electron self-energy match the sequence above. Specifically, for order 6, they also list 18 diagrams.\n\nTherefore, the value of a(3) is 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
