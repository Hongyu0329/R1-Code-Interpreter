    "In the quantum mechanical treatment of a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum ($L$), spin angular momentum ($S$), and total angular momentum ($J = L + S$) are quantized. The common eigenvalues of the operators for the square of the total angular momentum, $J^2$, and the z-component of the total angular momentum, $J_z$, can be determined by finding the possible values of the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, and the z-component quantum number, *m<sub>j</sub>*.\n\nFor a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is *l* = 1. As an electron is a spin-1/2 particle, its spin quantum number is *s* = 1/2.\n\nThe possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, are determined by the combination of the orbital and spin angular momenta, ranging from |*l* - *s*| to *l* + *s* in integer steps.\n*   Minimum *j*: |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\n*   Maximum *j*: 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nThus, the possible values for *j* are 1/2 and 3/2.\n\nFor each value of *j*, the quantum number *m<sub>j</sub>*, which represents the projection of the total angular momentum onto the z-axis, can take on 2*j* + 1 values, ranging from -*j* to +*j* in integer increments.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the $J^2$ and $J_z$ operators are given by:\n*   Eigenvalue of $J^2$ = ħ² *j*(*j* + 1)\n*   Eigenvalue of $J_z$ = ħ *m<sub>j</sub>*\n\nWe can now determine the common eigenvalues for each possible value of *j*:\n\n**Case 1: j = 3/2**\n*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = **(15/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible values for *m<sub>j</sub>* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2.\n*   This leads to the following common eigenvalues (Eigenvalue of $J^2$, Eigenvalue of $J_z$):\n    *   ((15/4)ħ², (3/2)ħ)\n    *   ((15/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ)\n    *   ((15/4)ħ², - (1/2)ħ)\n    *   ((15/4)ħ², - (3/2)ħ)\n\n**Case 2: j = 1/2**\n*   The eigenvalue of $J^2$ is ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = **(3/4)ħ²**.\n*   The possible values for *m<sub>j</sub>* are -1/2 and 1/2.\n*   This gives the following common eigenvalues:\n    *   ((3/4)ħ², (1/2)ħ)\n    *   ((3/4)ħ², - (1/2)ħ)\n\nIn summary, due to spin-orbit coupling, the single energy level of a p-electron is split into two manifolds, characterized by *j* = 3/2 and *j* = 1/2. Within each manifold, there are degenerate states corresponding to the different possible orientations of the total angular momentum vector in space.\n\n<<<For a p-electron, there are two possible sets of common eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$:\n\n1.  For the state with total angular momentum quantum number *j* = 3/2, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is **(15/4)ħ²**. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are **(3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, -(1/2)ħ, and -(3/2)ħ**.\n\n2.  For the state with total angular momentum quantum number *j* = 1/2, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is **(3/4)ħ²**. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are **(1/2)ħ and -(1/2)ħ**.>>>"
