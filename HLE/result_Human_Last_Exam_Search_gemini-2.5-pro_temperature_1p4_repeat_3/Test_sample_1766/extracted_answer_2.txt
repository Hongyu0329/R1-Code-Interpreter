For a p-electron, there are two possible sets of common eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$:

1.  For the state with total angular momentum quantum number *j* = 3/2, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is **(15/4)ħ²**. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are **(3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, -(1/2)ħ, and -(3/2)ħ**.

2.  For the state with total angular momentum quantum number *j* = 1/2, the eigenvalue of $J^2$ is **(3/4)ħ²**. The corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are **(1/2)ħ and -(1/2)ħ**.
