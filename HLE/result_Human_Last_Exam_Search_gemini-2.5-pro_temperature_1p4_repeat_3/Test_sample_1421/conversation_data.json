    "### Formula for the Fermionic Partition Function in Imaginary Time\n\nThe partition function, Z, for a fermionic system in the imaginary time representation, utilizing Feynman's path integral formalism, is a cornerstone of quantum statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. Its formulation requires the introduction of anticommuting numbers, known as Grassmann numbers, to properly describe the nature of fermions. The transition from real time to imaginary time is achieved through a mathematical procedure called a Wick rotation, which connects quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics.\n\nThe general formula for the fermionic partition function is given by a functional integral over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields, which are represented by Grassmann variables ψ and ψ̄. A crucial aspect of this formalism for fermions is the imposition of anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction. This means that the fermionic fields are required to be anti-periodic over the interval [0, β], where β is the inverse temperature (β = 1/T, with T being the temperature and Boltzmann's constant k_B set to 1). Specifically, ψ(τ, **x**) = -ψ(τ + β, **x**), where τ is the imaginary time.\n\nThe formula can be expressed as:\n\n**Z = ∫Dψ̄Dψ *e*<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̄, ψ]</sup>**\n\nwhere:\n\n*   **∫Dψ̄Dψ** represents the functional integral, often called the Berezin integral, over all possible configurations of the Grassmann-valued fermion fields ψ̄ and ψ.\n*   **S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̄, ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system, which is obtained from the Minkowskian action by a Wick rotation (t → -iτ). The Euclidean action is typically of the form:\n\n    **S<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup>dτ ∫d<sup>d</sup>x ψ̄(τ, **x**)(∂<sub>τ</sub> + H)ψ(τ, **x**)**\n\n    Here, *d* represents the spatial dimension, and *H* is the Hamiltonian operator for the specific fermionic theory, which does not contain time derivatives.\n\nFor a non-interacting (free) fermionic theory, the action is bilinear in the fermion fields. In such cases, the path integral takes on a Gaussian form. This integral can be evaluated exactly and is equal to the determinant of the operator that appears in the action.\n\nFor example, for a free Dirac fermion, the Euclidean action is given by:\n\n**S<sub>E</sub> = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup>dτ ∫d<sup>d</sup>x ψ̄(γ<sup>0</sup>∂<sub>τ</sub> + **γ** ⋅ ∇ + m)ψ**\n\nThe resulting partition function is then proportional to the determinant of the Dirac operator (γ<sup>0</sup>∂<sub>τ</sub> + **γ** ⋅ ∇ + m) with the appropriate anti-periodic boundary conditions for the fermion fields.\n\nIn summary, the path integral formulation for the fermionic partition function provides a powerful framework for studying the thermal properties of fermionic systems. It elegantly incorporates the anticommuting nature of fermions through Grassmann variables and correctly captures their quantum statistics via anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time. This formalism is fundamental to many areas of modern physics, including condensed matter theory and high-energy particle physics.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is: Z = ∫Dψ̄Dψ *e*<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̄, ψ]</sup>, where the integral is a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields ψ and ψ̄, and S<sub>E</sub> is the Euclidean action for the fermionic system. The integral is performed subject to anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction, ψ(τ, **x**) = -ψ(τ + β, **x**), where β is the inverse temperature.>>>"
