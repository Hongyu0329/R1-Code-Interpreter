The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is: Z = ∫Dψ̄Dψ *e*<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ψ̄, ψ]</sup>, where the integral is a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields ψ and ψ̄, and S<sub>E</sub> is the Euclidean action for the fermionic system. The integral is performed subject to anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction, ψ(τ, **x**) = -ψ(τ + β, **x**), where β is the inverse temperature.
