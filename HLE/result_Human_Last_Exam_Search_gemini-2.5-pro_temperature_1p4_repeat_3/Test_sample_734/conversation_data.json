    "**Augustine of Hippo** is the Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall. He accomplished this through his concept of **\"rationes seminales,\"** or **\"seminal reasons.\"**\n\nAugustine proposed that God created the world in a single moment, embedding within it \"seminal reasons\" – latent potentialities for all things that would come into being over time. This framework allowed him to explain events that appear to be outside the normal course of nature, which he defined not as violations of nature itself, but as events contrary to our *knowledge* of nature.\n\nHere is how this terminology applies to both the virgin birth and the Fall:\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** Augustine affirmed the perpetual virginity of Mary—before, during, and after the birth of Jesus—as a miracle. Within his framework, the virgin birth can be understood as the activation of a unique and divinely-willed \"ratio seminalis.\" This was not a violation of the created order but the unfolding of a potentiality placed within it by God from the beginning, meant to signify a unique event in salvation history.\n\n*   **The Fall:** Augustine did not teach that the Fall of man resulted in a structural change to the physical laws of the universe. Instead, he argued that it corrupted human nature, leading to what can be described as a \"second nature.\" This corruption manifested in changes to the natural human condition, such as the introduction of painful childbirth, which he saw as a consequence of sin. The alteration of human nature and its relationship with the created order after the Fall can be explained as a change in the functioning of the \"seminal reasons\" pertaining to humanity. Augustine suggested that God could have anticipated the Fall and embedded within creation the \"rationes seminales\" for the consequences that would follow.\n\nTherefore, Augustine's doctrine of \"rationes seminales\" provided a sophisticated theological and philosophical vocabulary to discuss divinely ordained changes within the natural order, encompassing both the singular miracle of the virgin birth and the lasting alterations to human nature resulting from the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
