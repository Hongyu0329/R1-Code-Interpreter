    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a single particle without any interactions. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to understanding the behavior of non-interacting systems and serves as a starting point for perturbative treatments of interacting systems.\n\nThe bare Green's function G₀ is defined for the non-interacting part of the Hamiltonian. In the context of many-body theory, it is often represented in the frequency-momentum domain. For a system of non-interacting fermions or bosons with discrete single-particle energy eigenstates labeled by momentum k (or other quantum numbers), the bare Green's function in the frequency (ω) domain is a diagonal matrix.\n\nThe explicit functional dependence is given by:\n\n***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)***\n\nHere:\n*   **G₀(k, ω)** is the bare Green's function for a particle with momentum k and frequency (energy) ω.\n*   **ϵ_k** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalue for the state with momentum k. This is the energy of the particle in the absence of any interactions.\n*   **ω** is the frequency variable that arises from the Fourier transform of the time-dependent Green's function.\n*   **δ** is an infinitesimal real number. Its sign determines the type of Green's function (retarded, advanced, or causal) and ensures proper causal behavior. For causal Green's functions, it is often written as *iδ* where δ is a positive infinitesimal.\n\nThis relationship can be understood through the spectral representation of the Green's function. For a non-interacting system, the spectral function is a sharp delta function peak at the single-particle energy ϵ_k. The Green's function is then the Hilbert transform of this spectral function, leading to the simple pole structure shown above.\n\nWithin the path integral formalism, the Green's function is calculated as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of field operators. For a non-interacting theory, the path integral can be evaluated exactly, yielding the above expression for the two-point Green's function (or propagator). The denominator, ω - ϵ_k, arises directly from the quadratic part of the action in the path integral, which corresponds to the non-interacting Hamiltonian. The term ϵ_k encapsulates the dynamics of the free particle as determined by its energy spectrum."
