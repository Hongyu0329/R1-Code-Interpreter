    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$. The upper bound is the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step argument to establish this bound:\n\n1.  **A connected metric space is separable.** A key theorem in topology states that any connected metric space possesses a countable dense subset, meaning it is separable. While there are examples of connected topological spaces that are not separable (like the co-finite topology on an uncountable set), the addition of a metric structure is a strong enough condition to guarantee separability. It is worth noting that some connected metric spaces are not locally connected, but this does not affect their separability.\n\n2.  **A separable metric space has a cardinality of at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$.** Let $X$ be a separable metric space and let $D$ be its countable dense subset. Each point in $X$ can be uniquely identified by its distances to all the points in the dense set $D$. More formally, we can define an injective (one-to-one) function $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}^{D}$, where $f(x)$ is the function that maps each $d \\in D$ to the distance between $x$ and $d$. Since $D$ is countable, we can identify it with the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$. Thus, there is an injection from $X$ into $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$, the space of all real-valued sequences. The cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ is $(2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. Therefore, the cardinality of $X$ is no more than $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThe properties of the dense open subset $U$ are consistent with this conclusion. Since $U$ is an open subset of a metric space, it is itself a metric space. The condition that every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$ means that $U$ is a topological n-manifold. A metrizable manifold must be paracompact, and a connected paracompact manifold is second-countable (has a countable base), which also implies it is separable and has a cardinality of at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$. The argument based on the separability of the entire space $X$ is more direct and does not depend on the connectedness of $U$.\n\nIn summary, the fact that $X$ is a connected metric space is sufficient to prove that it is separable. This, in turn, establishes an upper bound of $2^{\\aleph_0}$ on its cardinality.\n\n<<<There is an upper bound on the cardinality of X, which is the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
