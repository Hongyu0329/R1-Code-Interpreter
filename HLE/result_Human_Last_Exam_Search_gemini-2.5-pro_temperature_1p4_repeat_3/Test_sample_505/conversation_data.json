    "## Four Logical Qubits Can Be Encoded in Two Patches of Surface Code with Two Holes Each\n\nAt most, four logical qubits can be encoded in two separate patches of surface code where each patch has two holes. This is based on the principle that, under standard configurations, each hole or \"defect\" introduced into a surface code patch can encode one logical qubit.\n\nThe number of logical qubits that can be stored in a surface code is directly related to its topology. There are two primary methods for encoding multiple logical qubits: using multiple, distinct patches of surface code, or creating defects, commonly referred to as holes, within a single, larger patch.\n\nIn the defect-based approach, introducing holes into the fabric of the surface code creates additional logical degrees of freedom. For a planar surface code, which can be thought of as a sphere with punctures, the number of encoded logical qubits corresponds to the number of these holes. Specifically, a surface with 'b' closed holes can encode 'b' logical qubits. Therefore, a single patch of surface code containing two closed holes can encode two logical qubits. While some methods describe creating a pair of holes to define a single logical qubit, it is also established that for *N* logical qubits, one can create *N*+1 holes of the same type, suggesting a more flexible relationship. To maximize the number of qubits, the most direct interpretation is that each hole can encode one logical qubit.\n\nWhen using multiple patches, each patch functions as an independent container for logical qubits. To determine the total number of logical qubits across multiple patches, one simply sums the number of logical qubits encoded in each individual patch.\n\nConsequently, with two patches of surface code, and each patch having two holes, the calculation is as follows:\n\n*   **Logical qubits per patch:** 2\n*   **Number of patches:** 2\n*   **Total logical qubits:** 2 patches Ã— 2 logical qubits/patch = 4 logical qubits\n\nTherefore, a system of two surface code patches, each with two holes, can at most encode a total of four logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
