    "When viewed as matrices, the flags of **Benin**, **Madagascar**, and **Nigeria** have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\nThe flag of Denmark, featuring a white Nordic cross on a red field, is structurally composed of two distinct row patterns and two distinct column patterns. When values are assigned to the colors to maximize the rank, this structure results in a rank of 2. The flags of the following African nations share this same rank:\n\n*   **Benin:** The flag of Benin has a vertical green band and two horizontal bands of yellow and red. This design creates two unique types of rows, resulting in a rank of 2.\n*   **Madagascar:** Featuring a vertical white stripe and two horizontal stripes of red and green, the flag of Madagascar is structurally similar to that of Benin, giving it a rank of 2.\n*   **Nigeria:** The Nigerian flag consists of three vertical stripes, with the outer two being green and the central one white. This configuration results in only two distinct column types, and therefore the flag has a rank of 2.\n\nOther African flags either have simpler designs (rank 1, though none currently exist) or more complex designs featuring multiple stripes, symbols such as stars or emblems, or diagonal elements, which result in a higher rank. For instance, a simple tricolor flag with three different colored stripes (like that of Gabon or Sierra Leone) has a rank of 3.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, Nigeria>>>"
