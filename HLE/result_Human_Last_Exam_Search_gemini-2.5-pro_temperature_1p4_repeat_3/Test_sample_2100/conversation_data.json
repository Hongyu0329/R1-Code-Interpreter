    "The man Andrei Voznesensky dubbed \"a joy-discovering sailor\" was Nikolai Rezanov. The quest to find his final resting place, a central theme in Voznesensky's work, concluded in the late 20th century.\n\nVoznesensky's poem is part of the libretto for the immensely popular Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" which premiered in the early 1980s. The opera dramatizes the real-life story of Nikolai Rezanov, a Russian nobleman and explorer, and his tragic romance with Concepci처n Arg체ello, the daughter of the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco.\n\nRezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, on his return journey from Russian America in 1807. His original gravestone was destroyed by the Bolsheviks. For decades, the exact location of his remains was uncertain, prompting Voznesensky's poignant question, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".\n\nThe immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos\" revived public interest in Rezanov's story, leading to efforts to locate his final resting place. The answer to Voznesensky's question began to emerge in the late 1980s through historical research. While his remains were reportedly moved in the 1950s, the rediscovery and confirmation of his presumed burial site at the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk gained momentum during this period.\n\nThis renewed focus culminated in a symbolic ceremony in October 2000, where soil from the grave of Concepci처n Arg체ello in Benicia, California, was scattered over Rezanov's tomb, and earth from his grave was taken to hers, finally uniting the two lovers. A white cross now marks his grave, bearing lines from Voznesensky's poem.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
