    "### The Rank of the Néron-Severi Group of the 15th Symmetric Power of a Genus 3 Riemann Surface\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C (denoted as C¹⁵), is determined by the Néron-Severi rank of the Jacobian of C. The relationship is given by the formula ρ(Cᵈ) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1, which holds when the degree d is sufficiently large (specifically, d ≥ 2g - 1). In this case, with genus g=3 and degree d=15, the condition 15 ≥ 2(3) - 1 = 5 is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, ρ(Jac(C)).\n\n#### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe Néron-Severi rank of an abelian variety, such as a Jacobian, is at least 1, due to the existence of a polarization. For a \"very generic\" curve C of genus 3, its Jacobian Jac(C) is a simple abelian variety with endomorphism ring End(Jac(C)) being just the integers (ℤ). In this minimal case, the Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization, and its rank is 1.\n\nThus, the smallest possible rank for ρ(Jac(C)) is 1. This leads to the smallest possible rank for X:\nρ(X) = ρ(C¹⁵) = min(ρ(Jac(C))) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n#### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension g is bounded by g². For a genus 3 Jacobian, this means ρ(Jac(C)) ≤ 3² = 9. This maximum value is achieved for special curves whose Jacobians have extensive complex multiplication (CM).\n\nA prominent example is the Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ + z⁴ = 0, which is a non-hyperelliptic curve of genus 3. The Jacobian of the Fermat quartic is known to be isogenous to the product of three copies of an elliptic curve E with complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers ℤ[i] (i.e., Jac(C) ~ E³).\n\nThe Néron-Severi rank of a product of abelian varieties depends on the ranks of the individual components and the homomorphisms between them. For an abelian variety that is a product of three copies of a CM elliptic curve (E³), the rank is ρ(E³) = 9. This is because the rank of the endomorphism ring of a CM elliptic curve is 2, and ρ(E) = 1.\n\nSince the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic attains this maximum possible rank of 9, the largest possible rank for ρ(X) is:\nρ(X) = ρ(C¹⁵) = max(ρ(Jac(C))) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
