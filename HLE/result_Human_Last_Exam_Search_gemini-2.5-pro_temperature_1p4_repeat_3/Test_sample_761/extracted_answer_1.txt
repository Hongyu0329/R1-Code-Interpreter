No, polynucleotides, including homopolynucleotides, are not structurally polysaccharides due to fundamental differences in their monomeric units and the chemical bonds that link these units. Polynucleotides are composed of nucleotides (containing a phosphate group, a pentose sugar, and a nitrogenous base) linked by phosphodiester bonds, while polysaccharides are composed of monosaccharides (simple sugars) linked by glycosidic bonds.
