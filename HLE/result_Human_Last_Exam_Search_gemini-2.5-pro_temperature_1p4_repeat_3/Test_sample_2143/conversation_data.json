    "According to the interpretation described, the individual who addressed the issue of another's material possessions at the end of his work, while ignoring the prohibition against representation, is Jean-Luc Nancy.\n\nThe philosopher's extensive work on the deconstruction of Christianity frequently touches upon the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments). The \"prohibition against representation\" is a central theme in his thinking, particularly in relation to the divine. This concept is directly linked to the giving of the Ten Commandments, where the Israelites heard a voice but saw no form. The issue of \"another's material possessions\" is a clear reference to the Tenth Commandment, which forbids coveting a neighbor's property. Nancy's philosophical exploration of community, being-with-others, and the nature of the divine law encompasses these specific themes.\n\n<<<Jean-Luc Nancy>>>"
