    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes using a phosphorus ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent). In this specific reaction, the reactants are pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane.\n\n1.  **Reactants Analysis:**\n    *   **Pivalaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃CCHO. It is known for its bulky tert-butyl group.\n    *   **Wittig Reagent:** The name (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane describes a phosphorus ylide. The structure is Ph₃P=CHCH₂(C₆H₄Cl), where Ph is a phenyl group and (C₆H₄Cl) is a 2-chlorophenyl group. This type of ylide, with an alkyl group attached to the carbanion, is considered a non-stabilized ylide.\n\n2.  **Reaction and Product Formation:**\n    *   The core of the Wittig reaction involves the replacement of the carbonyl oxygen atom (C=O) of the aldehyde with the carbon group from the ylide (C=PPh₃).\n    *   The reaction between pivalaldehyde and the specified ylide results in the formation of a new carbon-carbon double bond. The resulting organic product has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n    *   The systematic IUPAC name for this product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The other product of the reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry:**\n    *   The stereochemistry of the alkene product (whether it is the E or Z isomer) is determined by the nature of the ylide.\n    *   Non-stabilized ylides, like the one used in this reaction, typically react under kinetic control to predominantly form the *Z*-alkene (cis isomer). This occurs because the transition state leading to the Z-isomer is sterically favored.\n    *   Therefore, the major product of this reaction is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The *E*-alkene (trans isomer) would be the minor product.\n\nThe final product from the Wittig reaction of pivalaldehyde with (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane is primarily (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
