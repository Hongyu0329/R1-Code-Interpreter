The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene results in cycloaddition products. Specifically, both [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition and [2+2] cycloaddition can occur, leading to a mixture of products. The Diels-Alder product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**. The [2+2] cycloaddition product is **4-ethenyl-1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluorocyclobutane**. The [2+2] pathway is particularly significant for reactions involving highly halogenated ethenes.
