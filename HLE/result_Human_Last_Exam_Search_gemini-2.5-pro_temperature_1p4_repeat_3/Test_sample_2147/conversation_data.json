    "Pavel Milyukov did not denounce a specific aspect of Western culture as a \"stagnant swamp.\" Instead, this phrase is attributed to him in a different context, describing what he perceived as the debilitating effect of a hot and still environment on \"eastern peoples.\"\n\nIn the chapter \"Acclimatization, the shifting science of settlement\" from the book *Peopling the Russian Periphery: Borderland Colonization in Eurasian History*, the author notes that Milyukov \"compared the still air to a stagnant swamp, claiming that 'eastern peoples' have a special love for flowing streams and gurgling waterfalls because of 'the burdensome sensation of complete stillness, stagnation â€“ in the absence of wind. Life is movement, and at is best is expressed through intensive, rhythmic movement. Any lasting stagnation or calm becomes unbearable.'\". The author continues to paraphrase Milyukov, stating that \"The stillness and the heat together cause indigenous residents to 'avoid any mental or physical exertion whatsoever,' rendering them as inert and unmoving as the air\".\n\nTherefore, the \"X-Y\" in the user's query does not refer to an element of Western culture but rather to **eastern peoples** or their supposed condition of **stillness and stagnation**. It is important to note that Milyukov was generally a \"convinced 'Westernizer'\" who admired the political values of democratic countries and advocated for Russia to follow a similar path of development as Western Europe. His criticisms were more frequently aimed at the autocratic tsarist regime for its inefficiency and resistance to modernization.\n\n<<<eastern peoples' stillness and stagnation>>>"
