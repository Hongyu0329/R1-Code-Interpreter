    "An analysis of the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ using the Newton polygon method with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v$ (normalized by $v(2)=1$) is required to determine the stable reduction of the curve $C$ given by the equation $z^2=f(x)$.\n\nThe vertices of the Newton polygon of $f(x)$ are determined by the points $(i, v(a_i))$, where $a_i$ are the coefficients of the polynomial. The coefficients are $a_5=2, a_3=2, a_0=1$. The corresponding points are $(5, v(2)=1)$, $(3, v(2)=1)$, and $(0, v(1)=0)$. The lower convex hull of these points consists of two segments: one from $(0,0)$ to $(3,1)$ with a slope of $1/3$, and another from $(3,1)$ to $(5,1)$ with a slope of $0$.\n\nAccording to the theory of Newton polygons, the valuations of the roots of the polynomial in the algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ are the negatives of the slopes of the segments of the Newton polygon. This implies that the polynomial $f(x)$ has three roots with valuation $-1/3$ and two roots with valuation $0$.\n\nA standard result in the theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves states that if the roots of the defining polynomial cluster into disjoint sets based on their valuations, the stable reduction of the curve will consist of multiple components. In this case, we have two clusters of roots:\n1.  A set $S_0$ of two roots with valuation 0. This cluster corresponds to a component of the stable reduction, $C_0$, of genus $g_0 = \\lfloor (2-1)/2 \\rfloor = 0$. This is a rational curve.\n2.  A set $S_{-1/3}$ of three roots with valuation $-1/3$. This corresponds to a component, $C_1$, of genus $g_1 = \\lfloor (3-1)/2 \\rfloor = 1$. This is an elliptic curve.\n\nThe genus of the original curve is $g = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$. The arithmetic genus of the special fiber of the stable model, $p_a(\\tilde{C})$, must be equal to the genus of the generic fiber, assuming the base field is algebraically closed (which can be achieved by a base change that does not affect the thickness). However, the stable reduction might involve a drop in genus, which is accounted for by the singularities of the special fiber.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of a stable curve $\\tilde{C}$ composed of components $C_i$ is given by the formula $p_a(\\tilde{C}) = \\sum_i g_i + N - k + 1$, where $N$ is the number of nodes (double points) and $k$ is the number of components.\nIn our case, the stable reduction consists of two components, $C_0$ and $C_1$, so $k=2$. Let's assume they intersect at $n$ ordinary double points. Then $N=n$. The formula becomes:\n$p_a(\\tilde{C}) = g_0 + g_1 + n - 2 + 1 = 0 + 1 + n - 1 = n$.\n\nFor a stable reduction, the arithmetic genus of the special fiber equals the genus of the generic fiber. Thus, $p_a(\\tilde{C})=g=2$.\nThis implies $n=2$.\nSo, the stable reduction consists of a rational curve and an elliptic curve intersecting at two points. For a stable curve, these singularities must be ordinary double points. An ordinary double point, by definition, is locally given by an equation of the form $xy=\\pi$, where $\\pi$ is a uniformizer of the valuation ring. The thickness of such a point is defined as $v(\\pi)$. Given that the valuation is normalized by $v(2)=1$, the minimal possible non-zero thickness is 1, which corresponds to an ordinary double point where $v(c)=1$ in the local equation $xy=c$. Therefore, the double points have a thickness of 1.\n\n"
