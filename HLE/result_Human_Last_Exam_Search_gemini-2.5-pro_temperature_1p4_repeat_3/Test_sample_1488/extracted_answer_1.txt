Based on the provided XRD data, the primary crystalline material is identified as **Zinc Oxide (ZnO)**, which has a **hexagonal wurtzite** crystal structure. The standard lattice constants for this structure are approximately **a = 3.25 Å** and **c = 5.21 Å**. It is crucial to note that the sample is likely a **mixture**, as several of the most intense peaks in the pattern are not attributable to ZnO.
