    "Here is the step-by-step solution to the number sequence puzzle.\n\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between consecutive terms.**\n    Let's see if there is a pattern based on multiplication and addition.\n    *   From 2 to 11: `2 * 2 + 7 = 11`\n    *   From 11 to 23: `2 * 11 + 1 = 23`\n    *   From 23 to 51: `2 * 23 + 5 = 51`\n    *   From 51 to 119: `2 * 51 + 17 = 119`\n\n2.  **Identify the pattern in the added numbers.**\n    The pattern is that each term is twice the previous term plus a certain number. Let's call the sequence of these added numbers `c_n`.\n    `c_n = {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}`\n    This sequence does not show an immediately obvious pattern.\n\n3.  **Re-evaluate the pattern starting from the second term.**\n    Let's ignore the relationship for the first term and look for a consistent pattern from the second term onwards.\n    *   `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`\n    *   `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`\n    *   `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`\n\n4.  **Find the pattern in the new sequence of added numbers.**\n    Let's call this new sequence of added numbers `d_n`.\n    `d_n = {1, 5, 17, ...}`\n    Now, let's find the difference between the terms in this new sequence.\n    *   `5 - 1 = 4`\n    *   `17 - 5 = 12`\n    The differences are `4, 12`. This forms a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 (since `4 * 3 = 12`).\n\n5.  **Calculate the next term in the sequence of differences.**\n    The next difference will be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the next term in the sequence of added numbers (`d_n`).**\n    The next term is found by adding the new difference to the last term of `d_n`.\n    *   Next `d_n` term = `17 + 36 = 53`.\n\n7.  **Calculate the next term in the original sequence.**\n    Now, apply the rule `next term = 2 * previous term + new added number`.\n    *   Next term = `2 * 119 + 53`\n    *   Next term = `238 + 53`\n    *   Next term = `291`\n\nTherefore, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
