    "I have started by searching for the definition of a semidihedral group and its power subgroups.\nThe search results provide the presentation of a semidihedral group SD_2^n as <r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2)-1)>. For the semidihedral group of size 512, we have 2^n = 512, so n=9. Thus, SD_512 has the presentation <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(127)>.\n\nA power subgroup H^q is defined as the subgroup generated by all q-th powers of elements in H. The elements of the semidihedral group SD_2^n are of the form r^i and r^i * s.\n\nI need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed by taking all elements to some power 'k'. These are the power subgroups. So I need to find the subgroups P_k = {g^k | g is in SD_512} for all possible integers k.\n\nThe search results do not directly provide a formula for the number of power subgroups of a semidihedral group. They discuss the structure of subgroups in general, properties of power subgroups in p-groups, and related graph theory concepts.\n\nTo proceed, I need to analyze the structure of SD_512 and its elements to determine the distinct power subgroups. I will need to consider the order of the elements and how the group operation affects the powers of elements.\n\nThe next steps should be:\n1.  List the elements of SD_512 and their orders.\n2.  For each integer k, determine the set of k-th powers of all elements in SD_512.\n3.  The set of k-th powers must form a subgroup. I need to find how many distinct such subgroups are there.\n\nLet's analyze the elements of SD_512. The group has a cyclic subgroup of order 256, <r>. The other 256 elements are of the form r^i * s.\n\nI will search for the element orders in semidihedral groups and information about their subgroup lattice. This should help in identifying the power subgroups.The search results from the first step provided the presentation of the semidihedral group SD_2^n. For the group of size 512, n=9, so we have SD_512 = <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(128-1) = r^127>.\n\nThe second step's search results give some information about the subgroup structure of semidihedral groups, for example for SD_16. It mentions that for SD_16, all proper subgroups are cyclic, dihedral, semidihedral or Klein four-groups. It also shows the subgroup lattice of SD_16. This gives a hint about the complexity of the subgroup structure.\n\nA power subgroup G^k is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements of G. So we need to compute {g^k | g in SD_512} for various integers k and see how many distinct subgroups they form.\n\nLet's analyze the elements of G = SD_512. The elements are of two types:\n1.  Powers of r: r^i for i = 0, 1, ..., 255. These form a cyclic subgroup <r> of order 256.\n2.  Elements of the form r^i * s for i = 0, 1, ..., 255.\n\nLet's compute the k-th power of these elements.\n- (r^i)^k = r^(ik)\n- (r^i * s)^2 = r^i * s * r^i * s = r^i * (s * r^i * s) = r^i * (r^(127i)) = r^(128i).\n- (r^i * s)^k?  This seems more complicated. Let's look at the order of elements r^i * s.\n(r^i * s)^2 = r^(128i). If i is even, say i=2j, then (r^(2j)s)^2 = r^(256j) = 1. So elements of the form r^(2j)s have order 2. There are 128 such elements.\nIf i is odd, say i=2j+1, then (r^(2j+1)s)^2 = r^(128(2j+1)) = r^(256j + 128) = r^128. This element r^128 has order 2. So (r^(2j+1)s)^4 = (r^128)^2 = r^256 = 1. These elements have order 4. There are 128 such elements.\n\nNow, let's consider the power subgroups G^k.\n- If k is odd, say k=2m+1:\n  - (r^i)^k = r^(ik). Since k is odd, gcd(k, 256) = 1. As i goes from 0 to 255, ik (mod 256) also covers all residues from 0 to 255. So { (r^i)^k | i=0..255} is still the entire cyclic group <r>.\n  - (r^j*s)^k = (r^j*s) since k is odd and (r^j*s)^2 is in the center. (r^j*s)^k = ((r^j*s)^2)^m * (r^j*s) = (r^(128j))^m * r^j*s.\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a simpler approach.\n\nA power subgroup is a fully characteristic subgroup, and therefore normal. The normal subgroups of SD_{2^n} are known.\nFor G = SD_{2^n}, the normal subgroups are:\n1.  The cyclic subgroups <r^(2^k)> for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1. (n-1 in this case as order of r is 2^(n-1))\n2.  The entire group G.\n3.  Three subgroups of index 2: <r>, D_{2^{n-1}} and Q_{2^{n-1}}. (This is for the maximal subgroups). For SD_16, the maximal subgroups are <r> (cyclic 8), D_8, and Q_8 (quaternion).\n\nLet's look at the power subgroups G^k = <g^k | g in G>.\n- G^2 = <g^2 | g in G>\n  - (r^i)^2 = r^(2i)\n  - (r^i*s)^2 = r^(128i)\n  The set of squares is {r^0, r^2, r^4, ..., r^254} U {r^0, r^128}. So G^2 = <r^2, r^128> = <r^2>. This is a cyclic group of order 128.\n- G^4 = <g^4 | g in G>\n  - (r^i)^4 = r^(4i)\n  - (r^i*s)^4 = (r^(128i))^2 = r^(256i) = 1.\n  So G^4 = <r^4>. This is a cyclic group of order 64.\n- G^(2^j) for j <= 8:\n  - (r^i)^(2^j) = r^(i*2^j)\n  - (r^i*s)^(2^j) = (r^(128i))^(2^(j-1)) = r^(i * 2^7 * 2^(j-1)) = r^(i * 2^(j+6)).\n  - For j=1, G^2 = <r^2, r^128> = <r^2>.\n  - For j=2, G^4 = <r^4, r^256> = <r^4>.\n  - For j=3, G^8 = <r^8, r^512> = <r^8>.\n  ...\n  - For j=8, G^256 = <r^256, r^(... bigger ...)> = {1}. This is the trivial subgroup.\n\nSo the power subgroups of the form G^(2^j) are:\nG^1 = G\nG^2 = <r^2>\nG^4 = <r^4>\nG^8 = <r^8>\nG^16 = <r^16>\nG^32 = <r^32>\nG^64 = <r^64>\nG^128 = <r^128>\nG^256 = {e}\n\nThis gives us 1 + 8 = 9 distinct power subgroups.\n\nWhat about G^k for other k?\n- If k is odd, k=2m+1.\n  - (r^i)^k = r^(ik). Since k is odd, gcd(k, 256)=1, so <(r^i)^k | i=0..255> = <r>.\n  - What about (r^j*s)^k? Let's check (r^j*s)^k. (r^j*s) * (r^j*s) = r^(128j). Let's see if s is in G^k. If we can get s, then since we have <r>, we would have the whole group G.\n  s is an element of G. Is s = g^k for some g in G?\n  If g = r^i, then (r^i)^k = r^(ik). This cannot be s.\n  If g = r^i*s, then (r^i*s)^k.\n  If k=3, (r^i*s)^3 = (r^i*s)^2 * (r^i*s) = r^(128i) * r^i*s = r^(129i)*s. Can this be s? If 129i is a multiple of 256, yes. But 129 is not a zero divisor mod 256. So 129i = 0 mod 256 implies i=0.  So (s)^3 = s.\n  If k is odd, then for s, we have s^k=s. So s is in G^k. We also have r^k = r. Since <r,s> generates G, if r and s are in G^k, then G^k=G.  Let's verify this. Since k is odd, there exists an integer l such that kl is congruent to 1 mod 256. Then r = r^(kl) = (r^l)^k is in G^k. Also s = s^k is in G^k. Hence, for any odd k, G^k = G.\n\n- If k is even, let k = 2^j * m, where m is odd.\n  - G^k = G^(2^j * m) = (G^m)^(2^j). Since m is odd, G^m=G. So G^k = G^(2^j).\n\nSo the only distinct power subgroups are G^(2^j) for j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\nThese are:\nG^1 = G = SD_512\nG^2 = <r^2> (Cyclic group of order 128)\nG^4 = <r^4> (Cyclic group of order 64)\nG^8 = <r^8> (Cyclic group of order 32)\nG^16 = <r^16> (Cyclic group of order 16)\nG^32 = <r^32> (Cyclic group of order 8)\nG^64 = <r^64> (Cyclic group of order 4)\nG^128 = <r^128> (Cyclic group of order 2)\nG^256 = <r^256> = {e} (Trivial group of order 1)\n\nThese are 9 distinct subgroups. I should double check my reasoning.\nThe set of power subgroups is {G^k | k is in Z}.\nLet P(G) be the set of power subgroups of G.\nLet k = 2^j * m with m odd.\nG^k = <g^k for g in G> = <g^(2^j*m) for g in G>.\nLet H = G^m = <h^m for h in G>. Since m is odd, the mapping x -> x^m is a bijection on any cyclic group of 2-power order. What about on SD_512?\nLet's re-examine (r^i*s)^m.\n(r^i*s)^m = (r^i*s) since m is odd and the element has order 2 or 4. No, this is not true in general.\n(r^i*s)^2 = r^(128i).\nIf m is odd, m=2l+1.\n(r^i*s)^m = ((r^i*s)^2)^l * (r^i*s) = (r^(128i))^l * (r^i*s) = r^(128il) * r^i * s = r^(i(128l+1))*s.\nLet's see the set G^m. It contains <r^m> = <r>. It also contains elements of the form r^(i(128l+1))*s. Since m is odd, 128l+1 is also odd and coprime to 256. So as i varies, i(128l+1) covers all residues mod 256. So {r^(i(128l+1))*s | i=0..255} is the set of all elements of the form r^j*s. So G^m contains <s>, and <r>. So G^m = G.\n\nThe reasoning seems to hold. The set of power subgroups is { G^(2^j) | j >= 0 }.\nThe subgroups are G, <r^2>, <r^4>, ..., <r^128>, <r^256>={e}.\nLet's check for what j these are distinct.\n|<r^(2^j)>| = 256 / gcd(2^j, 256) = 256 / 2^j = 2^(8-j).\nSo we have subgroups of orders 512, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.\nThese are for j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\nG^1 = G (order 512)\nG^2 = <r^2> (order 128)\nG^4 = <r^4> (order 64)\nG^8 = <r^8> (order 32)\nG^16 = <r^16> (order 16)\nG^32 = <r^32> (order 8)\nG^64 = <r^64> (order 4)\nG^128 = <r^128> (order 2)\nG^256 = <r^256> = {e} (order 1)\n\nThese are 9 distinct subgroups. The logic seems sound and I have re-checked it. I am ready to give the final answer.The semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD_512, has the presentation:\nSD_512 = <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(256/2 - 1) = r^127>\n\nA power subgroup of a group G, denoted as G^k, is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G. We need to find the number of distinct such subgroups for SD_512. The elements of SD_512 are of the form r^i and r^i * s for i in {0, 1, ..., 255}.\n\nLet's analyze the k-th power of these elements for an integer k.\n\nFirst, consider the case where k is odd.\n- For elements of the form r^i, the k-th power is (r^i)^k = r^(ik). Since k is odd, gcd(k, 256) = 1. As i ranges from 0 to 255, ik (mod 256) also ranges over all residues from 0 to 255. Therefore, the set of k-th powers of elements in the cyclic subgroup <r> is <r> itself.\n- For elements of the form r^i * s, we first compute their square: (r^i * s)^2 = r^i * s * r^i * s = r^i * (srs)^i * s^2 = r^i * (r^127)^i = r^i * r^(127i) = r^(128i). Since r^128 has order 2, it is in the center of the group. As k is odd, let k = 2m+1 for some integer m. Then (r^i * s)^k = (r^i * s)^(2m+1) = ((r^i * s)^2)^m * (r^i * s) = (r^(128i))^m * (r^i * s) = r^(128im) * r^i * s = r^(i(128m+1)) * s.\nSince G^k must contain all r^(ik) and all (r^i * s)^k, it contains <r> and the element s (by taking i=0 in the second case, we get s^k = s). The subgroup generated by <r> and s is the entire group SD_512. Thus, for any odd integer k, G^k = G.\n\nNow, consider the case where k is even. Let k = 2^j * m, where m is an odd integer and j >= 1.\nThen G^k = G^(2^j * m) = (G^m)^(2^j). As we've shown that for an odd integer m, G^m = G, we have G^k = G^(2^j).\nSo, we only need to find the number of distinct subgroups of the form G^(2^j) for j >= 0.\n\nLet's compute these subgroups:\n- For j=0, G^(2^0) = G^1 = G = SD_512.\n- For j=1, G^2 is the subgroup generated by the squares of all elements.\n  - The squares of elements r^i are r^(2i), generating the subgroup <r^2>.\n  - The squares of elements r^i*s are r^(128i), which are {1, r^128}. Since r^128 = (r^64)^2, this is already in <r^2>.\n  Thus, G^2 = <r^2>, which is a cyclic group of order 128.\n- For j=2, G^4 is the subgroup generated by the 4th powers of all elements.\n  - (r^i)^4 = r^(4i), generating <r^4>.\n  - (r^i*s)^4 = ((r^i*s)^2)^2 = (r^(128i))^2 = r^(256i) = 1.\n  Thus, G^4 = <r^4>, a cyclic group of order 64.\n- In general, for j >= 1, G^(2^j) is generated by { (r^i)^(2^j), (r^i*s)^(2^j) }.\n  - (r^i)^(2^j) = r^(i*2^j), which generates the subgroup <r^(2^j)>.\n  - (r^i*s)^(2^j) = ((r^(128i)))^(2^(j-1)) = r^(i*128*2^(j-1)) = r^(i*2^7*2^(j-1)) = r^(i*2^(j+6)). The subgroup generated by these elements is <r^(2^(j+6))>.\nSince <r^(2^(j+6))> is a subgroup of <r^(2^j)>, G^(2^j) = <r^(2^j)>.\n\nThe distinct power subgroups are of the form <r^(2^j)> for j = 0, 1, 2, ... and the entire group G.\nLet's list them:\n1.  j=0: G^1 = G = SD_512 (order 512). This is equivalent to <r^(2^0)> only in terms of generators but not the whole group, so we list it separately. Wait, G^(2^0) = G^1 which we established is G.\n2.  j=1: G^2 = <r^2> (order 128).\n3.  j=2: G^4 = <r^4> (order 64).\n4.  j=3: G^8 = <r^8> (order 32).\n5.  j=4: G^16 = <r^16> (order 16).\n6.  j=5: G^32 = <r^32> (order 8).\n7.  j=6: G^64 = <r^64> (order 4).\n8.  j=7: G^128 = <r^128> (order 2).\n9.  j=8: G^256 = <r^256> = {e} (the trivial subgroup of order 1).\nFor j > 8, G^(2^j) will also be the trivial subgroup.\n\nSo the distinct power subgroups are:\nG, <r^2>, <r^4>, <r^8>, <r^16>, <r^32>, <r^64>, <r^128>, {e}.\nThere are a total of 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
