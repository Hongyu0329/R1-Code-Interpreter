    "This sequence is based on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard, with a special rule for letters typed by the same finger.\n\nThe standard bottom row of letters on a QWERTY keyboard is Z, X, C, V, B, N, M.\n\nThe pattern is created as follows:\n1.  The sequence starts by following the letters on the bottom row of the keyboard.\n2.  The first letters are **Z, X, C, V**.\n3.  A special rule is applied when two consecutive letters in the base sequence are typed by the same finger in standard touch-typing. The letter 'V' and the next letter 'B' are both typed with the left index finger.\n4.  When this occurs, a letter from the top row, typed by the corresponding finger of the *opposite* hand, is inserted. In this case, the opposite hand is the right hand, and its index finger types the letter **Y**.\n5.  After inserting 'Y', the sequence continues with the letter from the bottom row, which is **B**.\n6.  The next letter on the bottom row is **N**. The previous letter 'B' is typed by the left index finger and 'N' is typed by the right index finger. Since the fingers are different, no letter is inserted.\n7.  This gives the sequence presented in the question: **Z, X, C, V, Y, B, N**.\n8.  To find the next letter, we look at the next letter in the keyboard sequence, which is 'M'. 'M' is typed with the right index finger, the same finger used for the previous letter 'N'.\n9.  According to the rule, a letter must be inserted. This letter is from the top row, typed by the opposite (left) hand's corresponding finger (index). This letter is **T**.\n\nTherefore, the next letter to appear in the sequence is T.\n\n<<<T>>>"
