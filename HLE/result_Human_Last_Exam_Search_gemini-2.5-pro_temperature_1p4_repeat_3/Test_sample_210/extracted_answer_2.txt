Between 1803 and 1823, it is estimated that several thousand destitute migrants settled in the Talbot Settlement, likely numbering between 10,000 and 15,000 people by the end of this period. Colonel Thomas Talbot's personal land claim grew to be over 60,000 acres larger than his original 5,000-acre grant.
