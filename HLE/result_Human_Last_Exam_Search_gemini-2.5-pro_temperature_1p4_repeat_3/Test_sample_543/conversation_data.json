    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide in refluxing THF, followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the substitution of all three halogen atoms with phenyl groups. This type of reaction is a Kumada cross-coupling, which typically uses a nickel or palladium catalyst, but can proceed without one under forcing conditions (reflux) and with reactive halides.\n\nThe reactivity of the carbon-halogen bonds towards the Grignard reagent is in the order of I > Br > Cl. Therefore, the reaction proceeds in the following steps:\n1.  The iodine atom at the C-2 position is the most reactive and is substituted first by a phenyl group to yield 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n2.  The two equivalent bromine atoms at the C-1 and C-3 positions are then substituted by phenyl groups in the presence of excess Grignard reagent and heat.\n3.  The final product is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\nThe aqueous work-up serves to quench any remaining Grignard reagent and protonate the intermediate magnesium salts to yield the final neutral organic product.\n\nThe IUPAC name for the resulting product is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene. This is confirmed by multiple chemical databases which also list it under other names such as 2'-Phenyl-m-terphenyl.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
