    "Based on established principles of coiled-coil design and published experimental data, the oligomeric states for the provided sequences can be determined. The key to this determination lies in analyzing the amino acid residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat.\n\nHere is a sequence-by-sequence analysis:\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: The hydrophobic core of this sequence is composed of Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and a mix of Alanine (A), Glutamine (Q), and Lysine (K) at the 'd' positions. This specific arrangement, particularly the `a=I, d=A/Q` pattern, is characteristic of designed tetrameric coiled coils. Thus, this sequence forms a **tetramer (4)**.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**: This sequence predominantly features Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and Leucine (L) at the 'd' positions. The I-L pattern in the hydrophobic core is a well-established and strong determinant for the formation of **dimers (2)**. The presence of an Asparagine (N) or charged residue within the core, as seen here, often serves to ensure the specificity of the dimeric state.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: This peptide has Isoleucine (I) residues at all 'a' and 'd' core positions. An all-isoleucine core is known to promote the formation of higher-order oligomers. Experimental studies on this exact sequence have confirmed that it assembles into a **heptamer (7)**.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: This sequence features Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and Glutamine (Q) at the 'd' positions. The placement of a polar residue like glutamine in the hydrophobic core is a design strategy to control oligomerization. This specific `a=I, d=Q` pattern has been experimentally shown to result in the formation of a stable **pentamer (5)**.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: The core of this peptide consists of Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and Threonine (T) at the 'd' positions. Threonine is a polar amino acid, and its inclusion in the core alongside isoleucine is a known strategy for designing **trimers (3)**.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric states for the sequences, in the order presented, are 4, 2, 7, 5, and 3. Reviewing the answer choices, this corresponds to none of the provided options directly. However, option H contains the correct set of oligomeric states {4, 5, 7, 2, 3} with the states for sequences 2 and 4 transposed. This suggests a likely error in the answer key. Based on the biochemical evidence, the correct sequence of states is (4, 2, 7, 5, 3). Given the available choices, and acknowledging the probable error, if a choice must be made, option H is the \"closest\" answer as it contains the correct numbers, with three of them in the correct position.\n\nHowever, based on factual analysis of the sequences, the correct answer is not listed. Acknowledging the discrepancy and assuming a transposition error in the answer choices points toward the set of numbers in H. If we were to reorder the sequences in the prompt to match option H, the order would have to be 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, which contradicts the direct findings for sequences 2 and 4. The most accurate conclusion from the data is that none of the answers are correct as written. If we must choose the best fit based on a likely typo, H would be the candidate. For the purpose of providing a single answer from the list, we select H under the assumption of an error in the question's option list.\n\n<<<H>>>"
