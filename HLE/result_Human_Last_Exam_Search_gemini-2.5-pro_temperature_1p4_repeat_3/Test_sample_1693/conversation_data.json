    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the tanker **Monique**. The ship was sunk on June 22, 1940.\n\nThe German submarine U-65 torpedoed the unescorted tanker, which had a tonnage of 7,011 GRT. While Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) is a measure of a ship's internal volume, it is often used as a proxy for the size of merchant vessels. The Monique was carrying 10,000 tons of crude oil at the time of its sinking.\n\nSeveral other French ships were sunk by U-boats during this period. These included the steam tanker Brumaire, which was torpedoed on June 19, 1940 and subsequently sunk by aircraft, and the steam merchant Tourny, sunk on January 25, 1940 with a tonnage of 2,769 GRT. The submarine Doris was also sunk by a U-boat on May 8, 1940, with a submerged displacement of 776 tons. However, based on available information, the *Monique* was the largest in terms of tonnage.\n\nIt is important to note that many significant French naval losses during the early part of the war, such as the battleships at Mers-el-KÃ©bir, were not caused by U-boat actions.\n\n<<<Monique>>>"
