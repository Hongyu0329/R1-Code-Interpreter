    "A smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex surface (a real 4-manifold). Its homotopy groups can be analyzed using tools from algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of the rank of its third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X)$:\n\n1.  **Topological Properties from Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem**: The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem relates the topology of a submanifold to the ambient space. For a smooth complex surface $X$ inside $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ for $k < 2$.\n    *   Since $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, it follows that $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. This means $X$ is simply connected.\n\n2.  **Homology Groups**: For a simply connected space, the Hurewicz theorem provides a close link between homotopy and homology groups.\n    *   The Betti numbers of a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ are well-known: $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_2=53, b_3=0, b_4=1$.\n    *   Since there is no torsion, the integral homology groups are $H_0(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, $H_1(X) = 0$, $H_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$, $H_3(X) = 0$, and $H_4(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3.  **Second Homotopy Group**: Because $X$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X) = 0$), the Hurewicz theorem states that the Hurewicz map $h: \\pi_2(X) \\to H_2(X)$ is an isomorphism.\n    *   Therefore, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n\n4.  **Third Homotopy Group**: For a simply connected space, there is a fundamental exact sequence in algebraic topology relating the third homotopy group to the third homology group, due to J.H.C. Whitehead:\n    $$ \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X)) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to H_3(X) \\to 0 $$\n    Here, $\\Gamma$ is Whitehead's quadratic functor.\n    *   From the Betti numbers, we know that $H_3(X) = 0$.\n    *   Substituting this into the sequence gives: $\\Gamma(\\pi_2(X)) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0$.\n    *   This implies that the map from $\\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))$ to $\\pi_3(X)$ is surjective. In fact, for a simply-connected 4-manifold, it is known that this map is an isomorphism, so $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\Gamma(\\pi_2(X))$.\n\n5.  **Computing the Rank**: The group $\\pi_3(X)$ is therefore isomorphic to $\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^{53})$. For a free abelian group $A = \\mathbb{Z}^k$, the group $\\Gamma(A)$ is also a free abelian group. Its rank is given by the formula:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\Gamma(\\mathbb{Z}^k)) = k + \\binom{k}{2} = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} $$\n    *   In our case, $k = \\text{rank}(\\pi_2(X)) = 53$.\n    *   Plugging this value into the formula:\n        $$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = 53 + \\binom{53}{2} = 53 + \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 53 + 53 \\times 26 = 53 \\times (1+26) = 53 \\times 27 $$\n    *   $53 \\times 27 = 1431$.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1431. Note that the object in question is different from the more commonly studied quintic threefold in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$, which is a Calabi-Yau manifold.\n\n<<<1431>>>"
