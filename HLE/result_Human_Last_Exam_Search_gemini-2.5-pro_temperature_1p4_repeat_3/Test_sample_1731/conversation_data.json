    "### Large Deviation Theorems Illuminate Equilibrium in Photon Gas\n\nThe equilibrium properties of a photon gas, specifically its entropy and mean energy, can be fundamentally understood through the lens of large deviation theory, employing the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These mathematical frameworks, which quantify the probabilities of rare events, provide a powerful way to derive the well-known results of Bose-Einstein statistics for light quanta from first principles.\n\nA recent study from 2025 has demonstrated how these theorems can be applied to a Bose gas of photons, successfully reproducing the foundational results of Bose and Planck. This approach connects the statistical concept of large deviations to the thermodynamic properties of the photon gas at equilibrium.\n\n#### The Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem and Entropy\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is concerned with the probability of an empirical distribution deviating from a true underlying distribution. In the context of a photon gas, we consider the distribution of indistinguishable photons across various energy states or \"cells\". The theorem states that the probability of observing a particular distribution of photons decreases exponentially with the number of photons, and the rate of this decay is given by the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the observed and the true equilibrium distribution.\n\nIn a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, the system will be found in its most probable macroscopic configuration. According to the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, this corresponds to the distribution that minimizes the large deviation rate function, which in turn maximizes the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy. This entropy is directly proportional to the natural logarithm of the probability of the spatial distribution of the photons. By maximizing this entropy under the constraint of the total energy of the system, one can derive the equilibrium distribution of photons, which is the celebrated Planck's law for black-body radiation. The equilibrium entropy itself is then calculated from this distribution.\n\n#### The Cramer-Chernoff Theorem and Mean Energy\n\nThe Cramer-Chernoff theorem complements the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem by focusing on the large deviations of the *sum* of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. In the case of a photon gas, the total energy of the system can be considered as the sum of the energies of individual photons, which are treated as random variables. The theorem provides an exponential bound on the probability that the total energy will deviate significantly from its mean value.\n\nA key element in the Cramer-Chernoff theorem is the moment-generating function, which, in the context of statistical mechanics, is equivalent to the partition function. By applying the Cramer-Chernoff theorem, one can establish an upper bound on the probability of fluctuations in the total energy. The equilibrium state is the one where the probability of large deviations is minimized. The mean energy of the photon gas at equilibrium is then determined as the expected value of the energy distribution that minimizes this large deviation probability. This procedure, which can involve the use of Lagrange multipliers to incorporate the system's constraints, leads to the well-known Stefan-Boltzmann law, where the mean energy of a photon gas is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature.\n\nIn essence, the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding why a photon gas settles into the specific equilibrium state described by Bose-Einstein statistics. The principle of minimizing large deviations naturally leads to the maximization of entropy, which is the cornerstone of the second law of thermodynamics.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta are found by applying the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem to the distribution of photons across energy states, where maximizing the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy yields the equilibrium distribution and thus the entropy of the system. Concurrently, the Cramer-Chernoff theorem is applied to the total energy of the photon gas, treated as a sum of random variables, where the minimization of the large deviation probability, linked to the partition function, determines the mean energy at equilibrium.>>>"
