The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta are found by applying the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem to the distribution of photons across energy states, where maximizing the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy yields the equilibrium distribution and thus the entropy of the system. Concurrently, the Cramer-Chernoff theorem is applied to the total energy of the photon gas, treated as a sum of random variables, where the minimization of the large deviation probability, linked to the partition function, determines the mean energy at equilibrium.
