    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, specifically in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, the non-trivial fixed point for the coupling constant, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, can be determined using the renormalization group. The leading order expression for this fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is found by calculating the beta function for the coupling and identifying its non-trivial zero.\n\nThe beta function, which describes the running of the coupling constant `u` with the energy scale, is given to the leading order in `u` and ϵ by:\nβ(u) = -ϵu + Bu²\n\nHere, `B` is a positive constant that depends on the specific conventions used for defining the coupling and performing the momentum shell integration. A common convention leads to B = 3.\n\nTo find the fixed point coupling u*, we set the beta function to zero:\nβ(u*) = -ϵu* + B(u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions:\n1.  u* = 0, which corresponds to the trivial Gaussian fixed point.\n2.  u* = ϵ / B, which is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nUsing the common convention where B=3, the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling is:\nu* = ϵ / 3\n\nThis result is fundamental in the theory of critical phenomena, providing a starting point for the ϵ-expansion to calculate critical exponents. It is important to note that the numerical factor can vary depending on the normalization of the coupling constant.\n\n<<<u* = ϵ/3>>>"
