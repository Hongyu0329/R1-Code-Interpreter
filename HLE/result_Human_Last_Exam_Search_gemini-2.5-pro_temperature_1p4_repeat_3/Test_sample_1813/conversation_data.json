    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first need to understand the relationship between these numbers and continued fractions.\n\nThe generalized Markov numbers, in the context of the work by E. Banaian and A. Sen, are integers that form solutions to the Diophantine equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + xz + yz = 6xyz\\). These numbers are indexed by rational numbers \\(p/q\\) in the interval.\n\nThe specific generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is computed using the continued fraction of the reciprocal of the index, i.e., \\(q/p\\). The value of \\(m_{p/q}\\) is the continuant of the coefficients of the continued fraction of \\(q/p\\).\n\nThe continued fraction associated with \\(m_{p/q}\\) is therefore the continued fraction expansion of \\(q/p\\).\n\nFor the given generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we have \\(p=4\\) and \\(q=7\\). The associated rational is \\(7/4\\).\n\nWe compute the continued fraction of \\(7/4\\) using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\(7 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 3\\)\n    \\item \\(4 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1\\)\n    \\item \\(3 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 0\\)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe coefficients of the continued fraction are the quotients from these divisions: 1, 1, and 3.\n\nThus, the continued fraction expansion of \\(7/4\\) is:\n\\[ \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}} \\]\nIn standard notation, this is written as \\([1; 1, 3]\\).\n\nFor completeness, we can also compute the value of the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\) itself. It is the continuant of the coefficients \\((1, 1, 3)\\):\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\(K() = 1\\)\n    \\item \\(K(1) = 1\\)\n    \\item \\(K(1, 1) = 1 \\cdot K(1) + K() = 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 = 2\\)\n    \\item \\(K(1, 1, 3) = 3 \\cdot K(1, 1) + K(1) = 3 \\cdot 2 + 1 = 7\\)\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\) is 7. The continued fraction associated with it is the continued fraction of \\(7/4\\).\n\n<<<[1; 1, 3]>>>"
