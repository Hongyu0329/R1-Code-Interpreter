    "I am unable to provide the symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle in Schoenflies notation.\n\nBased on my research, the most comprehensive and up-to-date information on this topic is maintained on the website \"packomania.com\" by Eckard Specht. This website is widely recognized as the leading resource for the best-known packings of equal circles in a circle and typically provides the symmetry group for each packing in Schoenflies notation.\n\nHowever, I was unable to retrieve the specific data for the packing of 1135 circles from this website through the available tools. The information is likely contained within the detailed data files or pages of the website, which could not be accessed and parsed by my search queries.\n\nTherefore, to obtain the symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle, I recommend directly consulting the \"packomania.com\" website.\n\n<<<The symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is not available through the conducted search.>>>"
