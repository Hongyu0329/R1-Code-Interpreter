    "### Opened Single-Dose Ampules Must Be Used Immediately\n\nOnce a single-dose glass ampule is opened in a sterile environment, it must be used immediately and cannot be stored for any period. This is a critical distinction from single-dose vials, which have a different set of guidelines for their beyond-use date (BUD).\n\nAccording to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards, opened single-dose ampules are not to be stored. This is because, unlike vials which have a resealable rubber stopper, ampules are open to the air once broken, which increases the risk of contamination.\n\nFor single-dose *vials* punctured in a sterile environment, such as an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, the guidelines are different. In this case, the vial may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture, provided it is maintained under appropriate storage conditions. If a single-dose vial is punctured in an environment with an air quality lower than ISO Class 5, it must be discarded within one hour.\n\nIt is important to note that some guidelines, such as those from the National Association of Pharmacy Regulatory Authorities (NAPRA) in Canada, have stipulated a 6-hour BUD for single-use vials punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment. However, for ampules, the guidance is consistently for immediate use only.\n\nTherefore, the beyond-use date for a single-dose container *ampule* from the time of puncture in a sterile environment is immediate.\n\n<<<immediate use only>>>"
