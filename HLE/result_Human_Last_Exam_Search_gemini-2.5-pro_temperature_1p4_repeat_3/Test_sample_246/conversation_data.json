    "The minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of \\(S^4\\) over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is 2.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\nFirst, we identify the space in question. We are considering the double branched cover of the 4-sphere, \\(S^4\\), where the branching occurs over a specific embedded 2-sphere known as the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil. Let's denote this 2-knot by \\(K\\). The resulting 4-manifold is the double branched cover, which we can call \\(\\Sigma(S^4, K)\\).\n\nThe key to determining the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of \\(\\Sigma(S^4, K)\\) lies in first understanding the fundamental group of the complement of the knot in \\(S^4\\), which is denoted \\(\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)\\). For the 5-twist-spun trefoil, this group has been identified. It is the direct product of the binary dodecahedral group and the integers, \\(\\text{SL}(2,5) \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\). The binary dodecahedral group, also known as the special linear group \\(\\text{SL}(2,5)\\), is a finite group of order 120.\n\nThe fundamental group of the double branched cover, \\(\\pi_1(\\Sigma(S^4, K))\\), can be obtained from the fundamental group of the knot complement by taking a quotient. Specifically, one divides \\(\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)\\) by the normal closure of the square of a meridian element. A meridian is a loop that circles the knot. In the case of the direct product structure \\(\\text{SL}(2,5) \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\), a meridian corresponds to a generator of the \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) factor.\n\nLet \\(t\\) be a generator of the \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) factor. To find the fundamental group of the double branched cover, we must quotient \\(\\text{SL}(2,5) \\times \\mathbb{Z}\\) by the relation \\(t^2=1\\). Since this is a direct product, the relation only affects the \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) component, turning it into the cyclic group of order 2, \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\). Therefore, the fundamental group of the double branched cover is \\(\\text{SL}(2,5) \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\).\n\nThe final step is to determine the minimal number of generators for the group \\(\\text{SL}(2,5) \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\).\n*   The special linear group \\(\\text{SL}(2,5)\\) is a perfect group, meaning it is equal to its own commutator subgroup. It is a known result that \\(\\text{SL}(2,5)\\) can be generated by 2 elements.\n*   The cyclic group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) is generated by 1 element.\n\nFor a direct product of a perfect group \\(G\\) and a cyclic group \\(H\\), the minimal number of generators of \\(G \\times H\\) is equal to the minimal number of generators of \\(G\\), provided that \\(d(G) \\ge 2\\). Since \\(\\text{SL}(2,5)\\) is a perfect group that requires 2 generators, the minimal number of generators for \\(\\text{SL}(2,5) \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\) is also 2.\n\nWe can demonstrate this explicitly. Let \\(g_1, g_2\\) be the two generators for \\(\\text{SL}(2,5)\\) and let \\(h\\) be the generator for \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\). Consider the two elements \\((g_1, h)\\) and \\((g_2, 1)\\) in \\(\\text{SL}(2,5) \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\). The subgroup generated by these two elements contains their commutators, such as \\(([g_1, g_2], 1)\\). Since \\(\\text{SL}(2,5)\\) is perfect, it is generated by its commutators, so the subgroup contains all elements of the form \\((g, 1)\\) where \\(g \\in \\text{SL}(2,5)\\). Furthermore, the element \\((g_1, h) \\cdot (g_1^{-1}, 1) = (1, h)\\) is also in the subgroup. Since the subgroup contains all of \\(\\text{SL}(2,5) \\times \\{1\\}\\) and \\(\\{1\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\), it generates the entire group \\(\\text{SL}(2,5) \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2\\). Thus, two generators are sufficient. Since \\(\\text{SL}(2,5)\\) cannot be generated by a single element, the minimal number of generators is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
