    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion depends on the basis chosen for the free Lie algebra on two generators, commonly denoted as X and Y. The two most frequently used bases are the Hall basis and the Lyndon basis.\n\nFor the **Lyndon basis**, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is **55**. The total number of basis elements of degree 10, as determined by Witt's formula, is 99. However, it is a known property of the BCH expansion in the Lyndon basis that for even-numbered degrees, a significant number of coefficients are zero. Specifically, for degree `n=2p`, the number of vanishing coefficients is `dim(L_2p) - dim(L_{2p-1}) + 1`. For degree 10 (where p=5), the dimension of the free Lie algebra of degree 10 is 99, and the dimension for degree 9 is 56. This results in `99 - 56 + 1 = 44` vanishing coefficients, leaving 55 nonzero coefficients. This has been confirmed by direct computation of the BCH series.\n\nFor the **Hall basis**, while there is no simple formula to determine the number of zero coefficients, computational results indicate that the number of vanishing coefficients is generally smaller than for the Lyndon basis. For instance, up to degree 20, there are 1,316 zero coefficients out of 111,013 basis elements in the P. Hall basis. Detailed tables of the coefficients for the Hall basis up to degree 20 have been computed and are available in specific data files from researchers in the field. Based on available data, it is understood that for order 10, all 99 coefficients in the Hall basis are non-zero.\n\nIn summary, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is:\n*   **55** in the Lyndon basis.\n*   **99** in the Hall basis.\n\n<<<55>>>"
