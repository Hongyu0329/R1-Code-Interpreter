    "### Including Negro Leagues, 27 Players Have Won the Batting Triple Crown in MLB History\n\nIn Major League Baseball (MLB), a player is said to have won the batting Triple Crown when they lead their league in three key offensive categories: batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI) in a single season. This is a rare and celebrated achievement in baseball history.\n\nHistorically, the number of Triple Crown winners has been cited differently, but with the official integration of Negro Leagues statistics by MLB in May 2024, the total number of recognized batting Triple Crown winners is 27. These 27 players have accomplished the feat a total of 28 times.\n\nThe decision by MLB to incorporate the statistics of seven Negro Leagues that operated between 1920 and 1948 has rightfully added several legendary players to the list of Triple Crown winners. This move has been widely praised as a significant step in recognizing the immense talent and accomplishments of players who were barred from playing in the American and National Leagues.\n\nPrior to this decision, only players from the American League (AL) and National League (NL) were included in the official tally.\n\nHere is the complete list of MLB's recognized batting Triple Crown winners:\n\n| Year | Player | Team | League |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1878 | Paul Hines | Providence Grays | NL |\n| 1887 | Tip O'Neill | St. Louis Browns | AA |\n| 1894 | Hugh Duffy | Boston Beaneaters | NL |\n| 1901 | Nap Lajoie | Philadelphia Athletics | AL |\n| 1909 | Ty Cobb | Detroit Tigers | AL |\n| 1912 | Heinie Zimmerman | Chicago Cubs | NL |\n| 1921 | Oscar Charleston | Homestead Grays | NNL |\n| 1922 | Rogers Hornsby | St. Louis Cardinals | NL |\n| 1923 | Heavy Johnson | Kansas City Monarchs | NNL |\n| 1924 | Oscar Charleston | Harrisburg Giants | ECL |\n| 1925 | Rogers Hornsby | St. Louis Cardinals | NL |\n| 1926 | Mule Suttles | St. Louis Stars | NNL |\n| 1930 | Willie Wells | St. Louis Stars | NNL |\n| 1933 | Chuck Klein | Philadelphia Phillies | NL |\n| 1933 | Jimmie Foxx | Philadelphia Athletics | AL |\n| 1934 | Lou Gehrig | New York Yankees | AL |\n| 1936 | Josh Gibson | Pittsburgh Crawfords | NNL |\n| 1937 | Joe Medwick | St. Louis Cardinals | NL |\n| 1937 | Josh Gibson | Homestead Grays | NNL |\n| 1942 | Ted Williams | Boston Red Sox | AL |\n| 1942 | Ted Strong | Kansas City Monarchs | NAL |\n| 1942 | Lennie Pearson | Newark Eagles/Homestead Grays | NNL |\n| 1947 | Ted Williams | Boston Red Sox | AL |\n| 1956 | Mickey Mantle | New York Yankees | AL |\n| 1966 | Frank Robinson | Baltimore Orioles | AL |\n| 1967 | Carl Yastrzemski | Boston Red Sox | AL |\n| 2012 | Miguel Cabrera | Detroit Tigers | AL |\n\nNotably, four players have won the award multiple times: Oscar Charleston (3), Rogers Hornsby (2), Josh Gibson (2), and Ted Williams (2).\n\nThe most recent player to achieve the Triple Crown is Miguel Cabrera in 2012, who ended a 45-year drought in the American and National Leagues.\n\nIt's also worth noting that a Pitching Triple Crown exists, awarded to a pitcher who leads their league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA).\n\n<<<27>>>"
