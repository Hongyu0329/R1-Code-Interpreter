In summary, the minimal resources required to classically simulate the POVM correlations on a singlet state are, on average per measurement pair:
*   **Two bits of classical communication**, if communication is the only allowed resource besides shared randomness.
*   **One non-signaling PR-Box and zero bits of communication**, if such non-local boxes are allowed as a resource.
