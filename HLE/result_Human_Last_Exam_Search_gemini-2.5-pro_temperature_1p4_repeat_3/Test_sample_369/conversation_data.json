    "An analysis of the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago\" from Lucretius' *De Rerum Natura* reveals a specific metrical pattern. To determine this pattern, each syllable must be identified as either long or short based on vowel quantity and position, and any elisions (the dropping of a syllable) must be accounted for.\n\nThe scansion of the line is as follows:\n\n*   **Foot 1:** The first foot is a dactyl (long-short-short). This is formed from \"ver(um) ubi,\" where the \"-um\" of \"verum\" is elided before the vowel of \"ubi.\"\n*   **Foot 2:** The second foot is a spondee (long-long).\n*   **Foot 3:** The third foot is a spondee (long-long).\n*   **Foot 4:** The fourth foot is a spondee (long-long).\n*   **Foot 5:** The fifth foot is a dactyl (long-short-short), which is the most common pattern for this foot in hexameter.\n*   **Foot 6:** The final foot is a spondee (long-long).\n\nTherefore, the scansion of the entire line is:\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
