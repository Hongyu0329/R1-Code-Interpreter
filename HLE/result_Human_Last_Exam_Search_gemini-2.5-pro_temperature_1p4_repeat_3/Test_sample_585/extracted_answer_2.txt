The post-reset covariance Σ' is computed from the pre-reset covariance Σ using the following exact expression:

Σ' = G * Σ * G<sup>T</sup>

where G is the block matrix:

G = | exp(-Δ)  0 |
    |    0      I |

Here:
*   **exp(-Δ)** is the matrix exponential of the negative of the skew-symmetric matrix Δ associated with the attitude deviation δ used for the reset.
*   **I** is the identity matrix of appropriate dimensions for any other states in the filter that are not the attitude deviation.
*   **0** are zero matrices of appropriate dimensions.

This results in the updated covariance matrix:

Σ' = | exp(-Δ) * Σ<sub>δδ</sub> * exp(-Δ)<sup>T</sup>   exp(-Δ) * Σ<sub>δx</sub> |
     | Σ<sub>xδ</sub> * exp(-Δ)<sup>T</sup>                  Σ<sub>xx</sub>          |

where Σ<sub>δδ</sub> is the covariance of the attitude deviation, Σ<sub>xx</sub> is the covariance of the other states, and Σ<sub>δx</sub> and Σ<sub>xδ</sub> are the cross-covariance terms.
