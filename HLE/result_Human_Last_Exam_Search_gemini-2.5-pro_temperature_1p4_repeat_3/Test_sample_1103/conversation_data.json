    "The number of negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48 is 1,132. This information is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A046125, which lists the number of negative fundamental discriminants for each class number. The data in this sequence is based on the work of Mark Watkins, who computed the class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields up to 100.\n\n<<<1132>>>"
