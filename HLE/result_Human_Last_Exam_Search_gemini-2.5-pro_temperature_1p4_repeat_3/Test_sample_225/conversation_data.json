    "The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are integers, can be determined using a standard formula.\n\nThe curve is given by:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nHere, a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nFor a Lissajous curve to be a closed curve, the ratio of the frequencies a/b must be a rational number. In this case, 9/5 is rational. The curve traces its complete path over the interval t in [0, 2Ï€].\n\nThe number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve, where 'a' and 'b' are relatively prime integers (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), is given by the formula:\nN = (1/2) * (a - 1) * (b - 1)\n\nFirst, we check if a=9 and b=5 are relatively prime. The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is 1, so they are relatively prime.\n\nNow, we can apply the formula:\nN = (1/2) * (9 - 1) * (5 - 1)\nN = (1/2) * 8 * 4\nN = (1/2) * 32\nN = 16\n\nThis formula counts the number of self-intersection points within the interior of the bounding box [-1, 1] x [-1, 1].\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
