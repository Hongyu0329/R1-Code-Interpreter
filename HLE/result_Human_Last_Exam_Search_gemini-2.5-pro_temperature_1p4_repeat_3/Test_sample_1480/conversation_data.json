    "In fuzzy logic, the \"rule activation level,\" also known as the firing strength, quantifies the degree to which the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of a fuzzy rule is satisfied for a given input. When a rule's antecedent consists of multiple conditions joined by a logical \"AND,\" a mathematical operator known as a t-norm (triangular norm) is used to combine the membership degrees of each condition.\n\nThe problem is set in the context of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, which represents a high level of complexity designed to handle significant uncertainty. However, the inputs provided, `Phi_k(x′)=0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`, are precise numerical values (scalars). This suggests a simplified problem that focuses on the fundamental operation of combining antecedent truth values. Assuming that these two values represent the membership degrees for two antecedent conditions of a single rule, the overall activation level is found by applying a t-norm to them.\n\n`Activation Level = t-norm(0.7, 0.9)`\n\nThe specific t-norm to use is not mentioned, and different t-norms will yield different results. The most common t-norms used in fuzzy systems are the **minimum** and **product** operators.\n\n1.  **Using the Minimum (or Gödel) t-norm**: This is the most widely used t-norm and is calculated as the minimum of the values.\n    *   Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n2.  **Using the Product t-norm**: This t-norm is also frequently used and is calculated by multiplying the values.\n    *   Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nWithout further specification, the most standard interpretation would default to the minimum t-norm due to its widespread use and conservative nature in representing the logical \"AND\" operation.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
