    "An exact count of the *sissone fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, cannot be determined from available text-based descriptions and reviews.\n\nReviews of the 2014 production praise Svetlana Zakharova's technical skill and her portrayal of Odette/Odile. They often highlight the quality of her extensions, the fluidity of her movements, and her overall stage presence. The Grigorovich production is noted for its psychological interpretation and some choreographic and structural differences from other versions.\n\nWhile there are detailed analyses and reviews of the performance, none provide a step-by-step breakdown or a count of specific ballet movements for the Odette variation. Such a precise number could only be obtained by visually analyzing a recording of the specified performance, a capability not available through text-based search tools.\n\n<<<The specific number of sissone fermes cannot be provided as it requires visual analysis of the performance.>>>"
