The set of values $\theta$ for which companies with more truthful accounts choose more lenient auditors is the set of all $\theta$ in the interval $(0, 1)$ such that the firm's penalty $F(\theta)$ is greater than its tax liability $t(\theta)$, and for which there exists a less truthful firm (type $\theta'$ where $\theta' < \theta$) whose penalty $F(\theta')$ is less than its tax liability $t(\theta')$. Formally, this set is given by: $\{\theta \in (0, 1) \mid F(\theta) > t(\theta) \text{ and } \exists \theta' \in [0, \theta) \text{ such that } F(\theta') < t(\theta')\}$.
