    "There are 28 edge squares on a standard 8x8 chessboard. This includes all the squares on the first and eighth ranks, and the first and eighth files.\n\nThe maximum number of bishops that can be placed on an 8x8 chessboard so that no two bishops attack each other is 14. The problem assumes that the two players succeeded in placing this maximum number of bishops on the edge squares.\n\nTherefore, 14 bishops are occupying 14 of the edge squares.\n\nTo find the number of edge squares that would lack bishops, we subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares:\n\nNumber of empty edge squares = (Total edge squares) - (Number of bishops)\nNumber of empty edge squares = 28 - 14\nNumber of empty edge squares = 14\n\nThus, if two people succeeded in placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares of a chessboard, 14 edge squares would lack bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
