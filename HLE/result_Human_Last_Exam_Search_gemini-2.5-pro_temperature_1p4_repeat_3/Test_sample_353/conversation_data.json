    "To determine the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme, we need to analyze the stability region of the method.\n\nA numerical method is defined as A($\\alpha$)-stable if its region of absolute stability, $S$, contains the angular sector $W_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha, z \\ne 0\\}$. The boundary of the stability region for a k-step BDF method is given by the set of complex numbers $\\mu(z) = \\sum_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{1}{j}(1-z^{-1})^j$ for all $z$ on the unit circle, i.e., $|z|=1$. For the BDF4 method, k=4.\n\nThe angle $\\alpha$ is the maximum angle such that the wedge $W_\\alpha$ is part of the stability region. For BDF methods of order greater than 2, the stability region is the exterior of the curve defined by $\\mu(z)$. Therefore, we need to find the tangent to this curve that passes through the origin. The angle $\\alpha$ is then the angle this tangent makes with the positive real axis (or its negative, depending on the specific definition of the angle). Following standard literature, $\\alpha$ is given by the maximum of $|\\arg(\\mu(z))|$. This is equivalent to finding the maximum of the tangent of this angle, which is given by $p = \\frac{\\text{Im}(\\mu)}{-\\text{Re}(\\mu)}$.\n\nThe boundary curve can be parameterized using the rational transformation $z^{-1} = \\frac{1-it}{1+it}$, where $t=\\tan(\\phi/2)$ and $\\phi = \\arg(z)$. Let $\\mu(t) = u(t) + iv(t)$. The function to maximize is $p(t) = \\frac{v(t)}{-u(t)}$. According to the work of Gander and Wanner, \"Exact BDF stability angles with maple\", this can be found by solving for the roots of the derivative of $p(t)$.\n\nFor BDF4, the real and imaginary parts of $\\mu(t)$ can be expressed as:\n$u(t) = \\text{Re}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{j} \\left(1 - \\frac{1-it}{1+it}\\right)^j\\right) = \\frac{2t^2(11t^6 + 25t^4 + 15t^2 - 3)}{3(t^2+1)^4}$\n$v(t) = \\text{Im}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{j} \\left(1 - \\frac{1-it}{1+it}\\right)^j\\right) = \\frac{4t(6t^6 + 17t^4 + 12t^2 - 1)}{3(t^2+1)^4}$\n\nThe function whose maximum we seek is $p(t) = \\frac{v(t)}{-u(t)} = -\\frac{2(6t^6 + 17t^4 + 12t^2 - 1)}{t(11t^6 + 25t^4 + 15t^2 - 3)}$. By letting $T=t^2$, we can see that the square of this function, $p^2$, is a rational function of $T$.\n\nThe critical points are found by setting the derivative of $p(t)$ to zero. The numerator of the derivative, after simplification, has factors $(t^2-3)$ and $(11t^4+3t^2-25)$. This gives the positive values for $t^2$ as $T_1 = 3$ and $T_2 = \\frac{-3+\\sqrt{1109}}{22}$.\n\nEvaluating the angle for both these values, it is found that the smaller angle corresponds to the accepted stability angle for BDF4. This occurs at $T_0 = t_0^2 = \\frac{-3+\\sqrt{1109}}{22}$.\n\nThe value of $\\alpha$ is therefore $\\arctan(|p(t_0)|)$. Substituting $T_0$ into the expression for $p(t)$ leads to a complex algebraic expression. The problem is to express $\\tan^2(\\alpha)$ in a compact form in terms of $T_0$. The denominator of $p(t)$, $D(t) = t(11t^6 + 25t^4 + 15t^2 - 3)$, can be simplified at $T_0$. Let $D_T = 11T^3+25T^2+15T-3$. This can be written as $D_T = T(11T^2+3T-25) + 22T^2+40T-3$. At $T_0$, since $11T_0^2+3T_0-25=0$, the expression simplifies to $22T_0^2+40T_0-3$.\n\nAfter a significant amount of algebraic simplification, the exact expression for the tangent of the angle can be found.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{24(1777-41\\sqrt{1109})}{(113+\\sqrt{1109})^2}}\\right)$>>>"
