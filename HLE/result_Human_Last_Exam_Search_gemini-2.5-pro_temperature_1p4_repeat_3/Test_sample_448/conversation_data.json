    "In 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was **radon**. This conclusion is based on a comparison of the total abundance of each naturally occurring noble gas within the Earth's different reservoirs.\n\nThe primary reservoir for the noble gas xenon is the atmosphere. The Earth's atmosphere has a total mass of approximately 5.15 x 10^18 kg, and xenon constitutes about 0.086 parts per million by volume. This results in a total atmospheric mass of xenon of about 2.03 gigatonnes (2.03 x 10^12 kg).\n\nRadon, on the other hand, is a radioactive noble gas that is continuously produced by the decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is estimated to be 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram. The Earth's crust has a mass of about 2.77 x 10²² kg. This leads to a total estimated mass of radon in the crust of approximately 1.1 x 10⁴ kg at any given time.\n\nWhile other noble gases like helium, neon, argon, and krypton are more abundant than both xenon and radon, a direct comparison of the total terrestrial mass of xenon and radon reveals the rarity of radon.\n\nTo express these as a percentage of the total mass of the Earth (approximately 5.972 x 10²⁴ kg):\n\n*   **Xenon:** The percentage of xenon in the Earth's total mass is roughly 3.4 x 10⁻¹¹ %.\n*   **Radon:** The percentage of radon in the Earth's total mass is approximately 1.85 x 10⁻¹⁹ %.\n\nDue to its extremely low concentration and radioactive nature with a short half-life, radon is significantly rarer than xenon when considering the entire mass of the Earth. It should also be noted that oganesson, the heaviest noble gas, is a synthetically produced element and does not occur naturally on Earth, thus it is not considered in this context. The abundance levels of these gases have not significantly changed since 2002.\n\n<<<radon>>>"
