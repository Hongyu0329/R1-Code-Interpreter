    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **suster**.\n\nThe current English word \"sister\" is a product of linguistic blending. The original Old English word for a female sibling was **sweostor** (with regional variations like *swuster*). Following the Norse invasions, this native word was influenced by the Old Norse equivalent, **systir**.\n\nThis interaction is most noticeable in the vowel change. The \"i\" in the modern word \"sister\" is a direct result of the influence from the Old Norse \"systir\". Without this Norse contact, the Old English *sweostor* or *swuster* would have evolved naturally into the Middle English word **suster**. This is the form that existed in English dialects with less Scandinavian influence.\n\nAssuming a natural phonetic progression into Modern English, \"suster\" would have likely retained its spelling. The pronunciation of the \"u\" would probably mirror that in words like \"cut\" or \"dull.\" Therefore, in an alternate linguistic timeline without Norse influence, English speakers would refer to their female siblings as \"suster.\"\n\n<<<suster>>>"
