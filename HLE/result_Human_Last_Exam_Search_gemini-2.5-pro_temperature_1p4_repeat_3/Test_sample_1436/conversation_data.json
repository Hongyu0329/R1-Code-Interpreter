    "The symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram depends on its specific topology. The description \"a Feynman diagram featuring two vertices and four field contractions\" is ambiguous, as it can refer to several different diagrams. The most common context for such a question is a scalar field theory with a quartic interaction term (a φ⁴ theory), where each vertex has four field lines. A \"field contraction\" corresponds to a propagator (a line) in the diagram. A diagram with two vertices and four propagators would therefore be a second-order vacuum diagram.\n\nAssuming the most direct interpretation, where the four fields at one vertex all contract with the four fields at the second vertex, the diagram consists of two vertices connected by four propagators.\n\nThe symmetry factor, S, is the number of permutations of the diagram's internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram unchanged. For this topology:\n\n1.  **Permutation of Propagators:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical. They can be permuted in 4! (4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24) ways without changing the diagram.\n2.  **Permutation of Vertices:** The two vertices are also indistinguishable. They can be swapped, which introduces a factor of 2.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these individual symmetry operations:\nS = (Number of line permutations) × (Number of vertex permutations)\nS = 4! × 2 = 24 × 2 = 48\n\nThis can be confirmed by considering the combinatorial factors in the perturbative expansion of the Green's function. The term corresponding to this diagram appears in the expansion with a numerical prefactor of 1/S. For a φ⁴ theory with interaction Lagrangian L_int = (λ/4!)φ⁴, the second-order term in the S-matrix expansion is (1/2!) * [(-iλ/4!) ∫d⁴x φ⁴]². The number of Wick contractions that form this specific topology is 4!. The overall numerical factor is therefore (1/2!) * (1/4!)² * 4! = 1/(2 * 4!) = 1/48. The symmetry factor is the inverse of this, S = 48.\n\nIt is important to note that other diagram topologies also fit the description of having two vertices and four propagators. For example, a \"double-scoop\" diagram where two propagators connect the vertices and each vertex has a single loop also exists. This diagram has a different symmetry factor (S=16). However, the topology with four direct connections is the most literal interpretation of the query.\n\n<<<48>>>"
