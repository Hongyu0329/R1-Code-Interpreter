    "The 1956 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, *Around the World in 80 Days*, was the first film to hold that honor and feature a Luxor Obelisk on-screen. While the film is known for its extensive use of international locations, it includes scenes filmed in Paris that capture the iconic Place de la Concorde, where the Luxor Obelisk is a prominent landmark.\n\nPrior to this, the 1951 Best Picture winner, *An American in Paris*, featured a celebrated ballet sequence with elaborate sets inspired by the works of French painters. One of these sets was a stylized recreation of the Place de la Concorde. This sequence, designed in the style of Raoul Dufy, included a mock-up of the fountain in the square. Although this earlier film depicted the location of the obelisk, it was in a representational, studio-set form.\n\n*Around the World in 80 Days*, however, utilized actual location filming in Paris, offering audiences a direct view of the city's famous sites, including the genuine Luxor Obelisk standing in the Place de la Concorde. This makes it the first Best Picture winner to depict the actual monument. The film's global travelogue narrative provided the opportunity to showcase numerous world landmarks, with the Parisian obelisk being one of the notable inclusions.\n\n<<<Around the World in 80 Days (1956)>>>"
