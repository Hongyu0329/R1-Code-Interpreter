    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), two isomers are formed.\n\nThe reaction involves the substitution of the two chloride ligands in *cis*-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂] by the bidentate ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptztz). The resulting product is the complex ion [Ru(bpy)₂(dptztz)]²⁺.\n\nThis complex is an octahedral tris-chelate of the type [M(AA)₂(BB)]²⁺, where both 'bpy' (bipyridine) and 'dptztz' are symmetric bidentate ligands. In this type of complex, where three bidentate ligands are coordinated to a central metal atom, geometric isomerism (such as *cis*/*trans* or *fac*/*mer*) is not possible.\n\nHowever, the overall structure is chiral, meaning it is not superimposable on its mirror image. This gives rise to a pair of optical isomers, known as enantiomers. These enantiomers are designated as delta (Δ) and lambda (Λ).\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces two distinct isomers:\n*   Δ-[Ru(bpy)₂(dptztz)]²⁺\n*   Λ-[Ru(bpy)₂(dptztz)]²⁺\n\nThese chiral complexes are often synthesized as a racemic mixture, containing equal amounts of both the Δ and Λ enantiomers.\n\n<<<2>>>"
