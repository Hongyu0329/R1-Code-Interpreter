    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the combination of yellow and blue produces the color green. The range on this circle between green and blue itself corresponds to the musical note **G**.\n\nNewton devised his color wheel by associating the seven colors of the visible spectrum with the notes of a musical scale. He used the Dorian mode, which begins on the note D. In this system, the color red is associated with D, orange with E, yellow with F, green with G, blue with A, indigo with B, and violet with C, completing the octave back at D. Therefore, the color green, which lies between yellow and blue, is assigned the musical note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
