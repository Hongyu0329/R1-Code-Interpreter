    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 0.\n\nThe space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G(3, 5)$. The integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, is a finitely generated abelian group for each degree, and thus the entire ring is as well.\n\nAn abelian group can be decomposed into a free part and a torsion part. The torsion subgroup consists of all elements of finite order. Studies of the cohomology of real Grassmannians have shown that their integral cohomology rings are not free of torsion; specifically, they contain elements of order 2 (also known as 2-torsion).\n\nThe rank of an abelian group $A$ is a well-defined mathematical concept. It is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring the group with the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. That is, $\\text{rank}(A) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nLet $T$ be the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring. By definition, for any element $t \\in T$, there exists a non-zero integer $n$ such that $nt=0$. In the tensor product $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$, this element $t$ corresponds to $t \\otimes 1$. We can write $t \\otimes 1 = t \\otimes (n \\cdot \\frac{1}{n}) = (nt) \\otimes \\frac{1}{n} = 0 \\otimes \\frac{1}{n} = 0$.\n\nThis shows that every element of the torsion subgroup becomes the zero element in the vector space $T \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$. Consequently, this vector space is the zero-dimensional vector space. The dimension of a zero-dimensional vector space is 0. Therefore, the rank of the torsion subgroup is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
