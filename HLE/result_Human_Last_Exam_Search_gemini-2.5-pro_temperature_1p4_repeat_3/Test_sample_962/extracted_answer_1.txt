A tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol can be effectively designed using the principles found in the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) protocol. The design process involves two primary phases: a distributed key generation (DKG) phase and a two-round signing phase.

**1. Distributed Key Generation (DKG):**
To avoid a single point of failure, the private key is generated collaboratively by all *n* participants without any single party ever knowing the entire key. This is typically achieved using a Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme, like Feldman's VSS, built upon Shamir's Secret Sharing. Each of the *n* participants holds a secret share of the private key, and a single, collective public key is established for the group.

**2. Two-Round Signing Protocol:**
When at least *t* participants agree to sign a message, they execute the following two rounds:

*   **Round 1: Commitment.** Each participating signer generates one or more secret random numbers called nonces and broadcasts a public commitment to these nonces. This step is critical to prevent certain types of forgery attacks, as it forces each participant to lock in their contribution before seeing the contributions of others.
*   **Round 2: Signature Share Generation.** The signature coordinator (or aggregator) collects the commitments from all participants and distributes them. Each participant then computes their individual signature share using their private key share, their secret nonces, and a binding value derived from the message and all participants' commitments. This share is then sent to the aggregator.

Finally, the aggregator collects at least *t* valid signature shares and combines them into a single, valid Schnorr signature. This final signature is indistinguishable from a standard, single-party Schnorr signature and can be verified with the group's public key.

**Security Guarantees:**
This design, when properly implemented, provides "tight security" by ensuring:
*   **Unforgeability:** It is computationally infeasible for an adversary who has corrupted up to *t-1* participants to forge a signature on a new message.
*   **Concurrency Security:** Multiple signing sessions can run in parallel without compromising the security of the scheme.
*   **No Single Point of Failure:** The distributed nature of the key generation and signing process means the compromise of a single participant (or up to *t-1* participants) does not compromise the entire system.

This two-round structure significantly enhances efficiency, especially in network-constrained environments, as the first round can often be performed offline as a pre-computation step, making the latency-sensitive online portion a single round. While FROST is based on the discrete logarithm problem, similar design principles are being applied to lattice-based schemes to achieve post-quantum se
