    "The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of a class of sets measures its expressive power. In the context of logic, it refers to the VC dimension of the collection of sets definable by the formulas in that logic.\n\nThe schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, let's call them $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. The logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ allows formulas to be built using these predicates, existential quantification ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants for true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n\n### 1. Identifying the Concept Class\n\nA formula $\\phi(x)$ in this logic with one free variable $x$ defines a set of elements in a given model. A model consists of a universe $U$ and interpretations for the four predicates, which are subsets of the universe, denoted $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4 \\subseteq U$.\n\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ in this fragment can be shown to be equivalent to a formula of the form $\\alpha(x) \\land \\beta$, where:\n*   $\\alpha(x)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving the free variable $x$, i.e., of the form $P_{i_1}(x) \\land \\dots \\land P_{i_m}(x)$.\n*   $\\beta$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables).\n\nIn a given model, the sentence $\\beta$ is either true or false.\n*   If $\\beta$ is true, the set defined by $\\phi(x)$ is the same as the set defined by $\\alpha(x)$. The set defined by $\\alpha(x)$ is the intersection of the predicate interpretations: $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n*   If $\\beta$ is false, the set defined by $\\phi(x)$ is the empty set.\n\nThe formula $\\top$ defines the entire universe (which can be seen as an empty intersection), and $\\bot$ defines the empty set. Therefore, for any given model, the class of definable sets is a subset of the collection of all possible intersections of the base predicate sets $\\{S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4\\}$. This collection is known as the intersection-closed class generated by $\\{S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4\\}$.\n\n### 2. Upper Bound on the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension is the size of the largest set that can be shattered. A set $Y$ is shattered by a class of concepts $\\mathcal{C}$ if for every subset $Y' \\subseteq Y$, there is a concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}$ such that $Y \\cap C = Y'$.\n\nLet $k=4$ be the number of predicates. In any model, the number of distinct concepts that can be formed by intersections of the four predicate sets is at most $2^4 = 16$, since there are $2^4$ subsets of the four predicates to form intersections from.\n\nIf a set $Y$ of size $d$ is shattered, the concept class must be able to generate all $2^d$ subsets of $Y$. This implies that the number of available concepts must be at least $2^d$. Therefore, we must have:\n$2^d \\le 16$\nThis gives us $d \\le 4$. Thus, no set of size greater than 4 can be shattered, which means the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n### 3. Lower Bound on the VC Dimension\n\nTo establish a lower bound, we must show that there exists a model and a set of size 4 that is shattered by the definable formulas.\n\nLet's construct such a model. Let the universe be a set of four elements, $Y = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$. We define the interpretation of the four predicates on this universe as follows:\n*   $S_1 = Y \\setminus \\{y_1\\} = \\{y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$\n*   $S_2 = Y \\setminus \\{y_2\\} = \\{y_1, y_3, y_4\\}$\n*   $S_3 = Y \\setminus \\{y_3\\} = \\{y_1, y_2, y_4\\}$\n*   $S_4 = Y \\setminus \\{y_4\\} = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3\\}$\n\nNow, consider an arbitrary subset $Y' \\subseteq Y$. We want to show that there is a formula in our logic that defines exactly $Y'$. Let $I = \\{i \\mid y_i \\notin Y'\\}$. Consider the formula $\\phi_I(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. This formula is in the allowed fragment.\n\nThe set defined by this formula is the intersection of the corresponding predicate sets:\n$\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} (Y \\setminus \\{y_i\\}) = Y \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I} \\{y_i\\} = Y \\setminus \\{y_i \\mid y_i \\notin Y'\\} = Y'$.\n\nThis shows that for any subset $Y'$ of $Y$, we can construct a formula in the logic that defines it. Thus, the set $Y$ is shattered. Since $|Y|=4$, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the lower bound ($\\ge 4$) and the upper bound ($\\le 4$), we conclude that the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
