    "The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is most commonly achieved by heating xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gases in a 1:5 molar ratio within a nickel container. This direct reaction is typically carried out at approximately 400°C. Temperature ranges from 350°C to 450°C are also cited as effective for this process.\n\nWhile 400°C is a widely recognized temperature for efficient production, other temperatures and methods have been explored. For instance, flow methods can be used in a range of 300-500°C. Higher temperatures, such as 600°C, have also been reported. The key to the synthesis is that an equilibrium exists between xenon difluoride (XeF₂), xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄), and xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). Lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of XeF₂, while higher temperatures and an excess of fluorine favor XeF₆.\n\nThere are methods that operate at significantly lower temperatures. However, their efficiency can be a concern. For example, using an electric discharge allows for synthesis at temperatures as low as -78°C, but this can result in a mixture of xenon fluorides and may have low productivity.\n\nA Russian patent describes a combustion method for producing XeF₄. This process involves initiating the reaction between xenon and fluorine with a high-temperature pulse from a combustion initiator heated to 650-700°C. Following this initiation, the reactor wall is heated to a much lower temperature of 70-80°C. This method is reported to be a high-yield, single-stage process, producing XeF₄ with 97-98% purity, which indicates it is an efficient method.\n\nGiven the answer choices, 78°C is the coldest temperature for which an efficient production method has been documented.\n\n<<<D>>>"
