    "The search for a Hollywood feature film from a major studio depicting a teenager on a pink bicycle pedaling directly toward an oncoming car has not yielded a definitive match. Extensive searches have been conducted, and no film fitting this specific and detailed scene has been identified.\n\nSeveral iconic films feature memorable bicycle scenes, such as *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, *Breaking Away*, and *The Goonies*, but none include the precise sequence described. Similarly, movies known for \"game of chicken\" scenes, like *Rebel Without a Cause* and *Footloose*, involve cars and tractors, not a bicycle.\n\nSearches for coming-of-age films with defiant female protagonists and movies where a pink bicycle is a significant element have also not uncovered the scene in question. It is possible that the film is not a major Hollywood production, is a lesser-known movie, or that the details of the scene are remembered slightly differently.\n\nWithout a direct match from available film databases and scene descriptions, it is not possible to name a specific Hollywood feature film that contains this exact scene.\n\n<<<No definitive film matching the detailed description could be found.>>>"
