    "A total of 19 distinct finite groups possess maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3. This is based on the complete classification of such groups by Chimere Stanley Anabanti and Sarah Hart, who demonstrated that any such group must have an order of 24 or less. Their work confirmed that a comprehensive list compiled for groups up to this order is indeed complete.\n\nThe finite groups that contain these product-free sets are:\n*   **Abelian Groups (6):**\n    *   Cyclic groups: C6, C8, C9, C12\n    *   Direct products: C2 × C2, C3 × C3\n\n*   **Non-Abelian Groups (13):**\n    *   Dihedral groups: D6 (isomorphic to S3), D8, D10, D12 (isomorphic to S3 × C2)\n    *   Dicyclic (or generalized quaternion) groups: Q8, Q12, Q16, Q20, Q24\n    *   The alternating group: A4\n    *   The special linear group: SL(2,3)\n    *   Direct products: C2 × Q8, C3 × S3\n\nIt is important to note the isomorphisms between some of these groups to arrive at the correct count. The dihedral group of order 6, D6, is isomorphic to the symmetric group S3. The cyclic group C6 is isomorphic to the direct product C2 × C3. The dihedral group of order 12, D12, is isomorphic to the direct product D6 × C2, which in turn is isomorphic to S3 × C2. Accounting for these equivalences ensures that each of the 19 groups listed is distinct.\n\n<<<19>>>"
