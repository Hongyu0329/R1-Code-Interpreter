    "After a comprehensive analysis of the concepts of higher dimensional rooted forests, simplicial collapse, and the specific topology of the Möbius band, it is clear that the problem lies at the intersection of combinatorial and algebraic topology. The failure of a forest to simplicially collapse onto its root is a topological obstruction.\n\nFor the Möbius band, this obstruction is fundamentally linked to its non-trivial first homology group, H₁(M, ℤ) = ℤ, which represents the single non-contractible loop, the \"central circle,\" of the band.\n\nA higher-dimensional forest *F* is a subcomplex of the triangulation that does not contain any 2-cycles. As the second homology group of the Möbius band is trivial (H₂(M, ℤ) = 0), any collection of 2-simplices (triangles) from its triangulation forms a valid forest.\n\nA simplicial complex is collapsible to a point only if it is contractible. A forest *F* on the Möbius band will be non-contractible if it inherits the topology of the band itself, meaning it must contain a cycle of triangles that covers the central non-contractible loop. Any forest that does not fully contain such a cycle can be deformed and collapsed.\n\nThe core of the question lies in how many distinct rooted forests `(F, R)` exhibit this non-collapsible nature. The non-collapsibility stems from a single topological feature: the generator of the first homology group. Minimal triangulations of the Möbius band are themselves non-contractible forests. For instance, the entire triangulation of the band is a spanning 2-forest. This forest is not collapsible to a single vertex root because it is not contractible.\n\nWhile the precise number depends on the specific definitions of \"standard triangulation\" and \"root,\" the question points towards a fundamental combinatorial invariant. In the theory of higher-dimensional trees and forests, there is often a correspondence between the number of certain combinatorial objects and the dimension of topological features or the order of torsion subgroups in homology.\n\nThe topological obstruction to collapsibility for the Möbius band is entirely captured by its single non-trivial 1-cycle. The most natural answer, reflecting this unity of the underlying topological obstruction, is 1. This corresponds to the single \"way\" a forest can wrap around the band and become non-collapsible.\n\n<<<1>>>"
