    "In the given chess position, with the FEN 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1, both sides playing optimally, White's best move is to capture the black queen. This forces an exchange, leading to a pawn endgame that is winning for White.\n\nThe move is:\n**Qxc5+**\n\nThis move is decisive. After Black recaptures with their b-pawn (bxc5), the resulting position simplifies into a pawn endgame. In this new scenario, White's passed d-pawn, combined with the more active positioning of the White king, creates a winning advantage. White's king can effectively support its own passed pawn while simultaneously neutralizing Black's pawn threats on the queenside. Any other move by White would allow Black to maintain counterplay and potentially lead to a draw or a more complicated, less favorable position for White.\n\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
