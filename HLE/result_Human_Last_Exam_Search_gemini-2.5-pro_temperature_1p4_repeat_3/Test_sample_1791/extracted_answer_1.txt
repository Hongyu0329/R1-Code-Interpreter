For a given wavevector **q**, the effective electron-electron interaction potential $V_{eff}$, mediated by phonons, is given by:
$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, i\nu_n) = g^2 \frac{|\mathbf{q}|^2}{m} \frac{1}{\nu_n^2+\omega_q^2}$
where $\nu_n$ is the bosonic Matsubara frequency, $\omega_q$ is the phonon frequency, $g$ is the coupling constant, and $m$ is the mass. This interaction is attractive since the overall sign is positive (in the convention where a negative potential is attractive). In the static limit ($\nu_n=0$), the interaction becomes $V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}) = g^2 \frac{|\mathbf{q}|^2}{m\omega_q^2}$.
