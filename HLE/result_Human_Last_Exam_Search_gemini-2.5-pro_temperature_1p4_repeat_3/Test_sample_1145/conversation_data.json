    "The problem asks for the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box within the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the energy state n=2.\n\nFirst, let's establish the foundational formulas. The wavefunction, ψ(x), for a particle in a one-dimensional box of length 'a' is given by:\n\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nThe probability density of finding the particle at a specific position is the square of the wavefunction, |ψ(x)|²:\n\nP(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n\nTo find the probability of the particle being in a specific interval [x₁, x₂], we need to integrate the probability density function over that interval:\n\nProbability = ∫[x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx = ∫[x₁ to x₂] (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a) dx\n\nFor this specific problem, we are given:\n*   The quantum number, n = 2 (which corresponds to the first excited state).\n*   The interval is from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a.\n\nSo, the integral we need to solve is:\n\nProbability = ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the trigonometric identity: sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2.\n\nApplying this, our integral becomes:\n\nProbability = ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * [1 - cos(4πx/a)]/2 dx\nProbability = (1/a) ∫[0.495a to 0.505a] (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\n\nNow, we perform the integration:\n\nProbability = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a.\n\nLet's evaluate this at the upper and lower limits:\n\n*   At x = 0.505a: (1/a) * [0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π * 0.505a / a)] = 0.505 - (1/4π)sin(2.02π)\n*   At x = 0.495a: (1/a) * [0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π * 0.495a / a)] = 0.495 - (1/4π)sin(1.98π)\n\nSubtracting the lower limit from the upper limit:\n\nProbability = [0.505 - (1/4π)sin(2.02π)] - [0.495 - (1/4π)sin(1.98π)]\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\n\nUsing the properties of sine, where sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ) and sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ), we can simplify the terms:\n\n*   sin(2.02π) = sin(2π + 0.02π) = sin(0.02π)\n*   sin(1.98π) = sin(2π - 0.02π) = -sin(0.02π)\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation:\n\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [2sin(0.02π)]\nProbability = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)\n\nFor a small angle u (in radians), sin(u) can be approximated by the Taylor series expansion: sin(u) ≈ u - u³/6.\nLet u = 0.02π.\n\nProbability ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) * [ (0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6 ]\nProbability ≈ 0.01 - [ 0.01 - (0.02π)² / 12 ]\nProbability ≈ (0.02π)² / 12\nProbability ≈ (0.0004 * π²) / 12\nProbability ≈ (0.0004 * 9.8696) / 12\nProbability ≈ 0.0003289\n\nThis can also be expressed in scientific notation as approximately 3.29 x 10⁻⁴.\n\nIt is worth noting that for n=2, the wavefunction has a node (a point where the probability is zero) at x = a/2 or 0.5a. Since the given interval is centered around this node, the probability is expected to be very small.\n\n<<<0.000329>>>"
