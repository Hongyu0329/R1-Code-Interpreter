    "For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the supersymmetric sigma-model is described by a field that takes values in a supermanifold. When considering the second moment of certain physical quantities, a version of the model with two replicas is required.\n\nThe target space of this specific sigma-model is the supermanifold SpO(4, R|4)/U(2|2). The variables of the model are the coordinates parametrizing this space. The non-Grassmann variables correspond to the bosonic sector of this supermanifold.\n\nThe bosonic sector of the supermanifold SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n) for symmetry class D is given by the manifold O(2n)/U(n). In the case of two replicas (n=2), this bosonic manifold is O(4)/U(2).\n\nTo find the number of non-Grassmann variables needed for the parametrization, we need to determine the dimension of this manifold. The dimension of a quotient manifold G/H is calculated as the dimension of the group G minus the dimension of the subgroup H.\n\nThe dimension of the orthogonal group O(m) is given by the formula m(m-1)/2. For O(4), the dimension is:\ndim(O(4)) = 4 * (4-1) / 2 = 6.\n\nThe dimension of the unitary group U(m) is m². For U(2), the dimension is:\ndim(U(2)) = 2² = 4.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the bosonic manifold O(4)/U(2) is:\ndim(O(4)/U(2)) = dim(O(4)) - dim(U(2)) = 6 - 4 = 2.\n\nThis result is consistent with the description of the manifold O(4)/U(2) as being isomorphic to S² × Z₂, which represents two disconnected 2-spheres. A 2-sphere is a two-dimensional manifold.\n\nThus, two non-Grassmann variables are needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model with two replicas for disordered systems of symmetry class D.\n\n<<<2>>>"
