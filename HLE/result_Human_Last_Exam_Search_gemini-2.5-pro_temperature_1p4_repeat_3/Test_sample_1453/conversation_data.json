    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, typically denoted as `abcdefg`. The stability and oligomerization of coiled coils are primarily driven by the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of hydrophobic residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat Register\nThe key to deciphering the structure is to locate the pattern of hydrophobic residues. In a typical coiled-coil, the 'a' and 'd' positions are three and four residues apart, respectively (`a` b c `d` e f g `a`). This creates a hydrophobic stripe along one face of the alpha-helix.\n\nLet's identify the hydrophobic residues (I, L, A, W) and their 1-based positions in the sequence:\n`G E **I(3)** **A(4)** Q S **L(7)** K E **I(10)** **A(11)** K S **L(14)** K E **I(17)** **A(18)** **W(19)** S **L(21)** K E **I(24)** **A(25)** Q S **L(28)** K G`\n\nWe can observe a consistent spacing between the bulky hydrophobic residues Isoleucine (I) and Leucine (L):\n*   From L(7) to I(10) is 3 residues.\n*   From I(10) to L(14) is 4 residues.\n*   From L(14) to I(17) is 3 residues.\n*   From I(24) to L(28) is 4 residues.\n\nThis repeating `(I)xx(L)` and `(L)xxx(I)` pattern is characteristic of a heptad repeat where the residues are at positions `d` and `a`, respectively. Therefore, we can confidently assign:\n*   **'a' positions**: L at 7, 14, 21, 28\n*   **'d' positions**: I at 3, 10, 17, 24\n\n### 2. Applying Packing Rules for Oligomerization\nThe specific identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions is a critical determinant of the oligomeric state. Established rules based on packing efficiency are as follows:\n*   **Dimer**: Favored when Isoleucine (I) is at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) is at the 'd' position.\n*   **Trimer**: Often results from a more even distribution of Isoleucine and Leucine, or with Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions.\n*   **Tetramer**: Favored by the reverse arrangement of the dimer-promoting sequence, which is Leucine (L) at the 'a' position and Isoleucine (I) at the 'd' position.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\nIn the given sequence, the 'a' positions are consistently occupied by Leucine and the 'd' positions are consistently occupied by Isoleucine. Based on the established principles of knobs-into-holes packing, this specific `a=L, d=I` arrangement promotes the formation of a four-helix bundle. The presence of other residues, like the Tryptophan (W) at position 19, occurs at a solvent-exposed 'f' position in the heptad repeat, and thus does not interfere with the hydrophobic core packing that dictates the oligomeric state.\n\nTherefore, the protein coiled-coil would have an oligomeric state of 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
