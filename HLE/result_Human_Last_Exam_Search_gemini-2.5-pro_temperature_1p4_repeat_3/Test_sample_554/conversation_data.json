    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nThe term \"nanocar\" typically refers to a molecule designed by a group at Rice University led by Professor James Tour. The chemical formula for this nanocar is C430H274O12.\n\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" in chemistry indicates that all hydrogen atoms in an organic compound have been replaced by fluorine atoms. Therefore, to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar, one must find the number of hydrogen atoms in a standard nanocar.\n\nGiven the molecular formula C430H274O12, the nanocar has 274 hydrogen atoms. In a perfluorinated version, these 274 hydrogen atoms would be substituted with 274 fluorine atoms, resulting in a molecular formula of C430F274O12.\n\n<<<274>>>"
