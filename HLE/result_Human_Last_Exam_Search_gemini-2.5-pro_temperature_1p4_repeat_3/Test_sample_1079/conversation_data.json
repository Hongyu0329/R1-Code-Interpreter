    "In the reflection group of type H3, the elements that possess a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10 are known as the Coxeter elements. A regular eigenvector is one that does not lie in any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group.\n\nThe key properties of the H3 group are:\n*   **Order of the group (|H3|):** The group H3 has 120 elements.\n*   **Coxeter number (h):** The Coxeter number for H3 is 10. This is equal to the highest degree of its fundamental invariants (the degrees are 2, 6, and 10).\n*   **Exponents (m_i):** The exponents of H3 are 1, 5, and 9.\n\nAn element of a reflection group is considered \"regular\" if it has an eigenvector that is not fixed by any reflection in the group. The elements having a regular eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue is a primitive h-th root of unity (where h is the Coxeter number) are precisely the Coxeter elements of the group. In this case, the order of the eigenvalue is 10, which is the Coxeter number of H3. Therefore, the question is equivalent to asking for the number of Coxeter elements in the group H3.\n\nThe number of Coxeter elements in a finite Coxeter group W is given by the formula:\n\nNumber of Coxeter elements = |W| * φ(h) / h\n\nwhere:\n*   |W| is the order of the group.\n*   h is the Coxeter number.\n*   φ(h) is Euler's totient function, which counts the positive integers up to h that are relatively prime to h.\n\nFor the H3 group:\n*   |H3| = 120\n*   h = 10\n*   φ(10) counts the integers {1, 3, 7, 9} that are coprime to 10, so φ(10) = 4.\n\nUsing the formula, the number of Coxeter elements is:\n\n(120 * 4) / 10 = 480 / 10 = 48.\n\nThus, there are 48 elements in the reflection group H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n<<<48>>>"
