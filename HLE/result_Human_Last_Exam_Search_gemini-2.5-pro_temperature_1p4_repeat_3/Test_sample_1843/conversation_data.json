    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we first need to factorize $N$ into its prime power components.\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\nSo the prime factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N$ is called primitive if it is not induced by a character with a smaller conductor. For $\\chi$ to be a primitive character with conductor $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, it must be a unique product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, where\n*   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2=4$.\n*   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2=9$.\n*   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n*   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n*   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n\nLet's determine the number of possible choices for each component character $\\chi_i$ such that their orders are compatible with the condition $\\text{lcm}(...) = 6$. This implies that the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6.\n\n1.  **Characters modulo 4**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. There is $\\phi(4)=2$ character in total. One is the principal character (conductor 1), and the other is a primitive character of order 2. So, for $\\chi_1$, there is exactly **1 choice**, and its order is 2.\n\n2.  **Characters modulo 9**: The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, which is a cyclic group of order 6. The number of primitive characters modulo 9 is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$. The orders of these 4 primitive characters are the divisors of 6 that are not divisors of 2, but this is not correct. We found that the orders of the primitive characters are 3 (for 2 characters) and 6 (for 2 characters).\n    Both 3 and 6 are divisors of 6. So there are $2+2 = \\textbf{4}$ choices for $\\chi_2$. The order of $\\chi_2$ will be either 3 or 6.\n\n3.  **Characters modulo 7**: The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. Any non-principal character is primitive, so there are $\\phi(7)-1=5$ primitive characters. Their orders are the divisors of 6, except for 1. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6. The number of characters for each order $d$ is $\\phi(d)$.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$ character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$ characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$ characters.\n    All these orders (2, 3, 6) are divisors of 6. So, there are $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$ choices for $\\chi_3$.\n\n4.  **Characters modulo 11**: The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$. The $\\phi(11)-1=9$ non-principal characters are all primitive. Their orders are the divisors of 10, except for 1, which are 2, 5, and 10. We need the order to be a divisor of 6. Of {2, 5, 10}, only 2 divides 6. The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. So there is only **1 choice** for $\\chi_4$. Its order must be 2.\n\n5.  **Characters modulo 13**: The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$. The $\\phi(13)-1=11$ non-principal characters are primitive. Their orders are the divisors of 12, except for 1, which are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We need the order to be a divisor of 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$ character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$ characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$ characters.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_5$ is $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of combinations of these characters. The total number of tuples $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4, \\chi_5)$ is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nWe must verify that for every combination, the order of the resulting character $\\chi$ is exactly 6.\nLet the orders of the chosen components be $(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5)$. The order of $\\chi$ is $\\text{lcm}(o_1, o_2, o_3, o_4, o_5)$.\n*   We know $o_1 = 2$ and $o_4 = 2$. This guarantees that the lcm is a multiple of 2.\n*   For $\\chi_2$, the possible orders are $o_2 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. In either case, $o_2$ is a multiple of 3. This guarantees that the lcm is a multiple of 3.\n*   Since the lcm is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6.\n*   By our selection, every component's order $o_i$ is a divisor of 6. Therefore, their lcm must also be a divisor of 6.\n\nSince the order must be a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6, it must be exactly 6 for all possible 100 combinations.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
