    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is most commonly referred to as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**, often with explicit acknowledgment of its spatial dependence.\n\nMore specifically, the terminology can be broken down as follows:\n\n*   **Generalized Pair Correlation Function**: In the context of nuclear reactor noise, this function, often denoted as C(r1, r2, τ), describes the correlation between neutron detections (or flux fluctuations) at two different spatial points, r1 and r2, separated by a time lag, τ.\n\n*   **Temporal Fourier Transform**: The Fourier transform of the temporal correlation function (for a fixed or single spatial point) is universally known as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**.\n    *   If the correlation is between a signal and itself (an autocorrelation function), its Fourier transform is the **Auto Power Spectral Density (APSD)**.\n    *   If the correlation is between two different signals (a cross-correlation function), the transform is the **Cross Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**.\n\n*   **Space-Time Double Fourier Transform**: When considering the spatial dependence, the double Fourier transform with respect to both time and space variables does not have a single, universally adopted, concise name in the same way \"Power Spectral Density\" is used for the time-frequency transform. Instead, the community typically discusses the **space-dependent power spectral density**. This acknowledges that the power spectral density varies with the spatial coordinates of the detectors.\n\nExperimental and theoretical work in reactor noise analysis often involves measuring and calculating these space-dependent spectral densities to understand the kinetic parameters of the system, such as in the Feynman-alpha and Rossi-alpha methods. The spatial effects become particularly important in large or coupled-core reactors where the point-kinetics approximation is not valid.\n\nTherefore, while \"Power Spectral Density\" is the fundamental term, a more complete description in the context of your question would be the **space-dependent power spectral density**.\n\n<<<Power Spectral Density (PSD) with spatial dependence>>>"
