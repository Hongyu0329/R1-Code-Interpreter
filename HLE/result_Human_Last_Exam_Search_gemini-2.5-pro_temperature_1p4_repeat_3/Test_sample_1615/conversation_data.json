    "Let $n = 12345$ be the number of vertices in the graph $G$. The question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, given that $G$ is not the complete graph $K_n$.\n\nThe chromatic number of any graph with $n$ vertices is at most $n$, as we can always assign a unique color to each vertex.\n\nA graph $G$ with $n$ vertices has a chromatic number $\\chi(G) = n$ if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$. This is because in a complete graph, every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex, thus requiring a unique color for each of the $n$ vertices. Conversely, if a graph with $n$ vertices requires $n$ colors, it means every vertex must be adjacent to every other vertex, which is the definition of a complete graph.\n\nThe problem states that the graph $G$ is **not** the complete graph $K_{12345}$. Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than 12345. This gives us an upper bound:\n$\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\nTo determine if 12344 is the maximum possible chromatic number, we need to show that there exists at least one graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of 12344.\n\nConsider the following construction for a graph $G$:\nLet $G$ be the graph formed by the disjoint union of a complete graph on 12344 vertices, $K_{12344}$, and a single isolated vertex, $K_1$.\n*   **Number of vertices:** This graph has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices.\n*   **Is it a complete graph?** The graph is not a complete graph ($K_{12345}$) because the isolated vertex is not connected to any of the vertices in the $K_{12344}$ subgraph.\n*   **Chromatic Number:** The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. The components are $K_{12344}$ and $K_1$.\n    *   The chromatic number of $K_{12344}$ is 12344.\n    *   The chromatic number of an isolated vertex $K_1$ is 1.\n    *   Therefore, $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(K_1)) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nSince we have established that no such graph can have a chromatic number greater than 12344, and we have constructed a graph that satisfies the given conditions and has a chromatic number of 12344, the maximum number of colors required is 12344.\n\nAnother theorem that can be referenced is Brooks' Theorem, which states that for any connected graph $G$ with maximum degree $\\Delta$, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In our case, the graph doesn't have to be connected. If it is, consider a graph constructed by a $K_{12344}$ clique and one additional vertex connected to at least one but not all vertices of the clique. Such a graph is not complete, and its chromatic number is 12344, which equals its maximum degree, consistent with the theorem.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
