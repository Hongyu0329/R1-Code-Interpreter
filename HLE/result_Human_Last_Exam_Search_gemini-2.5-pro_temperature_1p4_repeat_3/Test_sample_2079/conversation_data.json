    "While the specific name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 is not readily available in online sources, historical records confirm the existence of such a position. The town, a free royal city since 1376, had the right to elect its own magistrate, including the judge (richtár) and the town council.\n\nScholarly work, particularly the book \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\" by Mária Fedorčáková, is cited as containing detailed appendices with lists of Bardejov's town officials, including judges, up to the 1520s. However, the actual contents of these appendices are not digitized or publicly accessible through online searches.\n\nHistorical documents from the period, such as a letter from 1461 concerning border robberies, are known to have been addressed to the \"judge and lay judges in Bártfa,\" further confirming the role's existence at that specific time. Despite these references, the name of the individual holding the position of judge in 1461 remains elusive in the available digital records. The definitive answer likely lies within the physical archives of Bardejov or the aforementioned publication by Mária Fedorčáková.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 based on the available information.>>>"
