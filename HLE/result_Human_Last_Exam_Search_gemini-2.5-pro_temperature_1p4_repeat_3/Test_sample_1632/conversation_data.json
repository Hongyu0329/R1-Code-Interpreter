    "A self-avoiding walk on a lattice is a path that does not visit the same point more than once. The \"Manhattan lattice\" is another term for the square lattice, where movement is restricted to grid lines. The number of n-step self-avoiding walks is denoted by a(n).\n\nCalculating a(n) is a complex combinatorial problem, and there is no known simple formula for it. However, the values of a(n) have been computed for relatively small n through various algorithms.\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk on a square lattice, the value of a(10) is 44,100. The sequence of the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. The listed values confirm that for n=10, the number of walks is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
