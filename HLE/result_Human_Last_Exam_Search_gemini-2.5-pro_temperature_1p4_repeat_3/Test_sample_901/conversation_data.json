    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. This is because potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, bulky base which favors elimination over substitution, and the reaction is typically carried out at elevated temperatures.\n\nThe E2 reaction has a stereochemical requirement for the leaving group (in this case, bromine) and a beta-hydrogen to be in an anti-periplanar or anti-coplanar conformation. This means they must be on the same plane and pointing in opposite directions. In a cyclohexane ring, this translates to a trans-diaxial arrangement, where both the leaving group and the hydrogen are in axial positions.\n\nLet's analyze the chair conformations of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n\n*   **Conformation A:** If the bromine atom is in an axial position (down), the methyl group at the adjacent carbon will be in an equatorial position (up) due to the (1S,2R) configuration. For an E2 reaction to occur, there must be a beta-hydrogen that is axial and anti to the bromine. In this conformation, the hydrogen on the same carbon as the methyl group is axial (down). Also, on the other adjacent carbon (C6), there is an axial hydrogen (up).\n*   **Conformation B:** If the bromine atom is in an equatorial position (down), the methyl group would be in an axial position (up). For elimination to occur, the molecule would have to flip to Conformation A, which has the axial bromine, because E2 elimination requires the leaving group to be in an axial position.\n\nThe bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, will abstract a proton. According to Zaitsev's rule, the more substituted alkene is the major product. This would involve the removal of the hydrogen from the carbon bearing the methyl group. However, the use of a bulky base can favor the Hofmann product, which is the less substituted alkene.\n\nLet's consider the possible products based on the removal of different beta-hydrogens when the bromine is axial:\n\n1.  **Elimination of H at C2:** The hydrogen at C2 is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n2.  **Elimination of H at C6:** There are two hydrogens at C6. One is axial and the other is equatorial. The axial hydrogen at C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1. Abstraction of this hydrogen by the bulky base will lead to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\nTherefore, the major product will be the alkene formed by the elimination of the axial bromine and the axial hydrogen on carbon 6.\n\nConsidering the (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, let's draw the chair conformation. For the trans isomer, if we place the bromine in the required axial position (down), the methyl group at C2 will be in an equatorial position (up). There are two beta-hydrogens that can be removed: one at C2 and one at C6. For the E2 reaction, the hydrogen must be in an axial position, anti-periplanar to the bromine. The hydrogen at C6 is axial and anti-periplanar to the bromine. The hydrogen at C2 is equatorial. Therefore, the base will abstract the proton from C6.\n\nThe reaction is as follows:\n\n(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane + KOC(CH₃)₃ → 3-methylcyclohexene + KBr + HOC(CH₃)₃\n\nThus, the major product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. Another possible, but minor, product would be 1-methylcyclohexene. However, the stereochemical requirements of the E2 reaction strongly favor the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene in this specific diastereomer.\n\nThe reaction of *cis*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide gives 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product), whereas the *trans* isomer does not give this product. Our starting material is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which is a *trans* isomer. In the most stable chair conformation of the trans isomer, both the bromine and the methyl group are in equatorial positions. To undergo E2 elimination, the molecule must flip to a less stable conformation where the bromine is axial. In this conformation, the methyl group is also axial. The only anti-periplanar hydrogen is on C6, leading to the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
