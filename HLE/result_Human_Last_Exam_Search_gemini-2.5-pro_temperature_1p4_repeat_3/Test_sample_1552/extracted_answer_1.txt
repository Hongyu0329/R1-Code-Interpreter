The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion for a massless gauged Dirac spinor, often denoted `a₂`, includes a term proportional to the square of the gauge field strength, `Tr(F_μν F^μν)`, which upon integration over the manifold gives the Yang-Mills action. Specifically, for a Dirac operator in 4 dimensions, the density `a₂(x)` contains the term `-1/12 Tr(F_μν F^μν)`, where the trace is over the gauge group generators.
