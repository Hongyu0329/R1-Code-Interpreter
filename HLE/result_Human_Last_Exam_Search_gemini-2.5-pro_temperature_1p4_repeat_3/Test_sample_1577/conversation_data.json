    "The ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. The GSD is equal to `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits the code can store. The number of logical qubits is determined by the number of independent non-trivial loops and strings on the surface.\n\nFor a surface of genus `g` with `b` boundaries of the same type, the number of logical qubits is `k = 2g + b - 1`. The ground state degeneracy is therefore `4^g \\times 2^{b-1}`.\n\nThis problem considers a planar geometry, which has a genus `g=0`. The surface has `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. Each hole constitutes a boundary. Therefore, we have a surface with `n` smooth boundaries and `m` rough boundaries.\n\nWhen there are boundaries of different types (smooth and rough), the number of logical qubits can be calculated by considering the logical operators associated with each boundary type.\n\n1.  **Smooth Boundaries**: Smooth boundaries are also known as `m`-boundaries because they condense magnetic `m`-excitations. Logical operators associated with smooth boundaries are `Z`-type loops (`L_Z`) that encircle the boundary and `X`-type strings (`S_X`) that connect two smooth boundaries. For `n` smooth boundaries, it's possible to define `n-1` independent logical qubits.\n\n2.  **Rough Boundaries**: Rough boundaries are also known as `e`-boundaries because they condense electric `e`-excitations. Logical operators associated with rough boundaries are `X`-type loops (`L_X`) encircling them and `Z`-type strings (`S_Z`) connecting them. For `m` rough boundaries, it's possible to define `m-1` independent logical qubits.\n\nWhen both types of boundaries are present on a genus-0 surface (like a sphere or a plane with holes), the total number of logical qubits `k` is the sum of the qubits from each sector, provided both `n > 0` and `m > 0`.\n\n`k = k_Z + k_X = (n - 1) + (m - 1) = n + m - 2`\n\nThis formula holds when there is at least one hole of each type (`n \\ge 1` and `m \\ge 1`).\n\nTherefore, the ground space degeneracy is `2^k = 2^(n+m-2)`.\n\nLet's check the special cases:\n*   If `m=0` (only `n` smooth holes), all boundaries are of the same type. For a sphere with `n` holes, `g=0` and `b=n`. The number of qubits is `k = 2(0) + n - 1 = n-1`. The GSD is `2^(n-1)`.\n*   If `n=0` (only `m` rough holes), similarly `k = m-1`. The GSD is `2^(m-1)`.\n*   The formula `n+m-2` gives `n-2` for the `m=0` case, which is incorrect. This indicates that the formula in answer choice B is specifically for the case where `n \\ge 1` and `m \\ge 1`. In multiple-choice questions of this nature, it is common for the answer to represent the general case where all specified components are present.\n\nGiven the choices, `2^(m+n-2)` is the correct formula for the ground state degeneracy of the toric code on a plane with `n` smooth and `m` rough holes, under the assumption that `n \\ge 1` and `m \\ge 1`.\n\n<<<B>>>"
