    "The reaction described is a directed ortho-metalation (DoM), followed by quenching with an electrophile. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**1. Starting Material:**\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has two directing metalation groups (DMGs) on the benzene ring:\n*   An N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) at position 1.\n*   A dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at position 3.\n\n**2. Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation (Lithiation)**\n*   The reaction uses sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) in the presence of tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a solvent. sec-BuLi is a strong base used to deprotonate the aromatic ring. TMEDA is a chelating agent that complexes with the lithium ion, increasing the basicity of the organolithium compound and stabilizing the resulting aryllithium intermediate.\n*   Directed ortho-metalation is a reaction where a substituent on an aromatic ring directs a strong base to deprotonate a specific proton, usually one in the ortho position. The directing group's heteroatom coordinates to the lithium atom, facilitating the deprotonation at the adjacent ortho position.\n*   In this case, both the N,N-diethylamide and the dimethylamino groups are directing groups. We must consider the directing effect of both:\n    *   The N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) directs lithiation to the ortho positions: C2 and C6. It is considered a powerful directing group.\n    *   The dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at C3 directs lithiation to its ortho positions: C2 and C4.\n*   The key to determining the site of lithiation is the relative directing ability of the two groups. The tertiary amide group is a more effective and powerful directing group than the dimethylamino group.\n*   Furthermore, the C2 position is ortho to *both* directing groups. This is a case of cooperative or reinforcing directing effects. The acidity of the C2 proton is significantly increased due to the influence of both the amide and the amino groups, making it the most favorable site for deprotonation by sec-BuLi.\n\nAs a result, the aryllithium intermediate formed is N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n**3. Step 2: Electrophilic Quench**\n*   The aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile.\n*   Methyl iodide (CH₃I) is added to the reaction. The nucleophilic carbanion on the aromatic ring attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction.\n*   The lithium atom at the C2 position is replaced by a methyl group.\n\n**4. Final Product**\nThe final compound obtained after the two steps is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThe overall transformation is:\nN,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide → (1. sec-BuLi, TMEDA, THF) → (2. CH₃I) → N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
