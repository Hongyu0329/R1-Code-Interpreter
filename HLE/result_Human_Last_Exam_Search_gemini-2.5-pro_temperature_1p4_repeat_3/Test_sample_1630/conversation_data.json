    "Answering this question requires analyzing the number of real roots of the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n1.  **Define the problem mathematically.**\n    Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    A fixed point of $h(x)$ is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. This is equivalent to finding the number of real roots of the polynomial equation $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the equation.**\n    Since $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9, $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is also a polynomial of degree 9. According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, $f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n3.  **Analyze the constraints.**\n    We are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   For a cubic polynomial $f(x) = ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$, the derivative is the quadratic $f'(x) = 3ax^2+2bx+c$. For $f'(x)$ to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive ($3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$) and its discriminant must be negative ($(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 < 12ac \\implies b^2 < 3ac$).\n    *   The condition $f'(x) > 0$ implies that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. Similarly, $g(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n    *   The derivative of the composite function is given by the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any real $y$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for any real $x$, it follows that $h'(x)$ is always positive. This means $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n4.  **Investigate if the maximum of 9 can be achieved.**\n    We need to determine if it is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ has 9 real roots.\n    For $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ to have 9 real roots, its derivative $P'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$ must have at least 8 real roots, by Rolle's Theorem.\n    The expression $f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$ is a polynomial of degree 8, since the degree of $f'(g(x))$ is $2 \\times 3 = 6$ and the degree of $g'(x)$ is 2. A polynomial of degree 8 can have up to 8 real roots, so this condition is plausible.\n\n    This question has been a subject of mathematical research. It has been proven that for any integers $d_1, d_2 \\ge 2$, it is possible to find polynomials $P_1$ and $P_2$ of degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$ respectively, such that their composition $P_1 \\circ P_2$ has exactly $d_1 d_2$ fixed points.\n\n    More specifically, a result by Garijo and Ma√±osas (2021) states that for any degrees $d_1, d_2 \\ge 2$, there exist *increasing* polynomials of these degrees whose composition has $d_1 d_2$ real fixed points. Their constructive proof shows that one can modify Chebyshev polynomials by adding a sufficiently large linear term, $T_d(x)+cx$, to ensure the derivative is always positive, while arranging the parameters to create the maximum number of fixed points.\n\n    Applying this result to our case with $d_1 = 3$ and $d_2 = 3$, it is possible to construct two cubic polynomials $f$ and $g$ with positive derivatives such that their composition $f(g(x))$ has $3 \\times 3 = 9$ real fixed points.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    The number of fixed points is the number of real roots of a degree 9 polynomial, so it cannot exceed 9. The existence of polynomials that achieve this bound under the given constraints is confirmed by mathematical literature. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
