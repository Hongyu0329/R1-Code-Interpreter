    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number 13/16 in Red-Blue Hackenbush, one must first understand how dyadic rational numbers (fractions with a power of 2 in the denominator) are constructed in this combinatorial game. Every finite Red-Blue Hackenbush position corresponds to a dyadic rational number.\n\nThe representation of a dyadic rational number, such as 13/16, can be achieved using a single stack of colored pieces. The specific arrangement of red and blue pieces in this stack is determined by the binary representation of the number.\n\nFirst, convert the fraction 13/16 to its binary form:\n13/16 = 0.8125 in decimal.\nIn binary, this is 0.1101. This can be expanded as:\n1 * (1/2) + 1 * (1/4) + 0 * (1/8) + 1 * (1/16)\n\nIn the standard construction of a Red-Blue Hackenbush stack for a positive number between 0 and 1, the pieces in the stack, starting from the one closest to the ground, correspond to the digits of the binary expansion after the decimal point. A '1' in the binary expansion is represented by a blue piece, and a '0' is represented by a red piece.\n\nFollowing this rule for 13/16 (binary 0.1101):\n*   The first digit (corresponding to the 1/2 place) is 1, so the first piece is **blue**.\n*   The second digit (corresponding to the 1/4 place) is 1, so the second piece is **blue**.\n*   The third digit (corresponding to the 1/8 place) is 0, so the third piece is **red**.\n*   The fourth digit (corresponding to the 1/16 place) is 1, so the fourth piece is **blue**.\n\nTherefore, the stack of pieces from the ground up is Blue, Blue, Red, Blue. This construction requires a total of four pieces. The composition of these pieces is three blue and one red.\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is the sum of the red and blue pieces.\n\n<<<4>>>"
