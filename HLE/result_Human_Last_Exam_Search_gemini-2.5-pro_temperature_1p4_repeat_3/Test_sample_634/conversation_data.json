    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nLet D(s) be a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s). By definition, D(s) must be a common right divisor of both P1(s) and P2(s).\n\nFirst, let's identify the set of all possible right divisors of P2(s). Let d(s) be a right divisor of P2(s), which means P2(s) = K(s)d(s) for some polynomial matrix K(s). Taking the determinant of both sides, we get det(P2(s)) = det(K(s))det(d(s)).\n\nThe determinant of P2(s) is:\ndet(P2) = (s)(1) - (0)(-s - 1) = s\n\nSince K(s) and d(s) are polynomial matrices, their determinants must be polynomials. Therefore, det(d(s)) must be a polynomial factor of 's'. This means det(d(s)) can either be a non-zero constant 'c' or a constant multiple of 's', 'cs'.\n\nCase 1: det(d(s)) = c (a non-zero constant)\nIf the determinant of a polynomial matrix is a non-zero constant, the matrix is called unimodular. Unimodular matrices are the \"units\" in the ring of polynomial matrices, analogous to 1 and -1 for integers. Any unimodular matrix is a divisor of any other matrix. An example is the identity matrix, I.\n\nCase 2: det(d(s)) = cs\nIn this case, d(s) is a non-unimodular right divisor. The right divisors of P2 in this category are right associates of P2 itself, meaning they are of the form P2(s)V(s) where V(s) is a unimodular matrix.\n\nThe GCRD, D(s), must be a right divisor of P2(s), so it must fall into one of these two cases.\n\nLet's test if a matrix from Case 2 can be the GCRD. Let's assume the GCRD is D(s) = P2(s)V(s) for some unimodular V(s). For simplicity, let's test with V(s) = I, so D(s) = P2(s).\nIf P2(s) is the GCRD, it must also be a right divisor of P1(s). This means there must exist a polynomial matrix A(s) such that:\nP1(s) = A(s)P2(s)\n\nLet A(s) = [[a11(s), a12(s)], [a21(s), a22(s)]].\n[[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]] = [[a11, a12], [a21, a22]] * [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nThis matrix equation leads to a system of linear equations for the entries of A(s):\n1.  -s = a11 * 0 + a12 * 1  =>  a12 = -s\n2.  s^2 = a21 * 0 + a22 * 1  =>  a22 = s^2\n\nSubstitute these back into the equations for the first column:\n3.  s^2 + s = a11 * s + a12 * (-s - 1)\n    s^2 + s = a11 * s + (-s) * (-s - 1)\n    s^2 + s = a11 * s + s^2 + s\n    0 = a11 * s  =>  a11 = 0\n\n4.  -s^2 - 1 = a21 * s + a22 * (-s - 1)\n    -s^2 - 1 = a21 * s + (s^2) * (-s - 1)\n    -s^2 - 1 = a21 * s - s^3 - s^2\n    s^3 - 1 = a21 * s\n    a21 = (s^3 - 1) / s = s^2 - 1/s\n\nSince a21(s) is not a polynomial, no such polynomial matrix A(s) exists. Therefore, P2(s) is not a right divisor of P1(s). Consequently, no right associate of P2 can be a common right divisor of P1.\n\nThis rules out Case 2. The GCRD must belong to Case 1, which means the GCRD must be a unimodular matrix. Two matrices whose GCRD is unimodular are called **right coprime**.\n\nBy convention, the simplest unimodular matrix, the identity matrix I, is chosen as the GCRD for coprime matrices.\n\nFinal check using the coprimeness test: Two polynomial matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are right coprime if and only if the composite matrix [P1(s); P2(s)] has full column rank for all complex values of s.\nThe matrix is `[[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]`. This is a 4x2 matrix, so full column rank means rank 2.\nA drop in rank could potentially occur at values of s where both matrices are singular.\ndet(P1) = s(s^3 - 1)\ndet(P2) = s\nThe only common root is s=0.\nAt s=0, the matrix becomes `[[0, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 0], [-1, 1]]`. The second and fourth rows, [-1, 0] and [-1, 1], are linearly independent, so the rank is 2.\nFor any s ≠ 0, det(P2) ≠ 0, so P2(s) has rank 2, which guarantees that the larger 4x2 matrix also has rank 2.\nSince the rank is 2 for all s, the matrices are right coprime.\n\nTherefore, their greatest common right divisor is any unimodular matrix. By convention, this is taken to be the identity matrix.\n\nThe greatest common right divisor is [,].\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
