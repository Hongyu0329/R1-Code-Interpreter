    "True.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), which is measured by the amount of phenotypic variance it can explain, is fundamentally limited by the SNP heritability of the trait in question. SNP heritability represents the total proportion of variation in a phenotype that can be accounted for by all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). As such, it serves as the theoretical maximum predictive power a polygenic score can achieve.\n\nIn practice, the variance explained by a polygenic score is almost always lower than the SNP heritability. This discrepancy arises because a PGS is constructed using effect sizes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which are subject to estimation errors. Furthermore, differences between the population used for the initial GWAS and the population in which the PGS is being applied can also reduce its predictive accuracy. If the effects of all causal SNPs were known precisely, the variance explained by the PGS could theoretically equal the SNP heritability. However, due to these practical limitations, the predictive power of current polygenic scores is typically much lower than this theoretical upper bound.\n\n<<<True>>>"
