    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological process in English where a tense or long vowel in a stressed syllable becomes lax or short when it is followed by two or more syllables, with the first of these being unstressed. This sound change is most commonly observed in words of Latin and Greek origin, particularly when suffixes are added.\n\nBased on this rule, here is an analysis of the provided words:\n\n*   **southern**: This word underwent trisyllabic laxing. Although it is now disyllabic (/ˈsʌðərn/), its Middle English predecessor, *sutherne*, was pronounced with three syllables (/ˈsuːðərnə/). The long vowel in *south* (/saʊθ/, from Old English *sūþ* with a long /u:/) was shortened in the trisyllabic form.\n*   **derivative**: This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in the verb *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in the noun *derivative*, which has three syllables following the stressed syllable.\n*   **serenity**: This word also clearly demonstrates trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* is laxed to /ɛ/ in the noun *serenity*, where it is followed by two unstressed syllables.\n*   **pleasant**: This word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing. It is a disyllabic word, and while the vowel differs from the verb *please*, this is an instance of disyllabic laxing, a distinct process. The condition of being followed by two or more syllables is not met.\n*   **gratitude**: This word is an example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel in the root of *grateful* is laxed in the trisyllabic noun *gratitude*.\n*   **shadow**: This word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing. The vowel change from *shade* to *shadow* is a case of disyllabic laxing, as the vowel is followed by only one unstressed syllable. Furthermore, *shadow* derives from the Old English word *sceadwe*, and this type of vowel shortening is characteristic of native Germanic words, whereas trisyllabic laxing predominantly affects words of Latinate origin.\n\nBoth \"pleasant\" and \"shadow\" have not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing. However, the process in \"shadow\" from \"shade\" is a clear case of disyllabic laxing in a native English word, distinct from the patterns seen in Latin-derived words.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
