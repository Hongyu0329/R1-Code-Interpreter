    "The haiku provided gives a series of clues that, when deciphered, point to a specific number. The final instruction, that the answer must be in alphabetical order, is the key to solving the riddle.\n\nThe clues in the haiku can be interpreted as follows:\n*   **An August tempest**: This line evokes the story of Noah's Ark, a biblical tale featuring a massive, storm-like event that lasted for 40 days and 40 nights.\n*   **Twice fifteen brings winds of change**: \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30. This clue is a near miss, designed to mislead, while \"winds of change\" points to the massive transformation the world underwent according to the story of the great flood.\n*   **A divine one yields**: In the narrative of Noah's Ark, God, the \"divine one,\" yields his wrath and establishes a new covenant with humanity.\n\nThe answer to the riddle is a word whose letters are in alphabetical order. The only number in the English language that is spelled with its letters in alphabetical order is \"forty\".\n\n<<<forty>>>"
