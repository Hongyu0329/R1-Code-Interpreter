    "I'm sorry, I was unable to find a closed form for the given sum. The search results provide information on various binomial identities and methods for finding closed forms, but none of them directly address the specific sum in the user's request. It is a complex summation that likely does not have a simple closed-form expression.\n\nTherefore, I have to return the original query as the answer.\n<<<$\\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$>>>"
