    "In the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature, the partition function Z is given by:\n\nZ = ∫ Dϕ *e*<sup>-S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ]</sup>\n\nwhere the integral is over all field configurations ϕ that are periodic in imaginary time with period β = 1/T (T being the temperature), and S<sub>E</sub> is the Euclidean action.\n\nFor a free, neutral scalar field, the Euclidean action is:\n\nS<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x [ ½ (∂<sub>τ</sub>ϕ)<sup>2</sup> + ½ (∇ϕ)<sup>2</sup> + ½ m<sup>2</sup>ϕ<sup>2</sup> ]\n\nThis can be rewritten in a more compact form using a differential operator, D<sub>ϕ</sub>. The action is the quadratic form associated with this operator. The expression (ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>) represents the inner product in the space of field configurations, which is defined by the integral over Euclidean spacetime.\n\nThe inner product of (ϕ,D_ϕ) is the Euclidean action S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] itself, where D<sub>ϕ</sub> is the operator:\n\nD<sub>ϕ</sub> = -∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>\n\nTherefore, the inner product is given by:\n\n(ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>ϕ) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nAfter an integration by parts, and assuming the boundary terms vanish due to the periodicity in τ and the fields going to zero at spatial infinity, this becomes:\n\n(ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>ϕ) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x [ (∂<sub>τ</sub>ϕ)<sup>2</sup> + (∇ϕ)<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>ϕ<sup>2</sup> ]\n\nThis is precisely the quadratic part of the action for the free scalar field. For an interacting theory with a potential V(ϕ), the full action would be S<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] = ½ (ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>ϕ) + ∫dτd<sup>d</sup>x V(ϕ), and the term (ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>ϕ) still represents the kinetic and mass term.\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function corresponds to the quadratic part of the Euclidean action. It is given by the integral of the field ϕ multiplied by the operator D_ϕ acting on ϕ, over the Euclidean spacetime (with imaginary time τ ∈ [0, β] where β is the inverse temperature).\n\nThe operator D_ϕ for a free scalar field is the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean space:\nD<sub>ϕ</sub> = -∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>\n\nThe inner product is therefore:\n(ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>ϕ) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂<sub>τ</sub><sup>2</sup> - ∇<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>) ϕ(τ, **x**)\n\nThrough integration by parts, this is equivalent to the standard expression for the free Euclidean action:\nS<sub>E</sub>[ϕ] = ½ ∫<sub>0</sub><sup>β</sup> dτ ∫ d<sup>d</sup>x [ (∂<sub>τ</sub>ϕ)<sup>2</sup> + (∇ϕ)<sup>2</sup> + m<sup>2</sup>ϕ<sup>2</sup> ]\n\nSo, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕϕ) is twice the free part of the Euclidean action. Often, the action is simply written as S<sub>E</sub> = ½ (ϕ, D<sub>ϕ</sub>ϕ) for a free field. For interacting theories, this term represents the kinetic and mass terms, while the interaction terms are handled separately.>>>"
