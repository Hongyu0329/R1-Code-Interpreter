    "### Four Achiral and Non-Polar Crystal Classes surprisingly exhibit Optical Activity\n\nFour crystal classes are known to be both achiral and non-polar, yet they possess the necessary symmetry to be optically active. These classes are:\n\n*   **m (also denoted as C_s)**\n*   **mm2 (also denoted as C_2v)**\n*   **4 (also denoted as S_4)**\n*   **42m (also denoted as D_2d)**\n\nTypically, optical activity, the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light, is associated with chiral structures. Chirality is the property of an object being non-superimposable on its mirror image, much like a left and right hand. Crystals that lack a center of symmetry are candidates for exhibiting optical activity.\n\nHowever, the relationship between chirality and optical activity is not absolute. While all chiral crystal classes are optically active, a few achiral classes also show this property. The four non-enantiomorphic (achiral) crystal classes mentioned above—m, mm2, 4, and 42m—are the specific exceptions. In these particular crystal structures, both right- and left-handed rotations of the plane of polarization can exist within the same crystal.\n\nThe existence of optical activity in these achiral classes is a known phenomenon, confirmed by experimental observations. For instance, optical activity has been documented in crystals such as silver thiogallate (AgGaS₂) which belongs to the 42m class, and cadmium gallium sulfide (CdGa₂S₄) in the 4 class. Similarly, materials in the mm2 and m classes have also been shown to be optically active. This unique characteristic arises from the specific symmetry elements present in these crystal classes, which, despite including mirror planes (making them achiral), still permit the tensor property that governs optical rotation. Furthermore, some of these optically active achiral classes have been the subject of advanced studies using techniques like X-ray Natural Circular Dichroism."
