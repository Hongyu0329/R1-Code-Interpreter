    "It is not possible to provide a precise number of \"pas de Balanchines\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\" The primary reasons for this are the nature of the choreographic terminology and the unavailability of specific performance footage.\n\nThe term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized step in the standard lexicon of ballet or in the context of William Forsythe's choreography. Forsythe, while influenced by George Balanchine, developed his own unique and complex movement vocabulary. His work is characterized by extending and accelerating traditional ballet figures, often shifting their alignment and emphasis to create a dynamic, athletic, and unexpected style. The choreography in \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" is described as an abstract exploration of movement, focusing on the interplay between dancers and space rather than a sequence of traditional, nameable steps.\n\nMore recently, the term \"pas de Balanchine\" has gained popularity on social media platforms like TikTok. It is often used to describe a specific combination of movements from a variation choreographed by Tomas Karlborg, which has become a viral trend. This specific sequence is not part of Forsythe's choreography for \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated.\"\n\nWhile Svetlana Gileva did perform with the Semperoper Ballett, and is listed in programs for \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" specific video of her 2015 \"Jete Woman solo\" is not publicly available to analyze for any recurring stylistic movements that might be colloquially interpreted as a \"pas de Balanchine\".\n\nTherefore, given that \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formal step in the ballet's choreography, Svetlana Gileva would have performed zero of them. Her performance would have consisted of the unique and complex choreographic language created by William Forsythe.\n\n<<<0>>>"
