A Zirconium-based single-site catalyst, featuring either a constrained geometry or an imino-amido ligand system and supported on sulfated alumina, represents the most promising combination for a dual-function catalyst capable of both olefin polymerization and the efficient hydrogenolysis of polyolefins into short saturated alkanes.
