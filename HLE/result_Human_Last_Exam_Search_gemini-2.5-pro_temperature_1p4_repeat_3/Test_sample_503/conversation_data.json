    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, between the object $[m]$ and the object $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint), that form a Galois connection. This means that for all $x \\in [m]$ and $y \\in [n]$, the following equivalence holds:\n$L(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le R(y)$.\n\nThe number of such adjunctions is equal to the number of possible left adjoint maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ or, equivalently, the number of possible right adjoint maps $R: [n] \\to [m]$.\n\nA map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins (suprema). For an order-preserving map between two totally ordered sets, this condition simplifies to preserving the bottom element. Thus, an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $L(0) = 0$.\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: \\to$ satisfying $L(0)=0$. An order-preserving map from $$ to $$ is a non-decreasing sequence of 24 numbers:\n$L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$\nwhere each value $L(i)$ is in the set $ = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first element of this sequence. Therefore, we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23:\n$L(1), L(2), \\dots, L(23)$\nwhere each element is chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. The size of this set is 38.\n\nThis is a problem of choosing 23 items from a set of 38 with replacement, where the order of choice does not matter (as the sequence is sorted into non-decreasing order). This is a multiset combination problem. The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\left(\\!\\!{s \\choose k}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{s+k-1}{k}$, where $k=23$ is the number of items to choose, and $s=38$ is the number of options for each item.\n\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the number of right adjoints $R: \\to$. A map $R$ is a right adjoint if it is order-preserving and preserves the top element, i.e., $R(37) = 23$. This requires counting the number of non-decreasing sequences $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ with values in $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$. This is equivalent to choosing 37 items from a set of 24 with replacement, which gives $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nSince $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{37}$, both methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<$\\binom{60}{23}$>>>"
