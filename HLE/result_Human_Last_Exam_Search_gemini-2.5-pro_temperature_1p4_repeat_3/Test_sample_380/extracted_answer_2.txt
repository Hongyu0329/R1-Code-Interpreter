The local magnetic field is not considered radial when calculating normalized magnetic helicity at the L1 point. The calculation is performed using magnetic field components perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field, not the radial direction. This is because Alfven Ion Cyclotron waves propagate along the local magnetic field, and their polarization, which the helicity describes, is defined in the plane perpendicular to this direction of propagation. Since the interplanetary magnetic field at L1 is typically oriented at a significant angle to the radial direction (the Parker spiral), a coordinate transformation is required to align the analysis with the local field.
