    "The determinant of the given matrix\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis 0.\n\nThe determinant can be computed using the rule of Sarrus for a 3x3 matrix:\ndet(A) = (2 * 2 * 2) + (-1 * -1 * -1) + (-1 * -1 * -1) - (-1 * 2 * -1) - (-1 * -1 * 2) - (2 * -1 * -1)\ndet(A) = 8 - 1 - 1 - 2 - 2 - 2\ndet(A) = 8 - 8 = 0\n\nAlternatively, one can observe that the sum of the rows of the matrix is the zero vector:\n(2 - 1 - 1, -1 + 2 - 1, -1 - 1 + 2) = (0, 0, 0)\nThis indicates that the rows are linearly dependent, which implies that the determinant of the matrix is 0.\n\nThe provided matrix A is the Cartan matrix for the affine Lie algebra $\\tilde{A}_2$. A property of affine Cartan matrices is that their determinant is always zero. The information about the Markov quiver and m_1/2 = 13 identifies this specific matrix in the context of cluster algebras and the theory of Markov numbers.\n\n<<<0>>>"
