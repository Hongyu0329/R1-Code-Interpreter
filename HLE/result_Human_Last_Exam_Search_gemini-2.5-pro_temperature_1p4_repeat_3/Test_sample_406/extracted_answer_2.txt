The conditions for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are primarily established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces and involve the functions satisfying a mixed monotone property and a contractive condition. Specifically, the spaces (X, d_X, ≤_X), (Y, d_Y, ≤_Y), and (Z, d_Z, ≤_Z) must be partially ordered complete metric spaces. The mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property and a contractive inequality that limits the distance between the function outputs based on the distance between their inputs, often involving a contraction constant less than 1. Additionally, there must exist initial points that satisfy certain order relations with respect to the functions.
