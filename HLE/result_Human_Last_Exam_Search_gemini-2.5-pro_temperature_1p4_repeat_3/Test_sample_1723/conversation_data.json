    "Based on the available information, there is no single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print. While some mushrooms exhibit a blue coloration on their caps or stems, their spore prints are typically other colors.\n\nFor instance, the genus *Entoloma* includes species with striking blue caps, such as *Entoloma hochstetteri*. However, the genus is characterized by a pink to pinkish-brown spore print. Similarly, mushrooms like the blue roundhead (*Stropharia caerulea*) and certain *Psilocybe* species can appear blue or stain blue when bruised, but they produce purple-brown to dark purple-brown spore prints.\n\nMushroom spore prints are a crucial characteristic for identification and most commonly present in shades of white, cream, pink, brown, and black. While there are some exceptions, such as the green spore print of *Chlorophyllum molybdites*, a genus with a distinctly blue spore print is not documented in the provided search results.\n\n<<<There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
