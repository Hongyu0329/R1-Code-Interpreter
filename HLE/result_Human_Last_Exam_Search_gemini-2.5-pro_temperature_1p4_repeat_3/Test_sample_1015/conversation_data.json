    "A key distinction between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods in the execution of a cambré derrière lies in the placement of the hip. While both techniques emphasize a bend from the waist backwards, their approach to the hip and torso alignment differs significantly, impacting the overall aesthetic of the movement.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, which prioritizes a stable and strong core, the hips are generally kept square and aligned with the shoulders as much as possible. The backbend is initiated from the upper back, with a focus on lengthening the spine and maintaining a sense of control and precise line. The arms are typically held in well-defined positions, such as the fifth port de bras, contributing to the classical and harmonious look.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine technique often incorporates a more dynamic and exaggerated use of the torso and hips. A characteristic of the Balanchine style is a \"three-dimensional spiral from the waist up\" and the use of \"swaying hips\". This can translate to a cambré derrière where the hip of the working leg might be slightly lifted or opened to create a more extended and dramatic line. Balanchine was known to encourage dancers to open the hip in arabesques to give the illusion of a higher leg, a principle that can be applied to other movements like the cambré derrière to achieve a similar effect of dynamism and length. This approach aligns with the overall Balanchine aesthetic that emphasizes speed, athleticism, and a more neoclassical interpretation of balletic lines.\n\nWhile there are also differences in arm placement (port de bras), speed, the degree of the backbend, and head placement between the two methods, the fundamental approach to hip placement—stable and square in Vaganova versus potentially open and dynamic in Balanchine—is a significant point of divergence.\n\n<<<B>>>"
