    "To determine the number of integer values for the side length `AC` that result in two possible values for side length `AB`, we must analyze the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines.\n\nIn triangle `ABC`, let `a = BC`, `b = AC`, and `c = AB`. We are given `a = S = SNYWR`, and `m∠B = 30°`.\n\nFor there to be two possible triangles, given two sides and a non-included angle (SSA), the following conditions must be met for the side opposite the given angle (`b` or `AC`) relative to the other given side (`a` or `BC`). Let `h` be the altitude from vertex `A` to the side `BC`. Then `h = c * sin(B)`. However, it is more useful to use the Law of Sines.\n\nApplying the Law of Sines:\n`sin(A) / a = sin(B) / b`\n`sin(A) = (a * sin(B)) / b = (S * sin(30°)) / b = (S * 0.5) / b = S / (2b)`\n\nFor angle `A` to have two possible values (`A` and `180° - A`), two conditions must be satisfied:\n1.  `0 < sin(A) < 1`. This ensures that there are two distinct solutions for angle `A` in the range `(0°, 180°)`.\n    *   `sin(A) < 1` implies `S / (2b) < 1`, which simplifies to `S < 2b`, or `b > S / 2`.\n2.  Both possible angles for `A`, when added to the given angle `B`, must be less than 180°. Let the two possible angles be `A₁` and `A₂ = 180° - A₁`.\n    *   `A₁ + B < 180°`: This is always true as `A₁` is acute.\n    *   `A₂ + B < 180°` implies `(180° - A₁) + 30° < 180°`, which simplifies to `210° - A₁ < 180°`, or `A₁ > 30°`.\n\nSince `sin(A)` is an increasing function for acute angles, `A₁ > 30°` is equivalent to `sin(A₁) > sin(30°)`.\n`S / (2b) > 0.5`, which simplifies to `S > b`.\n\nCombining these conditions, the length of side `AC` (which is `b`) must be in the range:\n`S / 2 < b < S`.\n\nThe value of `S = SNYWR` is given as 98 in the context of the Puzzlvaria 2024 competition. Substituting this value for `S`:\n`98 / 2 < AC < 98`\n`49 < AC < 98`\n\nWe need to find the number of integer values for `AC` in this interval. The possible integer values are `50, 51, 52, ..., 97`. To count these values, we calculate:\n`Number of values = Last - First + 1 = 97 - 50 + 1 = 48`.\n\nThere are 48 possible integer values for the side length `AC`.\n\n<<<48>>>"
