    "The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, when conducted with a base such as sodium ethoxide in ethanol, is **ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate**. This reaction involves a characteristic ring contraction of the initial six-membered ring into a five-membered ring.\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity (C_m) is a metric that quantifies the structural complexity of a molecule. It is based on information theory and calculates the complexity in an additive manner by assessing the microenvironment of each atom in the molecule. The calculation takes into account several factors, including:\n*   Atomic connectivity and valency\n*   Diversity of chemical groups or elements in the atom's immediate vicinity\n*   Stereochemistry\n*   Molecular symmetry\n\nThe Böttcher complexity score is expressed in \"mcbits\" (molecular complexity bits). While there is no universally published value for every chemical compound, it can be precisely calculated.\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate can be determined using a specialized Python script or a web-based tool. The Forli Lab at the Scripps Research Institute provides a \"Böttcher Score calculator\" for this purpose. The calculation can also be performed using scripts available on platforms like GitHub, which typically require the molecule's structure in a format like a SMILES string. The canonical SMILES string for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate is `CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1`.\n\nDue to the inability to execute external code or access web tools, the exact numerical value cannot be provided here. To obtain the Böttcher Molecular Complexity, one would need to use the aforementioned SMILES string with a computational tool like the one provided by the Forli Lab."
