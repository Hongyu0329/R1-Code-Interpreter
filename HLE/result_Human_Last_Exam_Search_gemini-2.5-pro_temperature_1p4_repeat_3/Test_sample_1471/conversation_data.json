    "To solve the equation, we must first convert the Roman numerals to modern numbers.\n\n*   **XXX** represents 30 (10+10+10).\n*   **XXXI** represents 31 (10+10+10+1).\n*   **DIO** is not a standard Roman numeral. A plausible interpretation, often found in puzzles, is that it represents an archaic form where \"O\" is a stand-in for the apostrophus, or backward 'C' (Ɔ). In this system, IƆ stood for 500, which is the same as D. Therefore, DIƆ would be D + IƆ, which is 500 + 500 = 1000.\n\nFollowing this interpretation, the equation becomes:\n\n(1000 / 30) - 31\n\nFirst, perform the division:\n1000 / 30 = 100 / 3 = 33.333...\n\nNext, perform the subtraction:\n33.333... - 31 = 2.333...\n\nThe answer can also be expressed as the fraction 7/3.\n\n<<<2.333...>>>"
