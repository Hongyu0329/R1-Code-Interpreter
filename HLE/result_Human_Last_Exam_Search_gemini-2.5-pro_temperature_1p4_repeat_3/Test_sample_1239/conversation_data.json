    "While the full Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional, this is due to the presence of generators that depend on arbitrary functions of time. Typically, when the \"dimension\" of this symmetry group is discussed in a finite context, it refers to the dimension of its maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra.\n\nThis prominent finite-dimensional subalgebra is known as the extended Galilei group, which has a dimension of 11. The generators of this Lie algebra are:\n\n*   **Time translation (1 generator):** This corresponds to the invariance of the equations under shifts in time.\n*   **Spatial translations (3 generators):** These reflect the invariance of the equations under shifts in spatial coordinates.\n*   **Rotations (3 generators):** The equations are invariant under rotations of the spatial coordinates.\n*   **Galilean boosts (3 generators):** These transformations relate solutions in a stationary frame to solutions in a uniformly moving frame.\n*   **Scaling (1 generator):** This refers to a specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure under which the equations remain invariant.\n\nThe infinite-dimensional nature of the full Lie group arises from an additional set of generators. One of these involves arbitrary functions of time for generalized translations in space, and another corresponds to an arbitrary function of time for a shift in pressure.\n\nTherefore, while the complete symmetry group is technically of infinite dimension, the physically most significant and frequently considered part is the 11-dimensional extended Galilei group.\n\n<<<11>>>"
