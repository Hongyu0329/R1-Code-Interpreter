    "The Grigorchuk group has a total of 7 subgroups of index 4. This is a known result from the study of the subgroup structure of this group.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how this number is determined:\n\n### Normal Subgroups of Index 4\n\nA subgroup of index 4 is normal if the corresponding quotient group is of order 4. Since the Grigorchuk group is a 2-group (all elements have order a power of 2), any quotient of order 4 must be isomorphic to the Klein four-group, V₄ (also written as ℤ₂ × ℤ₂).\n\nThe number of normal subgroups of index 4 is equivalent to the number of distinct kernels of surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group (let's denote it by G) to V₄. The abelianization of the Grigorchuk group, which is the quotient G/[G,G] where [G,G] is the commutator subgroup, is known to be isomorphic to V₄.\n\nAny homomorphism from G to an abelian group must factor through the abelianization. Therefore, any homomorphism from G to V₄ is essentially a homomorphism from G/[G,G] (which is V₄) to V₄. There is only one surjective homomorphism from V₄ to itself up to the choice of generators for the image, and its kernel is the trivial subgroup. Consequently, there is only **one** normal subgroup of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, which is its commutator subgroup [G,G].\n\n### Non-Normal Subgroups of Index 4\n\nA non-normal subgroup of index 4 corresponds to a transitive group action on 4 elements where the image of the action is a non-abelian transitive subgroup of the symmetric group S₄. As the Grigorchuk group is a 2-group, the image of any homomorphism must also be a 2-group. The only non-abelian transitive 2-subgroup of S₄ is the dihedral group of order 8, D₄.\n\nThe existence of non-normal subgroups of index 4 is therefore determined by the existence of surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to D₄. It is a known fact that such surjective homomorphisms exist.\n\nThe number of these non-normal subgroups of index 4 has been calculated to be **6**. These subgroups arise as the preimages of the four non-normal subgroups of order 2 in D₄ under the different epimorphisms from G to D₄.\n\nIn total, the Grigorchuk group has 1 normal subgroup of index 4 and 6 non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n\nThus, the total number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is 1 + 6 = 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
