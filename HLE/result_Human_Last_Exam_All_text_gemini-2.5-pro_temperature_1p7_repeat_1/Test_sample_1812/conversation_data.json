    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question**\nThe main instruction is to \"Compute the determinant of... a matrix\". The question explicitly provides this matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nThe problem asks for \\(\\det(A)\\).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the contextual information**\nThe question gives a name to the matrix A: \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". Let's break this down to see if it modifies the problem.\n*   **\"adjacency matrix\"**: In standard graph theory, an adjacency matrix has non-negative integer entries and (for a simple graph) zeros on the diagonal. The given matrix \\(A\\) has 2s on the diagonal and -1s off-diagonal. This means the term \"adjacency matrix\" is being used in a broader, more specialized context, likely from an area like Lie algebra or cluster algebra. We should not be concerned that it doesn't match the simplest definition of an adjacency matrix.\n*   **\"Markov quiver\"**: This refers to a quiver (a directed graph) associated with the Markov equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\). The study of this equation and its associated structures (like cluster algebras) leads to matrices of this type. The provided matrix \\(A\\) is well-known in this context as the Cartan matrix of the affine Lie algebra \\(\\tilde{A}_2\\), which is closely related to the Markov quiver.\n*   **\"for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\"**: The number 13 is a Markov number (a number appearing in an integer solution to the Markov equation, e.g., in the triple (1, 5, 13)). The notation \\(m_{1/2}\\) is not standard. This piece of information seems designed to be a \"red herring\"â€”extra information that is not needed for the calculation and might confuse the solver.\n*   **The word \"where:\"**: This is a crucial syntactic clue. It signifies that what follows is the definition of the object mentioned before. So, \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" *is defined to be* the matrix \\(A\\).\n\nBased on this analysis, the problem is not asking us to construct a new matrix based on the contextual information. It is simply asking for the determinant of the explicitly given matrix \\(A\\).\n\n**Step 3: List careful points to consider**\n1.  The primary task is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix \\(A\\).\n2.  The contextual information (\"Markov quiver\", \\(m_{1/2}=13\\)) is likely irrelevant for the calculation itself, as the matrix is explicitly provided.\n3.  The term \"adjacency matrix\" is used in a specific, non-elementary sense. We must use the given matrix \\(A\\), not try to construct a standard adjacency matrix.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the determinant of matrix A**\nWe need to calculate \\(\\det(A)\\) for\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nWe can use the Sarrus' rule for 3x3 matrices:\n\\(\\det(A) = (a_{11}a_{22}a_{33} + a_{12}a_{23}a_{31} + a_{13}a_{21}a_{32}) - (a_{31}a_{22}a_{13} + a_{32}a_{23}a_{11} + a_{33}a_{21}a_{12})\\)\nPlugging in the values from matrix A:\n\\(\\det(A) = (2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 + (-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1) + (-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1)) - ((-1) \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-1) + (-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1))\\)\n\\(\\det(A) = (8 - 1 - 1) - (2 + 2 + 2)\\)\n\\(\\det(A) = 6 - 6\\)\n\\(\\det(A) = 0\\)\n\nAlternatively, we can use cofactor expansion along the first row:\n\\(\\det(A) = 2 \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\\)\n\\(\\det(A) = 2 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 2 - (-1) \\cdot (-1)) + 1 \\cdot ((-1) \\cdot 2 - (-1) \\cdot (-1)) - 1 \\cdot ((-1) \\cdot (-1) - 2 \\cdot (-1))\\)\n\\(\\det(A) = 2 \\cdot (4 - 1) + 1 \\cdot (-2 - 1) - 1 \\cdot (1 + 2)\\)\n\\(\\det(A) = 2 \\cdot (3) + 1 \\cdot (-3) - 1 \\cdot (3)\\)\n\\(\\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\\)\n\\(\\det(A) = 0\\)\n\n**Step 5: Verify the result with theoretical properties**\nThe matrix \\(A\\) is singular, meaning its determinant is zero. We can show this by finding a non-zero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) such that \\(A\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\). Let's try the vector \\(\\mathbf{v} = [1, 1, 1]^T\\):\n\\[\nA\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2(1) - 1(1) - 1(1) \\\\ -1(1) + 2(1) - 1(1) \\\\ -1(1) - 1(1) + 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} 2 - 1 - 1 \\\\ -1 + 2 - 1 \\\\ -1 - 1 + 2 \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nSince there exists a non-zero vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) for which \\(A\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\), the columns of A are linearly dependent, and thus the determinant of A must be 0. This confirms our calculation.\n\nThe final answer is the value of the determinant.\n\n<<<0>>>"
