    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nThe task is to take a given DNA nucleotide sequence, identify the correct reading frame, and translate it into a protein sequence using one-letter amino acid codes. A critical piece of information is that the sequence is from the *middle* of an Open Reading Frame (ORF).\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Open Reading Frame\" (ORF) and its Implications**\n\nAn ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain a stop codon. In a typical gene, an ORF starts with a start codon (ATG) and ends with a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA). Since the given sequence is from the *middle* of an ORF, we can assume two things:\n1.  We don't need to look for a start codon (ATG) at the beginning.\n2.  The correct reading frame will be the one that is \"open,\" meaning it lacks internal stop codons.\n\n**Step 3: List the Possible Reading Frames**\n\nA DNA sequence can be read in three possible frames on the given strand. We will analyze each one.\n\n*   **Sequence:** `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n*   **Reading Frame 1 (starts at nucleotide 1):**\n    *   Codons: `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg ...`\n    *   Analysis: The fifth codon is `tag`. **TAG is a stop codon.** An ORF would not have a stop codon in the middle. Therefore, Frame 1 is incorrect.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 2 (starts at nucleotide 2):**\n    *   The first nucleotide (`g`) is ignored. We read from the second nucleotide onwards.\n    *   Codons: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (The last `c` is part of an incomplete codon).\n    *   Analysis: We scan through all 35 complete codons in this frame. There are no stop codons (`taa`, `tag`, or `tga`). This frame is \"open.\" This is very likely the correct frame.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 3 (starts at nucleotide 3):**\n    *   The first two nucleotides (`gg`) are ignored. We read from the third nucleotide onwards.\n    *   Codons: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga ...`\n    *   Analysis: The eighth codon is `tga`. **TGA is a stop codon.** There is another `tga` codon later in this frame as well. Therefore, Frame 3 is incorrect.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Correct Frame**\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 3, **Reading Frame 2** is the only frame that does not contain any stop codons. This is the correct open reading frame.\n\n**Step 5: Translate the Correct Frame (Frame 2) into a Protein Sequence**\n\nNow, we translate the sequence of codons from Frame 2 using the standard genetic code and one-letter abbreviations for amino acids.\n\n*   **Codons:** `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n*   **Translation:**\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n\n**Step 6: Assemble the Final Protein Sequence**\n\nCombining the translated amino acids gives the final protein sequence.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe correct frame is Frame 2. The resulting protein sequence is:\nDIVVSEDLNGTVEVFKSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<Frame 2: DIVVSEDLNGTVEVFKSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
