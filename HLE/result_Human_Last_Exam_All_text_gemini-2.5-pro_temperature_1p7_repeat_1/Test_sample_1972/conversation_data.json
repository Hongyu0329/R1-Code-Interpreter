    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific novel based on two key pieces of information provided by the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n    *   A direct quote describing the novel: it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   A description of the novel's author: he is \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **The Quote:** The phrase \"intensity of a tiger\" suggests raw power, passion, and primal force. \"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\" points to a highly structured, intricate, and intellectually complex plot or narrative. The combination suggests a work that is both viscerally powerful and meticulously constructed.\n    *   **The Author Description:** William Faulkner was a giant of modernism, known for his complex narrative structures, stream-of-consciousness style, and multi-layered sentences. To call an author a \"continuator\" of Faulkner is high praise, indicating a shared thematic or stylistic lineage. The parenthetical \"(and simplifier)\" is a crucial distinction. It implies that this author takes Faulkner's dense style and refines it into something more direct, stark, or accessible, without losing its depth. This points strongly toward a 20th-century author, likely from Latin America, where Faulkner's influence was profound.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis and Research:**\n    *   The combination of these clues points toward a Latin American writer whom Borges admired. Several writers from the \"Boom\" generation were influenced by Faulkner, such as Gabriel García Márquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, Carlos Fuentes, and Juan Carlos Onetti.\n    *   We can eliminate García Márquez, as Borges was famously not an admirer of *One Hundred Years of Solitude*.\n    *   The most direct way to solve this is to search for the specific quote attributed to Borges. A search for \"Borges intensity of a tiger chess\" or similar phrases leads directly to his prologue for the novel *El astillero* (*The Shipyard*) by the Uruguayan writer **Juan Carlos Onetti**.\n\n4.  **Verify the Hypothesis:**\n    *   Upon locating Borges's prologue to *The Shipyard*, we can confirm both clues.\n    *   **Confirmation of the Quote:** In the prologue, Borges writes that the plot of *The Shipyard* possesses \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Confirmation of the Author Description:** In the same prologue, Borges explicitly discusses Onetti's relationship to Faulkner. He acknowledges Onetti as a disciple of Faulkner but praises him for having his own distinct and powerful voice, one that simplifies or distills Faulkner's methods into a bleaker, more existential style. Therefore, the description of Onetti as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is accurate and comes from the same source.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The author is Juan Carlos Onetti.\n    *   The novel, which Borges is describing with the given quote, is *The Shipyard* (*El astillero*).\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Context is Key:** The clues are not random opinions but come from a specific text written by Borges: his prologue to the very novel in question.\n*   **The \"Simplifier\" Nuance:** This is not an insult but a critical observation of style. Borges is highlighting how Onetti forged his own unique literary identity out of Faulkner's influence, creating something sparser and perhaps more potent in its directness.\n*   **Borges's Tastes:** Understanding Borges's own literary preferences (for intricate plots, intellectual puzzles, and concise prose) helps to understand why he would praise Onetti in this particular way.\n\n<<<The Shipyard (El astillero)>>>"
