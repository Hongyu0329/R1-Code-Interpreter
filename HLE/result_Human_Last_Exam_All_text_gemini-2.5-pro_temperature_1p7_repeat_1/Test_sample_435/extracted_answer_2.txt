Based on its role in promoting T cell survival, persistence, and a potent memory phenotype, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to exhibit a higher and more sustained release of key effector cytokines, such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), upon antigen stimulation when compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it.
