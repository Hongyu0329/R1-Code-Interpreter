    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$. This represents the sum of the long-term, steady-state probabilities of the system being in state 0 and state 1. In a continuous-time Markov chain described by the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, the steady-state probabilities, denoted by $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, are constant over time. This implies that their time derivatives are zero: $P_i'(+\\infty) = 0$ for all states $i$.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Steady-State Equations**\n\nBy setting the time derivatives in the given system of differential equations to zero, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for the stationary probabilities $\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$:\n\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_2 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1, which provides the normalization condition:\n\n5.  $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\n**Careful Point:** The first four equations (the balance equations) are linearly dependent. Any one of them can be derived from the other three. Therefore, to solve for the four unknown probabilities, we will use three of these equations along with the normalization equation.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**\n\nWe will express $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$ using equations 1, 3, and 4.\n\n*   From equation (1):\n    $\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 = \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}}\\pi_1$\n\n*   From equation (3):\n    $(\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}}\\pi_1$\n\n*   From equation (4):\n    $\\lambda_{31}\\pi_3 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}}\\pi_2$\n    Now, substitute the expression for $\\pi_2$ into this equation:\n    $\\pi_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} \\pi_1 \\right)$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the Given Numerical Values**\n\nThe given transition rates are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n$\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n$\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n$\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n$\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n$\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nLet's compute the coefficients for the probabilities:\n\n*   For $\\pi_0$:\n    $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1$\n\n*   For $\\pi_2$:\n    The denominator is $\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23} = 0.392 + 0.008 = 0.4$.\n    $\\pi_2 = \\frac{0.4}{0.4}\\pi_1 = 1 \\cdot \\pi_1 = \\pi_1$\n\n*   For $\\pi_3$:\n    $\\pi_3 = \\frac{0.008}{0.008}\\pi_2 = 1 \\cdot \\pi_2 = \\pi_2$. Since $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$, we have $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$.\n\n**Careful Point:** Performing calculations with fractions (like 650/19) instead of premature decimal approximations helps to avoid rounding errors.\n\nSo, we have the relationships: $\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1$, $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$, and $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$.\n\n**Step 5: Use the Normalization Equation to Find $\\pi_1$**\n\nSubstitute these expressions into the normalization equation (5):\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1\\right) + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 3\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19}\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}\\right)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19}\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\nWe know $\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1$.\nSo, $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 1\\right)\\pi_1 = \\left(\\frac{650+19}{19}\\right)\\pi_1 = \\frac{669}{19}\\pi_1$.\n\nNow, substitute the value of $\\pi_1$ we found:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{669}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$.\n\nTo get a decimal representation, we perform the division:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to four decimal places gives 0.9463.\n\nFinal calculation summary:\n*   $\\pi_0 = (650/19)\\pi_1$\n*   $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$\n*   $\\pi_3 = \\pi_1$\n*   Summing them up: $(650/19 + 1 + 1 + 1)\\pi_1 = 1 \\implies \\pi_1 = 19/707$\n*   We need: $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = (650/19+1)\\pi_1 = (669/19)\\pi_1 = (669/19) * (19/707) = 669/707$.\n\nFinal Answer is $669/707$.\n\n<<<0.9462517680056577>>>"
