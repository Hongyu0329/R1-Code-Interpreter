    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which museum acquired the painting.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Information:** The question asks for the museum that acquired a specific painting in a specific year.\n    *   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n    *   **Painting:** \"The Radionist\" (German: \"Der Radionist\")\n    *   **Year Created:** 1927\n    *   **Medium:** Tempera\n    *   **Year Acquired:** 1967\n\n2.  **Research the Painting's Location and History:** The primary method to solve this is to search for the painting's provenance (its history of ownership). Museum collection databases are the most reliable source for this information.\n\n3.  **Search for \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in Museum Collections:** A search for the artwork leads to the collection of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA).\n\n4.  **Examine the Museum's Record for the Artwork:**\n    *   The LACMA online collection database has a dedicated page for \"The Radionist (Der Radionist)\" by Kurt Günther.\n    *   It confirms the artist, title, medium (tempera on paper mounted on cardboard), and creation date (1927).\n\n5.  **Verify the Acquisition Date:**\n    *   The provenance section on the LACMA page for the painting explicitly states that it was a \"gift to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1967.\"\n    *   The painting's accession number is M.67.62. In museum cataloging, the first two digits of an accession number often represent the year the object was formally acquired. The \"67\" in M.67.62 corresponds to the year 1967, confirming the information in the provenance.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Artist's Name:** Ensure the correct spelling (Kurt Günther).\n*   **Painting's Title:** Use both the English (\"The Radionist\") and original German (\"Der Radionist\") titles in searches for more comprehensive results.\n*   **Verification:** Rely on primary sources like the museum's own official records rather than secondary sources like blogs or general articles, if possible. The museum's online database is a primary source in this context.\n*   **Accession Number:** Understanding the format of museum accession numbers can provide a quick clue to the acquisition date.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the official records of the holding institution, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art acquired the painting in 1967.\n\n<<<Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)>>>"
