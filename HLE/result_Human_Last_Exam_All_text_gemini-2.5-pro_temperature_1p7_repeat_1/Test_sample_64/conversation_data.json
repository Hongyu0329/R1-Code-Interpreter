    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word and its reading.**\nThe word in question is the kanji 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 2: Break the word down into morae.**\nIn Japanese, pitch accent is based on morae (syllabic units). The word 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to) is composed of four morae:\n1.  お (o)\n2.  と (to)\n3.  う (u) - this lengthens the vowel of 'to'\n4.  と (to)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the pitch accent pattern.**\nTo find the standard pitch accent, we can refer to a Japanese pitch accent dictionary.\nThe standard pitch accent for 「弟」 (おとうと) is designated as **[0]**.\n\n**Step 4: Understand what the [0] accent pattern means.**\nThe number [0] corresponds to the **Heiban (平板)** type accent.\n\n**Careful Points & Characteristics of Each Pattern:**\n\n*   **Heiban (平板) [0]:** The pitch is low on the first mora and rises on the second. It then remains high for all subsequent morae of the word. Crucially, a particle following a Heiban word will also be pronounced with a high pitch.\n    *   For 「おとうと」: お(Low) - とうと(High).\n    *   With a particle like 「が」: お(Low) - とうと(High) - が(High).\n\n*   **Atamadaka (頭高) [1]:** The pitch is high on the first mora and then drops for all subsequent morae.\n    *   Example for a 4-mora word: High - Low - Low - Low.\n\n*   **Nakadaka (中高):** The pitch starts low, rises somewhere in the middle of the word, and then falls *before* the last mora. The number designation (e.g., [2], [3]) indicates on which mora the pitch falls.\n    *   Example for a 4-mora word with a [3] accent: Low - High - High - Low.\n\n*   **Odaka (尾高):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. A particle following the word will be pronounced with a low pitch, which is the key difference from Heiban.\n    *   Example for a 4-mora word: Low - High - High - High.\n    *   With a particle like 「が」: Low - High - High - High - Low.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the analysis to the question.**\nSince the standard accent for 「弟」 is [0], its pattern is **Heiban**.\n\n**Step 6: Match the finding with the answer choices.**\n*   A. **Heiban**: This matches our analysis.\n*   B. Atamadaka: Incorrect.\n*   C. Nakadaka: Incorrect.\n*   D. Odaka: Incorrect. The similar-sounding word 「妹」(いもうと) has an Odaka [4] accent, but 「弟」 does not.\n*   E. Heiban or Nakadaka: Incorrect, as the standard pattern is consistently Heiban.\n\nTherefore, the correct pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 is Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
