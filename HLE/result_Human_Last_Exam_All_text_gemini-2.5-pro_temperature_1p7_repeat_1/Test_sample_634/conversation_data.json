    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understand the Concept of GCRD**\n\nA polynomial matrix `G(s)` is a common right divisor of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` if there exist polynomial matrices `Q1(s)` and `Q2(s)` such that:\n`P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s)`\n`P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s)`\n\n`G(s)` is a greatest common right divisor (GCRD) if any other common right divisor `D(s)` is also a right divisor of `G(s)`. The GCRD is not unique; if `G(s)` is a GCRD, then so is `U(s)G(s)` where `U(s)` is any unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant). We usually seek a \"simple\" or canonical form for the GCRD.\n\n**2. Set up the Euclidean Algorithm**\n\nThe standard method to find the GCRD is to use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. We form a stacked matrix `M(s)` by combining `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`, and then reduce it using elementary row operations.\n\nLet `P1(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]` and `P2(s) = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]`.\n\nThe stacked matrix `M(s)` is:\n`M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)]`\n```\nM(s) =\n[R1:  s^2 + s,   -s ]\n[R2: -s^2 - 1,   s^2]\n[R3:      s,     0  ]\n[R4:   -s - 1,    1  ]\n```\n\n**3. Perform Elementary Row Operations to Reduce the Matrix**\n\nThe goal is to simplify this 4x2 matrix into a 2x2 matrix through row operations, which will represent the GCRD. A good strategy is to create a simple row, preferably with a constant entry, to use as a pivot.\n\n*   **Step 1: Simplify a row.**\n    Let's create a simpler row by adding R3 to R4.\n    `R4_new = R4 + R3 = [-s - 1 + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]`\n    Our matrix is now row-equivalent to:\n    ```\n    [  s^2 + s,   -s ]\n    [ -s^2 - 1,   s^2]\n    [      s,     0  ]\n    [     -1,     1  ]  (Let's call this new R4')\n    ```\n\n*   **Step 2: Use the simple row as a pivot.**\n    Now we use R4' to eliminate the first column entries in the other rows.\n    *   `R1_new = R1 + (s^2 + s) * R4' = [s^2+s, -s] + (s^2+s)*[-1, 1] = [s^2+s - s^2-s, -s + s^2+s] = [0, s^2]`\n    *   `R2_new = R2 - (s^2 + 1) * R4' = [-s^2-1, s^2] - (s^2+1)*[-1, 1] = [-s^2-1 + s^2+1, s^2 - (s^2+1)] = [0, -1]`\n    *   `R3_new = R3 + s * R4' = [s, 0] + s*[-1, 1] = [s - s, s] = [0, s]`\n\n    The matrix is now row-equivalent to:\n    ```\n    [  0,   s^2]\n    [  0,   -1 ]\n    [  0,    s ]\n    [ -1,    1 ]\n    ```\n\n*   **Step 3: Further reduction.**\n    We can see a block of rows with `0` in the first column. We can use the row `[0, -1]` to eliminate the other rows in this block. Let's call the row `[0, -1]` the pivot row `R_pivot`.\n    *   Eliminate `[0, s^2]`: `[0, s^2] + s^2 * R_pivot = [0, s^2] + [0, -s^2] = [0, 0]`\n    *   Eliminate `[0, s]`: `[0, s] + s * R_pivot = [0, s] + [0, -s] = [0, 0]`\n\n    After these operations, the matrix becomes equivalent to:\n    ```\n    [  0,    0 ]\n    [  0,   -1 ]\n    [  0,    0 ]\n    [ -1,    1 ]\n    ```\n\n*   **Step 4: Extract the GCRD.**\n    The non-zero rows are `[0, -1]` and `[-1, 1]`. These rows form a basis for the row space of the GCRD. We can arrange them into a 2x2 matrix. It is conventional to arrange them in a triangular form.\n    `G(s) = [[-1, 1], [0, -1]]`\n\n**4. Finalize the Answer in Canonical Form**\n\nThe matrix `G(s)` we found is a valid GCRD. However, GCRDs are often presented in a canonical form, such as being upper triangular with monic diagonal entries (leading coefficient of 1).\n\nTo get this form from `G(s) = [[-1, 1], [0, -1]]`:\n1.  Multiply the first row by -1: `[1, -1]`\n2.  Multiply the second row by -1: `[0, 1]`\n\nThis gives the final GCRD in a standard canonical form:\n`G_final(s) = [[1, -1], [0, 1]]`\n\n**5. Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\nWe can check that this matrix is a unimodular matrix, as its determinant is `1*1 - (-1)*0 = 1`, which is a non-zero constant. A unimodular GCRD means the original matrices `P1` and `P2` are \"right coprime\". We can also verify that `G_final(s)` is a right divisor of both `P1` and `P2` by showing that `P1(s) * G_final(s)^-1` and `P2(s) * G_final(s)^-1` are both polynomial matrices. This was shown to be correct during the scratchpad thinking process.\n\n<<<[[1, -1], [0, 1]]>>>"
