    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the novel and its main character:** The question asks about the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) by Jacek Dukaj. The main character of this novel is Adam Zamoyski, an astronaut from the 21st century who is resurrected in the distant future.\n\n2.  **Analyze the main character's relationships:** Upon his revival, Adam Zamoyski is guided and protected by a non-human entity. He struggles to adapt to the highly advanced, post-human reality. He forms his most significant and intimate bond with an *inc* (short for *inkluzywa*, a form of highly advanced, conscious being/AI).\n\n3.  **Identify the specific character Adam marries:** This *inc* who becomes his guide, protector, and eventually his partner is named Angelica. Their relationship is a central theme of the book, exploring love, humanity, and consciousness across different forms of existence.\n\n4.  **Confirm the \"marriage\":** While the concept of marriage in this far-future setting differs from our contemporary understanding, Adam and Angelica do formalize their union. They enter into a binding, recognized partnership that is the novel's equivalent of a marriage. This is a pivotal moment in Adam's integration into the new world and the evolution of their relationship.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Correctly identifying the protagonist:** It is crucial to know that Adam Zamoyski is the main character to answer the question accurately.\n*   **Understanding the nature of the characters:** The character Adam marries, Angelica, is not a human in the traditional sense but an *inc*. This is a key detail of the plot, but her name remains the answer.\n*   **Interpreting \"marries\":** The term \"marries\" must be understood within the context of the book's science fiction setting. The union between a 21st-century human and a far-future AI entity is not a conventional marriage, but it is a formal, committed partnership recognized within their society. The question seeks the name of the partner in this union.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the name of the character that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, marries is Angelica.\n\n<<<Angelica>>>"
