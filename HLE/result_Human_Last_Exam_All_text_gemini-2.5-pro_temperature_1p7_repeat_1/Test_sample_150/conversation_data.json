    "Answering the user's question involves a two-part process. First, we must analyze the provided Java program to see if it correctly solves the given problem. Second, if it does not, we must determine the characteristics of the most efficient C program that *does* solve the problem.\n\n### Part 1: Analysis of the Java Program\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem Specification**\nThe problem requires us to process `n` statements and calculate the final value of a variable `x` that starts at 0. There are two operations, `++` (increment) and `--` (decrement). The crucial detail is that a statement consists of one operation and the variable `X` written in **any order**. This means there are four possible valid statements:\n1.  `++X` (Increment)\n2.  `X++` (Increment)\n3.  `--X` (Decrement)\n4.  `X--` (Decrement)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Provided Java Code's Logic**\nThe core logic of the submitted Java program is inside the `while` loop:\n```java\nString test = inpt.next();\nif (test.contains(\"++X\"))\n{\n    tresult++;\n}\nif (test.contains(\"--X\"))\n{\n    tresult--;\n}\n```\nThis code reads a statement string and checks if it contains the substring `++X` or `--X`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Flaw**\nThe code correctly handles the statements `++X` and `--X`. However, it completely fails to handle the other two valid statement formats, `X++` and `X--`.\n- If the input is `X++`, the condition `test.contains(\"++X\")` is false, so no increment occurs.\n- If the input is `X--`, the condition `test.contains(\"--X\")` is false, so no decrement occurs.\n\n**Conclusion for Part 1:** The program is **incorrect** as it does not handle all possible valid inputs as described in the problem statement. The answer must therefore begin with 'N'.\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: Analysis of an Optimal C Solution\n\nNow we must determine the values for `x` (character comparisons) and `y` (memory in bytes) for the most efficient C solution for an input of 100 instructions.\n\n**Step 1: Designing the Most Efficient C Logic (Speed)**\nThe goal is to determine whether to increment or decrement with the minimum number of operations.\n- The input strings are always three characters long.\n- We don't need to parse the whole string or use functions like `strcmp`. We can find a simpler pattern.\n- Let's look at the four possibilities: `++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`.\n- A key observation is that the character at the middle position (index 1) uniquely identifies the operation.\n    - In `++X`, the middle character is `+`.\n    - In `X++`, the middle character is `+`.\n    - In `--X`, the middle character is `-`.\n    - In `X--`, the middle character is `-`.\n- Therefore, the fastest logic is to read the 3-character string and check only the character at index 1. This requires only **one character comparison** per statement.\n\n**Step 2: Calculating `x` (Total Character Comparisons)**\nFor an input of 100 instructions, using the most efficient logic described above:\n- Comparisons per instruction = 1\n- Total comparisons (`x`) = 100 instructions * 1 comparison/instruction = **100**.\n\n**Step 3: Designing the Most Efficient C Logic (Memory)**\nThe goal is to use the minimum amount of memory. We need variables to store:\n1.  The number of statements, `n`. (`int`)\n2.  The result, `x`. (`int`)\n3.  The input string for each statement. A `char` array of size 4 is needed (`c`, `c`, `c`, `\\0`).\n4.  A loop counter is typically needed (`int i`), but we can optimize this away by using `n` as a countdown timer in a `while` loop (e.g., `while (n--)`).\n\nThe minimal set of variables is:\n- `int n;` (typically 4 bytes)\n- `int result;` (typically 4 bytes)\n- `char statement[4];` (4 * 1 byte = 4 bytes)\n\nTotal minimum memory size (`y`) for variables = 4 + 4 + 4 = **12 bytes**.\n\n**Step 4: Assembling the Final Answer**\nBased on the analysis:\n- The program is **Not** correct, so the answer starts with `N`.\n- `x` (smallest number of comparisons) is `100`.\n- `y` (smallest memory size) is `12`.\n- The final answer follows the format `Nx+y`.\n\nFinal Answer String: `N100+12`.\n\n<<<N100+12>>>"
