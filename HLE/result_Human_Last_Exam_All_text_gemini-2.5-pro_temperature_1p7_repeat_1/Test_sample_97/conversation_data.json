    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Step 1: Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria**\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, it can dissolve via two main pathways. We must also consider the autoionization of water, as it establishes the initial pH and participates in the reactions.\n\n1.  **Dissolution to form Al³⁺ ion:** The solid dissolves to produce aluminum ions and hydroxide ions. The equilibrium is described by the solubility product constant, $K_{sp}$.\n    $Al(OH)_3(s) \\rightleftharpoons Al^{3+}(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)$\n    $K_{sp} = [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 \\times 10^{-27}$\n\n2.  **Dissolution to form a complex ion:** The solid can also react with hydroxide ions present in the water to form the soluble tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, $Al(OH)_4^-$.\n    $Al(OH)_3(s) + OH^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons Al(OH)_4^-(aq)$\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction, let's call it $K_c$, can be found by combining the $K_{sp}$ and the formation constant ($K_f$) for the complex ion.\n    The formation reaction is: $Al^{3+}(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons Al(OH)_4^-(aq)$\n    $K_f = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^-]}{[Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4} = 1.1 \\times 10^{31}$\n    By multiplying $K_{sp}$ and $K_f$, we get:\n    $K_{sp} \\times K_f = ([Al^{3+}][OH^-]^3) \\times (\\frac{[Al(OH)_4^-]}{[Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4}) = \\frac{[Al(OH)_4^-]}{[OH^-]} = K_c$\n    $K_c = (5.3 \\times 10^{-27}) \\times (1.1 \\times 10^{31}) = 5.83 \\times 10^4$\n\n3.  **Autoionization of Water:** Water itself is in equilibrium, which determines the relationship between $[H^+]$ and $[OH^-]$.\n    $H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$\n    $K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** It is crucial to recognize that both dissolution pathways contribute to the total solubility and that the dissolution process will alter the pH of the water. We cannot assume the final pH is 7.\n\n**Step 2: Define Solubility and Set Up Equations**\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n$S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\nTo solve for the unknown concentrations, we use a charge balance equation for the solution. The sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges.\nCharge Balance: $3[Al^{3+}] + [H^+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\n**Step 3: Solve for the Equilibrium Concentrations**\nWe can express all concentrations in the charge balance equation in terms of a single variable, $[OH^-]$.\n*   $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}$\n*   $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_c[OH^-] = (K_{sp}K_f)[OH^-]$\n*   $[H^+] = \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]}$\n\nSubstitute these into the charge balance equation:\n$3 \\left( \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} \\right) + \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = [OH^-] + (K_{sp}K_f)[OH^-]$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This equation can be solved exactly, but it leads to a complicated polynomial. A valid simplification can be made by analyzing the relative magnitudes of the terms. In solutions of amphoteric hydroxides near neutral pH, the concentrations of the dissolved metal species ($[Al^{3+}]$ and $[Al(OH)_4^-]$) are often much larger than the concentrations of H⁺ and OH⁻ from water. Let's assume this is true and check later.\nThis simplifies the charge balance equation to:\n$3[Al^{3+}] \\approx [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\nNow substitute the expressions for the aluminum species:\n$3 \\left( \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} \\right) \\approx (K_{sp}K_f)[OH^-]$\n\nWe can cancel $K_{sp}$ from both sides:\n$\\frac{3}{[OH^-]^3} \\approx K_f[OH^-]$\n$3 \\approx K_f[OH^-]^4$\n\nSolve for $[OH^-]$:\n$[OH^-]^4 \\approx \\frac{3}{K_f} = \\frac{3}{1.1 \\times 10^{31}} = 2.727 \\times 10^{-31}$\n$[OH^-] \\approx (2.727 \\times 10^{-31})^{1/4} = 2.285 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ mol/L}$\n\n**Step 4: Check the Simplification and Calculate Final Concentrations**\nNow we can check if our assumption was valid.\n$[OH^-] = 2.285 \\times 10^{-8}$ M\n$[H^+] = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}}{2.285 \\times 10^{-8}} = 4.376 \\times 10^{-7}$ M\n\nNow find the concentrations of the aluminum species:\n$[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_c[OH^-] = (5.83 \\times 10^4)(2.285 \\times 10^{-8}) = 1.332 \\times 10^{-3}$ M\n$[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3} = \\frac{5.3 \\times 10^{-27}}{(2.285 \\times 10^{-8})^3} = 4.44 \\times 10^{-4}$ M\n\nLet's check the charge balance:\nSimplified: $3[Al^{3+}] = 3(4.44 \\times 10^{-4}) = 1.332 \\times 10^{-3}$ M. This is indeed approximately equal to $[Al(OH)_4^-]$.\nFull:\nLeft Side = $3[Al^{3+}] + [H^+] = 1.332 \\times 10^{-3} + 4.376 \\times 10^{-7} \\approx 1.332 \\times 10^{-3}$\nRight Side = $[OH^-] + [Al(OH)_4^-] = 2.285 \\times 10^{-8} + 1.332 \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 1.332 \\times 10^{-3}$\nThe charges balance, and the concentrations of $[H^+]$ and $[OH^-]$ are negligible compared to the aluminum species, so the simplification was valid.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The total solubility is the sum of *both* aluminum species. It would be an error to report only the dominant species, as both are significant.\n\n**Step 5: Acquire the Final Answer**\nCalculate the total solubility, S.\n$S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n$S = (4.44 \\times 10^{-4}) + (1.33 \\times 10^{-3})$\n$S = 0.000444 + 0.00133$\n$S = 0.001774 \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$\n\nThe given constants have two significant figures. Rounding the final answer to two significant figures:\n$S = 1.8 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}$\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
