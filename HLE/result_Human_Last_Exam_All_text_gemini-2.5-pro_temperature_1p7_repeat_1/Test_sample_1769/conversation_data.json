    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Current Word and its Origin:** The Modern English word is \"sister\". To understand what it *would* have been, we must first understand its actual etymology. \"Sister\" derives from Middle English *sister*, which itself is a product of two similar words merging:\n    *   The native Old English word was **sweostor**.\n    *   The Old Norse word, brought by Viking invaders, was **systir**.\n    *   Both of these words come from the same even older root, Proto-Germanic *\\*swestēr*. Because they were so similar, they influenced each other. However, the modern form \"sister\", particularly with its \"i\" vowel sound, is much closer phonetically to the Old Norse *systir* than the Old English *sweostor*. In essence, the Norse version became dominant, especially in the north of England (the Danelaw), and eventually became the standard form across the country.\n\n2.  **Establish the Counterfactual Scenario:** The question asks what the word would be if the Norse had *never* invaded or interacted with the Anglo-Saxons. This means we must remove the influence of Old Norse *systir* from the equation.\n\n3.  **Trace the Native Word's Evolution:** Without Norse influence, the Modern English word would have to be a direct descendant of the Old English word, **sweostor**. We need to trace how this word would have evolved through natural English sound changes over the centuries.\n\n4.  **From Old English to Middle English:** As Old English transitioned into Middle English, the word *sweostor* began to change. In dialects with less Norse influence (primarily in the South and West of England), *sweostor* was simplified. A common simplification was the dropping of the 'w' sound after 's', leading to forms like **suster**. This form is well-attested; for example, it is the word used in John Wycliffe's late 14th-century translation of the Bible. Other variants like *swester* also existed but *suster* was very common in non-Norse influenced areas.\n\n5.  **From Middle English to Modern English:** The next step is to project the Middle English form *suster* forward into Modern English. We can do this by looking at how similarly structured words changed over the same period.\n    *   The key change is the **Foot-STRUT split**, a major vowel shift that occurred between Middle and Modern English.\n    *   This shift changed the vowel sound /ʊ/ (as in p**u**t) to /ʌ/ (as in c**u**p or str**u**t).\n    *   We can see this exact change in other words that had a 'u' in Middle English, such as *sunne* becoming \"sun\", and *butere* becoming \"butter\".\n    *   Applying this standard sound change to the Middle English word *suster* /ˈsʊstər/, the vowel /ʊ/ would shift to /ʌ/.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on the Final Form:** Following the natural and documented path of English linguistic evolution, without the intervention of Old Norse, the Old English *sweostor* would have become Middle English *suster*, which in turn would have become the Modern English **Suster** (pronounced /ˈsʌstər/, rhyming with \"buster\").\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Cognates vs. Borrowing:** This is not a simple case of borrowing a new word. It's a case where a very similar-sounding Norse word (*systir*) influenced and ultimately replaced the native cognate (*sweostor*) in the standard language.\n*   **Dialectal Variation:** The form *suster* was a real word in Middle English, not just a hypothetical one. Its use in southern dialects is key evidence for what would have happened without northern Norse influence.\n*   **Parallel Evolution:** We can look at other Germanic languages for clues. The Dutch word is *zuster* and the German is *Schwester*. These show similar, but not identical, evolutionary paths from the same Proto-Germanic root, strengthening the case that an \"s-t-r\" form was the likely outcome.\n*   **Phonetic Likelihood:** The modern \"i\" sound in \"sister\" is a strong indicator of Norse influence. The path from the Old English *eo* diphthong in *sweostor* to a modern \"i\" sound is not a standard phonological development in English. This confirms that the Norse word was the primary source of our modern version.\n\nBy removing the historically documented influence of Old Norse, we are left with the word that was already developing natively in English.\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
