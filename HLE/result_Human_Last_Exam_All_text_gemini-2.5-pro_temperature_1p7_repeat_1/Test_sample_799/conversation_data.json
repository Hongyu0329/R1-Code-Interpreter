    "This is a problem at the intersection of additive combinatorics and geometric measure theory. To find the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in $[0, 1]$, we need to establish an upper bound for the dimension and then show that this bound is achievable by constructing a set with that dimension.\n\n### Step 1: Definitions\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms.\n\n*   **Sidon Set:** A set $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if for any four elements $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \\in S$, the equation $x_1 + x_2 = x_3 + x_4$ implies that the multisets $\\{x_1, x_2\\}$ and $\\{x_3, x_4\\}$ are the same. This means either $x_1 = x_3$ and $x_2 = x_4$, or $x_1 = x_4$ and $x_2 = x_3$. Essentially, each number in the sumset $S+S = \\{s_1+s_2 | s_1, s_2 \\in S\\}$ has a unique representation as a sum of two elements from $S$ (up to permutation).\n\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** The Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\dim_H(A)$, is a way of measuring the \"fractal\" dimension of a set $A$. It generalizes the notion of dimension to sets that are not smooth manifolds. For a set in $\\mathbb{R}$, its Hausdorff dimension is a number between 0 and 1. A finite set has dimension 0, while an interval has dimension 1. Sets like the middle-third Cantor set have dimensions between 0 and 1.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing an Upper Bound\n\nThe Sidon property imposes a strong arithmetic constraint on a set. This \"arithmetic sparseness\" limits how \"large\" the set can be in the sense of Hausdorff dimension.\n\nA major result in this area, proved by Tomasz Łuczak and Tomasz Schoen (2000), states that if a Borel set $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ has a Hausdorff dimension greater than 1/2, i.e., $\\dim_H(E) > 1/2$, then $E$ cannot be a Sidon set.\n\n**Theorem (Łuczak & Schoen):** If $E \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is a Sidon set, then $\\dim_H(E) \\le 1/2$.\n\n**Intuitive argument:**\n1.  The Hausdorff dimension of a sum of two sets, $A+B$, is often related to the sum of their individual dimensions. A general (though not universally true) principle is that $\\dim_H(A+B) \\approx \\min(1, \\dim_H(A) + \\dim_H(B))$.\n2.  The Sidon property prevents \"collapses\" in the sumset $S+S$. When we form the sumset, the number of distinct sums is maximized because there are no extra additive relations. This suggests that for a Sidon set $S$, the relationship $\\dim_H(S+S) = \\dim_H(S) + \\dim_H(S) = 2 \\dim_H(S)$ should hold (provided the result is $\\le 1$).\n3.  The set $S$ is a subset of the interval $[0, 1]$. Therefore, the sumset $S+S$ must be a subset of the interval $[0, 2]$.\n4.  Any subset of the real line has a Hausdorff dimension of at most 1. So, $\\dim_H(S+S) \\le 1$.\n5.  Combining these points, we get the inequality: $2 \\dim_H(S) \\le 1$.\n6.  This implies $\\dim_H(S) \\le 1/2$.\n\nThe rigorous proof of the theorem is much more involved, relying on Frostman measures and Fourier analysis, but this heuristic provides a good conceptual foundation. This establishes that the maximum possible dimension is no more than 1/2.\n\n### Step 3: Existence of a Sidon Set with Dimension 1/2\n\nTo show that 1/2 is the maximum value, we need to demonstrate that this upper bound can be achieved. This requires constructing a Sidon set $S \\subset [0, 1]$ such that $\\dim_H(S) = 1/2$.\n\nSuch constructions exist and are a significant result in the field. One of the key constructions is due to Thomas Körner (1983).\n\n*   **Körner's Construction:** Körner used a sophisticated probabilistic method to construct a compact set $S \\subset [0, 1]$ that is a Sidon set and has a Hausdorff dimension of exactly 1/2. The method involves creating a measure supported on the set $S$ and showing that its Fourier transform has certain decay properties. These properties, via theorems connecting Fourier decay to the dimension of the support (like a variant of Frostman's Lemma), imply that the dimension of the set $S$ must be at least 1/2.\n\nSince we already know from Step 2 that the dimension cannot exceed 1/2, the dimension of the constructed set must be exactly 1/2. The existence of such a set proves that the upper bound of 1/2 is sharp (i.e., it is attainable).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  The Hausdorff dimension of any Sidon set in $[0, 1]$ is at most 1/2.\n2.  There exist Sidon sets in $[0, 1]$ whose Hausdorff dimension is exactly 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1/2.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
