    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to determine the number of specific anatomical features (depressions) within another anatomical structure (the lacrimal recess) of a particular dinosaur species (*Irritator challengeri*).\n\n*   **Subject:** *Irritator challengeri* (a spinosaurid dinosaur).\n*   **Anatomical Location:** The skull, specifically the lacrimal bone.\n*   **Feature in Question:** The \"lacrimal recess\" (also known as the sublacrimal fossa).\n*   **Specific Detail:** The number of \"depressions\" contained *within* this recess.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Primary Scientific Source**\nTo answer such a specific anatomical question, we must refer to the primary scientific literature describing the holotype specimen of *Irritator challengeri* (specimen number SMNS 58022). The key and most detailed publication on this subject is:\n*   Sues, H. D., Frey, E., Martill, D. M., & Scott, D. M. (2002). *Irritator challengeri*, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil. *Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology*, 22(3), 535-547.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone in the Source**\nWithin this paper, the authors provide a detailed osteological (bone-by-bone) description of the skull. We need to find the section describing the lacrimal bone and its surface features. The lacrimal forms the back and upper border of the large opening in front of the eye socket (the antorbital fenestra). The recess in question is located on the outer surface of this bone.\n\nThe paper states:\n> \"The lateral surface of the main body of the lacrimal is deeply excavated by the antorbital fossa. **This fossa is subdivided into two distinct depressions**, a smaller, circular anterodorsal depression and a much larger, triangular posteroventral one.\"\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the Anatomical Description**\nThe analysis of the scientific description reveals the following:\n*   The lacrimal recess is not a single, simple depression.\n*   It is explicitly described as being \"subdivided.\"\n*   The number of subdivisions is clearly stated as \"two distinct depressions.\"\n*   These two depressions are even described by their shape and relative position: one is smaller and circular (anterodorsal), and the other is larger and triangular (posteroventral).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Source Reliability:** The answer must be based on the direct scientific description of the actual fossil, not on artistic reconstructions or general information about spinosaurs, which might not capture this level of detail. The Sues et al. (2002) paper is the authoritative source.\n2.  **Anatomical Terminology:** It's crucial to understand that the \"lacrimal recess\" refers to the larger fossa on the lacrimal bone, and the question asks how many smaller depressions are *inside* it. The paper uses the term \"subdivided\" which directly addresses this.\n3.  **Specificity:** The finding is specific to *Irritator challengeri*. While other spinosaurids like *Baryonyx* or *Spinosaurus* also have a lacrimal recess, its internal structure may differ. The question is only about *Irritator*.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the direct description in the peer-reviewed paleontological paper that describes the holotype of *Irritator challengeri*, the lacrimal recess is divided into two distinct depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
