Yes, the theory can fail. The inversion process relies on applying the inverse of each system component in reverse order (e.g., `T^-1` to undo the effect of `T`). Adding a birefringent layer `B` changes the system. If one tries to use the original inversion matrix `T^-1` on the output from the new system `(B*T)`, the result is proportional to `(T^-1 * B * T) * E_in`. Because the Jones matrices for the birefringent plate (`B`) and the random medium (`T`) do not generally commute, the term `T^-1 * B * T` is not the identity matrix. Therefore, the original input beam `E_in` is not recovered, and the theory fails.
