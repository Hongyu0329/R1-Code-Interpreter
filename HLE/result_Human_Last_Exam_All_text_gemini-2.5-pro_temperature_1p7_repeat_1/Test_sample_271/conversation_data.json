    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the possible degrees of the specified normal field extensions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial**\n\nLet $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We try to find factors of this polynomial. By rearranging terms, we can see a common factor:\n$P(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nThis reveals a common factor of $(x^2-2)$:\n$P(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$\n\nLet $f(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n*   $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$, or because its roots $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$ are not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 3. All other coefficients (0, 0, -9, 3) are divisible by 3. The constant term 3 is not divisible by $3^2=9$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of each factor**\n\nLet $K_f$ be the splitting field of $f(x)$ and $K_g$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$.\n*   The splitting field of $f(x)=x^2-2$ is $K_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a normal extension of degree 2. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n*   For $g(x)=x^5 - 9x + 3$, we determine its Galois group, which is a subgroup of $S_5$. Since $g(x)$ is irreducible of degree 5, its Galois group must be a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\n    To identify which subgroup it is, we find the number of real roots.\n    $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The real roots of $g'(x)$ are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    We evaluate $g(x)$ at these critical points:\n    $g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (9/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} - 9\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 = 3 - (36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} < 0$ since $\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 1$.\n    $g(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = -(9/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 9\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 = 3 + (36/5)\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 0$.\n    Since $g(x) \\to \\pm\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, and the local maximum is positive while the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots and thus two complex conjugate roots.\n    A theorem states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has exactly $p-2$ real roots, its Galois group is the symmetric group $S_p$. Here, $p=5$, and there are $5-2=3$ real roots.\n    Therefore, the Galois group of $g(x)$ is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The degree of the extension $K_g/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $|S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the full polynomial**\n\nThe splitting field of $P(x)$ is $K$, the compositum of $K_f$ and $K_g$, i.e., $K = K_f K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\text{roots of } g(x))$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is given by the direct product of the individual Galois groups if their intersection is trivial, i.e., $K_f \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe field $K_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field.\nThe field $K_g$ has exactly one quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$, where $\\Delta_g$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n)$.\nFor $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$\\Delta_g = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nSince $\\Delta_g < 0$, the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$ is an imaginary quadratic field.\nThe intersection of a real quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and an imaginary quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$ is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, $K_f \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis means the Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of this group is $|G| = |C_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$. So $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the possible degrees of normal sub-extensions**\n\nWe are looking for the degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between intermediate fields $L$ and subgroups of $G$. The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if its corresponding subgroup, $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$, is a normal subgroup of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nThe condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ implies that the corresponding normal subgroup $H$ must be a proper, non-trivial subgroup of $G$, i.e., $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$.\nThe degree of the extension is given by $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ (for $n\\ge 5, S_n$ has only three normal subgroups) are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ include subgroups of the form $H_1 \\times H_2$, where $H_1 \\triangleleft G_1$ and $H_2 \\triangleleft G_2$. We list the proper non-trivial ones:\n1.  $H_1 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$. $|H_1| = 1 \\cdot |A_5| = 60$.\n2.  $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$. $|H_2| = 1 \\cdot |S_5| = 120$.\n3.  $H_3 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$. $|H_3| = |C_2| \\cdot 1 = 2$.\n4.  $H_4 = C_2 \\times A_5$. $|H_4| = |C_2| \\cdot |A_5| = 2 \\cdot 60 = 120$.\n\nThere can also be \"diagonal\" normal subgroups. In the case of $C_2 \\times S_5$, there is one such subgroup. Let $\\sigma: C_2 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\}$ be the canonical isomorphism and $\\text{sgn}: S_5 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\}$ be the sign homomorphism. Both are group homomorphisms.\n5.  $H_5 = \\{(c,s) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\sigma(c) = \\text{sgn}(s)\\}$. This is a normal subgroup. Its elements are of the form $(e, a)$ where $a \\in A_5$ (so $\\text{sgn}(a)=1$) and $(c, t)$ where $c$ is the non-identity element of $C_2$ and $t \\in S_5 \\setminus A_5$ is an odd permutation (so $\\text{sgn}(t)=-1$). The order is $|H_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n\nThese five subgroups constitute the complete list of proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the degrees**\n\nFinally, we calculate the degree $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|H| = 240/|H|$ for each normal subgroup $H$.\n1.  For $H_1 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240 / 60 = 4$.\n2.  For $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n3.  For $H_3 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n4.  For $H_4 = C_2 \\times A_5$, $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n5.  For $H_5$ (the diagonal subgroup), $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n\nThe distinct values for the degrees are 2, 4, and 120.\n\nThe list of all possible degrees of such normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
