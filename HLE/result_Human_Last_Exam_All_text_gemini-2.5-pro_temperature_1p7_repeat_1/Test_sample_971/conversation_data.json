    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pirouettes performed by Natalia Osipova.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Performance Details**\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Ballet Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n*   **Act:** Act I\n*   **Variation:** Kitri's solo variation in Act I (the one with the castanets).\n*   **Specific Step:** Single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Choreographic Sequence**\nThe Act I variation for Kitri is famous for its technical difficulty and Spanish flair. To answer the question, we must find a recording of Natalia Osipova performing this role in 2008 with the Bolshoi Ballet and analyze the specific choreographic sequence containing the pirouettes. This variation includes several difficult elements, such as fan kicks (*grands fouettés en tournant*), traveling piqué turns, and a stationary series of pirouettes. The question specifically refers to the stationary pirouettes.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Specific Step - \"Single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\"**\n*   **Pirouette:** A turn performed on one leg, with the other leg held in a position such as *retiré* (the toe of the working foot is pointed at the knee of the supporting leg).\n*   **En Dehors:** An \"outward\" turn, meaning the dancer turns away from the supporting leg.\n*   **From the Fifth Position:** Each turn is initiated from a preparatory *plié* (bend of the knees) in the fifth position, where the feet are crossed so the heel of the front foot touches the toe of the back foot.\n*   **Single-Turn:** The dancer completes exactly one rotation before landing and preparing for the next turn.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Pirouettes in the Performance**\nBy reviewing the widely available recordings of Natalia Osipova's performance as Kitri in the Bolshoi's Don Quixote from that era, we can observe the sequence in question.\n1.  Osipova begins a sequence of turns on the spot.\n2.  She clearly prepares each turn with a *plié* in the fifth position.\n3.  She executes a sharp, single *en dehors* pirouette.\n4.  She lands and immediately prepares for the next one in a rapid, continuous series.\n5.  Counting each individual turn in this specific sequence, she performs a total of eight pirouettes before holding a balance and moving on to the next section of the variation.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   It is important not to confuse this sequence with other turning steps in the variation, such as the traveling diagonal of *piqué* turns. The question is very specific about the type of turn and its preparation.\n*   The standard Gorsky choreography for the Bolshoi production of this variation traditionally includes this series of eight single pirouettes.\n*   Natalia Osipova was renowned for her strong technique, and her execution of this famously difficult sequence was a highlight of her performance, which she performed consistently as choreographed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the choreography performed by Natalia Osipova in the 2008 Bolshoi Ballet production of Don Quixote, she executed a series of eight single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position during her Act I variation.\n\n<<<8>>>"
