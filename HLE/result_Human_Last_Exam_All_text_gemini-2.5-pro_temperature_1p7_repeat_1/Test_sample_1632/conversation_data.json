    "**Step-by-step analysis of the problem:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the terms:**\n    *   **Manhattan lattice:** This is a 2D square grid, where points are represented by integer coordinates (x, y). Moves are restricted to adjacent points, meaning a change of +1 or -1 in either the x or y coordinate, but not both. This corresponds to moving North, South, East, or West.\n    *   **n-step walk:** A sequence of `n` moves on the lattice. It is defined by `n+1` points (v₀, v₁, ..., vₙ), where v₀ is the starting point.\n    *   **Self-avoiding walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same point (vertex) more than once. All points v₀, v₁, ..., vₙ must be unique.\n    *   **a(n):** The total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks. By convention, we can fix the starting point v₀ at the origin (0,0), as the number of possible walk shapes is independent of the starting location on an infinite lattice.\n\n2.  **Calculation for small values of n:**\n    *   **n = 1:** From the origin (0,0), we can move to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1). All 4 are valid 1-step SAWs.\n        *   a(1) = 4\n\n    *   **n = 2:** For each of the 4 initial steps, the second step cannot go back to the origin. For example, if the first step is to (1,0), the second step cannot be to (0,0). The available moves from (1,0) are to (2,0), (1,1), and (1,-1). There are 3 valid choices. Since there were 4 choices for the first step, the total is:\n        *   a(2) = 4 × 3 = 12\n\n    *   **n = 3:** Let's consider the 12 walks of length 2.\n        *   There are two types of 2-step walks:\n            1.  \"Straight\" walks like (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0). There are 4 such walks. From the endpoint (2,0), one direction is blocked by the previous step (back to (1,0)). The other 3 directions lead to new, unvisited points. So, there are 3 valid continuations. This gives 4 × 3 = 12 walks.\n            2.  \"Bent\" walks like (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1). There are 4 choices for the first step and 2 choices for the second (turn left or right), giving 4 × 2 = 8 such walks. From the endpoint (1,1), the direction back to (1,0) is blocked. The other 3 directions lead to points (2,1), (1,2), and (0,1). None of these are on the existing path (0,0), (1,0), (1,1). So, there are 3 valid continuations. This gives 8 × 3 = 24 walks.\n        *   Total walks for n=3: a(3) = 12 + 24 = 36.\n\n    *   **n = 4:** This becomes more complex because some continuations can lead to endpoints that are neighbors of earlier points in the path, reducing the number of subsequent moves.\n        *   We can classify the 36 walks of length 3 by how many valid next steps they have.\n            *   Walks that close in on themselves, like (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (0,1), have their endpoint (0,1) adjacent to the start point (0,0) in addition to being adjacent to the previous point (1,1). From (0,1), we can't move to (1,1) or (0,0), leaving only 2 valid next steps. There are 8 such walks.\n            *   The other 36 - 8 = 28 walks of length 3 all have 3 valid next steps.\n        *   So, the total number of 4-step walks is a(4) = (28 walks × 3 continuations) + (8 walks × 2 continuations) = 84 + 16 = 100.\n\n3.  **The Challenge for n = 10:**\n    *   The method of direct enumeration and classification becomes extremely tedious and error-prone as `n` increases. The number of walk configurations grows exponentially.\n    *   There is no known simple closed-form formula for `a(n)`. This is a famous unsolved problem in combinatorics and statistical physics.\n    *   Values of `a(n)` for `n` greater than about 5 are typically found by computer-based exact enumeration algorithms. The results are well-established and tabulated in resources like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\n4.  **Acquiring the Final Answer:**\n    *   The problem is a request for a known mathematical constant. The sequence `a(n)` is cataloged in OEIS as sequence A001411.\n    *   Looking up this sequence, we find the following values:\n        *   a(1) = 4\n        *   a(2) = 12\n        *   a(3) = 36\n        *   a(4) = 100\n        *   a(5) = 284\n        *   a(6) = 780\n        *   a(7) = 2,172\n        *   a(8) = 5,916\n        *   a(9) = 16,268\n        *   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\n**Careful Points Summary:**\n\n*   The lattice type (Manhattan/square) is crucial.\n*   The definition of \"self-avoiding\" is key—no repeated vertices.\n*   The counting must be exact, considering all possible paths.\n*   Realize that for `n=10`, manual derivation from first principles is not feasible. The appropriate step is to recognize this as a known problem and find the established value.\n*   The calculation for small `n` (1, 2, 3, 4) serves to confirm the understanding of the problem and matches the known sequence, giving confidence in the source for `a(10)`.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nThe final step is to retrieve the 10th term from the known and verified sequence for the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice.\n\nThe value for a(10) is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
