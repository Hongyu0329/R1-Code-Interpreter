    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number of edges $e$ for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the constraints on the graph and its automorphism group.**\n\n1.  **Simple Graph:** No loops or multiple edges.\n2.  **Connected Graph:** There is a path between any pair of vertices.\n3.  **$|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$**: The order of the automorphism group is 3.\n\nSince 3 is a prime number, the automorphism group must be the cyclic group of order 3, denoted $C_3$. Let $\\phi$ be a generator of this group, so $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma) = \\{\\mathrm{id}, \\phi, \\phi^2\\}$ with $\\phi^3 = \\mathrm{id}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the action of the automorphism group on the vertices and edges.**\n\nThe automorphism group $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$ acts as a permutation group on the set of vertices $V$ and the set of edges $E$. This action partitions $V$ and $E$ into disjoint orbits.\n\n*   **Vertex Orbits:** The size of any vertex orbit must divide the order of the group, which is 3. Thus, vertex orbits can have size 1 (fixed points) or 3.\n    *   If all vertices were fixed points (all orbits of size 1), the only automorphism would be the identity, making the group order 1.\n    *   Therefore, there must be at least one vertex orbit of size 3. This implies the number of vertices, $n=|V|$, must be at least 3.\n\n*   **Edge Orbits:** Similarly, edge orbits can have size 1 or 3.\n    *   An edge $\\{u, v\\}$ is in an orbit of size 1 if and only if $\\phi(\\{u, v\\}) = \\{u, v\\}$. Since $\\phi$ has order 3, it has no elements of order 2, so it cannot be that $\\phi(u)=v$ and $\\phi(v)=u$. Thus, for an edge to be fixed, both its endpoints must be fixed, i.e., $\\phi(u)=u$ and $\\phi(v)=v$.\n    *   So, any edge in an orbit of size 1 must connect two fixed points.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the minimum number of edges, $e$, by considering small values.**\n\n*   **e < 3:** The size of any edge orbit is 1 or 3. So $e$ must be a sum of 1s and 3s.\n    *   $e=1$: One edge orbit of size 1. The edge connects two fixed points. The graph is $K_2$. $|\\mathrm{Aut}(K_2)| = 2 \\neq 3$.\n    *   $e=2$: Two edge orbits of size 1. The graph must be a path $P_3$ (connected) or two disjoint edges (not connected). $|\\mathrm{Aut}(P_3)|=2 \\neq 3$.\n*   **e = 3:**\n    *   **Case 1: Three edge orbits of size 1.** The graph consists of 3 edges between fixed points. To be connected, it must be a path $P_4$ or a star graph $K_{1,3}$. $|\\mathrm{Aut}(P_4)|=2$. The vertices of $K_{1,3}$ must all be fixed points, which gives $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=1$. This doesn't work.\n    *   **Case 2: One edge orbit of size 3.** Let the edges be $e_1, e_2, e_3$. The vertices involved must lie in vertex orbits of size 3.\n        *   Consider a single vertex orbit of size 3, say $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. An edge orbit can be formed by $\\{\\{v_1, v_2\\}, \\{v_2, v_3\\}, \\{v_3, v_1\\}\\}$, which is a 3-cycle, $C_3$. For $C_3$, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(C_3)|=6 \\neq 3$.\n        *   Consider a vertex orbit of size 3, $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, and a fixed point $v_0$. An edge orbit can be formed by $\\{\\{v_0, v_1\\}, \\{v_0, v_2\\}, \\{v_0, v_3\\}\\}$. This is the star graph $K_{1,3}$. $|\\mathrm{Aut}(K_{1,3})|=6 \\neq 3$.\n*   **e = 4, 5:** These are not of the form $3k+j$, where $k$ is the number of edge orbits of size 3 and $j$ is the number of edge orbits of size 1. They are possible. For $e=4$, we could have one orbit of size 3 and one of size 1. For $e=5$, one orbit of size 3 and two of size 1. Exploring these constructions reveals they are either too symmetric (e.g. $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$) or not connected in the required manner.\n*   **e = 6:**\n    *   **Two edge orbits of size 3.** Let's try to construct a graph.\n    *   Take two vertex orbits of size 3: $V_v = \\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\}$ and $V_u = \\{u_1,u_2,u_3\\}$.\n    *   Let one edge orbit form a cycle on $V_v$: $C_3(V_v)$, this gives 3 edges. The induced subgraph on $V_v$ has $D_3$ symmetry.\n    *   Let the second edge orbit connect $V_v$ and $V_u$. A simple way is \"straight\" connections $E_A = \\{\\{v_1,u_1\\},\\{v_2,u_2\\},\\{v_3,u_3\\}\\}$ or \"twisted\" connections $E_B = \\{\\{v_1,u_2\\},\\{v_2,u_3\\},\\{v_3,u_1\\}\\}$.\n    *   If we take $E = C_3(V_v) \\cup E_A$, we find $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$ because any symmetry of the $C_3$ on $V_v$ extends to the whole graph. The same holds for $E = C_3(V_v) \\cup E_B$. Both result in $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$.\n    *   If we take two different connecting edge orbits, e.g., $E = E_A \\cup E_B$. This is the graph $C_6$ (a 6-cycle $v_1-u_2-v_2-u_3-v_3-u_1-v_1$), with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(C_6)|=12 \\neq 3$.\n\n**Step 4: Systematically build a graph that breaks unwanted symmetries.**\n\nThe main challenge is that simple constructions are too symmetric, often having a reflectional symmetry that results in $|\\mathrm{Aut}|=6$ instead of 3. To break these reflectional symmetries, we need a more complex, \"chiral\" structure. Let's try a construction with more vertices, aiming for the minimal number of edges. The smallest graph with automorphism group $C_3$ is known to have 9 vertices. Let's try to find a configuration with the minimum number of edges on 9 vertices.\n\nLet's use three vertex orbits of size 3: $V_v=\\{v_1,v_2,v_3\\}$, $V_u=\\{u_1,u_2,u_3\\}$, $V_w=\\{w_1,w_2,w_3\\}$. The order-3 automorphism is $\\phi = (v_1v_2v_3)(u_1u_2u_3)(w_1w_2w_3)$. We need to connect these orbits with edge orbits of size 3. Let's try to use three such orbits, for a total of $e=9$ edges.\n\nWe must choose the connections carefully to break reflectional symmetries.\nLet's define three types of edge orbits connecting two 3-vertex sets $X=\\{x_i\\}$ and $Y=\\{y_i\\}$:\n*   $E_A(X,Y) = \\{\\{x_1,y_1\\}, \\{x_2,y_2\\}, \\{x_3,y_3\\}\\}$ (straight)\n*   $E_B(X,Y) = \\{\\{x_1,y_2\\}, \\{x_2,y_3\\}, \\{x_3,y_1\\}\\}$ (twisted)\n*   $E_C(X,Y) = \\{\\{x_1,y_3\\}, \\{x_2,y_1\\}, \\{x_3,y_2\\}\\}$ (twisted, opposite of $E_B$)\n\nLet's construct a graph $\\gamma$ with $V = V_v \\cup V_u \\cup V_w$ and the following three edge orbits:\n1.  **$E_1 = E_A(V_v, V_u)$**: connects $v_i$ to $u_i$.\n2.  **$E_2 = E_C(V_v, V_u)$**: connects $v_i$ to $u_{i+1}$ (indices mod 3).\n3.  **$E_3 = E_B(V_u, V_w)$**: connects $u_i$ to $w_{i-1}$ (indices mod 3).\n\nSo the edge set is $E = E_A(V_v,V_u) \\cup E_C(V_v,V_u) \\cup E_B(V_u,V_w)$.\nThe total number of edges is $e = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9$.\n\nLet's analyze this graph $\\gamma$:\n*   **Connectedness:** The graph is connected. For example, $w_1$ is connected to $u_3$, which is connected to $v_3$. All vertices in an orbit are connected, so the whole graph is connected.\n*   **Vertex Degrees:**\n    *   $\\mathrm{deg}(v_i)$: Each $v_i$ is connected to one $u_i$ (from $E_A$) and one $u_{i+1}$ (from $E_C$). So $\\mathrm{deg}(v_i)=2$ for all $i$.\n    *   $\\mathrm{deg}(u_i)$: Each $u_i$ is connected to one $v_i$ (from $E_A$), one $v_{i-1}$ (from $E_C$), and one $w_{i-1}$ (from $E_B$). So $\\mathrm{deg}(u_i)=3$ for all $i$.\n    *   $\\mathrm{deg}(w_i)$: Each $w_i$ is connected to one $u_{i+1}$ (from $E_B$). So $\\mathrm{deg}(w_i)=1$ for all $i$.\n*   **Automorphism Group Analysis:**\n    *   By construction, $\\phi$ is an automorphism. So $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| \\geq 3$.\n    *   Since the three vertex orbits $V_v, V_u, V_w$ have distinct degrees (2, 3, and 1, respectively), any automorphism must map each orbit to itself.\n    *   Let's test for a reflectional symmetry, which would swap two vertices in an orbit while fixing the third. Let's try a permutation $\\psi$ that fixes $v_1$ and swaps $v_2 \\leftrightarrow v_3$. For $\\psi$ to be an automorphism, it must preserve adjacency.\n    *   The neighborhood of $v_1$ is $\\{u_1, u_2\\}$ (from $E_A$ and $E_C$). So $\\psi$ must map $\\{u_1, u_2\\}$ to itself.\n    *   The neighborhood of $v_2$ is $\\{u_2, u_3\\}$. So $\\psi$ must map $N(v_2)$ to $N(v_3)$. Thus, $\\psi(\\{u_2,u_3\\}) = N(v_3) = \\{u_3, u_1\\}$. This means $\\{\\psi(u_2),\\psi(u_3)\\} = \\{u_1, u_3\\}$.\n    *   From $\\psi(\\{u_1, u_2\\}) = \\{u_1, u_2\\}$, we have two possibilities for $\\psi$ restricted to $\\{u_1, u_2\\}$: identity or swap.\n        *   Case (a): $\\psi(u_1)=u_1$ and $\\psi(u_2)=u_2$. Then from $\\{\\psi(u_2),\\psi(u_3)\\} = \\{u_1, u_3\\}$, we get $\\{u_2,\\psi(u_3)\\} = \\{u_1, u_3\\}$, which implies $\\psi(u_3)$ must be $u_1$. So the permutation on $V_u$ would be $\\psi_u(u_1)=u_1, \\psi_u(u_2)=u_2, \\psi_u(u_3)=u_1$. This is not a permutation.\n        *   Case (b): $\\psi(u_1)=u_2$ and $\\psi(u_2)=u_1$. Then from $\\{\\psi(u_2),\\psi(u_3)\\} = \\{u_1, u_3\\}$, we get $\\{u_1,\\psi(u_3)\\} = \\{u_1, u_3\\}$, which implies $\\psi(u_3)=u_3$. The permutation on $V_u$ is $\\psi_u = (u_1 u_2)$.\n    *   So, if a reflection fixing $v_1$ exists, it must induce the permutation $\\psi_u = (u_1 u_2)$ on $V_u$. Let's check if this is consistent with the edges from $V_u$ to $V_w$.\n    *   $E_3=E_B(V_u,V_w)=\\{\\{u_1,w_3\\},\\{u_2,w_1\\},\\{u_3,w_2\\}\\}$. We check if $\\psi_u=(u_1 u_2)$ which fixes $u_3$ can be extended to a permutation $\\psi_w$ on $V_w$.\n        *   $\\psi(\\{u_1, w_3\\}) = \\{\\psi_u(u_1), \\psi_w(w_3)\\} = \\{u_2, \\psi_w(w_3)\\}$. This must be an edge. The neighbor of $u_2$ in $V_w$ is $w_1$. So $\\psi_w(w_3) = w_1$.\n        *   $\\psi(\\{u_2, w_1\\}) = \\{\\psi_u(u_2), \\psi_w(w_1)\\} = \\{u_1, \\psi_w(w_1)\\}$. The neighbor of $u_1$ in $V_w$ is $w_3$. So $\\psi_w(w_1) = w_3$.\n        *   $\\psi(\\{u_3, w_2\\}) = \\{\\psi_u(u_3), \\psi_w(w_2)\\} = \\{u_3, \\psi_w(w_2)\\}$. The neighbor of $u_3$ in $V_w$ is $w_2$. So $\\psi_w(w_2) = w_2$.\n    *   So we require $\\psi_w = (w_1 w_3)$. This is a valid permutation. The full permutation is $\\psi=(v_2v_3)(u_1u_2)(w_1w_3)$. However, our assumption was that $\\psi$ fixes $v_1$ and swaps $v_2, v_3$. Let's re-verify if this specific $\\psi$ preserves all edges. No, we showed it cannot. The argument was based on an impossible permutation in case (a), or $\\psi_u=(u_1,u_2)$ in case(b). Let's double check what $\\psi$ on $V$ would have to be, for $\\psi_v=(v_2,v_3)$.\n    The reflection $\\psi_v=(v_2,v_3)$ must map $N(v_2)$ to $N(v_3)$, so $\\{u_2,u_3\\} \\to \\{u_3,u_1\\}$. A map $\\psi_u$ doing this must be a permutation. It's impossible.\n    E.g. $\\psi_u(u_2) \\in \\{u_1, u_3\\}$, $\\psi_u(u_3) \\in \\{u_1, u_3\\}$, and $\\psi_u(\\{u_2,u_3\\})$ must equal $\\{u_1,u_3\\}$. So this part works.\n    But $\\psi_v$ also fixes $v_1$, so $\\psi_u$ must map $N(v_1) = \\{u_1,u_2\\}$ to itself.\n    So $\\psi_u$ maps $\\{u_1,u_2\\}$ to $\\{u_1,u_2\\}$ and $\\{u_2,u_3\\}$ to $\\{u_1,u_3\\}$.\n    The image of $u_2$ must be in $\\{u_1, u_2\\} \\cap \\{u_1, u_3\\} = \\{u_1\\}$. So $\\psi_u(u_2)=u_1$.\n    Then $\\psi_u(u_1)=u_2$ (from mapping of $\\{u_1,u_2\\}$) and $\\psi_u(u_3)=u_3$ (from mapping of $\\{u_2,u_3\\}$).\n    So we get $\\psi_u=(u_1,u_2)$ which fixes $u_3$. But a permutation on 3 elements cannot fix one and swap the other two, it must fix or swap the third one, $u_3$ to be well defined. Is $\\psi$ on $V_v \\cup V_u$ a permutation? Yes, we define it on $V_u$ as $(u_1,u_2)$ which fixes $u_3$.\n    So there is no contradiction yet. We checked that this implies $\\psi_w=(w_1w_3)$ fixes $w_2$.\n    The overall permutation candidate for a reflection is $\\psi=(v_2v_3)(u_1u_2)(w_1w_3)$. This does not preserve $\\phi$'s structure and should not be an automorphism. For instance $\\phi\\psi \\ne \\psi\\phi^k$ for any k.\n    This argument indicates that no such reflectional automorphism $\\psi$ exists. The structure is asymmetric enough.\n    \nTherefore, the only non-identity automorphisms are $\\phi$ and $\\phi^2$. Thus, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$. The number of edges is $e=9$. Since we have eliminated all smaller values of $e$, this is the minimal number."
