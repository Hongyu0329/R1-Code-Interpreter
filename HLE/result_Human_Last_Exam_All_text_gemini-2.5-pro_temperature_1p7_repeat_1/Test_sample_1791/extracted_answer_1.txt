The effective electron-electron interaction is a retarded interaction mediated by phonons. For a given momentum transfer $\mathbf{q}$, the interaction couples the electron density operators $\rho_{\mathbf{q}}$ and $\rho_{-\mathbf{q}}$. The frequency-dependent effective potential, $V_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{q}, i\omega_n)$, in Matsubara frequency space ($i\omega_n$ being the bosonic Matsubara frequency), is given by:
$V_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{q}, i\omega_n) = \sum_{j} \frac{g^2 q_j^2}{m(w_q^2 + \omega_n^2)}$
The full effective interaction term in the Hamiltonian is obtained by summing over all momentum transfers $\mathbf{q}$:
$H_{\text{eff}} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\mathbf{q}} V_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{q}) \rho_{\mathbf{q}} \rho_{-\mathbf{q}}$
where the product of density operators is time-ordered, and the potential $V_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf{q})$ is the time-domain representation of the frequency-dependent potential found above.
