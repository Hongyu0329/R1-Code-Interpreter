    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Music Theory Terminology**\n\n*   **Tonic Chord (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's built on the first note of the scale. For example, in the key of C major, the tonic chord is C major. In the key of A major, the tonic is A major.\n*   **Fifth Chord (V or v):** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This is the crucial part of the question. In a standard major key, the chord built on the fifth note is a *major* chord, called the dominant (V). For example, in the key of F major, the fifth note is C, and the standard dominant chord is C major. The question specifies a *minor* fifth chord (v). This means if the key were F major, the chord would be C *minor*. This is a less common and very distinctive harmonic choice.\n*   **Chord Jump:** This simply means a direct progression from one chord to the next.\n\nSo, we are looking for a Beatles song that opens with the chord progression: **I -> v**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs**\n\nLet's examine the opening chords of several famous Beatles songs to see if they fit the I -> v pattern.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\"**: Starts with a famously ambiguous and complex chord (often analyzed as a G11sus4). The verse then begins on a G major chord (the tonic). This does not fit the pattern.\n*   **\"I Feel Fine\"**: Starts with feedback, then a guitar riff based on the G major chord (the tonic). The progression is a standard blues/rock progression (I-IV-V), not I -> v.\n*   **\"Ticket to Ride\"**: The iconic opening riff is based around an A major chord (the tonic), followed by a B minor (ii) and an E major (V). This is not the required progression.\n*   **\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\"**: Starts with a D major chord (the tonic). The progression moves from D major to C major (a bVII chord), not a minor fifth.\n*   **\"Michelle\"**: Let's analyze this one carefully.\n    *   The song's famous, descending guitar intro is widely considered to be in the key of **F major**.\n    *   The very first chord played is **F major**. This is the tonic (I) chord.\n    *   Immediately following the F major, the harmony shifts to a **C minor** chord.\n    *   In the key of F major, the fifth note of the scale is C. Therefore, a C minor chord is the **minor fifth (v)**.\n    *   The progression is **F major -> C minor**, which is precisely **I -> v**.\n\n**Step 3: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe opening of \"Michelle\" is a perfect example of the chord progression described. The move from the tonic (F major) to the non-diatonic minor fifth (C minor) gives the introduction its unique, melancholic, and French-chanson feel, before the song shifts to the key of F minor for the verse. No other prominent Beatles song starts with this specific harmonic movement.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
