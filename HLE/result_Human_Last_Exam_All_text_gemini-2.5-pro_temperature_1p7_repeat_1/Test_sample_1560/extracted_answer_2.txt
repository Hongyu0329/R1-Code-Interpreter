The final state of the system is not a single deterministic state. Instead, upon measurement of the first ququint, the entire system collapses into one of five possible states with different probabilities:
1. With probability 0.2, the system collapses to $|0\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B)$.
2. With probability 0.2, the system collapses to $|1\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_B + |2\rangle_B)$.
3. With probability 0.3, the system collapses to $|2\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|0\rangle_B + |3\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
4. With probability 0.2, the system collapses to $|3\rangle_A \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_B + |4\rangle_B)$.
5. With probability 0.1, the system collapses to $|4\rangle_A \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
