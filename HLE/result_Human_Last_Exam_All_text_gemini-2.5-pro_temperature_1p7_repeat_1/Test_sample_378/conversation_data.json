    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe user is asking for a specific year when an individual named \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Name of the Subject**\nThe first and most critical step is to verify the name of the person in question. The query refers to the former President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan.\n*   His full and official name is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**.\n*   The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his birth name, middle names, or any officially adopted name.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Potential Source of Confusion**\nThe name \"Azikiwe\" is very prominent in Nigerian history. It belongs to Dr. **Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria and a leading figure in its independence movement. It is possible that the user has conflated these two different Nigerian presidents.\n\n**Step 4: Search for Any Connection or Public Identification**\nA thorough search is conducted to see if Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever, for any reason (e.g., as a nickname, in a speech, or as a tribute), publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n*   There are no credible reports, official records, news articles, or public speeches where Goodluck Ebele Jonathan refers to himself as \"Azikiwe\" or claims that name as his own.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude Based on the Findings**\nThe premise of the question is incorrect. Since \"Azikiwe\" is not part of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name and there is no record of him ever publicly identifying with that name, it is not possible to provide a year for an event that did not happen.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Accuracy of Names:** The most important detail is the accuracy of the subject's name. The question contains a factual error by including \"Azikiwe\" in Goodluck Jonathan's name.\n2.  **Distinguishing Historical Figures:** It is crucial to distinguish between Goodluck Ebele Jonathan (President of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015) and Nnamdi Azikiwe (First President of Nigeria from 1963 to 1966). The prominence of both figures in Nigerian politics could lead to confusion.\n3.  **Absence of Evidence:** The conclusion is based on the absence of any evidence supporting the claim. In historical or factual queries, the lack of a credible source is a strong indicator that the event in question did not occur.\n4.  **Addressing the False Premise:** The most helpful response is not to guess or invent an answer, but to directly address the flawed premise of the question and provide the correct information.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the event described in the question never took place. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name does not include \"Azikiwe,\" and he has never publicly identified himself as such. Therefore, there is no year to report.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, and \"Azikiwe\" is not part of it. The question is based on a false premise.>>>"
