    "This is an analysis of the statement: \"The predictive ability of a polygenic score, measured by variance explained, is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability for the phenotype.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):**\n    *   SNP heritability is a theoretical concept. It represents the proportion of total phenotypic variance in a population that can be explained by the cumulative effect of all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered in the analysis (usually all common SNPs on a standard genotyping array).\n    *   It is considered the *theoretical upper limit* or ceiling for the predictive power of a linear model that uses these SNPs as predictors. It assumes you know the *true* effect size of every single SNP and can combine them perfectly.\n    *   It's estimated using methods like LD Score Regression or GCTA-GREML, which look at the genetic similarity between unrelated individuals and correlate it with their phenotypic similarity, without needing to know individual SNP effects precisely.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability:**\n    *   A polygenic score is a practical tool. It is a single value calculated for an individual that sums up the estimated effects of many genetic variants on their phenotype.\n    *   The \"effects\" (weights) for each SNP are not the true, unknown effect sizes. Instead, they are *estimates* derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n    *   The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by how well it predicts the phenotype in an independent sample (i.e., not the one used for the GWAS). This is typically quantified by the R-squared (R²) value from a regression of the phenotype on the PGS. This R² is the \"variance explained\" by the PGS.\n\n3.  **Compare SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability:**\n    *   The core difference lies between a *theoretical maximum* and a *practical estimate*.\n    *   **SNP heritability (h²_SNP)** is the theoretical maximum variance that could be explained if we had a perfect predictor using all the SNPs.\n    *   **The PGS predictive ability (R²_PGS)** is the variance explained by an *actual* predictor, which is inherently imperfect.\n\n4.  **Identify Reasons for the Imperfection of a PGS:**\n    *   **Estimation Error:** GWASs are conducted on finite samples. Therefore, the estimated effect size for each SNP is not the true value but a statistical estimate with a standard error. The larger the GWAS sample size, the smaller the error, but it never reaches zero. This noise in the weights directly reduces the predictive power of the resulting PGS.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** SNPs are often correlated. It is difficult for a GWAS to distinguish the true causal SNP from other non-causal SNPs that are highly correlated with it. This can lead to suboptimal weights in the PGS.\n    *   **Incomplete Model:** The set of SNPs used might not include all causal variants. Furthermore, the standard additive model used for PGS construction might not perfectly capture the true (and potentially more complex) genetic architecture of the trait.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **\"Necessarily lower\":** This is a strong claim. The relationship R²_PGS ≤ h²_SNP is definitional. h²_SNP is the ceiling. For R²_PGS to equal h²_SNP, the PGS would need to be constructed with the true, error-free effect sizes for every SNP, which is practically impossible as it would require an infinitely large GWAS discovery sample. Therefore, in any real-world application, the PGS predictive ability will be strictly lower than the SNP heritability.\n*   **Context:** This comparison assumes the PGS is tested in a population similar to the one where the GWAS was performed. If tested in a different ancestry group, its predictive ability often drops even further.\n*   **Measurement Error:** While the true R²_PGS is lower than the true h²_SNP, our *estimates* of these values both have confidence intervals. It's theoretically possible for a sample estimate of R²_PGS to be higher than a sample estimate of h²_SNP due to statistical noise or overfitting, but this would not reflect the true underlying relationship. The question refers to the quantities themselves, not our noisy measurements of them.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThe SNP heritability (h²_SNP) represents the total genetic signal present in the SNPs that a PGS aims to capture. A PGS is a tool built with imperfect information (estimated effect sizes from a finite GWAS sample). Due to this inherent estimation error and other modeling limitations, the PGS can never capture the total available signal perfectly. Consequently, the proportion of variance it explains (R²_PGS) must be lower than the total proportion that is theoretically explainable (h²_SNP). The gap between the two reflects the limitations of our current GWAS and PGS methodologies.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\n<<<True>>>"
