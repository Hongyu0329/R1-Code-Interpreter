    "This problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs that together cover all edges of a complete graph $K_{35}$.\n\nLet's break down the problem and analyze it step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Terminology\n\n*   **Complete Graph $K_n$**: A graph with $n$ vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. For this problem, $n=35$.\n*   **Bipartite Graph**: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, let's call them A and B, such that every edge connects a vertex in A to one in B. There are no edges between two vertices in A or between two vertices in B.\n*   **Family of Bipartite Graphs Covering $K_n$**: This means we have a set of bipartite graphs, say $\\{H_1, H_2, \\ldots, H_k\\}$, which are all subgraphs of $K_n$. The condition is that the union of their edge sets contains all the edges of $K_n$. That is, for any edge in $K_n$, it must also be an edge in at least one of the graphs $H_i$.\n*   **Minimum number of vertices in a family**: This is generally interpreted in combinatorial literature as the sum of the number of vertices in each graph of the family. If $V(H_i)$ is the set of vertices of graph $H_i$, we want to minimize the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(H_i)|$.\n\n### Step 2: Formalizing the Problem\n\nLet $V$ be the set of vertices of $K_n$, with $|V|=n=35$.\nWe are looking for a family of bipartite subgraphs $H_1, \\ldots, H_k$ of $K_n$. Let the bipartition of the vertices of $H_i$ be $(A_i, B_i)$, where $A_i, B_i \\subseteq V$ and $A_i \\cap B_i = \\emptyset$. The vertex set of $H_i$ is $V(H_i) = A_i \\cup B_i$.\n\nThe condition is that for every pair of distinct vertices $\\{u, v\\} \\subseteq V$, the edge $(u, v)$ is in at least one $H_i$.\nOur objective is to find the minimum possible value of $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(H_i)|$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound\n\nThis is a classic problem in extremal graph theory. There's a well-known lower bound for this quantity. We can derive it using an information-theoretic argument.\n\n1.  For each bipartite graph $H_i$ with its vertex partition $(A_i, B_i)$, we can classify each vertex $v \\in V(K_n)$ into one of three categories:\n    *   $v \\in A_i$\n    *   $v \\in B_i$\n    *   $v \\notin V(H_i)$ (i.e., not in $A_i$ or $B_i$)\n2.  Let's associate a label vector with each vertex $v \\in V$. The vector for $v$, say $\\vec{L}(v)$, will have $k$ components. The $i$-th component, $\\vec{L}_i(v)$, describes which category $v$ falls into for graph $H_i$.\n3.  Consider any two distinct vertices, $u$ and $v$. The edge $(u,v)$ must be covered by some graph, say $H_j$. For the edge $(u,v)$ to be in $H_j$, one vertex must be in $A_j$ and the other in $B_j$. This means their categories for $H_j$ must be different.\n4.  This implies that if two vertices $u$ and $v$ have the exact same label vector, i.e., $\\vec{L}(u) = \\vec{L}(v)$, then for every $j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$, $u$ and $v$ are in the same category for the graph $H_j$. They are either both in $A_j$, both in $B_j$, or both not in $V(H_j)$. In none of these cases can the edge $(u,v)$ belong to $H_j$.\n5.  Therefore, if the family of graphs $\\{H_i\\}$ covers all edges of $K_n$, every vertex must have a unique label vector. If we have $n$ vertices, we must be able to generate $n$ distinct label vectors.\n\nA more formal mathematical proof (due to Witsenhausen) establishes the lower bound for the sum of the sizes of the vertex sets:\nThe minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} |V(H_i)|$ is at least $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n\n### Step 4: Finding an Upper Bound (Constructive Method)\n\nWe can show that this lower bound is achievable by constructing a specific family of bipartite graphs.\n\n1.  Let $d = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n2.  Since $2^d \\ge n$, we can assign to each of the $n$ vertices of $K_n$ a unique binary vector of length $d$. Let's denote the vector assigned to vertex $v$ as $\\vec{x}(v) = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_d)$, where each $x_j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n3.  Now, we construct a family of $d$ bipartite graphs, $\\{H_1, H_2, \\ldots, H_d\\}$. For each coordinate $j \\in \\{1, \\ldots, d\\}$, we define a graph $H_j$:\n    *   Let the first partition be $A_j = \\{v \\in V \\mid \\text{the } j\\text{-th bit of } \\vec{x}(v) \\text{ is } 0\\}$.\n    *   Let the second partition be $B_j = \\{v \\in V \\mid \\text{the } j\\text{-th bit of } \\vec{x}(v) \\text{ is } 1\\}$.\n    *   Let $H_j$ be the complete bipartite graph on the vertex partitions $(A_j, B_j)$. So, an edge exists between every vertex in $A_j$ and every vertex in $B_j$.\n\n4.  **Verification of Coverage**: Let's check if this family of graphs covers $K_n$. Take any two distinct vertices, $u$ and $v$. By our setup, their assigned binary vectors $\\vec{x}(u)$ and $\\vec{x}(v)$ must be different. This means they must differ in at least one bit position, say the $j$-th position. This implies that one vertex has a 0 and the other has a 1 in the $j$-th bit. By our construction of $H_j$, one of these vertices is in $A_j$ and the other is in $B_j$. Therefore, the edge $(u,v)$ is present in the graph $H_j$. Since this is true for any pair of vertices, all edges of $K_n$ are covered.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Sum of Vertices**:\n    *   The number of graphs in our family is $k=d = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n    *   For each graph $H_j$, its vertex set is $V(H_j) = A_j \\cup B_j$. Since every vertex in $K_n$ was assigned a binary vector, every vertex has either a 0 or a 1 in its $j$-th bit. Thus, every vertex of $K_n$ belongs to either $A_j$ or $B_j$. This means $|V(H_j)| = |V| = n$ for all $j=1, \\ldots, d$.\n    *   The total sum of vertices is $\\sum_{j=1}^{d} |V(H_j)| = \\sum_{j=1}^{d} n = d \\times n = n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nSince the lower bound matches the upper bound provided by our construction, the minimum number of vertices is exactly $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n\nFor this specific problem, we have $n=35$.\n\n1.  First, calculate $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$.\n    *   $2^5 = 32$\n    *   $2^6 = 64$\n    *   Since $32 < 35 \\le 64$, we have $5 < \\log_2 35 \\le 6$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\n\n2.  Now, calculate the final answer:\n    *   Minimum sum of vertices = $n \\times \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil = 35 \\times 6$.\n    *   $35 \\times 6 = 210$.\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs is 210.\n\n<<<210>>>"
