    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Binding Motif:** The question revolves around peptides binding to integrin receptors. The primary and most famous recognition motif for a large family of integrins is the tripeptide sequence **Arg-Gly-Asp**, abbreviated as **RGD**. All the answer choices provided begin with this RGD sequence. This indicates that the crucial difference lies in the amino acids that follow the RGD core.\n\n2.  **Understand the Role of Flanking Residues:** While the RGD sequence is necessary for binding, the amino acids adjacent to this motif (flanking residues) play a critical role in determining both the specificity (which type of integrin it binds to) and the affinity (how strongly it binds). Different integrins have evolved to recognize the RGD sequence within the context of specific surrounding residues found in their natural ligands, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.\n\n3.  **Analyze Natural Integrin Ligands:** Let's consider the RGD sequences in some major ECM proteins:\n    *   **Fibronectin:** This protein is a primary ligand for the α5β1 integrin. The main cell-adhesion site in fibronectin contains the sequence **GRGDSPK**. The **RGDSP** portion is widely recognized and used experimentally.\n    *   **Vitronectin:** This protein is a ligand for αv-class integrins (like αvβ3 and αvβ5). Its RGD sequence is **RGDV**.\n    *   **Fibrinogen:** This protein binds to the platelet integrin αIIbβ3. It contains two RGD sequences: **RGDF** and **RGDW**.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Peptide Option:** Now, let's examine each choice in light of the information above. We are looking for a sequence that is either identical or very similar to a known integrin-binding sequence from a natural ligand, as these are the ones most extensively studied and confirmed to bind in *in vitro* assays.\n\n    *   **A. RGDMAA:** The residue following RGD is Methionine (M). This sequence does not correspond to the well-known motifs from fibronectin or vitronectin. While some engineered peptides might use M, it's not a classic natural sequence.\n    *   **B. RGDSPSS:** The sequence immediately following RGD is **SP**. This directly corresponds to the **RGDSP** motif found in fibronectin. Peptides containing the RGDSP sequence are standard reagents used in cell biology labs to study α5β1 integrin function, either by promoting cell adhesion when coated on a surface or by inhibiting cell adhesion to fibronectin when in solution. The presence of the well-documented RGDSP sequence makes this peptide highly likely to bind integrins.\n    *   **C. RGDLTTP:** The residue following RGD is Leucine (L). While some integrins might show weak binding to RGDL, it is not a primary recognition motif from a major ligand like fibronectin.\n    *   **D. RGDQVSK:** The residue following RGD is Glutamine (Q). This is not a commonly cited RGD flanking sequence for major integrins.\n    *   **E. RGDARGG:** The residue following RGD is Alanine (A). Similar to the others, this is not a well-known high-affinity sequence from a natural ECM ligand.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The peptide **RGDSPSS** contains the **RGDSP** motif, which is the canonical binding sequence from fibronectin for the α5β1 integrin. Because of its origin from a key natural ligand and its extensive use and characterization in scientific literature, this peptide has certainly been found to bind integrin receptors in numerous *in vitro* assays. It is the most compelling choice among the options.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Universality of RGD:** Not all integrins bind RGD. For example, collagen-binding integrins (α1β1, α2β1) use different motifs. However, the question implies we are considering the RGD-dependent integrins.\n*   **Specificity vs. Likelihood:** The question asks which peptide is likely to bind *an* integrin receptor, not a specific one. However, the most likely candidate will be one that strongly resembles a well-studied natural sequence.\n*   **Synthetic vs. Natural:** While scientists can create synthetic RGD peptides with various flanking sequences, the question is best answered by identifying the sequence that is most established in the scientific literature, which is almost always one derived from a natural protein. The RGDSP sequence from fibronectin is arguably the most famous example after the RGD motif itself.\n\nFinal analysis confirms that RGDSPSS is the most plausible answer due to the presence of the extensively verified RGDSP motif from fibronectin.\n\n<<<B>>>"
