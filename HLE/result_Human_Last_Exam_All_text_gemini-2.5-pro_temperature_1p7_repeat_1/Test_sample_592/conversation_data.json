    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:** The question asks for the specific US city to which a character moves in a particular movie.\n    *   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (Hard Boiled Egg)\n    *   **Year:** 1997\n    *   **Character:** Tommaso\n    *   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n    *   **Action:** Moves to the United States\n    *   **Information needed:** The name of the US city.\n\n2.  **Understand the characters and their context:** In the movie *Ovosodo*, the protagonist is Piero Mansani. Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, is Piero's best friend. Their paths diverge significantly after school. While Piero remains in his hometown of Livorno, Tommaso, who comes from a wealthier background, seeks opportunities elsewhere.\n\n3.  **Trace Tommaso's character arc:** Tommaso's storyline is one of upward and international mobility. After finishing school in Italy, his ambition leads him to pursue higher education and a career abroad. This is a key plot point that contrasts his life with Piero's.\n\n4.  **Locate the specific detail in the film's plot:** By examining plot summaries of *Ovosodo*, we can find the destination of Tommaso's move. The film shows that he moves to the United States to attend university.\n\n5.  **Identify the specific city:** The film explicitly mentions that Tommaso moves to New York City to study at the prestigious Columbia University. He is later seen having established a successful life there, which serves as a stark contrast to Piero's life back in Italy.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguish the Characters:** It is crucial not to confuse Tommaso (the friend who leaves) with the protagonist Piero (who stays in Livorno). The question specifically asks about Tommaso.\n*   **Actor Confirmation:** The mention of actor Marco Cocci helps confirm that the question is indeed about the character Tommaso, as he played that role.\n*   **Source of Information:** The answer relies on established plot summaries and knowledge of the film's narrative. The destination is not a minor detail but a significant part of the character's story arc.\n*   **Exact Location:** The film is specific, mentioning not just the city but also the university (Columbia University), which solidifies the location as New York City.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the film's plot and the character arc of Tommaso, he moves from Italy to the United States. His destination is explicitly identified in the movie. He goes to New York City to attend university and begin his career.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
