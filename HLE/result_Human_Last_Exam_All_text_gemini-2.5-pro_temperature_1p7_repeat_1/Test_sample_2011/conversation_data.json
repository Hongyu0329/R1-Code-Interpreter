    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs within a single graph `G` that has `n = 128` vertices.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Graph (G):** A set of vertices (V) and edges (E). Here, |V| = n = 128.\n    *   **Clique:** A subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge). A clique with `k` vertices is denoted as `K_k`.\n    *   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S` from `G`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` consists of the vertices `S` and *all* the edges from `G` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n    *   **Clique as an Induced Subgraph:** A graph `G` has an induced clique of size `k` if there exists a set of `k` vertices, let's call it `S_k`, such that the induced subgraph `G[S_k]` is a complete graph `K_k`. This is equivalent to saying that the set of vertices `S_k` forms a clique in `G`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of Induced Clique Sizes:**\n    Let's denote the set of all integers `k` for which `G` has an induced clique of size `k` as `C(G)`. We want to maximize `|C(G)|`.\n\n    Let's assume the largest induced clique in `G` has size `k_max`. This means there is a set of vertices `S_max` with `|S_max| = k_max` such that `G[S_max]` is a `K_{k_max}`. In graph theory terms, `k_max` is the **clique number** of `G`, denoted as `ω(G)`.\n\n    Now, consider any integer `j` such that `1 ≤ j ≤ k_max`. Can we find an induced clique of size `j`?\n    Yes. We can choose any subset `S_j` of `S_max` such that `|S_j| = j`.\n    Because every pair of vertices in `S_max` is connected by an edge in `G`, it follows that every pair of vertices in its subset `S_j` is also connected.\n    The induced subgraph `G[S_j]` has vertex set `S_j` and all edges from `G` between these vertices. Since all these edges exist, `G[S_j]` is a complete graph `K_j`.\n    This proves a crucial point: If a graph `G` contains an induced clique of size `k_max`, it must also contain induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to `k_max`.\n\n4.  **Relate the Number of Clique Sizes to the Clique Number:**\n    From the previous step, we know that if `ω(G)` is the size of the largest clique in `G`, then the set of induced clique sizes `C(G)` contains `{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`.\n    Can `C(G)` contain any size larger than `ω(G)`? By definition, `ω(G)` is the size of the *largest* clique, so no clique of a larger size can exist.\n    Therefore, the set of all possible induced clique sizes in any graph `G` is exactly `C(G) = {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`.\n    The number of different clique sizes is `|C(G)| = ω(G)`.\n\n5.  **Reframe the Problem:**\n    The problem of finding the \"maximum possible number of different clique sizes\" is now simplified to finding the \"maximum possible clique number `ω(G)`\" for a graph `G` with 128 vertices.\n\n6.  **Find the Maximum Clique Number:**\n    For any graph `G` with `n` vertices, the size of any clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices. So, `ω(G) ≤ n`.\n    In our case, `n = 128`, so the clique number of any such graph is at most 128. `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n\n7.  **Construct a Graph to Achieve the Maximum:**\n    We need to show that this maximum value of 128 is achievable.\n    Consider the complete graph `K_128`. This is a graph with 128 vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    In `K_128`, the entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique. Therefore, the clique number is `ω(K_128) = 128`.\n    Based on our earlier analysis, the number of different induced clique sizes in `K_128` is `ω(K_128) = 128`. These sizes are {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Induced vs. Subgraph:** The word \"induced\" is critical. However, for cliques, the distinction is less important because if a set of vertices forms a clique, the induced subgraph on them is always a complete graph.\n*   **Overlapping Cliques:** A potential trap is to think about constructing non-overlapping (disjoint) cliques. For example, trying to fit cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ... into 128 vertices by summing their sizes (1 + 2 + 3 + ...). This approach is suboptimal because it doesn't utilize the fact that cliques can and do share vertices. As shown, the most efficient way to get many clique sizes is to have one large clique, which contains all the smaller ones.\n*   **The Set of Sizes is a Contiguous Range:** The most important insight is that the set of induced clique sizes is not an arbitrary collection of integers but is always of the form `{1, 2, ..., k}` for some `k`.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe maximum number of different clique sizes is equal to the maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices. The maximum possible clique number is 128, which is achieved by the complete graph `K_128`."
