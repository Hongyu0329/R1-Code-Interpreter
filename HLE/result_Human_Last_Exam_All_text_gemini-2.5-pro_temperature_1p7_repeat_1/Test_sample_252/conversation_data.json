    "This question deals with a technique known as snapshot hyperspectral imaging, which aims to capture a 3D data cube (2 spatial dimensions, 1 spectral dimension) in a single camera exposure. The question specifically invokes the principles of computed tomography (CT) for the reconstruction process.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal - \"Construct a full spectral volume\"\nA \"spectral volume\" is a 3D data set, often called a hyperspectral datacube, denoted as `f(x, y, λ)`. This means that for every spatial coordinate `(x, y)` in a scene, we want to know the intensity of light for a range of wavelengths `(λ)`. Our final output is this 3D cube of data.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Method - \"Using computed tomography\"\nComputed tomography (CT), in its classic form (like medical CT scans), reconstructs a 3D object from a series of 2D projections taken from many different angles. The key principle is that to reconstruct a volume, you need to \"view\" it from multiple perspectives. The mathematical foundation for this is the Radon Transform, which describes how an object is projected onto a plane. Reconstructing the object requires inverting this transform, which is only possible if you have projections from multiple angles.\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Tool and Constraint - \"From a single image using diffraction gratings\"\n*   **Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits and diffracts light into its constituent wavelengths. When light from a point source `(x,y)` passes through a grating, it is spread out into a line on the detector. The position along this line corresponds to the wavelength `λ`. The orientation of this line depends on the orientation of the grating's grooves.\n*   **Single Image:** This is a critical constraint. All the information required for reconstruction must be captured in a single snapshot on a 2D sensor.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the process with one diffraction grating\nLet's imagine a system with a single diffraction grating. The light from the scene `f(x, y, λ)` is directed through this grating and onto a 2D camera sensor.\n*   The grating disperses light along a single axis. Let's say it's oriented to disperse along the horizontal (x) axis.\n*   For any given point `(x,y)` in the scene, its spectrum is spread out horizontally on the sensor. A point `(x,y)` in the scene with a certain wavelength `λ` will land at a sensor coordinate `(u, v)` where `u = x + D(λ)` and `v = y`. `D(λ)` is the dispersion function, which shifts the x-position based on wavelength.\n*   The problem is that different points from the original scene can end up at the same location on the sensor. For example, a point `(x1, y)` with wavelength `λ1` might land at the same sensor pixel as a point `(x2, y)` with wavelength `λ2`, if `x1 + D(λ1) = x2 + D(λ2)`.\n*   This process effectively \"projects\" or collapses the 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)` onto the 2D sensor plane. This is a single projection of the 3D volume.\n*   In the language of tomography, reconstructing a 3D volume from a single 2D projection is an extremely ill-posed problem. It's like trying to reconstruct a 3D object from a single X-ray image; you can't tell what's in front of or behind something else. Therefore, a single grating provides only one \"view\" or \"projection,\" which is insufficient for a tomographic reconstruction.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the process with two diffraction gratings\nTo satisfy the principle of computed tomography, we need multiple projections (views) of the data cube. How can we get a second, different projection in a single snapshot?\n*   We can use a second diffraction grating, oriented differently from the first one. For example, we could have:\n    1.  **Grating 1:** Disperses light along the horizontal (x) axis. This gives a projection that mixes the spatial `x` information with the spectral `λ` information.\n    2.  **Grating 2:** Disperses light along the vertical (y) axis. This gives a projection that mixes the spatial `y` information with the spectral `λ` information.\n*   By using an optical system that combines the light from these two dispersive paths onto a single sensor, we can capture two different projections simultaneously. One projection shears the data cube in the `x-λ` plane, and the other shears it in the `y-λ` plane.\n*   Having these two distinct views of the data cube provides the necessary information for a tomographic reconstruction. The reconstruction algorithm can then \"triangulate\" the data in the `(x, y, λ)` space to solve for the full spectral volume. This is analogous to how having two eyes allows for depth perception.\n*   This approach is the basis of real-world systems like Dual Disperser Coded Aperture Snapshot Spectral Imaging (DD-CASSI).\n\n### Step 6: Conclude the minimum number\n*   **One grating:** Provides only one projection, which is insufficient for tomographic reconstruction.\n*   **Two gratings:** Provide two distinct projections, which is the minimum required to apply tomographic principles to reconstruct a 3D volume.\n*   **More than two gratings:** While potentially useful for improving the quality of the reconstruction by providing even more views, it is not the *minimum* number required.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
