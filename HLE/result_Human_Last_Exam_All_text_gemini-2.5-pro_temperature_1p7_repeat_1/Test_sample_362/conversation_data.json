    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Wittig reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants**\n\n*   **Carbonyl Compound:** The first reactant is pivalaldehyde. The \"pivaloyl\" group refers to a tert-butyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon. Therefore, pivalaldehyde is also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal. Its chemical structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent (Phosphonium Ylide):** The second reactant is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. Let's break down this name to determine its structure:\n    *   \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" indicates a triphenylphosphine group, Ph₃P.\n    *   The group attached to the phosphorus via a double bond is \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)\".\n    *   \"ethylidene\" is a two-carbon group with a double bond at the first carbon: =CH-CH₃.\n    *   \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" means there is a 2-chlorophenyl group (a benzene ring with chlorine at the ortho position) attached to the second carbon of the ethylidene group.\n    *   Combining these parts, the structure of the ylide is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl).\n\n**Step 2: Predict the connectivity of the product**\n\nThe Wittig reaction is a powerful method for forming carbon-carbon double bonds. The core transformation involves replacing the C=O double bond of an aldehyde or ketone with a C=C double bond from the ylide.\n*   The oxygen atom from the pivalaldehyde (C=**O**) is removed.\n*   The triphenylphosphine group (Ph₃P=) from the ylide is removed.\n*   The carbonyl carbon of the pivalaldehyde (`CH` from the -CHO group) forms a new double bond with the ylidic carbon of the Wittig reagent (`CH` from the P=CH group).\n*   The fragments to be joined are:\n    *   From pivalaldehyde: (CH₃)₃C-CH=\n    *   From the ylide: =CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)\n*   Joining these fragments at the double bond gives the product's carbon skeleton:\n    (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry of the product**\n\nThe stereochemistry (E/Z isomerism) of the newly formed double bond depends on the nature of the ylide.\n*   **Stabilized ylides** (with electron-withdrawing groups like C=O or CN on the ylidic carbon) typically yield the more stable **E-alkene**.\n*   **Unstabilized ylides** (with only hydrogen or alkyl groups on the ylidic carbon) typically yield the **Z-alkene** as the major product. This reaction is under kinetic control.\n*   In our case, the ylide is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl). The ylidic carbon is bonded to a hydrogen and a -CH₂-Ar group, which is an alkyl-type group. Thus, this is an **unstabilized ylide**.\n*   Therefore, the major product of the reaction will be the **Z-isomer**.\n\nTo assign the Z configuration, we look at the priorities of the groups attached to each carbon of the double bond (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules):\n*   On the carbon from pivalaldehyde (`-CH=`):\n    *   Higher priority: tert-butyl group, -C(CH₃)₃\n    *   Lower priority: Hydrogen, -H\n*   On the carbon from the ylide (`=CH-`):\n    *   Higher priority: 2-chlorobenzyl group, -CH₂-(C₆H₄-2-Cl)\n    *   Lower priority: Hydrogen, -H\nThe **Z-isomer** (from German *zusammen*, meaning \"together\") has the two higher-priority groups on the same side of the double bond.\n\n**Step 4: Name the final product**\n\n1.  **Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond:** The chain is -C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH-CH₂-, which is a 5-carbon chain (a pentene).\n2.  **Number the chain:** Numbering should start from the end that gives the double bond the lowest possible number. Numbering from the end with the 2-chlorophenyl group gives the double bond position 2.\n    `(2-chlorophenyl)-C¹H₂-C²H=C³H-C⁴(CH₃)₂-C⁵H₃`\n3.  **Identify and name the substituents:**\n    *   At position 1: a 2-chlorophenyl group.\n    *   At position 4: two methyl groups (4,4-dimethyl).\n4.  **Assemble the full name:** Including the stereochemistry, the name is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\nThe byproduct of the reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O). The question asks for the organic product.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final product is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
