    "This is a classic mathematical problem in the field of geometry known as \"circle packing in a circle\". The goal is to find the minimum radius of a large circle that can contain a given number (N) of smaller, equal-sized circles. For N=14, this is a non-trivial problem whose solution has been established through mathematical research.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radius:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are asked to find the radius, R, of a large circle that can snugly fit 14 smaller circles, each with a radius of r=1. \"Tightly packed\" implies finding the smallest possible large circle, which corresponds to the optimal packing arrangement.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Nature of the Solution**\nThe optimal arrangement of circles is not always a simple, symmetrical pattern, especially for numbers like 14. For small numbers of circles, the arrangements are intuitive (e.g., N=1, R=r; N=7, R=3r). However, for N=14, the arrangement is complex and was not rigorously proven until 2003 by F. Fodor. It is not something that can be easily deduced from first principles without advanced computation.\n\n**Step 3: Describe the Optimal Arrangement for N=14**\nThe proven optimal arrangement for 14 circles does not have a central circle. Instead, it features an inner group of 4 circles and an outer ring of 10 circles. The entire configuration has two-fold rotational symmetry (C2 symmetry). In this arrangement, the circles are \"locked\" in place by numerous points of contact among themselves and with the outer containing circle.\n\n**Step 4: The Mathematical Approach to Finding the Radius (R)**\nTo find the radius R, one must solve a system of geometric equations. Let the center of the large circle be the origin (0, 0).\n*   The distance from the origin to the center of any of the 14 small circles must be less than or equal to `R - r`. Since r=1, this distance is `≤ R - 1`.\n*   The distance between the centers of any two small circles must be greater than or equal to `2r`, which is `≥ 2`.\n*   In a \"tightly packed\" configuration, some of these distances will be equalities. The outermost circles will have their centers at a distance of exactly `R - 1` from the origin. Certain pairs of small circles will be touching, meaning the distance between their centers is exactly `2`.\n\nSolving these equations for the specific optimal geometry of N=14 leads to a high-degree polynomial equation whose root gives the value of R. This is computationally intensive.\n\n**Step 5: Using the Established Result**\nSince solving this from scratch is not practical, we refer to the known, published results for this problem. The ratio of the large radius (R) to the small radius (r) for the optimal packing of N=14 circles is a known constant.\nAccording to the established literature (e.g., results by Fodor, compiled on resource sites like Packomania):\nThe ratio `R/r` for N=14 is approximately 3.8244408.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\nWe are given that the radius of the small circles is `r = 1`.\nWe can now calculate the radius of the large circle, R:\n`R = r * (R/r)`\n`R = 1 * 3.8244408`\n`R ≈ 3.8244408`\n\n**Step 7: Round to the Required Precision**\nThe question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits.\nThe number is 3.8244408...\nThe first four significant digits are 3, 8, 2, and 4.\nThe fifth significant digit is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we do not round up the preceding digit.\nTherefore, the radius R rounded to 4 significant digits is 3.824.\n\n<<<3.824>>>"
