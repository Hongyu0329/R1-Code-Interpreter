    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the numerical imprints on Teva brand fluoxetine capsules for 10mg and 20mg strengths.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Request**\nThe core task is to identify the unique numbers printed on two specific pharmaceutical products:\n1.  Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules.\n2.  Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n\nThere are several strict constraints to follow:\n*   Only mention the imprinted numbers.\n*   Do not mention any differences in color.\n*   Do not mention the word \"PLIVA\" (which is associated with a company acquired by Teva).\n*   Do not mention any differences in capsule size.\n\n**Step 2: Research the Imprint for Teva Fluoxetine 10mg Capsule**\nTo find the correct imprint, one must consult a reliable pharmaceutical database such as the FDA's National Drug Code (NDC) Directory or a trusted source like DailyMed.\n*   **Product:** Fluoxetine Hydrochloride Capsule, 10 mg\n*   **Labeler / Manufacturer:** Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.\n*   **Research Finding:** According to official drug information sources, the capsule is imprinted with \"TEVA\" on one part and a four-digit number on the other part.\n*   **The Number:** The number imprinted on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is **3105**.\n\n**Step 3: Research the Imprint for Teva Fluoxetine 20mg Capsule**\nSimilarly, research is conducted for the 20mg strength from the same manufacturer.\n*   **Product:** Fluoxetine Hydrochloride Capsule, 20 mg\n*   **Labeler / Manufacturer:** Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.\n*   **Research Finding:** This capsule is also imprinted with \"TEVA\" on one part and a distinct four-digit number on the other part to differentiate it from the 10mg strength.\n*   **The Number:** The number imprinted on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is **3106**.\n\n**Step 4: Consolidate the Findings and Adhere to Constraints**\nNow, we combine the information gathered and filter it based on the user's specific constraints.\n*   **10mg Capsule Number:** 3105\n*   **20mg Capsule Number:** 3106\n*   **Check Constraints:**\n    *   Mention only the numbers? Yes, the analysis focuses on 3105 and 3106.\n    *   No color mentioned? Yes.\n    *   No \"PLIVA\" mentioned? Yes.\n    *   No size mentioned? Yes.\n\nThe final answer will clearly state which number corresponds to which capsule strength.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Manufacturer Specificity:** Fluoxetine is a generic drug made by many manufacturers. It is crucial to look up the specific information for the \"Teva\" brand, as imprints differ between companies.\n2.  **Imprint Components:** Pharmaceutical imprints can consist of letters, numbers, or logos. The question specifically asks for the \"numbers,\" so the answer should isolate the numerical part of the imprint (\"3105\" and \"3106\") from the text part (\"TEVA\").\n3.  **Avoiding Excluded Information:** The negative constraints (no color, size, or \"PLIVA\") are as important as the primary question. The analysis must be careful to omit this information from the final response. This includes information about the capsule's appearance (e.g., colors of the cap and body) which is often provided in drug databases.\n\n<<<The Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number 3105, and the 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number 3106.>>>"
