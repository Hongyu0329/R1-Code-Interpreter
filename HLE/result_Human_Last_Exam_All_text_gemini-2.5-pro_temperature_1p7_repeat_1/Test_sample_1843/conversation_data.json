    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the Conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Primitive Characters and their Decomposition\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is called **primitive** if it is not induced by a character modulo a proper divisor of $N$.\nIf $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ is the prime factorization of $N$, then any character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$\nwhere each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nA key property is that the character $\\chi$ is primitive with conductor $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nFor our problem, a primitive character $\\chi$ of conductor $N=36036$ can be written as:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\cdot \\chi_{9} \\cdot \\chi_{7} \\cdot \\chi_{11} \\cdot \\chi_{13}$\nwhere each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ is primitive.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Order of the Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe require this order to be 6. For the lcm to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^a})$, must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders must contain at least one order divisible by 2 and at least one order divisible by 3.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Choices for Each Component Character\nWe need to count how many choices we have for each primitive component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ such that its order divides 6. Let $\\psi(d, m)$ denote the number of primitive characters of conductor $m$ and order $d$.\n\n*   **Component mod 4 ($2^2$)**:\n    The group of Dirichlet characters mod 4 is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one primitive character mod 4 (the non-principal one), and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, we have **1** choice for $\\chi_4$. $\\text{ord}(\\chi_4)=2$.\n\n*   **Component mod 9 ($3^2$)**:\n    The group of characters mod 9 is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. The characters that are not primitive are induced from characters mod 3 (which have orders 1 and 2). Therefore, the primitive characters mod 9 are those of orders 3 and 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\psi(3, 9) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\psi(6, 9) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both 3 and 6 divide 6. So, the total number of choices for $\\chi_9$ is $2 + 2 = \\mathbf{4}$.\n\n*   **Component mod 7**:\n    The group of characters mod 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. We need to count those whose order divides 6. These are characters of order 2, 3, and 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\psi(2, 7) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\psi(3, 7) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\psi(6, 7) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Total number of choices for $\\chi_7$ is $1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n*   **Component mod 11**:\n    The group of characters mod 11 is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. A primitive character's order must divide 10. To also satisfy the condition that the order divides 6, the order must divide $\\text{gcd}(10, 6) = 2$. Since a primitive character must have order greater than 1, the only possible order is 2.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\psi(2, 11) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    Total number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$ is **1**.\n\n*   **Component mod 13**:\n    The group of characters mod 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. The order of a valid primitive character must divide $\\text{gcd}(12, 6) = 6$. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 2: $\\psi(2, 13) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 3: $\\psi(3, 13) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of primitive characters of order 6: $\\psi(6, 13) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the lcm Condition and Final Calculation\nNow we verify that for any combination of the allowed characters, the resulting order is exactly 6.\nLet the tuple of orders be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\n- From the mod 4 component, we must choose a character of order $o_4=2$. This guarantees that the lcm will be divisible by 2.\n- From the mod 9 component, we must choose a character of order $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$. This guarantees that the lcm will be divisible by 3.\n\nSince the lcm of the orders is always divisible by 2 and 3, it must be divisible by $\\text{lcm}(2,3) = 6$.\nFurthermore, since the order of each component was chosen to be a divisor of 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\nAn integer that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 must be 6 itself.\nTherefore, any combination of the characters we counted will result in a character of order exactly 6.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal Number = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal Number = $100$"
