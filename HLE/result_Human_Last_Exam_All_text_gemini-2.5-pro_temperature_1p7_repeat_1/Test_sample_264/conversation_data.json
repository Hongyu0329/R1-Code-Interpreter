    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Set up a Coordinate System**\nTo analyze the problem, we first place the cubes in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's define the first cube, C1, to have its vertices at coordinates where each coordinate is either 0 or 1. This is a cube of side length 1.\nThe region occupied by C1 is:\n*   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**2. Interpret the \"Shift along the Main Diagonal\"**\nThe \"main diagonal\" of this cube connects the vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex (1, 1, 1). The direction of this diagonal can be represented by the vector **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n\nThe phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is slightly ambiguous. There are two common interpretations:\n*   **Interpretation A:** The shift vector has components of 1/2 along each axis. This means the shift vector is **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n*   **Interpretation B:** The magnitude (length) of the shift vector is 1/2. The shift vector would be (1/2) times the unit vector in the diagonal direction, which is **s** = (1/2) * (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3) = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)).\n\n**Careful Point:** Interpretation B leads to irrational coordinates and a very complicated expression for the volume. Interpretation A creates a neat geometric arrangement where one vertex of the second cube is moved to the exact center of the first cube, and it yields a clean, simple answer. In problems of this type, the interpretation that leads to an elegant solution is almost always the intended one. Therefore, we will proceed with Interpretation A.\n\n**3. Define the Second Cube**\nThe second cube, C2, is obtained by shifting C1 by the vector **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). To find the boundaries of C2, we add 1/2 to the coordinate ranges of C1:\nThe region occupied by C2 is:\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n*   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n**4. Find the Intersection of the Two Cubes**\nThe intersection of C1 and C2 is the region where a point (x, y, z) satisfies the inequalities for both cubes. We find this by finding the intersection of the intervals for each coordinate.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The region must satisfy `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`. The overlapping interval is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** The region must satisfy `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`. The overlapping interval is `[1/2, 1]`.\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The region must satisfy `0 ≤ z ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`. The overlapping interval is `[1/2, 1]`.\n\nThe intersection is a new rectangular prism (in this case, a cube) defined by:\n*   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n*   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n**5. Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\nThe volume of this intersection cube is the product of its side lengths.\n\n*   Side length in x-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in y-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n*   Side length in z-direction = `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`\n\nThe volume (V) is:\nV = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Ambiguity in Phrasing:** The most critical step is correctly interpreting the phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". Choosing the shift vector (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) is justified by the elegant geometry and simple result it produces.\n*   **Coordinate System:** Setting up the first cube at `[0,1]^3` simplifies the boundary calculations.\n*   **Intersection Logic:** The intersection of two axis-aligned boxes is found by taking the intersection of their respective 1D coordinate intervals. This makes the calculation straightforward.\n\nFinal Answer: The volume of the intersection is a cube with side length 1/2. Its volume is (1/2)³.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
