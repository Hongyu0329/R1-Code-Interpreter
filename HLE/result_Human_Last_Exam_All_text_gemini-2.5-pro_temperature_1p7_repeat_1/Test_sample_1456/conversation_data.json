    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question and Define Key Terms**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[a, b]`, a circle, a sphere, but also more exotic objects like solenoids or the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Nondegenerate:** The continuum is not a single point. This is a crucial condition.\n*   **Product of two continua:** If `X` and `Y` are continua, their Cartesian product `X x Y` with the product topology is also a continuum.\n*   **Composant:** This is the most important concept. The composant of a point `p` in a continuum `Z` is the set of all points `q` such that `p` and `q` are contained in some *proper* subcontinuum of `Z`. (A subcontinuum `K` of `Z` is proper if `K ≠ Z`). The composants of a continuum form a partition of the space.\n\n**2. Relate Composants to Decomposability**\n\nThe number of composants a continuum has is directly related to whether it is \"decomposable\" or \"indecomposable\".\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `Z` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two proper subcontinua, i.e., `Z = A U B` where `A` and `B` are subcontinua of `Z` and `A ≠ Z`, `B ≠ Z`.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** For any decomposable continuum, it can be shown that there is only **one** composant. The entire space is a single composant. For any two points `p` and `q` in a decomposable continuum, there always exists a proper subcontinuum containing them.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that is not decomposable.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Mazurkiewicz's Theorem):** A landmark result in continuum theory states that any indecomposable continuum has **uncountably many** composants. Specifically, it has **`c`** composants, where `c` is the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers).\n\n**3. Analyze the Number of Composants of the Product Space**\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible number* of composants of `X x Y`. Based on the points above, the number of composants for the continuum `X x Y` can only be `1` (if `X x Y` is decomposable) or `c` (if `X x Y` is indecomposable). Therefore, the largest possible number is `c`, *if* we can find two nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y` such that their product `X x Y` is indecomposable.\n\nThe core of the problem is now: **Is it possible for the product `X x Y` of two nondegenerate continua to be indecomposable?**\n\n**4. Investigate the Decomposability of a Product Space `X x Y`**\n\nLet's see what happens under different conditions for `X` and `Y`.\n\n*   **Case 1: At least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable.**\n    *   Suppose `X` is decomposable. By definition, we can write `X = A U B`, where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `X`.\n    *   Consider the product `X x Y = (A U B) x Y = (A x Y) U (B x Y)`.\n    *   The set `A x Y` is a product of two continua, so it is a continuum. Since `A` is a proper subset of `X` (and `Y` is non-empty), `A x Y` is a proper subset of `X x Y`. Thus, `A x Y` is a proper subcontinuum of `X x Y`.\n    *   Similarly, `B x Y` is a proper subcontinuum of `X x Y`.\n    *   Since `X x Y` is the union of two of its proper subcontinua, `X x Y` is decomposable.\n    *   **Conclusion for Case 1:** If either `X` or `Y` is decomposable, the product `X x Y` is decomposable and has only **1** composant.\n\n*   **Case 2: Both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.**\n    *   From Case 1, we know that for `X x Y` to have a chance of being indecomposable, both `X` and `Y` must be indecomposable.\n    *   **Careful Point 3 (A Deeper Theorem):** The condition that `X` and `Y` are merely indecomposable is not sufficient to guarantee that `X x Y` is indecomposable. A stronger property is needed. We must introduce the idea of a *hereditarily indecomposable* continuum.\n    *   **Hereditarily Indecomposable (HI) Continuum:** A continuum is HI if every non-trivial subcontinuum within it is indecomposable.\n    *   **Key Theorem (Krasinkiewicz):** The product of two nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y` is indecomposable if and only if both `X` and `Y` are hereditarily indecomposable.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion: Constructing the Maximum Case**\n\nTo achieve the largest possible number of composants, we need to construct a scenario where `X x Y` is indecomposable.\n\n1.  According to the key theorem, this requires both `X` and `Y` to be nondegenerate, hereditarily indecomposable continua.\n2.  Do such continua exist? Yes. The most famous example is the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is a nondegenerate continuum which is hereditarily indecomposable.\n3.  Let's choose `X` to be a pseudo-arc and `Y` to be a pseudo-arc.\n    *   `X` and `Y` are both nondegenerate continua.\n    *   `X` and `Y` are both hereditarily indecomposable.\n4.  By the theorem of Krasinkiewicz, the product `X x Y` is an indecomposable continuum.\n5.  By the theorem of Mazurkiewicz, since `X x Y` is an indecomposable continuum, it has `c` (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n\nSince we have found an example where the number of composants is `c`, and the only other possibility is 1, the largest possible number of composants is `c`.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n*   The number of composants of a continuum is either 1 or `c`.\n*   We want to maximize this number, so we aim to achieve `c`.\n*   A continuum has `c` composants if and only if it is indecomposable.\n*   The product `X x Y` is indecomposable if and only if both `X` and `Y` are hereditarily indecomposable continua.\n*   Hereditarily indecomposable continua (like the pseudo-arc) exist.\n*   Therefore, taking `X` and `Y` to be two pseudo-arcs results in a product `X x Y` which is indecomposable and thus has `c` composants.\n*   This is the maximum possible number.\n\nThe largest possible number of composants is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (an uncountable infinity).\n\n<<<c>>>"
