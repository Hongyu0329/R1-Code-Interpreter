    "This problem asks for the size of the smallest algebraic structure needed to color the figure-eight knot. This is a classic problem in knot theory. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Knot Coloring\n\nThe standard way to \"color\" a knot is using **Fox n-coloring**. This involves assigning an integer \"color\" from the set `{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}` to each arc of the knot diagram. The coloring must obey a specific rule at every crossing:\n\n*   Let the three arcs meeting at a crossing have colors *a*, *b*, and *c*.\n*   Let *c* be the color of the arc that goes **over** the other two arcs.\n*   The rule is: **2c ≡ a + b (mod n)**. This can be rewritten as `2c - a - b = 0 (mod n)`.\n\nA coloring is considered **non-trivial** if at least two different colors are used. A **trivial** coloring uses the same color for every arc (which is always a valid solution for any *n*). The question is asking for the smallest integer `n > 1` that permits a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot. This number *n* will be the number of elements (colors) in our algebraic structure, which is the set of integers modulo *n*.\n\n### Step 2: Setting up Equations for the Figure-Eight Knot\n\nThe figure-eight knot (also known as knot 4₁) has 4 arcs and 4 crossings in its minimal projection. Let's label the four arcs as `x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`, and `x₄`.\n\nHere is a standard diagram and the corresponding over/under relationships at each crossing:\n1.  **Crossing 1 (Top Left):** Arc `x₄` is over arcs `x₁` and `x₂`. Equation: `2x₄ ≡ x₁ + x₂ (mod n)`\n2.  **Crossing 2 (Top Right):** Arc `x₂` is over arcs `x₁` and `x₃`. Equation: `2x₂ ≡ x₁ + x₃ (mod n)`\n3.  **Crossing 3 (Bottom Right):** Arc `x₁` is over arcs `x₃` and `x₄`. Equation: `2x₁ ≡ x₃ + x₄ (mod n)`\n4.  **Crossing 4 (Bottom Left):** Arc `x₃` is over arcs `x₂` and `x₄`. Equation: `2x₃ ≡ x₂ + x₄ (mod n)`\n\nThis gives us a system of four linear homogeneous equations:\n1.  `x₁ + x₂ - 2x₄ = 0 (mod n)`\n2.  `x₁ - 2x₂ + x₃ = 0 (mod n)`\n3.  `x₃ + x₄ - 2x₁ = 0 (mod n)`  (rewritten from `2x₁ = x₃ + x₄`)\n4.  `x₂ - 2x₃ + x₄ = 0 (mod n)`\n\n### Step 3: The Knot Determinant\n\nA non-trivial solution to this system of equations exists if and only if the **determinant of the knot** is a multiple of *n* (or, more precisely, if `gcd(n, det(K)) > 1`). The determinant of a knot is found from the coefficient matrix of this system.\n\nLet's write the coefficient matrix `M`:\n```\n     x₁   x₂   x₃   x₄\n   | 1    1    0   -2 |\nM =| 1   -2    1    0 |\n   |-2    0    1    1 |\n   | 0    1   -2    1 |\n```\nThe determinant of a knot is defined as the absolute value of the determinant of any submatrix formed by removing one row and one column (this value is an invariant of the knot). Let's remove the last row and last column to get a 3x3 matrix `M'`:\n```\n      | 1    1    0 |\nM' =  | 1   -2    1 |\n      |-2    0    1 |\n```\nNow, we calculate the determinant of `M'`:\n`det(M') = 1 * ((-2)(1) - (1)(0)) - 1 * ((1)(1) - (1)(-2)) + 0 * (...)`\n`det(M') = 1 * (-2 - 0) - 1 * (1 - (-2)) + 0`\n`det(M') = 1 * (-2) - 1 * (3)`\n`det(M') = -2 - 3 = -5`\n\nThe determinant of the figure-eight knot is `|det(M')| = |-5| = 5`.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Number of Colors\n\nFor a knot to be *n*-colorable, *n* must be a factor of its determinant.\nThe determinant of the figure-eight knot is 5.\nThe factors of 5 are 1 and 5.\n\n*   An *n*=1 coloring is always possible but is always trivial (only one color).\n*   For a non-trivial coloring, we need `n > 1`.\n\nThe smallest integer `n > 1` that is a factor of 5 is **5**.\n\nTherefore, the figure-eight knot is 5-colorable. The smallest algebraic structure that allows for its coloring is the set of integers modulo 5, which is `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. This structure has 5 elements.\n\nAs a check, we can find a non-trivial coloring. Using the equations from Step 2 with `n=5` and setting `x₁=0, x₂=1`, we find the unique solution `(x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄) = (0, 1, 2, 3)`, which is a valid, non-trivial 5-coloring.\n\nThe smallest number of elements in the algebraic structure is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
