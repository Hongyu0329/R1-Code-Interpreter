    "Answering the question requires a systematic approach involving concepts from knot theory and low-dimensional topology, specifically concerning the homology cobordism group of 3-manifolds.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_3^H$):** This is a group whose elements are equivalence classes of oriented homology 3-spheres. Two homology spheres $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are equivalent if there exists an oriented 4-manifold $W$ (a homology cobordism) with boundary $\\partial W = Y_1 \\cup (-Y_2)$ such that the inclusion maps $H_*(Y_1) \\to H_*(W)$ and $H_*(Y_2) \\to H_*(W)$ are isomorphisms. The group operation is connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** This is a procedure that creates a 3-manifold from a knot $K$ in $S^3$. An integral surgery is specified by an integer framing $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_n(K)$.\n*   **Condition for a Homology Sphere:** For $S^3_n(K)$ to be a homology sphere (i.e., having the same integer homology groups as $S^3$), its first homology group $H_1(S^3_n(K); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$ must be trivial. This happens if and only if $|n|=1$. Thus, we only need to consider surgeries with coefficients $+1$ and $-1$.\n\n**Step 2: List all knots with at most four crossings**\nThe knots with a crossing number of four or less are:\n1.  **0 crossings:** The unknot, $0_1$.\n2.  **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot, $3_1$. This knot is chiral, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image. We must consider both the right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil ($m(3_1)$).\n3.  **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\nSo, the full list of knots to analyze is: the unknot, the right-handed trefoil, the left-handed trefoil, and the figure-eight knot.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the homology spheres from surgery on each knot**\nFor each knot, we consider the homology spheres resulting from +1 and -1 surgery and determine the corresponding element in $\\Theta_3^H$. We will use invariants like the Casson invariant ($\\lambda$), the Rohlin invariant ($\\mu$), and Heegaard Floer d-invariants to distinguish the elements.\n\n**A. The Unknot ($0_1$)**\n*   +1 surgery on the unknot, $S^3_{+1}(0_1)$, yields the standard 3-sphere $S^3$.\n*   -1 surgery on the unknot, $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$, also yields $S^3$.\n*   In $\\Theta_3^H$, $S^3$ is the identity element.\n*   **Result:** 1 element (the identity).\n\n**B. The Trefoil Knot ($3_1$ and its mirror $m(3_1)$)**\nWe use the fact that surgery on a mirror image relates to the inverse element: $S^3_n(m(K)) = -S^3_{-n}(K)$.\n1.  **$S^3_{+1}(3_1)$:** This is the Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$. It is a non-trivial homology sphere with Casson invariant $\\lambda=1$ and Rohlin invariant $\\mu=1$. It has infinite order in $\\Theta_3^H$. Let's call its class $A$.\n2.  **$S^3_{-1}(3_1)$:** Using the relation, this is $-S^3_{+1}(m(3_1))$. Let's first analyze $S^3_{+1}(m(3_1))$.\n3.  **$S^3_{+1}(m(3_1))$:** This is the PoincarÃ© homology sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. It is also a non-trivial element with $\\lambda=1$ and $\\mu=1$. Let's call its class $C$.\n    *   **Are A and C the same element?** Although they have the same $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ invariants, they are known to be distinct elements in $\\Theta_3^H$. This can be shown using finer invariants like Heegaard Floer d-invariants: $d(A) = d(\\Sigma(2,3,7)) = -2$, while $d(C) = d(\\Sigma(2,3,5)) = 0$. Since $d$ is a homology cobordism invariant, $A \\neq C$.\n4.  **$S^3_{-1}(m(3_1))$:** This is $-S^3_{+1}(3_1) = -A$.\n5.  **Revisiting $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$:** This is $-S^3_{+1}(m(3_1)) = -C$.\n\nSo, from the trefoil and its mirror, we generate the set of elements $\\{A, -C, C, -A\\}$. We need to check for any other equalities. Since $A$ and $C$ have infinite order, $A \\neq -A$ and $C \\neq -C$. Could $A = -C$? This is impossible as $\\lambda(A)=1$ while $\\lambda(-C) = -\\lambda(C) = -1$.\n*   **Result:** 4 distinct non-trivial elements: $A, -A, C, -C$.\n\n**C. The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\nThis knot is amphichiral, meaning $4_1 = m(4_1)$. This gives the relation $S^3_{-n}(4_1) = -S^3_n(4_1)$.\n1.  **$S^3_{+1}(4_1)$:** This is a non-trivial homology sphere with $\\lambda=1$ and $\\mu=1$. Let's call its class $F$.\n2.  **$S^3_{-1}(4_1)$:** Using the amphichiral property, this is $-S^3_{+1}(4_1) = -F$.\n    *   **Is F a new element?** We must compare it with the elements from the trefoils, specifically those with $\\lambda=1$, which are $A$ and $C$. The d-invariant for $F$ is $d(S^3_{+1}(4_1)) = 2$. Since $d(A)=-2$, $d(C)=0$, and $d(F)=2$, the d-invariants are all different. Therefore, $F$ is a new element, distinct from $A$ and $C$.\n    *   It follows that $-F$ is also distinct from $-A$ and $-C$.\n*   **Result:** 2 new distinct elements: $F$ and $-F$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the total number of distinct elements**\nBy systematically analyzing each knot, we have found the following distinct elements in the homology cobordism group:\n*   From the unknot: 1 element (the identity).\n*   From the trefoil and its mirror: 4 distinct non-trivial elements ($[S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$, $[-S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$, $[S^3_{+1}(m(3_1))]$, $[-S^3_{+1}(m(3_1))]$).\n*   From the figure-eight knot: 2 distinct non-trivial elements ($[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$, $[-S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$).\n\nThe total number of distinct elements is the sum of these counts: $1 + 4 + 2 = 7$.\n\nFinal list of distinct elements:\n1.  $[S^3]$ (the identity)\n2.  $[S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$\n3.  $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)]$\n4.  $[S^3_{+1}(m(3_1))]$\n5.  $[S^3_{-1}(m(3_1))]$\n6.  $[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$\n7.  $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$\n\nThese seven elements are all distinct in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\n>>>7"
