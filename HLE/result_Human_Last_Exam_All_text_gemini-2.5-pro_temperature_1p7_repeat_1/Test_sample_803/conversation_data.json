    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset $S$ of a group $G$ is called product-free if for all $a, b \\in S$, their product $ab$ is not in $S$. This can be written as $S \\cap S^2 = \\emptyset$, where $S^2 = \\{ab \\mid a, b \\in S\\}$.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPS):** A product-free set $S$ is a MIPS if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in $G$.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group $G$ is called *filled* if for every MIPS $S$ in $G$, the equality $G = S \\cup S^2 \\cup \\{1_G\\}$ holds.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Characterization of Finite Filled Groups\n\nThe core of the analysis relies on a known powerful theorem that classifies finite filled groups:\n\n**Theorem (Kropholler, Linnell, Moody):** A finite group $G$ is filled if and only if one of the following two conditions is met:\n1.  $G$ is an elementary abelian 3-group (i.e., $G \\cong C_3 \\times \\dots \\times C_3 = (C_3)^k$ for some $k \\ge 1$).\n2.  $G$ has a unique element of order 2 (a unique involution).\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Characterization to the Specific Group Order\n\nWe are looking for nonabelian filled groups $G$ of order $|G| = 2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m$ is a natural number.\n\n*   **Condition 1 Check:** Can $G$ be an elementary abelian 3-group? The order of such a group is $3^k$. Our group has order $2q^m$. For $2q^m = 3^k$, we would need $2=3^k$ and $q=3$ with $2 \\cdot 3^m = 3^k$, which gives $2=3^{k-m}$. Neither is possible. Thus, this case does not apply.\n*   **Condition 2 Application:** Since case 1 is ruled out, a group $G$ of order $2q^m$ is filled if and only if it has a unique element of order 2.\n\nOur task is now simplified to finding all nonabelian groups of order $2q^m$ that possess a unique element of order 2.\n\n### Step 4: Relate the \"Unique Involution\" Property to Group Structure\n\nLet's analyze what it means for a group $G$ of order $2q^m$ to have a unique element of order 2.\n*   The prime factorization of the order of $G$ is $2^1 \\cdot q^m$.\n*   By Sylow's Theorems, the order of a Sylow 2-subgroup of $G$ is $2^1=2$.\n*   Any subgroup of order 2 consists of the identity and an element of order 2. Conversely, any element of order 2 generates a subgroup of order 2.\n*   Therefore, the subgroups of order 2 in $G$ are precisely the Sylow 2-subgroups.\n*   The number of elements of order 2 is equal to the number of Sylow 2-subgroups, denoted $n_2$. This is because all elements of order 2 are contained in some Sylow 2-subgroup, and these subgroups only intersect at the identity.\n*   The condition that $G$ has a unique element of order 2 is equivalent to the condition that $G$ has a unique Sylow 2-subgroup, i.e., $n_2=1$.\n\n### Step 5: Deduce the Group Structure from Sylow Subgroup Normality\n\nAccording to Sylow's Second Theorem, a Sylow subgroup is unique if and only if it is normal.\nSo, the condition is that the Sylow 2-subgroup, let's call it $P$, must be normal in $G$ ($P \\triangleleft G$).\n\nLet's also consider the Sylow $q$-subgroup, $Q$, which has order $q^m$. The number of Sylow $q$-subgroups, $n_q$, must divide 2 and satisfy $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$. Since $q$ is an odd prime ($q \\ge 3$), the congruence $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$ cannot be satisfied by $n_q=2$ (as $2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$ would imply $q=1$). Therefore, $n_q$ must be 1. This means the Sylow $q$-subgroup $Q$ is also normal in $G$ ($Q \\triangleleft G$).\n\nWe now have two normal subgroups:\n1.  $P \\triangleleft G$, with $|P| = 2$.\n2.  $Q \\triangleleft G$, with $|Q| = q^m$.\n\nSince their orders are coprime ($\\gcd(2, q^m)=1$), their intersection is trivial: $P \\cap Q = \\{1_G\\}$.\nAlso, $|P||Q| = 2q^m = |G|$.\nA standard result in group theory states that if a group $G$ has two normal subgroups $H$ and $K$ such that $H \\cap K = \\{1\\}$ and $G=HK$, then $G$ is isomorphic to their direct product, $G \\cong H \\times K$.\nIn our case, this means $G \\cong P \\times Q$.\nSince $|P|=2$, $P \\cong C_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2).\nThus, any filled group of order $2q^m$ must be of the form $G \\cong C_2 \\times Q$, where $Q$ is a group of order $q^m$.\n\n### Step 6: Impose the Nonabelian Condition\n\nThe question specifies that we are looking for *nonabelian* groups.\nThe direct product $C_2 \\times Q$ is nonabelian if and only if at least one of its factors is nonabelian. Since $C_2$ is abelian, the group $G$ is nonabelian if and only if $Q$ is a nonabelian group.\n\n### Step 7: Determine When Such Nonabelian Groups Exist\n\nThe group $Q$ has order $q^m$, where $q$ is a prime. Such groups are called $q$-groups (or $p$-groups). A fundamental result concerning $p$-groups states:\n*   Any group of order $p$ or $p^2$ (for a prime $p$) is abelian.\n*   For any prime $p$ and any integer $n \\ge 3$, there exists at least one nonabelian group of order $p^n$.\n\nApplying this to our group $Q$ of order $q^m$:\n*   If $m=1$ or $m=2$, any group $Q$ of order $q$ or $q^2$ is abelian. In this case, $G \\cong C_2 \\times Q$ is also abelian.\n*   If $m \\ge 3$, there exist nonabelian groups of order $q^m$. For any such nonabelian group $Q$, the direct product $G = C_2 \\times Q$ will be a nonabelian group of order $2q^m$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining all the steps, the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are precisely those groups that are isomorphic to a direct product of the cyclic group of order 2 and a nonabelian group of order $q^m$. Such nonabelian groups of order $q^m$ exist if and only if $m \\ge 3$.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ (where $q$ is an odd prime and $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$) are all groups of the form $C_2 \\times Q$, where $Q$ is a nonabelian group of order $q^m$. Such groups exist if and only if $m \\ge 3$.>>>"
