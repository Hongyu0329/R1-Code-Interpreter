The glycan is a difucosylated, monosialylated biantennary complex N-glycan. In Oxford nomenclature, the composition is described as FA2G2S1 with an additional antennary fucose, creating a sialyl Lewis X epitope. The known linkages are: core Fuc(α1-6)GlcNAc and an antennary NeuAc(α2-3)Gal(β1-4)[Fuc(α1-3)]GlcNAc structure.
