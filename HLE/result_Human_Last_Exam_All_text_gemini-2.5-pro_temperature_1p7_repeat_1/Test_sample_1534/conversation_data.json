    "This question requires an understanding of the neuroanatomy of cephalopods, specifically the cuttlefish. The brain of a cuttlefish is a highly complex structure that encircles the esophagus and is broadly divided into a supra-esophageal mass and a sub-esophageal mass. The palliovisceral lobe is a key part of this structure.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Palliovisceral Lobe**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the palliovisceral lobe within the cuttlefish brain.\n*   The cuttlefish brain is organized around the esophagus.\n*   The portion of the brain below the esophagus is the **sub-esophageal mass**. This mass primarily controls motor and autonomic functions.\n*   The sub-esophageal mass is further divided into anterior, middle, and posterior parts.\n*   The **palliovisceral lobe** is the largest and most prominent structure within the **posterior sub-esophageal mass**. Its name indicates its function: *pallio* refers to the mantle, and *visceral* refers to the internal organs. This lobe controls respiration, jet propulsion (via the mantle muscles), ink ejection, and the function of internal organs.\n*   Given its location in the posterior sub-esophageal mass, the palliovisceral lobe is already one of the most posterior (rearmost) regions of the central brain complex.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"Adjacent Posteriorly\"**\n\nThe question asks for brain regions that lie \"adjacent posteriorly\". This means we are looking for distinct brain lobes that are located immediately behind, or posterolateral (to the back and side) of, the main body of the palliovisceral lobe. We must look for other lobes that are part of the posterior sub-esophageal mass complex.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Adjacent Posterior Brain Regions**\n\nBy examining neuroanatomical maps and descriptions of the cuttlefish (*Sepia*) brain, we can identify the lobes that fit the criteria. The posterior sub-esophageal mass is not just the palliovisceral lobe alone; it's a complex of fused lobes. The following lobes are situated in a position that can be described as adjacent and posterior to the main palliovisceral lobe:\n\n1.  **Posterior Fin Lobes:** Cuttlefish possess a pair of lateral fins that run along the sides of their mantle. These fins are used for stabilization and precise, slow-speed locomotion. The motor control for these fins originates in the **fin lobes**. The **posterior fin lobes** are paired structures located on the posterolateral aspects of the posterior sub-esophageal mass, directly adjacent to the palliovisceral lobe. Their position is clearly \"adjacent posteriorly\".\n\n2.  **Posterior Vaso-motor Lobe:** This lobe is involved in the control of the circulatory system, including the heart rate and blood pressure. It is located within the posterior sub-esophageal complex, in close proximity to the palliovisceral lobe, which controls the viscera that the circulatory system serves. The posterior portion of the vaso-motor system is intimately associated with the posterior aspect of the palliovisceral lobe.\n\n**Step 4: Consider and Exclude Other Nearby Structures**\n\n*   **Giant Fiber Lobes:** These lobes, which initiate the powerful escape-jetting reflex, are very closely associated with the palliovisceral lobe. However, they are typically described as lying on the *dorsal* (upper) surface of the palliovisceral lobe, not strictly posterior to it.\n*   **Stellate Ganglia:** The giant axons originating near the palliovisceral lobe project to the stellate ganglia, which then innervate the mantle muscle. However, the stellate ganglia are large peripheral ganglia located within the mantle wall, not part of the central brain itself. Therefore, they are not a \"brain region\".\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Central vs. Peripheral Nervous System:** The question specifically asks for \"brain regions.\" It is crucial to distinguish central brain lobes from peripheral ganglia like the stellate ganglia.\n2.  **Relative Positioning:** Anatomical terms like \"posteriorly\" are relative. Since the palliovisceral lobe forms the rearmost part of the sub-esophageal mass, the adjacent regions are often posterolateral (to the back and side) or posterodorsal (to the back and top).\n3.  **Lobe Fusion:** The lobes of the cephalopod brain are not separate, isolated structures but are fused into a single complex mass. Their boundaries are defined by cytology (cell structure) and function rather than by clear physical separation.\n4.  **Function-Location Correlation:** The location of the posterior fin lobes and posterior vaso-motor lobe makes functional sense. They are close to the palliovisceral lobe because they control systems (fins and circulation) that are anatomically located in the posterior part of the body and are functionally integrated with visceral and mantle activity.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the analysis, the primary brain regions situated adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the lobes controlling the fins and the circulatory system.\n\nThe brain regions lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the **posterior fin lobes** and the **posterior vaso-motor lobe**.\n\n<<<The posterior fin lobes and the posterior vaso-motor lobe.>>>"
