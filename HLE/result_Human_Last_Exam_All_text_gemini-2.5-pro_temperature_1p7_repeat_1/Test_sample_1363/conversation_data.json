    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"Reverse Turn\"**: This is a standard, left-turning figure found in all the listed ballroom dances.\n    *   **\"Overturn\"**: This means to rotate more than the standard amount prescribed for the figure in the dance's technical manual (e.g., turning 1/2 when the standard is 3/8).\n    *   **\"Impossible ... without disregarding the technique\"**: This is the crucial part. It asks in which dance the fundamental principles and mechanics are so rigid for the reverse turn that adding extra rotation would violate the core character and rules of the dance, not just be an advanced variation.\n\n2.  **Analyze each dance option:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz, B. English Waltz, D. Slow Foxtrot, E. Quickstep:** These four dances are known as \"swing\" dances. A core technical element in all of them is \"swing,\" which involves momentum, body rotation (CBM), and often sway and rise & fall (except for the Viennese Waltz's unique continuous rotation). In these dances, overturning figures is a common and often necessary tool for experienced dancers. It's used for \"floorcraft\" (navigating a crowded dance floor) and to create different choreographic entries and exits between figures. While there is a \"textbook\" amount of turn, adding or subtracting a little rotation is considered an acceptable variation that does not violate the fundamental techniques of swing, sway, or CBM. The flowing nature of these dances allows for such adjustments.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** The Tango has a technique that is fundamentally different from the swing dances.\n        *   **No Swing, No Sway, No Rise & Fall:** The movement is sharp, staccato, and level. Dancers move with a \"cat-like\" walk.\n        *   **Precise Footwork:** Figures are constructed with very specific foot placements and actions.\n        *   **The Tango Reverse Turn:** A key feature of many Tango reverse turns (e.g., the Open Reverse Turn, Lady Outside) is a step where the feet close together without a weight change at the end of the main turning action (e.g., Man's step 3, closing his Left Foot to his Right Foot). This \"closing\" action creates a physical and technical \"stop.\" It mechanically limits the amount of rotation possible. To turn further (to \"overturn\" the figure), the dancer would have to abandon this \"feet together\" action. Doing so is not merely an adjustment of rotation; it is a direct violation of a defining technical element of the figure and fundamentally changes its character. The crisp, staccato nature of Tango relies on this kind of precision, which makes overturning the reverse turn impossible without disregarding the technique.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile in the swing dances, overturning a reverse turn is a modification of degree, in the European Tango, the specific technique of closing the feet creates a structural limitation. Trying to force more turn breaks this structure, thus disregarding a core element of the dance's technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
