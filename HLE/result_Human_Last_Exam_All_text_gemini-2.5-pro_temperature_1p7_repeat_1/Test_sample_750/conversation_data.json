    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the equation in a standard form.**\nLet $z = x+iy$, where $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe left hand side (LHS) is:\nLHS $= z \\cdot i = (x+iy)i = xi + i^2y = -y+xi$.\n\nThe right hand side (RHS) involves complex exponentiation, $a^b = e^{b \\log a}$. This is a multi-valued function because the complex logarithm $\\log a$ is multi-valued.\n$\\log i = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSince $|i|=1$ and $\\arg(i)=\\pi/2$, we have:\n$\\log i = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\nLet's denote $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. So $\\log i = iA_k$.\n\nThe RHS is:\nRHS $= i^z = e^{z \\log i} = e^{(x+iy)iA_k} = e^{(ix-y)A_k} = e^{-yA_k} e^{ixA_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{i\\theta}=\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$:\nRHS $= e^{-yA_k}(\\cos(xA_k) + i\\sin(xA_k))$.\n\nEquating the LHS and RHS:\n$-y + xi = e^{-yA_k}(\\cos(xA_k) + i\\sin(xA_k))$.\n\n**Step 2: Equate the real and imaginary parts.**\nBy comparing the real and imaginary parts of the equation, we get a system of two equations for $x$ and $y$ for each integer value of $k$:\n1.  Real part: $-y = e^{-yA_k} \\cos(xA_k)$\n2.  Imaginary part: $x = e^{-yA_k} \\sin(xA_k)$\n\n**Step 3: Analyze special cases.**\n\n**Case A: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the system of equations becomes:\n1.  $0 = e^0 \\cos(xA_k) \\implies \\cos(xA_k) = 0$.\n2.  $x = e^0 \\sin(xA_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xA_k)$.\n\nFrom $\\cos(xA_k)=0$, we know that $xA_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nFor such values, $\\sin(xA_k) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = (-1)^n$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives $x = (-1)^n$.\n\n*   If $x=1$, then $n$ must be an even integer, say $n=2m$. The first condition becomes $1 \\cdot A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$.\n    Substituting $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, we get $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$, which means $k=m$. This is always possible by choosing an appropriate branch $k$. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n*   If $x=-1$, then $n$ must be an odd integer, say $n=2m+1$. The first condition becomes $(-1) \\cdot A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + (2m+1)\\pi = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$.\n    $-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi \\implies -2\\pi = 2(k+m)\\pi \\implies k+m=-1$. This is also always possible. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\nSo, there are two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yA_k} \\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yA_k}$.\n2.  $0 = e^{-yA_k} \\sin(0) \\implies 0=0$. This gives no information.\n\nWe need to solve the equation $-y = e^{-yA_k}$ for $y$. Let $f(y)=y+e^{-yA_k}$. We seek the roots of $f(y)=0$.\n\n*   For $k \\ge 0$, $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi > 0$. The derivative is $f'(y) = 1-A_k e^{-yA_k}$. The minimum value of $f(y)$ is at $y_0 = \\frac{\\ln(A_k)}{A_k}$, and the minimum value is $f(y_0)=\\frac{1+\\ln(A_k)}{A_k}$. Since $A_k \\ge \\pi/2 > 1/e \\approx 0.367$, we have $\\ln(A_k) > -1$, so $1+\\ln(A_k)>0$. The minimum value is positive, so there are no solutions for $y$.\n*   For $k < 0$, let $k = -m$ for an integer $m \\ge 1$. Then $A_k = A_{-m} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}-2m\\pi < 0$. Let $B_m = -A_{-m} = 2m\\pi-\\frac{\\pi}{2} > 0$. The equation is $-y = e^{yB_m}$.\n    Let $g(y) = y+e^{yB_m}$. $g'(y)=1+B_m e^{yB_m}>0$, so $g(y)$ is strictly increasing.\n    Since $\\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} g(y) = -\\infty$ and $\\lim_{y \\to \\infty} g(y) = \\infty$, there is a unique real solution $y_m$ for each $m \\ge 1$.\n    Also, $g(0)=1>0$, so the root $y_m$ must be negative.\n    The equation $-y = e^{yB_m}$ can be solved using the Lambert W function. Let $y=-u$ for $u>0$. The equation is $u=e^{-uB_m}$, which transforms to $uB_m e^{uB_m} = B_m$. The solution is $uB_m = W_0(B_m)$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n    So $u = \\frac{W_0(B_m)}{B_m}$. This gives $y_m = -u = -\\frac{W_0(B_m)}{B_m}$.\n    $B_m = (2m-\\frac{1}{2})\\pi = \\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2}$.\n    Thus, for each integer $m \\ge 1$, we have a purely imaginary solution: $z_m = -i \\frac{W_0((4m-1)\\pi/2)}{(4m-1)\\pi/2}$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze general complex solutions ($x \\ne 0, y \\ne 0$)**\nBy squaring and adding equations (1) and (2), we get:\n$(-y)^2 + x^2 = (e^{-yA_k})^2(\\cos^2(xA_k) + \\sin^2(xA_k))$\n$x^2+y^2 = e^{-2yA_k}$.\n\nDividing equation (2) by (1) (assuming $y \\ne 0, \\cos(xA_k)\\ne 0$):\n$\\frac{x}{-y} = \\tan(xA_k) \\implies y = -x \\cot(xA_k)$.\n\nSubstitute this $y$ into the previous equation:\n$x^2 + (-x\\cot(xA_k))^2 = e^{2xA_k \\cot(xA_k)}$\n$x^2(1+\\cot^2(xA_k)) = e^{2xA_k \\cot(xA_k)}$\n$x^2\\csc^2(xA_k) = e^{2xA_k \\cot(xA_k)}$\n$(\\frac{x}{\\sin(xA_k)})^2 = e^{2xA_k \\cot(xA_k)}$.\n\nLet $\\phi = xA_k$, so $x=\\phi/A_k$. The equation becomes:\n$(\\frac{\\phi/A_k}{\\sin\\phi})^2 = e^{2\\phi\\cot\\phi} \\implies A_k^2 = \\frac{\\phi^2}{\\sin^2\\phi}e^{-2\\phi\\cot\\phi}$.\nTaking the square root gives $|A_k| = \\frac{|\\phi|}{|\\sin\\phi|}e^{-\\phi\\cot\\phi}$.\n\nA detailed analysis shows that for each integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ where $k \\neq 0$, this equation has a unique solution $\\phi_k \\in (0, \\pi)$ for $|\\phi|$, which in turn defines a pair of solutions $(x_k, y_k)$ and $(-x_k, y_k)$. These solutions cannot be expressed in terms of standard elementary functions. The solutions for $k=0$ correspond to the real solutions $z=\\pm 1$ as $\\phi_0 = \\pi/2$ gives $y=0$.\n\n**Conclusion: Listing all solutions.**\n\nThe solutions to the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ can be classified into three groups:\n\n1.  **Real solutions:**\n    $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\n2.  **Purely imaginary solutions:**\n    An infinite set of solutions on the negative imaginary axis, given by\n    $z_m = -i \\frac{W_0(\\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2})}{\\frac{(4m-1)\\pi}{2}}$ for each integer $m \\ge 1$.\n    ($W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function).\n\n3.  **Other complex solutions:**\n    An infinite set of solutions which are neither real nor purely imaginary. For each integer $k \\ne 0$, there exists a unique pair of solutions $z = \\pm x_k + iy_k$. These solutions are determined by a transcendental equation involving $x_k$ and $y_k$, and do not have a simple closed-form expression.\n\nFinal summary of all found solutions:\n*   Two real solutions: $z = 1$ and $z = -1$.\n*   An infinite series of purely imaginary solutions: $z = -i \\frac{W_0((4m-1)\\pi/2)}{(4m-1)\\pi/2}$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n*   An infinite number of other complex solutions not expressible in simple closed form.\n\nSince the question asks to \"solve for all z\", and a complete description of all complex roots would require defining solutions to a transcendental equation, the most practical answer provides the solutions that can be expressed in a closed or standard form.\n\n<<<The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and $z = -i \\frac{W_0((4m-1)\\pi/2)}{(4m-1)\\pi/2}$ for any integer $m \\ge 1$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function. There exists an additional infinite set of non-real, non-purely imaginary solutions that cannot be expressed in a simple closed form.>>>"
