The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and $z = -i \frac{W_0((4m-1)\pi/2)}{(4m-1)\pi/2}$ for any integer $m \ge 1$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function. There exists an additional infinite set of non-real, non-purely imaginary solutions that cannot be expressed in a simple closed form.
