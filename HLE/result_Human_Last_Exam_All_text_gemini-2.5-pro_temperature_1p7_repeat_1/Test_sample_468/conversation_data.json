    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the common name for the genus *Perdita* and when it was coined.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject:** The question asks for the common name of the insect genus \"*Perdita* (Smith, 1853)\". This is a large genus of bees.\n\n2.  **Determine the Native Range:** To find the common name used in its \"native range\", we first need to establish where that is. The genus *Perdita* is native to North and Central America, with the highest concentration of species found in the arid and desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\n\n3.  **Find the Common Name:** The next step is to research the common name used for this genus within North America.\n    *   A review of entomological resources, including university entomology department websites (e.g., University of California, Riverside), digital databases (like BugGuide.net), and modern field guides on North American bees, consistently shows a primary common name.\n    *   This widely accepted common name is **\"fairy bees\"**. The name is a reference to their characteristically tiny size (most are less than 7mm long) and their often bright, delicate, and sometimes iridescent coloration, which gives them a fairy-like appearance.\n\n4.  **Determine When the Name Was Coined:** This is the most detailed part of the research, as common names, unlike scientific names, don't always have a clear, documented origin. However, in this specific case, the origin is well-documented.\n    *   The world's foremost expert on the genus *Perdita* was Philip Hunter Timberlake (1883-1981), an entomologist at the University of California Citrus Experiment Station. He described nearly 600 species and subspecies of *Perdita* and is credited with coining the name.\n    *   To find the year, we must locate the publication where he first proposed it. The source is Part I of his major monograph on the genus.\n    *   The specific publication is: Timberlake, P. H. (1954). *A Revisional Study of the Bees of the Genus Perdita F. Smith, with Special Reference to the Fauna of the Pacific Coast (Hymenoptera, Apoidea) Part I*. University of California Publications in Entomology, 9(6), 345â€“432.\n    *   On page 346 of this work, Timberlake writes: \"The species of *Perdita* are all small bees, some of them being the smallest of all our native bees, and because of their minute size and often bright, delicate coloring, I have been tempted to call them **'fairy bees.'**\"\n    *   Therefore, the name was officially coined in the year **1954**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of the Name:** While other general names like \"sand bees\" or \"dwarf bees\" could apply, \"fairy bees\" is the most specific and widely adopted common name for the genus *Perdita*.\n*   **Authority on the Name:** The name was not just an informal nickname that caught on; it was proposed in a formal scientific revision by the leading global authority on the genus, which gives it significant weight.\n*   **Verification of the Date:** The date is not an estimate. It is tied directly to the publication date of Timberlake's monograph where the name was first suggested in print.\n*   **Current Usage:** The name \"fairy bees\" is not archaic; it is the \"currently used\" common name, appearing in modern scientific outreach, gardening books, and naturalist guides.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   **Currently used common name:** Fairy bees\n*   **Year it was coined:** 1954\n*   **Combined and formatted:** Fairy bees, 1954\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1954>>>"
