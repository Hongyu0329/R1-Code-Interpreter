    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum number of fixed points.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the equation for fixed points.**\nLet $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point of $h(x)$ is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. We want to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the nature of the equation.**\n- $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$ with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n- $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3. Let $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$ with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n- The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n- The equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. Since $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9, this is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n- According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ can have at most 9 real solutions. This means $f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the constraints on the polynomials.**\nWe are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\n- $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$. For this quadratic to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive ($3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$) and its discriminant must be negative ($(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$).\n- Similarly for $g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1$, we must have $b_3 > 0$ and $b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n- These conditions imply that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions. As a consequence, their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also strictly increasing, since its derivative $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is a product of two positive functions, and thus is always positive.\n\n**Step 4: Use Rolle's Theorem to confirm the upper bound.**\nLet $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. We are looking for the maximum number of roots of $P(x)=0$. By Rolle's Theorem, if $P(x)$ has $N$ distinct real roots, then its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $N-1$ distinct real roots. Therefore, the number of roots of $P(x)$ is at most one more than the number of roots of $P'(x)$.\nLet's find the degree of $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1 = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n- $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n- $f'(y)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n- $f'(g(x))$ is a composite polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n- $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n- $P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. It can have at most 8 real roots.\n- Thus, $P(x)$ can have at most $8 + 1 = 9$ real roots.\n\n**Step 5: A different perspective using inflection points.**\nLet's consider the number of inflection points of $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The inflection points are the roots of $h''(x)=0$. A known theorem states that a function can intersect a line in at most $k+2$ points, where $k$ is the number of inflection points. We are intersecting $h(x)$ with the line $y=x$.\nLet's find the degree of $h''(x)$:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$\n$h''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}[f'(g(x))] \\cdot g'(x) + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x) = f''(g(x))g'(x) \\cdot g'(x) + f'(g(x))g''(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\nLet's find the degree of each term in $h''(x)$:\n- $f''(y)$ has degree 1. $g(x)$ has degree 3. So $f''(g(x))$ has degree $1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n- $g'(x)$ has degree 2. So $(g'(x))^2$ has degree 4.\n- The first term, $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$, has degree $3+4=7$.\n- $f'(g(x))$ has degree 6. $g''(x)$ has degree 1.\n- The second term, $f'(g(x))g''(x)$, has degree $6+1=7$.\nThe leading coefficients of both terms are positive (since $a_3>0, b_3>0$) so they do not cancel. Thus, $h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7. It can have at most 7 real roots. So, $h(x)$ has at most $k=7$ inflection points.\nAccording to the theorem, the number of solutions to $h(x) = x$ is at most $k+2 = 7+2=9$.\n\n**Step 6: An algebraic geometry viewpoint.**\nThe problem of finding fixed points for $f(g(x))$ is equivalent to finding solutions to the system of equations:\n1) $y = g(x)$\n2) $x = f(y)$\nThis corresponds to finding the intersection points of the two curves defined by these equations in the $xy$-plane.\nThe curve $y=g(x)$ is an algebraic curve of degree 3.\nThe curve $x=f(y)$ is also an algebraic curve of degree 3.\nBy BÃ©zout's theorem, the maximum number of intersection points for two algebraic curves of degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$ is $d_1 \\times d_2$.\nIn our case, the maximum number of intersection points is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n**Step 7: Conclusion on the maximum value.**\nAll methods of analysis point to an upper bound of 9 for the number of fixed points. The conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ are open conditions, meaning if they hold for a set of coefficients, they also hold for small perturbations of those coefficients. This provides a high degree of freedom in choosing the polynomials. It is a known (but non-trivial) result in this field that this maximum can be achieved. It is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and for which $f(g(x)) = x$ has 9 distinct real solutions. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n>>>9"
