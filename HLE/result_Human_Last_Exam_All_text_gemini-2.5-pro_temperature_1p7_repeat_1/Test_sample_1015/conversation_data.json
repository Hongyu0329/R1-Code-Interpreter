    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the terms:**\n    *   **Cambré derrière:** A ballet step meaning \"arched to the back.\" It's a bend of the upper body backwards from the waist.\n    *   **Vaganova method:** A Russian ballet technique known for its precision, strength, epaulement (the placement of the shoulders, head, and body), and focus on a stable lower body providing a base for an expressive upper body.\n    *   **Balanchine method:** An American neoclassical ballet technique developed by George Balanchine, characterized by its speed, musicality, dynamic energy, and unique aesthetic lines.\n\n2.  **Analyze the execution of a Cambré Derrière in the Vaganova Method:**\n    *   The movement initiates from the upper back, just below the shoulder blades. The feeling is of lifting the sternum up and then arching back.\n    *   A primary and non-negotiable rule is that the hips must remain perfectly square to the front. The pelvis should not shift, tilt, or rotate. This isolates the bend to the thoracic and upper lumbar spine.\n    *   The legs and pelvis act as a stable, solid foundation.\n    *   The head follows the line of the spine gracefully, looking up and back but not \"thrown\" or \"dropped.\"\n    *   The arms, often in 5th position en haut, maintain their classical shape.\n\n3.  **Analyze the execution of a Cambré Derrière in the Balanchine Method:**\n    *   The movement is often larger, faster, and more dynamic.\n    *   The most significant technical difference is the use of the hips. In the Balanchine style, the hip on the supporting leg side is often pushed forward, which allows the other hip to release back. This is sometimes referred to as \"breaking\" the hip.\n    *   This hip displacement creates a subtle spiral in the torso and allows for a much deeper and more dramatic backbend. It's no longer a pure posterior bend but incorporates a slight rotation.\n    *   This technique sacrifices the pure isolation of the Vaganova method for a greater range of motion and a different aesthetic quality.\n    *   The head is often released further back, and the arms may take on a more angular or \"broken\" line in the allongé (extension).\n\n4.  **Compare the two methods and evaluate the answer choices:**\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in the allongé (the final stretch of the arms and head), this is a subtle point and not the core mechanical difference between the two backbends.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the key differentiator. Vaganova insists on square, stable hips. Balanchine allows the hips to open or displace to achieve a deeper bend. This is a fundamental structural difference in how the movement is produced.\n    *   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine choreography is famously fast, a cambré in either technique can be performed at various speeds depending on the musicality and the exercise. Speed is a general characteristic of the Balanchine style, but the hip placement is a specific technical distinction for this step.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The difference in the degree of the backbend is a *result* of the difference in hip placement, not the cause. The Balanchine hip release *allows* for a deeper bend. The most careful point is the technical cause, not the visual effect.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** Like the arms, the head placement differs, but this is a stylistic consequence of the overall body action, which is dictated by the spine and, most importantly, the foundational hip placement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most critical and defining difference between a Vaganova cambré derrière and a Balanchine cambré derrière is the stability and placement of the hips. Vaganova's strict adherence to square hips contrasts directly with Balanchine's use of a released hip to increase the movement's depth and dynamic.\n\n<<<B>>>"
