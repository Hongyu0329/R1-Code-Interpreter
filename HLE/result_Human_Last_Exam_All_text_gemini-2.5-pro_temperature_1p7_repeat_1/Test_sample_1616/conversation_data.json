    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (or trisyllabic shortening) is a phonological rule in the history of the English language. The rule states that a tense vowel (a long vowel or a diphthong) becomes lax (a short vowel) if it is in a stressed syllable that is followed by two or more syllables. The stressed syllable where the change occurs is usually the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable.\n\n*   **Tense Vowels:** /iː/ (as in `ser**e**ne`), /eɪ/ (as in `s**a**ne`), /aɪ/ (as in `d**i**vine`), /oʊ/ (as in `pr**o**voke`), /uː/ (as in `red**u**ce`).\n*   **Lax Vowels:** /ɛ/ (as in `ser**e**nity`), /æ/ (as in `s**a**nity`), /ɪ/ (as in `d**i**vinity`), /ɒ/ or /ɑ/ (as in `pr**o**vocation`), /ʌ/ (as in `red**u**ction`).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Word\n\nLet's examine each word in the list to see if its sound development fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n1.  **serenity**\n    *   **Base Word:** `serene` (pronounced /səˈriːn/). The stressed vowel is /iː/, which is a tense vowel.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `serenity` (pronounced /səˈrɛnəti/). This word has four syllables (se-ren-i-ty). The stress is on the second syllable `-ren-`, which is followed by two unstressed syllables (`-i-ty`). The vowel has changed from the tense /iː/ to the lax /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** `serenity` is a textbook example of a word that has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n2.  **derivative**\n    *   **Base Word:** `derive` (pronounced /dɪˈraɪv/). The stressed vowel is the diphthong /aɪ/, which is a tense vowel.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `derivative` (pronounced /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/). This word has four syllables (de-riv-a-tive). The stress is on the second syllable `-riv-`, which is followed by two unstressed syllables (`-a-tive`). The vowel has changed from the tense /aɪ/ to the lax /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** `derivative` is a clear example of a word that has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n3.  **gratitude**\n    *   **Related Base Word:** While we don't say `grate-itude`, the pattern is analogous to words like `nature` -> `natural`. The historical base has a tense vowel, like the /eɪ/ in `grate` or `grateful`.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `gratitude` (pronounced /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/). This word has three syllables (grat-i-tude). The stress is on the first syllable `grat-`, which is the antepenultimate syllable (followed by two others). The vowel is /æ/, the lax counterpart to /eɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** `gratitude` fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n4.  **pleasant**\n    *   **Base Word:** `please` (pronounced /pliːz/). The stressed vowel is /iː/, a tense vowel.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `pleasant` (pronounced /ˈplɛzənt/). The vowel has laxed to /ɛ/.\n    *   **Careful Point:** However, `pleasant` has only two syllables. The rule is called *tri*syllabic laxing because the change is triggered by having two following syllables. Since `pleasant` is disyllabic, it has not undergone trisyllabic laxing, but a different kind of vowel shortening.\n\n5.  **southern**\n    *   **Base Word:** `south` (pronounced /saʊθ/). The vowel is the diphthong /aʊ/, a tense vowel.\n    *   **Derived Word:** `southern` (pronounced /ˈsʌðərn/). The vowel has changed to the lax /ʌ/.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Like `pleasant`, `southern` has only two syllables. Therefore, while it shows vowel shortening, it has not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing due to not meeting the syllable count requirement.\n\n6.  **shadow**\n    *   **Related Word:** `shade` (pronounced /ʃeɪd/). The vowel is /eɪ/, a tense vowel.\n    *   **Word in Question:** `shadow` (pronounced /ˈʃædoʊ/). The vowel is /æ/, a lax vowel.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This word has only two syllables, so it cannot have undergone *tri*syllabic laxing. Furthermore, looking at its history, `shadow` is not derived from `shade` by adding a suffix. Both words come from Old English (`sceadwe` and `scead`, respectively). `shadow` did not \"develop\" from `shade` in a way that would trigger a sound change. The vowel alternation is an artifact of their related but separate origins.\n\n### Step 3: Compare and Conclude\n\n*   `serenity`, `derivative`, and `gratitude` are all clear instances where trisyllabic laxing has occurred.\n*   `pleasant` and `southern` both show vowel laxing but in disyllabic (two-syllable) words, so this is not trisyllabic laxing.\n*   `shadow` is also a disyllabic word and therefore has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\nThe question asks for the one word that has *not* undergone the process. Technically, `pleasant`, `southern`, and `shadow` all fit this description. However, the question seeks the best answer. `pleasant` and `southern` still show a sound development where adding a suffix (`-ant`, `-ern`) to a base (`please`, `south`) causes vowel shortening. `shadow`, on the other hand, was not formed by adding a suffix to `shade`. Its disyllabic form is original. Therefore, it is the most distinct example of a word whose modern vowel does not result from this specific kind of morphologically triggered sound change.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
