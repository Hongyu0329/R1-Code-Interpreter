    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Terms\n\n*   **$u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$**: This is the quantized universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C}$, also known as the quantum group of type $A_1$. It is an algebra generated by elements $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ subject to certain relations.\n*   **$q$ a primitive third root of unity**: This is a crucial condition. We can take $q = e^{2\\pi i / 3}$. When $q$ is a root of unity, the representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is fundamentally different from the classical case (where $q=1$) or the generic case (where $q$ is not a root of unity). Let $l$ be the smallest positive integer such that $q^l=1$. Here $l=3$.\n*   **Finite-dimensional representations**: We are considering modules over the algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ which are finite-dimensional as vector spaces over $\\mathbb{C}$.\n*   **Irreducible vs. Indecomposable**:\n    *   An **irreducible** representation (or simple module) is a non-zero representation that has no proper non-zero subrepresentations.\n    *   An **indecomposable** representation is a non-zero representation that cannot be written as a direct sum of two non-zero subrepresentations.\n*   **The Category C**: The problem defines $C$ as the category whose objects are the indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $q=e^{2\\pi i / 3}$. We are interested in isomorphism classes of these objects.\n*   **The Question**: \"What percentage of the objects of C are irreducible?\" This asks for the ratio:\n    (Number of irreducible isomorphism classes) / (Number of indecomposable isomorphism classes)\n\n### Step 2: Careful Points and Analysis of the Category C\n\nA key feature when $q$ is a root of unity is that the category of finite-dimensional representations is **not semisimple**. This means that not every representation is a direct sum of irreducible ones. Consequently, there exist representations that are indecomposable but not irreducible. This is why the question is non-trivial.\n\nThe main difficulty lies in counting the objects. The category $C$ contains infinitely many non-isomorphic objects. This is because the representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $l \\geq 3$ is of **wild representation type**. \"Wild\" means that a classification of all indecomposable modules would solve notoriously difficult problems in linear algebra (like classifying pairs of matrices up to simultaneous conjugation). In particular, it implies there are continuous families of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.\n\nSince there are infinitely many indecomposable objects, we need to carefully interpret what \"percentage\" means. A literal interpretation would be the ratio of cardinalities of the sets of isomorphism classes.\n\n*   **Set of Irreducible objects**: The irreducible representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ for $l=3$ are:\n    1.  A discrete set of representations $L(m)$ for $m=0, 1, 2, ...$. These are highest weight modules.\n    2.  A continuous family of irreducible modules of dimension $l=3$, called semi-cyclic representations. These are parameterized by a 2-dimensional complex variety.\n    Therefore, the set of irreducible representations is infinite.\n\n*   **Set of Indecomposable objects**: As stated, this set is also infinite and \"larger\" in a sense, as it contains all the irreducible modules plus infinitely many more indecomposable-but-not-irreducible modules.\n\nA literal computation of (infinity / infinity) is ill-defined. This suggests that the question is either flawed or, more likely, requires a standard, physically or mathematically motivated interpretation to make it well-posed. There are two main ways to interpret this:\n\n**Interpretation A:** The question refers to the **small quantum group**.\nA major part of the theory concerns representations where certain central elements ($E^l, F^l, K^l$) act as zero. This defines the \"small quantum group\", denoted $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. For $q = e^{2\\pi i/3}$, this algebra is isomorphic to the 18-dimensional Taft algebra $T_3$. Even for this algebra, the representation type is wild for $l=3$, meaning there are infinitely many indecomposable modules. However, the number of *irreducible* modules for the small quantum group is finite. They are the modules $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(l-1)$, which in our case are $L(0), L(1), L(2)$. So we have 3 irreducibles and infinitely many indecomposables. The percentage would be $3 / \\infty = 0\\%$. This is a possible answer, but it feels too simplistic and depends on a technical point (wildness) that might not be the intended focus.\n\n**Interpretation B:** The question is not about *all* indecomposables, but about a specific, fundamentally important, and *finite* subset of them: the **projective indecomposable modules**.\nIn representation theory, for each simple module $S_i$, there is a unique indecomposable projective module $P_i$ (its projective cover). The set of these projective indecomposables is in bijection with the set of simple modules. This interpretation reduces the problem to a finite, well-defined count. This is a very common approach in modular representation theory to analyze a category.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis under Interpretation B\n\nLet's assume the question implicitly refers to the **projective indecomposable modules** of the **small quantum group** $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ (with $q=e^{2\\pi i/3}$). This is the most likely interpretation that leads to a non-trivial, canonical answer.\n\n1.  **Count the Simple Modules**: For the small quantum group with $l=3$, the simple (irreducible) modules are highest weight modules $L(m)$ for $m=0, 1, \\dots, l-1=2$.\n    *   $L(0)$: dimension 1 (the trivial module)\n    *   $L(1)$: dimension 2\n    *   $L(2)$: dimension 3\n    So, there are **3** non-isomorphic simple modules.\n\n2.  **Count the Projective Indecomposable Modules**: The number of non-isomorphic projective indecomposable modules is equal to the number of non-isomorphic simple modules.\n    *   $P(L(0))$: The projective cover of $L(0)$.\n    *   $P(L(1))$: The projective cover of $L(1)$.\n    *   $P(L(2))$: The projective cover of $L(2)$.\n    So, there are **3** non-isomorphic projective indecomposable modules.\n\n3.  **Identify which Projective Indecomposables are Irreducible**: A projective indecomposable module $P(S)$ is itself irreducible (simple) if and only if $P(S) = S$. This occurs precisely when the simple module $S$ constitutes a \"block\" of the category by itself. For $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, this happens for simple modules $L(m)$ whose highest weights are on the \"walls\" of the fundamental alcove of the affine Weyl group.\n\n    *   The structure of blocks for $l=3$ is well-known:\n        *   The simple modules $L(0)$ and $L(1)$ are \"linked\" and belong to the same block, called the principal block. Because this block is not simple, their projective covers $P(L(0))$ and $P(L(1))$ must be larger than $L(0)$ and $L(1)$ respectively, and are therefore **not irreducible**. (In fact, both have dimension 6).\n        *   The simple module $L(2)$ (which corresponds to $m=l-1$) lies on a wall of the fundamental alcove. It forms a block by itself. Therefore, it is a projective module. This means $P(L(2)) = L(2)$. So, $P(L(2))$ **is irreducible**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Percentage**:\n    *   Total number of projective indecomposable modules (isomorphism classes): 3\n    *   Number of these that are irreducible: 1 (namely $L(2)$)\n    *   The percentage is $(1/3) \\times 100\\%$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe most plausible interpretation of the question, leading to a well-defined and non-trivial answer, is to consider the percentage of projective indecomposable modules (for the small quantum group) that are irreducible. Based on this interpretation, 1 out of the 3 such modules is irreducible.\n\nThe fraction is $1/3$. The percentage is $33.33...\\%$. The question asks for a number, which can be the fraction.\n\n$1/3$"
