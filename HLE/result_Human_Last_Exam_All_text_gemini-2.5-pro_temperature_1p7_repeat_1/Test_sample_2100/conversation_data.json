    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\nFirst, let's break down the information provided in the question into key points.\n\n*   **Source:** The quotes are from the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. This suggests the man in question is a figure of significance in Russian culture or history.\n*   **Description:** The man is called \"a joy-discovering sailor.\" This metaphorical description points to an explorer, navigator, or someone associated with sea voyages and discovery. The word \"joy\" suggests his discoveries were seen as positive and significant.\n*   **Mystery:** Voznesensky asks, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" This is a crucial clue. It tells us that for a long time, the location of this man's burial site was completely unknown. He was, in a sense, lost to history.\n*   **Timeline:** \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" This is the most specific and helpful clue. It means that the man's lost grave was finally discovered or identified during this period.\n\n**Step 2: List the Careful Points**\nBased on the deconstruction, we must be careful to look for a figure who meets all of the following criteria:\n\n1.  A \"sailor\" or explorer associated with Russia.\n2.  A person celebrated by a major Russian poet like Voznesensky.\n3.  Someone whose final resting place was unknown for centuries.\n4.  Someone whose grave was discovered in the specific time frame of the late 1980s/early 1990s (expeditions planned in the late 80s often had their discoveries at the turn of the decade).\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer**\nLet's synthesize these points to identify the man.\n\n1.  We need to think of famous explorers in Russian history whose fates were mysterious.\n2.  The description \"sailor\" leads us to naval explorers. A primary candidate is Vitus Bering, a Danish navigator who served in the Russian navy and led two major expeditions to explore the far eastern reaches of Siberia and the coast of North America.\n3.  Let's check if Bering fits the \"lost grave\" clue. Vitus Bering died of scurvy in 1741 after being shipwrecked on an uninhabited island, which was later named Bering Island in his honor. He and other crew members were buried there in makeshift graves. For over 250 years, the exact location of their graves was lost.\n4.  Now, let's check the timeline. In August 1991 (a result of efforts and expeditions that began in the late 1980s), a Russian-Danish archaeological expedition successfully located the graves of Bering and five of his men. This event perfectly matches the clue that the \"answer\" to the location of his grave \"emerged in the late 1980s.\"\n5.  Finally, we check the connection to Andrei Voznesensky. The poet wrote a famous poem titled \"Сага\" (\"Saga\") dedicated to Vitus Bering, which reflects on his heroic but tragic final voyage and the mystery of his grave. The quotes in the question are direct references to the themes and language of this poem.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Answer**\nAll the clues point conclusively to one person. The \"joy-discovering sailor\" whose lost grave was found in the late 1980s/early 1990s is the famous explorer Vitus Bering. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Bering>>>"
