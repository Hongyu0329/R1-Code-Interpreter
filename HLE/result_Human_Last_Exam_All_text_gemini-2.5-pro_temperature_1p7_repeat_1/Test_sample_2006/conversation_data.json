    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing the Question**\n\nThe core of the problem lies in its title: \"The Bays\". This is a pun on \"The B's\". The riddle is asking us to identify a list of items that are referred to as \"B\". The plural form \"Bays\" indicates that there will be multiple answers.\n\n**Step 2: Decoding the Haiku for Clues**\n\nThe haiku provides the necessary information to identify which \"B's\" are the answer. Each line of the haiku yields a number. The most common group of items referred to as \"B's\" that are also numbered is the B-vitamin complex.\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The key word here is \"August\".\n    *   **Analysis:** August is the 8th month of the year. This gives us the number 8. In the context of \"The B's\", this points to Vitamin B8.\n    *   **Clue:** B8 (Inositol).\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This line has two parts: a calculation and a hint on how to process it.\n    *   **Analysis:** \"Twice fifteen\" is a simple calculation: 2 * 15 = 30. The phrase \"brings winds of change\" suggests we must \"change\" this number. A common technique in riddles is to change a number by summing its digits.\n    *   **Calculation:** 3 + 0 = 3.\n    *   **Clue:** B3 (Niacin).\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The clue is explicitly stated.\n    *   **Analysis:** The line clearly provides the number \"one\". This gives us the number 1.\n    *   **Clue:** B1 (Thiamine).\n\n**Step 3: Synthesizing the Answer**\n\nWe have successfully identified three B-vitamins from the haiku:\n*   B1: Thiamine\n*   B3: Niacin\n*   B8: Inositol\n\n**Step 4: Formatting the Final Answer**\n\nThe prompt requires the final answer to be presented in alphabetical order.\n\n1.  Inositol\n2.  Niacin\n3.  Thiamine\n\nListing these names in alphabetical order gives us the final solution.\n\n<<<Inositol, Niacin, Thiamine>>>"
