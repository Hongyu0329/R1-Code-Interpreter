    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a solution for a system of three coupled equations involving three functions F, G, and H, and three variables (x, y, z) from potentially different sets X, Y, and Z. To find the conditions for the existence of such a point, we typically rely on extensions of classical fixed point theorems, most commonly the Banach Contraction Principle.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to derive a set of sufficient conditions.\n\n### Analysis of the Question and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Function Signatures and Typo**: The question specifies the functions `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`.\n    *   There appears to be a typo, as the function `G` is defined twice with different signatures.\n    *   Given the problem context of an \"FGH-tripled fixed point,\" it is a reasonable and standard interpretation to assume the third function is `H`.\n    *   Therefore, we will analyze the system with the functions:\n        *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n        *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n        *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n\n2.  **Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**: An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet of points `(x, y, z)` with `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfy the following system of equations, based directly on the function signatures:\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    *   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n    Note how the arguments for each function are chosen from the triplet `(x, y, z)` to match the required domain. For `G`, which requires two inputs from `Y`, the same `y` is used for both slots.\n\n3.  **Required Mathematical Framework**: The question asks for \"conditions\" without specifying a mathematical context for the sets X, Y, and Z. To provide meaningful conditions for the existence (and uniqueness) of a fixed point, we must endow these sets with additional structure. The most common and powerful framework for this type of problem is that of **complete metric spaces**. This allows us to use the Banach Fixed Point Theorem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of Conditions\n\nThe strategy is to combine the three functions into a single operator on the product space `X × Y × Z` and then find conditions that make this operator a contraction mapping.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the Metric Space**\n*   Assume `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are **complete metric spaces**. Completeness is essential because it guarantees that every Cauchy sequence converges to a point within the space.\n*   Define the product space `W = X × Y × Z`.\n*   Equip `W` with a metric. A convenient choice is the sum metric. For any two points `w₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `w₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `W`, the distance `d_W` is:\n    `d_W(w₁, w₂) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n*   It is a standard theorem that if `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces, then their product space `(W, d_W)` is also a complete metric space.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Combined Operator**\n*   We can represent the system of three equations using a single operator `T: W → W` defined as:\n    `T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x) )`\n*   A point `(x, y, z)` is an FGH-tripled fixed point if and only if it is a fixed point of `T`, i.e., `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`.\n\n**Step 3: Establish the Contraction Condition for the Operator**\n*   According to the Banach Fixed Point Theorem, if `(W, d_W)` is a complete metric space and `T: W → W` is a **contraction mapping**, then `T` has a unique fixed point.\n*   A mapping `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` (called the contraction constant) such that for all `w₁, w₂ ∈ W`:\n    `d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d_W(w₁, w₂)`\n\n**Step 4: Derive Conditions on F, G, and H**\nWe now derive conditions on the individual functions F, G, and H that will ensure `T` is a contraction. Let's expand the contraction inequality from Step 3:\n`d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁,x₂) + d_Y(y₁,y₂) + d_Z(z₁,z₂))`\n\nThis inequality will hold if we impose the following Lipschitz-type conditions on F, G, and H:\n\n1.  **For F**: Assume there exist non-negative constants `α₁, α₂, α₃` such that:\n    `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ α₁d_X(x₁,x₂) + α₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + α₃d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\n2.  **For G**: Assume there exist non-negative constants `β₁, β₂` such that:\n    `d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ β₁d_Y(y₁,y₂) + β₂d_X(x₁,x₂)`\n    (Note that `G(y,x,y)` does not depend on `z`).\n\n3.  **For H**: Assume there exist non-negative constants `γ₁, γ₂, γ₃` such that:\n    `d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ γ₁d_Z(z₁,z₂) + γ₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + γ₃d_X(x₁,x₂)`\n\nNow, sum these three inequalities:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ (α₁+β₂+γ₃)d_X(x₁,x₂) + (α₂+β₁+γ₂)d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (α₃+γ₁)d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nTo fit this into the form `≤ k * (d_X + d_Y + d_Z)`, we can let `k` be the maximum of the coefficients:\nLet `k = max(α₁ + β₂ + γ₃,  α₂ + β₁ + γ₂,  α₃ + γ₁)`\nThen `d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d_X(x₁,x₂) + k * d_Y(y₁,y₂) + k * d_Z(z₁,z₂) = k * d_W(w₁, w₂)`.\n\nFor `T` to be a contraction, we must have `k < 1`.\n\n### Final Conditions for an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\nBased on the analysis above, a set of sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point is as follows:\n\n1.  **Space Condition**: The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces with metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`, respectively.\n\n2.  **Function Contractivity Condition**: There exist non-negative constants (`α₁`, `α₂`, `α₃`, `β₁`, `β₂`, `γ₁`, `γ₂`, `γ₃`) such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, and `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following inequalities hold:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ α₁d_X(x₁,x₂) + α₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + α₃d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ β₁d_Y(y₁,y₂) + β₂d_X(x₁,x₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ γ₁d_Z(z₁,z₂) + γ₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + γ₃d_X(x₁,x₂)`\n\n3.  **Global Contraction Condition**: The sum of the constants must satisfy the following inequality:\n    *   `max(α₁ + β₂ + γ₃, α₂ + β₁ + γ₂, α₃ + γ₁) < 1`\n\nIf these three conditions are met, then there exists a unique triplet `(x*, y*, z*) ∈ X × Y × Z` that is an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n<<<A set of sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` for the functions `F:X×Y×Z→X`, `G:Y×X×Y→Y`, and `H:Z×Y×X→Z` are:\n1.  `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n2.  There exist non-negative constants `αᵢ, βᵢ, γᵢ` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the functions satisfy the following Lipschitz-type inequalities:\n    a. `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) ≤ α₁d_X(x₁,x₂) + α₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + α₃d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n    b. `d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) ≤ β₁d_Y(y₁,y₂) + β₂d_X(x₁,x₂)`\n    c. `d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ γ₁d_Z(z₁,z₂) + γ₂d_Y(y₁,y₂) + γ₃d_X(x₁,x₂)`\n3.  These constants satisfy the global contraction condition: `max(α₁ + β₂ + γ₃, α₂ + β₁ + γ₂, α₃ + γ₁) < 1`.>>>"
