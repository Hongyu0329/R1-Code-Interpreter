    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:**\n    *   **The Subject:** A Russian translation of a literary work (described as an \"essay\").\n    *   **The Content:** A description of the \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\"\n    *   **The Clue:** The surname of an *English* poet appears in this description.\n    *   **The Goal:** To name this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Initial Inferences and Key Points to Consider:**\n    *   The mention of \"Vienna's wide boulevards\" strongly points to the famous Ringstraße (Ring Road), which is known for its grand, curved, horseshoe-like shape.\n    *   The crucial information is that the poet's name appears *in the Russian translation*, not necessarily in the original work. This suggests a creative choice or a specific allusion made by the translator for the Russian-speaking audience.\n    *   The original work is likely by a non-Russian author, and the question uses \"essay\" in a broader sense that could include a short story.\n    *   The poet must be English, which is a specific constraint.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Source Texts:**\n    *   The original text is the short story **\"From the Cabby's Seat\"** by the American writer **O. Henry** (William Sydney Porter).\n    *   In the story, the narrator, a New York cab driver, muses about other cities and says: \"The boulevards of Vienna, I am told, are shaped like a horseshoe.\"\n    *   The Russian translation of this story was done by the translator **Evgenia Kalashnikova**.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Translation Choice:**\n    *   A direct, literal translation of \"shaped like a horseshoe\" into Russian would be straightforward (\"изогнуты как подкова\").\n    *   However, to make the text more literary and resonant for an educated Russian reader, the translator, Kalashnikova, replaced the simple comparison with a cultural allusion.\n    *   Her translated sentence reads: \"Говорят, венские бульвары выгнуты подковой, как у **Браунинга**.\"\n    *   This translates back to English as: \"They say the Vienna boulevards are curved in a horseshoe, like **Browning's**.\"\n\n5.  **Connecting the Allusion to the Poet:**\n    *   The surname introduced by the translator is **Browning**, referring to the renowned Victorian English poet, Robert Browning.\n    *   The reason for this specific allusion is multifaceted and clever:\n        *   **The Horseshoe Connection:** Robert Browning wrote the famous poem \"How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix,\" which is celebrated for its driving, galloping rhythm that powerfully evokes a frantic horseback ride. The image of a horse and, by extension, its horseshoes, is strongly associated with the poem.\n        *   **The \"Ring\" Connection (a deeper pun):** The Viennese boulevard is the **Ring**straße. Robert Browning's longest and most famous work is his epic poem \"**The Ring** and the Book.\" The translator's choice creates a sophisticated pun, connecting Vienna's \"Ring\" road with the English poet's great \"Ring\" poem.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The American writer O. Henry wrote that Vienna's boulevards are shaped like a horseshoe. In the Russian translation, to add a literary flourish, the translator replaced the simple comparison with an allusion to the English poet Robert Browning, whose work connects to both horseshoes and \"rings.\"\n\n<<<Browning>>>"
