    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the user's query:** The question asks for a specific \"Hollywood feature film\" from a \"major film studio\" that contains a very particular scene. The key elements of the scene are:\n    *   A character who is a \"teenager.\"\n    *   The teenager is riding a \"pink bike.\"\n    *   The teenager \"pedals directly toward an oncoming car.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the most distinctive clues:** The combination of a \"pink bike\" and the act of riding \"toward an oncoming car\" (a game of chicken) is a highly memorable and specific cinematic moment. This makes it easier to pinpoint the film.\n\n3.  **Initial Search and Film Identification:** These specific actions point directly to a famous scene in the 1984 film **Footloose**.\n\n4.  **Verify the identified film against all criteria:**\n    *   **Is it a Hollywood feature film?** Yes, *Footloose* (1984) is a classic American Hollywood movie.\n    *   **Was it produced by a major film studio?** Yes, it was produced and distributed by **Paramount Pictures**, which is a major Hollywood studio.\n    *   **Does a teenager perform the action?** Yes, the character is **Ariel Moore**, played by Lori Singer. Ariel is a high school student and therefore a teenager.\n    *   **Does she ride a pink bike?** Yes, Ariel is shown riding a distinctive pink bicycle in the film.\n    *   **Does she pedal directly toward an oncoming car?** Yes. In a key scene, Ariel challenges her aggressive boyfriend, Chuck Cranston, by riding her pink bike head-on toward his oncoming truck. She swerves away at the very last second.\n\n5.  **Consider other possibilities:** While other films feature teenagers and bikes (e.g., *E.T.*, *The Goonies*, *Now and Then*), none match the exact combination of a *pink* bike being ridden directly into the path of an oncoming vehicle in a game of chicken. The 2011 remake of *Footloose* also features this scene, and it was also produced by Paramount Pictures. However, the 1984 original is the more iconic and widely recognized film containing this specific sequence. Both films fit the criteria, but the 1984 version is the definitive answer.\n\n**Conclusion:** The film that perfectly matches all the details described in the question is the 1984 classic *Footloose*.\n\n<<<Footloose>>>"
