    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the number of \"power subgroups\" in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n*   **Power Subgroup**: A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it can be generated by a single element of $G$. In other words, a power subgroup is a **cyclic subgroup**.\n*   **Semidihedral Group**: The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$, for $n \\ge 4$.\n*   **Size 512**: The size (order) of the group is 512. We have $2^n = 512$, which implies $2^n = 2^9$, so $n=9$.\n\nThe group in question is $SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}$. Its presentation is:\n$G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n(since $2^{9-1}=256$ and $2^{9-2}-1 = 128-1=127$).\nThe elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i$ or $sr^i$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 255\\}$.\n\nOur goal is to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the cyclic subgroups**\nWe can partition the cyclic subgroups of $G$ into two categories:\n1.  Cyclic subgroups that are contained within the subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n2.  Cyclic subgroups that are not contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$. These must be generated by elements of the form $sr^i$.\n\n**Step 3: Count cyclic subgroups within $\\langle r \\rangle$**\nThe subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle = \\{1, r, r^2, \\dots, r^{255}\\}$ is a cyclic group of order $2^{n-1} = 2^8 = 256$.\nA fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that a cyclic group of order $m$ has exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $m$.\nThe order of $\\langle r \\rangle$ is $256=2^8$. The divisors of $2^8$ are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8$.\nThere are $8+1=9$ divisors. In general, for $SD_{2^n}$, there are $n$ such subgroups.\nThus, there are **9** cyclic subgroups contained in $\\langle r \\rangle$. These are subgroups of order 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256.\n\n**Step 4: Count cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form $sr^i$**\nFirst, we need to determine the order of an element $g = sr^i$. Let's compute $g^2$:\n$g^2 = (sr^i)(sr^i) = s(r^i s)r^i$.\nFrom the relation $srs = r^k$ with $k=2^{n-2}-1$, we can deduce $s r^i s = (srs)^i = (r^k)^i = r^{ik}$.\nSo, $g^2 = s(sr^{-ik})r^i = s^2 r^{-ik} r^i = r^{i(1-k)}$.\nThe relation can be written as $srs^{-1}=r^k$. So $sr^is^{-1}=r^{ik}$. Thus $sr^i=r^{ik}s$.\n$g^2 = (sr^i)(sr^i) = (r^{ik}s)(r^{ik}s) = r^{ik} s r^{ik} s = r^{ik} (s r^{ik} s) = r^{ik} r^{i^2k^2} $. This seems too complex. Let's use the other approach.\n$g^2 = sr^i sr^i = s (r^i s r^{-i}) r^{2i}$. This is also not helpful.\nLet's go back to $sr^is = r^{ik}$. So $sr^i=r^{ik}s$.\n$(sr^i)^2 = sr^i(sr^i) = (r^{ik}s)sr^i = r^{ik}s^2r^i = r^{ik}r^i=r^{i(k+1)}$.\nHere, $k=2^{n-2}-1$, so $k+1=2^{n-2}$.\nTherefore, $(sr^i)^2 = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}}$.\nLet's find the order of $sr^i$. We know $(sr^i)^4 = ((sr^i)^2)^2 = (r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}})^2 = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-1}}$.\nSince $o(r)=2^{n-1}=256$, $r^{2^{n-1}}=1$. So $(sr^i)^4=1$. The order of $sr^i$ must divide 4.\n\n*   **Case 1: $i$ is even.** Let $i=2j$.\n    $(sr^{2j})^2 = r^{2j \\cdot 2^{n-2}} = r^{j \\cdot 2^{n-1}} = (r^{2^{n-1}})^j = 1^j = 1$.\n    So, if $i$ is even, $sr^i$ has order 2.\n    How many such elements are there? $i \\in \\{0, 2, 4, \\dots, 254\\}$. The number of such values is $254/2 + 1 = 128$.\n    This corresponds to $2^{n-2}$ elements. For $n=9$, this is $2^7=128$.\n    Each element generates a unique subgroup of order 2: $\\{1, sr^i\\}$. These subgroups are distinct from each other and from the order-2 subgroup $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ found in Step 3.\n    So, there are **128** cyclic subgroups of order 2 of this type.\n\n*   **Case 2: $i$ is odd.**\n    $(sr^i)^2 = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}} = r^{i \\cdot 128}$. Since $i$ is odd, $i \\cdot 128$ is not a multiple of 256. Thus $(sr^i)^2 \\neq 1$.\n    As $(sr^i)^4 = 1$, the order of $sr^i$ must be 4.\n    How many such elements are there? $i \\in \\{1, 3, 5, \\dots, 255\\}$. There are 128 odd numbers in this range ($2^{n-2}$ elements).\n    Now we must count how many distinct subgroups these elements generate. A cyclic group of order 4, $\\langle g \\rangle$, has two generators: $g$ and $g^3$. So we check when $\\langle sr^i \\rangle = \\langle sr^j \\rangle$. This holds if $sr^j = sr^i$ (i.e., $j=i$) or if $sr^j = (sr^i)^3$.\n    $(sr^i)^3 = (sr^i)^2(sr^i) = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}} (sr^i)$.\n    The element $r^{2^{n-2}}$ is central in $SD_{2^n}$ (its order is 2).\n    Since $i$ is odd, $i=2j+1$, so $(sr^i)^2 = r^{(2j+1)2^{n-2}} = r^{j \\cdot 2^{n-1}}r^{2^{n-2}} = r^{2^{n-2}}$.\n    So $(sr^i)^3 = r^{2^{n-2}} sr^i = s r^{2^{n-2}} r^i = sr^{i+2^{n-2}}$.\n    Thus, $\\langle sr^i \\rangle = \\langle sr^{i+2^{n-2}} \\rangle$. This means the elements come in pairs that generate the same subgroup.\n    The number of distinct subgroups is half the number of elements: $128 / 2 = 64$.\n    This corresponds to $2^{n-2}/2 = 2^{n-3}$ subgroups. For $n=9$, this is $2^6=64$.\n    These 64 subgroups of order 4 are distinct from the order-4 subgroup $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$ found in Step 3.\n    So there are **64** cyclic subgroups of order 4 of this type.\n\n**Step 5: Final calculation**\nWe sum the number of subgroups from each category:\n1.  Cyclic subgroups in $\\langle r \\rangle$: 9\n2.  Cyclic subgroups of order 2 generated by $sr^i$: 128\n3.  Cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by $sr^i$: 64\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\nGeneral Formula: For $SD_{2^n}$, the number of cyclic subgroups is $n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}$.\nFor $n=9$, this is $9 + 2^{9-2} + 2^{9-3} = 9 + 2^7 + 2^6 = 9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\nThe final answer is 201.\n\n<<<201>>>"
