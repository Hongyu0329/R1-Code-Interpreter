    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Scope of the Second Great War:**\n    The Second Great War refers to the galaxy-wide conflict depicted throughout the *StarCraft II* trilogy. It begins with the initial Zerg attacks in *Wings of Liberty* and concludes with the final defeat of the primary antagonist, Amon, in the epilogue of *Legacy of the Void*.\n\n2.  **Identify the Start Date:**\n    According to the official StarCraft lore and timelines, the war begins with the renewed Zerg Swarm invasion of the Dominion, which marks the start of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. This event takes place in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Identify the End Date:**\n    The war ends with the final defeat of the dark god Amon and his forces. This happens in the *Into the Void* epilogue campaign, which follows the main story of *Legacy of the Void*. The canonical timeline places these concluding events in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Duration:**\n    The war starts in the year 2504 and ends in the year 2506. This means the conflict spans across the entirety of the year 2505, as well as portions of 2504 and 2506.\n    *   **Start:** Sometime in 2504\n    *   **End:** Sometime in 2506\n    This results in a duration that is greater than 2 full years, but less than 3 full years. For example, if the war started in March 2504 and ended in May 2506, the total duration would be 2 years and 2 months.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Rule:**\n    The question specifically asks for the duration in years, **rounded up** to the nearest whole year.\n    Since the calculated duration is a value greater than 2 but less than 3 (e.g., approximately 2.2 - 2.5 years), rounding this value *up* results in 3.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   **Start Year:** 2504\n*   **End Year:** 2506\n*   **Elapsed Time:** The conflict spans across parts of three calendar years, making the duration greater than 2 years.\n*   **Rounding:** Rounding a value like \"2-point-something\" years *up* to the nearest whole year yields 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
