    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the product of the reaction between (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide. This is a classic example of an E2 elimination reaction on a substituted cyclohexane ring.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The stereochemistry (1S,2R) indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are *cis* to each other.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reactive Conformation:**\n    *   **E2 Requirement:** The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and the beta-proton (a proton on an adjacent carbon) must be in an *anti-periplanar* conformation. In a cyclohexane chair, this means they must both be in **axial** positions, one pointing \"up\" and the other \"down\".\n    *   **Chair Conformations:** As a *cis*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, the molecule exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations: one with (axial Br, equatorial CH₃) and the other with (equatorial Br, axial CH₃).\n        *   **Conformation A:** Bromine is axial, and the methyl group is equatorial.\n        *   **Conformation B:** Bromine is equatorial, and the methyl group is axial.\n    *   **Reactivity:** The E2 reaction can **only** proceed from Conformation A, where the leaving group (Br) is axial. Conformation B, with an equatorial Br, cannot undergo this reaction.\n    *   **Stability:** (Careful Point) The methyl group (A-value ≈ 1.7 kcal/mol) is sterically bulkier than the bromine atom (A-value ≈ 0.5 kcal/mol). Therefore, the conformer that places the larger methyl group in the more stable equatorial position (Conformation A) is the major conformer at equilibrium. This means the reaction can proceed readily from the most populated conformation.\n\n3.  **Identify Available Beta-Protons and Possible Products (Regiochemistry):**\n    *   In the reactive conformer (Conformation A with axial Br), we look for axial beta-protons. The alpha-carbon is C1 (with Br). The beta-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **Pathway 1 (Zaitsev):** On C2, there is an axial beta-proton. If the base abstracts this proton, the double bond forms between C1 and C2. The product is **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is a trisubstituted alkene, which is the more thermodynamically stable product (the Zaitsev product).\n    *   **Pathway 2 (Hofmann):** On C6, there is also an axial beta-proton. If the base abstracts this proton, the double bond forms between C1 and C6. The product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is a disubstituted alkene, which is the less thermodynamically stable product (the Hofmann product).\n\n4.  **Determine the Major Product:**\n    *   **Hofmann's Rule:** The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann products depends on the base. Small, unhindered bases (like ethoxide) favor the more stable Zaitsev product. However, large, **bulky bases** like potassium tert-butoxide are sterically hindered.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The bulky tert-butoxide ion has difficulty approaching the more sterically crowded beta-proton on C2 (which is shielded by the adjacent equatorial methyl group). It can more easily access the less hindered beta-proton on C6.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Due to the use of a bulky base, the reaction will preferentially follow the Hofmann pathway, abstracting the proton from C6. This makes the less substituted alkene the major product.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\n\n*   The reaction is an E2 elimination.\n*   The reaction must proceed from the conformer with an axial bromine atom.\n*   There are two possible pathways, leading to the Zaitsev (1-methylcyclohexene) or Hofmann (3-methylcyclohexene) product.\n*   The bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide) favors the formation of the Hofmann product by abstracting the less sterically hindered proton.\n*   The major product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
