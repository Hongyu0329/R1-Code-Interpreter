    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, where $T$ is Thompson's group T.\n\n**Step 1: Define the problem**\nWe want to compute $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, where $T$ is Thompson's group T, and $H_b^n(G; \\mathbb{R})$ denotes the n-th bounded cohomology group of a group G with trivial real coefficients.\n\n**Step 2: Recall properties of Thompson's Group T**\nThompson's group T is the group of orientation-preserving piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of the circle $S^1 = \\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$ whose breakpoints are in the dyadic rationals and whose slopes are integer powers of 2. Key properties of T for this problem are:\n1.  T is a non-amenable group.\n2.  T acts on the circle $S^1$.\n3.  T is a non-discrete subgroup of the group of all orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle, $Homeo_+(S^1)$ (with the compact-open topology).\n4.  T contains a non-abelian free subgroup $F_2$.\n5.  T is a simple group, which implies its abelianization is trivial, so $H_1(T; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and consequently $H^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\text{Hom}(H_1(T;\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Introduce the Künneth map for bounded cohomology**\nFor ordinary cohomology, the Künneth formula provides an isomorphism for the cohomology of a product. For bounded cohomology, such a formula does not hold in general. However, there is a well-defined cross product map:\n$$ \\times_b: \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) \\to H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) $$\nA crucial result by Bucher, Burger, and Iozzi (2013) states that this map is **injective** if $G_1$ and $G_2$ are non-discrete subgroups of $Homeo_+(S^1)$ that each contain a non-abelian free subgroup. As stated in Step 2, Thompson's group T satisfies these conditions. Therefore, for $G_1=G_2=T$, the map $\\times_b$ is injective.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the domain of the Künneth map for n=4**\nFor $n=4$, the domain of the map is:\n$$ \\bigoplus_{p+q=4} H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R}) = (H_b^0 \\otimes H_b^4) \\oplus (H_b^1 \\otimes H_b^3) \\oplus (H_b^2 \\otimes H_b^2) \\oplus (H_b^3 \\otimes H_b^1) \\oplus (H_b^4 \\otimes H_b^0) $$\n(where $H_b^k$ stands for $H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$).\nIf we can show that any of these summands is infinite-dimensional, then injectivity of $\\times_b$ implies that $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$ is also infinite-dimensional. We will focus on the term $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the dimension of $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$**\nThe bounded cohomology $H_b^n(G; \\mathbb{R})$ is related to the ordinary group cohomology $H^n(G; \\mathbb{R})$ via a natural comparison map $c^n: H_b^n(G; \\mathbb{R}) \\to H^n(G; \\mathbb{R})$. For any group G, this gives rise to a short exact sequence:\n$$ 0 \\to \\ker(c^n) \\to H_b^n(G; \\mathbb{R}) \\to \\text{Im}(c^n) \\to 0 $$\nFor $n=2$ and $G=T$, we have:\n1.  **Ordinary Cohomology $H^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$:** It is a classical result by Ghys and Sergiescu that the Euler class of the action of T on the circle gives a non-trivial cohomology class in $H^2(T; \\mathbb{Z})$. It turns out that $H^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n2.  **Comparison map $c^2$:** For CAT(0) groups, such as T, the comparison map is surjective for $n \\ge 2$. Thus, $\\text{Im}(c^2_T) = H^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n3.  **The kernel $\\ker(c^2_T)$:** The kernel of the comparison map in degree 2 is known to be isomorphic to the space of homogeneous quasimorphisms modulo homomorphisms. For T, since $H^1(T;\\mathbb{R}) = 0$, $\\ker(c^2_T)$ is isomorphic to the space of homogeneous quasimorphisms on T. A fundamental theorem by S. Matsumoto states that the space of quasimorphisms on any non-abelian group of circle homeomorphisms is infinite-dimensional. Since T is such a group, $\\ker(c^2_T)$ is an infinite-dimensional real vector space.\n\nFrom the exact sequence $0 \\to \\ker(c^2_T) \\to H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\to H^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\to 0$, we have $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\ker(c^2_T) \\oplus H^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$. Since $\\dim \\ker(c^2_T) = \\infty$ and $\\dim H^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$, we must have $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\infty$.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the final dimension**\n1.  We established that $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\infty$.\n2.  Therefore, the dimension of the tensor product space $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is also infinite.\n3.  This infinite-dimensional space is a direct summand of the domain of the Künneth map $\\times_b$.\n4.  The Künneth map $\\times_b$ is injective for $T \\times T$.\n5.  An injective linear map from an infinite-dimensional space must have an infinite-dimensional image.\n6.  Thus, the dimension of the codomain, $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, must be infinite.\n\nThe dimension is the cardinality of a basis for the vector space. For an infinite-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$, this is an infinite cardinal. In the context of such problems, this is typically expressed simply as \"infinite\".\n\n<<<infinity>>>"
