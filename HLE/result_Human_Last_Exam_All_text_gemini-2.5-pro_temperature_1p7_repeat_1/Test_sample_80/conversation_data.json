    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of edge squares that would lack bishops.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and the Pieces**\n\n*   A standard chessboard is an 8x8 grid of 64 squares.\n*   The \"edge squares\" are all the squares in the first and last rows (rank 1 and rank 8) and the first and last columns (file 'a' and file 'h').\n*   A bishop is a piece that moves any number of squares diagonally.\n*   The primary rule is that no bishop can attack another, meaning no two bishops can be on the same diagonal line.\n*   A critical property of bishops is that a bishop on a white square can only ever attack other white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only ever attack other black squares. This allows us to solve the problem for each color independently.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Count the Edge Squares**\n\n*   **Row 1:** 8 squares\n*   **Row 8:** 8 squares\n*   **File 'a' (excluding corners):** 6 squares (a2 through a7)\n*   **File 'h' (excluding corners):** 6 squares (h2 through h7)\n*   **Total Edge Squares:** 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 3: Separate Edge Squares by Color**\n\n*   Each row and column on the edge has an equal number of white and black squares.\n*   Row 1 and Row 8 each have 4 white and 4 black squares.\n*   The remaining 6 squares on file 'a' and file 'h' each have 3 white and 3 black squares.\n*   **Total White Edge Squares:** 4 (from Row 1) + 4 (from Row 8) + 3 (from file 'a') + 3 (from file 'h') = 14 white squares.\n*   **Total Black Edge Squares:** 4 (from Row 1) + 4 (from Row 8) + 3 (from file 'a') + 3 (from file 'h') = 14 black squares.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares**\n\nThe goal is to place as many bishops as possible on the 14 white edge squares without any attacking each other. A simple and effective strategy is to fill one edge completely.\n*   Let's place bishops on all the white squares of Row 1: **b1, d1, f1, h1**.\n*   This placement uses 4 squares. Now, let's see which other white edge squares these bishops attack.\n    *   Bishop on b1 attacks a2.\n    *   Bishop on d1 attacks a4.\n    *   Bishop on f1 attacks a6.\n    *   Bishop on h1 attacks a8.\n*   So far, we have placed 4 bishops and they attack 4 other white edge squares. The squares still available are those on Row 8 (c8, e8, g8) and File 'h' (h3, h5, h7). None of these are attacked by the bishops on Row 1.\n*   Now, let's place bishops on the available squares in Row 8: **c8, e8, g8**.\n*   This adds 3 more bishops. Let's see which squares they attack.\n    *   Bishop on c8 attacks h3.\n    *   Bishop on e8 attacks h5.\n    *   Bishop on g8 attacks h7.\n*   This placement of 3 bishops attacks the remaining 3 white edge squares.\n*   In total, we have placed 4 + 3 = **7 bishops** on the white edge squares. All 14 white edge squares are either occupied by a bishop or attacked by one, so no more can be placed.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on Black Edge Squares**\n\nThe layout of the black edge squares is perfectly symmetrical to the white ones. We can therefore use the same logic to place a maximum of **7 bishops** on the 14 black edge squares.\n*   For example, we can place them on **a1, c1, e1, g1** (4 bishops), which attack the black squares h2, h4, h6, and h8.\n*   We can then place them on the remaining available squares **b8, d8, f8** (3 bishops), which attack the black squares a3, a5, and a7.\n*   This gives a total of 7 bishops on the black squares.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   The goal of the game was to place as many bishops as possible.\n*   Maximum bishops on white squares = 7\n*   Maximum bishops on black squares = 7\n*   **Total number of bishops placed:** 7 + 7 = 14 bishops.\n*   The question asks how many edge squares would **lack bishops**.\n*   **Total edge squares:** 28\n*   **Edge squares with bishops:** 14\n*   **Edge squares lacking bishops:** 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
