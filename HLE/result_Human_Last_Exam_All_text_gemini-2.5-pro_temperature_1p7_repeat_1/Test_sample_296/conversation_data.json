    "Answering this question requires analyzing the properties of the Grigorchuk group ($G$) and its possible finite quotients. We need to find the number of subgroups $H$ such that the index $[G:H] = 4$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Relate subgroups of finite index to group actions**\nA subgroup $H$ of index 4 in a group $G$ gives rise to a transitive action of $G$ on the set of 4 left cosets, $G/H$. This action is defined by a homomorphism $\\rho: G \\to S_4$, where $S_4$ is the symmetric group on 4 elements. The image of this homomorphism, $T = \\rho(G)$, must be a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The subgroup $H$ is the stabilizer of one of the cosets under this action.\n\n**Step 2: Identify properties of the Grigorchuk group ($G$)**\nThe Grigorchuk group is a finitely generated group with some key properties relevant to this problem:\n1.  It is an infinite **torsion group**, where every element has an order that is a power of 2.\n2.  Its **abelianization**, $G_{ab} = G/[G,G]$, is isomorphic to the elementary abelian group of order 8, i.e., $G_{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$.\n\n**Step 3: Constrain the possible homomorphic images in $S_4$**\nSince every element in $G$ has order a power of 2, any finite homomorphic image of $G$ must be a finite 2-group (a group whose order is a power of 2). Therefore, the image $T=\\rho(G)$ must be a transitive 2-subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n**Step 4: List transitive 2-subgroups of $S_4$**\nThe transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are:\n*   The cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ (order 4).\n*   The Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$ (order 4).\n*   The dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8).\n*   The alternating group $A_4$ (order 12, not a 2-group).\n*   The symmetric group $S_4$ (order 24, not a 2-group).\n\nThe transitive subgroups of $S_4$ that are also 2-groups are $\\mathbb{Z}_4$, $V_4$, and $D_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Eliminate impossible images**\nWe check if $G$ can have epimorphisms (surjective homomorphisms) onto these three groups.\n\n*   **Case 1: $T \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_4$**\n    Any homomorphism from $G$ to an abelian group like $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ must factor through its abelianization, $G_{ab}$. So, we would need an epimorphism from $G_{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_4$. However, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$ contains only elements of order 1 or 2, while $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ has an element of order 4. Thus, no such epimorphism exists. The image $T$ cannot be $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $T \\cong D_4$**\n    Whether $G$ has the dihedral group of order 8 as a quotient is a non-trivial question. It is a known (but difficult to prove here) result in the theory of the Grigorchuk group that it does **not** have $D_4$ as a homomorphic image. Therefore, $T$ cannot be $D_4$.\n\n*   **Case 3: $T \\cong V_4$**\n    Since $V_4 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$ is an abelian 2-group, it is a possible quotient of $G$. We will analyze this case further.\n\n**Step 6: Deduce the nature of subgroups of index 4**\nFrom the analysis above, the only possible image for a transitive action of $G$ on 4 elements is the Klein four-group $V_4$.\nLet $H$ be any subgroup of index 4 in $G$. The corresponding homomorphism $\\rho: G \\to S_4$ must have image $\\rho(G) \\cong V_4$.\nThe kernel of this homomorphism, $K = \\ker(\\rho)$, is a normal subgroup of $G$. The image is isomorphic to the quotient group, so $G/K \\cong V_4$. This means $[G:K] = 4$.\nThe kernel $K$ is also the core of $H$ in $G$, $K = \\text{Core}_G(H) = \\bigcap_{g \\in G} gHg^{-1}$. By definition, $K$ is a subgroup of $H$.\nWe have $K \\subseteq H \\subseteq G$. Since $[G:K]=4$ and $[G:H]=4$, it must be that $H=K$.\nThis proves a crucial point: **every subgroup of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is a normal subgroup.**\n\n**Step 7: Count the normal subgroups of index 4**\nWe now need to count the number of normal subgroups $H$ of $G$ with index 4.\nSuch a subgroup corresponds to a quotient group $G/H$ of order 4. As established, this quotient must be isomorphic to $V_4 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$.\nSo we need to count the number of epimorphisms from $G$ to $V_4$, or more precisely, the number of distinct kernels of such epimorphisms.\nAny homomorphism from $G$ to the abelian group $V_4$ must factor through $G_{ab} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$.\nThus, counting normal subgroups of index 4 in $G$ is equivalent to counting subgroups of index 4 in $G_{ab}$.\nA subgroup of index 4 in the group $V = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$ (of order 8) must have order $8/4=2$. In the language of vector spaces, this is a 1-dimensional subspace of the 3-dimensional vector space $V$ over the field with two elements, $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nThe number of 1-dimensional subspaces in an $n$-dimensional vector space over a field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n-1}{q-1}$.\nFor our case, $n=3$ and $q=2$.\nNumber of subgroups = $\\frac{2^3-1}{2-1} = \\frac{7}{1} = 7$.\n\nThere are exactly 7 such subgroups."
