    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.**\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a 6-dimensional real vector space with a basis $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$. The non-zero commutation relations are:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\nAll other brackets among basis elements are zero (up to skew-symmetry). We can check the Jacobi identity to confirm this is a valid Lie algebra. The only non-trivial identities involve $e_1$, and they all hold. For example:\n$[e_1, [e_2, e_3]] + [e_2, [e_3, e_1]] + [e_3, [e_1, e_2]] = [e_1, 0] + [e_2, -e_4] + [e_3, e_3] = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$.\nThe Lie algebra is nilpotent. We can see this by computing the lower central series:\n$\\mathfrak{g}^2 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\text{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$\n$\\mathfrak{g}^3 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^2] = \\text{span}\\{[e_1, e_3], [e_1,e_4], [e_1, e_6]\\} = \\text{span}\\{e_4\\}$\n$\\mathfrak{g}^4 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^3] = \\{0\\}$\nSince the series terminates at $\\{0\\}$, $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent.\n\n**Step 2: Find a suitable ideal to decompose the problem.**\nFor nilpotent Lie algebras, cohomology computations can often be simplified by considering a central extension. Let's find the center of $\\mathfrak{g}$, $Z(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\{x \\in \\mathfrak{g} \\mid [x, y] = 0 \\text{ for all } y \\in \\mathfrak{g}\\}$.\nLet $x = \\sum_{i=1}^6 c_i e_i$.\n$[x, e_1] = c_2[e_2, e_1] + c_3[e_3, e_1] + c_5[e_5, e_1] = -c_2 e_3 - c_3 e_4 - c_5 e_6 = 0 \\implies c_2 = c_3 = c_5 = 0$.\nSo $x$ must be of the form $c_1 e_1 + c_4 e_4 + c_6 e_6$.\n$[x, e_2] = c_1[e_1, e_2] = c_1 e_3 = 0 \\implies c_1 = 0$.\nSo $x = c_4 e_4 + c_6 e_6$. We check that $[e_4, y] = 0$ and $[e_6, y] = 0$ for all $y \\in \\mathfrak{g}$. This is true from the given relations.\nThus, the center is $Z(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\text{span}\\{e_4, e_6\\}$.\nLet $\\mathfrak{i} = Z(\\mathfrak{g})$. This is a 2-dimensional abelian ideal.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence.**\nWe have a central extension of Lie algebras:\n$0 \\to \\mathfrak{i} \\to \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{h} \\to 0$\nwhere $\\mathfrak{h} = \\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak{i}$. For a central extension of nilpotent Lie algebras over a field of characteristic zero, the Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence degenerates at the $E_2$ page. This implies that the Betti numbers of $\\mathfrak{g}$ are related to those of $\\mathfrak{i}$ and $\\mathfrak{h}$ by the Künneth formula, which means their Poincaré polynomials multiply:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = P_{\\mathfrak{i}}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathfrak{h}}(x)$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Poincaré polynomial of the ideal $\\mathfrak{i}$.**\nThe ideal $\\mathfrak{i} = \\text{span}\\{e_4, e_6\\}$ is a 2-dimensional abelian Lie algebra, i.e., $\\mathfrak{i} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$. The cohomology of an $n$-dimensional abelian Lie algebra is the exterior algebra on its dual space. The Betti numbers are $b_k(\\mathbb{R}^n) = \\binom{n}{k}$.\nFor $\\mathfrak{i} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$, the Betti numbers are $b_0=1, b_1=2, b_2=1$.\nThe Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{i}}(x) = 1 + 2x + x^2 = (1+x)^2$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Poincaré polynomial of the quotient algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$.**\nThe quotient algebra $\\mathfrak{h} = \\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak{i}$ is a 4-dimensional Lie algebra. Its basis consists of the equivalence classes of the basis vectors of $\\mathfrak{g}$ not in $\\mathfrak{i}$. Let these be $\\bar{e_1}, \\bar{e_2}, \\bar{e_3}, \\bar{e_5}$.\nThe commutation relations in $\\mathfrak{h}$ are inherited from $\\mathfrak{g}$:\n$[\\bar{e_1}, \\bar{e_2}] = \\overline{[e_1, e_2]} = \\bar{e_3}$.\n$[\\bar{e_1}, \\bar{e_3}] = \\overline{[e_1, e_3]} = \\bar{e_4} = 0$ (since $e_4 \\in \\mathfrak{i}$).\n$[\\bar{e_1}, \\bar{e_5}] = \\overline{[e_1, e_5]} = \\bar{e_6} = 0$ (since $e_6 \\in \\mathfrak{i}$).\nAll other brackets $[\\bar{e_i}, \\bar{e_j}]$ are zero.\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$ decomposes into a direct sum of two ideals:\n$\\mathfrak{h}_A = \\text{span}\\{\\bar{e_1}, \\bar{e_2}, \\bar{e_3}\\}$ with $[\\bar{e_1}, \\bar{e_2}]=\\bar{e_3}$. This is the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra, $\\mathfrak{h}_3$.\n$\\mathfrak{h}_B = \\text{span}\\{\\bar{e_5}\\}$ with all brackets zero. This is the 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra, $\\mathbb{R}$.\nSo, $\\mathfrak{h} \\cong \\mathfrak{h}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe Poincaré polynomial of a direct sum is the product of the individual Poincaré polynomials: $P_{\\mathfrak{h}}(x) = P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x)$.\nThe Betti numbers of $\\mathbb{R}$ are $b_0=1, b_1=1$, so $P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x) = 1+x$.\nThe Betti numbers for the 3-dimensional Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_3$ are well-known: $b_0=1, b_1=2, b_2=2, b_3=1$. So, $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3$.\nTherefore, the Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{h}$ is:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{h}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3)(1+x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3 + x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4 = 1 + 3x + 4x^2 + 3x^3 + x^4$.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results to find $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x)$.**\nFinally, we multiply the Poincaré polynomials of $\\mathfrak{i}$ and $\\mathfrak{h}$:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = P_{\\mathfrak{i}}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathfrak{h}}(x) = (1+2x+x^2)(1+3x+4x^2+3x^3+x^4)$.\nLet's perform the polynomial multiplication:\n$1 \\cdot (1+3x+4x^2+3x^3+x^4) = 1+3x+4x^2+3x^3+x^4$\n$2x \\cdot (1+3x+4x^2+3x^3+x^4) = \\phantom{1+}2x+6x^2+8x^3+6x^4+2x^5$\n$x^2 \\cdot (1+3x+4x^2+3x^3+x^4) = \\phantom{1+2x+}x^2+3x^3+4x^4+3x^5+x^6$\nSumming the terms coefficient-wise:\n$x^0: 1$\n$x^1: 3+2=5$\n$x^2: 4+6+1=11$\n$x^3: 3+8+3=14$\n$x^4: 1+6+4=11$\n$x^5: 2+3=5$\n$x^6: 1$\nThe resulting Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1+5x+11x^2+14x^3+11x^4+5x^5+x^6$."
