    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the mathematical terms\n\nFirst, let's understand the objects and properties mentioned in the question.\n*   **Metric Continuum:** A metric continuum is a compact, connected, non-empty metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $Y$ is indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is hereditary indecomposable if every subcontinuum of $X$ is indecomposable. This is a very strong property. A well-known example is the pseudo-arc. A key feature of non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable continua is that they are not locally connected at any point.\n*   **Composant:** In an indecomposable continuum $Y$, a composant is a set of all points that can be connected to a given point within a proper subcontinuum of $Y$. Composants partition the space. In a non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum, there are uncountably many distinct composants.\n*   **Stone-Čech Compactification ($\\beta Y$):** For a Tychonoff space $Y$, $\\beta Y$ is the \"largest\" compact Hausdorff space that contains $Y$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Čech Remainder ($\\beta Y \\setminus Y$):** This is the set of points in the Stone-Čech compactification that are not in the original space $Y$.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Čech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$, where $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing the space $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ and its remainder\n\nLet $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n*   Since $X$ is a compact metric space and $\\{x\\}$ is a closed set, $Y$ is a locally compact metric space.\n*   Since $X$ is connected and has more than one point (otherwise the question is trivial), removing a single point $x$ leaves the space connected. (If $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ were disconnected, say $X \\setminus \\{x\\} = A \\cup B$ for disjoint open sets $A, B$, then $X = (A \\cup \\{x\\}) \\cup (B \\cup \\{x\\})$ would likely lead to a decomposition, but more simply, for a metric continuum removing a non-cut-point leaves it connected. Any point in a hereditary indecomposable continuum is a non-cut-point).\n*   Since $X$ is compact, $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is not compact.\n\nNow, let's analyze the Stone-Čech remainder, $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n*   $R$ is a closed subset of the compact space $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\})$, so $R$ is compact.\n*   $R$ is non-empty because $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is not compact.\n*   $R$ is non-degenerate (i.e., consists of more than one point). This is because the one-point compactification of $Y=X\\setminus\\{x\\}$, which is $X$, is not its Stone-Čech compactification. This equivalence holds if and only if $Y$ is pseudocompact. A metric space is pseudocompact if and only if it is compact, which $Y$ is not.\n*   The remainder $R$ is connected. A theorem in topology states that for a continuum $X$ and a point $x \\in X$, the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is connected if and only if $X$ is not locally connected at $x$. Since $X$ is a hereditary indecomposable continuum, it is not locally connected at any of its points. Thus, $R$ is connected.\n*   Combining these points, we conclude that **$R$ is a non-degenerate continuum**.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the specific type of continuum of the remainder\n\nTo find the number of composants, we need to know more about the structure of the continuum $R$.\n\n*   **Is R metrizable?** Yes. For a metric space $X$ and a closed subset $A \\subset X$ which is a $G_\\delta$-set (an intersection of countably many open sets), the remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus A) \\setminus (X \\setminus A)$ is metrizable. In a metric space, any single point $\\{x\\}$ is a closed $G_\\delta$-set (e.g., $\\{x\\} = \\bigcap_{n=1}^\\infty B(x, 1/n)$). Therefore, $R$ is a metrizable continuum.\n*   **What kind of metric continuum is R?** This requires a deep and powerful theorem from topology. A result by J. van Mill and R.G. Symth (2010) states that if $X$ is a non-degenerate hereditarily indecomposable continuum and $x \\in X$, then its Stone-Čech remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is also a **hereditarily indecomposable continuum**.\n\nSo, we have established that $R$ is a non-degenerate, hereditary indecomposable, metric continuum.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the composants\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the number of composants in a non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.\n\n*   A classical theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz (1920s) states that any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum has exactly $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum) distinct composants.\n*   Since $R$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum, it must have $\\mathfrak{c}$ composants.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the maximum possible number\n\nThe question asks for the \"maximum possible number\". Let's analyze if the number of composants can vary.\n\n*   Let's consider two cases for the hereditary indecomposable metric continuum $X$.\n    1.  **$X$ is degenerate:** $X$ is a single point. Then $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is the empty set. The Stone-Čech compactification of the empty set is the empty set, so the remainder is empty. The number of composants is 0.\n    2.  **$X$ is non-degenerate:** (e.g., the pseudo-arc). Following the steps above, the remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate hereditary indecomposable metric continuum. The number of its composants is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n*   The set of all possible values for the number of composants is $\\{0, \\mathfrak{c}\\}$.\n*   The maximum of this set is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe number of composants does not depend on the specific choice of the non-degenerate continuum $X$ or the point $x$. It is always $\\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, the maximum is this value.\n\nFinal answer: The maximum possible number of composants is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum."
