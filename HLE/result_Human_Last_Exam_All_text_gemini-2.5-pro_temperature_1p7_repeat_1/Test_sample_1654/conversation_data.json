    "To determine how many times Chekov describes Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon\" as a symbol of his shifting mentality, we need to carefully analyze the text, focusing on each instance where the coat is mentioned in relation to a change in his attitude.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question's premise.**\nThe question correctly identifies that the coat is a key symbol in the story, representing Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's \"chameleon-like\" nature. His interactions with the coat—putting it on and taking it off—directly correspond to his vacillating opinions as he tries to determine the social status of the dog's owner. We are looking for the number of distinct moments where Chekov uses the coat to illustrate these shifts.\n\n**Step 2: List the careful points to consider.**\n*   We are not just counting the word \"coat\" or \"overcoat.\"\n*   We are counting the number of distinct actions or descriptions that signal a change in Otchumyelov's psychological state.\n*   Each action of taking the coat off or putting it on represents a \"description\" in the symbolic sense intended by the question.\n*   We must also include the initial and final descriptions that frame the narrative.\n\n**Step 3: Chronological review of the story for mentions of the coat.**\n\n1.  **First Instance (Initial State):** At the very beginning of the story, Chekov establishes the scene and Otchumyelov's official presence.\n    > \"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square in a **new overcoat**...\"\n    This first description sets his initial state: authoritative and on duty.\n\n2.  **Second Instance (First Shift):** After threatening to punish the dog's owner, Otchumyelov hears from someone in the crowd that the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. His authoritative stance immediately melts into a subservient one.\n    > \"Help me off with my **coat**, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain.\"\n    He takes the coat off, symbolizing his sudden panic and feeling of being \"hot under the collar\" from the fear of offending a powerful person.\n\n3.  **Third Instance (Second Shift):** His constable, Yeldyrin, remarks that the General doesn't own such a dog. Otchumyelov's authority returns instantly.\n    > \"Put my **coat** on, brother Yeldyrin. There's a wind getting up. ... I am cold...\"\n    He puts the coat back on, symbolically re-assuming his mantle of authority and cold, harsh officialdom.\n\n4.  **Fourth Instance (Third Shift):** Another person in the crowd insists it *is* the General's dog. Once again, Otchumyelov panics.\n    > \"Take my **coat** off, Yeldyrin...\"\n    He removes the coat for the second time, again shedding his authority and becoming flustered and obsequious.\n\n5.  **Fifth Instance (Final State):** The story concludes after the dog is identified as belonging to the General's visiting brother. The situation is resolved. Otchumyelov has navigated the crisis and leaves the scene, re-establishing his persona.\n    > \"...**wrapping himself in his greatcoat**, he goes on his way through the market-place.\"\n    This final action shows him bundling himself back into his official identity, a concluding symbol of his chameleon-like ability to adapt and protect himself.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the story chronologically, we can identify five distinct moments where Chekov uses Otchumyelov's coat to describe his shifting mentality and authority. Each action involving the coat is a deliberate narrative device.\n\n<<<5>>>"
