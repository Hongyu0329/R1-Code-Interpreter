    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n**Careful Points & Methodology**\n\n1.  **Coiled-Coil Structure:** Coiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices wrapping around each other. Their structure is defined by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, called a heptad repeat, denoted as `abcdefg`.\n2.  **The Hydrophobic Core:** The stability and oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, etc.) are primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the `a` and `d` positions. These positions form the hydrophobic core where the helices pack together. The specific identity and packing of these residues (\"knobs-into-holes\" packing) are crucial.\n3.  **Electrostatic Interactions:** The residues at the `e` and `g` positions are typically charged or polar and located on the solvent-exposed face near the hydrophobic core. Electrostatic interactions (attractions or repulsions) between these positions on adjacent helices also influence stability and specificity.\n4.  **Frame Determination:** The first step is to correctly assign the `abcdefg` positions to the amino acid sequence. Since these are designed sequences, we look for a consistent pattern where hydrophobic residues occupy the `a` and `d` positions. All sequences start with `EIA...`, and a common convention for such sequences (like the well-studied GCN4 leucine zipper) is to start the repeat at the `g` position. This places the first `I` (Isoleucine) at the `a` position. Let's apply this `gabcdef` frame.\n    *   **Frame:** The sequence begins at `g`. `a` = positions 2, 9, 16, 23. `d` = positions 5, 12, 19, 26.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Sequence**\n\n**Sequence 1: EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**\n*   **`a` positions:** I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n*   **`d` positions:** A, A, W, A (Alanine, Alanine, Tryptophan, Alanine)\n*   **Analysis:** The core is composed of Isoleucine at all `a` positions and primarily Alanine at `d` positions (with one bulky Tryptophan). The presence of the beta-branched amino acid Isoleucine at the `a` position strongly favors packing arrangements found in dimers. This `I(a)-A(d)` combination is a known motif for forming **dimers**.\n*   **Predicted State:** Dimer (2)\n\n**Sequence 2: EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**\n*   **`a` positions:** I, I, N, I (Isoleucine, Isoleucine, Asparagine, Isoleucine)\n*   **`d` positions:** L, L, L, L (Leucine)\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence has a canonical `I(a)-L(d)` dimeric core, but with a critical substitution: an Asparagine (N), which is polar, at one of the core `a` positions. Burying a polar residue is generally unfavorable. However, in a trimeric arrangement, the three Asparagine residues (one from each helix) can face each other in the core and form a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network. This \"polar layer\" is a well-established design feature to specifically induce **trimer** formation.\n*   **Predicted State:** Trimer (3)\n\n**Sequence 3: EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**\n*   **`a` positions:** I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n*   **`d` positions:** I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n*   **Analysis:** Here, both the `a` and `d` positions are occupied by the beta-branched amino acid Isoleucine. The steric bulk of Isoleucine at both core positions creates a packing arrangement that is most favorable in a **tetramer**. Dimers and trimers would result in significant steric clashes, making the tetramer the most stable configuration.\n*   **Predicted State:** Tetramer (4)\n\n**Sequence 4: EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**\n*   **`a` positions:** I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n*   **`d` positions:** Q, Q, Q, Q (Glutamine)\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence features a core with Isoleucine at the `a` positions and the polar amino acid Glutamine (Q) at all `d` positions. Similar to the Asparagine in Sequence 2, these polar residues are buried in the hydrophobic core. This arrangement, particularly the repeating \"glutamine layer,\" is characteristic of the Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein (COMP), which is a well-known **pentamer**. The glutamine side chains form an extensive hydrogen-bonding network within the core, stabilizing this higher-order structure.\n*   **Predicted State:** Pentamer (5)\n\n**Sequence 5: EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**\n*   **`a` positions:** I, I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n*   **`d` positions:** T, T, T, T (Threonine)\n*   **Analysis:** The core consists of Isoleucine at `a` and Threonine (a polar, beta-branched residue) at `d`. Based on established design principles, this `I(a)-T(d)` pairing generally promotes the formation of trimers. However, none of the answer choices match the resulting sequence (2, 3, 4, 5, 3). Let's re-examine the options. Option F (`2,3,4,5,7`) matches the predictions for the first four sequences perfectly. This is a very strong indication that this is the intended answer. In the context of this specific problem, despite the `I(a)-T(d)` core commonly leading to trimers, we must conclude from the available choices that this specific sequence forms a **heptamer (7)**. There might be a more subtle design principle at play (perhaps involving the unusual Leucines at the `e` positions) or this may refer to a specific, less common experimental result. Given the perfect match for the first four well-known motifs, this is the most logical deduction.\n*   **Predicted State:** Heptamer (7)\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n\n1.  Sequence 1: **2** (Dimer)\n2.  Sequence 2: **3** (Trimer)\n3.  Sequence 3: **4** (Tetramer)\n4.  Sequence 4: **5** (Pentamer)\n5.  Sequence 5: **7** (Heptamer)\n\nThis corresponds to the sequence of numbers **2, 3, 4, 5, 7**.\n\n<<<F>>>"
