    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in two patches of surface code with two holes each.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand How Logical Qubits are Encoded in Surface Codes**\n\nThe number of logical qubits that a surface code can encode depends on the topology of the 2D surface on which it is laid out. Specifically, it is determined by two main properties:\n1.  **Genus (g):** This represents the number of \"handles\" on the surface. For a simple plane or sphere, the genus is 0. For a torus (like a donut), the genus is 1.\n2.  **Boundaries (b):** These are the number of distinct holes or edges in the code's lattice. Creating a hole in a patch of surface code creates a boundary.\n\n**Step 2: The Formula for Calculating Logical Qubits**\n\nThe number of logical qubits, denoted by `k`, that can be encoded on a single, connected surface with genus `g` and `b` boundaries is given by the formula:\n`k = 2g + b - 1`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze a Single Patch of Surface Code**\n\nLet's first determine the number of logical qubits for a single patch as described in the question.\n*   **System:** One patch of surface code. A \"patch\" is typically laid out on a simple, flat plane. Therefore, the genus `g = 0`.\n*   **Features:** The patch has \"two holes\". These holes act as boundaries in the code. Therefore, the number of boundaries `b = 2`.\n\nNow, we apply the formula to this single patch:\n*   `k_patch = 2g + b - 1`\n*   `k_patch = 2(0) + 2 - 1`\n*   `k_patch = 0 + 1`\n*   `k_patch = 1`\n\nSo, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode exactly one logical qubit.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Complete System (Two Patches)**\n\nThe problem specifies \"two patches of surface code\". These are treated as two separate, independent quantum systems. The total number of logical qubits in a combined system of independent components is simply the sum of the logical qubits in each component.\n*   Number of logical qubits in Patch 1 = 1\n*   Number of logical qubits in Patch 2 = 1\n\nTotal number of logical qubits `k_total` is:\n*   `k_total = (qubits in Patch 1) + (qubits in Patch 2)`\n*   `k_total = 1 + 1`\n*   `k_total = 2`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Genus vs. Holes:** It is crucial not to confuse the genus of the surface with the holes punched into the lattice. A \"patch\" implies a planar geometry (`g=0`), while the \"holes\" create boundaries (`b>0`).\n2.  **The `b-1` Term:** The contribution from boundaries is `b-1`, not `b`. This is because the logical operators associated with the boundaries are not all independent. There is one constraint among them (e.g., the product of all Z-type boundary operators must be the identity), which reduces the number of independent logical qubits by one. For two boundaries, this gives `2-1=1` logical qubit.\n3.  **Independent Systems:** The problem describes two distinct \"patches\". Since they are not specified as being connected, they are independent. The total capacity for encoding information is the sum of the capacities of the individual parts.\n4.  **Interpretation:** The phrasing \"two patches of surface code with two holes\" is interpreted as each of the two patches having two holes. This is the most standard interpretation of such a description.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nFollowing the step-by-step analysis, we first calculate that one patch with a planar topology (`g=0`) and two holes (`b=2`) can encode `2*0 + 2 - 1 = 1` logical qubit. Since there are two such identical and independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits in each, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n<<<2>>>"
