    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object and its properties.**\nThe tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with the following key properties:\n*   It has 20 faces, and each face is an equilateral triangle.\n*   It has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n*   It is highly symmetric. Crucially, it has a single point at its geometric center known as the center of symmetry. Any line passing through this center connects a point on the surface (like a vertex, or a point on a face or edge) to an identical, opposite point.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the setup of the tank.**\n*   The icosahedron tank is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of its 20 triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n*   The tank is \"half-filled with water\". This means the volume of the water is exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the position and orientation of the water surface.**\n*   Under gravity, the surface of a liquid at rest in a container is always a horizontal plane.\n*   Because the icosahedron has a center of symmetry, a plane passing through this center will divide its volume into two equal halves.\n*   Since the water fills exactly half the volume, its surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the icosahedron's center of symmetry. This plane is parallel to the triangular base.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the shape of the water surface.**\nThe question now becomes: What is the shape of the cross-section created when you slice an icosahedron with a plane that passes through its center and is parallel to one of its faces?\n*   This cross-section will be a polygon. The vertices of this polygon are the points where the plane cuts the edges of the icosahedron.\n*   To visualize this, consider the arrangement of the icosahedron's edges relative to the cutting plane. When an icosahedron is stood on one face, its 12 vertices are arranged in four horizontal layers. The central cutting plane passes exactly between the two middle layers.\n*   The plane will cut only the edges that connect these two middle layers.\n*   There are exactly six such edges forming a zig-zag \"belt\" or \"equator\" around the icosahedron.\n*   Therefore, the cutting plane intersects 6 edges. This means the resulting polygonal shape has 6 vertices. A polygon with 6 vertices is a hexagon.\n\n**Step 5: Determine if the hexagon is regular.**\n*   The orientation of the icosahedron (standing on a face) has a 3-fold rotational symmetry about a vertical axis passing through the center.\n*   The central horizontal cutting plane shares this symmetry.\n*   Furthermore, the icosahedron's central symmetry means that the entire arrangement is symmetric.\n*   These high degrees of symmetry dictate that the 6 vertices of the hexagonal cross-section must be positioned perfectly symmetrically. They will be at an equal distance from the center and equally spaced angularly.\n*   A hexagon with these properties is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   Recognize that \"half-filled\" in a centrally symmetric object implies the surface is a plane through the center of symmetry.\n*   Understand that \"standing on a face\" defines the orientation of the icosahedron relative to the horizontal water surface.\n*   The problem is purely about the geometry of the icosahedron's central cross-section, parallel to a face.\n*   Use symmetry arguments to determine the number of sides (6) and the regularity of the resulting polygon.\n\nThe final answer is the shape of this central cross-section.\n\n<<<a regular hexagon>>>"
