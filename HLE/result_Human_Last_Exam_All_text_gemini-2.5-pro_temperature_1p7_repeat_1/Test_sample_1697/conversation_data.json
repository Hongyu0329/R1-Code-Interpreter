    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The reactant is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   **Benzamide:** A benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (C=O) which is connected to a nitrogen atom. This group is at position 1 of the ring.\n    *   **N,N-diethyl:** The nitrogen of the amide group is bonded to two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). The full amide group is -C(=O)N(Et)₂.\n    *   **3-dimethylamino:** At position 3 (meta position relative to the amide group), there is a dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂.\n*   **Reagents for the first step:**\n    *   **sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium):** A very strong organometallic base. Its primary role in this context is to deprotonate the most acidic hydrogen in the molecule.\n    *   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine):** A chelating ligand for lithium ions. It coordinates to the Li⁺, breaking up aggregates of sec-BuLi and increasing its reactivity as a base. It is a key component in **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reactions.\n    *   **THF (Tetrahydrofuran):** The reaction solvent, a polar aprotic ether suitable for organolithium reactions.\n*   **Reagent for the second step:**\n    *   **Methyl iodide (CH₃I):** An electrophile used to introduce a methyl group.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Lithiation)**\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**. In a DoM reaction, a functional group on the benzene ring directs the strong base to deprotonate a proton at the position *ortho* (adjacent) to it. This occurs because a heteroatom (like oxygen or nitrogen) in the directing group coordinates to the lithium ion, positioning the base for abstraction of a nearby ortho proton.\n\n1.  **Identify the Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs):** The starting material has two DMGs:\n    *   The **N,N-diethylamide group** [-C(=O)N(Et)₂] at position 1.\n    *   The **dimethylamino group** [-N(CH₃)₂] at position 3.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Strength and Directing Effect of each DMG:**\n    *   The amide group is one of the most powerful DMGs known. The carbonyl oxygen is an excellent Lewis base for coordinating with the lithium ion, directing deprotonation to its ortho positions, which are **C2** and **C6**.\n    *   The dimethylamino group is also a good DMG. The nitrogen's lone pair coordinates the lithium ion, directing deprotonation to its ortho positions, which are **C2** and **C4**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Most Acidic Proton:** We compare the positions targeted by the DMGs.\n    *   Position **C2** is ortho to *both* the powerful amide group and the amino group. This cooperative, or reinforcing, effect makes the proton at C2 exceptionally acidic and the prime target for deprotonation.\n    *   Position C6 is only ortho to the amide group.\n    *   Position C4 is only ortho to the amino group.\n    *   The established hierarchy of directing ability places the amide group (-CONR₂) as a much stronger director than the amino group (-NR₂).\n    *   Due to the superior directing power of the amide group and the reinforcing effect from the amino group, deprotonation occurs exclusively at the **C2 position**.\n\nThe product of the first step is the aryllithium intermediate: **2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Step 3: The Electrophilic Quench**\n\nThe aryllithium species formed is a powerful nucleophile (a carbanion at C2). When methyl iodide (CH₃I) is added, the nucleophilic C2 carbon attacks the electrophilic methyl carbon of CH₃I.\n\n*   This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction.\n*   A new carbon-carbon bond forms between the C2 of the benzene ring and the methyl group.\n*   The iodide ion (I⁻) is displaced as a leaving group.\n\n**Step 4: The Final Product**\n\nThe net result of the two-step sequence is the replacement of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position with a methyl group.\n\n*   The initial molecule was N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n*   The final molecule has a methyl group added at the C2 position.\n*   The name of the final product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-(dimethylamino)benzamide**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe compound obtained is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-(dimethylamino)benzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-(dimethylamino)benzamide>>>"
