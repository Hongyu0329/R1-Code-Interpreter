    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **Who?** Two Nobel laureates.\n2.  **What?** They were featured in a commercial.\n3.  **For whom?** The company was Enron.\n4.  **When?** The year was 2000.\n5.  **What was the tagline?** \"Ask Why\".\n\nThe question requires identifying the two specific individuals who fit all these criteria. The word \"infamous\" highlights that this association became notorious, likely after the Enron scandal broke in 2001.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the \"Ask Why\" Campaign**\nFirst, we must confirm the existence and nature of Enron's \"Ask Why\" campaign. This was a real, high-profile advertising campaign launched by Enron in 2000. Its goal was to rebrand the company from a simple energy pipeline and trading firm into a global, innovative, and ideas-driven corporation. The campaign featured a series of television commercials and print ads.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the First Nobel Laureate**\nOne of the most frequently cited participants in this campaign is the economist Paul Krugman.\n*   **Verification:** At the time of the commercial in 2000, he was a highly respected professor of economics at MIT.\n*   **Careful Point:** A crucial detail is that Paul Krugman was **not yet** a Nobel laureate in 2000. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008. However, the question asks for \"Nobel laureates\" who \"were featured,\" which is correctly interpreted as individuals who hold the title, even if they were awarded it after the event in question. Krugman's subsequent win made his earlier participation in the Enron ad all the more notable and \"infamous.\" He has since expressed deep regret for his involvement.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Second Nobel Laureate**\nThe other Nobel laureate famously associated with Enron's efforts to burnish its image at this time was Nelson Mandela.\n*   **Verification:** Nelson Mandela received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. Therefore, unlike Krugman, he was already a Nobel laureate at the time of the 2000 campaign.\n*   **Careful Point:** The nature of his being \"featured\" was different from Krugman's. While Krugman appeared on-camera in a dedicated commercial spot, Enron's association with Mandela was more through corporate sponsorship and the alignment of their messaging with his legacy of revolutionary change. Enron was a major financial supporter of Mandela and his causes. The \"Ask Why\" campaign's themes of challenging the status quo were meant to evoke the spirit of leaders like Mandela, thereby lending prestige to the Enron brand. Although he did not appear in a traditional talking-head commercial, he was very much \"featured\" as a central part of Enron's global public relations and image strategy.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Finalize the Answer**\nCombining the findings, the two Nobel laureates who were infamously featured in or associated with Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" campaign are:\n1.  **Paul Krugman** (a future Nobel laureate at the time)\n2.  **Nelson Mandela** (a current Nobel laureate at the time)\n\nThe infamy comes from the stark contrast between the high-minded, intellectual, and moral authority these figures represented and the massive corporate fraud that Enron was perpetrating behind the scenes.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Nelson Mandela>>>"
