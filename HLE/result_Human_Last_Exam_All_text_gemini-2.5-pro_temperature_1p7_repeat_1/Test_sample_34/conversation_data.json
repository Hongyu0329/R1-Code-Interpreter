    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack you should open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Scenario:**\n    *   **Position: Button (BTN).** This is the most advantageous position in poker pre-flop. You act last on every post-flop street, giving you a significant informational advantage. This allows you to play a much wider range of hands profitably compared to any other position.\n    *   **Action: Open to 2.5x.** This is a standard opening raise size. The goal is to either steal the blinds pre-flop or to build a pot where you have a positional and potential hand-strength advantage.\n    *   **Game: 100BB Rake-Free Cash Game.** 100BB is the standard stack depth. The \"rake-free\" part is crucial. Rake is the fee the house takes from the pot. In a standard game, rake slightly discourages playing marginal hands. In a rake-free game, the profitability of stealing the blinds increases, and marginal hands become slightly more valuable, encouraging an even wider opening range.\n    *   **The Question:** We need to find the *worst* hand in the \"suited jack\" category (JXs) that is still considered a standard, profitable open-raise. This means we are looking for the hand at the absolute bottom of the JXs opening range.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the \"Suited Jack\" (JXs) Category:**\n    *   The hands in this category are JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n    *   **Common Strength:** All these hands are suited, which gives them the potential to make a powerful flush. The Jack is a strong high card, capable of making a strong top pair.\n    *   **Key Differentiator:** The primary factor that separates these hands in value is **connectivity** and **kicker strength**.\n        *   **Connectivity:** This refers to the ability to make straights. JTs is a premium connector. J9s is a one-gapper. J5s is a six-gapper. J2s is a nine-gapper. The larger the gap, the less likely the hand is to make a straight.\n        *   **Kicker Strength:** The second card also serves as a kicker if you make a pair of Jacks. A higher kicker is better. Furthermore, pairing your second card is more valuable when it's a 9 or 8 than when it's a 2 or 3.\n\n3.  **Rank the Suited Jacks from Best to Worst:**\n    *   **Top Tier (Premium/Strong):** JTs, J9s. These hands have excellent connectivity to go with their flush and high-card potential.\n    *   **Mid Tier (Playable):** J8s, J7s, J6s. The connectivity is decreasing, but they can still flop strong draws.\n    *   **Bottom Tier (Marginal):** J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s. These hands have very poor connectivity. Their value comes almost entirely from their flush potential, making a pair of Jacks, and the bluffing opportunities that position on the button affords.\n\n4.  **Identify the Weakest Hand in the Category:**\n    *   Comparing the bottom-tier hands (J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s), **J2s** is objectively the worst.\n    *   It has the worst possible connectivity (nine-gapper).\n    *   It has the lowest possible kicker. A pair of Jacks with a 2 kicker is highly vulnerable to being out-kicked.\n    *   A pair of twos is the weakest possible pair you can make.\n\n5.  **Determine if the Weakest Hand (J2s) Should Be Opened:**\n    *   Now, we must ask: \"Is J2s a profitable open from the button in this scenario?\"\n    *   According to standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker strategy, the button's opening range is extremely wide, often including 45-50% of all hands.\n    *   In a standard (raked) 100BB game, **all suited Jacks are considered a standard open-raise from the button**. The combination of positional advantage, blind-stealing equity, and the hand's raw potential (flush draws, top pair) makes even a marginal hand like J2s a profitable raise over folding.\n    *   The \"rake-free\" condition only strengthens this conclusion. With no rake, the reward for successfully stealing the blinds (1.5BB) is higher, which increases the baseline Expected Value (EV) of every open. Therefore, if J2s is a standard open with rake, it is unquestionably a standard open without rake.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe hands in the JXs category decrease in value as the second card gets lower. J2s is the weakest hand in this category. Because a standard button opening range includes all suited Jacks, J2s represents the thresholdâ€”it is the *worst* suited Jack that you should still open-raise.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
