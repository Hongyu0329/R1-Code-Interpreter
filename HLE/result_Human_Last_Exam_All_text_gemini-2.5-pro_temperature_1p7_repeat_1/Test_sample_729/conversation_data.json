    "An analysis of the question of finding the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group in question.**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted by $Q_{128}$. Since $128 = 2^7$, we are dealing with the group $Q_{2^n}$ where $n=7$. Its presentation is:\n$Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^{7-1}} = 1, x^{2^{7-2}} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\nThis simplifies to:\n$Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n\nKey properties of this group:\n*   The order of the group is 128.\n*   The element $x$ generates a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64. This subgroup is normal in $Q_{128}$ and has index 2.\n*   The elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ are of the form $yx^k$ for $0 \\le k < 64$.\n*   For any element $yx^k$, its square is $(yx^k)^2 = yx^k yx^k = y(x^k y x^{-k})x^{2k} = y(y x^{-k})x^k=y^2x^{-k}x^k = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n*   The center of the group is $Z(Q_{128}) = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle = \\{1, x^{32}\\}$, which has order 2.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the term \"power subgroup\".**\n\nThe term \"power subgroup\" is not universally standardized in group theory literature. There are a few plausible interpretations.\n\n*   **Interpretation A: The Frattini subgroup.** \"Power subgroup\" is sometimes used as a synonym for the Frattini subgroup, denoted $\\Phi(G)$. The Frattini subgroup is the intersection of all maximal subgroups. For a p-group (which $Q_{128}$ is, with p=2), $\\Phi(G) = G'G^p$, where $G'$ is the commutator subgroup and $G^p = \\langle g^p | g \\in G \\rangle$. The question \"How many power subgroups\" is strange if it refers to a single unique subgroup. However, it could be interpreted as asking \"How many subgroups are there *within* the Frattini subgroup?\".\n*   **Interpretation B: Subgroups of the form $G^k$.** For an integer $k$, the $k$-th power subgroup is $G^k = \\langle g^k | g \\in G \\rangle$. The question could be asking for the number of distinct subgroups obtained this way for all possible integers $k$.\n*   **Interpretation C: Subgroups in the lower p-series.** This series, also known as the p-power series, is defined by $P_1(G) = G$ and $P_{i+1}(G) = [P_i(G), G](P_i(G))^p$. The subgroups $P_i(G)$ could be what is meant by \"power subgroups\".\n\nWe will analyze all plausible interpretations.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis under Interpretation A (Subgroups of the Frattini Subgroup).**\n\n1.  **Find the Frattini subgroup $\\Phi(Q_{128})$:**\n    *   **Commutator subgroup $(Q_{128})'$:** For $Q_{2^n}$, it is a known result that $(Q_{2^n})' = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$. So, $(Q_{128})' = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $64/2=32$.\n    *   **Square subgroup $(Q_{128})^2$:** This is the subgroup generated by the squares of all elements. The squares are of two forms: $(x^k)^2 = x^{2k}$ and $(yx^k)^2 = x^{32}$. The subgroup generated by all these elements is $\\langle x^2, x^{32} \\rangle$. Since $x^{32} = (x^{16})^2$, this element is already in $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$. So, $(Q_{128})^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   **Frattini subgroup:** $\\Phi(Q_{128}) = (Q_{128})'(Q_{128})^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle \\langle x^2 \\rangle = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n    So, the Frattini subgroup is $\\Phi(Q_{128}) = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$, which is a cyclic group of order 32, i.e., $\\Phi(Q_{128}) \\cong C_{32}$.\n\n2.  **Count the subgroups of $\\Phi(Q_{128})$:**\n    The number of subgroups of a finite cyclic group $C_n$ is equal to the number of divisors of $n$, denoted $\\tau(n)$.\n    Here, we need to find the number of subgroups of $C_{32}$. So we calculate $\\tau(32)$.\n    The prime factorization of 32 is $2^5$.\n    $\\tau(32) = 5+1 = 6$.\n    The subgroups are generated by the elements $(x^2)^d$ where $d$ is a divisor of 32. The divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. This gives the 6 subgroups: $\\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}$.\n\n    Under this interpretation, the answer is 6.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis under Interpretation B (Subgroups of the form $G^k$).**\n\n1.  **Case 1: $k$ is odd.**\n    The set of $k$-th powers, $\\{g^k\\}$, contains $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k,64)=1$, so the elements $x^{ik}$ generate all of $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n    The set also contains $(yx^j)^k$. Since $k$ is odd, say $k=2m+1$, we have $(yx^j)^k = (yx^j)((yx^j)^2)^m = yx^j(x^{32})^m = yx^{j+32m}$. By choosing an appropriate $j$ (e.g., $j=-32m$), we can get the element $y$. Since $G^k$ contains both $\\langle x \\rangle$ and $y$, it must be the whole group $G$. So for any odd $k$, $G^k = Q_{128}$. This gives one distinct subgroup.\n\n2.  **Case 2: $k$ is even.**\n    Let $k=2m$. The generators of $G^k$ are $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$ and $(yx^i)^k = ((yx^i)^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{16k}$.\n    The subgroup $G^k$ is generated by $\\langle x^{ik} \\text{ for all } i \\rangle$ and $x^{16k}$.\n    The subgroup $\\langle x^{ik} \\text{ for all } i \\rangle$ is $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k,64)} \\rangle$.\n    So $G^k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)}, x^{16k} \\rangle$. Since $\\gcd(k,64)$ divides $k$, it also divides $16k$. Therefore $x^{16k}$ is already in $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k,64)} \\rangle$.\n    Thus, for even $k$, $G^k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Count the distinct subgroups:**\n    The distinct subgroups are determined by the possible values of $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ where $k$ is an even number.\n    Since $k$ is even, $d$ must be an even divisor of 64.\n    The divisors of 64 are $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n    The even divisors are $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n    Each of these values can be achieved. For example, $\\gcd(2,64)=2, \\gcd(4,64)=4, \\dots, \\gcd(64,64)=64$.\n    This gives 6 distinct subgroups: $\\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\langle x^{64} \\rangle=\\{1\\}$.\n\n4.  **Total Count:**\n    We have one subgroup from the odd $k$ case ($Q_{128}$) and six subgroups from the even $k$ cases.\n    The total number of distinct power subgroups of the form $G^k$ is $1 + 6 = 7$.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis under Interpretation C (Lower p-series).**\n\nFor $G=Q_{128}$, which is a 2-group, the lower 2-series is defined by $P_1=G, P_{i+1} = [P_i, G](P_i)^2$.\n*   $P_1 = Q_{128}$.\n*   $P_2 = [Q_{128}, Q_{128}](Q_{128})^2 = \\Phi(Q_{128}) = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n*   $P_3 = [P_2, G](P_2)^2 = [\\langle x^2 \\rangle, Q_{128}](\\langle x^2 \\rangle)^2$. The commutator is $[\\langle x^2 \\rangle, Q_{128}] = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$. The square is $(\\langle x^2 \\rangle)^2 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$. So $P_3 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$.\n*   Proceeding inductively, one can show that $P_i = \\langle x^{2^{i-1}} \\rangle$.\n*   The distinct subgroups in this series are:\n    $P_1 = Q_{128}$\n    $P_2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$\n    $P_3 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$\n    $P_4 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$\n    $P_5 = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$\n    $P_6 = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$\n    $P_7 = \\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$\nThe series becomes trivial after this. This gives a total of 7 distinct subgroups.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion.**\n\nInterpretations B and C, which consider \"power subgroup\" as a type of subgroup to be counted, both yield the same set of 7 distinct subgroups:\n$\\{Q_{128}, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}\\}$.\nThe phrasing of the question, \"How many power subgroups are there in...\", strongly suggests counting a type of subgroup, making these interpretations more likely than Interpretation A (which would be phrased differently, e.g., \"how many subgroups does the power subgroup contain?\"). The fact that two plausible definitions of \"power subgroup type\" lead to the same answer provides high confidence in this result.\n\nThe number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
