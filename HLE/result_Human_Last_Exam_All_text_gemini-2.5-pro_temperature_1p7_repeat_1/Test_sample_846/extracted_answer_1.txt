To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape in response to sunlight. At sunrise, when exposed to the sun's UV light, the table should bend or fold into a V-shape, mimicking the isomerization from the stable *trans* form to the less stable *cis* form. At sunset, in the absence of UV light, it must slowly straighten out or unfold, returning to its original, more elongated shape as the molecule thermally relaxes back to its stable *trans* form.
