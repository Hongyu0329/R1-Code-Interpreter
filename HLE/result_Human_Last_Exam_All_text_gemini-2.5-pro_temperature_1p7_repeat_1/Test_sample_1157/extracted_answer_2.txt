**Management Plan:**
1.  **Immediate Medical Stabilization:** Immediate referral to a physician to manage uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%) with medication. Provide tetanus prophylaxis and pain management.
2.  **Emergency Dental Care:** Clean and debride the sockets of the avulsed left lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar. Suture lacerations and prescribe antibiotics. Replantation is not an option after 28 hours.
3.  **Definitive Prosthodontic Treatment (Post-Medical Stabilization):** Once diabetes is controlled, proceed with replacing the missing teeth.

**Cells of Interest:**
*   **Periodontal Ligament (PDL) Cells:** Non-viable, precluding replantation.
*   **Osteoblasts and Fibroblasts:** Critical for socket healing, but their function is impaired by the patient's uncontrolled diabetes.
*   **Inflammatory Cells (Neutrophils, Macrophages):** Important for preventing infection, but compromised by hyperglycemia.

**Denture Replacement:**
*   **Denture Type and Material:** A **Removable Partial Denture** with a **cast Cobalt-Chromium metal framework** is the most appropriate choice due to its strength, hygiene, and ability to be tooth-supported, which is crucial for a patient with systemic health concerns.
*   **Abutment Teeth:** Left Central Incisor (#21), Left Second Premolar (#25), and Left First Molar (#26).
*   **Reasons for Abutment Choice:** This combination provides broad, stable, multi-point support. It distributes chewing forces effectively, which is essential to protect the remaining teeth, especially considering the patient's Class III skeletal pattern (SNB=88Â°) which can create heavy forces. Using the strong first molar as a posterior abutment provides excellent stability and reduces stress on the weaker anterior abutment (central incisor).
