    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of K.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Tensor\n\nThe problem defines a function from $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. This function can be viewed as a 3-tensor $T_n$ in the space $V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V^{\\otimes n}$, where $V$ is the space of functions from $\\{0,1\\}$ to $\\mathbb{C}$, i.e., $V=\\mathbb{C}^2$. The dimension of this tensor is $2^n \\times 2^n \\times 2^n$.\n\nThe function is given by:\n\\[ T_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1 \\]\nwhere $x=(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, $y=(y_1, \\dots, y_n)$, and $z=(z_1, \\dots, z_n)$ are vectors in $\\{0, 1\\}^n$.\n\nLet's define two related tensors:\n1.  The product part: $P_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$.\n2.  The all-ones tensor: $J_n(x, y, z) = 1$ for all $x,y,z$.\n\nSo, $T_n = P_n - J_n$.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding Slice Rank and Asymptotic Behavior\n\nThe slice rank of a 3-tensor is the smallest number of \"slices\" that sum up to the tensor. A slice is a tensor that can be written as a pure tensor in one of its modes, e.g., $u(x) A(y,z)$.\n\nThe problem states that the slice rank of $T_n$, denoted $SR(T_n)$, follows the asymptotic formula:\n\\[ SR(T_n) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2^K}\\right)^n e^{o(n)} \\]\nThe term $e^{o(n)}$ hides sub-exponential factors (like polynomials in $n$). The crucial part is the base of the exponent, which is the asymptotic slice rank.\n\\[ \\Theta_s(T_n) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (SR(T_n))^{1/n} = \\frac{3}{2^K} \\]\n\nOur goal is to compute this asymptotic slice rank $\\Theta_s(T_n)$.\n\n### Step 3: Relating the Tensors and their Ranks\n\nThe all-ones tensor $J_n$ can be written as $J_n(x,y,z) = u(x)v(y)w(z)$, where $u, v, w$ are the constant-one functions on $\\{0,1\\}^n$. This means $J_n$ is a rank-1 tensor, and its slice rank is 1.\n\nThe slice rank satisfies the triangle inequality $SR(A+B) \\le SR(A) + SR(B)$.\nSo, $SR(T_n) = SR(P_n - J_n) \\le SR(P_n) + SR(J_n) = SR(P_n) + 1$.\nAlso, $SR(P_n) = SR(T_n + J_n) \\le SR(T_n) + 1$.\nThis implies $|SR(T_n) - SR(P_n)| \\le 1$.\n\nWhen we consider the asymptotic behavior, this difference of 1 is insignificant for an exponentially growing function.\n\\[ \\Theta_s(T_n) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (SR(T_n))^{1/n} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (SR(P_n))^{1/n} = \\Theta_s(P_n) \\]\nSo we need to find the asymptotic slice rank of $P_n$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the structure of $P_n$\n\nThe tensor $P_n$ is a tensor power. Let $P_1$ be the base tensor for $n=1$.\n$P_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1+y_1+z_1$. This is a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor.\nThe tensor $P_n$ is the $n$-th tensor power of $P_1$: $P_n = P_1^{\\otimes n}$.\n\nThe asymptotic slice rank of a tensor power $T^{\\otimes n}$ is defined by $\\Theta_s(T) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} SR(T^{\\otimes n})^{1/n}$. For many well-behaved tensors, particularly small ones like $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensors over $\\mathbb{C}$, it is known that this limit exists and is equal to the slice rank of the base tensor, $SR(T)$.\nSo, $\\Theta_s(P_n) = \\Theta_s(P_1^{\\otimes n}) = SR(P_1)$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Slice Rank of the Base Tensor $P_1$\n\n$P_1$ is a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor defined by $P_1(x,y,z)=x+y+z$ for $x,y,z \\in \\{0,1\\}$. We can represent this tensor by its \"slices,\" which are matrices obtained by fixing one variable. Let's fix $x$:\n- For $x=0$, we get the matrix $M_0(y,z) = y+z$. In the standard basis, $M_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- For $x=1$, we get the matrix $M_1(y,z) = 1+y+z$. In the standard basis, $M_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor over an algebraically closed field like $\\mathbb{C}$, the slice rank is 3 if and only if the determinant of a generic linear combination of its slices is an irreducible polynomial. Otherwise, the slice rank is 1 or 2.\nLet's compute this determinant polynomial:\n$p(c_0, c_1) = \\det(c_0 M_0 + c_1 M_1) = \\det\\left(c_0 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + c_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}\\right)$\n$p(c_0, c_1) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} c_1 & c_0+2c_1 \\\\ c_0+2c_1 & 2c_0+3c_1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$p(c_0, c_1) = c_1(2c_0+3c_1) - (c_0+2c_1)^2 = (2c_0c_1 + 3c_1^2) - (c_0^2 + 4c_0c_1 + 4c_1^2)$\n$p(c_0, c_1) = -c_0^2 - 2c_0c_1 - c_1^2 = -(c_0+c_1)^2$.\n\nThis polynomial is reducible since it is a perfect square. The tensor $P_1$ is not rank-1 (its slices have rank 2), so its slice rank cannot be 1. Therefore, the slice rank of $P_1$ is 2.\n$SR(P_1)=2$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation of K\n\nCombining the results from the previous steps:\n1.  $\\Theta_s(T_n) = SR(P_1)$.\n2.  $SR(P_1) = 2$.\nSo, the asymptotic slice rank of the tensor $T_n$ is 2.\n$\\Theta_s(T_n) = 2$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n\\[ \\Theta_s(T_n) = \\frac{3}{2^K} \\]\nEquating the two expressions for the asymptotic slice rank:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{2^K} = 2 \\]\n\\[ 3 = 2 \\cdot 2^K \\]\n\\[ \\frac{3}{2} = 2^K \\]\nTaking the logarithm base 2 on both sides:\n\\[ K = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) \\]\n\nAn Alternative Interpretation:\nSometimes, in applied contexts, the term \"slice rank\" is informally used when \"tensor rank\" is meant. Let's explore this possibility as it often leads to cleaner answers in such problems.\n-   The tensor rank of $P_1(x,y,z)=x+y+z = x\\cdot 1\\cdot 1 + 1\\cdot y\\cdot 1 + 1\\cdot 1\\cdot z$ is 3 (this decomposition is optimal).\n-   The asymptotic tensor rank $\\underline{R}(P_1)$ is equal to $\\text{rank}(P_1)=3$.\n-   Following the same logic, $\\underline{R}(T_n) = \\underline{R}(P_n) = \\underline{R}(P_1)=3$.\n-   If the problem were about tensor rank, we would have $3 = 3/2^K$, which implies $2^K=1$, so $K=0$.\n\nHowever, the problem explicitly states \"slice rank.\" The distinction between tensor rank and slice rank is fundamental in this area of study. Sticking to the precise definitions:\n- The slice rank of $P_1$ is 2.\n- The asymptotic slice rank of $P_1^{\\otimes n}$ is 2.\n- The asymptotic slice rank of $T_n$ is 2.\nThis gives $K = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\nGiven that a specific numerical constant `3` is used in the question, the interpretation where `K=0` is tantalizing because it explains the presence of the `3` naturally as the asymptotic *tensor* rank. But this requires assuming a typo in the question (\"slice rank\" instead of \"tensor rank\"). If we do not assume a typo and follow the mathematical definitions strictly, the calculation of the asymptotic slice rank being 2 is robust. We equate this to the given expression.\n\nTherefore:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{2^K} = 2 \\implies 2^K = \\frac{3}{2} \\implies K = \\log_2(3/2). \\]\nThis can also be written as $\\log_2(3) - 1$.\n\n<<<log_2(3/2)>>>"
