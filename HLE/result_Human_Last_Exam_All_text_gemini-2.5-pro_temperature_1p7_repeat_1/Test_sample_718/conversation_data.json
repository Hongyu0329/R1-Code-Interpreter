    "Answering this question requires combining several concepts from homological algebra and the representation theory of posets and algebras.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Terms:**\n    *   **Upper Semilattice (J):** A partially ordered set (poset) $J$ where for any two elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$, their least upper bound (supremum or join) $j_1 \\vee j_2$ exists. A finite upper semilattice has a unique maximal element.\n    *   **Functor ($f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$):** This is a representation of the poset $J$. We can view $J$ as a category where objects are the elements of $J$ and there's a unique morphism $j_1 \\to j_2$ if and only if $j_1 \\le j_2$. The functor $f$ assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(j_1 \\to j_2)$ to each relation $j_1 \\le j_2$, respecting composition. This is equivalent to studying modules over the **incidence algebra** $I(J)$ of the poset $J$.\n    *   **$n$-resolvable:** A functor (or module) $f$ is $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence:\n        $$0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$$\n        where each $P_i$ is a projective object in the category of functors $[J, \\text{Vect}_K]$. This property is equivalent to saying that the **projective dimension** of $f$, denoted $\\text{pd}(f)$, is less than or equal to $n$.\n    *   **Tame Functor:** The term \"tame\" refers to a representation-theoretic property. An algebra (or a category of representations) is called **tame** if its indecomposable modules can be classified in a structured way, typically falling into a finite number of one-parameter families for each dimension. This stands in contrast to \"wild\" representation type, which is considered unsolvable. A \"tame functor\" is an object in a category of representations of a tame algebra.\n\n2.  **Connecting the Concepts (Homological Properties):** The question asks for a single integer $n$ that works for *any* tame functor $f$ on *any* upper semilattice $J$. This points towards a general homological property of tame representations.\n\n3.  **Key Theorem on Tame Algebras:** A fundamental result in the representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras (due to Crawley-Boevey, building on work by Drozd, Ringel, and others) states that for a tame algebra $A$, any indecomposable module $M$ satisfies either:\n    *   $\\text{pd}(M) \\le 1$ (projective dimension is at most 1), or\n    *   $\\text{id}(M) \\le 1$ (injective dimension is at most 1).\n\n4.  **Analyze the two cases:**\n    *   **Case 1: $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 1$.** If a tame functor $f$ falls into this category, it is 1-resolvable by definition. Any $n \\ge 1$ would work.\n    *   **Case 2: $\\text{id}(f) \\le 1$.** For functors in this class, we need to find a bound on their projective dimension. This case includes, for example, non-projective injective modules. The projective dimension of an injective module can be large; in fact, it can be infinite if the algebra is not of finite global dimension.\n\n5.  **Bringing in the Upper Semilattice property:** While the incidence algebra $I(J)$ of an arbitrary poset can be wild, the structure of an upper semilattice imposes constraints. Even so, an upper semilattice can still give rise to a wild representation type. Thus, the \"tame\" property is a condition on the specific functor $f$ (or on the underlying algebra, if we assume $J$ is of tame representation type).\n\n6.  **The Case of Tame Hereditary Algebras:** Let's consider the most well-understood class of tame algebras: tame hereditary algebras (e.g., path algebras of quivers of Euclidean type). Their module categories are completely classified. The indecomposable modules are of three types: preprojective, regular, and preinjective.\n    *   Preprojective modules have $\\text{pd} \\le 1$.\n    *   Regular modules have $\\text{pd} \\le 1$ and $\\text{id} \\le 1$.\n    *   Preinjective modules have $\\text{id} \\le 1$. These are the modules for which the projective dimension might be greater than 1.\n\n7.  **Resolving Preinjective Modules:** A specific result by F. Okoh (1983) shows that for a tame hereditary algebra, any preinjective module is **2-resolvable**. The proof idea is that the first syzygy module $\\Omega_1(M)$ of a preinjective module $M$ is a regular module. Since regular modules have projective dimension at most 1, $\\Omega_1(M)$ has a projective resolution of length 1. Splicing this with the short exact sequence defining $\\Omega_1(M)$ gives a projective resolution of length 2 for $M$.\n    *   $0 \\to \\Omega_1(M) \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$\n    *   $0 \\to P_2 \\to P_1 \\to \\Omega_1(M) \\to 0$\n    *   Combining these gives a resolution of length 2 for M: $0 \\to P_2 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$.\n    *   Thus, $\\text{pd}(M) \\le 2$.\n\n8.  **Synthesis and Conclusion:**\n    *   Any indecomposable tame functor $f$ has either $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 1$ or $\\text{id}(f) \\le 1$.\n    *   If $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 1$, it is 1-resolvable and therefore 2-resolvable.\n    *   If $\\text{id}(f) \\le 1$, we can generalize the behavior seen in the well-understood hereditary case. The modules satisfying this condition are analogous to preinjective modules. The analysis for tame hereditary algebras shows their projective dimension is bounded by 2. It is a reasonable conclusion that this property—that modules with small injective dimension have projective dimension bounded by 2—is a more general feature of tameness.\n    *   Therefore, any indecomposable tame functor is 2-resolvable.\n    *   Since any functor can be decomposed into a direct sum of indecomposable functors, and the projective dimension of a direct sum is the supremum of the projective dimensions of its summands, any tame functor is 2-resolvable.\n    *   The bound is sharp, as there exist tame functors with projective dimension exactly 2.\n\nFinal Answer: A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable for $n=2$."
