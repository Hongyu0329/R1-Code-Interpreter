    "This analysis breaks down the problem of creating a memory-efficient C program for case-insensitive string comparison.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Core Problem:** The goal is to compare two strings lexicographically, treating uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent (e.g., 'a' == 'A'). The strings are guaranteed to have the same length. The output should be -1, 1, or 0, representing \"less than\", \"greater than\", or \"equal\", respectively.\n\n2.  **Devising a Comparison Algorithm:** The standard way to compare strings lexicographically is character by character, from left to right.\n    *   Iterate from the first character to the last. Let's use an index `i`.\n    *   At each index `i`, get the character `c1` from the first string and `c2` from the second string.\n    *   For a case-insensitive comparison, convert both `c1` and `c2` to a common case, for example, lowercase, using the `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library. Let's call the results `lc1` and `lc2`.\n    *   If `lc1 < lc2`, the first string is smaller. The program should print \"-1\" and terminate.\n    *   If `lc1 > lc2`, the first string is larger. The program should print \"1\" and terminate.\n    *   If `lc1 == lc2`, the strings are equal up to this point, so the loop continues to the next character.\n    *   If the loop finishes without finding any differences, the strings are equal. The program should print \"0\".\n\n3.  **Considering Memory Efficiency:** The problem asks for the *most memory-efficient* C program. This prompts an analysis of variable memory allocation.\n    *   **A Standard Approach:** The most common method would be to read both input strings into two separate character arrays.\n        *   Input strings can have a length of up to 100. In C, a string requires an extra byte for the null terminator (`\\0`). Thus, two buffers of size 101 bytes each are needed.\n        *   `char str1[101];` (101 bytes)\n        *   `char str2[101];` (101 bytes)\n        *   An integer variable for the loop index, e.g., `int i;` (typically 4 bytes on modern systems).\n        *   Total memory for this approach: 101 + 101 + 4 = **206 bytes**.\n\n    *   **A More Memory-Efficient Approach:** To minimize memory, we should try to avoid declaring the second buffer (`str2`). This is feasible because the problem guarantees the strings are of equal length. We only need to store the first string to have something to compare against. The second string can be read one character at a time.\n        *   **Step 1:** Allocate one buffer for the first string: `char str1[101];`.\n        *   **Step 2:** Read the entire first string into `str1` using `scanf(\"%s\", str1)`.\n        *   **Step 3:** Read the second string character-by-character using `getchar()`. In each iteration of a loop, read one character and immediately compare it with the corresponding character in the stored `str1`.\n        *   This approach eliminates the need for the 101-byte buffer for the second string.\n\n4.  **Calculating Memory for the Efficient Approach:** Let's tally the memory required for variables in this optimized program.\n    *   `char str1[101];`: This buffer is necessary to store the first string for comparison. `sizeof(str1)` is 101 bytes.\n    *   `int i = 0;`: An index is needed to access characters in `str1` corresponding to the characters being read from the second input line. `sizeof(i)` is typically 4 bytes.\n    *   `int c2;`: A variable is needed to hold the character read by `getchar()`. The `getchar()` function returns an `int` (to be able to represent `EOF` in addition to all `char` values). `sizeof(c2)` is 4 bytes.\n    *   **Total Memory (m):** 101 bytes (`str1`) + 4 bytes (`i`) + 4 bytes (`c2`) = **109 bytes**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Buffer Sizing:** String buffers in C must be sized `length + 1` to hold the null terminator. A maximum length of 100 requires a buffer of size 101.\n*   **Input Method (`scanf` and `getchar`):** Using `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` reads the string but leaves the subsequent newline character (`\\n`) in the input buffer. When switching to `getchar()` to read the second line, this pending newline must be consumed first (e.g., with a `while(getchar() != '\\n');` loop) to avoid `getchar()` reading it immediately and terminating.\n*   **\"Same Length\" Guarantee:** The problem's guarantee that both strings have the same length is crucial. It simplifies the logic and ensures that the index `i` for `str1` will not go out of bounds while reading the second string character by character.\n*   **`sizeof(int)`:** The size of an `int` can be platform-dependent. However, on virtually all competitive programming platforms (which typically use 32-bit or 64-bit GCC on Linux), an `int` is 4 bytes. This is the standard assumption.\n*   **Conclusion:** The method that uses one string buffer and reads the second string character-by-character is demonstrably more memory-efficient than the two-buffer approach, making it the correct answer for this problem. The total memory for its variables, `m`, is 109 bytes.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe variables declared in the most memory-efficient C program are:\n1.  `char str1[101]` -> 101 bytes\n2.  `int i` -> 4 bytes\n3.  `int c2` -> 4 bytes\n\nTotal memory m = 101 + 4 + 4 = 109.\n\n<<<109>>>"
