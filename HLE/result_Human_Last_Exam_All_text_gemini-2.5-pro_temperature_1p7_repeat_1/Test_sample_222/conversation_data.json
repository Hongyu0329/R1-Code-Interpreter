    "This problem requires finding the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence. This is an unusual request, as an N-point DFT is typically performed on an N-point sequence. Performing a smaller DFT on a larger sequence results in time-domain aliasing.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Define the Sequences**\n*   We are given the 4-point DFTs of two 4-point sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n    *   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n*   We need to find the 4-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence `y(n)` which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n*   A careful point is to not assume this is a typo for an 8-point DFT. We must compute the 4-point DFT of this 8-point sequence `y(n)`.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the 4-point DFT of the 8-point Sequence `y(n)`**\nLet the desired 4-point DFT be `Y_4(k)`. The general DFT formula is `Y(k) = sum_{n=0}^{M-1} y(n) W_N^(nk)`, where `M` is the sequence length and `N` is the DFT size.\n*   Here, M=8 and N=4. `W_4 = e^(-j2Ï€/4) = -j`.\n*   `Y_4(k) = sum_{n=0}^{7} y(n) W_4^(nk)` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Concept of Time Aliasing**\nWe can split the summation into two parts:\n`Y_4(k) = sum_{n=0}^{3} y(n) W_4^(nk) + sum_{n=4}^{7} y(n) W_4^(nk)`\nThe twiddle factor `W_4^(nk)` is periodic in `n` with period 4. This means `W_4^((n+4)k) = W_4^(nk) * W_4^(4k) = W_4^(nk) * (W_4^4)^k = W_4^(nk) * 1^k = W_4^(nk)`.\nLet `m = n - 4` in the second sum. The sum becomes `sum_{m=0}^{3} y(m+4) W_4^((m+4)k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} y(m+4) W_4^(mk)`.\nCombining the two sums, we get:\n`Y_4(k) = sum_{n=0}^{3} (y(n) + y(n+4)) W_4^(nk)`\nThis means `Y_4(k)` is the 4-point DFT of a new 4-point sequence `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)`.\n\n**Step 4: Construct the Aliased Sequence `z(n)`**\nUsing the definitions `y(2m) = x(m)` and `y(2m+1) = h(m)`, we construct `z(n)`:\n*   `z(0) = y(0) + y(4) = x(0) + x(2)`\n*   `z(1) = y(1) + y(5) = h(0) + h(2)`\n*   `z(2) = y(2) + y(6) = x(1) + x(3)`\n*   `z(3) = y(3) + y(7) = h(1) + h(3)`\n\n**Step 5: Relate Components of `z(n)` to the Given DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`**\nWe can find expressions for the terms in `z(n)` using the properties of the 4-point DFT, without calculating the time-domain sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\nFor any 4-point sequence `f(n)` with DFT `F(k)`:\n`F(0) = f(0) + f(1) + f(2) + f(3)`\n`F(2) = f(0) - f(1) + f(2) - f(3)`\nAdding these two equations gives: `F(0) + F(2) = 2(f(0) + f(2))`.\nSubtracting them gives: `F(0) - F(2) = 2(f(1) + f(3))`.\nFrom this, we get:\n*   `f(0) + f(2) = (F(0) + F(2)) / 2`\n*   `f(1) + f(3) = (F(0) - F(2)) / 2`\n\nApplying this to `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n*   `z(0) = x(0) + x(2) = (X(0) + X(2)) / 2`\n*   `z(2) = x(1) + x(3) = (X(0) - X(2)) / 2`\n*   `z(1) = h(0) + h(2) = (H(0) + H(2)) / 2`\n*   `z(3) = h(1) + h(3) = (H(0) - H(2)) / 2`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate `Y_4(k)` as the DFT of an Interleaved Sequence**\nThe aliased sequence `z(n)` can be seen as an interleaving of two 2-point sequences: `a(n) = {z(0), z(2)}` and `b(n) = {z(1), z(3)}`.\n`z(n) = {a(0), b(0), a(1), b(1)}`.\nThe DFT `Y_4(k)` can be expressed using the decimation-in-time principle:\n`Y_4(k) = A(k mod 2) + W_4^k * B(k mod 2)`, where `A(k)` and `B(k)` are the 2-point DFTs of `a(n)` and `b(n)`.\n\n*   `A(k) = DFT_2{a(n)} = DFT_2{(X(0)+X(2))/2, (X(0)-X(2))/2}`\n    `A(0) = a(0) + a(1) = (X(0)+X(2))/2 + (X(0)-X(2))/2 = X(0)`\n    `A(1) = a(0) - a(1) = (X(0)+X(2))/2 - (X(0)-X(2))/2 = X(2)`\n    So, `A(k) = {X(0), X(2)}`.\n\n*   `B(k) = DFT_2{b(n)} = DFT_2{(H(0)+H(2))/2, (H(0)-H(2))/2}`\n    `B(0) = b(0) + b(1) = H(0)`\n    `B(1) = b(0) - b(1) = H(2)`\n    So, `B(k) = {H(0), H(2)}`.\n\nNow, we can find `Y_4(k)`:\n*   `Y_4(0) = A(0) + W_4^0 * B(0) = X(0) + H(0)`\n*   `Y_4(1) = A(1) + W_4^1 * B(1) = X(2) + (-j) * H(2)`\n*   `Y_4(2) = A(0) + W_4^2 * B(0) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0) = X(0) - H(0)`\n*   `Y_4(3) = A(1) + W_4^3 * B(1) = X(2) + (j) * H(2)`\n\n**Step 7: Substitute Numerical Values and Find the Final Answer**\nGiven `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`, we have `X(0) = 1` and `X(2) = -1`.\nGiven `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`, we have `H(0) = 0` and `H(2) = 1`.\n\n*   `Y_4(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n*   `Y_4(1) = -1 - j * (1) = -1 - j`\n*   `Y_4(2) = 1 - 0 = 1`\n*   `Y_4(3) = -1 + j * (1) = -1 + j`\n\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is `[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
