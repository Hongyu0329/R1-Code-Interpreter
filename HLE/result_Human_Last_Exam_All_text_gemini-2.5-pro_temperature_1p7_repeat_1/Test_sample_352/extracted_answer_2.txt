The best replacement would be to mutate all four amino acids at positions 47, 48, 49, and 50 to Alanine (A). This would change the native Ser-Glu-Glu-Asp (S-E-E-D) sequence to an Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala (A-A-A-A) sequence. This approach effectively removes the negative charges from the acidic residues and prevents phosphorylation at position 47, directly testing the hypothesis that the negative charge of this patch is responsible for autoinhibition with minimal structural perturbation.
