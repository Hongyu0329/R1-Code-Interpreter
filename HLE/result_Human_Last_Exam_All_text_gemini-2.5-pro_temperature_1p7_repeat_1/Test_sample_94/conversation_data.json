    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question into key informational clues.**\nThe question is asking for the name of a specific physicist. The clues provided are:\n1.  **Profession:** Physicist.\n2.  **Primary Field of Fame:** Microscopy.\n3.  **Discovery:** An optical effect related to real imagery.\n4.  **Origin of Discovery:** It was initially observed accidentally by a non-scientist, a custodial worker.\n5.  **Equipment Involved:** The observation was made while cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each clue to narrow down the possibilities.**\n*   **\"Physicist better known for work in the microscopy field\"**: This points to major figures in the history of microscopy, especially those who contributed to the underlying physics and optics. Candidates could include Ernst Abbe (diffraction limit), or Frits Zernike (phase-contrast microscope).\n*   **\"Discovered an optical effect\"**: This is the core of the physicist's contribution. Ernst Abbe's work was foundational theory. Frits Zernike discovered a specific, novel effect he named \"phase contrast.\"\n*   **\"In real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors\"**: This is a very specific anecdote. We need to find which physicist's discovery story matches this unusual detail. Concave mirrors are used in many optical instruments, including reflecting telescopes and certain types of spectrographs.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the clues and research the anecdote.**\nThe story about an accidental discovery involving a cleaner and optical equipment is most famously associated with Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike**.\n*   Zernike was working with a concave diffraction grating, which is essentially a specialized concave mirror with finely ruled lines, used in a spectrograph.\n*   He was studying imperfections in these gratings that produced faint, secondary images called \"grating ghosts.\" These are the \"real imagery\" mentioned in the question.\n*   The anecdote, though possibly embellished over time, states that a janitor cleaning the grating accidentally made dust particles highly visible. When Zernike investigated why these tiny transparent dust particles appeared so clearly, he realized that the light scattered by the dust was out of phase with the background light.\n*   This observation led him to the fundamental insight that invisible differences in the phase of light waves (which occur when light passes through transparent objects like living cells) could be converted into visible differences in brightness.\n\n**Step 4: Final verification.**\n*   Is Frits Zernike a physicist? Yes.\n*   Is he better known for work in microscopy? Yes, he won the 1953 Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope, a revolutionary tool in biology and medicine.\n*   Did he discover an optical effect (phase contrast) connected to an observation with a concave mirror (concave grating)? Yes.\n*   Is his discovery linked to an accidental observation by a custodial worker? Yes, this is the widely told story of the discovery's origin.\n\nAll clues point directly to Frits Zernike.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
