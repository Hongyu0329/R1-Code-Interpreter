    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks to identify a specific film based on four key details:\n    *   It must be an Oscar-nominated film.\n    *   It contains a scene where a character is boarding a bus.\n    *   In this scene, the character says the words \"Thank you.\"\n    *   This act of saying \"Thank you\" is a pivotal moment that \"seals his fate,\" implying it directly leads to a significant, likely fatal, outcome for that character.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Films and Scenes:** The combination of \"bus,\" a fateful \"thank you,\" and an Oscar nomination points toward a memorable scene in a critically acclaimed thriller or drama. The specific action is a taunt, which narrows down the possibilities. This leads to the film *L.A. Confidential* (1997).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specific Scene in *L.A. Confidential***:\n    *   **Context:** Lieutenant Ed Exley (played by Guy Pearce) is pursuing a group of suspects in the \"Nite Owl\" coffee shop massacre.\n    *   **The Character:** One of the suspects, Ray Collins (played by Jeremiah Birkett), breaks away and runs during the pursuit.\n    *   **The Action:** Collins manages to get onto a departing city bus, seemingly making a successful escape. Lt. Exley has his gun drawn but initially hesitates to shoot a fleeing man on a bus full of civilians.\n    *   **The Fateful Moment:** As the bus pulls away, Collins looks back at Exley through the window. With a smirk, he mockingly mouths the words \"Thank you.\" This taunt acts as a non-verbal confession and a challenge to Exley's authority.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Consequence (\"Seals his Fate\"):**\n    *   Collins's gloating infuriates Exley and erases any hesitation he had.\n    *   Provoked by the \"Thank you,\" Exley runs alongside the moving bus, takes aim, and shoots Collins dead through the window.\n    *   Therefore, Collins's act of saying \"Thank you\" directly and immediately caused his death, literally sealing his fate. This action also has profound consequences for Exley's career and conscience.\n\n5.  **Verify the Oscar Nomination Criterion:**\n    *   *L.A. Confidential* was a major critical success. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1998, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. It won two Oscars: Best Supporting Actress (for Kim Basinger) and Best Adapted Screenplay. This firmly satisfies the \"Oscar-nominated film\" requirement.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The exact words:** The character doesn't just express gratitude; he uses \"Thank you\" as a taunt, which is the key to why it seals his fate.\n*   **The setting:** The public nature of the bus boarding is crucial. Exley's initial hesitation and subsequent violent action in front of civilians are central to the scene's impact.\n*   **The \"fate\":** The consequence is not ambiguous; it is immediate death, making the connection between the action and the outcome explicit.\n*   **Oscar nominations vs. wins:** The question requires the film to be *nominated*, which *L.A. Confidential* certainly was. The fact that it also won is further confirmation of its prestige but not strictly necessary to answer the question.\n\nBased on this analysis, the film that matches all the criteria in the question is *L.A. Confidential*.\n\n<<<L.A. Confidential>>>"
