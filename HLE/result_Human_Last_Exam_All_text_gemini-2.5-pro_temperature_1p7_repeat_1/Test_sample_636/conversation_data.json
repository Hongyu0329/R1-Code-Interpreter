    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain `F`.\n\n**1. Define the System and the Goal**\n\n*   We are given the state matrix `A` and the input matrix `B`:\n    `A = [-1, 1; 1, 0]`\n    `B = [1, 2; 1, 0]`\n*   We want to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system matrix `A_cl = A + BF` has its eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**Careful Point:** Note that the closed-loop system is defined as `A + BF`, not the more conventional `A - BF`. We must follow the problem statement precisely.\n\n**2. Check for Controllability**\n\n*   Before attempting to place the poles (eigenvalues), we should confirm the system is controllable. A system is controllable if its controllability matrix has full rank (rank 2 in this case). The controllability matrix `C` is given by `C = [B, AB]`.\n*   Calculate `AB`:\n    `AB = [-1, 1; 1, 0] * [1, 2; 1, 0] = [(-1*1 + 1*1), (-1*2 + 1*0); (1*1 + 0*1), (1*2 + 0*0)] = [0, -2; 1, 2]`\n*   Construct `C`:\n    `C = [B, AB] = [1, 2, 0, -2; 1, 0, 1, 2]`\n*   To check if `C` has rank 2, we only need to find two linearly independent columns. Let's examine the matrix `B` itself.\n    `det(B) = det([1, 2; 1, 0]) = 1*0 - 2*1 = -2`\n*   Since `det(B)` is non-zero, the columns of `B` are linearly independent, and `rank(B) = 2`. Therefore, the system is controllable, and pole placement is possible.\n\n**3. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\n*   The desired eigenvalues are `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`.\n*   The desired characteristic polynomial, `p(λ)`, is formed from these eigenvalues:\n    `p(λ) = (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)`\n    `p(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n    `p(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n    `p(λ) = (λ + 1)² - j² = λ² + 2λ + 1 - (-1) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\n*   So, the target characteristic equation is `λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n**4. Formulate the Closed-Loop System's Characteristic Polynomial**\n\n*   Let the feedback gain matrix `F` be a general 2x2 matrix:\n    `F = [f₁, f₂; f₃, f₄]`\n*   Calculate the term `BF`:\n    `BF = [1, 2; 1, 0] * [f₁, f₂; f₃, f₄] = [f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄; f₁, f₂]`\n*   Calculate the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n    `A_cl = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄; f₁, f₂] = [-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄; 1 + f₁, f₂]`\n*   The characteristic polynomial of a 2x2 matrix `M = [a, b; c, d]` is `λ² - tr(M)λ + det(M) = 0`.\n    *   Trace of `A_cl`: `tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃) + f₂ = f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1`\n    *   Determinant of `A_cl`: `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃)f₂ - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁)`\n      `= -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄)`\n      `= -1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄`\n*   The characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is:\n    `λ² - (f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1)λ + (-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄) = 0`\n    This can be rewritten as:\n    `λ² + (1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃)λ + (-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄) = 0`\n\n**5. Solve for the Elements of F**\n\n*   Now, we equate the coefficients of this polynomial with our desired polynomial `λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n    *   Matching the `λ` coefficients:\n        `1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃ = 2`\n        `f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1`  (Equation 1)\n    *   Matching the constant terms:\n        `-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₂f₃ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 2` (Equation 2)\n\n**Careful Point:** We have two equations and four unknowns (`f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄`). This indicates that there is no unique solution for `F`. This is expected for multi-input systems. We have the freedom to choose values for two of the variables to simplify the problem.\n\n*   Let's make a simple choice: `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`.\n*   Now, our equations simplify:\n    *   Equation 1 becomes: `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n    *   Equation 2 becomes: `-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ = 2`  => `f₁ + 2f₂ = -3`\n*   We now have a simple system of two linear equations:\n    1.  `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n    2.  `f₁ + 2f₂ = -3`\n*   Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n    `(f₁ + 2f₂) - (f₁ + f₂) = -3 - (-1)`\n    `f₂ = -2`\n*   Substitute `f₂ = -2` back into Equation 1:\n    `f₁ + (-2) = -1`\n    `f₁ = 1`\n*   So, with our choice of `f₃=0` and `f₄=0`, we find `f₁=1` and `f₂=-2`.\n\n**6. State the Final Answer**\n\n*   The calculated state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n    `F = [1, -2; 0, 0]`\n\nWe can verify this result.\n`A_cl = A + BF = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [1, 2; 1, 0][1, -2; 0, 0] = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [1, -2; 1, -2] = [0, -1; 2, -2]`\nEigenvalues of `A_cl` are found from `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`:\n`det([λ, 1; -2, λ+2]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0`\nThe roots are `λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4-8))/2 = -1 ± j`. The result is correct.\n\n<<<[1, -2; 0, 0]>>>"
