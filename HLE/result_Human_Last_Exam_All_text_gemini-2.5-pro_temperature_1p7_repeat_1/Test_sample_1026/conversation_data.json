    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System and Principles**\n    *   The system consists of a mass `m` and a guide `M`.\n    *   The guide rests on a frictionless horizontal plane, which means there are no external horizontal forces acting on the system (mass + guide).\n    *   Due to the absence of external horizontal forces, the total horizontal momentum of the system is conserved. A direct consequence of this is that the horizontal position of the center of mass (CM) of the system remains constant throughout the motion.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Displacement Equation from CM Conservation**\n    *   Let `Œîx_m` be the horizontal displacement of the mass `m` in the lab frame.\n    *   Let `ŒîX_G` be the horizontal displacement of the guide `M` in the lab frame.\n    *   Since the horizontal position of the CM of the system is constant, the following equation holds:\n        `m * Œîx_m + M * ŒîX_G = 0`\n    *   The displacement of the mass `m` in the lab frame (`Œîx_m`) is the sum of the displacement of the guide (`ŒîX_G`) and the displacement of the mass relative to the guide (`Œîx_m,rel`):\n        `Œîx_m = ŒîX_G + Œîx_m,rel`\n    *   Substituting this into the CM equation:\n        `m * (ŒîX_G + Œîx_m,rel) + M * ŒîX_G = 0`\n        `(m + M) * ŒîX_G + m * Œîx_m,rel = 0`\n    *   Solving for the displacement of the guide `ŒîX_G`:\n        `ŒîX_G = - (m / (m + M)) * Œîx_m,rel`\n    *   Our goal is now to find `Œîx_m,rel`, the horizontal displacement of the mass *relative to the guide*.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Motion: The \"First Half-Oscillation\"**\n    *   The motion starts when `m` is released from rest at the top of the first curve (height `R`). The guide is also at rest. So, the initial total kinetic energy of the system is zero.\n    *   The \"first half-oscillation\" ends when the mass `m` reaches its maximum height `h` on the second curve. At this turning point, the mass `m` is momentarily at rest relative to the guide. Since the total horizontal momentum must remain zero (as it was initially), the entire system must be momentarily at rest. Therefore, the final total kinetic energy is also zero.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Height `h` using the Work-Energy Theorem**\n    *   Since the initial and final kinetic energies are zero, the change in the system's mechanical energy is solely due to the change in potential energy, which must be equal to the work done by the non-conservative friction force.\n    *   Initial Mechanical Energy: `E_i = K_i + U_i = 0 + m*g*R`\n    *   Final Mechanical Energy: `E_f = K_f + U_f = 0 + m*g*h`\n    *   Work done by friction (`W_f`): Friction only acts on the straight section of length `d`. The friction force is `F_f = Œº_D * N = Œº_D * m * g`. The work done by this force is negative as it opposes the motion. The energy dissipated is the force multiplied by the relative sliding distance `d`.\n        `W_f = -F_f * d = -Œº_D * m * g * d`\n    *   Applying the Work-Energy Theorem (`ŒîE = W_f`):\n        `E_f - E_i = W_f`\n        `mgh - mgR = -Œº_D * m * g * d`\n    *   Dividing by `mg`, we get:\n        `h - R = -Œº_D * d`  =>  `h = R - Œº_D * d`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Relative Horizontal Displacement `Œîx_m,rel`**\n    *   We need to find the horizontal distance the mass `m` travels in the guide's own reference frame.\n    *   Let's define a coordinate `x'` along the guide's horizontal axis, with `x'=0` at the starting point A.\n    *   The mass moves across three sections:\n        1.  First quarter-arc: horizontal projection is `R`.\n        2.  Straight section: horizontal projection is `d`.\n        3.  Second quarter-arc: the mass moves up to a height `h`. The horizontal projection for this part can be found from the circle's equation. For a quarter-circle of radius `R`, the horizontal position `x''` from its start and vertical position `y''` are related by `x''^2 + y''^2 = R^2` (if starting from vertical). This is incorrect geometry. The correct geometry is that from the start of the curve, the horizontal distance is `sqrt(R^2 - (R-y')^2)` if height `y'` is measured from the bottom. Let's use a simpler relation. Let `x_curve2` be the horizontal travel on the second curve. The curve's equation is `x_curve2^2 + h^2 = R^2`, if we place the origin at the center of curvature. A more direct geometrical way: for a path along a circular arc of radius `R` that climbs to a height `h` from the bottom, the horizontal distance covered along the arc is `sqrt(R^2 - (R-h)^2)`. Wait, the equation is `(Œîx)^2 + h^2 = R^2` is for a chord. Path on a circle: `(x')^2 + (y')^2 = R^2`. Let `y'=h`. Then the horizontal position relative to the start of that curve is `sqrt(R^2 - h^2)`.\n    *   The total relative horizontal displacement is the sum of the horizontal projections:\n        `Œîx_m,rel = (horizontal projection of curve 1) + (length of straight section) + (horizontal projection of curve 2)`\n        The geometry for the curves going from y=R to y=0 and then y=0 to y=h is simpler. The horizontal distance covered during the first descent is `R`. The horizontal distance covered during the final ascent to height `h` is `sqrt(R^2 - (R-h)^2)`. NO, that's wrong. For a quarter circle of radius R, the horizontal distance from the start of the curve (x'=R+d) to a point at height y'=h is given by `(x_f' - (R+d))^2 + h^2 = R^2`. Thus `x_f' = R+d + sqrt(R^2-h^2)`.\n    *   `Œîx_m,rel = (final relative position) - (initial relative position)`\n        `Œîx_m,rel = (R + d + sqrt(R^2 - h^2)) - 0`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **CM Conservation:** This is the core principle. It applies only because the external horizontal force is zero (frictionless plane).\n2.  **Energy Non-Conservation:** Do not assume mechanical energy is conserved. The friction on the straight part dissipates energy.\n3.  **Turning Points:** The interpretation of \"half-oscillation\" as the motion between two turning points (where velocity is zero) is crucial for simplifying the energy calculation.\n4.  **Relative vs. Absolute Motion:** Be careful to distinguish displacements in the lab frame from those relative to the moving guide. The key formula connects these two frames.\n5.  **Geometry:** The horizontal distance traveled by the mass on the final curved section needs to be calculated correctly using the Pythagorean theorem on the right triangle formed by the radius `R`, the final height `h`, and the horizontal distance from the center of curvature.\n6.  **Units:** Ensure all units are consistent (e.g., convert all lengths to meters).\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n**Given:**\n*   `m = 0.20 kg`\n*   `M = 0.80 kg`\n*   `R = 20 cm = 0.20 m`\n*   `d = 50 cm = 0.50 m`\n*   `Œº_D = 0.20`\n\n**Step A: Calculate the final height `h`**\n`h = R - Œº_D * d = 0.20 m - (0.20 * 0.50 m) = 0.20 m - 0.10 m = 0.10 m`\n\n**Step B: Calculate the relative horizontal displacement `Œîx_m,rel`**\nThe final position relative to the start is `x'_f = R + d + sqrt(R^2 - h^2)`\n`Œîx_m,rel = 0.20 m + 0.50 m + sqrt((0.20 m)^2 - (0.10 m)^2)`\n`Œîx_m,rel = 0.70 m + sqrt(0.04 m^2 - 0.01 m^2)`\n`Œîx_m,rel = 0.70 m + sqrt(0.03 m^2)`\n`Œîx_m,rel = 0.70 m + 0.1732 m = 0.8732 m`\n\n**Step C: Calculate the guide's displacement `ŒîX_G`**\n`ŒîX_G = - (m / (m + M)) * Œîx_m,rel`\n`ŒîX_G = - (0.20 kg / (0.20 kg + 0.80 kg)) * 0.8732 m`\n`ŒîX_G = - (0.20 / 1.00) * 0.8732 m`\n`ŒîX_G = -0.20 * 0.8732 m = -0.17464 m`\n\nThe question asks for the horizontal displacement. The negative sign indicates the direction is to the left (opposite to the mass's net motion). The magnitude of the displacement is `0.17464 m`. Rounding to two significant figures consistent with the input data gives `0.17 m`.\n\nConverting to centimeters: `0.17464 m = 17.464 cm`.\n\nThe displacement is **-0.17 m** or **17 cm** to the left. As a magnitude, the value is 0.17 m.\n\n<<<0.17"
