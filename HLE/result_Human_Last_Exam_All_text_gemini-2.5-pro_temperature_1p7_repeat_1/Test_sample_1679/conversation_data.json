    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Luxor Obelisks and their locations.\nA \"Luxor Obelisk\" can refer to one of two ancient Egyptian obelisks carved in Luxor.\n*   One remains in its original location, standing at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The second was transported to France in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\nTherefore, the film in question must feature a scene in either Luxor, Egypt (at the temple) or Paris, France (at the Place de la Concorde).\n\n### Step 2: Create a chronological list of Best Picture winners and analyze their settings.\nWe will go through the winners year by year, looking for the first one with a qualifying scene.\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:**\n    *   **_Wings_** (1927/1928): Features celebratory scenes in Paris after WWI, but there is no famous or confirmed shot of the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   **_The Life of Emile Zola_** (1937): This film is set in Paris. However, it was primarily shot on studio backlots, a common practice for the era. Its key scenes take place in courtrooms, offices, and at the Ã‰cole Militaire for Dreyfus's degradation. There is no confirmed, clear depiction of the Luxor Obelisk in this film.\n\n*   **1940s:**\n    *   **_Casablanca_** (1942): Features famous flashback scenes in Paris. However, these scenes show other landmarks like the Arc de Triomphe and the Seine, but not the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk.\n    *   Other winners from this decade are set elsewhere (England, the US, Wales, etc.).\n\n*   **1950s:** This decade features several Best Picture winners set in Paris. We must identify the earliest one.\n    *   **_An American in Paris_** (1951): This musical is a celebration of the city of Paris. The film's climactic 17-minute ballet sequence features elaborate, stylized sets representing famous Parisian locations and painters. The section inspired by artist Raoul Dufy is explicitly set in the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk being a clear and central element of the scenery. This is a definitive depiction.\n    *   **_Around the World in 80 Days_** (1956): The film's global journey begins in London and includes a stop in Paris, where landmarks are shown. However, this film won five years after _An American in Paris_.\n    *   **_Gigi_** (1958): This musical was largely filmed on location in Paris and features many landmarks, including the Place de la Concorde. It also came after _An American in Paris_.\n\n*   **Films set in Egypt:** No film that has won Best Picture is known for featuring scenes at the Luxor Temple in Egypt. Epics like _Ben-Hur_ are set primarily in Judea and Rome, while _Lawrence of Arabia_ is set in other parts of Egypt (Cairo, Suez) and the Arabian Peninsula. _Cleopatra_ (1963), which did feature ancient Egyptian settings, lost the Best Picture award.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion.\nComparing the candidates, _The Life of Emile Zola_ (1937) is the earliest winner set in Paris, but a depiction of the obelisk is unconfirmed and unlikely given its production style. The first **confirmed and clear depiction** of a Luxor Obelisk appears in **_An American in Paris_** (1951). Its iconic ballet sequence leaves no doubt that the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk are shown on-screen.\n\nTherefore, _An American in Paris_ is the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
