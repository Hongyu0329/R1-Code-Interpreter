    "An involution in a group is a non-identity element that is its own inverse. We are looking for the number of elements `x` in the projective special unitary group `G = PSU(4, 997)` such that `x^2 = 1` and `x \\neq 1`.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Involutions in PSU(n, q) to SU(n, q)\nThe group `PSU(4, 997)` is the quotient group `SU(4, 997) / Z`, where `Z = Z(SU(4, 997))` is the center of the special unitary group `SU(4, 997)`.\nAn element `x = gZ` in `PSU(4, 997)` (where `g \\in SU(4, 997)`) is an involution if `x \\neq 1` and `x^2 = 1`.\nThis translates to `gZ \\neq Z` and `(gZ)^2 = Z`.\n- `gZ \\neq Z` means `g \\notin Z`.\n- `(gZ)^2 = g^2 Z = Z` means `g^2 \\in Z`.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Center Z\nThe center `Z` of `SU(n, q)` consists of scalar matrices `λI` such that:\n1. `λI \\in U(n, q)` which means `λ λ_bar = λ^{q+1} = 1`.\n2. `det(λI) = λ^n = 1`.\nFor `SU(4, 997)`, we have `n=4` and `q=997`. `Z` consists of `λI` where `λ^{998} = 1` and `λ^4 = 1`.\nThe order of the center is `|Z| = gcd(4, 998)`. Since `998 = 2 \\times 499` and `4 = 2^2`, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nThe two elements `λ` are `1` and `-1`. Thus, the center is `Z = \\{I, -I\\}`.\n\n### Step 3: Characterize Pre-images g\nThe condition on `g \\in SU(4, 997)` is that `g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}` and `g^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}`. This separates the problem into two disjoint cases for the pre-images `g`:\n- Case A: `g^2 = I` and `g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}`.\n- Case B: `g^2 = -I`. (Note that if `g^2=-I`, `g` cannot be `I` or `-I`, as `(\\pm I)^2 = I`).\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Case A (`g^2 = I`)\nThe elements `g` are involutions in `SU(4, 997)`. An element in `SU(n, q)` is diagonalizable. If `g^2=I`, its eigenvalues are `+1` or `-1`. For `g \\in SU(n, q)`, the product of eigenvalues must be 1. This means the number of `-1` eigenvalues, let's call it `k`, must be even.\nFor `n=4`, `k` can be 0, 2, or 4.\n- `k=0`: `g=I`. This is in `Z`, so we exclude it.\n- `k=4`: `g` is conjugate to `-I`. Since `-I` is central, `g=-I`. This is in `Z`, so we exclude it.\n- `k=2`: `g` is conjugate to `diag(-1, -1, 1, 1)`. These elements are not in `Z`. Let `C_2` be this conjugacy class.\nThe set of pre-images from Case A is `C_2`.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze Case B (`g^2 = -I`)\nIf `g^2 = -I`, the eigenvalues `λ` of `g` must be roots of `x^2+1=0`, which we denote as `\\pm i`. For `g \\in U(n,q)`, its eigenvalues `λ` must satisfy `λ^{q+1}=1`. In `F_{q^2}`, the Frobenius conjugate `λ^q` of `i` is `-i`. So `λ^{q+1} = i^{q+1} = i^q \\cdot i = (-i)i = -i^2 = 1`. This condition is satisfied.\nFor `g \\in SU(4, q)`, `det(g)=1`. Let `m` be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue `i`. Then `det(g) = i^m(-i)^{4-m} = (-1)^{4-m} = (-1)^m`. For `det(g)=1`, `m` must be even. Possible values for `m` are 0, 2, 4.\n- `m=0`: `g` is conjugate to `-iI`. This forms a class `D_0 = \\{-iI\\}` of size 1.\n- `m=4`: `g` is conjugate to `iI`. This forms a class `D_4 = \\{iI\\}` of size 1.\n- `m=2`: `g` is conjugate to `diag(i, i, -i, -i)`. Let this class be `D_2`.\nThe set of pre-images from Case B is `B = D_0 \\cup D_2 \\cup D_4`.\n\n### Step 6: Count the Resulting Involutions in PSU(4, 997)\nThe number of involutions is the number of distinct cosets `gZ` formed by the pre-images `g`. A coset `gZ` is the set `{g, -g}`.\n1.  **Cosets from Case A**: For any `g \\in C_2`, `-g` is also in `C_2` and `g \\ne -g`. So the set `C_2` is partitioned into `|C_2|/2` pairs of the form `{g, -g}`. Each pair forms a single involution in `PSU`. This gives `|C_2|/2` involutions.\n2.  **Cosets from Case B**: For any `g \\in B`, `-g` is also in `B` (since `(-g)^2=g^2=-I`).\n    - The elements of `D_2` are non-central and for each `g \\in D_2`, `g \\ne -g` and `-g \\in D_2`. This gives `|D_2|/2` cosets.\n    - The elements from `D_0 \\cup D_4` are `iI` and `-iI`. They form a single coset `{iI, -iI}`. This gives 1 coset.\nThe total number of involutions from Case B is `|D_2|/2 + 1`.\n\nThe total number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is the sum from both cases: `(|C_2|/2) + (|D_2|/2 + 1)`.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Conjugacy Class Sizes\nWe need to calculate `|C_2|` and `|D_2|`. The size of a conjugacy class of `g` is `|SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU(4, q)}(g)|`.\nThe centralizer of `diag(-1,-1,1,1)` in `U(4,q)` is `U(2,q) \\times U(2,q)`.\nThe centralizer of `diag(i,i,-i,-i)` in `U(4,q)` is also `U(2,q) \\times U(2,q)`.\nThus, their centralizers in `SU(4,q)` have the same size, which implies `|C_2| = |D_2|`.\n\n`|C_2| = |SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU(4, q)}(diag(-1, -1, 1, 1))|`\n`|SU(n, q)| = q^{n(n-1)/2} \\prod_{i=2}^{n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`\n`|SU(4, q)| = q^6 (q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`\n`|C_{SU(4, q)}(g)| = (q+1)|SU(2, q)|^2 = (q+1)(q(q^2-1))^2 = (q+1)q^2(q^2-1)^2`\n\n`|C_2| = \\frac{q^6 (q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q+1)q^2(q^2-1)^2} = \\frac{q^4 (q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)}`\nUsing `q^3+1=(q+1)(q^2-q+1)` and `q^4-1=(q^2-1)(q^2+1)`:\n`|C_2| = \\frac{q^4 (q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`\n\n### Step 8: Final Calculation\nTotal number of involutions = `|C_2| + 1 = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + 1`.\nWe can expand this expression:\n`N(q) = q^4(q^4 - q^3 + q^2 + q^2 - q + 1) + 1 = q^4(q^4 - q^3 + 2q^2 - q + 1) + 1`\n`N(q) = q^8 - q^7 + 2q^6 - q^5 + q^4 + 1`.\n\nFor `q = 997`:\n`N(997) = 997^4 (997^2 - 997 + 1)(997^2 + 1) + 1`\n`997^2 = 994009`\n`N(997) = 997^4 (994009 - 997 + 1)(994009 + 1) + 1`\n`N(997) = 997^4 (993013)(994010) + 1`\n`N(997) = (988047904321) \\times (993013) \\times (994010) + 1`\n`N(997) = (988047904321) \\times (987053073130) + 1`\n`N(997) = 9752445889393347039579130 + 1`\n`N(997) = 9752445889393347039579131`\n\nThe number of involutions is `q^8 - q^7 + 2q^6 - q^5 + q^4 + 1` where `q = 997`.\n\n`997^4 \\approx (9.88 \\times 10^{11})`\n`993013 \\times 994010 \\approx (9.87 \\times 10^{11})`\nResult is approximately `9.75 \\times 10^{23}`. The precise value is:\n`975,244,588,939,334,703,957,931`.\n\nFinal expression is `997^8 - 997^7 + 2 \\cdot 997^6 - 997^5 + 997^4 + 1`."
