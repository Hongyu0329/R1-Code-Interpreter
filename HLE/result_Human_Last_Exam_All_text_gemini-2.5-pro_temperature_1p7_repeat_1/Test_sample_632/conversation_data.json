    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a \"unique architectural feature\" that was part of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome, and was removed in the year \"1950\".\n\n2.  **Initial Research on Piazza della Rotonda's History:** The Piazza della Rotonda is dominated by the Pantheon and the Fontana del Pantheon (fountain with an obelisk). A historical search for major architectural changes to the square is necessary.\n\n3.  **Identify the Most Famous Removed Feature:** The most famous and historically significant architectural elements ever added to and subsequently removed from the Pantheon building itself (which dominates the piazza) are the two bell towers, or *campanili*.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Bell Towers Feature:**\n    *   **Who built them?** They were designed and added in the 17th century (c. 1626) by the celebrated Baroque artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini (or his school) under Pope Urban VIII Barberini.\n    *   **What was their purpose?** They were belfries, added to signify the Pantheon's function as a Christian church (Basilica of St. Mary and the Martyrs).\n    *   **Why were they unique/controversial?** They were widely detested by Roman classicists and the public almost immediately. Critics felt they ruined the perfect classical harmony of the Pantheon's original facade. This intense dislike led to them being given the pejorative nickname **\"le orecchie d'asino,\"** or **\"the donkey's ears.\"** This certainly qualifies as a \"unique\" (and uniquely disliked) feature.\n\n5.  **Investigate the Removal Date:** This is the most critical point of the analysis. While the \"donkey's ears\" are the perfect candidate for a \"unique architectural feature,\" historical records are clear that they were demolished much earlier than 1950. The demolition took place between **1883 and 1892** during a large-scale project to restore ancient monuments to their perceived original state.\n\n6.  **Re-evaluate the Question's Premise:** The question states the feature was removed in 1950. This appears to be a factual error in the question's premise. There are no records of another major, unique architectural feature being removed from the piazza in that specific year. Other changes, like the removal of tram lines from central Rome, occurred in the post-war period, but tracks are generally not considered a \"unique architectural feature\" of a specific square in the way Bernini's towers were.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The question is almost certainly referring to the famous \"donkey's ears\" but provides an incorrect date of removal. The towers are the only feature that perfectly matches the description of being a unique, famous, and ultimately removed architectural element associated with the Pantheon and its piazza.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   The key to the answer lies in identifying the most famous *removed* feature, not just any feature.\n*   It's crucial to cross-reference the date. The year 1950 in the question is factually incorrect for the removal of the most likely candidate.\n*   One must conclude that the substance of the question points to the bell towers, despite the erroneous date.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe architectural feature was a pair of bell towers (campanili), added to the Pantheon's facade by Bernini in the 17th century. They were widely disliked and derisively nicknamed \"the donkey's ears\" (\"le orecchie d'asino\") because they were seen as ruining the classical harmony of the ancient temple. Although the question states they were removed in 1950, they were actually demolished in the late 19th century (around 1883).\n\n<<<The two bell towers nicknamed \"the donkey's ears\".>>>"
