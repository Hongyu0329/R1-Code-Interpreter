    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand Wallpaper Groups and Point Groups:**\n    *   **Wallpaper groups** (or plane crystallographic groups) are the 17 distinct mathematical groups that describe the two-dimensional repeating patterns in a plane. They combine translational symmetry with point symmetries (rotations and reflections).\n    *   The **point group** of a wallpaper group consists of all the symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point in the plane fixed. For any wallpaper group, its point group must be one of the 10 two-dimensional crystallographic point groups.\n    *   The **order** of a group is the number of elements it contains.\n\n2.  **Identify the 2D Crystallographic Point Groups and Their Orders:**\n    The crystallographic restriction theorem limits the possible rotational symmetries in a crystal lattice. In 2D, this results in 10 possible point groups. We can list them and find their orders:\n    *   **C₁** (or **1**): Contains only the identity operation. Order = 1.\n    *   **C₂** (or **2**): Contains identity and a 180° rotation. **Order = 2**.\n    *   **Cₛ** (or **m**): Contains identity and a reflection. **Order = 2**.\n    *   **C₃** (or **3**): Contains identity and 120°, 240° rotations. Order = 3.\n    *   **C₄** (or **4**): Contains rotations by 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°. Order = 4.\n    *   **C₂ᵥ** (or **2mm**): Contains a 180° rotation and two perpendicular reflection lines. Order = 4.\n    *   **C₃ᵥ** (or **3m**): Contains three reflection lines and 120°/240° rotations. Order = 6.\n    *   **C₆** (or **6**): Contains rotations by multiples of 60°. Order = 6.\n    *   **C₄ᵥ** (or **4mm**): Contains 90° rotations and four reflection lines. Order = 8.\n    *   **C₆ᵥ** (or **6mm**): Contains 60° rotations and six reflection lines. Order = 12.\n\n3.  **Find Point Groups of Order 2:**\n    From the list above, there are two point groups of order 2:\n    *   **C₂** (or **2**), consisting of a 2-fold rotation.\n    *   **Cₛ** (or **m**), consisting of a mirror reflection.\n\n4.  **Identify Wallpaper Groups with These Point Groups:**\n    Now we need to go through the 17 wallpaper groups and identify which ones have a point group of C₂ or Cₛ. The wallpaper groups are often grouped into crystal systems, which are defined by the point group.\n\n    *   **Oblique Crystal System:**\n        *   Point Group **C₂**: There is one wallpaper group, **p2**, which has 2-fold rotational symmetry but no reflections.\n\n    *   **Rectangular Crystal System:**\n        *   Point Group **Cₛ (m)**: There are three wallpaper groups whose point operations consist only of reflections. These groups lack any rotational symmetry greater than 1-fold.\n            *   **pm**: Contains reflection axes.\n            *   **pg**: Contains only glide reflection axes. The point operation corresponding to a glide reflection is a simple reflection.\n            *   **cm**: Contains both reflection and glide reflection axes. Its point group is also Cₛ (m).\n\n5.  **List and Count the Groups:**\n    The wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n    1.  **p2** (Point Group C₂)\n    2.  **pm** (Point Group Cₛ)\n    3.  **pg** (Point Group Cₛ)\n    4.  **cm** (Point Group Cₛ)\n\n    There are a total of 4 such wallpaper groups.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Distinguish Wallpaper Group from Point Group:** The wallpaper group includes translations, while the point group only includes rotations and reflections about a point. For example, `pg` contains glide reflections (translation + reflection), but its associated point group `m` only contains the reflection part.\n*   **Crystal System:** Knowing the crystal system helps narrow down the possibilities. The groups we are looking for belong to the Oblique (for point group C₂) and Rectangular (for point group Cₛ) systems.\n*   **Notation:** Be familiar with both Hermann-Mauguin (e.g., `p2`, `pm`) and Schönflies (e.g., C₂, Cₛ) notation for groups, as both are commonly used.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBy systematically identifying the point groups of order 2 (C₂ and Cₛ) and then finding all the wallpaper groups that correspond to these point groups (`p2`, `pm`, `pg`, `cm`), we arrive at a total count.\n\nTotal = (Number of groups with point group C₂) + (Number of groups with point group Cₛ)\nTotal = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n<<<4>>>"
