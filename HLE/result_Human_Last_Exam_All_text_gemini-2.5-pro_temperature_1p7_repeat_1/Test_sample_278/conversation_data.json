    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the parametric curve.**\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b \\sin t$\nwhere the parameter $t$ ranges from $0$ to $2\\pi$.\nThe value of $b$ is piecewise:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $b = 1$.\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $b = 5$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first part of the curve ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$).**\nIn this interval, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\nThis is the standard parametrization for a circle. We can check this by observing that $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\nAs $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n*   $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$.\n*   $y = \\sin t$ goes from $\\sin(0)=0$ up to $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ and back down to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$.\nSince $y = \\sin t \\ge 0$ in this interval, this part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of the unit circle centered at the origin, with radius 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second part of the curve ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$).**\nIn this interval, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5 \\sin t$.\nWe can find the Cartesian equation for this part:\n$x^2 = \\cos^2 t$\n$(\\frac{y}{5})^2 = \\sin^2 t$\nAdding these gives $x^2 + (\\frac{y}{5})^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-horizontal axis of 1 and a semi-vertical axis of 5.\nAs $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$:\n*   $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$.\n*   $y = 5 \\sin t$ goes from $5\\sin(\\pi)=0$ down to $5\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-5$ and back up to $5\\sin(2\\pi)=0$.\nSince $y = 5 \\sin t \\le 0$ in this interval, this part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse of the ellipse $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the bounding box of the entire figure.**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum values for the $x$ and $y$ coordinates. This defines the smallest axis-aligned rectangle (the bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The equation is $x = \\cos t$ for the entire range $t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The cosine function ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   $x_{max} = 1$\n    *   $x_{min} = -1$\n    *   The total width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** We need to consider both parts.\n    *   In the first part ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$), $y = \\sin t$ ranges from 0 to 1. So, $y_{max_1} = 1$ and $y_{min_1} = 0$.\n    *   In the second part ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$), $y = 5 \\sin t$ ranges from 0 to -5. So, $y_{max_2} = 0$ and $y_{min_2} = -5$.\n    *   Combining both parts, the overall maximum y is $\\max(1, 0) = 1$ and the overall minimum y is $\\min(0, -5) = -5$.\n    *   The total height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the side length of the smallest enclosing square.**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. A square that \"outcircles\" or encloses this rectangle must have a side length at least as large as the largest dimension of the rectangle.\n*   Width = 2\n*   Height = 6\n*   The larger dimension is 6.\nTherefore, the side length of the smallest enclosing square must be 6.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the area of the square.**\nThe side length of the smallest square is $S = 6$.\nThe area of this square is $A = S^2$.\n$A = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful points checklist:**\n*   Recognized the curve is piecewise (semi-circle and semi-ellipse).\n*   Correctly identified the range of x-values is $[-1, 1]$.\n*   Correctly identified the range of y-values by combining the ranges from both pieces to get $[-5, 1]$.\n*   Calculated the figure's total width and height correctly (width=2, height=6).\n*   Understood that the side of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the figure's width and height.\n*   Calculated the final area as the square of the side length.\n\nThe analysis is complete and robust.\n\n<<<36>>>"
