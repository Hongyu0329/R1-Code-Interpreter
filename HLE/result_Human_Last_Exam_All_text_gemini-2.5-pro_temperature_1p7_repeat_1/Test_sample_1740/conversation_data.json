    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The user wants to know the total number of members in the \"let-7 family\" of microRNAs that have been specifically identified in *Homo sapiens* (humans) to date.\n\n2.  **Define \"let-7 Family\"**: The let-7 family is a group of small non-coding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs). Family members are grouped together based on high sequence similarity, particularly in their \"seed sequence\" (nucleotides 2-8), which is critical for determining which messenger RNAs (mRNAs) they target and regulate.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Ambiguities and Careful Points**:\n    *   **\"Member\" could mean different things**: Does \"member\" refer to the unique mature miRNA molecules (the functional units) or the genes (genomic loci) that encode them? This is the most critical point of ambiguity.\n    *   **Gene vs. Mature miRNA**: Several different genes located at different positions in the human genome can produce the exact same mature miRNA sequence. For example, there are three `let-7a` genes (`MIRLET7A1`, `MIRLET7A2`, `MIRLET7A3`), but they all produce the identical mature `let-7a` miRNA.\n    *   **Evolving Definitions**: The exact definition of a \"family\" can sometimes expand as new, more distantly related sequences are discovered. Some sources might include members that others exclude (e.g., miR-202).\n    *   **Authoritative Source**: The primary database for miRNA sequences and annotation is miRBase. Scientific reviews are also excellent sources but can sometimes differ based on their specific classification criteria.\n\n4.  **Acquire Data - Two Interpretations**:\n\n    **Interpretation A: Counting Unique Mature miRNA Sequences**\n\n    This approach counts the distinct functional molecules. The core, highly conserved members of the human let-7 family are:\n    1.  let-7a\n    2.  let-7b\n    3.  let-7c\n    4.  let-7d\n    5.  let-7e\n    6.  let-7f\n    7.  let-7g\n    8.  let-7i\n    9.  miR-98 (which is structurally and functionally a part of the let-7 family)\n\n    Under this interpretation, there are **9** distinct mature miRNA members in the core let-7 family.\n\n    **Interpretation B: Counting Gene Loci**\n\n    This approach counts every distinct gene that codes for a let-7 family miRNA. This number is often what is cited in scientific literature when referring to the number of \"members\".\n    *   **let-7a**: Is encoded by 3 genes (MIRLET7A1, MIRLET7A2, MIRLET7A3).\n    *   **let-7f**: Is encoded by 2 genes (MIRLET7F1, MIRLET7F2).\n    *   **let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98**: Are each encoded by 1 gene.\n\n    Let's sum the number of genes:\n    3 (for let-7a) + 2 (for let-7f) + 1 (for let-7b) + 1 (for let-7c) + 1 (for let-7d) + 1 (for let-7e) + 1 (for let-7g) + 1 (for let-7i) + 1 (for miR-98) = **12** gene loci.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude**:\n    *   There are 9 unique mature let-7 family miRNA sequences.\n    *   These 9 unique sequences are generated from 12 distinct gene loci.\n    *   In scientific publications, it is common to refer to the number of gene loci as the number of family \"members\". For instance, many reviews state, \"The human let-7 family comprises 12 members.\"\n    *   Therefore, the most common and widely accepted answer in a scientific context is 12.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTo date, there are **12** members of the let-7 family identified in humans. This number refers to the 12 distinct gene loci that encode for let-7 family miRNAs. These 12 genes produce 9 different mature miRNA sequences (as let-7a and let-7f are each encoded by multiple genes).\n\n<<<12>>>"
