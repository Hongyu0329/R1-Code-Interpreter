    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Naturally Occurring Noble Gases**\nFirst, we must list the elements that are classified as noble gases and occur naturally on Earth. These are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n*(Note: Oganesson (Og) is also in the noble gas group but is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally, so it is not considered.)*\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of \"All Terrestrial Matter\"**\nThe question asks for the rarest gas as a percentage of \"all terrestrial matter.\" This refers to the total mass of the planet Earth, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere (oceans), and lithosphere (crust, mantle, core). The vast majority of the Earth's mass is in its core and mantle. However, noble gases are \"atmophiles,\" meaning they are primarily concentrated in the atmosphere due to their gaseous nature and chemical inertness. Their concentration in the solid Earth is extremely low. Therefore, examining their atmospheric abundance gives us a very reliable indication of their overall rarity.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Abundances of the Noble Gases**\nLet's look at the typical abundance of each noble gas in Earth's atmosphere, which is their main reservoir. Abundances are usually given in parts per million (ppm) by volume.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** By far the most common noble gas, making up about 0.934% of the atmosphere, or 9,340 ppm.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant, with a concentration of about 18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** The third most abundant, with a concentration of about 5.2 ppm. It is very light and constantly escapes into space, but is also constantly replenished by radioactive decay within the Earth's crust.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Much rarer, with a concentration of about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Very rare, with a concentration of only about 0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion).\n*   **Radon (Rn):** This gas is unique in the group because all its isotopes are radioactive and have very short half-lives. The most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. It is formed from the radioactive decay of radium and uranium in the Earth's crust. Because it decays so quickly, it never accumulates in the atmosphere or anywhere else to any significant degree. Its average atmospheric concentration is minuscule, estimated to be about 1 part in 10^21 (one sextillionth).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze and Conclude**\nComparing the abundances, we can establish a clear order from most common to rarest in the atmosphere:\nArgon > Neon > Helium > Krypton > Xenon >> Radon\n\nThe concentration of Radon is many orders of magnitude lower than that of Xenon, the next rarest. While Xenon is rare, it is stable and persists. Radon, due to its rapid radioactive decay, is present only in infinitesimal, transient amounts. The total mass of Radon in the entire atmosphere at any given moment is less than a gram, whereas the mass of Xenon is in the trillions of tonnes. Therefore, Radon is unquestionably the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 5: Consider the Year \"2002\"**\nThe question specifies the year 2002. However, the relative abundances of these naturally occurring elements are governed by fundamental geological and physical processes that do not change on human timescales. The rate of production and decay of Radon, and the primordial amounts of the other stable noble gases, were effectively the same in 2002 as they are today. The year is not a significant factor in the answer.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on its extreme radioactivity and very short half-life, which prevent it from ever accumulating, Radon is the rarest of the naturally occurring noble gases on Earth.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
