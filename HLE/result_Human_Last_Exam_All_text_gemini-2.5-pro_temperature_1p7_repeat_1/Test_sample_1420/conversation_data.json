    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Context**\nThe objective is to find the value of the critical exponent $\\alpha$, which describes the behavior of the specific heat ($C \\sim |T-T_c|^{-\\alpha}$) near a critical point. The method to be used is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion, a cornerstone technique of the renormalization group (RG) theory. The system's spatial dimension is given as $d=3$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$)**\nThe $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative method performed around the upper critical dimension, $d_c$. This is the dimension at and above which mean-field theory provides the correct critical exponents. For a vast class of systems with a scalar or vector order parameter (like the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Expansion Parameter, $\\epsilon$**\nThe expansion is performed in powers of the small parameter $\\epsilon$, defined as the deviation from the upper critical dimension:\n$\\epsilon = d_c - d$\nGiven $d_c = 4$ and the physical dimension of interest $d = 3$, we have:\n$\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is formally derived for $\\epsilon \\ll 1$. Setting $\\epsilon=1$ is a significant extrapolation. However, this procedure often yields surprisingly accurate results and is the standard way to apply the theory to three-dimensional systems. The result is an approximation, not an exact value.\n\n**Step 4: Recall the Formula for the Exponent $\\alpha$ from the $\\epsilon$-Expansion**\nIn the RG framework, critical exponents are calculated as series in $\\epsilon$. The one-loop (first-order in $\\epsilon$) result for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ for the general O(n) model (where 'n' is the number of components of the order parameter) is:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{(4-n)\\epsilon}{2(n+8)} + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The value of $\\alpha$ depends on the universality class, which is characterized by the symmetry of the order parameter 'n'.\n*   n=1 corresponds to the Ising model (scalar order parameter).\n*   n=2 corresponds to the XY model (e.g., superfluids).\n*   n=3 corresponds to the Heisenberg model (e.g., isotropic ferromagnets).\nSince the problem does not specify 'n', it is conventional to assume the simplest and most fundamental case: the Ising model (n=1).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate $\\alpha$ for the Ising Universality Class (n=1)**\nSubstituting n=1 into the general formula:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{(4-1)\\epsilon}{2(1+8)} + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{3\\epsilon}{2 \\times 9} + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{3\\epsilon}{18} + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n$\\alpha = \\frac{\\epsilon}{6} + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the Value of $\\epsilon$ to Find the Final Answer**\nNow, we substitute $\\epsilon=1$ into the first-order expression to get the estimate for $d=3$:\n$\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n**Careful Point 3:** This result is only the first term in an asymptotic series. Higher-order calculations provide corrections. For example, the two-loop term for the Ising model is $+\\frac{55}{3888}\\epsilon^2$. For $\\epsilon=1$, this would change the value from $\\sim 0.167$ to $\\sim 0.181$. However, the question asks for \"the\" value from the $\\epsilon$-expansion, which standardly refers to the leading-order (one-loop) result. The one-loop result is a classic and fundamental prediction of the theory.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n1.  **Framework:** Renormalization Group, $\\epsilon$-expansion.\n2.  **Dimensions:** $d=3$, $d_c=4$.\n3.  **Expansion Parameter:** $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n4.  **Formula (one-loop, O(n) model):** $\\alpha = \\frac{(4-n)\\epsilon}{2(n+8)}$.\n5.  **Assume Universality Class:** Ising model (n=1).\n6.  **Simplified Formula (Ising):** $\\alpha = \\frac{\\epsilon}{6}$.\n7.  **Final Calculation:** Set $\\epsilon=1$ to get $\\alpha \\approx 1/6$.\n\nThis value, $\\alpha \\approx 0.167$, is reasonably close to the modern, highly precise theoretical and experimental values for the 3D Ising model, which are around $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$. The discrepancy highlights the approximate nature of the first-order $\\epsilon$-expansion at $\\epsilon=1$.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
