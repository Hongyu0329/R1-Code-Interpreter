    "This problem requires us to determine the conditions under which a triangle with two given sides and a non-included angle can have two possible configurations. This is known as the Ambiguous Case of the Law of Sines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the setup and identify the given information.**\nLet the vertices of the triangle be A, B, and C, and the lengths of the opposite sides be a, b, and c respectively.\nWe are given:\n- Side `a = BC = S`\n- Angle `m∠B = 30°`\n- Side `b = AC`\n- Side `c = AB`\n\nThe problem asks for the number of possible integer values of `b` (side `AC`) for which there are two possible values for `c` (side `AB`).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the condition for the existence of two possible triangles.**\nThis situation, often referred to as the SSA (Side-Side-Angle) case, can result in zero, one, or two possible triangles. Let's analyze the geometry.\n\nImagine drawing the side `c = AB` of unknown length along a horizontal line from vertex B. Then, draw the side `a = BC` of length `S` at an angle of 30° to the line containing AB. The vertex C is now fixed. The side `b = AC` must connect vertex C to a point A on the initial line.\n\nLet `h` be the altitude (height) from vertex C to the line containing side AB. This altitude forms a right-angled triangle with vertex B and side BC. We can calculate `h` as:\n`h = a * sin(B)`\n`h = S * sin(30°)`\nSince `sin(30°) = 1/2`, we have `h = S / 2`.\n\nThe number of possible triangles depends on the length of side `b` (AC) compared to the altitude `h` and the side `a` (BC):\n- If `b < h`, the side AC is too short to reach the line containing AB. Zero triangles are possible.\n- If `b = h`, the side AC is exactly the length of the altitude. One right-angled triangle is possible.\n- If `b > h`, there are two sub-cases:\n    - If `b ≥ a`, the side `AC` is long enough to intersect the line containing AB only once in a valid position (the other intersection would be on the other side of B, not forming a triangle with a 30° angle at B). One triangle is possible.\n    - If `h < b < a`, the side `AC` will intersect the line containing AB at two distinct points, both of which form a valid triangle with a 30° angle at B. This results in two possible triangles and consequently two possible lengths for side AB.\n\nThe condition we need is `h < b < a`.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the inequality and find the range for `AC`.**\nSubstituting the values we found for `h` and `a`, the condition becomes:\n`S / 2 < AC < S`\n\nWe need to find the number of integer values of `AC` that satisfy this inequality.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the numerical value of `S`.**\nThe problem defines `S = SNYWR`. This appears to be a placeholder. A common way to resolve such placeholders in self-contained problems is to convert letters to numbers (A=1, B=2, ...) and sum them up.\n- S -> 19\n- N -> 14\n- Y -> 25\n- W -> 23\n- R -> 18\nSumming these values:\n`S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the number of integer solutions.**\nWith `S = 99`, our inequality for the length of `AC` is:\n`99 / 2 < AC < 99`\n`49.5 < AC < 99`\n\nSince `AC` must be an integer, the possible values for `AC` are the integers strictly between 49.5 and 99.\nThe smallest possible integer value for `AC` is 50.\nThe largest possible integer value for `AC` is 98.\n\nTo count the number of integers in the set {50, 51, ..., 98}, we use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of values = `98 - 50 + 1 = 49`.\n\nThus, there are 49 integer values for `AC` for which there are two possible values for side length `AB`.\n\n<<<49>>>"
