    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Core Subject**: The question asks to identify a specific Christian theologian.\n2.  **Key Contribution**: This theologian must be the *first* to have developed *specialized terminology*. This points to an originator of a specific philosophical or theological concept, not just someone who discussed the topics.\n3.  **The Concept**: The terminology must be able to describe *changes in the laws of nature*. This is a crucial point. It's not just about miracles *violating* or *suspending* natural law, but about a framework that can account for the laws themselves being altered.\n4.  **Dual Application**: This framework must be applicable to two distinct events:\n    *   **The Virgin Birth of Jesus**: A singular, specific miraculous event that goes against the established natural law of human reproduction.\n    *   **Possible Alterations in Natural Laws at the Fall**: A systemic, universal change in how the natural world functions, as suggested by scriptural passages about thorns, thistles, pain in childbirth, and the \"futility\" to which creation was subjected (Romans 8).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **\"First\"**: Proving who was definitively first requires historical theological knowledge. We are looking for a foundational figure in Christian thought.\n*   **\"Specialized Terminology\"**: We must be able to point to specific terms, likely in Latin or Greek, that this theologian introduced or systematized for this purpose.\n*   **Miracle vs. Law Alteration**: Many theologians discussed miracles. The key is finding one whose system specifically allows for the *laws of nature themselves* to be different post-Fall than they were pre-Fall, in addition to allowing for singular miracles like the virgin birth.\n*   **Candidate Theologians**: Major systematic thinkers are the most likely candidates. This includes figures from the Patristic era (like Augustine) and the Scholastic era (like Thomas Aquinas).\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Initial Candidates**: The most prominent theologians who dealt with creation, providence, and miracles are Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas.\n2.  **Evaluating Thomas Aquinas**: Aquinas developed a sophisticated framework distinguishing between God's \"ordained power\" (*potentia ordinata*), which is how God works through the established laws of nature, and his \"absolute power\" (*potentia absoluta*), which refers to everything God could possibly do, including miracles. While this explains miracles as God acting outside the usual order, it is less directly focused on explaining a fundamental *change* in that order itself, such as what might have happened at the Fall. It's more of a suspension/exception framework.\n3.  **Evaluating Augustine of Hippo**: Augustine is the stronger candidate. He wrote extensively on Genesis, creation, and miracles (e.g., in *The City of God* and *On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis*).\n4.  **Augustine's Specialized Terminology**: Augustine developed the concept of the **_rationes seminales_**, which can be translated as \"seminal reasons,\" \"seed principles,\" or \"causal reasons.\"\n    *   **What are _rationes seminales_?** Augustine, influenced by Stoic and Neoplatonic thought, proposed that in the initial creation, God embedded these latent causal principles or potentialities into matter. The normal, lawful development of the universe (e.g., a seed growing into a tree) is the unfolding of these pre-ordained principles over time. This constitutes the regular \"laws of nature.\"\n5.  **Applying the Terminology to the Fall**: Augustine's framework allows for a change in how these principles operate. The Fall of Man could be seen as an event that corrupted creation, causing different, negative *rationes seminales* (like those for thorns, thistles, decay, and animal predation) to be \"activated\" or for the expression of existing ones to be altered. This explains a systemic change in the laws and regularities of nature.\n6.  **Applying the Terminology to the Virgin Birth**: A miracle like the virgin birth is explained as an event that does *not* come from the created, embedded *rationes seminales*. Instead, it is a direct act of God operating from a higher set of principles, the *rationes aeternae* (eternal reasons) that exist in the mind of God (the Word/Logos). God can bypass the \"natural laws\" He established in creation to produce a result that the created order could not achieve on its own.\n7.  **Conclusion**: Augustine's system, with its specialized terminology of *rationes seminales*, was the first to provide a comprehensive Christian theological framework that could account for both the ongoing, lawful operation of nature, systemic changes to that operation (the Fall), and singular, supernatural exceptions to it (miracles like the virgin birth). He is therefore the correct answer.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
