No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial for the purpose of calculating the normalized magnetic helicity of AIC waves. The primary justification is the existence of the Parker Spiral. Due to the Sun's rotation, the Interplanetary Magnetic Field at 1 AU is typically oriented at an angle of approximately 45 degrees to the radial direction. The correct procedure involves transforming the measured magnetic field data into a Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system, where one axis is aligned with the local background magnetic field. The helicity is then calculated using the components perpendicular to this local field direction, not the radial direction.
