    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core task is to identify a specific piece of legislation. The key criteria are:\n*   **Jurisdiction:** The modern State of Israel (established in 1948).\n*   **Type of Law:** A statute (a law passed by the Knesset).\n*   **Key Concept:** The *first* to *explicitly introduce* the concept of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew: *tom lev*, תום לב).\n*   **Formatting Rules:** The final answer must not include the preceding article \"the\" or the year of the statute.\n\n**2. Initial Brainstorming and Common Misconceptions**\nMany legal professionals in Israel associate the principle of \"good faith\" most strongly with contract law.\n*   **The Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973:** This is the most famous statute regarding good faith, establishing it as an overarching principle governing all contracts (in negotiation, Section 12; and in performance, Section 39). However, because it was enacted in 1973, it is unlikely to be the *first*. We must look for earlier statutes.\n\n**3. Chronological Search for Earlier Statutes**\nWe need to examine major Israeli laws enacted before 1973.\n\n*   **Land Law, 1969:** Section 9 of this law deals with competing transactions for the same real property. It gives priority to the second purchaser if they acted in \"good faith\" (*be'tom lev*), paid consideration, and registered their right. This statute explicitly uses the term and predates the 1973 Contracts Law. So, we have an earlier candidate.\n\n*   **Sale Law, 1968:** Section 6 of this law states: \"An obligation arising from a contract of sale shall be fulfilled, and a right arising from it shall be exercised, in the customary manner and in good faith.\" This explicitly uses the term and predates the Land Law, 1969. This is now our leading candidate.\n\n*   **Agency Law, 1965:** Section 8 of this law requires an agent to act with \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) to their principal. While the concept of loyalty is closely related to good faith, it is a distinct legal term. The statute does not use the explicit phrase \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) in this context. Therefore, this is not the correct answer.\n\n**4. Deepening the Search to 1965 and Earlier**\nSince the Sale Law is from 1968, we must check if any major laws from the mid-1960s introduced the concept even earlier.\n\n*   **Defamation Law, 1965:** Section 15 of this law provides a series of defenses for a publisher, which are valid only if the publication was made \"in good faith\" (*be'tom lev*). This law explicitly uses the term and was enacted in 1965, three years before the Sale Law.\n\n*   **Succession Law, 1965:** Section 30 of this law addresses undue influence in the creation of a will. It invalidates a will's provision benefitting a person who took part in making it, *unless* it can be proven that the testator's action was done in \"good faith\" (*be'tom lev*). This law also uses the term and is also from 1965.\n\n**5. Pinpointing the First Statute of 1965**\nWe have identified two statutes from 1965 that both explicitly use the term \"good faith\": the Defamation Law and the Succession Law. To determine which was *first*, we must look at their exact enactment dates.\n*   The **Succession Law** was passed by the Knesset on **February 8, 1965**.\n*   The **Defamation Law** was passed by the Knesset on **July 27, 1965**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe Succession Law was enacted several months before the Defamation Law. Therefore, the Succession Law was the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** It is crucial to distinguish between laws that implicitly embody the principle of fairness (like the Agency Law's \"loyalty\" clause) and those that explicitly use the legal term of art \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n*   **Chronology is Key:** The question's use of the word \"first\" makes the precise date of enactment the deciding factor. Common knowledge points to later, more famous laws, but a careful chronological review is necessary.\n*   **Scope of the Law:** The first introduction of the term was in a specific context (inheritance law) rather than as a general, overarching principle, which came later with the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973.\n\n<<<Succession Law>>>"
