    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Date of Death:** The first step is to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that Blanche, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **September 12, 1368**. Her death was likely due to the plague. She died at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, **England**.\n\n2.  **Determine Chaucer's Position and General Location:** Around this time, Geoffrey Chaucer was in royal service. In 1367, he had been made an esquire (*esquier*) of the household of King Edward III. This was a position of some importance that required his presence at or near the royal court, which was based in **England**.\n\n3.  **Examine Records of Chaucer's Travels:** Chaucer's life is partly documented through official records of payment and travel for diplomatic missions.\n    *   **Italy:** Chaucer's famous first diplomatic mission to Italy (Genoa and Florence) did not occur until 1372-1373. Therefore, he was not in Italy in 1368.\n    *   **France:** Chaucer traveled to France many times on diplomatic and military business throughout his life. However, there are no records placing him in France in September 1368.\n    *   **England:** Records from the royal court show payments to Chaucer in England during this period. Crucially, there is a record of Chaucer and his wife, Philippa, receiving allowances for mourning clothes for the death of Blanche of Lancaster. This strongly places him within the court circle in England at the time of her death and the subsequent period of mourning.\n\n4.  **Consider the Connection between Chaucer and Blanche's Death:** Chaucer wrote one of his first major works, *The Book of the Duchess*, as an elegy, or memorial poem, for Blanche of Lancaster. It is widely believed to have been written at the request of her grieving husband, John of Gaunt, who would become Chaucer's most important patron. This close literary and personal connection to the event further supports the conclusion that Chaucer was in England and part of the court that mourned her.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Specificity:** While we may not know the exact city or building Chaucer was in on September 12, 1368, the available historical evidence overwhelmingly points to him being in the country of England.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** There is no evidence suggesting he was on a mission abroad in France, Italy, Scotland, or elsewhere at that specific time. His known travels do not align with this date.\n*   **Supporting Evidence:** The record of payment for mourning clothes is a strong piece of direct evidence placing him in the context of the English court's response to the death.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on his role as an esquire in the royal court, the location of the court, the record of him receiving mourning clothes, and the timing of his known travels abroad, it is almost certain that Geoffrey Chaucer was in England when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n<<<C>>>"
