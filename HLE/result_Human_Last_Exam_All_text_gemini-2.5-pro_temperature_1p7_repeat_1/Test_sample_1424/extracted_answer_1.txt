The bare Green's function, $G_0$, is inversely proportional to a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalue, $\epsilon_k$. In the frequency-momentum domain, this dependence is expressed as $G_0(k, \omega) \propto \frac{1}{\omega - \epsilon_k}$, where the exact form of the denominator depends on the specific real-time or imaginary-time formalism being used.
