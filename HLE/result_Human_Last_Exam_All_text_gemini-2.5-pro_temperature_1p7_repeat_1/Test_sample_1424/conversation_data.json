    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including careful points, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Objects of Interest**\n\n*   **Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**: In quantum many-body physics, the Green's function (or propagator) describes the propagation of a particle (or excitation) from one spacetime point to another. The subscript '0' denotes the \"bare\" or \"non-interacting\" Green's function. It describes this propagation in a system where particles do not interact with each other. Physically, it gives the probability amplitude for this process.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$)**: These are the energy eigenvalues of the single-particle Hamiltonian, $H_0$. This Hamiltonian describes the system in the absence of particle-particle interactions. The index '$k$' typically represents a set of quantum numbers, such as momentum, that label the single-particle eigenstates. So, $H_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$.\n*   **Feynman Path Integral Formalism**: This is a formulation of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory where the amplitude for a process is obtained by summing over all possible histories (or paths) that a system can take between initial and final states. Each path is weighted by a phase factor $e^{iS/\\hbar}$ (or $e^{-S/\\hbar}$ in imaginary time), where $S$ is the classical action of that path.\n\n**Step 2: Express the Green's Function using the Path Integral**\n\nThe goal is to calculate the Green's function using the path integral. We will use the imaginary-time (Matsubara) formalism, which is common in condensed matter and statistical physics. The real-time result can be obtained by analytic continuation.\n\nThe imaginary-time Green's function for fermions is defined as the expectation value of time-ordered field operators:\n$\\mathcal{G}_0(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau; \\mathbf{x}', \\tau') = -\\langle T_\\tau \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\psi^\\dagger(\\mathbf{x}', \\tau') \\rangle_0$\n\nIn the path integral formalism, this expectation value is calculated as a functional average over all possible field configurations ($\\psi, \\bar{\\psi}$, which are Grassmann-valued fields for fermions), weighted by $e^{-S_0}$, where $S_0$ is the non-interacting action.\n\n$S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) \\left( \\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} + H_0 \\right) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n\nHere, $H_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator (e.g., $H_0 = -\\frac{\\hbar^2\\nabla^2}{2m} - \\mu$, where $\\mu$ is the chemical potential).\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Action by Transforming to a Diagonal Basis**\n\nThe calculation is intractable in the position-space basis. The key step is to switch to the basis of eigenstates of $H_0$, which are labeled by the quantum number '$k$'. In this basis, the Hamiltonian is diagonal, and its matrix elements are the eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n*   We expand the field operators in this basis:\n    $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) = \\sum_k \\phi_k(\\mathbf{x}) \\psi_k(\\tau)$, where $\\phi_k(\\mathbf{x}) = \\langle \\mathbf{x} | k \\rangle$ are the single-particle wavefunctions.\n*   We also perform a Fourier transform from imaginary time $\\tau$ to Matsubara frequency $i\\omega_n$, where $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$ for fermions ($\\beta = 1/k_B T$).\n\nApplying these two transformations, the action $S_0$ becomes diagonal in both $k$ and $n$:\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_k(i\\omega_n) \\left(-i\\hbar\\omega_n + (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\right) \\psi_k(i\\omega_n)$\n\nFor simplicity, we set $\\hbar=1$ and let $\\epsilon_k$ represent the energy relative to the chemical potential (i.e., we absorb $\\mu$ into the definition of $\\epsilon_k$). The action is:\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_k(i\\omega_n) \\left(-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k \\right) \\psi_k(i\\omega_n)$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Green's Function**\n\nThe path integral for the Green's function in this diagonal $(k, i\\omega_n)$ space separates into a product of independent integrals. The Green's function $\\mathcal{G}_0(k, i\\omega_n)$ is the Fourier transform of $\\mathcal{G}_0(k, \\tau-\\tau') = -\\langle T_\\tau \\psi_k(\\tau) \\psi^\\dagger_k(\\tau') \\rangle_0$.\n\nCalculating the correlation function $\\langle \\psi_k(i\\omega_n) \\bar{\\psi}_k(i\\omega_n) \\rangle$ from the path integral with the action $S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} A_{k,n} \\psi_{k,n}$ gives the inverse of the operator $A_{k,n}$.\n\nFrom our action in Step 3, the operator is $A_{k,n} = (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k)$. The path integral gives:\n$\\langle \\psi_k(i\\omega_n) \\bar{\\psi}_k(i\\omega_n) \\rangle = A_{k,n}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k}$\n\nAccording to the standard definition of the Green's function (which includes a conventional minus sign), we find:\n$\\mathcal{G}_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$\n\nThis is the Matsubara Green's function. By performing an analytic continuation $i\\omega_n \\to \\omega + i\\eta$ (where $\\eta \\to 0^+$), we obtain the real-time retarded Green's function:\n$G_0^R(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Functional Dependence and List Careful Points**\n\nThe functional dependence is now explicit. The bare Green's function $G_0$ is **inversely proportional** to a linear expression of the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Dressed**: This relationship holds for the *bare* Green's function ($G_0$), which describes non-interacting particles. For interacting systems, the full (\"dressed\") Green's function $G$ is modified by a self-energy term $\\Sigma(k, \\omega)$, i.e., $G(k, \\omega) = (\\omega - \\epsilon_k - \\Sigma(k, \\omega))^{-1}$. The dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ is then much more complex.\n2.  **Poles of the Green's Function**: The denominator of $G_0$ becomes zero when $\\omega \\approx \\epsilon_k$. These poles of the Green's function physically correspond to the allowed energy excitations of the system. For a non-interacting system, these are simply the single-particle energies.\n3.  **Choice of Basis**: The explicit appearance of $\\epsilon_k$ is a direct consequence of performing the calculation in the energy eigenbasis, where the single-particle Hamiltonian $H_0$ is diagonal.\n4.  **Real vs. Imaginary Time**: The exact form of the denominator depends on the formalism. In imaginary time it is $(i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k)$; in real time it is $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k \\pm i\\eta)$, where the sign of the infinitesimal term $i\\eta$ determines the type of Green's function (retarded or advanced) and enforces causality.\n5.  **Chemical Potential**: The energy $\\epsilon_k$ in the final expression is typically measured relative to the chemical potential $\\mu$. The full expression in the denominator is more precisely $(\\omega - (\\epsilon_k^{\\text{abs}} - \\mu) + i\\eta)$, where $\\epsilon_k^{\\text{abs}}$ is the absolute energy eigenvalue.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship. In the frequency domain, the Green's function takes the form of a fraction where the denominator is a linear function of $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nSpecifically, for the real-time retarded Green's function, the dependence is:\n$G_0^R(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{(\\omega - \\epsilon_k) + i\\eta}$\n\nFor the imaginary-time (Matsubara) Green's function, it is:\n$\\mathcal{G}_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$\n\nIn both cases, the bare Green's function is inversely proportional to a term of the form (Frequency - Energy). The poles of the Green's function correspond directly to the single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function, $G_0$, is inversely proportional to a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalue, $\\epsilon_k$. In the frequency-momentum domain, this dependence is expressed as $G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$, where the exact form of the denominator depends on the specific real-time or imaginary-time formalism being used.>>>"
