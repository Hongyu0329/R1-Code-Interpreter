    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the system and the goal**\nThe system of differential equations is:\n1. $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (5u^2(t) - 3u(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1 - u(t))$\n2. $u'(t) = (u(t) - 1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe need to find the separatrix of this system in the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$. A separatrix is a special trajectory that separates regions of different long-term behavior. Separatrices are typically the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points**\nEquilibrium points occur where $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom the second equation, $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, which gives $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the first equation:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point $(d, u) = (0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the first equation:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1) = 0$.\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points $(d, u) = (0, 1)$ and $(d, u) = (-1, 1)$.\n\nSo, the equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n**Step 3: Classify the equilibrium points**\nWe linearize the system by computing the Jacobian matrix $J(d, u)$:\n$F(d,u) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3$\n$G(d,u) = u^3 - u^2$\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d + 5u^2 - 3u & (10u-3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (0, 1):**\n    $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(0) + 5-3 & (10-3)(0) + 4-3 \\\\ 0 & 3-2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, $(0, 1)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\n*   **At (-1, 1):**\n    $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) + 5-3 & (10-3)(-1) + 4-3 \\\\ 0 & 3-2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -7+1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since they have opposite signs, $(-1, 1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive. This is a degenerate point.\n\nThe presence of the saddle point at $(-1, 1)$ is key to finding the separatrix. The separatrix will be the stable and/or unstable manifold of this saddle point.\n\n**Step 4: Find the invariant manifolds (trajectories) of the saddle point**\nWe look for an invariant curve, which is a curve $d=f(u)$ that is also a trajectory of the system. Let's try to find a simple polynomial solution of the form $d=cu^k$. Substituting this into the system leads to the conclusion that $k=2$ and $c=-1$ provides a solution.\n\nLet's verify that the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold (a trajectory).\nIf $d(t) = -u(t)^2$, then by the chain rule, $d'(t) = -2u(t) u'(t)$.\nUsing the given equation for $u'$, we have $d'(t) = -2u(u^3 - u^2) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nNow, substitute $d = -u^2$ into the right-hand side of the equation for $d'$:\n$2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) + u^4 - u^3$\n$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + u^4 - u^3$\n$= (2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\nSince the two expressions for $d'$ are identical, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the separatrix**\nNow we check if this invariant manifold passes through the saddle point $(-1, 1)$.\nIf $u=1$, then $d = -1^2 = -1$. So the curve passes through $(-1, 1)$.\nIf $u=0$, then $d = -0^2 = 0$. The curve also passes through the equilibrium point $(0, 0)$.\n\nThe curve $d = -u^2$ is a trajectory that connects the saddle point $(-1,1)$ to the equilibrium point $(0,0)$. To determine if it's part of the stable or unstable manifold of the saddle, we analyze the direction of flow.\nFor $u \\in (0, 1)$, $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) < 0$. This means $u(t)$ decreases with time.\nTherefore, on the curve $d=-u^2$, the trajectory moves from the point where $u=1$ (i.e., from $(-1,1)$) to the point where $u=0$ (i.e., to $(0,0)$).\nA trajectory that leaves a saddle point as time increases is part of its unstable manifold. Thus, the curve $d=-u^2$ is a branch of the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(-1,1)$.\n\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase plane into regions of different dynamical behavior. Trajectories starting on either side of this manifold are repelled from it and follow different paths. Therefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is the separatrix.\n\nThe equation for the separatrix is $d = -u^2$, which can be rewritten as $d + u^2 = 0$.\n\n<<<d=-u^2>>>"
