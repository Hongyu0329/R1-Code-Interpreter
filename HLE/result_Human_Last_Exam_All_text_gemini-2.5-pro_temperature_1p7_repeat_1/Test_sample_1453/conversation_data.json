    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the principles of coiled-coil structure.**\nCoiled coils consist of two or more alpha-helices that wrap around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a seven-residue repeating pattern called a heptad repeat, designated `(abcdefg)n`. The stability and oligomeric state of a coiled-coil are primarily determined by the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of amino acid side chains at the core positions.\n\n*   **Core Positions:** Positions `a` and `d` form the hydrophobic core where the helices interact. The amino acids at these positions are typically hydrophobic.\n*   **Interfacial Positions:** Positions `e` and `g` are on the flanks of the hydrophobic core and are often charged or polar, where they can form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices.\n*   **Solvent-Exposed Positions:** Positions `b`, `c`, and `f` point outwards from the core and are exposed to the solvent, so they are typically polar or charged residues.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the heptad repeat register in the sequence.**\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` (32 amino acids).\nWe need to assign the `a, b, c, d, e, f, g` positions. The key is to place the bulky hydrophobic residues (like I, L, W) into the core `a` and `d` positions to maximize hydrophobic burial.\n\nLet's test different starting positions (registers) for the heptad repeat. The most stable arrangement will have the most hydrophobic residues at `a` and `d`.\n\nLet's try a register where the sequence begins at position `e`:\n**Sequence:**      `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n**Heptad Repeat:** `e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e`\n\nLet's extract the residues at the critical `a`, `d`, and `g` positions with this register:\n*   **Position `a`:** I, K, I, I\n*   **Position `d`:** L, L, L, L\n*   **Position `g`:** E, E, E, E\n\nThis register is highly plausible because:\n1.  Position `d` is consistently Leucine (L), a large, ideal hydrophobic residue for the core.\n2.  Position `a` is mostly Isoleucine (I), another large hydrophobic residue. This creates a core dominated by large hydrophobic residues.\n3.  The remaining positions (`e`, `b`, `c`, `f`) are predominantly polar or charged, which is consistent with their positions flanking the core or exposed to solvent.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the core positions (`a` and `d`) and their implications for oligomeric state.**\nThe combination of residues at the `a` and `d` positions dictates the packing efficiency and thus the number of helices in the bundle.\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Typically prefers large hydrophobic residues at both `a` and `d` positions (e.g., Leu, Ile, Val). The `(a=I, d=L)` pattern is very favorable for a dimer. However, the presence of a charged Lysine (K) at an `a` position is highly destabilizing for a hydrophobic dimeric core. The positive charge would be buried and unpaired, which is energetically costly.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Also compatible with large hydrophobic residues at `a` and `d`. Critically, the trimeric structure can accommodate charged residues in the core if they form stabilizing inter-helical salt bridges. A very common stabilizing motif in trimers is a salt bridge between a residue at position `a` on one helix and a residue at position `g` on an adjacent helix (`a-g'` interaction). In our sequence, we have `K` at position `a` (heptad 2) and `E` (Glutamate) consistently at position `g`. This allows for a stabilizing electrostatic interaction between the positive charge of Lysine and the negative charge of Glutamate, neutralizing the charge in the core.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** To avoid steric clashes from four large side chains converging, tetramers typically require a small hydrophobic residue (like Alanine) at one of the core positions (e.g., `a=A, d=L` or `a=L, d=A`). The pattern `(a=I, d=L)` with two large residues would lead to inefficient packing and steric hindrance in a tetramer.\n*   **Higher-Order Oligomers:** These have more complex packing rules, but the `(a=I, d=L)` pattern is not a classic motif for pentamers or hexamers, and the argument against tetrameric packing due to steric hindrance also applies.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nThe sequence is dominated by an `(a=I, d=L)` pattern, which rules out a tetramer due to steric hindrance. This leaves a dimer or trimer as the most likely options.\n\nThe deciding factor is the Lysine (K) at an `a` position.\n*   In a **dimer**, this `K` would be buried in the hydrophobic core, which is highly unfavorable and would strongly destabilize the structure.\n*   In a **trimer**, this `K` can form a stabilizing salt bridge with an `E` from the `g` position of a neighboring helix. This `a-g'` interaction is a well-known feature that specifically stabilizes a trimeric coiled-coil.\n\nTherefore, the sequence is designed to overcome the energetic penalty of a core charge by adopting a trimeric state that allows for a rescuing salt bridge.\n\nThe predicted oligomeric state is 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
