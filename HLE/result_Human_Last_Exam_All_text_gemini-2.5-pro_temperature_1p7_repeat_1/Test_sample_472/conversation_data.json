    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Meter**\nThe line is from the Roman playwright Plautus. His comedies most commonly use meters like the Iambic Senarius (a line of six iambic feet) or the Trochaic Septenarius. Given the structure and likely rhythm, we will analyze this as an **Iambic Senarius**. A standard Iambic Senarius has 12 syllables in the pattern `S L | S L | S L | S L | S L | S L`, but Plautine meter is famous for its frequent and complex substitutions, which often increase the syllable count.\n\n**Step 2: Syllabification and Elision**\nFirst, we must syllabify the line and account for elisions (where a final vowel or vowel+-m is dropped before a word starting with a vowel).\n- The words are: `et`, `tibi`, `bene`, `esse`, `soli`, `quom`, `sibi`, `sit`, `male`.\n- There is one elision: the final `-e` of `bene` elides with the initial `e-` of `esse`. The words are phonetically joined to become `benesse`.\n- The line to be scanned is effectively: `et tibi benesse soli quom sibi sit male`.\n- Syllabifying this line gives: `et | ti-bi | be-nes-se | so-li | quom | si-bi | sit | ma-le`.\n- Total syllables: 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 14 syllables. This indicates two \"resolved\" feet (feet with three syllables instead of two).\n\n**Step 3: Determine Vowel Quantities**\nWe determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on Latin pronunciation rules.\n1.  **et**: The vowel `e` is naturally short, but the syllable is closed and followed by a consonant (`t` in `tibi`). This makes it long by position. -> **L**\n2.  **ti-bi**: In `tibi`, both `i`'s are naturally short. -> **S S**\n3.  **be-nes-se**:\n    *   `be-`: The `e` is short. -> **S**\n    *   `-nes-`: The `e` is short, but it is followed by a double consonant (`ss`). This makes it long by position. -> **L**\n    *   `-se`: The final `e` of `esse` is short. -> **S**\n4.  **so-li**: The dative of `solus`. The `o` and the `i` are both naturally long. -> **L L**\n5.  **quom**: An archaic spelling of `cum`. Before a consonant (`s` in `sibi`), it is long. -> **L**\n6.  **si-bi**: Like `tibi`, both `i`'s are naturally short. -> **S S**\n7.  **sit**: The `i` is short, but it is followed by two consonants (`t` in `sit` and `m` in `male`). This makes it long by position. -> **L**\n8.  **ma-le**: In `male`, both the `a` and the final `e` are naturally short. -> **S S**\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Scansion String**\nCombining the quantities of all 14 syllables gives us the following raw pattern:\n`L S S S L S L L L S S L S S`\n\n**Step 5: Divide the String into Metrical Feet**\nWe now parse the 14-syllable string into six iambic feet, identifying the two resolved feet. The caesurae (natural pauses) often fall within feet, so we must analyze the pattern carefully.\n-   **Foot 1**: `et ti bi` -> `L S S`. This is a **Dactyl**. It is a valid substitution for a Spondee, which is allowed in the first foot.\n-   **Foot 2**: `be nes-` -> `S L`. This is a perfect **Iamb**. The syllables are from the first two parts of the elided word `benesse`.\n-   **Foot 3**: `-se so-` -> `S L`. This is also a perfect **Iamb**. It uses the last syllable of `benesse` and the first of `soli`.\n-   **Foot 4**: `-li quom` -> `L L`. This is a **Spondee**, a common substitution for an iamb. It uses the last syllable of `soli` and the word `quom`.\n-   **Foot 5**: `si bi sit` -> `S S L`. This is an **Anapest**, a valid substitution.\n-   **Foot 6**: `ma le` -> `S S`. This is a **Pyrrhic**. It is a valid resolution for the final iamb.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe line scans as a Dactyl, followed by two Iambs, a Spondee, an Anapest, and a Pyrrhic. The final representation with spaces between the feet is as follows.\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L S S L S S>>>"
