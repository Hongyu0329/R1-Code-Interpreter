No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material lacking inversion symmetry. The common, stable phases of boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, meaning their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$) is zero, thus forbidding this process.
