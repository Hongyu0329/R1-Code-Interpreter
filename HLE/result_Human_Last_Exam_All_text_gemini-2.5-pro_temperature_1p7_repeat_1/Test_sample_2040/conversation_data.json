    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)\n\nSPDC is a quantum optical phenomenon and a second-order nonlinear optical process. In this process, a high-energy \"pump\" photon, upon interacting with a nonlinear material, spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons, conventionally called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons. For this to happen, two fundamental conservation laws must be obeyed:\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The energy of the pump photon must equal the sum of the energies of the signal and idler photons ($\\hbar\\omega_{pump} = \\hbar\\omega_{signal} + \\hbar\\omega_{idler}$).\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum:** The momentum of the pump photon must equal the sum of the momenta of the signal and idler photons ($\\vec{k}_{pump} = \\vec{k}_{signal} + \\vec{k}_{idler}$). This is also known as the phase-matching condition.\n\nThe crucial requirement for the material itself is that it must facilitate this interaction. The strength of the SPDC process is governed by the material's **second-order nonlinear susceptibility**, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$ (chi-two).\n\n### Step 2: Relating Material Properties to Second-Order Nonlinearity ($\\chi^{(2)}$)\n\nA material can only possess a non-zero bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$, if its crystal structure lacks a center of inversion symmetry. Materials that have an inversion center are called **centrosymmetric**. In such materials, the polarization response to an applied electric field must be an odd function, which mathematically forces all even-order susceptibility tensors, including $\\chi^{(2)}$, to be zero. Therefore, second-order nonlinear processes like SPDC, sum-frequency generation, and second-harmonic generation are forbidden (in the bulk electric-dipole approximation) in centrosymmetric materials.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Crystal Structure of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)\n\nThe core of the question now becomes: \"Are free-standing boron nanosheets centrosymmetric?\"\n\n*   **Borophene Polymorphs:** Unlike graphene, which has one stable structure, borophene (the 2D allotrope of boron) can exist in many different structural forms, known as polymorphs. Several have been predicted theoretically and a few have been successfully synthesized on substrates (like silver).\n*   **Symmetry of Common Phases:** The most widely studied and experimentally realized phases of borophene are the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_3$ sheets.\n    *   The **$\\beta_{12}$ sheet** has a triangular lattice with a specific, regular pattern of hexagonal vacancies. Its crystallographic space group is *Pmmn*, which is a centrosymmetric group.\n    *   The **$\\chi_3$ sheet** also has a triangular lattice with a different vacancy structure. Its space group is *Cmmm*, which is also centrosymmetric.\n*   **Conclusion on Symmetry:** Since the common and stable phases of borophene possess a center of inversion symmetry, they are centrosymmetric.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material with a non-zero second-order susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  A non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is only possible in materials that lack inversion symmetry (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  The common, stable forms of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Therefore, their bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero.\n\nBecause of this fundamental symmetry constraint, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Bulk vs. Surface:** While the bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero, inversion symmetry is always broken at a surface or interface. For a 2D material, the \"surface\" is the material itself. However, the in-plane inversion symmetry of the crystal structure is the dominant factor, and any out-of-plane surface effect would be exceptionally weak for SPDC.\n*   **External Fields or Strain:** It is possible to induce a $\\chi^{(2)}$ response in a centrosymmetric material by applying an external DC electric field or by inducing symmetry-breaking mechanical strain. However, the question does not specify these conditions, so we assume a standard, unperturbed sheet.\n*   **Hypothetical Phases:** While the known, stable phases are centrosymmetric, it is theoretically possible that some less stable, non-centrosymmetric borophene phase could exist. But based on current knowledge of synthesized borophene, the answer is based on its established properties.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material lacking inversion symmetry. The common, stable phases of boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, meaning their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$) is zero, thus forbidding this process.>>>"
