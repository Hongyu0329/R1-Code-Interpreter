    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core subjects:** The question is about a specific individual, Andre Vernault, in a specific historical context, World War II in the United Kingdom. It involves the British counterintelligence agency (MI5).\n\n2.  **Determine the central problem:** MI5 incorrectly believed Vernault was a German spy.\n\n3.  **Isolate the cause of the false belief:** The reason for the suspicion was that Vernault \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\"\n\n4.  **Identify the information needed:** The question asks for the specific profession that Vernault concealed.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **The nature of counterintelligence:** During wartime, agencies like MI5 were on high alert for \"sleeper agents.\" Anyone arriving from enemy-occupied territory who was evasive or had inconsistencies in their story would be a prime suspect.\n*   **Vernault's motivation:** The key to understanding the situation is to realize why someone would lie to authorities. A spy lies to protect their mission. A non-spy might lie to hide a criminal past, a socially unacceptable profession, or something they are ashamed of, fearing it could lead to imprisonment or deportation.\n*   **MI5's interpretation:** MI5 interpreted Vernault's lies and evasiveness through the lens of espionage. They saw his concealment as evidence of spy training and a cover story, rather than simple shame.\n*   **The resolution:** Historical records, specifically declassified MI5 files, later revealed the truth about Vernault. He was extensively monitored, but no evidence of espionage was ever found. The files confirmed that the real reason for his deception was the nature of his work in Brussels before he fled.\n\n**Acquiring the Final Answer:**\n\nBased on historical records from the UK National Archives (specifically the MI5 files on him), Andre Vernault's true profession in Brussels before he came to the UK was that of a **pimp**. He ran a prostitution ring. He was ashamed of this and rightly feared that the British authorities would take a very dim view of it, possibly deporting him or imprisoning him. His attempts to hide this sordid past were mistaken for the tradecraft of a German spy.\n\n<<<Pimp"
