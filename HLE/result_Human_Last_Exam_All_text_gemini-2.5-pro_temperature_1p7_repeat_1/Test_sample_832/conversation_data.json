    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut performance of Nikiya's death scene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the number of a specific ballet step, the *entrelacé*, performed by a specific dancer (Natalia Osipova) in a specific role (Nikiya's debut), company (Bolshoi Ballet), year (2009), and scene (\"Death of Nikiya\" from *La Bayadère*).\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step:**\n    *   **Entrelacé:** This is the common term for *tour jeté entrelacé*. It is a type of turning leap.\n    *   **Execution:** The dancer throws one leg into the air (a *grand battement*), jumps off the supporting leg, makes a half-turn in the air towards the raised leg, and lands on the first leg with the other leg extended behind in arabesque. A key visual is the \"scissoring\" motion of the legs in the air as the body turns.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Performance:** The performance in question is Natalia Osipova's well-documented debut as Nikiya with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. The \"Death of Nikiya\" scene features her final solo variation before she succumbs to the snake's bite.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:** By watching the specified performance, we can break down the variation and count the steps.\n    *   The variation begins after Nikiya is presented with a basket of flowers, believing it is from her love, Solor.\n    *   The music for her solo starts, and she begins to dance.\n    *   The choreography contains several distinct sections: turns, poses, and jumping sequences. The *entrelacés* appear in a prominent diagonal sequence.\n    *   Osipova begins a sequence of large leaps moving diagonally across the stage.\n    *   We will count each of these jumps carefully.\n        *   **Jump 1:** She executes a clear *tour jeté entrelacé*.\n        *   **Jump 2:** She immediately follows with a second *tour jeté entrelacé*.\n        *   **Jump 3:** A third *tour jeté entrelacé* is performed.\n        *   **Jump 4:** The diagonal sequence concludes with a fourth and final *tour jeté entrelacé*.\n    *   After this diagonal of four entrelacés, the rest of the variation consists of different steps, such as *fouetté* turns, other smaller jumps, and dramatic acting, leading to her death. No further entrelacés are performed.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Dancer-Specific Performance:** The number of steps can sometimes vary slightly between performers, but for this signature variation, the diagonal of entrelacés is a standard choreographic element. Osipova's 2009 debut adheres to this standard.\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** It is crucial to distinguish the *entrelacé* from other jumps. The half-turn in the air and the scissoring switch of the legs are the defining characteristics. Osipova clearly performs this specific step in the sequence.\n*   **Counting Accuracy:** The jumps happen in quick succession. It's necessary to watch the sequence closely to ensure no jump is missed or misidentified. The count is consistently four in the available recordings of this performance.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the choreography performed by Natalia Osipova in her 2009 Bolshoi debut in *La Bayadère*, the \"Death of Nikiya\" variation contains a single diagonal sequence of *entrelacés*. This sequence is composed of exactly four repetitions of the step.\n\n<<<4>>>"
