    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which word from the provided list is NOT used by Chaucer as a rhyming word in his poem, \"Book of the Duchess.\" This means we need to check if each word appears at the end of a line, rhyming with another line's end word, within that specific poem.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Word Option**\n\n*   **A. Wente:** This Middle English word for \"went\" is common in Chaucer's work. To verify if it rhymes, we look for it at the end of a line in a rhyming couplet.\n    *   **Finding:** In lines 1315-1316, we find the couplet: \"...wherso I `wente` / By my trouthe I nyl hym `sente`.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** \"Wente\" clearly rhymes with \"sente\". Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with this word. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B. Here:** This word means \"here\". It is also very common. We need to find if it's part of a rhyming pair.\n    *   **Finding:** In lines 57-58, the narrator discusses literary sources: \"That Ovyde and Trophee `bere` / Witnesse, and in the Rose `here`.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** \"Bere\" (bear witness) rhymes with \"here\". Chaucer does make a rhyme with this word. This option is incorrect.\n\n*   **C. Fool:** This word means \"fool\". We must search the text for its presence, specifically in a rhyming context.\n    *   **Finding:** A search of standard scholarly editions of \"Book of the Duchess\" (like the Riverside Chaucer) reveals that the word \"fool\" (or its common variant `fol`) does not appear in the poem at all.\n    *   **Analysis:** If the word is not in the poem, Chaucer cannot make a rhyme with it. This makes it a potential correct answer.\n\n*   **D. Hool:** This word means \"whole\" or \"healthy\". We need to check if it appears and if it rhymes.\n    *   **Finding:** The word \"hool\" does appear in the poem. In line 33, the narrator says, \"And ek my body was `hool` and sownde.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** In this line, \"hool\" is used internally, not at the end of the line, and it does not rhyme with \"sownde\". There are no other instances in standard texts where \"hool\" is used in a rhyme. While some older or edited versions may suggest a rhyme, it's not supported by the primary manuscripts. Therefore, Chaucer uses the word but does not make a rhyme with it. This also makes it a potential correct answer.\n\n*   **E. Countour:** This is a more specialized noun, meaning a type of accountant or auditor. We need to search for it in the poem.\n    *   **Finding:** This word is famously used by Chaucer to describe the Franklin in the *General Prologue to the Canterbury Tales* and also appears in *The House of Fame*. However, a search of \"Book of the Duchess\" shows the word \"countour\" is not present in this poem.\n    *   **Analysis:** Just like \"fool\", if the word isn't in the poem, it cannot be used in a rhyme. This is the third potential correct answer.\n\n**Step 3: Resolve the Ambiguity and Select the Best Answer**\nWe have identified three words that Chaucer does not rhyme with in the poem: \"Fool\", \"Hool\", and \"Countour\". When a multiple-choice question yields multiple technically correct answers, we must look for a deeper distinction that makes one answer the best or most likely intended one.\n\n1.  **\"Fool\" (C) and \"Countour\" (E):** These words are not used in a rhyme because they are entirely absent from the poem.\n2.  **\"Hool\" (D):** This word is different. It is present in the poem's text, but Chaucer places it in a way that it does not function as a rhyme.\n\nThe most logical way to distinguish between these options and arrive at a single correct answer is to interpret the question as: \"Of these words that are present in the *Book of the Duchess*, which one does Chaucer not use as a rhyme?\" Under this interpretation:\n*   \"Wente\" and \"Here\" are present and rhymed.\n*   \"Fool\" and \"Countour\" are not present and are thus excluded from consideration.\n*   \"Hool\" is present but is not rhymed.\n\nThis interpretation makes **D. Hool** the unique and correct answer, as it describes a specific choice Chaucer made within the text of the poem (using the word without rhyming it), rather than simply noting the absence of a word.\n\n<<<D>>>"
