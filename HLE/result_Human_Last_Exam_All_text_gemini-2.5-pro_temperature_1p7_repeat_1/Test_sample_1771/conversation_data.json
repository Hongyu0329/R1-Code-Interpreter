    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the phonological development of PIE *seh₂gieti into Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### Step 1: Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic\n\n1.  **PIE Form:** *seh₂gieti\n    *   **Root:** *seh₂g-\n    *   **Suffix:** *-ie- (yod-present suffix)\n    *   **Ending:** *-ti (3rd person singular present indicative active)\n\n2.  **Sound Changes:**\n    *   **Laryngeal Effect:** The laryngeal *h₂ vocalizes, coloring the preceding vowel *e* to *a*. The root *seh₂g- becomes *sag-.\n    *   **Grimm's Law:** This is a systematic shift of stop consonants.\n        *   The PIE voiced velar stop *g becomes the Proto-Germanic voiceless velar stop *k*. So, the root *sag- becomes *sak-.\n        *   The PIE voiceless dental stop *t in the ending becomes the Proto-Germanic voiceless dental fricative *þ. So, *-ti becomes *-þi.\n    *   **Verner's Law:** This law voices fricatives resulting from Grimm's Law if the original PIE accent did not immediately precede them. In this case, the verb has root accent (*séh₂gieti*), so Verner's Law does not apply to the *k*.\n    *   **Suffix and Ending:** The PIE present suffix *-ie- and ending *-ti combine and evolve into the Proto-Germanic Class I weak verb 3rd person singular present ending *-iþ(i). The *j* from the original PIE suffix is retained after the root.\n\n3.  **Resulting Proto-Germanic Form:**\n    *   Combining the new root *sak- with the retained *j* and the ending *-iþ gives us **\\*sakjiþ**.\n\n### Step 2: Proto-Germanic to Old Norse\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc *sakjiþ\n\n2.  **Sound Changes:**\n    *   **I-Umlaut:** The high front vowel sound, represented by *j*, causes the preceding back root vowel *a* to front to *e*. So, *sakj- becomes *sekj-.\n    *   **Loss of Medial *j*:** After causing umlaut, the *j* is typically lost.\n    *   **Ending Evolution:** The 3rd person singular ending *-iþ* evolves to *-r* in Old Norse (via *þ > ð > r).\n\n3.  **Resulting Old Norse Form:**\n    *   The stem becomes *sek-* and the ending becomes *-ir*. This results in **sekir**.\n\n### Step 3: Proto-Germanic to Old English\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc *sakjiþ\n\n2.  **Sound Changes:**\n    *   **West Germanic Gemination:** In the West Germanic languages (Old English, Old High German, etc.), a single consonant following a short vowel and preceding a *j* is doubled. Thus, the *k* in *sakj-* becomes *kk*. The form becomes *sakkjiþ*.\n    *   **I-Umlaut:** The *j* causes the fronting of the root vowel *a* to *æ*. The form becomes *sækkjiþ*.\n    *   **Palatalization:** The consonant cluster *kkj* undergoes palatalization, becoming the affricate /ttʃ/, which is written as <ċċ> in Old English. The form becomes *sæċċiþ*.\n    *   **Second Fronting (Smoothing):** Following a palatal consonant like *ċċ*, the front vowel *æ* is raised to *e*. The stem becomes *seċċ-*.\n    *   **Ending Evolution:** The ending *-iþ* becomes *-eþ*. The *j* is fully absorbed into the palatalization process.\n\n3.  **Resulting Old English Form:**\n    *   The stem *seċċ-* combines with the ending *-eþ* to give **seceþ**.\n\n### Step 4: Proto-Germanic to Old High German\n\n1.  **Starting Form:** PGmc *sakjiþ\n\n2.  **Sound Changes:**\n    *   **West Germanic Gemination:** As in Old English, *k* doubles before *j*, giving *sakkjiþ*.\n    *   **I-Umlaut:** The *j* causes the fronting of the root vowel *a* to *e*. The form becomes *sekkjiþ*.\n    *   **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** This shift affects voiceless stops. The stop *k* typically shifts to a fricative (*ch*) or affricate (*kch*). However, the geminated *kk* resulting from West Germanic Gemination (*k+j*) is a well-known exception and does *not* shift. It remains as the voiceless geminate stop /kk/, written <ck>.\n    *   **Ending Evolution:** The ending *-iþ* becomes *-it*. The *j* is lost after causing umlaut.\n\n3.  **Resulting Old High German Form:**\n    *   The stem *seck-* combines with the ending *-it* to give **seckit**.\n\n---\n**Summary of Descendants:**\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sakjiþ\n*   **Old Norse:** sekir\n*   **Old English:** seceþ\n*   **Old High German:** seckit\n\n<<<\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sakjiþ\n*   **Old Norse:** sekir\n*   **Old English:** seceþ\n*   **Old High German:** seckit\n>>>"
