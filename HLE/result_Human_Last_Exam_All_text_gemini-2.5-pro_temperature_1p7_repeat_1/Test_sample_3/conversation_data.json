    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Torsion Subgroup and its Structure**\nLet $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field $K$. The set of points of finite order on $E$ with coordinates in $K$, denoted $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, forms a finite abelian group. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of two cyclic groups:\n$E(K)_{\\text{tors}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$\nwhere $n_1$ is a positive integer that divides $n_2$.\nThe question asks for a *non-cyclic* group. A group of this form is non-cyclic if and only if $n_1 > 1$. The order (size) of this group is $n_1 \\cdot n_2$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Base Field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$**\nThe properties of the base field $K$ impose strong constraints on the possible torsion subgroups. A crucial property is which roots of unity are contained in $K$.\nThe field of $n$-th roots of unity, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$, has degree $\\phi(n)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function). For $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$ to be a subfield of the quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, its degree over $\\mathbb{Q}$ must be either 1 or 2. We check the values of $n$ for which $\\phi(n) \\leq 2$:\n*   $\\phi(n)=1 \\implies n=1, 2$. $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_1) = \\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_2) = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   $\\phi(n)=2 \\implies n=3, 4, 6$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\frac{-1+\\sqrt{-3}}{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is our field $K$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_4) = \\mathbb{Q}(i) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$. This is not $K$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_6) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is our field $K$.\nTherefore, the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ contains the $n$-th roots of unity precisely for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**3. Apply the Weil Pairing Condition**\nThe Weil pairing is a fundamental tool that relates the torsion points of an elliptic curve to the roots of unity in the base field. A key consequence is:\nIf the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, then the field $K$ must contain the $n$-th roots of unity, $\\mu_n$.\n\nBased on Step 2, this implies that an elliptic curve over $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ could potentially have a torsion subgroup containing $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for $n=2, 3, 6$. This points to the following possibilities for large non-cyclic groups:\n*   A subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 4) is possible.\n*   A subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9) is possible.\n*   A subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 36) is possible.\n\n**4. Consult the Classification Theorems for Torsion over Quadratic Fields**\nThe possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic fields have been completely classified. For the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the classification results are very precise. This field is unique among imaginary quadratic fields (along with $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$) in that it is a PID and the field of complex multiplication for a class of elliptic curves. This allows for exceptionally large torsion subgroups.\n\nThe known possible non-cyclic torsion structures that can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ include:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. The largest of these is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order $2 \\times 12 = 24$.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The largest of these is $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z}$, which has order $3 \\times 9 = 27$. (This group occurs over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ and no other imaginary quadratic field).\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$. This group cannot occur because $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ does not contain $\\mu_4 = \\mathbb{Q}(i)$.\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. As predicted by the Weil pairing condition, this group is known to occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. Its order is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n**5. Determine the Maximum Order**\nWe compare the orders of the largest possible non-cyclic groups identified in the previous step:\n*   Order 24 (from $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$)\n*   Order 27 (from $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z}$)\n*   Order 36 (from $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$)\n\nThe maximum among these is 36.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinction from $\\mathbb{Q}$:** The problem is specifically about the number field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, so Mazur's Theorem for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$ does not apply.\n*   **Non-Cyclic Condition:** The requirement that the group is non-cyclic is essential. If it were not specified, we would also consider cyclic groups like $\\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$, but the largest non-cyclic group happens to be larger than any possible cyclic group over this field.\n*   **Existence vs. Possibility:** The Weil pairing condition only gives a necessary condition for a group like $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ to exist. The final answer relies on deep classification theorems that confirm that elliptic curves with these torsion structures actually exist over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   **The Specific Field Matters:** The field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is special. For almost all other quadratic fields, the maximum order of a non-cyclic torsion group is much smaller. The presence of 6th roots of unity is the key driver for the large possible torsion.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the analysis, the largest possible order is 36, which corresponds to the group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
