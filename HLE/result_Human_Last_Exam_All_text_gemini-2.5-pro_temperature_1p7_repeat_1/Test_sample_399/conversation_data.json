    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation:**\nThe given differential equation is $x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$. We can write this as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. This equation is a **separable differential equation** because we can rearrange it so that all terms involving $x$ are on one side and all terms involving $t$ are on the other.\n\n**2. Separate the variables:**\nTo separate the variables, we divide both sides by $x^2$ and multiply by $dt$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1) dt\n$$\n**Careful Point:** When dividing by $x^2$, we must ensure that $x(t)$ is not the zero function. We can check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$. The right side of the ODE becomes $(t-1)(0)^2 = 0$. Since both sides are zero, $x(t)=0$ is a solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is non-zero. By the existence and uniqueness theorem for ODEs, our solution cannot cross the $x(t)=0$ solution. Thus, for our specific initial value problem, $x(t)$ will never be zero, and dividing by $x^2$ is a valid step.\n\n**3. Integrate both sides:**\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n$$\nLet's perform the integrations:\n*   Left side: $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n*   Right side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$\n\nCombining these results, we get the general solution:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n$$\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to include the constant of integration, $C$, after integrating. Forgetting it will lead to an incorrect particular solution.\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C:**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our general solution to find the value of $C$.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C\n$$\n$$\nC = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n**Careful Point:** Be precise with the signs and arithmetic when substituting the initial values.\n\n**5. Write the particular solution:**\nNow that we have the value of $C$, we can write the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n\n**6. Find the value of x(1):**\nThe final goal is to find the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution.\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{(1)^2}{2} - (1) + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTo simplify the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $x(1)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8}\n$$\n$$\nx(1) = \\frac{8}{3}\n$$\n**Careful Point:** Pay close attention to the algebraic manipulation, especially handling the negative signs and taking the reciprocal to find the final answer.\n\n<<<$8/3$>>>"
