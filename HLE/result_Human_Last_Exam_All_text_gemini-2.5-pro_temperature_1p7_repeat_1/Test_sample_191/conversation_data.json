    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the protein in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A specific protein.\n    *   **Action on Protein:** It is \"broken down\" or cleaved.\n    *   **Consequence of Action:** This breakdown \"allows for\" or enables a biological process.\n    *   **Biological Process:** \"Macrophage engulfment,\" also known as phagocytosis.\n    *   **Target of Engulfment:** \"Amyloid,\" specifically the amyloid-beta plaques found in diseases like Alzheimer's.\n\n2.  **Translate to Biological Concepts:** The question describes a process called **opsonization**. Opsonization is a key immune process where a target (like a bacterium or cellular debris) is coated with proteins called opsonins. These opsonins act as \"eat me\" signals, flagging the target for destruction by phagocytic cells like macrophages. The question implies that the opsonin is created from the breakdown of a larger precursor protein.\n\n3.  **Identify the Relevant System:** The primary system in the body responsible for this type of opsonization is the **complement system**. This is a cascade of proteins that work together to clear pathogens and debris. It is known to be activated by amyloid plaques in the brain.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Specific Protein:**\n    *   Within the complement system, a central and crucial protein is **Complement component 3 (C3)**.\n    *   When the complement cascade is activated (for example, by the presence of amyloid plaques), C3 is cleaved by an enzyme.\n    *   This cleavage \"breaks down\" C3 into two smaller, active fragments: **C3a** and **C3b**.\n    *   The C3b fragment is the potent opsonin. It physically binds to the surface of the amyloid plaque.\n    *   Macrophages (and the brain's resident macrophages, microglia) have receptors on their surface (like Complement Receptor 3, or CR3) that recognize and bind to the C3b fragment.\n    *   This binding between the macrophage's receptor and the C3b on the amyloid plaque is the direct signal that triggers the cell to engulf and clear the amyloid.\n\n5.  **Final Review of Careful Points:**\n    *   **Protein:** The protein is C3.\n    *   **Breakdown:** It is broken down into C3a and C3b. This fits the query precisely.\n    *   **Allows Engulfment:** The C3b fragment is the \"eat me\" signal that enables phagocytosis. Without the breakdown of C3, this specific signal is not generated.\n    *   **Target:** This process occurs on amyloid plaques. Research has confirmed the presence of C3b on plaques in Alzheimer's disease brains.\n    *   This mechanism is distinct from other related processes, such as blocking \"don't-eat-me\" signals (e.g., CD47) or modulating activating receptors (e.g., TREM2). The question's focus on a protein that is \"broken down\" to allow engulfment points directly to the C3 opsonization pathway.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe protein that is broken down to produce a fragment (an opsonin) that tags amyloid for engulfment by macrophages is Complement component 3.\n\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"
