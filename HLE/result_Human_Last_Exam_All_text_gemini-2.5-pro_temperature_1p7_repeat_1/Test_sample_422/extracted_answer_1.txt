Problem 1: The belief condition (the 'B' in JTB) becomes redundant. In a system where the only alternative to Knowledge is Belief, the condition of "believing" is always met, making it unable to distinguish Knowledge from non-Knowledge. Problem 2: The state of "Belief" becomes self-contradictory. Defined as the negation of Knowledge (`¬K`), the state of Belief must logically include the condition of not believing (`¬B`). This means a person can be in the epistemic state of "Belief" about a proposition precisely because they do not believe it.
