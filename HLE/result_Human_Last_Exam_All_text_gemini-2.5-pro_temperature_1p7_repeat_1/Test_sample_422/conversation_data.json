    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nThe question asks us to identify two problems with the Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge under a specific, simplified set of rules.\n\n1.  **JTB Definition:** Knowledge (K) is defined as a belief that is both Justified (J) and True (T). So, `K ↔ J ∧ T ∧ B`. The three conditions are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for knowledge.\n2.  **Constraint 1: The Two-State System:** The only available epistemic states for a person regarding a proposition are Knowledge (K) and Belief (B). This creates a strict binary: if a state is not Knowledge, it must be Belief, and vice-versa. We can formalize this as `Belief_state ↔ ¬Knowledge`.\n3.  **Constraint 2: Ignore Gettier Problems:** We cannot use cases of \"accidental\" or \"lucky\" justification, which are the most common critiques of JTB. The problems must be internal to the logic of the system presented.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Key Concepts and Potential Conflicts\n\n*   **The Double Meaning of \"Belief\":** The term \"Belief\" is used in two different ways, which is the primary source of the problems.\n    1.  **Belief as a Condition (`B_c`):** This is the 'B' in the JTB formula. It is a necessary component *of* Knowledge.\n    2.  **Belief as a State (`B_s`):** This is the name of the epistemic state that is the only alternative to the state of Knowledge (`B_s ↔ ¬K`).\n*   **The Logic of the System:** We must analyze how the JTB definition `K ↔ J ∧ T ∧ B_c` interacts with the two-state rule `B_s ↔ ¬K`.\n\n### Step 3: Deriving the Two Problems through Analysis\n\n#### Problem 1: The Belief Condition Becomes Redundant\n\nThis problem focuses on the role of the 'B' component *within* the JTB definition of Knowledge.\n\n1.  Consider any proposition P that an agent has an epistemic stance on. According to the two-state rule, the agent is either in the state of Knowledge about P or the state of Belief about P.\n2.  **Case A: The agent is in the state of Knowledge (`K`).** By the JTB definition itself (`K → J ∧ T ∧ B_c`), if an agent has Knowledge, they must meet the belief condition (`B_c`).\n3.  **Case B: The agent is in the state of Belief (`B_s`).** The very name of this state implies that the agent believes the proposition. It is tautological to say that someone in the state of \"Belief\" fulfills the condition of \"believing\". Therefore, the belief condition (`B_c`) is also met in this case.\n4.  **Conclusion:** In this two-state system, the belief condition (`B_c`) is *always satisfied* for any proposition under consideration. A condition that is always met cannot serve to distinguish one state (Knowledge) from another (Belief). The 'B' in JTB becomes trivial and redundant, effectively weakening the definition to `K ↔ J ∧ T`.\n\n#### Problem 2: The State of \"Belief\" Becomes Self-Contradictory\n\nThis problem focuses on the logical definition of the *state* of Belief (`B_s`).\n\n1.  The state of Belief is defined as the negation of Knowledge: `B_s ↔ ¬K`.\n2.  We substitute the JTB definition of Knowledge into this rule: `B_s ↔ ¬(J ∧ T ∧ B_c)`.\n3.  Using De Morgan's laws of logic, we can expand this definition: `B_s ↔ (¬J) ∨ (¬T) ∨ (¬B_c)`.\n4.  This means an agent is in the state of Belief (`B_s`) if their belief is unjustified (`¬J`), OR it is false (`¬T`), OR they do not actually hold the belief in the first place (`¬B_c`).\n5.  **Focus on the third clause: `¬B_c`**. This creates a logical paradox. It states that a sufficient condition for being in the epistemic **state of Belief** is **not having the belief**.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The system creates a situation where a person is classified as being in the state of \"Belief\" about a proposition precisely because they *do not* believe it. This is a self-contradiction, where the name of the state is incompatible with one of its defining logical conditions. The system becomes incoherent.\n\n<<<Problem 1: The belief condition (the 'B' in JTB) becomes redundant. In a system where the only alternative to Knowledge is Belief, the condition of \"believing\" is always met, making it unable to distinguish Knowledge from non-Knowledge. Problem 2: The state of \"Belief\" becomes self-contradictory. Defined as the negation of Knowledge (`¬K`), the state of Belief must logically include the condition of not believing (`¬B`). This means a person can be in the epistemic state of \"Belief\" about a proposition precisely because they do not believe it.>>>"
