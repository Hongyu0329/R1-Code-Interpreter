    "An analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the governing equations.**\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for a fluid with velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ are given by:\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. We have set the constant density $\\rho=1$ without loss of generality, as it can be absorbed into the pressure term. We consider the homogeneous case with no external forces. The variables are independent variables $(t, x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and dependent variables $(u_1, u_2, u_3, p)$.\n\nA symmetry of these equations is a transformation of the independent and dependent variables that maps any solution to another solution. These symmetries form a Lie group. The dimension of the group is the number of independent parameters it depends on, which is equal to the dimension of its Lie algebra, spanned by the infinitesimal generators.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the symmetries of the equations.**\nWe can find the symmetries by looking for transformations that leave the form of the equations invariant. It is most convenient to work with the infinitesimal generators.\n\n1.  **Time Translation:** The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$, so they are invariant under time shifts: $t \\to t + c$. This gives one generator:\n    *   $X_1 = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ (1 dimension)\n\n2.  **Space Translations:** The equations have constant coefficients and are set in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, so they are invariant under spatial shifts: $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}$. This gives three independent generators:\n    *   $X_{2,3,4} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$ (3 dimensions)\n\n3.  **Space Rotations:** The differential operators ($\\nabla$, $\\Delta$) are rotationally invariant. The variables $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\nabla p$ transform as vectors under rotation. The transformation is $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to R\\mathbf{u}$, where $R \\in SO(3)$ is a rotation matrix. The Lie group $SO(3)$ is 3-dimensional. The generators are of the form $\\mathbf{r} \\times \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} + \\mathbf{u} \\times \\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}}$.\n    *   $X_{5,6,7} = \\epsilon_{ijk} (x_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k} + u_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_k})$ for $i=1, 2, 3$ (3 dimensions)\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change to a moving inertial frame. This is given by the Galilean transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{v}_0 t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_0$, for a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}_0$. The pressure $p$ remains unchanged. This gives three independent generators:\n    *   $X_{8,9,10} = t\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$ (3 dimensions)\n\nSo far, we have found $1+3+3+3=10$ symmetries, which form the Galilean group.\n\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation) Symmetry:** We look for a symmetry of the form $t \\to \\lambda^a t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}$, $p \\to \\lambda^d p$. For the equations to remain invariant, the scaling factors of all terms in the momentum equation must be equal.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}$ scales as $\\lambda^{c-a}$.\n    *   $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u}$ scales as $\\lambda^{2c-b}$.\n    *   $\\nabla p$ scales as $\\lambda^{d-b}$.\n    *   $\\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$ scales as $\\lambda^{c-2b}$.\n    Equating the exponents:\n    $c-a = 2c-b = d-b = c-2b$.\n    From $c-a = c-2b$, we get $a=2b$.\n    From $c-a = 2c-b$, substituting $a=2b$, we get $c-2b = 2c-b$, which simplifies to $c = -b$.\n    From $d-b = c-2b$, we get $d = c-b = -b-b = -2b$.\n    So we have the relations $a=2b, c=-b, d=-2b$. This gives a one-parameter group of scaling transformations, since all exponents are determined by a single parameter, say $b$. Setting $b=1$, we get the transformation:\n    $t \\to \\lambda^2 t$, $\\quad \\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda \\mathbf{x}$, $\\quad \\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$, $\\quad p \\to \\lambda^{-2} p$.\n    We must verify that this is consistent with the incompressibility condition $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$. The term $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$ scales as $\\lambda^{c-b} = \\lambda^{-b-b} = \\lambda^{-2}$. The transformed equation becomes $\\lambda^{-2}(\\nabla' \\cdot \\mathbf{u}')=0$, which is equivalent to $\\nabla' \\cdot \\mathbf{u}'=0$. So, the scaling is a valid symmetry. This adds one more dimension to the symmetry group.\n    *   The corresponding generator is $X_{11} = 2t\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_i x_i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} - \\sum_i u_i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} - 2p\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$. (1 dimension)\n\n**Step 3: Consider any other symmetries.**\nThe pressure term in the Navier-Stokes equations has a special property. The equations only involve the gradient of the pressure, $\\nabla p$. Therefore, if we transform the pressure as $p \\to p + f(t)$, where $f(t)$ is any arbitrary function of time, the term $\\nabla p$ remains unchanged because $\\nabla f(t)=0$. This implies that there is an infinite-dimensional group of symmetries. The infinitesimal generators are of the form $f(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$.\n\nWhen asked for the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries, it is standard practice to refer to the dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional symmetry subalgebra. The infinite-dimensional part related to the pressure is often treated as a \"trivial\" or \"gauge\" symmetry and is quotiented out.\n\n**Step 4: Final calculation of the dimension.**\nSumming the dimensions from the identified finite-dimensional symmetries:\n*   Time translation: 1\n*   Space translations: 3\n*   Space rotations: 3\n*   Galilean boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n\nTotal dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\nThe full symmetry algebra is a semi-direct sum of the 11-dimensional algebra and the infinite-dimensional abelian ideal of pressure symmetries. The dimension of the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of symmetries is 11."
