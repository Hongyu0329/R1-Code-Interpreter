The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show resonance when probed is that modern coils contain active electronic circuits that are unpowered during a bench test. These circuits, such as **active detuning circuits** (using PIN diodes) and **preamplifier decoupling networks**, often default to a safe, non-resonant state. The coil is intentionally designed to only become resonant when it receives specific DC power and control signals from the MRI scanner to switch it into its "receive" mode. Without these signals, the coil is detuned and will not absorb energy from the probe, hence no resonance dip is visible on the VNA. Secondary reasons include poor magnetic coupling due to probe orientation or RF shielding on the coil.
