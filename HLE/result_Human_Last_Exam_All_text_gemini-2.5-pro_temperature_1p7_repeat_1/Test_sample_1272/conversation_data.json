    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to the campaigns of the Ming Dynasty in Vietnam during the early 15th century. This period is known in Vietnam as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination, which was eventually ended by the Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi.\n\n2.  **Identify the General and the Event:**\n    *   **General:** Mu Sheng (沐晟) was a key Ming commander involved in both the initial invasion of Vietnam (1406-1407) and the subsequent attempts to suppress the Lam Sơn uprising (1418–1427).\n    *   **First Major Defeat:** While Mu Sheng was successful in the initial 1406 invasion against the Hồ dynasty, his major defeat came later during the Lam Sơn uprising. In late 1426, the main Ming army under Wang Tong was besieged in Đông Quan (modern Hanoi) after a disastrous defeat at Tốt Động-Chúc Động. The Ming emperor dispatched two relief armies: one under Liu Sheng from Guangxi and another under Mu Sheng from Yunnan. The defeat of these relief armies was the final blow to the Ming occupation. Mu Sheng's campaign was his first major independent command against the Lam Sơn forces that ended in a decisive failure.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint the Specific Battle:**\n    *   Mu Sheng's army advanced from Yunnan into Vietnam along the Red River and Chảy River valleys.\n    *   The Lam Sơn forces, under the command of generals like Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, were tasked with intercepting and stopping Mu Sheng's advance before he could reach the besieged Ming forces.\n    *   They prepared a series of ambushes. The decisive engagement is known as the **Battle of Lãnh Câu – Đan Xá** (Trận Lãnh Câu - Đan Xá).\n\n4.  **Locate the Battle Site Geographically:**\n    *   The battle took place in late 1426 (or possibly very early 1427, depending on the calendar used).\n    *   Historical sources place the battlefields of Lãnh Câu (a mountain pass, Ải Lãnh Câu) and Đan Xá (a river ford or locality) in the upper Chảy River (Sông Chảy) region.\n    *   This was the strategic route from Yunnan to the Red River Delta. The Vietnamese forces ambushed Mu Sheng's army at these narrow and treacherous points, inflicting heavy casualties and forcing him to halt his advance and eventually retreat back to Yunnan.\n\n5.  **Map the Historical Location to a Modern Province:**\n    *   The area encompassing the upper Chảy River and the historical sites of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá corresponds to the territory of the modern-day **Tuyên Quang Province** in northern Vietnam. While the campaign trail might have passed through parts of modern Lào Cai and Yên Bái, the principal battle and site of the defeat are located within what is now Tuyên Quang.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to distinguish Mu Sheng's defeat from the even larger defeat of the other Ming relief army under Liu Sheng at Chi Lăng Pass (in modern Lạng Sơn Province). Both happened around the same time and were decisive, but the question specifically asks about Mu Sheng.\n*   Defining \"major defeat\" is key. Mu Sheng's inability to break through the Vietnamese defenses and his forced retreat from the Lãnh Câu – Đan Xá campaign was a strategic failure and a major defeat for his army, representing his first such setback against the Lam Sơn uprising.\n*   Historical place names can be ambiguous, but there is a strong consensus among Vietnamese historians that the Lãnh Câu-Đan Xá battle site is located in what is now Tuyên Quang Province.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the modern province where this significant event occurred.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
