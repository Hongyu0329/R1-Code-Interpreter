    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function $f$\n\nLet the given equation be $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity:**\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    This means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective (one-to-one), we must have $x_1 = x_2$.\n    Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity:**\n    A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n3.  **Fixed Points:**\n    A fixed point of $f$ would be a point $c$ such that $f(c) = c$. If such a point existed, then $f(f(c)) = f(c) = c$. The given equation would then require $\\exp(c) = c$. The graphs of $y=e^x$ and $y=x$ never intersect, so the equation $e^x=x$ has no real solutions. Thus, $f$ has no fixed points.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the case where $f$ is strictly decreasing\n\nWe will show that no such function can exist.\n\n1.  **Asymptotic Behavior:** Let's analyze the limits of $f$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$.\n    *   As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x) \\to \\infty$. If $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = L$ for some finite $L$, then by continuity $f(L) = \\infty$, which is impossible. Thus, the limit must be infinite. Since $f$ is strictly decreasing, we must have $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n    *   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x) \\to 0$. Let $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = M$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $M$ cannot be $-\\infty$. If $M = \\infty$, then as $y=f(x) \\to \\infty$, we get $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{y\\to\\infty} f(y) = -\\infty$. This leads to the contradiction $0 = -\\infty$. So, $M$ must be a finite real number.\n    *   By the continuity of $f$, we can say $f(M) = f(\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = 0$. So, for any decreasing solution $f$, there exists a constant $M$ such that $f(M) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Relation to the line y=x:** Since $f$ has no fixed points, its graph lies entirely above or entirely below the line $y=x$.\n    *   **Case A: $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.**\n        Since $f(M)=0$, we must have $f(M) < M$, which implies $0 < M$.\n        The equation $f(f(M)) = \\exp(M)$ implies $f(0) = \\exp(M)$.\n        Since $M > 0$, we have $\\exp(M) > \\exp(0) = 1$. Thus, $f(0) > 1$.\n        However, from our assumption $f(x) < x$, for $x=0$, we must have $f(0) < 0$.\n        This gives a contradiction: $f(0)$ cannot be both less than 0 and greater than 1. So this case is impossible.\n\n    *   **Case B: $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.**\n        Since $f(M)=0$, we must have $f(M) > M$, which implies $0 > M$.\n        Since $f$ is strictly decreasing and $M<0$, we have $f(M) > f(0)$, which means $0 > f(0)$.\n        However, from our assumption $f(x) > x$, for $x=0$, we must have $f(0) > 0$.\n        This gives a contradiction: $f(0)$ cannot be both less than 0 and greater than 0. So this case is also impossible.\n\nSince both possibilities for a strictly decreasing function lead to a contradiction, we conclude that **no strictly decreasing continuous solution exists**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the case where $f$ is strictly increasing\n\n1.  **Properties of increasing solutions:**\n    *   Since $f$ is increasing, if $x < f(x)$, then $f(x) < f(f(x))$. If $f(x) < x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x)$.\n    *   From $f(x)=x \\implies e^x=x$ (no solution), the function $h(x)=f(x)-x$ is always positive or always negative.\n    *   Suppose $f(x) < x$. Then $e^x = f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. But $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This is a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.\n    *   This leads to the chain of inequalities: $x < f(x) < f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n2.  **Asymptotic Behavior:**\n    *   As $x \\to \\infty$, since $f(x) > x$, we must have $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$.\n    *   As $x \\to -\\infty$, let $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = L$. $L$ could be finite or $-\\infty$. From $f(x) > x$, $L \\ge -\\infty$.\n    *   If $L$ is a finite number, then by continuity, $f(L) = f(\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} \\exp(x) = 0$. So $f(L)=0$.\n    *   From $f(x)>x$, we have $f(L)>L \\implies 0>L$.\n    *   If $L=-\\infty$, then $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x))$ would be $f(-\\infty)$, i.e. $-\\infty$. This would imply $0=-\\infty$, a contradiction.\n    *   So, any increasing solution must have $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = L$ for some constant $L < 0$, and satisfy $f(L)=0$.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing and counting the increasing solutions\n\nWe can construct these functions, which demonstrates their existence and allows us to count them.\n\n1.  **Freedom of Choice:** The construction relies on making choices for the function on a certain interval.\n    *   Choose any real number $L < 0$. This choice determines the limit of our function at $-\\infty$.\n    *   From $f(L)=0$ and $f(f(x))=\\exp(x)$, we have $f(f(L)) = \\exp(L) \\implies f(0) = \\exp(L)$. Note that since $L<0$, $0 < \\exp(L) < 1$.\n    *   Now, we must define a function on the interval $[L, 0]$. It must be strictly increasing and continuous, mapping $[L,0]$ to $[f(L), f(0)] = [0, \\exp(L)]$. Let's call this function segment $h_L$.\n    *   $h_L: [L, 0] \\to [0, \\exp(L)]$ must be a strictly increasing continuous bijection.\n\n2.  **Number of choices:**\n    *   There are uncountably many choices for $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$. The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n    *   For any fixed $L$, we must choose the function $h_L$. The number of such functions (strictly increasing homeomorphisms between two intervals) is also $\\mathfrak{c}$. To see this, one can choose the value of $h_L(L/2)$ to be any value in $(0, \\exp(L))$, which offers a continuum of choices. Each choice leads to a different function (e.g., by making it piecewise linear).\n    *   Each distinct choice of $L$ or $h_L$ generates a different solution $f$ because the definition of $f$ on $[L, 0]$ will be different. The function definition is extended to the rest of $\\mathbb{R}$ uniquely by the equation $f(f(x))=\\exp(x)$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Cardinality:**\n    Since there is a continuum of choices for $L$, and for each of these, a continuum of choices for the function segment $h_L$, the number of possible functions $f$ is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has a cardinality of $\\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, the set of solutions cannot have a cardinality greater than $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    Combining these, the cardinality of the set of solutions is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe set of solutions contains only strictly increasing functions. We have shown that there is a continuum of such functions. The cardinality of the continuum is denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $2^{\\aleph_0}$."
