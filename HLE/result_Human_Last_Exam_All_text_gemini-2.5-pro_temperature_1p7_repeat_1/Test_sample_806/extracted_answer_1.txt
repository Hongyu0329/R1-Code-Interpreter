The specific biochemical reaction was the direct, non-covalent binding of the causative drug molecule to a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) protein on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. This binding altered the conformation of the HLA protein, creating a novel complex that was subsequently recognized by a specific T-cell receptor, thereby initiating the aberrant immune response.
