    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks for the most common or probable mechanism that explains two outcomes for duplicated genes: 1) **Retention** (they are not lost from the genome) and 2) **Divergence** (they become different from each other and the ancestral gene).\n\n2.  **Analyze Gene Duplication:** When a gene is duplicated, there are two identical copies. Initially, this is a redundant situation. One copy is sufficient for the original function, so the second copy is not under strong purifying selection and can accumulate mutations freely. This can lead to several fates. We need to evaluate which of the answer choices best describes a common mechanism for keeping both copies and allowing them to change.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene copy is \"converted\" to the sequence of another homologous gene copy. This mechanism actually works *against* divergence by making the copies more similar. Therefore, it does not explain how duplicate genes diverge and is not the correct answer.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one copy accumulates debilitating mutations (like nonsense or frameshift mutations) and becomes non-functional. This is a very common fate for a duplicate gene and it does represent divergence (from functional to non-functional). However, it is a mechanism of gene *loss* (of function), not *retention* of two functional, diverged copies. The question asks for a mechanism that retains the duplicates.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. This model successfully explains both retention (as both the old and new functions are selected for) and divergence (the second copy must change to gain the new function). This is a valid and important mechanism.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model, the ancestral gene had multiple functions or expression patterns (subfunctions). After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that inactivate different subfunctions. As a result, both copies are now required to carry out the complete set of functions of the original ancestral gene. This explains retention, as losing either copy would now be detrimental. It also explains divergence, as the two copies accumulate different mutations and specialize in different subfunctions.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary process concerning the diversification of species into different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not itself the molecular mechanism responsible for retaining and diverging individual genes within a genome. This is the wrong level of biological organization.\n\n4.  **Compare the Strong Candidates (Neofunctionalization vs. Subfunctionalization):**\n    *   Both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models that explain both retention and divergence. The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization** requires the redundant gene copy to acquire a rare, beneficial gain-of-function mutation before it succumbs to the much more common fate of pseudogenization. This is considered a relatively rare event.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization**, on the other hand, relies on the accumulation of much more common, nearly neutral, loss-of-function mutations. It provides a passive way to preserve both gene copies without requiring a rare innovative event. Because it is based on more probable mutational events, subfunctionalization is considered a more likely initial pathway for the retention of duplicate genes. It essentially provides a \"safe harbor\" from pseudogenization, allowing the genes to be preserved and diverge over longer evolutionary timescales.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are crucial for the evolution of duplicate genes, subfunctionalization is often considered the more probable or \"likely\" initial mechanism for preserving duplicate genes from being lost, as it relies on common degenerative mutations rather than rare beneficial ones.\n\n<<<D>>>"
