The edges of the image will move and smooth out. Specifically, parts of an edge that are convex (bulging outwards from a white region) will retreat, causing the white region to shrink at that point. Parts of an edge that are concave (curving inwards) will advance, causing the white region to expand and fill in the concavity. This process is an approximation of mean curvature flow. As $t \rightarrow \infty$, this continuous smoothing will cause sharp corners to become rounded and will eventually make any closed shape shrink and disappear entirely, resulting in an image of a single uniform color.
