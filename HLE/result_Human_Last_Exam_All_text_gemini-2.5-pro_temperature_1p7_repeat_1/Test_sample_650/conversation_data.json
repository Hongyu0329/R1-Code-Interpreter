    "An analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Goal:** The algorithm takes an integer `n` and a base `c` and computes the base-`c` representation of `n`. This is the standard \"repeated division\" method for base conversion. For example, to convert 13 to base 2, we repeatedly divide by 2 and record the remainders:\n    *   13 / 2 = 6 remainder 1  ($a_0$)\n    *   6 / 2 = 3 remainder 0   ($a_1$)\n    *   3 / 2 = 1 remainder 1   ($a_2$)\n    *   1 / 2 = 0 remainder 1   ($a_3$)\n    The result is 1101 in base 2. The algorithm implements exactly this process.\n\n2.  **Identify the Basic Operations:** The algorithm uses basic operations such as assignments (`:=`), comparisons (`>`), integer division (`⌊x/c⌋`), multiplication (`*`), and subtraction (`-`).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Cost of Each Step:**\n    *   **Step 1 (Initialization):** `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n        This step is executed only once at the beginning. It involves a fixed number of basic operations (a few assignments, one division, one multiplication, one subtraction). Therefore, its time complexity is constant, which we denote as O(1).\n    *   **Step 2 (The `while` loop):** This is the core of the algorithm. Its total cost is the number of times the loop runs multiplied by the cost of the work done inside the loop.\n        *   **Loop Body (Step 2.1):** `i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`\n            Like Step 1, the body of the loop contains a fixed number of basic arithmetic operations and assignments. Assuming these operations take constant time, the cost of a single iteration is O(1).\n        *   **Number of Iterations:** We need to determine how many times the loop condition `q > 0` will be true.\n            *   Initially, `q` is set to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n            *   In each iteration, the new `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋`, where `x` was the value of `q` from the previous iteration.\n            *   Essentially, the value of `q` is being divided by `c` in each step.\n            *   The loop continues until `q` becomes 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is 0 is given by the logarithm.\n            *   Specifically, the loop will execute `k` times, where `k` is the largest integer such that `n / c^k ≥ 1`. This is equivalent to `k ≤ log_c(n)`. Therefore, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n            *   For example, if n = 100 and c = 10, `log₁₀(100) = 2`. The loop will run twice.\n            *   If n = 13 and c = 2, `log₂(13) ≈ 3.7`. `⌊3.7⌋ = 3`. The loop will run 3 times.\n            *   Thus, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n    *   **Step 3 (Return):** `return ((a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1}  a_{0}))`\n        This step simply returns the computed digits. The time to construct this output is proportional to the number of digits, which is `i+1`. Since the final value of `i` is the number of iterations (`⌊log_c(n)⌋`), the time for this step is also O(log_c n).\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Total Complexity:**\n    The total time complexity `T(n)` is the sum of the costs of all steps:\n    `T(n) = (Cost of Step 1) + (Number of Iterations) * (Cost of Loop Body) + (Cost of Step 3)`\n    `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c n) * O(1) + O(log_c n)`\n    `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c n) + O(log_c n)`\n    The dominant term is `O(log_c n)`. So, `T(n) = O(log_c n)`.\n\n5.  **Simplify the Final Expression:**\n    In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm does not affect the complexity class, as long as the base is a constant greater than 1. This is because of the change of base formula: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log_b(c)` is also a constant. Therefore, `O(log_c n)` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Input Size vs. Input Value:** The complexity is expressed in terms of the *value* of the input `n`, not its *size* (the number of bits needed to store it, which is `k = log₂n`). If complexity were measured against the size `k`, the result would be `O(k)`, a linear complexity. However, it's conventional for such algorithms to express complexity in terms of `n`.\n2.  **Assumption on Arithmetic Operations:** The analysis assumes that basic arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, etc.) take constant time, O(1). This is valid for numbers that fit within a computer's word size. For arbitrarily large numbers (requiring multiple words of memory), these operations would take longer, typically proportional to the number of digits (`O(log n)`), leading to an overall complexity of `O((log n)²)`. Without specification to the contrary, the O(1) assumption is standard.\n3.  **Loop Termination:** The loop is guaranteed to terminate because `c ≥ 2`. In each iteration, `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋`. Since `x > 0` and `c ≥ 2`, `⌊x/c⌋ < x`. The value of `q` is a non-negative integer that strictly decreases in each iteration, eventually reaching 0.\n4.  **Edge Cases:** For `0 ≤ n < c`, the initial `q` will be 0. The `while` loop condition `q > 0` is immediately false, so the loop is not entered. The algorithm correctly handles this in O(1) time, which is consistent with the `O(log n)` bound.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The loop executes a number of times proportional to the number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n`, which is `O(log_c n)`. Since the base of the logarithm does not matter in Big-O notation, the complexity is simplified to `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
