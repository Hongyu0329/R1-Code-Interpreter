    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Character**\nThe character in question is 謄 (tō).\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the Character into its Components**\nThe character 謄 has a structure typical of many kanji, where it is divided into a left part and a right part.\n*   **Left Part:** 言\n*   **Right Part:** 滕\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Radical (Bushu)**\nIn kanji, one of the components serves as the radical, which is used for classification in dictionaries. The radical often provides a hint about the character's meaning.\n*   The left part, 言, means \"word\" or \"to say.\"\n*   The right part, 滕, is primarily a phonetic component, indicating the pronunciation \"tō.\"\n*   The meaning of 謄 is \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" which is semantically related to \"words.\" Therefore, the radical is the left-side component, 言.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Name of the Radical**\nRadicals have specific names in Japanese, which sometimes change based on their position within the character.\n*   The radical is 言. The most common reading for this character when used as a radical is \"gon.\"\n*   When a radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n*   Combining the reading and the position name, the radical 言 on the left side is called **ごんべん (gonben)**.\n\n**Step 5: Transcribe the Name into Hepburn Romanization**\nThe final step is to write the Japanese name of the radical using Hepburn transcription, as requested in the question's example (\"Onnahen\" for 媛).\n*   The Japanese name is ごんべん.\n*   The Hepburn transcription is **Gonben**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Correctly identify the components:** It is crucial to see that the character splits into 言 and 滕. Mistaking the structure could lead to an incorrect radical.\n2.  **Distinguish between semantic and phonetic components:** Recognizing that 言 is the semantic component (radical) and 滕 is the phonetic component is key to the analysis.\n3.  **Know the specific name of the radical based on its position:** Radicals like 言 (gon), 人 (nin), and 水 (mizu) have different names when they are on the left side (hen), top (kanmuri), bottom (ashi), etc. In this case, 言 on the left is always \"gonben.\"\n4.  **Accurate Hepburn transcription:** Ensure the transcription of ごんべん is correctly written as \"Gonben\" (or \"gonben\"). Capitalization is generally not strict, but matching the example's style is good practice.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the correct name for the radical of 謄.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
