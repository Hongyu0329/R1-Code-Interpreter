    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The goal is to identify a specific character in William Morris's book, *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must meet three criteria:\n    *   They visited a Roman city.\n    *   They describe Roman religious practices or beliefs.\n    *   This description must contain a clear reference to the founding myth of Rome, involving the twin brothers Romulus and Remus being nursed by a she-wolf.\n\n2.  **Context of the Novel:** *The House of the Wolfings* is a fantasy romance that tells the story of a Gothic tribe, the Wolfings, as they prepare to defend their lands against the Roman army. A significant part of the early narrative involves the Goths discussing their powerful and enigmatic enemy, the Romans.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Characters:** We need a character who has had direct contact with the Roman world. Most of the Wolfings live an isolated life in their great hall in the forest of Mirkwood. However, some members of the tribe have traveled more widely. The most likely candidate would be an elder, a scout, or a former traveler who can offer insight into the enemy.\n\n4.  **Locate the Relevant Scene:** The key discussion about the Romans takes place in Chapter V, titled \"They talk of the Romans.\" In this chapter, the leaders and elders of the Wolfings gather to discuss the approaching threat.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Specific Character:** During the discussion in Chapter V, a character named **Otter** speaks up. The text establishes his credentials, noting that he had been a sea-rover and had \"journeyed amongst the Romans, and seen their great cities.\" This confirms he has visited a Roman city.\n\n6.  **Examine the Character's Description:** Otter then proceeds to describe the Romans to his fellow tribesmen. He talks about their power, their laws, and, crucially, their origin story. He states:\n\n    > \"For they deem themselves to be the children of the Wolf, and they have a tale of their first fathers, two brethren, who, being cast away, were suckled by a she-wolf.\"\n\n7.  **Confirm the Connection to Romulus and Remus:** This description is an unmistakable retelling of the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n    *   \"Two brethren\": Romulus and Remus were twin brothers.\n    *   \"Being cast away\": The twins were abandoned as infants and left to die.\n    *   \"Suckled by a she-wolf\": They were famously rescued and nursed by a she-wolf (Lupa).\n    *   This tale being about their \"first fathers\" correctly identifies it as a foundational myth of Rome.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, we can definitively identify the character. Otter is the member of the Wolfing tribe who has traveled to a Roman city and who describes the Roman origin myth, which readers instantly recognize as the story of Romulus and Remus.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
