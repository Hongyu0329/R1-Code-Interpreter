    "Answering this question requires concepts from convex geometry and the geometry of numbers. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the condition on the convex domain**\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. The set of lines is `L = {l_{p,q} : px + qy = 1, p, q ∈ Z, gcd(p, q) = 1}`. The condition is that `K` must intersect every line in `L`.\n\nA convex set `K` fails to intersect a line `l` if and only if `K` is entirely contained in one of the two open half-planes defined by `l`.\nSo, for each line `l_{p,q}: px + qy = 1` in `L`, `K` must not be contained in the half-plane `px + qy > 1` and must not be contained in the half-plane `px + qy < 1`.\n\nThis translates into conditions on the support function of `K`, which is defined as `h_K(u, v) = sup_{(x,y)∈K} (ux + vy)`.\nThe condition that `K` is not in `px + qy > 1` means `sup_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≥ 1`, which is `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1`.\nThe condition that `K` is not in `px + qy < 1` means `inf_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≤ 1`. We know that `inf_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) = -h_K(-p, -q)`. So, `-h_K(-p, -q) ≤ 1`, which is equivalent to `h_K(-p, -q) ≥ -1`.\n\nLet's analyze these two conditions for any pair of coprime integers `(p, q)`:\n1.  `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1`\n2.  `h_K(-p, -q) ≥ -1`\n\nIf `(p, q)` are coprime integers, then `(-p, -q)` are also coprime integers. So, applying the first condition to the pair `(-p, -q)`, we get `h_K(-p, -q) ≥ 1`.\nSince `1 ≥ -1`, the condition `h_K(-p, -q) ≥ -1` is automatically satisfied if the first condition holds for all coprime pairs.\nTherefore, the problem is to find the minimal area of a convex domain `K` whose support function `h_K` satisfies `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1` for all coprime integer pairs `(p, q)`. Let's denote the set of primitive integer vectors `(p,q)` by `Z_prim^2`.\n\n**Step 2: The role of central symmetry**\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain that satisfies the condition. Let `-K = {(-x, -y) | (x, y) ∈ K}` be its reflection through the origin. Consider the centrally symmetric convex set `K_c = (1/2)(K + (-K))`, which is the Minkowski average of `K` and `-K`.\n\nThe support function of `K_c` is `h_{K_c}(u, v) = (1/2)(h_K(u, v) + h_K(-u, -v))`.\nFor any primitive pair `(p,q)`, `- (p,q)` is also primitive. Thus, `h_K(p,q) ≥ 1` and `h_K(-p,-q) ≥ 1`.\nSo, `h_{K_c}(p, q) = (1/2)(h_K(p, q) + h_K(-p, -q)) ≥ (1/2)(1 + 1) = 1`.\nThis means `K_c` also satisfies the condition.\n\nBy the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, `Area(K_c) ≥ Area(K)`. Equality holds if and only if `K` is a translate of `-K`, which means `K` is centrally symmetric (up to a translation, which does not affect the area).\nThis implies that if we are searching for a domain of minimal area, we only need to consider centrally symmetric convex domains.\n\n**Step 3: Using duality (polar bodies)**\n\nFor a centrally symmetric convex body `K` containing the origin, its polar dual `K^*` is defined as `K^* = {(u, v) | ux + vy ≤ 1 for all (x, y) ∈ K}`. `K^*` is also centrally symmetric and convex. The duality is symmetric: `(K^*)^* = K`.\n\nThe support function relates to the polar dual by the property: `h_K(u, v) ≥ 1` is equivalent to the point `(u, v)` not being in the interior of `K^*`.\nSo, the condition `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1` for all `(p,q) ∈ Z_prim^2` means that `K^*` must be a convex set whose interior contains no primitive integer points: `int(K^*) ∩ Z_prim^2 = ∅`.\n\nTo find the `K` with minimal area, we can use the Blaschke-Santaló inequality for centrally symmetric convex bodies in the plane: `Area(K) * Area(K^*) ≤ π^2`. While true, a tighter relation is needed. The Mahler volume `M(K) = Area(K) * Area(K^*)` is what we should look at.\nTo minimize `Area(K)`, we should maximize `Area(K^*)` while minimizing the Mahler volume `M(K)`.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the maximal area of the dual body**\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible area for `K^*`, a centrally symmetric convex body whose interior contains no primitive integer points.\nBy Minkowski's fundamental theorem, a centrally symmetric convex body in `R^2` with area greater than 4 must contain a non-zero integer lattice point `z = (a, b)` in its interior.\nIf `z` is in the interior of `K^*`, and `K^*` is convex and contains the origin, the point `z' = z/gcd(a, b)` also lies in the interior of `K^*`. This point `z'` is a primitive integer point.\nTherefore, to ensure `int(K^*) ∩ Z_prim^2 = ∅`, `K^*` must have an area of at most 4.\nSo, `max Area(K^*) = 4`.\n\nThis maximum area is achieved. For example, the square `S = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]` is a centrally symmetric convex body with `Area(S) = 4`. Its interior, `(-1, 1) × (-1, 1)`, contains no non-zero integer points, and thus no primitive integer points.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the minimal area**\n\nFor centrally symmetric convex bodies in `R^2`, Mahler's conjecture (proven by Mahler) states that the Mahler volume `M(K) = Area(K)Area(K^*)` is minimized by parallelograms, for which `M(K) = 8`. For all other bodies, `M(K) > 8`.\nWe have `Area(K) = M(K) / Area(K^*)`.\nTo minimize `Area(K)`, we should minimize `M(K)` and maximize `Area(K^*)`.\nUsing the bounds we found: `Area(K) ≥ 8 / 4 = 2`.\n\nThis lower bound of 2 is achievable if there exists a body `K` such that `M(K) = 8` and `Area(K^*) = 4`.\nThis occurs if `K` is a parallelogram and its polar dual `K^*` has area 4.\nLet's choose `K^*` to be the square `S = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`. It satisfies `Area(K^*) = 4` and it is a parallelogram.\nThe body `K` is the polar dual of this square `S`.\n`K = S^* = {(x, y) | ux + vy ≤ 1 for all (u, v) ∈ S}`.\nThis condition must hold for the vertices of `S`: `(±1, ±1)`.\nThis gives the four inequalities:\n*   `x + y ≤ 1`\n*   `x - y ≤ 1`\n*   `-x + y ≤ 1`\n*   `-x - y ≤ 1`\nThese inequalities define the convex domain `K = {(x, y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1}`. This is a diamond (a square rotated by 45 degrees) with vertices at `(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)`.\nThe area of this diamond is `(1/2) * d_1 * d_2 = (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\n\nThis body `K` has area 2, which matches the minimum possible value derived. It satisfies all the conditions, so the minimal area is 2.\n\n>>>2"
