    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific document in question:** The user asks about Albert Einstein's \"1905 paper on Brownian motion\". This refers to the paper titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). This is one of the four famous papers Einstein published in his \"miracle year\" of 1905.\n\n2.  **Examine the paper for citations:** A well-known and remarkable feature of this particular paper is that Einstein developed his argument from first principles and included **no citations or a bibliography**. He does not mention the work of Robert Brown (who first observed the motion), Louis Bachelier (who had developed a similar mathematical theory for stock options), or contemporary physicists working on statistical mechanics like J. Willard Gibbs. Therefore, strictly speaking, Einstein did not cite anyone's lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n3.  **Consider closely related contemporary work:** While the Brownian motion paper itself lacks citations, Einstein also completed his PhD dissertation in 1905, titled \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"). This work is intellectually linked to the Brownian motion paper, as both use statistical methods to make claims about atoms and molecules.\n\n4.  **Examine the citations in the PhD thesis:** Unlike the Brownian motion paper, Einstein's 1905 doctoral thesis **does** contain citations to the work of other scientists. In this thesis, he explicitly referenced a book by the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n5.  **Identify the specific work cited:** The work cited was Ludwig Boltzmann's book **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"**, which translates to **\"Lectures on Gas Theory\"**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the question contains a subtle inaccuracy. Einstein's 1905 paper *on Brownian motion* has no citations. However, his closely related *doctoral thesis*, also completed in 1905, does cite the lectures (in book form) of a specific physicist. This is almost certainly the information the user is seeking.\n\nThe person whose lectures (in book form, \"Lectures on Gas Theory\") Einstein cited in his closely related 1905 PhD thesis was **Ludwig Boltzmann**.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
