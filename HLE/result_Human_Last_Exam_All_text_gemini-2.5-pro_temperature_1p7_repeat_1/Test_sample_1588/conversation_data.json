    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$ where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables. The expansion is a series of homogeneous Lie polynomials in $X$ and $Y$.\n$Z = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\nHere, $Z_n(X, Y)$ is the term of order (or degree) $n$, which is a linear combination of nested commutators of total degree $n$. For example:\n*   **Order 1:** $Z_1 = X + Y$\n*   **Order 2:** $Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]$\n*   **Order 3:** $Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] + \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [Y, X]]$\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Problem to Free Lie Algebras\n\nThe question asks for the \"number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\". In the context of the BCH formula, this is equivalent to finding the number of linearly independent Lie brackets of degree 10 in two variables, $X$ and $Y$. This number corresponds to the dimension of the homogeneous component of degree 10 of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements.\n\n### Step 3: Use Witt's Formula\n\nThe dimension of the homogeneous component of degree $n$ of the free Lie algebra on $k$ generators, denoted $L_n(k)$, can be calculated using Witt's formula:\n$L_n(k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\nwhere:\n*   $n$ is the degree (order).\n*   $k$ is the number of generators.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n### Step 4: Apply Witt's Formula to the Specific Problem\n\nIn our case:\n*   The order is $n=10$.\n*   The number of generators is $k=2$ (since the expansion is in terms of $X$ and $Y$).\n\nWe need to calculate $L_{10}(2)$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Identify the divisors of n.**\nThe positive divisors of $n=10$ are $d = \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor.**\nThe Möbius function is defined as:\n*   $\\mu(1) = 1$.\n*   $\\mu(n) = (-1)^m$ if $n$ is a product of $m$ distinct primes.\n*   $\\mu(n) = 0$ if $n$ has a squared prime factor.\n\nLet's calculate the values for our divisors:\n*   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n*   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is a single prime, so $m=1$)\n*   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is a single prime, so $m=1$)\n*   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (10 is a product of 2 distinct primes)\n\n### Step 5: Substitute the Values and Calculate the Final Result\n\nNow, we substitute these values into Witt's formula:\n$L_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d \\in \\{1,2,5,10\\}} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n\nLet's expand the sum term by term:\n*   For $d=1$: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = (1) \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$\n*   For $d=2$: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} = -32$\n*   For $d=5$: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} = -4$\n*   For $d=10$: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = (1) \\cdot 2^{1} = 2$\n\n**Careful Point 3: Perform the arithmetic carefully.**\nNow sum the terms and divide by $n=10$:\n$L_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} [1024 + (-32) + (-4) + 2]$\n$L_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]$\n$L_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} [990]$\n$L_{10}(2) = 99$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe calculation shows that the dimension of the space of Lie polynomials of degree 10 in two variables is 99. Since the BCH formula over the rational numbers has non-zero coefficients for all basis elements of the free Lie algebra, the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
