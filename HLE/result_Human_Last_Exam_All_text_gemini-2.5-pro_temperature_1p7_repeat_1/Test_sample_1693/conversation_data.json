    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks for a specific ship based on four key criteria:\n1.  **Nationality:** French.\n2.  **Size:** Largest by displacement. For large civilian ships like liners and tankers, this is typically measured in Gross Registered Tonnage (GRT).\n3.  **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by a German U-boat.\n4.  **Timeframe:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940. The war for France began on 3 September 1939.\n\n### **Step 2: Define \"Sunk by a U-boat\"**\n\nThis is a critical point. A sinking can be attributed to a U-boat through several actions:\n*   **Torpedo attack:** The most common and direct method.\n*   **Deck gun attack:** Used against smaller or undefended ships, especially early in the war.\n*   **Mines laid by a U-boat:** U-boats were frequently used as minelayers. A ship striking a mine laid by a specific U-boat is considered a \"kill\" for that submarine.\n\nFor the purpose of this analysis, all of the above methods are considered a sinking \"by a U-boat.\"\n\n### **Step 3: Research and Identify Potential Candidates**\n\nWe need to search historical records for French ships lost to U-boat action between 3 September 1939 and 22 June 1940, and then sort them by tonnage.\n\n*   **Initial search:** Looking at lists of U-boat successes in this period, several large French ships appear.\n*   **Candidate 1: Tanker *Émile Miguet***\n    *   **Tonnage:** 14,115 GRT.\n    *   **Date Sunk:** 12 October 1939.\n    *   **Cause:** Hit by two torpedoes from U-48.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a very large tanker and a strong candidate, sunk by direct torpedo attack well within the specified timeframe.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: Passenger Liner *Bretagne***\n    *   **Tonnage:** 10,123 GRT.\n    *   **Date Sunk:** 14 October 1939.\n    *   **Cause:** Sunk by U-45.\n    *   **Analysis:** A large ship, but smaller than *Émile Miguet*.\n\n*   **Candidate 3: Passenger Liner *Champlain***\n    *   **Tonnage:** 28,124 GRT.\n    *   **Date Sunk:** 17 June 1940.\n    *   **Cause:** Struck a mine off La Pallice, France.\n    *   **Analysis:** At 28,124 GRT, this ship is significantly larger than any other candidate. The date of sinking is just five days before the armistice, so it falls within the required period. The crucial point is the origin of the mine. Historical records, including the war diary (KTB) of the German submarine, confirm the mine was laid by **U-65** on 14 June 1940. Therefore, its sinking is directly attributed to the action of a U-boat.\n\n### **Step 4: Compare Candidates and Finalize**\n\nComparing the leading candidates:\n*   *Émile Miguet*: 14,115 GRT (sunk by torpedo)\n*   *Champlain*: 28,124 GRT (sunk by U-boat-laid mine)\n\nThe *Champlain* is almost twice the size of the *Émile Miguet*. As a sinking by a mine laid by a U-boat is considered a sinking \"by a U-boat,\" the *Champlain* is the correct answer. No French warship of comparable size was sunk by a U-boat in this period.\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the passenger liner *Champlain*.\n\n<<<Champlain>>>"
