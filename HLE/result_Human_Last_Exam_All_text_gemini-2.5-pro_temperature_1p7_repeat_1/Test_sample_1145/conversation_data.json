    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n*   **System:** A particle in a one-dimensional (1D) box.\n*   **Box dimensions:** The box extends from `x = 0` to `x = a`.\n*   **Quantum state:** The particle is in the first excited state, which corresponds to the principal quantum number `n = 2`.\n*   **Interval of interest:** We want to find the particle in the interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the probability `P` of finding the particle within this specific interval.\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Formulas**\n*   The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is:\n    `ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`\n*   The probability density function is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\n    `P(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)`\n*   The probability of finding the particle between two points `x₁` and `x₂` is the integral of the probability density function over that interval:\n    `P(x₁ < x < x₂) = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] |ψn(x)|² dx`\n\n**3. Substitute the Specific Values for this Problem**\n*   Given `n = 2`, the probability density function is:\n    `|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a)`\n*   The interval is `x₁ = 0.495a` and `x₂ = 0.505a`.\n*   The integral we need to solve is:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n\n**4. Careful Point: Analysis of the Interval**\n*   The interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]` is centered at `x = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a = a/2`.\n*   The width of the interval is `Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`.\n*   For the `n=2` state, the point `x = a/2` is a node. A node is a point where the wavefunction is zero, and therefore the probability density is also zero:\n    `|ψ₂(a/2)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2π(a/2) / a) = (2/a) * sin²(π) = (2/a) * 0² = 0`.\n*   Because the interval is very small and centered on a point of zero probability, we expect the total probability to be very small, but not exactly zero. A simple approximation like `P ≈ |ψ₂(a/2)|² * Δx` would incorrectly give 0. We must perform the integration.\n\n**5. Solving the Integral using Approximation**\nSince the integration interval `Δx = 0.01a` is very small, we can make an approximation on the integrand, which simplifies the calculation significantly.\n\n*   **Change of Variables:** To simplify the process, let's shift the origin to the center of the interval, `a/2`. Let `u = x - a/2`. This means `x = u + a/2`.\n    *   When `x = 0.495a`, `u = 0.495a - 0.5a = -0.005a`.\n    *   When `x = 0.505a`, `u = 0.505a - 0.5a = +0.005a`.\n    *   The differential `dx` becomes `du`.\n\n*   **Transform the Integrand:**\n    *   The argument of the sine function becomes `2πx/a = 2π(u + a/2)/a = 2πu/a + π`.\n    *   Using the trigonometric identity `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`, we have `sin(2πu/a + π) = -sin(2πu/a)`.\n    *   Therefore, `sin²(2πx/a) = [-sin(2πu/a)]² = sin²(2πu/a)`.\n\n*   **The Transformed Integral:**\n    `P = ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (2/a) * sin²(2πu/a) du`\n\n*   **Small-Angle Approximation:** The new integration limits for `u` are very close to zero. Over this small range, the argument of the sine function, `θ = 2πu/a`, is also very small. We can use the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\n    *   `sin²(2πu/a) ≈ (2πu/a)² = 4π²u² / a²`\n\n*   **The Approximated Integral:**\n    `P ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (2/a) * (4π²u² / a²) du`\n    `P ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] u² du`\n\n**6. Evaluate the Final Integral**\n*   The integral of `u²` is `u³/3`.\n    `P ≈ (8π²/a³) * [u³/3]` evaluated from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n*   `P ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]`\n*   `P ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [2 * (0.005a)³]`\n*   `P ≈ (16π²/3a³) * (0.005³ * a³)`\n\n*   **Cancel terms and calculate the numerical value:** The `a³` terms cancel out.\n    `P ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³`\n    `P ≈ (16π²/3) * (1.25 × 10⁻⁷)`\n    Using `π² ≈ 9.8696`:\n    `P ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * (1.25 × 10⁻⁷)`\n    `P ≈ (52.638) * (1.25 × 10⁻⁷)`\n    `P ≈ 65.7975 × 10⁻⁷`\n    `P ≈ 6.58 × 10⁻⁶`\n\nThe probability is approximately 0.00000658.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability that the particle in the 1D box is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n = 2 is approximately `6.58 x 10⁻⁶`.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
