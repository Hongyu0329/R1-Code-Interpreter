    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand Critical-Level Views**\n\nA Critical-Level View (CLV) is a theory in population ethics for evaluating the goodness of populations. According to this view, the value of a population is calculated as the sum of \"value-adjusted\" welfare for all individuals in it. The formula is:\n\n*   Value = Σ (wᵢ - c)\n\nWhere:\n*   `wᵢ` is the welfare (or utility) of individual `i`.\n*   `c` is a fixed positive number called the \"critical level\".\n\nThis means:\n*   Adding a person with welfare greater than `c` (w > c) increases the total value of the population.\n*   Adding a person with welfare less than `c` (w < c) decreases the total value.\n*   Adding a person with welfare equal to `c` (w = c) leaves the total value unchanged.\n\nA key feature is that a life can have positive welfare (i.e., be worth living for the person) but still be a negative contribution to the value of the population if that welfare is below the critical level `c`.\n\n**2. Understand Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem and Its Conditions**\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem shows that a set of plausible-sounding ethical principles cannot all be satisfied simultaneously by any population axiology. The question asks which of these principles is violated by Critical-Level Views. Let's examine each condition:\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:** This principle states that if we have two populations of the same size, and one is perfectly equal while the other is unequal, the equal population is better if two things are true: (1) the worst-off in the unequal population are worse off than the people in the equal one, and (2) the total welfare in the unequal population is lower. Critical-Level Views respect this. If total welfare is lower, `Σwᵢ` is lower. The value `Σ(wᵢ - c)` = `(Σwᵢ) - n*c` will also be lower. So, this condition is **satisfied**.\n\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority (GNEP):** This principle states that for any welfare level, a small welfare loss for a sufficiently large number of people is worse than a massive welfare gain for a smaller number of people. Critical-Level Views are purely additive regarding welfare changes for a fixed population, so they prioritize numbers in this way. This condition is **satisfied**.\n\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:** This principle states that, other things being equal, adding a person with positive welfare is at least as good as adding a person with negative welfare. For CLV, adding a person with welfare `w₁ > 0` gives a value change of `w₁ - c`. Adding a person with welfare `w₂ < 0` gives a value change of `w₂ - c`. Since `w₁ > w₂`, it's true that `w₁ - c > w₂ - c`. So this condition is **satisfied**.\n\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition (WQA):** This principle requires that there is *at least one* positive welfare level `w` such that adding a person with this welfare is *always* an improvement, regardless of the initial population. In a CLV with critical level `c`, we can simply choose any welfare level `w` that is greater than `c` (e.g., `w = c + 1`). Adding a person with this welfare level increases the total value by `(w - c)`, which is positive. This holds for any starting population. So this condition is **satisfied**.\n\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:** This principle is designed to prevent a small elite class from being considered more valuable than a vast number of people living decent lives. A common formulation of this principle is that for any low positive welfare level `e`, a sufficiently large population of people living at that level `e` is better than a small population of people living at a very high welfare level.\n\n    Let's test CLV against this principle.\n    *   Consider a small \"elite\" population A, with one person at a very high welfare level, `w_high`. Its value is `V(A) = w_high - c`. Assuming `w_high > c`, this value is positive.\n    *   Consider a large population B, with `N` people, all at a low but positive welfare level, `e`. For example, let's say `e=1`. Its value is `V(B) = N * (e - c)`.\n    *   The Non-Elitism principle says we should be able to make B better than A by making `N` large enough.\n    *   However, with CLV, we can choose our positive critical level `c` to be greater than `e` (e.g., `c=10`).\n    *   In this case, `V(A)` is positive, but `V(B) = N * (1 - 10) = -9N`. The value of population B is negative. As we increase the number of people `N`, the value of B becomes *more negative*.\n    *   A negative value can never be greater than a positive value. So, it is impossible for population B to be better than population A.\n    *   Therefore, CLV fails to satisfy this condition.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCritical-Level Views violate the principle of Non-Elitism because they allow for scenarios where a small group of very happy people is considered better than any number of people whose positive welfare falls below the critical level.\n\n<<<C>>>"
