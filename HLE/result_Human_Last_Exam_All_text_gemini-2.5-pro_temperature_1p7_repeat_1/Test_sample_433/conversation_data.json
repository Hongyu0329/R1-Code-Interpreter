    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question regarding the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Product:** A single-dose container, specifically an **ampule**. An ampule is a sealed glass container that must be broken to be opened and cannot be resealed.\n    *   **Action:** Punctured (in this case, broken open).\n    *   **Environment:** A sterile environment. According to pharmacy standards (USP <797>), this refers to an ISO Class 5 or cleaner Primary Engineering Control (PEC), such as a laminar airflow workbench or a biological safety cabinet.\n    *   **Question:** What is the **BUD (Beyond-Use Date)** for this opened container? The BUD is the time after which the product must not be used.\n\n2.  **Consult the Authoritative Standard:**\n    The primary source for rules on sterile compounding and BUDs in the United States is the **United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations**. The most recent version became official on November 1, 2023.\n\n3.  **Differentiate Between Container Types:**\n    USP <797> makes a critical distinction between different types of single-dose containers.\n    *   **Single-Dose Vial (with a rubber stopper):** When punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment, a single-dose vial can be used for up to **12 hours** after the initial puncture. This is because the elastomeric closure (rubber stopper) can reseal itself after being punctured by a needle.\n    *   **Single-Dose Ampule:** An ampule is different. Once the glass is broken, it becomes an open system, fully exposed to the surrounding air (even the filtered air of the PEC). It cannot be resealed.\n\n4.  **Apply the Specific Rule for Ampules:**\n    Because an ampule is an open-system container that cannot be stored without risk of contamination, USP <797> provides a very strict and specific rule. The chapter states:\n    > \"Ampules must not be stored for any period of time after being opened... After the contents are withdrawn from an opened ampule, any unused portion of the contents must be discarded.\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the explicit directive from USP <797>, an opened ampule has no storage time. The sterile environment allows for the aseptic withdrawal of its contents, but it does not grant any extension to the life of the opened container itself. The contents must be withdrawn and used immediately, and then the ampule and any leftover drug must be discarded. Therefore, the BUD for the opened ampule is \"immediate use only.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ampule vs. Vial:** Do not confuse the rule for an ampule with the rule for a single-dose vial. A vial with a rubber stopper has a 12-hour BUD after puncture in an ISO 5 environment, whereas an ampule does not.\n2.  **\"Immediate Use\":** This term means the preparation and administration of the medication must occur as part of one continuous process without any interruption or storage.\n3.  **No Storage Allowed:** The rule for ampules is absolute. They cannot be stored \"for any period of time,\" meaning you cannot open one, draw up a dose, and come back a few minutes or an hour later to draw up a second dose. The entire ampule and any unused contents must be discarded after the initial withdrawal.\n4.  **Environment Does Not Change the Rule:** Even though the work is being done in a highly sterile ISO Class 5 environment, this does not change the rule for ampules. The rule is based on the nature of the container (an unsealable open system), not just the quality of the surrounding air.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAccording to USP Chapter <797>, an opened ampule must be used immediately. It cannot be stored for any period of time. The opened ampule and any unused contents must be discarded immediately after the initial withdrawal of the dose.\n\n<<<An opened ampule must be used immediately. It cannot be stored, and the opened ampule and any unused contents must be discarded.>>>"
