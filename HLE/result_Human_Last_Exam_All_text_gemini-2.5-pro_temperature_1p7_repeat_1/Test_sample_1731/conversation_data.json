    "This problem asks for the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy for a gas of photons (light quanta) using the principles of Large Deviation Theory (LDT), specifically referencing the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Conceptual Framework: Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics\n\nLarge Deviation Theory (LDT) provides a mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics. The core idea is that macroscopic equilibrium properties emerge because one specific macroscopic state is overwhelmingly more probable than all others.\n\n1.  **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem deals with the probability of an *empirical distribution* deviating from the true underlying distribution. In statistical mechanics, we can think of the distribution of particles across energy levels as an empirical distribution. Sanov's theorem tells us that the probability of observing a particular particle distribution $\\{n_j\\}$ is exponentially small in the number of particles, with a \"rate function\" that measures the \"distance\" from the most probable distribution. This rate function is directly proportional to the negative of the system's entropy. Therefore, the principle of **maximizing entropy** to find the equilibrium state is equivalent to finding the distribution that **minimizes the rate function** (i.e., the most probable distribution). For Bose-Einstein statistics, the entropy functional is the specific rate function we must maximize.\n\n2.  **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem provides a large deviation principle for the *sum* of random variables, such as the total energy of the system ($U = \\sum n_j \\epsilon_j$). It establishes a Legendre transform relationship between the rate function for the total energy and the logarithm of the partition function. This formalism is the foundation of the canonical ensemble, where relationships between free energy, internal energy, and entropy are all expressed as Legendre transforms.\n\nIn essence, these theorems justify the procedure we will now follow: finding the particle distribution that maximizes the appropriate entropy functional subject to macroscopic constraints.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Step 1: Define the System and the Entropy Functional for Bosons\n\n*   **System:** We are considering a gas of photons (light quanta). Photons are bosons.\n*   **State:** A microstate is a specific configuration of photons in the available energy levels. A macrostate is defined by the number of photons, $n_j$, in each energy level $\\epsilon_j$, where level $j$ may have a degeneracy of $g_j$ states.\n*   **Counting Microstates (Bose-Einstein Statistics):** The number of ways to place $n_j$ indistinguishable photons into $g_j$ degenerate states for energy level $\\epsilon_j$ is given by $\\Omega_j = \\binom{n_j + g_j - 1}{n_j}$.\n*   **Total Microstates:** The total number of microstates for a given macrostate $\\{n_j\\}$ is $\\Omega = \\prod_j \\Omega_j$.\n*   **Entropy Functional:** According to Boltzmann's principle, the entropy is $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. We will set the Boltzmann constant $k_B=1$ for simplicity and reintroduce it at the end.\n    $S(\\{n_j\\}) = \\ln \\Omega = \\sum_j \\ln \\left( \\frac{(n_j + g_j - 1)!}{n_j! (g_j - 1)!} \\right)$\n    Using Stirling's approximation ($\\ln x! \\approx x \\ln x - x$ for large $x$), this simplifies to:\n    $S(\\{n_j\\}) \\approx \\sum_j [ (n_j + g_j) \\ln(n_j + g_j) - n_j \\ln n_j - g_j \\ln g_j ]$\n    This is the entropy functional we need to maximize.\n\n#### Step 2: Define the Constraints\n\n1.  **Conservation of Energy:** The total energy of the system is held constant at a value $U$.\n    $U = \\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j$\n2.  **Conservation of Particles (Careful Point!):** For a gas of photons, the particle number is **not conserved**. Photons can be emitted or absorbed by the walls of the container. This means there is no constraint on the total number of particles, $N = \\sum_j n_j$. In the language of thermodynamics, this corresponds to the chemical potential being zero ($\\mu=0$).\n\n#### Step 3: Maximize Entropy via Lagrange Multipliers\n\nWe seek to find the distribution $\\{n_j\\}$ that maximizes $S(\\{n_j\\})$ subject to the energy constraint. We define the Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$:\n$\\mathcal{L} = S(\\{n_j\\}) - \\beta \\left( \\sum_j n_j \\epsilon_j - U \\right)$\nwhere $\\beta$ is a Lagrange multiplier. To find the maximum, we set the partial derivative with respect to each $n_j$ to zero:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_j} = \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial n_j} - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of the entropy:\n$\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial n_j} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_j} [ (n_j + g_j) \\ln(n_j + g_j) - n_j \\ln n_j - g_j \\ln g_j ]$\n$= [\\ln(n_j+g_j) + 1] - [\\ln n_j + 1] = \\ln\\left(\\frac{n_j+g_j}{n_j}\\right) = \\ln\\left(1+\\frac{g_j}{n_j}\\right)$\n\nSetting the full derivative to zero gives the condition for the equilibrium occupation numbers, which we denote by $\\langle n_j \\rangle$:\n$\\ln\\left(1+\\frac{g_j}{\\langle n_j \\rangle}\\right) - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n$\\ln\\left(1+\\frac{g_j}{\\langle n_j \\rangle}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_j$\n\n#### Step 4: Find the Equilibrium Distribution and Identify $\\beta$\n\nSolving the equation from Step 3 for the average occupation number $\\langle n_j \\rangle$:\n$1+\\frac{g_j}{\\langle n_j \\rangle} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}$\n$\\frac{g_j}{\\langle n_j \\rangle} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1$\n$\\langle n_j \\rangle = \\frac{g_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n\nThis is the famous **Planck distribution** for photons. The Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ is identified with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n#### Step 5: Calculate the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy is obtained by substituting the equilibrium distribution $\\langle n_j \\rangle$ back into the energy constraint equation. This gives the mean energy as a function of temperature (via $\\beta$).\n\n$U(\\beta) = \\sum_j \\langle n_j \\rangle \\epsilon_j = \\sum_j \\frac{g_j \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n\nThis expression gives the equilibrium mean energy for a given temperature and energy level structure $\\{\\epsilon_j, g_j\\}$.\n\n#### Step 6: Calculate the Equilibrium Entropy (S)\n\nThe equilibrium entropy is found by plugging the equilibrium distribution $\\langle n_j \\rangle$ back into the entropy functional.\n$S = \\sum_j [ (\\langle n_j \\rangle + g_j) \\ln(\\langle n_j \\rangle + g_j) - \\langle n_j \\rangle \\ln \\langle n_j \\rangle - g_j \\ln g_j ]$\nWe can simplify this using the result from Step 3: $\\ln(\\frac{\\langle n_j \\rangle+g_j}{\\langle n_j \\rangle}) = \\beta \\epsilon_j$.\n$S = \\sum_j [ \\langle n_j \\rangle \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\langle n_j \\rangle+g_j}{\\langle n_j \\rangle}\\right) + g_j \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\langle n_j \\rangle+g_j}{g_j}\\right) ]$\n$S = \\sum_j [ \\langle n_j \\rangle (\\beta \\epsilon_j) + g_j \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{\\langle n_j \\rangle}{g_j}\\right) ]$\n$S = \\beta \\sum_j \\langle n_j \\rangle \\epsilon_j + \\sum_j g_j \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}\\right)$\n$S = \\beta U + \\sum_j g_j \\ln\\left(\\frac{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}\\right)$\n$S = \\beta U - \\sum_j g_j \\ln(e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}(e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1)) = \\beta U - \\sum_j g_j \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j})$\n\nFinally, reintroducing the Boltzmann constant $k_B$:\n$S/k_B = \\beta U - \\sum_j g_j \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j})$\n\nThis final expression relates entropy to mean energy and temperature. It is also equivalent to the thermodynamic relation $S = (U-F)/T$, where $F = -k_B T \\ln Z$ is the Helmholtz free energy for the photon gas.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas (the Bose case of light quanta) are found by maximizing the Bose-Einstein entropy functional subject to a constraint on the total energy. This procedure is justified by the large deviation theorems of Sanov and Cramer. The resulting equilibrium values are functions of the inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ and the system's energy level structure ($\\epsilon_j$, $g_j$).\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\nThe equilibrium mean energy $U$ is given by the sum over all energy levels of the energy of each level multiplied by its average occupation number according to the Planck distribution:\n$U = \\sum_{j} \\frac{g_j \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}-1}$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\nThe equilibrium entropy $S$ is given by the expression:\n$\\frac{S}{k_B} = \\beta U - \\sum_{j} g_j \\ln(1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_j})$\n\nWhere:\n*   $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature.\n*   $\\epsilon_j$ is the energy of the $j$-th level.\n*   $g_j$ is the degeneracy (number of states) of the $j$-th level.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy: $U = \\sum_{j} \\frac{g_j \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}-1}$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $\\frac{S}{k_B} = \\frac{U}{k_B T} - \\sum_{j} g_j \\ln(1-e^{-\\epsilon_j/(k_B T)})$\n>>>"
