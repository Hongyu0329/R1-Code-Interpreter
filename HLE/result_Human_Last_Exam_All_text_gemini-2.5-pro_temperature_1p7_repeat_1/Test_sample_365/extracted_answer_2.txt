The product is a bicyclic ketone with a cis-fused bicyclo[6.3.0]undecane skeleton. The structure contains an eight-membered ring bearing the ketone and the (tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy group, fused to a five-membered ring that contains a double bond and a gem-dimethoxy group. This is the result of a concerted anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement followed by protonation/tautomerization.
