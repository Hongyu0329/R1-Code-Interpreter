    "This problem is a question of information theory, asking for the maximum length of a message that can be encoded within a given medium. Let's break it down.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Alphabet of the Message:** The secret message is written using the letters (characters) from the Shu. The problem states that the Shu is written with \"only 120 most common Chinese characters\". Therefore, the set of possible characters for the secret message, which is our alphabet, has a size of 120.\n    *   Number of unique characters for the message = 120.\n\n2.  **Identify the Symbols Used for Encoding:** The message is encrypted using the symbols in the Ching book. These symbols are described as \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n    *   **Yinyang** has two states: yin (阴) and yang (阳).\n    *   **Wuxing** (The Five Elements) has five states: metal (金), wood (木), water (水), fire (火), and earth (土).\n    *   A single symbol is a combination of these, like \"yin-water\". The total number of unique symbol types is the product of the number of states: 2 (yinyang) × 5 (wuxing) = 10 unique symbol types.\n\n3.  **Determine the Encoding Scheme:** We need to figure out how many of the Ching's symbols are required to represent one character of the message. We have 120 different message characters to represent using a system that has 10 unique symbols.\n    *   Let `L` be the number of Ching symbols needed to encode one message character.\n    *   Using 1 symbol, we can represent `10^1 = 10` different states. This is not enough to represent 120 characters.\n    *   Using 2 symbols, we can represent `10^2 = 100` different states. This is still not enough.\n    *   Using 3 symbols, we can represent `10^3 = 1000` different states. This is more than enough to represent all 120 characters.\n    *   Therefore, the most efficient fixed-length encoding requires a sequence of **3** yinyang-wuxing symbols to represent one character of the secret message.\n\n4.  **Identify the Total Number of Available Encoding Symbols:** The problem states that \"The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing\".\n    *   Total symbols available in the Ching = 9999.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Maximum Message Length:** Now we can calculate the maximum length of the message by dividing the total number of available symbols by the number of symbols required per character.\n    *   Max Message Length = (Total available symbols) / (Symbols needed per character)\n    *   Max Message Length = 9999 / 3\n    *   Max Message Length = 3333 characters.\n\n### Careful Points and Red Herrings:\n\n*   The information about the Shu containing \"around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\" is irrelevant. The crucial piece of information is the size of the unique character set used, which is 120.\n*   The computation times (12 ms for vision, 10 ns for integers, 30 ns for floats) are distractions. They are related to the process of discovering the message, not to the message's fundamental properties like its length. This is a problem about information capacity, not computation speed.\n*   The calculation `9999 / 3` results in a whole number, 3333. If it had resulted in a fraction (e.g., if there were 10000 symbols), the answer would be the floor of the result (e.g., `floor(10000/3) = 3333`), as you cannot encode a partial character.\n\n### Final Calculation:\n\n*   Alphabet Size: 120\n*   Encoding Base: 10\n*   Symbols per Character: `ceil(log10(120)) = ceil(2.079) = 3`\n*   Total Symbols: 9999\n*   Maximum Length: `floor(9999 / 3) = 3333`\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 3333 characters.\n\n<<<3333>>>"
