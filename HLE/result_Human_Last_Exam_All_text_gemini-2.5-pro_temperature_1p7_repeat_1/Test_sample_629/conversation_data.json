    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Understand the components of the question:**\n    *   **Grid Diagram:** A knot representation on an `n x n` grid where each row and each column contains exactly one 'X' and one 'O'. The knot is traced by connecting X's and O's in rows and columns, with the convention that vertical strands (connecting markers in the same column) pass over horizontal strands (connecting markers in the same row).\n    *   **Left-hand Trefoil Knot:** One of the two chiral versions of the trefoil knot (3_1). The other is the right-hand trefoil. They are mirror images of each other but cannot be deformed into one another.\n    *   **Minimal Grid Number:** The smallest `n` for which an `n x n` grid diagram of the knot exists. For the trefoil knot, the minimal grid number is `n=3`. Thus, we are looking for diagrams on a 3x3 grid.\n    *   **Up to Translation and Rotation:** We need to count the number of unique diagrams, where diagrams are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into another by cyclic shifts of rows/columns (translation) or by rotations of the grid (90, 180, 270 degrees).\n\n2.  **Identify the grid diagrams for the trefoil knot:**\n    *   A grid diagram is defined by a pair of permutations `(σ, τ)` of `{1, ..., n}`. For a 3x3 grid, `σ` and `τ` are permutations in the symmetric group `S_3`. `σ` determines the row of the 'X' in each column, and `τ` determines the row of the 'O' in each column.\n    *   The knot type represented by a diagram `(σ, τ)` is determined by the permutation `π = τσ⁻¹`.\n    *   For a diagram on an `n x n` grid to represent a knot (a single component link), `π` must be a single cycle of length `n`. For `n=3`, the single-cycle permutations are the 3-cycles: `c = (1 2 3)` and `c⁻¹ = (1 3 2)`.\n    *   It's a known result from knot theory that one of these permutations corresponds to the right-hand trefoil and the other to the left-hand trefoil. Let's assume (without loss of generality, as the final count will be symmetric) that `π = τσ⁻¹ = (1 3 2)` corresponds to the left-hand trefoil (LHT).\n    *   The set of all minimal grid diagrams for the LHT consists of all pairs `(σ, τ)` where `σ` is any of the `3! = 6` permutations in `S_3`, and `τ` is fixed by the relation `τ = (1 3 2)σ`. This gives a total of 6 diagrams for the LHT.\n\n3.  **Define the equivalence relations (symmetries) and their effect:**\n    *   Let `D_LHT` be the set of the 6 diagrams representing the LHT. We need to count the number of equivalence classes (orbits) of `D_LHT` under the action of grid translations and rotations.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** An equivalence relation can only exist between two diagrams *of the same type*. If a symmetry operation (like rotation) transforms an LHT diagram into a right-hand trefoil (RHT) diagram or a link, it cannot be used to equate two LHT diagrams. We must check if the symmetries preserve the knot type.\n\n4.  **Analyze the effect of translations:**\n    *   Translations are cyclic shifts of rows or columns. This operation corresponds to conjugating the permutation `π` by a cyclic permutation. In `S_3`, conjugation preserves the cycle structure, so `π = (1 3 2)` remains a 3-cycle. In fact, for `n=3`, conjugation by a 3-cycle does not change the permutation `π`. Thus, translations map an LHT diagram to another LHT diagram.\n    *   The 6 diagrams for the LHT are `{(σ, (1 3 2)σ) | σ ∈ S_3}`.\n    *   The group `S_3` can be partitioned into two cosets of the cyclic subgroup `A_3 = {e, c, c⁻¹}`. The first coset is `A_3` itself, and the second is `{s₁, s₂, w₀}` where `s₁=(12), s₂=(23), w₀=(13)`.\n    *   The action of translations on the set of 6 LHT diagrams partitions them into two orbits (equivalence classes):\n        *   **Orbit 1:** The 3 diagrams where `σ` is from `A_3`. A representative is `(e, (1 3 2))`.\n        *   **Orbit 2:** The 3 diagrams where `σ` is from the other coset. A representative is `(s₁, (1 3 2)s₁)`.\n    *   Up to translation alone, there are **2** distinct diagrams.\n\n5.  **Analyze the effect of rotations:**\n    *   **Rotation by 180 degrees:** This transformation acts on the permutation `π` by conjugation: `π' = w₀πw₀`, where `w₀=(13)`.\n        Let `π = (1 3 2)` (our LHT). The new permutation is `π' = (13)(132)(13) = (312) = (123)`.\n        This new permutation `π'` corresponds to the RHT. Therefore, 180-degree rotation changes the handedness of the knot. It cannot be used to equate two LHT diagrams.\n    *   **Rotation by 90 degrees:** Since a 180-degree rotation is simply a 90-degree rotation applied twice, and we've found that `rot180` is not a valid symmetry for this problem, it follows that `rot90` cannot be either. If `rot90` were a valid symmetry, `rot90²=rot180` would also have to be, which leads to a contradiction.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The only symmetries that preserve the \"left-handed trefoil\" property are the translations. Rotations change the handedness of the knot.\n    *   Under the action of translations, the 6 possible minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil are partitioned into 2 equivalence classes.\n    *   Therefore, there are 2 distinct grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil up to the allowed symmetries (translation and any rotation that preserves handedness, which in this case is none).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThere are 2 distinct minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot up to translation and rotation."
