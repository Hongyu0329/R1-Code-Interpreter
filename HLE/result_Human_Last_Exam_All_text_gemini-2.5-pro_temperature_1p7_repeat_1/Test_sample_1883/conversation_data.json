    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction:**\n    *   Reactant: \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\n    *   Reaction: Thermal electrocyclization. The conjugated system is an octatetraene (from C2 to C9), which is an 8π-electron system.\n\n2.  **Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory / Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:**\n    *   An 8π-electron system is a 4n system (where n=2).\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for a thermal reaction of a 4n system, the electrocyclization must proceed in a **conrotatory** fashion. This means the terminal p-orbitals of the conjugated system (at C2 and C9) must rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise) to form the new sigma bond.\n    *   FMO theory supports this: For an 8π system, the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) in the ground state is ψ₄. The symmetry of the terminal lobes of ψ₄ is antisymmetric (one lobe points up, the other points down on the same side of the molecule). To achieve constructive overlap for bonding, the termini must undergo conrotation.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Starting Material's Termini:**\n    *   The ring closure occurs between C2 and C9. We need to determine the orientation of the substituents on these carbons. The substituents are a methyl group (CH₃) and a hydrogen atom (H) at each end.\n    *   We classify substituents as pointing \"inward\" (into the C-shape of the polyene about to cyclize) or \"outward\".\n    *   At C2, the double bond C2=C3 has a (Z) configuration. In the s-cis conformation required for reaction, the methyl group points **inward**, and the hydrogen atom points **outward**.\n    *   At C9, the double bond C8=C9 has an (E) configuration. In the s-cis conformation, the methyl group points **outward**, and the hydrogen atom points **inward**.\n    *   Summary of termini substituents:\n        *   C2: CH₃ (in), H (out)\n        *   C9: H (in), CH₃ (out)\n\n4.  **Analyze the Two Possible Conrotatory Pathways and their Transition States:**\n    The reaction must be conrotatory, but there are two ways this can happen: both ends rotate clockwise (CW), or both ends rotate counter-clockwise (CCW). These two pathways are diastereomeric and lead to different products. We need to assess the steric hindrance in each pathway to determine which is favored. This is known as torquoselectivity. The general principle is that large substituents prefer to rotate \"outward\" away from the rest of the molecule to minimize steric clash in the transition state.\n\n    *   **Pathway 1: Both termini rotate Clockwise (CW/CW).**\n        *   At C2: The CH₃ group is \"in\". A CW rotation moves it **outward** (energetically favorable). The H atom (out) rotates inward.\n        *   At C9: The CH₃ group is \"out\". A CW rotation moves it **inward** (energetically unfavorable). The H atom (in) rotates outward.\n        *   In this transition state, the favorable outward rotation at C2 is counteracted by an unfavorable inward rotation of the methyl group at C9.\n\n    *   **Pathway 2: Both termini rotate Counter-Clockwise (CCW/CCW).**\n        *   At C2: The CH₃ group is \"in\". A CCW rotation moves it **inward** (energetically unfavorable). The H atom (out) rotates outward.\n        *   At C9: The CH₃ group is \"out\". A CCW rotation moves it **outward** (energetically favorable). The H atom (in) rotates inward.\n        *   In this transition state, an unfavorable inward rotation of the methyl group at C2 is counteracted by a favorable outward rotation at C9.\n\n5.  **Predict the Ratio of Products:**\n    *   The question states that two isomers, A (cis) and B (trans), are formed. This implies that both conrotatory pathways are accessible. The ratio of the products A:B will be determined by the relative rates of formation, which depends on the difference in the activation energies (ΔG‡) of the two transition states.\n    *   Both Pathway 1 (CW/CW) and Pathway 2 (CCW/CCW) involve one sterically favorable outward rotation of a methyl group and one sterically unfavorable inward rotation of a methyl group.\n    *   The steric clash for the unfavorable rotation involves a methyl group rotating past the hydrogens of the polyene backbone. While the backbone is not perfectly symmetric (due to the 8E bond), the steric environment for an inward methyl rotation at C2 (clashing with C3-C4) and at C9 (clashing with C8-C7) are very similar.\n    *   Because the primary steric hindrance in both transition states is very similar (one inward-rotating methyl group), the activation energies for both pathways are expected to be approximately equal.\n    *   Since the rates of formation are similar (k_A ≈ k_B), the two products should be formed in roughly equal amounts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two possible conrotatory pathways have transition states of very similar energy because each involves one favorable outward rotation and one unfavorable inward rotation of a large methyl group. Therefore, neither product is strongly favored over the other, and they should be produced in an approximately equal ratio.\n\nFinal ratio of A:B ≈ 1:1.\n\n<<<1:1>>>"
