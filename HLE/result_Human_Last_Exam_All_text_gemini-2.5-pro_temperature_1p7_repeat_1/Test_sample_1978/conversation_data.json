    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine its index.\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of the Index of a Boundary-Value Problem**\n\nFor a linear boundary-value problem given by a system of differential equations and a set of linear boundary conditions:\n$$\nx'(t) = A(t)x(t) + f(t), \\quad t \\in [0, T]\n$$\n$$\nl(x) = \\alpha\n$$\nwhere $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, $A(t)$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix function, $f(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, $l$ is a linear vector functional representing the boundary conditions, and $\\alpha$ is a constant vector.\n\nThis problem is a Fredholm problem. The **index** of the problem is a number defined as:\n$$\n\\text{Index} = \\dim(\\ker(L)) - \\text{codim}(\\text{Im}(L))\n$$\nwhere $L$ is the operator associated with the problem. For this class of problems, a fundamental theorem states that the index can be calculated with a simpler formula:\n$$\n\\text{Index} = n - m\n$$\nwhere:\n*   $n$ is the dimension of the system of differential equations (i.e., the number of scalar equations or the size of the vector $x(t)$).\n*   $m$ is the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n**2. Determine the Dimension of the System ($n$)**\n\nThe problem involves the vector function $x(t)$. The statement explicitly defines this function as:\n$$\nx(t) = (x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), x_{3}(t), ..., x_{2024}(t))\n$$\nThis vector has 2024 components. Therefore, the system consists of 2024 coupled first-order linear ordinary differential equations.\n\n**Careful Point:** The dimensions of the matrix $A$ (as $202000 \\times 202000$) and the vector $I(t)$ (with $202000$ components) are inconsistent with the dimension of $x(t)$. In such a case, the dimension of the unknown function $x(t)$ dictates the dimension of the system. The inconsistent numbers are treated as typos or irrelevant information intended to test the understanding of the core concepts.\n\nThus, the dimension of the system is $n = 2024$.\n\n**3. Determine the Number of Linearly Independent Boundary Conditions ($m$)**\n\nWe are given a list of 6 boundary conditions. We need to analyze them to find how many are unique and not just multiples of others (i.e., linearly independent).\n\nThe given conditions are:\n1.  $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$\n2.  $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n3.  $5x_{2}(T) - 5x_{2}(0) = 0$\n4.  $100x_{2}(T) - 100x_{2}(0) = 0$\n5.  $1000 x_{2}(0) - 1000 x_{2}(T) = 0$\n6.  $100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0$\n\nLet's simplify and compare them:\n*   **Condition 1:** $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$. This is a unique condition on the component $x_1$.\n*   **Condition 2:** $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$.\n*   **Condition 3:** $5(x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0$. Dividing by 5 gives $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$. This is identical to Condition 2.\n*   **Condition 4:** $100(x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0)) = 0$. Dividing by 100 gives $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$. This is also identical to Condition 2.\n*   **Condition 5:** $1000(x_{2}(0) - x_{2}(T)) = 0$. Dividing by -1000 gives $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$. This is again identical to Condition 2.\n*   **Condition 6:** $100(x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0)) = 0$. Dividing by 100 gives $x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0$. This is a unique condition on the component $x_{2024}$.\n\n**Careful Point:** Conditions 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all linearly dependent. They represent the same single constraint on the component $x_2$. Therefore, they only contribute one condition to our count of independent conditions.\n\nThe set of linearly independent boundary conditions is:\n1.  $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$\n2.  $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n3.  $x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0$\n\nThese three conditions are linearly independent because they constrain different components of the solution vector $x(t)$. Thus, the number of linearly independent boundary conditions is $m = 3$.\n\n**4. Calculate the Index of the Problem**\n\nNow we apply the formula for the index:\n$$\n\\text{Index} = n - m\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$\n\\text{Index} = 2024 - 3 = 2021\n$$\n\nThe index of the considered boundary-value problem is 2021.\n\n<<<2021>>>"
