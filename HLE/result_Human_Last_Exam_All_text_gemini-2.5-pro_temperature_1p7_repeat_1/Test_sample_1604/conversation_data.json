    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the User's Question:**\nThe goal is to identify which historical battle, out of all the battles painted by the artist Lady Butler, occurred the most recently in time. This is a two-part problem: first, listing the battles she painted, and second, finding the dates of those battles to determine the latest one.\n\n**2. Identify the Artist:**\nThe artist is Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933). She was a famous British painter specializing in military and historical scenes.\n\n**3. Compile a List of Her Major Battle Paintings and the Events Depicted:**\nWe need to list her significant works that depict specific historical military events and identify the date of each event. The date of the painting's creation is irrelevant; the date of the battle itself is what matters.\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which took place on **June 16, 1815**.\n*   ***Scotland Forever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on **June 18, 1815**.\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army*** (painted 1879): Depicts Assistant Surgeon William Brydon arriving at Jalalabad, the lone survivor of a 16,000-strong army column, concluding the retreat from Kabul in **January 1842** during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Depicts a roll call of the Grenadier Guards after the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War. The battle took place on **November 5, 1854**.\n*   ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Battle of Balaclava, which occurred on **October 25, 1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Depicts the Battle of Rorke's Drift, which was fought on **January 22-23, 1879**, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1882): Depicts the death of a junior officer at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War on **January 28, 1881**.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (painted 1885): Depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Tel el-Kebir during the Anglo-Egyptian War on **September 13, 1882**.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted 1893): Depicts the Gordon Relief Expedition (also known as the Nile Expedition), which took place in **1884–1885** during the Mahdist War.\n*   ***In the Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards*** (painted 1915): Depicts an action during the Great Retreat from Mons in **August 1914**, at the beginning of World War I.\n*   ***A Canadian Gun-Battery in Action at Cambrai*** (painted c. 1919-20): This painting shows the 16th Battery of the Canadian Field Artillery during the Battle of the Canal du Nord, part of the wider offensive towards Cambrai. This battle took place on **September 27, 1918**, during World War I.\n\n**4. Compare the Historical Dates of the Battles:**\nLet's list the years of the events in chronological order to find the latest one:\n*   1815: Battle of Quatre Bras / Battle of Waterloo\n*   1842: Retreat from Kabul\n*   1854: Battle of Inkerman / Battle of Balaclava\n*   1879: Battle of Rorke's Drift\n*   1881: Battle of Laing's Nek\n*   1882: Battle of Tel el-Kebir\n*   1884-85: Gordon Relief Expedition\n*   1914: Retreat from Mons\n*   1918: Battle of the Canal du Nord (Cambrai)\n\n**5. Determine the Latest Battle:**\nBy comparing the dates, the latest event Lady Butler depicted in a major painting is the Battle of the Canal du Nord in **1918**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Painting Date vs. Event Date:** The question asks for the latest battle *historically*, not the last painting she completed.\n*   **Completeness of List:** It is important to consider her entire body of work, including lesser-known paintings and those from her later career, as these are likely to depict more recent events. Her World War I paintings are crucial to finding the correct answer.\n*   **Specificity of Battle:** The title *A Canadian Gun-Battery in Action at Cambrai* points to the Hundred Days Offensive in late 1918. The more specific name for this action is the Battle of the Canal du Nord.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the analysis of the historical dates of the events depicted in Lady Butler's paintings, the latest battle is the one fought in 1918 during World War I.\n\n<<<Battle of the Canal du Nord (near Cambrai)"
