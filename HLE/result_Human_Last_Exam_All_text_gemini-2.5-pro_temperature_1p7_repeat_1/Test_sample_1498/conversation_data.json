    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the specific range of couplets (*abyāt*, sing. *bayt*) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi where the names of the 25 prophets are mentioned. To answer this accurately, we need to analyze the structure of the poem and identify the exact starting and ending points of this specific list.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Contextual Placement:** The poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam is structured logically. It begins with praise for Allah and His Messenger, then discusses the attributes of Allah, followed by the attributes of the Messengers. The list of the prophets' names naturally follows the section on their attributes.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Preamble:** Before listing the names, the author includes a couplet that serves as an introduction to the list. This is *bayt* number 28:\n    تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ  *** كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *Translation: The details of twenty-five are binding, upon every responsible person, so verify and take this opportunity.*\n    *Careful Point:* While this *bayt* mentions the *number* of prophets, it does not contain their names. Therefore, it is the preamble to the list, not the beginning of the list itself. The question asks for where the *names* are mentioned.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Starting Bayt:** The very next couplet, *bayt* number 29, begins the enumeration of the prophets' names.\n    هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ  ***  صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *Translation: They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with, Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.*\n    *Careful Point:* This is unequivocally the first *bayt* that lists the actual names of the prophets.\n\n4.  **Tracing the List:** The list continues through the subsequent couplets:\n    *   **Bayt 30:** Mentions Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 31:** Mentions Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', and Dhu'l-Kifl.\n    *   **Bayt 32:** Mentions Dawud, Sulayman, Ilyas, Yunus, and Zakariyya.\n    *   **Bayt 33:** Mentions Yahya, 'Isa (Jesus), and Taha (a referential name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ).\n\n5.  **Identifying the Ending Bayt:** The list concludes with the final prophet, Muhammad ﷺ. While *bayt* 33 refers to him as \"Taha\", *bayt* 34 explicitly calls him the \"Seal\" of the prophets (*Khātim*), thus concluding the list and reinforcing his identity as the final messenger.\n    عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ  *** وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n    *Translation: Upon them be peace and blessings, and upon their families, as long as the days endure.*\n    *Correction & Careful Point:* Re-examining the standard texts, the list of names proper actually concludes in Bayt 33. Bayt 34 is a concluding prayer (salawat) upon all the prophets just mentioned.\n    Let's re-verify the text structure precisely.\n    *   **Bayt 33:** ...يَحْيَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَطَهَ... (...Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha...)\n    *   **Bayt 34:** ...خَاتِمٌ دَعْ عَنِ الْغَيِّ... (...the seal, leave aside misguidance...) This line completes the mention of the final prophet by his title, \"The Seal\". *However, another common version reads differently:*\n    A more standard version of the text places the concluding prayer immediately after the list.\n    *   **Bayt 33:** ...يَحْيَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا... (...Yahya, 'Isa and Taha, the Seal, leave misguidance...) In this widely accepted version, the last name (Taha) and the title (Khatim/Seal) are both in **bayt 33**.\n    *   **Bayt 34:** عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ ... (Upon them be peace and blessings...). This bayt is a supplication *for* them, it does not *name* any of them.\n\n    Therefore, the names themselves are contained entirely within the range starting from *bayt* 29 and ending at *bayt* 33.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis**\n\n*   The introduction to the list is in *bayt* 28.\n*   The actual listing of the prophets' names begins in *bayt* 29.\n*   The list of names is completed in *bayt* 33, which mentions the last prophets including the final Prophet Muhammad ﷺ (referred to as Taha and Khātim/the Seal).\n*   *Bayt* 34 begins the next topic, which is a prayer for them.\n\nThus, the range of couplets containing the names is from 29 to 33.\n\n<<<From bayt 29 to bayt 33>>>"
