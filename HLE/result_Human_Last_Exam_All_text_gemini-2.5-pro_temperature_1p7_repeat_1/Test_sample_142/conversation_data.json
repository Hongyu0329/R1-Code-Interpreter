    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons ($n$)**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the atoms in the molecule and sum their electrons. The molecular formula $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ indicates:\n*   One Carbon (C) atom\n*   One Silicon (Si) atom\n*   One Fluorine (F) atom\n*   Three Hydrogen (H) atoms (from $\\mathrm{CH}_2$ and H)\n\nNext, we find the number of electrons for each atom from the periodic table:\n*   Carbon (C): 6 electrons\n*   Silicon (Si): 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 9 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 1 electron\n\nThe total number of electrons ($n$) in the neutral molecule is the sum:\n$n = (\\text{electrons from C}) + (\\text{electrons from Si}) + (\\text{electrons from F}) + 3 \\times (\\text{electrons from H})$\n$n = 6 + 14 + 9 + 3 \\times 1 = 32$ electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (spatial orbitals, $N$)**\n\nThe number of basis functions depends on the chosen basis set, which is 6-31G**. The notation `**` implies that polarization functions are added to both heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms (`*`) and hydrogen atoms (the second `*`). We assume the standard use of 5 spherical d-functions and 3 p-functions for polarization.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The `6-31G` part gives a split-valence description of the 1s orbital, resulting in 2 s-type basis functions.\n    *   The second `*` adds a set of p-polarization functions (px, py, pz), which is 3 functions.\n    *   Total for H = 2 (s) + 3 (p) = 5 basis functions.\n\n*   **For Carbon (C), a 2nd-row atom:**\n    *   The `6-31G` part describes the core (1s) and split-valence (2s, 2p) orbitals. This results in 3 s-type functions (one for 1s, two for 2s) and 2 sets of p-type functions (6 functions). Total = 9 functions.\n    *   The first `*` adds a set of d-polarization functions (5 spherical d-functions).\n    *   Total for C = 9 (s, p) + 5 (d) = 14 basis functions.\n\n*   **For Fluorine (F), a 2nd-row atom:**\n    *   The calculation is identical to Carbon.\n    *   Total for F = 14 basis functions.\n\n*   **For Silicon (Si), a 3rd-row atom:**\n    *   The `6-31G` basis set describes core orbitals (1s, 2s, 2p) and split-valence orbitals (3s, 3p). This results in 4 s-type functions and 3 sets of p-type functions (9 functions). Total = 13 functions (4s, 3p).\n    *   The first `*` adds a set of d-polarization functions (5 spherical d-functions).\n    *   Total for Si = 13 (s, p) + 5 (d) = 18 basis functions.\n\nNow, we sum the basis functions for all atoms to get the total number of molecular orbitals ($N$):\n$N = N(\\text{C}) + N(\\text{Si}) + N(\\text{F}) + 3 \\times N(\\text{H})$\n$N = 14 + 18 + 14 + 3 \\times 5 = 14 + 18 + 14 + 15 = 61$ spatial orbitals.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the formula for the number of CSFs**\n\nA Full CI calculation considers all possible ways of distributing the $n$ electrons among the $N$ orbitals. We are looking for the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs), which are spin-adapted linear combinations of Slater determinants.\n\nFor a molecule with an even number of electrons (32), the ground state is a singlet state, meaning the total spin quantum number $S = 0$.\n\nThe number of CSFs for a system with $n$ electrons, $N$ spatial orbitals, and total spin $S$ is given by the Weyl-Pethick-Knowles formula:\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\frac{2S+1}{N+1} \\binom{N+1}{n/2 - S} \\binom{N+1}{n/2 + S + 1} $$\n\nFor our specific case:\n*   $n = 32$ (so $n/2 = 16$)\n*   $N = 61$\n*   $S = 0$\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$$ \\text{CSFs} = \\frac{2(0)+1}{61+1} \\binom{61+1}{16 - 0} \\binom{61+1}{16 + 0 + 1} $$\n$$ \\text{CSFs} = \\frac{1}{62} \\binom{62}{16} \\binom{62}{17} $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final number**\n\nWe now need to compute the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{62}{16} = \\frac{62!}{16! \\cdot 46!} = 703,912,456,120,680$\n*   $\\binom{62}{17} = \\frac{62!}{17! \\cdot 45!} = 1,918,855,304,749,200$\n\nNow, perform the final calculation:\n$$ \\text{CSFs} = \\frac{(703,912,456,120,680) \\times (1,918,855,304,749,200)}{62} $$\n$$ \\text{CSFs} = 2,088,520,020,408,447,383,669,120,000 $$\n\nThis number can be expressed in scientific notation as approximately $2.0885 \\times 10^{27}$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Atom Count:** Ensure all atoms from the molecular formula are counted correctly. $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ has 1 C, 1 Si, 1 F, and 3 H atoms.\n2.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** Correctly interpret the basis set notation (6-31G**). The `**` means polarization functions on all atoms. The number of functions per atom, especially for 3rd-row vs. 2nd-row elements, must be accurate.\n3.  **Spherical vs. Cartesian Functions:** By default, modern quantum chemistry programs use 5 spherical d-functions instead of 6 Cartesian d-functions. This analysis uses the standard 5 d-functions. Using 6 Cartesian functions would change the result.\n4.  **Spin State:** The question implies a calculation for the ground state of a stable molecule. With 32 (an even number) electrons, this corresponds to a singlet state ($S=0$).\n5.  **Formula Choice:** The formula for the number of CSFs must be used, not the simpler one for the number of Slater determinants. There are several equivalent formulas for CSFs; they all yield the same result.\n6.  **Calculation Precision:** The numbers involved are immense. Calculation requires high-precision arithmetic to obtain the exact integer result.\n\nThe analysis is complete and the steps lead to the final numerical answer.\n\n<<<2088520020408447383669120000>>>"
