    "This is a classic question in point-set topology, specifically in continuum theory. To answer it, we need to break down the terms and then rely on a significant classification theorem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a non-empty, compact, connected metric space. Think of familiar examples like a line segment, a disk, or a circle.\n*   **Planar:** A space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane, R². This means there exists a homeomorphism from the space onto a subset of the plane.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space `X` is homogeneous if, for any two points `x` and `y` in `X`, there exists a homeomorphism `h: X → X` (a continuous map with a continuous inverse) such that `h(x) = y`. Intuitively, this means the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n\nThe question asks for the number of topologically distinct types (homeomorphism classes) of spaces that satisfy all three of these properties.\n\n**Step 2: Identify simple candidates and non-examples**\n\n*   **The point:** A single point is a continuum (it's compact and connected), planar, and trivially homogeneous. So, this is one class.\n*   **The circle (S¹):** A circle is a continuum and is planar. It is also homogeneous because you can rotate any point to any other point, and rotation is a homeomorphism. So, this is a second class.\n*   **A closed line segment [0,1]:** This is a planar continuum, but it is **not** homogeneous. The endpoints are topologically different from the interior points. There is no self-homeomorphism that can map an endpoint (like 0) to an interior point (like 1/2).\n*   **A closed disk:** This is a planar continuum, but it is **not** homogeneous. Boundary points are topologically different from interior points.\n*   **The sphere (S²):** This is a homogeneous continuum but is **not** planar.\n\nFrom these simple examples, we have found two classes: the point and the circle. The question is whether there are any others.\n\n**Step 3: Invoke the relevant classification theorem**\n\nThis problem was famously solved by the topologist R. H. Bing in 1960. He proved a complete classification theorem for all homogeneous planar continua. This is a deep result in the field.\n\n**Bing's Theorem:** A space is a homogeneous planar continuum if and only if it is homeomorphic to one of the following four spaces:\n1.  **The point**\n2.  **The circle**\n3.  **The pseudo-arc**\n4.  **The circle of pseudo-arcs**\n\n**Step 4: Understand the less familiar examples**\n\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** This is a very complex object. It is a one-dimensional, snake-like continuum that is **indecomposable** (meaning it cannot be split into two proper subcontinua). It is planar, and Bing proved that it is homogeneous. It is not locally connected, which distinguishes it from the circle.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This is another indecomposable, non-locally connected continuum. It can be thought of as a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs arranged in a circle. It is also homogeneous and planar.\n\n**Step 5: Verify that these four classes are distinct**\n\nTo confirm there are exactly four classes, we must ensure these four objects are not homeomorphic to each other. We can distinguish them using topological invariants:\n\n*   **The Point:** It is 0-dimensional. All others are 1-dimensional. So it is distinct.\n*   **The Circle:** It is **locally connected**. The pseudo-arc and the circle of pseudo-arcs are **not** locally connected. Since local connectedness is preserved by homeomorphism, the circle is distinct from the other two.\n*   **The Pseudo-arc vs. The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** A key difference is that the circle of pseudo-arcs separates the plane when embedded (like a simple closed curve does, by the Jordan Curve Theorem), whereas the pseudo-arc does not. Another more intrinsic topological difference is that the first Čech cohomology group of the circle of pseudo-arcs is non-trivial (like the circle's), while it is trivial for the pseudo-arc (like the point's). Therefore, they are topologically distinct.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on Bing's complete classification, there are exactly four spaces that are homogeneous planar continua. Each one belongs to a unique homeomorphism class.\n\nThe four classes are:\n1.  The point\n2.  The circle\n3.  The pseudo-arc\n4.  The circle of pseudo-arcs\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 4 homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<4>>>"
