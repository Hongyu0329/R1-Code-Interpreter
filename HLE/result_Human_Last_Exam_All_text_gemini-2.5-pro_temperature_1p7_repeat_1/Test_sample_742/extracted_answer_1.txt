No, it is not possible. The two formalisms are incommensurable. GÃ¶del's proof is an exercise in modal logic, dealing with abstract concepts like "positive properties" and "metaphysical necessity," which have no equivalent or representation within the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics (which uses Hilbert spaces, operators, and probabilities to describe physical systems). Attempting to use one to prove propositions in the other is a category error.
