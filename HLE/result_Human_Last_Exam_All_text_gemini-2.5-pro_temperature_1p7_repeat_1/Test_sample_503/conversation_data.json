    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the mathematical structures\n\n1.  **The Simplex Category, $\\Delta$**:\n    *   **Objects**: Finite ordered sets $[n] = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ for integers $n \\ge 0$.\n    *   **Morphisms**: Order-preserving (non-decreasing) maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$, i.e., if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n\n2.  **$\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$**:\n    *   This means $\\Delta$ is treated as a 2-category. The objects are the same ([n]). The morphisms (or 1-morphisms) are the non-decreasing maps.\n    *   For any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$, denoted $f \\Rightarrow g$ or $f \\le g$, if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. This defines a partial order on each hom-set $\\Delta([m], [n])$, making it a poset (hence \"locally posetal\").\n\n3.  **Internal Adjunction**:\n    *   An adjunction from an object $A$ to an object $B$ in a 2-category consists of a pair of 1-morphisms (maps) $L: A \\to B$ and $R: B \\to A$, and two 2-morphisms (inequalities) called the unit ($\\eta$) and counit ($\\epsilon$).\n    *   In our case, the objects are $A=[23]$ and $B=[37]$.\n    *   The left adjoint is $L: [23] \\to [37]$.\n    *   The right adjoint is $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\n    *   The unit is a 2-morphism $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\to R \\circ L$. This translates to the inequality $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\le R \\circ L$, which means for all $i \\in [23]$, $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$, or simply $i \\le R(L(i))$.\n    *   The counit is a 2-morphism $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$. This translates to the inequality $L \\circ R \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$, which means for all $j \\in [37]$, $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(j)$, or simply $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n    *   These two conditions, $i \\le R(L(i))$ and $L(R(j)) \\le j$, define the adjunction. This is also known as a **Galois connection** between the posets $[23]$ and $[37]$.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the Adjoint Maps\n\nAn adjunction is determined by either the left adjoint map $L$ or the right adjoint map $R$. We can count the number of possible $L$ maps, or the number of possible $R$ maps.\n\n**Method 1: Counting the right adjoints $R$**\n\nA non-decreasing map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint in an adjunction if and only if it has a left adjoint $L$. From the theory of adjoints between posets, a map has a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all limits (infima). For the specific poset $[n]$, which is a finite total order, this property simplifies. The poset $[n]$ has a top element, $n$. A map $R:[n]\\to[m]$ preserves the top element if $R(n)$ is the top element of $[m]$, which is $m$. So, the condition is $R(n)=m$.\n\n*   We need to count the number of non-decreasing maps $R: [37] \\to [23]$ such that $R(37) = 23$.\n*   Such a map is a sequence $y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_{37}$ where $y_i = R(i)$.\n*   The conditions are $0 \\le y_0 \\le y_1 \\le \\dots \\le y_{36} \\le y_{37} = 23$.\n*   The choice of the map is determined by the values $y_0, y_1, \\dots, y_{36}$.\n*   We need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 37 (from index 0 to 36) with values in the set $[23] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n*   This is a classic stars and bars problem. It is equivalent to choosing 37 items (the values of the sequence) from a set of 24 options (the elements of $[23]$) with replacement, where the order of selection doesn't matter (as it's fixed by the non-decreasing condition).\n*   Let $k$ be the number of items to choose, and $p$ be the number of options. Here $k=37$ and $p=24$.\n*   The number of ways is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n    $\\binom{p+k-1}{k} = \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\n**Method 2: Counting the left adjoints $L$**\n\nDually, a non-decreasing map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all colimits (suprema). For the poset $[m]$, this means it must preserve the bottom element, 0. That is, $L(0)$ must be the bottom element of $[n]$, which is 0. So, the condition is $L(0)=0$.\n\n*   We need to count the number of non-decreasing maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0) = 0$.\n*   Such a map is a sequence $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{23}$ where $x_i = L(i)$.\n*   The conditions are $0 = x_0 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le \\dots \\le x_{23} \\le 37$.\n*   The choice of the map is determined by the values $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_{23}$.\n*   We need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23 with values in the set $[37] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n*   This is equivalent to choosing 23 items from a set of 38 options with replacement.\n*   Let $k=23$ (number of items) and $p=38$ (number of options).\n*   The number of ways is:\n    $\\binom{p+k-1}{k} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n### Step 3: Final Calculation\n\nBoth methods must yield the same result. Let's check:\n$\\binom{60}{37} = \\frac{60!}{37! (60-37)!} = \\frac{60!}{37! 23!}$\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! (60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23! 37!}$\nThe two results are indeed equal, confirming our analysis.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is $\\binom{60}{23}$."
