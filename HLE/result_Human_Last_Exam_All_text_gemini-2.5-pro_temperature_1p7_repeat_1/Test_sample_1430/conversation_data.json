    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the objects and the question**\nLet $C$ be a genus $g=3$ Riemann surface (a smooth projective algebraic curve over $\\mathbb{C}$).\nLet $X = C^{(15)}$ be the 15th symmetric power of $C$. This is the variety parameterizing effective divisors of degree 15 on $C$. It is a smooth projective variety of dimension 15.\nThe question asks for the smallest and largest possible values of the rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X$, denoted by $\\rho(X)$. This rank is also known as the Picard number of $X$. We need to find this range as $C$ varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**Step 2: Relating the geometry of $X$ to the Jacobian of $C$**\nThe geometry of the symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ is well understood, especially when the degree $d$ is large compared to the genus $g$.\nThere is a canonical morphism, the Abel-Jacobi map, $u_d: C^{(d)} \\to \\text{Pic}^d(C)$, which sends a divisor $D$ to its isomorphism class of line bundles $\\mathcal{O}_C(D)$.\nThe variety $\\text{Pic}^d(C)$ is a torsor for the Jacobian of $C$, $J(C) = \\text{Pic}^0(C)$, and is in fact isomorphic to $J(C)$ as an algebraic variety.\nThe fibers of the map $u_d$ are the complete linear systems $|D| = \\mathbb{P}(H^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)))$. The dimension of these fibers is $h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) - 1$.\n\nFor our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$. The degree of the divisors is $d = 15$. By the Riemann-Roch theorem, for a divisor $D$ of degree $d$:\n$h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) - h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) = d - g + 1$.\nBy Serre duality, $h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) = h^0(C, K_C - D)$, where $K_C$ is the canonical divisor.\nThe degree of $K_C$ is $2g-2 = 2(3)-2 = 4$.\nThe degree of $K_C - D$ is $4 - 15 = -11$. Since this degree is negative, $h^0(C, K_C - D) = 0$.\nTherefore, $h^1(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) = 0$.\nPlugging this back into the Riemann-Roch formula, we get $h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) = d - g + 1 = 15 - 3 + 1 = 13$.\nThe dimension of the fiber $|D|$ is $h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}_C(D)) - 1 = 12$.\n\nSince the dimension of the fibers is constant for all divisors of degree 15, the map $u_{15}: C^{(15)} \\to \\text{Pic}^{15}(C)$ exhibits $X=C^{(15)}$ as a projective bundle over $\\text{Pic}^{15}(C) \\cong J(C)$. Specifically, $X$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle over $J(C)$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Néron-Severi rank of a projective bundle**\nFor a projective bundle $p: E \\to B$, where the fibers are $\\mathbb{P}^n$, the Néron-Severi group (or more precisely, its rank) is related by a simple formula. The Picard group satisfies $\\text{Pic}(E) \\cong p^*\\text{Pic}(B) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}\\cdot[\\mathcal{O}_E(1)]$, where $\\mathcal{O}_E(1)$ is the relative hyperplane bundle. This leads to a relationship for the ranks of the Néron-Severi groups:\n$\\rho(E) = \\rho(B) + 1$.\nApplying this to our situation ($E=X=C^{(15)}$, $B=J(C)$), we get:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the range of the rank of the Néron-Severi group of $J(C)$**\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a curve $C$ of genus 3. $J(C)$ is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. The rank of its Néron-Severi group, $\\rho(J(C))$, depends on the arithmetic properties of its endomorphism ring.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank for $\\rho(J(C))$**:\n    The minimal rank is achieved for a \"very general\" curve $C$. For such a curve, the Jacobian $J(C)$ is a simple abelian variety with endomorphism ring being just the integers, $\\text{End}(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$. The Néron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ consists of endomorphisms symmetric with respect to the Rosati involution. Since all elements of $\\mathbb{Z}$ are symmetric, $NS(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$. The rank is therefore 1.\n    So, $\\rho_{\\min}(J(C)) = 1$.\n\n*   **Largest possible rank for $\\rho(J(C))$**:\n    The maximal rank is achieved for a very special curve $C$, one whose Jacobian has a large endomorphism ring (i.e., has complex multiplication, CM).\n    For an abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$, the Picard number is bounded by $\\rho(A) \\le g^2$. In our case, $g=3$, so $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 9$.\n    This maximum is achieved if $A$ is isogenous to a product $E^g$, where $E$ is an elliptic curve with complex multiplication. For $A=E^3$, where $E$ has CM, the endomorphism algebra is $M_3(K)$ where $K$ is an imaginary quadratic field. The subspace of symmetric endomorphisms (with respect to the Rosati involution from the product polarization) corresponds to the space of $3 \\times 3$ Hermitian matrices with entries in $K$. The dimension of this space over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $g^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\n    We must ensure that such an abelian variety can be the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve. A famous result states that the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic curve, $C: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$ (a smooth curve of genus 3), is isomorphic to $E^3$, where $E$ is the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - x$ which has CM by the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n    Therefore, the maximum possible rank is achieved for a Jacobian.\n    So, $\\rho_{\\max}(J(C)) = 9$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\nNow we can determine the smallest and largest possible ranks for $\\rho(X)$.\nUsing the formula $\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$:\n\n*   **Smallest rank**: $\\rho_{\\min}(X) = \\rho_{\\min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n*   **Largest rank**: $\\rho_{\\max}(X) = \\rho_{\\max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.\n\nThe smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group of X are 2 and 10, respectively.\n<<<2, 10>>>"
