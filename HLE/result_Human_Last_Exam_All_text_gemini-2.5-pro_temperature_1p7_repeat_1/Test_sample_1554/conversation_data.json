    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific philosopher who belongs to a particular philosophical school and is known for a specific conceptual analysis.\n*   **Philosophical School:** The Lviv-Warsaw School. This was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland during the interwar period. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n*   **Core Concept:** The notion of a \"hallmark.\" In this context, \"hallmark\" is used as a synonym for a \"sign\"—something that stands for or indicates something else.\n*   **Conceptual Analysis:** The decomposition of this concept into \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\" This implies a distinction between different types of signs.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the specific terms \"symptoms\" and \"signals\"**\nTo find the correct philosopher, we must understand the distinction being made.\n*   **Symptom:** This typically refers to a natural sign. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is causal or natural, not arbitrary. For example, a fever is a symptom of an illness; smoke is a symptom of fire. The sign is not produced with the intention of communicating.\n*   **Signal:** This refers to a conventional or artificial sign. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is based on a rule, agreement, or established habit. Signals are typically created with the intention of communicating or causing a specific action. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; spoken or written words are signals that convey meaning.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the concepts to a philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School**\nNow, we must search for the philosopher within the Lviv-Warsaw School who is most associated with this particular semiotic (theory of signs) distinction.\n\n*   The philosopher most famous for this specific analysis is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n*   In his work on semiotics and the philosophy of language, particularly within his framework of \"logical pragmatics,\" Ajdukiewicz analyzed the concept of a sign (in Polish, *znak*).\n*   He explicitly distinguished between natural signs, which he called **symptoms** (*oznaki*), and signs used for communication, which he called **signals** (*sygnały*).\n*   This distinction was fundamental to his analysis of language, as he classified linguistic expressions as a specific type of signal. Other philosophers of the school, like Tarski or Łukasiewicz, focused more on formal logic and semantics, while Ajdukiewicz's work uniquely emphasized this pragmatic and semiotic classification of signs.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of the Lviv-Warsaw School's key thinkers and their contributions, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the philosopher who decomposed the general notion of a sign (or hallmark) into the categories of symptoms (natural signs) and signals (communicative, conventional signs).\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correctly identify the school:** The question specifies the Lviv-Warsaw School, so the answer must be a member of this group.\n2.  **Understand the terminology:** \"Hallmark\" is a general term for \"sign.\" The key lies in the specific sub-categories of \"symptoms\" and \"signals,\" which point to a semiotic analysis.\n3.  **Distinguish between members of the school:** While many philosophers in the school worked on logic and language, Ajdukiewicz is the one particularly known for this pragmatic distinction in his theory of signs. Tarski's work on truth, for instance, is semantic, not pragmatic in this way.\n4.  **Confirm the distinction:** The distinction between natural signs (symptoms/indices) and conventional signs (signals/symbols) is a classic one in semiotics, but its specific formulation and central role within the Lviv-Warsaw School is a hallmark of Ajdukiewicz's work.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
