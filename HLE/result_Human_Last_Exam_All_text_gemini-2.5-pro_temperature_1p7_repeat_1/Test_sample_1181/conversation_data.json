    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris* who has a specific feeling: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This is not just about missing Earth, but specifically about the *shame* associated with that homesickness.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and their Motivations**\nLet's consider each character provided in the answer choices in the context of the film and this specific sentiment.\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. The film begins and ends with him at his father's dacha on Earth, surrounded by nature, including rustling leaves. He has a deep connection to Earth, but his journey is one of grappling with grief, memory, and the reality of the \"guest\" who is his late wife, Hari. While he is profoundly affected by his homesickness, the specific sentiment of being *ashamed* of it is not his primary characteristic. He is more consumed by the immediate emotional turmoil.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** She is not a human from Earth, but a \"guest\" or \"neutrino-based replica\" created by the Solaris ocean from Kris's memories. She has no firsthand memories of Earth herself, so she cannot miss it. Her journey is about understanding her own existence and humanity.\n\n*   **C. Dr. Snaut:** One of the two surviving scientists Kris meets on the station. Snaut is world-weary, cynical, and philosophical. He has been on the station for a long time and has had much time to contemplate their situation. He acts as a guide to Kris, explaining that humanity isn't really seeking other worlds, but a mirror for itself. It is he who articulates the profound, existential homesickness of the crew, and the inherent shame they feel as space explorers for having such \"simple\" or \"unscientific\" longings.\n\n*   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** The other surviving scientist. He is cold, clinical, and obsessed with a purely scientific understanding of Solaris. He sees emotions and nostalgia as weaknesses and distractions from his work. He would likely be contemptuous of missing rustling leaves, not ashamed of it.\n\n*   **E. Dr. Gibarian:** Kris's friend who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. We only see him in a video recording he left for Kris. His message is filled with despair and warning, but he does not express the specific philosophical point about being ashamed of homesickness. His focus is on the immediate horror of the \"visitors.\"\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Correct Character**\nThe sentiment of being \"ashamed\" of homesickness is a key part of Dr. Snaut's philosophical monologues. He talks about how humanity wants to expand Earth to the cosmos and how they are fundamentally bound to their home planet. He expresses the idea that for a scientist or an astronaut, being homesick for something as simple as the sound of leaves is seen as a weakness, a source of shame. This shame, he suggests, is a profoundly humanizing emotion. Therefore, Dr. Snaut is the character who embodies this feeling.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Analysis**\nBy examining the personality and dialogue of each character in Tarkovsky's *Solaris*, it becomes clear that Dr. Snaut is the one who articulates the complex feeling of being ashamed of missing the simple, natural experiences of Earth, like the rustling of leaves.\n\n<<<C>>>"
