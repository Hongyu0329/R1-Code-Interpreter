The set M is the space of non-positive continuous functions on the interval $[0, 1]$ which are zero at the endpoints $x=0$ and $x=1$. In mathematical notation:
$M = \{u \in C[0,1] \mid u(0)=u(1)=0 \text{ and } u(x) \le 0 \text{ for all } x \in [0,1]\}$. This set should be endowed with the metric induced by the supremum norm.
