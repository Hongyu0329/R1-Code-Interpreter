    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Integral\nThe integral to evaluate is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\nThis integral is in the form `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`, where `f(x) = F₃(x)`. This is a standard integral form.\n\n### Careful Point 1: Recognizing the Integral Form\nThe key to solving this problem efficiently is to recognize that the antiderivative of `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln|f(x)|`.\nSo, `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = ln|F₃(x)| + C`.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate the Definite Integral\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:\n`[ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1 = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\nLet this value be `V`. So, `V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate F₃(0)\nWe need to find the value of `F₃(x)` at `x = 0`. We do this by following the chain of function definitions:\n*   `F₀(x) = x` ⇒ `F₀(0) = 0`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x))` ⇒ `F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x))` ⇒ `F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))` ⇒ `F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate F₃(1)\nSimilarly, we find the value of `F₃(x)` at `x = 1`:\n*   `F₀(x) = x` ⇒ `F₀(1) = 1`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x))` ⇒ `F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)`\n\n### Careful Point 2: Radians vs. Degrees\nIn calculus, trigonometric function arguments are assumed to be in radians unless otherwise specified. So, `sin(1)` refers to the sine of 1 radian.\n\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x))` ⇒ `F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))` ⇒ `F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n### Step 5: Substitute Values into the Integral Expression\nNow we substitute the expressions for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` back into our formula for `V`:\n`V = ln|ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))| - ln|ln(2)|`\n\n### Careful Point 3: Handling the Absolute Value\nWe need to determine the sign of `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` to resolve the absolute value.\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.693`, which is positive. So `|ln(2)| = ln(2)`.\n*   For `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`:\n    *   `1` radian is approximately `57.3°`. Since `0 < 1 < π`, `sin(1)` is positive. `sin(1) ≈ 0.841`.\n    *   `e^(sin(1))` is positive.\n    *   `1 + e^(sin(1))` is greater than 1.\n    *   The natural logarithm of a number greater than 1 is positive. Thus, `F₃(1)` is positive.\n*   Since both `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` are positive, we can remove the absolute value bars.\n\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can simplify this to:\n`V = ln [ ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) ]`\n\n### Step 6: Numerical Calculation\nNow we compute the numerical value of `V`.\n1.  `sin(1) ≈ 0.841471`\n2.  `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.841471 ≈ 2.319772`\n3.  `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 1 + 2.319772 = 3.319772`\n4.  `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.319772) ≈ 1.199859`\n5.  `F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693147`\n6.  `V = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) )` -> Wait, the formula is `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`, not `ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))`. Let's correct this.\n    `V = ln(1.199859) - ln(0.693147)`\n    `V ≈ 0.182205 - (-0.366513) ≈ 0.548718`\n    Let's re-verify with the other form `V = ln[ F₃(1) / F₃(0) ]` as this appears incorrect. No, the formula is `V = ln(A) - ln(B)` where `A = F₃(1)` and `B=F₃(0)`.\n    `V = ln(ln(1+e^sin(1))) - ln(ln(2))`. This is correct.\n    My previous simplification was incorrect. `ln(a)-ln(b)` is not `ln(ln(a)/ln(b))`.\n    The expression is correct as is: `V = ln(ln(1+e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\n\nLet's re-calculate `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2))` from Step 5. This form is `ln(A/B) = lnA - lnB`, so the formula should be `ln(A) - ln(B)` where A is the numerator and B is the denominator. Ah, the variable is inside the outer ln. `V = ln(A)` where `A = F_3(1) / F_3(0)`. No, this is also wrong.\nThe correct calculation is `V = ln(F_3(1)) - ln(F_3(0))`. Let's re-verify this step.\n\nThe integral is `ln|F_3(1)| - ln|F_3(0)|`.\nLet's call `A = F_3(1)` and `B = F_3(0)`.\nThen the value is `ln(A) - ln(B)`.\n`A = ln(1 + e^sin(1)) ≈ 1.199859`\n`B = ln(2) ≈ 0.693147`\nThe value is `V = ln(1.199859) - ln(0.693147)`.\n`ln(1.199859) ≈ 0.182205`\n`ln(0.693147) ≈ -0.366513`\n`V ≈ 0.182205 - (-0.366513) = 0.548718`.\nThis seems correct. My previous simplification to `ln [ ln(...) / ln(...) ]` was a mistake. Let's trust this calculation path.\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\nThe question asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n*   `V ≈ 0.548718`\n*   `10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548718 = 5487.18`\n\nThe closest integer to `5487.18` is `5487`.\n\n<<<5487>>>"
