    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the Tongan flag\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner (the hoist). Within the white canton, there is a red \"couped\" cross. A couped cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the area it is in, meaning there is a border of the background color (white, in this case) all around the cross.\n\n### Step 2: Model the flag as a matrix\nWe are asked to create a matrix, let's call it `M`, by representing the flag's image on a pixel grid. Every red pixel is assigned a value of `a`, and every white pixel is assigned a value of `b`. The question asks for the *maximal possible* rank, which means we can choose the values of `a` and `b` to achieve this maximum.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the row vectors of the matrix\nThe rank of a matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by its row vectors (or column vectors). Let's analyze the different types of row vectors that can appear in the matrix `M`. A row vector is determined by the colors of the pixels it passes through from left to right.\n\nLet the total image have dimensions `H x W` pixels. The canton occupies the top-left portion, say rows `1` to `h` and columns `1` to `w`.\n\nWe can identify two distinct types of horizontal patterns on the flag:\n1.  **A solid red line:** This occurs for any row that is entirely within a red area.\n    *   Any row in the lower part of the flag (from row `h+1` to `H`) is entirely in the red field. These rows will be vectors of the form `(a, a, a, ..., a)`.\n    *   Any row that passes through the canton but aligns with the horizontal bar of the red cross will also be entirely red. The first `w` pixels are red because they are part of the cross, and the remaining `W-w` pixels are red because they are in the main field. These rows are also `(a, a, a, ..., a)`.\n    Let's call this first type of row vector `V_R = (a, a, ..., a)`.\n\n2.  **A line with a white-red-white-red pattern:** This occurs for any row that passes through the canton's white area, i.e., above or below the horizontal bar of the cross.\n    *   For such a row, it starts in the white part of the canton, intersects the vertical bar of the red cross, goes back into the white part of the canton, and finally enters the main red field.\n    *   The structure of such a row vector will be:\n        `(b, ..., b` for the first white section of the canton,\n        ` a, ..., a` for the vertical red bar of the cross,\n        ` b, ..., b` for the second white section of the canton,\n        ` a, ..., a` for the main red field to the right of the canton).\n    Let's call this second type of row vector `V_W = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, ..., a)`.\n\nFor any faithful image of the flag, there must be rows of both types. For instance, the flag must have a red field below the canton (producing `V_R` vectors) and it must have white areas in the canton (producing `V_W` vectors).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the dimension of the row space\nThe row space of the matrix `M` is the vector space spanned by all its row vectors. Since every row vector in `M` is either of type `V_R` or `V_W`, the row space is `span({V_R, V_W})`.\nThe dimension of this space, which is the rank of the matrix, can be at most 2. The rank will be exactly 2 if `V_R` and `V_W` are linearly independent. It will be 1 if they are linearly dependent (and at least one is non-zero), and 0 if both are the zero vector.\n\n### Step 5: Find the conditions for maximal rank\nTo maximize the rank, we need to choose `a` and `b` such that `V_R` and `V_W` are linearly independent.\nThe two vectors are linearly dependent if one is a scalar multiple of the other. Let's assume `V_W = k * V_R` for some scalar `k`.\n\n`V_W = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, ..., a)`\n`k * V_R = (k*a, ..., k*a, k*a, ..., k*a, k*a, ..., k*a, k*a, ..., k*a)`\n\nEquating the components of these vectors gives two conditions:\n1.  `b = k*a` (from the sections corresponding to white pixels in `V_W`)\n2.  `a = k*a` (from the sections corresponding to red pixels in `V_W`)\n\nLet's analyze the second equation, `a = k*a`:\n*   If we choose `a ≠ 0`, then we can divide by `a` to get `k = 1`.\n*   Substituting `k = 1` into the first equation (`b = k*a`) gives `b = a`.\nThis means that if `a ≠ 0` and we choose `b = a`, the two vectors `V_R` and `V_W` become identical, making them linearly dependent. The matrix would consist of rows of a single type `(a, a, ..., a)`, so its rank would be 1.\n\n*   If we choose `a = 0`, the second equation `0 = k*0` is always true. The vectors become:\n    `V_R = (0, 0, ..., 0)` (the zero vector)\n    `V_W = (b, ..., b, 0, ..., 0, b, ..., b, 0, ..., 0)`\n    The row space is spanned by `V_W` alone. If we choose `b ≠ 0`, `V_W` is a non-zero vector and the rank is 1. If `b = 0` as well, the whole matrix is zero and the rank is 0.\n\nTo achieve a rank of 2, we must ensure `V_R` and `V_W` are linearly independent. This happens if the condition for linear dependence (`b = a` when `a ≠ 0`) is avoided.\nTherefore, if we choose `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`, the vectors `V_R` and `V_W` will be linearly independent.\n\nFor example, let's choose `a = 1` and `b = 0`.\n`V_R = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1)`\n`V_W = (0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)`\nThese two vectors are clearly not multiples of each other and are therefore linearly independent. The space they span has a dimension of 2, so the rank of the matrix `M` is 2.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\nWe have found the following possible ranks:\n*   Rank 0, if `a = 0` and `b = 0`.\n*   Rank 1, if `a = b ≠ 0`, or if one of `a` or `b` is zero but not both.\n*   Rank 2, if `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`.\n\nSince we are looking for the *maximal possible* rank, we can choose values for `a` and `b` that satisfy the conditions for Rank 2. Therefore, the maximal possible rank is 2."
