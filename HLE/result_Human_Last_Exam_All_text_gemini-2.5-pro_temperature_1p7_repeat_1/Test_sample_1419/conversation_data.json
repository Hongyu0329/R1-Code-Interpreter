    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Theory and the Coupling Constant**\n\nThe Euclidean Lagrangian for the $\\phi^4$ theory in $d$ dimensions is given by:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m^2 \\phi^2 + \\frac{u_0}{4!} \\phi^4 $$\nwhere $u_0$ is the bare coupling constant.\n\n**2. Dimensional Analysis**\n\nTo understand the behavior of the coupling under a change of scale, we first determine its mass dimension. The action $S = \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}$ must be dimensionless.\n*   The mass dimension of the spacetime volume element is $[\\int d^d x] = -d$.\n*   Therefore, the Lagrangian must have mass dimension $[\\mathcal{L}] = d$.\n*   From the kinetic term, $(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2$, we deduce the dimension of the field $\\phi$. Since $[\\partial_\\mu]=1$, we have $2[\\phi] + 2 = d$, which gives $[\\phi] = \\frac{d-2}{2}$.\n*   From the interaction term, $\\frac{u_0}{4!} \\phi^4$, we find the dimension of the bare coupling $u_0$. We must have $[u_0] + 4[\\phi] = d$.\n    $$ [u_0] + 4 \\left( \\frac{d-2}{2} \\right) = d \\implies [u_0] + 2d - 4 = d \\implies [u_0] = 4-d $$\nWe are interested in the theory near four dimensions, so we define a small parameter $\\epsilon = 4 - d$. The mass dimension of the coupling constant is $[u_0] = \\epsilon$.\nTo work with a dimensionless coupling constant, we introduce an arbitrary momentum scale $\\mu$ and define the dimensionless running coupling $u$ as:\n$$ u_0 = u \\, \\mu^{\\epsilon} $$\n\n**3. The Beta Function**\n\nThe beta function, $\\beta(u)$, describes how the dimensionless coupling $u$ changes with the energy scale $\\mu$:\n$$ \\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu} $$\nThe fixed points $u^*$ of the theory are the values of the coupling for which the theory is scale-invariant, i.e., where the beta function is zero: $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n\nThe beta function can be split into two parts: a \"classical\" or \"engineering\" part, and a \"quantum\" part arising from loop corrections.\n\n*   **Classical Part:** This part comes from the explicit dependence on $\\mu$ in the definition of the dimensionless coupling $u$. Assuming the bare coupling $u_0$ is fixed and independent of $\\mu$, we have:\n    $$ 0 = \\mu \\frac{d u_0}{d\\mu} = \\mu \\frac{d}{d\\mu} (u \\mu^{\\epsilon}) = \\left(\\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu}\\right) \\mu^{\\epsilon} + u (\\epsilon \\mu^{\\epsilon}) $$\n    $$ 0 = \\beta(u) + \\epsilon u \\implies \\beta_{\\text{classical}}(u) = -\\epsilon u $$\n\n*   **Quantum Part:** This part arises from quantum loop corrections to the interaction vertex. We need to compute the one-loop correction to the four-point function. The relevant Feynman diagrams are the s-channel, t-channel, and u-channel one-loop diagrams.\n\n    Each diagram involves a loop of two propagators. The symmetry factor for each diagram is $1/2$, and there are three such diagrams. The one-loop correction to the coupling, $\\delta u$, is proportional to $u^2$. A detailed calculation using dimensional regularization in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ (modified minimal subtraction) scheme yields the quantum contribution to the running of the dimensionful coupling:\n    $$ \\mu \\frac{du_d}{d\\mu} = \\frac{3 u_d^2}{16\\pi^2} $$\n    where $u_d$ is the dimensionful coupling. Converting this to the dimensionless coupling $u = u_d \\mu^{-\\epsilon}$, we find the quantum contribution to the beta function for $u$ is:\n    $$ \\beta_{\\text{quantum}}(u) = \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2} $$\n    (This result is evaluated at $\\epsilon=0$, which is sufficient for the leading order calculation).\n\n**4. Combine and Find the Fixed Point**\n\nThe total beta function is the sum of the classical and quantum parts:\n$$ \\beta(u) = \\beta_{\\text{classical}}(u) + \\beta_{\\text{quantum}}(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2} $$\nThis expression is valid to leading order in $\\epsilon$ and one-loop in perturbation theory.\n\nTo find the fixed points $u^*$, we set $\\beta(u^*) = 0$:\n$$ -\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\n$$ u^* \\left( -\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} \\right) = 0 $$\n\nThis equation has two solutions:\n1.  **The Gaussian Fixed Point:** $u^* = 0$. This corresponds to a free, non-interacting theory.\n2.  **The Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point:** This is the non-trivial solution:\n    $$ -\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\n    $$ \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = \\epsilon $$\n    $$ u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3} $$\n\nThis is the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling. Since $u^*$ is proportional to $\\epsilon$, the use of perturbation theory is justified for small $\\epsilon$. This fixed point governs the universal critical behavior of systems described by $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions, such as the Ising model near its critical temperature.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3}}$.\n<<<$\\frac{16\\pi^2 \\epsilon}{3}$>>>"
