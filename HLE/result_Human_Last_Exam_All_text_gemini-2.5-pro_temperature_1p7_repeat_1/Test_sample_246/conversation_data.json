    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the components of the problem**\n\n*   **The Knot:** The trefoil knot, denoted $K=3_1$. It is also the torus knot $T(2,3)$.\n*   **The Surface:** The 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, denoted $S_{K,5}$. This is a 2-sphere embedded in the 4-sphere $S^4$.\n*   **The Manifold:** The double branched cover of $S^4$ branched over the surface $S_{K,5}$. Let's call this 4-manifold $M$.\n*   **The Goal:** Find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$. This is also known as the rank of the group, $d(\\pi_1(M))$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the fundamental group of the complement of the surface**\n\nFirst, we need the fundamental group of the complement of the surface $S_{K,5}$ in $S^4$, which is $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S_{K,5})$.\n\n1.  **The group of the trefoil knot ($G_K$)**: The fundamental group of the complement of the trefoil knot $K$ in $S^3$ can be presented as $G_K = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2 = y^3 \\rangle$. This is the group of the torus knot $T(2,3)$.\n\n2.  **The meridian ($\\mu$)**: A meridian for the knot $K=T(2,3)$ in this presentation is given by $\\mu = x^{-1}y$. To verify this, one can check the abelianization of $G_K$. $H_1(S^3 \\setminus K) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The abelianization of $G_K$ is $\\langle x,y \\mid 2x=3y \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, generated by the image of $x^{-1}y$.\n\n3.  **The group of the complement of the twist-spun knot**: A theorem by Zeeman states that for a knot $K$ with knot group $G_K$ and meridian $\\mu$, the fundamental group of the complement of its k-twist-spun version $S_{K,k}$ is given by:\n    $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S_{K,k}) \\cong G_K / \\langle\\langle [\\mu^k, g] = 1 \\text{ for all } g \\in G_K \\rangle\\rangle$\n    This means we take the knot group $G_K$ and quotient by the normal subgroup generated by the relations that make $\\mu^k$ a central element.\n\n    For our case, $K$ is the trefoil, $k=5$, $G_K = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2 = y^3 \\rangle$, and $\\mu = x^{-1}y$. So, the group of the complement, let's call it $\\Pi$, is:\n    $\\Pi = \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S_{K,5}) = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2=y^3, [\\mu^5, x]=1, [\\mu^5, y]=1 \\rangle$, where $\\mu = x^{-1}y$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the fundamental group of the double branched cover**\n\nWe now need to find $\\pi_1(M)$. A key result from knot theory, generalized to higher dimensions by Litherland, states that the fundamental group of the $n$-fold cyclic branched cover of $S^4$ over a locally flat 2-knot $S$ (which $S_{K,k}$ is) is given by:\n$\\pi_1(\\Sigma_n(S)) \\cong \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus S) / \\langle\\langle \\mu^n = 1 \\rangle\\rangle$,\nwhere $\\mu$ is a meridian for $S$.\n\nA double branched cover is a 2-fold cyclic cover, so $n=2$. Thus, the fundamental group of our manifold $M$ is:\n$\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\Pi / \\langle\\langle \\mu^2 = 1 \\rangle\\rangle$.\n\nSo, to get a presentation for $\\pi_1(M)$, we take the presentation for $\\Pi$ and add the relation $\\mu^2=1$:\n$\\pi_1(M) = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2=y^3, [\\mu^5, x]=1, [\\mu^5, y]=1, \\mu^2=1 \\rangle$, where $\\mu = x^{-1}y$.\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the group presentation**\n\nLet's simplify this presentation for $\\pi_1(M)$.\n\n1.  The new relation is $\\mu^2 = 1$. Since $\\mu = x^{-1}y$, this is $(x^{-1}y)^2 = 1$.\n\n2.  Now consider the relation $[\\mu^5, g] = 1$. Since we have added the relation $\\mu^2=1$, we can simplify $\\mu^5 = (\\mu^2)^2 \\mu = 1^2 \\mu = \\mu$.\n    So, the centrality condition on $\\mu^5$ becomes a centrality condition on $\\mu$. The relations $[\\mu^5, x]=1$ and $[\\mu^5, y]=1$ simplify to $[\\mu, x]=1$ and $[\\mu, y]=1$.\n\n3.  The presentation for $\\pi_1(M)$ now becomes:\n    $\\pi_1(M) = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2=y^3, \\mu^2=1, [\\mu,x]=1, [\\mu,y]=1 \\rangle$.\n\n4.  Let's analyze the new relations:\n    *   $[\\mu, x]=1 \\implies \\mu x = x \\mu \\implies (x^{-1}y)x = x(x^{-1}y) \\implies x^{-1}yx = y \\implies yx=xy$.\n    *   Since $\\mu$ commuting with $x$ implies that $x$ and $y$ commute, the other centrality relation $[\\mu, y]=1$ is automatically satisfied if $x,y$ commute.\n        So the group is generated by commuting elements $x,y$.\n\n5.  Now we incorporate the commutativity ($xy=yx$) into the other relations:\n    *   The original knot group relation is $x^2 = y^3$.\n    *   The relation from the cover is $\\mu^2=1 \\implies (x^{-1}y)^2=1$. Since $x,y$ commute, this becomes $x^{-2}y^2=1$, which simplifies to $y^2 = x^2$.\n\n6.  So we have the following relations for an abelian group:\n    a) $y^2 = x^2$\n    b) $x^2 = y^3$\n\n7.  Combining these two relations, we get $y^2 = y^3$. In a group, this implies $y=1$ (by multiplying by $y^{-2}$).\n\n8.  Substituting $y=1$ back into $y^2=x^2$, we get $1^2 = x^2$, which means $x^2=1$.\n\n9.  The presentation for the group $\\pi_1(M)$ simplifies to:\n    $\\langle x, y \\mid y=1, x^2=1 \\rangle$.\n    This is the group generated by $x$ with the single relation $x^2=1$. This is the cyclic group of order 2, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the minimal number of generators**\n\nThe fundamental group is $\\pi_1(M) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$. This group is cyclic and can be generated by one element (the non-identity element). Therefore, the minimal number of generators is 1."
