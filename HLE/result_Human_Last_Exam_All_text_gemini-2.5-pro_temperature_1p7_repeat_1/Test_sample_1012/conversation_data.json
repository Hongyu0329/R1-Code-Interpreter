    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Threat Model\n\nThe question asks for a symmetric key length that is secure against an \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer\". This means we must consider the most effective known quantum attacks against symmetric key cryptography.\n\n*   **Symmetric Key Cryptography:** This refers to ciphers like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.\n*   **Classical Attack:** The primary attack against a symmetric cipher is a brute-force attack, which involves trying every possible key until the correct one is found. For a key of `n` bits, there are 2^n possible keys. A classical computer would require, on average, 2^(n-1) attempts to find the key. The difficulty of this attack is measured by its \"security level,\" which is `n` bits.\n*   **Quantum Attack:** The most efficient known quantum algorithm for breaking symmetric encryption is **Grover's algorithm**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Impact of Grover's Algorithm\n\nGrover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm that can find a specific entry in an unstructured database of `N` items much faster than a classical computer.\n\n*   **Classical Search:** Requires O(N) operations.\n*   **Quantum Search (Grover's):** Requires only O(√N) operations.\n\nWhen applied to breaking a symmetric key of length `n`, the \"database\" is the set of all 2^n possible keys. So, `N = 2^n`.\n\n*   A classical brute-force attack requires approximately O(2^n) operations. The security is `n` bits.\n*   A quantum attack using Grover's algorithm requires approximately O(√(2^n)) = O(2^(n/2)) operations.\n\nThis means that a quantum computer effectively **halves the bit security** of a symmetric key. A key of `n` bits provides only `n/2` bits of security against an attack by a quantum computer.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Required Security Level\n\nTo be considered \"unbreakable\" or secure for the long term, a cryptographic system should provide at least a **128-bit security level**. This means an attacker would need to perform roughly 2^128 computational steps to break it, which is considered computationally infeasible for the foreseeable future, for any kind of computer.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Minimum Key Length\n\nWe need the post-quantum security level to be at least 128 bits. Let `n` be the required key length. Based on the analysis in Step 2, the post-quantum security is `n/2`.\n\nSo, we set up the equation:\n`n / 2 ≥ 128`\n\nSolving for `n`:\n`n ≥ 128 * 2`\n`n ≥ 256`\n\nTherefore, to achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, a symmetric key must be at least **256 bits** long.\n\n### Step 5: Evaluate the Answer Choices\n\n*   **A. 256:** A 256-bit key provides 256 / 2 = 128 bits of security against a quantum computer. This meets the minimum requirement.\n*   **B. 128:** A 128-bit key provides 128 / 2 = 64 bits of security against a quantum computer. A 2^64 search is considered feasible, so this is not secure.\n*   **C. 512:** A 512-bit key provides 512 / 2 = 256 bits of security. This is very secure, but the question asks for the minimum length (\"at least\").\n*   **D. 1024:** Provides 512 bits of security. Secure, but not the minimum.\n*   **E. 2028:** Provides 1024 bits of security. Secure, but not the minimum.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe minimum symmetric key length that provides at least 128-bit security against a powerful quantum computer is 256 bits. This is why cryptographic standards bodies like NIST recommend transitioning to algorithms like AES-256 for long-term data protection in a post-quantum world.\n\n<<<A>>>"
