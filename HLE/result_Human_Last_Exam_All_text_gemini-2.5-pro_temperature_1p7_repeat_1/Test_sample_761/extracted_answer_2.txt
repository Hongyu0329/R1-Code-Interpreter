No, polynucleotides (including homopolynucleotides) are not structurally polysaccharides. They are a distinct class of macromolecules. While both are polymers containing sugar units, their fundamental structures differ in three critical ways: 1) The monomer of a polynucleotide is a nucleotide (sugar + phosphate + nitrogenous base), whereas the monomer of a polysaccharide is a monosaccharide (sugar only). 2) The monomers in a polynucleotide are linked by phosphodiester bonds, creating a sugar-phosphate backbone, while monomers in a polysaccharide are linked by glycosidic bonds. 3) Polynucleotides contain nitrogen and phosphorus, which are absent in polysaccharides.
