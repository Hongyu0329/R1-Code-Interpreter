    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Objective:**\nFind the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$ for an electron in the first Bohr orbit, where:\n*   $\\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in its momentum.\n*   $p$ is the magnitude of its momentum.\n\n**Given Information:**\n*   The particle is an electron.\n*   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit, so the principal quantum number $n = 1$.\n*   The uncertainty in the electron's position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$).**\n\n*   **Principle:** We use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states the relationship between the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$). The minimum uncertainty is given by the formula:\n    $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\n    We will use the equality for the minimum possible uncertainty:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   Ensure all units are in the SI system.\n    *   The given position uncertainty is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$.\n    *   The reduced Planck's constant is $\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}}{2 \\times (10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m})} = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34}}{20 \\times 10^{-12}} \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s}$\n    $\\Delta p = 5.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the momentum ($p$) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.**\n\n*   **Principle:** According to Bohr's model, the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in an orbit is quantized:\n    $L = mvr = n\\hbar$\n    where $m$ is mass, $v$ is velocity, $r$ is the orbital radius, and $n$ is the principal quantum number. Since linear momentum is $p = mv$, we can write this as:\n    $p \\cdot r = n\\hbar$\n    For the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$, so:\n    $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   We need the radius of the first Bohr orbit ($r_1$). This is a fundamental constant known as the Bohr radius ($a_0$).\n    *   $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    $p = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}}{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}$\n    $p \\approx 1.992 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s}$\n\n**Step 3: Find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum ($\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$).**\n\n*   **Principle:** We simply divide the result from Step 1 by the result from Step 2.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   This is a dimensionless ratio, so the units should cancel out completely.\n    *   We can also solve this algebraically before plugging in numbers for a simpler calculation, which helps avoid rounding errors.\n*   **Calculation (Method 1: Using calculated values):**\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s}}{1.992 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg} \\cdot \\text{m/s}} \\approx 2.645$\n*   **Calculation (Method 2: Using formulas):**\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar / (2 \\Delta x)}{\\hbar / r_1}$\n    The $\\hbar$ terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n    Now, substitute the values for $r_1$ and $\\Delta x$:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m})} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11}}{20 \\times 10^{-12}}$\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29}{2} = 2.645$\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The ratio is approximately 2.65.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
