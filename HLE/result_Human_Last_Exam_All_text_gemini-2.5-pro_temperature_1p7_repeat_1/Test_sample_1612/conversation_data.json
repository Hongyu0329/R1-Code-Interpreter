    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Step 1: Define the MLB Batting Triple Crown\nFirst, it is crucial to understand what the Triple Crown in baseball entails. For a batter to win the Triple Crown, they must lead their respective league (either the American League or the National League) in three key statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (BA)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: Identify and List all Triple Crown Winners by League\nThe next step is to list every player who has accomplished this feat, separating them by league.\n\n**National League (NL) Winners:**\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878): He is officially credited by MLB, though some historical records from that era are debated.\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894)\n*   **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1925): He is one of two players to win the award twice.\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937): He was the last player to win the Triple Crown in the National League.\n\n**American League (AL) Winners:**\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1947): He is the other player to have won the award twice.\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012): The most recent player to win the Triple Crown.\n\n### Step 3: Address Careful Points and Nuances\n1.  **Unique Winners vs. Total Instances:** The question asks \"how many... winners,\" which refers to the number of distinct individuals who have achieved the feat. While the Triple Crown has been won 17 times, two players (Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams) won it twice. Therefore, we must count each of them only once to get the number of unique winners.\n2.  **League-Specific Achievement:** The Triple Crown is a league award (AL or NL), not an overall MLB award. A player must lead his own league in all three categories, not necessarily all of Major League Baseball.\n3.  **Historical Records:** The 1878 win by Paul Hines is sometimes noted as controversial due to inconsistent stat-keeping in the 19th century, but he is officially recognized by MLB as a Triple Crown winner.\n4.  **Pitching Triple Crown:** It's important not to confuse the batting Triple Crown with the pitching Triple Crown (leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA). The question, using the general term, almost universally refers to the batting achievement.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Number\nTo get the final answer, we count the number of unique players from the lists in Step 2.\n\n*   **Unique NL Winners:** Paul Hines, Hugh Duffy, Heinie Zimmerman, Rogers Hornsby, Chuck Klein, Joe Medwick.\n    *   Total = **6 players**\n*   **Unique AL Winners:** Nap Lajoie, Ty Cobb, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Frank Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski, Miguel Cabrera.\n    *   Total = **9 players**\n\nThe total number of unique Triple Crown winners in MLB history is the sum of the winners from both leagues.\n*   Total Winners = 6 (NL) + 9 (AL) = **15**\n\n<<<15>>>"
