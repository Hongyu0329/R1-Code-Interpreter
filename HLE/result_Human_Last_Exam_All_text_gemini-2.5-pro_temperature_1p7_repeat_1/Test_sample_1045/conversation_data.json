    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and atomic composition of toluene.**\nThe chemical formula for toluene is C₇H₈.\nThis means the molecule consists of:\n*   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n**Step 2: Understand the meaning of the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a type of split-valence basis set developed by Pople's group. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). A CGF is a fixed linear combination of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). The number of CGFs is also referred to as the number of basis functions.\n\nLet's break down the \"6-31G\" name:\n*   **The hyphen (-)**: Separates the description of the core atomic orbitals from the valence atomic orbitals.\n*   **6-**: This describes the core electrons. Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is formed from a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **-31G**: This describes the valence electrons. The valence shell is \"split\" into two basis functions for each atomic orbital.\n    *   The **3** indicates the \"inner\" valence shell is represented by a CGF made from 3 PGFs.\n    *   The **1** indicates the \"outer\" valence shell is represented by a CGF made from 1 PGF (it is an uncontracted primitive function).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a single Carbon (C) atom.**\nA Carbon atom is a second-row element (atomic number 6) with both core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) electrons.\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** According to the \"6-\" part, the 1s core orbital is described by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** According to the \"-31G\" part, each valence orbital is split into two CGFs (an inner and an outer part).\n    *   For the 2s orbital, this gives 2 CGFs.\n    *   For the 2p orbitals (which consist of 2px, 2py, and 2pz), this gives 2 CGFs for each p orbital, for a total of 3 × 2 = 6 CGFs.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a single Hydrogen (H) atom.**\nA Hydrogen atom is a first-row element (atomic number 1) and has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is treated as a valence orbital.\n*   **Valence (1s orbital):** The \"-31G\" description applies. The 1s orbital is split into two CGFs.\n    *   An \"inner\" part described by 1 CGF (from 3 PGFs).\n    *   An \"outer\" part described by 1 CGF (from 1 PGF).\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the toluene molecule (C₇H₈).**\nNow, we sum the contributions from all atoms in the molecule.\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:** 7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs.\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:** 8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs.\n*   **Total for Toluene:** 63 + 16 = **79 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Molecule Composition:** Ensure the number of Carbon (7) and Hydrogen (8) atoms for toluene is correct.\n2.  **CGF vs. PGF:** The question asks for *contracted* Gaussian functions (CGFs), not *primitive* Gaussian functions (PGFs). CGFs are the basis functions used in the calculation.\n3.  **Core vs. Valence:** Correctly distinguish between core and valence electrons. The \"6-\" part of 6-31G applies only to core orbitals, while \"-31G\" applies to valence orbitals.\n4.  **Hydrogen Exception:** Remember that Hydrogen has no core electrons, so only the valence description (\"-31G\") applies to its 1s orbital.\n5.  **p-orbitals:** Remember that the \"p\" subshell consists of three orbitals (px, py, pz). The basis set description applies to each of them individually. For 6-31G, this means 3 (p-orbitals) × 2 (split) = 6 CGFs for the p-shell of carbon.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** Double-check the multiplication and addition: (7 × 9) + (8 × 2).\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as follows:\n(7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/atom) + (8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/atom) = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
