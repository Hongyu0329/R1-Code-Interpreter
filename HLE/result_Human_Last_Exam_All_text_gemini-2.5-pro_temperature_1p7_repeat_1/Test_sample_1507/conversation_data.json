    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the \"Great Icosahedron\"**:\n    *   The great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is composed of 20 intersecting triangular faces.\n    *   It has 12 vertices and 30 edges. Crucially, its vertices are arranged in the same positions as the vertices of a regular (convex) icosahedron.\n\n2.  **Understand the \"Outer-Hull\"**:\n    *   The \"outer-hull,\" more formally known as the convex hull, of a set of points (like the vertices of a polyhedron) is the smallest convex shape that contains all the points.\n    *   Since the vertices of the great icosahedron are identical to the vertices of a regular icosahedron, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n3.  **Understand the \"Triangulation\" of the Outer-Hull**:\n    *   The question asks for the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull.\" This means we need to find the smallest number of non-overlapping triangles that can completely cover the surface of the outer-hull shape.\n    *   As established in Step 2, the outer-hull is a regular icosahedron.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Surface of a Regular Icosahedron**:\n    *   A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid. By definition, its surface is composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles.\n    *   These 20 triangular faces already form a perfect triangulation of the surface.\n\n5.  **Determine the \"Minimal Number\"**:\n    *   Since the surface of the regular icosahedron is already made of 20 triangles, this is a valid triangulation.\n    *   It is also the *minimal* triangulation because the faces themselves are triangles. It is impossible to cover the surface with fewer than 20 triangles without creating non-triangular shapes or leaving gaps. Any further subdivision would only increase the number of triangles.\n    *   The phrase \"number of visible triangles from the outside\" reinforces that we are considering the faces on the surface of this convex hull. For any convex polyhedron, all of its faces are visible from the outside.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe problem simplifies to finding the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\n\n*   The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n*   A regular icosahedron is defined as having a surface made of 20 triangles.\n*   This is the minimal number of triangles required to tile its own surface.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of triangles needed is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
