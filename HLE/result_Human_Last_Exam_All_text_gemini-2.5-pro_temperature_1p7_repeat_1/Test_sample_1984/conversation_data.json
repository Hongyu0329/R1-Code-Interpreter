    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the concept of equilibrium points**\nAn autonomous first-order ordinary differential equation has the form $x'(t) = f(x(t))$. The equilibrium points (or critical points) of this equation are the values of $x$ for which the derivative $x'(t)$ is zero. These are the constant solutions to the differential equation. To find them, we must solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\nFor the given equation, $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$, the function is $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points**\nWe set $f(x) = 0$ and solve for $x$:\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nFirst, we can factor out a $-x$:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term in the parenthesis is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThis equation gives two solutions:\n1.  $-x = 0 \\implies x = 0$\n2.  $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\nSo, the equilibrium points are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stability of the equilibrium points**\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ can be determined by analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ around $x^*$, or by using the first derivative test (linearization). An equilibrium point $x^*$ is:\n*   **Stable** if solutions that start near $x^*$ approach $x^*$ as $t \\to \\infty$. This happens if $f'(x^*) < 0$.\n*   **Unstable** if solutions that start near $x^*$ move away from $x^*$ as $t \\to \\infty$. This happens if $f'(x^*) > 0$.\n*   **Semi-stable** or requires further testing if $f'(x^*) = 0$.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$**:\n    We evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$**:\n    We evaluate $f'(x)$ at $x=1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n\n    Let's check the sign of $f(x)$ on either side of $x=1$:\n    *   **For $x$ slightly less than 1** (e.g., $x=0.9$): The term $-x$ is negative, and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(x) = (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$. Since $x' = f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing, moving away from $x=1$.\n    *   **For $x$ slightly greater than 1** (e.g., $x=1.1$): The term $-x$ is negative, and $(x-1)^2$ is positive. Thus, $f(x) = (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$. Since $x' = f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing, moving towards $x=1$.\n\n    Since solutions starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the point is not stable. This type of point is called semi-stable.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correctly identify equilibrium points:** Solve $f(x) = 0$, which correctly gave $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n2.  **Use the correct stability test:** The sign of $f'(x^*)$ is the standard test.\n3.  **Handle the inconclusive case:** When $f'(x^*) = 0$, it is crucial to use another method, like sign analysis of $f(x)$ around $x^*$.\n4.  **Strict definition of stability:** An equilibrium point is only considered stable if trajectories on *both* sides of the point converge to it. Since trajectories for $x<1$ move away from $x=1$, it is not stable.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the value of m**\nThe variable $m$ represents the number of stable equilibrium points. Based on our analysis, only the equilibrium point $x=0$ is stable.\nTherefore, $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final answer**\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$:\n$1 - 2^{4048}$\n\nThe final answer is the expression $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
