The proposed filtering strategy involves three main steps. First, create a specific list of contaminant gene markers by identifying genes that are highly expressed in a reference transcriptome of the pure cancer cell line but have negligible expression in a reference T-cell transcriptome; save this list to a file (e.g., `contaminant_genes.txt`). Second, use your differential expression table to verify that these marker genes indeed show a strong negative log2 fold change, confirming the contamination issue. Third, use a command-line tool like `awk` to filter your main differential expression results file, removing all rows corresponding to the genes listed in your contaminant file. The following `awk` command accomplishes this, assuming gene IDs are in the first column: `awk 'FNR==NR {contaminants[$1]; next} !($1 in contaminants)' contaminant_genes.txt unfiltered_results.tsv > filtered_results.tsv`. This approach is superior to a naive log2FC cutoff as it specifically targets known contaminants without accidentally removing real biological signal.
