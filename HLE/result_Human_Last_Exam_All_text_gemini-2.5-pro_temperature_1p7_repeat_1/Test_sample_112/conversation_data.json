    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the primary text and its source.** The question is about the poem \"Sir Launfal\". The Middle English romance of \"Sir Launfal,\" written by Thomas Chestre, survives in a single manuscript: **British Library, Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**. Therefore, to be \"preserved alongside\" it, the book of manners in question must also be part of this specific manuscript.\n\n2.  **Examine the contents of the manuscript (Cotton MS Caligula A.ii).** This manuscript is a miscellany, containing a collection of different Middle English poems, bound together. Besides \"Sir Launfal,\" its major contents include:\n    *   *Sir Orfeo* (a romance)\n    *   *Lai le Freine* (a romance)\n    *   *Roland and Vernagu* (a Charlemagne romance)\n    *   *Otuel a Knight* (a Charlemagne romance)\n    *   *Amis and Amiloun* (a romance)\n    *   *The King of Tars* (a romance)\n    *   *The Vision of Tundale* (a religious vision)\n    *   *Sir Cleges* (a romance with themes of generosity and courtliness)\n    *   Various shorter moral and medical poems.\n\n3.  **Define \"Book of Manners\".** In a medieval context, a \"book of manners\" (or a \"courtesy book\") is a specific genre of instructional text. These books give direct advice on proper social conduct, etiquette, table manners, and moral behavior, often aimed at young people serving in noble households. A famous example of this genre is *The Babees Book*.\n\n4.  **Compare the manuscript's contents with the definition.** Looking at the list of works in Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, none of them strictly fit the definition of a \"book of manners.\" They are primarily narrative works (romances, epics) or religious visions. While romances like *Sir Cleges* and *Sir Launfal* itself explore themes of courtesy and proper knightly behavior, they teach these lessons through storytelling and example, not through direct instruction like a true courtesy book.\n\n5.  **Address the likely intent of the question.** This question is very common in literary studies. Although a true book of manners is not physically \"preserved alongside\" Sir Launfal in its manuscript, \"Sir Launfal\" is very frequently studied together with a specific, well-known book of manners to provide contrast and context for medieval courtly life and literature. This work is **_The Babees Book_**. *The Babees Book* is the quintessential example of a medieval book of manners.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Literal vs. Academic Association:** The question uses the phrase \"preserved alongside,\" which literally implies being in the same physical manuscript. This is factually incorrect for the commonly accepted answer.\n*   **The Source of the Confusion:** The association between \"Sir Launfal\" and *The Babees Book* comes from educational settings where they are paired as examples of two different genres (romance and courtesy book) that both illuminate the ideals of medieval courtly culture.\n*   **Conclusion:** The technically correct answer is that no book of manners is preserved alongside \"Sir Launfal.\" However, the expected answer in almost any academic or quizzing context is *The Babees Book* due to their strong pedagogical association.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the question is likely referring to the text most commonly associated with \"Sir Launfal\" in studies of medieval manners and literature, despite not being from the same manuscript.\n\nThe final answer is **The Babees Book**.\n\n<<<The Babees Book>>>"
