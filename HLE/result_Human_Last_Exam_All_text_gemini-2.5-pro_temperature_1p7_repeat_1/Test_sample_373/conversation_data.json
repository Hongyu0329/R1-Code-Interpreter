    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in randomized uniform gossiping on a barbell graph with 10 nodes.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Graph Structure\n1.  **Barbell Graph:** A standard barbell graph is constructed by taking two identical complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge.\n2.  **Total Nodes:** The graph has a total of 10 nodes.\n3.  **Graph Composition:** To have 10 nodes in total, the two complete graphs must each have 5 nodes. So, the graph consists of two $K_5$ (complete graphs on 5 vertices), let's call them Clique A and Clique B.\n4.  **The Bottleneck Edge:** There is a single edge connecting one node from Clique A to one node from Clique B. This single connecting edge is the \"bottleneck edge\". Let's name the endpoints of this edge $u$ (in Clique A) and $v$ (in Clique B).\n\n### Step 2: Determine Node Degrees\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. We need to calculate the degree for each node in the graph.\n1.  **Nodes $u$ and $v$:** These are the endpoints of the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Node $u$ is in Clique A ($K_5$). It is connected to the other 4 nodes within its clique.\n    *   It is also connected to node $v$ via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Therefore, the degree of $u$ is $\\text{deg}(u) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n    *   By symmetry, the degree of $v$ is also $\\text{deg}(v) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n2.  **Other Nodes:**\n    *   Consider any other node in Clique A (not $u$). There are 4 such nodes. Each is connected only to the other 4 nodes within Clique A. Its degree is 4.\n    *   Similarly, any other node in Clique B (not $v$) has a degree of 4.\n    *   In summary, we have 2 nodes with degree 5 and 8 nodes with degree 4.\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Sampling Process\nThe problem specifies \"randomized uniform gossiping\". This process consists of two stages:\n1.  **Node Selection:** A node `i` is selected uniformly at random from the set of all 10 nodes. The probability of selecting any specific node is $P(\\text{select node } i) = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n2.  **Neighbor Selection:** The selected node `i` then chooses one of its neighbors, `j`, uniformly at random. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor `j` is $P(\\text{select neighbor } j | \\text{select node } i) = \\frac{1}{\\text{deg}(i)}$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge\nThe bottleneck edge $(u, v)$ is \"sampled\" if either node $u$ is selected and it chooses $v$, OR node $v$ is selected and it chooses $u$. These are two mutually exclusive events.\n\n1.  **Event 1: Node $u$ is selected and chooses neighbor $v$.**\n    *   The probability of selecting node $u$ is $P(\\text{select } u) = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n    *   Given $u$ is selected, the probability it chooses $v$ is $P(u \\text{ chooses } v) = \\frac{1}{\\text{deg}(u)} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n    *   The probability of this entire event is $P(u \\to v) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n2.  **Event 2: Node $v$ is selected and chooses neighbor $u$.**\n    *   The probability of selecting node $v$ is $P(\\text{select } v) = \\frac{1}{10}$.\n    *   Given $v$ is selected, the probability it chooses $u$ is $P(v \\text{ chooses } u) = \\frac{1}{\\text{deg}(v)} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n    *   The probability of this entire event is $P(v \\to u) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n3.  **Total Probability:** The total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n    *   $P(\\text{sample bottleneck edge}) = P(u \\to v) + P(v \\to u) = \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}$.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe probability can be expressed as a fraction or a decimal.\n$P = \\frac{1}{25} = 0.04$\n\n<<<0.04>>>"
