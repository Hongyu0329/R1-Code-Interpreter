    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **\"HR and HRV were tracked...\"**: The context is the measurement of Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n2.  **\"...by capturing beat-to-beat intervals...\"**: This specifies the raw data being collected. The fundamental piece of information is the time duration *between* each consecutive heartbeat.\n3.  **\"...by using PPG.\"**: This tells us the technology used is Photoplethysmography, the optical sensor method common in smartwatches and fitness trackers. It detects pulse waves from blood volume changes.\n4.  **\"HRV is computed as a value between heartbeats.\"**: This is a slightly simplified way of saying that HRV is calculated *from* the sequence of time intervals between heartbeats.\n5.  **\"What is that value called?\"**: This is the core question. It asks for the specific name of the time interval measured between two consecutive heartbeats.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **HR vs. HRV vs. The Interval:** It's crucial to distinguish between these three things.\n    *   **Heart Rate (HR):** The average number of beats in a given time period (e.g., beats per minute).\n    *   **The Interval:** The specific time duration (usually in milliseconds) between two successive heartbeats. This is the raw measurement.\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** A statistical measure of the *variation* in these successive time intervals. It is not one single interval, but a calculation (like standard deviation) based on a series of intervals.\n\n2.  **Terminology based on Technology (ECG vs. PPG):**\n    *   In clinical electrocardiography (ECG), the most distinct electrical spike is the \"R-peak.\" The time between two consecutive R-peaks is called the **R-R Interval**.\n    *   In photoplethysmography (PPG), the sensor detects the peak of the blood pulse wave. The time between these successive peaks is most accurately called the **Peak-to-Peak Interval (PPI)** or **Inter-Pulse Interval (IPI)**.\n\n3.  **General Terminology:** Despite the technical differences, the term **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** is widely used as a general and accurate term that applies regardless of the measurement technology (ECG or PPG). In many scientific papers and applications, \"R-R interval\" and \"IBI\" are used interchangeably, even when the data comes from a PPG source.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  The question asks for the name of the \"value between heartbeats\". This value is a measure of time.\n2.  This time measurement is the fundamental data point used to calculate both average Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability.\n3.  Based on the analysis of terminology, several names exist (R-R Interval, PPI, IBI).\n4.  The most common, clear, and generally accepted term for the time duration between consecutive heartbeats is the **Inter-beat Interval**, often abbreviated as **IBI**. It perfectly describes what is being measured.\n\n<<<Inter-beat Interval"
