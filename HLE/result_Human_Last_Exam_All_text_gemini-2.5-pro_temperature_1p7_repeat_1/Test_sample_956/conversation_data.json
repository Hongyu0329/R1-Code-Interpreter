    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the group G and its generators**\n\nLet $\\Omega = \\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z \\}$, a set of 12 elements.\nThe group $G$ is generated by three permutations $a, b, c$ acting on $\\Omega$:\n$a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$\n$b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$\n$c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$\n\nWe determine the parity of these permutations. A $k$-cycle is an even permutation if $k$ is odd, and an odd permutation if $k$ is even.\n-   $a$ is an 11-cycle. Since 11 is odd, $a$ is an even permutation.\n-   $b$ is a product of two 4-cycles. A 4-cycle is odd. The product of two odd permutations is even. So, $b$ is an even permutation.\n-   $c$ is a product of six 2-cycles (transpositions). A transposition is odd. The product of an even number of odd permutations is even. So, $c$ is an even permutation.\n\nSince all generators $a, b, c$ are even permutations, any element of the group $G=\\langle a, b, c \\rangle$ must be an even permutation. Thus, $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_{12}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of G**\n\nThe permutation $a$ is a cycle of length 11, so its support has size 11, leaving $z$ fixed. The permutation $c$ maps 3 (in the support of $a$) to $z$. This implies that the orbit of any element under $G$ contains all 12 elements. Thus, $G$ is a transitive group on $\\Omega$.\n\nLet's consider the stabilizer of the point $z$, denoted by $G_z$. The permutations $a$ and $b$ both fix $z$, so they are in $G_z$. Let $H = \\langle a, b \\rangle$. Then $H \\le G_z$. The group $G_z$ acts on the remaining 11 elements, $\\Omega' = \\Omega \\setminus \\{z\\}$.\nThe permutation $a$ acts as an 11-cycle on these 11 elements. Therefore, the group $H$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_{11}$. Since 11 is a prime number, a transitive subgroup of $S_{11}$ must be primitive. So $H$ is a primitive subgroup of $S_{11}$.\nFurthermore, since $G \\le A_{12}$, any element of $G_z$ must be an even permutation when viewed in $S_{12}$. The elements of $G_z$ fix one point, so their sign as permutations in $S_{11}$ is the same as their sign in $S_{12}$. Hence, $G_z \\le A_{11}$. This implies $H \\le A_{11}$.\n\nThe primitive subgroups of $S_{11}$ are known to be $L_2(11)$, $M_{11}$, $A_{11}$, and $S_{11}$ (and groups in between these, if any exist). We have already established that $H \\le A_{11}$, so we can exclude $S_{11}$.\nThe permutation $b$ has order lcm(4,4)=4. The group $PSL(2,11)$ (or $L_2(11)$) has order $660 = 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$. Its Sylow 2-subgroup is isomorphic to the Klein four-group $C_2 \\times C_2$, which means $L_2(11)$ contains no elements of order 4. Therefore, $H$ cannot be $L_2(11)$.\nThis leaves two possibilities for $H$: $M_{11}$ or $A_{11}$.\n\n-   Case 1: $H \\cong M_{11}$. Since $H \\le G_z \\le A_{11}$, and $M_{11}$ is a maximal subgroup of $A_{11}$, either $G_z \\cong M_{11}$ or $G_z \\cong A_{11}$. If we assume $G_z \\cong M_{11}$, then $G$ is a transitive group of degree 12 with a point stabilizer isomorphic to $M_{11}$. Such a group is known to be isomorphic to the Mathieu group $M_{12}$.\n-   Case 2: $H \\cong A_{11}$. Then it's highly likely $G_z \\cong A_{11}$. By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, $|G|=|\\text{orbit}(z)| \\cdot |G_z| = 12 \\cdot |A_{11}| = 12 \\cdot (11!/2) = 12!/2 = |A_{12}|$. Since we already know $G \\le A_{12}$, it follows that $G \\cong A_{12}$.\n\nSo the group $G$ is either isomorphic to $M_{12}$ or $A_{12}$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Schur Multiplier A of G**\n\nThe Schur multiplier of a group $G$, denoted $M(G)$, is the second homology group $H_2(G, \\mathbb{Z})$. We need to find the Schur multiplier for both potential groups.\n-   The Schur multiplier of the Mathieu group $M_{12}$ is well-known: $M(M_{12}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n-   The Schur multiplier of the alternating group $A_n$ for $n \\geq 8$ is also well-known: $M(A_n) \\cong C_2$. For $n=12$, this gives $M(A_{12}) \\cong C_2$.\n\nIn both possible cases, the Schur multiplier of $G$, which the question denotes as $A$, is isomorphic to $C_2$. So, $A \\cong C_2$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of proper subgroups of A up to isomorphism**\n\nThe group $A$ is isomorphic to $C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2. A group of prime order has only two subgroups: the trivial subgroup and the group itself.\nThe subgroups of $A \\cong C_2$ are:\n1.  The trivial subgroup, $\\{e\\}$, of order 1.\n2.  The group $A$ itself, of order 2.\n\nA proper subgroup is any subgroup other than the group itself. For $A$, the only proper subgroup is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n\nThe question asks to count the number of these proper subgroups *up to isomorphism*.\n- The set of proper subgroups of $A$ is $S = \\{\\{e\\}\\}$.\n- We need to find the number of distinct isomorphism classes for the subgroups in $S$.\n- The only subgroup in $S$ is the trivial group. Its isomorphism class is that of the trivial group of order 1, which can be denoted $C_1$.\n- There is only one such isomorphism class.\n\nTherefore, there is exactly 1 proper subgroup of $A$ up to isomorphism."
