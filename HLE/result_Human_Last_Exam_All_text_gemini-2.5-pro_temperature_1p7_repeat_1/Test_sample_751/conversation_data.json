    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the observer canonical form and the new matrix C.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Duality Principle**\n\nThe problem requires us to use the principle of duality. This principle states that a linear time-invariant system `S: x(k+1) = Ax(k), y(k)=Cx(k)` is observable if and only if its dual system `S_d: z(k+1) = A'z(k) + C'v(k)` is controllable.\n\nA transformation `T` that converts the system `S` to its observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)` is related to the transformation `P` that converts the dual system `S_d` to its controllable canonical form `(A_c, B_c)`. The relationship between the canonical matrices is:\n*   `A_o = A_c'` (transpose of A_c)\n*   `C_o = B_c'` (transpose of B_c)\n\nTherefore, our task is to find the input matrix `B_c` for the controllable canonical form of the dual system `(A', C')`, and then transpose it to get `C_o`.\n\n**2. Determine the Observability Indices**\n\nThe structure of the canonical form is determined by the observability indices `ν_i` of the original system `(A, C)`. These indices are identical to the controllability indices `µ_i` of the dual system `(A', C')`.\n\nTo find the observability indices, we construct the observability matrix `O` and select `n` (the dimension of the state space, here `n=3`) linearly independent rows from it.\n`O = [C; CA; CA^2; ...]`\n\nThe system matrices are:\n`A = [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0]`\n`C = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0]`\n\nThe rows of `C` are `c1' = [0, 1, 0]` and `c2' = [1, 1, 0]`.\n\nNext, compute `CA`:\n`CA = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [[2, 1, 1], [3, 2, 1]]`\nThe rows of `CA` are `c1'A = [2, 1, 1]` and `c2'A = [3, 2, 1]`.\n\nNow, select `n=3` linearly independent rows from `O` in the specified order: `c1', c2', c1'A, c2'A, ...`\n1.  Select `c1' = [0, 1, 0]`. This is a non-zero vector.\n2.  Select `c2' = [1, 1, 0]`. This is linearly independent of `c1'`.\n3.  Select `c1'A = [2, 1, 1]`. We check if `{c1', c2', c1'A}` are linearly independent by computing the determinant of the matrix formed by these rows:\n    `det([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]]) = 0 - 1*(1*1 - 0*2) + 0 = -1`.\n    Since the determinant is non-zero, the three vectors are linearly independent.\n\nWe have found `n=3` linearly independent rows. The selection process stops.\n\nThe observability indices `(ν1, ν2)` are the number of rows selected from each chain starting with `c1'` and `c2'`.\n*   Chain 1 (from `c1'`): We selected `c1'` and `c1'A`. The length is 2. So, `ν1 = 2`.\n*   Chain 2 (from `c2'`): We selected `c2'`. The length is 1. So, `ν2 = 1`.\nThe observability indices are `(2, 1)`.\n\n**3. Determine the Controllable Canonical Form's Input Matrix `B_c`**\n\nThe controllability indices `(µ1, µ2)` of the dual system `(A', C')` are equal to the observability indices, so `(µ1, µ2) = (2, 1)`.\n\nThe standard (Luenberger) controllable canonical form `(A_c, B_c)` for a system with indices `(µ1, µ2)` has a specific structure for its input matrix `B_c`. The `i`-th input `v_i` of the dual system drives the last state of the `i`-th control chain.\n*   The first input `v1` (dual to the first output `y1`) corresponds to the first chain of length `µ1=2`. It affects the state at index `µ1=2`. The corresponding column in `B_c` is the standard basis vector `e_2`.\n*   The second input `v2` (dual to the second output `y2`) corresponds to the second chain of length `µ2=1`. It affects the state at index `µ1 + µ2 = 2 + 1 = 3`. The corresponding column in `B_c` is `e_3`.\n\nSo, the matrix `B_c` is formed by these basis vectors:\n`B_c = [e_2, e_3] = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\n**4. Determine the Observer Canonical Matrix `C_o`**\n\nUsing the duality relationship `C_o = B_c'`, we find the new matrix C:\n`C_o = [[0, 0], [1, 0], [0, 1]]' = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final value of the new matrix C in observer canonical form is:\n\n`C_o = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\n<<<[[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
