    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n**Step 1: Irreducible Representations of $S_n$ and Partitions**\n\nThe irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. An integer partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers. For $S_{25}$, we are interested in the partitions of 25. Each irrep is uniquely identified by a partition $\\lambda \\vdash 25$.\n\n**Step 2: Dimension of an Irreducible Representation**\n\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, is given by the Hook Length Formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in Y(\\lambda)} h_{ij}}$\nwhere $Y(\\lambda)$ is the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell at position $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of cells to the right of the cell in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus one for the cell itself.\n\nA key property is that the dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is the same as the dimension of the irrep for its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. The conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ is obtained by reflecting the Young diagram of $\\lambda$ across its main diagonal. This means that for any partition $\\lambda$ that is not self-conjugate (i.e., $\\lambda \\neq \\lambda'$), we will find a pair of irreps with the same dimension. If a partition is self-conjugate, it corresponds to a single irrep.\n\n**Step 3: Systematic Search for Low-Dimension Irreps**\n\nThe dimension of an irrep tends to be smaller for partitions that are \"less central\" or \"more skewed\". These are partitions with very large or very small first parts. We will systematically list partitions starting from those with the largest possible first part, $\\lambda_1$, and calculate their dimensions. We only need to check partitions that are \"lexicographically first\" between a partition and its conjugate (e.g., we check $\\lambda=(24,1)$ but not its conjugate $\\lambda'=(2,1^{23})$ initially, as $24>2$).\n\nWe will check partitions for decreasing values of $\\lambda_1$, starting from $\\lambda_1=25$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   For partitions of the form $(n-k, k)$, the dimension is $d_{(n-k,k)} = \\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1}$.\n*   For partitions of the form $(n-k, 1^k)$, the dimension is $d_{(n-k,1^k)} = \\binom{n-1}{k}$.\n*   As partitions become more \"central\" (parts become more equal), the dimension generally grows very rapidly.\n\n**Step 4: Calculation and Counting**\n\nWe list the partitions $\\lambda$ (and their conjugates $\\lambda'$) for which $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'} < 500,000$.\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1=25$**:\n    *   $\\lambda=(25)$: $d_{(25)}=1$. Conjugate is $\\lambda'=(1^{25})$, $d_{(1^{25})}=1$.\n    *   Count: 2\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1=24$**:\n    *   $\\lambda=(24,1)$: $d_{(24,1)} = 25-1=24$.\n    *   Count: 2 (for this partition and its conjugate $(2,1^{23})$)\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1=23$**:\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2}-\\binom{25}{1}=300-25=275$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,1,1)$: $d_{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{24}{2}=276$.\n    *   Count: 4\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1=22$**:\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3}-\\binom{25}{2}=2300-300=2000$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$: $d_{(22,2,1)}=4025$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,1,1,1)$: $d_{(22,1^3)}=\\binom{24}{3}=2024$.\n    *   Count: 6\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1=21$**:\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,4)$: $d_{(21,4)}=\\binom{25}{4}-\\binom{25}{3}=12650-2300=10350$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,3,1)$: $d_{(21,3,1)}=31350$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,2,2)$: $d_{(21,2,2)}=42000$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(21,1,1,1,1)$: $d_{(21,1^4)}=\\binom{24}{4}=10626$.\n    *   Count: 8\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1=20$**:\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,5)$: $d_{(20,5)}=\\binom{25}{5}-\\binom{25}{4}=53130-12650=40480$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,4,1)$: $d_{(20,4,1)}=164220$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,3,2)$: $d_{(20,3,2)}=138000$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,3,1,1)$: $d_{(20,3,1^2)}=249480$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,2,2,1)$: $d_{(20,2,2,1)}=399000$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,2,1,1,1)$: $d_{(20,2,1^3)}=167585$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(20,1^5)$: $d_{(20,1^5)}=\\binom{24}{5}=42504$.\n    *   Count: 14\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1=19$**:\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,6)$: $d_{(19,6)}=\\binom{25}{6}-\\binom{25}{5}=177100-53130=123970$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,5,1)$: $d_{(19,5,1)}=459030$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,2,1^4)$: $d_{(19,2,1^4)}=401625$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(19,1^6)$: $d_{(19,1^6)}=\\binom{24}{6}=134596$.\n    *   Other partitions like $(19,4,1,1)$ have dimensions $> 500,000$.\n    *   Count: 8\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1=18$**:\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,7)$: $d_{(18,7)}=\\binom{25}{7}-\\binom{25}{6}=480700-177100=303600$.\n    *   $\\lambda=(18,1^7)$: $d_{(18,1^7)}=\\binom{24}{7}=346104$.\n    *   Other partitions like $(18,6,1)$ have dimensions $> 500,000$.\n    *   Count: 4\n\n*   **$\\lambda_1=17$**:\n    *   $\\lambda=(17,8)$: $d_{(17,8)}=\\binom{25}{8}-\\binom{25}{7}=1081575-480700=600875$, which is $> 500,000$.\n    *   Dimensions for partitions starting with $\\lambda_1 \\le 17$ will be even larger, as they become more central. The smallest dimension for a given $\\lambda_1$ tends to be for partitions of the form $(\\lambda_1, n-\\lambda_1)$ or $(\\lambda_1, 1^{n-\\lambda_1})$. Since $d_{(17,8)}$ and $d_{(17,1^8)}=\\binom{24}{8}=735471$ are both too large, no partitions starting with 17 or less will have dimensions under the limit.\n\n*   **Self-conjugate partitions**: We must check that none of the above partitions are self-conjugate. A quick inspection confirms this (a self-conjugate partition's Young diagram is symmetric, so its first part $\\lambda_1$ must equal its number of parts). Also, none of the listed partitions are conjugates of another one in the list. Thus, each listed partition represents a pair of irreps (one for the partition, one for its conjugate) with the same dimension. Self-conjugate partitions for $n=25$ are very \"central\" and have dimensions far exceeding 500,000. For example, the dimension of the self-conjugate partition $(7,6,5,4,3)$ is over $10^9$.\n\n**Final Count**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   $\\lambda_1=25$: 2\n*   $\\lambda_1=24$: 2\n*   $\\lambda_1=23$: 4\n*   $\\lambda_1=22$: 6\n*   $\\lambda_1=21$: 8\n*   $\\lambda_1=20$: 14\n*   $\\lambda_1=19$: 8\n*   $\\lambda_1=18$: 4\n\nTotal number of irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 14 + 8 + 4 = 48$.\n\n<<<48>>>"
