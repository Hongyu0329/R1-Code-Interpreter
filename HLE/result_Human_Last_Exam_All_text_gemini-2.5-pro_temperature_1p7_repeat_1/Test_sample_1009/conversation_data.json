    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n**1. Understand the Properties of the Group G**\n\nWe are given the following properties for the topological group $G$:\n*   **Topological Group:** The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous.\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover. Crucially, $G$ is not required to be Hausdorff ($T_2$).\n*   **First-Countable:** Every point has a countable local base of neighborhoods. For a topological group, this means the character of the group is $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n*   **Weight ($w(G)$):** We need to find the maximum possible value for the weight of $G$, which is the minimum cardinality of a base for its topology.\n\n**2. Relate Weight to Other Cardinal Invariants**\n\nFor any topological group $G$, there is a fundamental relationship between its weight, character, and density (the minimum cardinality of a dense subset):\n$w(G) = \\chi(G) \\cdot d(G)$.\n\nGiven that $G$ is first-countable, we have $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. The cardinality of $G$ is huge, so it cannot be a discrete space (which would not be compact), meaning its weight and density must be infinite cardinals. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:\n$w(G) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot d(G) = d(G)$.\n\nSo, the problem is now reduced to finding the largest possible density, $d(G)$, of such a group.\n\n**3. Analyze the Hausdorff Quotient of G**\n\nSince $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff, the singleton set containing the identity element, $\\{e\\}$, might not be closed. Let $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ be the closure of the identity. $N$ is a closed (and therefore compact) normal subgroup of $G$.\nWe can form the quotient group $H = G/N$. Let $\\pi: G \\to H$ be the canonical projection map. $H$ has the following properties:\n\n*   **Compact and Hausdorff:** $H$ is a compact topological group. Because we have quotiented out by the closure of the identity, $H$ is a $T_0$ space, and a $T_0$ topological group is always Hausdorff (and even completely regular).\n*   **First-Countable:** The projection map $\\pi: G \\to H$ is continuous, surjective, and open. Because $\\pi$ is an open map, it preserves the character of the group. If $\\{U_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ is a countable local base at $e \\in G$, then $\\{\\pi(U_n)\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ forms a countable local base at the identity of $H$. Thus, $\\chi(H) \\le \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. Since $|G|$ is infinite, $H$ must also be infinite, which implies $\\chi(H) \\ge \\aleph_0$. So, $\\chi(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n**4. Determine the Properties of H**\n\nSo, $H$ is a compact, Hausdorff, first-countable topological group.\n*   A fundamental theorem in general topology states that a compact Hausdorff space is metrizable if and only if it is first-countable. Therefore, $H$ is a metrizable group.\n*   Another key theorem states that any compact metrizable space is separable (i.e., its density is $\\aleph_0$). So, $d(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   For any metrizable space, the weight is equal to the density. Thus, $w(H) = d(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThe Hausdorff quotient group $H$ must be a \"small\" group: a compact metrizable group of weight $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**5. Find an Upper Bound for the Weight of G**\n\nNow we connect the density of $G$ to the weight of its Hausdorff quotient $H$. A deep theorem by D. Shakhmatov states that for any compact group $G$:\n$d(G) \\le 2^{w(G/\\overline{\\{e\\}})} = 2^{w(H)}$.\n\nUsing the result from the previous step ($w(H)=\\aleph_0$), we get:\n$d(G) \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\nSince we established that $w(G) = d(G)$, we have the upper bound:\n$w(G) \\le \\frak c$.\n\n**6. Show that the Upper Bound is Attainable**\n\nTo show that $\\frak c$ is the largest *possible* weight, we must demonstrate that a group satisfying all the given conditions with a weight of $\\frak c$ can exist. We can do this by construction.\n\n1.  **Existence of a base group:** Results in the theory of topological groups (due to Shakhmatov, Malykhin, and others) guarantee the existence of a compact, first-countable (and necessarily non-Hausdorff) group, let's call it $G_1$, such that its weight is $w(G_1) = \\frak c$.\n\n2.  **Cardinality of the base group:** For any compact first-countable group $G_1$, it can be shown that its cardinality is bounded by $|G_1| \\le d(G_1)^{\\chi(G_1)}$. Since $w(G_1)=\\frak c$, we have $d(G_1)=\\frak c$ and $\\chi(G_1)=\\aleph_0$. Thus, $|G_1| \\le \\frak c^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\n3.  **Constructing the final group G:** Let $K$ be any abstract group with cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$. Endow $K$ with the indiscrete topology (where the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $K$). Let's call this topological group $K_{ind}$. $K_{ind}$ is compact and first-countable (in fact, its character is 1). Now, define our group $G$ as the direct product:\n    $G = G_1 \\times K_{ind}$.\n\n4.  **Verify the properties of G:**\n    *   **Topological Group:** The product of two topological groups is a topological group.\n    *   **Compact:** $G$ is the product of two compact spaces ($G_1$ and $K_{ind}$), so it is compact by the Tychonoff theorem.\n    *   **First-Countable:** The character of a product group is the maximum of the characters of its factors. $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(G_1), \\chi(K_{ind})) = \\max(\\aleph_0, 1) = \\aleph_0$. So, $G$ is first-countable.\n    *   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |G_1| \\cdot |K_{ind}|$. Since $1 \\le |G_1| \\le \\frak c$ and $|K_{ind}| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, the product of these cardinal numbers is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n    *   **Weight:** The weight of a product of a non-trivial space and an indiscrete space is the weight of the first space. A base for the topology of $G$ is $\\{U \\times K_{ind} \\mid U \\text{ is in a base for } G_1 \\}$. Therefore, $w(G) = w(G_1) = \\frak c$.\n\nWe have successfully constructed a group $G$ that satisfies all the conditions of the problem and has a weight of $\\frak c$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe weight of the group $G$ is bounded above by $\\frak c$, and this bound is attainable. Therefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\frak c$.\n\n>>>$\\frak c$"
