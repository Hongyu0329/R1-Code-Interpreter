    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the \"rule activation level\" for a fuzzy rule. The rule activation level is also known as the firing strength or firing level. It represents the degree to which the antecedent (the \"IF\" part of the rule) is satisfied.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   **System Type:** \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\". This indicates a very advanced type of fuzzy system. However, the provided values are scalars, which suggests we are dealing with a simplified representation or a specific calculation within that complex framework.\n    *   **Values:** We are given two numerical values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. In the context of calculating a rule's firing strength, these are best interpreted as the membership degrees of two different conditions in the rule's antecedent. For example, for a rule like `IF (input1 is SetA) AND (input2 is SetB) THEN ...`, we would have `μ_SetA(input1) = 0.7` and `μ_SetB(input2) = 0.9`. The unusual notation (`Phi`, `G`, `y_j`) can be confusing, but their roles in this calculation are what matters.\n    *   **Operation:** The problem specifies using a \"t-norm operation\". A t-norm is a function that models the fuzzy logical `AND`. It combines multiple membership values into a single value.\n\n3.  **Choose the Correct t-norm:**\n    *   The question does not specify which t-norm to use (e.g., minimum, product, Łukasiewicz).\n    *   In fuzzy logic, when a t-norm is not explicitly defined, the most common and standard choice is the **minimum operator** (`min`). It represents the intersection of fuzzy sets and corresponds to Zadeh's original definition of the fuzzy `AND`.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   The rule activation level is calculated by applying the chosen t-norm to the antecedent's membership degrees.\n    *   Antecedent membership degrees are `0.7` and `0.9`.\n    *   Applying the minimum t-norm:\n        `Activation Level = T(0.7, 0.9) = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   The result of `min(0.7, 0.9)` is `0.7`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Interpretation of Terminology:** The most critical step is interpreting the question correctly. The term \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\" can be misleading. An actual calculation for an IT3 FLS would be vastly more complex and would not result in a single scalar value. Therefore, it's logical to assume this is a fundamental fuzzy logic problem presented with advanced terminology.\n*   **Role of Inputs:** The rule activation level depends only on the antecedent (`IF` part). The given values `0.7` and `0.9` must both belong to the antecedent for the `t-norm` to be applicable for finding the *single* activation level for the rule.\n*   **Choice of Operator:** The selection of the `min` operator as the default t-norm is a standard convention in fuzzy systems theory and applications unless another operator is explicitly required.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the rule activation level is the result of combining the antecedent membership grades (`0.7` and `0.9`) using the standard minimum t-norm.\n\n**Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7**\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
