    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one has the same ending leg position as the starting position.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   The question is about the final position of the legs/feet relative to the starting position (e.g., if you start with the right foot in front in fifth position, do you end with the right foot in front in fifth position?).\n*   The names of ballet steps often contain clues. Terms like `changé` (changed) are very important.\n*   The standard execution of a step according to major ballet methodologies (like Vaganova, Cecchetti, French School) is the basis for the correct answer.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n*   **Execution:** `Entrechat` means \"interweaving\" or \"braiding.\" The number `six` refers to the number of movements or crossings of the legs in the air. All even-numbered entrechats (`quatre`, `six`, `huit`, etc.) are defined by the fact that they land back in the original starting position on two feet. An `entrechat six` involves jumping vertically, executing three full crossings of the legs, and landing.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in the exact same fifth position they started from (e.g., right foot in front).\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are the same.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n*   **Execution:**\n    *   `Échappé`: To escape. The feet jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open position (second or fourth).\n    *   `Battu`: Beaten. As the legs close back to fifth, they beat together.\n    *   `Changé`: Changed. This is the key term. It explicitly states that the feet will land in the opposite fifth position from where they started.\n*   **Ending Position:** If the dancer started with the right foot in front, they will land with the left foot in front.\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position.\n*   **Execution:** `Assemblé` means \"to assemble\" or \"join together.\" The working leg brushes away from the body, the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and both legs are brought together (\"assembled\") in the air before landing simultaneously in fifth position. In a standard `assemblé`, the working leg that was in the back will land in the front (e.g., `assemblé dessus`), or the front leg will land in the back (e.g., `assemblé dessous`). In either common case, the feet change position.\n*   **Ending Position:** The fifth position is achieved, but with the opposite foot in front.\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n*   **Execution:** `Glissade` means \"to glide.\" `Derrière` means \"behind.\" In this step, the front foot glides to the side, and the other foot closes to fifth position *behind* the first foot. This action causes the foot that was originally in back to now be in front.\n*   **Ending Position:** If the dancer started with the right foot in front, the execution results in the left foot finishing in front.\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically fifth position.\n*   **Execution:** A `gargouillade` (meaning \"gurgling\") is a complex decorative step. It is essentially a `pas de chat` where each leg performs a `rond de jambe en l'air` during the jump. Like a `pas de chat`, the dancer jumps from one foot to the other, traveling and typically changing the feet in the process.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in the opposite fifth position.\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nAfter analyzing all the options, the only step that is defined by returning to its original starting position is the **Entrechat six**. Even-numbered entrechats are designed to finish in the same position from which they began.\n\n<<<A>>>"
