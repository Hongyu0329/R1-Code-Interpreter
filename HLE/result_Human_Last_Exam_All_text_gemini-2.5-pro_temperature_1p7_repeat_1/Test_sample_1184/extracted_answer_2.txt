Based on extensive structural and functional data, here are the key residues for the human beta-1 subunit (CACNB1) interacting with the human alpha-1 (CaV2.3) subunit. The numbering corresponds to the canonical human beta-1 sequence (UniProt: P54289).

**1) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues are located in the Beta Interaction Domain (BID), a pocket formed by the SH3 and GK domains.

*   **From the GK-like Domain (making critical hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding contacts):**
    *   **Aspartate-356 (D356):** Forms a hydrogen bond with the AID.
    *   **Tryptophan-361 (W361):** Provides a key hydrophobic contact with the AID.
    *   **Tyrosine-392 (Y392):** Forms a crucial hydrogen bond with the AID; its mutation severely disrupts binding.
    *   **Valine-439 (V439), Leucine-442 (L442), Methionine-446 (M446):** Contribute to the formation of the hydrophobic binding pocket.

*   **From the SH3 Domain (making important electrostatic and structural contacts):**
    *   **Glutamate-211 (E211):** Forms electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) with the AID.
    *   **Aspartate-256 (D256):** Forms electrostatic interactions with the AID.
    *   **Valine-258 (V258):** Contributes to the shape of the binding groove.

**2) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit:**

The primary mechanism for gating modulation is the high-affinity binding event itself. Therefore, the same BID residues listed above are the most critical hotspots for the major modulatory effects (e.g., shifting voltage dependence, promoting surface expression).

*   **Primary Hotspots (core modulation via binding):**
    *   All residues listed in question 1, especially **Y392**, **W361**, **E211**, and **D256**, as their interaction is what initiates the allosteric change in the alpha-1 subunit.

*   **Secondary Hotspots (for fine-tuning kinetics):**
    *   **The variable N-terminus (residues ~1-50):** This region is known to contribute to isoform-specific modulation of channel kinetics, such as the rates of activation and inactivation. The exact key residues are less defined than in the BID.
    *   **The variable "Hook" loop region (residues ~80-150):** This loop connects the N-terminus to the conserved SH3 domain and can influence voltage-dependent inactivation properties.
