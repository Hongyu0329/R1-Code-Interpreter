    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Interpret the Question\n\nThe question asks for the upper bound for a quantity called the \"maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$\" in terms of the \"covolume $(V)$\". This relationship is to be considered for a specific context defined by \"squarefree natural numbers $(N)$\".\n\n*   **Squarefree Natural Numbers (N):** This specifies the context. In number theory, squarefree integers are used to define quadratic number fields, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is a squarefree integer. We can relate $N$ to $D$ by considering both real ($D=N$) and imaginary ($D=-N$) quadratic fields. Lattices can be naturally constructed from the rings of integers of these fields.\n\n*   **Covolume (V):** This is a term from the geometry of numbers, referring to the volume of the fundamental domain of a lattice $\\Lambda$. It is also called the determinant of the lattice, $\\det(\\Lambda)$. For a lattice constructed from the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of a number field $K$ with discriminant $\\Delta_K$, the covolume is related to $\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$.\n\n*   **Maximum Norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$:** This notation is non-standard, but it can be logically parsed.\n    *   The subscript $\\infty$ strongly suggests the $L_\\infty$ norm (or max norm), where for a vector $x = (x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, $\\|x\\|_\\infty = \\max_{i} |x_i|$.\n    *   In the context of lattice theory, \"norm\" often relates to the lengths of vectors. Important invariants are the successive minima of a lattice, denoted $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_n$.\n    *   $\\lambda_k$ is the smallest radius $\\lambda$ such that a ball of radius $\\lambda$ (in the given norm) contains at least $k$ linearly independent lattice vectors.\n    *   \"Maximum norm\" most plausibly refers to the largest of these successive minima, $\\lambda_n$. For quadratic fields, the degree is $n=2$, so we are interested in $\\lambda_2$.\n    *   The notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ is thus interpreted as $\\lambda_{2, \\infty}$, the second successive minimum of the lattice with respect to the $L_\\infty$ norm.\n\nSo, the reformulated question is: **For lattices associated with quadratic number fields $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$ (where $D$ is a positive or negative squarefree integer), what is the upper bound on the second successive minimum $\\lambda_2$ in terms of the covolume $V$?**\n\n### Step 2: Apply Relevant Mathematical Theory\n\nThe primary tool for relating successive minima and the covolume is **Minkowski's Second Theorem on Successive Minima**. For a lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ with covolume $V$, the successive minima $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$ with respect to the $L_\\infty$ norm satisfy:\n$$ \\frac{V}{2} \\le \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\le V $$\nThis gives an upper bound on the product $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2$. To find a bound for $\\lambda_2$ alone, we need information about $\\lambda_1$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Lattices from Real Quadratic Fields ($K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$)\n\n1.  **Lattice Construction:** The ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is embedded into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ via the canonical map $\\sigma: \\alpha \\mapsto (\\sigma_1(\\alpha), \\sigma_2(\\alpha))$, where $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2$ are the two embeddings of $K$ into $\\mathbb{R}$. This creates a lattice $\\Lambda$.\n2.  **Covolume:** The covolume of this lattice is $V = \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$.\n3.  **Analysis of $\\lambda_1$:**\n    *   Any non-zero algebraic integer $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ has a field norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha) = \\sigma_1(\\alpha)\\sigma_2(\\alpha)$ which is a non-zero rational integer. Thus, $|\\sigma_1(\\alpha)\\sigma_2(\\alpha)| \\ge 1$.\n    *   Let $v = \\sigma(\\alpha)$ be a vector in the lattice, and let its $L_\\infty$ norm be $\\lambda = \\|v\\|_\\infty = \\max(|\\sigma_1(\\alpha)|, |\\sigma_2(\\alpha)|)$.\n    *   Then $1 \\le |\\sigma_1(\\alpha)\\sigma_2(\\alpha)| \\le \\|v\\|_\\infty^2 = \\lambda^2$. This implies that any non-zero vector in the lattice has a norm $\\lambda \\ge 1$. Therefore, the first minimum $\\lambda_1 \\ge 1$.\n    *   Simultaneously, the number $1$ is always in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. Its image is $\\sigma(1) = (1,1)$, which has an $L_\\infty$ norm of 1.\n    *   Since $\\lambda_1$ is the minimum norm, we must have $\\lambda_1 \\le 1$.\n    *   Combining these, we find a crucial property of these specific lattices: **$\\lambda_1 = 1$**.\n4.  **Bound on $\\lambda_2$:** Substituting $\\lambda_1=1$ into Minkowski's inequality gives:\n    $$ \\frac{V}{2} \\le 1 \\cdot \\lambda_2 \\le V $$\n    This yields the upper bound $\\lambda_2 \\le V$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Lattices from Imaginary Quadratic Fields ($K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$)\n\nTo ensure the derived bound is the best possible, we check the other case defined by squarefree numbers.\n\n1.  **Lattice Construction:** The ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is embedded into $\\mathbb{C} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n2.  **Analysis of a specific case:** Consider $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$ where $-N \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod 4$. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-N}]$. The lattice $\\Lambda$ is generated by the vectors $(1,0)$ and $(0, \\sqrt{N})$.\n3.  **Covolume:** The covolume is the area of the rectangle formed by the basis vectors, so $V = \\sqrt{N}$.\n4.  **Successive Minima:**\n    *   The shortest non-zero vectors are $(\\pm 1, 0)$, with $L_\\infty$ norm of 1. So, $\\lambda_1 = 1$.\n    *   The shortest vector that is linearly independent of $(1,0)$ is $(0, \\pm \\sqrt{N})$, with $L_\\infty$ norm of $\\sqrt{N}$.\n    *   The two vectors $(1,0)$ and $(0, \\sqrt{N})$ are linearly independent. The smallest square centered at the origin containing them both is $[-\\sqrt{N}, \\sqrt{N}] \\times [-\\sqrt{N}, \\sqrt{N}]$. Thus, $\\lambda_2 = \\sqrt{N}$.\n5.  **Bound on $\\lambda_2$:** In this case, we find $\\lambda_2 = V$. This demonstrates that the inequality $\\lambda_2 \\le V$ is **tight**; it cannot be improved to $\\lambda_2 \\le C \\cdot V$ for any constant $C<1$. A similar analysis for the case $-N \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$ also leads to the conclusion that $\\lambda_2=V$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the analysis of both real and imaginary quadratic fields, we see that the inequality $\\lambda_2 \\le V$ holds true in all cases. Furthermore, the equality $\\lambda_2 = V$ is achieved for the entire family of lattices derived from imaginary quadratic fields. Therefore, the sharpest possible upper bound for the \"maximum norm\" $(\\lambda_2)$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ is $V$ itself.\n\nThe upper bound for $k_{k,\\infty}$ is $V$.\n\n<<<V>>>"
