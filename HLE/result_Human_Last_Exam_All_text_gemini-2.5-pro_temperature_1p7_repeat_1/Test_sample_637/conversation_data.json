    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the deadbeat observer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to design a full-state observer for the given discrete-time system such that the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` becomes identically zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This type of observer is known as a deadbeat observer.\n\nThe system is defined by:\n`x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\nwith matrices:\n`A = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]`\n`B = [[0], [1], [-1], [1]]`\n`C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThe observer dynamics are:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - Cx_hat(k))`\nwhere `L` is the observer gain matrix to be designed.\n\nThe error dynamics are derived as:\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\nFor the error to become zero after a finite number of steps `p`, the matrix `(A - LC)` must be nilpotent, i.e., `(A - LC)^p = 0`. The shortest possible number of steps `p` is the observability index of the system `(A, C)`.\n\n### Step 2: Check System Observability\nBefore designing the observer, we must confirm that the system is observable. A system is observable if the observability matrix `O` has full rank, which is `n=4` in this case.\nThe observability matrix `O` is given by `O = [C; CA; CA^2; ..., CA^(n-1)]`.\nLet's compute the necessary terms.\n\n*   `C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n*   `CA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`\n*   `A^2 = A * A = [[-2, 0, 1, 0], [-3, 0, 2, -1], [2, 0, -1, 3], [0, 1, -1, 1]]`\n*   `CA^2 = C * A^2 = [[-2, 0, 1, 0], [-2, 1, 0, 1]]`\n\nLet's form the observability matrix up to the `v-1` power of A and check its rank. The state dimension `n=4`.\n`O_1 = [C; CA] = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`. This 4x4 matrix has a rank of 3.\n`O_2 = [C; CA; CA^2] = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0], [-2, 0, 1, 0], [-2, 1, 0, 1]]`.\nThe rows `r1 = [1,0,0,0]`, `r2 = [1,0,0,1]`, `r4 = [-2,0,1,0]`, and `r6 = [-2,1,0,1]` of `O_2` are linearly independent. The determinant of the matrix formed by these rows is non-zero, confirming that `rank(O_2) = 4`.\n\nSince the rank is `n=4`, the system is observable. The observability index `v_o` is the smallest integer `k` for which `rank(O_{k-1}) = n`. Here, `rank(O_1)=3` and `rank(O_2)=4=n`, so the observability index is `v_o = 3`.\n\n### Step 3: Deadbeat Observer Design\nThe error must be zero in the shortest possible time, which is the observability index `v_o = 3`. This requires that the error transition matrix `A_c = A - LC` satisfies `(A_c)^3 = 0`. This implies that `A_c` must be nilpotent. For this to hold, all eigenvalues of `A_c` must be zero. Thus, the characteristic polynomial of `A_c` must be `det(λI - A_c) = λ^4`.\n\nWe will find a gain matrix `L` that makes `A_c` nilpotent with an index of 3. One way to ensure nilpotency is to make `A_c` a strictly lower triangular matrix.\n\nLet `L` be a 4x2 matrix:\n`L = [[l11, l12], [l21, l22], [l31, l32], [l41, l42]]`\n\nThe product `LC` is:\n`LC = L * C = [[l11, l12], [l21, l22], [l31, l32], [l41, l42]] * [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] = [[l11+l12, 0, 0, l12], [l21+l22, 0, 0, l22], [l31+l32, 0, 0, l32], [l41+l42, 0, 0, l42]]`\n\nNow, `A_c = A - LC`:\n`A_c = [[-1-(l11+l12), 0, 0, 1-l12], [1-(l21+l22), 0, 0, 2-l22], [-(l31+l32), 1, 0, -1-l32], [-1-(l41+l42), 0, 1, -1-l42]]`\n\nTo achieve nilpotency index 3, we can design `L` such that `A_c^3=0` and `A_c^2 != 0`. We can do this by setting some elements of `A_c` to zero.\nLet's try to make the first two rows of `A_c` zero vectors.\nFor row 1 of `A_c` to be zero:\n`-1-(l11+l12) = 0  => l11+l12 = -1`\n`1-l12 = 0 => l12 = 1`\nSubstituting `l12=1` into the first equation gives `l11+1 = -1 => l11 = -2`.\n\nFor row 2 of `A_c` to be zero:\n`1-(l21+l22) = 0 => l21+l22 = 1`\n`2-l22 = 0 => l22 = 2`\nSubstituting `l22=2` into the first equation gives `l21+2 = 1 => l21 = -1`.\n\nSo far, we have `l11=-2, l12=1, l21=-1, l22=2`.\nLet's simplify by choosing the remaining elements `l31, l32, l41, l42` to be zero, except where needed.\nLet `l31=0, l32=-1, l41=0, l42=-1`. This choice makes `A_c` simpler. Let's see the resulting `A_c` matrix.\n`L = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]`.\n\nLet's compute the elements of `A_c` using this `L`:\n`l11+l12 = -1`, `l12 = 1` => Row 1 is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`\n`l21+l22 = 1`, `l22 = 2` => Row 2 is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`\n`l31+l32 = -1`, `l32 = -1` => Row 3 is `[-(-1), 1, 0, -1-(-1)] = [1, 1, 0, 0]`\n`l41+l42 = -1`, `l42 = -1` => Row 4 is `[-(-1), 0, 1, -1-(-1)] = [1, 0, 1, 0]`\n\nSo, the resulting `A_c` matrix is:\n`A_c = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 0]]`\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Nilpotency Index\nNow we check the powers of `A_c`.\n`A_c^2 = A_c * A_c = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[1,0,1,0]] * [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[1,0,1,0]]`\n`A_c^2 = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]`\n`A_c^2` is not the zero matrix.\n\n`A_c^3 = A_c^2 * A_c = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0]] * [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[1,0,1,0]]`\n`A_c^3 = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]`\n`A_c^3` is the zero matrix.\n\nSince `(A-LC)^2 ≠ 0` and `(A-LC)^3 = 0`, the nilpotency index is 3. This matches the observability index, so the error will converge to zero in the shortest possible time of 3 steps.\nThe calculated gain matrix `L` is a valid solution.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe gain matrix `L` for the deadbeat observer is:\n`L = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]`\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
