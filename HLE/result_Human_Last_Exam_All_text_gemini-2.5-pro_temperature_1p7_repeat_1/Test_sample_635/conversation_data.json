    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Goal:** We want to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$, which means we need to find matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ such that $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, where $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are polynomial matrices and are left coprime.\n\n2.  **Definition of Left Coprime Factorization:** The equation is $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, which can be rewritten as $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. Here, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ must be polynomial matrices. For them to be left coprime, the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ must have full row rank for all complex numbers $s$. A sufficient condition is to check this at the roots of $\\det(D(s))=0$. The poles of the system $H(s)$ are the zeros of $\\det(D(s))$.\n\n3.  **Setup the Equation:**\n    Let $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$ and $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n    The equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$ becomes:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11} & d_{12} \\\\ d_{21} & d_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11} & n_{12} \\\\ n_{21} & n_{22} \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n4.  **Conditions for N(s) to be Polynomial:**\n    For $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, its entries must be polynomials.\n    *   From the second column of the product, we must have $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ and $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$. This implies $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials.\n    *   For the first column, the entries must be polynomials. Let's write them with a common denominator $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$:\n        *   $n_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$. This requires the numerator $d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$ to be divisible by $s^2-1$.\n        *   $n_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}$. This requires the numerator $d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$ to be divisible by $s^2-1$.\n\n5.  **Finding the Entries of D(s):**\n    Let's analyze the divisibility conditions.\n    For $d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$ to be divisible by $(s-1)(s+1)$:\n    *   At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$. Thus, $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n    *   At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n\n    Let's try to find simple polynomials for the first row of $D(s)$ that satisfy these conditions.\n    Let $d_{11}(s) = 1$ (a constant polynomial). The condition $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$ becomes $2(1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$, so $d_{12}(-1) = -2$.\n    We also need $d_{12}(1) = 0$.\n    Let's try a linear polynomial for $d_{12}(s) = as+b$.\n    $d_{12}(1) = a+b=0 \\implies b=-a$.\n    $d_{12}(-1) = -a+b = -a-a = -2a = -2 \\implies a=1$.\n    So, $b=-1$. This gives $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\n    Let's try this for the first row of $D(s)$: $d_{11}(s)=1, d_{12}(s)=s-1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the First Row of N(s):**\n    With $d_{11}=1$ and $d_{12}=s-1$:\n    $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) = 1$.\n    $n_{11}(s) = \\frac{1 \\cdot (s-1)^2 + 2(s-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)[(s-1)+2]}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = 1$.\n    So, the first row of $N(s)$ is $[1 \\quad 1]$.\n\n7.  **Find the Second Row of D(s):**\n    Now consider the second row: $d_{21}(s)$ and $d_{22}(s)$.\n    The system poles are the roots of $\\det(D(s))$. The poles of $H(s)$ are at $s=1$ and $s=-1$. So we expect $\\det(D(s)) = k(s^2-1)$ for some non-zero constant $k$.\n    $\\det(D(s)) = d_{11}d_{22} - d_{12}d_{21} = 1 \\cdot d_{22}(s) - (s-1)d_{21}(s)$.\n    So we need $d_{22}(s) - (s-1)d_{21}(s) = k(s^2-1)$.\n    Also, $d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$ must be divisible by $s^2-1$.\n    \n    Let's try simple choices. What if we set $d_{21}(s) = 0$?\n    Then $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) = 0$.\n    The condition on $\\det(D(s))$ becomes $d_{22}(s) = k(s^2-1)$. Let's choose $k=1$, so $d_{22}(s) = s^2-1$.\n    Now check the divisibility for $n_{21}(s)$:\n    $d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s) = 0 \\cdot (s-1)^2 + 2(s^2-1) = 2(s^2-1)$.\n    This is divisible by $s^2-1$.\n    $n_{21}(s) = \\frac{2(s^2-1)}{s^2-1} = 2$.\n    \n    So, we have a candidate solution:\n    $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n8.  **Verify the Factorization and Coprimeness:**\n    First, check if $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$.\n    \\[\n    D(s)H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1\\cdot\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 1\\cdot 1 + (s-1)\\cdot 0 \\\\ 0\\cdot\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s^2-1)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0\\cdot 1 + (s^2-1)\\cdot 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s+1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = N(s)\n    \\]\n    The factorization is correct.\n    \n    Next, check for left coprimeness. We need to check if the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is 2 for all $s$. It is sufficient to check at the roots of $\\det(D(s))=s^2-1=0$, which are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    $[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n    *   At $s=1$:\n        $[D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. The two rows are linearly independent, so the rank is 2.\n    *   At $s=-1$:\n        $[D(-1) \\quad N(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. The two rows are linearly independent, so the rank is 2.\n\n    Since the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank at the roots of $\\det(D(s))$, the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe left coprime factorization is $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ where:\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}, N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
