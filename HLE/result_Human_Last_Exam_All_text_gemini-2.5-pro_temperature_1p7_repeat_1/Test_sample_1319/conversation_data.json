    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical mountains mentioned by name in the *Iliad*.**\n\nThe first step is to carefully comb through the text of the *Iliad* to find all explicit mentions of real, geographical mountains. It's crucial to stick only to the *Iliad* and not the broader world of Greek mythology or other texts like the *Odyssey* or the *Homeric Hymns*.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** This is the most frequently mentioned mountain, serving as the home of the gods. Its peak is in Greece. It is the tallest mountain in Greece and the one we must exclude from the final answer.\n*   **Mount Ida:** There are two famous Mount Idas in the ancient world (one on Crete, one near Troy). The *Iliad* refers to the one near Troy, in Phrygia (modern-day Turkey). Zeus famously watches the Trojan War from its highest peak, Gargarus. (e.g., *Iliad*, Book 8).\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** Poseidon watches the battle from \"the topmost peak of wooded Samothrace\". The island of Samothrace has a prominent mountain, now called Mount Fengari. (e.g., *Iliad*, Book 13).\n*   **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly, Greece, is mentioned as the source of the giant ash-wood spear given to Achilles' father, Peleus, by the centaur Chiron. (e.g., *Iliad*, Book 16).\n*   **Mount Athos:** This mountain is located on a peninsula in northeastern Greece. It is mentioned by name when the goddess Hera flies from Olympus to Lemnos to deceive Zeus. The epic states she \"set foot on Athos, and so came upon the swelling sea...\". (e.g., *Iliad*, Book 14).\n\n**Careful Point:** Some mountains, like Mount Tmolus or Mount Parnassus, are prominent in Greek mythology but are not actually mentioned in the text of the *Iliad*. Therefore, they must be excluded from our analysis.\n\n**Step 2: List the modern elevations of the identified mountains.**\n\nNow we must find the established heights of these real-world mountains to compare them.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** approx. 2,918 meters (9,573 feet)\n*   **Mount Athos:** approx. 2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** approx. 1,774 meters (5,820 feet)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** approx. 1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Mount Fengari):** approx. 1,611 meters (5,285 feet)\n\n**Step 3: Compare the elevations and determine the tallest after Mount Olympus.**\n\nThe question asks for the tallest mountain *after* Mount Olympus. We can now rank the remaining mountains by height:\n\n1.  **Mount Athos** - 2,033 m\n2.  **Mount Ida** - 1,774 m\n3.  **Mount Pelion** - 1,624 m\n4.  **Mount Samothrace** - 1,611 m\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned by name in the *Iliad* is Mount Athos.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
