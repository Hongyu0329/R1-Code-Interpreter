    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** Mycology (the study of mushrooms/fungi).\n    *   **Key Phrase:** \"distinctly blue spore print\". A spore print's color is a primary characteristic for identifying mushroom species.\n    *   **Constraint:** \"a single genus\". This implies that this trait is extremely rare and points to one specific group.\n    *   **Subject Type:** \"mushroom\". This term usually refers to the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground and consisting of a stipe (stem) and a pileus (cap).\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination of Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   **Are there blue mushrooms?** Yes, many. For example, *Lactarius indigo* is a vibrant blue. However, the color of the mushroom's body is different from its spore print color. *Lactarius indigo*'s spore print is cream to pale yellow.\n    *   **What about the New Zealand blue mushroom?** This is *Entoloma hochstetteri*. It is famously and vividly blue. However, the genus *Entoloma* is characterized by its pink, angular spores. So its spore print is pink, not blue.\n    *   **What about mushrooms that bruise blue?** Many species in the genera *Psilocybe* and *Boletus* turn blue when handled or damaged. This is due to a chemical reaction (oxidation of psilocin/psilocybin or other compounds). It has no relation to the spore print color. *Psilocybe* mushrooms have a purple-brown to black spore print, and boletes have shades of olive or brown.\n    *   From this, we can conclude that the answer is not one of the more commonly known blue-colored or blue-staining mushrooms. We must look for a genus specifically noted for the color of its spores in mass.\n\n3.  **Researching Rare Spore Colors:**\n    *   Standard spore print colors include white, cream, yellow, pink, various shades of brown (ochre, rusty, chocolate), purple-brown, and black. Green is very rare (*Chlorophyllum molybdites*). Blue is even more exceptional.\n    *   Searching for a genus with a verified blue spore print leads to a very specific and less common group of fungi.\n    *   One candidate is the species *Rugosomyces ionides* (formerly known as *Calocybe ionides*). Mycological sources and field guides note this mushroom for its unusual spore print, describing it as white at first but developing pale grayish-lilac, lavender, or faint bluish tones in a thick deposit. This lavender-blue color fits the description \"distinctly blue\". As this characteristic is known for this species, the genus *Rugosomyces* is the answer.\n\n4.  **Considering Alternate Interpretations:**\n    *   Could \"mushroom\" refer to non-gilled fungi? Yes, in a broader mycological sense. The cobalt crust fungus (*Terana caerulea* or *Pulcherricium caeruleum*) is a brilliant blue crust fungus whose spores are noted to be pale blue. However, crust fungi are not what people typically mean when they say \"mushroom.\" The question's framing suggests a more traditional mushroom shape (cap and stem). Therefore, *Rugosomyces* remains the most appropriate answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Mushroom Body Color vs. Spore Print Color:** It is crucial not to confuse the color of the mushroom itself with the color of its spores. They are often different.\n*   **Bruising Reaction vs. Spore Print Color:** The blue staining reaction seen in some mushrooms is also a separate characteristic from the spore print color.\n*   **Specificity of \"Blue\":** The spore print of *Rugosomyces ionides* is more accurately described as lilac or lavender-blue. In the context of spore prints, where true blue is virtually non-existent, this qualifies as \"distinctly blue\".\n*   **Rarity:** The existence of a single genus with this trait highlights how rare it is, making it a piece of mycological trivia.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter eliminating common misconceptions related to blue mushrooms, the evidence points to a specific genus known for this rare trait. While other fungi may have blue coloration in their structure or spores (like crust fungi), the genus *Rugosomyces* is the established answer for a gilled mushroom producing a spore print that can be described as distinctly blueish or lavender-blue.\n\n<<<Rugosomyces>>>"
