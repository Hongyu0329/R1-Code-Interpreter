    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health:** The first step is to determine the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode. By examining Terraria's source code, specifically the `SetDefaults` method for the Eye of Cthulhu (NPC ID 4), we can find its stats. For Expert Mode, the game sets the boss's base health to **3,640 HP**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Player Scaling Formula:** In Terraria, boss health increases with the number of players in a world. For Expert Mode, the source code applies a specific health multiplier based on the player count. The formula for this health scaling is:\n    `Health Multiplier = 1 + 0.35 * (n - 1)`\n    where `n` is the number of players.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Complete Health Equation:** By combining the base health with the scaling multiplier, we can write a general formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode for `n` players:\n    `Total Health = Base Health * Health Multiplier`\n    `Total Health(n) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (n - 1))`\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. This is a mathematical limit problem. We need to evaluate the formula as `n` approaches infinity.\n    `lim (n → ∞) [3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (n - 1))]`\n    As `n` becomes infinitely large, the term `(n-1)` also becomes infinitely large. This means the entire expression evaluates to infinity.\n\n5.  **Consider Technical Limitations from the Source Code:** This is the critical part of the analysis. The question specifies that the answer must be \"according to the source code\". In the game's code, all NPC health values (both current `life` and maximum `lifeMax`) are stored as 32-bit signed integer variables (`int` in C#).\n\n6.  **Determine the Data Type's Maximum Value:** A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum possible value. This value is 2^31 - 1, which equals **2,147,483,647**. Any attempt to store a number larger than this in an `int` variable will result in an overflow, and the variable cannot represent the higher value. In the context of the game's engine, this is the absolute ceiling for the NPC's health.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAlthough the mathematical formula for health with infinite players tends to infinity, the game's implementation has a hard limit. The \"infinite players\" scenario ensures that the calculated health will surpass any practical number and reach this technical boundary. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu, as constrained by the source code, is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
