    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Basic Structure\n\nA category consists of objects and morphisms. Let our two objects be `A` and `B`.\nA category must satisfy several axioms, including:\n1.  For every object `X`, there exists an identity morphism `id_X : X → X`.\n2.  Morphisms can be composed associatively.\n\nGiven two objects `A` and `B`, there are four sets of morphisms (hom-sets):\n*   `Hom(A, A)`: Morphisms from A to A.\n*   `Hom(A, B)`: Morphisms from A to B.\n*   `Hom(B, A)`: Morphisms from B to A.\n*   `Hom(B, B)`: Morphisms from B to B.\n\nThe problem states we have a total of 4 morphisms. Due to the identity axiom, we must have at least one morphism in `Hom(A, A)` (which is `id_A`) and at least one in `Hom(B, B)` (which is `id_B`). These are two distinct morphisms.\n\nThis leaves us with `4 - 2 = 2` non-identity morphisms to distribute among the four hom-sets.\n\n### Step 2: Enumerate the Possible Distributions of Morphisms\n\nLet `n_AA`, `n_AB`, `n_BA`, `n_BB` be the number of morphisms in `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)` respectively. We know `n_AA ≥ 1`, `n_BB ≥ 1`, and the sum `n_AA + n_AB + n_BA + n_BB = 4`.\n\nThis is equivalent to distributing the 2 non-identity morphisms. We can list the possible distributions as tuples `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)`:\n\n1.  **Both non-identity morphisms in one hom-set:**\n    *   ` (3, 0, 0, 1) `: Both in `Hom(A, A)`.\n    *   ` (1, 2, 0, 1) `: Both in `Hom(A, B)`.\n    *   ` (1, 0, 2, 1) `: Both in `Hom(B, A)`.\n    *   ` (1, 0, 0, 3) `: Both in `Hom(B, B)`.\n\n2.  **The two non-identity morphisms in different hom-sets:**\n    *   ` (2, 1, 0, 1) `\n    *   ` (2, 0, 1, 1) `\n    *   ` (2, 0, 0, 2) `\n    *   ` (1, 1, 1, 1) `\n    *   ` (1, 1, 0, 2) `\n    *   ` (1, 0, 1, 2) `\n\nThis gives a total of 10 possible distributions for the number of morphisms.\n\n### Step 3: Group Distributions by Isomorphism\n\nTwo categories are isomorphic if they are structurally the same, which can include swapping the roles of objects A and B. A category with distribution `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)` can be isomorphic to a category with distribution `(n_BB, n_BA, n_AB, n_AA)` just by swapping the objects `A` and `B`. We can use this to group our 10 distributions, reducing the number of cases to analyze.\n\n*   **Group 1:** `(3, 0, 0, 1)` is dual to `(1, 0, 0, 3)`. We only need to analyze one.\n*   **Group 2:** `(1, 2, 0, 1)` is dual to `(1, 0, 2, 1)`. We only need to analyze one.\n*   **Group 3:** `(2, 1, 0, 1)` is dual to `(1, 1, 0, 2)`.\n*   **Group 4:** `(2, 0, 1, 1)` is dual to `(1, 0, 1, 2)`.\n*   **Group 5:** `(2, 0, 0, 2)` is its own dual (symmetric).\n*   **Group 6:** `(1, 1, 1, 1)` is its own dual (symmetric).\n\nThis leaves us with 6 unique structural types to analyze.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Composition Rules for Each Structural Type\n\nFor each group, we must define the composition law and count the number of non-isomorphic categories that can be formed.\n\n*   **Case 1: `(3, 0, 0, 1)`**\n    *   `Hom(A,A) = {id_A, f, g}`, `Hom(B,B) = {id_B}`. The other hom-sets are empty.\n    *   This structure is a disjoint union of a category on `A` and a category on `B`. The category on `A` is a monoid (a category with one object) of order 3.\n    *   There are exactly **5** non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    *   **Count: 5**\n\n*   **Case 2: `(1, 2, 0, 1)`**\n    *   `Hom(A,B) = {f, g}`. All other non-identity morphisms are absent.\n    *   There are no non-trivial compositions possible (e.g., `f∘h` requires `h` to end at `A`, but `Hom(X, A)` is empty for non-identity `h`).\n    *   The structure is completely determined: two parallel arrows from A to B. Renaming `f` and `g` does not change the category's structure.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **Case 3: `(2, 1, 0, 1)` and `(1, 0, 1, 2)` and their duals**\n    *   Let's analyze `(2, 1, 0, 1)`. `Hom(A,A)={id_A, f}`, `Hom(A,B)={g}`.\n    *   We must define composition for `f∘f` and `g∘f`.\n        *   `f∘f` must be a morphism `A→A`, so `f∘f = id_A` or `f∘f = f`.\n        *   `g∘f` must be a morphism `A→B`, so `g∘f = g`.\n    *   The two choices for `f∘f` (`f` is an involution vs. `f` is idempotent) lead to two distinct, non-isomorphic categories.\n    *   The dual case `(1, 0, 1, 2)` gives categories that are isomorphic to these two (by swapping A and B).\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Case 4: `(2, 0, 1, 1)` and `(1, 1, 0, 2)` and their duals**\n    *   Let's analyze `(2, 0, 1, 1)`. `Hom(A,A)={id_A, f}`, `Hom(B,A)={g}`.\n    *   We must define composition for `f∘f` and `f∘g`.\n        *   `f∘f` must be `id_A` or `f`.\n        *   `f∘g` must be a morphism `B→A`, so `f∘g = g`.\n    *   Again, this gives two non-isomorphic categories. These are structurally different from the categories in Case 3 (the \"action\" of the `A→A` morphism is on a `B→A` morphism, not an `A→B` one).\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Case 5: `(2, 0, 0, 2)`**\n    *   `Hom(A,A)={id_A, f}`, `Hom(B,B)={id_B, g}`.\n    *   This is a disjoint union of two monoids of order 2. A monoid of order 2 can be `{id, x}` with `x²=id` (the group Z₂) or `x²=x` (idempotent).\n    *   We can have three combinations up to isomorphism (by swapping A and B):\n        1. Both monoids are of type Z₂.\n        2. Both monoids are of the idempotent type.\n        3. One is Z₂ and one is idempotent. (`(Z₂, idempotent)` is isomorphic to `(idempotent, Z₂)`).\n    *   **Count: 3**\n\n*   **Case 6: `(1, 1, 1, 1)`**\n    *   `Hom(A,B)={f}`, `Hom(B,A)={g}`.\n    *   For composition to be associative and satisfy identity laws, we are forced to define:\n        *   `g∘f : A → A`, so `g∘f = id_A`.\n        *   `f∘g : B → B`, so `f∘g = id_B`.\n    *   This uniquely defines a category where the objects A and B are isomorphic.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n### Step 5: Final Tally\n\nSumming the counts from each unique case:\n*   From Case 1 (`(3,0,0,1)`): 5 categories\n*   From Case 2 (`(1,2,0,1)`): 1 category\n*   From Case 3 (`(2,1,0,1)`): 2 categories\n*   From Case 4 (`(2,0,1,1)`): 2 categories\n*   From Case 5 (`(2,0,0,2)`): 3 categories\n*   From Case 6 (`(1,1,1,1)`): 1 category\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic categories = 5 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
