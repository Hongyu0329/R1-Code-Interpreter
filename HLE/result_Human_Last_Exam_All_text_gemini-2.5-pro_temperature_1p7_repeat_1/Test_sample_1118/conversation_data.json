    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\n*   **Artist:** Curt Querner\n*   **Year:** 1933\n*   **Artwork:** A self-portrait\n*   **Context:** Created after having \"escaped from Gestapo.\"\n*   **Core Task:** Identify the object he is holding and explain its function as a symbol of resistance.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Historical Context (A Careful Point)**\n*   It's important to be precise about the historical events. Curt Querner was a member of the KPD (Communist Party of Germany). In March 1933, shortly after the Nazis seized power, he was arrested and imprisoned in the Hohnstein concentration camp.\n*   He did not \"escape\" in the traditional sense; he was released after several months of internment. The self-portrait was painted later that year, *after* his traumatic experience in the camp. This context of persecution and subsequent survival is crucial to understanding the painting.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Specific Artwork and the Object**\n*   The painting in question is titled **\"Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife\" (Self-Portrait with Pipe)**.\n*   As the title explicitly states, the object Curt Querner is holding in his hand is a **pipe**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Symbolism of the Pipe in Context**\n*   To understand why the pipe is a symbol of resistance, we must look at the overall composition of the portrait. Querner depicts himself with a gaunt face, deep-set eyes, and a tense, confrontational expression. He stares directly at the viewer, showing no sign of being broken.\n*   **Symbol of Unbroken Will:** In the face of the trauma he just endured, holding onto a simple, personal object like a pipe is an act of reclaiming his identity and normalcy. The Nazi regime sought to dehumanize its opponents. By painting himself with this everyday personal possession, Querner asserts that his spirit remains intact and his individuality has not been erased.\n*   **Symbol of Quiet Defiance:** The pipe is not a weapon. The resistance it symbolizes is not violent or overt. Instead, it represents a quiet, stubborn refusal to be defeated. It's a symbol of inner freedom and self-possession that the state could not take away from him. It's a statement of \"I am still here, I am still myself.\"\n*   **Symbol of Identity:** Querner was associated with the New Objectivity (Neue Sachlichkeit) art movement, which focused on sober, realistic depictions of the world. The pipe, a common object of an ordinary man, aligns with this artistic and personal identity. By holding it firmly, he reaffirms who he is—an artist of the people—in direct opposition to the grandiose, idealized art propagated by the Nazi regime.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter his imprisonment in a concentration camp in 1933, Curt Querner painted a self-portrait where he holds a pipe. This seemingly mundane object is transformed into a powerful symbol of resistance, representing his unbroken will, his quiet defiance against the dehumanizing Nazi regime, and the steadfast assertion of his personal and artistic identity.\n\n<<<A pipe>>>"
