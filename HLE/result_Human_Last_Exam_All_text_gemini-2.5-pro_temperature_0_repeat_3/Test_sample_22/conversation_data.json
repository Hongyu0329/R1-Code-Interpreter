    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):**\n    *   SNP heritability is a population parameter. It represents the proportion of the total phenotypic variance that is explained by the additive effects of a specific set of SNPs (e.g., all common SNPs on a genotyping array).\n    *   Crucially, it represents the *theoretical maximum* variance that could be explained if we knew the *true* causal effect size of every single one of those SNPs and combined them in a perfect linear model. It is the ceiling for prediction using these SNPs.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability:**\n    *   A Polygenic Score is a practical tool used to predict a phenotype. It is a number calculated for an individual by summing up their genotypes at many SNPs, with each SNP's contribution weighted by its *estimated* effect size.\n    *   These effect size estimates are derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), which is conducted on a *finite* sample of individuals.\n    *   The predictive ability of the PGS is measured by how well it correlates with the actual phenotype in a *new, independent* sample. This is typically quantified as the R² (the proportion of variance explained) when the phenotype is regressed on the PGS.\n\n3.  **Compare SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability:**\n    *   The SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the *goal* or the theoretical upper limit.\n    *   The PGS predictive ability (R²) is the *achieved* performance of a practical model.\n    *   The predictive ability of a PGS is almost always lower than the SNP heritability because the process of creating a PGS introduces several imperfections.\n\n4.  **Identify Reasons for the Discrepancy:**\n    The gap between the theoretical maximum (h²_SNP) and the practical result (PGS R²) exists for several fundamental reasons:\n    *   **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** GWASs are performed on finite samples, not the entire population. This means the effect sizes used to build the PGS are *estimates*, not the *true* values. These estimates contain statistical noise or error, which reduces the accuracy of the final score.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** SNPs are often correlated with each other. A SNP identified in a GWAS may not be the true causal variant but simply be located near it on the chromosome (i.e., in high LD). Methods to build PGSs try to account for this, but they are imperfect, leading to a loss of predictive power.\n    *   **Winner's Curse:** The effect sizes of SNPs that pass the stringent statistical significance threshold in a GWAS are likely to be overestimated. When these inflated effect sizes are used in a PGS and applied to a new sample, the score's performance is diminished.\n    *   **Population Differences:** The genetic architecture (e.g., LD patterns, allele frequencies) can differ between the population used for the GWAS (discovery sample) and the population in which the PGS is being tested (target sample). This mismatch reduces the PGS's accuracy.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Necessarily\"**: This word is key. It implies that the relationship is a rule, not just a frequent observation. Given that any real-world PGS is built from a finite GWAS, the effect size estimates will *necessarily* have some degree of error compared to the true values. This error *necessarily* degrades the predictive power below the theoretical maximum defined by SNP heritability. The only scenario where they could be equal is a theoretical one with an infinitely large GWAS sample and perfect knowledge, which is unattainable.\n*   **True Parameter vs. Estimate**: The question refers to \"the SNP heritability,\" which should be interpreted as the true, underlying population parameter. It is not referring to an *estimate* of SNP heritability (e.g., from a tool like GCTA-GREML), which has its own error. While a specific PGS R² value might by chance be higher than a specific *estimate* of h²_SNP, it cannot be higher than the *true* h²_SNP parameter that it is attempting to capture.\n*   **Predictive Ability as an Expectation**: \"Predictive ability\" refers to the expected performance of the score. While a single R² measurement in a small, noisy test set could fluctuate, the inherent, expected predictive power of a score built on imperfect information is fundamentally limited by the total amount of information available, which is what h²_SNP represents.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe SNP heritability defines the theoretical ceiling of predictability for a given set of SNPs. A polygenic score is a practical attempt to reach that ceiling, but it is built with imperfect information (estimated, not true, effect sizes) derived from finite samples. These inherent imperfections ensure that the predictive ability of the PGS will be lower than the theoretical maximum. Therefore, the statement is correct.\n\nTrue\n\n<<<True>>>"
