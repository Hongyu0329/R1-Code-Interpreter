    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the number of different colors that can be observed in the pure allotropes of the element phosphorus. An allotrope is a distinct structural form of an element. We need to identify all the major allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main allotropes of phosphorus**\nPhosphorus is known to exist in several different allotropic forms. The most common and well-established allotropes are:\n1.  White Phosphorus\n2.  Red Phosphorus\n3.  Violet Phosphorus (also known as Hittorf's Phosphorus)\n4.  Black Phosphorus\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the color of each allotrope**\n\n*   **White Phosphorus (P₄):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The color of this allotrope depends on its purity and exposure to light.\n    *   When freshly prepared and in its purest form, it is a colorless or **white** translucent, waxy solid.\n    *   However, it is highly reactive and unstable. Upon exposure to light, it slowly converts to the more stable red phosphorus. This transformation on the surface gives the solid a pale to dark **yellow** color. This form is so common that \"white phosphorus\" is often referred to as \"yellow phosphorus\".\n    *   Therefore, for the P₄ allotrope, two colors can be observed: **white** and **yellow**.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a polymeric form, and its exact color can vary.\n    *   It is an amorphous or crystalline polymer. Its color is generally **red**.\n    *   Depending on the method of preparation, particle size, and specific structure, the color can range from orange to a purplish-red. A specific form known as scarlet phosphorus is also a type of red phosphorus. We can group all these shades under the single color category of **red**.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a distinct crystalline form, different from common red phosphorus.\n    *   This is a polymeric, crystalline form of phosphorus. As its name implies, its color is **violet** or purple.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most stable allotrope of phosphorus under standard conditions.\n    *   It has a layered, crystalline structure similar to graphite. It is an electrical conductor.\n    *   Its appearance is **black** and flaky, with a metallic luster.\n\n**Step 4: List and count the distinct colors**\nBased on the analysis of the well-established allotropes, we can list the following distinct observable colors:\n1.  **White** (from pure white phosphorus)\n2.  **Yellow** (from aged/light-exposed white phosphorus)\n3.  **Red** (from red phosphorus)\n4.  **Violet** (from violet/Hittorf's phosphorus)\n5.  **Black** (from black phosphorus)\n\nCounting these distinct colors, we get a total of 5.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nThe question asks for the number of colors that can be observed. By systematically reviewing the common allotropes of phosphorus and their described appearances, we have identified five distinct colors: white, yellow, red, violet, and black.\n\n<<<5>>>"
