    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct theologian.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **Who:** A specific Christian theologian.\n2.  **What:** The first to develop \"specialized terminology.\"\n3.  **Purpose:** The terminology must be able to describe \"changes in the laws of nature.\"\n4.  **Specific Applications:** The terminology must be applicable to two distinct events:\n    *   The virgin birth of Jesus (a specific, singular miracle).\n    *   Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall (a systemic, ongoing change in the created order).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates**\nBased on the history of Christian theology concerning creation, miracles, and the Fall, several major figures come to mind:\n*   **Irenaeus:** An early Church Father who wrote about the recapitulation of creation in Christ, but didn't develop a specific metaphysical terminology for changes in natural law.\n*   **Augustine of Hippo:** A foundational theologian for Western Christianity who wrote extensively on creation, providence, miracles, and the effects of the Fall.\n*   **Thomas Aquinas:** A medieval scholastic theologian who systematized Christian doctrine, including a detailed analysis of miracles and God's relationship to the natural order.\n*   **John Calvin:** A Protestant Reformer who emphasized God's absolute sovereignty and providence, viewing miracles as direct acts of God's will.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Candidates Against the Criteria**\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas:** Aquinas developed a very precise vocabulary for miracles, categorizing them as happening *supra naturam* (above nature), *praeter naturam* (beyond nature's usual course), or *contra naturam* (against nature). This terminology is excellent for describing the virgin birth. However, he is not the *first* major theologian to develop such a system, as his work builds upon earlier thinkers.\n*   **John Calvin:** Calvin's focus was on God's direct, providential action. While he believed God performed miracles and that the Fall had cosmic consequences, he was less concerned with developing a specific metaphysical or philosophical terminology to explain the *mechanism* of how natural laws might be altered. His emphasis was on the direct power and will of God.\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD):** Augustine is the strongest candidate. He was grappling with how a perfect God could create a world that contains change, novelty, and evil. To explain this, he adapted a concept from Stoic and Neoplatonic philosophy and developed it into a unique Christian theological doctrine.\n\n**Step 4: Examine Augustine's Specialized Terminology**\n\n*   **The Terminology:** Augustine's key concept is that of **_rationes seminales_** (Latin for \"seminal reasons\" or \"seed principles\") or **_rationes causales_** (\"causal reasons\").\n*   **The Concept:** He argued that at the initial creation, God did not create everything in its final, mature form. Instead, God embedded the potential for everything that would ever exist—plants, animals, people, and even future events—into creation in the form of these invisible, seed-like principles. The unfolding of history and nature is the process of these seeds sprouting and developing at their appointed times according to God's providence.\n*   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** For Augustine, a miracle like the virgin birth is not a violation of the natural order God created. Instead, it is the activation of a *ratio seminalis* that God had placed within creation from the very beginning, hidden from human view but part of the deeper fabric of nature. It is an event that is contrary to the *usual* course of nature, but not contrary to the ultimate potential God embedded within nature.\n*   **Application to the Fall:** This framework is also perfectly suited to explain a change in nature after the Fall. The Fall could be understood as a cataclysmic event that altered the conditions under which the *rationes seminales* operate. Potentials for decay, death, thorns, and thistles—which may have been latent or held in check in the pre-Fall world—were \"activated\" or allowed to come to fruition as a consequence of human sin. This explains a systemic change in the operation of nature without requiring God to re-create the world.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nAugustine of Hippo was the first major Christian theologian to develop a specific, sophisticated terminology (*rationes seminales*) that could provide a unified explanation for both singular miracles like the virgin birth and systemic changes to the natural order, such as those believed to have occurred at the Fall. He predates other theologians like Aquinas who also developed systematic explanations.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
