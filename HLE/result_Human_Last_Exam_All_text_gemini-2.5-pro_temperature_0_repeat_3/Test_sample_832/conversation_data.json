    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut variation in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Performance:** The question specifies a very particular performance: Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya in the ballet *La Bayadère*, performed with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. This is a well-documented performance, and video clips are available for analysis.\n\n2.  **Isolate the Scene and Variation:** The scene is the \"Death of Nikiya,\" which occurs at the end of Act II (in the traditional Grigorovich production for the Bolshoi). Within this scene, Nikiya performs a solo variation after being presented with a basket of flowers. This variation is a dance of profound grief and despair before she is bitten by the snake hidden in the basket.\n\n3.  **Define the Ballet Step:** The step in question is the \"entrelacé,\" short for *tour jeté entrelacé*. This is a turning leap where the dancer throws one leg up, jumps, and switches legs in the air to land on the first leg, completing a half-turn. It creates a distinctive scissoring motion while turning.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:** To count the steps, we must watch Osipova's performance of this specific solo.\n    *   The variation begins with Nikiya expressing her sorrow.\n    *   The core of the variation's allegro (fast, jumping steps) section consists of a diagonal sequence of powerful leaps traveling from upstage to downstage.\n    *   This diagonal is the key section where the entrelacés are performed.\n\n5.  **Count the Steps:**\n    *   Watching the video of Osipova's 2009 performance, we can observe her moving to an upstage corner to begin the diagonal sequence.\n    *   She executes the first leap: it is a clear entrelacé.\n    *   She immediately follows with a second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth identical leap.\n    *   Each of these six consecutive jumps is a *tour jeté entrelacé*.\n    *   After this sequence of six entrelacés, she moves into the final section of the variation, which includes turns and dramatic poses, but no further entrelacés.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to analyze the correct performance (Osipova, Bolshoi, 2009 debut) as dancers can sometimes alter choreography.\n*   One must correctly identify the specific ballet step, distinguishing the entrelacé from other jumps like a *grand jeté*.\n*   The count must be limited to the solo variation itself, not including any other part of the scene.\n*   The analysis confirms that the main jumping sequence in this variation for this specific performance consists entirely of entrelacés.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on a visual analysis of the specified performance, Natalia Osipova performs a total of six entrelacés during her solo variation in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene.\n\n<<<6>>>"
