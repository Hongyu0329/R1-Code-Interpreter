    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understand the Definition of GCRD**\n\nA polynomial matrix G(s) is a **right divisor** of a polynomial matrix P(s) if there exists a polynomial matrix Q(s) such that P(s) = Q(s)G(s).\n\nA polynomial matrix G(s) is a **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)** of two polynomial matrices P1(s) and P2(s) if:\n*   G(s) is a common right divisor of both P1(s) and P2(s).\n*   Any other common right divisor, D(s), is a right divisor of G(s). (i.e., G(s) = L(s)D(s) for some polynomial matrix L(s)).\n\nThe GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant).\n\n**2. Method: The Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomial Matrices**\n\nThe GCRD can be found by applying elementary row operations to the compound matrix M(s) formed by stacking P1(s) and P2(s). The goal is to reduce M(s) to a row-echelon form. The non-zero rows of the resulting matrix will form the GCRD.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2(s) = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n**3. Form the Compound Matrix M(s)**\n\nM(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] =\n[[s^2 + s, -s],      (R1)\n [-s^2 - 1, s^2],     (R2)\n [s, 0],            (R3)\n [-s - 1, 1]]       (R4)\n\n**4. Perform Elementary Row Operations**\n\nWe will use rows with lower-degree polynomials to simplify rows with higher-degree polynomials.\n\n*   **Step 4.1:** Use R3 to simplify R1 and R2. Use R3 to simplify R4.\n    *   `R1 -> R1 - (s+1) * R3`: [s^2+s - (s+1)s, -s - 0] = [0, -s]\n    *   `R2 -> R2 + s * R3`: [-s^2-1 + s*s, s^2 + 0] = [-1, s^2]\n    *   `R4 -> R4 + R3`: [-s-1 + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [[0, -s],\n     [-1, s^2],\n     [s, 0],\n     [-1, 1]]\n\n*   **Step 4.2:** Use the new fourth row, R4' = [-1, 1], to simplify the other rows.\n    *   `R2' -> R2' - R4'`: [-1 - (-1), s^2 - 1] = [0, s^2 - 1]\n    *   `R3 -> R3 + s * R4'`: [s + s(-1), 0 + s(1)] = [0, s]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [[0, -s],\n     [0, s^2 - 1],\n     [0, s],\n     [-1, 1]]\n\n*   **Step 4.3:** Now focus on the three rows that have a zero in the first column. Let them be r_a = [0, -s], r_b = [0, s^2-1], r_c = [0, s].\n    *   `r_a -> r_a + r_c`: [0, -s + s] = [0, 0]\n    *   `r_b -> r_b - (s-1) * r_c`: [0, (s^2-1) - s(s-1)] = [0, s^2-1 - s^2+s] = [0, s-1]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [[0, 0],\n     [0, s-1],\n     [0, s],\n     [-1, 1]]\n\n*   **Step 4.4:** Simplify the second and third rows. Let r_d = [0, s-1] and r_e = [0, s].\n    *   `r_e -> r_e - r_d`: [0, s - (s-1)] = [0, 1]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [[0, 0],\n     [0, s-1],\n     [0, 1],\n     [-1, 1]]\n\n*   **Step 4.5:** Use the new third row, r_g = [0, 1], to eliminate the second-column entries in other rows.\n    *   `R2'' -> R2'' - (s-1) * r_g`: [0, (s-1) - (s-1)*1] = [0, 0]\n    *   `R4'' -> R4'' - r_g`: [-1, 1 - 1] = [-1, 0]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [[0, 0],\n     [0, 0],\n     [0, 1],\n     [-1, 0]]\n\n*   **Step 4.6:** Rearrange the rows and normalize to obtain the final row-echelon form.\n    Swap rows to bring the non-zero rows to the top:\n    [[-1, 0],\n     [0, 1],\n     [0, 0],\n     [0, 0]]\n\n    Multiply the first row by -1:\n    [[1, 0],\n     [0, 1],\n     [0, 0],\n     [0, 0]]\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nThe non-zero part of the reduced matrix is the GCRD. In this case, the GCRD is the 2x2 identity matrix. This means the matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are **right coprime**.\n\nThe greatest common right divisor is:\n[[1, 0],\n [0, 1]]\n\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
