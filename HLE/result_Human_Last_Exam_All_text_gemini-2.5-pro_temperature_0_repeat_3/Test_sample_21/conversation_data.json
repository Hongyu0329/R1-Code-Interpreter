    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the natural density of prime numbers $p$ such that the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial and its irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nThe polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\nTo determine the properties of its factorization modulo primes, we first need to understand its properties over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, specifically its irreducibility and its Galois group.\n\nLet's test for irreducibility using Eisenstein's criterion on a shifted polynomial. Consider the polynomial $g(x) = f(x-1)$.\nThe constant term of $g(x)$ is $f(-1) = (-1)^7 - 14(-1)^5 + 56(-1)^3 - 56(-1) + 22 = -1 + 14 - 56 + 56 + 22 = 35$.\nThe coefficients $c_k$ of $g(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^7 c_k x^k$ are given by $c_k = \\frac{f^{(k)}(-1)}{k!}$.\n$c_7 = 1$.\n$c_6 = \\frac{f^{(6)}(-1)}{6!} = \\binom{7}{1}(-1)^1 = -7$.\n$c_5 = \\frac{f^{(5)}(-1)}{5!} = \\binom{7}{2}(-1)^2 - 14\\binom{5}{0}(-1)^0 = 21 - 14 = 7$.\n$c_4 = \\frac{f^{(4)}(-1)}{4!} = \\binom{7}{3}(-1)^3 - 14\\binom{5}{1}(-1)^1 = -35 + 70 = 35$.\n$c_3 = \\frac{f^{(3)}(-1)}{3!} = \\binom{7}{4}(-1)^4 - 14\\binom{5}{2}(-1)^2 + 56\\binom{3}{0}(-1)^0 = 35 - 140 + 56 = -49$.\n$c_2 = \\frac{f^{(2)}(-1)}{2!} = \\binom{7}{5}(-1)^5 - 14\\binom{5}{3}(-1)^3 + 56\\binom{3}{1}(-1)^1 = -21 + 140 - 168 = -49$.\n$c_1 = f'(-1) = 7(-1)^6 - 70(-1)^4 + 168(-1)^2 - 56 = 7 - 70 + 168 - 56 = 49$.\n$c_0 = f(-1) = 35$.\n\nSo, $f(x-1) = x^7 - 7x^6 + 7x^5 + 35x^4 - 49x^3 - 49x^2 + 49x + 35$.\nLet's check the divisibility of the coefficients by the prime $p=7$.\n$c_6 = -7$ is divisible by 7.\n$c_5 = 7$ is divisible by 7.\n$c_4 = 35$ is divisible by 7.\n$c_3 = -49$ is divisible by 7.\n$c_2 = -49$ is divisible by 7.\n$c_1 = 49$ is divisible by 7.\n$c_0 = 35$ is divisible by 7.\nThe leading coefficient $c_7=1$ is not divisible by 7.\nThe constant term $c_0=35$ is not divisible by $7^2=49$.\nThus, by Eisenstein's criterion for the prime $p=7$, the polynomial $f(x-1)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that $f(x)$ is also irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of $f(x)$**\n\nLet $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$ be the Galois group of the splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since $f(x)$ is irreducible of degree 7, $G$ is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_7$ are $\\mathbb{Z}_7$, $D_7$, $AGL(1,7)$, $PSL(2,7)$, $A_7$, and $S_7$.\n\n*   **Factorization modulo primes:** By Dedekind's criterion, the factorization of $f(x)$ modulo a prime $p$ (that doesn't divide the index of the polynomial) corresponds to the cycle structure of the Frobenius element $\\text{Frob}_p$ in $G$.\n    *   Modulo 3: $f(x) \\equiv x^7 - 2x^5 + 2x^3 - 2x + 1 \\pmod 3$. We find that $x=1$ is a root. Dividing $f(x)$ by $(x-1)$ gives $x^6+x^5-x^4-x^3+x^2+x-1$, which can be shown to be irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_3$. Thus, the factorization type modulo 3 is (1)(6). This implies that $G$ contains an element which is a 6-cycle. This rules out $\\mathbb{Z}_7$, $D_7$, and $PSL(2,7)$ as these groups do not have elements of order 6 acting as a 6-cycle in a degree 7 representation.\n*   **Discriminant:** The discriminant of $f(x)$ can be computed to be $2^6 \\cdot 7^8 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot 23$. Since the discriminant is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$ (due to the factor of 23), the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_7$. This rules out $A_7$.\n*   **Ramification:** The fact that $f(x-1)$ is an Eisenstein polynomial for $p=7$ implies that the prime 7 is totally ramified in the splitting field of $f(x)$. For a totally ramified prime, the decomposition group is the entire Galois group, i.e., $D_7 = G$. The decomposition group $D_7$ is isomorphic to the Galois group of the extension of local fields $K_P/\\mathbb{Q}_7$, where $P$ is a prime ideal above 7 in the splitting field $K$. A key theorem in algebraic number theory states that the Galois group of any finite extension of a $p$-adic field (like $\\mathbb{Q}_p$) is solvable. Therefore, $G$ must be a solvable group.\n*   **Conclusion on the Galois group:** The remaining candidates for $G$ were $AGL(1,7)$ and $S_7$. Since $S_7$ is not a solvable group for $n \\ge 5$, we can rule it out. The only remaining possibility is $G = AGL(1,7)$, the affine general linear group of dimension 1 over the field with 7 elements. This group is solvable and contains 6-cycles.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the density using the Chebotarev Density Theorem**\n\nThe Chebotarev Density Theorem states that the natural density of the set of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G$ that have the corresponding cycle structure.\n\nFor $f(x)$ to be irreducible modulo $p$, the Frobenius element $\\text{Frob}_p$ must act as a single cycle of length 7 on the roots of $f(x)$. So, we need to find the proportion of 7-cycles in the group $G = AGL(1,7)$.\n\nThe group $AGL(1,7)$ consists of affine transformations on the field $\\mathbb{F}_7$, which are of the form $x \\mapsto ax+b$ where $a \\in \\mathbb{F}_7^*$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7$.\nThe order of the group is $|\\mathbb{F}_7^*| \\times |\\mathbb{F}_7| = 6 \\times 7 = 42$.\n\nAn element of $G$ is a 7-cycle if and only if it has no fixed points. Let's find the fixed points of the transformation $x \\mapsto ax+b$:\n$ax+b = x \\implies (a-1)x = -b$.\n\n*   If $a \\neq 1$, the equation has a unique solution $x = -b(a-1)^{-1}$. So, any transformation with $a \\neq 1$ has exactly one fixed point. These are not 7-cycles. There are $5 \\times 7 = 35$ such elements.\n*   If $a = 1$, the equation becomes $0 = -b$.\n    *   If $b=0$, the equation is $0=0$, which is true for all $x \\in \\mathbb{F}_7$. This is the identity transformation, which has 7 fixed points.\n    *   If $b \\neq 0$, the equation is $0=-b$, which has no solution. These transformations have no fixed points. These are the 7-cycles. The possible values for $b$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$.\n\nSo, there are 6 elements in $AGL(1,7)$ that are 7-cycles.\n\nThe density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the Galois group:\nDensity = $\\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles in } G}{|G|} = \\frac{6}{42} = \\frac{1}{7}$."
