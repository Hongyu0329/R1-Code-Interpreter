    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 Vertices:** The graph has a vertex set V with |V| = 5.\n*   **Nonisomorphic:** We are counting structurally distinct graphs. Two graphs are isomorphic if one can be relabeled to become the other.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected):** A connected graph with more than 2 vertices is 2-vertex-connected if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. An equivalent definition is a connected graph with at least 3 vertices that has no cut vertices (articulation points).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Key Properties and Formulate a Strategy\n\nA crucial property of a k-vertex-connected graph on n > k vertices is that its minimum degree is at least k. For a 2-vertex-connected graph with 5 vertices, the minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2. This is because if a vertex `v` had degree 1, its only neighbor would be a cut vertex (its removal would isolate `v`).\n\nOur strategy will be to enumerate all nonisomorphic simple graphs on 5 vertices with a minimum degree of at least 2, and then verify that each one is indeed 2-vertex-connected. We can systematically enumerate these graphs based on their number of edges, |E|. For a graph with 5 vertices, the maximum number of edges is C(5,2) = 10 (for the complete graph K5). The minimum number of edges for a graph with δ(G) ≥ 2 is 5 (for the cycle graph C5). So, we will check for |E| from 5 to 10.\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate and Analyze Graphs by Number of Edges\n\n**Case |E| = 5:**\n*   The sum of degrees is 2 * |E| = 10. With δ(G) ≥ 2, the only possible degree sequence is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n*   The only nonisomorphic graph with this degree sequence is the **cycle graph C5**.\n*   **2-connectivity check:** Removing any vertex from C5 leaves a path on 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. So, C5 is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n**Case |E| = 6:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 12. The only possible degree sequence with δ(G) ≥ 2 is (2, 2, 2, 3, 3).\n*   This graph can be constructed by starting with C5 (where all degrees are 2) and adding one edge. An edge added to C5 must connect two non-adjacent vertices (a chord). Up to isomorphism, there is only one way to add a single chord to C5.\n*   **2-connectivity check:** The resulting graph is a C5 with a chord. Removing any vertex leaves a connected graph. For example, in 1-2-3-4-5-1, add edge (1,3). Removing vertex 2 leaves the path 1-3-4-5. Removing vertex 1 leaves the path 2-3-4-5. The graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n**Case |E| = 7:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 14. Possible degree sequences with δ(G) ≥ 2:\n    1.  **(2, 2, 3, 3, 4):** This can be formed by adding two incident chords to C5, e.g., adding (1,3) and (1,4) to C5. This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **(2, 3, 3, 3, 3):** This can be formed by adding two non-incident chords to C5, e.g., adding (1,3) and (2,4). This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n    3.  **(2, 2, 2, 4, 4):** This graph can be constructed from a complete bipartite graph K_{2,3} by adding an edge between the two vertices in the smaller partition set. This graph is also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   These three graphs are nonisomorphic.\n*   **Count: 3**\n\n**Case |E| = 8:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 16. We can analyze this by considering the complement graph, which will have 10 - 8 = 2 edges.\n    1.  **Complement has 2 disjoint edges:** The graph is K5 minus two disjoint edges (e.g., remove (1,2) and (3,4)). The degree sequence is (3, 3, 3, 3, 4). This graph is the **Wheel Graph W5** (a central vertex connected to a C4). It is 3-vertex-connected, hence 2-vertex-connected.\n    2.  **Complement is a path P3:** The graph is K5 minus a path of length 2 (e.g., remove (1,2) and (1,3)). The degree sequence is (2, 3, 3, 4, 4). This graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   These two graphs are nonisomorphic.\n*   **Count: 2**\n\n**Case |E| = 9:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 18. The complement graph has 10 - 9 = 1 edge.\n*   The only such graph is **K5 with one edge removed (K5-e)**.\n*   **2-connectivity check:** This graph is 3-vertex-connected, so it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n**Case |E| = 10:**\n*   Sum of degrees = 20. The only graph is the **complete graph K5**.\n*   **2-connectivity check:** K5 is 4-vertex-connected, so it is also 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Tally\n\nLet's sum the counts from each case:\n*   |E| = 5: 1 graph (C5)\n*   |E| = 6: 1 graph (C5 + chord)\n*   |E| = 7: 3 graphs\n*   |E| = 8: 2 graphs (W5 and K5-P3)\n*   |E| = 9: 1 graph (K5-e)\n*   |E| = 10: 1 graph (K5)\n\nTotal number of graphs = 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 9.\n\nFinal Answer: There are 9 such graphs.\n\n<<<9>>>"
