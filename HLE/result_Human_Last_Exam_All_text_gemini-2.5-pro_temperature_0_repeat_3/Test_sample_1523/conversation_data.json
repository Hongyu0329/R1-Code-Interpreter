    "This problem asks for the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field in the context of the functional integral representation of the partition function at finite temperature. Let's break down the problem into logical steps.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Partition Function in Finite-Temperature Field Theory**\n\nThe starting point for finite-temperature quantum field theory is the partition function, $Z$, which is the trace of the density matrix in thermal equilibrium: $Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H})$, where $\\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature (with $k_B=1$) and $H$ is the Hamiltonian.\n\nUsing the path integral formalism, this can be expressed as a functional integral over all field configurations $\\phi(x, \\tau)$ in Euclidean spacetime. For a neutral scalar field, this is:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\nHere, $S_E[\\phi]$ is the Euclidean action, and the integral is over field configurations on a spacetime manifold $\\mathbb{R}^d \\times S^1$, where $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions. The \"time\" direction, $\\tau$, is compactified into a circle $S^1$ of circumference $\\beta$. This leads to the crucial boundary condition for a bosonic field like the neutral scalar: periodicity in imaginary time.\n$\\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) = \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau + \\beta)$\n\n**Step 2: The Euclidean Action and the Operator D**\n\nThe Euclidean action $S_E$ is obtained from the Minkowski action by a Wick rotation ($t \\to -i\\tau$). For a neutral scalar field with mass $m$ and a potential $V(\\phi)$, the Euclidean Lagrangian density is:\n$\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 + V(\\phi)$\n\nThe notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ refers to the quadratic part of the action, which corresponds to the free theory (where $V(\\phi)=0$). Let's denote this part of the action as $S_0$.\n$S_0[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\nTo identify the operator $D$, we need to write the action in the form $S_0 = \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\phi D \\phi$. This is achieved by using integration by parts on the derivative terms.\n*   For the time derivative: $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 = [\\phi \\partial_\\tau \\phi]_0^\\beta - \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\phi (\\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi)$. The boundary term $[\\phi \\partial_\\tau \\phi]_0^\\beta$ vanishes due to the periodicity of $\\phi$ and $\\partial_\\tau\\phi$.\n*   For the spatial derivatives: $\\int d^d x (\\nabla\\phi)^2 = \\int_{\\partial V} \\phi (\\nabla\\phi) \\cdot d\\vec{S} - \\int d^d x \\, \\phi (\\nabla^2 \\phi)$. The surface term vanishes if we assume the fields decay to zero at spatial infinity.\n\nApplying this to the action, we get:\n$S_0[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$\n\nFrom this form, we can identify the operator $D$ as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n$D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 = -\\Box_E + m^2$\nwhere $\\Box_E = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2$ is the Euclidean d'Alembertian.\n\n**Step 3: Defining and Calculating the Inner Product**\n\nThe notation $(\\phi, \\psi)$ represents the inner product in the function space of the fields. For real-valued scalar fields over the Euclidean spacetime domain, this is the standard $L^2$ inner product, defined by the integral of their product over the domain:\n$(\\phi_1, \\phi_2) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi_1(\\vec{x}, \\tau) \\phi_2(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$\n\nWe want to find the inner product of the field $\\phi$ with the result of the operator $D$ acting on $\\phi$, which is $(D\\phi)$.\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) (D\\phi)(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$\n\nSubstituting the expression for the operator $D$ we found in Step 2:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$\n\n**Step 4: Final Result**\n\nBy comparing the result from Step 3 with the expression for the free action $S_0[\\phi]$ from Step 2, we find a direct relationship:\n$S_0[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D_\\phi)$\nTherefore, the inner product is simply twice the free Euclidean action:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = 2 S_0[\\phi]$\n\nThe explicit expression for the inner product is:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2 + m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\nThis is obtained by performing the integration by parts in reverse on the expression from Step 3.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Euclidean Spacetime:** The entire formalism is set in Euclidean spacetime, where the metric has a positive-definite signature. This is essential for the path integral to be a well-defined statistical average with a real, positive weight $e^{-S_E}$.\n2.  **Periodicity in Imaginary Time:** For bosonic fields at finite temperature, the fields must be periodic in the imaginary time direction $\\tau$ with period $\\beta=1/T$. This is a fundamental requirement that leads to the quantization of energy modes (Matsubara frequencies).\n3.  **Integration by Parts:** This mathematical tool is crucial for relating the kinetic terms in the Lagrangian to the differential operator $D$. The vanishing of the boundary terms is guaranteed by the periodicity in $\\tau$ and the assumption that fields vanish at spatial infinity.\n4.  **Scope of the Question:** The question concerns the term $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, which is associated with the quadratic (free) part of the action. Interaction terms, if present, would be separate terms in the action, typically of higher order in $\\phi$.\n5.  **Momentum Space Representation:** The analysis can also be done in momentum space (the Matsubara formalism). The field $\\phi$ is expanded in a Fourier series in $\\tau$ and a Fourier transform in $\\vec{x}$. The operator $D$ becomes diagonal in this basis, with eigenvalues $(\\omega_n^2 + |\\vec{k}|^2 + m^2)$, where $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n/\\beta$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies. The inner product then becomes a sum over all modes:\n    $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d} |\\tilde{\\phi}(\\vec{k}, \\omega_n)|^2 (\\omega_n^2 + |\\vec{k}|^2 + m^2)$, where $\\tilde{\\phi}$ is the Fourier transform of $\\phi$. This confirms the position-space result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the integral of the field $\\phi$ against the action of the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator $D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2$ on $\\phi$. This quantity is exactly twice the free Euclidean action, $S_0[\\phi]$.\n\n<<<The inner product is given by the expression:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau) \\left( -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 \\right) \\phi(\\vec{x}, \\tau)$\nThis is equivalent to twice the free part of the Euclidean action, $2S_0[\\phi]$. After performing an integration by parts, it can also be written as:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2 + m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$>>>"
