    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the identity of a physicist based on several key clues:\n    *   He is a physicist.\n    *   He is better known for work in microscopy.\n    *   He discovered an optical effect in real imagery.\n    *   The discovery was prompted by an accidental observation made by a custodial worker.\n    *   The observation involved cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Anecdote:** The most specific and unusual clue is the story of the discovery: an optical effect involving concave mirrors was accidentally noticed by a custodial worker. This story points to the visualization of phenomena that are normally invisible, such as air currents or imperfections in a transparent medium.\n\n3.  **Identify the Optical Effect:** The effect described is the **Schlieren effect** (from the German word for \"streaks\"). Schlieren photography and related techniques are used to visualize variations in the refractive index of a transparent medium. When light passes through a region with a non-uniform refractive index (like turbulent air), it gets deflected. An optical system can be arranged to make these deflections visible as light or dark patches. Concave mirrors are often used in these systems to collimate and focus the light.\n\n4.  **Identify the Physicist and the Correct Story:** The development of the modern Schlieren method, specifically the **knife-edge test**, is credited to the French physicist **Léon Foucault** around 1858.\n    *   **The Story:** Foucault developed his test to check the surface quality of concave mirrors for telescopes. The standard historical account is that Foucault himself noticed that the warm air currents rising from his hand near the optical path became visible as shimmering streaks. This was an accidental observation of air convection.\n    *   **The \"Custodial Worker\" Detail:** The part about a \"custodial worker\" making the initial observation is not part of the standard historical account of Foucault's discovery. It is likely an apocryphal detail or a conflation with another scientific discovery story. However, the core elements—a physicist, an optical effect, concave mirrors, and the accidental observation of air currents—point directly to Léon Foucault.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the \"Microscopy\" Connection:** This is the trickiest part of the question. Léon Foucault is most famous for two other achievements: the Foucault pendulum (which demonstrates the Earth's rotation) and his accurate measurement of the speed of light. He is not primarily known as a \"microscopist.\" However, his work in optics is fundamental. The Foucault knife-edge test is a cornerstone of optical testing. It is a direct precursor and conceptually related to methods used in microscopy to view transparent specimens, most notably the phase-contrast microscope developed by Frits Zernike. So, while Foucault's fame lies elsewhere, his optical work has significant relevance and parallels to the field of microscopy. The question states he is \"better known for work in the microscopy field,\" which might be a slight misstatement in the prompt, but the connection is valid.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Despite the minor inaccuracies in the prompt's phrasing (the \"custodial worker\" and the primary field of fame), the combination of the specific optical effect (Schlieren), the equipment used (concave mirrors), and the nature of the accidental discovery (visualizing air currents) points unambiguously to one historical figure.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe physicist who developed the knife-edge test, a form of Schlieren imaging, after noticing how it made air currents visible while testing concave mirrors is Léon Foucault.\n\n<<<Léon Foucault>>>"
