    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\". This means we need to consider the total amount of each gas in the Earth's system (atmosphere, crust, oceans), not just its concentration in the air. The year specified, 2002, is not a significant factor, as the overall abundances of these elements do not change measurably on a yearly timescale.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Stable Noble Gases**\nFirst, let's consider the stable (non-radioactive or very long-lived) noble gases. Their primary reservoir on Earth is the atmosphere. Their abundance in the atmosphere by volume is as follows:\n*   **Argon (Ar):** ~9,340 parts per million (ppm), or 0.934%. It is the most abundant noble gas.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** ~18.2 ppm\n*   **Helium (He):** ~5.2 ppm\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** ~1.1 ppm\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion)\n\nBased on atmospheric concentration, Xenon (Xe) is the rarest of the *stable* noble gases.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Abundance of Radon (Rn)**\nNow, we must consider Radon.\n*   **Radioactivity and Half-life:** Radon is a radioactive gas. Its most stable and common isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Source:** It is not a primordial element on Earth but is continuously generated from the radioactive decay of radium-226, which is found in trace amounts in rocks and soil across the planet.\n*   **Abundance:** Because Radon decays so quickly, it never accumulates in significant quantities. Its concentration is extremely low and varies by location. On average, its concentration in the atmosphere is on the order of 1 part in 10^21 (one part per sextillion). This is vastly lower than Xenon's 87 parts per billion.\n\n**Step 5: Compare All Noble Gases**\nLet's compare the rarest stable noble gas, Xenon, with Radon.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** While its concentration is low (0.087 ppm), it is stable and has accumulated in the atmosphere over geological time. The total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is estimated to be about 2 trillion metric tons (2 x 10^12 kg).\n*   **Radon (Rn):** Due to its rapid decay, the total amount of Radon in the entire atmosphere at any given moment is estimated to be only about 2.4 billion kg (2.4 x 10^9 kg). Even including the Radon in the Earth's crust and oceans, its total terrestrial mass is estimated to be around 10^11 kg, which is still more than ten times less than the mass of Xenon.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBecause of its extremely short half-life and rapid radioactive decay, Radon is present in far smaller quantities on Earth than any other noble gas, including Xenon. Therefore, as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, Radon is the rarest.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
