    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions ($\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$) and time ($t$) describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. For a velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$, the equations are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p' + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity and $p'$ is the pressure divided by the constant density $\\rho$. We will analyze the case with no external forces. A symmetry of these equations is a transformation of the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, p')$ that maps any solution to another solution. The set of all such symmetries forms a Lie group. We are looking for the dimension of this group, which is equivalent to the dimension of its Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying the Symmetries\n\nWe look for continuous groups of transformations that leave the equations invariant. This is typically done by finding the infinitesimal generators of these transformations.\n\n1.  **Time Translation:** The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$.\n    *   Transformation: $t \\to t + s$\n    *   This is a 1-parameter group.\n    *   Dimension: **1**\n\n2.  **Space Translations:** The equations have constant coefficients and are defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$ for a constant vector $\\mathbf{a}$.\n    *   This is a 3-parameter group.\n    *   Dimension: **3**\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotations:** The equations are covariant with respect to rotations of the spatial coordinates, as all differential operators ($\\nabla$, $\\nabla \\cdot$, $\\nabla^2$) are rotationally invariant.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to R\\mathbf{u}$, where $R \\in SO(3)$.\n    *   The rotation group $SO(3)$ is a 3-parameter group.\n    *   Dimension: **3**\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$, with $p'$ remaining unchanged.\n    *   This is a 3-parameter group, corresponding to the three components of the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}$.\n    *   Dimension: **3**\n\n5.  **Scaling Transformation:** The equations admit a specific scaling symmetry that relates space, time, velocity, and pressure.\n    *   Transformation: $t \\to \\lambda^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$, $p' \\to \\lambda^{-2} p'$.\n    *   This is a 1-parameter group, with parameter $\\lambda$.\n    *   Dimension: **1**\n\n6.  **Pressure Shift:** The pressure $p'$ only appears through its gradient, $\\nabla p'$. Therefore, shifting the pressure by a constant does not change the momentum equation.\n    *   Transformation: $p' \\to p' + c$.\n    *   This is a 1-parameter group.\n    *   Dimension: **1**\n\n### Step 3: The Infinite-Dimensional Nature of the Full Symmetry Group\n\nIt is a known result in the group analysis of differential equations that the full Lie group of symmetries for the Navier-Stokes equations is infinite-dimensional. This arises from symmetries involving arbitrary functions of time, such as:\n*   Generalized Galilean boosts: $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{g}(t)$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\dot{\\mathbf{g}}(t)$, with a corresponding transformation for the pressure.\n*   Time-dependent pressure shifts: $p' \\to p' + h(t)$.\n\n### Step 4: Interpreting the Question and Final Calculation\n\nWhen a system of differential equations possesses an infinite-dimensional symmetry group, a question asking for \"the dimension\" is conventionally understood to be asking for the dimension of the **maximal finite-dimensional Lie subalgebra** of symmetries.\n\nThe six types of transformations listed in Step 2 generate a finite-dimensional Lie algebra. Let's sum their dimensions:\n*   Time Translation: 1\n*   Space Translations: 3\n*   Spatial Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean Boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n*   Pressure Shift: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\nThis 12-dimensional Lie algebra is the maximal finite-dimensional symmetry algebra of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. It is known as the **Schrödinger algebra** $sch(3)$, as it is also the symmetry algebra of the free Schrödinger equation in 3D.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, interpreted as the dimension of its maximal finite-dimensional symmetry group, is the sum of the dimensions of the independent one-parameter groups: time translation (1), space translations (3), spatial rotations (3), Galilean boosts (3), scaling (1), and pressure shift (1).\n\nThe total dimension is $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\n<<<12>>>"
