    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the system and find equilibrium points.**\nThe system is given by:\n1.  $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t) + 5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n2.  $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe are interested in the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$.\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are points $(d, u)$ where $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\n\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find the u-coordinates of the equilibrium points are $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0 = 2d^2$.\n    Setting $d'=0$ gives $2d^2=0$, so $d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d$.\n    Setting $d'=0$ gives $2d^2+2d=0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$.\n    So, $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives the equilibrium points **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nIn summary, the equilibrium points in the upper half-plane ($u \\geq 0$) are (0, 0), (0, 1), and (-1, 1).\n\n**Step 2: Classify the equilibrium points (optional but helpful).**\nBy linearizing the system around the equilibrium points, we can determine their stability. The Jacobian matrix is:\n$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3+10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$\n*   At **(-1, 1)**: $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, **(-1, 1) is a saddle point.**\n*   At **(0, 1)**: $J(0, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, **(0, 1) is an unstable node (source).**\n*   At **(0, 0)**: The Jacobian is the zero matrix, so linearization is inconclusive. A more detailed analysis shows it is a saddle-node.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the separatrix.**\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different long-term behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are always separatrices. Since we have a saddle point at (-1, 1), we can look for its manifolds. These manifolds are special trajectories passing through the saddle point.\n\nLet's search for an invariant curve of the form $d = f(u)$, which would represent a trajectory in the phase plane. If such a curve exists, it must satisfy the relation derived from the chain rule: $d' = \\frac{df}{du} u'$.\nSubstituting the given equations:\n$2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u) = f'(u) [u^2(u-1)]$\nSince $d=f(u)$, we have:\n$2(f(u))^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)f(u) + u^3(u-1) = f'(u) u^2(u-1)$\n\nLet's test a simple polynomial form for $f(u)$. Observing the powers of $u$ and the structure of the equation, a good candidate to try is $f(u) = cu^2$.\nIf $f(u) = cu^2$, then $f'(u) = 2cu$.\nSubstitute this into the equation:\n$2(cu^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(cu^2) + u^3(u-1) = (2cu) u^2(u-1)$\n$2c^2u^4 - 3cu^3 + 5cu^4 + u^4 - u^3 = 2cu^3(u-1)$\n$(2c^2 + 5c + 1)u^4 + (-3c - 1)u^3 = 2cu^4 - 2cu^3$\n\nFor this equality to hold for all $u$, the coefficients of each power of $u$ must be equal.\n*   Comparing coefficients of $u^3$:\n    $-3c - 1 = -2c \\implies -1 = c \\implies c = -1$.\n*   Comparing coefficients of $u^4$:\n    $2c^2 + 5c + 1 = 2c$.\nLet's check if $c=-1$ satisfies this second equation:\n$2(-1)^2 + 5(-1) + 1 = 2(1) - 5 + 1 = -2$.\nAnd the right side is $2c = 2(-1) = -2$.\nSince $-2 = -2$, the equation holds for $c=-1$.\n\nThus, we have found an invariant curve given by the equation **$d = -u^2$**.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the invariant curve is a separatrix.**\nLet's check if this curve passes through any of our equilibrium points.\n*   For the saddle point **(-1, 1)**: Does $-1 = -(1)^2$? Yes.\n*   For the point **(0, 0)**: Does $0 = -(0)^2$? Yes.\n\nThe curve $d = -u^2$ is a trajectory that connects the saddle point (-1, 1) to the equilibrium point (0, 0). A trajectory that connects to a saddle point is part of that saddle's stable or unstable manifold and is therefore a separatrix. This particular curve can be shown to be the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nTherefore, the separatrix of the system is the parabola given by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
