    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_{4n}$):** The generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, is given by the presentation:\n    $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    For this problem, the group size is 128. So, $4n = 128$, which implies $n = 32$.\n    The group is $G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. This set is denoted by $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Structure and Elements of $Q_{128}$\n\n*   The elements of $G = Q_{128}$ are of the form $x^i$ for $0 \\le i < 64$ or $x^i y$ for $0 \\le i < 64$.\n*   The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64. Its elements have orders that are divisors of 64.\n*   For elements of the form $g = x^i y$, let's find their order.\n    $g^2 = (x^i y)^2 = x^i y x^i y = x^i (y x^i y^{-1}) y^2 = x^i (x^{-i}) y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    $g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n    Since $g^2 = x^{32} \\neq 1$, the order of any element $x^i y$ is 4.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the Power Subgroups $G^k$\n\nWe need to find the set of all possible subgroups $G^k$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We can analyze this by considering the properties of the exponent $k$.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is an odd integer**\n\nLet $k$ be an odd integer. We want to determine the set $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n*   For any element $x^i \\in \\langle x \\rangle$, we want to see if it can be expressed as $h^k$ for some $h \\in G$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64) = 1$. Thus, there exists an integer $m$ such that $km \\equiv 1 \\pmod{64}$. If we choose $h = x^{im}$, then $h^k = (x^{im})^k = x^{imk} = x^i$. So, every element of $\\langle x \\rangle$ is in $G^k$.\n*   For any element $x^j y$, we want to find an $h$ such that $h^k = x^j y$. Let's try $h = x^m y$.\n    *   If $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, then $k = 4q+1$. $(x^m y)^k = ((x^m y)^4)^q (x^m y)^1 = 1^q (x^m y) = x^m y$. To get $x^j y$, we need $m=j$. So $h = x^j y$ works.\n    *   If $k \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, then $k = 4q+3$. $(x^m y)^k = ((x^m y)^4)^q (x^m y)^3 = (x^m y)^3 = (x^m y)^2(x^m y) = x^{32}x^m y = x^{m+32}y$. To get $x^j y$, we need $m+32 \\equiv j \\pmod{64}$, so $m \\equiv j-32 \\pmod{64}$. So $h = x^{j-32}y$ works.\nSince every element in $G$ can be written as a $k$-th power of some other element in $G$, we have $G^k = G$ for any odd $k$. This gives us our first power subgroup: $G$ itself (which corresponds to $k=1$).\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is an even integer**\n\nLet $k = 2^j \\cdot m$, where $m$ is an odd integer and $j \\ge 1$.\nThe set of $k$-th powers is $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{g^{m \\cdot 2^j} \\mid g \\in G\\} = \\{(g^m)^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\nFrom Case 1, we know that the mapping $g \\mapsto g^m$ is a bijection on $G$ (since $G^m=G$). This means the set $\\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$ is equal to the set $G$.\nTherefore, $G^k = \\{h^{2^j} \\mid h \\in G\\} = G^{2^j}$.\nThis crucial simplification means we only need to find the distinct subgroups of the form $G^{2^j}$ for $j \\ge 0$.\n\n### Step 4: List the Distinct Power Subgroups\n\nLet's compute $G^{2^j}$ for $j=0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\n*   **j = 0:** $G^{2^0} = G^1 = G$. This is the entire group of order 128.\n\n*   **j = 1:** $G^{2^1} = G^2 = \\{g^2 \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n    *   If $g = x^i$, $g^2 = x^{2i}$. This generates the subgroup $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   If $g = x^i y$, $g^2 = x^{32}$.\n    So, $G^2 = \\{x^{2i} \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\} \\cup \\{x^{32}\\} = \\langle x^2 \\rangle \\cup \\{x^{32}\\}$. Since $x^{32} = (x^2)^{16}$, $x^{32}$ is already in $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n    Thus, $G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$, a cyclic subgroup of order 32.\n\n*   **j = 2:** $G^{2^2} = G^4 = \\{g^4 \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n    *   If $g = x^i$, $g^4 = x^{4i}$. This generates the subgroup $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$.\n    *   If $g = x^i y$, $g^4 = 1$.\n    So, $G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle \\cup \\{1\\} = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 16.\n\n*   **j > 2:** For any $j \\ge 2$, the power $2^j$ is a multiple of 4.\n    $G^{2^j} = \\{g^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n    *   If $g = x^i$, $g^{2^j} = x^{i \\cdot 2^j}$. This generates the subgroup $\\langle x^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    *   If $g = x^i y$, its order is 4, so $g^{2^j} = (g^4)^{2^{j-2}} = 1$.\n    So, for $j \\ge 2$, $G^{2^j} = \\langle x^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n\nLet's list the distinct subgroups generated this way:\n1.  $j=0: G^1 = G$ (Order 128)\n2.  $j=1: G^2 = \\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (Order 32)\n3.  $j=2: G^4 = \\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (Order 16)\n4.  $j=3: G^8 = \\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (Order 8)\n5.  $j=4: G^{16} = \\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (Order 4)\n6.  $j=5: G^{32} = \\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (Order 2). This subgroup is the center of $G$, $Z(G)$.\n7.  $j=6: G^{64} = \\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. This is the trivial subgroup (Order 1).\n\nFor any $j > 6$, the order of any element in $G$ divides $2^j$ (since the maximum order is 64). Therefore, $g^{2^j} = 1$ for all $g \\in G$, which means $G^{2^j} = \\{1\\}$. So, no new subgroups are generated for $j > 6$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Count\n\nThe distinct power subgroups are:\n$G, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}$.\nThese subgroups all have different orders (128, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1), so they are all distinct.\nCounting them, we find there are a total of 7 power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
