    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe question mentions the poet Andrei Voznesensky and a specific description he used: \"a joy-discovering sailor\". This points to a particular work by Voznesensky about a historical figure associated with sea voyages and discovery. This phrase is from the libretto of the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"), for which Voznesensky wrote the poems.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe question quotes a line from the same poet: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This line is also from \"Juno and Avos\". It tells us that the historical figure in question had a lost or unknown burial site for a very long time, which was a source of historical lament.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the protagonist of the work.**\nThe central figure of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. He was a key figure in the Russian-American Company and led the first Russian circumnavigation of the globe. His story, including his voyage to California and his romance with Concepción Argüello, is the basis for the opera.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the clues to the historical figure.**\n*   **\"Joy-discovering sailor\":** Rezanov was an explorer on a mission to establish trade and expand Russian influence, fitting the poetic description of a discoverer.\n*   **Lost Grave:** Rezanov died suddenly in Krasnoyarsk in 1807 while returning to St. Petersburg. He was buried at the Voskresensky Cathedral. However, the cathedral was demolished in the 1930s during the Soviet period, and the exact location of his grave was lost. This perfectly matches the line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\".\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the final clue.**\nThe question states that the answer to the location of his grave \"emerged in the late 1980s\". Following the immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos\", there was a renewed public and academic interest in finding Rezanov's final resting place. Archaeological work and research in Krasnoyarsk during this period led to the identification of the presumed burial site. A memorial was later erected, effectively providing an \"answer\" to Voznesensky's poetic question.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll the clues—the poet (Voznesensky), the specific quotes (from \"Juno and Avos\"), the subject's role (explorer/sailor), the lost grave, and the timeline of its rediscovery (late 1980s)—point directly to Nikolai Rezanov.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
