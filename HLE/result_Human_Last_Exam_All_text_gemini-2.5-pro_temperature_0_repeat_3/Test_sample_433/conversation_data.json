    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Components of the Question:**\n    *   **Container Type:** \"single dose container ampule\".\n    *   **Action:** \"puncture\" (which for an ampule means breaking it open).\n    *   **Environment:** \"in a sterile environment\" (implying an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control like a laminar airflow workbench).\n    *   **Question:** What is the Beyond-Use Date (BUD)?\n\n2.  **Consult Governing Standards:**\n    *   The primary authority for sterile compounding practices and BUDs in the United States is the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically USP General Chapter <797> \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations.\"\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specifics of an Ampule:**\n    *   An ampule is a sealed glass container. To access the medication, the neck of the ampule must be broken.\n    *   Unlike a vial with a rubber stopper, an ampule cannot be resealed once opened. It becomes an open container, directly exposed to the air in the environment.\n\n4.  **Apply USP <797> Rules for Single-Dose Containers:**\n    *   USP <797> has very specific rules for single-dose containers because they lack antimicrobial preservatives.\n    *   The standard makes a critical distinction between single-dose *vials* and single-dose *ampules*.\n    *   **For a single-dose vial:** When punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment, the contents can be used for up to 12 hours.\n    *   **For a single-dose ampule:** Because it cannot be resealed, the risk of microbial and particulate contamination is immediate and continuous, even within an ISO Class 5 environment. Therefore, the standard dictates that the contents of an opened ampule must be used **immediately**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The contents of the ampule must be withdrawn and used without delay. Any unused portion must be discarded immediately after the dose is withdrawn. There is no extended BUD (e.g., 1 hour, 6 hours, or 12 hours) for an opened ampule.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ampule vs. Vial:** Do not confuse the rule for an ampule with the rule for a single-dose vial. A single-dose vial (with a stopper) has a 12-hour BUD after being punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment. An ampule does not.\n*   **Definition of \"Immediately\":** In this context, \"immediately\" means the contents are used in the next procedural step without any storage or delay.\n*   **Environment Matters, but has Limits:** While the sterile environment (ISO Class 5) provides protection, it cannot eliminate the risk associated with a container that is completely open to the air, which is the case with a broken ampule.\n*   **No Preservatives:** The absence of preservatives in single-dose containers is the primary reason for these strict time limits, as there is nothing to inhibit microbial growth if contamination occurs.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the BUD for a single-dose ampule after it has been opened is \"immediate use.\"\n\n<<<The contents must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded. There is no assigned time-based BUD.>>>"
