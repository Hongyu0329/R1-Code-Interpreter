    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring attached to a carboxamide group, -C(=O)N-.\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide, making the group -C(=O)N(CH₂CH₃)₂. This group is at position 1 of the benzene ring.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂, is attached to position 3 of the benzene ring.\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      C(=O)N(Et)₂\n     / \\\n  (C1)--(C2)\n  /      \\\n(C6)    (C3)--N(Me)₂\n  \\      /\n  (C5)--(C4)\n```\nWhere C2, C4, C5, and C6 are bonded to hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction Step (sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF)**\n\n*   **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium)** is a very strong organometallic base.\n*   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine)** is a chelating agent for the lithium ion (Li⁺). It breaks up the aggregates of sec-BuLi, increasing its basicity, and stabilizes the resulting organolithium product.\n*   **THF (tetrahydrofuran)** is the solvent.\n*   **Reaction Type**: This combination of reagents is characteristic of a **Directed Ortho Metalation (DoM)** reaction. In this reaction, a functional group on the aromatic ring, called a Directed Metalation Group (DMG), coordinates to the lithium ion and directs the base to deprotonate an adjacent (ortho) C-H bond.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs) and Determine the Site of Deprotonation**\n\nThe starting material has two potential DMGs, both containing heteroatoms with lone pairs that can coordinate to lithium:\n1.  **-C(=O)N(Et)₂ (amide group) at C1**: This is a very powerful DMG. The carbonyl oxygen coordinates strongly to Li⁺. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, which are **C2** and **C6**.\n2.  **-N(Me)₂ (dimethylamino group) at C3**: This is also a good DMG. The nitrogen atom coordinates to Li⁺. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, which are **C2** and **C4**.\n\nNow, we must determine which C-H bond is the most acidic and most likely to be removed:\n*   **Proton at C2**: This position is ortho to *both* the amide group and the dimethylamino group. The two DMGs work together in a **synergistic** fashion. The lithium ion can be chelated by both the carbonyl oxygen and the amino nitrogen, forming a stable six-membered ring intermediate. This makes the proton at C2 exceptionally acidic and the site of deprotonation is highly favored here.\n*   **Proton at C4**: This position is only ortho to the dimethylamino group.\n*   **Proton at C6**: This position is only ortho to the stronger amide group.\n\nDue to the powerful synergistic effect, deprotonation (lithiation) will occur selectively at the **C2** position. The intermediate formed is N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Methyl Iodide)**\n\n*   **Methyl iodide (CH₃I)** is an electrophile. The carbon atom is electron-deficient (δ+) and is susceptible to attack by a nucleophile.\n*   The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step has a highly nucleophilic carbon at the C2 position (effectively a carbanion, C⁻Li⁺).\n*   This nucleophilic carbon at C2 will attack the electrophilic carbon of methyl iodide in an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the iodide ion (I⁻).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction sequence results in the replacement of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position with a methyl group (-CH₃).\n\n*   Starting Material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n*   Modification: A methyl group is added at position 2.\n*   Final Product: **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**\n\nThe structure of the final product is:\n```\n      C(=O)N(Et)₂\n     / \\\n  (C1)--(C2)--CH₃\n  /      \\\n(C6)    (C3)--N(Me)₂\n  \\      /\n  (C5)--(C4)\n```\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
