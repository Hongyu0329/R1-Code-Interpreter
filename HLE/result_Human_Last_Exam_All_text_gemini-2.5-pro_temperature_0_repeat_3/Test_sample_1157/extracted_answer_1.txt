**1. Specific Procedures for Appropriate Management:**

The management should be conducted in three phases, prioritizing the patient's systemic health:

*   **Phase I: Emergency Management**
    *   **Systemic:** Immediately refer the patient for medical management of her uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%) to stabilize her blood glucose levels. Administer prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent infection in the contaminated wounds and provide a tetanus booster.
    *   **Dental:** Perform a thorough clinical and radiographic (X-ray) assessment to rule out bone fractures. Gently debride and irrigate the open tooth sockets, smooth any sharp bone edges (alveoloplasty), and suture the soft tissues to promote healing and preserve the ridge. Manage pain with appropriate analgesics.

*   **Phase II: Healing and Stabilization (3-6 months)**
    *   Focus on achieving good glycemic control with her physician (target HbA1c < 7.0%).
    *   Monitor the healing of the sockets and maintain excellent oral hygiene.
    *   A temporary acrylic "flipper" denture may be provided for aesthetics during this period.

*   **Phase III: Definitive Management**
    *   Once her diabetes is well-controlled and the gums and bone have fully healed, proceed with fabricating a definitive prosthesis.
