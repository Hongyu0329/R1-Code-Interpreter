    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph. Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Graph Properties:** We are given a graph $G$ with the following properties:\n    *   The number of vertices is $n = 12345$.\n    *   The graph $G$ is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n    *   The maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ is mentioned but its value is not specified. It can be any value possible for such a graph.\n\n2.  **Objective:** We need to find the \"maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly\". A proper coloring requires that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The minimum number of colors required for a proper coloring of a specific graph $G$ is its chromatic number, denoted $\\chi(G)$. The question is asking for the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$ among all graphs that satisfy the given conditions. In other words, we want to find:\n    $\\max \\{ \\chi(G) \\mid |V(G)| = 12345 \\text{ and } G \\neq K_{12345} \\}$.\n\n### Careful Points and Key Concepts\n\n1.  **Chromatic Number of a Complete Graph:** A complete graph on $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, has every vertex connected to every other vertex. To color it properly, every vertex must receive a unique color. Therefore, the chromatic number of a complete graph is equal to its number of vertices: $\\chi(K_n) = n$. For our case, if the graph were a complete graph $K_{12345}$, it would require 12345 colors.\n\n2.  **Condition: Not a Complete Graph:** The crucial piece of information is that $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This means there is at least one pair of vertices in $G$ that are not connected by an edge.\n\n3.  **Upper Bound on Chromatic Number:** For any simple graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, $\\chi(G) \\le n$. If $\\chi(G) = n$, then the graph must be the complete graph $K_n$. Since our graph $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. This gives us an initial upper bound: $\\chi(G) < 12345$, or $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\n4.  **Chromatic Number of Disconnected Graphs:** If a graph $G$ is disconnected and consists of connected components $G_1, G_2, \\dots, G_k$, its chromatic number is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components: $\\chi(G) = \\max\\{\\chi(G_1), \\chi(G_2), \\dots, \\chi(G_k)\\}$. This is a useful concept for constructing a graph that achieves the maximum possible chromatic number.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Final Answer\n\nWe will determine the maximum possible chromatic number by first establishing a strict upper bound and then showing that this bound can be achieved by a specific example.\n\n**Part 1: Establishing the Upper Bound**\n\nLet $G$ be a graph with $n=12345$ vertices. We are given that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n1.  Since $G$ is not a complete graph, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, such that there is no edge between them.\n2.  We want to show that $G$ can be colored with $n-1 = 12344$ colors. This would prove that $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n3.  Let's define a coloring scheme using $n-1$ colors, say $\\{c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{n-1}\\}$.\n4.  Assign the same color, $c_1$, to both vertices $u$ and $v$. This is a valid assignment because $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent.\n5.  The remaining $n-2$ vertices can each be assigned a unique color from the remaining $n-2$ available colors $\\{c_2, c_3, \\dots, c_{n-1}\\}$. This is always possible and creates a proper coloring for the subgraph of these $n-2$ vertices.\n6.  This procedure results in a proper coloring of the entire graph $G$ using at most $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colors.\n7.  Therefore, for any graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete, its chromatic number must satisfy $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThis shows that the maximum number of colors needed is at most 12344.\n\n**Part 2: Showing the Upper Bound is Achievable**\n\nNow, we need to demonstrate that there exists a graph $G$ (satisfying the given conditions) that actually requires 12344 colors.\n1.  Consider a graph $G$ constructed as the disjoint union of two graphs: a complete graph on $12344$ vertices, $K_{12344}$, and a single isolated vertex, $K_1$.\n2.  **Check the conditions for G:**\n    *   **Number of vertices:** The total number of vertices in $G$ is $12344 + 1 = 12345$. This matches the requirement.\n    *   **Is it a complete graph?** No. For $G$ to be $K_{12345}$, every vertex must be connected to every other vertex. In our construction, the isolated vertex is not connected to any of the vertices in the $K_{12344}$ component. So, $G \\neq K_{12345}$.\n3.  **Calculate the chromatic number of G:**\n    *   The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\n    *   The components are $K_{12344}$ and $K_1$.\n    *   $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n    *   $\\chi(K_1) = 1$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\chi(G) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nThis example shows that it is possible to have a graph with 12345 vertices, which is not a complete graph, and requires exactly 12344 colors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that any graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph can be colored with at most 12344 colors. We have also constructed a specific graph that satisfies these conditions and requires exactly 12344 colors. Therefore, the maximum number of colors that we need is 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
