Yes, changing the structure to incorporate a more substantial Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) group is a highly effective and standard strategy to increase the aqueous solubility of a hydrophobic molecule and would very likely solve the precipitation problem. The current probe's large hydrophobic regions (thioxanthenone and hexyl chain) outweigh its hydrophilic parts, causing it to precipitate. Adding more PEG units would increase the overall hydrophilicity, raising its solubility limit in the cell culture medium.
