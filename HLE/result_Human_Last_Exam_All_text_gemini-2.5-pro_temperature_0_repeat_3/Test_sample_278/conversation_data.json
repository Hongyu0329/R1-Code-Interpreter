    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parametric Curve**\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b \\sin t$\nfor $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nThe parameter `b` has a piecewise definition:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $b = 1$.\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $b = 5$.\n\nWe need to analyze the shape of the curve in these two intervals.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Part of the Curve ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$)**\n\nIn this interval, the equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 1 \\cdot \\sin t = \\sin t$\n\n*   **Equation:** We can see that $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of a unit circle centered at the origin.\n*   **Range:** As `t` varies from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n    *   $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(0) = 1$ to $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n    *   $y = \\sin t$ goes from $\\sin(0) = 0$ up to $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ and back down to $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\n*   **Conclusion:** This part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of the unit circle, where $y \\ge 0$. The x-values range from -1 to 1, and the y-values range from 0 to 1.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Part of the Curve ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$)**\n\nIn this interval, the equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 5 \\sin t$\n\n*   **Equation:** We can write this as $x = \\cos t$ and $y/5 = \\sin t$. Squaring and adding gives $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 (along the x-axis) and a semi-major axis of 5 (along the y-axis).\n*   **Range:** As `t` varies from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$:\n    *   $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$.\n    *   $y = 5 \\sin t$ goes from $5\\sin(\\pi) = 0$ down to $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ and back up to $5\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$.\n*   **Conclusion:** This part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse, where $y \\le 0$. The x-values range from -1 to 1, and the y-values range from -5 to 0.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Bounding Box of the Entire Figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that circumscribes the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates. This defines the smallest rectangle (bounding box) that contains the figure.\n\n*   **X-coordinates:**\n    *   In the first part, $x$ ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   In the second part, $x$ ranges from -1 to 1.\n    *   Therefore, the overall minimum x-value is $x_{min} = -1$ and the maximum is $x_{max} = 1$.\n    *   The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Y-coordinates:**\n    *   In the first part, $y$ ranges from 0 to 1.\n    *   In the second part, $y$ ranges from -5 to 0.\n    *   Therefore, the overall minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$ and the maximum is $y_{max} = 1$.\n    *   The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the Side Length of the Smallest Circumscribing Square**\n\nThe smallest square that can contain this figure must have a side length equal to the larger of the two dimensions of the bounding box (width and height).\n\n*   Side length of the square, $s = \\max(W, H)$.\n*   $s = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Area of the Square**\n\nThe area of a square with side length `s` is given by the formula $A = s^2$.\n\n*   $A = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is essential to correctly identify the range of x and y values for each piece of the curve.\n*   The overall range is the union of the ranges from the individual pieces.\n*   The side of the smallest circumscribing square is determined by the maximum dimension (width or height) of the figure, not the minimum.\n*   The question asks for the area of the square, not its side length.\n\nThe final answer is the area of a square with a side length of 6.\n\n<<<36>>>"
