    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the most likely mechanism responsible for two key outcomes after a gene duplication event in eukaryotes:\n1.  **Retention:** The process by which the new, duplicate copy of a gene is kept in the genome instead of being lost. The default fate of a redundant gene is often its inactivation and eventual loss (pseudogenization), so there must be a selective advantage to keeping it.\n2.  **Divergence:** The process by which the two gene copies (the original and the duplicate) accumulate differences in their DNA sequences over time, leading to them having different functions or different patterns of expression.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of the Answer Choices**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:**\n    *   **What it is:** A process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In a pair of duplicate genes, this would cause one copy to be \"overwritten\" by the other.\n    *   **Careful Points:** The effect of gene conversion is to homogenize the two copies, making them more similar or identical. This directly counteracts divergence. Therefore, it cannot be the primary mechanism for both retention *and* divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:**\n    *   **What it is:** The process where a gene copy accumulates deleterious mutations (e.g., stop codons, frameshifts) that render it non-functional. The gene becomes a \"pseudogene.\"\n    *   **Careful Points:** This is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not gene *retention* in a functional sense. It is the fate that a successful retention mechanism must avoid. Therefore, it is the opposite of what the question is asking for.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:**\n    *   **What it is:** A model where one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original function, while the other copy is initially redundant and free to accumulate mutations. By chance, some of these mutations might result in a new, beneficial function. Natural selection then preserves this second copy for its new role.\n    *   **Careful Points:** This model explains both retention (the new function is advantageous) and divergence (the gene must change to acquire the new function). However, the acquisition of a brand-new beneficial function is a rare event. During the potentially long waiting period for this to happen, the redundant gene copy is at high risk of being silenced by pseudogenization.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:**\n    *   **What it is:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in multiple tissues/times. After duplication, each copy can independently accumulate mutations that degrade different parts of its original function. For example, copy 1 might lose its function in the liver but keep it in the brain, while copy 2 loses its function in the brain but keeps it in the liver.\n    *   **Careful Points:** In this scenario, both copies become necessary to perform the complete set of functions of the original ancestral gene. This creates immediate selective pressure to retain both copies. This process inherently involves divergence, as the two copies lose different functional components. Because this mechanism relies on common degenerative mutations rather than rare beneficial ones, it provides a more rapid and probable pathway for preserving duplicate genes immediately after they arise.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:**\n    *   **What it is:** A macroevolutionary process where a single ancestral species rapidly diversifies into multiple new species, each adapted to a different ecological niche.\n    *   **Careful Points:** This is a pattern of evolution at the species level, not a molecular mechanism at the gene level. While gene duplication can provide the genetic variation that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not the mechanism that retains and diversifies the genes themselves within a genome. This answer operates at the wrong level of biological organization.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are valid models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, subfunctionalization is considered \"most likely\" because it provides a more immediate and common pathway to retention. It relies on frequent degenerative mutations to partition the ancestral function, quickly making both gene copies indispensable. Neofunctionalization, while important for creating novel functions, relies on rare beneficial mutations, making the duplicate gene vulnerable to loss before the new function can evolve. Therefore, subfunctionalization is the most probable mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of many duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
