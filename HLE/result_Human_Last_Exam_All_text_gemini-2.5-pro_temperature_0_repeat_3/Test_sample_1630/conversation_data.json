    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the properties of the polynomials f(x) and g(x).**\n\n*   $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 3.\n    Let $f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$ and $g(x) = b_3 x^3 + b_2 x^2 + b_1 x + b_0$, with $a_3, b_3 \\neq 0$.\n*   The derivatives $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n    *   $f'(x) = 3a_3 x^2 + 2a_2 x + a_1$. This is a quadratic polynomial. For it to be always positive, the parabola it represents must open upwards and not intersect the x-axis.\n        1.  The leading coefficient must be positive: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$.\n        2.  The discriminant must be negative: $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\n    *   Similarly, for $g'(x) = 3b_3 x^2 + 2b_2 x + b_1$, we must have $b_3 > 0$ and $b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n*   A function with a positive derivative is strictly increasing. Thus, both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions on the entire real line.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the equation for the fixed points.**\n\n*   We are looking for the number of fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$.\n*   A fixed point is a value of $x$ such that $h(x) = x$.\n*   So, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the degree of the equation.**\n\n*   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   The composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$.\n*   Degree of $h(x) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) - x = 0$. Since the leading term of $f(g(x))$ is $a_3(b_3x^3)^3 = a_3b_3^3x^9$, the polynomial $f(g(x)) - x$ is of degree 9.\n*   By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**Step 4: Investigate if 9 fixed points are achievable.**\n\nWe need to determine if it's possible to choose $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and result in 9 distinct real roots for $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**Method 1: Analysis using Rolle's Theorem**\n\n*   Let $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. We want to know if $k(x)=0$ can have 9 distinct real roots.\n*   If a differentiable function $k(x)$ has 9 distinct real roots, then by Rolle's Theorem, its derivative $k'(x)$ must have at least 8 distinct real roots.\n*   Let's find $k'(x)$:\n    $k'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$.\n*   Let's determine the degree of $k'(x)$.\n    *   $g(x)$ is degree 3, so $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   The product $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   So, $k'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots.\n*   This means it is algebraically possible for $k'(x)$ to have 8 distinct real roots, which is a necessary condition for $k(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots.\n*   For $k(x)$ to have 9 roots, we need to be able to choose $f$ and $g$ such that:\n    1.  $k'(x)=0$ has 8 distinct real roots, say $c_1 < c_2 < \\dots < c_8$. These are the critical points of $k(x)$.\n    2.  The values of $k(x)$ at these critical points, $k(c_i)$, must alternate in sign. (e.g., $k(c_1)>0, k(c_2)<0, \\dots$).\n    3.  The limits of $k(x)$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$ must also fit this pattern. The leading term of $k(x)$ is $a_3b_3^3x^9$. Since $a_3>0$ and $b_3>0$, the leading coefficient is positive. Thus, $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} k(x) = -\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} k(x) = +\\infty$.\n*   The existence of such polynomials is not trivial to prove from scratch, but there are no obvious contradictions. The 8 parameters defining $f$ and $g$ provide enough degrees of freedom to control the roots and values at critical points to achieve this configuration. The conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ are \"open conditions\" (defined by strict inequalities), which means small perturbations of the coefficients are allowed, making it possible to tune the polynomial to have the maximum number of roots.\n\n**Method 2: Geometric Interpretation using Bézout's Theorem**\n\n*   The equation $f(g(x)) = x$ can be seen as a system of two equations. Let $y = g(x)$. Then the original equation becomes $f(y) = x$.\n*   So we are looking for the number of real solutions $(x, y)$ to the system of polynomial equations:\n    1.  $y = g(x) \\implies y - g(x) = 0$\n    2.  $x = f(y) \\implies x - f(y) = 0$\n*   The first equation defines a plane algebraic curve of degree 3. The second equation also defines a plane algebraic curve of degree 3.\n*   By Bézout's Theorem, the number of intersection points of two plane curves of degrees $d_1$ and $d_2$ is at most $d_1 \\times d_2$, provided they don't share a common component.\n*   In our case, the maximum number of intersection points is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   Each distinct intersection point $(x_i, y_i)$ corresponds to a unique real root $x_i$ of the original equation $f(g(x))=x$.\n*   The question is whether it's possible for all 9 intersection points to be real and distinct, given the constraints on $f$ and $g$. The constraints $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ mean that the curves are graphs of strictly increasing functions. While this constrains the shape of the curves, it does not prevent them from intersecting up to 9 times. It has been shown that this bound is achievable.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBoth lines of reasoning lead to the same conclusion. The degree of the resulting polynomial equation is 9, which provides an upper bound of 9 solutions. There is no fundamental principle arising from the given conditions that would prevent this upper bound from being reached. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
