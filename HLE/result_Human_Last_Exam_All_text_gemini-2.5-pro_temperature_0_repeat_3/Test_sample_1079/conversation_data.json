    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Reflection Group of Type H3:** This is the finite Coxeter group `W(H3)`, which represents the symmetry group of the icosahedron and dodecahedron. Its order is `|W(H3)| = 120`.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** A fundamental invariant of a Coxeter group. For H3, the Coxeter number is given as `h = 10`.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector of a group element that does not lie on any of the reflection hyperplanes of the group.\n*   **Regular Element:** An element `w` in a reflection group is called regular if it possesses a regular eigenvector. A key theorem by Springer states that an element is regular if and only if it is conjugate to `c^k`, where `c` is a Coxeter element and `k` is an integer coprime to the Coxeter number `h`.\n*   **Coxeter Element (c):** A product of all simple reflections, taken in some order. For H3, with simple reflections `s_1, s_2, s_3`, a Coxeter element is `c = s_1s_2s_3`. All Coxeter elements in H3 are conjugate.\n*   **Exponents (m_j):** Another set of invariants for a Coxeter group. For H3, the dimension is 3, and the exponents are `m_1 = 1`, `m_2 = 5`, `m_3 = 9`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Question to Regular Elements**\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements `w` that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue `λ` of order 10.\nBased on the definition, an element has a regular eigenvector if and only if it is a regular element. So, we are looking for the number of regular elements `w` for which at least one of their regular eigenvalues has an order of 10.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Eigenvalues of Regular Elements in H3**\n\nLet `w` be a regular element. Then `w` is conjugate to `c^k` for some `k` such that `gcd(k, h) = gcd(k, 10) = 1`. The possible values for `k` (modulo 10) are {1, 3, 7, 9}.\nThe eigenvalues of a Coxeter element `c` are given by the formula `exp(2πi * m_j / h)`.\nFor H3, the eigenvalues of `c` are:\n*   `λ_1 = exp(2πi * 1 / 10)`\n*   `λ_2 = exp(2πi * 5 / 10) = exp(πi) = -1`\n*   `λ_3 = exp(2πi * 9 / 10)`\n\nThe eigenvalues of a regular element `w` (which is conjugate to `c^k`) are the `k`-th powers of the eigenvalues of `c`:\n*   `λ'_1 = (λ_1)^k = exp(2πi * k / 10)`\n*   `λ'_2 = (λ_2)^k = exp(πi * k) = (-1)^k`\n*   `λ'_3 = (λ_3)^k = exp(2πi * 9k / 10)`\n\n**Step 4: Identify Which Eigenvectors are Regular**\n\nA crucial theorem by Lehrer and Springer states that the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue `exp(2πi * m_j * k / h)` is regular if and only if `gcd(m_j, h) = 1`.\nLet's check this for H3, where `h=10` and the exponents are `m_1=1, m_2=5, m_3=9`:\n*   For `m_1 = 1`: `gcd(1, 10) = 1`. The eigenvector corresponding to `λ'_1` is **regular**.\n*   For `m_2 = 5`: `gcd(5, 10) = 5 ≠ 1`. The eigenvector corresponding to `λ'_2` is **not regular**.\n*   For `m_3 = 9`: `gcd(9, 10) = 1`. The eigenvector corresponding to `λ'_3` is **regular**.\n\nThis means that every regular element in H3 has exactly two regular eigenvectors.\n\n**Step 5: Check the Order of the Regular Eigenvalues**\n\nNow we must check if the eigenvalues corresponding to these regular eigenvectors have an order of 10.\n*   **Eigenvalue 1:** `λ'_1 = exp(2πi * k / 10)`. The order of this complex number is `10 / gcd(10, k)`. Since `w` is a regular element, we know `gcd(k, 10) = 1`. Therefore, the order is `10 / 1 = 10`.\n*   **Eigenvalue 2:** `λ'_3 = exp(2πi * 9k / 10)`. The order is `10 / gcd(10, 9k)`. Since `gcd(9, 10) = 1` and `gcd(k, 10) = 1`, it follows that `gcd(9k, 10) = 1`. Therefore, the order is `10 / 1 = 10`.\n\n**Conclusion from the analysis:** Every regular element in the group H3 has exactly two regular eigenvectors, and both of their corresponding eigenvalues have an order of 10. Therefore, the set of elements satisfying the condition in the question is precisely the set of all regular elements in H3.\n\n**Step 6: Count the Number of Regular Elements**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to counting the total number of regular elements in `W(H3)`.\nThe number of regular elements in a finite Coxeter group `W` is given by the formula:\nNumber of regular elements = `φ(h) * (|W| / h)`\nwhere `φ` is Euler's totient function.\n\nLet's plug in the values for H3:\n*   `|W| = 120`\n*   `h = 10`\n*   `φ(10) = 10 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 10 * (1/2) * (4/5) = 4`.\n\nNumber of regular elements = `4 * (120 / 10) = 4 * 12 = 48`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of elements satisfying the given condition is the total number of regular elements in the reflection group of type H3. This is calculated as `φ(10) * |H3| / 10 = 4 * 120 / 10 = 48`.\n\n<<<48>>>"
