    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecule\nFirst, we need to identify the number and type of atoms in the molecule.\n*   **Molecule:** Toluene\n*   **Chemical Formula:** C7H8\n*   This means the molecule consists of **7 Carbon (C) atoms** and **8 Hydrogen (H) atoms**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Basis Set (6-31G)\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). We need to interpret this notation for each type of atom in the molecule.\n\n**A. For a Carbon Atom (a second-row element):**\nThe 6-31G basis set treats core and valence electrons differently.\n*   **Core Orbitals (1s):** The \"6-\" part of the notation means each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is formed by a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n    *   Number of CGFs for the 1s core orbital = **1**\n*   **Valence Orbitals (2s and 2p):** The \"-31\" part indicates a \"split-valence\" basis set, where each valence atomic orbital is represented by two CGFs.\n    *   **Inner Valence Part:** The \"3\" means the inner part of the valence shell is described by CGFs made from **3** PGFs each. This gives one CGF for the 2s orbital and one set of CGFs for the 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n        *   Number of CGFs for the inner 2s orbital = 1\n        *   Number of CGFs for the inner 2p orbitals = 3 (one for each of 2px, 2py, 2pz)\n    *   **Outer Valence Part:** The \"1\" means the outer part of the valence shell is described by CGFs made from a single **1** PGF each (i.e., they are uncontracted). This also gives one CGF for the 2s orbital and one set for the 2p orbitals.\n        *   Number of CGFs for the outer 2s orbital = 1\n        *   Number of CGFs for the outer 2p orbitals = 3 (one for each of 2px, 2py, 2pz)\n\n*   **Total CGFs per Carbon Atom:**\n    *   For the 1s orbital: 1 CGF\n    *   For the 2s orbital: 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = 2 CGFs\n    *   For the 2p orbitals: 3 (inner) + 3 (outer) = 6 CGFs\n    *   **Total per C = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 CGFs**\n\n**B. For a Hydrogen Atom (a first-row element):**\nHydrogen has no core electrons, so only the valence part of the notation (\"-31\") applies.\n*   **Valence Orbital (1s):** The 1s orbital of hydrogen is split into two CGFs, just like the valence orbitals of carbon.\n    *   **Inner Part (\"3\"):** One CGF formed from **3** PGFs.\n    *   **Outer Part (\"1\"):** One CGF formed from **1** PGF.\n\n*   **Total CGFs per Hydrogen Atom:**\n    *   For the 1s orbital: 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Contracted Gaussian Functions\nNow, we combine the information from the previous steps to find the total for the entire toluene molecule.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon atoms:**\n    *   Number of Carbon atoms = 7\n    *   CGFs per Carbon atom = 9\n    *   Total from Carbon = 7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = **63 CGFs**\n\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   Number of Hydrogen atoms = 8\n    *   CGFs per Hydrogen atom = 2\n    *   Total from Hydrogen = 8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = **16 CGFs**\n\n*   **Total for Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   Total CGFs = (Total from Carbon) + (Total from Hydrogen)\n    *   Total CGFs = 63 + 16 = **79**\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Correct Atom Count:** Ensure you have the correct chemical formula (C7H8 for toluene).\n*   **Basis Set Interpretation:** Understand that the notation before the hyphen (e.g., \"6-\") applies to core orbitals, while the notation after the hyphen (e.g., \"-31\") applies to valence orbitals.\n*   **Hydrogen Exception:** Remember that hydrogen has no core electrons, so the core part of the basis set notation does not apply to it.\n*   **p-Orbitals:** A set of p-orbitals consists of three individual orbitals (px, py, pz). When the basis set describes a \"p-function\", it implies a function for each of these three, so you must multiply by 3.\n\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions used in a 6-31G calculation of toluene is 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
