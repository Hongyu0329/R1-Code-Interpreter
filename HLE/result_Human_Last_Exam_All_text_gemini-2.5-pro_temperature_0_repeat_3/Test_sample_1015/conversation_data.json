    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the primary technical difference in the execution of a *cambré derrière* (a backward bend) between two major ballet methodologies: Vaganova and Balanchine.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Terms**\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A bend of the upper body backward from the waist. The goal is to create an arch in the upper and middle back while maintaining stability in the lower body.\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A Russian ballet technique known for its precision, strength, and emphasis on core stability. It builds a strong, clean foundation with very specific rules for alignment and movement coordination.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** An American ballet style developed by George Balanchine, characterized by speed, athleticism, deep pliés, and a more \"neoclassical\" or stylized aesthetic. It often pushes classical lines to their extremes.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Vaganova Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Core Principle:** Stability and control.\n*   **Execution:** The bend originates from the upper back (thoracic spine). A key rule is to keep the hips squared and directly over the supporting legs/feet. The hips do **not** push forward. This isolates the stretch in the spine and requires immense back and core strength. The line is pure and controlled, emphasizing the strength and flexibility of the back itself. The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Balanchine Cambré Derrière**\n*   **Core Principle:** Dynamism and extreme lines.\n*   **Execution:** To achieve a deeper and more dramatic backbend, the Balanchine technique allows and encourages the **hips to press forward**, away from the heels. This creates a much deeper curve through the entire body. It changes the center of gravity and creates a visually striking, \"off-balance\" look that is a hallmark of the style. This forward hip placement is the most significant departure from the classical Vaganova approach.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Answer Choices based on the Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While arm styles (*port de bras*) can differ between the methods, this is not the most fundamental or defining difference for this specific movement. The core mechanical difference is in the torso and hips.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most accurate and critical point of difference. Vaganova insists on keeping the hips stable and aligned over the feet. Balanchine deliberately pushes the hips forward to increase the depth and change the aesthetic of the bend. This is the primary technical distinction.\n*   **C. Speed:** Balanchine's style is generally faster, but the speed of any given step is a choreographic choice. The technical *how* of the movement is distinct regardless of the tempo. Therefore, speed is a general characteristic, not the defining difference of the cambré technique itself.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The deeper backbend in the Balanchine style is a *result* of the technique, not the technique itself. The *reason* the backbend can be deeper is because of the forward hip placement. Therefore, \"Placement of hip\" is the cause, and \"Degree of backbend\" is the effect, making hip placement the more fundamental answer.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head placement is a natural continuation of the spinal curve. While the head may go further back in a Balanchine cambré (due to the deeper bend), its placement relative to the spine follows a similar principle. It is not the primary point of technical divergence.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe most significant and defining technical difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière is the action and placement of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
