    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, we must understand the key terms in the question.\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset $S$ of a group $G$ is called product-free if for any two elements $x, y \\in S$ (not necessarily distinct), their product $xy$ is not in $S$. A direct consequence is that the identity element $e$ cannot be in any product-free set.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MPFS):** A product-free set $S$ is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means that for any element $g \\in G \\setminus S$, the set $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is no longer product-free.\n*   **Filling a Group:** A subset $S \\subseteq G$ is said to *fill* $G$ if $G = S \\cup S^{-1} \\cup \\{e\\}$, where $S^{-1} = \\{s^{-1} \\mid s \\in S\\}$. This means every non-identity element of $G$ is either in $S$ or its inverse is in $S$.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group $G$ is *filled* if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in $G$ fills $G$.\n\n### Step 2: A Key Characterization of Filled Groups\n\nA crucial theorem simplifies the problem of identifying filled groups significantly. The theorem states:\n\n**Theorem:** A finite group $G$ is filled if and only if either:\n1.  $G$ is an elementary abelian 2-group (i.e., isomorphic to $(C_2)^n$ for some $n$), or\n2.  $G$ has a unique element of order 2.\n\nWe are looking for **nonabelian** groups of order $2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime. Such a group cannot be an elementary abelian 2-group. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding all nonabelian groups of order $2q^m$ that have a unique element of order 2.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Structure of Groups of Order $2q^m$\n\nLet $G$ be a group of order $|G| = 2q^m$, where $q$ is an odd prime and $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$. We use Sylow's theorems to analyze its structure.\n\n*   Let $n_q$ be the number of Sylow $q$-subgroups. $n_q$ must divide 2 and $n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$. Since $q$ is an odd prime, $n_q=2$ would imply $2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q$, which means $q$ divides 1, an impossibility. Thus, $n_q=1$. This means the Sylow $q$-subgroup, let's call it $Q$ (with $|Q|=q^m$), is unique and therefore normal in $G$.\n*   Let $n_2$ be the number of Sylow 2-subgroups. $|P|=2$ for any Sylow 2-subgroup $P$.\n\nSince $Q$ is a normal subgroup, $G$ is a semidirect product of $Q$ and a Sylow 2-subgroup $P \\cong C_2$.\nSo, $G \\cong Q \\rtimes P \\cong Q \\rtimes_\\phi C_2$, where $\\phi: C_2 \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(Q)$ is a homomorphism that defines the action of $P$ on $Q$.\n\n### Step 4: The \"Unique Element of Order 2\" Condition\n\nA standard result in group theory states that if a finite group has exactly one element of order 2, then that element must be in the center of the group.\n\nLet's apply this to our group $G = Q \\rtimes_\\phi C_2$. Let $C_2 = \\langle x \\mid x^2=e \\rangle$. The elements of $G$ can be written as pairs $(a, y)$ where $a \\in Q$ and $y \\in C_2$. The group operation is $(a_1, y_1)(a_2, y_2) = (a_1 \\phi(y_1)(a_2), y_1y_2)$. Let $\\alpha = \\phi(x) \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(Q)$.\n\n*   **Elements of order 2:** An element $(a, y)$ has order 2 if it's not the identity and $(a, y)^2 = (e_Q, e)$.\n    *   If $y=e$, $(a,e)^2 = (a^2, e)$. For this to be the identity, $a^2=e_Q$. Since $Q$ has odd order $q^m$, the only solution is $a=e_Q$. This gives the identity element, not an element of order 2.\n    *   If $y=x$, $(a,x)^2 = (a\\phi(x)(a), x^2) = (a\\alpha(a), e)$. For this to be the identity, we need $a\\alpha(a)=e_Q$.\n    So, the elements of order 2 are precisely the pairs $(a,x)$ where $a \\in Q$ satisfies $\\alpha(a) = a^{-1}$.\n\n*   **Centrality Condition:** Suppose $G$ has a unique element of order 2, say $g_0 = (a_0, x)$. This element must be central. Let's find the conditions for $(a_0, x)$ to be in $Z(G)$.\n    1.  It must commute with all elements of the form $(b, e)$ for any $b \\in Q$:\n        $(a_0, x)(b, e) = (a_0\\alpha(b), x)$\n        $(b, e)(a_0, x) = (ba_0, x)$\n        For these to be equal, we need $a_0\\alpha(b) = ba_0$, which implies $\\alpha(b) = a_0^{-1}ba_0$ for all $b \\in Q$.\n    2.  It must commute with $(e, x)$:\n        $(a_0, x)(e, x) = (a_0\\alpha(e), x^2) = (a_0, e)$\n        $(e, x)(a_0, x) = (e\\alpha(a_0), x^2) = (\\alpha(a_0), e)$\n        For these to be equal, we need $a_0 = \\alpha(a_0)$.\n\n*   **Combining the conditions:** From the centrality condition, we have $\\alpha(a_0) = a_0$. But for $(a_0, x)$ to be an element of order 2, we need $a_0\\alpha(a_0) = e_Q$. Substituting $\\alpha(a_0)=a_0$, we get $a_0^2 = e_Q$. Since $Q$ is a group of odd order, this forces $a_0 = e_Q$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on the structure:** The unique element of order 2 must be $(e_Q, x)$. For this element to be central, the condition $\\alpha(b) = a_0^{-1}ba_0$ becomes $\\alpha(b) = e_Q^{-1}be_Q = b$ for all $b \\in Q$. This means $\\alpha$ must be the identity automorphism on $Q$.\nIf $\\alpha = \\operatorname{id}_Q$, the semidirect product is a **direct product**.\nTherefore, a group of order $2q^m$ has a unique element of order 2 if and only if it is isomorphic to a direct product $Q \\times C_2$.\n\n### Step 5: The Nonabelian Condition and Final Classification\n\nWe have established that the filled groups we seek must be of the form $G \\cong Q \\times C_2$, where $|Q|=q^m$.\nThe question requires the group to be **nonabelian**.\nA direct product of two groups is nonabelian if and only if at least one of the groups is nonabelian. Since $C_2$ is abelian, $G = Q \\times C_2$ is nonabelian if and only if $Q$ is nonabelian.\n\nThe final piece is to determine for which values of $m$ a nonabelian group of order $q^m$ (for odd prime $q$) exists.\n*   If $m=1$, any group of prime order $q$ is isomorphic to $C_q$, which is abelian.\n*   If $m=2$, any group of order $q^2$ is abelian (isomorphic to $C_{q^2}$ or $C_q \\times C_q$).\n*   If $m \\ge 3$, there exist nonabelian groups of order $q^m$. For example, for $m=3$, there is a nonabelian group of order $q^3$ consisting of upper-triangular matrices with 1s on the diagonal over the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Final Answer Synthesis\n\nCombining all the steps:\n1.  The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ are those with a unique element of order 2.\n2.  This property forces the group structure to be a direct product $Q \\times C_2$, where $|Q|=q^m$.\n3.  The nonabelian condition requires that $Q$ be a nonabelian group.\n4.  Nonabelian groups of order $q^m$ (for odd prime $q$) exist if and only if $m \\ge 3$.\n\nThus, the groups we are looking for are the direct products of any nonabelian group of order $q^m$ (where $q$ is an odd prime and $m \\ge 3$) with the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are the groups of the form $Q \\times C_2$, where $Q$ is any nonabelian group of order $q^m$. Such groups exist if and only if $m \\ge 3$.>>>"
