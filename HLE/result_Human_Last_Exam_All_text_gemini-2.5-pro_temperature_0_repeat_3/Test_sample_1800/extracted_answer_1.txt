A Ni/Ce molar ratio of approximately 1/3 (or 0.33) is widely considered ideal for maximizing the catalytic performance of Ni-Ceria nanoparticles in both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting reactions. This ratio optimizes the synergistic interaction between the Ni active sites and the Ceria support, maximizing the density of the crucial Ni-Ceria interface. This enhances catalytic activity while maintaining good Ni dispersion and stability, preventing deactivation from sintering or undesirable side reactions.
