    "An analysis of the user's request follows.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Initial State:** A single integer variable `x` is initialized to `0`.\n2.  **Input:**\n    *   The first line of input is an integer `n`, representing the total number of statements to be executed.\n    *   The next `n` lines each contain a single statement.\n3.  **Statements:** A statement consists of one variable `X` and one operation (`++` or `--`). The order is not fixed. This gives four possible valid statements:\n    *   `++X` (prefix increment)\n    *   `X++` (postfix increment)\n    *   `--X` (prefix decrement)\n    *   `X--` (postfix decrement)\n4.  **Operations:**\n    *   `++` increases the value of `x` by 1.\n    *   `--` decreases the value of `x` by 1.\n5.  **Goal:** Execute all `n` statements in sequence and print the final value of `x`.\n\n### Analysis of the Submitted Java Program\n\n1.  **Code Logic:** The program reads the integer `n` (named `t`). It initializes a result variable `tresult` to `0`. It then enters a `while` loop that runs `n` times. Inside the loop, it reads a statement as a `String`.\n2.  **Conditional Checks:** The core logic lies in these two `if` statements:\n    ```java\n    if (test.contains(\"++X\"))\n    {\n        tresult++;\n    }\n    if (test.contains(\"--X\"))\n    {\n        tresult--;\n    }\n    ```\n3.  **Identifying the Flaw:** The problem states that the operation and variable can be in any order. The valid increment statements are `++X` and `X++`. The valid decrement statements are `--X` and `X--`.\n    *   The code checks for the substring `\"++X\"`. This will correctly identify the statement `++X` but will fail to identify `X++`.\n    *   Similarly, the code checks for `\"--X\"` and will fail to identify `X--`.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Because the program does not handle the postfix versions of the operations (`X++` and `X--`), it will produce an incorrect result for any input that includes them. Therefore, the program does not solve the problem correctly.\n\n### Rewriting in C for Maximum Efficiency\n\nTo solve this problem correctly and efficiently, we should find a common feature among the statements.\n\n*   Increment statements: `++X`, `X++`\n*   Decrement statements: `--X`, `X--`\n\nNotice that in all four cases, the character at the middle position (index 1) uniquely identifies the operation.\n*   If `statement[1]` is `'+'`, it's an increment operation.\n*   If `statement[1]` is `'-'`, it's a decrement operation.\n\nThis allows for a very simple and fast check, avoiding complex string comparisons.\n\n### Calculating Efficiency Metrics (x and y)\n\nThe required answer format is `Nx+y`.\n*   `N`: Because the provided program is incorrect.\n*   `x`: The smallest number of character comparisons for an input of 100 instructions.\n*   `y`: The smallest memory size in Bytes.\n\n**Calculating `x` (Character Comparisons):**\nUsing the efficient method identified above, for each of the 100 instructions, we only need to perform one character comparison: `if (statement[1] == '+')`.\n*   Total comparisons = 100 instructions * 1 comparison/instruction = 100.\n*   Therefore, `x = 100`.\n\n**Calculating `y` (Smallest Memory Size):**\nTo write the most memory-efficient C program, we must minimize the variables we declare.\n1.  We need a variable to store the number of statements, `n`. An `int` is sufficient (4 bytes).\n2.  We need a variable to accumulate the result, `x`. An `int` is sufficient (4 bytes).\n3.  We need to read the input statements. We can read each statement into a small character buffer (e.g., `char statement[4];` which is 4 bytes) inside the loop. However, to achieve the absolute minimum memory footprint for variables, we can avoid declaring a buffer entirely by reading characters one by one and only processing the one we need.\nA minimal C program would only require variables for `n` and `x`.\n*   Memory for `int n`: 4 bytes\n*   Memory for `int x`: 4 bytes\n*   Total minimum memory = 4 + 4 = 8 bytes.\n*   Therefore, `y = 8`.\n\nCombining these parts, the final answer is `N100+8`.\n\n<<<N100+8>>>"
