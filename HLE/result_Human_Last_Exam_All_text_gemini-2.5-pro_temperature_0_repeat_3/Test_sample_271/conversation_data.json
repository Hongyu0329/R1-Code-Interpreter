    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial and find its splitting field K.**\n\nLet $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe first try to find simple roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are divisors of 6. Testing them shows none are roots.\nLet's test for roots of the form $\\sqrt{a}$. Let $x = \\sqrt{a}$.\n$f(\\sqrt{a}) = a^3\\sqrt{a} - 2a^2\\sqrt{a} - 9a\\sqrt{a} + 3a + 18\\sqrt{a} - 6 = 0$\nThis can be written as:\n$\\sqrt{a}(a^3 - 2a^2 - 9a + 18) + (3a - 6) = 0$.\nFor this equation to hold for a rational $\\sqrt{a}$, both terms must be zero.\nFrom the second term, $3a - 6 = 0 \\implies a = 2$.\nLet's check if $a=2$ satisfies the first term: $2^3 - 2(2^2) - 9(2) + 18 = 8 - 8 - 18 + 18 = 0$.\nIt does. So $x = \\sqrt{2}$ is a root of $f(x)$.\nSince $f(x)$ has rational coefficients, if $\\sqrt{2}$ is a root, then $-\\sqrt{2}$ must also be a root.\nThis implies that $(x - \\sqrt{2})(x + \\sqrt{2}) = x^2 - 2$ is a factor of $f(x)$.\nWe perform polynomial long division to find the other factor:\n$(x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6) \\div (x^2 - 2) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nSo, $f(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$.\n\nLet $g(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nThe splitting field of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, denoted by $K$, is the smallest field containing all roots of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$.\nThe splitting field of $g(x)$ is $K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nLet's analyze $h(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$.\n1. $3 \\nmid 1$ (the leading coefficient).\n2. $3$ divides all other coefficients: $0, 0, -9, 3$.\n3. $3^2 = 9 \\nmid 3$ (the constant term).\nThus, $h(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of K over $\\mathbb{Q}$.**\n\nLet $K_h$ be the splitting field of $h(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of $S_5$. Since $h(x)$ is irreducible of degree 5, the order of the Galois group is divisible by 5.\nLet's find the number of real roots of $h(x)$.\n$h'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $h'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n$h(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (9/5)^{5/4} - 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = (9/5)^{1/4}(9/5 - 9) + 3 = (9/5)^{1/4}(-36/5) + 3 < 0$.\n$h(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = -(9/5)^{5/4} + 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = (9/5)^{1/4}(36/5) + 3 > 0$.\nSince the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $h(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots. This means it has 2 complex conjugate roots.\nFor an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, if it has exactly two non-real roots, its Galois group is the symmetric group $S_p$. Here $p=5$, so the Galois group of $h(x)$ is $\\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$. The degree of the extension is $[K_h:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\nThe splitting field of $f(x)$ is $K = K_g K_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\text{roots of } h(x))$.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q})$ if $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We need to check if $\\sqrt{2} \\in K_h$.\nThe only quadratic subfield of $K_h$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_h})$, where $\\Delta_h$ is the discriminant of $h(x)$.\nThe discriminant of $x^n+ax+b$ is $\\Delta = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{n-1}(n-1)^{n-1}a^n)$.\nFor $h(x)=x^5-9x+3$, $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$\\Delta_h = (-1)^{10}(5^5 3^4 + (-1)^4 4^4 (-9)^5) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe quadratic subfield is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$. This is an imaginary quadratic field.\nSince $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real field, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$.\nThus, $\\sqrt{2} \\notin K_h$, and $K_g \\cap K_h = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo, the Galois group of $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe order of the group is $|G| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 3: Find all normal subgroups of G and their indices.**\n\nWe are looking for normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these correspond to proper, non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$. The degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H]$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{id\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ include subgroups of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\unlhd G_1$ and $N_2 \\unlhd G_2$.\n1.  $H = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $|H|=60$. $[G:H] = 240/60 = 4$.\n2.  $H = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $|H|=120$. $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n3.  $H = C_2 \\times \\{id\\}$: This is the center $Z(G)$. $|H|=2$. $[G:H] = 240/2 = 120$.\n4.  $H = C_2 \\times A_5$: $|H|=2 \\times 60 = 120$. $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThere can also be \"diagonal\" normal subgroups. Let's consider the homomorphism $\\phi: C_2 \\times S_5 \\to C_2$ defined by $\\phi(c, \\sigma) = c \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$, where we identify $C_2$ with the multiplicative group $\\{-1, 1\\}$. This is a group homomorphism. Its kernel is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n$\\ker(\\phi) = \\{(c, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid c \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = 1\\}$.\nThis condition is met if ($c=1$ and $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)=1$) or ($c=-1$ and $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)=-1$).\nSo, $\\ker(\\phi) = (\\{1\\} \\times A_5) \\cup (\\{-1\\} \\times (S_5 \\setminus A_5))$.\nThe size of this subgroup is $|A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n5.  $H = \\ker(\\phi)$: $|H|=120$. $[G:H] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\nThese are all the proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$.\n\n**Step 4: List the possible degrees.**\n\nThe possible degrees of the normal intermediate extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ are the indices $[G:H]$ we calculated.\n- From $H = C_2 \\times \\{id\\}$, the degree is 120.\n- From $H = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$, the degree is 4.\n- From $H = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$, $H = C_2 \\times A_5$, and $H = \\ker(\\phi)$, the degree is 2.\n\nThe set of all possible degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
