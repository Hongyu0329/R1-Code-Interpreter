    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` for a linear system defined by matrices `A` and `B`. The purpose of this feedback is to place the eigenvalues of the resulting closed-loop system, `A + BF`, at specific locations in the complex plane.\n\nGiven matrices:\n`A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nDesired eigenvalues (poles): `λ = -1 ± j`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe characteristic polynomial of a system determines its eigenvalues. If the desired eigenvalues are `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`, the desired characteristic polynomial, `P_desired(λ)`, is:\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ - λ1)(λ - λ2)`\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`P_desired(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the algebraic identity `(x - y)(x + y) = x^2 - y^2`:\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) - (-1)`\n`P_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Closed-Loop System and its Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe state feedback control law is typically `u = -Fx`, leading to the closed-loop state equation `x_dot = (A - BF)x`. However, the problem is formulated as finding `F` for `A + BF`. We will follow this formulation.\n\nLet the feedback gain matrix `F` be a 2x2 matrix:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n\nFirst, calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]] = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNext, form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\nNow, find the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl`, which is `P_actual(λ) = det(λI - A_cl)`. For a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]`, the characteristic polynomial is `λ^2 - (a+d)λ + (ad-bc) = λ^2 - trace(M)λ + det(M)`.\n`trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1`\n`det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) * f2 - (1 + f2 + 2*f4) * (1 + f1)`\n`det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n`det(A_cl) = -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n\nSo, the actual characteristic polynomial is:\n`P_actual(λ) = λ^2 - (f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n\n**Step 4: Match the Coefficients and Solve for F**\nWe equate the coefficients of `P_actual(λ)` with `P_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n\n1.  **Coefficient of λ:**\n    `- (f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1) = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1 = -2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1`  (Equation 1)\n\n2.  **Constant term:**\n    `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This indicates that the solution for `F` is not unique. We can find a particular solution by making simplifying assumptions.\n\n**Careful Point:** The non-uniqueness of the solution is expected for multi-input systems. The system is controllable since `rank(B) = 2`, which is the dimension of the state space, so a solution is guaranteed to exist.\n\nLet's simplify the problem by setting `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\nThe equations become:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nThis is now a simple system of two linear equations in two variables.\nAdding the two equations together:\n`(f1 + f2) + (-f1 - 2*f2) = -1 + 3`\n`-f2 = 2`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` back into the first simplified equation:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nSo, a valid feedback gain matrix is `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`.\n\n**Step 5: Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\nLet's check our result.\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\n\nThe characteristic equation is `det(λI - A_cl) = 0`:\n`det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`\nThis is exactly the desired characteristic polynomial. The roots are `λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8))/2 = -1 ± j`. The calculation is correct.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
