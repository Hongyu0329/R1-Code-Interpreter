    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Who:** Two specific individuals.\n*   **What:** They are Nobel laureates.\n*   **Where:** They were featured in a commercial.\n*   **For whom:** The commercial was for Enron.\n*   **When:** The commercial aired in 2000.\n*   **Key Detail:** The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Ad Campaign**\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a real, high-profile advertising effort by Enron in 2000. The goal was to portray Enron not just as an energy company, but as an innovative, intelligent, and forward-thinking corporation that challenged conventional wisdom. The commercials featured various thought leaders.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Nobel Laureates Involved**\nResearch into this specific ad campaign reveals the names of the participants. Among them, two figures are Nobel laureates in Economic Sciences.\n\n*   **Individual 1: Merton Miller.**\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** We must verify his Nobel status. Merton Miller won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990. Therefore, he was already a Nobel laureate at the time the commercial aired in 2000.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** Merton Miller passed away in June 2000, the same year the campaign was launched, adding a poignant layer to his appearance.\n\n*   **Individual 2: Paul Krugman.**\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** We must verify his Nobel status and the timing. Paul Krugman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008.\n    *   **Careful Point 2 (Crucial Nuance):** This means that at the time the commercial was made in 2000, Paul Krugman was a prominent economist but *not yet* a Nobel laureate. The question asks which two \"Nobel laureates\" were featured, which is true of their current status, even if one of them hadn't received the award at the time. This is a common trivia point associated with this commercial.\n\n**Step 4: Understand the \"Infamous\" Nature of the Commercial**\nThe commercial became infamous after Enron's massive accounting fraud was exposed, leading to its collapse in 2001. The tagline \"Ask Why\" became deeply ironic, as the company's success was built on deception that crumbled under scrutiny. The participation of respected figures like Miller and Krugman was later viewed critically, as it lent credibility to a fraudulent enterprise.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Final Answer**\nBased on the analysis, the two Nobel laureates featured in Enron's 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial were Merton Miller (who was a laureate at the time) and Paul Krugman (who would become a laureate later).\n\n***\n\nThe two Nobel laureates featured in the commercial were:\n1.  **Merton Miller**\n2.  **Paul Krugman**\n\n<<<Merton Miller and Paul Krugman>>>"
