The set of all solutions for $z$ is given by the formula:
$z = i \frac{W_n(-\pi(\frac{1}{2} + 2k))}{\pi(\frac{1}{2} + 2k)}$
for all integers $k, n \in \mathbb{Z}$, where $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function.
This set includes the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, as well as an infinite number of purely imaginary solutions and other complex solutions.
