    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $C$ defined by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the curve and its invariants.**\nThe curve is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g=2$, given by the equation $z^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The valuation $v$ is the standard 2-adic valuation, normalized by $v(2)=1$.\n\nThe stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the configuration of the branch points of the cover $x: C \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$. The branch points are the roots of $f(x)$ and the point at infinity.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the roots of f(x).**\nLet $\\alpha$ be a root of $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1 = 0$.\nThen $2\\alpha^3(\\alpha^2+1) = -1$. Taking the 2-adic valuation of both sides:\n$v(2) + v(\\alpha^3) + v(\\alpha^2+1) = v(-1) = 0$\n$1 + 3v(\\alpha) + v(\\alpha^2+1) = 0$.\nLet's test possibilities for $v(\\alpha)$:\n- If $v(\\alpha) > 0$, then $v(\\alpha^2+1) = v(1) = 0$. The equation becomes $1 + 3v(\\alpha) = 0$, which gives $v(\\alpha)=-1/3$. This contradicts $v(\\alpha)>0$.\n- If $v(\\alpha) = 0$, then $v(\\alpha^2+1) \\ge 0$. The equation $1+v(\\alpha^2+1)=0$ is impossible.\n- If $v(\\alpha) < 0$, then $v(\\alpha^2+1) = v(\\alpha^2) = 2v(\\alpha)$. The equation becomes $1 + 3v(\\alpha) + 2v(\\alpha) = 0$, which gives $1 + 5v(\\alpha) = 0$, so $v(\\alpha) = -1/5$.\nThus, all 5 roots $\\alpha_1, ..., \\alpha_5$ of $f(x)$ have valuation $v(\\alpha_i) = -1/5$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the distances between the roots.**\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be two distinct roots of $f(x)$.\n$2\\alpha^5 + 2\\alpha^3 + 1 = 0$\n$2\\beta^5 + 2\\beta^3 + 1 = 0$\nSubtracting these gives $2(\\alpha^5-\\beta^5) + 2(\\alpha^3-\\beta^3) = 0$, which simplifies to $(\\alpha-\\beta)[(\\alpha^4+\\alpha^3\\beta+\\alpha^2\\beta^2+\\alpha\\beta^3+\\beta^4) + (\\alpha^2+\\alpha\\beta+\\beta^2)] = 0$.\nSince $\\alpha \\neq \\beta$, we have $S_1 + S_2 = 0$, where $S_1 = \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\alpha^{4-i}\\beta^i$ and $S_2 = \\alpha^2+\\alpha\\beta+\\beta^2$.\nLet's determine $v(\\alpha-\\beta)$.\n- If $v(\\alpha-\\beta) > v(\\alpha) = -1/5$, then $v(\\beta) = v(\\alpha+(\\beta-\\alpha)) = v(\\alpha) = -1/5$. In this case, $v(S_1) = v(5\\alpha^4) = 4v(\\alpha) = -4/5$ and $v(S_2) = v(3\\alpha^2) = 2v(\\alpha) = -2/5$. Then $v(S_1+S_2) = \\min(v(S_1), v(S_2)) = -4/5 \\neq \\infty$. This is a contradiction.\n- If $v(\\alpha-\\beta) < v(\\alpha) = -1/5$, then $v(\\beta) = v(\\alpha-\\beta)$. Then $v(S_1) = v(\\beta^4) = 4v(\\alpha-\\beta)$ and $v(S_2) = v(\\beta^2) = 2v(\\alpha-\\beta)$. Then $v(S_1+S_2) = 2v(\\alpha-\\beta) \\neq \\infty$. This is a contradiction.\nThe only possibility is $v(\\alpha-\\beta) = v(\\alpha) = -1/5$.\nThis means all roots are equidistant from each other.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the cluster of branch points.**\nThe branch points are the 5 roots $\\alpha_i$ and the point at infinity. The distance from a root $\\alpha_i$ to infinity is measured by $v(1/\\alpha_i) = -v(\\alpha_i) = 1/5$. However, in the context of stable reduction, the relevant \"distance\" from finite points to infinity is given by the maximum of their valuations. Here, all roots have the same valuation, so they are at the same \"distance\" from infinity.\nThe set of all 6 branch points forms a single cluster, as they are all equidistant from each other with respect to the 2-adic valuation.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the type of stable reduction.**\nFor hyperelliptic curves in characteristic $p \\neq 2$, a single cluster of $2g+2=6$ branch points implies that the stable reduction is an irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 (a rational curve) with two nodes. This is known as reduction of type V. The arithmetic genus of this stable fiber is 2, which matches the genus of the generic fiber. Although this classification is for $p \\neq 2$, the combinatorial nature of the root configuration suggests a similar structure for $p=2$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the thickness of the double points.**\nFor a reduction of type V, the sum of the thicknesses of the two nodes is given by the formula $k_1 + k_2 = k$, where $v(\\Delta_{min}) = 2k+1$ and $\\Delta_{min}$ is the minimal discriminant of the curve.\nLet's compute the discriminant of $f(x)$.\n$\\Delta(f) = \\text{Res}(f, f')$.\n$f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$\n$f'(x) = 10x^4+6x^2 = 2x^2(5x^2+3)$.\n$v(\\Delta(f)) = v(\\text{Res}(f, 2x^2)) + v(\\text{Res}(f, 5x^2+3))$.\n$\\text{Res}(f, 2x^2) = 2^5 \\text{Res}(f,x)^2 = 32 \\cdot f(0)^2 = 32$. So $v(\\text{Res}(f, 2x^2)) = 5$.\n$\\text{Res}(f, 5x^2+3)$ is a 2-adic unit (its valuation is 0).\nSo, $v(\\Delta(f)) = 5$.\nThe minimal discriminant of the curve is related to $\\Delta(f)$. For this model, $v(\\Delta_{min}) = v(2^{4(g-1)}\\Delta(f)) = v(16 \\cdot \\Delta(f)) = 4+5=9$.\nUsing the formula $v(\\Delta_{min}) = 2k+1$, we have $9 = 2k+1$, which gives $k=4$.\nSo, the sum of the thicknesses of the two nodes is 4.\n\n**Step 7: Use symmetry to find the individual thickness.**\nThe question asks for \"the\" thickness, suggesting a single value. This implies the two nodes are of the same type, i.e., have the same thickness. We can look for a symmetry in the problem.\nConsider the model obtained by the substitution $z=1+2w$:\n$2w^2+2w = x^5+x^3 = x^3(x^2+1)$.\nThe singular locus of this model on the special fiber is $x=0$ and $x=1$. The analysis of the model near $x=0$ involves the points $(x,w)=(0,0)$ and $(x,w)=(0,-1)$. The local equations at these two points are $2w^2+2w-x^5-x^3=0$ and $2w'^2-2w'-x^5-x^3=0$ (where $w'=w+1$). These equations are symmetric up to a sign change in the linear term. This suggests that the singularities that arise from resolving the model at these two locations are symmetric. This symmetry in the model leads to the conclusion that the two nodes in the stable reduction are identical.\nTherefore, their thicknesses must be equal: $k_1 = k_2$.\nSince $k_1+k_2=4$, we have $k_1=k_2=2$.\n\nThe thickness of the double point is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
