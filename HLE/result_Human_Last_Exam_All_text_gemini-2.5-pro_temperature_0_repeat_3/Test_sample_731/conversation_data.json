    "An analysis of the question to find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^k$, denoted $SD_{2^k}$, is defined by the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^k} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{k-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{k-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    The question specifies the size is 512. Since $512 = 2^9$, we are dealing with the group $SD_{2^9}$, so $k=9$.\n    The presentation for our group $G = SD_{512}$ is:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$ and $sr^j$ for $0 \\le j < 256$. The order of the group is $2 \\times 256 = 512$. The cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ has order 256.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $m$ such that $H$ is the set of all $m$-th powers of elements in $G$. This set is denoted by $G^m = \\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of $G$ that can be expressed in the form $G^m$ for some integer $m$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the $m$-th powers of elements in $G = SD_{512}$**\n\nWe need to compute $g^m$ for every $g \\in G$. The elements of $G$ are of two types: those in $\\langle r \\rangle$ and those in the coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n1.  **Powers of elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$**: For an element $r^i \\in \\langle r \\rangle$, its $m$-th power is $(r^i)^m = r^{im}$. The set of all such powers is $\\{r^{im} \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\}$, which forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^m \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Powers of elements in $s\\langle r \\rangle$**: For an element $sr^j \\in s\\langle r \\rangle$, we first compute its square:\n    $(sr^j)^2 = sr^j s r^j$. Using the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we can derive $sr^j s = r^{127j}$.\n    So, $(sr^j)^2 = (sr^j s) r^j = r^{127j} r^j = r^{128j}$.\n    Now we can compute $(sr^j)^m$:\n    *   If $m$ is even, let $m=2k$.\n        $(sr^j)^m = ((sr^j)^2)^k = (r^{128j})^k = r^{128jk}$.\n    *   If $m$ is odd, let $m=2k+1$.\n        $(sr^j)^m = (sr^j)^{2k}(sr^j) = ((sr^j)^2)^k (sr^j) = (r^{128j})^k sr^j = r^{128jk} sr^j$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the power set $G^m$**\n\nWe analyze $G^m = \\{ (r^i)^m \\} \\cup \\{ (sr^j)^m \\}$ based on the parity of $m$.\n\n**Case 1: $m$ is odd**\nLet $m=2k+1$.\n*   The set of powers from $\\langle r \\rangle$ is $\\langle r^m \\rangle$. Since $m$ is odd, $\\text{gcd}(m, 256) = 1$. Thus, $\\langle r^m \\rangle = \\langle r \\rangle$.\n*   The set of powers from $s\\langle r \\rangle$ is $\\{r^{128jk}sr^j \\mid 0 \\le j < 256\\}$. Since $m=2k+1$, we have $k=(m-1)/2$. The powers are $\\{r^{64j(m-1)}sr^j\\}$.\n    *   If $m \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, then $m-1$ is a multiple of 4. So $64(m-1)$ is a multiple of $64 \\times 4 = 256$. The term $r^{64j(m-1)}$ becomes $1$. Thus, $(sr^j)^m = sr^j$ for all $j$.\n    *   If $m \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, then $m-1 = 4p+2$ for some integer $p$. The exponent becomes $64j(4p+2) = 256jp + 128j \\equiv 128j \\pmod{256}$. So $(sr^j)^m = r^{128j}sr^j$.\n        - If $j$ is even ($j=2l$), $(sr^{2l})^m = r^{128(2l)}sr^{2l} = r^{256l}sr^{2l} = sr^{2l}$.\n        - If $j$ is odd ($j=2l+1$), $(sr^{2l+1})^m = r^{128(2l+1)}sr^{2l+1} = r^{128}sr^{2l+1}$.\n        The set of these powers is $\\{sr^{2l}\\} \\cup \\{r^{128}sr^{2l+1}\\}$. It can be shown that this set is precisely the entire coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$. For any $sr^k$, if $k$ is even it is in the first part. If $k$ is odd, one can solve $sr^k = r^{128}sr^{2l+1}$ for $l$, which shows it is in the second part.\n\nIn both subcases for odd $m$, the set of powers from $s\\langle r \\rangle$ is the entire coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$.\nTherefore, for any odd $m$, $G^m = \\langle r \\rangle \\cup s\\langle r \\rangle = G$.\nThis gives us one power subgroup: the group $G$ itself.\n\n**Case 2: $m$ is even**\nLet $m=2k$.\n*   The set of powers from $\\langle r \\rangle$ is $\\langle r^m \\rangle$.\n*   The set of powers from $s\\langle r \\rangle$ is $\\{r^{128jk} \\mid 0 \\le j < 256\\}$. This is the set of powers of $r^{128k} = r^{64m}$. This forms the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{64m} \\rangle$.\nSo, $G^m = \\langle r^m \\rangle \\cup \\langle r^{64m} \\rangle$.\nSince $r^{64m} = (r^m)^{64}$, the subgroup $\\langle r^{64m} \\rangle$ is contained within $\\langle r^m \\rangle$.\nThus, for any even $m$, $G^m = \\langle r^m \\rangle$.\n\nWe need to find the number of distinct subgroups of the form $\\langle r^m \\rangle$ where $m$ is even.\nThe subgroup $\\langle r^k \\rangle$ in $\\langle r \\rangle$ is determined by $\\text{gcd}(k, 256)$.\nSo we are looking for the number of distinct subgroups $\\langle r^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\text{gcd}(m, 256)$ for some even integer $m$.\nSince $m$ is even, $d = \\text{gcd}(m, 256)$ must be an even number.\nThe divisors of $256 = 2^8$ are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \\dots, 2^8$.\nThe even divisors are $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8$.\nThese are the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\nThere are 8 such divisors. Each of these values of $d$ gives a distinct subgroup $\\langle r^d \\rangle$. For each such $d$, we can simply choose $m=d$ (which is even) to generate the subgroup.\nThe 8 distinct power subgroups obtained from even values of $m$ are:\n1.  $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$\n2.  $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$\n3.  $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$\n4.  $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$\n5.  $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$\n6.  $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$\n7.  $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$\n8.  $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup)\n\n**Step 4: Count the total number of distinct power subgroups**\n\nCombining the results from both cases:\n*   From odd values of $m$, we get 1 power subgroup: $G$.\n*   From even values of $m$, we get 8 distinct power subgroups: $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\{1\\}$.\n\nThese two sets of subgroups are disjoint, as $G$ is non-cyclic and the others are all cyclic subgroups of $\\langle r \\rangle$.\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is $1 + 8 = 9$."
