    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question and Identify Careful Points**\n    *   The question asks for the \"4-point DFT\" of an 8-point sequence `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Ambiguity.** A DFT of length N is typically defined for a sequence of length N. Applying a \"4-point DFT\" to an 8-point sequence is not a standard, well-defined operation. It could imply several things:\n        *   Truncating the sequence to its first 4 points and finding its 4-point DFT.\n        *   Decimating (downsampling) the 8-point sequence to a 4-point sequence and finding its DFT.\n        *   Applying time-domain aliasing (folding) to the 8-point sequence to create a 4-point sequence.\n        *   A typo in the question, where \"4-point DFT\" should have been \"8-point DFT\".\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Context.** The problem provides the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` for the sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`. The target sequence `y(n)` is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`. This structure is a classic setup for a Decimation-In-Time (DIT) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) problem. In this context, the 8-point DFT of `y(n)` can be calculated directly from `X(k)` and `H(k)`. This suggests that the most likely intention of the question is to find the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. Any other interpretation would either ignore some of the given information (e.g., `H(k)`) or require unnecessarily converting `X(k)` and `H(k)` back to the time domain.\n    *   **Conclusion:** We will proceed by assuming the question intended to ask for the 8-point DFT of the 8-point sequence, as this provides the most coherent solution that utilizes all the given information as presented.\n\n2.  **Relate the 8-point DFT to the given 4-point DFTs**\n    *   Let the 8-point sequence be `y(n)`. Its 8-point DFT is `Y(k)`.\n    *   The even-indexed samples of `y(n)` form the sequence `x(n)`:\n        `y(2n) = {y(0), y(2), y(4), y(6)} = {x(0), x(1), x(2), x(3)} = x(n)`\n    *   The odd-indexed samples of `y(n)` form the sequence `h(n)`:\n        `y(2n+1) = {y(1), y(3), y(5), y(7)} = {h(0), h(1), h(2), h(3)} = h(n)`\n    *   The DIT-FFT algorithm provides a formula to compute `Y(k)` from the DFTs of its even and odd parts, `X(k)` and `H(k)`:\n        For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n        `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n        `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)`\n        where `W_8^k = e^{-j2πk/8}` is the twiddle factor.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Twiddle Factors**\n    *   We need `W_8^k` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n    *   `W_8^1 = e^{-jπ/4} = cos(π/4) - j*sin(π/4) = (1/√2) - j(1/√2) = (1-j)/√2`\n    *   `W_8^2 = e^{-jπ/2} = -j`\n    *   `W_8^3 = e^{-j3π/4} = cos(3π/4) - j*sin(3π/4) = (-1/√2) - j(1/√2) = (-1-j)/√2`\n\n4.  **Calculate the first half of Y(k) (k=0, 1, 2, 3)**\n    *   **k=0:** `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n    *   **k=1:** `Y(1) = X(1) + W_8^1 * H(1) = j + [(1-j)/√2] * (1+j) = j + (1 - j^2)/√2 = j + (1+1)/√2 = j + 2/√2 = j + √2`\n    *   **k=2:** `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) * 1 = -1 - j`\n    *   **k=3:** `Y(3) = X(3) + W_8^3 * H(3) = -j + [(-1-j)/√2] * (1-j) = -j + (-1 + j - j + j^2)/√2 = -j + (-1-1)/√2 = -j - 2/√2 = -j - √2`\n\n5.  **Calculate the second half of Y(k) (k=4, 5, 6, 7)**\n    *   **k=4 (using k=0):** `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1`\n    *   **k=5 (using k=1):** `Y(5) = X(1) - W_8^1 * H(1) = j - [(1-j)/√2] * (1+j) = j - (2/√2) = j - √2`\n    *   **k=6 (using k=2):** `Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j) * 1 = -1 + j`\n    *   **k=7 (using k=3):** `Y(7) = X(3) - W_8^3 * H(3) = -j - [(-1-j)/√2] * (1-j) = -j - (-2/√2) = -j + √2`\n\n6.  **Assemble the Final Answer**\n    *   Combining all the calculated values, the 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence is:\n    `Y(k) = [Y(0), Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), Y(4), Y(5), Y(6), Y(7)]`\n    `Y(k) = [1, √2+j, -1-j, -√2-j, 1, -√2+j, -1+j, √2-j]`\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is the 8-point DFT of the sequence `{x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}`.\n\n<<<[1, √2+j, -1-j, -√2-j, 1, -√2+j, -1+j, √2-j]>>>"
