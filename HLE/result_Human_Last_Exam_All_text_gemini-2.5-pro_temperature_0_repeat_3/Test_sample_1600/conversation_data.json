    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(3).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a(n)**\n\nThe problem defines `a(n)` as the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics (QED). Let's break this down:\n*   **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the theory describing how light (photons) and matter (electrons) interact. The fundamental interaction is a vertex where two electron lines meet one photon line.\n*   **Propagators:** These describe the propagation of a particle from one point to another. A Feynman diagram for a propagator, also known as a self-energy diagram, has two external lines of the same type (e.g., two external electron lines for the electron propagator).\n*   **Order 2n:** In QED, the \"order\" of a diagram typically refers to the power of the fine-structure constant, α. Since α is proportional to the square of the electron charge `e`, and each vertex contributes one factor of `e`, a diagram's order in `e` is equal to the number of vertices. An n-th order diagram in α corresponds to a diagram with 2n vertices. Therefore, \"order 2n\" means the diagram has **2n vertices**.\n*   **Non-vanishing:** This means we only count diagrams that give a non-zero contribution. In QED, the standard topologically distinct connected diagrams for propagators are non-vanishing.\n*   **Electron or Photon Propagators:** The number of distinct diagram topologies is the same for both the electron self-energy and the photon self-energy (also called vacuum polarization) at any given order.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the specific question**\n\nWe need to find `a(3)`. According to the definition:\n*   `n = 3`\n*   The number of vertices is `2n = 2 * 3 = 6`.\nSo, the question is asking for the number of distinct, non-vanishing Feynman diagrams with 6 vertices for the electron (or photon) propagator in QED.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the sequence for small values of n**\n\nThis is a well-known counting problem in physics. Let's find the first few terms of the sequence `a(n)` to establish the pattern.\n\n*   **a(0):** This corresponds to `2n = 0` vertices. This is the \"bare\" propagator, represented by a single line. There is only **1** such diagram.\n    *   `a(0) = 1`\n\n*   **a(1):** This corresponds to `2n = 2` vertices. This is the one-loop correction. For both the electron and photon propagators, there is only **1** possible way to connect two vertices to form a self-energy diagram.\n    *   `a(1) = 1`\n\n*   **a(2):** This corresponds to `2n = 4` vertices. These are the two-loop corrections. It is a known result that there are **2** distinct topologies for the 4-vertex self-energy diagram. These are often referred to as the \"nested\" (or \"rainbow\") diagram and the \"overlapping\" (or \"crossed\") diagram.\n    *   `a(2) = 2`\n\n**Step 4: Determine a(3)**\n\nThe sequence of the number of QED propagator diagrams is well-documented in physics literature and mathematical databases like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), where it is listed as sequence A000698.\n\nThe sequence for `a(n)` starts as follows:\n*   `a(0) = 1` (0 vertices)\n*   `a(1) = 1` (2 vertices)\n*   `a(2) = 2` (4 vertices)\n*   `a(3) = 9` (6 vertices)\n*   `a(4) = 74` (8 vertices)\n\nThe value we are looking for is `a(3)`, which corresponds to the number of diagrams with 6 vertices. Based on the established sequence, this number is 9. These 9 diagrams represent all the topologically distinct ways to form a two-point function with 6 vertices in QED.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 6 (2n with n=3) for the electron or photon propagators in QED is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
