    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the binary pattern for Rule 110 after 20 steps.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Cellular Automaton Rule 110\n\nA one-dimensional cellular automaton consists of a line of cells, each with a state (in this case, 0 or 1). The state of each cell in the next generation is determined by a rule based on its current state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors.\n\nThe rule is defined by a number, in this case, 110. To understand the rule, we convert this number to its 8-bit binary representation.\n$110_{10} = 01101110_2$\n\nThis 8-bit string defines the output for the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns. The standard convention lists the neighborhoods in descending order:\n\n| Current Neighborhood (Left, Center, Right) | Binary Value | New State for Center Cell (from 01101110) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `111` | 7 | `0` |\n| `110` | 6 | `1` |\n| `101` | 5 | `1` |\n| `100` | 4 | `0` |\n| `011` | 3 | `1` |\n| `010` | 2 | `1` |\n| `001` | 1 | `1` |\n| `000` | 0 | `0` |\n\n### Step 2: Define the Initial State\n\nThe automaton starts from a \"single cell in state 1\". This is Generation 0. We represent this as a line of cells that are all 0, except for one cell which is 1. For calculation, we assume this pattern is surrounded by an infinite number of zeros.\n\n**Generation 0:** `...0001000...`\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Rule Iteratively for 20 Generations\n\nWe will now calculate the pattern for each generation. We only show the non-zero part of the pattern.\n\n*   **Generation 0:** `1`\n*   **Generation 1:** We look at the neighborhoods in Gen 0.\n    *   `...001...` -> `1`\n    *   `...010...` -> `1`\n    *   Result: `11`\n*   **Generation 2:** We look at the neighborhoods in Gen 1 (`...0110...`).\n    *   `...001...` -> `1`\n    *   `...011...` -> `1`\n    *   `...110...` -> `1`\n    *   Result: `111`\n*   **Generation 3:** From `...01110...`\n    *   `...011...` -> `1`\n    *   `...111...` -> `0`\n    *   `...110...` -> `1`\n    *   Result (with the leading `1` from `001`): `1101`\n*   **Generation 4:** From `...011010...` -> `11111`\n*   **Generation 5:** From `...0111110...` -> `110001`\n*   **Generation 6:** From `...01100010...` -> `1110011`\n*   **Generation 7:** From `...011100110...` -> `11010111`\n*   **Generation 8:** From `...0110101110...` -> `111111101`\n*   **Generation 9:** From `...01111111010...` -> `110000111`\n*   **Generation 10:** From `...01100001110...` -> `111001101`\n*   **Generation 11:** From `...01110011010...` -> `1101011111`\n*   **Generation 12:** From `...011010111110...` -> `11111110001`\n*   **Generation 13:** From `...0111111100010...` -> `11000010011`\n*   **Generation 14:** From `...0110000100110...` -> `11100110111`\n*   **Generation 15:** From `...0111001101110...` -> `110101111101`\n*   **Generation 16:** From `...01101011111010...` -> `111111100111`\n*   **Generation 17:** From `...01111111001110...` -> `110000101101`\n*   **Generation 18:** From `...01100001011010...` -> `111001111111`\n*   **Generation 19:** From `...01110011111110...` -> `110101100001`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final 20th Generation\n\nNow we perform the final step, calculating Generation 20 from Generation 19.\n\n*   **Generation 19 pattern:** `110101100001`\n*   We write it with padding zeros to see the neighborhoods clearly: `...0011010110000100...`\n*   Let's calculate the new bits from left to right:\n    1.  Neighborhood `001` (left of the pattern) -> `1`\n    2.  Neighborhood `011` -> `1`\n    3.  Neighborhood `110` -> `1`\n    4.  Neighborhood `101` -> `1`\n    5.  Neighborhood `010` -> `1`\n    6.  Neighborhood `101` -> `1`\n    7.  Neighborhood `011` -> `1`\n    8.  Neighborhood `100` (from the `100` part of `...1100...`) -> `0`\n    9.  Neighborhood `000` -> `0`\n    10. Neighborhood `000` -> `0`\n    11. Neighborhood `001` -> `1`\n    12. Neighborhood `010` -> `1`\n    13. Neighborhood `100` (right of the pattern) -> `0`\n\n*   Assembling these bits gives the new pattern: `1111111000110`\n*   Finally, we trim any leading or trailing zeros that are part of the infinite background. The trailing `0` is trimmed.\n\n**Final Pattern for Generation 20:** `111111100011`\n\n<<<111111100011>>>"
