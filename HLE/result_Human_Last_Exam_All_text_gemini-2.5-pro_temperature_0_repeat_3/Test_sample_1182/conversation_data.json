    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of double points on the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ above 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the curve and the problem.**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve. The degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is $d=5$. The genus of the curve is $g = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\nWe need to find the number of double points (nodes) on the stable reduction of this curve over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The residue field is $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reduction type using the Newton polygon.**\nThe theory of reduction of hyperelliptic curves, especially in characteristic 2, relates the structure of the stable reduction to the Newton polygon of the defining polynomial $f(x)$.\n\nFirst, we list the coefficients of $f(x)$:\n$a_5 = 8$\n$a_4 = 4$\n$a_3 = 4$\n$a_2 = 1$\n$a_1 = 8$\n$a_0 = 0$\n\nNext, we find the 2-adic valuations of these coefficients:\n$v_2(a_5) = v_2(8) = 3$\n$v_2(a_4) = v_2(4) = 2$\n$v_2(a_3) = v_2(4) = 2$\n$v_2(a_2) = v_2(1) = 0$\n$v_2(a_1) = v_2(8) = 3$\n$v_2(a_0) = v_2(0) = \\infty$\n\nThe Newton polygon $N(f)$ is the lower convex hull of the set of points $(i, v_2(a_i))$ for $i=0, \\dots, 5$. The points to consider are:\n$(5, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 0), (1, 3)$.\n\nLet's plot these points or compute the slopes between them to find the lower boundary.\n- The point with the lowest y-coordinate is $(2, 0)$.\n- Let's check the slopes from $(2,0)$ to the other points $(i, v_2(a_i))$:\n  - Slope to $(1,3)$: $(3-0)/(1-2) = -3$\n  - Slope to $(3,2)$: $(2-0)/(3-2) = 2$\n  - Slope to $(4,2)$: $(2-0)/(4-2) = 1$\n  - Slope to $(5,3)$: $(3-0)/(5-2) = 1$\n\nThe lowest slope from $(2,0)$ to a point to its right is 1. This slope is achieved for points $(4,2)$ and $(5,3)$.\nThe line passing through $(2,0)$ with slope 1 is given by the equation $y - 0 = 1(x - 2)$, which is $y = x - 2$.\n- Let's check which points lie on or above this line:\n  - For $(3,2)$: The line gives $y=3-2=1$. Since $2 > 1$, the point $(3,2)$ is above the line.\n  - For $(4,2)$: The line gives $y=4-2=2$. The point $(4,2)$ is on the line.\n  - For $(5,3)$: The line gives $y=5-2=3$. The point $(5,3)$ is on the line.\n- Let's check the point to the left of $(2,0)$:\n  - For $(1,3)$: The line gives $y=1-2=-1$. Since $3 > -1$, the point $(1,3)$ is above the line.\n\nThe lower convex hull consists of a single segment connecting the point $(2,0)$ to $(5,3)$. All other points lie on or above this segment.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the theorem on stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves.**\nA theorem by M. Kudo (2018) concerning the stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves over 2-adic fields states that if the Newton polygon $N(f)$ has a single slope $\\lambda=1$, then the stable reduction of the curve $C$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ is a hyperelliptic curve whose genus $g_s$ is equal to $I$, the number of integer points on the Newton polygon segment, strictly between its endpoints.\n\nOur Newton polygon has a single segment from $(2,0)$ to $(5,3)$, and its slope is indeed 1. So the theorem applies.\nWe need to find the number of integer points on the line segment $y=x-2$ for $x \\in (2, 5)$.\nThe possible integer values for $x$ are 3 and 4.\n- If $x=3$, $y=3-2=1$. The point is $(3,1)$.\n- If $x=4$, $y=4-2=2$. The point is $(4,2)$.\nThere are two such integer points. So, $I=2$.\n\nAccording to the theorem, the stable reduction is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g_s = I = 2$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of double points.**\nThe number of double points, $\\delta$, on a stable curve is related to the genus of the generic fiber, $g$, and the arithmetic genus of the stable reduction, $g_a$. For an irreducible stable reduction, the arithmetic genus $g_a$ is the geometric genus $g_s$ of the curve plus the number of double points $\\delta$.\n$g_a = g_s + \\delta$.\n\nIn the case of potentially good reduction (which this is, as the stable reduction is a smooth curve of the same genus), the arithmetic genus of the stable reduction is equal to the genus of the original curve.\n$g_a = g$.\nSo, we have $g = g_s + \\delta$.\nWe know $g=2$ and we found $g_s=2$.\n$2 = 2 + \\delta$\nThis implies $\\delta = 0$.\n\nA stable curve of genus 2 is a smooth curve. A smooth curve has no singular points, and therefore no double points.\n\nFinal conclusion: The stable reduction of the given curve is a smooth hyperelliptic curve of genus 2, which has 0 double points."
