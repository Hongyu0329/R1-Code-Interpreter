    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the unique $\\tau$-tilting module that is not a slice module for the path algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Modules**\n\nThe algebra $A$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} 2 \\xrightarrow{\\beta} 3$. This is a hereditary algebra of type $A_3$. The category of finite-dimensional $A$-modules, $\\text{mod-}A$, is of finite representation type.\n\nThe indecomposable $A$-modules can be represented as $M_{ij}$ for $1 \\le i \\le j \\le 3$, where $M_{ij}$ is the module with support on vertices $\\{i, i+1, \\dots, j\\}$ and identity maps between them. There are $\\frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6$ such modules:\n*   $M_{11} = S_1$ (simple module at vertex 1), dimension vector $(1,0,0)$. This is also the injective module $I_1$.\n*   $M_{22} = S_2$ (simple module at vertex 2), dimension vector $(0,1,0)$.\n*   $M_{33} = S_3$ (simple module at vertex 3), dimension vector $(0,0,1)$. This is also the projective module $P_3$.\n*   $M_{12}$ (dimension vector $(1,1,0)$). This is the injective module $I_2$.\n*   $M_{23}$ (dimension vector $(0,1,1)$). This is the projective module $P_2$.\n*   $M_{13}$ (dimension vector $(1,1,1)$). This is the projective module $P_1$ and the injective module $I_3$.\n\nThe Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver for $A$ is:\n```\n   M_11 (I_1)\n  /\nM_12 (I_2)\n /  \\\nM_13 (P_1,I_3)  M_22 (S_2)\n \\  /\n  M_23 (P_2)\n    \\\n     M_33 (P_3)\n```\nThe Auslander-Reiten translation $\\tau$ acts on non-injective modules and is given by $\\tau M_{ij} = M_{i-1, j-1}$ for $i>1$.\n*   $\\tau M_{22} = M_{11}$\n*   $\\tau M_{23} = M_{12}$\n*   $\\tau M_{33} = M_{22}$\n$\\tau$ is not defined on injective modules ($M_{11}, M_{12}, M_{13}$).\n\n**Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting Modules**\n\nIn modern terminology (following Adachi, Iyama, Reiten), a module $M$ is a **$\\tau$-tilting module** if it is $\\tau$-rigid and has $n$ non-isomorphic indecomposable summands, where $n$ is the number of simple modules (here $n=3$).\n*   A module $M$ is **$\\tau$-rigid** if $\\text{Hom}_A(M, \\tau M) = 0$.\n*   Crucially, if $M$ has a projective summand $P$, then $\\tau P$ is considered to be $0$. So $\\text{Hom}(X, \\tau P)=0$ for any $X$.\n*   However, the standard definition of a $\\tau$-tilting module requires it to be projective-free. A module $M$ is $\\tau$-tilting if the pair $(M, 0)$ is a support $\\tau$-tilting pair. This implies $M$ has no projective summands.\n*   A module $T$ is a classical **tilting module** if (1) $\\text{pdim}(T) \\le 1$, (2) $\\text{Ext}^1_A(T,T)=0$, and (3) $T$ has $n$ non-isomorphic indecomposable summands. For a hereditary algebra like $A$, condition (1) is always satisfied.\n*   A $\\tau$-tilting module is a tilting module with no projective summands.\n\nSo, we are looking for a tilting module $T = T_1 \\oplus T_2 \\oplus T_3$ such that none of its summands $T_i$ are projective.\nThe projective modules are $P_1=M_{13}, P_2=M_{23}, P_3=M_{33}$.\nThe non-projective indecomposable modules are $M_{11}, M_{12}, M_{22}$.\nThere is only one way to choose 3 non-projective indecomposable modules, which is the set $\\{M_{11}, M_{12}, M_{22}\\}$.\n\nLet's check if $T = M_{11} \\oplus M_{12} \\oplus M_{22}$ is a tilting module. For a path algebra of type $A_n$, a module $T = \\bigoplus_{k=1}^n M_{i_k, j_k}$ is tilting if and only if the corresponding set of intervals $\\{[i_k, j_k]\\}$ is non-crossing, i.e., for any two intervals $[i,j]$ and $[k,l]$ in the set, we do not have $k < i \\le l < j$.\n*   The intervals for $T$ are $[1,1], [1,2], [2,2]$.\n*   Comparing $[1,1]$ and $[1,2]$: $i=1, j=1, k=1, l=2$. The condition $k<i$ is not met. OK.\n*   Comparing $[1,1]$ and $[2,2]$: $i=1, j=1, k=2, l=2$. The condition $k<i$ is not met. OK.\n*   Comparing $[1,2]$ and $[2,2]$: $i=1, j=2, k=2, l=2$. The condition $k<i$ is not met. OK.\nThe non-crossing condition holds, so $T = M_{11} \\oplus M_{12} \\oplus M_{22}$ is a tilting module. Since it has no projective summands, it is the unique $\\tau$-tilting module for $A$.\n\n**Step 3: Understand Slice Modules**\n\nA **slice module** is a tilting module $T$ whose endomorphism algebra, $\\text{End}_A(T)$, is a **tilted algebra of slice type**. For an algebra of type $A_n$, this means the quiver of $\\text{End}_A(T)$ is a tree. A module is not a slice module if the quiver of its endomorphism algebra contains a cycle.\n\nLet's determine the quiver of $B = \\text{End}_A(T)$ for $T = M_{11} \\oplus M_{12} \\oplus M_{22}$. The vertices of the quiver correspond to the summands $T_1=M_{11}, T_2=M_{12}, T_3=M_{22}$. An arrow exists from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ if there is an irreducible map in $\\text{add}(T)$ from $T_i$ to $T_j$, which simplifies to checking if $\\text{Hom}_A(T_i, T_j) \\ne 0$ (and considering the radical quotient).\n\n*   $\\text{Hom}_A(T_1, T_2) = \\text{Hom}_A(M_{11}, M_{12})$: This is non-zero, as $M_{11}=S_1$ is the socle of $M_{12}$. This gives an arrow $1 \\to 2$.\n*   $\\text{Hom}_A(T_2, T_1) = \\text{Hom}_A(M_{12}, M_{11})$: This is non-zero, as $M_{11}=S_1$ is the top of $M_{12}$. This gives an arrow $2 \\to 1$.\n*   $\\text{Hom}_A(T_3, T_2) = \\text{Hom}_A(M_{22}, M_{12})$: This is non-zero, as $M_{22}=S_2$ is a composition factor of $M_{12}$ ($M_{12}/S_1 \\cong S_2$). There is an injection $S_2 \\to M_{12}$. This gives an arrow $3 \\to 2$.\n*   Other $\\text{Hom}$ spaces between distinct summands are zero. For example, $\\text{Hom}_A(M_{11}, M_{22})=0$.\n\nThe quiver of $\\text{End}_A(T)$ has arrows $1 \\to 2$, $2 \\to 1$, and $3 \\to 2$. This quiver contains a cycle ($1 \\leftrightarrow 2$). Therefore, $T$ is not a slice module.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nWe have found that there is only one module that can be a $\\tau$-tilting module, namely $T = M_{11} \\oplus M_{12} \\oplus M_{22}$. We have verified that it is indeed a tilting module (and thus a $\\tau$-tilting module). We have also shown that its endomorphism algebra has a cycle in its quiver, which means it is not a slice module. Since it is the only $\\tau$-tilting module, it is the unique one that is not a slice.\n\nThe module is $M_{11} \\oplus M_{12} \\oplus M_{22}$, which can also be written as $S_1 \\oplus I_2 \\oplus S_2$.\n\n<<<M_{11} \\oplus M_{12} \\oplus M_{22}>>>"
