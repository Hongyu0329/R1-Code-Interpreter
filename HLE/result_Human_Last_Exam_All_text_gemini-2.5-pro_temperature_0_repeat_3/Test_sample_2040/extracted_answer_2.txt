No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The stable polymorphs of borophene possess a center of inversion symmetry, which makes their second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$) equal to zero. Since SPDC is a second-order nonlinear process that requires a non-zero $\chi^{(2)}$, it is forbidden by symmetry in these materials.
