    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)**\n\n*   **Definition:** SPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In this process, a single photon of higher energy (called the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear optical material and spontaneously splits into two photons of lower energy (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons).\n*   **Governing Physics:** This process is governed by the conservation of energy and momentum.\n    *   Energy conservation: $\\omega_{pump} = \\omega_{signal} + \\omega_{idler}$ (where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency).\n    *   Momentum conservation (phase-matching): $\\vec{k}_{pump} = \\vec{k}_{signal} + \\vec{k}_{idler}$ (where $\\vec{k}$ is the wavevector).\n*   **Material Requirement:** The most critical requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC is that it must possess a significant **second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility**, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$ (chi-two). SPDC is a second-order nonlinear process, meaning the induced polarization in the material depends quadratically on the strength of the incident electric field.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key property that determines if $\\chi^{(2)}$ is non-zero**\n\n*   **Inversion Symmetry:** The value of $\\chi^{(2)}$ is directly linked to the crystal symmetry of the material. A fundamental rule in nonlinear optics states that for a material to have a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ in the electric dipole approximation, it **must lack a center of inversion symmetry**.\n*   **Centrosymmetric Materials:** Materials that possess a center of inversion are called centrosymmetric. In such materials, for every atom at a position $(x, y, z)$ relative to the center, there is an identical atom at $(-x, -y, -z)$. Applying an electric field $\\vec{E}$ and its inverse $-\\vec{E}$ must produce opposite polarizations, $\\vec{P}$ and $-\\vec{P}$. However, a second-order effect depends on $\\vec{E}^2$, which is the same for both $\\vec{E}$ and $-\\vec{E}$. This contradiction forces all components of the $\\chi^{(2)}$ tensor to be zero for centrosymmetric materials.\n*   **The Central Question:** Therefore, the question \"Would free-standing boron nanosheets exhibit SPDC?\" boils down to \"Do free-standing boron nanosheets have a crystal structure that lacks inversion symmetry?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure and symmetry of free-standing boron nanosheets (Borophene)**\n\n*   **Polymorphism:** Unlike graphene, which has a single stable honeycomb structure, 2D boron is polymorphic. This means it can exist in many different stable or metastable atomic arrangements (polymorphs).\n*   **Common Structures:** Theoretical calculations and experimental synthesis (typically on substrates like silver) have identified several common borophene structures. The most widely studied free-standing structures include:\n    *   **$\\alpha$-sheet:** A planar triangular lattice with a specific pattern of hexagonal vacancies. Its space group is Pmmm.\n    *   **$\\beta_{12}$-sheet:** A buckled structure with a rectangular unit cell. Its space group is Pmmn.\n    *   **$\\chi_3$-sheet:** Another buckled structure. Its space group is Cmmm.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:** We need to check if these space groups correspond to centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric crystal structures.\n    *   Pmmm (No. 47), Pmmn (No. 59), and Cmmm (No. 65) are all **centrosymmetric** space groups.\n*   **Conclusion on Borophene Symmetry:** The most stable and commonly considered polymorphs of free-standing borophene are all centrosymmetric.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the findings to answer the question**\n\n1.  SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires a material with a non-zero second-order susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  A non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is only possible in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  The stable, low-energy structures of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) are predicted and observed to be centrosymmetric.\n4.  Because of this inversion symmetry, the bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ of an ideal, free-standing boron nanosheet is zero.\n5.  Therefore, SPDC is forbidden by symmetry in the bulk of the material.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Edges and Defects:** While the bulk of the nanosheet is centrosymmetric, the inversion symmetry is broken at the edges of the sheet or at defect sites. These regions could theoretically support SPDC, but their contribution would be extremely small compared to the overall area of the sheet and thus the overall optical response would be negligible. The question asks about the nanosheet as a whole, where the bulk properties dominate.\n*   **Higher-Order Effects:** SPDC can also be mediated by higher-order multipole interactions (like electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole effects), which are not forbidden in centrosymmetric materials. However, these effects are typically many orders of magnitude weaker than the electric dipole ($\\chi^{(2)}$) process. So, while a vanishingly small signal might be technically possible, the phenomenon would not be \"expected\" in any significant or useful way.\n*   **Strain:** Applying significant non-uniform strain could potentially break the inversion symmetry and induce a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$. However, the question refers to a standard \"free-standing\" sheet, which implies an unstrained, ideal structure.\n*   **Comparison:** It is useful to compare this to other 2D materials. Graphene is also centrosymmetric and does not exhibit SPDC. In contrast, monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (like MoS₂, WSe₂, etc.) are non-centrosymmetric and are known to have a strong $\\chi^{(2)}$ response, making them excellent candidates for SPDC. This highlights that the property is material-specific and depends entirely on crystal symmetry.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the centrosymmetric nature of the stable crystal structures of free-standing boron nanosheets, the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero. Consequently, spontaneous parametric down-conversion, a $\\chi^{(2)}$ process, is forbidden by symmetry and would not be expected to occur.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The stable polymorphs of borophene possess a center of inversion symmetry, which makes their second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$) equal to zero. Since SPDC is a second-order nonlinear process that requires a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$, it is forbidden by symmetry in these materials.>>>"
