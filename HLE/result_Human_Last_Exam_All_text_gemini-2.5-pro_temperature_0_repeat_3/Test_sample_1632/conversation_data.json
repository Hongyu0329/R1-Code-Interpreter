    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice (a 2D square grid). Let's denote this number by a(n) for an n-step walk.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the terms:**\n    *   **Manhattan lattice:** A 2D grid where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical steps to adjacent points. From a point (x, y), one can move to (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), or (x, y-1).\n    *   **n-step walk:** A sequence of n moves (edges) starting from an origin point. The walk consists of n+1 points (vertices).\n    *   **Self-avoiding walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same point (vertex) more than once.\n    *   **a(n):** The total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks starting from a fixed origin.\n\n2.  **Careful Points & Initial Calculations:**\n    *   The starting point is fixed, usually at (0,0). The total number of walks is independent of which point is chosen as the origin.\n    *   The number of available moves at any step depends on the entire path taken so far, not just the previous step. This makes direct calculation complex.\n    *   There is no known simple closed-form formula for a(n). The values for small `n` are typically found through exhaustive enumeration, often with a computer program using a backtracking algorithm.\n\n3.  **Calculating the first few terms (a(1) to a(4)):**\n    *   **a(1):** From the origin, there are 4 possible moves (right, left, up, down). All are 1-step SAWs.\n        *   a(1) = 4.\n    *   **a(2):** For each of the 4 initial steps, the walk cannot immediately reverse direction. This leaves 3 possible moves for the second step. All of these result in a valid 2-step SAW.\n        *   a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12.\n    *   **a(3):** For any 2-step SAW, the endpoint is not adjacent to the origin. Therefore, the only restriction on the third step is not to reverse the second step. There are 3 available moves for each of the 12 2-step walks.\n        *   a(3) = 12 * 3 = 36.\n    *   **a(4):** This is where it becomes more complex. A 3-step walk can end at a point adjacent to the origin. For example, the path (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (0,1).\n        *   From the endpoint (0,1), a move to (0,0) is forbidden because the origin has already been visited.\n        *   We must count how many 3-step paths have this \"trapping\" feature.\n            *   Paths that end adjacent to the origin: The first step has 4 choices (e.g., to (1,0)). The second step must be a turn (2 choices, e.g., to (1,1)). The third step must be another turn \"inward\" (1 choice, to (0,1)). This gives 4 * 2 * 1 = 8 such paths.\n            *   For these 8 paths, there are only 2 valid moves for the 4th step (the move back to the previous point and the move to the origin are forbidden). This contributes 8 * 2 = 16 walks.\n            *   The remaining 36 - 8 = 28 paths do not end adjacent to the origin. For these, there are 3 valid moves. This contributes 28 * 3 = 84 walks.\n        *   Total for a(4) = 16 + 84 = 100.\n\n4.  **Finding a(10):**\n    *   Continuing this manual calculation is extremely tedious and prone to error as the number of path configurations and potential traps grows rapidly.\n    *   This is a well-known problem in combinatorics, and the sequence a(n) is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001411.\n    *   The most reliable method to find a(10) without writing a program is to refer to the known, computed values for this sequence.\n\n5.  **The Known Sequence Values:**\n    *   a(1) = 4\n    *   a(2) = 12\n    *   a(3) = 36\n    *   a(4) = 100\n    *   a(5) = 284\n    *   a(6) = 780\n    *   a(7) = 2,172\n    *   a(8) = 5,916\n    *   a(9) = 16,268\n    *   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\nBased on the established results for this classic mathematical problem, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
