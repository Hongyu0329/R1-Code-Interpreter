    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the most suitable synthesis technique.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule\n\n*   **Type of Molecule:** A peptide.\n*   **Size:** 100 amino acids (aa). This is a relatively large peptide, often considered a small protein.\n*   **Composition:** It contains standard amino acids (M, K, A, V, C, L, I, G, T, R) and one **unnatural amino acid (UAA)**, denoted as 'X'.\n*   **Identity of UAA:** 'X' is specified as azido phenylalanine. This is a non-proteinogenic amino acid, meaning it is not one of the 20 standard amino acids encoded by the universal genetic code.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques\n\nWe need to find a technique that can efficiently produce a 100-residue chain while also allowing for the site-specific incorporation of an unnatural amino acid. Let's consider the main options.\n\n**A) Standard Recombinant Protein Expression**\n*   **Principle:** Uses the natural protein synthesis machinery of a host organism (like *E. coli*) to translate an mRNA sequence into a protein.\n*   **Pros:** Excellent for producing large quantities of proteins composed of the 20 standard amino acids. 100 aa is an easy size for this method.\n*   **Cons:** The standard cellular machinery has no mechanism to incorporate azido phenylalanine. The genetic code does not have a codon for it, and there is no corresponding tRNA or aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) to add it to the growing chain.\n*   **Conclusion:** Unsuitable on its own because it cannot incorporate the UAA.\n\n**B) Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n*   **Principle:** A purely chemical method where amino acids are sequentially coupled to a growing chain that is anchored to a solid resin support.\n*   **Pros:** It offers complete control over the sequence. Unnatural amino acids, like a protected form of azido phenylalanine, can be easily incorporated by simply adding them as one of the building blocks in the appropriate synthesis cycle.\n*   **Cons:** The efficiency of each coupling step is not 100%. For a 100 aa peptide, there are 99 coupling reactions. Even with a very high efficiency of 99% per step, the overall theoretical yield would be (0.99)^99 â‰ˆ 37%. In practice, efficiencies are lower, leading to extremely low yields of the full-length product and a complex mixture of truncated side products that are very difficult to purify. SPPS is generally considered impractical for peptides longer than ~50 aa.\n*   **Conclusion:** Unsuitable due to the 100 aa length, which would result in prohibitively low yield and purity issues.\n\n**C) Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n*   **Principle:** A chemical method to ligate (join) two smaller, unprotected peptide fragments. One fragment must have an N-terminal cysteine, and the other must have a C-terminal thioester.\n*   **Pros:** Allows for the synthesis of very large proteins by combining smaller, more manageable fragments. These fragments can be made using either SPPS or recombinant expression.\n*   **How it would work:** One could synthesize a smaller peptide fragment containing the azido phenylalanine 'X' using SPPS (e.g., a 20-30 aa fragment, which is feasible). The remaining ~70-80 aa fragment could be produced using recombinant expression (if it has a C-terminal thioester) or also by SPPS (less ideal). The two fragments would then be ligated.\n*   **Cons:** This is a multi-step, complex process requiring the separate synthesis and purification of multiple fragments, followed by a ligation reaction and another final purification. While powerful, it is more laborious than a single-pot method if one is available.\n*   **Conclusion:** A possible but complex and indirect solution.\n\n**D) Genetic Code Expansion (via Amber Suppression)**\n*   **Principle:** A semi-synthetic *in vivo* technique that \"expands\" the genetic code to include a UAA. It works by repurposing a stop codon (typically the UAG \"amber\" codon) to encode the UAA.\n*   **How it works:**\n    1.  The gene for the 100 aa peptide is designed with a UAG codon at the position for 'X'.\n    2.  The host cell (*E. coli*) is engineered to contain two new components: an **orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)** and its cognate **orthogonal tRNA**. \"Orthogonal\" means this pair works with the UAA but does not interact with any of the cell's natural amino acids or tRNAs.\n    3.  The engineered cell is grown in a medium supplemented with the UAA (azido phenylalanine).\n    4.  The orthogonal aaRS charges the orthogonal tRNA with azido phenylalanine. When the ribosome encounters the UAG codon in the mRNA, this charged tRNA recognizes it and incorporates azido phenylalanine into the growing 100 aa peptide chain.\n*   **Pros:** It combines the high efficiency of ribosomal synthesis for producing long chains (100 aa is easy) with the site-specific incorporation of a UAA. It is a highly specific and relatively straightforward *in vivo* method.\n*   **Conclusion:** This technique is perfectly suited for the problem. It efficiently handles both the size of the peptide and the specific incorporation of the unnatural amino acid.\n\n### Final Comparison and Decision\n\n*   **Standard Recombinant Expression:** Fails due to the UAA.\n*   **SPPS:** Fails due to the 100 aa length.\n*   **NCL:** Possible, but overly complex compared to other options.\n*   **Genetic Code Expansion:** Directly and efficiently solves both challenges (size and UAA incorporation) in a single biological process.\n\nTherefore, Genetic Code Expansion is the most helpful and appropriate technique.\n\n<<<Genetic Code Expansion>>>"
