    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂gieti`.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-`. This root carries the core meaning related to 'tracking, seeking out, perceiving'. The `h₂` is a laryngeal consonant, which typically has an \"a-coloring\" effect on adjacent vowels.\n*   **Suffix:** `*-ie-`. This is a common present tense suffix.\n*   **Ending:** `*-ti`. This is the standard third-person singular present active indicative ending.\n*   **Meaning:** '(s)he is giving a sign' or '(s)he is tracking/perceiving'. The cognates provided (Hittite `sākizzi`, Latin `sāgīre`) confirm this root and its general meaning.\n\n### **Step 2: Derivation into Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\nTo get from PIE to Proto-Germanic, we must apply several key sound laws. We will use the infinitive form `*seh₂g-ie-nom` as our base, which is more standard for tracing developments. This becomes PGmc `*-janą`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Grimm's Law.** This law describes a systematic shift in stop consonants.\n    *   The PIE voiced velar stop `*g` becomes the PGmc voiceless velar stop `*k`.\n    *   So, `*seh₂g-` becomes `*seh₂k-`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Laryngeal Vocalization.** Laryngeals were lost in Proto-Germanic, but they first affected the quality and length of adjacent vowels.\n    *   The sequence `*eh₂` (e-grade vowel + a-coloring laryngeal) becomes a long back vowel in Proto-Germanic, `*ō`.\n    *   So, `*seh₂k-` becomes `*sōk-`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Suffix and Ending.**\n    *   The PIE present suffix `*-ie-` becomes `*-ja-` in this class of verbs (Class 1 weak verbs) in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   The PIE infinitive ending `*-nom` becomes PGmc `*-aną`.\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:** Combining these changes, the PIE infinitive `*seh₂g-ie-nom` gives us the Proto-Germanic infinitive **`*sōkjaną`**. The meaning has shifted slightly to 'to seek, to look for'.\n\n### **Step 3: Derivation into Old Norse (ON)**\n\nOld Norse is a North Germanic language. We start from the PGmc form `*sōkjaną`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: I-Umlaut (I-Mutation).** The high front vowel/semivowel `*i` or `*j` in the following syllable causes a fronting of the root vowel.\n    *   The back vowel `*ō` is fronted to `œ̄` (a long, front, rounded vowel) by the `*j` in `*-janą`.\n    *   So, `*sōk-` becomes `sœk-`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Loss of Medial Consonants and Endings.**\n    *   The `*j` that caused the umlaut is retained in Old Norse after a velar consonant (`k`, `g`).\n    *   The infinitive ending `*-aną` is reduced to `-a`.\n\n*   **Old Norse Result:** The PGmc `*sōkjaną` becomes Old Norse **`sœkja`**.\n\n### **Step 4: Derivation into Old English (OE)**\n\nOld English is a West Germanic language. We again start from PGmc `*sōkjaną`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: I-Umlaut.** As in Old Norse, the `*j` causes umlaut.\n    *   In Old English, the PGmc `*ō` is fronted to `ē`.\n    *   So, `*sōk-` becomes `sēc-`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Palatalization.** In Old English, velar consonants (`*k`, `*g`) were palatalized (became affricates) when they came before a front vowel or the semivowel `*j`.\n    *   The PGmc `*k` becomes the palatal affricate `ċ` (pronounced /tʃ/, as in \"church\").\n    *   So, `sēc-` becomes `sēċ-`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Loss of Medial Consonants and Endings.**\n    *   The `*j` that caused the umlaut and palatalization is lost.\n    *   The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an`.\n\n*   **Old English Result:** The PGmc `*sōkjaną` becomes Old English **`sēcan`** (often spelled `sēċan` in modern grammars to indicate the palatalization).\n\n### **Step 5: Derivation into Old High German (OHG)**\n\nOld High German is another West Germanic language, distinguished by the High German Consonant Shift. We start from PGmc `*sōkjaną`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: High German Consonant Shift.** This law affects voiceless stops.\n    *   After a vowel, PGmc `*k` shifts to the voiceless fricative `hh` (pronounced /x/, like the \"ch\" in Scottish \"loch\").\n    *   So, `*sōkjaną` becomes `*sōhhan`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Vowel Changes.**\n    *   PGmc `*ō` generally becomes the diphthong `uo` in Old High German.\n    *   So, `*sōhhan` becomes `suohhan`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: I-Umlaut.** The `*j` in the original suffix (which is now lost, but its effect remains) also causes umlaut in Old High German.\n    *   The diphthong `uo` is fronted to `üe`.\n    *   So, `suohhan` becomes `süehhen`. However, in many Old High German texts, the umlaut is not consistently written, so the form **`suohhen`** is the most commonly cited dictionary form, representing both the umlauted and non-umlauted pronunciations.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Endings.**\n    *   The infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-an`.\n\n*   **Old High German Result:** The PGmc `*sōkjaną` becomes Old High German **`suohhen`**.\n\n### **Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkjaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœkja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkjaną; Old Norse: sœkja; Old English: sēcan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
