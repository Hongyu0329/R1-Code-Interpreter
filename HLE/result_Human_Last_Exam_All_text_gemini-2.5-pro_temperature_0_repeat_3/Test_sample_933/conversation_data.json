    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) to determine the coldest temperature for efficient production.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction**\nThe synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) involves the direct reaction between Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine (F2) gas. The balanced chemical equation is:\nXe(g) + 2F2(g) → XeF4(s)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Conditions for Synthesis**\nThis reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat. However, like many chemical reactions, it has a significant activation energy. This means that energy must be supplied to initiate the reaction and make it proceed at a practical rate.\n\n*   **Activation Energy:** The primary energy barrier is breaking the strong covalent bond in the fluorine molecule (F-F). Heat is the most common way to provide this activation energy.\n*   **Reactant Ratio:** The ratio of reactants is crucial for determining the product.\n    *   To produce XeF2, an excess of Xenon is used.\n    *   To produce XeF4, a molar ratio of Xe:F2 of approximately 1:5 is typically used. The excess fluorine helps to drive the reaction towards the formation of the tetrafluoride and prevents the formation of XeF2.\n    *   To produce XeF6, a much larger excess of fluorine (e.g., 1:20) and higher temperatures/pressures are needed.\n*   **Temperature and Pressure:** These are the key variables that control the reaction rate and the product formed. The reaction is typically carried out in a sealed vessel made of a material resistant to fluorine, such as nickel or Monel, under several atmospheres of pressure.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Effect of Temperature on Efficiency**\nThe term \"efficiently\" implies a good yield of the desired product (XeF4) in a reasonable amount of time, with minimal formation of byproducts (like XeF2 or XeF6).\n\n*   **Low Temperatures (e.g., below 200 °C):** At temperatures significantly below the optimal range, the kinetic energy of the molecules is too low to overcome the activation energy. The reaction rate would be extremely slow, making the process impractical and not \"efficient\".\n*   **High Temperatures (e.g., 600 °C):** At very high temperatures, and especially with excess fluorine, the reaction is driven further to form Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6). Therefore, a temperature of 600 °C would not be efficient for producing XeF4.\n*   **Optimal Temperature:** There is an optimal temperature that provides enough energy to overcome the activation barrier for a good reaction rate, but is not so high that it favors the formation of XeF6.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Coldest Efficient Temperature from Known Methods**\nBased on established chemical literature and standard laboratory procedures:\n\n*   The synthesis of XeF4 is most commonly and efficiently carried out by heating a 1:5 mixture of xenon and fluorine in a sealed nickel container at **400 °C** and about 6 atmospheres of pressure for several hours.\n*   This temperature (400 °C) is the widely accepted standard for producing XeF4 in high yield. While some reaction might occur at slightly lower temperatures, the rate would drop off significantly, reducing efficiency. Therefore, 400 °C is considered the standard and lowest practical temperature for an *efficient* synthesis via this common method.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the Given Answer Choices**\n*   A. 600 C: Too high, favors XeF6.\n*   B. 400 C: This is the standard, well-documented temperature for efficient XeF4 synthesis.\n*   C. 200 C: Too low for an efficient reaction rate.\n*   D. 78 C: Too low.\n*   E. 0 C: Too low.\n*   F. -78 C: Far too low for this thermal reaction.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe coldest temperature among the choices at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently using the standard method of direct combination is 400 °C.\n\n<<<B>>>"
