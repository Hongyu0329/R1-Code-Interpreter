    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the sum of symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Identify the Diagrams\n\nWe are considering a scalar field theory with a $\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$ interaction term. We need to find the vacuum bubble diagrams at the second order in the coupling constant $\\lambda$, which means the diagrams will have two vertices. A vacuum bubble diagram has no external lines, meaning all field lines (propagators) are internal. We are interested in the *connected* diagrams, as these are the ones that contribute to the vacuum energy density in the linked-cluster theorem.\n\nWith two 4-point vertices (V1 and V2), we have a total of $2 \\times 4 = 8$ \"legs\" that must be connected to each other by propagators. Each propagator connects two legs, so we will have $8/2 = 4$ propagators in total.\n\nLet's enumerate the topologically distinct ways to connect these 8 legs to form a single connected diagram:\n\n1.  **The \"Figure-8\" Diagram:** In this configuration, some propagators connect a vertex to itself (forming loops), and others connect the two different vertices.\n    *   Two legs of V1 connect to each other, forming a loop.\n    *   Two legs of V2 connect to each other, forming a loop.\n    *   The remaining two legs of V1 connect to the remaining two legs of V2, requiring two propagators.\n    *   This diagram consists of one loop on each vertex, with the vertices joined by two propagators.\n\n2.  **The \"Sunset\" Diagram:** In this configuration, all propagators connect one vertex to the other.\n    *   All four legs of V1 are connected to the four legs of V2.\n    *   This requires four propagators, all running between V1 and V2.\n\nThese are the only two connected vacuum bubble diagrams at order $\\lambda^2$ in $\\phi^4$ theory. A third possibility, a disconnected diagram consisting of two separate one-loop bubbles, is typically excluded when calculating the vacuum energy correction, so we will focus on these two connected diagrams.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Symmetry Factor for the Figure-8 Diagram\n\nThe symmetry factor, $S$, of a Feynman diagram is the number of distinct permutations of its vertices and internal lines that leave the diagram topologically unchanged.\n\nFor the Figure-8 diagram, we can identify the following symmetries:\n\n*   **Permutation of vertices:** The two vertices are structurally identical. Each has one loop and is connected to the other vertex by two lines. Swapping the two vertices leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of **2**.\n*   **Permutation of lines:**\n    *   The two propagators connecting vertex V1 and vertex V2 are indistinguishable. They can be swapped. This gives a factor of **2**.\n    *   A propagator that forms a loop (connecting a vertex to itself) has a symmetry corresponding to \"flipping\" it, i.e., swapping the two legs at the vertex that it connects. Since there is one loop on V1 and one loop on V2, we get a symmetry for each.\n        *   Flipping the loop on V1: Factor of **2**.\n        *   Flipping the loop on V2: Factor of **2**.\n\nMultiplying these factors together gives the total symmetry factor for the Figure-8 diagram:\n$S_{\\text{figure-8}} = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Symmetry Factor for the Sunset Diagram\n\nNow we analyze the symmetries of the Sunset diagram.\n\n*   **Permutation of vertices:** The two vertices are identical; each is connected to the other by four lines. Swapping the two vertices leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of **2**.\n*   **Permutation of lines:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are indistinguishable. They can be permuted in any way among themselves. The number of permutations of 4 items is $4!$. This gives a factor of **$4! = 24$**.\n\nMultiplying these factors gives the total symmetry factor for the Sunset diagram:\n$S_{\\text{sunset}} = 2 \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n### Step 4: Sum the Symmetry Factors\n\nThe question asks for the sum of the symmetry factors for each of these diagrams.\n\nSum = $S_{\\text{figure-8}} + S_{\\text{sunset}}$\nSum = $16 + 48$\nSum = $64$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the sum of the calculated symmetry factors.\n\n*   Symmetry factor for the Figure-8 diagram: 16\n*   Symmetry factor for the Sunset diagram: 48\n*   Total sum: $16 + 48 = 64$\n\n<<<64>>>"
