    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Sentence:** The sentence provided is \"Fat people eat accumulates.\"\n2.  **Identify the Target Word:** The question asks for the part of speech of the first word in the sentence. The first word is \"Fat\".\n3.  **Analyze the Word's Function in the Sentence:**\n    *   The word \"Fat\" is placed directly before the word \"people\".\n    *   \"People\" is a noun (referring to human beings).\n    *   Words that describe or modify nouns are called adjectives. In this case, \"Fat\" is describing the \"people\". It answers the question, \"What kind of people?\".\n    *   The phrase \"Fat people\" acts as the subject of the sentence (even though the rest of the sentence is grammatically incorrect).\n\n4.  **Consider Other Parts of Speech (and eliminate them):**\n    *   **Verb:** \"Fat\" is not an action word in this context. The verbs in the sentence are \"eat\" and \"accumulates\".\n    *   **Noun:** While \"fat\" can be a noun (e.g., \"Lard is a type of fat.\"), in this sentence, it is not functioning as a noun itself but as a descriptor for the noun \"people\".\n    *   **Adverb:** An adverb modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. \"Fat\" is not modifying the verb \"eat\" or any other word in that way. It is modifying the noun \"people\".\n    *   **Conjunction:** A conjunction connects words, phrases, or clauses (e.g., and, but, or). \"Fat\" is not serving this function.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on its position and function of modifying the noun \"people\", the word \"Fat\" is an adjective.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is grammatically incorrect. It seems to have two verbs (\"eat\" and \"accumulates\") for a single subject.\n*   Despite the grammatical errors in the overall sentence, the relationship between the first two words, \"Fat\" and \"people\", is clear. \"Fat\" is used to describe \"people\".\n*   The part of speech of a word depends on its function within a specific sentence. Here, its function is adjectival.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nThe word \"Fat\" describes the noun \"people\". Therefore, its part of speech is an adjective. This corresponds to answer choice C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
