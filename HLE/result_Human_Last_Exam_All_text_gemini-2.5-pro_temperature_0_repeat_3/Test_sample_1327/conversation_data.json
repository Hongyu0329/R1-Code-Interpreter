    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the relationship between consecutive terms.**\nLet the sequence be denoted by `a_n`. The given terms are:\n`a_1 = 2`\n`a_2 = 11`\n`a_3 = 23`\n`a_4 = 51`\n`a_5 = 119`\n\nLet's check for simple patterns like addition or multiplication.\n*   **Differences (Arithmetic Progression):**\n    *   `a_2 - a_1 = 11 - 2 = 9`\n    *   `a_3 - a_2 = 23 - 11 = 12`\n    *   `a_4 - a_3 = 51 - 23 = 28`\n    *   `a_5 - a_4 = 119 - 51 = 68`\n    The differences (9, 12, 28, 68) do not form a simple arithmetic sequence.\n\n*   **Ratios (Geometric Progression):**\n    *   `a_2 / a_1 = 11 / 2 = 5.5`\n    *   `a_3 / a_2 = 23 / 11 â‰ˆ 2.09`\n    The ratios are not constant, so it's not a geometric sequence.\n\n**Step 2: Look for a mixed pattern (multiplication and addition/subtraction).**\nLet's try to find a relationship of the form `a_(n+1) = k * a_n + c`. A common approach is to try `k=2` or `k=3`.\nLet's try `k=2`.\n*   `a_2 = 2 * a_1 + c_1` => `11 = 2 * 2 + c_1` => `11 = 4 + 7` => `c_1 = 7`\n*   `a_3 = 2 * a_2 + c_2` => `23 = 2 * 11 + c_2` => `23 = 22 + 1` => `c_2 = 1`\n*   `a_4 = 2 * a_3 + c_3` => `51 = 2 * 23 + c_3` => `51 = 46 + 5` => `c_3 = 5`\n*   `a_5 = 2 * a_4 + c_4` => `119 = 2 * 51 + c_4` => `119 = 102 + 17` => `c_4 = 17`\n\nThis reveals a consistent primary pattern: `a_(n+1) = 2 * a_n + c_n`. The sequence of the additive term `c_n` is {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the sequence of the additive term `c_n`.**\nNow we need to find the pattern in the sequence `c_n = {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}` to determine the next term, `c_5`.\n*   This sequence is not a simple arithmetic or geometric one. Let's find the differences between its terms. Let's call this difference sequence `dc_n`.\n    *   `dc_1 = c_2 - c_1 = 1 - 7 = -6`\n    *   `dc_2 = c_3 - c_2 = 5 - 1 = 4`\n    *   `dc_3 = c_4 - c_3 = 17 - 5 = 12`\nThe sequence of differences is `dc_n = {-6, 4, 12, ...}`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the sequence of differences `dc_n`.**\nLet's look for a pattern in `{-6, 4, 12, ...}`.\n*   Notice the relationship between the second and third terms: `12 = 3 * 4`.\n*   This suggests a pattern where, starting from the second term, each term is 3 times the previous one. The pattern is `dc_(n+1) = 3 * dc_n` for `n >= 2`.\n\n**Step 5: Predict the next terms.**\n*   Using the pattern found in `dc_n`, we can find the next term, `dc_4`:\n    `dc_4 = 3 * dc_3 = 3 * 12 = 36`.\n*   Now we can find the next term in the `c_n` sequence, `c_5`, using `dc_4`:\n    `dc_4 = c_5 - c_4` => `c_5 = c_4 + dc_4 = 17 + 36 = 53`.\n*   Finally, we can find the missing term in the original sequence, `a_6`, using the primary pattern and `c_5`:\n    `a_6 = 2 * a_5 + c_5`\n    `a_6 = 2 * 119 + 53`\n    `a_6 = 238 + 53`\n    `a_6 = 291`\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe next number in the sequence is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
