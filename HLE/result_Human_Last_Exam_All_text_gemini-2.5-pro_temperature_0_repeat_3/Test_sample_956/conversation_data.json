    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the group G and its generators**\n\nThe group $G$ is generated by three permutations $a, b, c$ on the set $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z\\}$, which has size $|S|=12$. Thus, $G$ is a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_{12}$.\n\nThe generators are:\n$a = (1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 8, y, x)$\n$b = (1, 8, 5, 9)(4, x, 7, 6)$\n$c = (1, 2)(3, z)(4, 8)(5, 6)(7, y)(9, x)$\n\nLet's determine the properties of these generators:\n- The permutation $a$ is a cycle of length 11. Its order is 11. The sign of an $k$-cycle is $(-1)^{k-1}$, so sign(a) = $(-1)^{11-1} = (-1)^{10} = +1$. Thus, $a \\in A_{12}$.\n- The permutation $b$ is a product of two disjoint 4-cycles. Its order is lcm(4, 4) = 4. The sign of $b$ is sign((1,8,5,9)) * sign((4,x,7,6)) = $(-1)^{4-1} \\cdot (-1)^{4-1} = (-1) \\cdot (-1) = +1$. Thus, $b \\in A_{12}$.\n- The permutation $c$ is a product of six disjoint 2-cycles. Its order is 2. The sign of $c$ is $(-1)^6 = +1$. Thus, $c \\in A_{12}$.\n\nSince all generators $a, b, c$ are in the alternating group $A_{12}$, the group $G = \\langle a, b, c \\rangle$ must be a subgroup of $A_{12}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of the group G**\n\nTo identify $G$, we can use classification theorems for permutation groups.\n1.  **Transitivity:** The generator $a$ is an 11-cycle that permutes all elements except $z$. The generator $b$ also fixes $z$. The generator $c$ contains the transposition $(3, z)$, so it moves the element $z$. Since the subgroup $\\langle a, b \\rangle$ acts on $\\{S \\setminus \\{z\\}\\}$ and $c$ maps an element from this set (namely 3) to $z$, the group $G$ is transitive on the set $S$.\n\n2.  **Primitivity:** A transitive group $G$ on a set $S$ is primitive if it preserves no non-trivial partition of $S$. A standard theorem states that a 2-transitive group is primitive. Let's check for 2-transitivity. A group $G$ is 2-transitive if it is transitive and the stabilizer of any point is transitive on the remaining points.\n    Let's consider the stabilizer of the point $z$, denoted $G_z$. The generators $a$ and $b$ fix $z$, so $\\langle a, b \\rangle \\le G_z$. The generator $a$ is an 11-cycle on the remaining 11 points, $S' = S \\setminus \\{z\\}$. A group containing a cycle of length $n$ on a set of $n$ points is transitive. Therefore, $\\langle a, b \\rangle$ is transitive on $S'$. Since $G_z$ contains a subgroup that is transitive on $S'$, $G_z$ itself must be transitive on $S'$.\n    Because $G$ is transitive on $S$ and the stabilizer $G_z$ is transitive on $S \\setminus \\{z\\}$, the group $G$ is 2-transitive. As 2-transitivity implies primitivity, $G$ is a primitive group on 12 points.\n\n3.  **Classification:** We have established that $G$ is a primitive subgroup of $A_{12}$ on 12 points, and it contains an 11-cycle ($a$). The primitive groups on $n$ points containing a cycle of length $n-1$ are highly restricted. The list of such groups on 12 points is:\n    - The projective special linear group $PSL_2(11)$.\n    - The Mathieu group $M_{12}$.\n    - The alternating group $A_{12}$.\n    (The symmetric group $S_{12}$ is also on the full list, but we know $G \\le A_{12}$).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Schur Multiplier A**\n\nThe question asks for properties of the Schur multiplier of $G$, denoted by $A$. The Schur multiplier of a group $H$, denoted $M(H)$, is the second homology group $H_2(H, \\mathbb{Z})$. It is always an abelian group. The phrase \"seen as an abelian group\" is standard, confirming we are interested in its structure as an abelian group.\n\nLet's find the Schur multiplier for each of the possible groups for $G$:\n-   **If $G = PSL_2(11)$:** The Schur multiplier is known to be $M(PSL_2(11)) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n-   **If $G = M_{12}$:** The Schur multiplier of the Mathieu group $M_{12}$ is $M(M_{12}) \\cong C_2$.\n-   **If $G = A_{12}$:** For the alternating group $A_n$, the Schur multiplier is $M(A_n) \\cong C_2$ for all $n \\ge 8$ (with the exception of some specific small $n$). Since $n=12$, $M(A_{12}) \\cong C_2$.\n\nIn all possible cases for the group $G$, its Schur multiplier $A$ is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2.\n$A \\cong C_2$.\n\n*Self-reflection: It is not necessary to distinguish which of the groups $G$ is. The problem is constructed such that the result is the same for all possibilities. This avoids lengthy calculations to pinpoint the exact group structure.*\n\n**Step 4: Count the proper subgroups of A up to isomorphism**\n\nThe group $A$ is isomorphic to $C_2$. Let's list the subgroups of $C_2$.\nLet $C_2 = \\{e, g\\}$ where $e$ is the identity and $g^2=e$. The subgroups of $C_2$ are:\n1.  The trivial subgroup: $\\{e\\}$.\n2.  The group itself: $\\{e, g\\} = C_2$.\n\nA proper subgroup of a group is any subgroup other than the group itself.\nFor $A \\cong C_2$, the only proper subgroup is the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n\nThe question asks to count these proper subgroups \"up to isomorphism\".\nAll trivial groups are isomorphic to each other. The trivial group forms a single isomorphism class.\nSo, there is only one proper subgroup up to isomorphism: the trivial group.\n\nThe number of proper subgroups of $A$ up to isomorphism is 1."
