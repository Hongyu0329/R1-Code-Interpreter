    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n1.  **Poset (Partially Ordered Set):** The problem is set in the context of the divisor poset on the set of integers $S = [1, N]$, where $N = 823564528378596$. The partial order relation is divisibility, denoted by 'a | b' (meaning 'a divides b').\n\n2.  **Antichain:** An antichain is a subset of $S$ where no two distinct elements are comparable. In this poset, an antichain is a set of integers where for any two distinct numbers $x, y$ in the set, neither $x|y$ nor $y|x$. For example, the set of all prime numbers is an antichain.\n\n3.  **Chain:** A chain is a subset of $S$ where all elements are comparable. In this poset, a chain is a sequence of integers $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_m$ such that $x_1 | x_2 | \\dots | x_m$. Since the elements must be distinct, this implies $x_1$ is a proper divisor of $x_2$, etc. For example, $\\{3, 6, 18, 36\\}$ is a chain of length 4.\n\n4.  **Union of Antichains:** We are looking for the maximum possible size of a set that can be formed by taking the union of 20 antichains.\n\n### Step 2: Connecting the Concepts with a Key Theorem\n\nA fundamental result in poset theory is the dual of Dilworth's Theorem, known as Mirsky's Theorem. A direct consequence of this theorem is the following equivalence:\n\n*   A set can be expressed as the union of $k$ antichains if and only if it does not contain a chain of length $k+1$.\n\n**Careful Point:** This theorem is crucial. It transforms the problem from dealing with unions of antichains (which is complex) to a problem about avoiding long chains (which is more structured).\n\nApplying this to our problem:\n*   We are looking for the largest union of $k=20$ antichains.\n*   This is equivalent to finding the largest subset of $[1, N]$ that does not contain a chain of length $k+1 = 21$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Largest Subset with No Chain of Length 21\n\nLet's denote the maximum size of a subset of $[1, N]$ with no chain of length $k+1$ as $f(N, k+1)$. We need to find $f(N, 21)$.\n\nThis is a classic problem in combinatorial number theory. The result is given by the following formula:\n$f(N, k+1) = N - \\lfloor N/2^k \\rfloor$.\n\nLet's analyze why this formula is correct.\n\n1.  **Constructing a Large Set (Lower Bound):**\n    Let $k=20$. Consider the set $U = \\{\\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor + 1, \\dots, N\\}$.\n    *   The size of this set is $N - \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$.\n    *   Let's check if this set can contain a chain of length 21. Let $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_{21}$ be a chain in $U$.\n    *   By definition of a chain, $c_1 | c_2 | \\dots | c_{21}$. This means $c_{i+1} = a_i c_i$ for some integers $a_i \\ge 2$.\n    *   Therefore, $c_{21} \\ge 2^{20} c_1$.\n    *   Since $c_1 \\in U$, we have $c_1 \\ge \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor + 1$.\n    *   Combining these, we get $c_{21} \\ge 2^{20} (\\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor + 1)$.\n    *   We know that for any real number $x$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor > x-1$. So, $\\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor > N/2^{20} - 1$.\n    *   $c_{21} > 2^{20} ( (N/2^{20} - 1) + 1) = 2^{20} (N/2^{20}) = N$.\n    *   So, $c_{21} > N$. But all elements of the chain must be in $[1, N]$, so $c_{21} \\le N$. This is a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, the set $U$ does not contain a chain of length 21.\n    *   This proves that the maximum size is at least $N - \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$.\n\n2.  **Proving Optimality (Upper Bound):**\n    The proof that no larger set can exist is more involved, but it is a known result. It can be shown that for any subset of $[1, N]$ with no chain of length $k+1$, its size is at most $N - \\lfloor N/2^k \\rfloor$. Therefore, the size we found is indeed the maximum.\n\n**Careful Point:** The \"densest\" possible chains are formed by repeatedly multiplying by the smallest possible integer, which is 2. The formula essentially identifies the numbers that can start these long, dense chains ($1, 2, \\dots, \\lfloor N/2^k \\rfloor$) and the size of the maximal set is what remains when these are excluded.\n\n### Step 4: Calculation\n\nNow we just need to apply the formula with the given values.\n\n*   $N = 823564528378596$\n*   $k = 20$\n*   The required size is $N - \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$.\n\n1.  **Calculate $2^{20}$:**\n    $2^{10} = 1024$\n    $2^{20} = (2^{10})^2 = 1024^2 = 1048576$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the floor of the division:**\n    We need to compute $\\lfloor 823564528378596 / 1048576 \\rfloor$.\n    $823564528378596 \\div 1048576 = 785412.53125$\n    $\\lfloor 785412.53125 \\rfloor = 785412$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the final answer:**\n    Size = $N - 785412$\n    Size = $823564528378596 - 785412$\n    Size = $823564527593184$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe largest union of 20 antichains in the given set is the size of the largest subset that does not contain a chain of length 21. Based on the established formula, this size is $N - \\lfloor N/2^{20} \\rfloor$.\n\nThe calculation yields:\n$823564528378596 - \\lfloor 823564528378596 / 2^{20} \\rfloor = 823564528378596 - 785412 = 823564527593184$.\n\n<<<823564527593184>>>"
