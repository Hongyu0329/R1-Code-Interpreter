The local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial; it typically follows the Parker Spiral, making an angle of about 45 degrees to the radial direction. The use of magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction to calculate helicity is an approximation based on Taylor's hypothesis, where the radially flowing solar wind makes a radial-based coordinate system convenient. This approximation is only accurate when the local magnetic field itself is nearly radial. For a rigorous analysis, one must transform the data into a Field-Aligned Coordinate system where the calculation is performed using components perpendicular to the local magnetic field direction.
