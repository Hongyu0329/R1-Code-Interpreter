    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the total welfare.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Market Equilibrium:** This is the point where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded ($Q_S = Q_D = Q_E$) and the price is the same for both supply and demand ($P_S = P_D = P_E$).\n*   **Total Welfare (or Total Surplus):** This is the sum of Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS). It represents the total benefit to society from the production and consumption of a good.\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** The area below the demand curve and above the equilibrium price line, from Q=0 to Q=$Q_E$. The formula is $CS = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} (P_D(Q) - P_E) dQ$.\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** The area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price line, from the quantity where supply starts up to Q=$Q_E$. The formula is $PS = \\int_{Q_{start}}^{Q_E} (P_E - P_S(Q)) dQ$.\n*   **Total Welfare (TW):** $TW = CS + PS$. This can be simplified into a single integral representing the area between the demand and supply curves: $TW = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} P_D(Q) dQ - \\int_{Q_{start}}^{Q_E} P_S(Q) dQ$.\n\n**2. Find the Market Equilibrium (P_E, Q_E)**\n\nTo find the equilibrium, we set the supply and demand functions equal to each other:\n$P_S = P_D$\n$\\ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)}$\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Solving for Q**\n    This is a transcendental equation, which means it cannot be solved for Q using standard algebraic techniques. A numerical method (like Newton's method or using a graphing calculator/software) is required to find the solution.\n*   **Numerical Solution:**\n    By using a numerical solver, we find the equilibrium quantity to be:\n    $Q_E \\approx 4.6856$\n*   **Finding the Equilibrium Price (P_E):**\n    We can substitute $Q_E$ back into either the supply or demand function.\n    Using the supply function: $P_E = \\ln(4.6856^3 - 2) = \\ln(102.88 - 2) = \\ln(100.88) \\approx 4.614$\n    Using the demand function: $P_E = 18e^{-\\arctan(4.6856)} \\approx 18e^{-1.3596} \\approx 18 \\times 0.2567 \\approx 4.621$\n    The small difference is due to rounding $Q_E$. We'll use $P_E \\approx 4.614$.\n\n**3. Set up the Total Welfare Integral**\n\nThe formula for total welfare is the sum of the consumer and producer surpluses. A more direct way is to calculate the total area between the demand and supply curves.\n\n$TW = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} P_D(Q) dQ - \\int_{Q_{start}}^{Q_E} P_S(Q) dQ$\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Finding the Supply Start Quantity ($Q_{start}$)**\n    The producer surplus is calculated from the quantity where the supply curve begins to have a non-negative price. We find this by setting $P_S = 0$.\n    $\\ln(Q^3 - 2) = 0$\n    $Q^3 - 2 = e^0 = 1$\n    $Q^3 = 3$\n    $Q_{start} = \\sqrt[3]{3} \\approx 1.442$\n\n*   **The Definite Integral for Total Welfare:**\n    Substituting the functions and limits we found:\n    $TW = \\int_{0}^{4.6856} 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)} dQ - \\int_{1.442}^{4.6856} \\ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ$\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Welfare**\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Evaluating the Integrals**\n    Similar to finding the equilibrium, the antiderivatives of $18e^{-\\arctan(Q)}$ and $\\ln(Q^3 - 2)$ are not elementary functions. This means we cannot solve these integrals by hand using standard integration techniques. We must again rely on numerical integration.\n\n*   **Numerical Integration:**\n    1.  Calculate the first integral (representing the total area under the demand curve):\n        $\\int_{0}^{4.6856} 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)} dQ \\approx 34.55$\n    2.  Calculate the second integral (representing the total cost area under the supply curve):\n        $\\int_{1.442}^{4.6856} \\ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ \\approx 9.99$\n\n*   **Final Calculation:**\n    $TW \\approx 34.55 - 9.99 = 24.56$\n\nThe total welfare at market equilibrium is approximately 24.56.\n\n<<<24.56>>>"
