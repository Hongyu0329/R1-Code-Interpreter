    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Barbell Graph Structure**\n\n*   A barbell graph is constructed by taking two identical complete graphs (cliques) and connecting them with a single edge (a bridge).\n*   The total number of nodes is `n = 10`. To create a symmetric barbell, we split these nodes into two equal-sized cliques.\n*   This means we have two complete graphs of 5 nodes each, which are denoted as `K_5`.\n*   A single edge, known as the **bottleneck edge**, connects one node from the first `K_5` to one node from the second `K_5`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Degrees of the Nodes**\n\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. We need to find the degrees of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n\n*   Let the bottleneck edge connect node `u` (in the first `K_5`) and node `v` (in the second `K_5`).\n*   **Degree of node `u`:** Inside its own `K_5`, node `u` is connected to the other 4 nodes. Additionally, it is connected to node `v` via the bottleneck edge. So, the degree of `u` is `d(u) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n*   **Degree of node `v`:** Similarly, node `v` is connected to the other 4 nodes in its `K_5` and to node `u`. So, the degree of `v` is `d(v) = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n*   **Degree of other nodes:** Any other node within either `K_5` is only connected to the other 4 nodes in its own clique. Their degree is 4.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Randomized Uniform Gossiping Process**\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping is a process for information spreading in a network. A single step of this process, which corresponds to \"sampling an edge\", works as follows:\n\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from the set of all `N` nodes. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/N`.\n2.  The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to communicate with. If the selected node has degree `d`, the probability of it choosing any specific neighbor is `1/d`.\n\nThe \"sampling of an edge\" `(u, v)` occurs if either node `u` selects node `v` or node `v` selects node `u`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Probability of Sampling the Bottleneck Edge**\n\nLet the bottleneck edge be `(u, v)`. We need to calculate the probability that this edge is activated in one step of the gossiping process.\n\n*   Total number of nodes, `N = 10`.\n*   Degree of node `u`, `d(u) = 5`.\n*   Degree of node `v`, `d(v) = 5`.\n\nThe event \"bottleneck edge is sampled\" can happen in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  Node `u` is chosen, and it selects its neighbor `v`.\n2.  Node `v` is chosen, and it selects its neighbor `u`.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of each case:\n*   **Probability of Case 1:**\n    *   Probability of choosing node `u` = `1/N = 1/10`.\n    *   Probability of `u` choosing `v` (given `u` was chosen) = `1/d(u) = 1/5`.\n    *   `P(u chooses v) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\n*   **Probability of Case 2:**\n    *   Probability of choosing node `v` = `1/N = 1/10`.\n    *   Probability of `v` choosing `u` (given `v` was chosen) = `1/d(v) = 1/5`.\n    *   `P(v chooses u) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases:\n`P(bottleneck) = P(u chooses v) + P(v chooses u)`\n`P(bottleneck) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50`\n`P(bottleneck) = 1/25`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Graph Definition:** It is crucial to correctly model the 10-node barbell graph as two `K_5` cliques joined by a single edge.\n2.  **Node Degrees:** The calculation hinges on the correct degrees of the nodes connected by the bottleneck. An error here would propagate through the entire calculation. The nodes on the bottleneck have a higher degree (5) than the other nodes (4).\n3.  **Sampling Process:** The most important point is understanding that \"randomized uniform gossiping\" does *not* sample edges uniformly from the set of all edges. The probability of an edge being sampled depends on the degrees of the nodes it connects. An edge connected to high-degree nodes is less likely to be chosen by those nodes, as they have more options.\n4.  **Undirected Edge:** Remember that an undirected edge `(u, v)` can be activated from either direction (`u` to `v` or `v` to `u`), so both probabilities must be calculated and summed.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   Total Nodes `N = 10`.\n*   Nodes on bottleneck edge: `u` and `v`.\n*   Degrees: `d(u) = 5`, `d(v) = 5`.\n*   Probability Formula: `P(edge(u,v)) = (1/N) * (1/d(u)) + (1/N) * (1/d(v))`\n*   `P(bottleneck) = (1/10) * (1/5) + (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`.\n\nThe probability is 1/25, or 0.04.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
