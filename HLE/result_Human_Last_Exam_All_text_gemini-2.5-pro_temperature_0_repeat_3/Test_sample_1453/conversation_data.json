    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics of Coiled-Coil Structure**\nCoiled-coils are protein structural motifs where two or more alpha-helices are coiled together like a rope. Their structure is defined by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The stability and oligomeric state (i.e., the number of helices) are primarily determined by the packing of amino acid side chains at the core positions, `a` and `d`. This packing is often described as a \"knobs-into-holes\" interaction, where a side chain (\"knob\") from one helix fits into a space (\"hole\") created by side chains on an adjacent helix.\n\n**Step 2: Assign the Heptad Repeat to the Given Sequence**\nThe provided sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\nThe length of the sequence is 28 amino acids. Since 28 is a multiple of 7 (28 = 4 x 7), the sequence consists of exactly four heptad repeats. We can assign the `abcdefg` positions starting from the beginning of the sequence.\n\n*   **Sequence:**   `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n*   **Register:**   `a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Core Residues at Positions `a` and `d`**\nThe amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions form the core of the coiled-coil and are the most critical for determining its oligomeric state.\n\n*   **Residues at position `a`:** G (Glycine), K (Lysine), K (Lysine), K (Lysine)\n*   **Residues at position `d`:** A (Alanine), A (Alanine), W (Tryptophan), A (Alanine)\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Properties of the Core Residues**\n*   **`a` position residues (G, K, K, K):** Glycine is the smallest amino acid. Lysine is a large, positively charged (polar) amino acid. The `a` positions are therefore predominantly polar and charged.\n*   **`d` position residues (A, A, W, A):** Alanine is a small hydrophobic amino acid. Tryptophan is a very large hydrophobic amino acid. The `d` positions are therefore exclusively hydrophobic.\n\nThis gives us a distinct pattern where the `a` positions are polar and the `d` positions are hydrophobic.\n\n**Step 5: Relate Core Composition to Oligomeric State based on Packing Efficiency**\nDifferent oligomeric states have different packing geometries and therefore prefer different types of amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions.\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Typically requires hydrophobic residues at both `a` and `d` positions to form a stable hydrophobic core. The presence of charged Lysines at the `a` positions would be highly destabilizing due to burial of charge and repulsion, making a dimer very unlikely.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** Also relies on a hydrophobic core. While some small polar residues (like Asparagine) can sometimes be found at the `a` position, having three large, positively charged Lysine side chains pointing into the core at the same level would create immense electrostatic repulsion. This makes a trimer unlikely.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** The packing in a four-helix bundle is different. A well-established motif for parallel tetramers is having polar residues at the `a` position and hydrophobic residues at the `d` position. In this arrangement, the four polar `a` side chains can form a \"polar zipper\" or a solvent-accessible channel down the central axis of the bundle. This isolates the charged groups from the main hydrophobic core. The hydrophobic `d` residues then pack efficiently against the outside of this central channel and the adjacent helices. The `a=polar, d=hydrophobic` pattern seen in the sequence is a classic hallmark of a tetramer.\n*   **Higher-order Oligomers (5+ helices):** These are less common and have even more specific sequence requirements, often related to the relative sizes of the residues at the `a` and `d` positions, which do not perfectly match this sequence.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe sequence exhibits a clear `a=polar, d=hydrophobic` pattern within its heptad repeats. This specific arrangement of core residues is known to be unfavorable for dimeric and trimeric coiled-coils but is highly characteristic of and efficiently accommodated by the packing geometry of a **tetrameric (4-helix)** coiled-coil.\n\n<<<C>>>"
