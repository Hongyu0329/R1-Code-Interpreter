    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Premise of the Question\nThe question asks for the Modern English word for \"sister\" under a hypothetical condition: that the Norse (Vikings) never invaded and settled in England between the 7th and 12th centuries. This requires us to understand the linguistic impact of the Norse on the English language and then trace the development of the original English word without that influence.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Origin of the Current Word \"Sister\"\nThe first step is to identify the etymology of our current word, \"sister\".\n*   **Current Word:** sister\n*   **Origin:** The word \"sister\" was borrowed into English from Old Norse. The Old Norse word was *systir*.\n*   **Conclusion:** This confirms that the very word we use today is a direct result of the Norse interaction. Therefore, if this interaction had not occurred, we would not be using the word \"sister\".\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Native Old English Word\nBefore the Norse influence, the Anglo-Saxons had their own native word for the concept.\n*   **Old English Word:** *sweostor*\n*   **Pronunciation (approximate):** /ˈswe.os.tor/\n*   **Proto-Germanic Root:** Both the Old English *sweostor* and the Old Norse *systir* descend from the same Proto-Germanic root, **swestēr*. This is why they are so similar. Other related words in Germanic languages include *Schwester* (German) and *zuster* (Dutch).\n\n### Step 4: Trace the Hypothetical Evolution of the Old English Word\nNow, we must project how the Old English word *sweostor* would have evolved into Modern English if it had not been replaced by the Old Norse *systir*. We can do this by observing regular sound changes that affected other native English words.\n\n1.  **Old English to Middle English:**\n    *   The Old English *sweostor* would have undergone changes common in the transition to Middle English. The initial `sweo-` diphthong would likely simplify, and the unstressed final vowel in `-or` would weaken to `-er`.\n    *   In Middle English, the word appeared in various forms, but the most common native (non-Norse) form was **suster**. This form shows the loss of the 'w' after the 's' (a common simplification, similar to how *swā* became *so*) and the simplification of the vowel. The form *suster* is well-attested in Middle English texts, existing alongside the Norse-derived *sister*.\n\n2.  **Middle English to Modern English:**\n    *   We now trace the Middle English form **suster** forward. The key sound to watch is the vowel 'u'.\n    *   In Middle English, this 'u' was pronounced like the 'u' in the modern word \"put\" or \"full\".\n    *   During the development of Modern English, a major sound change occurred where this short /u/ sound unrounded to become /ʌ/ (the \"uh\" sound in \"cut\" or \"sun\"). This is known as the STRUT-vowel split.\n    *   We can see this exact change in other words:\n        *   Middle English *sunne* -> Modern English *sun*\n        *   Middle English *lufu* -> Modern English *love*\n        *   Middle English *butere* -> Modern English *butter*\n    *   Applying this same, regular sound change to *suster* would result in the modern pronunciation /ˈsʌstər/.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Final Form\nBased on the regular phonological development of English, the Old English word *sweostor* would have evolved through the Middle English form *suster* to become the Modern English word **suster**. This word did, in fact, survive in some English dialects for many centuries but was ultimately displaced in Standard English by the Norse-derived \"sister\".\n\n***\n\n<<<suster>>>"
