    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Action:** A character visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Description:** This character describes the religious practices or founding myth of that city.\n    *   **Specific Allusion:** The description must be recognizable to the reader as the story of Romulus and Remus.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Characters:** The main characters in the novel are Thiodolf (the leader of the Wolfings), Hall-Sun (his foster-daughter), and the Wood-Sun (Hall-Sun's mother, a supernatural being). Other characters include various kinsmen and elders of the tribe.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Scene:** The question points to a specific eventâ€”a character recounting a trip to a Roman city. This would likely be a significant speech or memory. We need to find a passage where a character discusses Roman culture based on firsthand experience. The most likely candidate to have had such an experience is the leader, Thiodolf, who would have the most interaction with the world outside his immediate tribe.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Allusion to Romulus and Remus:** The key elements of the Romulus and Remus myth are:\n    *   Two twin brothers.\n    *   Abandoned as infants.\n    *   Suckled and cared for by a she-wolf.\n    *   They go on to found a great city (Rome).\n    The character's description must contain these elements, particularly the she-wolf and the two infants.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Character and Passage:** In Chapter V, titled \"Thiodolf telleth of the Chow-men\" (the Goths' term for the Romans), Thiodolf addresses his people. He is preparing them for the coming war with the Romans and shares his knowledge of them. In this speech, he recounts a journey he once took to one of their great cities.\n\n6.  **Examine the Character's Description:** During his speech, Thiodolf describes the Romans' origin story as he heard it from them. He says:\n    > \"...they have a tale of their first father and his brother, and how they were cast away in the wild-wood, and were suckled by a she-wolf; and in all their temples and hallowed places ye may see the image of that she-wolf and the two babes at her dugs.\"\n\n7.  **Confirm the Match:**\n    *   **Character:** Thiodolf.\n    *   **Visited a Roman city:** Yes, he explicitly states he journeyed to one of their cities.\n    *   **Describes their practices/myth:** Yes, he describes their founding myth.\n    *   **Refers to Romulus and Remus:** The description of a \"first father and his brother\" who were \"suckled by a she-wolf\" is an unmistakable reference to the legend of Romulus and Remus. The mention of seeing the \"image of that she-wolf and the two babes\" in their temples directly refers to the famous Capitoline Wolf statue, a primary symbol of Rome.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Name of the Romans:** Morris uses the term \"Chow-men\" or \"Chew-men\" for the Romans in the dialogue of the Gothic characters, reflecting a potential historical or linguistic distinction from the Goths' perspective.\n*   **Thematic Irony:** It is highly significant that Thiodolf, the leader of the *Wolfings*, is the one who relates the story of the Romans being founded by children suckled by a wolf. This creates a deep thematic irony, connecting the identity of the Gothic tribe with the origin myth of their imperial enemies.\n*   **Source of Knowledge:** The character's knowledge is presented as firsthand observation from a past journey, which gives his account authority within the story.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the character who visited a Roman city and described the myth of its founders being suckled by a she-wolf is the war-leader of the Wolfings, Thiodolf.\n\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
