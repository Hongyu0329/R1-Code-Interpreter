**1) Hotspots for interaction (binding to alpha-1 subunit):**
The key residues are located in the Alpha Binding Pocket (ABP) of the guanylate kinase-like (GK) domain of the human beta-1b subunit (UniProt Q02641). These residues form a hydrophobic groove that binds the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit.
*   Tyrosine 260 (Y260)
*   Leucine 298 (L298)
*   Valine 300 (V300)
*   Isoleucine 302 (I302)
*   Tryptophan 338 (W338)
*   Isoleucine 340 (I340)
*   Phenylalanine 342 (F342)
*   Leucine 381 (L381)
*   Valine 383 (V383)
*   Tyrosine 413 (Y413)
*   Leucine 415 (L415)

**2) Hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties (gating modulation):**
These residues modulate channel function, particularly inactivation, often without disrupting the primary binding interaction.
*   **Tryptophan 160 (W160):** Located in the SH3 domain. It is a critical residue for the modulation of inactivation kinetics.
*   **Tyrosine 162 (Y162):** Also in the SH3 domain. It works in concert with W160 to control the modulatory effect on channel inactivation.
