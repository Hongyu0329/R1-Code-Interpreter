The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0(k, E)$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ is an inverse linear relationship of the form $G_0(k, E) = (E - \epsilon_k + i\eta)^{-1}$, where $E$ is the energy variable and $i\eta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality.
