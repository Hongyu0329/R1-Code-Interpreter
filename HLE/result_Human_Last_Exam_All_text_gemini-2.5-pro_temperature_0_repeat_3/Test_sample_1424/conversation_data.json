    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including careful points to consider.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nThe Green's function, in general, is a propagator. It describes the probability amplitude for a particle (or excitation) to travel from one spacetime point to another. The *bare* Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, specifically describes this propagation in a **non-interacting** system.\n\nIn the operator formalism, the time-ordered (or causal) Green's function is defined as the ground state expectation value of the time-ordered product of field creation and annihilation operators:\n$G_0(x, x') = -i \\langle \\Omega | T[\\psi(x) \\psi^\\dagger(x')] | \\Omega \\rangle$\nwhere $x = (t, \\mathbf{r})$, $|\\Omega\\rangle$ is the non-interacting ground state, and $T$ is the time-ordering operator.\n\n**Step 2: Express the Green's Function as a Path Integral**\n\nThe Feynman path integral formalism provides an alternative, and often more powerful, way to calculate expectation values. In this formalism, the Green's function is given by a functional integral over all possible field configurations:\n\n$G_0(x, x') = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x) \\psi^*(x') \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}$\n\nHere, $S_0$ is the action for the non-interacting system. The denominator is a normalization factor.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$)**\n\nThe functional dependence on the energy eigenvalues arises from the structure of the action. For a general non-interacting, non-relativistic system, the action is:\n\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\int d^d\\mathbf{r} \\, \\psi^*(\\mathbf{r}, t) \\left( i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0 \\right) \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\n(We set $\\hbar=1$ for simplicity, which is standard practice).\n$\\hat{H}_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator. For a free particle, $\\hat{H}_0 = -\\frac{\\nabla^2}{2m}$.\n\n**Step 4: Diagonalize the Action in the Energy Eigenbasis**\n\nThe key to simplifying the path integral is to work in a basis where the operator in the action, $(i\\partial_t - \\hat{H}_0)$, is diagonal. The operator $\\hat{H}_0$ is diagonal in its own eigenbasis. Let $|k\\rangle$ be the eigenstates of $\\hat{H}_0$ with corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$:\n$\\hat{H}_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$\n\nWe can expand the field $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ in this basis:\n$\\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\sum_k \\phi_k(\\mathbf{r}) c_k(t)$\nwhere $\\phi_k(\\mathbf{r}) = \\langle \\mathbf{r} | k \\rangle$ are the single-particle wavefunctions.\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the action and using the orthonormality of the eigenstates ($\\int d^d\\mathbf{r} \\, \\phi_k^*(\\mathbf{r})\\phi_{k'}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\delta_{kk'}$), the action separates into a sum over independent modes $k$:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\, c_k^*(t) \\left( i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k \\right) c_k(t)$\n\n**Step 5: Transform to the Energy-Momentum Representation**\n\nThe action is still not fully diagonal due to the time derivative. To diagonalize it completely, we perform a Fourier transform from the time domain to the energy (or frequency) domain:\n$c_k(t) = \\int \\frac{dE}{2\\pi} \\, c_k(E) e^{-iEt}$\n\nThe time derivative operator becomes a simple multiplication: $i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow E$.\nThe action in the $(k, E)$ basis becomes fully diagonal:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int \\frac{dE}{2\\pi} \\, c_k^*(E) (E - \\epsilon_k) c_k(E)$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Green's Function in the $(k, E)$ Basis**\n\nThe Green's function in this basis, $G_0(k, E)$, is the Fourier transform of $G_0(k, t-t')$. The path integral for this component is a standard Gaussian integral. The result of such an integral is simply the inverse of the quadratic operator in the action.\n\nThe operator for mode $k$ is $(E - \\epsilon_k)$.\nTherefore, the Green's function is its inverse:\n$G_0(k, E) = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Step 7: Incorporate the Feynman Boundary Conditions**\n\nThe expression above has a pole at $E = \\epsilon_k$. The time-ordering prescription in the original definition of $G_0$ dictates how to handle this singularity. It requires adding an infinitesimal imaginary part, $i\\eta$ (or $i\\delta$), to the denominator. This is known as the Feynman prescription. This small imaginary part ensures causality by shifting the pole slightly off the real axis, which determines the contour of integration when transforming back to the time domain.\n\nThe correct form is:\n$G_0(k, E) = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(E - \\mu)}$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the chemical potential (or Fermi energy). This is often written more simply as:\n$G_0(k, E) = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\nwhere it is understood that $\\eta \\to 0^+$ for particle states ($\\epsilon_k > \\mu$) and $\\eta \\to 0^-$ for hole states ($\\epsilon_k < \\mu$).\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Interacting:** This result is only for the *bare* Green's function ($G_0$). In an interacting system, the full Green's function $G$ has a more complex structure involving the self-energy, $\\Sigma(k, E)$, such that $G(k, E) = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_k - \\Sigma(k, E)}$.\n2.  **Choice of Basis:** The simple inverse form is only manifest in the energy-momentum representation, i.e., the basis that diagonalizes the non-interacting Hamiltonian.\n3.  **The Role of $i\\eta$:** The infinitesimal imaginary term $i\\eta$ is not a mathematical convenience but a crucial physical component that arises directly from the path integral definition of the time-ordered product. It ensures the correct causal propagation of particles and holes.\n4.  **Representation:** The question asks for the functional dependence. The most direct answer is found in the energy-momentum representation. In real space, the dependence is more complex, being a sum over all eigenmodes: $G_0(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r}', E) = \\sum_k \\frac{\\phi_k(\\mathbf{r})\\phi_k^*(\\mathbf{r}')}{E - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$.\n5.  **Formalism:** This result holds for both zero-temperature (Feynman) and finite-temperature (Matsubara) formalisms. In the latter, the continuous energy $E$ is replaced by a discrete imaginary Matsubara frequency $i\\omega_n$, leading to $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$. The fundamental inverse relationship remains.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe bare Green's function $G_0$, when expressed in the basis of the single-particle Hamiltonian's eigenstates (the energy-momentum representation), has a simple pole structure. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is that of an **inverse linear function**.\n\nSpecifically, for a given momentum/state index $k$ and energy $E$, the bare Green's function is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, E) = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nwhere $\\eta$ is an infinitesimal real number whose sign ensures causal boundary conditions. The function has a single pole on the complex energy plane located at $E = \\epsilon_k - i\\eta$. The location of this pole is directly determined by the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0(k, E)$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is an inverse linear relationship of the form $G_0(k, E) = (E - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta)^{-1}$, where $E$ is the energy variable and $i\\eta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality.>>>"
