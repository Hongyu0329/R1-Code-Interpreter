The most likely reason a functional MRI coil does not show resonance during a bench test is that it is in a non-operational, "decoupled" state. Modern coils use active electronic circuits (like PIN diodes) that intentionally detune the coil to protect it during the high-power transmit phase of the MRI scan. On the test bench, without the necessary control signals and DC power from the scanner, these circuits default to this safe, non-resonant state. Additionally, unpowered preamplifiers connected to the coil can load the circuit and dampen its resonance, making it undetectable with a simple probe.
