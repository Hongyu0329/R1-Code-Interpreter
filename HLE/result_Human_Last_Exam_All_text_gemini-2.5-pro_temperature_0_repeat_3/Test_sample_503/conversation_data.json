    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category consists of a pair of 1-morphisms $L: A \\to B$ and $R: B \\to A$ and 2-morphisms (unit and counit) satisfying certain axioms. In the specific context of the simplex category $\\Delta$ viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, this structure simplifies significantly.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-category.**\n*   **Objects:** The objects are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. These are viewed as posets with the standard ordering.\n*   **1-morphisms:** A 1-morphism from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$, i.e., if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **2-morphisms:** For two parallel 1-morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism $f \\Rightarrow g$ exists if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. This is the pointwise order on the set of morphisms.\n\n**Step 2: Understand internal adjunctions in this context.**\nWe are looking for an adjunction from $[23]$ to $[37]$. Let $A = [23]$ and $B = [37]$. An adjunction consists of a pair of 1-morphisms, a left adjoint $L: [23] \\to [37]$ and a right adjoint $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\nIn a poset-enriched setting like this, the condition for $(L, R)$ to be an adjoint pair is that for all $i \\in [23]$ and $j \\in [37]$, the following equivalence holds:\n$L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$.\nThis is the definition of a Galois connection between the posets $[23]$ and $[37]$. An adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint $L$ or the right adjoint $R$. Therefore, to find the number of adjunctions, we can count the number of possible left adjoints $L$ or the number of possible right adjoints $R$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the left adjoints.**\nA map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it has a right adjoint $R$. A right adjoint $R(j)$ is defined as the maximum element of the set $\\{i \\in [23] \\mid L(i) \\le j\\}$. For this maximum to exist for all $j \\in [37]$, the set must be non-empty. Since $[23]$ is a finite total order, any non-empty subset has a maximum.\nThe condition that $\\{i \\in [23] \\mid L(i) \\le j\\}$ is non-empty for all $j \\in [37]$ simplifies. If it holds for $j=0$, it holds for all $j > 0$ because $L$ is order-preserving. So, we only need $\\{i \\in [23] \\mid L(i) \\le 0\\}$ to be non-empty. This means there must be some $i$ such that $L(i)=0$. As $L$ is order-preserving, $L(0) \\le L(i)$, which forces $L(0)=0$.\nConversely, if $L(0)=0$, then for any $j \\in [37]$, the set $\\{i \\in [23] \\mid L(i) \\le j\\}$ contains $0$ and is thus non-empty.\nSo, a map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it is order-preserving and $L(0)=0$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of left adjoints.**\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is determined by the sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ which must satisfy $L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$, with each $L(i) \\in [37] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value. So we need to count the number of sequences satisfying:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\nThis is equivalent to choosing a non-decreasing sequence of 23 numbers, $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$, from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. We are choosing $k=23$ items (the values of $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from a set of $n=38$ possible values (the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$) with replacement, where the order of selection doesn't matter as they will be arranged non-decreasingly.\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} $$\nHere, $k=23$ and $n=38$.\nNumber of adjunctions = $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n**Step 5: Verification (optional but recommended).**\nWe can also count the number of right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$. A similar argument shows that an order-preserving map $R$ is a right adjoint if and only if $R(37)=23$.\nWe need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(37)$ where the values are in $[23]$ and $R(37)=23$.\nThis means we need to choose the 37 values $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ as a non-decreasing sequence from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\nHere, the number of items to choose is $k=37$, and the number of possible values is $n=24$.\nThe number of ways is $\\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nUsing the identity $\\binom{N}{K} = \\binom{N}{N-K}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\nThe results match, confirming our analysis.\n\nThe final answer is the number of such maps."
