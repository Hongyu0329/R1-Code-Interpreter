    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Start of the War:** The Second Great War begins with the start of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official StarCraft lore and timeline, this occurs in the year **2504**. The inciting incident is the renewed Zerg invasion of the Terran Dominion, starting with the attack on Mar Sara.\n\n2.  **Identify the End of the War:** The war encompasses the events of all three *StarCraft II* installments. It concludes with the final defeat of the main antagonist, Amon, in the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*. These final events take place in the year **2506**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Time Span:** The war's events span across three distinct calendar years:\n    *   **2504:** Events of *Wings of Liberty*.\n    *   **2505:** Events of *Heart of the Swarm*.\n    *   **2506:** Events of *Legacy of the Void* and the *Into the Void* epilogue.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Exact Duration:**\n    *   The war lasts for the entirety of the year 2505, which is 1 full year.\n    *   It also includes a portion of the year 2504 and a portion of the year 2506.\n    *   While the exact number of months or days is not specified in the lore, the campaigns themselves depict events that take a significant amount of time (weeks or months for each).\n    *   Therefore, the total duration is 1 full year (2505) plus the time elapsed in 2504 and 2506.\n    *   Given the scale of the campaigns, it is extremely likely that the time in 2504 and 2506 combined is more than another full year. This means the total duration is greater than 2 years. For example, if the war started in March 2504 and ended in May 2506, the duration would be 2 years and 2 months.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Rule:** The question specifically asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**.\n    *   We have established that the duration is greater than 2 years but less than 3 years.\n    *   When you round any number greater than 2.0 up to the nearest whole number, the result is 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing Time Span from Duration:** The war *spans* three calendar years, but its actual *duration* is not a full three years. It's crucial not to confuse these two concepts.\n*   **The \"Rounded Up\" Instruction:** This is the key to the final answer. Without this instruction, \"approximately 2 years\" might be a reasonable answer. However, \"rounded up\" requires us to take any duration over 2 years (e.g., 2 years and 1 day) and round it to 3.\n*   **Lore Consistency:** The timeline of 2504-2506 is consistently referenced in official Blizzard lore sources and fan-curated wikis based on that lore.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   Start Year: 2504\n*   End Year: 2506\n*   Duration: > 2 years\n*   Rounding Up > 2 years = 3 years\n\n<<<3>>>"
