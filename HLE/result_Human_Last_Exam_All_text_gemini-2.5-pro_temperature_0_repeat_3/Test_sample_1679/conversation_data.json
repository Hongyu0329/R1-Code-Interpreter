    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Object:** A Luxor Obelisk.\n    *   **Action:** Depicted on-screen.\n    *   **Film Criteria:** Must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n    *   **Temporal Element:** Must be the *first* such winner.\n\n2.  **Identify the Locations of the Luxor Obelisks:**\n    To find a film depicting a Luxor Obelisk, we first need to know where they are located. The two Luxor Obelisks, originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt, are now in two different locations:\n    *   One remains at the entrance to the **Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt**.\n    *   The other was transported to France in the 19th century and now stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde in Paris, France**.\n    Therefore, the film in question must feature scenes shot or set in either Luxor, Egypt, or Paris's Place de la Concorde.\n\n3.  **Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners:**\n    We must examine the list of Best Picture winners chronologically, starting from the first award in 1927/28, and check their settings.\n\n    *   **1st (1927/28) - *Wings***: Set during World War I in the United States and France. While set in France, it focuses on battlefields and airfields, not Parisian landmarks.\n    *   **2nd (1928/29) - *The Broadway Melody***: Set in New York City.\n    *   **3rd (1929/30) - *All Quiet on the Western Front***: Set on the German front during World War I.\n    *   **4th (1930/31) - *Cimarron***: Set in Oklahoma.\n    *   **5th (1931/32) - *Grand Hotel***: Set in Berlin, Germany.\n    *   **6th (1932/33) - *Cavalcade***: Set in London, England.\n    *   **7th (1934) - *It Happened One Night***: Set in the United States (Florida to New York).\n    *   **8th (1935) - *Mutiny on the Bounty***: Set in England and the South Pacific.\n    *   **9th (1936) - *The Great Ziegfeld***: Set primarily in New York City.\n\n4.  **Identify the First Winner Set in a Relevant Location:**\n    Continuing the chronological list, we arrive at the 10th Academy Awards.\n\n    *   **10th (1937) - *The Life of Emile Zola***: This film is a biographical picture about the famous French writer Emile Zola. The vast majority of the film is set in **Paris, France**. As a film that seeks to establish a strong sense of its Parisian setting, it includes shots and montages of famous city landmarks. The Place de la Concorde, with its highly recognizable obelisk, is one such landmark depicted in the film to establish the location.\n\n5.  **Verify and Conclude:**\n    Since none of the first nine Best Picture winners were set in Paris or Luxor, *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is the first winner to be set in a location containing a Luxor Obelisk. The film does indeed feature on-screen depictions of Parisian landmarks, including the Place de la Concorde.\n\n    Later winners like *An American in Paris* (1951), *Gigi* (1958), and *Midnight in Paris* (2011) also feature the obelisk in Paris, but they are not the *first*. No film that won Best Picture and was set in Luxor, Egypt, predates 1937. Therefore, *The Life of Emile Zola* is the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Specificity of \"Luxor Obelisk\":** It was crucial to know that there are two, and one is in Paris. A search for just \"obelisk\" would be too broad.\n*   **Chronological Order:** The question asks for the \"first\" winner, making a chronological review of the winners essential.\n*   **Film's Setting vs. Plot:** A film's plot might not revolve around the landmark, but the landmark can still be \"depicted on-screen\" in an establishing shot, montage, or background scene.\n*   **Verification:** Confirming that *The Life of Emile Zola* actually shows the landmark is the final check. The film uses montages of the city to set the scene, which include the Place de la Concorde.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
