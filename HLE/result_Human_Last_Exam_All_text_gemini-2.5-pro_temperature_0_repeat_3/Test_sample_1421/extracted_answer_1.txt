The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is $Z = \int \mathcal{D}\bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi \, e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$, where the integral is a functional integral over all Grassmann fields $\psi(\tau)$ and $\bar{\psi}(\tau)$ that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions, $\psi(\beta) = -\psi(0)$. The Euclidean action is given by $S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left( \bar{\psi}(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi(\tau) + H(\bar{\psi}(\tau), \psi(\tau)) \right)$, with $\beta$ being the inverse temperature and $H(\bar{\psi}, \psi)$ being the classical Hamiltonian function expressed in terms of the Grassmann fields.
