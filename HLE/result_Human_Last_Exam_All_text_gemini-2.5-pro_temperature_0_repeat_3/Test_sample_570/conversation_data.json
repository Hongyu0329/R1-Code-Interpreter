    "Answering this question involves several steps: understanding the set of lines, formulating the condition on the convex domain, finding a candidate domain, and then proving that this domain has the minimal possible area.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the set of lines**\n\nThe lines are given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`). Let's call this set of lines `L`.\n\nExamples of lines in `L`:\n*   `p=1, q=0`: `x = 1`\n*   `p=-1, q=0`: `x = -1`\n*   `p=0, q=1`: `y = 1`\n*   `p=0, q=-1`: `y = -1`\n*   `p=1, q=1`: `x + y = 1`\n*   `p=1, q=-1`: `x - y = 1`\n*   `p=-1, q=1`: `-x + y = 1`\n*   `p=-1, q=-1`: `-x - y = 1`\n\nThe condition `gcd(p, q) = 1` is crucial. By Bézout's identity, it implies that for each line `px + qy = 1`, there exist integers `x₀, y₀` that satisfy the equation. This means every line in `L` passes through at least one integer lattice point. Furthermore, if a line `px + qy = 1` passes through an integer point `(x₀, y₀)`, then `px₀ + qy₀ = 1`, which implies that `gcd(x₀, y₀) = 1`. Such an integer point is called a primitive lattice point.\n\n**Step 2: Formulating the condition on the convex domain**\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. The condition is that for every line `l` in the set `L`, the intersection `K ∩ l` is not empty.\n\nThis means that `K` cannot be entirely contained in either of the two open half-planes defined by any line `l ∈ L`.\nLet `h_K(p, q) = sup {px + qy | (x, y) ∈ K}` be the support function of `K`. The condition that `K` intersects `px + qy = 1` can be written as:\n`inf_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_{(x,y)∈K} (px + qy)`\nThis is equivalent to `-h_K(-p, -q) ≤ 1` and `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1`.\nSince `gcd(p, q) = 1` implies `gcd(-p, -q) = 1`, the set of vectors `(p, q)` is symmetric with respect to the origin. The condition simplifies to `h_K(p, q) ≥ 1` for all coprime integers `p, q`.\n\n**Step 3: Finding a candidate domain**\n\nLet's test some simple convex shapes.\n1.  **The square `Q = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`**:\n    The support function is `h_Q(p, q) = sup{|x|≤1, |y|≤1} (px + qy) = |p| + |q|`.\n    For any coprime integers `p, q`, they cannot both be zero. So `|p| ≥ 1` or `|q| ≥ 1` (or both). Thus, `|p| + |q| ≥ 1`. The condition is satisfied. The area of `Q` is `2 × 2 = 4`.\n\n2.  **The disk `D = {(x, y) | x² + y² ≤ 1}`**:\n    The support function is `h_D(p, q) = sqrt(p² + q²)`.\n    For any coprime integers `p, q`, `p² + q² ≥ 1`. Thus, `sqrt(p² + q²) ≥ 1`. The condition is satisfied. The area of `D` is `π ≈ 3.14159`.\n\n3.  **The diamond `S = {(x, y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1}`**:\n    This is a square rotated by 45 degrees with vertices at `(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)`.\n    The support function is `h_S(p, q) = sup{|x|+|y|≤1} (px + qy) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    For any coprime integers `p, q`, they are not both zero, so `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`. The condition is satisfied. The area of `S` is `(1/2) × 2 × 2 = 2`.\n\nComparing the areas `4`, `π`, and `2`, the diamond `S` is the best candidate so far.\n\n**Step 4: Proving minimality**\n\nWe need to prove that any convex domain `K` satisfying the condition must have an area of at least 2.\n\n1.  **Change of Coordinates**: Let's introduce a new coordinate system:\n    `u = x + y`\n    `v = x - y`\n    The inverse transformation is `x = (u + v)/2`, `y = (u - v)/2`.\n    The Jacobian of this transformation is `J = det([[∂x/∂u, ∂x/∂v], [∂y/∂u, ∂y/∂v]]) = det([[1/2, 1/2], [1/2, -1/2]]) = -1/4 - 1/4 = -1/2`.\n    The area element transforms as `dx dy = |J| du dv = (1/2) du dv`.\n    Therefore, `Area(K) = (1/2) Area(K')`, where `K'` is the domain `K` in the `(u, v)` coordinate system.\n\n2.  **Transforming the Lines**: We need to see what the lines from `L` look like in the new coordinates. Let's focus on four specific lines:\n    *   `x = 1` (`p=1, q=0`): `(u+v)/2 = 1`  => `u + v = 2`\n    *   `x = -1` (`p=-1, q=0`): `(u+v)/2 = -1` => `u + v = -2`\n    *   `y = 1` (`p=0, q=1`): `(u-v)/2 = 1`  => `u - v = 2`\n    *   `y = -1` (`p=0, q=-1`): `(u-v)/2 = -1` => `u - v = -2`\n\n3.  **Condition on the Transformed Domain `K'`**: The domain `K` must intersect these four lines. This means the transformed domain `K'` must intersect the four lines `u+v=2`, `u+v=-2`, `u-v=2`, and `u-v=-2`.\n\n4.  **Geometric Lower Bound**: These four lines in the `(u, v)`-plane form a square, let's call it `Q'`. The vertices of `Q'` are the intersection points of these lines:\n    *   `u+v=2` and `u-v=2` => `u=2, v=0`. Vertex: `(2, 0)`.\n    *   `u+v=2` and `u-v=-2` => `u=0, v=2`. Vertex: `(0, 2)`.\n    *   `u+v=-2` and `u-v=2` => `u=0, v=-2`. Vertex: `(0, -2)`.\n    *   `u+v=-2` and `u-v=-2` => `u=-2, v=0`. Vertex: `(-2, 0)`.\n    This square `Q'` has a diagonal of length 4. The side length is `sqrt(2² + 2²) = sqrt(8) = 2sqrt(2)`. The area of `Q'` is `(2sqrt(2))² = 8`.\n\n5.  **Area Inequality**: There is a known geometric result: If a convex set `C` intersects all four sides of a convex quadrilateral `Q`, then `Area(C) ≥ Area(Q)/2`.\n    In our case, the convex set `K'` intersects the four lines forming the square `Q'`. Therefore, the area of `K'` must be at least half the area of `Q'`.\n    `Area(K') ≥ Area(Q') / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Now we can find the lower bound for the area of the original domain `K`.\n    `Area(K) = (1/2) Area(K') ≥ (1/2) × 4 = 2`.\n\nWe have established a lower bound of 2 for the area, and we have found a specific domain, `S = {(x, y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1}`, which satisfies the conditions and has an area of exactly 2.\n\nTherefore, the minimal area is 2."
