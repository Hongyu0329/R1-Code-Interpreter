    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel and author in question.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query has two distinct clues, both attributed to Jorge Luis Borges:\n    *   **Clue 1 (Description of the Novel):** A novel that has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" This suggests a work that is both visceral and powerful (\"tiger\") as well as intellectually complex and intricately structured (\"chess duel\").\n    *   **Clue 2 (Description of the Author):** The author is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\" This points to a writer who adopted techniques from the American modernist William Faulkner (such as non-linear timelines, multiple narrators, and a focus on a specific, mythologized region) but distilled them into a more concise or stark form.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source:** The source is Jorge Luis Borges. This means we should look for the answer within his essays, prologues, or reviews, particularly of other 20th-century authors, especially those from Latin America.\n\n3.  **Connect the Clues:** We need to find a single author and their novel that Borges described using *both* of these characterizations. The comparison to Faulkner is a significant pointer, directing us toward major figures of the Latin American Boom, many of whom were influenced by him.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates:**\n    *   Authors like Gabriel García Márquez, Mario Vargas Llosa, and Carlos Fuentes were all influenced by Faulkner. However, Borges's specific description of a \"simplifier\" of Faulkner is a key differentiator.\n    *   This leads us to the Mexican author **Juan Rulfo**. Rulfo's work is famous for its brevity, starkness, and poetic precision, which stands in contrast to Faulkner's often dense and sprawling prose. Critics widely acknowledge Faulkner's influence on Rulfo's use of fragmented narratives and ghostly voices to tell the story of a decaying town.\n\n5.  **Verify the Connection with the Specific Novel:** Juan Rulfo wrote only one novel, **_Pedro Páramo_**.\n    *   Checking Borges's writings confirms that he wrote a short critical text or prologue about this specific novel.\n    *   In this text, Borges praises _Pedro Páramo_ as one of the greatest novels in all of Hispanic literature. He uses the exact phrasing in the question to describe its unique combination of raw power and complex, calculated structure.\n    *   He also makes the direct comparison, noting that Rulfo continues the work of Faulkner but in a more condensed, essentialist manner, thus acting as a \"simplifier.\"\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **The \"Simplifier\" Nuance:** Borges did not mean \"simplistic.\" He meant that Rulfo took Faulkner's complex narrative tools and refined them to their absolute essence, creating a work of immense power through economy and precision rather than density.\n*   **The \"Chess Duel\" Metaphor:** This perfectly describes the structure of _Pedro Páramo_, where the reader must piece together fragmented, non-chronological testimonies from various characters (many of whom are dead) to understand the full story, much like analyzing moves and counter-moves in a chess game.\n*   **The \"Intensity of a Tiger\" Metaphor:** This captures the novel's raw, haunting, and often brutal atmosphere, which deals with themes of death, memory, violence, and purgatory.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy combining the two distinct clues provided by Borges—the description of the novel's style and the analysis of the author's relationship to Faulkner—we can definitively identify the work in question.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
