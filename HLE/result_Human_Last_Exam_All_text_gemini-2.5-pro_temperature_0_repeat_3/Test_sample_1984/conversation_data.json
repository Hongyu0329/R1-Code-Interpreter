    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$, where $m$ is the number of stable equilibrium points of the given differential equation:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points.**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change $x'(t)$ is zero. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\n\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\n\nThe quadratic term in the parenthesis is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\n\nThe solutions to this equation are the values of $x$ that make either factor equal to zero:\n*   $x = 0$\n*   $(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x-1 = 0 \\implies x = 1$\n\nSo, the equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at that point.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point x = 0:**\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point x = 1:**\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We need to use another method, such as analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stability for the inconclusive case (x=1).**\nWe analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ to determine the direction of flow (whether $x(t)$ is increasing or decreasing) near $x=1$.\n\n*   **For x slightly less than 1** (e.g., $x=0.9$):\n    The term $-x$ is negative (approx. -1).\n    The term $(x-1)^2$ is positive (e.g., $(0.9-1)^2 = (-0.1)^2 > 0$).\n    So, $f(x) = (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$.\n    This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ moves to the left, away from $x=1$.\n\n*   **For x slightly greater than 1** (e.g., $x=1.1$):\n    The term $-x$ is negative (approx. -1).\n    The term $(x-1)^2$ is positive (e.g., $(1.1-1)^2 = (0.1)^2 > 0$).\n    So, $f(x) = (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$.\n    This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution $x(t)$ moves to the left, towards $x=1$.\n\nAn equilibrium point is considered stable only if trajectories from both sides of the point converge towards it. Since trajectories starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is **unstable**. (This type of point is often called semi-stable, which is a category of unstable points).\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of stable equilibrium points (m).**\nFrom our analysis, we have:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is an unstable equilibrium point.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point.\n$$ m = 1 $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression.**\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Finding all equilibria:** It's crucial to factor the polynomial completely to find all roots.\n*   **Stability Test:** Remember that if $f'(x^*) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. You must use a graphical analysis (phase line) or higher-order derivatives.\n*   **Definition of Stability:** A semi-stable point is not considered stable. For an equilibrium to be stable, nearby solutions must remain close for all future time. For $x=1$, solutions starting just below 1 move away, violating this condition.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\nWith $m=1$, the final expression is $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
