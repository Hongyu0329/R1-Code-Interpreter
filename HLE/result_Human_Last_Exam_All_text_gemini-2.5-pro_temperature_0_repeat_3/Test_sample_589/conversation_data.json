    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nFirst, let's break down the query into its essential components. We are looking for a specific scene in a film with the following attributes:\n1.  **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n3.  **Character:** A teenager.\n4.  **Object:** A pink bike.\n5.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Elimination of Common Misconceptions**\n\nSeveral films with prominent bike scenes come to mind, but they must be carefully checked against all criteria.\n\n*   ***It*** **(2017):** This film features teenagers on bikes who are confronted by a car driven by the bully Henry Bowers. However, the Losers' Club is pedaling *away* from the car to escape it, not *toward* it. Furthermore, none of the main characters' bikes are pink (Beverly Marsh's iconic bike is red). Therefore, *It* is incorrect.\n*   ***Now and Then*** **(1995):** This film features four young girls (pre-teens/early teens) who ride bikes extensively. The character Chrissy does indeed have a pink bike. However, there is no scene in the film where she, or any other character, pedals directly toward an oncoming car. Therefore, *Now and Then* is incorrect.\n*   ***Pee-wee's Big Adventure*** **(1985):** The main character is an adult, not a teenager, and his beloved bike is famously red, not pink. Therefore, *Pee-wee's Big Adventure* is incorrect.\n*   ***Stranger Things***: This popular series features teenagers on bikes. However, it is a television series, not a Hollywood feature film, so it is disqualified by the first criterion.\n\n**Step 3: Focusing on the Specific Action and Visuals**\n\nThe action of \"pedaling directly toward an oncoming car\" is very specific. It's not a chase or a race; it's a direct, head-on confrontation. This, combined with the unusual visual of a pink bike, suggests a highly stylized or surreal scene, possibly from a horror or thriller film where normal events are subverted.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Correct Film and Scene**\n\nConsidering the horror genre and the time period of many popular \"kids on bikes\" films (the 1980s), we can pinpoint the correct movie.\n\n*   **Film:** *A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge* (1985).\n*   **Studio:** New Line Cinema, a major studio often called \"The House that Freddy Built.\"\n*   **Scene Analysis:** In the film, the protagonist, teenager Jesse Walsh, is being psychologically tormented by Freddy Krueger. While driving his family's car, Jesse has a waking nightmare. He sees his girlfriend's younger sister, Angela Webber (a young teenager), in the middle of the road.\n    *   **Character:** Angela Webber is a teenager.\n    *   **Object:** She is riding a distinctly pink bicycle with a white basket.\n    *   **Action:** She is pedaling slowly but deliberately *directly toward* Jesse's oncoming car, creating a surreal and dangerous obstruction. Jesse is forced to swerve violently to avoid hitting her, crashing the car. When he looks back, she has vanished, revealing it was a supernatural event orchestrated by Freddy.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **The action is key:** The character is not fleeing or playing \"chicken\" in a traditional sense. The action is part of a supernatural horror sequence designed to be unsettling.\n*   **The character's age:** The character is a young teenager, fitting the description.\n*   **The studio:** New Line Cinema was a major player, especially in the horror genre, and is now a subsidiary of Warner Bros., confirming its status.\n*   **Specificity of the visual:** The pink bike is a memorable and specific detail that makes the scene stand out and perfectly matches the prompt.\n\nThis scene from *A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge* is the only one that matches all the specific criteria laid out in the question.\n\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"
