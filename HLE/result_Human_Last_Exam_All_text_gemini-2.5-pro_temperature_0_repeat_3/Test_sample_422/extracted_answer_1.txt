The two problems are:
1.  **The Conflation of Justified and Unjustified Beliefs:** The JTB definition forces a justified but false belief to be categorized in the same epistemic state ("Belief") as a completely unjustified belief. This fails to recognize the distinct epistemic value of justification when a belief is not true.
2.  **The Conflation of True and False Beliefs:** The JTB definition forces a true but unjustified belief (e.g., a lucky guess) to be categorized in the same epistemic state ("Belief") as a false belief (whether justified or not). This fails to recognize the distinct epistemic value of truth when a belief is not justified.
