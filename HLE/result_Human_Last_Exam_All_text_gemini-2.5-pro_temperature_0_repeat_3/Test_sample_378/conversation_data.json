    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core subject of the question:** The question is about a specific individual, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, who served as the President of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015.\n2.  **Identify the key claim in the question:** The question claims that at some point, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself by adding the name \"Azikiwe\" to his own. It asks for the year this happened.\n3.  **Verify the subject's full name:** The official and universally recognized name of the former president is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his birth name or his officially used name during his entire public life and presidency.\n4.  **Investigate the name \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with another prominent Nigerian figure, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria (1963–1966) and a key figure in its independence movement. He is often referred to as the \"father of Nigerian Nationalism.\"\n5.  **Search for evidence of a name change or public identification:** A thorough search of credible sources, including official government records, reputable news archives (such as Reuters, BBC, Associated Press), and academic biographies of Goodluck Jonathan, is required.\n6.  **Evaluate the search results:** The search reveals no credible evidence that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly added \"Azikiwe\" to his name or identified himself as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\" There are no records of speeches, official documents, or press releases where he used this name.\n7.  **Formulate a conclusion:** The premise of the question is incorrect. The event described—Goodluck Jonathan publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe—never happened. The question is likely based on misinformation or a confusion between two different Nigerian presidents.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **False Premise:** The question is built on a false premise. It's crucial to recognize when a question assumes an event that did not occur, rather than trying to find an answer that doesn't exist.\n*   **Name Confusion:** The prominence of Nnamdi Azikiwe in Nigerian history can sometimes lead to confusion or the incorrect association of his name with other political figures.\n*   **Source Verification:** It is essential to rely on verified and authoritative sources. Unsubstantiated claims or rumors on social media or less credible websites can create such misconceptions.\n*   **Distinguishing Individuals:** It is important to clearly distinguish between Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe, as they are two separate and distinct historical figures in Nigeria from different eras.\n\nBased on the analysis, there is no year in which this event occurred because it never happened.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. The question is based on a false premise.>>>"
