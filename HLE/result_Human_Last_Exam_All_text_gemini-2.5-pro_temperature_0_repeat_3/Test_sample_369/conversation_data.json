    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n**Step 1: Write out the line and identify elisions.**\nAn elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel or \"-m\" is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or \"h-\". The first word's final syllable is dropped or \"elided\" in pronunciation.\n\nLine: `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\n*   `verum ubi`: The \"-um\" in `verum` elides with the \"u\" in `ubi`. -> `ver' ubi`\n*   `equi atque`: The \"-i\" in `equi` elides with the \"a\" in `atque`. -> `equ' atque`\n*   `atque hominis`: The \"-e\" in `atque` elides with the \"ho-\" in `hominis` (since 'h' is not treated as a consonant for elision). -> `atqu' hominis`\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the feet one by one, determining syllable quantities.**\nA syllable is long (—) if it contains a long vowel or diphthong (long by nature) or if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (long by position). Otherwise, it is short (U).\n\n*   **Foot 1: `verum ubi`**\n    *   `ver-`: The vowel 'e' is short, but it is followed by two consonants: 'r' from `verum` and 'b' from `ubi`. Thus, it is long by position (—).\n    *   `u-`: The 'u' in `ubi` is short (U).\n    *   `bi`: The 'i' in `ubi` is short (U).\n    *   The foot is long-short-short (— U U), which is a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 2: `equi atque`**\n    *   `equ-`: The 'e' from `equi` is short, but it is followed by two consonants: 'qu' from `equi` and 't' from `atque`. It is long by position (—).\n    *   `at-`: The 'a' from `atque` is short, but it is followed by two consonants: 't' and 'qu' (which counts as 'k' + 'w'). It is long by position (—).\n    *   The foot is long-long (— —), which is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 3: `hominis`**\n    *   This foot begins with `hominis`. The standard quantity of this word is `hŏmĭnĭs` (short-short-short). A foot cannot begin with two short syllables. This line is famously difficult, and scholars agree that Lucretius uses a poetic license here, lengthening the first syllable.\n    *   `hō-`: Treated as long by license (—).\n    *   `mi-`: The 'i' is short (U).\n    *   `ni-`: The 'i' is short (U).\n    *   The foot is scanned as long-short-short (— U U), a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 4: `casu`**\n    *   `cā-`: The 'a' is long by nature (—).\n    *   `sū-`: The 'u' (ablative singular of a 4th declension noun) is long by nature (—).\n    *   The foot is long-long (— —), which is a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n*   **Foot 5: `convenit`**\n    *   `cōn-`: The 'o' is short, but it is followed by two consonants: 'n' and 'v'. It is long by position (—).\n    *   `ve-`: The 'e' in the present tense `convenit` is short (U).\n    *   `nit`: The 'i' is short (U).\n    *   The foot is long-short-short (— U U), which is a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n*   **Foot 6: `imago`**\n    *   This foot is formed by the remaining word, `imago`. Its standard scansion is `ĭmāgō` (short-long-long). A final foot cannot begin with a short syllable. This points to a second poetic license in the line. The initial short 'i' is treated as long for the meter.\n    *   `ī-`: Treated as long by license (—).\n    *   `mā-`: The 'a' is long by nature. The final syllable of a hexameter line is always treated as long (syllaba anceps).\n    *   The foot is scanned as long-long (— —), a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\nThe scansion for the entire line is: Dactyl, Spondee, Dactyl, Spondee, Dactyl, Spondee.\n\n<<<D S D S D S>>>"
