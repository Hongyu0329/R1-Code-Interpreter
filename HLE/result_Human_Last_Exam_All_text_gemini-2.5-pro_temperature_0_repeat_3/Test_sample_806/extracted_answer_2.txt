The specific biochemical reaction that initiated the process was the non-covalent binding of the anticonvulsant drug (or its metabolite) to the peptide-binding groove of a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecule on an antigen-presenting cell. This created an altered molecular complex that was subsequently recognized as foreign by the T-cell receptor of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, triggering a massive immune response against the patient's own skin cells.
