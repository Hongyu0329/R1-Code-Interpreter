    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral**\nThe problem asks us to evaluate the definite integral:\n`V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\n\nThis integral is in the form `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`. The antiderivative of this form is `ln|f(x)|`. In our case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\nUsing the antiderivative, we can evaluate the definite integral:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from 0 to 1.\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**Step 3: Define the Function F₃(x)**\nWe are given a sequence of functions:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate F₃(0)**\nWe substitute `x = 0` into the expression for `F₃(x)`:\n*   `sin(0) = 0`\n*   `e⁰ = 1`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate F₃(1)**\nWe substitute `x = 1` into the expression for `F₃(x)`. Note that the argument for the sine function is in radians.\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the Values into the Integral Expression**\nNow we substitute the expressions for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` back into the formula for `V`:\n`V = ln|ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))| - ln|ln(2)|`\n\n**Step 7: Check the Signs and Remove Absolute Values**\nWe need to determine if the arguments of the logarithms are positive.\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.693`, which is positive. So, `|ln(2)| = ln(2)`.\n*   The angle `1` is in radians (`1 rad ≈ 57.3°`). Since `0 < 1 < π/2`, `sin(1)` is positive.\n*   Since `sin(1) > 0`, `e^(sin(1)) > e⁰ = 1`.\n*   Therefore, `1 + e^(sin(1)) > 2`.\n*   This means `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) > ln(2)`. Since `ln(2)` is positive, `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` must also be positive.\n*   So, we can remove the absolute value signs:\n    `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\n**Step 8: Simplify the Expression for V**\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can simplify the expression for `V`:\n`V = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )`\n\n**Step 9: Calculate the Numerical Value of V**\nWe now compute the value using a calculator.\n*   `sin(1) ≈ 0.841471`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.841471 ≈ 2.31977`\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.31977`\n*   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.31977) ≈ 1.2000`\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.69315`\n*   The ratio inside the final logarithm is `1.2000 / 0.69315 ≈ 1.73125`\n*   `V = ln(1.73125) ≈ 0.54885`\n\n**Step 10: Calculate the Final Result**\nThe question asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n*   `10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54885 = 5488.5`\nTo be more precise and avoid rounding errors:\n*   `10000 * V = 10000 * ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) ) ≈ 10000 * 0.54884905 ≈ 5488.4905`\n\nThe closest integer to `5488.4905` is `5488`.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
