    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n    *   This is a secondary alkyl halide.\n    *   The cyclohexane ring is a cyclic system that exists in chair conformations.\n    *   The stereochemistry is specified as (1S, 2R). Let's determine the relative orientation of the bromo and methyl groups. In (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, the two substituents are on opposite sides of the ring, meaning they are in a **trans** relationship.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu).\n    *   This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH).\n    *   This is the conjugate acid of the base, a common choice for E2 reactions to prevent side reactions.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Reaction Type**\n\n*   We have a secondary alkyl halide reacting with a strong, bulky base. These conditions are ideal for an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction.\n*   SN2 reactions are disfavored due to the steric hindrance of the bulky base and the secondary carbon center.\n*   E1/SN1 reactions are disfavored because a strong base is used, which will actively remove a proton rather than wait for a carbocation to form.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\n\n*   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed (a beta-hydrogen) must be **anti-periplanar**.\n*   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this anti-periplanar arrangement means the leaving group and the beta-hydrogen must both be in **axial** positions, oriented in opposite directions (one pointing up, the other down). This is called a **trans-diaxial** arrangement.\n\n**Step 4: Draw and Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\n\nSince the Br and CHâ‚ƒ groups are trans, we can draw two possible chair conformations that are in equilibrium.\n\n*   **Conformation A (Diequatorial):** The bromine atom is in an equatorial position, and the methyl group is also in an equatorial position. Bulky groups prefer the equatorial position to minimize steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions). Therefore, **this is the more stable and major conformation**.\n*   **Conformation B (Diaxial):** The bromine atom is in an axial position, and the methyl group is also in an axial position. This conformation is less stable due to significant 1,3-diaxial interactions.\n\n**Crucial Point:** The E2 reaction can **only** proceed from the conformation where the leaving group (Br) is in an **axial** position. Therefore, the reaction must occur via the less stable **Conformation B**, even though it is present in a lower concentration at equilibrium.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Available Beta-Hydrogens for Elimination**\n\nLet's examine Conformation B, the reactive conformation, where the Bromine is axial.\n\n*   **Leaving Group:** Bromine at C1 is axial. Let's assume it's pointing \"up\".\n*   For elimination, we need a beta-hydrogen that is axial and pointing \"down\". The beta-carbons are C2 and C6.\n\n*   **Beta-Hydrogen at C2:**\n    *   The methyl group at C2 is also axial (and trans to Br, so it points \"down\").\n    *   This means the hydrogen on C2 must be in the **equatorial** position.\n    *   Since the C2-H is equatorial, it is **not** anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n    *   **Therefore, elimination cannot occur by removing the hydrogen from C2.**\n\n*   **Beta-Hydrogen at C6:**\n    *   Carbon C6 has two hydrogens. One is axial, and one is equatorial.\n    *   The axial hydrogen at C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1.\n    *   **Therefore, elimination can and will occur by removing the axial hydrogen from C6.**\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Structure and Name of the Product**\n\n*   The base (tert-butoxide) removes the axial proton from C6.\n*   Simultaneously, a double bond forms between C1 and C6, and the bromine atom leaves.\n*   The methyl group on C2 is unaffected by the elimination and remains on the ring.\n*   The product is a cyclohexene ring where the double bond is between the original C1 and C6 carbons, and a methyl group is attached to the original C2 carbon.\n\nTo name this product according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  Number the ring to give the carbons of the double bond the lowest possible numbers (C1 and C2).\n2.  The methyl group is located on the carbon adjacent to the double bond, which will be C3 in this numbering scheme.\n\nThe resulting product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  Recognize the reaction is E2.\n2.  Understand the anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) requirement for E2 on a cyclohexane ring.\n3.  Correctly identify the starting material as a trans-isomer.\n4.  Realize the reaction must proceed through the less stable diaxial conformation.\n5.  Analyze the beta-hydrogens in the reactive conformation to see which one meets the trans-diaxial requirement.\n6.  Conclude that elimination is regioselective, dictated by stereochemistry, leading to only one product.\n7.  Correctly name the final alkene product.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
