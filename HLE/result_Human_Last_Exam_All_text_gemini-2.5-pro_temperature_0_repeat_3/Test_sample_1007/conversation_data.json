    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends with the same leg position as it started. The standard starting and ending position for these steps is the fifth position.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting position.**\nFor this analysis, let's assume the starting position for all steps is the fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each answer choice.**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a jump with six movements (three beats) of the legs in the air. The sequence is: open, cross behind, open, cross front, open, cross behind.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands back in the fifth position, but because there is an odd number of beats (three), the feet are switched. The left foot will now be in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** \"Échappé\" means to escape, so the dancer jumps from fifth to second position (legs open). \"Battu\" means beaten, so the legs beat together as they close. \"Changé\" means changed.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer jumps from fifth, opens to second, and then closes back to fifth, but the word \"changé\" explicitly indicates that the feet must change. The left foot will land in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** \"Assemblé\" means to assemble. The dancer brushes one leg out (to the front, side, or back), pushes off the supporting leg to jump, and then \"assembles\" both legs together in the air to land on both feet simultaneously in the fifth position.\n    *   **Careful Point:** There are many types of assemblé. Some change the feet (*assemblé dessus* or *dessous*), but others do not. For example, in an *assemblé derrière*, the front foot brushes to the back and then closes in the back, meaning the same foot (the original back foot) remains in front. In an *assemblé en avant*, the front foot brushes forward and closes in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** It is possible and common for an assemblé to end in the exact same fifth position it started from (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Conclusion:** This step *can* have the same starting and ending leg position.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** \"Glissade\" means to glide. \"Derrière\" means behind. The dancer glides the back foot (left foot) out to the side, transfers weight, and then closes the front foot (right foot) *behind* the new supporting foot.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The original front foot (right) is now in the back. The dancer is in the fifth position with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (right foot front).\n    *   **Execution:** This is a complex, decorative jump. It resembles a *pas de chat*, but each leg performs a *rond de jambe en l'air* (a circle in the air) during the jump. It is a traveling step.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Due to the nature of the movement and the double *rond de jambe*, the step typically finishes in the fifth position with the feet changed. The left foot will be in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n**Step 3: Final Comparison and Answer.**\nComparing all the options, Entrechat six, Échappé battu changé, Glissade derrière, and Gargouillade all inherently involve a change of the feet from the starting fifth position to the ending fifth position. Assemblé is the only step on the list that has common variations where the dancer starts and ends in the exact same fifth position (e.g., right foot front at the start and right foot front at the end).\n\n<<<C>>>"
