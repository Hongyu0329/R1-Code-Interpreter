    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian politician and historian.\n    *   **Action:** He \"frequently accused the Western culture of his time.\"\n    *   **Specific Denunciation:** He called \"X-Y\" a \"stagnant swamp.\"\n    *   **Goal:** Identify \"X-Y.\"\n\n2.  **Initial Research and Contextualization:**\n    *   Pavel Milyukov was a leader of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) and a key figure in the Russian Provisional Government of 1917. While he was a \"Westernizer\" in his political ideals (advocating for a constitutional monarchy like Britain's), he was also a cultural conservative in some respects.\n    *   The phrase \"stagnant swamp\" is a very strong and specific quote. A search for \"Pavel Milyukov\" and \"stagnant swamp\" might initially point to his famous \"Stupidity or Treason?\" speech in the Duma in 1916. However, in that speech, he was describing the political situation and the incompetence of the Tsar's government, not a cultural phenomenon from the West. This means we must look for a different context.\n\n3.  **Focusing on Cultural Criticism:**\n    *   The question specifies a critique of \"Western culture.\" Milyukov was not only a politician but also a historian and an art critic. His views on art are a likely place to find such a strong denunciation.\n    *   In the early 20th century, Russia experienced a vibrant avant-garde art movement, which was heavily influenced by contemporary Western European trends like French Fauvism and Cubism.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Specific Event and Target:**\n    *   In 1912, a group of radical Russian artists formed an exhibition society called the **\"Jack of Diamonds\"** (in Russian, \"Бубновый валет\"). Key members included Mikhail Larionov, Natalia Goncharova, and Aristarkh Lentulov. Their work was a direct challenge to the academic realism that had dominated Russian art.\n    *   Pavel Milyukov, in his capacity as a member of the Duma and a public intellectual, was a fierce opponent of this new art. He saw it as a sign of cultural decay and barbarism.\n    *   In a speech in the Duma, while discussing the budget for the Ministry of Education, Milyukov launched a famous attack on the \"Jack of Diamonds\" exhibition. It was in this context that he used the phrase \"stagnant swamp\" to describe the new art movement, which he believed was a corrupting influence from the West.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The \"X-Y\" that Milyukov denounced as a \"stagnant swamp\" was the **Jack of Diamonds** art group. This group represented the Russian avant-garde movement, which embraced modernist styles originating in Western Europe. Milyukov's criticism was part of a broader conservative reaction against what he perceived as the decline of Western culture.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing Contexts:** It is crucial to distinguish Milyukov's political speeches from his cultural criticism. The \"stagnant swamp\" quote is famously associated with him, but it was used in at least two different major contexts. The question's focus on \"Western culture\" is the key to identifying the correct one.\n*   **Milyukov's Complex Views:** Milyukov was not anti-Western in a political sense; he was a liberal who admired Western political institutions. His criticism was aimed at what he saw as the decadent and chaotic trends in modern Western *culture*, particularly in the visual arts.\n*   **\"X-Y\" as a Placeholder:** The \"X-Y\" format indicates a proper noun, likely the name of a group or movement.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify X-Y.\n\n<<<Jack of Diamonds>>>"
