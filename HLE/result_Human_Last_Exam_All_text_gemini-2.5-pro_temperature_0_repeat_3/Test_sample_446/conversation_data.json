    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The question asks to identify which of the given peptides is known or highly likely to bind to an integrin receptor.\n\n2.  **Recognize the key binding motif:** Integrins are a family of cell surface receptors that mediate cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion. A large number of integrins recognize a specific tripeptide sequence: Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid, abbreviated as RGD. This sequence is found in various extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins like fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin.\n\n3.  **Examine the answer choices:** All five peptide options start with the RGD sequence:\n    A. RGDMAA\n    B. RGDSPSS\n    C. RGDLTTP\n    D. RGDQVSK\n    E. RGDARGG\n    This indicates that the presence of the RGD motif alone is not the deciding factor. The amino acids that flank the RGD sequence are also critical for determining the binding affinity and specificity for different types of integrin receptors.\n\n4.  **Analyze the flanking residues:** The conformation of the RGD loop and the identity of the amino acids immediately following the aspartic acid (D) residue are known to be crucial for binding. We need to look for a sequence that is either a known natural ligand sequence or a well-characterized synthetic one.\n\n5.  **Recall or research known RGD sequences:**\n    *   The cell attachment site in **fibronectin**, one of the most studied ECM proteins, contains the sequence **RGDS** (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid-Serine). Synthetic peptides containing this sequence, such as GRGDSP, are widely used in cell biology research to study integrin-mediated cell adhesion and to compete with fibronectin binding.\n    *   Other ECM proteins have different residues following the RGD motif. For example, vitronectin contains RGDV, and laminin contains RGDN.\n\n6.  **Evaluate each option based on this knowledge:**\n    *   A. RGDMAA: The RGD**M** sequence is not a classic, well-known motif from a major ECM protein.\n    *   B. **RGDSPSS**: This peptide contains the **RGDS** sequence, which is the canonical binding motif from fibronectin. The peptide RGDSP is a very well-documented binder of integrins, particularly the fibronectin receptor α5β1 and also αvβ3. The presence of this core sequence makes RGDSPSS a peptide that has certainly been found to bind, or is at the very least, extremely likely to bind integrins in an in vitro assay.\n    *   C. RGDLTTP: The RGD**L** sequence is less common in major natural ligands.\n    *   D. RGDQVSK: The RGD**Q** sequence is not a characteristic motif of the most common integrin ligands.\n    *   E. RGDARGG: The RGD**A** sequence is also not the primary sequence found in major ECM proteins like fibronectin or vitronectin.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The peptide in choice B, RGDSPSS, contains the well-established RGDSP motif derived from fibronectin. This sequence is known to be a potent ligand for several integrin receptors. Therefore, it is the most likely candidate among the given options to bind an integrin receptor.\n\n<<<B>>>"
