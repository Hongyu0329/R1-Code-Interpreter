    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question and Interpreting the Hamiltonian\n\nThe question asks for the partition function Z for a system in the grand canonical ensemble. The standard definition of the grand canonical partition function is:\n$Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N})}]$\nwhere $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is the system's Hamiltonian (describing kinetic and potential energies), $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator, and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\nThe problem states that the \"Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. There are two common interpretations:\n\n1.  The system Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H}_{sys} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. In this case, the operator in the exponent of the partition function would be $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N} = (-\\mu \\hat{N}) - \\mu \\hat{N} = -2\\mu \\hat{N}$. The partition function would then be $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu \\hat{N})}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{2\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}}]$.\n2.  The question is defining the **grand canonical Hamiltonian** itself, i.e., the full operator in the exponent, as $\\hat{H}_{GC} = -\\mu \\hat{N}$. This implies that the usual system Hamiltonian part ($\\hat{H}_{sys}$) is zero. In this case, the partition function is $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}_{GC}}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(-\\mu \\hat{N})}] = \\text{Tr}[e^{\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}}]$.\n\nInterpretation 2 is more common in textbook problems as it simplifies the system to its bare statistical properties (an ideal gas with zero kinetic energy). We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\nSo, our goal is to calculate $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}}]$ using the path integral formalism.\n\n### Step 2: Relating the Trace to a Standard Partition Function\n\nThe expression $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}}]$ can be mapped to a standard grand canonical partition function. A standard partition function has the form $Z_{std} = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu_{eff} \\hat{N})}]$.\nTo make our expression match this form, we can identify:\n*   The system Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{sys} = 0$.\n*   The effective chemical potential $\\mu_{eff}$ must satisfy $-\\beta(0 - \\mu_{eff} \\hat{N}) = \\beta\\mu \\hat{N}$, which implies $\\mu_{eff} = \\mu$.\n\nSo, we are calculating the standard grand canonical partition function for a system of non-interacting particles with zero energy ($\\epsilon_k=0$ for all states $k$) and chemical potential $\\mu$.\n\n### Step 3: Formulating the Path Integral\n\nThe path integral expression for the grand canonical partition function $Z = \\text{Tr}[e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})}]$ is given by:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\nwhere $\\psi$ and $\\psi^*$ are complex (for bosons) or Grassmann (for fermions) fields, and $S$ is the Euclidean action. The action is given by:\n$S[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L} = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, [\\psi^*(x, \\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi(x, \\tau) + H(\\psi^*, \\psi) - \\mu \\psi^*(x, \\tau) \\psi(x, \\tau)]$\n\nFor our specific problem, the Hamiltonian density $H(\\psi^*, \\psi)$ is zero. Thus, the action simplifies to:\n$S[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, [\\psi^*(x, \\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi(x, \\tau) - \\mu \\psi^*(x, \\tau) \\psi(x, \\tau)]$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$S[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\psi^*(x, \\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi(x, \\tau)$\n\n### Step 4: Evaluating the Path Integral\n\nThe path integral with this quadratic action is a Gaussian integral. The result of such an integral is the determinant of the operator in the action.\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-\\int \\psi^* (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi} = \\det^{\\eta}(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$\nThe exponent $\\eta$ depends on the statistics of the particles:\n*   For **Bosons** (complex fields), $\\eta = -1$.\n*   For **Fermions** (Grassmann fields), $\\eta = +1$.\n\nSo, $Z = \\det^{\\mp 1}(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$, where the top sign is for bosons and the bottom sign for fermions.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Determinant\n\nThe determinant is the product of the eigenvalues of the operator $(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$ over all possible states. The states are characterized by quantum numbers like momentum $k$ and by the imaginary time frequency (Matsubara frequency, $\\omega_n$). The operator is diagonal in the momentum basis.\n$Z = \\prod_k Z_k$\nwhere $Z_k = \\det^{\\mp 1}(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$ for a single state $k$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $\\partial_\\tau$ are $-i\\omega_n$, where the Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n$ depend on the boundary conditions in imaginary time $\\tau$:\n*   For Bosons (periodic BC): $\\omega_n = \\frac{2n\\pi}{\\beta}$\n*   For Fermions (anti-periodic BC): $\\omega_n = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{\\beta}$\n\nThe eigenvalues of the operator $(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)$ are therefore $(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$. The determinant is the product of these eigenvalues. A rigorous calculation of this (infinite) product requires regularization. A standard method is to calculate the derivative of $\\ln Z$ with respect to $\\mu$ and then integrate.\n\n$\\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\ln Z = \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\left[ \\mp \\sum_k \\text{Tr} \\ln(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\right] = \\pm \\sum_k \\text{Tr}[(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)^{-1}]$\nThe trace involves a sum over Matsubara frequencies, which can be performed using contour integration techniques. The result of this standard calculation is:\n$\\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\ln Z = \\sum_k \\beta n_{F/B}(-\\mu)$\nwhere $n_F(x) = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta x}+1}$ and $n_B(x) = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta x}-1}$.\nSo, $\\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\ln Z = \\sum_k \\frac{\\beta}{e^{-\\beta\\mu} \\pm 1}$.\n\nIntegrating with respect to $\\mu$ gives:\n$\\ln Z = \\sum_k \\left[ \\pm \\ln(1 \\pm e^{\\beta\\mu}) \\right] + C$\nwhere the top sign is for fermions and the bottom for bosons. The integration constant can be shown to be zero by considering the limit $\\mu \\to -\\infty$ (zero particles, $Z=1$, $\\ln Z = 0$).\n\nThus, for a system with $M$ identical single-particle states:\n*   **Fermions:** $\\ln Z_F = M \\ln(1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}) \\implies Z_F = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^M$\n*   **Bosons:** $\\ln Z_B = -M \\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}) \\implies Z_B = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$\n\nThis can be written as a single expression.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe partition function Z for the system is given by the product over all single-particle states (indexed by $k$). For each state, the contribution depends on whether the particles are fermions or bosons.\n\nFor a system with $M$ degenerate single-particle states, the partition function is:\n*   For Fermions: $Z_F = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^M$\n*   For Bosons: $Z_B = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$\n\nThis can be expressed generally as:\n$Z = \\prod_k (1 \\pm e^{\\beta\\mu})^{\\pm 1}$\nwhere the product is over all single-particle states $k$. The upper signs $(+, +)$ apply to fermions, and the lower signs $(-, -)$ apply to bosons. For the bosonic case, convergence requires $\\mu < 0$.\n\n<<<For a system with M degenerate single-particle states, the partition function is $Z = (1 + e^{\\beta\\mu})^M$ for fermions and $Z = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$ for bosons.>>>"
