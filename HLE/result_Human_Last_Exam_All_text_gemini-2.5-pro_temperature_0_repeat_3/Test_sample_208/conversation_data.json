    "This is a classic mathematical problem in the field of circle packing. To find the radius of the large circle, we need to determine the most efficient (tightest) way to pack the fourteen smaller circles and then calculate the radius based on that specific arrangement.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and the Optimal Arrangement**\nThe problem asks for the radius (R) of the smallest possible circle that can contain fourteen smaller circles, each with a radius (r) of 1. This is a known packing problem, and the optimal arrangement for n=14 has been proven. The arrangement is not a simple symmetrical pattern but a specific configuration consisting of:\n*   One central circle.\n*   An inner ring of four circles.\n*   An outer ring of nine circles.\nThis is often referred to as the 1-4-9 configuration.\n\n**Step 2: Set up a Coordinate System**\nTo analyze the geometry, we can place the center of the large circle at the origin (0,0). The central small circle is also centered at (0,0). The radius of the large circle, R, will be the distance from the origin to the center of the outermost small circle, plus the radius of that small circle (r=1).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Geometry of the Packing**\nThe key to solving this is to understand the tangencies between the circles, as these constraints define the entire structure.\n*   **Central and Inner Circles:** The four circles in the inner ring are all tangent to the central circle. Therefore, the distance from the origin to the center of any of these four inner circles is `r + r = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   **Critical Tangencies:** The overall radius R is determined by the circle that is furthest from the center. In the optimal arrangement for n=14, the tightest fit is dictated by a specific interaction between the inner and outer rings. The critical point is defined by an outer circle that is simultaneously tangent to an inner circle and another outer circle.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Position of the Outermost Circle's Center**\nLet's perform the calculation to find the coordinates of the center of the most distant circle.\n1.  Let the center of one of the inner-ring circles, C_inner, be placed at (2, 0).\n2.  By the nature of the n=14 packing, there is an outer-ring circle, C_outer1, which is tangent to C_inner. Furthermore, C_outer1 is also tangent to an adjacent outer-ring circle, C_outer2.\n3.  Due to the symmetry of this local arrangement, we can place the centers of C_outer1 and C_outer2 at `(x, y)` and `(x, -y)` respectively.\n4.  The distance between the centers of two tangent circles is `2r = 2`.\n    *   The distance between C_outer1 and C_outer2 is 2: `sqrt((x-x)² + (y - (-y))²) = 2` -> `sqrt((2y)²) = 2` -> `2y = 2`, which gives `y = 1`.\n    *   The distance between C_inner and C_outer1 is 2: `sqrt((x-2)² + (y-0)²) = 2`.\n5.  Now we substitute `y=1` into the second equation: `(x-2)² + 1² = 2²` -> `(x-2)² + 1 = 4`.\n6.  Solving for `x`: `(x-2)² = 3` -> `x-2 = sqrt(3)` -> `x = 2 + sqrt(3)`.\n7.  So, the center of this critical outer circle is at `(2 + sqrt(3), 1)`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Radius of the Large Circle (R)**\nThe radius R is the distance from the origin (0,0) to the center of this outermost circle, plus its own radius (r=1).\n1.  First, find the distance (d) of the center `(2 + sqrt(3), 1)` from the origin:\n    `d = sqrt( (2 + sqrt(3))² + 1² )`\n    `d = sqrt( (4 + 4*sqrt(3) + 3) + 1 )`\n    `d = sqrt( 8 + 4*sqrt(3) )`\n2.  This expression can be simplified. We can recognize that `(sqrt(6) + sqrt(2))² = (sqrt(6))² + 2*sqrt(6)*sqrt(2) + (sqrt(2))² = 6 + 2*sqrt(12) + 2 = 8 + 2*(2*sqrt(3)) = 8 + 4*sqrt(3)`.\n    Therefore, `d = sqrt(6) + sqrt(2)`.\n3.  The radius R of the large circle is this distance `d` plus the radius `r=1`:\n    `R = d + r = (sqrt(6) + sqrt(2)) + 1`\n4.  Now, we calculate the numerical value:\n    `sqrt(6) ≈ 2.44949`\n    `sqrt(2) ≈ 1.41421`\n    `R ≈ 2.44949 + 1.41421 + 1 = 4.86370`\n5.  Rounding to 4 significant digits, we get `4.864`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Optimal Configuration:** It is crucial to know or find the correct optimal packing arrangement for n=14, which is the 1-4-9 structure. Assuming a simpler, more symmetric layout would lead to an incorrect, larger radius.\n*   **Identifying Constraints:** The solution depends on identifying the correct set of tangencies that define the packing. The key is the outer circle being tangent to both an inner circle and another outer circle.\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** The simplification of `sqrt(8 + 4*sqrt(3))` to `sqrt(6) + sqrt(2)` is a key step that makes the result exact and easier to calculate.\n*   **Final Calculation:** The radius of the large circle is the distance to the *center* of the outermost small circle plus the *radius* of that small circle.\n*   **Significant Digits:** The final answer must be rounded correctly to the specified number of significant digits (4).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe radius of the large circle is `R = 1 + sqrt(2) + sqrt(6)`.\nNumerically, this is approximately `1 + 1.4142 + 2.4495 = 4.8637`.\nRounding to 4 significant digits, the radius is 4.864.\n\n<<<4.864>>>"
