The proposed design strategy, while following standard principles, is fundamentally flawed because a simple single-benzene-ring core (like in 4-alkylbenzonitriles) lacks the necessary molecular anisotropy to form a stable liquid crystal phase at or near room temperature. The analogy to the two-ring 5CB molecule is misleading, as removing a ring eliminates the liquid crystalline behavior. Consequently, the proposed general structure CnH2n+1-Ph-CN will not achieve the design goal.
