    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. It is a conjugated diene, which is a system of 4 π-electrons.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. It is a substituted alkene, which is a system of 2 π-electrons.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and an alkene (dienophile) is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction that forms a six-membered ring in a single, concerted step.\n\n**2. Analyze Reactant Suitability**\n*   **Diene:** 1,3-butadiene is a classic diene for this reaction. It can readily adopt the required *s-cis* conformation (where both double bonds are on the same side of the central single bond) to participate in the cyclic transition state.\n*   **Dienophile:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is an excellent dienophile. Diels-Alder reactions are generally favored when the dienophile has electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs). Both chlorine (Cl) and fluorine (F) are strongly electronegative atoms, making them powerful EWGs. This makes the dienophile \"electron-poor\" and highly reactive towards the \"electron-rich\" diene.\n\n**3. Predict the Basic Product Structure**\n*   The reaction will form a six-membered ring.\n*   The four carbon atoms of 1,3-butadiene and the two carbon atoms of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene will make up this ring.\n*   During the reaction, the two π-bonds of the diene and the one π-bond of the dienophile are broken, and two new C-C single bonds (σ-bonds) and one new C=C double bond (π-bond) are formed.\n*   The new double bond in the product will be between the central carbons (C2 and C3) of the original butadiene molecule.\n*   The product will be a substituted cyclohexene. The substituents from the dienophile (two Cl atoms and two F atoms) will be on adjacent carbons in the newly formed ring.\n\n**4. Determine the Regiochemistry (Which Isomer is Formed?)**\n*   This is the most crucial step in determining the exact product.\n*   The diene, 1,3-butadiene, is symmetrical.\n*   The dienophile, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene, is unsymmetrical because the two carbons of the double bond have different substituents (one is bonded to two Cl atoms, the other to two F atoms).\n*   Because the dienophile is unsymmetrical, two different products (regioisomers) are theoretically possible.\n*   The outcome is predicted by **Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory**. The reaction is controlled by the interaction between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the diene and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the dienophile.\n*   The new bonds form between the atoms with the largest orbital coefficients that are closest in space.\n*   **HOMO of Butadiene:** The terminal carbons (C1 and C4) have orbital coefficients of equal magnitude.\n*   **LUMO of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene:** We need to know which carbon atom, the CCl₂ or the CF₂, has the larger LUMO coefficient.\n    *   Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, so its inductive electron-withdrawing effect is stronger.\n    *   However, chlorine is a better π-donor than fluorine (its 3p orbitals overlap more effectively with carbon's 2p orbitals than fluorine's 2p orbitals do).\n    *   In cases like this, the π-donation effect is often dominant in determining the polarization of the π orbitals. The better π-donation from the two chlorine atoms polarizes the LUMO (the π* anti-bonding orbital) such that the **LUMO has a larger coefficient on the CCl₂ carbon**.\n*   **Conclusion on Regioselectivity:** The reaction will proceed in a way that matches the largest coefficient on the dienophile's LUMO (the CCl₂ carbon) with one of the terminal carbons of the diene's HOMO. Therefore, a new bond will form between a terminal carbon of butadiene and the CCl₂ carbon. The other new bond will form between the other terminal carbon of butadiene and the CF₂ carbon.\n\n**5. Draw and Name the Final Product**\n*   Based on the regioselectivity determined above, the CCl₂ group and the CF₂ group will be adjacent in the final product.\n*   Let's draw the product and apply IUPAC naming rules:\n    1.  The parent structure is a cyclohexene.\n    2.  The double bond is the principal functional group and its carbons are numbered C1 and C2.\n    3.  We number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. Numbering in either direction around the ring gives the locants 4 and 5 for the substituted carbons.\n    4.  When numbering is tied, we assign the lower number based on alphabetical order of the substituents. \"Dichloro\" comes before \"difluoro\".\n    5.  Therefore, the CCl₂ group is assigned to position 4, and the CF₂ group is assigned to position 5.\n\nThe final product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Reaction Type:** Correctly identifying the reaction as a Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n*   **Regiochemistry:** Recognizing that the unsymmetrical dienophile leads to a question of regioselectivity.\n*   **FMO Theory:** Applying FMO theory is key. The most difficult point is correctly determining which carbon of the dienophile has the larger LUMO coefficient, which depends on the balance of inductive and resonance effects of the halogen substituents.\n*   **IUPAC Nomenclature:** Applying the correct rules to name the final product, including prioritizing the double bond and then using alphabetical order for substituents when locants are tied.\n\nThe product of the reaction is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
