    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Starting Molecule**\nThe starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means that in the 6-carbon glucose molecule, the carbon atoms at position 1 (the aldehyde carbon) and position 4 are the heavy isotope ¹³C. The other four carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) are the standard ¹²C.\n\n```\n      ¹³CHO  (C1)\n      |\nH - C - OH (C2)\n      |\nHO- C - H  (C3)\n      |\nH - ¹³C - OH (C4)\n      |\nH - C - OH (C5)\n      |\n      CH2OH (C6)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Metabolic Pathway in Question**\nThe question specifies that the glucose molecule goes through **glycolysis**. Glycolysis is a sequence of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions that convert one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Reactions of Glycolysis for CO₂ Production**\nWe need to examine the overall chemical transformation that occurs during glycolysis. The net reaction for glycolysis is:\n\nGlucose (C₆H₁₂O₆) + 2 NAD⁺ + 2 ADP + 2 Pᵢ → 2 Pyruvate (C₃H₃O₃⁻) + 2 NADH + 2 H⁺ + 2 ATP + 2 H₂O\n\n**Careful Point 1: Carbon Conservation in Glycolysis**\nLet's look at the carbon atoms. The starting molecule, glucose, has 6 carbon atoms. The final products of the pathway are two molecules of pyruvate, each of which has 3 carbon atoms.\nTotal carbons in = 1 molecule × 6 carbons/molecule = 6 carbons\nTotal carbons out = 2 molecules × 3 carbons/molecule = 6 carbons\nThis shows that all six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are accounted for in the two pyruvate molecules. There is no net loss of carbon atoms during the process of glycolysis.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Absence of Decarboxylation Steps**\nA decarboxylation reaction is a chemical reaction that removes a carboxyl group (-COOH) and releases carbon dioxide (CO₂). We must check if any of the 10 steps of glycolysis is a decarboxylation reaction.\n1.  Hexokinase/Glucokinase\n2.  Phosphoglucose isomerase\n3.  Phosphofructokinase-1\n4.  Aldolase\n5.  Triose phosphate isomerase\n6.  Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase\n7.  Phosphoglycerate kinase\n8.  Phosphoglycerate mutase\n9.  Enolase\n10. Pyruvate kinase\n\nNone of these ten reactions involves the removal of a carbon atom as CO₂. Therefore, glycolysis itself does not produce any CO₂.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Distinguishing Glycolysis from Subsequent Pathways**\nIt is crucial to distinguish glycolysis from other related metabolic pathways where the products of glycolysis (pyruvate) are further metabolized.\n*   **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction):** Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is converted to acetyl-CoA. This reaction, catalyzed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, *does* release CO₂ from the C1 carbon of pyruvate. If this step were included, labeled CO₂ would be produced.\n*   **Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle):** Acetyl-CoA enters this cycle, and its remaining two carbons are released as CO₂.\n*   **Alcoholic Fermentation:** In some organisms like yeast, under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is converted to ethanol and CO₂. This pathway also releases CO₂.\n\nHowever, the question is strictly limited to the process of **glycolysis**, which ends with the production of pyruvate.\n\n**Conclusion**\nSince the process of glycolysis converts a 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules without any loss of carbon atoms, no CO₂ is produced during this pathway. Consequently, regardless of which carbons are labeled in the initial glucose molecule, the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules released *during glycolysis* is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
