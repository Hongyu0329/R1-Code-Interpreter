    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula\nThe BCH formula provides the solution Z to the equation $e^Z = e^X e^Y$ for non-commuting variables X and Y. The solution Z is given as a series of nested commutators of X and Y:\n$Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\nwhere $Z_n(X, Y)$ is a homogeneous Lie polynomial of degree n. A Lie polynomial is a linear combination of nested commutators. The \"order\" of a term refers to its degree n.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Nature of the Question\nThe question asks for the \"number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\". This means we need to determine how many linearly independent Lie polynomials of degree 10 appear with a non-zero coefficient in the term $Z_{10}(X, Y)$. This is equivalent to finding the dimension of the vector space spanned by the terms in $Z_{10}$.\n\nIt is a known property of the BCH series that its terms are \"generic\" in the sense that they span the entire subspace of the free Lie algebra that has the correct symmetry properties. Therefore, our task is to identify the symmetry of $Z_{10}$ and then calculate the dimension of the corresponding subspace.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Symmetry of the Order 10 Term\nThe BCH series $Z(X,Y)$ has a fundamental symmetry property:\n$Z(Y, X) = -Z(-X, -Y)$\nLet's analyze the implication for the homogeneous component of degree n, $Z_n$. Since $Z_n$ is homogeneous of degree n, we have $Z_n(-X, -Y) = (-1)^n Z_n(X, Y)$.\nSubstituting this into the symmetry property gives:\n$Z_n(Y, X) = -[(-1)^n Z_n(X, Y)] = (-1)^{n+1} Z_n(X, Y)$\n\nFor the order n=10 term, we have:\n$Z_{10}(Y, X) = (-1)^{10+1} Z_{10}(X, Y) = -Z_{10}(X, Y)$\nThis means that $Z_{10}$ is an **anti-symmetric** polynomial under the exchange of X and Y. It must lie in the anti-symmetric subspace of the space of all Lie polynomials of degree 10.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Dimension of the Total Space of Lie Polynomials of Degree 10\nThe space of all Lie polynomials of degree n generated by k variables is the n-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on k generators, denoted $L_n$. Its dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula:\n$d_n(k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the Möbius function.\n\nIn our case, we have k=2 generators (X and Y) and we are interested in the degree n=10.\nThe divisors of 10 are d = 1, 2, 5, 10.\nThe values of the Möbius function are: $\\mu(1)=1$, $\\mu(2)=-1$, $\\mu(5)=-1$, $\\mu(10)=\\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = \\mu(2)\\mu(5) = 1$.\n\nPlugging these values into Witt's formula:\n$d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} [\\mu(1)2^{10/1} + \\mu(2)2^{10/2} + \\mu(5)2^{10/5} + \\mu(10)2^{10/10}]$\n$d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} [1 \\cdot 2^{10} - 1 \\cdot 2^5 - 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 1 \\cdot 2^1]$\n$d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]$\n$d_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} [990] = 99$\n\nSo, the total dimension of the space of Lie polynomials of degree 10, $L_{10}$, is 99.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Dimension of the Anti-Symmetric Subspace\nThe space $L_{10}$ can be decomposed into a direct sum of the symmetric subspace ($L_{10}^+$) and the anti-symmetric subspace ($L_{10}^-$):\n$L_{10} = L_{10}^+ \\oplus L_{10}^-$\n$\\dim(L_{10}) = \\dim(L_{10}^+) + \\dim(L_{10}^-) = 99$\n\nTo find the individual dimensions, we can use character theory. Let $\\sigma$ be the linear operator that swaps X and Y. The trace of this operator on $L_{10}$ is given by:\n$\\text{Tr}_{L_{10}}(\\sigma) = \\dim(L_{10}^+) - \\dim(L_{10}^-)$\n\nThe character formula for a representation on a free Lie algebra is:\n$\\chi_{L_n}(g) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) (\\text{Tr}(g^d))^{n/d}$\nHere, $g=\\sigma$ and $n=10$. The matrix for $\\sigma$ acting on the space spanned by {X, Y} is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nWe need the traces of powers of $\\sigma$:\n$\\text{Tr}(\\sigma) = 0$\n$\\sigma^2 = I$ (the identity matrix), so $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma^2) = 2$.\nIn general, $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma^k) = 0$ if k is odd, and $\\text{Tr}(\\sigma^k) = 2$ if k is even.\n\nNow we apply the character formula for $n=10$:\n$\\text{Tr}_{L_{10}}(\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{10} [\\mu(1)(\\text{Tr}(\\sigma^1))^{10} + \\mu(2)(\\text{Tr}(\\sigma^2))^5 + \\mu(5)(\\text{Tr}(\\sigma^5))^2 + \\mu(10)(\\text{Tr}(\\sigma^{10}))^1]$\n$\\text{Tr}_{L_{10}}(\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{10} [1 \\cdot (0)^{10} - 1 \\cdot (2)^5 - 1 \\cdot (0)^2 + 1 \\cdot (2)^1]$\n$\\text{Tr}_{L_{10}}(\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{10} [0 - 32 - 0 + 2] = \\frac{-30}{10} = -3$\n\nSo we have a system of two linear equations:\n1) $\\dim(L_{10}^+) + \\dim(L_{10}^-) = 99$\n2) $\\dim(L_{10}^+) - \\dim(L_{10}^-) = -3$\n\nSubtracting equation (2) from equation (1):\n$2 \\cdot \\dim(L_{10}^-) = 99 - (-3) = 102$\n$\\dim(L_{10}^-) = \\frac{102}{2} = 51$\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\nThe terms of order 10 in the BCH expansion, $Z_{10}$, lie in the anti-symmetric subspace $L_{10}^-$. The number of non-zero coefficients corresponds to the dimension of the space spanned by these terms. As the BCH series is known to be generic, it spans the entire subspace with the correct symmetry. Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients is equal to the dimension of the anti-symmetric subspace $L_{10}^-$.\n\nThe dimension of this subspace is 51."
