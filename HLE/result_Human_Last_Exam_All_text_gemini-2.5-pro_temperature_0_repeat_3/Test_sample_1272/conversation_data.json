    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical figure and context.**\nThe question is about the Ming Dynasty General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and a \"major defeat\" he suffered in Vietnam. Mu Sheng was a key figure in the Ming Dynasty's occupation of Vietnam (known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination, 1407-1427) and the subsequent war against the Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Mu Sheng's military campaigns in Vietnam to find his \"first major defeat\".**\n*   **Initial Invasion (1406-1407):** Mu Sheng was part of the successful Ming invasion that overthrew the Hồ Dynasty. He did not suffer any major defeats during this period.\n*   **Lam Sơn Uprising (1418-1427):** This was a long and grueling war for the Ming forces. While they faced numerous setbacks and skirmishes, the most significant defeats for the Ming command occurred towards the end of the war.\n*   **The Final Campaign of 1427:** The Ming Dynasty, in a final attempt to crush the Lam Sơn rebellion, sent a massive two-pronged relief expedition.\n    1.  One army, led by General Liu Sheng (柳升), advanced from Guangxi.\n    2.  The second army, led by **General Mu Sheng**, advanced from Yunnan.\n*   This 1427 campaign was Mu Sheng's most critical mission in the war, and its failure represented his most significant and decisive defeat. While Liu Sheng's army was completely annihilated at the Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang (in modern Lạng Sơn and Bắc Giang provinces), Mu Sheng's army also met with disaster.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the specific battle and location of Mu Sheng's defeat.**\n*   After learning of Liu Sheng's catastrophic defeat, Mu Sheng's army, which was advancing down the Clear River (Sông Lô), lost its morale.\n*   The Vietnamese forces, under the command of generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, had prepared ambushes for Mu Sheng's army.\n*   Mu Sheng's forces were attacked and defeated at the pass of **Lãnh Câu (冷溝)** and at **Đan Xá (丹舍)**.\n*   Faced with these defeats and the news of the other Ming army's destruction, Mu Sheng was unable to advance further and was forced to conduct a hasty retreat back to Yunnan, suffering further losses along the way. This failure to complete his objective and the forced retreat constituted his first truly major defeat as the commander of a large-scale offensive.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the modern-day province corresponding to the battle location.**\n*   Historical records and maps place the battle sites of Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá along the Clear River (Sông Lô) valley.\n*   This area, where the Vietnamese forces intercepted and defeated Mu Sheng's army advancing from Yunnan, corresponds to the territory of the modern-day **Tuyên Quang Province** in Vietnam.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Distinguishing between generals:** It is crucial not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with the more famous annihilation of Liu Sheng's army at Chi Lăng, which is in Lạng Sơn Province. The question specifically asks about Mu Sheng.\n*   **Defining \"major defeat\":** While Mu Sheng may have encountered smaller setbacks earlier in the decade-long conflict, the failure of the massive 1427 relief expedition under his command was his most significant and undeniable major defeat. It directly led to the end of the Ming occupation.\n*   **Historical Geography:** Accurately mapping the historical battle names (Lãnh Câu, Đan Xá) and geographical features (Sông Lô) to modern administrative divisions is key to finding the correct answer.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the location of Mu Sheng's first major defeat is in the area of modern Tuyên Quang Province.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
