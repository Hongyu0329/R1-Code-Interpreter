    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Reverse Turn:** This is a standard figure in ballroom dancing where the couple turns to the left. It's a fundamental building block in most of the dances listed.\n*   **Overturning:** This means turning more than the prescribed amount for a specific figure according to the official technique. For example, if a step is supposed to turn 1/4 (90 degrees), overturning would mean turning 3/8 or 1/2.\n*   **Disregarding the Technique:** This means performing an action that violates the fundamental principles of a particular dance. This could relate to footwork, posture, rise and fall, body sway, or the character of the movement.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Technique of the Reverse Turn in Each Dance**\n\nThe question asks in which dance it is *impossible* to overturn a reverse turn without violating the technique. This implies that in one of these dances, the act of overturning fundamentally breaks the core rules of the dance itself, more so than in the others.\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz, B. English Waltz, D. Slow Foxtrot, E. Quickstep:** These four dances are known as \"swing dances.\" They share common technical elements:\n    *   **Swing:** The body swings like a pendulum through the legs.\n    *   **Rise and Fall:** The dancers rise onto their toes and lower to their heels to create elevation and momentum.\n    *   **Contra Body Movement (CBM):** The body turns against the moving leg to initiate rotation.\n    *   **Sway:** The body inclines to the side to maintain balance during turns.\n    In these swing dances, a reverse turn is executed using these principles. Overturning a reverse turn is a very common technical fault. It leads to poor balance, incorrect alignment, and a loss of control. However, a dancer *can* physically turn more than they are supposed to. While this is a clear disregard for *good* technique, the action is still fundamentally a \"swing\" action. The dancer is essentially \"over-swinging\" or \"over-rotating,\" but they are still using the core mechanics of swing, rise and fall, and CBM, albeit incorrectly.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** The Tango is fundamentally different from the swing dances. Its technique is characterized by:\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dance is kept flat and grounded, with bent knees. Movement is often described as a \"prowl\" or \"stalk.\"\n    *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp, clipped, and dramatic, with pauses (stillness).\n    *   **No Sway:** The body is held strong and upright with no inclination or sway.\n    *   **Specific Footwork:** Feet are picked up and placed deliberately. In many figures, the feet do not brush or close together in the same way as in a Waltz.\n    The Tango Reverse Turn is executed with these principles. The turn is sharp and compact, generated from the feet and legs with a strong frame, not from body swing. To achieve more rotation than the prescribed amount (to \"overturn\" it), a dancer would be forced to introduce elements that are forbidden in Tango technique. For example, they might have to:\n    1.  Introduce **sway** to get around their partner.\n    2.  Use **rise and fall** to create momentum.\n    3.  Allow the feet to **brush or cross** in a manner typical of a swing dance.\n    4.  Use **CBM** in a way that creates a flowing, swinging rotation instead of a sharp, clipped turn.\n    Doing any of these things means the dancer is no longer performing a Tango step. They are fundamentally disregarding the core technique and character of the dance.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude and Select the Answer**\n\nIn the swing dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), overturning a reverse turn is a *quantitative error*â€”doing too much of a correct action. It's poor technique, but the fundamental nature of the movement remains within the \"swing\" family.\n\nIn the European Tango, overturning a reverse turn is a *qualitative error*. To achieve the extra rotation, one must introduce actions (like swing, sway, or rise) that are antithetical to the dance's core identity. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango reverse turn without fundamentally disregarding its technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
