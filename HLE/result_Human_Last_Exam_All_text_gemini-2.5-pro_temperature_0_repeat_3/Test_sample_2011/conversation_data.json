    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the core components of the question:**\n    *   **Graph Size:** We are working with graphs that have exactly `n = 128` vertices.\n    *   **Subgraph Type:** We are interested in \"cliques\", which are complete subgraphs (`K_k`).\n    *   **Subgraph Condition:** The cliques must be \"induced subgraphs\".\n    *   **Objective:** We need to find the *maximum possible number of different clique sizes* that can exist in a single graph `G` on 128 vertices.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the terminology:**\n    *   A **clique** of size `k` (denoted `K_k`) is a set of `k` vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the set.\n    *   An **induced subgraph** `G[S]` on a set of vertices `S` contains all vertices in `S` and *only* the edges from the original graph `G` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n    *   **\"Different clique sizes\"**: If a graph has a `K_3` and a `K_5`, this counts as two different clique sizes (3 and 5). We want to maximize how many such distinct numbers we can find in one graph.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Induced Subgraph vs. Subgraph for Cliques:** For a clique, the distinction between being a \"subgraph\" and an \"induced subgraph\" is not critical. If a set of `k` vertices forms a `K_k` subgraph (i.e., all edges are present), it automatically forms an induced `K_k` because there are no more possible edges to add or omit within that set of vertices. This simplifies the problem.\n\n2.  **Vertex Limitation:** A clique of size `k` requires `k` vertices. Since our graph has only `n = 128` vertices, it is impossible to have a clique of a size larger than 128. This gives us an immediate upper bound on the possible clique sizes.\n\n3.  **Maximizing the *Number* of Sizes:** The goal is not to find the largest clique, but to maximize the count of distinct clique sizes. For example, a graph with cliques of sizes {3, 4, 5} has 3 different clique sizes. A graph with cliques of sizes {10, 20} has only 2 different clique sizes.\n\n4.  **Overlapping vs. Disjoint Cliques:** The cliques are not required to be disjoint (i.e., they can share vertices). This is a crucial point. A larger clique naturally contains many smaller cliques. For instance, any `K_5` contains `K_4`, `K_3`, and `K_2` as induced subgraphs. Using this overlap is far more efficient in terms of vertices than creating separate, disjoint cliques.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer\n\n1.  **Establish an Upper Bound:**\n    *   Let `G` be any graph with 128 vertices.\n    *   Suppose `G` contains an induced clique of size `k`. This clique is formed by a set of `k` vertices.\n    *   Since `G` only has 128 vertices in total, it must be that `k <= 128`.\n    *   Therefore, any possible clique size must be an integer between 1 and 128 (assuming a single vertex is a `K_1`).\n    *   The set of all possible clique sizes that can appear in `G` is a subset of `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\n    *   The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is therefore at most the size of this set, which is 128.\n\n2.  **Prove the Upper Bound is Achievable (Constructive Proof):**\n    *   Now, we must show that there exists at least one graph on 128 vertices that actually achieves this maximum of 128 different clique sizes.\n    *   Consider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted `K_{128}`. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    *   Let's check the clique sizes present in `K_{128}`.\n    *   Pick any integer `k` such that `1 <= k <= 128`.\n    *   We can choose any subset of `k` vertices from the 128 available vertices.\n    *   Let this subset of `k` vertices be `V'`.\n    *   Since every vertex in `K_{128}` is connected to every other vertex, all vertices in our chosen subset `V'` are mutually connected.\n    *   By definition, this subset of `k` vertices forms an induced clique of size `k` (an induced `K_k`).\n    *   Since we can do this for *any* `k` from 1 to 128, the graph `K_{128}` contains induced cliques of all sizes: 1, 2, 3, ..., 128.\n    *   The set of different clique sizes present in `K_{128}` is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 128}`.\n    *   The number of elements in this set is 128.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that the number of different clique sizes cannot exceed 128.\n    *   We have constructed a specific graph, `K_{128}`, that contains exactly 128 different clique sizes.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
