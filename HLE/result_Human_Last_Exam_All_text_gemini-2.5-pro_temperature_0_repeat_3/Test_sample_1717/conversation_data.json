    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health in Expert Mode:**\n    *   First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu for a single player in Expert Mode.\n    *   In Normal Mode, its health is 2,800.\n    *   In Expert Mode, this health is increased. For the Eye of Cthulhu, its health for a single player in Expert Mode is **3,640**. This value is the starting point before multiplayer scaling is applied.\n\n2.  **Understand the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula:**\n    *   Terraria increases boss health based on the number of players in the world to maintain a challenge.\n    *   In Expert Mode, the health is multiplied by a factor calculated with the formula: `Multiplier = 1 + 0.35 * (N - 1)`, where `N` is the number of players.\n    *   The final health is calculated as: `Total Health = (Base Expert Health) * Multiplier`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition and Game Limits:**\n    *   The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players.\n    *   If we were to plug infinity into the formula for `N`, the multiplier `1 + 0.35 * (N - 1)` would also become infinite.\n    *   However, the game's code has a built-in limitation to prevent health from scaling indefinitely. This is a crucial point.\n    *   According to the source code, the multiplayer health scaling multiplier is **capped at a maximum value of 11**.\n\n4.  **Determine When the Cap is Reached:**\n    *   We can find the number of players at which this cap is met or exceeded:\n        *   `1 + 0.35 * (N - 1) >= 11`\n        *   `0.35 * (N - 1) >= 10`\n        *   `N - 1 >= 10 / 0.35`\n        *   `N - 1 >= 28.57...`\n        *   `N >= 29.57...`\n    *   Since the number of players must be an integer, this means for any number of players `N` equal to 30 or more, the game will use the hard-coded cap of 11 for the multiplier.\n    *   Because the question assumes an infinite number of players, we must use this maximum capped multiplier.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Theoretical Maximum Health:**\n    *   Now we combine the base Expert Mode health with the maximum possible multiplier.\n    *   Base Expert Health (1 player): 3,640\n    *   Maximum Multiplayer Multiplier (the cap): 11\n    *   Theoretical Maximum Health = 3,640 * 11\n    *   Calculation: `3640 * 11 = 40,040`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is **40,040**.\n\n<<<40040>>>"
