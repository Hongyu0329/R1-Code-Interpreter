  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core components of the problem.**\n*   **Ciphertext (the encrypted data):** The book \"Ching\", which contains exactly 9999 symbols. These symbols are the carriers of the encrypted information.\n*   **Plaintext Alphabet (the set of possible characters in the message):** The 120 most common Chinese characters found in the book \"Shu\".\n*   **The Goal:** To find the *maximum possible length* of the secret message.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the ciphertext and the plaintext.**\nThe 9999 symbols in the Ching are used to encode the secret message, which is composed of characters from the 120-character alphabet. The length of the message depends on how many symbols are used to represent a single character.\n*   Let's say it takes `k` symbols from the Ching to represent one character of the message.\n*   The total number of symbols available is 9999.\n*   The length of the message would be `9999 / k`.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the condition for the *maximum* message length.**\nTo get the maximum possible message length, we need to make the value of `k` (the number of symbols per character) as small as possible. The smallest possible integer value for `k` is 1. This represents the most efficient encoding scheme where each symbol in the Ching corresponds to exactly one character in the secret message.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the feasibility of the most efficient encoding (k=1).**\n*   If `k=1`, we are proposing a one-to-one mapping: 1 symbol from Ching -> 1 character of the message.\n*   The Ching provides 9999 symbols.\n*   The message alphabet has 120 characters.\n*   This is perfectly feasible. Each of the 9999 symbols can be assigned a character from the 120-character set. For example, the first symbol could be the character 'A', the second could be 'B', the third could be 'A' again, and so on. The number of available characters (120) is sufficient to form a message, and it does not limit the message's length.\n\n**Step 5: Consider and discard irrelevant information (careful points).**\nThe problem contains several pieces of information designed to be distracting. It's crucial to identify why they are not relevant to the final answer.\n*   **\"Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\":** This is irrelevant. The important piece of information is the size of the *alphabet* used for the message, which is 120, not the total length of the book Shu.\n*   **\"Computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms\":** This is a detail about the discovery process, not about the structure of the message itself. It does not affect the message's length.\n*   **\"Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns\":** This is also irrelevant information about the technology used for analysis and has no bearing on the information capacity of the Ching.\n*   **\"yinyang-wuxing\":** This detail might tempt one to consider a more complex encoding scheme. For example, Yin/Yang (2 states) and Wuxing (5 states) give 10 possible symbol types. To encode 120 characters, one would need `10^k >= 120`, which means `k=3` symbols per character. This would lead to a message length of `9999 / 3 = 3333`. However, the question asks for the **maximum** length, so we must choose the encoding scheme that yields the longest message, which is `k=1`.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the final answer.**\nBased on the analysis, the maximum length of the message is achieved when the encoding is most efficient, i.e., one symbol from the Ching represents one character of the message. Since there are 9999 symbols in the Ching, the maximum possible length of the message is 9999 characters.\n\n<<<9999>>>"
