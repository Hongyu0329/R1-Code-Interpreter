    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the primary mountain, Mount Olympus.**\nThe question sets Mount Olympus as the benchmark. It is the most prominent mountain in the Iliad, serving as the home of the gods. It is a real, historical mountain in Greece and is the tallest in the country.\n*   **Mount Olympus:** Elevation 2,918 meters (9,573 ft).\n\n**Step 2: List other historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad.**\nWe need to comb through the text of the Iliad to find other named mountains that correspond to real-world locations.\n\n*   **Mount Ida:** This is a very significant mountain in the epic. Zeus often sits on the peaks of Ida (specifically the peak Gargarus) to watch the Trojan War unfold. This refers to the Mount Ida near Troy in modern-day Turkey.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (referred to as \"Samos\"):** In Book 13, Poseidon watches the battle from the \"topmost peak of wooded Samos,\" which scholars identify as the island of Samothrace. The mountain on this island is Mount Fengari.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, as the goddess Hera travels from Olympus to Lemnos, her path takes her over several landmarks, including \"snowy Athos.\" This is the well-known mountain on the Chalkidiki peninsula in Greece.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** In Book 16, the epic mentions the formidable spear of Achilles, which was fashioned from an ash tree on the summit of Mount Pelion. This is a historical mountain in Thessaly, Greece.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** In Book 2, the \"Catalogue of Ships\" describes the forces of the Maeonians, who are said to live \"under snowy Tmolus.\" This refers to a mountain range in ancient Lydia, in modern-day Turkey.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the elevations of these historical mountains.**\nNow, we find the modern elevations for each of the identified mountains to compare them.\n\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Modern Name: Bozdağlar):** Elevation 2,159 meters (7,083 ft).\n*   **Mount Athos:** Elevation 2,033 meters (6,670 ft).\n*   **Mount Ida (Modern Name: Kaz Dağı):** Elevation 1,774 meters (5,820 ft).\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Elevation 1,624 meters (5,328 ft).\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Modern Name: Mount Fengari/Saos):** Elevation 1,611 meters (5,285 ft).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the elevations to find the tallest after Olympus.**\nWe now rank the mountains from Step 3 by their height:\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,159 m\n2.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n3.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n5.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **\"Mentioned\" vs. \"Significant\":** The question asks for any mountain \"mentioned,\" not just those that play a major role. Mount Tmolus has a brief but clear mention in the Catalogue of Ships, which qualifies it.\n*   **Historical Identification:** All the mountains listed are confidently identified with real-world locations by classical scholars.\n*   **Excluding Mythical Locations:** The question specifies \"historical mountain,\" so we exclude vague or purely mythical locations like the \"mountains of the Solymi,\" whose identification is speculative.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAfter Mount Olympus (2,918 m), the next tallest historical mountain explicitly named in the Iliad is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
