    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Goal and Given Information**\n*   **Goal:** Find the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$, where $\\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in the electron's momentum and $p$ is the momentum of the electron.\n*   **Given:**\n    *   The electron is in the first Bohr orbit, which means the principal quantum number is $n=1$.\n    *   The uncertainty in the electron's position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Formula for the Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$)**\n*   We use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum is at least a certain minimum value.\n*   The formula is: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant ($\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$).\n*   To find the minimum uncertainty in momentum, we use the equality: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n*   Rearranging for $\\Delta p$, we get: $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Formula for the Momentum ($p$) in the First Bohr Orbit**\n*   According to Bohr's model, the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in an orbit is quantized: $L = n\\hbar$.\n*   Angular momentum is also defined as $L = mvr = pr$, where $p$ is the linear momentum and $r$ is the orbital radius.\n*   Therefore, we have $pr = n\\hbar$.\n*   For the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$, and the radius $r$ is the Bohr radius, denoted as $a_0$.\n*   So, for the first orbit, the momentum $p$ is given by: $p \\cdot a_0 = 1 \\cdot \\hbar$, which simplifies to $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}$.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$**\n*   Now we can write the ratio using the expressions derived in Step 2 and Step 3.\n    *   $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n    *   $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}$\n*   The ratio is:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}}$\n*   We can simplify this expression by canceling out the reduced Planck's constant, $\\hbar$:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{1}{2 \\Delta x} \\times \\frac{a_0}{1} = \\frac{a_0}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the Known Values and Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   **Careful Point on Units:** We must use consistent units. The Bohr radius is typically given in meters (m), and the given position uncertainty is in picometers (pm). We need to convert pm to m.\n    *   $1 \\text{ pm} = 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$\n    *   Therefore, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   **Constants:**\n    *   Bohr radius, $a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   Substitute the values into the simplified ratio formula:\n        $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{a_0}{2 \\Delta x} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n    *   $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11}}{2 \\times 10^{-11}}$\n    *   The $10^{-11}$ terms cancel out:\n        $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29}{2}$\n    *   $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = 2.645$\n\nThe ratio is a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the result of the calculation.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
