    "## Unveiling Photon Gas Equilibrium through the Lens of Large Deviation Theory\n\nThe equilibrium properties of a photon gas, specifically its entropy and mean energy, can be rigorously determined using the powerful mathematical framework of large deviation theory, namely the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. This approach provides a deeper understanding of the statistical nature of light quanta, reaffirming the foundational results of Bose and Planck.\n\nThe core idea of large deviation theory is to quantify the probability of rare eventsâ€”specifically, the deviation of macroscopic properties of a system from their most probable values. In the context of statistical mechanics, the state of thermodynamic equilibrium is the most probable state, and large deviation theorems describe the exponentially small probability of observing a state far from this equilibrium.\n\n### Spatial Distribution and Entropy: The Boltzmann-Sanov Perspective\n\nFor a gas of photons, which are indistinguishable particles (bosons), their spatial distribution among different cells or states can be analyzed using the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem. This theorem is concerned with the large deviations of the empirical measure (the observed frequencies of particles in different states) from the true probability distribution.\n\nSanov's theorem demonstrates that the probability of observing a particular macroscopic arrangement of photons decreases exponentially as this arrangement deviates from the most probable one. The \"rate\" of this decrease is quantified by the relative entropy (also known as the Kullback-Leibler divergence). In this context, the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy is directly proportional to the logarithm of the spatial probability distribution of the photons.\n\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, the system is found in its most probable macrostate. According to the principles of large deviations, this corresponds to the minimization of the rate function, which in this case is the relative entropy. Conversely, this is equivalent to the maximization of the thermodynamic entropy. Therefore, by applying the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem and finding the distribution that minimizes the relative entropy under the given physical constraints (like the total number of particles and total energy), we arrive at the equilibrium entropy of the photon gas.\n\n### Energy Distribution and Mean Energy: The Cramer-Chernoff Approach\n\nThe Cramer-Chernoff theorem comes into play when we consider the energy distribution of the photon gas. The total energy of the gas can be viewed as the sum of the energies of individual photons, which can be treated as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem provides an exponentially decreasing upper bound on the probability that the average energy of the system deviates significantly from its expected value.\n\nThis theorem is closely tied to the moment generating function of the energy distribution, which is essentially the partition function in statistical mechanics. The large deviation function in the Cramer-Chernoff theorem, which determines the exponential decay of the probability of energy fluctuations, is minimized when the system is at thermodynamic equilibrium. This minimization condition, when solved, yields the equilibrium mean energy of the photon gas. The Boltzmann-Gibbs canonical entropy, which is proportional to the logarithm of the energy probability distribution, reaches its maximum at this equilibrium point, corresponding to the minimum of the Cramer-Chernoff rate function.\n\nIn essence, these large deviation theorems provide a rigorous mathematical justification for the principles of entropy maximization and energy minimization in statistical mechanics. By applying these theorems to the specific case of a gas of light quanta (photons) that obey Bose-Einstein statistics, one can re-derive the well-known expressions for their equilibrium entropy and mean energy, thus placing the original work of Bose and Planck on a firm footing within modern probability theory.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta are found by applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems. The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is used to analyze the spatial distribution of photons, where the minimization of the relative entropy (the rate function) corresponds to the maximization of the thermodynamic entropy at equilibrium. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem is applied to the energy distribution, treating the total energy as a sum of i.i.d. random variables. The minimization of the Cramer-Chernoff rate function at thermodynamic equilibrium determines the mean energy of the photon gas.>>>"
