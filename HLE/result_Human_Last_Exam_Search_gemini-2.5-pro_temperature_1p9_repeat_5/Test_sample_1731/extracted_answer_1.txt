The equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of the light quanta are found by applying the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems. The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is used to analyze the spatial distribution of photons, where the minimization of the relative entropy (the rate function) corresponds to the maximization of the thermodynamic entropy at equilibrium. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem is applied to the energy distribution, treating the total energy as a sum of i.i.d. random variables. The minimization of the Cramer-Chernoff rate function at thermodynamic equilibrium determines the mean energy of the photon gas.
