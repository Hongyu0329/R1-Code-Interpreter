The value of the critical exponent ν cannot be determined because the "G₄-theoretical framework" is not a recognized, well-defined model in the scientific literature on statistical physics and critical phenomena. The value of ν is model-dependent, and without a definition of the theory, its universality class and corresponding exponents are unknown.
