    "The single known integer value that completes the sequence is 273862.\n\nThis sequence is a part of the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) sequence A118534. The sequence is defined by finding the largest integer `l` such that the next prime number `p(n+1)` is equal to the current prime number `p(n)` plus the remainder of `p(n)` divided by `l`.\n\nThe provided numbers correspond to the 25th through 30th terms of this sequence:\n*   a(25) = 24663\n*   a(26) = 35005\n*   a(27) = 119261\n*   a(28) = 196219\n*   a(29) = 211770\n*   a(30) = 227296\n\nThe next term in the sequence is a(31). As of August 2022, the value for a(31) was known to be 273862.\n\n<<<273862>>>"
