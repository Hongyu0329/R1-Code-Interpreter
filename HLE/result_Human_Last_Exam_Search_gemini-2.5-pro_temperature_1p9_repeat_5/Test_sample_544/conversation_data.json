  "response_list": [
    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with one equivalent of triflic anhydride and one equivalent of trimethylsilyl cyanide results in a Pummerer-type reaction. In this reaction, the triflic anhydride activates the sulfoxide, making the Î±-carbon (the carbon of the methyl group) susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the cyanide ion from trimethylsilyl cyanide. This process leads to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\nThe final product of this reaction is 2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile. This compound has the chemical formula C8H7NS.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this product is 2-phenylsulfanylacetonitrile.\n\n<<<2-(phenylthio)acetonitrile>>>"
