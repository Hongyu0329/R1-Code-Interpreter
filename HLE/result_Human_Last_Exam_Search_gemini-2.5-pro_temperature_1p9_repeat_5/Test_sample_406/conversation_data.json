    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X × Y × Z → X, G:Y × X × Z → Y, and H:Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, z) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The conditions for the existence of such a point are generally established in the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\nThe key conditions are as follows:\n\n### **1. The Underlying Space:**\n\nThe sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces. This means that every Cauchy sequence of elements in each space converges to a point within that same space. The spaces are also endowed with partial orders, denoted by `(X, ≤)`, `(Y, ≤)`, and `(Z, ≤)`. A product space `X × Y × Z` can then be defined with a corresponding partial order.\n\n### **2. Mixed Monotone Property:**\n\nThe triplet of functions (F, G, H) must satisfy a **mixed monotone property**. This property dictates how the functions behave with respect to the partial orderings on their domain and codomain. Specifically, for any x, x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n\n*   **For F:** F is non-decreasing in its first argument, non-increasing in its second argument, and non-decreasing in its third argument. This means:\n    *   If x₁ ≤ x₂, then F(x₁, y, z) ≤ F(x₂, y, z).\n    *   If y₁ ≤ y₂, then F(x, y₁, z) ≥ F(x, y₂, z).\n    *   If z₁ ≤ z₂, then F(x, y, z₁) ≤ F(x, y, z₂).\n\n*   **For G:** G is non-decreasing in its first argument, non-increasing in its second argument, and non-decreasing in its third argument. This means:\n    *   If y₁ ≤ y₂, then G(y₁, x, z) ≤ G(y₂, x, z).\n    *   If x₁ ≤ x₂, then G(y, x₁, z) ≥ G(y, x₂, z).\n    *   If z₁ ≤ z₂, then G(y, x, z₁) ≤ G(y, x, z₂).\n\n*   **For H:** H is non-decreasing in its first argument, non-increasing in its second argument, and non-decreasing in its third argument. This means:\n    *   If z₁ ≤ z₂, then H(z₁, y, x) ≤ H(z₂, y, x).\n    *   If y₁ ≤ y₂, then H(z, y₁, x) ≥ H(z, y₂, x).\n    *   If x₁ ≤ x₂, then H(z, y, x₁) ≤ H(z, y, x₂).\n\n### **3. Contractive Condition:**\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contractive-type condition. This condition ensures that when the functions are applied iteratively, the distances between successive points decrease, leading to convergence to a fixed point. A common form of this condition for FGH-tripled fixed points is:\n\nFor all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z with x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w, there exist constants `k, l, m ∈ [0, 1)` with `k + l + m < 1` such that:\n\n`d(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) + d(G(y, x, z), G(v, u, w)) + d(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ k * d(x, u) + l * d(y, v) + m * d(z, w)`\n\nwhere `d` represents the metric on the respective spaces. This inequality essentially states that the mapping from (x, y, z) to (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, z), H(z, y, x)) is a contraction on the product space endowed with a suitable metric.\n\n### **4. Existence of a Starting Point:**\n\nThere must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies the following ordering relations with the first iteration of the functions:\n\n*   x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, z₀)\n*   z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nAlternatively, the condition can be that x₀ ≥ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≤ G(y₀, x₀, z₀), and z₀ ≥ H(z₀, y₀, x₀).\n\n### **5. Continuity or an Alternative Condition:**\n\nOne of the following must hold:\n\n*   The functions F, G, and H are continuous. This ensures that if sequences (xₙ), (yₙ), and (zₙ) converge to x, y, and z respectively, then F(xₙ, yₙ, zₙ) converges to F(x, y, z), and similarly for G and H.\n*   Alternatively, if the functions are not necessarily continuous, the spaces must satisfy a regularity condition. For instance, if a non-decreasing sequence {xₙ} converges to x, then xₙ ≤ x for all n, and if a non-increasing sequence {yₙ} converges to y, then yₙ ≥ y for all n (and similarly for Z).\n\nIf these conditions are met, then there exists an FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z). Furthermore, if the product space `X × Y × Z` has the property that for any two elements, there is a third element that is comparable to both, then the FGH-tripled fixed point is unique.\n\nThese conditions are a generalization of the principles found in the well-known Banach Contraction Principle to the case of multidimensional fixed points in partially ordered metric spaces.\n\n<<<The conditions for the functions `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y` and `H:Z*Y*X→Z` to have an FGH-tripled fixed point are typically established within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces. An FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet `(x, y, z)` such that `x = F(x, y, z)`, `y = G(y, x, z)`, and `z = H(z, y, x)`. The primary conditions are:\n\n1.  **Complete Metric Spaces**: The spaces `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be complete metric spaces, each equipped with a partial ordering (`≤_X`, `≤_Y`, `≤_Z`).\n\n2.  **Mixed Monotone Property**: The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must have a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial orderings. This means that for each function, the output is non-decreasing with respect to some arguments and non-increasing with respect to others. For an FGH-tripled fixed point, a common requirement is that the functions are non-decreasing in the first and third arguments and non-increasing in the second argument.\n\n3.  **Contractive Condition**: The functions must satisfy a contractive type condition. This ensures that iterating the functions brings points closer together. A typical contractive condition is that for all `x, u ∈ X`, `y, v ∈ Y`, and `z, w ∈ Z` for which `x ≥ u`, `y ≤ v`, and `z ≥ w`, there exist constants `k, l, m ∈ [0, 1)` with `k + l + m < 1` such that:\n    `d_X(F(x,y,z), F(u,v,w)) + d_Y(G(y,x,z), G(v,u,w)) + d_Z(H(z,y,x), H(w,v,u)) ≤ k * d_X(x,u) + l * d_Y(y,v) + m * d_Z(z,w)`.\n\n4.  **Existence of an Initial Point**: There must exist an initial triplet `(x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z` such that either:\n    *   `x₀ ≤ F(x₀,y₀,z₀)`, `y₀ ≥ G(y₀,x₀,z₀)`, and `z₀ ≤ H(z₀,y₀,x₀)`\n    *   or the reverse inequalities hold.\n\n5.  **Continuity or a Regularity Condition**:\n    *   Either the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` are continuous.\n    *   Or, if they are not continuous, the space must satisfy a regularity property, for instance, that for any convergent monotonic sequence, all its terms are related by the partial order to the limit of the sequence.\n\nUnder these conditions, an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist. Uniqueness often requires an additional condition, such as every pair of elements in the product space having an upper or lower bound.>>>"
