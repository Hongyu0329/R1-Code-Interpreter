    "The primary distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement and quality of the arms and head throughout the movement, which is particularly evident in the *allongé* phase.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, the execution of a cambré derrière is highly codified within its system of port de bras (carriage of the arms). The arms are typically held in well-defined positions, such as a low second position, and the head and upper body are used in a coordinated and often \"exaggerated\" manner. When moving into allongé, the Vaganova technique emphasizes a stretching of the elbows and a specific rotation of the palms. The focus is on creating a long, unbroken line and maintaining clear, specific positions of the arms and head, such as looking over the forearm. The backbend itself is often taught to originate from the upper back, reaching to the base of the shoulder blades, with the neck kept long and uncrunched.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is characterized by a different aesthetic that prioritizes speed, energy, and a more \"neoclassical\" line. In a Balanchine cambré derrière, the arms are often held higher and are more expressive, with a sense of greater freedom and fluidity. There is a characteristic \"Balanchine hand\" and arm placement that can involve crossing the body's centerline to create dynamic angles. The feeling is one of a continuous, gracious curve extending from the top of the head down through the upper chest. While both methods emphasize correct technique, the Balanchine style allows for more individual expressiveness in the arms.\n\nIn summary, while there are general differences in speed, hip placement, and degree of backbend between the two methods, the most pronounced and specific distinction in the cambré derrière is the stylistic and technical approach to the arm placement during the allongé.\n\n<<<A>>>"
