    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and then analyze their stability. The separatrices are the trajectories that divide the phase plane into regions of different long-term behavior, and they are typically the stable and unstable manifolds associated with saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\n**1. Equilibrium Points:**\nWe set $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$ to find the equilibrium points in the $(d, u)$ phase plane.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case u = 0:** Substituting into the equation for $d'$, we have $2d^2 = 0$, which gives $d=0$. So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   **Case u = 1:** Substituting into the equation for $d'$, we have $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ and $d=-1$. So, $(0, 1)$ and $(-1, 1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the upper half-plane ($u \\ge 0$) are $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 1)$.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis:**\nWe classify these points by linearizing the system and finding the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at each point.\n\n*   At **(0, 1)**, the Jacobian matrix has eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since both are positive, $(0, 1)$ is an **unstable node** (a source).\n*   At **(-1, 1)**, the Jacobian matrix has eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since one is positive and the other is negative, $(-1, 1)$ is a **saddle point**.\n*   At **(0, 0)**, the Jacobian is the zero matrix, so the linearization is inconclusive. This point is a degenerate equilibrium.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix:**\nSeparatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(-1, 1)$.\n\n*   **Stable Manifold:** The stable manifold corresponds to the negative eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = -2$. The associated eigenvector is $(1, 0)$, which indicates that the stable manifold lies along the line $u=1$.\n*   **Unstable Manifold:** The unstable manifold corresponds to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = 1$. The associated eigenvector is $(-2, 1)$, which means trajectories leave the saddle point in this direction. The slope of the manifold at this point is $du/dd = -1/2$.\n\nA separatrix is an invariant curve passing through a saddle point. We can test for a simple algebraic curve of the form $d=f(u)$. Let's test the curve $d = -u^2$. This is an invariant set of the system if it satisfies the condition $\\frac{d}{dt}(d+u^2)=0$ whenever $d=-u^2$.\n\nLet's compute the derivative of $(d+u^2)$ with respect to t:\n$\\frac{d}{dt}(d+u^2) = d' + 2uu'$\n$= [2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^3(u-1)] + 2u[u^2(u-1)]$\n$= 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + 3u^3(u-1)$\n\nNow, we substitute $d=-u^2$:\n$= 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) + 3u^4-3u^3$\n$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 + 3u^4 - 3u^3 = 0$\n\nSince the result is zero, $d = -u^2$ is an invariant curve of the system. Let's check if it corresponds to the unstable manifold of the saddle point:\n*   The curve passes through $(-1, 1)$ since $-1 = -(1)^2$.\n*   The derivative is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2$. This matches the direction of the eigenvector $(-2, 1)$ for the unstable manifold.\n\nTherefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is one branch of the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(-1, 1)$. This invariant curve connects the saddle point $(-1, 1)$ to the degenerate equilibrium point $(0, 0)$ and acts as a separatrix in the phase plane.\n\n<<<The separatrix is given by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
