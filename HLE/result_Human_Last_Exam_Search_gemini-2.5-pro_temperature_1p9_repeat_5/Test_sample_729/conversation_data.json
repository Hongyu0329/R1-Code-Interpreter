    "A power subgroup is a subgroup that is generated by a single element; in other words, it is a cyclic subgroup. To find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, we must determine the number of its cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group Q_128 has the following presentation:\nQ_128 = < a, b | a⁶⁴ = 1, b² = a³², b⁻¹ab = a⁻¹ >.\n\nWe can categorize the cyclic subgroups of Q_128 into two sets: those contained within the cyclic subgroup `<a>`, and those that are not.\n\n1.  **Cyclic subgroups contained in `<a>`:**\n    The element 'a' generates a cyclic subgroup `<a>` of order 64. For any cyclic group of order 'n', there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of 'n'. The number of divisors of 64 (which is 2⁶) is given by the divisor function τ(64) = 6 + 1 = 7. These seven subgroups are all cyclic (and thus are power subgroups). They are the subgroups generated by a, a², a⁴, a⁸, a¹⁶, a³², and a⁶⁴ (which is the trivial subgroup).\n\n2.  **Cyclic subgroups not contained in `<a>`:**\n    The elements of Q_128 that are not in the subgroup `<a>` are of the form aᵏb, where k is an integer from 0 to 63. There are 64 such elements.\n\n    Let's determine the order of these elements. The square of an element aᵏb is:\n    (aᵏb)² = aᵏb * aᵏb = aᵏ(baᵏb⁻¹)b² = aᵏ(a⁻ᵏ)b² = b² = a³².\n\n    Since (aᵏb)² = a³², the fourth power is (a³²)² = a⁶⁴ = 1. This shows that every element outside of `<a>` has an order of 4.\n\n    Each of these 64 elements generates a cyclic subgroup of order 4. A cyclic group of order 4 has φ(4) = 2 generators (where φ is Euler's totient function). Therefore, the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by these elements is the total number of these elements divided by the number of generators per subgroup:\n    Number of subgroups = 64 / 2 = 32.\n\n    These 32 cyclic subgroups are distinct from the cyclic subgroups of `<a>` because they contain elements not in `<a>`.\n\n**Total Number of Power Subgroups:**\nBy summing the number of cyclic subgroups from both categories, we get the total number of power subgroups in Q_128:\nTotal = (subgroups from `<a>`) + (subgroups not in `<a>`) = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\nTherefore, there are 39 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<39>>>"
