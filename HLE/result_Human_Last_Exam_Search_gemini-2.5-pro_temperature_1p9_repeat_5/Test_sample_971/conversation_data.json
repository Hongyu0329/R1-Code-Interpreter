    "Despite extensive research, the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of *Don Quixote* with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008 could not be definitively determined.\n\nNatalia Osipova's portrayal of Kitri in *Don Quixote* during her time with the Bolshoi Ballet is widely acclaimed. Reviews from around that period praise her for her \"breathtaking technique\" and for \"tossing off multiple pirouettes with a laugh.\" Her performances were noted for their exceptional speed and her ability to execute a remarkable number of revolutions.\n\nSeveral video recordings of Osipova's 2008 performances as Kitri, including a guest appearance in Novosibirsk, Siberia, are referenced in various online sources. However, these videos are no longer accessible, preventing a direct count of the pirouettes. While her technical prowess in the role is a matter of record, detailed choreographic notes or reviews specifying the exact number of pirouettes in that particular variation from 2008 are not available in the public domain.\n\nIt is known that in a 2013 performance with the Mikhailovsky Ballet, she was noted for her \"technical brilliance,\" with one review mentioning \"awesome triple spins in the wedding act coda\" and questioning if a \"quadruple fouett√© en tournant\" was performed. However, this does not provide the specific count for the 2008 Act I variation with the Bolshoi.\n\nTherefore, while it is clear that Osipova's performance included a significant and impressive number of pirouettes, the precise count remains unconfirmed from available records.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number for the pirouettes based on the available information.>>>"
