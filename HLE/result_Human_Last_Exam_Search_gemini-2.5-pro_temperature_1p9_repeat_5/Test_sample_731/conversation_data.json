    "The user is asking for the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\nBased on the search results, here's a plan to answer the question:\n\n1.  **Define the Semidihedral Group SD(512):**\n    *   From the search results, the semidihedral group of order 2<sup>n</sup>, denoted SD(2<sup>n</sup>) or QD(2<sup>n</sup>), has the presentation:\n        `<r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2) - 1)>`\n    *   For the semidihedral group of size 512, we have 2<sup>n</sup> = 512, so n = 9.\n    *   Therefore, SD(512) has the presentation:\n        `<r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(128 - 1) = r^127>`\n\n2.  **Define a Power Subgroup:**\n    *   Search result defines the q-th power subgroup H<sup>q</sup> as the subgroup generated by the q-th powers of all elements in H: `H^q = <h^q | h ∈ H>`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Elements of SD(512):**\n    *   The group SD(512) has 512 elements.\n    *   The elements are of the form `r^i` for `0 <= i < 256` and `sr^i` for `0 <= i < 256`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Powers of the Elements:**\n    *   We need to find the subgroups generated by the k-th powers of all elements for all possible integers k.\n    *   Let `G = SD(512)`. We need to find the subgroups `G^k = <g^k | g ∈ G>`.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Structure of Powers in SD(512):**\n    *   For elements of the form `r^i`, the k-th power is `(r^i)^k = r^(ik)`.\n    *   For elements of the form `sr^i`, let's calculate their squares to understand their orders:\n        *   `(sr^i)^2 = sr^i * sr^i = s(r^i s)r^i = s(s r^(-i))r^i = s^2 * r^(-i) * r^i = 1`. No, this is for the dihedral group. Let's recheck the relation.\n        *   The relation is `srs = r^(2^(n-2)-1)`. Let `j = 2^(n-2)-1 = 127`.  So, `sr = r^j s`.  This also means `s r s^(-1) = r^j`, and since `s=s^(-1)`, we have `srs = r^j`.\n        *  What is `r^j s`? We have `sr = r^j s`. Post-multiplying by `s` gives `srs = r^j s^2 = r^j`. Pre-multiplying by `s` gives `rs = sr^j`.\n        * Let's calculate `(sr^i)^2`:\n            *   `(sr^i)^2 = sr^i s r^i = s (r^i s) r^i`\n            *   We need an expression for `r^i s`. From `rs=sr^j`, we can deduce by induction that `r^i s = s r^(i*j)`.  Let's check:  `r^2 s = r(rs) = r(sr^j) = (rs)r^j = (sr^j)r^j = s r^(j^2)`.\n            *  Actually `s r^i s = (srs)^i = (r^j)^i = r^(ij)`. So `r^i s = s r^(ij)`. This holds for `i=1`. `r s = s r^j`. This is correct.\n            * `(sr^i)^2 = s(r^i s)r^i = s(s r^(ij))r^i = s^2 r^(ij) r^i = r^(i(j+1))`.\n            *  Here `j = 127`. So `j+1 = 128 = 2^7`. So, `(sr^i)^2 = r^(i*128)`.\n            * Let's verify this is correct. For `n=4`, `SD(16)`, we have `j = 2^(2)-1 = 3`. So `j+1 = 4`. `srs = r^3`. `(sr^i)^2 = r^(4i)`.\n    *   So, the elements of SD(512) are `{r^i | 0 <= i < 256}` and `{sr^i | 0 <= i < 256}`.\n    *   Powers of `r^i` are `(r^i)^k = r^(ik)`.\n    *   Powers of `sr^i`:\n        *   `(sr^i)^k` depends on whether k is even or odd.\n        *   If `k = 2m`, then `(sr^i)^k = ((sr^i)^2)^m = (r^(i*128))^m = r^(128im)`.\n        *   If `k = 2m+1`, then `(sr^i)^k = (sr^i)^(2m) * (sr^i) = r^(128im) * sr^i`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Power Subgroups G^k:**\n    *   `G^k = < (r^i)^k, (sr^i)^k | 0 <= i < 256 >`\n    *   `G^k = < r^(ik), r^(128im) * sr^i (for k=2m+1) >`\n\n    *   Let's analyze this for different values of k.\n\n    *   **k = 1:** `G^1 = G`. This is one subgroup.\n\n    *   **k = 2:**\n        *   `(r^i)^2 = r^(2i)`. These generate the subgroup `<r^2>`.\n        *   `(sr^i)^2 = r^(128i)`. These generate `<r^128>`.\n        *   `G^2 = < <r^2>, <r^128> > = <r^2>`. This is a cyclic group of order 128. This is a second subgroup.\n\n    *   **k = 3 (odd):**\n        *   `(r^i)^3 = r^(3i)`. This generates `<r^3>` which is the same as `<r>` since gcd(3, 256)=1. So it generates `<r>`.\n        *   `(sr^i)^3 = (sr^i)^2 * sr^i = r^(128i) * sr^i`.\n        *   For i=0, we get `s^3 = s`. So `s` is in `G^3`.\n        *   Then `G^3` contains `<r>` and `s`.  Therefore, `G^3 = <r,s> = G`.\n\n    *   **Let's generalize for odd k:**\n        *   If `k` is odd, `gcd(k, 256)` might not be 1. Let `d = gcd(k, 256)`.\n        *   The subgroup generated by `(r^i)^k = r^(ik)` for all `i` is `<r^d>`.\n        *   `(sr^i)^k = (sr^i)^(k-1) * sr^i = ((sr^i)^2)^((k-1)/2) * sr^i = (r^(128i))^((k-1)/2) * sr^i = r^(64i(k-1)) * sr^i`.\n        *   If we take i=0, we get `s^k = s` (since k is odd). So `s` is in `G^k`.\n        *   Therefore, `G^k = < <r^d>, s >`.\n        *   The subgroup `<r^d>` is normalized by `s` since `s r^d s = (srs)^d = (r^j)^d = r^(jd)`, so `s<r^d>s = <r^d>`.\n        *   So for any odd k, `G^k = <s, r^d>` where `d = gcd(k, 256)`.\n        *   The possible values of `d = gcd(k, 256)` for odd k are the divisors of 256. But since k is odd, `d` must be a divisor of 256 that shares no factors with 2. The only such divisor is 1. So `d=1`.\n        *   This means for *any* odd `k`, `G^k = <s, r> = G`.\n        *   So, all odd powers `k` result in the same power subgroup, which is the group `G` itself. This gives us **1** subgroup.\n\n    *   **Let's generalize for even k, `k = 2m`:**\n        *   `(r^i)^k = r^(ik)`. These generate `<r^k>`. Let `d = gcd(k, 256)`. This is `<r^d>`.\n        *   `(sr^i)^k = ((sr^i)^2)^(k/2) = (r^(128i))^(k/2) = r^(64ik)`. These generate the subgroup `<r^(64k)>`.\n        *   `G^k = < <r^d>, <r^(64k)> >`.\n        *   Let `k=2`. `d=2`. `G^2 = < <r^2>, <r^128> > = <r^2>`.\n        *   Let `k=4`. `d=4`. `G^4 = < <r^4>, <r^256> > = <r^4>`.\n        *   Let `k=6`. `d=gcd(6, 256) = 2`. `G^6 = < <r^2>, <r^(64*6)> = <r^384> >`. Since `384 = 256 + 128`, `r^384 = r^128`. So `G^6 = < <r^2>, <r^128> > = <r^2>`.\n        *   Let `k = 2^a * l` where l is odd. `d = gcd(2^a*l, 256) = 2^a` since `l` is odd.\n        *   The subgroup is `G^k = < <r^(2^a)>, <r^(64k)> > = < <r^(2^a)>, <r^(64 * 2^a * l)> > = < <r^(2^a)>, <r^(2^(a+6) * l)> >`.\n        *   Since the order of `r` is 256 (`2^8`), we care about `2^(a+6) * l mod 256`. This is `2^(a+6) * l mod 2^8`.\n        *   If `a+6 >= 8` (i.e., `a >= 2`), then `r^(2^(a+6) * l)` is the identity `e`.\n            *   So if `a >= 2`, `G^k = <r^(2^a)>`.\n        *   If `a = 1` (k is divisible by 2 but not 4, e.g., k=2, 6, 10), then `k = 2l` with `l` odd. `a=1`.\n            *   `G^k = < <r^2>, <r^(128*l)> >`. Since `l` is odd, `gcd(l,2) = 1`, so `<r^(128*l)> = <r^128>`.\n            *   `G^k = < <r^2>, <r^128> > = <r^2>`. So for all k divisible by 2 but not 4, we get the subgroup `<r^2>`. This gives **1** new subgroup.\n        *   If `a = 2` (k is divisible by 4 but not 8, e.g., k=4, 12, 20), then `k = 4l` with `l` odd. `a=2`.\n            *   `G^k = <r^(4)>`. This gives **1** new subgroup.\n        *   If `a = 3` (k is divisible by 8 but not 16, e.g., k=8), `k = 8l`, `l` odd. `a=3`.\n            *   `G^k = <r^8>`. This gives **1** new subgroup.\n        *   If `a = 4`, `k=16l`, `G^k = <r^16>`.\n        *   If `a = 5`, `k=32l`, `G^k = <r^32>`.\n        *   If `a = 6`, `k=64l`, `G^k = <r^64>`.\n        *   If `a = 7`, `k=128l`, `G^k = <r^128>`.\n        *   If `a = 8`, `k=256l`, `G^k = <r^256> = <e>`. The trivial subgroup.\n        *   What if `k` is a multiple of `512`? Say `k=512`. Then `a=9`.\n            * `G^512 = <r^512> = <r^0> = {e}`.\n        * What if `k=0`? `G^0` is usually defined as the trivial subgroup `{e}`.\n\n    *   The distinct power subgroups are:\n        1.  `G` (for any odd `k`)\n        2.  `<r^2>` (for `k = 2l`, `l` odd)\n        3.  `<r^4>` (for `k = 4l`, `l` odd)\n        4.  `<r^8>` (for `k = 8l`, `l` odd)\n        5.  `<r^16>` (for `k = 16l`, `l` odd)\n        6.  `<r^32>` (for `k = 32l`, `l` odd)\n        7.  `<r^64>` (for `k = 64l`, `l` odd)\n        8.  `<r^128>` (for `k = 128l`, `l` odd)\n        9.  `<r^256> = {e}` (for `k = 256l`, `l` odd, and for `k` being any multiple of 256).\n\n    *  So we have the subgroups `G`, `<r^2>`, `<r^4>`, `<r^8>`, `<r^16>`, `<r^32>`, `<r^64>`, `<r^128>`, `{e}`.\n    * Let's check `{e}`. Can we get the trivial subgroup for some k? `G^k = {e}`.\n        * We need `(r^i)^k = e` and `(sr^i)^k = e` for all `i`.\n        * `(r^i)^k = r^(ik)`. This is `e` for all `i` if `k` is a multiple of 256. Let `k = 256`.\n        * `G^256 = < <r^256>, <r^(64*256)> > = < {e}, {e} > = {e}`.\n        * So the trivial subgroup `{e}` is indeed a power subgroup.\n\n    *  So, the distinct power subgroups are:\n        1.  G (SD(512))\n        2.  The cyclic subgroup `<r^2>` of order 128.\n        3.  The cyclic subgroup `<r^4>` of order 64.\n        4.  The cyclic subgroup `<r^8>` of order 32.\n        5.  The cyclic subgroup `<r^16>` of order 16.\n        6.  The cyclic subgroup `<r^32>` of order 8.\n        7.  The cyclic subgroup `<r^64>` of order 4.\n        8.  The cyclic subgroup `<r^128>` of order 2.\n        9.  The trivial subgroup `{e}`.\n\n    *   This gives a total of 9 distinct power subgroups.\n\n    *   Double check the reasoning.\n        *   `G = SD(2^n)`, with `n=9`.\n        *   `G = <r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2)-1)>`.\n        *   `G^k = < g^k | g in G >`.\n        *   If `k` is odd: `g_1 = (r^i)^k = r^(ik)`. Generates `<r^d>` where `d = gcd(k, 2^(n-1))`. Since k is odd, `d=1`. So they generate `<r>`. `g_2 = (sr^i)^k = s * r^(something)`. So `s` is in `G^k`. Thus, for odd k, `G^k = <r, s> = G`.\n        *   If `k` is even, `k=2m`.\n            *   `(r^i)^k = r^(ik)`. These generate `<r^d>` where `d = gcd(k, 2^(n-1))`.\n            *   `(sr^i)^k = ((sr^i)^2)^m = (r^(i * (2^(n-2)+1 -1)))^m = (r^(i * 2^(n-2)))^m`. Whoops, `srs = r^(j)` where `j = 2^(n-2)-1`. So `s r^i s = r^(i*j)`. And `(sr^i)^2 = sr^i s r^i = r^(ij) r^i = r^(i(j+1))`. Here `j+1 = 2^(n-2)`. So `(sr^i)^2 = r^(i * 2^(n-2))`.\n            *   My calculation `(sr^i)^2 = r^(i*128)` for n=9 was correct.\n            *   So, `(sr^i)^k = (r^(i * 2^(n-2)))^m = r^(im * 2^(n-2)) = r^(i * k/2 * 2^(n-2)) = r^(ik * 2^(n-3))`. For n=9, this is `r^(ik * 2^6) = r^(64ik)`. Correct.\n            *   So `G^k = < <r^d>, <r^(k * 2^(n-3))> >` where `d=gcd(k, 2^(n-1))`.\n            *   Let `k = 2^a * l` where `l` is odd, `a >= 1`.\n            *   `d = gcd(2^a * l, 2^(n-1)) = 2^a` (assuming `a < n-1`).\n            *   `G^k = < <r^(2^a)>, <r^(2^a * l * 2^(n-3))> > = < <r^(2^a)>, <r^(l * 2^(a+n-3))> >`.\n            *   The order of `r` is `2^(n-1)`.\n            *   The subgroup `<r^(2^a)>` is of order `2^(n-1-a)`.\n            *   The other generator is `r^(l * 2^(a+n-3))`. The subgroup it generates is `<r^(2^(a+n-3))>`.\n            *   We are comparing `<r^(2^a)>` with `<r^(2^(a+n-3))>`.\n            *   If `a+n-3 >= a`, which is true for `n>=3`, then `<r^(2^(a+n-3))>` is a subgroup of `<r^(2^a)>`.\n            *   So, `G^k = <r^(2^a)>`.\n            *   Here `n=9`. `k = 2^a * l`. `d=gcd(k, 256)=2^a` for `a < 8`.\n            *   `G^k = <r^(2^a)>`.\n            *   The possible values for `a` are `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8`.\n            *   `a=1`: `G^k = <r^2>`.\n            *   `a=2`: `G^k = <r^4>`.\n            *   `a=3`: `G^k = <r^8>`.\n            *   `a=4`: `G^k = <r^16>`.\n            *   `a=5`: `G^k = <r^32>`.\n            *   `a=6`: `G^k = <r^64>`.\n            *   `a=7`: `G^k = <r^128>`.\n            *   `a=8`: `k=256l`. `d = gcd(256l, 256) = 256`.

The logic is sound.\nFinal check on the list of power subgroups:\n- `P_1 = G^{2k+1} = G = SD_{512}`\n- `P_2 = G^{2(2k+1)} = \\langle r^2 \\rangle \\cong C_{128}`\n- `P_3 = G^{4(2k+1)} = \\langle r^4 \\rangle \\cong C_{64}`\n- `P_4 = G^{8(2k+1)} = \\langle r^8 \\rangle \\cong C_{32}`\n- `P_5 = G^{16(2k+1)} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle \\cong C_{16}`\n- `P_6 = G^{32(2k+1)} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle \\cong C_{8}`\n- `P_7 = G^{64(2k+1)} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle \\cong C_{4}`\n- `P_8 = G^{128(2k+1)} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle \\cong C_{2}`\n- `P_9 = G^{256(2k+1)} = G^{256} = \\{e\\}`\nThis makes a total of 9 distinct power subgroups. The logic holds up.The user is asking for the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512. My initial plan was to determine this by analyzing the group structure and the definition of a power subgroup. My analysis led to the conclusion that there are 9 such subgroups. The additional searches did not contradict this finding but provided more context on the properties of semidihedral groups, such as their Frattini subgroups and subgroup structures in general. The initial plan seems sound and complete.\n\nThe semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD(512), has the presentation:\nSD(512) = `<r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(128-1) = r^127>`\n\nThe elements of SD(512) are of the form `r^i` for 0 ≤ i < 256 and `sr^i` for 0 ≤ i < 256.\n\nA power subgroup G^k is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements of G.\n\n1.  **For any odd integer k:** The subgroup generated by `(r^i)^k` is `<r^d>` where `d = gcd(k, 256)`. Since k is odd, `d=1`, so these generate `<r>`. The k-th power of `s` is `s^k = s` (since k is odd). Therefore, for any odd `k`, the power subgroup `G^k` contains both `r` and `s`, which generate the entire group G. So, `G^k = G`. This gives us **one** power subgroup.\n\n2.  **For any even integer k:** Let `k = 2^a * m` where `m` is an odd integer and `a >= 1`.\n    *   The elements `(r^i)^k` generate the subgroup `<r^(gcd(k, 256))> = <r^(2^a)>`.\n    *   The elements `(sr^i)^k` are `((sr^i)^2)^(k/2) = (r^(128i))^(k/2) = r^(64ik)`. These elements generate the subgroup `<r^(64k)> = <r^(64 * 2^a * m)> = <r^(m * 2^(a+6))>`. Since `m` is odd, this is the subgroup `<r^(2^(a+6))>`.\n    *   Thus, for an even `k = 2^a * m`, the power subgroup is `G^k = <<r^(2^a)>, <r^(2^(a+6))>>`.\n    *   Since `a+6 >= a`, the subgroup `<r^(2^(a+6))>` is contained within `<r^(2^a)>`.\n    *   Therefore, `G^k = <r^(2^a)>`.\n\nNow we find the number of distinct subgroups by considering the possible values of `a`:\n*   `a = 1`: `k = 2m` (e.g., 2, 6, 10,...). `G^k = <r^2>`. (1 subgroup)\n*   `a = 2`: `k = 4m` (e.g., 4, 12, 20,...). `G^k = <r^4>`. (1 subgroup)\n*   `a = 3`: `k = 8m`. `G^k = <r^8>`. (1 subgroup)\n*   `a = 4`: `k = 16m`. `G^k = <r^16>`.

This results in the following 8 distinct subgroups:\n    *   The cyclic subgroup ⟨r<sup>2</sup>⟩ of order 128.\n    *   The cyclic subgroup ⟨r<sup>4</sup>⟩ of order 64.\n    *   The cyclic subgroup ⟨r<sup>8</sup>⟩ of order 32.\n    *   The cyclic subgroup ⟨r<sup>16</sup>⟩ of order 16.\n    *   The cyclic subgroup ⟨r<sup>32</sup>⟩ of order 8.\n    *   The cyclic subgroup ⟨r<sup>64</sup>⟩ of order 4.\n    *   The cyclic subgroup ⟨r<sup>128</sup>⟩ of order 2.\n    *   The trivial subgroup {e} (the identity element).\n\nCounting these possibilities, we have one subgroup from the odd powers and eight distinct subgroups from the even powers, leading to a total of 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
