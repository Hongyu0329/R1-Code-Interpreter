    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. For an E2 reaction to occur in a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (bromine) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon must be in a trans-diaxial (anti-periplanar) orientation.\n\nThe starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a trans isomer. To undergo the E2 reaction, the molecule must be in a chair conformation where the bromine atom is in an axial position. In this conformation, the methyl group on the adjacent carbon is also forced into an axial position to maintain the trans relationship.\n\nLet's consider the two possible elimination pathways:\n\n1.  **Zaitsev Elimination:** This would involve the removal of a hydrogen atom from carbon 2 (the carbon with the methyl group) to form the more substituted alkene, 1-methylcyclohexene. However, in the required chair conformation with an axial bromine, the hydrogen on carbon 2 is in an equatorial position. Since it is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, this elimination cannot occur.\n\n2.  **Hofmann Elimination:** This involves the removal of a hydrogen atom from carbon 6. In the chair conformation with the axial bromine, there is an axial hydrogen on carbon 6 which is anti-periplanar to the bromine. The bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, can abstract this proton, leading to the formation of a double bond between carbons 1 and 6.\n\nDue to the stereochemical requirements of the E2 reaction, only the Hofmann-type elimination is possible. Furthermore, the use of a bulky base like potassium tert-butoxide sterically favors the removal of the less hindered proton, which also leads to the Hofmann product.\n\nTherefore, the major product of the reaction is the less substituted alkene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
