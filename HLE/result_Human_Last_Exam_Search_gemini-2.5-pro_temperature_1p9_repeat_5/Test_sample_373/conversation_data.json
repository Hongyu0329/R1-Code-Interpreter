    "A barbell graph with 10 nodes is typically constructed by taking two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (K5) and connecting them with a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the bottleneck edge.\n\nIn randomized uniform gossiping, the sampling process involves two steps:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from the set of all nodes in the graph.\n2.  One of its incident edges is then selected uniformly at random.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge with this process.\n\n*   **Graph Structure**: The graph has a total of N=10 nodes. It consists of two K5 cliques and one bridge edge connecting them.\n*   **Node Degrees**:\n    *   In a complete graph with 5 nodes (K5), each node is connected to the other 4 nodes.\n    *   Consider a node at one end of the bottleneck edge. It is connected to 4 other nodes within its own K5 clique and to 1 node in the other clique via the bottleneck edge. Therefore, its total degree is 4 + 1 = 5.\n    *   Let the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge be `u` and `v`. Both `u` and `v` have a degree of 5.\n*   **Total Edges (for context, not direct use in this probability calculation)**:\n    *   Each K5 has (5 * 4) / 2 = 10 edges.\n    *   Total edges = 10 (in the first K5) + 10 (in the second K5) + 1 (bottleneck edge) = 21 edges.\n\n**Calculating the Probability:**\n\nThe probability of sampling a specific edge `e = (u,v)` is the sum of the probabilities of two mutually exclusive events:\n1.  Selecting node `u` and then choosing the edge `(u,v)`.\n2.  Selecting node `v` and then choosing the edge `(v,u)`.\n\nThe probability of selecting any specific node is `1/N = 1/10`.\n\nThe probability of selecting the bottleneck edge, given that one of its endpoint nodes (`u` or `v`) has been chosen, is `1/degree`. Since both endpoint nodes have a degree of 5, this probability is 1/5 for each.\n\nSo, the calculation is as follows:\n\n*   P(sampling bottleneck) = P(selecting `u`) * P(choosing bottleneck | `u`) + P(selecting `v`) * P(choosing bottleneck | `v`)\n*   P(sampling bottleneck) = (1/10) * (1/5) + (1/10) * (1/5)\n*   P(sampling bottleneck) = 1/50 + 1/50\n*   P(sampling bottleneck) = 2/50 = 1/25\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal, the probability is 0.04.\n\n<<<0.04>>>"
