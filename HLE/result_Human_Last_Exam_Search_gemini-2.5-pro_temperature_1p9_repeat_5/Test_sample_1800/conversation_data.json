    "Determining the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for maximizing the catalytic performance of Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is crucial for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS). The optimal ratio is not universal and varies significantly between the two applications due to their different reaction mechanisms.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which converts carbon monoxide and water to carbon dioxide and hydrogen, the ideal nickel content is generally in the lower percentage range. Research indicates that a nickel proportion of around **7% molar** is optimal in La-doped Ceria catalysts. Studies have shown that catalysts with this Ni loading exhibit excellent activity and stability, achieving high CO conversion rates. While higher nickel loadings of up to 10% molar can result in similar performance, concentrations around 7% are presented as the optimized amount. Other research has also demonstrated high catalytic activity for Ni/CeO2 catalysts with nickel content ranging from **5 to 12.5 wt%** in a temperature range of 300–450 °C. For instance, a 5% Ni/CeO2 catalyst showed high carbon monoxide conversion at 350 °C. In another study comparing different metal-ceria catalysts, a 40% Ni-ceria catalyst was found to be more active than a 40% Fe-ceria catalyst below 300°C.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn the context of water splitting, particularly the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a key step in the process, a significantly higher nickel content is beneficial. Studies on a series of Ni-Ceria electrocatalysts (NiyCe100−yOx) have shown that catalysts with a composition of **Ni50Ce50Ox and Ni75Ce25Ox** exhibit the highest OER activities. This enhanced performance is attributed to a larger concentration of oxygen vacancies in the catalyst structure, which are crucial for the OER process. Notably, the **Ni75Ce25Ox** catalyst also demonstrated excellent long-term stability, maintaining its performance for over 100 hours.\n\nIn summary, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is highly dependent on the specific catalytic application:\n*   For the **Water Gas Shift reaction**, a lower Ni content, typically around **5-10 mol%**, is favored to maximize performance.\n*   For **water splitting**, a much higher Ni content in the range of **50-75 mol%** is ideal for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is approximately 5-10 mol% for the Water Gas Shift reaction and 50-75 mol% for water splitting.>>>"
