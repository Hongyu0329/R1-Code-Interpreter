    "The symmetry point group of the molecule bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper depends on the oxidation state of the copper atom. The molecule can exist with copper in a +1 or +2 oxidation state, and each has a different molecular geometry and corresponding point group.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)**\n\nThe bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) complex, specifically as the bis(tetrafluoroborate) salt, has been studied by X-ray crystallography. These studies have determined that the coordination geometry around the copper(II) ion is a distorted octahedron. In this structure, the copper ion is coordinated to the four sulfur atoms of the two dithiahexane ligands in the equatorial positions, and to two fluoride ions from the tetrafluoroborate counter-ions in the axial positions. The crystal structure of this complex is monoclinic and belongs to the space group *P*2_1/*c*, with two formula units per unit cell (Z=2). Since this space group possesses inversion centers and there are two molecules in the unit cell, the molecule itself must occupy a crystallographic center of inversion. Therefore, the molecule possesses an inversion center, and its point group is **C_i**.\n\n**Bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)**\n\nFor the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) complex, the geometry is different. While crystals of the simple tetrafluoroborate salt were found to be twinned, related studies of copper(I) complexes with similar thioether ligands indicate a distorted tetrahedral geometry. For example, bis(3,6-dithiaoctane)copper(I) tetrafluoroborate has a distorted tetrahedral geometry. Similarly, a copper(I) complex with a modified 2,5-dithiahexane ligand also exhibits tetrahedral coordination. Another related complex, chloro(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I), is polymeric but features a distorted tetrahedral geometry around each copper atom.\n\nIn an idealized tetrahedral (T_d) geometry for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I), the copper atom would be at the center of the tetrahedron, and the two bidentate dithiahexane ligands would each coordinate through their two sulfur atoms. However, due to the structure of the ligands, a perfect T_d symmetry is unlikely. The puckering of the chelate rings and the arrangement of the ethyl groups would lower the symmetry. A likely point group for a distorted tetrahedral complex of this type would be **C_2**, which contains a single two-fold rotation axis passing through the copper atom and bisecting the angle between the two ligands. Further distortions could potentially lower the symmetry to C_1.\n\nIn summary:\n*   The point group for **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II)** (with coordinating anions) is **C_i**.\n*   The point group for **bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)** is likely **C_2**, assuming a common distorted tetrahedral geometry, although further distortions could lower it to C_1.\n\nWithout specification of the oxidation state, the most definitive answer from crystallographic data points to the C_i point group for the well-characterized copper(II) complex.\n\n<<<C_i for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) and likely C_2 for bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I)>>>"
