    "In the ϕ^4 theory near four dimensions, the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling, denoted as u*, is determined through the epsilon expansion, where ϵ = 4 - d and d is the spacetime dimension. The fixed point is found by calculating the renormalization group beta function for the coupling constant and finding the value of the coupling for which the beta function is zero.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling g in the O(N)-symmetric ϕ^4 theory (where N=1 corresponds to the single-component theory) is given by:\nβ(g) = -ϵg + (N+8)/(8π^2) * g^2\n\nTo find the fixed point g*, we set β(g*) = 0, which yields:\ng* = (8π^2 * ϵ) / (N+8)\n\nFor the specific case of the ϕ^4 theory with a single scalar field, we set N=1. The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* (using the notation u* for g* in the N=1 case) is therefore:\nu* = (8π^2 / 9) * ϵ\n\nIt is important to note that the precise numerical factor in this expression depends on the conventions used for defining the coupling constant in the Lagrangian. Different conventions can absorb factors of π and other numerical constants. For instance, in some conventions, the fixed point is expressed as u* = (2/3)ϵ. However, the crucial result is that the fixed point coupling is of the order of ϵ.\n\n<<<u* = (8π^2 / 9) * ϵ>>>"
