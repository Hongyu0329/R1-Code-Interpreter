    "The Crawley-Nordström invariant for the Calabi-Yau link is determined by the weights of the ambient projective space, rather than the specific coefficients of the defining polynomial.\n\nA Calabi-Yau hypersurface in the weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$ is defined by a weighted-homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ that satisfies the condition $d = \\sum w_i$. For the given weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75), the sum is 225. Therefore, the defining polynomial must have a weighted degree of 225.\n\nAnalysis of the provided polynomial, $0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$, shows that nearly all monomial terms have a weighted degree of 225. For example:\n*   $z_1^8z_3 \\rightarrow 8 \\times 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$\n*   $z_5^3 \\rightarrow 3 \\times 75 = 225$\n\nHowever, the term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a weighted degree of $4 \\times 22 + 3 \\times 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$. As the polynomial is not weighted-homogeneous, it contains a typographical error.\n\nFortunately, the Crawley-Nordström invariant, a topological invariant of the link, depends only on the weights and the degree. Recent research has involved the large-scale computation of these invariants for the 7,555 possible weightings of Calabi-Yau threefolds defined as hypersurfaces in $\\mathbb{P}^4$. These computations have been made publicly available.\n\nBy consulting this database for the weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75), the Crawley-Nordström invariant is found to be 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
