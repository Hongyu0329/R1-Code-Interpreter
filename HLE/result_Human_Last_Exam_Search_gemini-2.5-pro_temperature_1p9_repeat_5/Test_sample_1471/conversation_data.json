    "To solve the equation, first, the Roman numerals must be converted into modern numbers.\n\n*   `xl` is 40\n*   `cxii` is 112\n*   `mmmcmxciii` is 3993\n\nThe equation in modern numbers is:\n40 / 112 - 3993\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n40 divided by 112 equals approximately 0.357142857.\nThen, subtracting 3993 from that result gives -3992.64285714.\n\n-3992.64285714\n<<<**-3992.64285714**>>>"
