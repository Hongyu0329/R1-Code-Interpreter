    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the Pauli exclusion principle is maintained through the use of Grassmann variables, which are anti-commuting numbers. The value of the integral measure for a single Grassmann variable `ψ` is defined by the following rules, known as Berezin integration:\n\n*   ∫ dψ = 0\n*   ∫ dψ ψ = 1\n\nThese definitions are crucial for ensuring that the fermionic path integral adheres to the Pauli exclusion principle. The principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. This is naturally encoded in the properties of Grassmann variables, where the square of any Grassmann variable is zero (ψ² = 0) due to their anti-commuting nature (ψiψj = -ψjψi).\n\nWhen constructing a path integral for fermions, one integrates over all possible configurations of these Grassmann-valued fields. The integration measure, defined by the rules above, ensures that any term in the expansion of the action that would correspond to two fermions in the same state (which would involve a ψ²) will vanish upon integration. This directly enforces the Pauli exclusion principle at the level of the path integral.\n\n<<<∫ dψ = 0 and ∫ dψ ψ = 1>>>"
