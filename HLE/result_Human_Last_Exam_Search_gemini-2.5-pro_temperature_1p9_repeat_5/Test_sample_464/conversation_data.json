    "Yes, it follows that $f = 0$. Here is the reasoning:\n\nLet $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Schwartz class function. This means that $f$ is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) and, along with all its derivatives, decays faster than any inverse power of $x$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe condition is that all the moments of $f$ are zero:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\} $$\n\nConsider the Fourier transform of $f$, denoted by $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\nA fundamental property of Schwartz functions is that the Fourier transform maps the Schwartz space to itself. Thus, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is also a Schwartz function and is infinitely differentiable.\n\nLet's compute the derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$. The $k$-th derivative is given by:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi) = \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, dx $$\nThis is valid because the rapid decay of $f(x)$ allows for differentiation under the integral sign.\n\nNow, let's evaluate these derivatives at the origin ($\\xi = 0$):\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k \\, dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx $$\nUsing the given condition that all moments of $f$ are zero, we find:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\} $$\nThis shows that the Fourier transform of $f$ and all of its derivatives are zero at the origin.\n\nSince $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is a smooth function (in fact, it is analytic), we can consider its Taylor series expansion around $\\xi = 0$:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k $$\nAll the coefficients of this series are zero. Because the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is an analytic function, and all its derivatives at a single point are zero, the function must be identically zero over its entire domain. Therefore, we have:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } \\xi \\in \\mathbb{R} $$\nFinally, due to the uniqueness of the Fourier transform on the Schwartz space, if the transform of a function is the zero function, the original function must also be the zero function. This can be seen from the inverse Fourier transform:\n$$ f(x) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} 0 \\cdot e^{2\\pi i x \\xi} \\, d\\xi = 0 $$\nThus, $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nIt's important to note that the condition of being a Schwartz function is crucial. There exist non-zero functions that are not Schwartz functions for which all moments are zero.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
