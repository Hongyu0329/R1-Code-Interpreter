    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that transforms a qudit density matrix is $d^3$, where $d$ is the dimension of the qudit system.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel and its Rank**: A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) can be expressed as:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$\n    where $\\{U_k\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices), and $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_k \\ge 0$, $\\sum p_k = 1$). The rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix, which is also equal to the minimum number of Kraus operators needed to describe the channel. For a Pauli channel, the Kraus operators can be chosen as $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$. Since the Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}$ are linearly independent, the rank of the channel $\\Lambda$ is equal to the number of non-zero probabilities, $p_k$.\n\n2.  **Maximizing the Rank of a Pauli Channel**: To maximize the rank of $\\Lambda$, we must maximize the number of non-zero coefficients $p_k$. The total number of generalized Pauli operators is $d^2$, so the maximum possible rank for a Pauli channel is $d^2$. This is achieved when all $p_k$ are greater than zero. An example of such a channel is the qudit depolarizing channel for certain parameter ranges, which can be expressed as a Pauli channel with $d^2$ non-zero coefficients.\n\n3.  **Rank of the Complementary Channel**: A Pauli channel is a unital channel, meaning it maps the maximally mixed state to itself ($\\Lambda(I/d) = I/d$). For unital channels, there is a direct relationship between the rank of the channel and the rank of its complementary channel, $\\Lambda^c$. The rank of the complementary channel is given by:\n    $\\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = d \\cdot \\text{rank}(\\Lambda)$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Maximal Rank**: By combining the maximum possible rank of a Pauli channel with the formula for the rank of its complementary channel, we can find the maximal rank.\n    *   Maximum rank of $\\Lambda$: $d^2$\n    *   Maximal rank of $\\Lambda^c$: $d \\cdot (\\text{maximal rank of } \\Lambda) = d \\cdot d^2 = d^3$\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel on a $d$-dimensional qudit is $d^3$.\n\n<<<d^3>>>"
