    "The currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range is fairy bees. This name is widely used in scientific and amateur entomological resources. The genus is also sometimes referred to as mining bees, although this is a broader term that also encompasses the entire family Andrenidae to which *Perdita* belongs.\n\nWhile the common name \"fairy bees\" is well established, the exact year it was coined is not well-documented in the available resources. It appears to be a more modern common name, with one anecdotal source suggesting it may have been popularized as recently as the 21st century through social media, though this is not confirmed. Publications from the mid-20th century by the primary researcher of the genus, P.H. Timberlake, do not appear to use this common name. In contrast, a common name for a specific species within the genus, the Mojave poppy bee (*Perdita meconis*), can be traced to the year of the species' description in 1993.\n\n<<<fairy bees, year not documented>>>"
