    "**Thomas Aquinas** is the Christian theologian who developed the specialized terminology of **obediential potency** (*potentia obedientialis*) to describe changes in the laws of nature, a concept applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the altered state of nature after the Fall.\n\nThomas Aquinas (c. 1225â€“1274), a pivotal figure in scholastic philosophy and theology, sought to reconcile faith and reason. In his theological framework, he addressed the nature of miracles and God's interaction with the created order. To explain events that occur outside the usual course of nature without suggesting that God violates His own established laws, Aquinas developed the concept of \"obediential potency.\"\n\nThis specialized term describes the inherent, passive capacity within every created thing to be acted upon by God in a way that surpasses its natural abilities. It is not a power the creature actively possesses, but rather a \"purely passive\" receptiveness to God's direct intervention. Essentially, by its very nature as a created entity, a creature is \"obedient\" to the will of its Creator and can receive an effect from God that no natural cause could produce.\n\nThis terminology is directly applicable to:\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** Aquinas taught that God miraculously caused the virgin birth. The concept of obediential potency provides the metaphysical framework for understanding how Mary's human nature could be elevated by divine power to conceive and give birth to Christ without the normal biological processes, all while her virginity remained intact. Her body, through its obediential potency, was receptive to a divine action beyond its natural capabilities.\n*   **The Fall:** The consequences of the Fall of Man left human nature in a wounded state. According to Aquinas's framework, human nature after the Fall possesses an obediential potency to be healed and elevated by God's grace. This \"inherent opennesss to revelation and to a relationship with God through grace\" explains how a nature altered by sin can still be a recipient of God's supernatural aid and be restored to a relationship with Him.\n\nWhile Augustine of Hippo laid foundational ideas with his concepts of \"seminal reasons\" (*rationes seminales*) and his assertion that miracles are contrary only to our *knowledge* of nature, it was Thomas Aquinas who refined these ideas into the more precise and systematic terminology of *potentia obedientialis* specifically to explain the creature's capacity to be the subject of miraculous and supernatural divine action.\n\n<<<Thomas Aquinas>>>"
