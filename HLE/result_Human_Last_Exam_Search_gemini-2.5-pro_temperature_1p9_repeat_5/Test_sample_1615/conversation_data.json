    "Let G be a graph with *n* vertices. The chromatic number of G, denoted χ(G), is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of G so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nFor any graph with *n* vertices, the chromatic number is at most *n*. This is because, in the worst case, we can assign a unique color to each vertex. The only graph that requires *n* colors is the complete graph K_n, in which every vertex is connected to every other vertex. In a complete graph, all vertices must be assigned a different color, so χ(K_n) = *n*.\n\nThe problem states that the graph G has 12345 vertices and is not a complete graph. Since G is not a complete graph, it means there exists at least one pair of vertices, say *u* and *v*, that are not connected by an edge. Because *u* and *v* are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color.\n\nThis observation allows us to establish an upper bound on the chromatic number of any non-complete graph. We can color the non-adjacent pair {*u*, *v*} with one color, and then assign a new, unique color to each of the remaining *n* - 2 vertices. This coloring is a proper coloring and uses 1 + (*n* - 2) = *n* - 1 colors. Thus, for any non-complete graph G with *n* vertices, χ(G) ≤ *n* - 1.\n\nFor *n* = 12345, this means the chromatic number is at most 12344.\n\nTo determine if this maximum can be achieved, we can consider a specific graph: the complete graph on 12345 vertices from which one edge has been removed (denoted K_12345 - e).\n*   This graph is not a complete graph by definition.\n*   This graph contains a complete subgraph (a clique) of size 12344 (for instance, by removing one of the two vertices that are no longer connected).\n*   A graph containing a K_k clique requires at least *k* colors. Therefore, the chromatic number of our graph is at least 12344.\n\nSince the chromatic number is at most 12344 and at least 12344, it must be exactly 12344. Thus, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\nThis result is also consistent with Brooks' Theorem, which states that for any connected graph G with maximum degree Δ, the chromatic number is at most Δ, unless G is a complete graph or an odd cycle. For the graph K_12345 - e, the maximum degree Δ is 12344, and Brooks' Theorem implies the chromatic number is at most 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
