    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**.\n\nThe dwarf cuttlefish brain is a complex structure organized into supraesophageal and subesophageal masses, which are further divided into various lobes. The palliovisceral lobe is a part of the palliovisceral lobe complex located in the posterior subesophageal mass. This complex is responsible for the lower motor control of locomotion. Specifically, the palliovisceral lobe controls escape movements and the ejection of ink.\n\nA 3D brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish has been instrumental in visualizing the spatial relationship between different brain lobes. The posterior view of this 3D model clearly shows the positions of the lobes within the posterior subesophageal mass. Based on this atlas and accompanying descriptions, the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes are situated adjacent to the palliovisceral lobe in a posterior orientation.\n\nThe posterior chromatophore lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores and papillae on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass, which are crucial for the cuttlefish's remarkable ability to change its skin color and texture for camouflage and communication. The fin lobes, as their name suggests, control the movement of the fins, which are used for swimming and maneuvering.\n\n<<<The brain regions lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
