    "For a flow cytometry sorting experiment with five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750) using streptavidin beads, you should prepare approximately 14 essential control samples to ensure accurate data and a successful sort.\n\nThese controls can be grouped into four main categories:\n1.  **Instrument Setup and Compensation Controls:** These are fundamental for setting up the instrument correctly and for calculating the compensation matrix to correct for spectral overlap between fluorochromes.\n2.  **Gating Controls:** These are crucial for accurately identifying your population of interest and setting the gates for sorting.\n3.  **Viability Control:** Essential for any cell sorting experiment to ensure only live cells are analyzed and sorted.\n4.  **Streptavidin Bead-Specific Controls:** These are necessary to account for the properties of the beads and the streptavidin-biotin binding system.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n### 1. Instrument Setup & Compensation Controls (7 tubes)\n*   **Unstained Cells (1 control):** This sample contains only your cells without any stains. It is used to determine the baseline autofluorescence of your cell population and to set the initial voltage for the detectors.\n*   **Single-Color Compensation Controls (5 controls):** You need one single-stained control for each fluorochrome in your panel (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750). These samples are used to calculate the spectral spillover of each dye into other channels. For these controls to be effective, they must be at least as bright as your experimental sample. The control for the streptavidin-conjugated fluorochrome should be prepared using the same beads and binding system as your experiment.\n*   **Viability Dye Compensation Control (1 control):** Excluding dead cells is critical as they can bind antibodies non-specifically and exhibit high autofluorescence. Therefore, you need a sample stained only with a viability dye (like DAPI, 7-AAD, or a fixable viability stain). This is required for compensation if the viability dye's fluorescence spills into your detection channels. To get a positive signal for this control, a mix of live and heat-killed cells is often used.\n\n### 2. Gating Controls (5 tubes)\n*   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 controls):** FMO controls are essential in multicolor experiments for accurately setting the boundary between positive and negative populations. An FMO sample is stained with all the fluorochromes in your panel except for one. You will prepare one FMO control for each of the five channels in your experiment. This helps account for the fluorescence spread from all other colors into the channel of interest, which is critical for defining sort gates, especially for dim markers or continuous populations.\n\n### 3. Streptavidin Bead-Specific Controls (2 tubes)\n*   **Beads Alone (1 control):** A sample containing only the streptavidin beads (mixed with unstained cells). This allows you to identify the bead population based on its light scatter properties (FSC/SSC) and to check for any intrinsic fluorescence (autofluorescence) from the beads themselves.\n*   **Non-Specific Binding Control (1 control):** This control is crucial to ensure that the streptavidin-fluorochrome conjugate does not bind non-specifically to your cells. This sample should contain your cells incubated with the fluorescently labeled streptavidin but *without* the biotinylated antibody. An alternative and equally important control is using a biotinylated isotype control antibody to ensure the primary antibody is not the source of non-specific binding.\n\nIn summary, for a robust and well-controlled five-color sorting experiment involving streptavidin beads, the following 14 controls are essential:\n*   1 Unstained cells\n*   5 Single-color compensation controls\n*   1 Viability dye compensation control\n*   5 FMO controls\n*   1 Beads alone control\n*   1 Non-specific streptavidin binding control\n\n<<<14>>>"
