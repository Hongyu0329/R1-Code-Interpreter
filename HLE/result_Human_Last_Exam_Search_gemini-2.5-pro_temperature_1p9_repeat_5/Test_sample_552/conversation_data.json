    "### No Lectures Cited in Einstein's 1905 Brownian Motion Paper\n\nAlbert Einstein did not cite any lectures in his seminal 1905 paper on Brownian motion, \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat). In fact, the paper contains no citations or references at all.\n\nEinstein himself later admitted his lack of awareness of prior experimental work on the topic when he authored the paper. This further explains the absence of citations to earlier scientific works, including any lectures.\n\nWhile the work of other scientists was foundational to the concepts Einstein explored, such as the kinetic theory of gases developed by physicists like Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs, these were not explicitly cited in the 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\nInterestingly, a subsequent related paper by Einstein, published in 1906, does include a citation to Gustav Kirchhoff's \"Lectures on Mechanics.\" However, the 1905 paper, which is one of the Annus Mirabilis (miracle year) papers, stands on its own without formal attribution to other works."
