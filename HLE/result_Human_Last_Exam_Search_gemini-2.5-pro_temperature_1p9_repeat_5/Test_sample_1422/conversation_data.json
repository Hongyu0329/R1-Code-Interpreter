    "An interacting scalar field theory describes a scalar field with self-interactions. The nature of these interactions is defined by the potential term in the Lagrangian, such as λφ³/3! or λφ⁴/4!. The topology of Feynman diagrams, including the number of vertices, depends on this interaction term.\n\nTo determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop diagram, we can analyze the relationship between the number of loops (L), internal lines (I), vertices (V), and external lines (E). For a connected Feynman diagram, the number of loops is given by:\n\nL = I - V + 1\n\nFurthermore, the total number of lines connected to vertices depends on the type of interaction. For a φⁿ interaction, each vertex will have n lines.\n\nThe minimum number of vertices is achieved in a theory with a φ⁴ interaction. In this case, it is possible to construct a two-loop diagram with just **two vertices**. A prominent example of such a diagram is the \"sunset diagram,\" which is a two-loop correction to the two-point function (a self-energy diagram). This diagram consists of two vertices connected by three internal propagators.\n\nAnother example from φ⁴ theory is a two-loop vacuum diagram (a diagram with no external lines), often called the \"double-scoop\" or \"figure-eight\" diagram. This diagram also has two vertices.\n\nFor a theory with a φ³ interaction, a two-loop self-energy diagram requires a minimum of four vertices. However, a two-loop vacuum diagram in a φ³ theory can be constructed with two vertices.\n\nConsidering all common types of interacting scalar field theories, the absolute minimum number of vertices required to form a two-loop Feynman diagram is two.\n\n<<<2>>>"
