    "An American in Paris*, the 1951 Academy Award winner for Best Picture, was the first film to hold that honor to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen. The film features a lavish 17-minute ballet sequence that serves as its climax. This imaginative and artistic sequence showcases a dream-like tour of Paris with sets inspired by the works of famous French painters.\n\nOne of the key scenes within this ballet is set in a vibrant, stylized recreation of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, which is the location of one of the two Luxor Obelisks. The set for the film was designed in the artistic style of French Fauvist painter Raoul Dufy. While the movie was predominantly filmed on MGM studio backlots in Hollywood, a model of the fountain at the Place de la Concorde was used in the production planning, and a full-scale studio set was built for the iconic ballet sequence.\n\nEarlier Best Picture winners set in Paris, such as *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), recreated other parts of the city on studio sets but did not feature the Place de la Concorde. Later winners, like *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) and *Gigi* (1958), were also partially filmed in Paris, but there is no evidence they were the first to show the famous obelisk. Therefore, the depiction of the Place de la Concorde in *An American in Paris*, even as a studio recreation, marks its first appearance in a Best Picture-winning film.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
