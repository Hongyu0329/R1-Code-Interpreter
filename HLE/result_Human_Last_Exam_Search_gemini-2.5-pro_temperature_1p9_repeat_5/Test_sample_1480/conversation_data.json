    "The search results confirm my initial interpretation. Let's break it down:\n\n*   **Rule Structure:** A fuzzy rule has an antecedent (IF part) and a consequent (THEN part).\n*   **Firing Strength/Level (Antecedent):** The first step in a fuzzy inference process is to calculate the \"firing strength\" (also called firing level or activation level) of each rule. This is done by taking the input values (facts) and determining the degree to which they match the antecedent of the rule. If the antecedent has multiple parts (e.g., `IF temperature is high AND humidity is high`), a t-norm operator is used to combine the membership values of the inputs in their respective fuzzy sets. The value `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` represents this firing strength for the k-th rule.\n*   **Implication (Activating the Consequent):** The firing strength then modifies the fuzzy set in the consequent of the rule. This process is often called implication. The result is an \"activated\" or \"resulting\" fuzzy set for that rule.\n*   **Calculation:** The calculation for the membership grade of any value in this newly activated consequent set is typically done by applying a t-norm to the rule's firing strength and the original membership grade in the consequent fuzzy set. A paper on interval type-3 fuzzy systems states, \"The level of activation of the rule is the membership μ B j k ( y j | x ′ ) resulting from the operation ⨅ of the firing strength Φ ˜ k ( x ′ ) and the membership of the consequent of the rule μ G j k ( y j )\". Here, ⨅ represents a t-norm operation.\n\nTherefore, the user's question is asking for the result of this implication step at a specific point `y_j`.\n\nGiven values:\n*   Firing strength of the rule (from the antecedent): `Φ_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   Membership grade in the original consequent fuzzy set: `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\nThe task is to combine these using a t-norm operation. A t-norm, or triangular norm, is a function that generalizes the logical AND operation in fuzzy logic. Since no specific t-norm is mentioned, I will provide the result for the two most common ones:\n\n1.  **Minimum (Gödel) t-norm:** `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n2.  **Product t-norm:** `T(a, b) = a * b`\n\n**Calculations:**\n1.  **Using Minimum t-norm:** `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n2.  **Using Product t-norm:** `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nThe question \"what is the rule activation level\" is slightly ambiguous. It can refer to the firing strength of the antecedent itself (which is given as 0.7), or it can refer to the result of the implication process, which modifies the consequent. Based on the fact that two values and a \"t-norm operation\" are provided, the second interpretation is the most logical. It's asking for the membership grade of the output after the rule's firing strength has been applied to the consequent.\n\nThe final answer will provide both results as the specific t-norm was not provided.\n\nThe \"interval type-3\" aspect adds complexity to the overall fuzzy system (by introducing higher levels of uncertainty handling), but the fundamental operation at this specific level of the inference process (combining a scalar firing strength with a scalar membership grade via a t-norm) remains the same. The given values are scalars, so the calculation is straightforward. The complex nature of IT3 fuzzy sets primarily affects how the firing strength `Φ` and the consequent membership `μG` would be determined in the first place (they would likely be derived from more complex, interval-valued or type-2-valued functions through processes like type-reduction). However, since those final scalar values are given, the operation itself is direct.\n\nI am ready to provide the final answer.\nThe \"rule activation level\" can sometimes refer to the firing strength of the antecedent, but in the context of the provided information, it more accurately describes the result of the fuzzy implication, which is the process of applying the antecedent's firing strength to the consequent's membership function.\n\nGiven:\n*   The firing strength of the antecedent of the k-th rule, `Φ_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n*   The membership grade of a specific value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k` of that same rule, `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nThe task is to find the resulting membership grade for `y_j` after the rule is activated, using a t-norm operation. A t-norm is a function that generalizes the logical AND operation for fuzzy logic. Since the problem does not specify which t-norm to use, the result is calculated using the two most common t-norms: the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm.\n\n1.  **Using the Minimum t-norm**: This is one of the most widely used t-norms and is defined as `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`.\n    *   Calculation: `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n2.  **Using the Product t-norm**: Another common t-norm, defined as `T(a, b) = a * b`.\n    *   Calculation: `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level, interpreted as the result of the fuzzy implication for the given values, depends on the chosen t-norm.\n\n<<<The rule activation level, representing the result of the implication step, is **0.7** if using the minimum t-norm, and **0.63** if using the product t-norm.>>>"
