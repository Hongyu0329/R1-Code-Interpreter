The pharmacist's primary counseling recommendation should be to inform Allison about the potential for her headaches to be a side effect of Junel Fe and/or Fluoxetine. Additionally, the pharmacist should warn her about the increased risk of bleeding from the combined use of Fluoxetine and the aspirin in Excedrin. It would also be important to mention the interaction between Atorvastatin and Junel Fe, which could increase the side effects of the birth control pill. She should be advised to monitor for and report any unusual symptoms to her doctor.
