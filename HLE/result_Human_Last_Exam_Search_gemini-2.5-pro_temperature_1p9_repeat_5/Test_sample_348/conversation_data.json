    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\n**1. Finding Market Equilibrium:**\n\nWe set the supply price equal to the demand price to find the equilibrium quantity (Qe):\nln(Q_S^3 - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))\n\nBy setting Q_S = Q_D = Q_e, we get:\nln(Q_e^3 - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_e))\n\nSolving this equation for Q_e requires numerical methods. Using a computational solver, we find that the equilibrium quantity is approximately:\nQ_e ≈ 4.756\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium price (Pe) by substituting Q_e into either the supply or demand function. Using the supply function:\nP_e = ln((4.756)^3 - 2) ≈ ln(107.78 - 2) = ln(105.78) ≈ 4.661\n\n**2. Calculating Total Welfare:**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS).\n\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** This is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price, from a quantity of 0 to Q_e. It is calculated by the definite integral of the demand function minus the equilibrium price multiplied by the equilibrium quantity:\n    CS = ∫[0 to 4.756] 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ - (4.661 * 4.756)\n\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** This is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price, from a quantity of 0 to Q_e. It is calculated as the equilibrium price multiplied by the equilibrium quantity minus the definite integral of the supply function:\n    PS = (4.661 * 4.756) - ∫[sqrt(3)(2) to 4.756] ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ\n    *(Note: The lower bound for the producer surplus integral is the quantity where the supply price is zero, which is the cube root of 3)*\n\nCalculating these integrals numerically:\n∫[0 to 4.756] 18e^(-arctan(Q)) dQ ≈ 38.649\n∫[sqrt(3)(2) to 4.756] ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ ≈ 12.016\n\nNow, we can calculate the surpluses:\nCS ≈ 38.649 - (4.661 * 4.756) ≈ 38.649 - 22.164 ≈ 16.485\nPS ≈ (4.661 * 4.756) - 12.016 ≈ 22.164 - 12.016 ≈ 10.148\n\nThe total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus:\nTotal Welfare = CS + PS ≈ 16.485 + 10.148 ≈ 26.633\n\nThus, the total welfare at the market equilibrium is approximately 26.633.\n\n<<<26.633>>>"
