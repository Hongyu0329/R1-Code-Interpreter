    "Adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) have been documented consuming two main types of food: soft-bodied arthropods and pollen/nectar. They are considered important predators of pests like aphids and mites.\n\nMultiple sources confirm that the diet of adult snakeflies includes:\n*   **Aphids and other small insects**: Adult snakeflies are described as carnivorous and predaceous, with a distinct preference for aphids and other soft-bodied prey.\n*   **Pollen, Nectar, and Honeydew**: Pollen has been repeatedly found in the guts of adult snakeflies. Some species are known to feed on nectar, pollen, or honeydew, while others feed on sugary substances.\n\nSnakeflies are not known to feed on fungus or leaf tissue. Furthermore, Raphidiopterans are not naturally found in the Southern Hemisphere. An attempt was made in the early 20th century to introduce a North American species to New Zealand for pest control, but the species failed to establish a population. Therefore, they would not have been recorded feeding on endemic New Zealand flora and fauna like Māhoe pollen, Karamū leaf tissue, or Totara aphids in a natural setting.\n\nBased on the evidence, adult Raphidiopterans have been recorded feeding on aphids (represented by option E) and nectar/pollen (represented by option A).\n\n<<<F>>>"
