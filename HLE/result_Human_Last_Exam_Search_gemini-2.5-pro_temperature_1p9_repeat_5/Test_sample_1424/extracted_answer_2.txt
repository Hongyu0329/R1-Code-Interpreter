In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (or energy) variable and the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ. Specifically, in frequency-momentum space, the functional dependence is of the form G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ), where the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ represent the poles of the function.
