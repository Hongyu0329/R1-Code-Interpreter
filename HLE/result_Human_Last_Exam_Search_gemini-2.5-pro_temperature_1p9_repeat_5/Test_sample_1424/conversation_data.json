    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, exhibits a direct and fundamental functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ. This relationship is most clearly seen in the energy-momentum representation of the Green's function.\n\nThe bare Green's function describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Within the path integral formulation, it is calculated by considering all possible paths of a single particle, weighted by the action of that particle. The result of this calculation, particularly for the time-ordered Green's function in frequency-momentum space, reveals its functional form.\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function, G₀(k, ω), on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ, is that of a simple pole structure. For a given momentum k and frequency ω, the expression for the bare Green's function is typically of the form:\n\n***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ)***\n\nHere, `iδ` is an infinitesimally small positive quantity that ensures the correct time-ordering and causality, dictating how the poles are treated in the complex frequency plane. The physical significance of this relationship is that the poles of the bare Green's function directly correspond to the energies of the single-particle excitations of the system. In other words, the system can readily absorb or emit energy corresponding to these eigenvalues.\n\nFor a system of fermions, it is common to measure energies relative to the chemical potential, μ. In this case, the single-particle energy is often expressed as ξₖ = ϵₖ - μ. The bare Green's function then takes the form:\n\n***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ξₖ + iδ sign(ξₖ))***\n\nThis expression explicitly shows the poles located at the single-particle energy levels relative to the chemical potential.\n\nIn summary, the path integral formalism provides a powerful method for calculating the Green's function, and the resulting bare Green's function, G₀, is functionally dependent on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ, through an inverse relationship where the eigenvalues define the locations of the poles in the complex frequency plane.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function G₀ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (or energy) variable and the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ. Specifically, in frequency-momentum space, the functional dependence is of the form G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵₖ + iδ), where the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₖ represent the poles of the function.>>>"
