    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they form a single composite system. The Chern number of this resulting junction is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual components.\n\nThe reasoning for this is based on the fundamental properties of Chern insulators:\n\n*   **Additivity of Hall Conductance:** The Chern number (C) of a two-dimensional system is directly proportional to its Hall conductance (σ_H), according to the relationship σ_H = C * (e²/h), where 'e' is the elementary charge and 'h' is Planck's constant. When two systems are connected laterally (in parallel), their conductances add up. Therefore, the total Hall conductance of the junction will be the sum of the individual Hall conductances, which implies the total Chern number is also the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n*   **Topological Invariant of a Composite System:** In topology, the Chern number is an additive invariant for direct sums of systems. A lateral junction with negligible interaction between the two insulators can be treated as a direct sum of the two systems.\n\n*   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** A system with a Chern number of C will have |C| conducting edge states on its boundary. For the composite system of two C=1 insulators, there will be a total of two chiral edge modes propagating along the outer boundary of the junction, which corresponds to a total Chern number of 2.\n\nTherefore, for the given scenario, the Chern number of the junction is:\n\nC_total = C₁ + C₂ = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n<<<2>>>"
