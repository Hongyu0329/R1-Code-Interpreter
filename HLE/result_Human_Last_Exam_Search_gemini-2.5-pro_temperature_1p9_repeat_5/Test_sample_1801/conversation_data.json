    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Paul Krugman.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major advertising effort by Enron before its scandalous collapse. A YouTube video of one of the commercials explicitly mentions its feature of physicist Murray Gell-Mann. His participation is also noted in a Reddit discussion about the advertisement.\n\nPaul Krugman, a Nobel laureate in economics, was also associated with Enron. He served on Enron's advisory board in 1999 for a fee. While his advisory role is documented, his appearance in a commercial is less so, though a Forbes article from 2002 notes his paid advisory position and a subsequent \"puff piece\" he wrote for Fortune, cementing his connection to Enron's public image efforts.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
