An upper bound for the maximum norm $(\|f\|_\infty)$ of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ of squarefree level $N$ and fixed Laplacian eigenvalue is given by $\|f\|_\infty \ll N^{-1/12 + \epsilon}$. Since the covolume $(V)$ is proportional to $N$, this translates to an upper bound in terms of the covolume.
