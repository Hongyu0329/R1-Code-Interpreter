    "An upper bound for the maximum norm, denoted as $\\|f\\|_\\infty$, of a Hecke-Maass cusp form $f$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ of the corresponding arithmetic hyperbolic surface is a central topic in the theory of automorphic forms. When considering squarefree natural numbers $N$ for the level of the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$, the covolume of the surface $\\Gamma_0(N)\\mathbb{H}$ is asymptotically proportional to $N$. Therefore, bounds on the maximum norm are typically expressed in terms of the level $N$.\n\nFor an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform $f$ of squarefree level $N$ and a fixed Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$, a significant result provides the following upper bound for the maximum norm:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/12 + \\epsilon}$\n\nfor any $\\epsilon > 0$. This bound demonstrates that as the level $N$ (and thus the covolume) grows, the maximum value of the form decreases. The notation $\\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon}$ indicates that the implied constant depends on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and the choice of $\\epsilon$.\n\nIn a \"hybrid\" setting, where both the eigenvalue and the level vary, a known bound for a square-free level $N$ is:\n\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_\\epsilon \\lambda^{5/24 + \\epsilon} N^{1/3 + \\epsilon}$\n\nIt's important to note the contrast with the \"trivial bound,\" which is of the order $N^\\epsilon$, and the \"local bound\" which is proportional to $N^{1/2}$. The advancements in this area focus on obtaining exponents that are as small as possible, ideally negative, to show that the forms become more uniformly distributed as the covolume increases.\n\nFor the specific case of squarefree levels, the structure of the associated modular curves, such as having only one cusp of width 1 at infinity, plays a crucial role in deriving these improved bounds. The methods employed to establish these bounds are highly sophisticated and often involve techniques like the amplification method and the pre-trace formula.\n\n<<<An upper bound for the maximum norm $(\\|f\\|_\\infty)$ of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ of squarefree level $N$ and fixed Laplacian eigenvalue is given by $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll N^{-1/12 + \\epsilon}$. Since the covolume $(V)$ is proportional to $N$, this translates to an upper bound in terms of the covolume.>>>"
