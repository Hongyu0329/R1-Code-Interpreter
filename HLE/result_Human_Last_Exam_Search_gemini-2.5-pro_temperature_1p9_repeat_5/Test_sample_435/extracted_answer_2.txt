Based on the body of evidence, the prediction is that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 will exhibit an enhanced capacity for cytokine release compared to those manufactured without it. This is due to IL-15's role in promoting a more persistent and functional T cell phenotype, which is primed for a potent anti-tumor response upon antigen recognition. This heightened cytokine release contributes to increased efficacy but also carries a greater risk of inducing cytokine release syndrome (CRS).
