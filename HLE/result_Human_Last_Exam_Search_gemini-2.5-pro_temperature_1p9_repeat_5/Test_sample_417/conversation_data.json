    "To determine the number of expected peaks (signals) in the ¹H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a careful analysis of the molecule's symmetry is required. Each unique set of protons in a distinct chemical environment will produce a separate signal in the NMR spectrum.\n\n### Analysis of Molecular Symmetry\nThe molecule possesses a C₃ rotational axis of symmetry that passes through the center of the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) core. This symmetry means that the three large substituents attached at the 1, 3, and 5 positions are chemically equivalent. Consequently, we only need to count the number of non-equivalent protons in one of these identical \"arms\" and the non-equivalent protons on the central ring.\n\n### Counting the ¹H NMR Signals:\n\n1.  **Central Ring (Mesitylene Core):**\n    *   The three methyl groups (`-CH₃`) at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to the C₃ symmetry. They will give rise to a single signal.\n    *   **Signal Count: 1**\n\n2.  **Linking Methylene Groups (`-CH₂-`):**\n    *   The three methylene (`-CH₂-`) groups linking the central ring to the camphor-derived substituents are also equivalent by C₃ symmetry.\n    *   However, each `-CH₂-` group is attached to a chiral center (the entire camphor-derived substituent is chiral). This makes the two protons on the methylene carbon diastereotopic. Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and, therefore, should produce two distinct signals. These typically appear as a complex multiplet known as an AB quartet.\n    *   **Signal Count: 2**\n\n3.  **Camphor-Indazole Substituent (`(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`):**\n    This substituent, commonly derived from camphor, is a rigid, chiral bicyclic system. We need to count the number of non-equivalent protons within one of these units.\n    *   **Methyl Groups:** The structure contains three methyl groups (`7,8,8-trimethyl`). Due to the rigid and asymmetric nature of the camphor skeleton, these three methyl groups are in different chemical environments and are non-equivalent.\n    *   **Signal Count: 3**\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** The indazole system contains a pyrazole ring. There is one proton directly attached to a carbon atom of this ring.\n    *   **Signal Count: 1**\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton:** The `4,7-methano` part describes a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton. There is a single proton at one of the bridgehead carbons (position C4).\n    *   **Signal Count: 1**\n    *   **Bicyclic Methylene Protons:** The remainder of the saturated skeleton (`4,5,6,7-tetrahydro`) contains two methylene groups (at C5 and C6). In this rigid, asymmetric environment, the two protons on each `CH₂` group are diastereotopic (exo and endo). Furthermore, the fusion of the pyrazole ring makes the C5 and C6 positions non-equivalent to each other. Therefore, all four of these methylene protons are chemically distinct.\n    *   **Signal Count: 4**\n\n### Final Tally\nBy summing the signals from each unique part of the molecule, we get the total number of expected peaks:\n*   From central ring `-CH₃` groups: 1\n*   From linking `-CH₂-` protons: 2\n*   From substituent's `-CH₃` groups: 3\n*   From substituent's pyrazole-H: 1\n*   From substituent's bridgehead-H: 1\n*   From substituent's bicyclic `-CH₂-` protons: 4\n\n**Total Signals = 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 12**\n\nEach signal corresponds to a set of chemically equivalent protons. Therefore, 12 peaks are expected in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
