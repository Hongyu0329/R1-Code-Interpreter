    "The most widely cited and efficient method for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) involves the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gas. This process is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine, usually in a 1:5 molar ratio, in a nickel container at a temperature of 400°C. This specific temperature is noted in the original 1962 synthesis and subsequent literature as being optimal for the formation of XeF4.\n\nThe reaction is exothermic and is represented by the chemical equation:\nXe + 2F₂ → XeF₄\n\nA nickel vessel is used because it is resistant to attack by fluorine gas, as it forms a passivating layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its surface. While the synthesis of xenon fluorides can occur over a range of temperatures, with flow methods being used between 300-500°C, these can result in contamination with other xenon fluorides like Xenon difluoride (XeF₂). The use of 400°C is consistently highlighted as the condition for an efficient and relatively pure production of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\nLower temperatures generally favor the formation of XeF₂, while higher temperatures and an excess of fluorine favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). Although some catalytic methods can lower the required temperature for xenon fluoride synthesis, 400°C remains the established temperature for efficient, direct thermal production of XeF₄. Thermal reactions to produce any xenon fluoride generally require temperatures of at least 120°C to generate the necessary fluorine atoms to initiate the reaction. However, for efficient and specific production of XeF4, 400°C is the standard.\n\nTherefore, based on the established synthesis methods, 400°C is the coldest temperature among the choices at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
