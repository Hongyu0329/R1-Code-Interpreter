    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a specific number of contracted Gaussian functions are utilized for each atom.\n\nTo determine the total number of these functions, we first analyze the composition of toluene and the structure of the 6-31G basis set for each type of atom present.\n\n1.  **Atomic Composition of Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n    *   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n2.  **Contracted Functions for Each Atom in the 6-31G Basis Set:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** Each hydrogen atom has one valence orbital (1s). In the 6-31G basis set, this valence orbital is described by two contracted Gaussian functions (a \"split-valence\" representation).\n    *   **Carbon (C):** A carbon atom has a core 1s orbital and valence 2s and 2p orbitals.\n        *   The **core 1s orbital** is represented by a single contracted function, which is a combination of 6 primitive Gaussians (the \"6\" in 6-31G).\n        *   The **valence orbitals** (one 2s and three 2p) are each split into two parts, an inner and an outer shell. This results in two contracted functions for the 2s orbital and two for each of the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz). Therefore, each carbon atom has 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 3 * 2 (for 2p) = 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n3.  **Total Calculation for Toluene:**\n    *   **For the 7 carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 contracted functions.\n    *   **For the 8 hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 contracted functions.\n    *   **Total for toluene:** 63 (from Carbon) + 16 (from Hydrogen) = 79 contracted functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
