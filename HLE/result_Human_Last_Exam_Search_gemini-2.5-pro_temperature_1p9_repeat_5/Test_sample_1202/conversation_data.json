    "Gene duplication is a fundamental source of genetic novelty, but for a duplicate gene to persist, it must avoid becoming a non-functional pseudogene. Several models explain how these duplicates are retained and diverge in function.\n\n*   **Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene. Since one copy is redundant, it is less constrained by selective pressure and can accumulate disabling mutations, becoming a non-functional \"pseudogene\". This is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not retention of a functional pair.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization:** In this scenario, one gene copy maintains the original function, while the other accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new, beneficial function. Natural selection then preserves this new, advantageous gene.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization:** This model suggests that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or was expressed in various tissues. After duplication, each copy accumulates degenerative mutations that knock out different sub-functions. Consequently, both genes are required to carry out the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene originally performed. This process, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, provides a passive route for preserving both gene copies.\n\n*   **Gene Conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between homologous sequences. It tends to homogenize gene copies, making them more similar. Therefore, gene conversion works *against* the divergence of duplicated genes.\n\n*   **Adaptive Radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a lineage rapidly diversifies to fill new ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not a direct molecular mechanism for gene retention itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are widely accepted mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, subfunctionalization is often considered a more probable initial outcome because it can occur through neutral, degenerative mutations that partition the original function, making both copies indispensable. This provides a stable state where both genes are preserved from being lost as pseudogenes. Neofunctionalization, requiring the rarer event of a new beneficial function arising, is also a critical outcome, and some models suggest subfunctionalization can be a transitional state that allows duplicate genes to persist long enough for neofunctionalization to occur. Given the options, subfunctionalization represents a highly likely and more passive route for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
