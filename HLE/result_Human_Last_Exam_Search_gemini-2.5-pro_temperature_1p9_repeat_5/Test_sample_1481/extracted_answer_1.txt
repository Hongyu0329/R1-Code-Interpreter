The leading-order behavior of the generating function `H(s,s')` in the limit as the arc-length parameter separation `|s'−s|` approaches zero is given by the asymptotic expansion:
`H(s, s') ≈ -|s' - s| - (κ(s)^2 / 8) |s' - s|^3`,
where `κ(s)` is the local curvature of the boundary at `s`. This demonstrates that the primary geometric influence on the dynamics in this regime is proportional to the square of the local curvature.
