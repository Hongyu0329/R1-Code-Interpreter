The governing linear equation for the interfacial shape `ξ(r)` is derived from the balance between the capillary pressure and the electrostatic pressure. The equation is:

`γ * d²ξ(dr)² + (γ/r) * dξ/dr + (1/2) * (ε_a - ε_b) * E(r)² = 0`

By comparing this with the form `A(r) * d²ξ/dr² + B(r) * dξ/dr + C(r, ξ(r)) = 0`, the coefficients `A(r)` and `B(r)` are identified as:

*   **A(r) = γ**
*   **B(r) = γ/r**
