    "A search for the best known lower and upper bounds for the size of a maximal cap set in the vector space F_3^n has revealed a table of these values for dimensions n=1 through n=10. A cap set is a collection of points in which no three points lie on a line (form an arithmetic progression).\n\nFor dimension 8 (n=8), the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set is 496. The table also provides the upper bound for the same dimension, which is 771.\n\nThe known exact sizes or best lower bounds for smaller dimensions are:\n*   **Dimension 1:** 2\n*   **Dimension 2:** 4\n*   **Dimension 3:** 9\n*   **Dimension 4:** 20\n*   **Dimension 5:** 45\n*   **Dimension 6:** 112\n*   **Dimension 7:** 236\n\nComparing the best known lower bound for dimension 8 with the given answer choices, the correct option is 496.\n\n<<<F>>>"
