    "There are exactly four finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA 2009 paper by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart, titled \"Small Maximal Sum-Free Sets,\" provides the classification of all finite groups that have a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2. The term \"sum-free\" is often used in the context of abelian groups, while \"product-free\" is used for general groups; the concepts are analogous.\n\nThe groups identified in the paper are:\n*   The cyclic group of order 4, denoted C₄.\n*   The cyclic group of order 5, denoted C₅.\n*   The direct product of the cyclic group of order 3 with itself, denoted C₃ x C₃.\n*   The symmetric group on 3 elements, denoted S₃, which is also the dihedral group of order 6.\n\nSubsequent research by various authors has extended this classification to maximal product-free sets of larger sizes, such as 3 and 4, confirming that the classification for size 2 is complete.\n\n<<<4>>>"
