    "The problem of placing non-attacking queens on a toroidal, or wrap-around, chessboard is a known mathematical puzzle. For an n x n toroidal board, it has been established that a solution for placing *n* non-attacking queens exists only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. This condition was proven by the mathematician George PÃ³lya.\n\nThe specific question asks for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. Since 5 is not divisible by 2 or 3, solutions for placing 5 queens exist. The problem of placing *k* queens on an *n* x *n* board where *k* is not necessarily equal to *n* is a more general variation.\n\nA direct search for the specific number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board does not yield a straightforward answer in the provided search results. The literature predominantly focuses on the *n*-queens problem. However, the search results do provide context on the complexity of the problem and point towards computational methods and academic literature where such problems are analyzed. For instance, some research discusses algorithms for enumerating solutions by considering the symmetries of the toroidal board.\n\nWithout a direct published result for this specific configuration, a definitive number cannot be provided from the search results alone. The solution would likely require a dedicated computational search, a method that has been used to verify similar queen domination problems.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the exact number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is not readily available in the provided search results.\n\n<<<The exact number of ways is not available in the provided search results.>>>"
