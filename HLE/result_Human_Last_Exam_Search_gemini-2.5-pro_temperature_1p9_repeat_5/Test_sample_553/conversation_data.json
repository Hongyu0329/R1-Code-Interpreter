    "The Beatles song that most clearly starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Things We Said Today\"** from their 1964 album *A Hard Day's Night*.\n\nThe song is in the key of A minor. The verse begins with an A minor chord, which is the tonic (i), and then immediately moves to an E minor chord, the minor fifth (v). This i - v progression establishes the song's melancholic and reflective atmosphere.\n\nAnother notable example is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**. While the song's pitch is famously ambiguous, for ease of analysis it is often considered to be in the key of A major. In this context, the verse opens with an A major chord (the tonic, I) and then moves to an E minor 7th chord (a variation of the minor fifth, v7).\n\nAdditionally, the Beatles employed the tonic to minor dominant (I - v) progression in other songs, such as \"I'll Get You\" and \"Julia\", a technique that contributes to their unique harmonic sound. This progression is characteristic of the Mixolydian mode.\n\n<<<\"Things We Said Today\">>>"
