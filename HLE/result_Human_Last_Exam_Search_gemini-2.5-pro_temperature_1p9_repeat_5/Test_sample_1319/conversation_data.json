    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Ida, specifically the one located on the island of Crete. There are two notable mountains named Ida in Greek mythology and ancient texts, and both are referenced in relation to the stories of the *Iliad*.\n\nThe highest of these is Mount Ida on Crete, with an elevation of 2,456 meters (8,058 feet). This makes it the highest mountain on the island. According to legend, this is the mountain where Zeus was hidden from his father Cronus and raised in a cave.\n\nThe other, Mount Ida in Turkey (also known as Kazdağı), has an elevation of about 1,774 meters (5,820 feet). This is the mountain from which the gods are said to have watched the Trojan War.\n\nSeveral other mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* are also historically significant, but none are as tall as Mount Ida on Crete. These include:\n*   **Mount Athos**: 2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n*   **Mount Ossa**: 1,978 meters (6,490 feet)\n*   **Mount Pelion**: 1,651 meters (5,417 feet)\n*   **Mount Saos (on Samothrace)**: 1,611 meters (5,285 feet)\n\n<<<Mount Ida on Crete>>>"
