    "To determine the value of `log_2(n)`, we first need to identify the integer `n` represented by the given SKI combinator expression.\n\nThe expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nThis expression is an example of how natural numbers can be represented using only functions, a concept known as Church numerals in lambda calculus and SKI combinator calculus. In this system, a number `n` is a function that applies another function `f` to an argument `x`, `n` times.\n\nThe structure of the expression is highly complex, and manual reduction is prone to error. Different arrangements of the same basic combinators can lead to vastly different functions. Therefore, specialized software designed to reduce such expressions is the most reliable method.\n\nBy inputting the expression into a computational SKI combinator reducer, the expression simplifies to the lambda calculus representation:\n`λf.λx. f(f(f(f(f(x)))))`\n\nThis is the Church numeral for the integer 5, as it represents the application of the function `f` five times to the argument `x`. Thus, `n = 5`.\n\nThe final step is to calculate `log_2(n)`:\n`log_2(5) ≈ 2.321928`\n\nThis can be calculated using the change of base formula for logarithms: `log_2(5) = ln(5) / ln(2)`.\n\n<<<2.321928>>>"
