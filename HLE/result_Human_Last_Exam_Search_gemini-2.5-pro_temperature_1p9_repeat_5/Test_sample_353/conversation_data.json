    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ (in radians) for the $A(\\alpha)$ stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme is given in terms of $\\arctan()$ of a precise, albeit complex, numerical expression.\n\nResearchers Akrivis and Katsoprinakis were the first to discover the exact values for the A($\\alpha$)-stability angles of BDF methods. Later, Gander and Wanner simplified the derivation and the resulting expressions. For the BDF4 method, the stability angle $\\alpha$ is approximately 73.35Â°.\n\nThe exact value of $\\tan(\\alpha)$ for BDF4 has been determined. Based on this, the angle $\\alpha$ can be expressed as:\n\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(-\\frac{51844971}{14086400} + \\frac{5765167}{70432000}\\sqrt{2033}\\sqrt{8525 + 155\\sqrt{2033}}\\right)$\n\nThe stability region of the BDF4 method is the set of complex numbers $z=h\\lambda$ for which the method is stable when applied to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$. For A($\\alpha$)-stability, this region must contain the angular sector $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha\\}$.\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(-\\frac{51844971}{14086400} + \\frac{5765167}{70432000}\\sqrt{2033}\\sqrt{8525 + 155\\sqrt{2033}}\\right)$>>>"
