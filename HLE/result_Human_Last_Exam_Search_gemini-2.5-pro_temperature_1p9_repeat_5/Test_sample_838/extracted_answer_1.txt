The final product, C, is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

Its IUPAC name is derived by identifying the longest carbon chain, which is a four-carbon butane chain. The bromine atom is located on the first carbon, and the phenyl group is on the fourth carbon, leading to the name **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

The final product, C, is **achiral**. The original stereocenter in the starting material was eliminated in the first reaction step to form the achiral alkene, 4-phenylbut-1-ene. Since all subsequent intermediates and reaction steps do not introduce any new chiral centers, the final product is also achiral.
