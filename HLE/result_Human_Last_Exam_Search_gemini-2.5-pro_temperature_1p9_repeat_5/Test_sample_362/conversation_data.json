    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that transforms aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. It involves the reaction of a carbonyl compound with a phosphorus ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent). A key benefit of this reaction is that the position of the newly formed double bond is precisely where the carbonyl group was, avoiding the formation of isomeric mixtures that can occur with other methods.\n\nIn this specific reaction, the two reactants are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde** (also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal), which is an aldehyde with the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane**, which is the phosphorus ylide.\n\nThe reaction proceeds by replacing the oxygen atom of the pivalaldehyde's carbonyl group with the doubly bonded carbon group from the ylide. This results in the formation of an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n\nThe structure of the resulting alkene is:\n(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)\n\nFollowing IUPAC nomenclature, the final product is named **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The reaction will likely yield a mixture of E and Z stereoisomers of this product.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
