    "The number of non-Grassman variables required to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with two replicas is determined by the dimension of the bosonic part of the model's target space manifold.\n\nFor the supersymmetric sigma model of symmetry class D with *n* replicas, the target manifold is the superspace SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n). The non-Grassmann variables correspond to the coordinates of the bosonic part of this coset space. The dimension of this bosonic part is the difference between the dimensions of the bosonic parts of the Lie supergroup SpO(2n, R|2n) and its sub-supergroup U(n|n).\n\nThe bosonic subgroup of the orthosymplectic Lie supergroup SpO(2n, R|2n) is Sp(2n, R) × SO(2n). The dimensions of the corresponding Lie algebras are:\n*   dim(sp(2n, R)) = n(2n+1)\n*   dim(so(2n)) = n(2n-1)\n\nTherefore, the total dimension of the bosonic part of SpO(2n, R|2n) is `n(2n+1) + n(2n-1) = 4n^2`.\n\nThe bosonic subgroup of the unitary Lie supergroup U(n|n) is U(n) × U(n). The dimension of the Lie algebra u(n) is `n^2`. Thus, the dimension of the bosonic part of U(n|n) is `n^2 + n^2 = 2n^2`.\n\nThe number of non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables is the dimension of the bosonic part of the target manifold, which is calculated as:\ndim_bosonic = dim_B(SpO(2n, R|2n)) - dim_B(U(n|n)) = `4n^2 - 2n^2 = 2n^2`.\n\nFor the case of two replicas, we set n = 2:\nNumber of non-Grassmann variables = 2 * (2^2) = 2 * 4 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
