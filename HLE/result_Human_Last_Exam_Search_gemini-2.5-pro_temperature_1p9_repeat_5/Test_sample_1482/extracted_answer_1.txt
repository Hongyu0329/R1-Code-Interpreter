Within the framework of Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Logic Systems, the vertical cross-section for a fixed primary input `x` and a secondary variable `u` is an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Set defined by upper and lower membership functions. When based on a Gaussian paradigm, these are formulated as:

**Upper Membership Function (UMF):**
`μ̄_Ã(x, u) = exp[ - ( (u - c̄(x)) / σ̄(x) )² ]`

**Lower Membership Function (LMF):**
`μ̲_Ã(x, u) = α(x) * exp[ - ( (u - c̲(x)) / σ̲(x) )² ]`

where:
*   `μ̄_Ã(x, u)` and `μ̲_Ã(x, u)` are the upper and lower membership values, respectively.
*   `c̄(x) ∈ [c̄_L(x), c̄_R(x)]` and `c̲(x) ∈ [c̲_L(x), c̲_R(x)]` are the interval-valued centers of the Gaussian functions.
*   `σ̄(x) ∈ [σ̄_L(x), σ̄_R(x)]` and `σ̲(x) ∈ [σ̲_L(x), σ̲_R(x)]` are the interval-valued standard deviations.
*   `α(x) ∈ [α_L(x), α_R(x)]` is an interval-valued scaling factor for the lower membership function, where `0 ≤ α_L(x) ≤ α_R(x) ≤ 1`.

This formulation encapsulates the uncertainty bounds, as the parameters of the Gaussian functions (center and standard deviation) are not fixed values but are themselves intervals that vary with the primary input `x`.
