    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the total number of wallpaper groups whose associated point group has an order of 2.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Concepts**\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 distinct patterns of repeating symmetry in a two-dimensional plane, also known as the 17 plane crystallographic groups.\n*   **Point Group:** For each wallpaper group, there is an associated point group. This group consists of the symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) of the pattern that leave at least one point fixed. It is formally derived by taking the quotient of the wallpaper group by its subgroup of pure translations. Glide reflections in the wallpaper group become simple reflections in the point group.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements it contains. We are interested in point groups with exactly two elements.\n\n**Step 3: List the 2D Crystallographic Point Groups and Their Orders**\nThere are 10 possible point groups for any 2D crystal structure. We list them along with their orders:\n1.  **1** (or $C_1$): Order 1 (only the identity operation)\n2.  **2** (or $C_2$): Order 2 (identity, 180° rotation)\n3.  **m** (or $C_s$): Order 2 (identity, reflection)\n4.  **3** (or $C_3$): Order 3\n5.  **2mm** (or $C_{2v}$): Order 4\n6.  **4** (or $C_4$): Order 4\n7.  **3m** (or $C_{3v}$): Order 6\n8.  **6** (or $C_6$): Order 6\n9.  **4mm** (or $C_{4v}$): Order 8\n10. **6mm** (or $C_{6v}$): Order 12\n\n**Step 4: Identify Point Groups of Order 2**\nFrom the list in Step 3, we can see that there are two point groups with an order of 2:\n*   **Point group 2 ($C_2$)**\n*   **Point group m ($C_s$)**\n\n**Step 5: Find the Wallpaper Groups Corresponding to These Point Groups**\nNow we need to go through the 17 wallpaper groups and identify which ones have a point group of either 2 or m.\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with Point Group 2 ($C_2$):**\n    *   This point group contains only a 2-fold (180°) rotation. The only wallpaper group that has 2-fold rotations as its highest order symmetry (and no reflections or glide reflections) is **p2**.\n    *   Therefore, there is **1** wallpaper group in this category.\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with Point Group m ($C_s$):**\n    *   This point group contains only a reflection symmetry. Wallpaper groups whose only non-translational symmetries are reflections or glide reflections fall into this category. Remember that a glide reflection in the wallpaper group becomes a simple reflection in the point group.\n    *   The groups are:\n        1.  **pm:** Contains reflection axes. Its point group is m.\n        2.  **pg:** Contains glide reflection axes. Its point group is also m.\n        3.  **cm:** Contains a centered lattice with both reflection and glide reflection axes. Its point group is m.\n    *   Therefore, there are **3** wallpaper groups in this category.\n\n**Step 6: Sum the Results**\nTo get the total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we add the counts from Step 5.\n*   Number of groups with point group 2: 1 (p2)\n*   Number of groups with point group m: 3 (pm, pg, cm)\n*   Total = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThere are four wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2. These are **p2**, **pm**, **pg**, and **cm**.\n\n<<<4>>>"
