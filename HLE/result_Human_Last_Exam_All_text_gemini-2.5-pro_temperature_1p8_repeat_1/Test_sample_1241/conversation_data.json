    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the System\nThe given system of equations describes the evolution of probabilities $P_i(t)$ for a system being in one of four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. This is a continuous-time Markov chain, and the equations are the Kolmogorov forward equations (also known as the master equation).\n\nThe equations are:\n1.  $P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t)$\n2.  $P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\n3.  $P_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t)$\n4.  $P_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\nwith the constraint:\n5.  $P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$\n\nThe question asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, which corresponds to the sum of the stationary probabilities for states 0 and 1. Let's denote the stationary probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\n### Step 2: Verifying the System and Correcting a Typo\nFor a system where total probability is conserved, the sum of the derivatives of the probabilities must be zero: $\\frac{d}{dt} \\sum_i P_i(t) = \\sum_i P_i'(t) = 0$. Let's check this for the given system.\nSumming the four equations:\n$\\sum P_i'(t) = [-\\lambda_{01}P_0 + \\lambda_{10}P_1] + [-\\lambda_{01}P_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_1 + \\lambda_{21}P_2 + \\lambda_{31}P_3] + [\\lambda_{12}P_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_2] + [\\lambda_{23}P_2 - \\lambda_{31}P_3]$\nCollecting terms for each $P_i(t)$:\n- For $P_0$: $-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01} = -2\\lambda_{01}$\n- For $P_1$: $\\lambda_{10} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12}) + \\lambda_{12} = 0$\n- For $P_2$: $\\lambda_{21} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}) + \\lambda_{23} = 0$\n- For $P_3$: $\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31} = 0$\nThe sum is $\\sum P_i'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$.\nGiven $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$, its derivative must be 0. This implies $-2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t) = 0$. Since $\\lambda_{01}=0.019 \\neq 0$, it must be that $P_0(t) = 0$. This would lead to a cascade of consequences that result in all $P_i(t)=0$, contradicting $\\sum P_i(t) = 1$.\nThis indicates a typo in the second equation. In a Kolmogorov-Chapman system, the term $\\lambda_{ij}P_i(t)$ should appear with a positive sign in the equation for $P_j'(t)$. Thus, the term $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ in the second equation should be $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$.\nThe corrected second equation is:\n$P_{1}'(t) = \\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t)$\nWith this correction, the sum of derivatives becomes zero, consistent with the conservation of total probability.\n\n### Step 3: Setting up the Stationary Equations\nIn the long-term limit ($t \\to +\\infty$), the system reaches a stationary state where the probabilities are constant, so $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. Let $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. The system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1. $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1$\n2. $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_1 + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_2 + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n3. $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2$\n4. $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3$\n5. $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n\n### Step 4: Solving the System of Equations\nWe can express $\\pi_0$, $\\pi_2$, and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$\\lambda_{01}\\pi_0 = \\lambda_{10}\\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}}\\pi_1$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$\\lambda_{12}\\pi_1 = (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}}\\pi_1$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$\\lambda_{23}\\pi_2 = \\lambda_{31}\\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}}\\pi_2$\n\n### Step 5: Plugging in the Numerical Values\nThe given rates are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nCalculate the ratios:\n- $\\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1$\n- For $\\pi_2$: $\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23} = 0.392 + 0.008 = 0.4$. So, $\\pi_2 = \\frac{0.4}{0.4}\\pi_1 = \\pi_1$.\n- For $\\pi_3$: Since $\\pi_2 = \\pi_1$, we have $\\pi_3 = \\frac{0.008}{0.008}\\pi_2 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_1$.\n\nSo we find a simple relationship: $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n\n### Step 6: Using the Normalization Condition\nNow substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19})\\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3)\\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + \\frac{57}{19})\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19}\\pi_1 = 1$\n$\\pi_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the Final Answer\nThe question asks for $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\nFirst, find $\\pi_0$:\n$\\pi_0 = \\frac{650}{19}\\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$.\n\nNow, compute the sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$.\n\nTo provide a numerical answer, we compute the value of this fraction:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to five decimal places gives 0.94625.\n\n<<<0.94625>>>"
