    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_{4n}$):** The generalized quaternion group of order $4n$ is defined by the presentation $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. For this problem, the group size is 128, so $4n = 128$, which implies $n=32$. The group is $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A \"power subgroup\" is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element of the group. This is the definition of a **cyclic subgroup**. The question asks for the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Structure and Elements of $Q_{128}$\n\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ can be partitioned into two sets:\n1.  The elements of the subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$, which are $\\{x^k \\mid k = 0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 64.\n2.  The remaining 64 elements, which can be written in the form $\\{x^k y \\mid k = 0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$.\n\nA reliable method to find the number of cyclic subgroups is to first find the number of elements of each possible order and then use the formula that the number of cyclic subgroups of order $d$ is the number of elements of order $d$ divided by $\\phi(d)$ (Euler's totient function).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Order of All Elements in $Q_{128}$\n\nThe order of any element must divide the order of the group, which is 128.\n\n**Case A: Elements of the form $g = x^k$**\nThe order of $x^k$ in the cyclic group $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64 is given by $o(x^k) = \\frac{o(x)}{\\gcd(k, o(x))} = \\frac{64}{\\gcd(k, 64)}$.\n\n*   **Order 1:** Requires $\\gcd(k, 64) = 64$. Only $k=0$ works. So there is 1 element ($x^0 = 1$).\n*   **Order 2:** Requires $\\gcd(k, 64) = 32$. Only $k=32$ works. So there is 1 element ($x^{32}$).\n*   **Order 4:** Requires $\\gcd(k, 64) = 16$. This means $k$ is a multiple of 16 but not 32. $k=16, 48$. So there are 2 elements.\n*   **Order 8:** Requires $\\gcd(k, 64) = 8$. Number of elements is $\\phi(64/8) = \\phi(8) = 4$.\n*   **Order 16:** Requires $\\gcd(k, 64) = 4$. Number of elements is $\\phi(64/4) = \\phi(16) = 8$.\n*   **Order 32:** Requires $\\gcd(k, 64) = 2$. Number of elements is $\\phi(64/2) = \\phi(32) = 16$.\n*   **Order 64:** Requires $\\gcd(k, 64) = 1$. Number of elements is $\\phi(64/1) = \\phi(64) = 32$.\n\n**Case B: Elements of the form $g = x^k y$**\nLet's find the order of these elements. We use the relations $y^2 = x^{32}$ and $yx^k = x^{-k}y$.\n$g^2 = (x^k y)(x^k y) = x^k (y x^k) y = x^k (x^{-k} y) y = (x^k x^{-k}) y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$.\nSince $g^2 = x^{32}$, and $o(x^{32})=2$, we have:\n$g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\nBecause $g^2 = x^{32} \\ne 1$, the order of $g$ cannot be 1 or 2. Thus, the order of every element of the form $x^k y$ must be exactly 4. There are 64 such elements.\n\n### Step 4: Count the Number of Cyclic Subgroups\n\nNow, we count the total number of elements of each order ($N_d$) and then find the number of cyclic subgroups of that order ($N_d / \\phi(d)$).\n\n*   **Order 1:** $N_1 = 1$. Number of subgroups = $1/\\phi(1) = 1/1 = 1$. (The trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$).\n*   **Order 2:** $N_2 = 1$. Number of subgroups = $1/\\phi(2) = 1/1 = 1$. (The subgroup $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$, which is the center $Z(Q_{128})$).\n*   **Order 4:** $N_4 = 2$ (from Case A) + $64$ (from Case B) = $66$. Number of subgroups = $66/\\phi(4) = 66/2 = 33$.\n*   **Order 8:** $N_8 = 4$. Number of subgroups = $4/\\phi(8) = 4/4 = 1$.\n*   **Order 16:** $N_{16} = 8$. Number of subgroups = $8/\\phi(16) = 8/8 = 1$.\n*   **Order 32:** $N_{32} = 16$. Number of subgroups = $16/\\phi(32) = 16/16 = 1$.\n*   **Order 64:** $N_{64} = 32$. Number of subgroups = $32/\\phi(64) = 32/32 = 1$.\n\n### Step 5: Sum the Number of Subgroups\n\nTo get the total number of cyclic subgroups (power subgroups), we sum the counts for each order.\nTotal Subgroups = (subgroups of order 1) + (order 2) + (order 4) + (order 8) + (order 16) + (order 32) + (order 64)\nTotal = $1 + 1 + 33 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 39$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are 39 distinct power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<39>>>"
