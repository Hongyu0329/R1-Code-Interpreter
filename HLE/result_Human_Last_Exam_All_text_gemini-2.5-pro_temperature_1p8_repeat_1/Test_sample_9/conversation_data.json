    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Space X\n\nThe question asks for the homology of $X$, the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area. We need to be careful about what \"moduli space\" means.\n\n1.  **Lattice:** A lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis $\\{\\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2\\}$ of linearly independent vectors. The lattice is the set of integer linear combinations of these vectors: $L = \\{ m\\mathbf{v}_1 + n\\mathbf{v}_2 \\mid m,n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$.\n\n2.  **Basis Matrix:** We can represent a basis by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix $A = (\\mathbf{v}_1 | \\mathbf{v}_2)$, whose columns are the basis vectors. Since the vectors are linearly independent, $A$ is in $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, the group of invertible $2 \\times 2$ real matrices.\n\n3.  **Space of Lattices:** Two bases $\\{ \\mathbf{v}_1, \\mathbf{v}_2 \\}$ and $\\{ \\mathbf{w}_1, \\mathbf{w}_2 \\}$ generate the same lattice if and only if they are related by an integer change of basis. This means the corresponding basis matrices $A$ and $B$ are related by $B=Ag$ for some matrix $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ (the group of integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$). Thus, the space of all lattices is the quotient space $GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n4.  **Unit Area:** The area of a fundamental parallelogram of the lattice generated by $A$ is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The condition of unit area restricts us to matrices $A$ with $|\\det(A)|=1$.\n\n5.  **What does \"Moduli Space\" mean?** The term \"moduli space\" usually implies that objects are considered up to a certain notion of isomorphism. For lattices as geometric objects embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the natural isomorphisms are the isometries of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. The group of isometries is $O(2) \\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^2$. The translational part is irrelevant for the structure of the lattice itself, so we consider two lattices $L$ and $L'$ to be the same point in the moduli space if $L' = R(L)$ for some rotation or reflection $R \\in O(2)$.\n\n6.  **Formal Definition of X:** Based on this standard interpretation, the moduli space $X$ is the set of equivalence classes of unit-area lattices, where two lattices are equivalent if one is an isometry of the other. This translates to the space of double cosets:\n    $X = O(2) \\backslash \\{A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid |\\det A|=1 \\} / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 2: Relating X to a More Familiar Space\n\nWe can simplify the description of $X$ by associating each lattice with a quadratic form.\n\n1.  **From Lattices to Quadratic Forms:** To a basis matrix $A$, we can associate the symmetric positive-definite matrix $Q = A^T A$. This matrix defines a quadratic form. The condition $|\\det A| = 1$ implies $\\det(Q) = (\\det A)^2 = 1$. Let $\\mathcal{P}_1$ be the space of symmetric positive-definite $2 \\times 2$ matrices with determinant 1.\n\n2.  **Effect of Equivalences:**\n    *   A change of basis $A \\mapsto Ag$ (for $g \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$) changes the quadratic form to $Q' = (Ag)^T(Ag) = g^T A^T A g = g^T Q g$.\n    *   An isometry $A \\mapsto RA$ (for $R \\in O(2)$) changes the quadratic form to $Q' = (RA)^T(RA) = A^T R^T R A = A^T I A = Q$. The quadratic form is invariant under isometries.\n    So, the space $X$ is the quotient of $\\mathcal{P}_1$ by the action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ given by $Q \\mapsto g^T Q g$.\n\n3.  **The Upper Half-Plane Model:** The space $\\mathcal{P}_1$ is homeomorphic to the Poincaré upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid \\text{Im}(z) > 0\\}$. The homeomorphism associates a point $z=x+iy \\in \\mathbb{H}$ with the matrix $Q_z = \\frac{1}{y} \\begin{pmatrix} x^2+y^2 & x \\\\ x & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n4.  **Action on the Upper Half-Plane:** We need to find how the action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $\\mathcal{P}_1$ translates to an action on $\\mathbb{H}$. This is a standard calculation. Let $g = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The corresponding transformation on $\\mathbb{H}$ is:\n    *   If $\\det(g)=1$ (i.e., $g \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$), the action is the standard Möbius transformation: $z \\mapsto \\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$. The group of these transformations is $PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})=SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})/\\{\\pm I\\}$.\n    *   If $\\det(g)=-1$, the action corresponds to an anti-holomorphic transformation. For example, the action of $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ corresponds to the map $z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$. In general, if $\\det(g)=-1$, the transformation is of the form $z \\mapsto \\frac{a\\bar{z}+b}{c\\bar{z}+d}$.\n\n5.  **Final Form of X:** So, $X$ is the quotient of the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$ by the group $G$ of transformations generated by $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ and the involution $\\tau(z) = -\\bar{z}$.\n\n### Step 3: Computing the Homology\n\nWe now compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(\\mathbb{H}/G, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Domain:** The space $\\mathbb{H}/G$ can be visualized by considering a fundamental domain for the group action of $G$ on $\\mathbb{H}$. The standard fundamental domain for $PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ is the region $D = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{H} \\mid |\\text{Re}(z)| \\le 1/2, |z| \\ge 1 \\}$. The involution $\\tau(z)=-\\bar{z}$ maps $D$ to itself, fixing the imaginary axis $\\text{Re}(z)=0$. A fundamental domain for the full group $G$ can be taken as the right half of $D$, for instance $D_G = \\{z \\in D \\mid \\text{Re}(z) \\ge 0\\}$.\n\n2.  **Topological Structure of X:** The quotient space $X = \\mathbb{H}/G$ is obtained by identifying the boundaries of the fundamental domain $D_G$ under the group actions. The resulting space is an orbifold. Topologically, it is equivalent to a closed disk. One can see this by noting that the fundamental domain $D_G$ is a triangle with vertices at $i$, $e^{i\\pi/3} = (1+i\\sqrt{3})/2$, and the point at infinity. After identifications, the space becomes a simple, closed region.\n\n3.  **Homology Calculation:** A closed disk is a contractible space. A contractible space can be continuously shrunk to a single point. Therefore, it is simply connected, which means its fundamental group is trivial. The first homology group $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$. For a simply connected space, the fundamental group is trivial, so its abelianization is also the trivial group.\n\n    $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(\\text{disk}, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\{0\\}$.\n\n---\nAn alternative interpretation exists where \"lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$\" are taken literally as subsets, not up to isometry. This leads to the space $X_{alt} \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This space is famously homeomorphic to the complement of a trefoil knot in $S^3$, and its first homology group is $\\mathbb{Z}$. However, the wording \"moduli space\" strongly implies that equivalent objects are identified, making the first interpretation (lattices up to isometry) the standard one in this context.\n\nFinal Answer Computation:\nThe moduli space of lattices is the space of lattices up to isometry. This corresponds to the quotient space $\\mathbb{H}/G$ where $G$ is the group of transformations of $\\mathbb{H}$ generated by $PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ and $z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$. This quotient space is topologically a disk, which is simply connected. The first homology group of a simply connected space is trivial.\n\n>>> 0"
