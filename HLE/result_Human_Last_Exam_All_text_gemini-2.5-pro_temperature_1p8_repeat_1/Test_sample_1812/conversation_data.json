    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to compute the determinant of the following 3x3 matrix, denoted as A:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe information about the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" provides the context from which this matrix arises in a particular area of mathematics, but it does not change the calculation itself, as the matrix is explicitly provided. The problem reduces to finding \\( \\det(A) \\).\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points and Potential Methods**\n1.  **Direct Calculation (Sarrus' Rule / Cofactor Expansion):** This is the most direct method but can be prone to arithmetic errors. It's a good idea to be methodical.\n2.  **Row/Column Operations:** We can simplify the matrix into an upper or lower triangular form. The determinant will then be the product of the diagonal elements. Row operations can also reveal linear dependence.\n3.  **Linear Dependence:** If we can show that the rows or columns of the matrix are linearly dependent, the determinant is immediately known to be 0.\n4.  **Eigenvalues:** The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues of the matrix. If we can easily find one eigenvalue to be zero, the determinant must be zero.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis using Different Methods**\n\n**Method 1: Direct Calculation (Cofactor Expansion)**\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:\n\\[ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{pmatrix} = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\]\nApplying this to matrix A:\n*   \\(a=2, b=-1, c=-1\\)\n*   \\(d=-1, e=2, f=-1\\)\n*   \\(g=-1, h=-1, i=2\\)\n\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nNow, we calculate the 2x2 determinants:\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n\nSubstitute these back into the main formula:\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2(3) - (-1)(-3) + (-1)(3)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 0\n\\]\n\n**Method 2: Checking for Linear Dependence**\nA simpler and more elegant method is to inspect the rows and columns for linear dependence.\nLet the rows be \\(R_1 = [2, -1, -1]\\), \\(R_2 = [-1, 2, -1]\\), and \\(R_3 = [-1, -1, 2]\\).\nLet's add the three rows together:\n\\[ R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = [2 + (-1) + (-1), \\quad -1 + 2 + (-1), \\quad -1 + (-1) + 2] \\]\n\\[ R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = [0, \\quad 0, \\quad 0] \\]\nSince there is a non-trivial linear combination of the rows that equals the zero vector (here, \\(1 \\cdot R_1 + 1 \\cdot R_2 + 1 \\cdot R_3 = 0\\)), the rows are linearly dependent.\nA fundamental property of determinants is that if the rows (or columns) of a matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero.\n\nThis method is very efficient and quickly gives the answer. We can see the same property holds for the columns:\n*   Column 1 sum: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   Column 2 sum: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n*   Column 3 sum: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\nThis also implies the determinant is zero.\n\n**Step 4: Acquire the Final Answer**\nBoth methods conclusively show that the determinant of the matrix A is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
