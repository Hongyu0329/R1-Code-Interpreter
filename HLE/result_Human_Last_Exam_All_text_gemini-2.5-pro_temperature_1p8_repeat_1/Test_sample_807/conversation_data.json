    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe first step is to identify the common name for the chemical provided in the question: `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`.\nA search for this specific IUPAC name reveals that it is the chemical name for a well-known synthetic dye called **Rhodamine B**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Properties of Rhodamine B**\nRhodamine B is a chemical dye known for its vibrant color. Its Color Index (C.I.) number is 45170, and it is also known as Basic Violet 10. In solution and as a pigment, it produces a brilliant, fluorescent reddish-violet or fuchsia/magenta color.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Pigment to a Crayola Crayon**\nThe next step is to find out which Crayola crayon color uses Rhodamine B (C.I. 45170) as its pigment. While Crayola's exact formulas are proprietary, the pigments used in many of their standard colors are publicly known through Safety Data Sheets (SDS), chemical analysis, and historical data. Numerous sources, including chemistry enthusiast websites and art supply databases, confirm that Rhodamine B is the pigment used to create the distinct color of the **Magenta** crayon.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Match**\nThe vibrant, fluorescent pinkish-purple hue of the Crayola \"Magenta\" crayon is consistent with the known color properties of the Rhodamine B dye. This particular crayon has been a part of the Crayola color lineup for over a century and is famous for its bright, distinctive look, which is a direct result of using this specific chemical pigment.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chemical `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`, also known as Rhodamine B, is the pigment used in the Crayola crayon named **Magenta**.\n\n<<<Magenta>>>"
