    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Molecule**\n\n*   **Molecule:** Toluene\n*   **Chemical Formula:** C7H8\n*   This means the molecule consists of:\n    *   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n    *   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n### **Step 2: Understand the 6-31G Basis Set Notation**\n\nThe 6-31G basis set is a type of Pople split-valence basis set. Let's break down the notation:\n\n*   The hyphen (`-`) separates the description of the core atomic orbitals from the valence atomic orbitals.\n*   **`6`**: This number is to the left of the hyphen, so it describes the **core** orbitals. It means each core orbital is represented by a single **contracted Gaussian function (CGF)**, which is formed by a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **`31`**: These numbers are to the right of the hyphen, so they describe the **valence** orbitals. This is a \"split-valence\" description, meaning the valence shell is represented by two basis functions for each atomic orbital.\n    *   The first number, **`3`**, means the \"inner\" part of the valence shell is represented by CGFs, each made from 3 PGFs.\n    *   The second number, **`1`**, means the \"outer\" part of the valence shell is represented by CGFs, each made from 1 PGF.\n*   **`G`**: This simply indicates that Gaussian-type functions are used.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of **contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs)**, which is synonymous with the number of **basis functions**.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Number of CGFs for a Carbon Atom (C)**\n\n*   A carbon atom (atomic number 6) is a second-row element.\n*   **Core Orbitals:** The 1s orbital.\n    *   According to the `6-` part of the notation, the 1s core orbital is described by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence Orbitals:** The 2s and 2p orbitals (which includes 2px, 2py, and 2pz).\n    *   The `31` part means the valence shell is split.\n    *   **Inner Valence (`3`):** One CGF is used for the 2s orbital and one CGF for each of the three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz). This gives a total of 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer Valence (`1`):** A second set of CGFs is used to provide more flexibility. One CGF for the 2s orbital and one for each of the three 2p orbitals. This gives another 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total CGFs for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n### **Step 4: Determine the Number of CGFs for a Hydrogen Atom (H)**\n\n*   A hydrogen atom (atomic number 1) is a first-row element. It has **no core orbitals**, only a 1s valence orbital.\n*   Because there are no core orbitals, the `6-` part of the notation does not apply.\n*   **Valence Orbitals:** The 1s orbital.\n    *   The `31` part of the notation is applied to the 1s orbital.\n    *   **Inner Valence (`3`):** The 1s orbital is represented by **1 CGF**.\n    *   **Outer Valence (`1`):** A second, more diffuse function is used for the 1s orbital, represented by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Total CGFs for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of CGFs for Toluene (C7H8)**\n\nNow we combine the results from the previous steps for the entire molecule.\n\n*   Contribution from 7 Carbon atoms: 7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = **63 CGFs**\n*   Contribution from 8 Hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = **16 CGFs**\n*   **Total Number of CGFs:** 63 + 16 = **79 CGFs**\n\n<<<79>>>"
