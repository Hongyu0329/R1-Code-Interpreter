    "To find the number of integers $x$ for which $x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square, let $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$. We are looking for the number of integer solutions $(x, y)$ to the equation $y^2 = P(x)$, where $y \\ge 0$.\n\nThis is an equation defining an elliptic curve. We are looking for its integer points.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the regions where $P(x) \\ge 0$.**\nSince $y^2$ must be non-negative, we must have $P(x) \\ge 0$.\n$P(x)$ is a cubic polynomial with a positive leading coefficient, so $P(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$ and $P(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$.\nLet's find the approximate roots of $P(x)=0$.\n$P(x) = x(x^2 - 16x - 72) + 1056$.\nThe roots of the quadratic part are $x = 8 \\pm \\sqrt{64+72} = 8 \\pm \\sqrt{136} \\approx 8 \\pm 11.66$, so approximately $19.66$ and $-3.66$.\nLet's test some integer values for $x$ to find the sign of $P(x)$:\n$P(18) = 18^3 - 16(18^2) - 72(18) + 1056 = 18^2(18-16) - 1296 + 1056 = 324(2) - 240 = 648-240 = 408 > 0$.\n$P(17) = 17^3 - 16(17^2) - 72(17) + 1056 = 17^2(17-16) - 1224 + 1056 = 289 - 168 = 121 > 0$.\n$P(16) = 16^3 - 16(16^2) - 72(16) + 1056 = -72(16) + 1056 = -1152 + 1056 = -96 < 0$.\nSo there is a root $\\alpha_1 \\in (16, 17)$.\n$P(7) = 7^3-16(49)-72(7)+1056 = 343 - 784 - 504 + 1056 = -11 < 0$.\n$P(6) = 6^3 - 16(36) - 72(6) + 1056 = 216 - 576 - 432 + 1056 = 264 > 0$.\nSo there is a root $\\alpha_2 \\in (6, 7)$.\n$P(-8) = (-8)^3-16(-8)^2-72(-8)+1056 = -512 - 1024 + 576 + 1056 = 96 > 0$.\n$P(-9) = (-9)^3-16(-9)^2-72(-9)+1056 = -729 - 1296 + 648 + 1056 = -321 < 0$.\nSo there is a root $\\alpha_3 \\in (-9, -8)$.\nThus, $P(x) \\ge 0$ for integers $x$ in the intervals $[-8, 6]$ and $[17, \\infty)$.\n\n**Step 2: Search for integer solutions in the determined range $[-8, 6]$.**\nWe can test the integer values from $-8$ to $6$.\n$P(-8) = 96$ (not a square)\n$P(-7) = 433$ (not a square)\n$P(-6) = 696$ (not a square)\n$P(-5) = 891$ (not a square)\n$P(-4) = (-4)^3 - 16(-4)^2 - 72(-4) + 1056 = -64 - 256 + 288 + 1056 = 1024 = 32^2$. So $x=-4$ is a solution.\n$P(-3) = 1101$ (not a square)\n$P(-2) = 1128$ (not a square)\n$P(-1) = 1111$ (not a square)\n$P(0) = 1056$ (not a square)\n$P(1) = 969$ (not a square)\n$P(2) = 856$ (not a square)\n$P(3) = 723$ (not a square)\n$P(4) = 4^3 - 16(4^2) - 72(4) + 1056 = 64 - 256 - 288 + 1056 = 576 = 24^2$. So $x=4$ is a solution.\n$P(5) = 421$ (not a square)\n$P(6) = 264$ (not a square)\n\n**Step 3: Search for integer solutions in the range $[17, \\infty)$.**\nLet's check the first value.\n$P(17) = 17^3 - 16(17^2) - 72(17) + 1056 = 17^2(17-16) - 1224+1056 = 289-168=121=11^2$. So $x=17$ is a solution.\n\nNow we need to check for other solutions with $x \\ge 18$.\nFor large values of $x$, we can try to bound $P(x)$ between two consecutive squares.\nLet $y^2 = P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$.\nThis equation can be rewritten by completing the square on the first two terms after multiplying by $x$: $x y^2 = x^4 - 16x^3 - 72x^2 + 1056x$. However this is not fruitful.\nA better way for cubic equations is to make a substitution to simplify the equation.\nLet $x = u+a$. We can choose $a$ to eliminate the $u^2$ term. $a = 16/3$, not an integer.\nLet's try a different approach. The equation $y^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ can be transformed. We have found three integer points: $(-4, 32)$, $(4, 24)$, $(17, 11)$.\nLet's make a transformation based on the point $(-4, 32)$. Let $x = X-4$ and $y=Y+32$.\n$(Y+32)^2 = (X-4)^3 - 16(X-4)^2 - 72(X-4) + 1056$\n$Y^2+64Y+1024 = (X^3-12X^2+48X-64) - 16(X^2-8X+16) - 72(X-4) + 1056$\n$Y^2+64Y+1024 = X^3 - 28X^2 + 104X + 1024$\n$Y^2+64Y = X(X^2 - 28X + 104)$.\nThe integer solution $(x,y)=(4,24)$ corresponds to $(X,Y)=(8, -8)$.\nThe integer solution $(x,y)=(17,11)$ corresponds to $(X,Y)=(21, -21)$.\nNotice that for these two points, $Y=-X$. Let's substitute $Y=-X$ into the transformed equation:\n$(-X)^2 + 64(-X) = X(X^2 - 28X + 104)$\n$X^2 - 64X = X^3 - 28X^2 + 104X$\n$0 = X^3 - 29X^2 + 168X$\n$0 = X(X^2-29X+168)$\n$0 = X(X-8)(X-21)$\nThe solutions are $X=0, X=8, X=21$.\n$X=0$ gives $x=X-4=-4$, which is the base point.\n$X=8$ gives $x=X-4=4$.\n$X=21$ gives $x=X-4=17$.\nThis means that the three points we found lie on the line $Y=-X$ in the transformed coordinate system. This algebraic relationship among the three known solutions strongly suggests that they are the only integer solutions. Proving this rigorously for any elliptic curve can be very difficult and generally requires advanced methods (like Baker's theory on linear forms in logarithms or descent methods), which are beyond the scope of a standard mathematics competition problem.\nLet's test one more case for completeness. The tangent at $X=0$ to $Y^2+64Y=X(X^2-28X+104)$ is $64Y' = 104$, slope $m=13/8$. Trying to find new points with this slope will lead to non-integer solutions.\nIt is a common feature of such problems that the intended solutions are found by testing small integers and that further solutions are either non-existent or very large and hard to find.\n\nThe argument for large $x$ can be made more rigorous. Let's analyze $P(x)$ for large $x$:\nLet's compare $P(x)$ to the square of a polynomial-like expression in $x$. Consider the expression $(x-8)\\sqrt{x}$. Its square is $x(x-8)^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 + 64x$.\n$P(x) = x(x-8)^2 - 136x + 1056$.\nFor $x>8$, we have $P(x) < x(x-8)^2$.\nLet's consider $(\\sqrt{x}(x-8)-1)^2 = x(x-8)^2 - 2(x-8)\\sqrt{x} + 1$.\n$P(x) - (( \\sqrt{x}(x-8)-1)^2) = -136x+1056 - (-2(x-8)\\sqrt{x}+1) = -136x+1055 + 2(x-8)\\sqrt{x}$.\nFor large $x$, the term $2x\\sqrt{x}$ dominates, and this expression is positive.\nSo for large enough $x$, we have $(\\sqrt{x}(x-8)-1)^2 < P(x) < (\\sqrt{x}(x-8))^2$.\nIf $\\sqrt{x}(x-8)$ were an integer, $P(x)$ would be between two consecutive squares and could not be a square itself.\n$\\sqrt{x}(x-8)$ is an integer if $x$ is a perfect square. Let $x=m^2$.\nThen we are looking at the region where $(m(m^2-8)-1)^2 < P(m^2) < (m(m^2-8))^2$. This inequality holds for $2m^3 - 16m + 1 > 136m^2-1055$, which is $2m^3-136m^2-16m+1056>0$. This is true for $m \\ge 68$. So for $x=m^2$ with $m \\ge 68$, $P(x)$ is not a perfect square.\n\nThis argument only covers the case when $x$ is a perfect square. A full proof is more involved. However, given the context, the systematic search and the algebraic relation between the found points suggest we have all solutions.\n\nSo the integer values of $x$ for which the given quantity is a perfect square are $-4, 4, 17$. There are 3 such integers."
