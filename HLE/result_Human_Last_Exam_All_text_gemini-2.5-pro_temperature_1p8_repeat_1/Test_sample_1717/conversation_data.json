    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Base Health\nFirst, we need to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player.\n*   In Normal Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 2800.\n*   In Expert Mode, its health is increased. According to the game's source code and data, the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode for one player is **3640**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula\nNext, we must determine how boss health scales with the number of players in Expert Mode. The source code implements a formula for this.\n*   The health calculation starts with the base Expert Mode health (for one player).\n*   For each additional player in the game session, a bonus amount of health is added.\n*   In Expert Mode, this bonus is **35%** of the base Expert Mode health for each player after the first.\n\nThe formula can be expressed as:\n`Total Health = BaseExpertHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))`\n\nLet's plug in the numbers for the Eye of Cthulhu:\n`Total Health = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Formula with an Infinite Number of Players\nThe question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. We need to analyze what happens to the `Total Health` as `NumberOfPlayers` approaches infinity (∞).\n\nLet `P` be the number of players. The health function is `H(P) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (P - 1))`.\nThis is a linear function of `P`. As `P` increases, `H(P)` also increases without any mathematical upper bound.\n`lim (P -> ∞) [3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (P - 1))] = ∞`\n\nMathematically, the health would approach infinity.\n\n### Step 4: Consider the Constraints of the Source Code\nThe question specifies that the answer must be \"according to the source code of the video game Terraria\". This means we cannot ignore the technical limitations of the game's implementation.\n\n*   In the Terraria source code (which is written in C#), the health of all NPCs, including bosses, is stored in a variable named `lifeMax`.\n*   The data type for the `lifeMax` variable is a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n*   A 32-bit signed integer has a specific range of values it can store. Its maximum possible value is `2^31 - 1`.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the Technical Limit\nThe maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is **2,147,483,647**. If a calculation results in a number larger than this, it will cause an integer overflow, leading to unpredictable behavior or crashes. The game engine itself cannot assign a health value to an NPC greater than this number.\n\nTherefore, this data type limit acts as a hard cap on the health of any NPC in the game. Even though the scaling formula is mathematically unbounded, the variable that holds the final value is bounded. The theoretical maximum health the Eye of Cthulhu can have is the maximum value its `lifeMax` variable can hold.\n\n### Careful Points:\n*   **Base Health:** It is critical to start with the correct base health for Expert Mode (3640), not Normal Mode.\n*   **Scaling Factor:** The per-player scaling bonus in Expert Mode is 35% (0.35), which is different from Normal Mode's 27.5%.\n*   **\"Theoretical\" vs. \"Implementation\":** The key to this question is balancing the \"theoretical\" nature of infinite players against the concrete limitations specified by \"according to the source code.\" The source code's data types are a hard constraint.\n*   **Other Caps:** Investigation into other potential numerical caps (like 99,999 or 999,999) shows they are either related to other game mechanics (like the Bestiary UI or Target Dummy behavior) or based on incorrect assumptions about the game's code, and do not apply to boss health scaling. The true cap is the `int` data type limit.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe health of the Eye of Cthulhu scales linearly with the number of players and would theoretically be infinite. However, due to the game's source code storing health as a 32-bit signed integer, the health is capped at the maximum value for that data type.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
