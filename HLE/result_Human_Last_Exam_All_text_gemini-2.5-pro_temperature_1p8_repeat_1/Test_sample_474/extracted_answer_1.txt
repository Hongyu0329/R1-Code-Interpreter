No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of mimicry in Bombus is to provide a clear, recognizable warning signal to their natural predators, primarily birds. This research approach is fundamentally flawed because it uses the wrong "signal receiver" to evaluate the signal. There are two main reasons for this invalidity: 1) Sensory System Mismatch: The primary predators of bees, birds, can see ultraviolet (UV) light, whereas humans cannot. Color patterns that appear similar to the human eye may look drastically different to a bird that perceives UV reflectance, and vice-versa. Therefore, human perception is an inaccurate proxy for predator perception. 2) Lack of Ecological Context: Predators learn to associate visual patterns with the negative experience of being stung. Their perception is tied to a life-or-death learning mechanism. The judgment of an untrained undergraduate is based on subjective aesthetic similarity, which has no ecological relevance and is not a valid substitute for a predator's learned avoidance behavior. Therefore, the resulting clusters would reflect human-perceived similarity, not the ecologically functional mimicry syndromes that have evolved under predation pressure.
