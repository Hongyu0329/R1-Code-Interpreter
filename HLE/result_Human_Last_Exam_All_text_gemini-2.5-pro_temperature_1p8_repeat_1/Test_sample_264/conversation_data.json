    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Question Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Objects:** We are dealing with two identical cubes.\n2.  **Define the Cube's Properties:** Each cube has a side length of 1.\n3.  **Understand the Relative Position:** The cubes are displaced relative to each other. The displacement is described as a \"shift by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\"\n4.  **Determine the Goal:** We need to find the volume of the region that is common to both cubes (their intersection).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Coordinate System Setup:** The simplest way to solve this is to place one cube (let's call it Cube A) in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. The most convenient position is with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and edges aligned with the x, y, and z axes. This means Cube A occupies the space $[0, 1] \\times [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\n\n2.  **Interpreting \"Main Diagonal\":** For a cube in this standard position, the main diagonal connects opposite vertices, such as (0,0,0) and (1,1,1). The vector for this diagonal is $\\vec{d} = (1, 1, 1)$.\n\n3.  **Interpreting the Shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\":** This is the most crucial point. This phrase is typically interpreted to mean that the shift vector has equal components along each axis, corresponding to the direction of the main diagonal. Therefore, a shift \"by 1/2\" means the displacement vector is $\\vec{v} = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)$. The alternative interpretation—a shift by a Euclidean distance of 1/2 in the direction of the main diagonal—would result in a much smaller and more complex shift vector, which is not standard unless explicitly stated as \"a distance of 1/2\". We will proceed with the standard interpretation.\n\n4.  **Orientation of the Second Cube:** The problem states the cubes are \"shifted,\" which implies a translation. It does not mention any rotation. Therefore, we assume the second cube (Cube B) has the same orientation as Cube A, with its edges also parallel to the coordinate axes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1.  **Position of Cube A:**\n    Let Cube A be defined by the set of points (x, y, z) such that:\n    $C_A = \\{ (x, y, z) \\mid 0 \\le x \\le 1, \\ 0 \\le y \\le 1, \\ 0 \\le z \\le 1 \\}$\n\n2.  **Position of Cube B:**\n    Cube B is obtained by shifting Cube A by the vector $\\vec{v} = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)$. This means we add 1/2 to the coordinates of every point in Cube A.\n    So, Cube B is defined by the set of points (x, y, z) such that:\n    $C_B = \\{ (x, y, z) \\mid 0 + 1/2 \\le x \\le 1 + 1/2, \\ 0 + 1/2 \\le y \\le 1 + 1/2, \\ 0 + 1/2 \\le z \\le 1 + 1/2 \\}$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $C_B = \\{ (x, y, z) \\mid 1/2 \\le x \\le 3/2, \\ 1/2 \\le y \\le 3/2, \\ 1/2 \\le z \\le 3/2 \\}$\n\n3.  **Define the Intersection Region:**\n    The intersection of the two cubes is the region of points that belong to *both* Cube A and Cube B. To find this region, we must find the overlap for each coordinate range.\n    *   **For the x-axis:** The region is the intersection of $[0, 1]$ and $[1/2, 3/2]$. The overlapping interval is $[\\max(0, 1/2), \\min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1]$.\n    *   **For the y-axis:** The region is the intersection of $[0, 1]$ and $[1/2, 3/2]$. The overlapping interval is $[\\max(0, 1/2), \\min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1]$.\n    *   **For the z-axis:** The region is the intersection of $[0, 1]$ and $[1/2, 3/2]$. The overlapping interval is $[\\max(0, 1/2), \\min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1]$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Volume of the Intersection:**\n    The intersection is a smaller cube defined by the inequalities:\n    $1/2 \\le x \\le 1$\n    $1/2 \\le y \\le 1$\n    $1/2 \\le z \\le 1$\n    The side length of this intersection cube is calculated for each dimension:\n    *   Side length (x) = $1 - 1/2 = 1/2$\n    *   Side length (y) = $1 - 1/2 = 1/2$\n    *   Side length (z) = $1 - 1/2 = 1/2$\n    The volume of a cube is the side length cubed.\n    Volume = (Side Length)³ = $(1/2)³ = 1/2 \\times 1/2 \\times 1/2 = 1/8$.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
