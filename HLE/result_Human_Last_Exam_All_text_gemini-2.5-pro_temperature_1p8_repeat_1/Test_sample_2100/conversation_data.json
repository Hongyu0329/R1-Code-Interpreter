    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue: \"Andrei Voznesensky called this man 'a joy-discovering sailor'.\"**\n*   Andrei Voznesensky was a famous Soviet/Russian poet. This clue directs us to look for a person featured in his work.\n*   The phrase \"a joy-discovering sailor\" is a poetic description. It suggests an explorer or traveler associated with a positive or romanticized mission. The original Russian phrase likely appears in a specific poem or libretto.\n*   This description is a key element in one of Voznesensky's most famous works: the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" («Юнона и Авось»). This work is about a real historical figure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue: \"and wondered, 'Where is your grave, even a mound?'\"**\n*   This line confirms the connection to \"Juno and Avos,\" as it is one of the most poignant lines from the opera's epilogue.\n*   It tells us that the man's burial site was unknown or lost for a very long time. This is a crucial historical detail to verify.\n*   The hero of \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. Historically, he died in 1807 in the city of Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, while on his way back to St. Petersburg. He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. However, during the Soviet era, the cathedral was demolished, and the cemetery was paved over, leading to the complete loss of his grave's location.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third clue: \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"**\n*   This is the final piece of the puzzle. The immense popularity of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" in the 1980s sparked renewed public interest in Rezanov's fate.\n*   This public interest led to historical investigations in Krasnoyarsk to locate the lost grave.\n*   In the late 1980s, research led to the identification of the probable area of the former cemetery. While the exact spot couldn't be pinpointed with 100% certainty, a symbolic memorial was established. In the public consciousness, this served as the \"answer\" to Voznesensky's question. A tombstone was placed on the supposed site of the grave, and a symbolic reburial ceremony was held, giving a sense of closure to the historical mystery.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the information.**\n*   The man is the central figure of Voznesensky's \"Juno and Avos.\"\n*   This historical figure is Nikolai Rezanov.\n*   His grave in Krasnoyarsk was lost during the Soviet era.\n*   Efforts to find and memorialize his resting place culminated in the late 1980s.\n*   Therefore, the man's last name is Rezanov.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
