    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Known Landmark:** The Pantheon church.\n    *   **Object of Inquiry:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed\".\n    *   **Timeframe:** This happened \"until 1950\", meaning it was present before and removed around that year.\n    *   **Agent:** The \"city administration\" was responsible for the removal.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Features of the Piazza:**\n    *   The primary feature is the Pantheon itself.\n    *   The second major feature is the Renaissance fountain, the Fontana del Pantheon, with the Egyptian obelisk placed on top of it in 1711.\n    *   The piazza is surrounded by historic buildings (palazzi).\n    *   These features still exist, so the answer must be something else that is no longer there.\n\n3.  **Investigate Historical Changes around 1950:**\n    *   The year 1950 is crucial. It falls in the post-World War II reconstruction and modernization period in Italy.\n    *   A common change in major European cities during this era was the reorganization of public transportation systems. Many cities began removing extensive city-center tram networks in favor of buses, which were considered more flexible and less obtrusive to historic landscapes.\n    *   We need to verify if Piazza della Rotonda had such a system.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Feature and its Removal:**\n    *   Historical photographs from the first half of the 20th century confirm that a tram line ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    *   This system included not just the metal tracks embedded in the cobblestones but also a network of overhead electrical wires and poles to power the trams.\n    *   The sight of a modern electric tram and its associated wires passing directly in front of the ancient Pantheon was indeed a \"unique\" and visually striking feature, representing the clash of ancient and modern eras.\n    *   Research into the history of Rome's public transport authority (ATAC) confirms that the tram lines in the historic center were systematically dismantled in the post-war years. The line running through Piazza della Rotonda was removed during this period, fitting the \"until 1950\" timeframe. The removal was an official act by the city to improve traffic flow and the aesthetics of the historic site.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **\"Architectural Feature\":** While one might think of a building, the tram lines and especially the complex web of overhead electrical cables can certainly be classified as a significant architectural or infrastructural feature that defined the visual character of the square for decades.\n*   **\"Unique\":** The uniqueness comes from the juxtaposition of ancient Roman and Renaissance architecture with early 20th-century industrial technology (the electric tramway).\n*   **The Date is Key:** Other features have been removed from the area throughout history (e.g., medieval additions to the Pantheon, market stalls), but the 1950 date specifically points to the removal of the tramway.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the unique architectural feature removed from Piazza della Rotonda around 1950 was the city's tram line, including its tracks and overhead electrical wires.\n\n<<<The city tramway line, including its tracks and overhead electrical wires>>>"
