    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Structure of Formulas and Concepts\n\nFirst, let's understand the components of the question.\n*   **Schema S**: This consists of 4 unary predicates, which we can denote as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic where formulas are built using only:\n    *   Atomic formulas: $P_i(x)$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and any variable $x$.\n    *   Logical constants: $\\top$ (true) and $\\bot$ (false).\n    *   Conjunction: $\\land$.\n    *   Existential quantification: $\\exists$.\n    *   Negation ($\\neg$) and disjunction ($\\lor$) are not allowed.\n\nWe are interested in the VC dimension of the concept class defined by this logic. A concept is a set of elements defined by a formula with one free variable. Let's say the free variable is $x$. A concept defined by a formula $\\phi(x)$ in a given model (structure) $M$ is the set $\\{a \\in U \\mid M \\models \\phi(a)\\}$, where $U$ is the universe of the model $M$.\n\nLet's analyze the general form of a formula $\\phi(x)$ in this logic. A formula is a conjunction of existentially quantified subformulas.\nA general formula $\\phi(x)$ can be written as:\n$\\phi(x) = \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m (\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m))$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Since all predicates are unary, an atomic formula is of the form $P_i(z)$, where $z$ is one of the variables $\\{x, y_1, \\dots, y_m\\}$.\n\nWe can rewrite $\\psi$ by separating the atoms involving the free variable $x$ from those that do not:\n$\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m) = C(x) \\land D(y_1, \\dots, y_m)$\nwhere $C(x)$ is the conjunction of all atoms involving $x$, and $D$ involves only the quantified variables $y_j$.\n$C(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nThe formula becomes:\n$\\phi(x) = \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m (C(x) \\land D(y_1, \\dots, y_m))$\nSince $C(x)$ does not depend on the $y_j$ variables, we can pull it out of the quantification:\n$\\phi(x) = C(x) \\land \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m D(y_1, \\dots, y_m)$\n\nThe subformula $S = \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m D(y_1, \\dots, y_m)$ has no free variables, so it is a sentence. For any given model $M$, this sentence is either true or false.\n\n*   If $S$ is false in model $M$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $C(x) \\land \\bot$, which is $\\bot$. The concept defined is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n*   If $S$ is true in model $M$, then $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $C(x) \\land \\top$, which is $C(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$.\n\nThe language also includes the formulas $\\top$ and $\\bot$ directly.\n*   $\\bot$ defines the concept $\\emptyset$.\n*   $\\top$ defines the entire universe $U$. This corresponds to $C(x)$ with an empty conjunction (i.e., $I = \\emptyset$).\n\nTherefore, for any fixed model $M$ with predicate interpretations $P_1^M, \\dots, P_4^M$, the set of definable concepts $\\mathcal{C}_M$ is a subset of concepts of the form $\\{ a \\in U \\mid M \\models \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(a) \\}$ for $I \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. This is the set of all possible intersections of the base concepts $P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M$.\n\nWe can show that *all* such intersections are definable. For any $I \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$, consider the formula $\\phi_I(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. This is a valid formula in our language (it is $C(x) \\land S$ with $S = \\top$). This formula defines the concept $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$.\n\nSo, for any model $M$, the concept class is precisely:\n$\\mathcal{C}_M = \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the VC Dimension\n\nThe VC dimension of the logic is the supremum of the VC dimensions of $\\mathcal{C}_M$ over all possible models $M$.\nLet $k=4$ be the number of predicates. We are looking for the VC dimension of the class of concepts formed by taking all possible intersections of $k$ base sets.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nLet's find an upper bound for the VC dimension. A concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ can shatter a set $X$ of size $d$ only if it can generate all $2^d$ subsets of $X$. This requires the class $\\mathcal{C}$ to have at least $2^d$ distinct concepts.\nFor any model $M$, the concept class $\\mathcal{C}_M$ consists of intersections of the four sets $P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M$. The number of ways to choose a subset of these four sets for intersection is $2^4 = 16$. Thus, there can be at most 16 distinct concepts in $\\mathcal{C}_M$.\nIf $\\mathcal{C}_M$ shatters a set of size $d$, then $|\\mathcal{C}_M| \\ge 2^d$.\nSo, $2^d \\le 16$, which implies $d \\le 4$.\nThis means that for any model, the VC dimension cannot exceed 4. The VC dimension of the logic is therefore at most 4.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nNow, we must show that a VC dimension of 4 is achievable for some model. To do this, we need to construct a model $M$ and a set $X$ of size 4 that is shattered by $\\mathcal{C}_M$.\nLet the universe be the set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$.\nLet's define the interpretations of the predicates $P_i^M$ as subsets of $X$. A clever choice is:\n*   $P_1^M = X \\setminus \\{x_1\\} = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_2^M = X \\setminus \\{x_2\\} = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_3^M = X \\setminus \\{x_3\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n*   $P_4^M = X \\setminus \\{x_4\\} = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n\nNow, we need to show that any subset $Y \\subseteq X$ can be represented as an intersection of some of these four sets. Let $Y$ be an arbitrary subset of $X$. We need to find an index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ such that $Y = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$.\nLet's define the index set $I$ based on the complement of $Y$, i.e., $X \\setminus Y$:\nLet $I_Y = \\{i \\mid x_i \\in X \\setminus Y\\}$.\nNow let's compute the intersection corresponding to $I_Y$:\n$\\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^M = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} (X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}) = X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I_Y} \\{x_i\\}$\nBy definition of $I_Y$, the union $\\bigcup_{i \\in I_Y} \\{x_i\\}$ is exactly the set of points in the complement of $Y$, so $\\bigcup_{i \\in I_Y} \\{x_i\\} = X \\setminus Y$.\nTherefore,\n$\\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} P_i^M = X \\setminus (X \\setminus Y) = Y$.\n\nSince we can construct any subset $Y \\subseteq X$ by choosing the appropriate intersection of the base concepts $P_i^M$, the set $X$ is shattered by the concept class $\\mathcal{C}_M$.\nThe size of the shattered set is $|X|=4$.\nThis shows that a VC dimension of at least 4 is achievable.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\n*   We have shown that the VC dimension is at most 4.\n*   We have shown that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\nCombining these two results, we can conclude that the VC dimension is exactly 4."
