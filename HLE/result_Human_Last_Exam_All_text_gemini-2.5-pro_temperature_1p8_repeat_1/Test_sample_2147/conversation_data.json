    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n### Step-by-step analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** Pavel Milyukov, a notable Russian politician, historian, and leader of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets) in the early 20th century.\n    *   **Action:** He frequently accused Western culture and specifically denounced \"X-Ys\".\n    *   **Quote:** The denunciation used the strong metaphor of a \"stagnant swamp\".\n    *   **Goal:** Identify what \"X-Y\" stands for. The format \"X-Y\" suggests a compound term, likely two related groups or movements.\n\n2.  **List Careful Points:**\n    *   **Milyukov's Ideology:** While Milyukov was a \"Westernizer\" who admired Western political institutions and scientific progress, his worldview was rooted in 19th-century positivism and rationalism. He believed in progress, reason, and the social utility of art and culture.\n    *   **Cultural Context:** The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of Modernist movements across Europe. These movements often rejected rationalism, realism, and the idea that art must serve a social or political purpose. They explored themes of subjectivity, mysticism, individualism, and aestheticism (\"art for art's sake\").\n    *   **The \"Stagnant Swamp\" Metaphor:** This imagery implies something corrupt, decaying, lifeless, and without forward momentum. This aligns perfectly with a rationalist's critique of movements perceived as morbid, self-indulgent, and detached from the \"healthy\" current of social progress.\n    *   **Likely Targets:** The most prominent and influential avant-garde movements that emerged from the West (particularly France) and took root in Russia during this time were Symbolism and Decadence. These two movements are very closely related and were often discussed as a single phenomenon by their critics.\n\n3.  **Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n    *   **Step 1:** We establish that Pavel Milyukov, despite his pro-Western political stance, was a harsh critic of certain cultural trends emerging from the West.\n    *   **Step 2:** We identify the dominant \"new\" artistic and literary movements of his time: Symbolism and Decadence. These movements stood in direct opposition to the 19th-century realist and positivist traditions that Milyukov championed.\n    *   **Step 3:** Milyukov viewed these movements, with their focus on mysticism, morbidity, and aestheticism, as a sign of cultural decay. He saw them as elitist and irrelevant to the pressing social and political problems facing Russia.\n    *   **Step 4:** In his critical essays and public statements, Milyukov frequently attacked these new artistic trends. Critics of the era, including Milyukov, often used the compound term \"Symbolist-Decadents\" to refer to the artists and writers associated with these intertwined movements.\n    *   **Step 5:** Therefore, \"X-Y\" represents the two movements Milyukov saw as one corrupting influence. He denounced the **Symbolist-Decadents** as a \"stagnant swamp\" because he believed they represented a retreat from reason and social responsibility into a decadent, unhealthy, and unproductive realm.\n\n<<<Symbolist-Decadents>>>"
