The best replacement for the S-E-D-D patch at positions 47-50 would be to mutate all four amino acids to Alanine (A). This would result in an Alanine-Alanine-Alanine-Alanine (AAAA) sequence. This change effectively removes the negative charges from Glutamate and Aspartate and, crucially, replaces the phosphorylatable Serine with a non-phosphorylatable residue, thus completely neutralizing the negatively charged environment of the patch with minimal structural disruption.
