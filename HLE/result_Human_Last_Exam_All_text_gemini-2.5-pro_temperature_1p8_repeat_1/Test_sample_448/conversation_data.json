    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth in 2002.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are a group of chemical elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. They are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*   Oganesson (Og)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Constraints of the Question**\n*   **Location:** \"On Earth,\" meaning we are considering the composition of the Earth's atmosphere, crust, and oceans (i.e., \"terrestrial matter\").\n*   **Time:** \"in 2002.\" This is a crucial point for considering all elements on the list.\n*   **Metric:** \"rarest... as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we need to compare their total abundance across the planet. The easiest and most standard way to compare them is by their concentration in the atmosphere, as this is where they are most present and well-mixed.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Noble Gas**\n\n*   **Oganesson (Og):** This is a synthetic element. A key point is its discovery timeline. Claims of synthesis in 1999 were retracted in 2001. The first confirmed synthesis of Oganesson did not occur until 2006. Therefore, **in 2002, Oganesson did not exist on Earth**. It cannot be considered the \"rarest\" because its abundance was zero; it was not a component of terrestrial matter.\n\n*   **Stable Noble Gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe):** These gases are present in the Earth's atmosphere in stable quantities that do not significantly change year over year. Their abundance in dry air by volume is approximately:\n    *   Argon (Ar): 0.934% (most abundant)\n    *   Neon (Ne): 0.0018%\n    *   Helium (He): 0.00052%\n    *   Krypton (Kr): 0.00011%\n    *   Xenon (Xe): 0.0000087% (or 87 parts per billion)\n    *   Among the stable noble gases, **Xenon** is the rarest.\n\n*   **Radon (Rn):** This is the final candidate.\n    *   **Key Property:** Radon is radioactive. All of its isotopes have short half-lives. The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n    *   **Source:** It is not a primordial gas from Earth's formation. Instead, it is continuously generated by the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, which are present in trace amounts throughout the Earth's crust.\n    *   **Abundance:** Because it decays so quickly, its concentration remains extremely low despite being constantly produced. The atmospheric concentration of Radon is highly variable but is, on average, around **1 part in 10²¹** (one part per sextillion). This is many orders of magnitude lower than Xenon's concentration.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Rarest Candidates**\nWe must compare the abundance of the rarest stable gas (Xenon) with the radioactive gas (Radon).\n*   **Xenon (Xe) Abundance:** ~8.7 x 10⁻⁸ (as a fraction of the atmosphere)\n*   **Radon (Rn) Abundance:** ~1 x 10⁻²¹ (as a fraction of the atmosphere)\n\nThe number for Radon is vastly smaller than the number for Xenon. Even considering the entire mass of the Earth, the total amount of Radon present at any single moment is minuscule (estimated to be only a few tens of grams for the entire planet) compared to the billions of tons of Xenon in the atmosphere.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Natural vs. Synthetic:** The question is best interpreted as asking about naturally occurring elements. Oganesson's non-existence in 2002 makes this point moot for this specific question, but in general, questions about Earth's composition refer to natural components.\n2.  **Stable vs. Radioactive:** The key to the answer lies in understanding the vast difference in abundance between the rarest stable noble gas (Xenon) and the naturally occurring but radioactive noble gas (Radon). The short half-life of Radon ensures it can never accumulate to significant levels.\n3.  **The \"2002\" Date:** This date is critical as it definitively excludes Oganesson from consideration. The abundances of the other naturally occurring gases have not changed meaningfully since 2002.\n4.  **\"Percentage of all terrestrial matter\":** While atmospheric concentration is the easiest metric for comparison, the conclusion holds true for all terrestrial matter. The tiny, fleeting amount of Radon produced in the crust does not change the fact that its overall abundance is many orders of magnitude less than Xenon.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, Oganesson is excluded because it did not exist in 2002. When comparing the remaining naturally occurring noble gases, Radon's extreme rarity due to its short radioactive half-life makes it significantly less abundant than any other noble gas, including Xenon.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
