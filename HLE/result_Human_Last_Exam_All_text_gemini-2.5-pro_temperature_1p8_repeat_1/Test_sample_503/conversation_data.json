    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ corresponds to a specific relationship between morphisms. We will break down the problem into several steps to find the total number of such adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the structure of $\\Delta$ as a 2-category\n1.  **Objects (0-cells):** The objects are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ for non-negative integers $n$. In our case, the objects are $[23]$ and $[37]$.\n2.  **Morphisms (1-cells):** A morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a non-decreasing (i.e., order-preserving) function. That is, if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n3.  **2-morphisms:** The category $\\Delta$ is viewed as a \"locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$\". This means for any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, the set of 2-morphisms between them is either empty or a singleton. A 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ exists if and only if $f$ is pointwise less than or equal to $g$. That is, $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. We denote this by $f \\Rightarrow g$.\n\n### Step 2: Defining an internal adjunction\nAn internal adjunction in this 2-category from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of a pair of morphisms:\n*   A left adjoint $f: [m] \\to [n]$.\n*   A right adjoint $g: [n] \\to [m]$.\n\nThese must satisfy the adjunction conditions, which are given by the existence of two 2-morphisms:\n1.  **The unit ($\\eta$):** $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\Rightarrow g \\circ f$. This translates to the pointwise inequality $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]}(i) \\le (g \\circ f)(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$, which simplifies to $i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n2.  **The counit ($\\epsilon$):** $\\epsilon: f \\circ g \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$. This translates to the pointwise inequality $(f \\circ g)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [n]$, which simplifies to $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\n(In a posetal 2-category, the triangle identities for the unit and counit are automatically satisfied.)\nThe pair of conditions $i \\le g(f(i))$ and $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $i,j$ defines a **Galois connection** between the posets $([m], \\le)$ and $([n], \\le)$. So, the question is asking for the number of Galois connections between $[23]$ and $[37]$, with $f: [23] \\to [37]$ and $g: [37] \\to [23]$.\n\n### Step 3: Simplifying the counting problem\nThe two conditions defining a Galois connection are equivalent to the single statement:\n$f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$ for all $i \\in [m], j \\in [n]$.\n\nThis equivalence implies that the function $f$ uniquely determines the function $g$, and vice versa. This allows us to count the number of valid left adjoints $f$ (or right adjoints $g$) instead of pairs $(f,g)$.\n\nA non-decreasing map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ between these posets has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins (suprema). Since $[m]$ is a finite total order, any non-empty subset has a maximum, which is its join. Any non-decreasing map preserves maxima. The only additional condition for being join-preserving is to preserve the join of the empty set.\n*   The join of the empty set in $[m]$ is the bottom element, $0$.\n*   The join of the image of the empty set (which is empty) in $[n]$ is also the bottom element, $0$.\n*   Thus, for $f$ to preserve all joins, we must have $f(\\bigvee \\emptyset_{[m]}) = \\bigvee f(\\emptyset)_{[n]}$, which translates to $f(0) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ and the set of non-decreasing maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ that satisfy $f(0) = 0$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the maps\nWe need to count the number of non-decreasing functions $f: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $f(0) = 0$.\nA function is defined by its values $f(0), f(1), \\ldots, f(23)$. We are given:\n1.  $f(0) = 0$.\n2.  $f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\cdots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nCombining these, we need to choose the values for $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(23)$ satisfying:\n$0 \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\cdots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. We are choosing 23 numbers (the values of $f(i)$ for $i=1,\\dots,23$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, 37\\}$ (which has $37 - 0 + 1 = 38$ elements), with replacement, and the order of selection doesn't matter as they will be arranged uniquely into a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nThis is a \"stars and bars\" problem. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ items with repetition is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$\\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.\n\nIn our case:\n*   $k=23$ (the number of values we need to choose: $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$).\n*   $n=38$ (the number of possible values for each choice, from $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, 37\\}$).\n\nThe number of such functions is:\n$\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n### Step 5: Final calculation\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! (60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23! 37!}$\nThis is a very large number:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = 5,618,249,242,049,510,120$.\n\n<<<5618249242049510120>>>"
