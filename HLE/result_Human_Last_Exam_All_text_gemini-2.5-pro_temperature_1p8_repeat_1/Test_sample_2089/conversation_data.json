    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the core elements of the question.**\n*   **Film Type:** It must be an Oscar-nominated film.\n*   **Key Action 1:** A character says the specific words \"Thank you\".\n*   **Key Action 2:** This is said while boarding a bus.\n*   **Consequence:** This action \"seals his fate,\" implying it creates a moment of extreme jeopardy or leads to a negative outcome.\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm potential films and scenarios.**\nThe scenario described—a simple, polite phrase leading to disaster—is a classic trope in spy thrillers or escape movies. The character is likely undercover, and this small slip-up threatens to reveal their true identity. The words \"Thank you\" might reveal their nationality through language or accent.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate a well-known but incorrect candidate: *Inglourious Basterds*.**\n*   This is an Oscar-nominated film with a famous scene where a character's cover is blown by a subtle mistake.\n*   **The Mistake:** Lieutenant Hicox, a British officer posing as a German, orders three drinks using a hand gesture (thumb, index, middle finger) that is not German.\n*   **The Setting:** This occurs in a basement tavern, not while boarding a bus.\n*   **The Phrase:** The trigger is a gesture, not the words \"Thank you.\"\n*   **Conclusion:** While thematically similar, *Inglourious Basterds* does not match the specific details of the question.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the correct candidate: *Argo*.**\n*   **Film Type:** *Argo* was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won three, including Best Picture.\n*   **The Plot:** A CIA agent devises a plan to rescue six American diplomats from Tehran during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis by disguising them as a Canadian film crew.\n*   **The Scene:** The climax of the film takes place at the Mehrabad Airport in Tehran. After passing through multiple tense checkpoints, the group is finally walking on the tarmac to board the bus that will take them to their plane.\n*   **The Action:** As they board the bus, one of the diplomats, Bob Anders, instinctively says \"Thank you\" in English to one of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards.\n*   **The Consequence:** The guard, who does not speak English, is momentarily confused by the unfamiliar phrase. His suspicion is aroused, and he follows them onto the bus to report the incident to his superiors. This action directly leads to the final, terrifying confrontation where the guards try to stop the plane from taking off. The fate of the entire mission hinges on this one slip-up.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nThe film that precisely matches all the details provided in the question—an Oscar-nominated film where a character says \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus, nearly sealing his (and the group's) fate—is *Argo*.\n\n<<<Argo>>>"
