    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Setup**\n*   **The Tank:** The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 identical equilateral triangle faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices.\n*   **Orientation:** The icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the triangular faces is the base and is perfectly horizontal. Because an icosahedron is a regular polyhedron, the face directly opposite the base is also a horizontal triangle, parallel to the base.\n*   **Water Level:** The tank is \"half-filled with water.\" This means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Plane of the Water Surface**\n*   The surface of still water under gravity is always a horizontal plane.\n*   A regular icosahedron is a centrally symmetric object, meaning it has a point at its geometric center such that any line passing through this center intersects the surface of the icosahedron at two points equidistant from the center.\n*   For any centrally symmetric object, the plane that cuts the object into two equal volumes must pass through its center of symmetry.\n*   Therefore, the water surface is a horizontal plane that passes exactly through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Symmetry of the Icosahedron in this Orientation**\n*   When resting on a face, the icosahedron has a vertical axis of symmetry that passes through the center of the base triangle, the center of the icosahedron, and the center of the top triangle.\n*   Rotating the icosahedron by 120° (or 240°) around this vertical axis leaves the icosahedron unchanged. This is a 3-fold rotational symmetry axis.\n*   The shape of the water surface is the cross-section created by cutting the icosahedron with the horizontal plane passing through its center.\n\n**Step 4: Deduce the Shape of the Cross-Section from Symmetry**\n1.  **Rotational Symmetry:** Since the icosahedron has a 3-fold rotational symmetry around the vertical axis, the horizontal cross-section must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n2.  **Central Symmetry:** Since the cutting plane passes through the center of symmetry of the icosahedron, the resulting 2D cross-section must also be centrally symmetric (i.e., it looks the same after being rotated 180° around its center).\n3.  **Combining Symmetries:** A geometric shape that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry must necessarily have 6-fold rotational symmetry. The vertices of such a polygon would consist of a set of 3 points (from the 3-fold symmetry) plus their 3 centrally opposite points. These 6 points will be equally spaced around the center.\n4.  **Convexity:** An icosahedron is a convex polyhedron. Any planar slice (cross-section) of a convex object is a convex polygon.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The only convex polygon with 6-fold rotational symmetry is a regular hexagon.\n\n**Step 5: Visual Confirmation (Structural Analysis)**\nTo be certain, we can consider the structure of the icosahedron's vertices and edges.\n*   In this orientation, the 12 vertices are located on four distinct horizontal planes. There is a set of 3 vertices on the bottom plane (the base) and 3 on the top plane. In between, there are two planes each containing 3 vertices.\n*   The horizontal mid-plane (the water surface) passes exactly between the two middle layers of vertices.\n*   The edges of the cross-section are formed where the plane cuts the faces of the icosahedron. The vertices of the cross-section are formed where the plane intersects the edges of the icosahedron.\n*   The only edges of the icosahedron that the mid-plane can cut are those connecting a vertex above the plane to a vertex below the plane. In this orientation, these are precisely the 6 edges that connect the two middle layers of vertices.\n*   Since the plane cuts 6 edges of the icosahedron, the resulting cross-section is a hexagon. As determined by the symmetry analysis, this hexagon must be regular.\n\nTherefore, the shape of the water surface is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<regular hexagon>>>"
