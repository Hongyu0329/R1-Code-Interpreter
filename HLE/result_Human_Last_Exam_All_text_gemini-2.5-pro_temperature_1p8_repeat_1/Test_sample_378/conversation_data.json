    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the subject of the question:** The question is about the former President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan.\n2.  **Analyze the name provided:** The name given in the question is \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". This includes \"Azikiwe\" as a middle name.\n3.  **Verify the official name:** The correct and official full name of the former president is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**. \"Ebele\" is his middle name, and \"Jonathan\" is his surname.\n4.  **Investigate the name \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was the first President of Nigeria. He is a different historical figure.\n5.  **Search for evidence:** A thorough check of public records, official biographies, news archives, and speeches made during Goodluck Jonathan's time in public office is required to see if he ever adopted or publicly identified with the name \"Azikiwe\".\n6.  **Evaluate the findings:** Research indicates no credible evidence that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever added \"Azikiwe\" to his name or publicly identified himself as such. The name in the question appears to be a conflation of two different Nigerian presidents.\n7.  **Conclusion:** The premise of the question is incorrect. Since Goodluck Jonathan never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe,\" there is no year in which such an event could have taken place.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Accuracy of Names:** It is crucial to verify the full and official names of public figures, as inaccuracies can lead to incorrect assumptions.\n*   **Source of Confusion:** The confusion likely arises from the fact that both Goodluck Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe served as President of Nigeria. The name \"Azikiwe\" was likely mistakenly added to Goodluck Jonathan's name.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** The lack of any record of this event is strong evidence that it never occurred. The burden of proof would be on showing that it *did* happen, and no such proof exists.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the analysis, the event described in the question never happened. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's name does not include \"Azikiwe,\" and he has never publicly identified by that name.\n\n<<<Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as Azikiwe. The premise of the question is incorrect as \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name."
