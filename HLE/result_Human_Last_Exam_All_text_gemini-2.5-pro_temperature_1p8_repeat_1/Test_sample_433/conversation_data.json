    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of a specific type of drug container under specific conditions.\n2.  **Deconstruct the Key Terms:**\n    *   **BUD (Beyond-Use Date):** This is the date and time after which a preparation, once opened or compounded, must not be used. It is determined based on the risk of microbial contamination and chemical/physical instability. The primary guidance for this comes from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP).\n    *   **Single-Dose Container (SDC):** This is a container intended for a single use for a single patient. A critical characteristic of SDCs is that they lack antimicrobial preservatives. Examples include vials, ampules, and prefilled syringes.\n    *   **Ampule:** A specific type of SDC made of glass. It is sealed by melting the glass at the top. To open it, the neck of the ampule is broken. It cannot be resealed after opening, making it an open system.\n    *   **Puncture:** In the context of an ampule, \"puncture\" is equivalent to breaking it open to access the contents.\n    *   **Sterile Environment:** This refers to an environment with a very low level of airborne particles and microorganisms. In pharmaceutical practice, this means an ISO Class 5 environment or better, such as inside a laminar airflow workbench (LAFW), biological safety cabinet (BSC), or compounding aseptic isolator (CAI).\n\n3.  **Consult Authoritative Standards:** The primary standard governing sterile compounding and BUDs in the United States is **USP General Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compounding—Sterile Preparations**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Specific Rule from USP <797>:**\n    *   USP <797> provides specific guidelines for the use of single-dose containers to minimize the risk of microbial contamination.\n    *   The chapter distinguishes between opening a container inside and outside of a controlled sterile environment.\n    *   The rule for a single-dose container (which includes ampules) that has been opened or punctured **within an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment** states that the contents may be used for up to **12 hours** after the initial opening.\n    *   After this 12-hour period, any remaining contents must be discarded.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Ampule vs. Vial:** An ampule, once broken, is an open-air container. A vial has a rubber stopper that can be re-punctured. Despite this physical difference, USP <797> groups them under the same rule for SDCs opened within an ISO Class 5 environment. Best practice often encourages immediate use of ampule contents, but the maximum allowable time (the BUD) is 12 hours.\n*   **Environment is Crucial:** If the same ampule were opened outside of an ISO Class 5 environment (e.g., at a patient's bedside), the BUD would be much shorter, typically considered immediate use or within 1 hour. The question specifically states \"in a sterile environment,\" which points to the 12-hour rule.\n*   **BUD vs. Stability:** The 12-hour BUD is based on microbiological sterility risk. The drug's own chemical stability might be shorter. The final expiration date must be whichever is shorter – the sterility-based BUD or the drug's chemical stability limit. However, the question is asking for the standard BUD based on the container type and opening conditions.\n*   **Do Not Confuse with Multi-Dose Vials (MDVs):** MDVs contain preservatives and have a different BUD, which is typically 28 days after the first puncture, unless specified otherwise by the manufacturer. The question is explicitly about a single-dose container.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the guidelines in USP <797>, a single-dose container ampule, once opened in a sterile (ISO Class 5) environment, has a Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of 12 hours.\n\n<<<12 hours>>>"
