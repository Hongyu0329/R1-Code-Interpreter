    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Identify the type of differential equation**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can write $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$.\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1) \\cdot x^2 $$\nThis equation is a **separable differential equation** because it can be written in the form $\\frac{dx}{dt} = g(t)h(x)$, where $g(t) = t-1$ and $h(x) = x^2$.\n\n**2. Separate the variables**\n\nTo solve a separable equation, we group all terms involving $x$ on one side with $dx$ and all terms involving $t$ on the other side with $dt$.\nFirst, we should check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If $x(t)=0$, then $x'(t)=0$ and $(t-1)x^2(t) = 0$, so $x(t)=0$ is indeed a solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0) = -8$, which means we are not looking for this particular solution. Thus, we can safely divide by $x^2(t)$ assuming $x(t) \\neq 0$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n\n**3. Integrate both sides**\n\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation.\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's compute each integral:\n*   The integral of the left side is $\\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n*   The integral of the right side is $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$.\n\nCombining these results, we get:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n**4. Use the initial condition to find the constant C**\n\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our integrated equation to solve for $C$.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**5. Write the particular solution**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**6. Find the value of x(1)**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $x(1)$. We can find this by substituting $t=1$ into our particular solution.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nNow, we simplify the right-hand side:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 8.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8} $$\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, to solve for $x(1)$, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Separation of Variables:** Ensure that you are allowed to divide by the function of $x$. This is justified by checking that the constant solution $x=0$ does not satisfy the given initial condition.\n*   **Integration:** Be very careful with the integration of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$. A common mistake is to forget the negative sign, i.e., $\\int x^{-2} dx = -x^{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$.\n*   **Using the Initial Condition:** Pay close attention to signs when substituting negative values. In this case, $-\\frac{1}{x}$ with $x=-8$ becomes $-\\frac{1}{-8} = +\\frac{1}{8}$.\n*   **Algebra:** When solving for the final value, simplify the arithmetic step-by-step to avoid calculation errors, especially when dealing with fractions.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
