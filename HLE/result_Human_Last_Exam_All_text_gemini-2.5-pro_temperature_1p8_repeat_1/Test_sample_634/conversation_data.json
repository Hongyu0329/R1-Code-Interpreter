    "An analysis of the problem to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices P1 and P2 is provided below.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of GCRD and the method to find it.**\n\nA polynomial matrix `R` is a **right divisor** of a polynomial matrix `P` if there exists another polynomial matrix `Q` such that `P = Q * R`.\n\nA polynomial matrix `G` is a **greatest common right divisor (GCRD)** of `P1` and `P2` if:\n1.  `G` is a common right divisor of `P1` and `P2` (i.e., `P1 = Q1 * G` and `P2 = Q2 * G` for some polynomial matrices `Q1`, `Q2`).\n2.  If `D` is any other common right divisor of `P1` and `P2`, then `D` is a right divisor of `G` (i.e., `G = H * D` for some polynomial matrix `H`).\n\nA standard method to find the GCRD of `P1` and `P2` is to use an extension of the Euclidean algorithm. This involves performing elementary row operations on the augmented matrix formed by stacking `P1` and `P2`.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the augmented matrix.**\n\nWe form the augmented matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n      -s^2 - 1, s^2]\nP2 = [s, 0;\n      -s - 1, 1]\n\nM = [P1; P2] =\n[s^2 + s, -s]      (Row 1)\n[-s^2 - 1, s^2]     (Row 2)\n[s,        0]      (Row 3)\n[-s - 1,   1]      (Row 4)\n\n**Step 3: Perform elementary row operations to find the GCRD.**\n\nThe goal is to reduce `M` to a form `[R; 0]`, where `R` is a square matrix (in this case, 2x2). This matrix `R` will be a GCRD of `P1` and `P2`. Elementary row operations include swapping rows, multiplying a row by a non-zero constant, and adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\n1.  **Use Row 3 to simplify Row 1 and Row 2.** The entries in Row 3 have lower polynomial degrees, making them good pivots.\n    *   `Row 1 -> Row 1 - (s+1) * Row 3`:\n        [s^2 + s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s - 0] = [0, -s]\n    *   `Row 2 -> Row 2 + s * Row 3`:\n        [-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s[s, 0] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2 + 0] = [-1, s^2]\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [0,       -s]\n    [-1,       s^2]\n    [s,        0]\n    [-s - 1,   1]\n\n2.  **Re-arrange and simplify to create a clear pivot.** Swap Row 1 and Row 2, and then multiply the new Row 1 by -1 to get a `1` in the top-left position.\n    *   Swap Row 1 and Row 2:\n    [-1,       s^2]\n    [0,       -s]\n    [s,        0]\n    [-s - 1,   1]\n    *   `Row 1 -> -1 * Row 1`:\n    [1,       -s^2]\n    [0,       -s]\n    [s,        0]\n    [-s - 1,   1]\n\n3.  **Use the new Row 1 to eliminate the other entries in the first column.**\n    *   `Row 3 -> Row 3 - s * Row 1`:\n        [s, 0] - s[1, -s^2] = [s - s, 0 - s(-s^2)] = [0, s^3]\n    *   `Row 4 -> Row 4 + (s+1) * Row 1`:\n        [-s - 1, 1] + (s+1)[1, -s^2] = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1 + (s+1)(-s^2)] = [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]\n    The matrix is now:\n    [1, -s^2]\n    [0, -s]\n    [0, s^3]\n    [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]\n\n4.  **Use row operations on the second column to create zeros.** Let's try to get a constant in one of the rows. We can do this by using polynomial division. Notice that `1 - s^3 - s^2 = (s^2 + s)(-s) + 1`.\n    *   Let the current non-zero rows be A, B, C, D (for R1, R2, R3, R4).\n    *   `Row 3 -> Row 3 + s^2 * Row 2`:\n        [0, s^3] + s^2[0, -s] = [0, s^3 - s^3] = [0, 0]\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [1, -s^2]\n    [0, -s]\n    [0, 0]\n    [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]\n\n5.  **Simplify further.** Now we only have three non-zero rows. We need to eliminate one more.\n    *   Swap Row 3 and Row 4:\n    [1, -s^2]\n    [0, -s]\n    [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2]\n    [0, 0]\n    *   We can use `Row 2` to simplify the new `Row 3`.\n        The polynomial `1 - s^3 - s^2` divided by `-s` gives a quotient of `s^2 + s` and a remainder of `1`.\n    *   `Row 3 -> Row 3 - (s^2 + s) * Row 2`:\n        [0, 1 - s^3 - s^2] - (s^2 + s)[0, -s] = [0, (1 - s^3 - s^2) - (-s^3 - s^2)] = [0, 1]\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [1, -s^2]\n    [0, -s]\n    [0, 1]\n    [0, 0]\n\n6.  **Final reduction to canonical form.** Use the row `[0, 1]` to eliminate other entries in the second column.\n    *   Swap Row 2 and Row 3:\n    [1, -s^2]\n    [0, 1]\n    [0, -s]\n    [0, 0]\n    *   `Row 1 -> Row 1 + s^2 * Row 2`:\n        [1, -s^2] + s^2[0, 1] = [1, -s^2 + s^2] = [1, 0]\n    *   `Row 3 -> Row 3 + s * Row 2`:\n        [0, -s] + s[0, 1] = [0, -s + s] = [0, 0]\n\n7.  **Final Resulting Matrix.**\n    The matrix is now reduced to:\n    [1, 0]\n    [0, 1]\n    [0, 0]\n    [0, 0]\n\nThe non-zero part of the reduced matrix is the GCRD.\nR = [1, 0;\n     0, 1]\nThis is the identity matrix, `I`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe GCRD of the polynomial matrices `P1` and `P2` is the 2x2 identity matrix. This means that `P1` and `P2` are **right coprime**.\n\n[1, 0;\n 0, 1]\n>>> [[1, 0], [0, 1]]"
