    "Answering the question requires understanding the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ when $q$ is a primitive root of unity.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the algebraic structure and the parameter `q`**: The algebra is $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$. The parameter $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let $\\ell=3$ be the order of $q$. The representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is fundamentally different when $q$ is a root of unity compared to the generic case.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Category `C`**: The question asks for a percentage, which implies a ratio of finite numbers. The category of all finite-dimensional representations of the full quantum group $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ has infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable objects and is of wild or tame representation type, making a percentage calculation ill-defined. However, it is common to study the \"small quantum group\" $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, which is a finite-dimensional quotient of $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$. For $\\ell=3$, the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is of **finite representation type**, meaning there is a finite number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules. This is the only standard interpretation that renders the question meaningful. Therefore, we assume $C$ is the category of finite-dimensional representations of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$.\n\n3.  **Count the total number of indecomposable objects**: For $q$ a primitive $\\ell$-th root of unity, the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is of finite representation type if and only if $\\ell < 4$. In our case, $\\ell=3$, so it is. The total number of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules for this algebra is known to be $\\ell^2$.\n    *   For $\\ell=3$, the total number of objects (isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules) in $C$ is $3^2 = 9$.\n\n4.  **Count the number of irreducible objects**: An object in $C$ is irreducible if it is a simple module. By definition, a simple module is indecomposable. So, we need to count the number of non-isomorphic simple modules of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. For $\\ell$ being an odd integer, the number of non-isomorphic simple modules is $2\\ell-1$.\n    *   For $\\ell=3$, the number of irreducible objects in $C$ is $2(3)-1=5$.\n\n5.  **Decomposition into Blocks**: To verify these numbers, we can analyze the block structure of the category. The algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ decomposes into a direct sum of blocks.\n    *   There are $\\ell=3$ blocks containing a single indecomposable module, which is both simple and projective. Let's call them $S_1, S_q, S_{q^2}$. These contribute 3 objects to our count of indecomposables, all of which are irreducible.\n    *   There is one block, the principal block, which contains the remaining modules. For $\\ell=3$, this block has $\\ell-1 = 2$ simple modules, say $L_1$ and $L_2$. This block is of non-zero radical and corresponds to a Nakayama algebra. It contains 6 indecomposable modules:\n        *   The two simple modules $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n        *   Two indecomposable modules of length 2, which are extensions of one simple by the other.\n        *   Two projective covers, $P(L_1)$ and $P(L_2)$, which are indecomposable and have length 3.\n    *   So, in total there are $3+6=9$ indecomposable modules.\n    *   The irreducible (simple) modules are $S_1, S_q, S_{q^2}, L_1, L_2$. So there are $3+2=5$ irreducible modules.\n\n6.  **Calculate the percentage**: The percentage of irreducible objects is the ratio of the number of irreducible modules to the total number of indecomposable modules, multiplied by 100.\n    *   Number of irreducible objects: 5\n    *   Total number of indecomposable objects: 9\n    *   Percentage = $\\frac{5}{9} \\times 100\\% \\approx 55.555...\\%$\n\n7.  **Final Answer Formatting**: Following the example format with one decimal place, we round the result.\n    *   $55.555...\\% \\approx 55.6\\%$\n\n### Careful points summary:\n*   The crucial step is identifying the relevant algebraic structure as the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, which has finite representation type for $\\ell=3$.\n*   The counts of indecomposable and simple modules ($\\ell^2$ and $2\\ell-1$ respectively, for odd $\\ell$) are standard results from the theory of representations of this algebra.\n*   The category decomposes into blocks, which simplifies the counting argument. There are $\\ell$ simple blocks and one principal block of more complex structure.\n*   Every irreducible module is indecomposable, so the set of irreducibles is a subset of the set of indecomposables.\n\nFinal calculation:\nTotal indecomposable modules: 9\nTotal irreducible modules: 5\nPercentage = $(5/9) * 100 = 55.555...$\n\n<<<55.6>>>"
