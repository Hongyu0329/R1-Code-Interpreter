    "Answering the user's request involves a detailed breakdown of the problem, focusing on creating the most memory-efficient C program, and then calculating the memory footprint of its variables.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Understand the Input:** The program receives a single line of text, which is a string representing a mathematical sum. This string is non-empty, contains no spaces, and is guaranteed to be a correct sum. The summands (numbers) are exclusively 1, 2, 3, or 4. The string's maximum length is 1000 characters. For example: `3+1+4+2+1`.\n\n2.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to rearrange the summands in non-decreasing (i.e., sorted) order and print the new sum. For the example `3+1+4+2+1`, the numbers are 3, 1, 4, 2, 1. Sorted, they are 1, 1, 2, 3, 4. The required output is the string `1+1+2+3+4`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Core Constraint:** The most critical part of the request is to design the \"most memory-efficient C program\". This means we must minimize the amount of memory used, particularly for variables and data storage.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Output:** The final output should be a single number, `m`, representing the total memory in bytes consumed by the variables in the proposed memory-efficient solution.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Avoiding Large Buffers:** A naive approach would read the entire string into a character array (e.g., `char s[1001];`), which immediately uses over 1 KB of memory. To be memory-efficient, we should avoid this and process the input character by character. The `getchar()` function in C is ideal for this.\n\n2.  **Choosing the Right Sorting Algorithm:** The numbers to be sorted are from a very small and fixed set {1, 2, 3, 4}. This makes **Counting Sort** the perfect choice. It is highly efficient in both time and memory. We only need four counters, one for each possible number. This avoids creating a large intermediate array to store the numbers before sorting, which would be necessary for a general-purpose algorithm like `qsort`.\n\n3.  **Handling Output Formatting:** The output string must have `+` symbols between the numbers but not at the very end. This requires careful logic during the printing phase. A simple boolean flag can track whether the number being printed is the first one, thus determining if a preceding `+` is needed.\n\n4.  **Minimizing Variable Size:** To be maximally memory-efficient, we should select the smallest possible standard C data type for each variable.\n    *   The string length is at most 1000. This means there are at most `(1000 + 1) / 2 = 500.5`, i.e., 501 numbers. The counters for 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s must be able to hold a value of at least 501. A `short int` (typically 2 bytes, range -32,768 to 32,767) is sufficient. An `int` (typically 4 bytes) would be overkill.\n    *   The variable used to read from `getchar()` must be an `int` because the function returns `EOF` (a special integer value) to signal the end of the input stream. A `char` cannot hold this value.\n    *   A flag for printing logic (e.g., `is_first_number`) only needs to store a true/false value, for which a `char` (1 byte) is the smallest suitable type.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis and careful points, here is the step-by-step derivation of the most memory-efficient solution and its memory cost.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1.  Declare variables: four `short` counters for numbers 1-4, one `int` for `getchar()`, and one `char` flag for printing logic.\n2.  Initialize all counters to zero and the printing flag to a \"true\" state.\n3.  Enter a loop that reads one character at a time using `getchar()` until a newline or `EOF` is reached.\n4.  Inside the loop, use a `switch` or `if-else if` block. If the character is '1', '2', '3', or '4', increment the corresponding counter. Ignore '+' characters.\n5.  After the loop finishes, all numbers have been counted. Begin the printing phase.\n6.  Use a series of loops to print the numbers. For each number:\n    a. First, check the printing flag. If it's not the first number, print a `+`.\n    b. Then, print the number itself (e.g., '1').\n    c. Finally, update the flag to a \"false\" state.\n7.  Repeat this for all counted '1's, then all '2's, then '3's, and finally all '4's.\n\n**Memory Calculation (m):**\nWe sum the sizes of the variables required for this algorithm, assuming a standard 32-bit/64-bit architecture where `sizeof(short)` is 2, `sizeof(int)` is 4, and `sizeof(char)` is 1.\n\n*   **Input Character Variable:** One variable is needed to store the return value of `getchar()`.\n    *   `int c;` -> `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**\n*   **Number Counters:** Four counters are needed, one for each number from 1 to 4. As determined, `short` is the smallest sufficient type.\n    *   `short count1, count2, count3, count4;` -> 4 * `sizeof(short)` = 4 * 2 = **8 bytes**\n*   **Printing Logic Flag:** One flag is needed to manage the `+` separators. A `char` is sufficient.\n    *   `char is_first;` -> `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nm = (memory for input char) + (memory for counters) + (memory for flag)\nm = 4 bytes + 8 bytes + 1 byte\nm = 13 bytes\n\nThis represents the minimum memory required for the variables to implement a correct and robust solution without storing the whole input string.\n\n<<<13>>>"
