    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The stereochemistry (1S,2R) indicates that the bromine atom and the methyl group are on opposite sides of the ring plane (they are *trans* to each other).\n*   **Reagent and Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOC(CH₃)₃) in tert-butyl alcohol ((CH₃)₃COH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base strongly favors an elimination reaction, specifically an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction. Substitution (SN2) is disfavored due to the bulky base and the secondary substrate.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Stereochemical Requirements of the E2 Reaction**\nThe E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (in this case, Br⁻) and the proton that is removed by the base must be in an **anti-periplanar** arrangement. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this translates to a **trans-diaxial** orientation. That is, both the leaving group and the β-hydrogen must be in axial positions, one pointing up and the other pointing down.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\nA molecule can only undergo an E2 reaction when it is in the correct conformation. We must draw the two chair conformations of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane to see which one can react.\n*   **Conformation A:** Since the methyl group (A-value ≈ 1.7 kcal/mol) is bulkier than the bromine atom (A-value ≈ 0.4-0.6 kcal/mol), the more stable conformer will have the methyl group in the equatorial position. Because the Br and CH₃ groups are trans, if the methyl group is equatorial, the bromine must be **axial**. This is the more stable and more populated conformer.\n*   **Conformation B:** After a ring flip, the methyl group becomes axial and the bromine becomes equatorial. This is the less stable conformer and exists in a much lower concentration at equilibrium.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Reactive Conformation and the Site of Elimination**\n*   The E2 reaction requires the leaving group (Br) to be **axial**. Therefore, the reaction must proceed from **Conformation A**. The less stable Conformation B, where Br is equatorial, cannot undergo the E2 reaction.\n*   Now, we examine Conformation A to find a β-hydrogen that is trans-diaxial to the axial bromine. There are two β-carbons: C2 and C6.\n    *   **Hydrogen at C2:** This carbon also has the equatorial methyl group. The hydrogen on C2 is therefore in the **axial** position. However, it is on the same side as the axial bromine (both might be \"up,\" for example). They are *syn-periplanar*, not anti-periplanar. Therefore, elimination cannot occur towards C2 to form a double bond between C1 and C2.\n    *   **Hydrogen at C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is equatorial, and one is **axial**. This axial hydrogen is on the opposite side of the ring from the axial bromine, making them **trans-diaxial**. This is the required orientation for E2 elimination.\n*   The base (tert-butoxide) will therefore attack the axial hydrogen on C6.\n\n**Step 5: Identify and Name the Final Product**\n*   Since the elimination must involve the hydrogen from C6, the double bond forms between carbon 1 and carbon 6. The methyl group on carbon 2 is unaffected by the reaction.\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexene ring where the double bond is between C1 and C6 (from the original numbering), and a methyl group is on C2.\n*   To name this product according to IUPAC rules, we number the ring to give the double bond the lowest numbers (C1 and C2) and the substituent the lowest possible number after that. Numbering the double bond as C1-C2 (from original C1-C6) places the methyl group on carbon 3.\n*   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the Hofmann product (less substituted alkene), which is formed because the stereochemical requirement of the E2 reaction prevents the formation of the more substituted Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
