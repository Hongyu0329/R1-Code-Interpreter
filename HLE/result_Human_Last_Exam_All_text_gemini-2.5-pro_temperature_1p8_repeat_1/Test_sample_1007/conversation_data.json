    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the ballet steps to determine which one ends with the same leg position as its starting position.\n\n**1. Analyze the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a classical ballet step where the configuration of the legs at the end of the movement is identical to the configuration at the beginning. This typically means starting in fifth position with one foot in front, and after executing the step, finishing in fifth position with the very same foot in front.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** An *entrechat* is a jump in which the legs beat against each other in the air. The number indicates the total number of leg movements (openings and closings). A key rule for *entrechats* is that even-numbered ones (deux, quatre, six, huit) always land in the same position they started in. Odd-numbered ones (trois, cinq, sept) land on one foot with the other in cou-de-pied, having changed the potential front foot. An *entrechat six* involves three changes of the feet in the air, resulting in the original foot returning to the front upon landing.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, with the same foot in front as the start.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The name and classification of this step directly define its ending relative to its start. This makes it a very strong candidate.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** This step involves three key actions. *Échappé* is a jump from a closed position to an open one (e.g., fifth to second). *Battu* indicates a beat of the legs during the movement. Most importantly, *changé* means \"changed.\" This explicitly states that the feet will change position. The step finishes with a second jump, closing from the open position back to fifth, but with the opposite foot now in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, but with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The word *changé* in the name makes it definitively incorrect.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Usually begins in fifth position before the working leg brushes out.\n    *   **Movement:** The name means \"to assemble.\" One leg brushes out (to the side, front, or back), and the dancer jumps off the supporting leg to \"assemble\" both legs together in the air before landing on both feet in fifth position. The most common forms of *assemblé* are *dessus* (over) and *dessous* (under), both of which cause the feet to change positions. For instance, in an *assemblé dessous*, the front foot brushes out and closes in the back.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Usually changes.\n    *   **Careful Point:** While a non-changing *assemblé* is technically possible, it is not the standard or most common form. The common forms change the feet.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position.\n    *   **Movement:** A *glissade* is a gliding, linking step. The term *derrière* (\"behind\") can be interpreted differently depending on the ballet school. In some schools (like the Vaganova method), a basic *glissade* is assumed to be *changé* unless otherwise specified. A *glissade* closing *derrière* would therefore change the feet. In other schools (like the Cecchetti method), a *glissade derrière* can be a non-changing step.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Ambiguous depending on the specific technique being followed.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The terminology is not universally consistent, making this a less reliable answer than other options. Given that a very common execution of this step *does* change the feet, it is likely incorrect in the context of a multiple-choice question seeking a single best answer.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** This is a decorative jumping step, often described as a *pas de chat* with a circular motion (*rond de jambe*) from each leg. In its standard execution, the dancer jumps, performs the two quick circular leg movements, and lands back in the original fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Fifth position, with the same foot in front as the start.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Like *entrechat six*, the standard form of this step does not change the leg position.\n\n**3. Final Comparison and Conclusion**\nBoth **A (Entrechat six)** and **E (Gargouillade)** are steps that, in their standard form, start and end in the same leg position. However, in ballet pedagogy, the classification of *entrechats* into even and odd numbers is fundamentally based on whether the final position is the same or changed. This quality is intrinsic to the name and definition of an *entrechat six*. For a *gargouillade*, while the standard form does not change, its defining characteristic is the decorative *rond de jambe* action, not its ending configuration. Therefore, *Entrechat six* is the most definitive and fundamentally correct answer, as its sameness of start and end positions is a core part of its identity.\n\n<<<A>>>"
