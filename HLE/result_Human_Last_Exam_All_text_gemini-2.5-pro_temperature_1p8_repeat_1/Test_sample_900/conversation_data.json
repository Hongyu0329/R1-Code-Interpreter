    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Piece:** \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"\n    *   **Choreographer:** William Forsythe\n    *   **Specific Scene:** The \"Jete Woman\" solo (also known as the Gigue variation)\n    *   **Company & Year:** Semperoper Ballett, 2015\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Gileva\n    *   **Step to Count:** \"pas de Balanchine\"\n\n2.  **Define the \"Pas de Balanchine\":**\n    *   The \"pas de Balanchine\" is a specific ballet step popularized by choreographer George Balanchine.\n    *   It is a traveling step that moves to the side. It begins with a small jump or jeté to the side, landing on one foot in a deep plié with the legs crossed (croisé), followed by a step onto the other foot, and a close.\n    *   It has a distinct, syncopated, swinging quality. It's crucial not to confuse it with other side-traveling steps like a *chassé*, *glissade*, or a simple *jeté à la seconde*.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography of the \"Jete Woman\" Solo:**\n    *   William Forsythe's choreography in \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" is famous for taking classical ballet technique and pushing it to its physical and stylistic limits. It is characterized by off-balance positions, extreme speed, hyperextensions, and sharp, angular movements.\n    *   The \"Jete Woman\" solo specifically is a showcase of power and virtuosity. Its primary movements include:\n        *   **Grand Jetés:** The signature move of the solo.\n        *   **Piqué Turns:** Fast, sharp turns on pointe.\n        *   **Chaîné Turns:** Rapid series of turns.\n        *   **Chassés:** Sliding steps used to prepare for larger jumps.\n        *   **Deep Lunges and Pliés:** Used to generate power and create dramatic shapes.\n        *   **Distorted Arabesques and Attitudes:** Classical lines are broken and twisted.\n\n4.  **Review the Performance for the Specific Step:**\n    *   A careful review of Svetlana Gileva's performance (and other performances of this iconic solo) is required to identify the specific steps used.\n    *   Upon watching the choreography, we observe numerous fast traveling steps and jumps. However, the specific, syncopated, three-part movement that defines the \"pas de Balanchine\" is not part of the standard choreography for this variation.\n    *   Forsythe's movement vocabulary in this solo relies on more direct and aggressive steps like powerful chassés to build momentum into the large jetés, rather than the lilting quality of a \"pas de Balanchine\".\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   While Forsythe's work is heavily influenced by Balanchine's neoclassicism (particularly in its speed and complexity), the specific step known as the \"pas de Balanchine\" is not present in the choreography of the Jete Woman solo in \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\". Therefore, Svetlana Gileva performed zero pas de Balanchines.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of pas de Balanchines performed in this solo is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
