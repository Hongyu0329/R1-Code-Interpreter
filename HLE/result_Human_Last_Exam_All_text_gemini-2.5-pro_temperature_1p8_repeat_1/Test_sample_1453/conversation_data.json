    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Structure of a Coiled-Coil**\n\nCoiled-coils consist of two or more alpha-helices wrapped around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeat, called a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n\n*   **Positions `a` and `d`**: These are the core positions. The amino acid side chains at these positions are buried in the interface between the helices and are therefore almost always hydrophobic. Their size and shape are critical for determining the oligomeric state.\n*   **Positions `e` and `g`**: These are flanking positions, often occupied by charged or polar residues that form electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices, further stabilizing the structure.\n*   **Positions `b`, `c`, and `f`**: These are solvent-exposed positions and are typically occupied by hydrophilic residues.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat Register**\n\nThe key to analyzing the sequence is to find the correct `abcdefg` register. We do this by testing all seven possible starting positions (phases) for the repeat and looking for the one that places hydrophobic residues most consistently at the `a` and `d` positions. A critical clue in this sequence is the presence of a single Tryptophan (`W`), a large, bulky, hydrophobic residue. It is extremely likely to be in a buried core position (`a` or `d`).\n\nLet's analyze the most plausible register. We will test the register where the first `I` (Isoleucine) of the sequence is at an `a` position. This is a common starting point as `I` is a bulky hydrophobic residue often found in the core.\n\nSequence: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\nLet's assign positions assuming the `I` at position 3 is in the `a` position.\nPositions: `g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f`\nThis alignment is incorrect. Let's systematically assign the repeat.\n\nLet's test the phase where `a` starts at position 3 (`I`):\n`Sequence:   G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n`Position:   f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d`\n\nLet's list the residues at the core positions for this register:\n*   **`a` positions (I, I, I, I)**: The residues at positions 3, 10, 17, and 24 are `I`, `I`, `I`, `I`. This is a perfectly consistent layer of isoleucine, a beta-branched hydrophobic residue. This provides a very strong and stable hydrophobic interface.\n*   **`d` positions (S, S, W, S)**: The residues at positions 6, 13, 20, and 27 are `S`, `S`, `W`, `S`. This layer is mostly composed of Serine (`S`), which is polar, with one large hydrophobic Tryptophan (`W`).\n\nThis register is highly plausible because:\n1.  The `a` layer is perfectly hydrophobic and uniform, which is a powerful driver for coiled-coil formation.\n2.  The bulky, hydrophobic Tryptophan (`W`) is correctly placed in a buried `d` core position.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Core Packing to the Oligomeric State**\n\nNow we analyze the pattern of the core positions (`a=I`, `d=mostly S`) to determine the oligomeric state (number of helices).\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices) & Trimer (3 helices)**: These structures are typically stabilized by a continuous hydrophobic core. They almost always have hydrophobic residues at *both* the `a` and `d` positions. The presence of a predominantly polar `d` layer (three Serines) would be highly destabilizing for a standard dimer or trimer, making these states unlikely.\n\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices)**: Parallel four-helix bundles have a different packing geometry. The `a` positions pack against `a` positions on adjacent helices, while the `d` positions pack against each other across the center of the bundle. This geometry can uniquely accommodate polar residues at one of the core positions (usually `d`). A common tetrameric motif is `a=hydrophobic` and `d=polar`. The polar `d` residues can form a stabilizing hydrogen-bond network within the core.\n    *   In our sequence, the `a=I` layer provides the classic hydrophobic \"knobs-into-holes\" packing on the outside of the core.\n    *   The `d=mostly S` layer fits the description of a polar core. The Serine residues can hydrogen bond with each other in the center of the tetramer, conferring specificity and stability. The lone Tryptophan at a `d` position is a perturbation but doesn't change the overall polar character of that layer, which dictates the tetrameric structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence pattern, with a consistently hydrophobic `a` layer (`I,I,I,I`) and a predominantly polar `d` layer (`S,S,W,S`), is a classic signature of a **parallel tetrameric coiled-coil**.\n\n<<<C>>>"
