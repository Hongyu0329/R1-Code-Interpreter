    "Answering this question requires a careful understanding of the term \"historical saint\" and a thorough knowledge of the text of John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n**Step 1: Defining \"Historical Saint\"**\nFirst, we must define what is meant by a \"historical saint.\" In this context, it typically refers to a holy person from the post-biblical era (i.e., after the time of the Apostles, circa 100 AD) who has been formally recognized or venerated as a saint by a major Christian tradition (like the Catholic or Orthodox Churches). This definition is important because it distinguishes these figures from:\n*   **Biblical Figures:** Characters from the Old and New Testaments, such as Abraham, Moses, David, St. Peter, or St. Paul. While they are considered saints, they are biblical, not \"historical\" in the post-apostolic sense.\n*   **Angels:** Beings like Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael, who are central to the poem but are not human saints.\n\n**Step 2: Considering Milton's Theological Position**\nJohn Milton was a 17th-century Puritan. This is a crucial point because his religious convictions deeply influenced the content of *Paradise Lost*.\n*   **Anti-Catholicism:** Milton was strongly opposed to the Roman Catholic Church. He viewed many of its practices, including the canonization and veneration of saints, the monastic tradition, and the authority of the Pope, as corruptions of true Christianity.\n*   **Sola Scriptura:** As a Protestant, Milton's theology was rooted in the principle of *sola scriptura* (scripture alone). His epic is therefore grounded almost exclusively in the Bible, not in later church traditions or hagiography (writings about saints' lives).\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Text of *Paradise Lost***\nWith the definition and Milton's context in mind, we can analyze the poem itself. *Paradise Lost* is focused on the biblical narrative of the temptation of Adam and Eve and their expulsion from Eden.\n*   **Main Characters:** The characters mentioned by name are almost exclusively from the Bible (God, the Son, Adam, Eve, Satan), are angels (Michael, Raphael), or are figures from classical mythology and pagan religion that Milton equates with fallen angels (e.g., Moloch, Belial, Mammon).\n*   **Visions of the Future (Books XI and XII):** The most likely place to find mentions of later historical figures is in the vision of the future that the Archangel Michael shows to Adam. However, this section covers:\n    1.  Old Testament history (Cain and Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David).\n    2.  The life of Christ and the work of the Apostles.\n    3.  A highly critical and general description of the corruption of the Church. Milton writes of \"grievous Wolves\" who will \"succeed for teachers\" but he purposefully *does not name* specific historical individuals from church history in a positive light.\n*   **Negative References:** Milton does allude to the later Church, but in a negative way. In Book III, he describes a \"Limbo of Vanity\" where \"Eremites and Friars\" (hermits and monks, a key source of Catholic saints) are blown about. He also mentions Emperor Constantine, but criticizes him for corrupting the Church with wealth and power, not venerating him as a saint.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nGiven Milton's staunch Protestant beliefs and his poem's strict focus on biblical narrative, he does not mention any post-biblical, historical saints by name in a laudatory or neutral way. His project was to create a biblical epic, and including figures from what he considered a corrupted church history would have been contrary to his purpose.\n\nTherefore, the number of historical saints mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost* is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
