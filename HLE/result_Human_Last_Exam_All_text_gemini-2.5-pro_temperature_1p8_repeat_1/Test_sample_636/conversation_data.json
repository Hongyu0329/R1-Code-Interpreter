    "This problem requires finding a state feedback gain matrix `F` for a linear system defined by matrices `A` and `B`, such that the resulting closed-loop system `A + BF` has a specific set of eigenvalues.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe problem can be broken down into the following steps:\n1.  **Define the Desired System Behavior:** The target eigenvalues are given as `-1 ± j`. These eigenvalues dictate the desired characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system.\n2.  **Formulate the Closed-Loop System:** The state feedback control law is applied to the system, resulting in a closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`. We need to express this matrix in terms of the unknown elements of the feedback gain matrix `F`.\n3.  **Determine the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System:** We will calculate the characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` in terms of the elements of `F`. For a 2x2 matrix, this is `λ² - tr(A_cl)λ + det(A_cl) = 0`.\n4.  **Equate Polynomials and Solve for F:** By equating the coefficients of the actual characteristic polynomial with those of the desired one, we get a system of algebraic equations.\n5.  **Solve the System of Equations:** This system will have the elements of `F` as unknowns. We need to solve it to find the values for the gain matrix.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Eigenvalues to Polynomial:** A pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues `a ± bj` corresponds to a characteristic polynomial `(λ - (a+bj))(λ - (a-bj)) = λ² - 2aλ + a² + b²`. It is crucial to calculate this correctly.\n*   **Matrix Algebra:** The calculation of `A + BF` must be performed accurately. `F` will be a 2x2 matrix, let's say `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`.\n*   **Non-Uniqueness of the Solution:** The system is a Multi-Input system (B has two columns). Pole placement for multi-input systems generally does not have a unique solution for the feedback gain `F`. We will have more unknowns (4 elements in `F`) than equations (2 from the polynomial coefficients). We can find one possible solution by making a simplifying assumption, such as setting some elements of `F` to zero.\n*   **Verification:** After finding a candidate `F`, it is a good practice to compute `A + BF` and verify that its eigenvalues are indeed the ones desired.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are `λ₁ = -1 + j` and `λ₂ = -1 - j`.\nThe desired characteristic polynomial `p_d(λ)` is:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ + 1)² - j² = λ² + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p_d(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Closed-Loop Matrix `A + BF`**\nLet the state feedback gain matrix be `F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]]`.\nThe closed-loop system matrix `A_cl` is `A + BF`.\nFirst, calculate `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\nNow, calculate `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]`\n\n**Step 3: Find the Characteristic Polynomial of `A_cl`**\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `p_actual(λ) = λ² - tr(A_cl)λ + det(A_cl)`.\n*   Trace of `A_cl`:\n    `tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃) + f₂ = f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1`\n*   Determinant of `A_cl`:\n    `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃)(f₂) - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - 1 - f₁ - f₂ - f₁f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄`\n    `det(A_cl) = -1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄`\n\nSo, `p_actual(λ) = λ² - (f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1)λ + (-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄)`.\n\n**Step 4: Equate Coefficients**\nWe match the coefficients of `p_actual(λ)` with `p_d(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2`.\n1.  Coefficient of λ: `- (f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1) = 2  =>  f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1`\n2.  Constant term: `-1 - f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 2  =>  -f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 3`\n\n**Step 5: Solve for `F`**\nWe have two equations with four unknowns. The system is underdetermined, meaning there are infinite solutions. Let's find a simple solution by setting `f₃ = 0` and `f₄ = 0`.\nThe equations become:\n1.  `f₁ + f₂ = -1`\n2.  `-f₁ - 2f₂ = 3`\n\nNow, solve this simpler system. Add the two equations together:\n`(f₁ + f₂) + (-f₁ - 2f₂) = -1 + 3`\n`-f₂ = 2`\n`f₂ = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f₂ = -2` into the first equation:\n`f₁ + (-2) = -1`\n`f₁ = 1`\n\nThus, one possible solution is `f₁=1, f₂=-2, f₃=0, f₄=0`.\n\nThe state feedback gain matrix is `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`.\n\nLet's quickly verify this solution.\nIf `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`, then `A_cl = [[-1 + 1, 1 - 2], [1 + 1, -2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`.\nThe characteristic polynomial is `det(λI - A_cl) = det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ² + 2λ + 2`.\nThis matches the desired polynomial, confirming the solution is correct.\n\n<<<F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
