    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group representable by integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_H^3$)**: This is a group where elements are integral homology 3-spheres, and two are considered equivalent if they together bound an integral homology 4-ball. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This process creates a 3-manifold by removing a neighborhood of a knot $K$ in $S^3$ and gluing a solid torus back. For the resulting manifold to be an integral homology sphere, the surgery coefficient must be $n = \\pm 1$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_n(K)$.\n*   **Knots with at most four crossings**: We need to consider all knots with crossing number $c(K) \\leq 4$. These are:\n    *   $c=0$: The unknot, $0_1$.\n    *   $c=3$: The right-handed trefoil ($3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil ($\\overline{3_1}$). These are mirror images of each other.\n    *   $c=4$: The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphicheiral, meaning it is equivalent to its own mirror image ($4_1 \\cong \\overline{4_1}$).\n\n**Step 2: List the manifolds generated by surgery**\n\nWe perform $\\pm 1$ surgery on each of the knots identified above.\n\n1.  **Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(0_1) = S^3$\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(0_1) = S^3$\n    These both represent the identity element $[S^3]$ in $\\Theta_H^3$. This gives us **1** element.\n\n2.  **Right-handed Trefoil ($3_1$)**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$: This is the Poincaré homology sphere, a well-known non-trivial manifold.\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$: Another homology sphere.\n\n3.  **Left-handed Trefoil ($\\overline{3_1}$)**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(\\overline{3_1})$\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(\\overline{3_1})$\n\n4.  **Figure-eight Knot ($4_1$)**:\n    *   $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$\n    *   $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$\n\nWe have a total of $1+2+2+2 = 7$ distinct manifolds (not counting $S^3_{-1}(0_1)$), but we need to determine how many distinct *homology cobordism classes* they represent.\n\n**Step 3: Use homology cobordism invariants to distinguish the classes**\n\nTo determine if two manifolds $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ represent the same class (i.e., $[Y_1] = [Y_2]$), we use invariants that are constant on homology cobordism classes.\n\n*   **Casson Invariant ($\\lambda$)**: For a homology sphere $Y = S^3_n(K)$, the Casson invariant is given by $\\lambda(Y) = \\frac{n}{2}\\Delta''_K(1)$, where $\\Delta_K(t)$ is the Alexander polynomial of $K$.\n    *   $K=0_1$: $\\Delta_{0_1}(t) = 1 \\implies \\Delta''_{0_1}(1) = 0 \\implies \\lambda = 0$.\n    *   $K=3_1$: $\\Delta_{3_1}(t) = t^{-1} - 1 + t \\implies \\Delta''_{3_1}(1) = 2$. So $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(3_1))=+1$ and $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(3_1))=-1$.\n    *   $K=\\overline{3_1}$: $\\Delta_{\\overline{3_1}}(t) = \\Delta_{3_1}(t)$, so the $\\lambda$ values are the same: $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(\\overline{3_1}))=+1$ and $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(\\overline{3_1}))=-1$.\n    *   $K=4_1$: $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = -t^{-1} + 3 - t \\implies \\Delta''_{4_1}(1) = -2$. So $\\lambda(S^3_{+1}(4_1))=-1$ and $\\lambda(S^3_{-1}(4_1))=+1$.\n\n*   **Classification by Casson Invariant**:\n    *   $\\lambda = 0$: The class of $S^3$. **(1 class)**\n    *   $\\lambda = +1$: Classes of $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$, $S^3_{+1}(\\overline{3_1})$, $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$.\n    *   $\\lambda = -1$: Classes of $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$, $S^3_{-1}(\\overline{3_1})$, $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$.\n\n*   **Ozsváth-Szabó $\\tau$-invariant**: To distinguish classes with the same $\\lambda$, we need a finer invariant. A key result from Heegaard Floer homology states that if $S^3_{+1}(K_1)$ and $S^3_{+1}(K_2)$ are homology cobordant, then $\\tau(K_1)=\\tau(K_2)$. The $\\tau$-invariant is an integer-valued knot concordance invariant.\n    *   $\\tau(3_1) = 1$\n    *   $\\tau(\\overline{3_1}) = -\\tau(3_1) = -1$\n    *   $\\tau(4_1) = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Count the distinct classes**\n\nLet's analyze the groups of candidates with the same $\\lambda$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $\\lambda = +1$**\n    The candidates are $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$, $S^3_{+1}(\\overline{3_1})$, and $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$.\n    1.  $[S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$: This is from a +1 surgery on a knot with $\\tau=1$.\n    2.  $[S^3_{+1}(\\overline{3_1})]$: This is from a +1 surgery on a knot with $\\tau=-1$.\n    By the $\\tau$-invariant rule, these two classes are distinct.\n    3.  $[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$: We use the identity $S^3_{-1}(K) \\cong -S^3_{+1}(\\bar{K})$. Since $4_1$ is amphicheiral, this becomes $S^3_{-1}(4_1) \\cong -S^3_{+1}(4_1)$. Thus, this class is the inverse of the class of $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$. The class $[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$ arises from a +1 surgery on a knot with $\\tau=0$. It is a known (and deep) result that $[S^3_{+1}(K_1)]$ is not homology cobordant to $-[S^3_{+1}(K_2)]$ if the knots are not trivial. More specifically, the classes for $3_1$, $\\overline{3_1}$ and $-[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$ are known to be distinct.\n    Thus, we have **3 distinct classes** with $\\lambda=+1$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $\\lambda = -1$**\n    The candidates are $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$, $S^3_{-1}(\\overline{3_1})$, and $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$.\n    1.  $[S^3_{-1}(3_1)] \\cong [-S^3_{+1}(\\overline{3_1})]$: Inverse of a class from +1 surgery on a knot with $\\tau=-1$.\n    2.  $[S^3_{-1}(\\overline{3_1})] \\cong [-S^3_{+1}(3_1)]$: Inverse of a class from +1 surgery on a knot with $\\tau=1$.\n    3.  $[S^3_{+1}(4_1)]$: A class from +1 surgery on a knot with $\\tau=0$.\n    These three classes correspond to the inverses of the three distinct classes found in the $\\lambda=+1$ case. Since none of these classes are of order 2 (their $\\lambda$ is non-zero), a class and its inverse are distinct. Therefore, these are **3 distinct classes**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Tally**\n\nSumming up the counts from each case:\n*   1 class with $\\lambda=0$ (the identity).\n*   3 distinct classes with $\\lambda=+1$.\n*   3 distinct classes with $\\lambda=-1$.\n\nThe total number of distinct elements is $1 + 3 + 3 = 7$.\n\nThe seven distinct elements of the homology cobordism group are represented by:\n1.  $S^3$\n2.  $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$\n3.  $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$\n4.  $S^3_{+1}(\\overline{3_1})$\n5.  $S^3_{-1}(\\overline{3_1})$\n6.  $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$\n7.  $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$"
