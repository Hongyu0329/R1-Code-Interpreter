    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question and define the terms\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes (point groups) that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image.\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal does not have a unique direction which results in a spontaneous electric dipole moment (i.e., it is not pyroelectric).\n3.  **Correct symmetry for optical activity**: The crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\nLet's define the symmetry requirements for each of these properties.\n\n*   **Chirality**: A crystal class is **chiral** if it only contains proper rotation axes. It is **achiral** if it contains at least one improper rotation axis. Improper rotations include an inversion center ($i$ or $\\bar{1}$), a mirror plane ($m$), or a rotoinversion axis ($\\bar{n}$). There are 11 chiral classes and 21 achiral classes out of the 32 total crystal classes.\n\n*   **Polarity**: A crystal class is **polar** if there is at least one direction in the crystal that is not related to its inverse by any symmetry operation of the point group. This property is found in 10 specific crystal classes, which are also known as the pyroelectric classes. A class is **non-polar** if it is not polar. The presence of a center of inversion or a mirror plane perpendicular to a rotation axis, or a 2-fold axis perpendicular to another rotation axis, prevents polarity. All centrosymmetric classes are non-polar.\n\n*   **Optical Activity**: Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of linearly polarized light. The necessary and sufficient symmetry condition for a crystal to exhibit optical activity (i.e., to have a non-zero gyration tensor) is that its point group must be **non-centrosymmetric**. A centrosymmetric crystal (one with a center of inversion, $\\bar{1}$) cannot be optically active. While it is often stated as a simplified rule that only chiral materials are optically active, this is incorrect. Several achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes also permit optical activity.\n\n### Step 2: Systematically apply the conditions to filter the 32 crystal classes\n\nWe need to find the intersection of three sets of crystal classes: {Achiral} $\\cap$ {Non-polar} $\\cap$ {Non-centrosymmetric}.\n\n1.  **Condition: \"Correct symmetry for optical activity\" (Non-centrosymmetric)**\n    This condition immediately eliminates the 11 centrosymmetric crystal classes:\n    $\\bar{1}$, $2/m$, $mmm$, $\\bar{3}$, $\\bar{3}m$, $4/m$, $4/mmm$, $6/m$, $6/mmm$, $m\\bar{3}$, $m\\bar{3}m$.\n    This leaves us with the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes.\n\n2.  **Condition: \"Achiral\"**\n    From the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, we must now select those that are achiral. The non-centrosymmetric classes can be divided into two groups:\n    *   **Chiral (11 classes)**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432. These must be excluded.\n    *   **Achiral and Non-centrosymmetric (10 classes)**: $m$, $mm2$, $3m$, $4mm$, $6mm$, $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}m2$, $4\\bar{3}m$.\n    This step narrows our search down to these 10 classes.\n\n3.  **Condition: \"Non-polar\"**\n    Finally, we must apply the non-polar condition to the remaining 10 classes. We need to identify and remove the polar classes from this list. The 10 polar (pyroelectric) classes are:\n    *   1, 2, 3, 4, 6 (which are chiral and have already been excluded).\n    *   $m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm$ (which are from our list of 10 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes).\n    Removing these five polar classes from our list of 10 candidates leaves us with the final answer.\n\nThe remaining classes are:\n*   $\\bar{4}$\n*   $\\bar{4}2m$\n*   $\\bar{6}$\n*   $\\bar{6}m2$\n*   $4\\bar{3}m$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Optical Activity vs. Chirality**: It is a common misconception that only chiral substances can be optically active. The true requirement is the absence of a center of symmetry. Achiral but non-centrosymmetric crystals can and do exhibit optical activity.\n*   **Definition of Polarity**: A polar crystal has a net dipole moment. All polar classes are non-centrosymmetric, but not all non-centrosymmetric classes are polar.\n*   **Hermann-Mauguin Notation**: This notation is used to unambiguously identify the crystal classes and their key symmetry elements.\n\n### Final List of Crystal Classes\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric) are the five classes that satisfy all conditions.\n\nFinal list (in Hermann-Mauguin notation):\n1.  **$\\bar{4}$**\n2.  **$\\bar{4}2m$**\n3.  **$\\bar{6}$**\n4.  **$\\bar{6}m2$**\n5.  **$4\\bar{3}m$**\n\nThese five crystal classes meet all the specified criteria.\n\n<<<The five crystal classes are $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, $\\bar{6}$, $\\bar{6}m2$, and $4\\bar{3}m$.>>>"
