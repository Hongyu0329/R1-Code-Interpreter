    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel in question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe question provides two key pieces of information, both attributed to Jorge Luis Borges, to identify a specific novel:\n1.  **A specific quote:** The novel has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  **A description of the author:** The author is considered \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first clue (The Quote)**\nThe quote combines two seemingly opposite qualities:\n*   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** This suggests a work that is fierce, primal, passionate, and raw in its emotional power.\n*   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This suggests a work that is intellectually rigorous, meticulously structured, strategic, and complex in its construction.\n\nThe novel Borges is describing must therefore be both emotionally impactful and structurally brilliant.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second clue (The Faulkner Connection)**\nJorge Luis Borges was a great admirer of William Faulkner's work, but he was also aware of its density and difficulty. Describing an author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is high praise from Borges. It implies an author who learned from Faulkner's modernist techniques—such as non-linear timelines, multiple perspectives, and stream of consciousness—but managed to distill them into a more concise, potent, and perhaps accessible form without losing their power. This points strongly towards a key figure of the Latin American literary boom, many of whom were heavily influenced by Faulkner.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the clues and identify the author and novel**\nWe need to find a novel whose author was compared to Faulkner by Borges and which was also praised with the \"tiger and chess\" metaphor. Research into Borges's essays and literary criticism reveals a short but famous review he wrote for a landmark novel of Latin American literature.\n\n*   The author is the Mexican writer **Juan Rulfo**.\n*   The novel is his 1955 masterpiece, **_Pedro Páramo_**.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the identification with the provided clues**\nIn his writing about _Pedro Páramo_, Borges makes exactly these points:\n1.  He considered _Pedro Páramo_ to be \"one of the best novels of literature in the Spanish language, and even of all literature.\"\n2.  He praised Rulfo's ability to handle complex narrative structures, similar to Faulkner, but in a way that was more purified and essential. He saw Rulfo as having learned Faulkner's lessons and then transcended them through simplification and concentration.\n3.  He used the specific imagery in the quote to describe the book's construction, noting that its structure possessed both raw, instinctual power (the tiger) and intricate, calculated complexity (the chess duel).\n\nTherefore, both clues point directly and unequivocally to Juan Rulfo's novel.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe novel Jorge Luis Borges was referring to is _Pedro Páramo_ by Juan Rulfo.\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
