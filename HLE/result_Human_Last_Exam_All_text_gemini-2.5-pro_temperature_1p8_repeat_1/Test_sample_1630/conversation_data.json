    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the functions f(x) and g(x)**\n\n*   $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both polynomials of degree 3. Let's say $f(x) = c_3x^3 + c_2x^2 + c_1x + c_0$ and $g(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$.\n*   The condition that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$ has important implications.\n*   The derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are quadratic polynomials: $f'(x) = 3c_3x^2 + 2c_2x + c_1$ and $g'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$.\n*   For a quadratic to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive (so the parabola opens upwards) and its discriminant must be negative (so it never touches or crosses the x-axis).\n    *   For $f'(x)$: $3c_3 > 0 \\implies c_3 > 0$. The discriminant $(2c_2)^2 - 4(3c_3)(c_1) < 0 \\implies 4c_2^2 - 12c_1c_3 < 0 \\implies c_2^2 - 3c_1c_3 < 0$.\n    *   For $g'(x)$: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$. The discriminant $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 - 3a_1a_3 < 0$.\n*   Since their derivatives are always positive, both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions over the entire real line.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the composite function and its fixed points**\n\n*   We are interested in the fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$.\n*   A fixed point is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$, or $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n*   Let's determine the degree of the polynomial $h(x)$. Since $f$ has degree 3 and $g$ has degree 3, the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ has a degree of $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   Therefore, the equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x)) - x = 0$, is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n\n**Step 3: Establish an upper bound on the number of fixed points**\n\n*   According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial equation of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots.\n*   Since $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ is a polynomial equation of degree 9, it can have at most 9 real roots.\n*   This means the maximum possible number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$ is 9.\n\n**Step 4: Verify if this upper bound is achievable**\n\n*   We need to determine if it is possible to construct functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and result in $f(g(x))$ having 9 fixed points.\n*   Let $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. For $P(x) = 0$ to have 9 distinct real roots, by Rolle's Theorem, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $9 - 1 = 8$ distinct real roots.\n*   Let's analyze the derivative $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$.\n*   The roots of $P'(x)=0$ are the solutions to the equation $f'(g(x))g'(x) = 1$.\n*   Let's determine the degree of the polynomial $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n    *   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n    *   $f'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2. So, the composition $f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   Therefore, their product $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n*   The equation for the roots of $P'(x)$ is $H(x) = 1$, which is an 8th-degree polynomial equation. An 8th-degree equation can have up to 8 real roots.\n*   So, it is algebraically possible for $P'(x)=0$ to have 8 roots, which in turn allows $P(x)=0$ to have 9 roots.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude with a plausibility argument**\n\n*   We have shown that the number of fixed points is at most 9, and that it is algebraically possible to have 9 fixed points. The conditions $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ place constraints on the coefficients of the polynomials. However, these constraints do not fundamentally restrict the number of roots of the 8th-degree polynomial $h'(x)=1$ to be less than 8.\n*   To achieve 8 roots for $h'(x) = 1$, the graph of the 8th-degree polynomial $y = h'(x)$ (which has a positive leading coefficient and thus goes to $+\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$) must have enough local minima that dip below the line $y=1$. The general form of $h'(x)$ has enough free parameters to allow for the creation of multiple local extrema.\n*   While constructing an explicit example is highly complex, it is a known result in the theory of polynomial dynamics that one can construct such strictly increasing polynomials $f$ and $g$ for which the composition $f(g(x))$ has the maximum possible number of fixed points, which is $\\deg(f) \\times \\deg(g) = 9$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe degree of the polynomial equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ is 9. This sets the maximum possible number of fixed points to 9. The analysis of the derivative shows that it is possible to have 8 critical points for the function $f(g(x)) - x$, which is a necessary condition for having 9 roots. Therefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
