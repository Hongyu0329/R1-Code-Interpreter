    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the book of manners preserved alongside *Sir Launfal*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Specific \"Sir Launfal\":** The first crucial point is to recognize that there are several versions of the \"Sir Launfal\" story. The most famous Middle English version, and the one preserved in a key manuscript, is by a poet named Thomas Chestre. We will focus on this version as it is the one most commonly studied and the one found in the specific manuscript in question.\n\n2.  **Locate the Manuscript:** The next step is to identify the manuscript in which Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal* is preserved. The poem survives in only one manuscript copy. This manuscript is famously known as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**. It is part of the Cotton library collection, now housed in the British Library.\n\n3.  **Examine the Contents of the Manuscript:** The Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is a miscellany, meaning it is a collection of various unrelated works bound together. To answer the question, we need to know what other texts are included in this same manuscript alongside *Sir Launfal*. The manuscript contains several important Middle English works, including *Layamon's Brut* and *The Owl and the Nightingale*.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\":** The question specifically asks for a \"book of manners.\" This is a genre of literature also known as a courtesy book or a book of nurture, which gives instructions on proper social behavior, etiquette, and morals. We must scan the contents list of Cotton Caligula A.ii for a text that fits this description.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Specific Text:** Upon examining the contents of the manuscript, we find a short poem of 15 stanzas that is a classic example of a medieval book of manners. This work is a piece of instructional literature aimed at teaching children proper conduct.\n\n6.  **Name the Book of Manners:** This short courtesy poem has been given a few names by modern editors. It is most commonly known as ***The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke*** (The Little Children's Little Book). It is also sometimes referred to as *A Book of Courtesy* or known by its first line.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine that the version of *Sir Launfal* by Thomas Chestre is preserved in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii. Within this same manuscript is a short instructional poem on etiquette, which serves as the \"book of manners\" in the question.\n\n***\n\nThe book of manners preserved alongside Sir Launfal in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii is titled *The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke* (The Little Children's Little Book).\n\n<<<The Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke>>>"
