    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe user's question is to identify two specific individuals who meet a set of precise criteria:\n1.  They must be Nobel laureates.\n2.  They must have appeared in a commercial for the company Enron.\n3.  The commercial must have been part of the 2000 campaign.\n4.  The commercial must have used the tagline \"Ask Why.\"\n5.  The question notes the commercial is \"infamous,\" which is a clue relating to the irony of Enron's subsequent collapse due to fraud.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Nobel Laureate Status:** The term \"Nobel laureate\" could mean the person held the title at the time of the commercial (2000) or received it later. I need to verify the status of any potential candidates.\n2.  **Specificity of the Campaign:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a specific, well-documented advertising effort by Enron. The search must be focused on this campaign, not just any Enron commercial.\n3.  **Verifying Both Individuals:** The question asks for two people. It's crucial to confirm that both individuals appeared and that both are Nobel laureates.\n4.  **The \"Infamous\" Aspect:** This suggests looking for information related to the Enron scandal and how the ads were viewed in hindsight. This context can help confirm the correct commercial and participants.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Advertising Campaign:** Research confirms that in 2000, Enron, with the help of ad agency Ogilvy & Mather, launched a major brand campaign with the tagline \"Ask Why.\" The campaign aimed to portray Enron as an innovative and transparent market leader.\n\n2.  **Identify the Commercial's Participants:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign featured several television spots. One particularly notable commercial featured two respected economists engaged in a discussion. These two individuals were Merton Miller and Paul Krugman.\n\n3.  **Verify Nobel Laureate Status of Merton Miller:** A search confirms that Merton H. Miller was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1990**, along with Harry Markowitz and William F. Sharpe, \"for their pioneering work in the theory of financial economics.\" Since he received the prize in 1990, he was a Nobel laureate at the time the 2000 commercial was filmed.\n\n4.  **Verify Nobel Laureate Status of Paul Krugman:** A search confirms that Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008** \"for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity.\" Therefore, while he was a prominent economist in 2000, he was not yet a Nobel laureate. However, he is a Nobel laureate now. The question asks for two \"Nobel laureates,\" which is an accurate description of both men, even if one received the award after the fact.\n\n5.  **Confirm the \"Infamous\" Nature:** The commercial became infamous after Enron's massive accounting fraud was revealed in 2001. The irony of a company built on deception running a campaign with the tagline \"Ask Why\" and featuring esteemed economists was not lost on the public. Paul Krugman himself has frequently expressed his embarrassment and regret over his participation in the commercial.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the two individuals who are Nobel laureates and were featured in the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial are Merton Miller and Paul Krugman.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"
