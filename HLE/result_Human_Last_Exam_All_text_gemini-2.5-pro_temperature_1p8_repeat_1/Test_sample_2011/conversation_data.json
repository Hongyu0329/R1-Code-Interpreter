    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with $n=128$ vertices. Let's break down the components of the question:\n\n1.  **Graph on n=128 vertices:** We are considering a graph $G=(V, E)$ where the number of vertices is $|V|=128$.\n\n2.  **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices, $C \\subseteq V$, where for every two distinct vertices $u, v \\in C$, there is an edge connecting them, i.e., $\\{u,v\\} \\in E$. The size of the clique is the number of vertices in it, $|C|$.\n\n3.  **Induced Subgraph:** An induced subgraph on a subset of vertices $S \\subseteq V$ is the graph $G[S]$ with vertex set $S$ and an edge set consisting of all edges in $E$ that have both endpoints in $S$.\n\n4.  **Clique as an Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices $S$ to induce a clique, the graph $G[S]$ must be a complete graph. This is precisely the definition of $S$ being a clique in the graph $G$. So, the question is simply asking for the number of different sizes of cliques present in a graph.\n\n5.  **Maximum possible number of different clique sizes:** We need to find the maximum cardinality of the set $K_G = \\{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+ \\mid \\text{there exists a clique of size } k \\text{ in } G\\}$. We need to find $\\max_G |K_G|$ over all possible graphs $G$ with 128 vertices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nLet's find the maximum value by first establishing an upper bound and then showing that this bound can be achieved.\n\n**Step 1: Establish an upper bound**\n\nLet $G$ be any graph with $n=128$ vertices. Let $C$ be any clique in $G$. Since $C$ is a subset of the vertex set $V$, its size $|C|$ cannot be greater than the total number of vertices. So, $|C| \\le 128$.\nClique sizes are positive integers. Thus, any possible clique size $k$ must satisfy $1 \\le k \\le 128$.\nThe set of all possible clique sizes that can appear in any such graph is therefore a subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 128\\}$.\nThis means that the number of different clique sizes cannot exceed 128. This gives us an upper bound: the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is at most 128.\n\n**Step 2: Construct a graph to achieve the upper bound**\n\nNow, we need to determine if there exists a graph on 128 vertices that actually contains cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\nConsider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted as $K_{128}$. In this graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the construction**\n\nLet's check the clique sizes present in $K_{128}$. We want to show that for every integer $s$ such that $1 \\le s \\le 128$, there exists a clique of size $s$ in $K_{128}$.\nLet $V$ be the set of vertices of $K_{128}$, with $|V|=128$.\nChoose any integer $s$ in the range $1 \\le s \\le 128$.\nSince $s \\le |V|$, we can choose a subset of vertices $C \\subseteq V$ such that $|C|=s$.\nNow, consider any two distinct vertices $u,v \\in C$. By the definition of a complete graph, since $u$ and $v$ are vertices in $K_{128}$, there is an edge $\\{u,v\\}$.\nThis holds for all pairs of distinct vertices in $C$. Therefore, $C$ is a clique of size $s$.\nSince we can do this for any integer $s$ from 1 to 128, the graph $K_{128}$ contains cliques of all sizes $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 128\\}$.\nThe number of different clique sizes in $K_{128}$ is therefore 128.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown two things:\n1.  No graph on 128 vertices can have more than 128 different clique sizes.\n2.  The complete graph $K_{128}$ is a graph on 128 vertices that has exactly 128 different clique sizes.\n\nCombining these two facts, we conclude that the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Clique vs. Maximal Clique:** The term \"clique\" in graph theory refers to any subset of vertices that is fully connected. It is not required to be a *maximal* clique (a clique that cannot be extended by adding another vertex). If the question had intended maximal cliques, it would have been specified. This distinction is crucial, as the answer for maximal cliques would be significantly smaller (likely 16).\n*   **Disjoint vs. Overlapping Cliques:** An initial thought might be to construct a graph from disjoint cliques. For example, to get $k$ different clique sizes $1, 2, \\dots, k$, we could form a graph as the disjoint union $K_1 \\cup K_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup K_k$. The total number of vertices would be $\\sum_{i=1}^k i = k(k+1)/2$. For this to be at most 128, the maximum possible value for $k$ is 15. This demonstrates that restricting to disjoint cliques yields a much lower result and that allowing cliques to share vertices (as in the complete graph, where cliques are nested) is key to achieving the maximum.\n*   **Clique of Size 1:** A single vertex forms a clique of size 1. The condition for a set of vertices to be a clique is vacuously true for a set with one vertex, as there are no pairs of distinct vertices. Any graph with at least one vertex has a clique of size 1.\n*   **Clique of Size 0:** The empty set is sometimes considered a clique of size 0. However, in the context of graph properties like clique number, sizes are typically considered positive integers. We follow the standard convention that clique sizes are positive.\n\nFinal Answer: The analysis demonstrates that the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is bounded by the number of vertices, and this bound is achieved by the complete graph.\n\n<<<128>>>"
