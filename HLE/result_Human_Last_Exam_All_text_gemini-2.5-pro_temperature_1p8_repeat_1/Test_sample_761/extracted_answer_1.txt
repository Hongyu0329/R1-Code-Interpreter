No, polynucleotides (including homopolynucleotides) are not, structurally, polysaccharides. They are a distinct class of macromolecules (nucleic acids) with different monomers (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), different backbone structures (sugar-phosphate vs. sugar-only), different linking bonds (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic), and different elemental composition (containing nitrogen and phosphorus, which polysaccharides lack).
