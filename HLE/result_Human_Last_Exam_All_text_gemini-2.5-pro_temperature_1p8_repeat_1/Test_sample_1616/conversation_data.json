    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understand Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing (or Trisyllabic Shortening) is a historical sound change in English where a long, tense vowel becomes short and lax. The rule applies under specific conditions:\n*   The word must have at least three syllables.\n*   The vowel in question must be in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end) or a syllable before it.\n*   The vowel must have been historically long.\n\nA classic pattern is seen in pairs like `serene` /səˈriːn/ (with a long/tense vowel /iː/) and `serenity` /səˈrɛnəti/ (where the vowel becomes the short/lax /ɛ/ because it's now in the third syllable from the end).\n\n**2. Analyze Each Word**\n\nLet's examine each word against the criteria for Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL).\n\n*   **southern**:\n    *   **Etymology**: From Middle English *sūtherne*, from Old English *sūþerne*.\n    *   **Analysis**: The Middle English form *sū-ther-ne* had three syllables. The stressed vowel was a long /uː/ (from OE *sūþ* 'south'). Because this long vowel was in the antepenultimate syllable, it shortened (laxed) to /ʊ/, which later developed into the modern /ʌ/ sound.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**:\n    *   **Etymology**: From Latin *dērīvātīvus*. Related to the verb `derive`.\n    *   **Analysis**: The verb `derive` has a tense diphthong /aɪ/, which comes from a historically long vowel (Middle English long /iː/). In the four-syllable word `de-riv-a-tive`, the stress falls on the antepenultimate syllable `-riv-`. The historically long vowel shortens to /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**:\n    *   **Etymology**: From Latin *serēnitātem*. Related to the adjective `serene`.\n    *   **Analysis**: This is the textbook example. The adjective `serene` has a long/tense vowel /iː/ (from Middle English long /eː/). When the suffix `-ity` is added, the word becomes `se-ren-i-ty` (four syllables). The stress is on the antepenultimate syllable `-ren-`, causing the long vowel to shorten (lax) to /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**:\n    *   **Etymology**: From Old French *plaisant*. Related to the verb `please`.\n    *   **Analysis**: The word `pleasant` has only two syllables. Trisyllabic laxing, by definition, requires a word of at least three syllables. Therefore, this rule cannot apply. While its vowel /ɛ/ is short compared to the long vowel /iː/ in `please`, the shortening is due to other historical reasons (e.g., its French origin, pre-cluster shortening), not TSL.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Has not undergone** trisyllabic laxing because it does not meet the syllable-count condition.\n\n*   **gratitude**:\n    *   **Etymology**: From Latin *grātitūdō*. Related to `grateful`.\n    *   **Analysis**: The root vowel can be seen as long in the related word `grateful` /greɪtfʊl/ (the diphthong /eɪ/ comes from Middle English long /aː/). In the three-syllable word `grat-i-tude`, the stress is on the antepenultimate syllable `grat-`. The historically long vowel shortens to the lax vowel /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Has undergone** trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**:\n    *   **Etymology**: From Old English *sceaduwe*.\n    *   **Analysis**: This word fails to meet the conditions for TSL for two fundamental reasons. First, in Modern English it only has two syllables (*sha-dow*). Second, and more importantly, the vowel has been short throughout its history. The Old English word *sceadu* had a short vowel /æ/. Since the rule shortens *long* vowels, it could not apply to a word whose vowel was already short.\n    *   **Conclusion**: **Has not undergone** trisyllabic laxing because its vowel was never long in the first place.\n\n**3. Final Decision**\n\nBoth `pleasant` and `shadow` have not undergone trisyllabic laxing. However, `shadow` is arguably the better answer because the process could never have applied to it at any point in its history, as its core defining feature—a historically long vowel to be shortened—is absent. `pleasant` fails on structural grounds (it's not a three-syllable word), which is also a valid reason. But the case for `shadow` is more absolute, as it fails to meet the input requirement of the rule itself.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
