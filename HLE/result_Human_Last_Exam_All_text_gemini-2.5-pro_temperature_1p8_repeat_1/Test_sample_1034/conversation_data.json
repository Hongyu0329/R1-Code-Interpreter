    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\n*   We have a triangle, $\\triangle ABC$.\n*   The length of side $BC$ is given as $S = SNYWR$. This appears to be a placeholder for a numerical value. A common convention in mathematical puzzles is to assign numerical values to letters based on their alphabetical position (A=1, B=2, C=3, ...). We will assume this convention is intended.\n*   Let's calculate the value of S:\n    *   S = 19th letter\n    *   N = 14th letter\n    *   Y = 25th letter\n    *   W = 23rd letter\n    *   R = 18th letter\n    *   Summing these values: $S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99$.\n*   So, we have $BC = a = 99$.\n*   The measure of angle B is given as $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B = 30^{\\circ}$.\n*   We need to find the number of possible integer values for the side length $AC$ (let's call it $b$) such that there are exactly two possible values for the side length $AB$ (let's call it $c$).\n\n**2. Identify the Mathematical Condition**\nThis problem describes the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines, often referred to as the Side-Side-Angle (SSA) case. We are given two sides ($a$ and $b$) and a non-included angle ($\\angle B$). For two distinct triangles to be possible, the length of the side opposite the given angle ($AC = b$) must satisfy a specific condition.\n\n**3. Geometric Analysis**\nLet's analyze the geometry to determine the condition.\n*   Imagine constructing the triangle. Start by drawing the side $BC$ of length 99.\n*   At vertex $B$, draw a ray that makes a $30^{\\circ}$ angle with the segment $BC$. The vertex $A$ must lie somewhere on this ray.\n*   Now, consider the side $AC$, which has length $b$. We can think of this as swinging a compass of radius $b$ with the point at $C$. The possible locations for vertex $A$ are where this circle intersects the ray from $B$.\n*   For there to be two possible locations for $A$ (and thus two possible triangles), the circle must intersect the ray at two distinct points.\n*   Let $h$ be the perpendicular distance (altitude) from vertex $C$ to the line containing the ray from $B$. This is the shortest possible length for $AC$ to form a triangle.\n*   We can calculate $h$ using the right triangle formed by $C$, $B$, and the foot of the altitude:\n    $\\sin(\\angle B) = \\frac{h}{BC}$\n    $h = BC \\cdot \\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 99 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 49.5$.\n*   The condition for two distinct triangles is that the length of side $AC=b$ must be strictly greater than the altitude $h$, and also strictly less than the length of the adjacent side $BC=a$.\n    *   If $b < h$, the circle does not reach the ray (0 triangles).\n    *   If $b = h$, the circle is tangent to the ray (1 right triangle).\n    *   If $b > h$ and $b < a$, the circle intersects the ray in two places (2 triangles).\n    *   If $b \\geq a$, the circle intersects the ray in only one valid place (1 triangle).\n*   Therefore, the condition for two possible values for side length $AB$ is $h < AC < BC$.\n\n**4. Alternative Algebraic Analysis (Law of Cosines)**\nWe can also use the Law of Cosines to reach the same conclusion. Let $a=BC=99$, $b=AC$, and $c=AB$.\n$b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \\cos(B)$\n$b^2 = 99^2 + c^2 - 2(99)c \\cos(30^{\\circ})$\n$b^2 = 99^2 + c^2 - 198c \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$\nRearranging this into a quadratic equation for $c$:\n$c^2 - (99\\sqrt{3})c + (99^2 - b^2) = 0$\nFor there to be two possible values for side $AB=c$, this quadratic equation must have two distinct positive real roots. The conditions for this are:\n1.  **Discriminant > 0**: $D = (-99\\sqrt{3})^2 - 4(1)(99^2 - b^2) > 0$\n    $3(99^2) - 4(99^2) + 4b^2 > 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 99^2 > 0 \\implies (2b)^2 > 99^2 \\implies 2b > 99 \\implies b > 49.5$.\n2.  **Product of roots > 0**: The product of roots is $c_1 c_2 = 99^2 - b^2$. For the roots to both be positive, their product must be positive.\n    $99^2 - b^2 > 0 \\implies 99^2 > b^2 \\implies 99 > b$.\nCombining these two conditions, we get $49.5 < b < 99$. This confirms the geometric result.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\nWe need to find the number of integer values of $AC$ (which is $b$) in the range $49.5 < b < 99$.\n*   The smallest integer value for $b$ that is greater than 49.5 is 50.\n*   The largest integer value for $b$ that is less than 99 is 98.\n*   The possible integer values for $AC$ are $50, 51, 52, \\ldots, 98$.\n*   To count the number of integers in this inclusive range, we use the formula: (Last Value) - (First Value) + 1.\n*   Number of integer values = $98 - 50 + 1 = 49$.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   **Placeholder Variable:** Interpreted `SNYWR` as a sum of letter values, a common puzzle device.\n*   **Ambiguous Case Condition:** Correctly identified the condition for two triangles as $h < b < a$.\n*   **Strict Inequalities:** Ensured the use of strict inequalities, as equality leads to only one triangle.\n*   **Integer Counting:** Correctly identified the first and last integers in the range and used the correct counting formula to avoid off-by-one errors.\n\nThe number of integer values for $AC$ that allow for two possible values for side length $AB$ is 49.\n\n<<<49>>>"
