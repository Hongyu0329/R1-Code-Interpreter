    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the core elements of the question.**\nThe query asks for a specific scene in a specific type of film. Let's break down the key identifiers:\n*   **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n*   **Producer:** A major film studio.\n*   **Character:** A teenager.\n*   **Object:** A pink bike.\n*   **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike *directly toward* an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Analysis and Keyword Association.**\nThe combination of a teenager on a bike in a confrontational scene immediately brings to mind coming-of-age films, dramas, or thrillers. The action of pedaling *toward* danger, rather than away from it, suggests a moment of defiance, bravery, or desperation. The detail of the \"pink bike\" is very specific and serves as a primary clue.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating Potential Candidate Films.**\nLet's consider films that feature teenagers and bicycles.\n\n*   ***Pretty in Pink* (1986):** The title is an obvious match for the color \"pink.\" The main character, Andie, is a teenager. However, her iconic vehicle is a pink Volkswagen Karmann Ghia, not a pink bicycle. This film does not contain the described scene.\n*   ***Now and Then* (1995):** This film features four teenage girls who ride bikes constantly. It's possible one of the bikes is pink or has pink elements. However, there isn't a famous, central scene where one of them specifically pedals head-on into an oncoming car as an act of defiance.\n*   ***A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge* (1985):** Produced by New Line Cinema. Features a teenage protagonist. It has a famous scene involving a vehicle (a school bus) going out of control, but no bike scene matching the description.\n*   ***It* (2017):** This film is a strong candidate. Let's check it against the criteria.\n    *   **Hollywood Feature Film from a Major Studio?** Yes. It was produced by New Line Cinema (a subsidiary of Warner Bros.), a major studio.\n    *   **Teenager?** Yes, the scene features Beverly Marsh, a member of the Losers' Club, who is a teenager.\n    *   **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car?** Yes. In a pivotal scene, Beverly is riding her bike when the bully Henry Bowers and his gang try to run her off the road in their car. In a defining act of defiance, she stops, turns, and pedals directly towards their car, forcing them to swerve. This action perfectly matches the description.\n\n**Step 4: Addressing the \"Pink Bike\" detail.**\nThis is the most critical point of potential discrepancy. In the film *It* (2017), Beverly Marsh's bike is not pink; it is a red Huffy bicycle.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is extremely common for details like color to be misremembered, especially when the rest of a scene's action is so unique and memorable. The combination of a lone teenage girl on a bike confronting a car full of male bullies by pedaling directly at them is a very specific and powerful image. There is no other major Hollywood film that contains this exact sequence of events. The red color of the bike is vivid and could be recalled as pink, a color often associated with girls' bikes.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nGiven that all other highly specific elements of the query—a teenager, a bike, the defiant act of pedaling head-on into an oncoming car, and being from a major Hollywood film—point directly to the scene with Beverly Marsh in *It* (2017), this is the correct answer. The slight inaccuracy in the bike's color is likely a small error in memory, overshadowed by the scene's unique and dramatic action.\n\n<<<It (2017)>>>"
