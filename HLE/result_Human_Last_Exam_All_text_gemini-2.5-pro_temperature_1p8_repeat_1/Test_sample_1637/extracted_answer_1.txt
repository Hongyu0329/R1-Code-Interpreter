Yes, changing the structure to incorporate a polyethylene glycol (PEG) group is a very effective and common strategy to increase the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic molecules. The original probe's large, nonpolar aromatic thioxanthenone core is the primary cause of its low solubility, leading to precipitation. Replacing the relatively modest hydrophilic contribution of a single amide group with the much stronger hydrophilic character of a flexible PEG chain (containing multiple ether oxygens for hydrogen bonding) will significantly improve the probe's solubility in the aqueous cell culture medium and likely solve the precipitation problem.
