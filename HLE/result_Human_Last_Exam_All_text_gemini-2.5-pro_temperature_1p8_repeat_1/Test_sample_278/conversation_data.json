    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parametric Curve**\n\nThe curve is defined by $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b \\sin t$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The value of $b$ is defined piecewise:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $b=1$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$, $y = \\sin t$.\n    This satisfies $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. Since $t$ is in $[0, \\pi]$, $\\sin t \\ge 0$, so $y \\ge 0$. This represents the upper semi-circle of the unit circle, starting from $(1,0)$ at $t=0$, going through $(0,1)$ at $t=\\pi/2$, and ending at $(-1,0)$ at $t=\\pi$.\n\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $b=5$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$, $y = 5 \\sin t$.\n    This satisfies $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-major axis of 5 along the y-axis and a semi-minor axis of 1 along the x-axis. Since $t$ is in $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $\\sin t < 0$, so $y < 0$. This represents the lower half of the ellipse $x^2 + y^2/25 = 1$. The curve starts from $(-1,0)$ as $t \\to \\pi^+$, goes through $(0,-5)$ at $t=3\\pi/2$, and ends at $(1,0)$ as $t \\to 2\\pi^-$.\n\nThe complete figure is the union of the upper unit semi-circle and the lower semi-ellipse, which join at the points $(-1,0)$ and $(1,0)$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Bounding Box and the Axis-Aligned Enclosing Square**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure with its sides parallel to the coordinate axes, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of $x$ and $y$.\n*   **x-range:** $x = \\cos t$ for $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The range of $\\cos t$ is $[-1, 1]$. So, $x_{min} = -1$ and $x_{max} = 1$. The width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **y-range:**\n    *   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $y = \\sin t$ ranges from 0 to 1.\n    *   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5\\sin t$ ranges from 0 to -5.\n    *   The overall range for y is therefore $[-5, 1]$. So, $y_{min} = -5$ and $y_{max} = 1$. The height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. The smallest axis-aligned square enclosing this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger dimension, which is 6. The area of this square is $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Step 3: Consider Rotated Enclosing Squares**\n\nA smaller enclosing square might be possible if we allow it to be rotated. The side length of the smallest possible enclosing square is determined by the maximum width of the figure's convex hull. A key property for a convex shape with y-axis symmetry is that its minimal bounding box at a rotation of 45° ($\\pi/4$ radians) is a square. Our figure's convex hull is symmetric about the y-axis, so we can find the side length of the minimal square by calculating the width of the figure when rotated by 45°.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Width at 45° Rotation**\n\nLet the side length of the rotated square be $L$. This side length is equal to the width of the figure's convex hull along a direction of 45°. The width in the direction $\\theta=\\pi/4$ is given by the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the projection $p(x,y) = x \\cos(\\pi/4) + y \\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{x+y}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nSo, $L = \\max(p) - \\min(p) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\sup(x+y) - \\inf(x+y))$, where the supremum and infimum are taken over all points $(x,y)$ of the figure.\n\nWe need to find the extreme values of the function $f(x,y) = x+y$ on the figure. The extreme values will occur on the boundary of its convex hull. The convex hull of our figure is bounded by:\n*   The line segment from $(-1,0)$ to $(0,1)$.\n*   The line segment from $(0,1)$ to $(1,0)$.\n*   The lower arc of the ellipse $x^2 + y^2/25=1$.\nThe \"extreme\" points of this convex hull are $(0,1)$ and the points on the lower semi-ellipse.\n\n1.  **At the point (0,1):** $x+y = 0+1=1$.\n2.  **On the lower semi-ellipse:** $x=\\cos t$, $y=5\\sin t$ for $t \\in [\\pi, 2\\pi]$. We need to find the extreme values of $f(t) = \\cos t + 5\\sin t$.\n    *   Find critical points by taking the derivative: $f'(t) = -\\sin t + 5\\cos t$. Setting $f'(t)=0$ gives $\\tan t = 5$.\n    *   This equation has solutions in Quadrant I ($t_1 = \\arctan 5$) and Quadrant III ($t_2 = \\pi + \\arctan 5$). Only $t_2$ is in our interval $[\\pi, 2\\pi]$.\n    *   To find the value of $f(t_2)$, we use a right triangle with opposite side 5, adjacent 1, so hypotenuse $\\sqrt{1^2+5^2}=\\sqrt{26}$. Since $t_2$ is in Q3, both sine and cosine are negative: $\\sin(t_2) = -5/\\sqrt{26}$ and $\\cos(t_2)=-1/\\sqrt{26}$.\n    *   The value at this critical point is $f(t_2) = (-1/\\sqrt{26}) + 5(-5/\\sqrt{26}) = -26/\\sqrt{26} = -\\sqrt{26}$. This corresponds to a minimum.\n    *   We also check the endpoints of the interval:\n        *   At $t=\\pi$: point is $(-1,0)$, so $x+y = -1$.\n        *   At $t=2\\pi$: point is $(1,0)$, so $x+y = 1$.\n    *   Combining all points on the convex hull, the overall supremum of $x+y$ is $\\max(1, 1)=1$. The overall infimum is $\\min(1, -\\sqrt{26}) = -\\sqrt{26}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Side Length and Area of the Smallest Square**\n\nNow we can calculate the side length $L$ of the 45°-rotated square:\n$L = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (\\sup(x+y) - \\inf(x+y)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1 - (-\\sqrt{26})) = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{26}}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThe area of this smallest enclosing square is $L^2$:\nArea $= \\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{26}}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{(1+\\sqrt{26})^2}{2} = \\frac{1^2 + 2(1)(\\sqrt{26}) + (\\sqrt{26})^2}{2} = \\frac{1 + 2\\sqrt{26} + 26}{2} = \\frac{27 + 2\\sqrt{26}}{2}$.\n\nArea $= 13.5 + \\sqrt{26}$.\n\nThis value is approximately $13.5 + 5.099 = 18.599$, which is much smaller than the area of the axis-aligned square (36).\n\n<<<13.5 + sqrt(26)>>>"
