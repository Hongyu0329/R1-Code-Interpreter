    "This problem asks for the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy for a system of light quanta (photons) using the frameworks of the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chenoff large deviation theorems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. System and Statistical Framework**\n\n*   **System:** A gas of light quanta (photons).\n*   **Statistics:** Photons are indistinguishable bosons, obeying Bose-Einstein statistics.\n*   **Key Property:** The total number of photons is not conserved. In thermodynamic equilibrium, this corresponds to a chemical potential of zero ($\\mu=0$).\n*   **Equilibrium:** The equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic state of the system, which corresponds to the state of maximum entropy for a given mean energy (microcanonical view) or minimum free energy for a given temperature (canonical view).\n\n**2. Analysis using the Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem Framework**\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem provides a large deviation principle for the empirical measure of i.i.d. samples. In statistical mechanics, we use a conceptually analogous principle: the probability of observing a particular macrostate is exponentially related to its entropy. The equilibrium state is the one that maximizes this entropy, subject to physical constraints.\n\n*   **Step 2.1: Entropy of a Boson Gas**\n    A macrostate is defined by the set of occupation numbers $\\{N_j\\}$ for each energy level $\\epsilon_j$. If an energy level $\\epsilon_j$ has $g_j$ degenerate states, the number of ways to distribute $N_j$ indistinguishable bosons among these states is given by $\\Omega_j = \\binom{N_j + g_j - 1}{N_j}$. The total number of microstates for the macrostate $\\{N_j\\}$ is $\\Omega = \\prod_j \\Omega_j$.\n    The Boltzmann entropy is $S = k_B \\ln \\Omega$. Using Stirling's approximation for large $N_j$ and $g_j$, and defining the average occupation number per state as $n_j = N_j/g_j$, the entropy functional becomes:\n    $S[\\{n_j\\}] = k_B \\sum_j g_j [ (n_j+1) \\ln(n_j+1) - n_j \\ln n_j ]$\n\n*   **Step 2.2: Maximizing Entropy**\n    To find the equilibrium state, we maximize this entropy functional subject to the system's constraints. For photons, the only constraint is a fixed mean energy, $\\langle E \\rangle$. There is no constraint on the total number of particles. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize $S/k_B$ subject to $\\sum_j g_j n_j \\epsilon_j = \\langle E \\rangle$. The Lagrangian is:\n    $L = \\sum_j g_j [ (n_j+1) \\ln(n_j+1) - n_j \\ln n_j ] - \\beta (\\sum_j g_j n_j \\epsilon_j - \\langle E \\rangle)$\n    where $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with energy, which will be identified as $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n*   **Step 2.3: Finding the Equilibrium Distribution**\n    Taking the derivative of $L$ with respect to $n_j$ and setting it to zero gives:\n    $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial n_j} = g_j \\left[ \\ln(n_j+1) - \\ln(n_j) \\right] - \\beta g_j \\epsilon_j = 0$\n    $\\ln\\left(\\frac{n_j+1}{n_j}\\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_j$\n    $1 + \\frac{1}{n_j} = e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}$\n    This yields the equilibrium average occupation number, which is the Bose-Einstein distribution for $\\mu=0$:\n    $\\langle n_j \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n\n**3. Analysis using the Cramer-Chenoff Theorem Framework**\n\nThe Cramer-Chenoff (or Cram√©r's) theorem relates the large deviations of a sum of i.i.d. random variables to the Legendre transform of their log-moment-generating function. In the canonical ensemble of statistical mechanics, this formalism is mirrored by the relationship between thermodynamic potentials derived from the partition function, $Z$. Here, $\\ln Z$ acts as the cumulant-generating function for the energy.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Partition Function for Photons**\n    We consider the system in contact with a heat bath at a fixed temperature $T$ (fixed $\\beta$). The modes of the electromagnetic field are independent quantum harmonic oscillators. The partition function for a single mode with energy levels $E_n = n\\epsilon_j$ (for $n=0, 1, 2, ...$) is a geometric series:\n    $Z_j = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta n \\epsilon_j} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}}$\n    Since the modes are independent, the total partition function is the product over all modes, accounting for degeneracy $g_j$:\n    $Z = \\prod_j (Z_j)^{g_j} = \\prod_j (1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j})^{-g_j}$\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Finding the Equilibrium Mean Energy**\n    The log-partition function acts as the cumulant generating function. The mean energy $\\langle E \\rangle$ is its first derivative with respect to $-\\beta$.\n    $\\ln Z = - \\sum_j g_j \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j})$\n    The equilibrium mean energy is:\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial (\\ln Z)}{\\partial \\beta} = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left[ - \\sum_j g_j \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}) \\right]$\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_j g_j \\left[ \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}} \\cdot (-\\epsilon_j e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}) \\cdot (-1) \\right] = \\sum_j g_j \\frac{\\epsilon_j e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}}{1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}}$\n    Multiplying the numerator and denominator by $e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j}$ gives the final expression for the mean energy:\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_j g_j \\frac{\\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Finding the Equilibrium Entropy**\n    The entropy $S$ can be derived from the fundamental thermodynamic relation $F = \\langle E \\rangle - TS$, where $F = -k_B T \\ln Z = - (1/\\beta) \\ln Z$ is the Helmholtz free energy.\n    $S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle - F}{T} = k_B \\beta (\\langle E \\rangle - F) = k_B \\beta \\langle E \\rangle + k_B \\ln Z$\n    Substituting the expressions for $\\langle E \\rangle$ and $\\ln Z$:\n    $S = k_B \\left( \\beta \\sum_j g_j \\frac{\\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1} - \\sum_j g_j \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}) \\right)$\n    This can be expressed as a sum over the contributions from each energy level:\n    $S = \\sum_j g_j S_j$, where $S_j = k_B \\left[ \\frac{\\beta \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1} - \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}) \\right]$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a system of light quanta are given as functions of the temperature (through $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$) and the system's energy level structure (levels $\\epsilon_j$ with degeneracies $g_j$).\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n$$ \\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_{j} g_j \\frac{\\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1} $$\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\n$$ S = k_B \\sum_{j} g_j \\left[ \\frac{\\beta \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1} - \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}) \\right] $$\nThis can also be written in terms of the mean occupation numbers $\\langle n_j \\rangle = (e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1)^{-1}$ as:\n$$ S = k_B \\sum_{j} g_j \\left[ (\\langle n_j \\rangle+1) \\ln(\\langle n_j \\rangle + 1) - \\langle n_j \\rangle \\ln(\\langle n_j \\rangle) \\right] $$\n\n<<<**Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n$ \\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_{j} g_j \\frac{\\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1} $\n**Equilibrium Entropy:**\n$ S = k_B \\sum_{j} g_j \\left[ \\frac{\\beta \\epsilon_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1} - \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_j}) \\right] $\n(where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, $\\epsilon_j$ are the energy levels, and $g_j$ are their degeneracies)>>>"
