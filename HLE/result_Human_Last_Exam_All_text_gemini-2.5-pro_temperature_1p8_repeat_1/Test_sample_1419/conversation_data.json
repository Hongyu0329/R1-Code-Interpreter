    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the framework:** The question concerns the $\\phi^4$ theory, a cornerstone of quantum field theory and statistical physics, particularly for describing critical phenomena. The concept of a \"fixed point coupling\" arises from the Renormalization Group (RG). We need to analyze the RG flow of the coupling constant near the critical dimension $d=4$. The $\\epsilon$-expansion, where $\\epsilon = 4-d$ is a small parameter, is the appropriate tool for this.\n\n2.  **Define the theory and coupling constant:** We consider a single-component scalar field $\\phi$ with the Lagrangian density:\n    $$ \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_0^2 \\phi^2 + \\frac{u_0}{4!} \\phi^4 $$\n    In $d$ dimensions, the scalar field $\\phi$ has a mass dimension of $(d-2)/2$. For the action $\\int d^d x \\mathcal{L}$ to be dimensionless, the bare coupling constant $u_0$ must have a mass dimension of $4-d = \\epsilon$.\n    To perform RG analysis, we introduce a dimensionless renormalized coupling constant, $u$, defined at an arbitrary energy scale $\\mu$:\n    $$ u_0 = u \\mu^\\epsilon $$\n    This relation holds at the classical (tree) level. Quantum corrections will modify it with renormalization factors.\n\n3.  **Determine the beta function:** The RG flow is governed by the beta function, $\\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu}$, which describes how the dimensionless coupling $u$ changes with the energy scale $\\mu$. The beta function for the $\\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions is computed using perturbation theory.\n    *   **Tree-level contribution:** Differentiating the relation $u = u_0 \\mu^{-\\epsilon}$ with respect to $\\ln\\mu$ gives the classical part of the beta function: $\\beta_{classical}(u) = -\\epsilon u$.\n    *   **One-loop quantum correction:** The leading quantum correction comes from one-loop diagrams renormalizing the four-point vertex. For the $\\phi^4$ theory, there are three such diagrams (s, t, and u channels), which give identical contributions. A standard calculation in quantum field theory, using dimensional regularization and a minimal subtraction (MS) scheme, yields the correction term. For the Lagrangian with the $\\frac{u}{4!}$ normalization, the one-loop beta function is:\n        $$ \\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2} + O(u^3) $$\n\n4.  **Find the fixed points:** Fixed points, denoted by $u^*$, are specific values of the coupling where the theory becomes scale-invariant. At a fixed point, the beta function vanishes:\n    $$ \\beta(u^*) = 0 $$\n    Substituting the one-loop beta function into this condition gives:\n    $$ -\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\n\n5.  **Solve for the fixed point coupling:** This equation has two solutions for $u^*$.\n    *   **The Gaussian Fixed Point:** $u^* = 0$. This corresponds to a non-interacting (free) theory.\n    *   **The Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point:** This is the non-trivial solution, which governs the critical behavior of the system. We find it by factoring out $u^*$ (assuming $u^* \\neq 0$):\n        $$ u^* \\left(-\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2}\\right) = 0 $$\n        $$ \\implies -\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = 0 $$\n        Solving for $u^*$:\n        $$ \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = \\epsilon $$\n        $$ u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon $$\n\n6.  **Identify the leading order expression:** The calculation was performed using the one-loop beta function, which is the leading order approximation in the coupling $u$. The resulting fixed point value, $u^*$, is proportional to $\\epsilon$. This is the leading-order term in the $\\epsilon$-expansion for the fixed point. Higher-order loop calculations for $\\beta(u)$ would introduce terms of order $u^3, u^4, \\dots$, which in turn would contribute terms of order $\\epsilon^2, \\epsilon^3, \\dots$ to the expression for $u^*$. Therefore, the expression found is the leading order result as requested.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Normalization Convention:** The numerical coefficient in the beta function depends on the normalization of the coupling constant in the Lagrangian. The calculation above uses $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = \\frac{u}{4!}\\phi^4$, a common convention in statistical field theory. Other conventions (e.g., $\\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\phi^4$) would change the numerical factors but the physics remains the same. Consistency is key.\n*   **Dimensional Regularization:** The use of dimensional regularization with the MS scheme is crucial for cleanly isolating the divergences and deriving the universal parts of the beta function.\n*   **Leading Order:** The question explicitly asks for the *leading order* expression. This justifies stopping the calculation at one-loop order for the beta function and keeping only the term linear in $\\epsilon$ for the fixed point.\n\nThe final answer is the expression for the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\n<<<u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon>>>"
