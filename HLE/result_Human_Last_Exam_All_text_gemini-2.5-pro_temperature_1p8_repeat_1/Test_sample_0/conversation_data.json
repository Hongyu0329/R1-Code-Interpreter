    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks to identify which of the five listed conditions, part of Gustav Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem in population ethics, is violated by \"critical-level views\". To answer this, we must first understand what critical-level views are and then what each of the five conditions entails.\n\n**2. Define Critical-Level Views (CLV):**\nA critical-level view is a theory about how to evaluate the goodness of a population. Its core idea is:\n*   There is a \"critical level\" of welfare, let's call it **c**, which is typically assumed to be a positive value (i.e., a life worth living).\n*   The value of a population is calculated by summing up the \"contributory value\" of each person's life.\n*   The contributory value of a life with welfare level **w** is **(w - c)**.\n*   Therefore, the total value of a population is the sum of (wᵢ - c) for all individuals *i*.\n*   This means a life adds positive value to the world only if its welfare **w** is *above* the critical level **c**. A life with welfare *below* **c** adds negative value. A life at exactly level **c** adds zero value.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Condition and Test CLV against it:**\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance:**\n    *   **Condition Meaning:** This principle applies when comparing two populations of the *same size*. It says that if Population A is better for at least one person and no worse for anyone than Population B, and the inequality in A is not greater than in B, then A is a better population than B.\n    *   **CLV Test:** Let Population A and B both have *n* people. Let the welfare levels be {w_A1, ..., w_An} and {w_B1, ..., w_Bn}. The condition states w_Ai ≥ w_Bi for all *i* and w_Aj > w_Bj for at least one *j*.\n        *   Value(A) = Σ(w_Ai - c) = (Σw_Ai) - n*c\n        *   Value(B) = Σ(w_Bi - c) = (Σw_Bi) - n*c\n        *   Since Σw_Ai > Σw_Bi, it follows that Value(A) > Value(B).\n    *   **Conclusion:** CLV *satisfies* Egalitarian Dominance.\n\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority:**\n    *   **Condition Meaning:** This is a \"prioritarian\" principle. It states that there is some welfare level such that giving a benefit of a certain size to a person at that level is *more valuable* than giving the same-sized benefit to any person who is better off. In essence, benefits to the worse-off should count for more.\n    *   **CLV Test:** Let's see how CLV values a benefit. Suppose we give a benefit (a welfare increase) of size **d** to a person.\n        *   If the person starts at welfare level w₁, their new welfare is w₁ + d. The increase in total value is [(w₁ + d) - c] - [w₁ - c] = **d**.\n        *   If the person starts at a higher welfare level w₂, their new welfare is w₂ + d. The increase in total value is [(w₂ + d) - c] - [w₂ - c] = **d**.\n        *   According to CLV, the value of the benefit **d** is the same regardless of whether the recipient is worse-off or better-off. It does not give *more* value to benefits for the worse-off.\n    *   **Conclusion:** CLV *violates* General Non-Extreme Priority. It is impartial, not prioritarian, in how it values welfare gains for existing people.\n\n*   **C. Non-Elitism:**\n    *   **Condition Meaning:** It's not always better to have a small number of people at the highest possible welfare level. A sufficiently large population of people at a very good (but not the best) level of welfare can be better.\n    *   **CLV Test:** Let there be a small elite population (A) of *n* people at the best level *z*. Let there be a large population (B) of *m* people at a very good level *y* (where y < z). Assume both *y* and *z* are above the critical level *c*.\n        *   Value(A) = n * (z - c)\n        *   Value(B) = m * (y - c)\n        *   We can always find a large enough number *m* such that m * (y - c) > n * (z - c), as long as (y - c) is positive.\n    *   **Conclusion:** CLV *satisfies* Non-Elitism.\n\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism:**\n    *   **Condition Meaning:** Adding a person whose life is full of suffering (i.e., has negative welfare) to a world of happy people does not make the world better.\n    *   **CLV Test:** Start with a population of happy people. Add a person with welfare **w_neg** < 0. The change in the population's total value is (w_neg - c). Since **c** is positive and **w_neg** is negative, (w_neg - c) must be negative. This means the world becomes worse, not better.\n    *   **Conclusion:** CLV *satisfies* Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition:**\n    *   **Condition Meaning:** For any population of very happy people, it is possible to make the world better by adding a certain number of people with a sufficiently high (but still positive) quality of life.\n    *   **CLV Test:** Start with any population. Can we make it better by adding *m* people at some positive welfare level *v*? The change in value will be m * (v - c). For this to be a positive change, we just need *v > c*. The principle says there must exist *some* such positive *v* and *m*. As long as we can conceive of lives with welfare above the critical level, this is possible.\n    *   **Conclusion:** CLV *satisfies* Weak Quality Addition.\n\n**Final Summary:**\nCritical-Level Views satisfy Egalitarian Dominance, Non-Elitism, Weak Non-Sadism, and Weak Quality Addition. They fail to satisfy General Non-Extreme Priority because they value a gain in welfare equally, no matter how well-off the recipient is.\n\n<<<B>>>"
