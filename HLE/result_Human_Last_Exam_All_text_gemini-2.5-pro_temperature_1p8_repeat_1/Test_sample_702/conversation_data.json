    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map\n\n*   **Source Space:** $S = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    *   $\\Omega X$ denotes the loop space of $X$. $\\pi_k(\\Omega X) \\cong \\pi_{k+1}(X)$.\n    *   $\\Sigma X$ denotes the reduced suspension of $X$.\n    *   $X \\wedge Y$ denotes the smash product of $X$ and $Y$.\n*   **Target Space:** $T = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) = \\Omega(S^{10})$.\n*   **The Map:** The question describes the map as \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\". This points to a standard map in homotopy theory. A key result, for example in a paper by F. Cohen (\"Splitting certain suspensions\"), establishes a homotopy fibration sequence involving these spaces:\n    $$ \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\xrightarrow{f} \\Omega(S^m \\wedge S^n) \\to \\Omega(S^m * S^n) $$\n    where $X*Y = \\Sigma(X \\wedge Y)$ is the join of $X$ and $Y$.\n    For our case, $m=4$ and $n=6$.\n    *   $S^4 \\wedge S^6 = S^{10}$.\n    *   $S^4 * S^6 \\simeq \\Sigma(S^4 \\wedge S^6) = \\Sigma S^{10} = S^{11}$.\n\n    So, we have the fibration sequence:\n    $$ \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\xrightarrow{f} \\Omega S^{10} \\xrightarrow{p} \\Omega S^{11} $$\n    The map $f$ in the question is the inclusion of the homotopy fiber of the map $p: \\Omega S^{10} \\to \\Omega S^{11}$.\n\n### Step 2: Define and determine the connectivity of a map\n\nA map $g: A \\to B$ is called **n-connected** if the induced homomorphism on homotopy groups, $g_*: \\pi_k(A) \\to \\pi_k(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $k < n$ and an epimorphism (surjection) for $k = n$. The \"connectivity\" of the map is this integer $n$.\n\nThe long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration $F \\xrightarrow{i} E \\xrightarrow{p} B$ is:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_{k+1}(B) \\stackrel{\\partial}{\\to} \\pi_k(F) \\stackrel{i_*}{\\to} \\pi_k(E) \\stackrel{p_*}{\\to} \\pi_k(B) \\to \\dots $$\nFrom this sequence, we can see that the map $i_*: \\pi_k(F) \\to \\pi_k(E)$ is an isomorphism if and only if both $\\pi_{k+1}(B)$ and $\\pi_k(B)$ are the trivial group $\\{0\\}$. This holds for $k < \\text{conn}(B)$, where $\\text{conn}(B)$ is the connectivity of the base space $B$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the connectivity of the base space\n\nIn our fibration, the source space $S$ is the fiber $F$, the target space $T$ is the total space $E$, and the base space is $B = \\Omega S^{11}$.\nLet's find the connectivity of $B = \\Omega S^{11}$.\nThe sphere $S^{11}$ is 10-connected, meaning $\\pi_k(S^{11}) = 0$ for $k \\le 10$.\nThe loop space functor reduces connectivity by 1.\nSo, $\\text{conn}(\\Omega S^{11}) = \\text{conn}(S^{11}) - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9$.\nThis means $\\pi_k(\\Omega S^{11}) = 0$ for all $k \\le 9$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the connectivity of the map $f$\n\n*   For $k < 9$: The long exact sequence for homotopy groups contains the segment:\n    $$ \\dots \\to \\pi_{k+1}(\\Omega S^{11}) \\to \\pi_k(S) \\xrightarrow{f_*} \\pi_k(T) \\to \\pi_k(\\Omega S^{11}) \\to \\dots $$\n    Since $k < 9$, both $\\pi_{k+1}(\\Omega S^{11})$ and $\\pi_k(\\Omega S^{11})$ are zero. The exactness of the sequence implies that $f_*: \\pi_k(S) \\to \\pi_k(T)$ is an isomorphism.\n\n*   For $k = 9$: The long exact sequence gives:\n    $$ \\dots \\to \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{11}) \\stackrel{\\partial}{\\to} \\pi_9(S) \\xrightarrow{f_*} \\pi_9(T) \\to \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{11}) \\to \\dots $$\n    Let's compute the relevant homotopy groups:\n    *   $\\pi_9(\\Omega S^{11}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{11}) = 0$.\n    *   $\\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{11}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{11}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ (generated by the identity map on $S^{11}$).\n\n    Substituting these into the sequence:\n    $$ \\mathbb{Z} \\stackrel{\\partial}{\\to} \\pi_9(S) \\xrightarrow{f_*} \\pi_9(T) \\to 0 $$\n    This shows that $f_*$ is an epimorphism (surjection) on $\\pi_9$.\n\n*   **Conclusion on connectivity:** Since $f_*$ is an isomorphism for $k < 9$ and an epimorphism for $k=9$, the map $f$ is 9-connected. The connectivity of the map is 9.\n\n### Step 5: (Optional) Verifying that $f_*$ is not an isomorphism for $k=9$\n\nTo be sure that the connectivity is exactly 9 and not higher, we need to check if $f_*$ is also an isomorphism for $k=9$. This would be true if and only if the connecting homomorphism $\\partial: \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{11}) \\to \\pi_9(S)$ is the zero map.\n\nLet's compute the domain and codomain of $f_*$ on $\\pi_9$:\n*   $\\pi_9(T) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The space $S = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is 8-connected. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is $\\pi_9(S) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. This group is known to be $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSo the sequence for $k=9$ becomes $\\mathbb{Z} \\stackrel{\\partial}{\\to} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{f_*} \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$.\nThe map $\\partial$ can be identified with a map related to the Whitehead product $[id_4, id_6]$. It is a standard result that this map is non-trivial. In fact, it's an isomorphism. This implies that the kernel of $f_*: \\pi_9(S) \\to \\pi_9(T)$ is non-trivial (it is $\\mathbb{Z}$), so $f_*$ is not an isomorphism on $\\pi_9$.\n\nThus, the connectivity of the map is exactly 9."
