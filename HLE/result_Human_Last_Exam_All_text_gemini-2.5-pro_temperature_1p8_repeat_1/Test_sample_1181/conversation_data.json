    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a character from a specific film (*Solaris*, 1972, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky) who expressed a very particular sentiment: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This requires knowledge of the characters and key dialogues in the movie.\n\n**Step 2: List and Analyze the Characters**\nThe answer choices provide the key characters to consider:\n\n*   **A. Kris (Kelvin):** The main character, a psychologist. He is defined by his deep connection and nostalgia for Earth, symbolized by the lengthy opening and closing scenes at his dacha. He deeply misses Earth, but his primary expressed shame in the film relates to his past treatment of his wife, Hari.\n*   **B. Hari:** Kris's \"guest,\" a replica of his deceased wife created by the Solaris ocean. She has no independent memories of Earth; all her knowledge comes from Kris's mind. Therefore, she cannot miss something she has never experienced herself.\n*   **C. Snaut:** A cyberneticist and one of the two surviving scientists on the station when Kris arrives. He is weary, often cynical, and drinks heavily. He frequently engages in philosophical discussions with Kris about their purpose and humanity.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** A biologist, the other surviving scientist. He is cold, logical, and obsessed with the scientific aspects of their situation. He actively suppresses emotion and sentimentality, making it highly unlikely he would confess to such a feeling.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Kris's friend who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. He appears only in a recorded video message where he expresses deep despair and warns Kris about the phenomena on the station. His focus is on the horror of the situation, not nostalgia for Earth.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\nThe sentiment of being \"ashamed\" to miss a simple earthly sound is a crucial detail. This isn't just simple nostalgia; it's a confession of a feeling perceived as a weakness or something unbecoming. This particular dialogue occurs in a conversation between Kris and Snaut in the station's library.\n\n*   In this scene, Snaut is reflecting on their mission and their humanity. He muses that humanity doesn't truly want to conquer the cosmos but rather extend Earth's boundaries. He then confesses his feelings of alienation and loss.\n*   He speaks to Kris about this internal conflict, stating that as a scientist pushing the boundaries of human experience, he feels ashamed to long for something so simple and \"primitive\" as the rustling of leaves. The shame comes from the contrast between his grand mission and his very basic, human desires. This dialogue perfectly matches the description in the question.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude by Matching the Character to the Dialogue**\nBased on the analysis of the characters and the specific dialogue from the film, Dr. Snaut is the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling. The other characters do not express this specific combination of nostalgia and shame. Kris feels nostalgia but not shame for it; Hari cannot; Sartorius would be scornful of it; Gibarian is in a different state of mind altogether.\n\n<<<C>>>"
