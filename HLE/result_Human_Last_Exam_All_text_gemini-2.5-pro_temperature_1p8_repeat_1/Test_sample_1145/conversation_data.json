    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem deals with a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well, commonly known as a \"particle in a box\". The box has a length of 'a', extending from x = 0 to x = a.\n\n2.  **Recall the Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n    $ψ_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n    where 'n' is the principal quantum number (or energy level), and 'a' is the length of the box.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific State:** The problem specifies the state n = 2. So, the wavefunction for this particular state is:\n    $ψ_2(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\n4.  **Recall the Probability Formula:** The probability, P, of finding the particle in a specific interval from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is found by integrating the probability density, $|ψ(x)|^2$, over that interval:\n    $P = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} |ψ_n(x)|^2 dx$\n\n5.  **Set up the Integral:** We need to find the probability in the interval from $x_1 = 0.495a$ to $x_2 = 0.505a$. Plugging in the values for n=2 and the limits of integration:\n    $|ψ_2(x)|^2 = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n    $P = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx$\n\n6.  **Analyze the Interval and consider Approximation:**\n    *   The center of the interval is $x_c = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 1.000a / 2 = 0.5a$.\n    *   The width of the interval is $\\Delta x = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a$.\n    *   Since the interval $\\Delta x$ is very small compared to the total length 'a', we can approximate the integral. If the integrand doesn't change much over the interval, the probability can be estimated as:\n        $P \\approx |ψ_n(x_c)|^2 \\Delta x$\n    This approximation treats the probability density as a constant equal to its value at the center of the small interval.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Probability using the Approximation:**\n    *   First, we evaluate the probability density at the center of the interval, $x_c = 0.5a$:\n        $|ψ_2(0.5a)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a)}{a}\\right)$\n    *   Simplify the term inside the sine function:\n        $|ψ_2(0.5a)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi a}{2a}\\right) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\pi)$\n    *   We know that $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, the probability density at the center is:\n        $|ψ_2(0.5a)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} (0)^2 = 0$\n    *   Now, apply the approximation formula:\n        $P \\approx (0) \\times (0.01a) = 0$\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **The Node:** The key point in this problem is recognizing that for the n=2 state, the wavefunction has a **node** at the exact center of the box, $x = a/2$. A node is a point where the wavefunction is zero, and consequently, the probability of finding the particle at that exact point is zero.\n*   **The Interval's Location:** The given interval, [0.495a, 0.505a], is a very small interval centered precisely on this node.\n*   **Validity of the Approximation:** Because the probability density is zero at the center of the interval and is a smooth function, its value will be extremely small throughout this tiny interval. The approximation $P \\approx |ψ(x_c)|^2 \\Delta x$ works exceptionally well here and immediately shows that the probability is approximately zero.\n*   **Exact Calculation:** If one were to perform the full integral, the result would be a very small, non-zero number (approximately $6.6 \\times 10^{-6}$), but for all practical purposes and within the typical scope of such physics problems, the answer is considered to be zero. The dominant physical feature is the node at the interval's center.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:** The probability of finding the particle in the small interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is approximately the probability density at the center of the interval (x = 0.5a) multiplied by the width of the interval (0.01a). For the n=2 state, the wavefunction has a node at x = 0.5a, meaning the probability density there is exactly zero. Therefore, the probability is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
