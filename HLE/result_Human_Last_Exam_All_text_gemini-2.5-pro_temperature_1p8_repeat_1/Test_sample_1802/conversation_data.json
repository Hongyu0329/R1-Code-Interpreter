    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of a Pauli Channel\nA quantum channel that acts on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit) is called a Pauli channel if it can be written in the form:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} P_{ab} \\rho P_{ab}^\\dagger $$\nwhere:\n1.  $\\rho$ is the $d \\times d$ density matrix of the input state.\n2.  $\\{P_{ab}\\}$ are the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) for a $d$-dimensional system. These are $d^2$ operators defined as $P_{ab} = X^a Z^b$, for $a,b \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$. Here, $X$ is the shift operator ($X|k\\rangle = |k+1 \\pmod d\\rangle$) and $Z$ is the phase operator ($Z|k\\rangle = e^{2\\pi i k/d} |k\\rangle$). The set of operators $\\{P_{ab}\\}$ forms a complete orthogonal basis for the space of all $d \\times d$ matrices.\n3.  $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{ab} \\ge 0$ for all $a,b$ and $\\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{ab} = 1$.\n\n### Step 2: The Complementary Channel and its Rank\nAny quantum channel $\\Lambda$ described by a set of Kraus operators $\\{K_k\\}$ such that $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_k K_k \\rho K_k^\\dagger$ has a corresponding complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. The complementary channel describes the evolution of the state of the environment that the system interacts with.\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is typically defined as its Choi rank, which is the rank of the channel's Choi matrix. A fundamental result in quantum information theory connects the rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ to the Kraus operators of the original channel $\\Lambda$. The theorem states:\n\n**Theorem:** The Choi rank of the complementary channel, $\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$, is equal to the dimension of the linear space spanned by the operator products $\\{K_k^\\dagger K_l\\}$, where $\\{K_k\\}$ are the Kraus operators of the original channel $\\Lambda$.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{K_k^\\dagger K_l \\mid \\text{for all } k, l\\}) $$\nOur goal is to find the maximum possible value of this rank for any Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Rank for a Pauli Channel\nFor the Pauli channel $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b} p_{ab} P_{ab} \\rho P_{ab}^\\dagger$, we can choose the Kraus operators to be:\n$$ K_{ab} = \\sqrt{p_{ab}} P_{ab} $$\nThese operators are indexed by the pair of integers $(a,b)$, but for simplicity, we can label them with a single index $k = (a,b)$ and $l=(c,d)$. We are interested in the dimension of the space spanned by the operators:\n$$ S = \\text{span} \\{ K_{ab}^\\dagger K_{cd} \\mid a,b,c,d \\text{ s.t. } p_{ab}>0, p_{cd}>0 \\} $$\nLet's analyze the product operators:\n$$ K_{ab}^\\dagger K_{cd} = (\\sqrt{p_{ab}} P_{ab})^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_{cd}} P_{cd}) = \\sqrt{p_{ab} p_{cd}} (P_{ab}^\\dagger P_{cd}) $$\nSince $\\sqrt{p_{ab} p_{cd}}$ is just a scalar coefficient, the dimension of the spanned space is determined by the linear independence of the operators $P_{ab}^\\dagger P_{cd}$.\n\nThe product of two Pauli operators is another Pauli operator, up to a phase factor. Specifically:\n$$ P_{ab}^\\dagger P_{cd} = \\gamma_{a,b,c,d} \\cdot P_{c-a, d-b} $$\nwhere $\\gamma_{a,b,c,d}$ is a complex number with magnitude 1 (a phase). The indices are taken modulo $d$.\n\nTherefore, the space we are considering is:\n$$ S = \\text{span} \\{ P_{c-a, d-b} \\mid \\text{for all } (a,b), (c,d) \\text{ where } p_{ab}>0, p_{cd}>0 \\} $$\n\n### Step 4: Maximizing the Rank\nTo maximize the dimension of the space $S$, we need to be able to generate as many linearly independent Pauli operators $P_{uv}$ as possible. This means we want the set of index differences $\\{(c-a, d-b)\\}$ to be as large as possible.\n\nThis is achieved by allowing the indices $a,b,c,d$ to vary over all possible values. This corresponds to choosing a Pauli channel where all probabilities $p_{ab}$ are non-zero. For example, we can choose the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_{ab} = 1/d^2$ for all $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$.\n\nWhen $p_{ab} > 0$ for all $a,b$, the indices $a,b,c,d$ can range over all values in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$. The difference vector $(u,v) = (c-a, d-b) \\pmod d$ can therefore also take any value in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}^2$. For any desired $(u,v)$, we can simply choose $a=0, b=0$ and $c=u, d=v$.\n\nThus, for such a channel, the set of operators $\\{P_{c-a, d-b}\\}$ is the set of all $d^2$ Pauli operators $\\{P_{uv}\\}$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nThe set of all $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators $\\{P_{uv} \\mid u,v \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for the vector space of all $d \\times d$ matrices, $\\mathcal{M}_d(\\mathbb{C})$. As a basis, they are by definition linearly independent.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the space spanned by all Pauli operators is $d^2$.\n$$ \\dim(S) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{P_{uv}\\}_{u,v=0}^{d-1}) = d^2 $$\nWe have found a specific Pauli channel for which the rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$. The space spanned by the operators $\\{K_k^\\dagger K_l\\}$ is a subspace of $\\mathcal{M}_d(\\mathbb{C})$, so its dimension cannot exceed the dimension of $\\mathcal{M}_d(\\mathbb{C})$, which is $d^2$.\n\nHence, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$."
