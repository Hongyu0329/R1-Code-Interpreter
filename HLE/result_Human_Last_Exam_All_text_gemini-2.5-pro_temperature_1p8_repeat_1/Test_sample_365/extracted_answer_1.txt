The product is the bicyclic ketone shown in the image above, which is formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement followed by tautomerization of the resulting enolate. The full IUPAC name is complex, but the structure is uniquely defined by the described transformation. The final structure is a constitutional isomer of the starting material.
