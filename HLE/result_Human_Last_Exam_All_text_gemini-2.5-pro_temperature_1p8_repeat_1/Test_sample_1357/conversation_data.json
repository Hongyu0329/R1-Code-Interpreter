    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of types of stable reductions of a genus 4 curve with the condition that its Jacobian has good reduction.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conditions\n\nLet `C` be a smooth projective curve of genus `g=4` over a valuation field `K`. Let `Jac(C)` be its Jacobian, which is a `g=4` dimensional abelian variety.\nThe problem has two main components:\n1.  **Stable Reduction of a Curve:** The Stable Reduction Theorem states that after a suitable finite extension of the field `K`, the curve `C` acquires a stable model. The special fiber of this model, denoted `~C`, is a stable curve over the residue field `k`. A stable curve is a complete connected curve with only nodal singularities, satisfying certain conditions on its components. We are interested in the combinatorial \"types\" of `~C`. A type is determined by the dual graph of the components and their geometric genera.\n2.  **Jacobian with Good Reduction:** An abelian variety over `K` has good reduction if it extends to an abelian scheme over the valuation ring `R`. This means the special fiber of its Néron model is an abelian variety of the same dimension.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the conditions using Raynaud's Theorem\n\nA fundamental result by Raynaud (and others, in the context of the Néron-Ogg-Shafarevich criterion) connects the reduction of a curve's Jacobian to the stable reduction of the curve itself.\n\nLet `~C` be the stable reduction of `C`, consisting of irreducible components `~C_i`. Let `Γ` be the dual graph of `~C`. Let `g_i` be the geometric genus of the component `~C_i`. The special fiber of the Néron model of `Jac(C)` is intimately related to the Picard variety of `~C`.\n\nThe condition that `Jac(C)` has good reduction imposes two crucial constraints on the stable reduction `~C`:\n1.  The dual graph `Γ` of `~C` must be a **tree**. This is because the dimension of the toric part of `Pic^0(~C)` is equal to the first Betti number `h^1(Γ)` of the dual graph. For `Jac(C)` to have good reduction, its special fiber must be a pure abelian variety, meaning this toric part is trivial, so `h^1(Γ)=0`.\n2.  The sum of the geometric genera of the components must equal the genus of `C`. That is, **∑ g_i = g = 4**. This comes from comparing the dimension of the good reduction of `Jac(C)` with the dimension of the abelian part of `Pic^0(~C)`.\n\nFurthermore, for a stable curve whose dual graph is a tree, the arithmetic genus is given by `p_a(~C) = ∑ p_a(~C_i)`. We know `p_a(~C) = g = 4` and `p_a(~C_i) = g_i + δ_i` where `δ_i` is the number of nodes on the component `~C_i` itself.\nCombining `∑ g_i = 4` and `∑(g_i + δ_i) = 4`, and knowing `δ_i ≥ 0`, we must have `δ_i = 0` for all components. This means all irreducible components `~C_i` of the stable fiber must be **smooth**.\n\n### Step 3: Classify the types by enumerating decorated trees\n\nThe problem is now reduced to a combinatorial one: find the number of non-isomorphic trees whose vertices are decorated with non-negative integers `g_i` (geometric genera) such that:\na.  The sum of the genera is `∑ g_i = 4`.\nb.  The resulting stable curve `~C` is stable. This implies conditions on the degree `n_i` of a vertex `i` in the tree (which is the number of nodes on component `~C_i`):\n    *   If `g_i = 0` (a rational curve), then `n_i ≥ 3`.\n    *   If `g_i = 1` (an elliptic curve), then `n_i ≥ 1`.\n    *   If `g_i ≥ 2`, there is no restriction on `n_i`.\n\nWe enumerate the types based on the number of components `N` (the number of vertices in the tree). The argument `N-2 ≥ 2k` (where k is number of rational components, derived from degree sum) shows `N ≤ 6`.\n\n*   **N = 1 component:**\n    *   The partition of 4 is just `g_1=4`. The dual graph is a single vertex.\n    *   A smooth genus 4 curve. This is a valid type.\n    *   **1 type.**\n\n*   **N = 2 components:**\n    *   The dual graph is a line with 2 vertices. Both vertices have degree `n=1`.\n    *   Partitions of 4 into 2 parts: `{3, 1}` and `{2, 2}`. (All `g_i` must be > 0 since `n=1 < 3`).\n    *   `{3,1}`: A g=3 curve and a g=1 curve meet at a node. The g=1 component has `n=1`, so it's stable.\n    *   `{2,2}`: Two g=2 curves meet at a node. Stable.\n    *   **2 types.**\n\n*   **N = 3 components:**\n    *   The only tree is a line graph `P_3`. The vertex degrees are `(1, 2, 1)`. No vertex has degree ≥ 3, so no component can have `g=0`.\n    *   The only partition of 4 into 3 positive integers is `{2, 1, 1}`.\n    *   We can arrange these genera on the line graph. The central vertex (degree 2) is distinct from the end vertices (degree 1).\n        1.  Center is `g=2`, ends are `g=1`. (`(1,2,1)`)\n        2.  Center is `g=1`, one end is `g=2`, the other `g=1`. (`(2,1,1)`)\n    *   These are two distinct configurations.\n    *   **2 types.**\n\n*   **N = 4 components:**\n    *   There are two trees: the path `P_4` (degrees 1,2,2,1) and the star `K_{1,3}` (degrees 3,1,1,1).\n    *   Partition `{1,1,1,1}`: all `g_i=1`. All `n_i≥1`, so this is valid on both `P_4` and `K_{1,3}`. (2 types)\n    *   Partitions with `g=0`: requires a vertex of degree `n≥3`. Only `K_{1,3}` has one (the center). So the `g=0` component must be the center of the star. The other 3 components' genera must sum to 4. Partition of 4 into 3 parts: `{2,1,1}`.\n    *   This gives a star graph with a `g=0` center, and `g=2, g=1, g=1` peripherals. All components are stable. (1 type)\n    *   **3 types.**\n\n*   **N = 5 components:**\n    *   `∑ g_i = 4`, so at least one `g=0` component is needed. This requires a vertex of degree `n≥3`. There are two such trees on 5 vertices.\n        1.  A tree with one vertex of degree 3. This vertex must have `g=0`. The other four vertices' genera must sum to 4, so they are all `g=1`. This is a valid stable configuration. (1 type)\n        2.  The star graph `K_{1,4}` with a central vertex of degree 4. This vertex must have `g=0`. The four peripheral components must all have `g=1`. This is also valid. (1 type)\n    *   **2 types.**\n\n*   **N = 6 components:**\n    *   `∑ g_i = 4`, so at least two `g=0` components are needed. This requires a tree with at least two vertices of degree `n≥3`. There are two such trees on 6 vertices.\n        1.  A graph with two degree-3 vertices connected by an edge. These two vertices have `g=0`. The other four (leaf) vertices must have `g=1`. This is valid. (1 type)\n        2.  A graph with two degree-3 vertices separated by a degree-2 vertex. These two vertices have `g=0`. The other four vertices must have `g=1`. This is valid. (1 type)\n    *   **2 types.**\n\n### Step 4: Final Tally\n\nSumming the number of types for each possible number of components:\nTotal types = 1 (N=1) + 2 (N=2) + 2 (N=3) + 3 (N=4) + 2 (N=5) + 2 (N=6) = 12.\n\nThere are 12 distinct types of stable reductions for a genus 4 curve whose Jacobian has good reduction."
