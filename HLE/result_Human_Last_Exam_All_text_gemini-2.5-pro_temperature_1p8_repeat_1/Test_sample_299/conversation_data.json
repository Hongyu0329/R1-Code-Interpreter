    "Answering this question requires analyzing the properties of the function `f` and then counting how many such functions can exist.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze Properties of `f`**\n    The given equation is `f(f(x)) = exp(x)`.\n    *   **Injectivity:** The function `exp(x) = e^x` is strictly increasing and therefore injective (one-to-one). If `f(x_1) = f(x_2)`, then `f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))`, which implies `exp(x_1) = exp(x_2)`. Since `exp` is injective, `x_1 = x_2`. Thus, `f` must be an injective function.\n    *   **Monotonicity:** The function `f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}` is given as continuous. A continuous and injective function on `\\mathbb{R}` must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n\n2.  **Case 1: `f` is strictly decreasing.**\n    *   Let's analyze the function `g(x) = f(x) - x`.\n    *   Since `f` is a strictly decreasing function from `\\mathbb{R}` to `\\mathbb{R}`, we have `lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = -\\infty` and `lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = +\\infty`.\n    *   Therefore, `lim_{x \\to \\infty} g(x) = lim_{x \\to \\infty} (f(x) - x) = -\\infty` and `lim_{x \\to -\\infty} g(x) = lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (f(x) - x) = +\\infty`.\n    *   Since `g(x)` is continuous and goes from `+∞` to `-∞`, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist a point `c \\in \\mathbb{R}` such that `g(c) = 0`, which means `f(c) = c`. This `c` is a fixed point of `f`.\n    *   If `f` has a fixed point `c`, we can apply `f` to both sides: `f(f(c)) = f(c)`.\n    *   Using the property of the fixed point, `f(c)=c`, this becomes `f(f(c)) = c`.\n    *   From the given equation, `f(f(c)) = exp(c)`.\n    *   Therefore, `c` must satisfy the equation `exp(c) = c`.\n    *   However, the equation `e^x = x` has no real solutions. (To see this, consider `h(x) = e^x - x`. Its derivative `h'(x) = e^x - 1` is zero only at `x=0`. The minimum value is `h(0) = e^0 - 0 = 1`. Since the minimum value is positive, `e^x - x` is never zero).\n    *   This is a contradiction. Thus, there are no continuous, strictly decreasing functions `f` that satisfy the given equation.\n\n3.  **Case 2: `f` is strictly increasing.**\n    *   Such a function `f` cannot have any fixed points, because a fixed point `c` would lead to the same contradiction `exp(c) = c`.\n    *   For a continuous function `f(x)` with no fixed points, we must have either `f(x) > x` for all `x \\in \\mathbb{R}` or `f(x) < x` for all `x \\in \\mathbb{R}`.\n    *   Suppose `f(x) < x` for all `x`. Since `f` is strictly increasing, applying `f` to this inequality gives `f(f(x)) < f(x)`. Combining these, we get `f(f(x)) < f(x) < x`.\n    *   This implies `exp(x) < x`. But, as established before, `e^x > x` for all real `x`. So this case is impossible.\n    *   Therefore, any solution `f` must be strictly increasing and satisfy `f(x) > x` for all `x \\in \\mathbb{R}`.\n\n4.  **Constructing and Counting the Solutions**\n    The standard method for constructing such functions (known as fractional iterates) is to define the function on a \"base\" interval and then extend it uniquely to all of `\\mathbb{R}`.\n    *   Let's pick a starting point, say `x=0`. Let `f(0) = a`.\n    *   From `f(x) > x`, we have `a = f(0) > 0`.\n    *   Applying `f` again: `f(f(0)) = f(a)`. From the original equation, `f(f(0)) = exp(0) = 1`. So, `f(a) = 1`.\n    *   Since `f` is strictly increasing and `0 < a`, we must have `f(0) < f(a)`, which implies `a < 1`.\n    *   So, for any solution `f`, `f(0)` must be some number `a \\in (0, 1)`.\n    *   Let's choose a value `a \\in (0, 1)`. On the interval `[0, a]`, the function `f` must map `0` to `a` and `a` to `1`. Since `f` must be continuous and strictly increasing, `f` restricted to `[0, a]` must be a homeomorphism (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) from `[0, a]` to `[a, 1]`. Let's call this homeomorphism `h`.\n    *   For any `a \\in (0,1)`, we are free to choose any such homeomorphism `h: [0, a] \\to [a, 1]`.\n    *   Once `h` is chosen, the function `f` is specified on `[0, a]`. This initial choice determines the function `f` over all of `\\mathbb{R}`. The definition is extended using the original equation `f(f(x)) = exp(x)` and the commutation property `f(exp(x)) = exp(f(x))`, which can be derived from `f(f(f(x)))`. For any `x`, we can find `n \\in \\mathbb{Z}` such that the `n`-th iterate of `ln` applied to `x` falls into the base domain `[0, a]`, and `f(x)` can be uniquely determined from there.\n    *   A distinct choice of `a` or a distinct choice of `h` will result in a different function `f`.\n\n5.  **Determining the Cardinality**\n    *   The set of solutions is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of possible choices we can make. The choice consists of a pair `(a, h)`, where `a \\in (0, 1)` and `h` is a homeomorphism from `[0, a]` to `[a, 1]`.\n    *   Let's fix `a` to a specific value, for example `a = 1/2`.\n    *   We now need to count the number of homeomorphisms `h: [0, 1/2] \\to [1/2, 1]`. This is equivalent to counting the number of homeomorphisms from `[0, 1]` to `[0, 1]` that fix the endpoints, which can be done by a simple linear scaling.\n    *   There are infinitely many such functions. To see this, consider the family of functions `\\psi_p(t) = t^p` for `p \\in (0, \\infty)`. Each `\\psi_p` is a distinct homeomorphism of `[0, 1]`. This family alone has the cardinality of the positive real numbers, which is `\\mathfrak{c}` (the cardinality of the continuum).\n    *   Thus, for a fixed `a`, there are `\\mathfrak{c}` possible choices for `h`. Each choice generates a distinct solution `f`.\n    *   This means there are at least `\\mathfrak{c}` solutions.\n    *   The set of all continuous functions from `\\mathbb{R}` to `\\mathbb{R}` has cardinality `\\mathfrak{c}`. (A continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on the dense set of rational numbers `\\mathbb{Q}`, so `|C(\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{R})| = |\\mathbb{R}^\\mathbb{Q}| = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}`).\n    *   Since our set of solutions is a subset of all continuous functions, its cardinality cannot exceed `\\mathfrak{c}`.\n    *   Since the cardinality is at least `\\mathfrak{c}` and at most `\\mathfrak{c}`, it must be exactly `\\mathfrak{c}`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe cardinality of the set of continuous functions `f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}` satisfying `f(f(x)) = exp(x)` is the cardinality of the continuum. This is the same as the cardinality of the set of real numbers, `|\\mathbb{R}|`, often denoted by `\\mathfrak{c}` or `c`.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum>>>"
