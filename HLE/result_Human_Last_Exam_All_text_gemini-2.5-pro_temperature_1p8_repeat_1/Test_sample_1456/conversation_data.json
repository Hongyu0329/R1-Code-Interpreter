    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point. By virtue of being a connected metric space with more than one point, a nondegenerate continuum must have the cardinality of the continuum, `c = 2^{\\aleph_0}`.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p` is the set of all points `x` in `X` for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing both `p` and `x`. (A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum not equal to the whole space).\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continuum:**\n    *   A continuum is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   A continuum is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable.\n\n### Step 2: Relating the Number of Composants to Decomposability\n\nThis is the most critical part of the analysis. There is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory that connects these concepts:\n\n*   **Theorem 1:** A metric continuum `K` has exactly **one** composant if and only if it is decomposable. If it is decomposable, its single composant is the space `K` itself.\n*   **Theorem 2:** A metric continuum `K` has more than one composant if and only if it is indecomposable. In this case, it has **`c`** (the cardinality of the continuum) pairwise disjoint, dense composants.\n\nOur goal is to find the *largest possible number* of composants. From these theorems, the possible numbers of composants are 1 or `c`. The largest value is clearly `c`. So, the question transforms into: \"Can the product of two nondegenerate continua be an indecomposable continuum?\"\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Decomposability of a Product Space\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua, and let `Z = X \\times Y` be their product space. We need to determine when `Z` can be indecomposable.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case where `Z` is decomposable. This happens if either `X` or `Y` is decomposable.\n\n*   **Observation:** If `X` is decomposable, then `X \\times Y` is decomposable.\n*   **Proof:** Suppose `X` is decomposable. By definition, `X = A \\cup B`, where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `X`. Then the product space `Z` can be written as `Z = X \\times Y = (A \\cup B) \\times Y = (A \\times Y) \\cup (B \\times Y)`.\n    *   `A \\times Y` is a continuum because it's a product of two continua. It's a *proper* subcontinuum of `Z` because `A` is a proper subset of `X`.\n    *   Similarly, `B \\times Y` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z`.\n    *   Thus, `Z` is the union of two of its proper subcontinua, which means `Z` is decomposable.\n    *   By the same logic, if `Y` is decomposable, `Z` is also decomposable.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** If either `X` or `Y` is decomposable, their product `X \\times Y` is decomposable and has only **one** composant.\n\n### Step 4: Achieving an Indecomposable Product\n\nTo get the maximum number of composants (`c`), we need the product space `Z = X \\times Y` to be indecomposable. Based on Step 3, a necessary condition is that **both `X` and `Y` must be indecomposable continua**.\n\nThe remaining question is whether this is possible. Does there exist a pair of indecomposable continua `X` and `Y` whose product `X \\times Y` is also indecomposable? The answer is yes. This is a classic, though non-trivial, result in continuum theory.\n\n*   **Existence of an Example:** Let `P` be the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is a famous example of a nondegenerate continuum that is not only indecomposable but also *hereditarily indecomposable* (meaning every one of its nondegenerate subcontinua is also indecomposable).\n*   **Theorem (R. H. Bing, 1951):** The product of any two chainable indecomposable continua is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc is a chainable continuum.\n*   Therefore, if we take `X = P` and `Y = P`, their product `Z = P \\times P` is an indecomposable continuum.\n\nOther examples exist, such as the product of two Knaster continua (bucket-handles) or two solenoids.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  To maximize the number of composants, the product space `Z = X \\times Y` must be indecomposable.\n2.  We have shown that such an indecomposable product can be formed, for example, by taking `X` and `Y` to both be the pseudo-arc.\n3.  According to Theorem 2, any indecomposable metric continuum has `c` (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n4.  Can the number be larger than `c`? No. The number of composants is the cardinality of a partition of the space `Z` into disjoint subsets. This number cannot be larger than the cardinality of `Z` itself. Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate continua, `|X| = c` and `|Y| = c`. Thus, `|Z| = |X \\times Y| = c \\times c = c`. The number of composants is therefore at most `c`.\n\nSince the number of composants can be `c` and cannot be greater than `c`, the largest possible number is `c`.\n\n<<<c>>>"
