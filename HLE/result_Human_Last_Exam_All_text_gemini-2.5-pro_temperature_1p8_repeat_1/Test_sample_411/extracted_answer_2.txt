(a) The diversity orders are 1 for $\mathbf{S}_a$, 1 for $\mathbf{S}_b$, and 2 for $\mathbf{S}_c$.
(b) The code $\mathbf{S}_c$ provides the maximum directivity because it achieves the full diversity order of 2, which is the maximum possible for a 2-transmit antenna system. Codes $\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\mathbf{S}_b$ do not provide any diversity gain as their diversity order is 1.
