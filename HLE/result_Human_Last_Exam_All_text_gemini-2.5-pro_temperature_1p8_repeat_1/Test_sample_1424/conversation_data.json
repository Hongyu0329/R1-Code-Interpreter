    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the functional dependence of the bare Green's function on single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$) in the Path Integral Formalism**\n\nThe Green's function, in general, is a two-point correlation function. The *bare* or *free* Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. In the Feynman path integral formalism, it is calculated from an action that only contains the free (non-interacting) part, $S_0$.\n\nFor a system described by fields $\\psi(x)$ (which can be complex fields for bosons or Grassmann fields for fermions), the bare Green's function between spacetime points $x$ and $y$ is given by:\n$G_0(x, y) = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, \\psi(x) \\psi^*(y) e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\, e^{iS_0[\\psi^*, \\psi]}}$\nHere, the integral is a functional integral over all possible field configurations.\n\n**Step 2: Express the Free Action ($S_0$) in terms of Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$)**\n\nTo see the dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$, it is most convenient to work in the basis that diagonalizes the free single-particle Hamiltonian, $\\hat{H}_0$. The eigenstates are labeled by a quantum number $k$ (e.g., momentum), and the corresponding energy eigenvalues are $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe free Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H}_0 = \\sum_k \\epsilon_k \\hat{c}_k^\\dagger \\hat{c}_k$, where $\\hat{c}_k^\\dagger$ and $\\hat{c}_k$ are creation and annihilation operators for a particle in state $k$.\n\nThe free action (in real time $t$) corresponding to this Hamiltonian is:\n$S_0 = \\int dt \\, L_0 = \\int dt \\sum_k \\psi_k^*(t) (i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(t)$\n(Here $\\psi_k$ are the field components in the eigenbasis). For calculations in statistical mechanics, it is often more convenient to use the imaginary time (Matsubara) formalism, where the action becomes:\n$S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\psi_k^*(\\tau) (\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\nwhere $\\tau$ is imaginary time, $\\beta=1/k_B T$, and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n\n**Step 3: Transform to Frequency-Momentum Space**\n\nThe calculation simplifies enormously in frequency-momentum space. We perform a Fourier transform from the time domain ($t$ or $\\tau$) to the frequency domain ($\\omega$ or $i\\omega_n$).\n*   In real time: $i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow \\hbar\\omega$\n*   In imaginary time: $\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} \\rightarrow -i\\hbar\\omega_n$ (where $i\\omega_n$ are the discrete Matsubara frequencies)\n\nLet's use the imaginary time formalism, which is standard in many-body theory. The action becomes a simple algebraic sum:\n$S_0 = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{k,n} \\psi_k^*(i\\omega_n) (-i\\hbar\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_k(i\\omega_n)$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Green's Function from the Action**\n\nThe path integral for the free theory is a Gaussian integral. A key property of such integrals is that the two-point correlator (the Green's function) is simply the inverse of the operator appearing in the quadratic action.\n\nFrom the action in Step 3, the \"operator\" for each mode $(k, n)$ is the term $(-i\\hbar\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu)$. Taking the inverse gives the Matsubara Green's function $\\mathcal{G}_0(k, i\\omega_n)$:\n$\\mathcal{G}_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{-i\\hbar\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu} = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$ (The second form is a common convention).\n\n**Step 5: Obtain the Real-Time Green's Function**\n\nThe physically intuitive real-time Green's functions (retarded, advanced, or time-ordered) are found by analytic continuation from the Matsubara Green's function, by replacing the discrete imaginary frequency $i\\hbar\\omega_n$ with a continuous complex variable $z$, and then taking the limit as $z$ approaches the real axis, $z \\rightarrow \\hbar\\omega \\pm i\\eta$, where $\\eta$ is an infinitesimal positive number.\n\nFor example, the retarded Green's function $G_0^R$ is obtained by the substitution $i\\hbar\\omega_n \\rightarrow \\hbar\\omega + i\\eta$. Setting $\\hbar=1$ for simplicity:\n$G_0^R(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{(\\omega + i\\eta) - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nThe time-ordered Green's function $G_0$ at zero temperature has a slightly different form for its causal prescription:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\nThis form correctly describes the propagation of particles (for states above the Fermi level, $\\epsilon_k > \\mu$) and holes (for states below the Fermi level, $\\epsilon_k < \\mu$).\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Framework:** The final form of the Green's function depends on the specific formalism (real-time vs. imaginary-time/Matsubara) and the desired boundary conditions (retarded, advanced, time-ordered). However, the core algebraic dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ is the same in all cases.\n2.  **Chemical Potential ($\\mu$):** In many-body systems, energies are measured relative to the chemical potential $\\mu$. The relevant energy that enters the propagator is the excitation energy $\\xi_k = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$.\n3.  **Causality ($i\\eta$):** The infinitesimal imaginary part, $+i\\eta$ or $-i\\eta$, is not a mathematical triviality. It is fundamentally required by causality and encodes the time-ordering of events (i.e., whether the function describes propagation forward or backward in time). Its sign determines whether the Green's function is retarded or advanced.\n4.  **Inverse Relationship:** The most important conceptual point is that the Green's function is the *inverse* of the wave operator in the free action. Since the free Hamiltonian is diagonal in the energy eigenbasis, the wave operator becomes a simple algebraic expression in frequency-momentum space, making its inversion straightforward.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe bare Green's function $G_0$, in frequency-momentum space (with frequency $\\omega$ and quantum number $k$), has an inverse functional dependence on the difference between the frequency and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe general form can be written as:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\xi_k}$\nwhere $\\xi_k = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$ is the single-particle energy measured relative to the chemical potential. The exact expression includes a crucial infinitesimal imaginary part, $i\\eta$, which enforces causality. For the time-ordered Green's function at zero temperature, the specific functional form is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n<<<In frequency ($\\omega$) and momentum ($k$) space, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The standard expression for the time-ordered Green's function at zero temperature is $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$, where $\\mu$ is the chemical potential and $i\\eta$ is an infinitesimal term that enforces causality.>>>"
