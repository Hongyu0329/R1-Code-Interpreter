In frequency ($\omega$) and momentum ($k$) space, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \omega)$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. The standard expression for the time-ordered Green's function at zero temperature is $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\omega - (\epsilon_k - \mu) + i\eta \, \text{sgn}(\epsilon_k - \mu)}$, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential and $i\eta$ is an infinitesimal term that enforces causality.
