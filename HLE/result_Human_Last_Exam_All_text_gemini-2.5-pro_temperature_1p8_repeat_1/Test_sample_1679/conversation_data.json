    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question requires us to find the first film that satisfies three conditions:\n1.  It must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n2.  It must visually depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n3.  It must be the *earliest* film on the list of Best Picture winners to do so.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisks\"**\nThere are two famous obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt.\n*   One still stands at the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   The second was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands in the center of the **Place de la Concorde in Paris**.\nTherefore, a qualifying film could show either the obelisk in Luxor or the one in Paris.\n\n**Step 3: Chronologically examine Best Picture winners for relevant locations**\nWe need to go through the list of Best Picture winners, year by year, looking for one set in either Paris (specifically featuring the Place de la Concorde) or Luxor, Egypt.\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:** Early winners like *Wings* (1927/28), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930), and *It Happened One Night* (1934) are not set in locations that would feature an obelisk. *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) is set in Paris, but its scenes focus on interiors and specific plot-related locations, with no prominent shots of the Place de la Concorde.\n\n*   **1940s:** The most likely candidate from this decade is *Casablanca* (1943). It contains a famous flashback montage of Paris. However, upon close inspection, this montage features Rick and Ilsa driving past the Arc de Triomphe and shots of the Eiffel Tower, but it does not include a clear depiction of the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk.\n\n*   **1950s:** This decade provides our first definitive candidate.\n    *   **An American in Paris (1951):** This film won Best Picture for 1951. It is a musical celebrating the city of Paris. The climax is a 17-minute ballet sequence that acts as a visual tour of famous Parisian locations, designed in the style of French painters. In this sequence, there is a segment modeled after the work of Raoul Dufy that explicitly features a stylized set of the Place de la Concorde, with its fountain and the Luxor Obelisk clearly visible.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm that *An American in Paris* is the first**\nSince our chronological search has revealed no clear depiction of a Luxor Obelisk in any Best Picture winner before 1951, *An American in Paris* is the first. Other later winners, such as *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) and *Gigi* (1958), also feature the Parisian obelisk, but they came after 1951. No Best Picture winner from this era is noted for scenes filmed at the Luxor Temple in Egypt itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk (the one in Paris's Place de la Concorde) on-screen is *An American in Paris*.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
