    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the most probable mechanism that explains two outcomes for duplicated genes:\n    *   **Retention:** The duplicate gene is kept in the genome and is not lost or silenced. The most common fate of a duplicate gene is to become a non-functional pseudogene because it is redundant, so a special mechanism is needed to retain it.\n    *   **Divergence:** The two copies (the original and the duplicate) evolve to become different from each other in sequence and, consequently, in function.\n\n2.  **Analyze Answer Choice A: Gene conversion.**\n    *   **Definition:** A non-reciprocal process where one gene copy is \"converted\" to the sequence of another homologous gene.\n    *   **Impact:** This process causes homogenization, making the gene copies more similar. It actively works *against* divergence. Therefore, it is not the correct mechanism.\n\n3.  **Analyze Answer Choice B: Pseudogenization.**\n    *   **Definition:** The process where a gene accumulates disabling mutations and becomes non-functional (a pseudogene).\n    *   **Impact:** This is the most common fate of a redundant duplicate gene. It describes the *loss* of the gene's function, not its *retention* as a working gene. Therefore, it is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Analyze Answer Choice C: Neofunctionalization.**\n    *   **Definition:** A model where one gene copy retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations and acquires a completely new, beneficial function.\n    *   **Impact:** This model explains both retention and divergence. **Retention** occurs because both the old and new functions are beneficial and maintained by natural selection. **Divergence** occurs because the second copy must change to gain the new function. This is a valid, but potentially rare, mechanism because it requires a specific, beneficial gain-of-function mutation to occur before the gene is silenced by more common degenerative mutations.\n\n5.  **Analyze Answer Choice D: Subfunctionalization.**\n    *   **Definition:** A model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model) where the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions (or was expressed in multiple tissues/times). After duplication, each copy accumulates degenerative mutations that inactivate different subfunctions. For example, copy 1 loses function A but keeps B, while copy 2 loses function B but keeps A.\n    *   **Impact:** This model also explains both retention and divergence. **Retention** occurs because now both copies are required to perform the full range of the original gene's functions. Losing either copy would be detrimental. **Divergence** occurs as the two copies specialize by losing different ancestral subfunctions. This mechanism is considered highly probable because it relies on common, random loss-of-function mutations rather than rare gain-of-function ones.\n\n6.  **Analyze Answer Choice E: Adaptive radiation.**\n    *   **Definition:** A macroevolutionary process where an organismal lineage rapidly diversifies to fill different ecological niches.\n    *   **Impact:** This is a pattern of evolution at the species level, not a molecular mechanism acting on genes within a genome. While gene duplication can provide the genetic fuel for adaptive radiation, it is not the mechanism of retention and divergence itself. Therefore, it operates at the wrong biological scale.\n\n7.  **Compare Plausible Choices (C vs. D):** Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models. The question asks which is \"most likely\". Subfunctionalization is often considered more likely to be responsible for the initial preservation of duplicate genes because it relies on high-frequency degenerative mutations, which happen much more often than the rare, beneficial, gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization. Subfunctionalization provides a more common pathway to escape pseudogenization, thus ensuring the retention of both gene copies so they can diverge over time.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** Based on the higher probability of the underlying mutational events, subfunctionalization is considered the most likely mechanism for the widespread retention and divergence of duplicate genes observed in eukaryotic genomes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
