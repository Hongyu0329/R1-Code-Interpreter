    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A specific philosophical concept—the decomposition of the \"notion of hallmark\".\n    *   **The Decomposition:** The hallmark is broken down into two specific categories: \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n    *   **The Source:** The philosopher who made this distinction belongs to the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\" of philosophy.\n\n2.  **Identify the Lviv-Warsaw School:**\n    *   This was a highly influential school of logic and analytical philosophy in Poland, active primarily between the World Wars (c. 1918-1939).\n    *   Its members were known for their commitment to clarity, logical rigor, and scientific methodology in philosophy.\n    *   Key figures include the founder Kazimierz Twardowski, and his students such as Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Alfred Tarski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conceptual Distinction: Hallmark, Symptom, and Signal:**\n    *   This distinction falls under the fields of semiotics (the study of signs) and epistemology (the study of knowledge).\n    *   A **hallmark** (or more generally, a *sign*) is something that indicates the existence of something else. The question is about how we classify these signs.\n    *   A **symptom** (sometimes translated as an index or natural sign) has a natural or causal connection to what it signifies. The connection exists independently of human intention. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of an illness. One infers the cause from the effect.\n    *   A **signal** (or conventional sign) has an artificial or conventional connection to what it signifies. The link is created by agreement, usually for the purpose of communication. For example, a red light is a signal to stop; the word \"tree\" is a signal for the concept of a tree.\n\n4.  **Connect the Distinction to a Philosopher from the School:**\n    *   We need to find which member of the Lviv-Warsaw School is known for this specific semiotic analysis.\n    *   While many members worked on logic and language, **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is the philosopher most famously associated with this particular distinction in his work on epistemology and the philosophy of language.\n    *   Ajdukiewicz was deeply interested in the theory of meaning and how signs (in Polish, *znak*) function. He systematically analyzed the different ways in which one thing can be a sign of another. His breakdown of signs into natural signs (symptoms, *oznaki*) and conventional signs (signals, *sygnały*) is a central part of his semiotic theory.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the notion of hallmark/sign into symptoms (natural signs) and signals (conventional signs) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n***\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
