    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to the period of the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), led by Lê Lợi against the rule of the Ming Dynasty in Vietnam (known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination). General Mu Sheng (沐晟) was a key Ming military commander tasked with suppressing this rebellion.\n\n2.  **Define \"First Major Defeat\":** While Mu Sheng participated in several campaigns, his most significant role and subsequent defeat as a commander of a large expeditionary force occurred in the final stage of the war in 1427. The Ming court sent a two-pronged pincer attack to crush the rebellion once and for all.\n    *   One army, led by General Liu Sheng, advanced from Guangxi (northeast).\n    *   The other army, commanded by General Mu Sheng, advanced from Yunnan (northwest).\n    The complete failure of his part of this grand offensive constitutes his \"first major defeat\" in this decisive campaign.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Decisive Battle:**\n    *   The army led by Liu Sheng was ambushed and utterly destroyed at the Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang (in modern Lạng Sơn and Bắc Giang provinces). Liu Sheng himself was killed.\n    *   Upon learning of this catastrophe, Mu Sheng's army, which was advancing down the Chảy River from Yunnan, lost its will to fight. The Lam Sơn forces, led by commanders Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, had already established defensive positions to block his advance.\n    *   The Vietnamese forces engaged Mu Sheng at a series of locations, most notably the **Battle of Khả Lưu** (trận Khả Lưu) and the associated campaign at **Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá**. Here, Mu Sheng's army was attacked and decisively defeated.\n\n4.  **Locate the Battlefield on a Modern Map:**\n    *   The invasion route from Yunnan into the Red River Delta followed the Red River (Sông Hồng) and its major tributaries, primarily the Chảy River (Sông Chảy).\n    *   Historical records and maps from Vietnamese sources, such as the *Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư* (Complete Annals of Đại Việt), place the battlefields of Khả Lưu, Lãnh Câu, and Đan Xá along the Chảy River.\n    *   This historical area is located within the territory of the modern-day **Phú Thọ Province**. Specifically, the strategic area around Đoan Hùng District, where the Chảy River meets the Lô River, is identified as the site of this campaign.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Faced with defeat at Khả Lưu and the news of Liu Sheng's annihilation, Mu Sheng abandoned his offensive, burned his camp, discarded heavy equipment, and retreated back to Yunnan, marking a complete failure of his mission. This decisive battle took place in the area that is now Phú Thọ Province.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing Generals:** It is crucial not to confuse Mu Sheng's defeat with those of other Ming generals. Liu Sheng was defeated in Lạng Sơn/Bắc Giang, and Wang Tong was defeated earlier at Tốt Động-Chúc Động (near modern Hanoi). Mu Sheng's defeat occurred on the northwestern front.\n*   **Geographic Specificity:** The invasion route from Yunnan is key. This path dictated that the battle would take place in the northwest of the Red River Delta, confirming Phú Thọ as the correct location.\n*   **Significance of the Battle:** The defeat at Khả Lưu, though less famous than the annihilation of Liu Sheng's army, was strategically critical. It eliminated the second prong of the Ming attack and sealed the ultimate victory for the Lam Sơn uprising.\n\n<<<Phú Thọ Province>>>"
