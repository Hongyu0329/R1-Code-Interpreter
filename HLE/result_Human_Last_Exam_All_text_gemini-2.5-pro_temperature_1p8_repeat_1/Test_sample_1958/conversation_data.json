    "This is a complex literary and historical question that requires careful definition of its terms. Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyzing the Question and Identifying Careful Points\n\nThe question is: \"Which is the first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play, and which play is it mentioned in?\"\n\nHere are the careful points we must consider:\n\n1.  **\"By name\":** This is the most crucial constraint. We are not looking for allusions, paraphrases, or characters named after biblical figures (like Adam, Noah, or Mark Antony). We are looking for the actual *name of the book* itself, such as \"Genesis\" or \"Romans.\" This can include adjectival forms like \"Corinthian,\" if the context clearly points to the book.\n2.  **\"Canonical order\":** This sets our search pattern. We must start at the beginning of the Protestant Bible (the version Shakespeare would have known) and proceed book by book. We cannot simply find the first mention of any biblical book. The answer must be the one that appears earliest in the biblical table of contents. The order is Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers... then Matthew, Mark, Luke, John... Acts, Romans, Corinthians, etc.\n3.  **\"First book\":** Once we find a qualifying mention, our search is over. For example, if we find a mention of \"Leviticus\" and also a mention of \"Romans,\" the answer is \"Leviticus\" because it comes first in the Bible's canonical order.\n4.  **Context is Key:** Some biblical book titles are common words (e.g., Numbers, Acts, Romans). We must verify that the context of the mention refers to the biblical book and not to simple counting, deeds, or citizens of Rome.\n\n### Step 2: Step-by-Step Search and Analysis\n\nFollowing the canonical order, we will search through Shakespeare's plays for a named mention of each biblical book.\n\n*   **Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus:** These books are not mentioned by name in any of Shakespeare's plays.\n*   **Numbers:** The word \"numbers\" appears hundreds of times in Shakespeare. However, in every single case, it refers to counting, quantities, or poetry/verse (as in \"I lisped in numbers, for the numbers came\"). No mention refers to the Book of Numbers.\n*   **Deuteronomy through Malachi (rest of Old Testament):** Exhaustive searches of the Shakespearean canon show no named mentions of these books (e.g., Joshua, Judges, Ruth, Psalms, Proverbs, Isaiah, etc.). While Shakespeare quotes or alludes to the Psalms and Proverbs frequently, he never mentions the books by name.\n*   **Matthew, Mark, Luke, John:** The names Matthew, Mark, and Luke appear as character names, but never as a reference to the Gospels. John appears very frequently as a name (King John, Don John, John of Gaunt), but again, never referring to the Gospel.\n*   **Acts:** The word \"acts\" is common, but always refers to deeds or actions (e.g., \"the acts of kings\"). It never refers to the Book of Acts.\n*   **Romans:** The word \"Romans\" appears constantly in plays like *Julius Caesar* and *Coriolanus*, but it always refers to the citizens of Rome. It is never a reference to the *Epistle to the Romans*.\n*   **Corinthians:** Here we find our first valid match. The reference appears in adjectival form, which is a direct and unmistakable link to the people addressed in the biblical book and thus to the book itself. In the Elizabethan era, \"a Corinthian\" was slang for a licentious person, a party-goer, or a \"lad of mettle.\" This reputation came directly from the decadent reputation of ancient Corinth and, more specifically, from St. Paul's *Epistles to the Corinthians*, in which he admonishes the church there for its immorality and disorderly conduct.\n\n    The mention occurs in **_The First Part of King Henry the Fourth_** (Act 2, Scene 4).\n\n    In the Boar's Head Tavern, Prince Hal is boasting about how well he gets along with the common drawers (servers), who see him as one of them rather than a proud prince:\n    > \"They take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack, like Falstaff, but **a Corinthian**, a lad of mettle, a good boy...\"\n\nSince this is the first book we have encountered in canonical order that is mentioned by name (via its direct adjectival form), our search concludes. Later books like \"Ephesians\" are also mentioned with similar slang intent (*Henry IV, Part 2*), but since Corinthians comes before Ephesians in the Bible, Corinthians is the correct answer.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the **Epistle to the Corinthians**. It is mentioned in the play **_The First Part of King Henry the Fourth_**.\n\n<<<The book is Corinthians, and the play is The First Part of King Henry the Fourth.>>>"
