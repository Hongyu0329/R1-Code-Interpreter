    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\nThe meter is an Iambic Senarius (six feet), typical for Roman comedy (like Plautus, from whose play *Trinummus* this line is taken). The base foot is an iamb (S L), but various substitutions are permitted.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Elisions**\n*   The word `bene` ends in a vowel (`-e`) and the next word `esse` begins with a vowel (`e-`). This results in an elision. The `-e` of `bene` is dropped, so we scan `ben' esse`.\n\n**Step 2: Syllabification and Determining Quantity (Length)**\nWe determine the quantity of each syllable as either Long (L) or Short (S) based on the rules of Latin prosody.\n\n1.  **et**: The vowel `e` is naturally short. However, this is a case of Iambic Shortening (*brevis in longo*), a common feature in Plautus. A syllable that is long by position (like `et` before `tibi`, `...et t...`) can be scanned as short if it is unstressed. To make the meter work, `et` must be scanned as short.\n    *   `et` -> **S**\n\n2.  **tibi**: Composed of two syllables, `ti-bi`. Both `i` vowels are naturally short, and neither is made long by position.\n    *   `tibi` -> **S S**\n\n3.  **bene esse**: After elision, we scan the syllables of `bene` (partially) and `esse`. The `be-` from `bene` and the elided `-ne` precede `esse`.\n    *   The syllables we scan are from `esse`: `es-se`.\n    *   `es-`: The vowel `e` is followed by two consonants (`ss`). This makes the syllable long by position. -> **L**\n    *   `-se`: The vowel `e` is followed by a consonant cluster formed by the `-s-` in `esse` and the `s-` from the beginning of the next word, `soli`. This `...se s...` sequence makes the syllable long by position. -> **L**\n    *   `esse` -> **L L**\n\n4.  **soli**: From `sōlus, -a, -um`. This is the dative singular, `sōlī`. Both the `o` and the `i` are long by nature.\n    *   `soli` -> **L L**\n\n5.  **quom**: An older spelling of `cum`. The vowel `o` is naturally short. However, it is followed by the consonant `m` at the end of the word and the consonant `s` at the beginning of the next word (`sibi`). This `...om s...` sequence makes the syllable long by position.\n    *   `quom` -> **L**\n\n6.  **sibi**: Composed of two syllables, `si-bi`. Both `i` vowels are naturally short.\n    *   `sibi` -> **S S**\n\n7.  **sit**: The vowel `i` is short. However, it is followed by the `t` at the end of the word and the `m` at the beginning of the next word (`male`). This `...it m...` sequence makes the syllable long by position.\n    *   `sit` -> **L**\n\n8.  **male**: The adverb `mălĕ`.\n    *   `ma-`: The vowel `a` is short. -> **S**\n    *   `-le`: The vowel `e` is short. However, it is the final syllable of the line. In iambic verse, this final syllable is *anceps* (of doubtful quantity) and fills a long position, so it is scanned as long. -> **L**\n    *   `male` -> **S L**\n\n**Step 3: Assembling the Metrical Pattern**\nPutting the quantities together, we get a sequence of 13 syllables:\n`S S S L L L L S S L S L`\n\n**Step 4: Dividing the Pattern into Feet**\nThe line has 13 syllables, while a standard Iambic Senarius has 12. This indicates that one long position has been \"resolved\" into two short syllables.\n\n*   **Foot 1**: The line begins with `S S S`. This is a Tribrach, a valid substitution for an iamb (`S L`), where the long syllable is resolved (`L -> S S`). The three syllables are from the words `et tibi`.\n*   **Foot 2**: The next two syllables are `L L`. This is a Spondee, a common substitution for an iamb. These syllables come from the word `esse`.\n*   **Foot 3**: The next two syllables are `L L`. This is also a Spondee. These syllables come from the word `soli`.\n*   **Foot 4**: The next two syllables are `L S`. This forms a Trochee. In classical epic, this would be a metrical fault. However, in Plautine comedy, a trochee is sometimes allowed in the fourth foot, especially when it occurs at a caesura (metrical pause) and splits across two words (`quom si-`). We accept this as a poetic license.\n*   **Foot 5**: The next two syllables are `S L`. This is a perfect Iamb. These syllables come from `-bi` of `sibi` and the word `sit`.\n*   **Foot 6**: The final two syllables are `S L`. This is also a perfect Iamb, a standard ending for the line. These syllables come from the word `male`.\n\nThe final scansion, divided by feet, is:\n\n`S S S` | `L L` | `L L` | `L S` | `S L` | `S L`\n\n<<<S S S L L L L L S L S L>>>"
