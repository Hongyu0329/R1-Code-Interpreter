    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Character**\nThe character in question is 謄. This is a Jōyō kanji meaning \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe\".\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the Character**\nTo find the radical (bushu 部首), we need to break the character down into its component parts. Japanese kanji are often composed of a radical (which typically suggests the meaning) and a phonetic component (which typically suggests the sound).\nThe character 謄 can be split into a left part and a right part:\n*   **Left side:** 言\n*   **Right side:** A phonetic component derived from 朕.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Radical**\nIn a left-right character structure (known as a hen-tsukuri, 偏旁), the left-hand part is most often the radical.\n*   The left part is 言. This radical means \"word\" or \"speech\".\n*   This makes sense semantically, as the character 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"transcribe\", actions related to words and text.\n*   Therefore, the radical for 謄 is 言.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Name of the Radical**\nThe question asks for the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name. Radicals have specific names, often based on their meaning and their position in the character.\n*   The radical is 言. The reading for this kanji is \"gon\" (On'yomi) or \"iu/koto\" (Kun'yomi).\n*   When a radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏), which sometimes becomes \"ben\" when voiced.\n*   For the 言 radical on the left side, the common name is a combination of its reading \"gon\" and the position name \"ben\".\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Answer**\n*   The radical is 言.\n*   Its position is on the left, so it's a \"hen\" (or \"ben\").\n*   The name is \"Gonben\" (ごんべん).\n*   The Hepburn transcription is \"Gonben\". This is consistent with the example given (媛 -> Onnahen, from 女 onna + 偏 hen).\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
