    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** The German painter Curt Querner.\n    *   **Artwork:** A self-portrait.\n    *   **Date:** 1933.\n    *   **Context:** Painted after he escaped from the Gestapo (or more accurately, the SA, as the Gestapo was just being formed).\n    *   **Core Query:** Identify the object he holds in his hand and understand its symbolism as an act of resistance.\n\n2.  **Careful Points to Consider:**\n    *   **Historical Accuracy:** It is crucial to verify the events of 1933. Curt Querner was a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists (ASSO). After the Nazi seizure of power, he was arrested by the SA in March 1933. He managed to escape and went into hiding, which is when he painted this specific self-portrait. This context is essential for interpreting the painting's symbols.\n    *   **Visual Analysis of the Painting:** In the \"Self-Portrait\" of 1933, Querner depicts himself with an intense, confrontational gaze. He is holding an object in each hand. In his left hand is a lit pipe, and in his right hand, he firmly grips a hammer. The question asks what he holds \"in his hand\" (singular), implying a primary symbolic object.\n    *   **Symbolic Interpretation:** We must analyze the symbolism of both objects within the established historical context.\n        *   **The Pipe:** This could be seen as a personal item, representing a moment of calm, reflection, or simply part of his everyday identity. While personal identity can be a form of resistance, it is not as overtly political as the other object.\n        *   **The Hammer:** This is the key symbol. A hammer is the quintessential tool of the worker, the craftsman, and the laborer. In the 20th century, the hammer became a powerful and internationally recognized symbol of the proletariat and the communist movement (most famously alongside the sickle in the flag of the Soviet Union).\n    *   **Connecting Symbol to Context:** Given that Querner was a communist artist arrested by the Nazis for his political beliefs, holding a hammer is a direct and defiant statement. It symbolizes:\n        *   His unwavering allegiance to the working class and communist ideals.\n        *   The strength and power of the proletariat, which the Nazis sought to suppress.\n        *   Resistance against the fascist regime. It is not just a tool; it is a political weapon and an emblem of his ideology.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Identify the Painting:** The painting is Curt Querner's \"Selbstbildnis\" (Self-Portrait) from 1933.\n2.  **Observe the Contents:** The artist holds a pipe and a hammer.\n3.  **Determine the Symbol of Resistance:** Based on Querner's communist affiliations and his recent escape from Nazi authorities, the hammer is the clear and intended symbol of political resistance. It represents the working class (proletariat) and his continued defiance against the fascist regime that arrested him. The intense stare directed at the viewer reinforces this challenging and unyielding stance.\n\nTherefore, the object held as a symbol of resistance is the hammer.\n\n<<<A hammer>>>"
