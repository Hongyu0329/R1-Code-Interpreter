The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single, fixed value, as it differs based on the specific application.
- For the **Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, a moderate Ni content is required to provide sufficient active sites while leveraging the support. The optimal molar Ni/Ce ratio is typically in the range of **0.25 to 0.5**.
- For **water splitting**, a lower Ni content is generally preferred, where Ni acts as a dopant to enhance the ceria support. The optimal molar Ni/Ce ratio is often found to be around **0.1 to 0.15**.

A good compromise for a high-performance, general-purpose catalyst would be a molar ratio of approximately **Ni/Ce â‰ˆ 0.25**, as this composition provides strong activity for WGS while maintaining the high Ni dispersion and strong metal-support interaction beneficial for water splitting.
