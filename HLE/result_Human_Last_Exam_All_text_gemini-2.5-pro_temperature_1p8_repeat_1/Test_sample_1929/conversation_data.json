    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the type of reaction.**\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene.** Its chemical formula is C₄H₆, and its structure is CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. It is a conjugated diene. A diene is a hydrocarbon that contains two carbon-carbon double bonds. In a conjugated diene, the double bonds are separated by one single bond. Butadiene is the \"4\" component in a [4+2] cycloaddition, providing four pi (π) electrons.\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.** Its chemical formula is C₂Cl₂F₂, and its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. It is a substituted alkene and will act as the \"dienophile\" (diene-loving) component in the reaction. The dienophile is the \"2\" component in a [4+2] cycloaddition, providing two pi (π) electrons.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a type of [4+2] cycloaddition, which is a pericyclic reaction that forms a six-membered ring in a single, concerted step.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the product.**\nIn a Diels-Alder reaction, three π-bonds are broken (two in the diene, one in the dienophile), and two new sigma (σ) bonds and one new π-bond are formed.\n1.  Let's number the carbons of the reactants to track the bond formation:\n    *   Butadiene: CH₂(1)=CH(2)-CH(3)=CH₂(4)\n    *   1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene: C(5)F₂=C(6)Cl₂\n2.  The two new σ-bonds form between the ends of the diene and the carbons of the dienophile's double bond. Specifically, a bond forms between C1 and C5, and another bond forms between C4 and C6. (Note: Because the diene is symmetrical, it doesn't matter if C1 bonds to C5 and C4 to C6, or if C1 bonds to C6 and C4 to C5; the resulting molecule is identical).\n3.  The π-bond between C1 and C2 of the diene disappears.\n4.  The π-bond between C3 and C4 of the diene disappears.\n5.  A new π-bond forms between C2 and C3 of the diene.\n6.  The π-bond between C5 and C6 of the dienophile becomes a σ-bond.\n7.  The final result is a six-membered ring with the atom connectivity: -C1-C2=C3-C4-C6-C5-.\n\n**Step 3: Draw the structure of the product.**\nBased on the connectivity established in Step 2, we can draw the product. It will be a substituted cyclohexene ring.\n*   The ring will have a double bond between the carbons that were C2 and C3 of butadiene.\n*   The carbons from the dienophile (C5 and C6) will be adjacent to each other in the new ring.\n*   C5 will bear two fluorine atoms (-CF₂).\n*   C6 will bear two chlorine atoms (-CCl₂).\nThe resulting structure is a cyclohexene ring with a -CF₂- group adjacent to a -CCl₂- group.\n\n        CH=CH\n       /     \\\n     CH₂     CH₂\n      |       |\n     CF₂ --- CCl₂\n\n**Step 4: Name the product using IUPAC nomenclature.**\n1.  The parent ring is **cyclohexene**.\n2.  The double bond must be given the lowest possible locants, so its carbons are numbered 1 and 2.\n3.  We then number the rest of the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible set of locants. Let's trace the numbering from our structure formed in Step 2 (-C1(CH₂)-C2(CH)=C3(CH)-C4(CH₂)-C6(CCl₂)-C5(CF₂)-).\n    *   Let the C=C bond (from C2 and C3) be positions 1 and 2. Let's assign C2 as IUPAC position 1 and C3 as IUPAC position 2.\n    *   Following the ring, C4 becomes position 3, C6 becomes position 4, C5 becomes position 5, and C1 becomes position 6.\n    *   The substituents are on C6 (now position 4) and C5 (now position 5). The locant set is {4,4,5,5}.\n4.  If we numbered the double bond in the opposite direction (C3 as position 1, C2 as position 2), the substituents would still be at positions 4 and 5, resulting in the same locant set {4,4,5,5}.\n5.  Since the locant set is the same regardless of numbering direction, we use alphabetical order to decide which substituent gets the lower number. \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\". Therefore, the CCl₂ group should be on the carbon with the lower number.\n6.  In our first numbering scheme (C2→1, C3→2), the CCl₂ group is at position 4 and the CF₂ group is at position 5. This assigns the lower number (4) to the alphabetically prior group (chloro).\n7.  Combining these parts, the IUPAC name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**. The \"-1-\" is often omitted when no ambiguity exists, so **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene** is also correct.\n\nThe product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
