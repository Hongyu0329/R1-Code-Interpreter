    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n**1. Understanding the problem and definitions**\n\nThe concept of a \"generalized Markov number\" \\(m_{p/q}\\) for a rational number \\(p/q\\) extends the classical theory of Markov numbers. In the classical theory, each Markov number \\(m\\) is associated with a class of equivalent quadratic irrationals. The continued fractions of these quadratic irrationals have a specific periodic structure. The generalization follows a similar pattern: a rational number \\(p/q\\) determines a periodic continued fraction, which in turn defines the generalized Markov number. The question asks for this associated continued fraction.\n\nThe most common construction in the literature, which is consistent with the classical cases, proceeds as follows:\n1.  Find the regular continued fraction of the rational number \\(p/q\\). Let the sequence of partial quotients be \\(w = (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n)\\), so that \\(p/q = [0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]\\).\n2.  Find the reverse of this sequence, \\(w^R = (a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_1)\\).\n3.  The period of the associated continued fraction is given by the concatenation of \\(w\\) and \\(w^R\\). That is, the period is \\((a_1, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_1)\\).\n4.  The associated continued fraction is then \\([0; \\overline{a_1, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_1}]\\).\n\nThe generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) itself is calculated using matrix representations of these sequences, specifically \\(m_{p/q} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{tr}(M(w)M(w^R))\\), where \\(M(a_i) = \\begin{pmatrix} a_i & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\), \\(M(w) = M(a_1)M(a_2)\\dots M(a_n)\\), and \\(M(w^R) = M(a_n)\\dots M(a_1)\\). The matrix \\(M(w)M(w^R)\\) is precisely the matrix corresponding to one period of the associated continued fraction, making this a self-consistent approach.\n\n**2. Step-by-step computation for \\(m_{4/7}\\)**\n\n**Step 1: Find the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\).**\nWe apply the Euclidean algorithm to find the partial quotients.\n-   Start with the number itself: \\(x_0 = 4/7\\). The integer part is \\(a_0 = \\lfloor 4/7 \\rfloor = 0\\).\n-   The remainder is \\(4/7\\). We take its reciprocal: \\(x_1 = 1/(4/7) = 7/4\\).\n-   The first partial quotient is \\(a_1 = \\lfloor 7/4 \\rfloor = 1\\).\n-   The remainder is \\(7/4 - 1 = 3/4\\). We take its reciprocal: \\(x_2 = 1/(3/4) = 4/3\\).\n-   The second partial quotient is \\(a_2 = \\lfloor 4/3 \\rfloor = 1\\).\n-   The remainder is \\(4/3 - 1 = 1/3\\). We take its reciprocal: \\(x_3 = 1/(1/3) = 3\\).\n-   The third partial quotient is \\(a_3 = \\lfloor 3 \\rfloor = 3\\).\n-   The remainder is \\(3 - 3 = 0\\), so the algorithm terminates.\n\nThe continued fraction of \\(4/7\\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\).\nThe sequence of partial quotients is \\(w = (1, 1, 3)\\).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the period of the associated continued fraction.**\n-   The sequence \\(w\\) is \\((1, 1, 3)\\).\n-   The reverse sequence \\(w^R\\) is \\((3, 1, 1)\\).\n-   The period is the concatenation of \\(w\\) and \\(w^R\\), which is \\((1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1)\\).\n\n**Careful point:** We need to be sure about the construction of the period. An alternative construction often found in the literature is a palindromic period of the form \\((a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}, a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_1)\\). However, the \\(w w^R\\) construction correctly reproduces the known continued fractions for classical Markov numbers (e.g., for \\(m=5\\), the related rational \\(1/3\\) can be written as \\([0;2,1]\\) in a different CF system, leading to \\(w=(2,1)\\) and the period \\(ww^R = (2,1,1,2)\\), which is correct for \\(m=5\\)). We will follow the \\(w w^R\\) construction.\n\n**Step 3: Write down the final continued fraction.**\nThe associated continued fraction is purely periodic, starting from \\(a_0=0\\). The period is the sequence we found in Step 2.\nSo, the continued fraction is \\([0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]\\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is constructed from the partial quotients of \\(4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]\\). The period is formed by concatenating this sequence \\((1,1,3)\\) with its reverse \\((3,1,1)\\), giving the period \\((1,1,3,3,1,1)\\). The final answer is the continued fraction with this period.\n\n>>> [0; 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1]"
