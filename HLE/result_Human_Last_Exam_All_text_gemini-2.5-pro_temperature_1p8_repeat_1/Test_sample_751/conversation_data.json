    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form and find the new matrix C.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the System and the Goal\nWe are given a discrete-time system:\nx(k+1) = A * x(k)\ny(k) = C * x(k)\n\nwith matrices:\nA = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]\nC = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe goal is to find a similarity transformation x = T * z, such that the new system (A_o, C_o) is in observer canonical form, and determine the new output matrix C_o.\nA_o = T^-1 * A * T\nC_o = C * T\n\nThe problem specifies using duality. The principle of duality states that the observer canonical form of a system (A, C) is the transpose of the controller canonical form of its dual system (A^T, C^T). This means we can find the observer form by either:\na) Transforming the dual system (A^T, C^T) to controller canonical form and then transposing the resulting matrices.\nb) Directly constructing the observer canonical form for (A, C), which is mathematically equivalent. We will use the direct construction method as it's more straightforward for finding C_o.\n\n### Step 2: Check Observability and Determine Observability Indices\nFirst, we need to ensure the system is observable. We construct the observability matrix O:\nO = [C; C*A; C*A^2; ...]\n\nLet the two rows of C be `c1^T` and `c2^T`:\nc1^T = [0, 1, 0]\nc2^T = [1, 1, 0]\n\nWe search for n=3 linearly independent rows from the sequence {c1^T, c2^T, c1^T*A, c2^T*A, ...}:\n1.  **Row 1**: `c1^T` = [0, 1, 0]\n2.  **Row 2**: `c2^T` = [1, 1, 0]. This is linearly independent of Row 1.\n3.  **Row 3**: `c1^T * A` = [0, 1, 0] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [2, 1, 1].\n\nLet's check if these three rows are linearly independent by forming a matrix and calculating its determinant:\ndet([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1]]) = 0 * (1-0) - 1 * (1-0) + 0 = -1\nSince the determinant is non-zero, the three rows are linearly independent, and the rank of the observability matrix is 3. The system is observable.\n\nFrom our selection process:\n- We took 2 rows associated with `c1` (`c1^T` and `c1^T*A`). The first observability index is **ν1 = 2**.\n- We took 1 row associated with `c2` (`c2^T`). The second observability index is **ν2 = 1**.\nThe sum of indices ν1 + ν2 = 2 + 1 = 3, which matches the state dimension `n`.\n\n### Step 3: Construct the Transformation Matrix\nThe observer canonical form is obtained by defining a new state vector `z` whose components are the outputs and their future values. Based on the observability indices (ν1=2, ν2=1), a standard choice for the new states is:\nz1(k) = y1(k) = c1^T * x(k)\nz2(k) = y1(k+1) = c1^T * x(k+1) = c1^T * A * x(k)\nz3(k) = y2(k) = c2^T * x(k)\n\nThis defines the transformation `z = Q * x`, where Q is the transformation matrix formed by these rows:\nQ = [c1^T; c1^T*A; c2^T]\nQ = [[0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0]]\n\nThe transformation from the original state `x` to the canonical state `z` is `z = Qx`. Thus, `x = Q^-1 * z`. The original transformation T in the problem description is Q^-1. So `C_o = C * T = C * Q^-1`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the New Output Matrix C_o\nThe new output matrix `C_o` relates the output `y` to the new state `z`. We can find it in two ways:\n\n**Method A: By definition of the new state `z`**\ny(k) = [y1(k); y2(k)]\nFrom our definition of `z`:\ny1(k) = z1(k)\ny2(k) = z3(k)\n\nWe can write this in matrix form:\ny(k) = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]] * [z1(k); z2(k); z3(k)]\nTherefore, the new output matrix `C_o` is:\nC_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]\n\n**Method B: By explicit matrix multiplication `C_o = C * Q^-1`**\nFirst, we need to compute the inverse of Q.\ndet(Q) = 1 (as calculated in Step 2).\nThe adjugate (or adjoint) of Q is the transpose of its cofactor matrix:\nadj(Q) = [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]\nSince det(Q) = 1, `Q^-1 = adj(Q)`.\nQ^-1 = [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]\n\nNow, multiply `C` by `Q^-1`:\nC_o = C * Q^-1 = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[-1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, -2]]\nC_o = [[(0)(-1)+(1)(1)+(0)(1), (0)(0)+(1)(0)+(0)(1), (0)(1)+(1)(0)+(0)(-2)],\n       [(1)(-1)+(1)(1)+(0)(1), (1)(0)+(1)(0)+(0)(1), (1)(1)+(1)(0)+(0)(-2)]]\nC_o = [[1, 0, 0],\n       [0, 0, 1]]\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe value of the new matrix C is:\n```\n[[1, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 1]]\n```\n\n<<<[[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]>>>"
