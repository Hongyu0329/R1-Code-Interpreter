    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the requirements of the synthesis.\n\n1.  **Molecule:** A peptide.\n2.  **Length:** 100 amino acids (aa). This is a significant length for chemical synthesis, often considered a small protein.\n3.  **Composition:** Contains standard amino acids and one specific **unnatural amino acid (UAA)**, azido phenylalanine (X).\n4.  **Goal:** Identify the *most helpful technique* for its synthesis. This requires comparing different available methods.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate potential synthesis techniques based on the requirements.\n\nLet's consider the main techniques for producing peptides and proteins.\n\n#### Technique 1: Recombinant DNA Technology (in vivo biosynthesis)\n\n*   **How it works:** A gene encoding the peptide is inserted into a host organism (e.g., *E. coli*). The cell's machinery (ribosomes) then synthesizes the peptide.\n*   **Pros:** Excellent for producing large quantities of long proteins (>50 aa) composed of the 20 canonical amino acids.\n*   **Cons & Careful Points:**\n    *   **Unnatural Amino Acid Incorporation:** Standard recombinant methods cannot incorporate UAAs. The genetic code only specifies the 20 standard amino acids.\n    *   **Specialized Methods:** To incorporate a UAA like azido phenylalanine, a highly complex method called **amber codon suppression** is required. This involves engineering a unique tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair and a special stop codon in the gene. This is a sophisticated bioengineering project, not a routine synthesis, and often suffers from low efficiency and yield. Therefore, it is generally not considered the \"most helpful\" or straightforward method for a one-off synthesis.\n\n#### Technique 2: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)\n\n*   **How it works:** The peptide is built step-by-step, one amino acid at a time, while anchored to a solid resin support. The UAA can be added just like any other amino acid, provided a chemically protected version (e.g., Fmoc-L-azidophenylalanine-OH) is available.\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   **Excellent for UAA incorporation:** This is the primary advantage. SPPS is highly versatile and can incorporate hundreds of different UAAs and other modifications.\n    *   **Automation:** The process can be fully automated.\n*   **Cons & Careful Points:**\n    *   **Length Limitation:** The efficiency of each amino acid coupling step is not 100% (typically 99-99.8%). Over a long synthesis, this small inefficiency accumulates. For a 100 aa peptide (99 coupling steps), even a high 99% step-wise yield results in a very low overall theoretical yield of the full-length product (0.99⁹⁹ ≈ 37%).\n    *   **Aggregation:** As the peptide chain grows longer on the resin, it can fold and aggregate, preventing reagents from accessing the reactive end. This leads to failed or truncated sequences, making purification of the final 100 aa product extremely difficult.\n    *   **Conclusion:** While SPPS is essential for including the UAA, synthesizing a 100 aa peptide directly in one continuous run is very challenging and often impractical.\n\n#### Technique 3: Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)\n\n*   **How it works:** NCL is a chemical method to join two smaller, unprotected peptide fragments. One fragment must have an N-terminal Cysteine, and the other must be activated as a C-terminal thioester. They react selectively in solution to form a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n*   **Pros:**\n    *   **Circumvents SPPS length limits:** It allows for the synthesis of very large peptides and small proteins by breaking the problem down. Instead of one difficult 100-aa SPPS run, you can perform two easier ~50-aa SPPS runs.\n    *   **Full compatibility with UAAs:** The smaller fragments are made by SPPS, so the UAA (azido phenylalanine) can be easily incorporated into one of them.\n    *   **High Yield of Ligation:** The ligation reaction itself is typically very clean and high-yielding.\n*   **Cons & Careful Points:**\n    *   **Cysteine Requirement:** The standard method requires a cysteine at the ligation junction. However, modern variations of NCL have expanded the possible ligation sites.\n    *   **Fragment Preparation:** Requires the synthesis of a peptide-thioester, which adds a small layer of complexity compared to standard SPPS cleavage.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the techniques and determine the best fit.\n\n*   **Recombinant synthesis** is ill-suited due to the UAA.\n*   **Direct SPPS** is ill-suited due to the 100-aa length.\n*   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** is the ideal solution because it combines the strengths of other methods while mitigating their weaknesses.\n\n**The proposed strategy using NCL would be:**\n\n1.  Divide the 100 aa peptide sequence into two fragments at a suitable point (e.g., residues 1-50 and 51-100). The ideal location would have a natural Cysteine at the start of the second fragment (e.g., at position 51).\n2.  Synthesize the two fragments separately using automated **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**. The fragment containing the position for 'X' will have azido phenylalanine incorporated during its synthesis.\n3.  The first fragment (1-50) is prepared as a C-terminal thioester. The second fragment (51-100) is prepared with its N-terminal Cysteine.\n4.  The two purified fragments are then joined together in solution using **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** to form the final, full-length 100 aa peptide.\n\nThis combined **SPPS + NCL** approach is the most powerful and practical method for creating a long peptide containing an unnatural amino acid. Therefore, NCL is the key enabling technique.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
