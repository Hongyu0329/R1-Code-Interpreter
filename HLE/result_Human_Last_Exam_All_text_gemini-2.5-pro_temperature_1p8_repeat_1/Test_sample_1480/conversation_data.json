    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**:\n    *   **Goal**: Find the \"rule activation level\".\n    *   **Fuzzy System Type**: Interval Type-3 (IT3) Fuzzy Set. While this sounds complex, the problem simplifies the inputs to crisp numbers, meaning we should focus on the fundamental operation rather than the intricate details of IT3 sets.\n    *   **Given Input 1**: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`. This represents the firing strength (also called the firing level or degree of fulfillment) of the antecedent part of the k-th rule. This is the result of evaluating the \"IF...\" part of the rule. Let's denote this as `f`.\n    *   **Given Input 2**: `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This represents the membership degree of a specific output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j`. This is the value from the \"THEN...\" part of the rule, before it is modified by the antecedent's firing strength. Let's denote this as `μ_G`.\n    *   **Operation**: A t-norm operation. This is specified for the implication step, which combines the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's membership function.\n\n2.  **Understand the Fuzzy Inference Process**:\n    *   A fuzzy rule has the form: `IF (antecedent is true) THEN (consequent is true)`.\n    *   The degree to which the antecedent is true is its firing strength, `f = 0.7`.\n    *   The implication step determines the output fuzzy set for that rule. A common method (Mamdani implication) states that the output of the rule cannot have a higher degree of membership than the firing strength of its antecedent.\n    *   This \"capping\" or \"clipping\" of the consequent fuzzy set is achieved using a t-norm operation. The membership of any value `y` in the *activated* consequent set is `t-norm(f, μ_G(y))`.\n\n3.  **Select the Appropriate t-norm**:\n    *   A t-norm is a function that models a fuzzy logical 'AND'. There are several types of t-norms.\n    *   The most fundamental and widely used t-norm in this context is the **minimum t-norm**: `t(a, b) = min(a, b)`.\n    *   Another common one is the **product t-norm**: `t(a, b) = a * b`.\n    *   Unless specified otherwise, the minimum t-norm is the standard choice for Mamdani-style inference. The problem asks for \"the\" rule activation level, and the `min` operator is the cornerstone of this process. It represents the idea that the strength of a conclusion is limited by the strength of its premise.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**:\n    *   We need to calculate the resulting activation level by combining the antecedent firing strength with the consequent membership degree using the selected t-norm.\n    *   **Antecedent Firing Strength (`f`)**: 0.7\n    *   **Consequent Membership (`μ_G`)**: 0.9\n    *   **Operation**: `min(f, μ_G)`\n    *   **Calculation**: `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ambiguity of \"Rule Activation Level\"**: This term can sometimes mean only the antecedent firing strength (`0.7`). However, the question provides a consequent membership value (`0.9`) and explicitly asks to use a \"t-norm operation\" to combine them. This indicates the question is asking for the result of the implication step for a specific output value, not just the antecedent firing strength.\n2.  **Irrelevance of the \"Interval Type-3\" Detail**: The problem is intentionally simplified. A full IT3 calculation would involve operations on complex sets (IT2 firing sets and IT3 consequent sets). By providing single crisp values (`0.7`, `0.9`), the problem tests the understanding of the core fuzzy implication principle, which is consistent across Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3 systems.\n3.  **Choice of t-norm**: The minimum t-norm (`min`) is the most standard interpretation for this operation in fuzzy inference systems. Using the product t-norm would yield `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`, but the minimum operator better reflects the logical constraint that the conclusion cannot be more certain than the premise.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe rule's premise is met with a degree of 0.7. The rule's original conclusion proposes a membership of 0.9 for the output value `y_j`. The fuzzy implication principle, using a standard `min` t-norm, dictates that the final membership of the output cannot exceed the degree to which the premise was met. Therefore, the resulting activation level is capped at the antecedent's firing strength.\n\n**Calculation:**\nResult = t-norm(Antecedent Firing Level, Consequent Membership)\nResult = min(0.7, 0.9)\nResult = 0.7\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
