To the leading order in $\epsilon = 4-d$, the specific heat critical exponent $\alpha$ scales linearly with the deviation of the spatial dimensionality $d$ from the upper critical dimension of 4. The quantitative relationship for a single-component scalar field theory is given by the formula: $\alpha = \frac{1}{6}(4-d)$.
