    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Algorithm\nThe algorithm can be broken down into three main parts:\n1.  **Initialization (Step 1):** A fixed set of operations performed once at the beginning.\n2.  **Main Loop (Step 2):** A `while` loop that iterates until a condition is met. This is usually the dominant part of the algorithm.\n3.  **Return (Step 3):** Returning the final result.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Part\n#### 1. Analysis of Initialization\n`1. i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n\n*   `i := 0`: One assignment operation.\n*   `x := n`: One assignment operation.\n*   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: One integer division operation.\n*   `a_{0} := x - q*c`: One multiplication and one subtraction.\n\nThis step consists of a small, constant number of basic operations. Assuming these basic arithmetic and assignment operations take constant time, the complexity of this step is **O(1)**.\n\n#### 2. Analysis of the Main Loop\n`2. while q > 0, do`\n`2.1. i := i + 1; x := q; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`\n\nTo find the complexity of the loop, we need to determine two things:\na) The cost of a single iteration of the loop body.\nb) The total number of iterations.\n\n**a) Cost of a Single Iteration:**\nThe body of the loop (`2.1`) consists of:\n*   `i := i + 1`: One increment (addition).\n*   `x := q`: One assignment.\n*   `q := ⌊x/c⌋`: One integer division.\n*   `a_{i} := x - q*c`: One multiplication and one subtraction.\n\nSimilar to the initialization step, a single iteration involves a fixed number of basic operations. Therefore, the cost of one iteration is constant, i.e., **O(1)**.\n\n**b) Number of Iterations:**\nThe loop continues as long as `q > 0`. We need to track how the value of `q` changes.\n*   Before the loop starts, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n*   In each iteration, the new `q` becomes the old `q` divided by `c`. Let's trace the value of `q` more formally. Let `q_k` be the value of `q` after the `k`-th iteration of the loop.\n    *   Before loop: `q_{initial} = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   After 1st iteration (`k=1`): `x` takes the value `q_{initial}`, so `q_1 = ⌊q_{initial}/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    *   After 2nd iteration (`k=2`): `q_2 = ⌊q_1/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c³⌋`.\n    *   After `k` iterations: The value of `q` is `q_k = ⌊n/c^{k+1}⌋`.\n\nThe loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/c^{k+1}⌋ = 0`.\nThis condition is met when `n/c^{k+1} < 1`, which can be rewritten as `n < c^{k+1}`.\n\nTo find the number of iterations `k`, we can solve for `k`:\n`log_c(n) < k+1`\n`k > log_c(n) - 1`\n\nSince `k` must be an integer, the number of iterations is `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋`. The number of times the loop executes is therefore on the order of `log_c(n)`. So, the number of iterations is **O(log_c n)**.\n\n**Total Loop Complexity:**\nThe total complexity of the loop is (Number of Iterations) × (Cost per Iteration).\nComplexity = O(log_c n) × O(1) = **O(log_c n)**.\n\n#### 3. Analysis of the Return Statement\n`3. return ((a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1}  a_{0}))$`\n\nThis step involves assembling the computed digits into a final representation. The number of digits is `i+1`. Since `i` is incremented in each of the `k` loop iterations, the final value of `i` is `k = ⌊log_c n⌋`. The total number of digits is `k+1`, which is `O(log_c n)`. The cost of returning is at most proportional to the number of digits, so its complexity is **O(log_c n)**.\n\n### Step 3: Combine Results for Overall Complexity\nThe total computational time complexity is the sum of the complexities of its parts:\nTotal Complexity = (Complexity of Initialization) + (Complexity of Loop) + (Complexity of Return)\nTotal Complexity = O(1) + O(log_c n) + O(log_c n)\nTotal Complexity = **O(log_c n)**\n\n### Step 4: Final Simplification and Careful Points\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Cost Model Assumption:** This analysis assumes the **uniform cost model**, where basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on integers are considered to take constant time, O(1). This is a standard assumption for algorithm analysis when the numbers involved fit within a computer's word size.\n2.  **Role of Input 'n':** The complexity is dependent on the magnitude of the input integer `n`. As `n` grows, the number of operations grows logarithmically.\n3.  **Role of Input 'c':** The base `c` affects the actual number of iterations, but in Big-O notation, the base of a logarithm is treated as a constant factor. This is because of the change of base formula: `log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`. Since `c ≥ 2`, `log_b(c)` is a constant, so `O(log_c n)` is equivalent to `O(log n)` for any standard base `b`.\n4.  **Intuition:** The algorithm's running time is proportional to the number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n`. The number of digits required to represent a number `n` in base `c` is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`, which is `O(log n)`.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\nThe final computational time complexity is O(log_c n). By convention, we drop the base of the logarithm in Big-O notation.\n\nFinal Complexity = **O(log n)**.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
