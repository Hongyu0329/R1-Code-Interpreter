    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the given curve.\n\n**1. The Curve and its Genus**\n\nThe curve is given by the equation:\n$C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThe degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is $d=5$. The genus $g$ of a hyperelliptic curve is given by $g = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor$.\nFor our curve, $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n\n**2. Stable Reduction and Branch Points**\n\nThe stable reduction of a curve over a local field (in our case, $\\mathbb{Q}$ over the prime $p=2$, so we work in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$) is a stable curve over the residue field ($\\mathbb{F}_2$) that is birationally equivalent to the original curve. A stable curve is a connected, reduced curve whose only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\n\nThe structure of the stable reduction for a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the differences of its branch points. The branch points of $y^2=f(x)$ are the roots of $f(x)=0$ and the point at infinity if the degree of $f(x)$ is odd. Here, $\\deg(f)=5$, so the point at infinity is indeed a branch point. We have a total of $2g+2 = 6$ branch points.\n\n**3. Finding the 2-adic Valuations of the Branch Points**\n\nFirst, we find the roots of $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8) = 0$.\nOne root is clearly $r_1 = 0$. Its 2-adic valuation $v_2(r_1)$ is infinite.\nThe other four roots are the roots of the polynomial $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$.\nTo find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $g(x)$, we use the Newton polygon method with respect to the prime $p=2$.\nThe points of the Newton polygon are $(i, v_2(c_i))$, where $c_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$.\nThe coefficients of $g(x)$ are $c_0=8, c_1=1, c_2=4, c_3=4, c_4=8$.\nThe corresponding valuations are $v_2(c_0)=3, v_2(c_1)=0, v_2(c_2)=2, v_2(c_3)=2, v_2(c_4)=3$.\nThe points for the polygon are: $P_0(0,3), P_1(1,0), P_2(2,2), P_3(3,2), P_4(4,3)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points gives the slopes, whose negatives are the valuations of the roots.\n1.  The first segment connects $P_0(0,3)$ and $P_1(1,0)$. The slope is $(0-3)/(1-0) = -3$. The horizontal length of this segment is 1. This corresponds to one root, let's call it $r_2$, with valuation $v_2(r_2) = -(-3) = 3$.\n2.  The next segment starts at $P_1(1,0)$. We find the point $P_k$ that minimizes the slope from $P_1$. The slope from $P_1(1,0)$ to $P_3(3,2)$ is $(2-0)/(3-1) = 1$. The slope from $P_1$ to $P_4(4,3)$ is also $(3-0)/(4-1) = 1$. The point $P_2(2,2)$ lies above the line connecting $P_1$ and $P_3$. The point $P_3(3,2)$ lies on the line segment connecting $P_1(1,0)$ and $P_4(4,3)$. Thus, the second segment of the Newton polygon connects $P_1(1,0)$ to $P_4(4,3)$.\n    The slope of this segment is 1. The horizontal length is $4-1=3$. This corresponds to three roots, $r_3, r_4, r_5$, each with valuation $v_2(r_i) = -(1) = -1$.\n\nSo, the valuations of the five affine branch points are: $v_2(r_1)=\\infty$, $v_2(r_2)=3$, and $v_2(r_3)=v_2(r_4)=v_2(r_5)=-1$. The sixth branch point is $r_6 = \\infty$.\n\n**4. Clustering of Branch Points**\n\nThe components of the stable reduction correspond to clusters of branch points. Two branch points, $r_i$ and $r_j$, belong to the same cluster if their 2-adic \"distance,\" $v_2(r_i - r_j)$, is positive. For the point at infinity, the distance is defined as $v_2(r_i - \\infty) = -v_2(r_i)$.\n\nLet's check the pairwise distances:\n*   $v_2(r_1-r_2) = v_2(0-r_2) = v_2(r_2) = 3 > 0$. So, $r_1$ and $r_2$ are in the same cluster. Let's call it $I_1 = \\{0, r_2\\}$.\n*   $v_2(r_i - \\infty) = -v_2(r_i) = -(-1) = 1 > 0$ for $i \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$. So $r_3, r_4, r_5$ and $\\infty$ might be in the same cluster.\n*   To confirm this, we must check if $r_3,r_4,r_5$ cluster together. $v_2(r_i-r_j)$ for $i,j \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$. We analyze the residual polynomial associated with the second segment of the Newton polygon. Its roots correspond to the leading terms of the roots $r_{3,4,5}$. The analysis shows this polynomial is $t^3+t^2+1$, which is irreducible over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ and thus has distinct roots. This implies that for $i \\ne j$, the roots $r_i$ and $r_j$ are distinct modulo a higher power of 2, and we find $v_2(r_i-r_j) = -1$. Since this is not positive, $r_3, r_4, r_5$ do not cluster together.\n*   Let's check other pairwise distances. For any $i \\in \\{3,4,5\\}$:\n    *   $v_2(r_1-r_i) = v_2(-r_i) = v_2(r_i) = -1 \\le 0$.\n    *   $v_2(r_2-r_i) = \\min(v_2(r_2), v_2(r_i)) = \\min(3, -1) = -1 \\le 0$.\n\nBased on this, the partition of the branch points into clusters is:\n*   $I_1 = \\{0, r_2\\}$\n*   $I_2 = \\{r_3, \\infty\\}$\n*   $I_3 = \\{r_4, \\infty\\}$\n*   $I_4 = \\{r_5, \\infty\\}$\n\nSo, the special fiber of the stable model has $N=4$ components.\n\n**5. Genus of the Components and Number of Double Points**\n\nEach component $C_i$ corresponding to a cluster $I_i$ is a hyperelliptic curve whose genus $g_i$ is given by $g_i = \\lfloor(\\#I_i - 1)/2\\rfloor$.\n*   For $I_1 = \\{0, r_2\\}$, $\\#I_1 = 2$, so $g_1 = \\lfloor(2-1)/2\\rfloor = 0$.\n*   For $I_2 = \\{r_3, \\infty\\}$, $\\#I_2 = 2$, so $g_2 = \\lfloor(2-1)/2\\rfloor = 0$.\n*   For $I_3 = \\{r_4, \\infty\\}$, $\\#I_3 = 2$, so $g_3 = \\lfloor(2-1)/2\\rfloor = 0$.\n*   For $I_4 = \\{r_5, \\infty\\}$, $\\#I_4 = 2$, so $g_4 = \\lfloor(2-1)/2\\rfloor = 0$.\n\nAll components are rational curves ($\\mathbb{P}^1$). The sum of their genera is $\\sum g_i = 0$.\n\nThe number of double points (nodes), $\\delta$, in the stable reduction is given by the formula relating the genus of the original curve $g$ to the arithmetic genus of its stable reduction:\n$g = \\delta - N + 1 + \\sum g_i$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$2 = \\delta - 4 + 1 + 0$\n$2 = \\delta - 3$\n$\\delta = 5$\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the curve has 5 double points."
