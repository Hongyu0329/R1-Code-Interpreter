The two languages are Tagalog (from the Philippines) and Hebrew (from Israel).
1.  **Mom:** The Hebrew word is `Ima`. The Tagalog word is also `Ima`.
2.  **Dad:** The Hebrew word is `Abba`. The formal Tagalog word for father is `Ama`.
3.  **Broom:** The Hebrew word is `matateh`. This is phonetically similar to the Tagalog phrase `mag-tae tae`, which means "to clean up dirt."
