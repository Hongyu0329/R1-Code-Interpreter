Given its role in promoting the survival, persistence, and formation of memory T cell phenotypes, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured in the presence of interleukin-15 would exhibit an increased release of effector cytokines (such as Interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha) upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it. This enhanced cytokine release reflects a more potent and less exhausted functional state of the cells.
