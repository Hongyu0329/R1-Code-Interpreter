    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Diagram's Topology\n\nThe question describes a Feynman diagram with the following characteristics:\n*   **Two vertices:** Let's label them V1 and V2.\n*   **Four field contractions:** In a Feynman diagram, a field contraction is represented by a line (propagator). Since there are only two vertices in the diagram, these four contractions must be lines that connect V1 and V2.\n\nThis describes a diagram where two points are connected by four separate lines. This is a two-loop vacuum bubble diagram.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Symmetry Factor\n\nThe symmetry factor, S, is a combinatorial factor that arises in perturbative calculations. It represents the number of ways that the fields in the interaction Lagrangian can be contracted (according to Wick's theorem) to produce the same topological diagram. To avoid overcounting, the value of the diagram calculated using standard Feynman rules is divided by its symmetry factor S.\n\nThe value of S is the order of the automorphism group of the graph, which means we count the number of permutations of its internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram unchanged.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Sources of Symmetry in the Diagram\n\nWe need to identify all operations that leave the diagram topologically unchanged. For this diagram, there are two sources of symmetry.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Permutation of Identical Lines**\n    The four lines connecting V1 and V2 are identical. They represent four propagators of the same field. We can swap these four lines among themselves in any order, and the diagram will look exactly the same. The number of ways to permute four distinct items is 4! (4-factorial).\n    *   Symmetry from lines = 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Permutation of Identical Vertices**\n    The two vertices, V1 and V2, are also identical. This is because there are no external lines or other features attached to them that would make them distinguishable. If we swap the positions of V1 and V2, the diagram remains unchanged—it is still two vertices connected by four lines. The number of ways to permute two identical items is 2! (2-factorial).\n    *   Symmetry from vertices = 2! = 2 × 1 = 2.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor\n\nThe total symmetry factor S is the product of the factors from all independent symmetry operations.\n\n*   S = (Symmetry from line permutation) × (Symmetry from vertex permutation)\n*   S = 4! × 2!\n*   S = 24 × 2\n*   S = 48\n\n### Final Conclusion with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Diagram Structure:** The problem defines a diagram with 2 vertices connected by 4 internal lines.\n2.  **Line Symmetry:** The 4 internal lines are identical and can be permuted, giving a factor of 4! = 24.\n3.  **Vertex Symmetry:** The 2 vertices are equivalent (assuming a vacuum diagram with no external legs to distinguish them) and can be swapped, giving a factor of 2! = 2.\n4.  **Total Symmetry:** The total symmetry factor is the product of the individual symmetry factors. Thus, S = 24 * 2 = 48.\n\nThe symmetry factor associated with this Feynman diagram is 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
