    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the polynomial**\n\nThe polynomial is given by $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\nThis polynomial appears to be from a special family. Let's analyze its structure. The powers of $x$ are all odd. Let's separate the constant term.\nLet $g(x) = f(x) - 22 = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$.\n\nThis polynomial $g(x)$ is a known polynomial. It is the 7th Dickson polynomial of the first kind, denoted $D_7(x, a)$, with parameter $a=2$.\nDickson polynomials are defined by the functional equation $D_n(y+a/y, a) = y^n + (a/y)^n$.\nThe recurrence relation for these polynomials is $D_n(x, a) = x D_{n-1}(x, a) - a D_{n-2}(x, a)$, with initial conditions $D_0(x, a) = 2$ and $D_1(x, a) = x$.\nLet's compute the first few Dickson polynomials with $a=2$:\n$D_0(x, 2) = 2$\n$D_1(x, 2) = x$\n$D_2(x, 2) = x \\cdot x - 2 \\cdot 2 = x^2 - 4$\n$D_3(x, 2) = x(x^2 - 4) - 2x = x^3 - 6x$\n$D_4(x, 2) = x(x^3 - 6x) - 2(x^2 - 4) = x^4 - 8x^2 + 8$\n$D_5(x, 2) = x(x^4 - 8x^2 + 8) - 2(x^3 - 6x) = x^5 - 10x^3 + 20x$\n$D_6(x, 2) = x(x^5 - 10x^3 + 20x) - 2(x^4 - 8x^2 + 8) = x^6 - 12x^4 + 36x^2 - 16$\n$D_7(x, 2) = x(x^6 - 12x^4 + 36x^2 - 16) - 2(x^5 - 10x^3 + 20x) = x^7 - 12x^5 + 36x^3 - 16x - 2x^5 + 20x^3 - 40x = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$.\nThis confirms that $g(x) = D_7(x, 2)$.\nSo, the given polynomial is $f(x) = D_7(x, 2) + 22$. The roots of $f(x)$ are the solutions to the equation $D_7(x, 2) = -22$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of the polynomial**\n\nThe question asks for the density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$. According to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this density is given by the proportion of elements in the Galois group of $f(x)$ that act as a single cycle on the roots of $f(x)$. Since the degree of $f(x)$ is 7, we need to count the 7-cycles in its Galois group.\nFirst, we must determine the Galois group, $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nThere is a standard theorem on the Galois group of polynomials of the form $D_n(x, a) - b$.\n**Theorem:** Over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group of the polynomial $D_n(x, a) - b$ is isomorphic to the dihedral group $D_n$ of order $2n$, provided that $n \\ge 3$ and $b^2 - 4a^n$ is not a square of a rational number (with a few other exceptions for small $n$ which are not relevant here).\n\nIn our case, the polynomial is $f(x) = D_7(x, 2) + 22$, so the roots satisfy $D_7(x, 2) = -22$. This corresponds to the form $D_n(x, a) - b$ with:\n$n=7$, $a=2$, and $b=-22$.\n\nNow, we check the condition from the theorem:\n$b^2 - 4a^n = (-22)^2 - 4(2^7) = 484 - 4(128) = 484 - 512 = -28$.\nSince $-28$ is not a square of a rational number, the condition is satisfied.\nTherefore, the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the dihedral group $D_7$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the Galois group $D_7$**\n\nThe dihedral group $D_7$ is the group of symmetries of a regular heptagon. It has order $2 \\times 7 = 14$. The elements of $D_7$ can be categorized by their geometric action on the heptagon:\n1.  **Rotations:** There are 7 rotation elements, generated by a rotation $r$ of $2\\pi/7$ radians. The elements are $e, r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, r^6$, where $e$ is the identity.\n2.  **Reflections:** There are 7 reflection elements.\n\nThe Galois group $G=D_7$ acts on the 7 roots of the polynomial $f(x)$. We are interested in the cycle structure of the elements of $G$ as permutations of these 7 roots.\n*   The identity element $e$ corresponds to the permutation $(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)(1)$.\n*   The 6 non-identity rotation elements ($r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, r^6$) all permute the 7 roots cyclically. They are all 7-cycles. For example, $r$ corresponds to a permutation of the form $(1 2 3 4 5 6 7)$.\n*   The 7 reflection elements each fix one root and swap the other 6 roots in 3 pairs. They correspond to permutations of the form $(1)(2 3)(4 5)(6 7)$. These are of order 2.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem**\n\nA polynomial remains irreducible modulo a prime $p$ if and only if its Galois group, when considered as a permutation group on the roots, has a Frobenius element Frob$_p$ that acts transitively. For a polynomial of prime degree like 7, this means the permutation must be a 7-cycle.\n\nThe Chebotarev Density Theorem states that the natural density of the set of primes $p$ for which Frob$_p$ belongs to a given conjugacy class $C$ is $|C|/|G|$. To find the density of primes for which $f(x)$ is irreducible mod $p$, we need to find the proportion of elements in $G=D_7$ that are 7-cycles.\n\nFrom our analysis in Step 3:\n*   The total number of elements in $G = D_7$ is $|G| = 14$.\n*   The number of elements that are 7-cycles is 6 (the six non-identity rotations).\n\nThe density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group:\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles) / |$D_7$| = $6 / 14 = 3/7$.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\n1.  Identify the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ as $D_7(x, 2) + 22$.\n2.  Determine the Galois group of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. For a polynomial $D_n(x, a) - b$, the Galois group is $D_n$ if $b^2 - 4a^n$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Here $n=7, a=2, b=-22$. The value is $(-22)^2 - 4(2^7) = -28$, which is not a square. So the Galois group is $D_7$.\n3.  The density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is given by the proportion of elements in the Galois group $D_7$ that are 7-cycles.\n4.  The group $D_7$ has 14 elements. Among them, 6 are rotations of order 7, which act as 7-cycles on the roots.\n5.  The required density is $6/14 = 3/7$."
