    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Relevant Mathematical Tools**\n\nWe are asked for the minimum number of critical points a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have. A critical point is a point where the gradient of the function is zero.\n\nThe key tool for relating the number of critical points of a function to the topology of its domain is **Morse Theory**. This theory applies to a special class of functions called Morse functions, but its results provide a lower bound for all smooth functions.\n\n*   **Manifold:** Our domain is the 2-torus ($T^2$), which is a compact, orientable surface without boundary.\n*   **Morse Function:** A smooth function is a Morse function if all its critical points are non-degenerate (meaning the Hessian matrix of second derivatives is non-singular at each critical point).\n*   **Key Idea:** Any smooth function on a compact manifold can be slightly perturbed to become a Morse function. This process of perturbation does not decrease the number of critical points (a degenerate point typically splits into multiple non-degenerate ones). Therefore, the minimum number of critical points for *any* smooth function is at least the minimum number for a Morse function.\n\n**Step 2: Use Morse Inequalities to Establish a Lower Bound**\n\nMorse theory provides a powerful set of relations known as the **Morse inequalities**. For a Morse function $f$ on a compact manifold $M$:\n\n1.  Let $c_k(f)$ be the number of critical points of index $k$. (Index 0 = local minimum, Index 1 = saddle point, Index 2 = local maximum for a surface like the torus).\n2.  Let $b_k(M)$ be the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold $M$, which is the rank of the $k$-th homology group. Betti numbers are fundamental topological invariants.\n\nThe Morse inequalities state that for each $k$:\n$c_k(f) \\ge b_k(M)$\n\nA weaker consequence, which is sufficient for our purpose, is that the total number of critical points must be at least the sum of the Betti numbers:\nTotal Critical Points $= \\sum_{k} c_k(f) \\ge \\sum_{k} b_k(M)$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Betti Numbers for the 2-Torus ($T^2$)**\n\nWe need to determine the topological structure of the torus, quantified by its Betti numbers.\n\n*   **$b_0(T^2)$:** The number of connected components. The torus is one single connected piece, so $b_0(T^2) = 1$. This corresponds to the fact that any continuous function on a compact space must have at least one global minimum, which is a critical point of index 0.\n*   **$b_1(T^2)$:** The number of \"one-dimensional holes\" or independent non-bounding loops. A torus has two fundamental loops: one \"around the hole\" (longitudinal) and one \"through the hole\" (latitudinal). Therefore, $b_1(T^2) = 2$.\n*   **$b_2(T^2)$:** The number of \"two-dimensional voids\". The torus itself is a closed surface that encloses a region, so it has one two-dimensional \"hole\". Therefore, $b_2(T^2) = 1$. This corresponds to the fact that any continuous function on a compact space must have at least one global maximum, which is a critical point of index 2.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Inequalities to find the Minimal Number**\n\nUsing the Betti numbers we just found, we can apply the Morse inequalities:\n*   $c_0 \\ge b_0(T^2) = 1$ (at least one minimum)\n*   $c_1 \\ge b_1(T^2) = 2$ (at least two saddle points)\n*   $c_2 \\ge b_2(T^2) = 1$ (at least one maximum)\n\nThe total number of critical points, $C$, must therefore be at least the sum of these minimums:\n$C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$\n\nThis shows that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have **at least 4** critical points.\n\n**Step 5: Construct an Example to Show the Bound is Achievable**\n\nTo prove that 4 is the minimum, we must show that it is possible to construct a smooth function on the torus with exactly 4 critical points.\n\nLet's represent the torus as the product of two circles, $T^2 = S^1 \\times S^1$, with coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi)$, where $\\theta, \\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. Consider the function:\n$f(\\theta, \\phi) = \\cos(\\theta) + \\cos(\\phi)$\n\nThis is a smooth function on the torus. Let's find its critical points by setting its gradient to zero:\n*   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} = -\\sin(\\theta) = 0 \\implies \\theta = 0$ or $\\theta = \\pi$.\n*   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi} = -\\sin(\\phi) = 0 \\implies \\phi = 0$ or $\\phi = \\pi$.\n\nThis gives us exactly four critical points:\n1.  $(\\theta, \\phi) = (0, 0)$\n2.  $(\\theta, \\phi) = (0, \\pi)$\n3.  $(\\theta, \\phi) = (\\pi, 0)$\n4.  $(\\theta, \\phi) = (\\pi, \\pi)$\n\nNow we classify them using the Hessian matrix of second derivatives:\n$H = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\cos(\\theta) & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos(\\phi) \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n1.  At **(0, 0)**: $H = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is negative definite, so it's a **local maximum** (index 2).\n2.  At **(0, $\\pi$)**: $H = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is indefinite, so it's a **saddle point** (index 1).\n3.  At **($\\pi$, 0)**: $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is indefinite, so it's a **saddle point** (index 1).\n4.  At **($\\pi$, $\\pi$)**: $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is positive definite, so it's a **local minimum** (index 0).\n\nThis function has one maximum, two saddles, and one minimum, for a total of 4 critical points.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown through Morse theory that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least 4 critical points. We have also constructed a specific function that achieves this minimum. Therefore, the minimal number of critical points is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
