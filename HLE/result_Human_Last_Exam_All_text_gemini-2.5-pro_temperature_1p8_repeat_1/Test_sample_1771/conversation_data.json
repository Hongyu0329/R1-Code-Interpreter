    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical development of the Proto-Indo-European verb *seh₂g-yeti* into Proto-Germanic and its daughter languages.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Analyzing the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **PIE Form:** *seh₂g-yeti*\n*   **Root:** *seh₂g-*, meaning 'to track, to give a sign'. The cognates given, Latin *sāgīre* ('to perceive keenly') and Hittite *sākizzi* ('(s)he gives a sign'), confirm this root.\n*   **Structure:** This is a present-tense verb. *-ye-* is a present stem suffix, and *-ti* is the 3rd person singular active ending. The full form means \"(s)he is giving a sign.\"\n\n**Step 2: Correcting the PIE Base for Proto-Germanic**\n\nThere is a small discrepancy. The PIE form *seh₂g-yeti* with a short *e* vowel would not produce the known forms in Germanic languages. Germanic words like Old English *sēċan* and Old High German *suohhen* require a Proto-Germanic root with a long vowel, **\\*sōk-**. This long **\\*ō** is best derived from a PIE o-grade causative form, such as **\\*soh₂g-éyeti**. In this form:\n*   **\\*soh₂g-**: The o-grade root.\n*   **\\*-éye-**: The causative-iterative suffix.\n\nThis o-grade form is a common way to form causative verbs in PIE, and it correctly explains the long vowel seen in the Germanic reflexes. We will proceed using **\\*soh₂g-** as the base for the Germanic languages.\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Proto-Germanic (PGmc) Form**\n\nWe will trace the sound changes from PIE **\\*soh₂g-éyeti** to Proto-Germanic.\n1.  **Vowel Change:** The PIE sequence of **\\*o** + laryngeal **\\*h₂** (*oH*) regularly develops into a long **\\*ō** in Proto-Germanic. So, *soh₂g-* -> *sōg-*.\n2.  **Grimm's Law:** This law affects PIE stop consonants. The voiced velar stop **\\*g** becomes a voiceless velar stop **\\*k**. So, *sōg-* -> **\\*sōk-**.\n3.  **Verb Class:** The PIE causative suffix *-eye-* becomes the suffix for Class 1 weak verbs in Proto-Germanic, **\\*-ja-**. Verbs of this class are characterized by this suffix and a dental preterite.\n4.  **Personal Ending:** The PIE 3rd person singular ending **\\*-ti** becomes **\\*-þ(i)** in Proto-Germanic.\n5.  **Putting it together:** The stem is *sōk-ja-*. The 3rd person singular present indicative is formed from this stem. The Proto-Germanic form is reconstructed as **\\*sōkiþ**. The meaning shifts from \"tracking/giving a sign\" to \"seeking/looking for.\"\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:** **\\*sōkiþ** '(s)he seeks'\n\n**Step 4: Derivation of the Old Norse (ON) Form**\n\nWe start with the PGmc form **\\*sōkiþ**.\n1.  **i-Umlaut:** The */i/* sound in the stem (**\\*sōk***i***þ**) causes the preceding back vowel **\\*ō** to be fronted. In Old Norse, the result of i-umlaut on *ō* is the front rounded vowel **ǿ** (also written as œ). So, *sōk-* -> *sǿk-*.\n2.  **Ending:** The PGmc ending *-þ* develops into *-r* in the Old Norse 3rd person singular present indicative. The typical ending for this verb class is **-ir**.\n3.  **Final Form:** The stem *sǿk-* combines with the ending *-ir*.\n\n*   **Old Norse Result:** **sǿkir**\n\n**Step 5: Derivation of the Old English (OE) Form**\n\nWe start from the West Germanic intermediate *sōkiþ*.\n1.  **i-Umlaut:** As in Old Norse, the */i/* in the stem causes umlaut (or mutation) of the root vowel **\\*ō**. In Old English, **\\*ō** becomes **ē**. So, *sōk-* -> *sēk-*.\n2.  **Palatalization:** In Old English, the velar consonant **k** becomes a palato-alveolar affricate **ċ** (/tʃ/, the \"ch\" sound in \"church\") when it comes before a front vowel like the newly formed **ē**. So, *sēk-* -> **sēċ-**.\n3.  **Ending:** The 3sg. pres. ending in Old English is **-eþ** (or **-þ** after syncope).\n4.  **Final Form:** The palatalized stem *sēċ-* combines with the ending *-eþ*.\n\n*   **Old English Result:** **sēċeþ**\n\n**Step 6: Derivation of the Old High German (OHG) Form**\n\nWe start from the pre-OHG form *sōkiþ*.\n1.  **OHG Diphthongization:** Proto-Germanic long **\\*ō** regularly becomes the diphthong **uo** in Old High German. So, *sōk-* -> *suok-*.\n2.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** Proto-Germanic voiceless stops underwent shifting in OHG. After a vowel, **\\*k** becomes the long voiceless fricative **hh** (/xx/, like the \"ch\" in Scottish \"loch\"). So, *suok-* -> **suohh-**.\n3.  **Umlaut & Ending:** The stem originally contained an */i/* that should cause umlaut (*uo* > *üe*). However, in OHG, the fronting effect of umlaut was often blocked or reversed by the following back consonant cluster *hh*. Therefore, the vowel remains **uo**. The 3sg. pres. ending becomes **-it**.\n4.  **Final Form:** The shifted stem *suohh-* combines with the ending *-it*.\n\n*   **Old High German Result:** **suohhit**\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n*   **Initial PIE form vs. Germanic Reflex:** The provided PIE form *seh₂g-yeti* needs adjustment to a causative o-grade (*soh₂g-éyeti*) to correctly derive the PGmc form with a long *ō*.\n*   **Grimm's Law:** The change *g* > *k* is a core principle.\n*   **I-Umlaut:** This is a crucial change from Proto-Germanic to the daughter languages, but it has different results in each branch (ON: *ō > ǿ*; OE: *ō > ē*; OHG: *ō > uo* with umlaut often blocked).\n*   **Language-Specific Consonant Shifts:** Old English palatalizes *k* to *ċ*, while Old High German shifts *k* to *hh*.\n*   **Morphology:** It is important to trace the 3rd person singular ending through each stage (*-ti* > *-þ* > ON *-r*, OE *-eþ*, OHG *-it*).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the forms derived from the PIE verb are:\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** \\*sōkiþ\n*   **Old Norse:** sǿkir\n*   **Old English:** sēċeþ\n*   **Old High German:** suohhit\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkiþ; Old Norse: sǿkir; Old English: sēċeþ; Old High German: suohhit>>>"
