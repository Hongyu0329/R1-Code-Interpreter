    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Variety X\n\n*   **C** is a smooth projective curve of genus $g=3$.\n*   **X** is the 15th symmetric power of C, denoted as $X = \\text{Sym}^{15}(C)$. An element of X can be viewed as an effective divisor of degree 15 on C.\n*   The Neron-Severi group of a variety, $NS(X)$, is the group of divisors modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, denoted $\\rho(X)$, is also called the Picard number.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi Group of X to the Geometry of C\n\nThe key is to understand the structure of $X = \\text{Sym}^{15}(C)$. We use the Albanese map (or sum map) for X:\n$s: X = \\text{Sym}^{15}(C) \\to \\text{Pic}^{15}(C)$\nwhich sends an effective divisor $D$ of degree 15 to its linear equivalence class $[D]$.\n\nThe variety $\\text{Pic}^{15}(C)$ is isomorphic to the Jacobian of C, $J(C)$, which is a 3-dimensional abelian variety. Let's analyze the fibers of this map. The fiber over a point $[L] \\in \\text{Pic}^{15}(C)$ is the set of all effective divisors $D$ linearly equivalent to $L$. This set is naturally identified with the projective space $\\mathbb{P}(H^0(C, L))$. The dimension of this fiber is $h^0(C, L) - 1$.\n\nTo determine if this map gives X the structure of a bundle, we need to check if the dimension of the fiber is constant. We can calculate $h^0(C, L)$ using the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n$h^0(C, L) - h^1(C, L) = \\text{deg}(L) - g + 1$\n\nBy Serre duality, $h^1(C, L) = h^0(C, K_C - L)$, where $K_C$ is the canonical divisor on C.\n\nIn our case:\n*   $g = 3$\n*   $\\text{deg}(L) = 15$\n*   The degree of the canonical divisor is $\\text{deg}(K_C) = 2g - 2 = 2(3) - 2 = 4$.\n\nNow we calculate the degree of $K_C - L$:\n$\\text{deg}(K_C - L) = \\text{deg}(K_C) - \\text{deg}(L) = 4 - 15 = -11$.\n\nSince the degree of the divisor $K_C - L$ is negative, it has no non-zero global sections. Thus, $h^0(C, K_C - L) = 0$.\nThis means $h^1(C, L) = 0$ for *every* line bundle $L$ of degree 15.\n\nPlugging this back into the Riemann-Roch formula:\n$h^0(C, L) - 0 = 15 - 3 + 1$\n$h^0(C, L) = 13$\n\nSince $h^0(C, L)$ is constant for all $L \\in \\text{Pic}^{15}(C)$, the dimension of the fiber of the map $s$ is constant:\n$\\dim(\\text{fiber}) = h^0(C, L) - 1 = 13 - 1 = 12$.\n\nThis implies that $X = \\text{Sym}^{15}(C)$ is a projective bundle over the Jacobian $J(C)$, specifically a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle. For any projective bundle $\\mathbb{P}(E) \\to B$ over a smooth projective variety $B$, the rank of the Neron-Severi group is given by:\n$\\rho(\\mathbb{P}(E)) = \\rho(B) + 1$.\n\nApplying this to our situation, we get:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Smallest and Largest Possible Values for œÅ(J(C))\n\nThe problem now reduces to finding the minimum and maximum possible ranks of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve. For an abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$, it is a known result that $1 \\le \\rho(A) \\le g^2$. In our case, $A = J(C)$ and $g=3$, so $1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 9$. We need to verify that these bounds are attained by Jacobians of genus 3 curves.\n\n#### Smallest Rank\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must ensure there exists a genus 3 curve C for which $\\rho(J(C))=1$.\n*   For a *generic* genus 3 curve C (for instance, a non-hyperelliptic one), the endomorphism ring of its Jacobian is as small as possible: $\\text{End}(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   The rank of the Neron-Severi group, $\\rho(J(C))$, is the dimension of the vector space of symmetric endomorphisms (with respect to the Rosati involution) tensored with $\\mathbb{Q}$. When $\\text{End}(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$, this dimension is 1.\n*   Therefore, the minimum possible rank is $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1$.\n\n#### Largest Rank\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must ensure there exists a genus 3 curve C for which $\\rho(J(C))=9$.\n*   The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ is maximized when the curve C has Complex Multiplication (CM), meaning its Jacobian $J(C)$ has a large ring of endomorphisms. The theoretical maximum is $\\rho(J(C)) = g^2 = 9$.\n*   This maximum is achieved if $J(C)$ is isogenous to a product of 3 mutually isogenous elliptic curves with CM. For example, $J(C) \\sim E \\times E \\times E$, where $E$ is an elliptic curve with CM.\n*   A well-known example of a curve whose Jacobian achieves this is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$. This is a smooth curve of genus 3. Its Jacobian is isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve with CM by the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n*   For this curve, $\\rho(J(C))$ is indeed $3^2=9$.\n*   Therefore, the maximum possible rank is $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nNow we can calculate the smallest and largest possible ranks for $\\rho(X)$ using our formula $\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n*   **Smallest Rank:**\n    $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n*   **Largest Rank:**\n    $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
