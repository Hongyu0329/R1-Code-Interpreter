    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   It consists of a benzene ring.\n    *   At position 1, there is an N,N-diethylamide group, -C(=O)N(C₂H₅)₂. This is a very strong Directed Metalation Group (DMG). The carbonyl oxygen and the amide nitrogen can chelate a lithium ion.\n    *   At position 3, there is a dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂. This is also a good DMG, as the nitrogen atom can coordinate to a lithium ion.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction Step:**\n    *   **Reagents:** sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium) and TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) in THF.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) reaction. sec-BuLi is a strong base that removes a proton (deprotonation) from the aromatic ring, replacing it with a lithium atom (lithiation).\n    *   **Role of TMEDA:** TMEDA is a chelating agent for lithium ions. It breaks up the aggregates of sec-BuLi, making it a stronger, more reactive base. It also complexes with the lithium ion, facilitating the deprotonation at a site directed by the DMG.\n    *   **Regioselectivity (Where does the lithiation occur?):** We need to determine the most acidic proton on the benzene ring. This is dictated by the directing effects of the two substituent groups.\n        *   The amide group at position 1 directs the lithiation to its *ortho* positions, which are C2 and C6.\n        *   The amino group at position 3 directs the lithiation to its *ortho* positions, which are C2 and C4.\n        *   Both groups direct the lithiation to the C2 position. This is a cooperative or reinforcing effect. The proton at C2 is flanked by two directing groups, making it the most acidic and sterically accessible site for deprotonation by the bulky sec-BuLi/TMEDA complex. Deprotonation will overwhelmingly occur at C2.\n    *   **Intermediate Product:** The product of this step is an aryllithium species: 2-lithio-N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This intermediate is a potent nucleophile, with a carbanionic character at the C2 position.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction Step:**\n    *   **Reagent:** Methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** The aryllithium nucleophile formed in the first step reacts with an electrophile. Methyl iodide is a classic electrophile for alkylation.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The nucleophilic carbon at position 2 of the aromatic ring attacks the electrophilic methyl group of CH₃I in an Sₙ2-like fashion. The iodide ion (I⁻) acts as the leaving group. The C-Li bond is replaced by a C-CH₃ bond.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   Starting with the N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide structure, a proton is removed from the C2 position and replaced with a methyl group.\n    *   Therefore, the final compound has the following substituents on the benzene ring:\n        *   Position 1: -C(=O)N(C₂H₅)₂\n        *   Position 2: -CH₃\n        *   Position 3: -N(CH₃)₂\n    *   The name of this compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Identifying the Reaction:** Recognizing this as a Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM) is crucial.\n*   **Ranking Directing Groups:** Both the amide and amino groups are powerful DMGs, with the amide (-CONR₂) being one of the strongest.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The key to finding the correct product is identifying the site of lithiation. The cooperative effect of the two groups makes C2 the unambiguous site of deprotonation.\n*   **Role of Reagents:** Understanding the roles of sec-BuLi as a strong base, TMEDA as a chelating additive, and CH₃I as an electrophile is essential.\n*   **Final Structure:** Accurately placing the new methyl group on the correct carbon atom (C2) of the starting molecule's framework.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
