    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Flag of Tonga and the Matrix Representation**\n\n1.  **Flag of Tonga:** The flag consists of a red field with a white canton (a rectangle in the upper-left corner). Inside the white canton, there is a red couped cross (also known as a Greek cross, shaped like a '+').\n2.  **Matrix `M`:** We are given a matrix `M` where every red pixel has a value `a` and every white pixel has a value `b`. The question asks for the maximal possible rank of this matrix `M`. To find the maximum, we can choose the values of `a` and `b` that yield the highest rank.\n\n**Step 2: Express the Matrix `M` in a more structured form**\n\nLet `J` be the all-ones matrix of the same size as the image.\nLet `R` be an indicator matrix where `R(i, j) = 1` if the pixel `(i, j)` is red, and `0` otherwise.\nLet `W` be an indicator matrix where `W(i, j) = 1` if the pixel `(i, j)` is white, and `0` otherwise.\n\nFrom these definitions, `R + W = J`.\nThe matrix `M` can be written as `M = a * R + b * W`.\nSubstituting `W = J - R`, we get:\n`M = a * R + b * (J - R)`\n`M = a * R + b * J - b * R`\n`M = (a - b) * R + b * J`\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Rank of `M`**\n\nThe rank of a sum of matrices is less than or equal to the sum of their ranks: `rank(X + Y) <= rank(X) + rank(Y)`.\n`rank(M) <= rank((a - b) * R) + rank(b * J)`\n\nAssuming `a != b` and `b != 0`:\n`rank(M) <= rank(R) + rank(J)`\nThe rank of `J` (an all-ones matrix) is 1. So, `rank(M) <= rank(R) + 1`.\n\nA more powerful relationship can be established by analyzing the row spaces.\nThe row space of `M`, denoted `Row(M)`, is the set of all linear combinations of its rows. A row `m_i` of `M` is given by `m_i = (a - b) * r_i + b * u`, where `r_i` is the corresponding row of `R` and `u` is the all-ones row vector.\n\nThe flag has a large red field. Any row of the matrix that lies entirely in this red field (i.e., outside the canton) will be a row of all `a`'s. The corresponding row in `R` will be an all-ones vector `u`. Therefore, the all-ones vector `u` is in the row space of `R` (`u` is actually one of its rows). This means that the row space of `J`, `Row(J)`, is a subspace of the row space of `R`, `Row(R)`.\n\nSince any row of `M` is a linear combination of a row of `R` and the vector `u` (which is itself in `Row(R)`), every row of `M` is in `Row(R)`.\nThis implies that `Row(M)` is a subspace of `Row(R)`.\nTherefore, `rank(M) = dim(Row(M)) <= dim(Row(R)) = rank(R)`.\n\nThis provides a tighter upper bound on the rank of `M`. The problem now reduces to finding the maximal possible rank of the red indicator matrix `R`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Rank of the Red Indicator Matrix `R`**\n\nThe matrix `R` has a block structure corresponding to the flag's design.\n`R = [ R11  J ]`\n    `[  J   J ]`\nwhere `R11` is the indicator matrix for the red cross in the canton, and `J` represents submatrices of all ones.\n\nWe can simplify `R` using row operations, which do not change the rank.\n1.  Take the last row of `R`, which is `u = [1, 1, ..., 1]`.\n2.  Subtract this row `u` from all other rows of `R`.\n    *   Any other row in the bottom block (`[J J]`) is also `u`, so it becomes an all-zero row after subtraction.\n    *   A row `r_i` in the top block `[R11 J]` becomes `r_i - u`. If `r_i = [r_i_canton, 1, ..., 1]`, then `r_i - u = [r_i_canton - (1,...,1), 0, ..., 0]`.\n3.  The resulting matrix, `R'`, looks like this:\n    `R' = [ R11-J_c   0    ]`\n         `[    0        0    ]`\n         `[    u             ]` (the last row remains `u`)\n    Here `J_c` is an all-ones matrix of the same size as `R11`.\n\nThe rank of `R` is the rank of `R'`. The rows in the top block `[R11-J_c 0]` have zeros in the columns where the last row `u` has ones (outside the canton). This ensures that `u` is linearly independent of the rows from the top block.\nTherefore, `rank(R) = rank(R') = rank(R11 - J_c) + 1`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Rank of `(R11 - J_c)`**\n\n1.  `R11` is the indicator matrix for the red cross. A red couped cross is the union of a horizontal bar and a vertical bar. Let `I_H` be the set of row indices for the horizontal bar and `I_V` be the set of column indices for the vertical bar. Then `R11(i, j) = 1` if `i in I_H` or `j in I_V`.\n2.  The matrix `R11 - J_c` has entries:\n    *   `0` if the pixel is on the cross (`R11(i, j) = 1`).\n    *   `-1` if the pixel is part of the white background of the canton (`R11(i, j) = 0`).\n3.  Let `W_c = J_c - R11` be the indicator matrix for the white parts of the canton. `rank(R11 - J_c) = rank(W_c)`.\n4.  `W_c(i, j) = 1` if and only if the pixel is white, which means `i` is NOT in `I_H` AND `j` is NOT in `I_V`.\n5.  This structure allows `W_c` to be expressed as an outer product of two vectors. Let `u_vec` be a column vector where `u_vec(i) = 1` if `i` is not in `I_H`, and `0` otherwise. Let `v_vec` be a row vector where `v_vec(j) = 1` if `j` is not in `I_V`, and `0` otherwise. Then `W_c = u_vec * v_vec`.\n6.  The rank of an outer product of two non-zero vectors is 1. The vectors `u_vec` and `v_vec` are non-zero because the canton must have white areas (i.e., rows and columns not covered by the cross).\n7.  Therefore, `rank(W_c) = 1`. This means `rank(R11 - J_c) = 1`.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nFrom Step 4, `rank(R) = rank(R11 - J_c) + 1`.\nSubstituting our result from Step 5, `rank(R) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\nFrom Step 3, we know `rank(M) <= rank(R)`.\nSo, `rank(M) <= 2`.\n\nTo show that the *maximal* rank is 2, we need to show that a rank of 2 is achievable.\nConsider the case where `a=1` and `b=0`. Then the matrix `M` is exactly the red indicator matrix `R`.\nIn this case, `rank(M) = rank(R) = 2`.\nSince we have found an achievable rank of 2 and have shown that the rank can never exceed 2, the maximal possible rank is 2."
