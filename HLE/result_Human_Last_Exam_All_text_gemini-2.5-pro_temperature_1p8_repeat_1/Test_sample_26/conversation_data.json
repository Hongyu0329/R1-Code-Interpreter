    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Characterize the space X\nLet $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in the complex projective 3-space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n1.  **Dimension:** $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex manifold of dimension 3 (real dimension 6). A hypersurface is a subvariety of codimension 1. Thus, $X$ is a complex surface, with $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} X = 2$ and $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} X = 4$.\n2.  **Degree:** The degree of the polynomial defining $X$ is $d=5$.\n3.  **Topology (Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem):** Let $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$ be the inclusion map. The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for homotopy groups states that for a smooth complex subvariety of dimension $k$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, the inclusion induces isomorphisms on $\\pi_j$ for $j < k$ and a surjection for $j=k$.\n    In our case, $k = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}} X = 2$. So,\n    *   $i_*: \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is an isomorphism.\n    *   $i_*: \\pi_2(X) \\to \\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ is a surjection.\n    The homotopy groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ are known from the fibration $S^1 \\to S^{2n+1} \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$. We have $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$ and $\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$, meaning $X$ is simply connected.\n\n### Step 2: Relate $\\pi_3(X)$ to another space using the cofibration sequence\nWe can view the pair $(X, \\mathbb{CP}^3)$ as part of a cofibration sequence:\n$$ X \\xrightarrow{i} \\mathbb{CP}^3 \\xrightarrow{q} \\mathbb{CP}^3/X $$\nwhere $\\mathbb{CP}^3/X$ is the space obtained by collapsing $X$ to a point. For a good pair (like a subvariety in a manifold), $\\mathbb{CP}^3/X$ is homotopy equivalent to the Thom space of the normal bundle of $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. Let's denote this Thom space as $M = Th(N_X)$. The normal bundle $N_X$ is the line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_X(5)$, which has real rank 2.\n\nThis cofibration induces a long exact sequence in homotopy:\n$$ \\dots \\to \\pi_k(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\xrightarrow{q_*} \\pi_k(M) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_{k-1}(X) \\to \\dots $$\nLet's look at the part of the sequence relevant for $\\pi_3(X)$:\n$$ \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\xrightarrow{q_*} \\pi_4(M) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_3(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) $$\nThe homotopy groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ for $k \\geq 2$ are isomorphic to those of $S^{2n+1}$. So, $\\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_k(S^7)$ for $k \\geq 2$.\n*   $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_3(S^7) = 0$.\n*   $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\pi_4(S^7) = 0$.\nPlugging these into the sequence gives:\n$$ 0 \\to \\pi_4(M) \\xrightarrow{\\partial} \\pi_3(X) \\to 0 $$\nThis is a short exact sequence, which implies that the map $\\partial$ is an isomorphism. Thus,\n$$ \\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_4(M) $$\nOur problem is now reduced to finding the rank of $\\pi_4(M)$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the homotopy groups of the Thom space M\nTo find $\\pi_4(M)$, we use the Hurewicz theorem, which relates homotopy to homology. This requires us to know the connectivity of $M$.\n1.  **Connectivity of M:** We use the cofibration sequence again.\n    *   **$\\pi_1(M)$:** The sequence fragment is $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_1(M) \\to \\pi_0(X)$. Since $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)=0$ and $\\pi_0(X)$ is a point mapping to $\\pi_0(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$, $\\pi_1(M)=0$.\n    *   **$\\pi_2(M)$:** The sequence is $\\pi_2(X) \\xrightarrow{i_*} \\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to \\pi_2(M) \\to \\pi_1(X)$. Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$ and $i_*$ is surjective by Lefschetz, its cokernel is trivial. This implies $\\pi_2(M) = 0$.\n    Since $\\pi_1(M)=0$ and $\\pi_2(M)=0$, $M$ is 2-connected.\n2.  **Hurewicz Theorem (first application):** For a $(k-1)$-connected space, the Hurewicz map $h_k: \\pi_k \\to H_k$ is an isomorphism. Since $M$ is 2-connected, the Hurewicz map $h_3: \\pi_3(M) \\to H_3(M)$ is an isomorphism.\n3.  **Thom Isomorphism Theorem:** This theorem relates the homology of the base space $X$ to the homology of the Thom space $M$. For a rank-r oriented bundle, $H_k(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_{k+r}(M; \\mathbb{Z})$. Here $r=2$. So, $H_3(M) \\cong H_1(X)$.\n4.  **Putting it together for $\\pi_3(M)$:** We have $\\pi_3(M) \\cong H_3(M) \\cong H_1(X)$. Since $X$ is simply connected, its first homology group is trivial: $H_1(X)=0$. Therefore, $\\pi_3(M)=0$.\n5.  **Conclusion on Connectivity:** We have shown $\\pi_1(M)=\\pi_2(M)=\\pi_3(M)=0$. This means $M$ is 3-connected.\n\n### Step 4: Compute $\\pi_4(M)$\nSince $M$ is 3-connected, we can apply the Hurewicz theorem again.\n1.  **Hurewicz Theorem (second application):** For a $(k-1)$-connected space, the Hurewicz map $h_k: \\pi_k \\to H_k$ is an isomorphism. As $M$ is 3-connected, $h_4: \\pi_4(M) \\to H_4(M)$ is an isomorphism.\n2.  **Thom Isomorphism:** We use the Thom isomorphism again to find $H_4(M)$.\n    $H_4(M) \\cong H_{4-2}(X) = H_2(X)$.\n3.  **So, $\\pi_4(M) \\cong H_2(X)$.**\n\n### Step 5: Compute the second Betti number of X\nThe rank of $\\pi_4(M)$ (and thus of $\\pi_3(X)$) is the second Betti number of $X$, $b_2(X)$. For a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, the Betti numbers can be calculated.\n1.  $X$ is a 4-dimensional orientable manifold. It is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X)=0$), so $b_1(X)=0$. By PoincarÃ© duality, $b_3(X)=b_1(X)=0$. Also, $b_0(X)=1$ and $b_4(X)=1$ (since it's connected and compact).\n2.  The Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ is given by the formula $\\chi(X) = d(d^2 - 4d + 6)$ for a degree-$d$ surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. For our quintic surface, $d=5$.\n    $\\chi(X) = 5(5^2 - 4(5) + 6) = 5(25 - 20 + 6) = 5(11) = 55$.\n3.  The Euler characteristic is also the alternating sum of Betti numbers: $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$.\n    $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n4.  Solving for $b_2(X)$, we get $b_2(X) = 55 - 2 = 53$.\n5.  Since $X$ is a smooth projective surface, its second homology group $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free. Thus, $H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n\n### Step 6: Final Conclusion\nWe have established the following chain of isomorphisms for the ranks of the groups:\n*   $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\text{rank}(\\pi_4(M))$\n*   $\\text{rank}(\\pi_4(M)) = \\text{rank}(H_4(M))$ since $M$ is 3-connected.\n*   $\\text{rank}(H_4(M)) = \\text{rank}(H_2(X))$ by Thom isomorphism.\n*   $\\text{rank}(H_2(X)) = b_2(X) = 53$.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is 53."
