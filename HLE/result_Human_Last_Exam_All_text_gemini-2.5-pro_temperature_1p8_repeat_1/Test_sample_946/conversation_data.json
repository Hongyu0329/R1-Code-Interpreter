    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Source and Episode:** The question specifically points to the online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\" and the episode \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Event:** The setting for the key part of the episode is the Junior Prom.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Dialogue about the Performer:**\n    *   The character \"The Ugly One\" comments on the musical entertainment, stating, \"The musical guest is just a cardboard cutout of some singer.\" This establishes that we are looking for the identity of a cutout, not a live performer.\n    *   The character \"So and So\" expresses her desire, saying, \"Oooh, I hope it's Thompkins!\" This introduces a potential name but as a hope, not a fact.\n\n4.  **Identify the Confirmed Performer:**\n    *   The character \"Cheerleader\" excitedly refutes So and So's hope, exclaiming, \"NO WAY! IT'S KASPERO!\"\n    *   Immediately following this line, the cartoon cuts to a shot of the stage where a cardboard cutout of a male singer is propped up. Below the cutout, the name \"Kaspero\" is explicitly written on screen.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The dialogue and visual evidence within the episode directly confirm that the cardboard cutout performing at the Junior Prom is of the fictional singer named Kaspero.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Don't confuse the desired performer with the actual one:** The name \"Thompkins\" is mentioned, but only as a hope by one of the characters. The actual performer is confirmed immediately after.\n*   **Trust the on-screen text:** The cartoon reinforces Cheerleader's line by visually displaying the name \"Kaspero\" on screen with the cutout, leaving no room for ambiguity.\n*   **Understand the context:** In the humorous, low-fi world of Teen Girl Squad, a cardboard cutout serves as the \"performer\" for the prom.\n\n<<<Kaspero>>>"
