    "Answering the question \"Let a(n) be the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice. What is a(10)?\" requires a step-by-step combinatorial analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is a 2D square grid, where movement is restricted to four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). Positions can be represented by integer coordinates (x, y).\n*   **n-step Walk:** A path consisting of `n` sequential moves (edges) and `n+1` points (vertices).\n*   **Self-avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk where no point is visited more than once. The path cannot cross or touch itself at any point.\n*   **a(n):** The total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks. By standard convention in this problem, we count all walks starting from a fixed origin, (0,0). The total number of walks is independent of the starting point due to the symmetry of the lattice.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis for Small `n`\n\nWe can enumerate the number of walks for small values of `n` to understand the process. A walk is built by extending shorter walks.\n\n*   **n = 0:** There is one walk of length zero, which is just the starting point itself.\n    *   `a(0) = 1`\n\n*   **n = 1:** From the origin (0,0), there are 4 possible moves: to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1). All are valid one-step SAWs.\n    *   `a(1) = 4`\n\n*   **n = 2:** Each of the 4 one-step walks can be extended. For a walk that ended at (1,0), the next step cannot be back to (0,0). There are 3 valid directions left: to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1). This applies to all 4 initial walks.\n    *   `a(2) = a(1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12`\n\n*   **n = 3:** For any 2-step SAW, like (0,0) → (1,0) → (2,0), the visited points are {(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)}. From (2,0), there are 3 non-reversing moves available, and none of them land on a previously visited point. The same logic applies to a \"turn\" walk like (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1). At this length, it's not yet possible for a non-reversing move to land on an old point.\n    *   `a(3) = a(2) * 3 = 12 * 3 = 36`\n\n### Step 3: Dealing with Self-Intersections (`n=4`)\n\nFrom n=4 onwards, a non-reversing move can cause a self-intersection.\n\n*   **For n = 4:** We start with the 36 walks of length 3. Naively, one might think `a(4) = 36 * 3 = 108`. However, we must subtract the walks that are not self-avoiding.\n*   **Careful Point 1: Type of Intersection.** A 4-step walk is `v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4`. The last step `v_3 → v_4` is invalid if `v_4` is one of the previous points `{v_0, v_1, v_2}`. The move to `v_2` is already forbidden (it's a direct reversal). `v_4` cannot equal `v_1` on a square lattice because the Manhattan distance between `v_1` and `v_3` is always 2. Therefore, the only possible intersection is `v_4 = v_0`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Counting Intersections.** The intersection `v_4 = v_0` occurs when the 3-step walk `v_0 → v_1 → v_2 → v_3` forms a \"C\" shape, placing the endpoint `v_3` adjacent to the start point `v_0`. An example is (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (0,1). The next step from (0,1) to (0,0) would create a 1x1 square loop. We must count how many such \"C\" shaped 3-step walks exist.\n    *   Starting at (0,0), there are 4 choices for the first step (e.g., right). The second step must be a turn (2 choices, e.g., up or down). The third step must be another turn towards the origin (1 choice, e.g., left).\n    *   Number of such \"C\" paths = `4 * 2 * 1 = 8`.\n*   **Calculation for a(4):**\n    *   `a(4) = (a(3) * 3) - (number of intersections) = 108 - 8 = 100`.\n\n### Step 4: Extrapolation to `n=10`\n\nThe method of direct counting and subtracting intersections becomes extremely complex as `n` grows. For `n=5`, we would need to count how many 4-step walks have endpoints adjacent to any of their earlier non-adjacent points. For `n=10`, this manual classification is computationally infeasible.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Computational Complexity.** The problem of counting SAWs is famously difficult. There is no known simple formula for `a(n)`. The values for `n > 5` are typically found using sophisticated computer algorithms (like recursive backtracking, known as exact enumeration) which take a significant amount of time.\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Using Known Results.** Since this is a well-studied problem in combinatorics and statistical physics, the sequence `a(n)` is tabulated. This question is most realistically answered by recognizing the problem and referring to these known, computed values. The sequence is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001411.\n\n### Final Step: Acquiring the Answer\n\nConsulting the known, pre-computed values for the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice, we find the sequence continues as:\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\n<<<44100>>>"
