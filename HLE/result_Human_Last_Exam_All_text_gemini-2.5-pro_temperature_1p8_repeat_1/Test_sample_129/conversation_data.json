    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of length 5.\n\n**1. Define the Problem and Constraints**\n\n*   **Objective:** Find the number of valid boolean expressions that evaluate to `True`.\n*   **Length:** The expression must consist of exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Allowed Symbols:** `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`. Symbols can be repeated.\n*   **Operators and Precedence:** `!` (NOT, highest), `&` (AND), `|` (OR, lowest). Standard parenthetical grouping applies.\n*   **Operands:** `T` (True) and `F` (False).\n\n**2. Identify All Possible Syntactic Structures**\n\nWe need to find all possible structures for a well-formed boolean expression (wff) of length 5. Let `A`, `B`, `C` represent a literal (`T` or `F`), and `op`, `op'` represent a binary operator (`&` or `|`).\n\nHere are the distinct, valid structures of length 5:\n\n*   **Structure 1: `(A op B)`**\n    *   Example: `(T&F)`. Length: 1(`(`) + 1(`A`) + 1(`op`) + 1(`B`) + 1(`)`) = 5.\n*   **Structure 2: `((A))`**\n    *   Example: `((T))`. Length: 1(`(`) + 1(`(`) + 1(`A`) + 1(`)`) + 1(`)`) = 5.\n*   **Structure 3: `A op B op C`**\n    *   Example: `T&F|T`. Length: 1(`A`) + 1(`op`) + 1(`B`) + 1(`op'`) + 1(`C`) = 5. The lack of parentheses means parsing relies on precedence (`&` before `|`).\n*   **Structure 4: `!A op !B`**\n    *   Example: `!T|!F`. Length: 2(`!A`) + 1(`op`) + 2(`!B`) = 5. Parsing is `(!A) op (!B)`.\n*   **Structure 5: `A op (B)`**\n    *   Example: `T|(F)`. Length: 1(`A`) + 1(`op`) + 3(`(B)`) = 5.\n*   **Structure 6: `(A) op B`**\n    *   Example: `(T)|F`. Length: 3(`(A)`) + 1(`op`) + 1(`B`) = 5.\n*   **Structure 7: `!(!A)`**\n    *   Example: `!(!T)`. The string is `! ( ! T )`, which has 5 symbols. It is parsed as `! applied to (!T)`.\n*   **Structure 8: `!!(A)`**\n    *   Example: `!!(T)`. The string is `! ! ( T )`, which has 5 symbols. It is parsed as `! applied to ! applied to (T)`.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Structure and Count True Expressions**\n\nNow, we evaluate how many true expressions each structure can form.\n\n*   **Structure 1: `(A op B)`**\n    *   `(T&T)` = T\n    *   `(T|T)` = T\n    *   `(T|F)` = T\n    *   `(F|T)` = T\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Structure 2: `((A))`**\n    *   `((T))` = T\n    *   `((F))` = F\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **Structure 3: `A op B op C`**\n    *   `A&B&C`: True only if A, B, C are all T. `T&T&T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `(A&B)|C`: True if `C=T` (4 expressions) or if `C=F` and `A=B=T` (1 expression, `T&T|F`). Total: 5 expressions.\n    *   `A|(B&C)`: True if `A=T` (4 expressions) or if `A=F` and `B=C=T` (1 expression, `F|T&T`). Total: 5 expressions.\n    *   `A|B|C`: True unless A, B, C are all F. 2Â³ - 1 = 7 expressions.\n    *   **Count: 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 18**\n\n*   **Structure 4: `!A op !B`**\n    *   `!A & !B`: True only if `!A=T` and `!B=T`, so `A=F, B=F`. Expression: `!F&!F`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!A | !B`: True unless `!A=F` and `!B=F`, so `A=T, B=T`. Expressions: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`. (3 expressions)\n    *   **Count: 1 + 3 = 4**\n\n*   **Structure 5: `A op (B)`**\n    *   `T&(T)` = T\n    *   `T|(T)` = T\n    *   `T|(F)` = T\n    *   `F|(T)` = T\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Structure 6: `(A) op B`**\n    *   `(T)&T` = T\n    *   `(T)|T` = T\n    *   `(T)|F` = T\n    *   `(F)|T` = T\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Structure 7: `!(!A)`**\n    *   `!(!T)` -> `!(F)` = T\n    *   `!(!F)` -> `!(T)` = F\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **Structure 8: `!!(A)`**\n    *   `!!(T)` -> `!(!(T))` -> `!(F)` = T\n    *   `!!(F)` -> `!(!(F))` -> `!(T)` = F\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n**4. Sum the Counts**\n\nFinally, sum the counts from all the distinct structures.\n\nTotal = (from Struct 1) + (from Struct 2) + (from Struct 3) + (from Struct 4) + (from Struct 5) + (from Struct 6) + (from Struct 7) + (from Struct 8)\nTotal = 4 + 1 + 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1\nTotal = 37\n\nThere are 37 possible true boolean expressions of length 5.\n\n<<<37>>>"
