    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n\n*   **Carbonyl Compound:** The first reactant is pivalaldehyde.\n    *   \"Pival-\" refers to the pivaloyl group, which contains a tert-butyl group, (CH₃)₃C-.\n    *   \"Aldehyde\" indicates the presence of a -CHO functional group.\n    *   Therefore, the structure of pivalaldehyde is (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n\n    *Structure of Pivalaldehyde:*\n    ```\n          O\n         //\n    (CH₃)₃C - C - H\n    ```\n\n*   **Wittig Reagent (Ylide):** The second reactant is (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane.\n    *   \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" is a systematic name for a triphenylphosphorane, the ylide part, which has the general structure Ph₃P=.\n    *   The group attached to the phosphorus via the double bond is described by \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)\".\n    *   \"ethylidene\" refers to a two-carbon fragment attached by a double bond at its first carbon: `=CH-CH₂-`.\n    *   \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" means a 2-chlorophenyl group (a phenyl ring with a Cl atom at the ortho position) is attached to the second carbon of the ethylidene group.\n    *   Combining these parts, the Wittig reagent has the structure: Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl), where the chlorine is at position 2 of the phenyl ring.\n\n    *Structure of the Wittig Reagent:*\n    ```\n            Ph                     (ortho-Cl)\n           /                      /\n    Ph - P = CH - CH₂ - (phenyl ring)\n           \\\n            Ph\n    ```\n\n**2. Understand the Wittig Reaction Mechanism**\n\nThe Wittig reaction creates a carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) by reacting a carbonyl compound (aldehyde or ketone) with a phosphonium ylide. The reaction essentially swaps the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group with the carbon part of the ylide.\n\n*   The carbonyl `C=O` bond is broken.\n*   The phosphorane `P=C` bond is broken.\n*   A new `C=C` alkene bond is formed.\n*   A new `P=O` bond is formed, creating the byproduct triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n\n**3. Determine the Structure of the Product**\n\nWe combine the relevant parts of the two reactants:\n*   From pivalaldehyde: The `(CH₃)₃C-CH` fragment.\n*   From the ylide: The `=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)` fragment.\n\nThese two fragments join at the site of the former C=O and P=C bonds to form the new C=C double bond.\n\nProduct Structure:\n```\n(CH₃)₃C - CH = CH - CH₂ - (o-ClC₆H₄)\n```\nThis is the main organic product. The byproduct is triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O).\n\n**4. Analyze the Stereochemistry (E/Z Isomerism)**\n\nThe newly formed double bond can exist as either the E (trans) or Z (cis) isomer. The stereochemical outcome of a Wittig reaction depends on the nature of the ylide.\n\n*   **Stabilized Ylides:** Have an electron-withdrawing group (like C=O, CN, ester) attached to the ylide carbon. They are resonance-stabilized and generally yield the thermodynamically more stable **E-alkene**.\n*   **Non-stabilized Ylides:** Have electron-donating groups (like alkyl groups) attached to the ylide carbon. They are not stabilized by resonance and react kinetically to yield the **Z-alkene** as the major product, especially under salt-free conditions.\n\nLet's classify our ylide: Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄).\nThe ylide carbon (`=CH-`) is bonded to a hydrogen and a 2-chlorobenzyl group (`-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)`). A benzyl group is considered an alkyl-type group (electron-donating). There are no electron-withdrawing groups directly attached to the ylide carbon. Therefore, this is a **non-stabilized ylide**.\n\nThe reaction of a non-stabilized ylide with an aldehyde will predominantly form the **Z-alkene**.\n\nTo assign the Z configuration, we use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for the groups on each carbon of the double bond:\n\n*   **Carbon from Pivalaldehyde (`(CH₃)₃C-CH=`):**\n    *   Group 1: `-C(CH₃)₃` (tert-butyl) - High priority.\n    *   Group 2: `-H` (hydrogen) - Low priority.\n\n*   **Carbon from the Ylide (`=CH-CH₂-`):**\n    *   Group 1: `-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)` (2-chlorobenzyl) - High priority.\n    *   Group 2: `-H` (hydrogen) - Low priority.\n\nThe **Z-isomer** is the one where the two high-priority groups (`-C(CH₃)₃` and `-CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)`) are on the same side (\"**Z**usammen\") of the double bond.\n\n*Structure of the Z-isomer:*\n```\n   C(CH₃)₃      CH₂-(o-ClC₆H₄)\n     \\          /\n      C   =   C\n     /          \\\n    H            H\n```\n\n**5. Name the Final Product**\n\nThe final step is to determine the systematic IUPAC name for the product.\n\n*   **Parent Chain:** Find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    ` (o-ClC₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=CH-C(CH₃)₃ `\n    The longest chain is a 5-carbon chain: a pentene. `CH₃-C(CH₃)₂-CH=CH-CH₂-`\n*   **Numbering:** Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible locant.\n    *   Numbering from the left (phenyl side): `(o-ClC₆H₄)-CH₂¹-CH²=CH³-C⁴(CH₃)₂-C⁵H₃`. The double bond starts at C-2 (a **pent-2-ene**).\n    *   Numbering from the right (tert-butyl side) gives a pent-3-ene, so the first numbering is correct.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   At position C-1: a (2-chlorophenyl) group.\n    *   At position C-4: two methyl groups (4,4-dimethyl).\n*   **Full Name:** Combine the stereochemistry, substituents, and parent chain name.\n\nThe product is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is primarily the Z-isomer of the resulting alkene due to the use of a non-stabilized ylide. The IUPAC name of this product is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<< (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene"
