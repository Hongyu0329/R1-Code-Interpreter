An FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` is a solution to the system of equations `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z`. A unique such point is guaranteed to exist if `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces and the functions `F`, `G`, `H` satisfy a set of contractive inequalities with non-negative coefficients `α_i, β_i, γ_i` such that `max( (α_1 + β_2 + γ_3), (α_2 + β_1 + γ_2), (α_3 + γ_1) ) < 1`.
