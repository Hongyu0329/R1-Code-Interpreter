    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the physicist in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Clues:**\n    *   **Profession:** The individual is a physicist.\n    *   **Primary Field of Fame:** They are \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\" This is a very strong clue, pointing to someone who made a fundamental contribution to microscopes.\n    *   **The Discovery:** It was an \"optical effect in real imagery.\" Real images can be projected onto a screen and are formed by converging light rays, such as those from a concave mirror or a convex lens.\n    *   **The Origin Story:** The effect was discovered after being \"accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors.\" This is a highly specific, anecdotal detail that can pinpoint the exact story.\n\n2.  **Search for the Story:**\n    The anecdote about a discovery related to imperfections on a concave mirror is a famous story in the history of optics. The key elements are \"concave mirror,\" \"imperfections,\" and \"accidental observation of an optical effect.\"\n\n3.  **Identify the Physicist and the Effect:**\n    The story belongs to the Dutch physicist **Frits Zernike**.\n    *   In the 1930s, Zernike was working with concave diffraction gratings to study the spectral lines of light.\n    *   He noticed that imperfections in the gratings (errors in the ruled lines) produced a faint \"ghost image\" that was shifted in phase by 90 degrees compared to the main (primary) image.\n    *   While the specific detail of a \"custodial worker\" making the initial observation is often considered an apocryphal or embellished part of the story, the core elements are correct: the effect was noticed while examining flaws on concave surfaces. Zernike was the one who understood the physics behind what he was seeing.\n\n4.  **Connect the Discovery to Microscopy:**\n    This is the crucial link. Zernike realized that this principle of phase shift could be applied to microscopy. Transparent biological samples (like living cells) don't absorb much light, so they are nearly invisible under a standard microscope. However, they do slightly slow down the light passing through them, creating a *phase shift*. Zernike developed a method to convert these invisible phase shifts into visible changes in brightness (amplitude). This invention is the **phase-contrast microscope**.\n\n5.  **Verify the Clues:**\n    *   **Physicist?** Yes, Frits Zernike was a physicist.\n    *   **Better known for microscopy?** Yes, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 specifically \"for his demonstration of the phase contrast method, especially for his invention of the phase contrast microscope.\"\n    *   **Discovered an optical effect in real imagery...concave mirrors?** Yes, the principle was discovered while analyzing real images formed by concave diffraction gratings.\n    *   **Accidentally observed?** Yes, the observation of the phase-shifted ghost image was an unexpected finding during his work.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAll the critical details in the question point directly to Frits Zernike and his discovery of the principle behind phase contrast, which he then brilliantly applied to create the phase-contrast microscope.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
