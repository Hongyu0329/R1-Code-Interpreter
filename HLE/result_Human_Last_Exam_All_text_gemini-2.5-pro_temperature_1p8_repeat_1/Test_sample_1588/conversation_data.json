    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Expansion**\n\nThe BCH formula provides the solution Z for the equation $e^Z = e^X e^Y$, where X and Y are non-commuting variables (like matrices or operators in a Lie algebra). The solution Z is expressed as an infinite series of nested commutators of X and Y:\n\n$Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\n\nHere, $Z_n(X, Y)$ represents the sum of all terms of total degree (or \"order\") n. For example:\n-   $Z_1(X, Y) = X + Y$\n-   $Z_2(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]$\n-   $Z_3(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] + \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [Y, X]]$\n-   ... and so on.\n\nThe question asks for the \"number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\". This means we need to find how many linearly independent commutator terms appear with a non-zero coefficient in the expression for $Z_{10}(X, Y)$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the BCH Expansion to Free Lie Algebras**\n\nThe set of all formal linear combinations of nested commutators of X and Y forms a mathematical structure called the **free Lie algebra** on two generators, denoted as $L(X, Y)$. This algebra is graded by the degree of the commutators:\n\n$L(X, Y) = \\bigoplus_{n=1}^{\\infty} L_n(X, Y)$\n\nwhere $L_n(X, Y)$ is the vector subspace spanned by all commutators of total degree n.\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of Lie algebras states that for any given order n, the BCH term $Z_n(X,Y)$ is a linear combination of basis elements of $L_n(X, Y)$, and crucially, all the coefficients in this combination are **non-zero**. Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients of order n is simply the dimension of the subspace $L_n(X, Y)$.\n\n**Step 3: Use Witt's Formula to Find the Dimension**\n\nThe dimension of the n-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on k generators is given by **Witt's formula**:\n\n$dim(L_n(k)) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\nWhere:\n-   `n` is the degree or order (in our case, n = 10).\n-   `k` is the number of generators (in our case, k = 2, for X and Y).\n-   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n-   $\\mu(d)$ is the **Möbius function**.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Witt's Formula for Order 10**\n\nWe need to calculate $dim(L_{10}(2))$:\n\n$dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n\n1.  **Find the divisors of 10:** The divisors `d` of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:**\n    -   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    -   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (since 2 has an odd number of distinct prime factors: one, which is 2).\n    -   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (since 5 has one distinct prime factor: 5).\n    -   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\times 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (since 10 has an even number of distinct prime factors: two, which are 2 and 5).\n\n3.  **Calculate each term in the sum $\\sum \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$:**\n    -   For `d=1`: $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = 1 \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$\n    -   For `d=2`: $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = -1 \\cdot 2^5 = -32$\n    -   For `d=5`: $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = -1 \\cdot 2^2 = -4$\n    -   For `d=10`: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 2$\n\n4.  **Sum the terms:**\n    Sum = $1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990$\n\n5.  **Complete the calculation by dividing by n=10:**\n    $dim(L_{10}(2)) = \\frac{990}{10} = 99$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The phrase \"number of nonzero coefficients\" must be correctly interpreted as the dimension of the underlying vector space, based on the property that all basis terms appear in the BCH series.\n*   Witt's formula is the correct tool for this specific combinatorial counting problem related to free Lie algebras.\n*   Care must be taken in computing the Möbius function and performing the arithmetic for the summation accurately. Each part of the calculation (divisors, Möbius values, powers, summation, and final division) needs to be correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the 10th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators, which is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
