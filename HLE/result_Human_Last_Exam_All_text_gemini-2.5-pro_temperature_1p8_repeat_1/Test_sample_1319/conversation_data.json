    "This is a fantastic question that requires combining literary knowledge from the *Iliad* with real-world geography. Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for four key things:\n1.  A **mountain**.\n2.  It must be **historical**, meaning a real, physical location.\n3.  It must be **mentioned in the *Iliad***.\n4.  It must be the **tallest** among the candidates, **after excluding Mount Olympus**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad*\nWe need to scan the epic for mentions of mountains. The most prominent ones are:\n\n*   **Mount Olympus**: The home of the gods, mentioned throughout the epic. It is the tallest mountain in Greece. As per the question, we must exclude this from our final answer.\n*   **Mount Ida**: This mountain is crucial to the *Iliad*'s plot. Located near Troy (in modern-day Turkey), it is where the gods, especially Zeus, often sit to watch the Trojan War unfold. Zeus retreats here in Book 8 and Hera seduces him here in Book 14. Its highest peak is Gargarus.\n*   **Mount Samothrace**: An island mountain in the northern Aegean Sea. In Book 13, Poseidon sits \"on the topmost peak of wooded Samos, the Thracian island\" to view the battlefield. This is the island of Samothrace, and its mountain is today called Mount Fengari.\n*   **Mount Pelion**: A mountain in Thessaly, Greece. It is mentioned in relation to the famous spear of Achilles, which was crafted from an ash tree felled on its peak.\n*   **Mount Athos**: A mountain and peninsula in northeastern Greece. In Book 14, during her journey from Olympus to Lemnos to deceive Zeus, the goddess Hera flies over several landmarks, including Athos. The text states she \"set foot on Athos and from there she stepped onto the heaving sea\".\n\n### Step 3: Find the Elevations of These Historical Mountains\nNow we must find the heights of these real-world mountains to compare them.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus**: Elevation 2,918 meters (9,573 ft). **Excluded**.\n*   **Mount Athos**: Elevation **2,033 meters (6,670 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağları, Turkey)**: Elevation **1,774 meters (5,820 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Pelion**: Elevation **1,624 meters (5,328 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Mount Fengari)**: Elevation **1,611 meters (5,285 ft)**.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Heights and Conclude\nWith the elevations established, we can now rank the candidate mountains (excluding Olympus) from tallest to shortest:\n1.  **Mount Athos** (2,033 m)\n2.  **Mount Ida** (1,774 m)\n3.  **Mount Pelion** (1,624 m)\n4.  **Mount Samothrace** (1,611 m)\n\nThe tallest mountain on this list is Mount Athos.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Distinguishing the two Mount Idas**: It is important to know that Greek mythology features another Mount Ida on the island of Crete (where Zeus was raised), but the mountain central to the *Iliad*'s story is the one near Troy.\n*   **Verifying the mentions**: All the mountains listed are explicitly named or clearly described in the *Iliad*. Athos and Pelion have brief but definitive mentions, while Ida and Samothrace serve as divine viewing platforms for the war.\n*   **Historical vs. Mythical**: All these are real, physical mountains, not purely mythical places, satisfying the \"historical\" criteria of the question.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, after Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Athos.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
