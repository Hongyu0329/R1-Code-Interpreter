    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the location of Waskaganish:**\n    Waskaganish is a Cree community located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec, Canada. Crucially, it is situated on the southeast shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n\n2.  **Identify the provinces and territories that border Quebec:**\n    To find the closest province or territory, we first need to list all the ones that share a border with Quebec. These are:\n    *   Ontario (to the west and south)\n    *   New Brunswick (to the southeast)\n    *   Newfoundland and Labrador (to the east)\n    *   Nunavut (to the north, with the border running through Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, and Ungava Bay, and including all islands within these bodies of water)\n\n3.  **Eliminate the more distant candidates based on Waskaganish's location:**\n    Waskaganish is in the *northwestern* part of Quebec's populated regions, on the shore of James Bay.\n    *   **New Brunswick** and **Newfoundland and Labrador** are on the far eastern and southeastern side of Quebec. They are separated from Waskaganish by the entire width of the province, making them very distant and unlikely candidates.\n    *   This leaves two main contenders: **Ontario** and **Nunavut**.\n\n4.  **Compare the proximity of Ontario and Nunavut:**\n    *   **Ontario:** The provincial border between Quebec and Ontario runs north-south, located just to the west of Waskaganish. This is a land border that extends south from the coast of James Bay. Waskaganish is situated very close to this land border.\n    *   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut includes all the islands located within James Bay. To reach Nunavut from Waskaganish, one would have to travel across the water of James Bay to the nearest island, such as Charlton Island or the Twin Islands.\n\n5.  **Determine the closest border:**\n    The key is to find the shortest distance from Waskaganish to the border of another province or territory.\n    *   The distance from the community of Waskaganish to the **land border of Ontario** to its west is a relatively short overland journey (approximately 50-60 kilometers).\n    *   The distance from Waskaganish across the open water to the nearest island belonging to **Nunavut** is significantly farther.\n    *   Therefore, the land border with Ontario is much closer to Waskaganish than any part of the territory of Nunavut.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Definition of \"Closest\":** The question asks for the shortest geographical distance (as the crow flies) from Waskaganish to the boundary of another province or territory.\n*   **Geography of James Bay:** It's important to understand that while Waskaganish is on the coast, the islands *within* the bay belong to Nunavut, while the mainland coast to the west belongs to Ontario, and the land border between Ontario and Quebec is very near Waskaganish.\n*   **Elimination:** Quickly eliminating the provinces to the far east (New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador) is a crucial step to focus the analysis on the correct geographical area.\n*   **Land vs. Water:** The comparison comes down to a short overland distance to the Ontario border versus a longer over-water distance to the nearest Nunavut island.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy analyzing the geographical location of Waskaganish relative to its surrounding provinces and territories, it is clear that the land border of Ontario is closer than any part of Nunavut, New Brunswick, or Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
