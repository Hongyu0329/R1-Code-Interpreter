    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific paper:** The question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The official title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). This was one of his four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers.\n\n2.  **Examine the paper for citations:** A key feature of Einstein's 1905 papers is their style. They were derived largely from first principles and are famous for their lack of extensive references or bibliographies. A direct examination of the Brownian motion paper confirms that it contains no formal list of citations or footnotes referring to other scientists' work. Therefore, strictly and literally, Einstein did not cite anyone's lectures *within the text of that specific paper*.\n\n3.  **Consider the broader academic context:** This lack of citation in the paper can be misleading. The research for the Brownian motion paper was intimately connected to Einstein's PhD dissertation, \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"), which he also completed in 1905. The dissertation served as the foundational work for the paper and, as a formal academic thesis, it did contain a bibliography.\n\n4.  **Examine the dissertation's bibliography:** In the bibliography of his 1905 PhD dissertation, Einstein cited the works of several physicists. The question specifically asks about \"lectures.\"\n\n5.  **Identify the relevant cited work:** Among the scientists cited in the dissertation is the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**. Boltzmann was the principal founder of statistical mechanics, the very theory that Einstein's paper relied upon (as stated in its title: \"the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). Boltzmann's seminal work on this topic was published as a two-volume book titled **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"** (1896-1898), which translates to **\"Lectures on Gas Theory.\"**\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Paper vs. Dissertation:** It is crucial to distinguish between the *paper* published in the journal *Annalen der Physik* and the *PhD dissertation* submitted to the University of Zurich. The paper itself lacks citations, but the underlying dissertation does not. The question is almost certainly referring to the intellectual foundations of the paper, which are formally acknowledged in the dissertation.\n*   **Meaning of \"Lectures\":** The term \"lectures\" does not refer to classroom lectures that Einstein attended (he did not study under Boltzmann). It refers to the title of Boltzmann's published book, a common practice for academic texts in that era (e.g., Feynman's *Lectures on Physics*).\n*   **Influence vs. Citation:** While Einstein was influenced by many, the question asks who he *cited*. The formal citation of Boltzmann's \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" appears in the dissertation that underpins the famous paper.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWhile Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion itself does not contain a bibliography, his closely related PhD dissertation of the same year does. In that dissertation, he cited the foundational work on statistical mechanics by Ludwig Boltzmann, which was published under the title \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" (*Vorlesungen über Gastheorie*).\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann"
