    "This is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided code.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Programming Problem\n\n1.  **Objective**: Calculate the final value of a variable `x` which starts at 0.\n2.  **Operations**: There are two operations:\n    *   `++`: Increments `x` by 1.\n    *   `--`: Decrements `x` by 1.\n3.  **Statements**: A statement consists of one operation (`++` or `--`) and the variable `X`.\n4.  **Important Rule**: The problem states, \"The operation and the variable can be written in any order.\" This means we need to handle four possible statement formats:\n    *   `++X` (pre-increment)\n    *   `X++` (post-increment)\n    *   `--X` (pre-decrement)\n    *   `X--` (post-decrement)\n    In this problem, the distinction between pre- and post-increment/decrement does not affect the final result, as each statement is executed in isolation. Both `++X` and `X++` simply result in `x` being incremented by 1. Similarly, both `--X` and `X--` result in `x` being decremented by 1.\n5.  **Input**:\n    *   An integer `n`, the number of statements.\n    *   `n` lines, each containing one of the four possible statements.\n6.  **Output**: The final integer value of `x`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Submitted Java Program\n\n1.  **Initialization**: `int tresult = 0;` correctly initializes the counter variable (representing `x`) to zero.\n2.  **Input Reading**: It correctly reads the number of statements `t` and then loops `t` times, reading each statement into a `String` variable `test`.\n3.  **Core Logic Flaw**: The program uses two separate `if` conditions to check the statement:\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"++X\"))`\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"--X\"))`\n    The `String.contains()` method checks if the given substring exists within the string.\n    *   `\"X++\".contains(\"++X\")` is `false`.\n    *   `\"X--\".contains(\"--X\")` is `false`.\n    The program correctly handles `++X` and `--X` but completely ignores the `X++` and `X--` cases. Therefore, the program will produce the wrong answer if the input contains statements like `X++` or `X--`.\n4.  **Conclusion**: The program does not solve the problem correctly for all valid inputs. The answer must start with \"N\".\n\n### Step 3: Design an Efficient and Correct C Program\n\nTo fix the issue and make the program efficient, we need a reliable way to determine whether to increment or decrement.\n\n1.  **Observation**: All four possible statements (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`) are three characters long. The character at the middle position (index 1) is always part of the operator (`+` or `-`).\n    *   For `++X` and `X++`, the character at index 1 is `+`.\n    *   For `--X` and `X--`, the character at index 1 is `-`.\n2.  **Efficient Logic**: We can read each statement and check only the middle character. If it's a `+`, we increment our counter. If it's a `-` (which is the only other possibility), we decrement. This avoids complex string comparisons.\n3.  **Memory Optimization**: To minimize memory, we should avoid large data structures.\n    *   We need one integer for the loop counter `n` and one for the result `x`. (`sizeof(int)` is typically 4 bytes).\n    *   To read the input statement, we don't need to store the whole string in a buffer if we can process it character by character. However, a minimal approach using `scanf` would be to read the three characters of the statement into three `char` variables.\n4.  **Proposed C Implementation Sketch**:\n    ```c\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    \n    int main() {\n        int n;\n        int x = 0;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &n); // Read the number of statements\n    \n        while (n--) {\n            char s[4]; // Buffer for \"++X\" + null terminator\n            scanf(\"%s\", s); // Read the statement\n            if (s[1] == '+') {\n                x++;\n            } else {\n                x--;\n            }\n        }\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n        return 0;\n    }\n    ```\n\n### Step 4: Efficiency Analysis (for n=100)\n\nThe question asks for the `smallest` number of character comparisons (`x`) and the `smallest` memory size (`y`). We will analyze our proposed efficient C logic.\n\n1.  **Character Comparisons (`x`)**:\n    *   The core logic is `if (s[1] == '+')`. This is exactly **one character comparison** per statement.\n    *   `scanf` also performs comparisons internally, but the question refers to the comparisons made by the program's logic to decide the operation. The minimum logical work required is one comparison.\n    *   For `n = 100` statements, the total number of comparisons is `100 * 1 = 100`.\n    *   Thus, **`x = 100`**.\n\n2.  **Memory Size (`y`)**:\n    *   We need to declare variables to store the state. Let's find the minimum set of variables needed.\n        *   `int n;` // Stores the number of statements. `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n        *   `int x;` // Stores the result. `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes.\n        *   To read the input `X++`, etc., we need to read the characters. The most memory-efficient way that is also simple is to read into three character variables, avoiding a larger string buffer.\n        *   `char c1, c2, c3;` // To read the 3 characters of the statement. `3 * sizeof(char)` = `3 * 1` = 3 bytes. We would use a format string like `scanf(\" %c%c%c\", &c1, &c2, &c3);` and then check `c2`.\n    *   Total minimum memory for variables on the stack: `4 (for n) + 4 (for x) + 3 (for chars) = 11` bytes.\n    *   Thus, **`y = 11`**.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\n*   Does the program solve the problem? **No**.\n*   The answer format is `Nx+y`.\n*   `x` = 100 (character comparisons)\n*   `y` = 11 (memory in Bytes)\n*   Final string: `N100+11`\n\n<<<N100+11>>>"
