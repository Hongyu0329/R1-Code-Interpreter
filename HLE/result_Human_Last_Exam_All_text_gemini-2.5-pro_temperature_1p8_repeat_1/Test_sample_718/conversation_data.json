    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Terminology**\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice (J):** An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements have a least upper bound (also called a supremum or join). We can view this poset `J` as a category where the objects are the elements of `J`, and there is a unique morphism from `j` to `k` (written `j \\to k`) if and only if `j \\le k`.\n*   **Vect_K:** This is the category of vector spaces over a field `K`. The objects are `K`-vector spaces, and the morphisms are `K`-linear maps.\n*   **Functor f: J -> Vect_K:** Such a functor is a representation of the poset `J`. It assigns a vector space `f(j)` to each element `j \\in J` and a linear map `f(j \\to k): f(j) \\to f(k)` for every pair `j, k` with `j \\le k`. These maps must respect composition, i.e., `f(k \\to l) \\circ f(j \\to k) = f(j \\to l)` whenever `j \\le k \\le l`.\n*   **Modules over the Path Algebra:** A representation `f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K` is equivalent to a module over the path algebra `KJ`. The algebra `KJ` is constructed from the category `J`. Its elements are formal `K`-linear combinations of paths (morphisms) in `J`. A module `M` over `KJ` consists of a collection of vector spaces `M_j` for each object `j \\in J`, with linear maps acting on them corresponding to the morphisms in `J`. This is exactly the structure of our functor `f`.\n*   **n-resolvable:** An object `M` in an abelian category with enough projectives (like the category of `KJ`-modules) is said to be `n`-resolvable if there exists a projective resolution of `M` of length `n`. That is, there is an exact sequence:\n    $$P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$$\n    where each `P_i` is a projective module. This property is equivalent to saying that the projective dimension of `M`, denoted `pd(M)`, is at most `n`.\n*   **Tame Functor:** In representation theory, algebras (and their module categories) are classified into finite, tame, and wild representation types. A \"tame\" algebra is one where the indecomposable modules in any given dimension `d` can be classified and fall into a finite number of one-parameter families. A \"tame functor\" is a module `f` over an algebra `KJ` that is of tame representation type. However, we will see that the homological property we are looking for is determined by the structure of `J` itself, independent of the representation type.\n\n**2. Connecting the Concepts**\n\nThe question asks for a single integer `n` such that *any* tame functor `f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K` is `n`-resolvable. This means we are looking for a uniform upper bound on the projective dimension of all such modules `f`. The tightest such uniform bound for *all* modules over an algebra `A` is the global dimension of `A`, denoted `gldim(A)`.\n\nSo, the problem boils down to finding the global dimension of the path algebra `KJ` when `J` is an upper semilattice.\n\n**3. The Key Homological Result**\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem in the representation theory of posets that connects the combinatorial structure of the poset `J` to the homological properties of its path algebra `KJ`.\n\n**Theorem:** For a finite poset `J`, the global dimension of its path algebra `KJ` satisfies `gldim(KJ) \\le 2` if and only if `J` is an upper semilattice.\n\n**4. Sketch of Justification**\n\n*   The global dimension of an algebra is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all simple modules. Let's consider a simple module `S_j` corresponding to an element `j \\in J`. This module has `S_j(j) = K` and `S_j(k) = 0` for `k \\ne j`. We want to show `pd(S_j) \\le 2`.\n\n*   **First step of resolution:** The projective cover of `S_j` is the indecomposable projective module `P_j`. `P_j(k)` is a 1-dimensional space spanned by the unique path `j \\to k` if `j \\le k`, and `0` otherwise. The kernel of the projection `P_j \\to S_j` is the radical of `P_j`, denoted `rad(P_j)`. This gives the exact sequence:\n    $$0 \\to \\text{rad}(P_j) \\to P_j \\to S_j \\to 0$$\n    This is the first syzygy, `\\Omega(S_j) \\cong \\text{rad}(P_j)`. To show `pd(S_j) \\le 2`, we need to show `pd(\\text{rad}(P_j)) \\le 1`, which means `\\Omega^2(S_j)` must be projective.\n\n*   **Second step of resolution:** We now need to find a projective cover for `rad(P_j)`. Let `C_j` be the set of elements that \"cover\" `j` (i.e., the minimal elements in the set `{k \\in J | k > j\\}`). There is a natural surjective map from the projective module `\\bigoplus_{c \\in C_j} P_c` onto `rad(P_j)`.\n\n*   **The kernel:** The kernel of this map describes the relations between the paths starting from `j`. For any two covers `c_1, c_2 \\in C_j`, we have paths from `j` to `c_1` and `j` to `c_2`. The **upper semilattice** property guarantees that the join `l = c_1 \\vee c_2` exists. In the poset `J`, the path `j \\to c_1 \\to \\dots \\to l` is the same as the path `j \\to c_2 \\to \\dots \\to l`, as there is a unique morphism `j \\to l`. This gives a relation. It can be shown that the kernel is generated by these types of relations, and crucially, that this kernel is itself a projective module. It is a direct sum of projective modules of the form `P_{c_1 \\vee c_2}`.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the kernel `\\Omega^2(S_j)` is projective, the projective resolution of `S_j` terminates after at most two steps. Thus, `pd(S_j) \\le 2`. Since this holds for all simple modules, `gldim(KJ) \\le 2`.\n\n**5. Careful Points and Final Answer**\n\n*   **Is the bound sharp?** Yes, the bound is sharp. We can construct an upper semilattice `J` for which `gldim(KJ) = 2`. For example, let `J = \\{a, b_1, b_2, c\\}` with relations `a < b_1 < c` and `a < b_2 < c`, with `b_1` and `b_2` being incomparable. This is an upper semilattice (e.g., `b_1 \\vee b_2 = c`). For this poset, the simple module `S_a` has `pd(S_a) = 2`. Therefore, a general bound for any upper semilattice must be `n=2`.\n*   **Role of \"Tame Functor\":** The condition that `J` is an upper semilattice is a structural property that implies `gldim(KJ) \\le 2`. This bound holds for *all* `KJ`-modules, regardless of whether `KJ` is of tame or wild representation type. Therefore, it certainly holds for any \"tame functor\". The \"tame\" condition is a red herring in the sense that a stronger property of the algebra already gives us the answer.\n*   **Final deduction:** Since the global dimension of the path algebra `KJ` is at most 2, any module `f` over this algebra must have a projective dimension `pd(f) \\le 2`. This is precisely the definition of being 2-resolvable.\n\nThe functor `f` is `n`-resolvable for `n=2`.\n\n>>>2"
