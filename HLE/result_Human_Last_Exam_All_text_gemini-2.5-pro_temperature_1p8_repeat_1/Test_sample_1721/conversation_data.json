    "An analysis of the question step by step is as follows:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem Definition**\n\nWe are looking for the largest possible density $c$ for a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, ..., N\\}$ such that the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 \\mid a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect squares. The size of the set $A$ is given by $|A| = (c+o(1))N$, which means we want to maximize the limiting ratio $\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{|A|}{N}$.\n\n**Step 2: Construct a Candidate Set A (Lower Bound for c)**\n\nA common and powerful technique for such problems is to use modular arithmetic. We try to construct the set $A$ by selecting numbers from specific residue classes modulo some integer $m$.\n\n*   **The Idea:** If we can make all sums $a_1 + a_2$ fall into a residue class modulo $m$ that contains no perfect squares, then our condition is satisfied.\n*   **Let's test $m=3$:** The possible remainders when a square is divided by 3 are $0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, $1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, and $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. So, any perfect square must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. It can never be congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n*   **The Construction:** This suggests we can construct a set $A$ where every sum $a_1+a_2$ is congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n    *   Let's choose $A$ to be the set of all numbers in $\\{1, ..., N\\}$ that are congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n        $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\n    *   Let $a_1, a_2$ be any two elements in $A$. By definition, $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n    *   Their sum is $a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 1 + 1 = 2 \\pmod 3$.\n    *   Since no perfect square can be congruent to 2 modulo 3, $a_1+a_2$ can never be a perfect square. Thus, the set $A+A$ contains no squares.\n*   **Calculate the Density:** The elements of $A$ are $1, 4, 7, 10, ...$. The number of such elements up to $N$ is approximately $N/3$. More precisely, $|A| = \\lfloor\\frac{N-1}{3}\\rfloor + 1$. As $N \\to \\infty$, the ratio $|A|/N$ approaches $1/3$.\n*   **Conclusion for Lower Bound:** This construction shows that a density of $c=1/3$ is achievable. Therefore, the maximum possible value of $c$ must be at least $1/3$.\n\n**Step 3: Consider Other Constructions**\n\nWe should check if other moduli can yield a better density.\n\n*   **Let's test $m=4$:** The squares modulo 4 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$ and $1^2 \\equiv 1$. Squares of even numbers are $0 \\pmod 4$ and squares of odd numbers are $1 \\pmod 4$. So squares can only be 0 or 1 modulo 4. The residue classes $2 \\pmod 4$ and $3 \\pmod 4$ contain no squares.\n    *   If we take $A = \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\}$, then $A+A \\subseteq \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4\\}$, which is square-free. The density is $1/4$.\n    *   If we take $A = \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4\\}$, then $A+A \\subseteq \\{n \\mid n \\equiv 6 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4\\}$, which is square-free. The density is $1/4$.\n    *   We cannot combine these, for instance, by taking $A=\\{n \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\text{ or } 3 \\pmod 4\\}$. A counterexample would be $1 \\in A$ and $3 \\in A$, and their sum is $1+3=4$, which is a square.\n*   **Using multiple moduli (Chinese Remainder Theorem):** We can combine conditions. For example, using $m=12$ (lcm of 3 and 4), we can demand that for $j_1, j_2 \\in J$, the sum $j_1+j_2$ modulo 12 lands in a residue class that is square-free (e.g., $r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$ or $r \\equiv 2,3 \\pmod 4$). The set of square-free residues mod 12 is $\\{2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11\\}$. Systematic exploration of subsets $J$ of $\\{0, ..., 11\\}$ such that $J+J$ is a subset of these square-free residues shows that the maximal density one can achieve this way is $1/4$ (e.g., with $J=\\{1,5,9\\}$).\n\nThese explorations suggest that the $c=1/3$ obtained from the modulo 3 construction is likely the maximum.\n\n**Step 4: Establish the Upper Bound for c**\n\nProving that $c$ cannot be larger than $1/3$ is the more challenging part of the problem. This is a known result in combinatorial number theory.\n\n*   The problem was completely solved by Komlos, Sulyok, and Szemeredi in 1975. They proved that if $A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}$ is such that $A+A$ contains no squares, then $|A| \\le N/3 + o(N)$.\n*   The proof is advanced and uses methods from analytic number theory, similar to those used in Roth's theorem on arithmetic progressions (e.g., Fourier analysis on finite groups, or the Hardy-Littlewood circle method).\n*   A heuristic argument: If $|A| > N/3$, then $A$ would need to occupy a significant portion of more than one residue class modulo 3. Let $A_i = \\{a \\in A \\mid a \\equiv i \\pmod 3\\}$. Then $|A| = |A_0|+|A_1|+|A_2|$.\n    *   Sums from $A_1+A_1$ are \"safe\" (they are all $2 \\pmod 3$).\n    *   Sums from $A_0+A_2$ are also \"safe\" (they are all $2 \\pmod 3$).\n    *   However, sums from $A_0+A_0$ (sums are $0 \\pmod 3$), $A_2+A_2$ (sums are $1 \\pmod 3$), $A_0+A_1$ (sums are $1 \\pmod 3$), and $A_1+A_2$ (sums are $0 \\pmod 3$) are \"dangerous\" because these residue classes contain squares.\n    *   If the sizes of $A_0$ or $A_2$ are significant, a large number of sums are generated that fall into these \"dangerous\" residue classes. The proof formalizes the argument that it becomes impossible to avoid all squares if $|A|$ is too large.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n1.  We have constructed a set $A$ with density $c = 1/3$ that satisfies the given condition. This means the maximum possible $c$ is at least $1/3$.\n2.  A non-trivial theorem proves that the density cannot exceed $1/3$.\n3.  Combining these two results, the largest possible value for $c$ is exactly $1/3$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation Summary:\n- Lower bound: $c \\ge 1/3$ from the set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1,...,N\\} : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\n- Upper bound: $c \\le 1/3$ from the theorem by Komlos, Sulyok, Szemeredi.\n- Therefore, $c = 1/3$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
