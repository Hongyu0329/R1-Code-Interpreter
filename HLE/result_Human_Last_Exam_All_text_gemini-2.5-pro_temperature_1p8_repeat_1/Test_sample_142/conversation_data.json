    "This problem requires finding the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation. Let's break down the problem into clear steps.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Molecular System and Calculation Parameters**\n\n*   **Molecule:** $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. The exact 3D structure (isomer, geometry) is irrelevant for a Full CI calculation, as it only depends on the atom count, number of electrons, and basis set size.\n*   **Method:** Full Configuration Interaction (Full CI). This means all possible electron configurations will be included.\n*   **Basis Set:** 6-31G**. This is a Pople-style split-valence basis set with polarization functions. The `**` (or (d,p)) notation indicates that d-type polarization functions are added to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms, and p-type polarization functions are added to hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Target:** The number of CSFs. For a closed-shell molecule like this, the ground state is a singlet state (total spin S=0).\n\n**2. Determine the Total Number of Electrons (N)**\n\nWe sum the number of electrons for each atom in the molecule.\n*   Carbon (C): 1 atom × 6 electrons/atom = 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 3 atoms × 1 electron/atom = 3 electrons\n*   Silicon (Si): 1 atom × 14 electrons/atom = 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 1 atom × 9 electrons/atom = 9 electrons\n\nTotal number of electrons, N = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = **32**.\n\n**3. Determine the Total Number of Basis Functions (Spatial Orbitals, K)**\n\nWe need to count the number of atomic orbital basis functions for each atom with the 6-31G** basis set.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The 1s orbital is split into two functions by the 6-31G basis (2 functions). The `**` adds a set of three p-functions (px, py, pz).\n    *   Functions per H atom = 2 (s) + 3 (p) = 5.\n    *   For 3 H atoms: 3 × 5 = 15 functions.\n\n*   **Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F) (2nd-row heavy atoms):**\n    *   Core 1s orbital: 1 function.\n    *   Valence 2s and 2p orbitals (split): an inner set (s, px, py, pz) and an outer set (s, px, py, pz), for a total of 4 + 4 = 8 functions.\n    *   Polarization d-functions (`**`): one set of six Cartesian d-functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   Functions per C or F atom = 1 (core) + 8 (valence) + 6 (pol) = 15.\n    *   For 1 C and 1 F atom: 15 + 15 = 30 functions.\n\n*   **Silicon (Si) (3rd-row heavy atom):**\n    *   Core 1s, 2s, 2p orbitals: 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 functions.\n    *   Valence 3s and 3p orbitals (split): an inner set (s, p) and an outer set (s, p), for a total of 4 + 4 = 8 functions.\n    *   Polarization d-functions (`**`): one set of six Cartesian d-functions.\n    *   Functions per Si atom = 5 (core) + 8 (valence) + 6 (pol) = 19.\n    *   For 1 Si atom: 19 functions.\n\nTotal number of basis functions, K = 15 (for 3H) + 15 (for C) + 15 (for F) + 19 (for Si) = **64**.\n\n**4. Use the Formula for the Number of CSFs**\n\nThe number of CSFs for a singlet state (S=0) with N electrons in K spatial orbitals is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{Number of CSFs} = \\binom{K}{n}^2 - \\binom{K}{n-1}\\binom{K}{n+1} $$\nwhere $n = N/2$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Number**\n\nNow, we substitute our calculated values into the formula.\n\n*   N = 32, so n = N/2 = 16.\n*   K = 64.\n\nNumber of CSFs = $ \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15}\\binom{64}{17} $\n\nThis calculation involves very large numbers, which reflects the fact that a Full CI calculation for a system of this size is computationally impossible with current technology (a concept known as the \"exponential wall\"). However, the question asks for this theoretical number.\n\nLet's compute the binomial coefficients:\n*   $ \\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16! \\cdot (64-16)!} = \\frac{64!}{16! \\cdot 48!} = 66,334,033,379,203,600 $\n*   $ \\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15! \\cdot (64-15)!} = \\frac{64!}{15! \\cdot 49!} = 21,749,355,447,601,175 $\n*   $ \\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17! \\cdot (64-17)!} = \\frac{64!}{17! \\cdot 47!} = 156,079,960,892,243,760 $\n\nNow, we perform the final subtraction:\n*   $ \\binom{64}{16}^2 = (66,334,033,379,203,600)^2 = 4,399,998,182,234,030,676,641,883,136,000 $\n*   $ \\binom{64}{15} \\times \\binom{64}{17} = (21,749,355,447,601,175) \\times (156,079,960,892,243,760) = 3,394,853,755,446,050,519,965,042,464,000 $\n\nNumber of CSFs = $ 4,399,998,182,234,030,676,641,883,136,000 - 3,394,853,755,446,050,519,965,042,464,000 $\nNumber of CSFs = $ 1,005,144,426,787,980,156,676,840,672,000 $\n\n<<<1005144426787980156676840672000>>>"
