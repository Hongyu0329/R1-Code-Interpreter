    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Action:** A character visits a Roman city.\n    *   **Content of Action:** The character describes the religious practices of the Romans.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The description contains a clear allusion that readers would recognize as the story of Romulus and Remus, the legendary founders of Rome.\n\n2.  **Recall the Plot and Characters:**\n    *   The novel is a fantasy prose and verse romance about a tribe of Goths, the \"Wolfings,\" who are defending their lands against the Roman legions.\n    *   The main characters include Thiodolf (the war-leader), the Hall-Sun (his wife, a supernatural being), and their kinsmen.\n    *   The story requires a character who has traveled to Roman territory and returned to tell the tale. We need to identify this specific character.\n\n3.  **Identify the Character who Travels:**\n    *   In the early part of the book, news and tidings are brought to the Wolfing hall.\n    *   A specific kinsman, known as a traveler, returns from Roman lands and reports on what he has seen. This character is **Eyolf the Red**.\n\n4.  **Locate the Relevant Passage:**\n    *   In Chapter III, titled \"The Tidings of the Wolfing-Kinsmen,\" Eyolf the Red recounts his journey. He describes a Roman city he visited.\n    *   He speaks of the Romans' temples and their ways, providing intelligence to the Goths about their enemy.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Description for the Allusion:**\n    *   The myth of Romulus and Remus centers on twin infants abandoned and then suckled by a she-wolf. The iconic image is the Capitoline Wolf (Lupa Capitolina) sculpture.\n    *   During his report, Eyolf the Red describes seeing a famous work of art in a Roman temple. He specifically mentions seeing a bronze image of **a she-wolf giving suck to two male children**.\n    *   He does not name them \"Romulus\" and \"Remus,\" but the description is unmistakable to any reader familiar with the Roman founding myth. Eyolf, being a Goth from the \"House of the Wolfings,\" finds this Roman veneration of a wolf-mother particularly strange and significant.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:**\n    *   The character who traveled to a Roman city is Eyolf the Red.\n    *   He is the one who describes the religious/foundational imagery he saw there.\n    *   His description of a she-wolf nursing two infants is a direct and recognizable reference to the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Allusion vs. Direct Naming:** The question correctly notes that the description allows readers to \"recognize\" the reference. Eyolf doesn't know the names Romulus and Remus; he just describes the scene, making it a classic example of an allusion.\n*   **Character Perspective:** The power of the scene comes from Eyolf's perspective as a \"Wolfing.\" For his people, the wolf is an ancestral totem. Seeing their enemies, the Romans, using a similar (but different) wolf symbol is a point of confusion and thematic irony.\n*   **Plot Significance:** This report by Eyolf in Chapter III is crucial. It serves as world-building, establishes the cultural divide between the Goths and Romans, and provides the immediate context for the impending war that drives the rest of the novel.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the character who fits all the criteria in the question is Eyolf the Red.\n\n<<<Eyolf the Red>>>"
