    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and a natural number `m`.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, we need to understand the key terms used in the question.\n\n*   **Product-Free Set (PFS):** A non-empty subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for all elements `a, b` in `S` (including the case `a=b`), the product `ab` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S^2 \\cap S = \\emptyset`. An immediate consequence is that the identity element `e` can never be in a product-free set, as `e \\cdot e = e`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MPFS):** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means that for any element `g` in `G \\setminus S`, the set `S \\cup \\{g\\}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **A Set that Fills a Group:** A subset `S` of `G` fills `G` if the set of all products of pairs of elements from `S` is equal to the entire group `G`. That is, `S \\cdot S = \\{ab \\mid a, b \\in S\\} = G`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called a filled group if *every* maximal by inclusion product-free set in `G` fills `G`.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a More Tractable Characterization\n\nThe direct definition of a filled group is difficult to work with. Fortunately, there is a more accessible equivalent condition, a characterization proved by G. L. Walls:\n\n**Characterization Theorem:** A finite group `G` is filled if and only if for every proper subgroup `H` of `G` (i.e., `H < G`), there exists an element `g \\in G \\setminus H` such that `g^2 \\in H`.\n\nWe will use this characterization to analyze the groups of order `2q^m`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Structure of Groups of Order `2q^m`\n\nLet `G` be a group of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m \\ge 1`.\n\n*   By Sylow's Theorems, let `n_q` be the number of Sylow `q`-subgroups. We know that `n_q \\equiv 1 \\pmod q` and `n_q` divides the order of the group, so `n_q` divides `2q^m`. This means `n_q` can be 1 or 2.\n*   If `n_q=2`, then `2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod q`, which implies `q` divides `2-1=1`, impossible as `q` is an odd prime.\n*   Therefore, `n_q` must be 1. This means there is a unique Sylow `q`-subgroup, which we will call `Q`. A unique Sylow subgroup is always a normal subgroup. So, `Q \\trianglelefteq G` and `|Q| = q^m`.\n\nLet `P` be a Sylow 2-subgroup. `|P|=2`. So `P \\cong C_2`.\nSince `G` has a normal subgroup `Q` and a subgroup `P` such that `|Q| \\cdot |P| = |G|` and `Q \\cap P = \\{e\\}`, `G` is a semidirect product:\n`G = Q \\rtimes P \\cong Q \\rtimes_{\\alpha} C_2`.\n\nThe group `G` is nonabelian if and only if the homomorphism `\\alpha: C_2 \\to \\text{Aut}(Q)` is non-trivial. Let `P=<y|y^2=e>`. The action is an automorphism `\\alpha_y: Q \\to Q` given by `q \\mapsto yqy^{-1}`. This automorphism `\\alpha_y` must have order 2 (since `y^2=e`).\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Characterization to the Group Structure\n\nWe now need to find which of these semidirect products `G = Q \\rtimes_{\\alpha} C_2` are filled. The problem can be divided into two cases based on the structure of `Q`.\n\n**Case 1: Q is a nonabelian group.**\nIn this case, the analysis becomes quite technical. It requires constructing a specific subgroup `H` and showing that the condition `\\exists g \\in G \\setminus H` with `g^2 \\in H` fails. This involves deep results about the automorphism groups of nonabelian `q`-groups. A known result (from the solution to Problem 11322 in the American Mathematical Monthly, relying on work by G.L. Walls) establishes that if the subgroup of odd order `Q` is nonabelian, the group `G` cannot be filled. We will accept this result without a full proof, as its proof is beyond the scope of this step-by-step analysis.\n\n**Case 2: Q is an abelian group.**\nHere, `Q` is an abelian group of order `q^m`. Since `G` is nonabelian, the action `\\alpha` must be non-trivial.\nFor this class of groups (a nonabelian group with an abelian normal subgroup of odd order and index 2), another powerful theorem from G.L. Walls applies:\n\n**Theorem:** Let `G` be a finite group containing an abelian normal subgroup `A` of odd order with index 2. Then `G` is a filled group if and only if `G \\cong \\text{Dih}(A)`.\n\nThe group `\\text{Dih}(A)` is the **generalized dihedral group** over `A`. It is the semidirect product `A \\rtimes C_2` where the non-identity element of `C_2` acts on `A` as the **inversion automorphism**, i.e., `a \\mapsto a^{-1}` for all `a \\in A`.\n\nLet's verify this makes sense.\n*   Is the inversion map `a \\mapsto a^{-1}` an automorphism?\n    For it to be a homomorphism from `A` to `A`, we need `(ab)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}`. Since `A` is abelian, `(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1}`. So yes, it is an automorphism for any abelian group `A`.\n*   Our `Q` is an abelian group of order `q^m` (`q` odd), which satisfies the conditions of the theorem (playing the role of `A`).\n*   Thus, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are precisely these generalized dihedral groups.\n\nThe group `Q` can be any abelian group of order `q^m`. By the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, `Q` is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic `q`-groups: `Q \\cong C_{q^{e_1}} \\times C_{q^{e_2}} \\times \\dots \\times C_{q^{e_k}}`, where `e_1+e_2+\\dots+e_k=m`.\n\nFor example, if `m=1`, `Q \\cong C_q`. The resulting filled group is `Dih(C_q)`, which is the standard dihedral group `D_{2q}` of order `2q`.\nIf `m=2`, `Q` can be `C_{q^2}` or `C_q \\times C_q`. Both `Dih(C_{q^2})` and `Dih(C_q \\times C_q)` are nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^2`.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the analysis from all steps, the nonabelian filled groups `G` of order `2q^m` are those where the normal Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` is abelian, and the Sylow 2-subgroup acts on `Q` by inversion. These groups are known as generalized dihedral groups.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the **generalized dihedral groups `Dih(A)`**, where `A` is any abelian group of order `q^m`.\nStructurally, these are groups `G = A \\rtimes C_2 = A \\rtimes <y | y^2=e>` where the action is defined by `yay^{-1} = a^{-1}` for all `a \\in A`.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, are the generalized dihedral groups `Dih(A)`, where `A` is any abelian group of order `q^m`. These groups are semidirect products `A \\rtimes C_2` where the generator of `C_2` acts on `A` via the inversion automorphism `a \\mapsto a^{-1}`.>>>"
