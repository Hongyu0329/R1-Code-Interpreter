The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, are the generalized dihedral groups `Dih(A)`, where `A` is any abelian group of order `q^m`. These groups are semidirect products `A \rtimes C_2` where the generator of `C_2` acts on `A` via the inversion automorphism `a \mapsto a^{-1}`.
