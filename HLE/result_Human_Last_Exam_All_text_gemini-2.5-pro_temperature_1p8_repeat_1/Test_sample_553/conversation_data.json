    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Musical Terminology**\n\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the first chord in the scale, denoted by the Roman numeral `I` in a major key (e.g., C major in the key of C) or `i` in a minor key (e.g., A minor in the key of A minor).\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord:** This is a minor chord built on the fifth degree of the scale.\n    *   In a **minor key**, this is a very natural and common chord. For example, in the key of A minor, the fifth note is E, and the naturally occurring chord is an E minor. This is denoted as the `v` chord. The progression would be `i` -> `v`.\n    *   In a **major key**, using a minor fifth chord is less common and is considered a \"borrowed\" chord. For example, in the key of C major, the fifth note is G. The standard chord is G major (`V`). A G minor chord (`v`) would be borrowed from the parallel key of C minor. This progression would be `I` -> `v`.\n*   **Starts with a chord jump:** This means the progression happens right at the beginning of the song, forming the opening musical statement.\n\n**Step 2: Search for Potential Songs**\n\nWe are looking for a Beatles song that starts with a `i -> v` or `I -> v` progression. The `i -> v` (minor key) progression is more likely. We need to analyze the opening chords of Beatles songs, particularly those in minor keys.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Candidates**\n\n*   **Candidate 1: \"And I Love Her\"**\n    *   This song is in the key of F-sharp minor (some sheet music shows E minor, but the recorded version is F# minor).\n    *   The tonic (`i`) chord is F-sharp minor (F#m).\n    *   The fifth degree is C-sharp, and the minor fifth (`v`) chord is C-sharp minor (C#m).\n    *   The verse progression begins by moving from F#m to C#m. This fits the `i -> v` pattern. The song starts with its famous guitar riff, and the verse immediately follows with this progression. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: \"Things We Said Today\"**\n    *   This song is in the key of A minor.\n    *   The tonic (`i`) chord is A minor (Am).\n    *   The fifth degree is E, and the minor fifth (`v`) chord is E minor (Em).\n    *   The song *starts* with a powerful, repeated strum of just the tonic chord, Am. This clearly establishes the key's home base.\n    *   As soon as the verse begins (\"You say you will love me...\"), the harmony immediately moves from that established A minor chord to an E minor chord (\"...if I have to go...\").\n    *   This perfectly matches the description: the song starts on the tonic, and the very first harmonic movement is a \"jump\" to the minor fifth chord (`i -> v`).\n\n**Step 4: Select the Best Answer**\n\nBoth \"And I Love Her\" and \"Things We Said Today\" feature the `i -> v` progression at the beginning. However, \"Things We Said Today\" is arguably a more textbook example of the prompt's wording. Its intro consists *only* of the tonic chord, making the subsequent change to the minor fifth a very distinct and noticeable \"jump\" that kicks off the song's main theme. For this reason, it is the most cited answer for this specific harmonic movement in The Beatles' catalog.\n\n<<<Things We Said Today>>>"
