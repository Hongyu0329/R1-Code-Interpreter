    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Recognition Motif:** The question asks to identify a peptide that binds to an integrin receptor. All the provided answer choices are peptides that contain the three-amino-acid sequence **RGD** (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid). The RGD sequence is the most well-known and widely studied recognition motif for a large family of integrin receptors. Integrins bind to this sequence found in various extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as fibronectin, vitronectin, and laminin.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Role of Flanking Residues:** Since all peptides contain the essential RGD core, the difference in their ability to bind an integrin receptor will be determined by the amino acids flanking this core sequence. These flanking residues, particularly those C-terminal to the RGD motif, are crucial. They influence the peptide's overall three-dimensional conformation and provide additional contact points with the integrin, thereby modulating both the binding affinity (how strongly it binds) and specificity (which type of integrin it binds to).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Known Natural Ligand Sequences:** To determine which peptide is most likely to be an effective integrin binder, we should compare the choices to known RGD sequences from natural integrin ligands.\n    *   **Fibronectin:** A major ECM protein and a primary ligand for many integrins (e.g., α5β1, αvβ3). The cell-binding domain of fibronectin contains the sequence `...GRGDSP...`. The `RGDSP` portion is widely recognized as a high-affinity binding site.\n    *   **Vitronectin:** Another ECM protein that binds integrins (e.g., αvβ3) contains the sequence `...GRGDSPASS...`. Again, we see the `RGDSP` sequence.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n    *   **A. RGDMAA:** The flanking sequence `MAA` (Methionine-Alanine-Alanine) does not correspond to a classic high-affinity integrin binding motif found in major ECM proteins.\n    *   **B. RGDSPSS:** This peptide contains the `RGDSP` sequence, which is the exact motif found in the natural ligand fibronectin. The `SP` (Serine-Proline) dipeptide immediately following RGD is known to help induce a specific type of turn (β-turn) in the peptide backbone. This conformation is optimal for presenting the Arginine and Aspartic acid side chains in the correct orientation to fit into the integrin binding pocket. Because it contains this well-established canonical binding motif, this peptide is highly likely to bind integrins effectively. In fact, peptides like RGDSP are commonly synthesized and used in *in vitro* assays to study integrin function.\n    *   **C. RGDLTTP:** The `LTTP` (Leucine-Threonine-Threonine-Proline) sequence is not a well-known motif for enhancing RGD-mediated integrin binding.\n    *   **D. RGDQVSK:** The `QVSK` (Glutamine-Valine-Serine-Lysine) sequence does not match the canonical motifs from fibronectin or vitronectin. While `RGDV` is a known motif (from osteopontin), the overall sequence `RGDQVSK` is not a standard high-affinity ligand.\n    *   **E. RGDARGG:** The `ARGG` (Alanine-Arginine-Glycine-Glycine) sequence is also not a classic high-affinity binding sequence.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The peptide `RGDSPSS` contains the `RGDSP` core, which is the archetypal binding sequence from fibronectin. Due to the extensive research demonstrating the high-affinity binding of `RGDSP`-containing peptides to integrins in numerous *in vitro* assays, this option is the most scientifically sound choice. It has either been directly confirmed to bind or is so similar to confirmed binders that it is highly likely to do so.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The question focuses on binding in an *in vitro* assay, where synthetic peptides based on natural ligands are commonly used.\n*   The presence of the `SP` dipeptide C-terminal to `RGD` is a strong indicator of a conformation favorable for binding to several integrins, particularly the fibronectin receptor α5β1.\n*   While other sequences *might* show some binding, the `RGDSP` motif is the most famous and potent among the choices, making it the most likely answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
