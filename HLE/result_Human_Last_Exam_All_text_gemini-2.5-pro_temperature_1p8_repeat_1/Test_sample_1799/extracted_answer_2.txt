No, the 2nd postulate is not superfluous and cannot be deduced from the first postulate alone. While the laws of electromagnetism (which are covered by the first postulate) predict a constant speed of light, this created a direct conflict with the classical laws of velocity addition (also covered by the first postulate). The second postulate is a necessary and independent statement that resolves this conflict by asserting that the consequence from electromagnetism is correct, which in turn forces a fundamental revision of the classical concepts of space and time.
