    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Triple Crown in MLB\nFirst, we must understand what constitutes a \"Triple Crown\" for a batter in Major League Baseball. A player achieves the Batting Triple Crown by leading their respective league (either the American League or the National League) in three specific statistical categories in a single season:\n1.  **Batting Average**\n2.  **Home Runs**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBIs)**\n\n### Step 2: List the National League (NL) Triple Crown Winners\nWe will list the players who have accomplished this feat in the National League, along with the year they did it.\n\n*   **Paul Hines** (1878)\n*   **Hugh Duffy** (1894)\n*   **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1922)\n*   **Rogers Hornsby** (1925)\n*   **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n*   **Joe Medwick** (1937)\n\n**Careful Point:** Rogers Hornsby won the Triple Crown twice. When counting the number of *winners* (i.e., unique players), he should only be counted once. This gives us **6 unique winners** in the National League.\n\n### Step 3: List the American League (AL) Triple Crown Winners\nNext, we will list the players who have won the Triple Crown in the American League.\n\n*   **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n*   **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n*   **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n*   **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1942)\n*   **Ted Williams** (1947)\n*   **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n*   **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n*   **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n*   **Miguel Cabrera** (2012)\n\n**Careful Point:** Ted Williams also won the Triple Crown twice. For the count of unique players, he is counted only once. This gives us **9 unique winners** in the American League.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the lists and calculate the total number of winners\nTo find the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we simply add the number of unique winners from each league.\n\n*   National League Unique Winners: 6\n*   American League Unique Winners: 9\n*   Total Unique Winners = 6 + 9 = 15\n\n### Final Summary of Careful Points:\n*   **Definition:** The Triple Crown is for leading a player's *own league* (NL or AL), not all of MLB, in batting average, home runs, and RBIs.\n*   **Unique Winners vs. Instances:** The question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which refers to the number of individual players. While there have been 17 instances of the Triple Crown being won, it was accomplished by only 15 different players, as Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won it twice.\n*   **Historical Context:** The RBI was not an official statistic in 1878, so Paul Hines's Triple Crown is sometimes disputed. However, he is recognized by most baseball historians and is commonly included on the list.\n*   **Most Recent Winner:** Miguel Cabrera's 2012 win was the first time the feat had been accomplished in 45 years.\n\nBased on the analysis, there are 15 unique players who have won the MLB Batting Triple Crown.\n\n<<<15>>>"
