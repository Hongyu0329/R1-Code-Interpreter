    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of empty edge squares.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Edge Squares**\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has its edges along the 1st and 8th ranks (rows) and the 'a' and 'h' files (columns).\n*   Number of squares on the top edge (8th rank) = 8\n*   Number of squares on the bottom edge (1st rank) = 8\n*   Number of squares on the left edge ('a' file, excluding the already counted corners) = 6\n*   Number of squares on the right edge ('h' file, excluding the already counted corners) = 6\nThe total number of edge squares is 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Bishop's Movement and Attack**\nA crucial property of bishops is that they are \"color-bound.\" A bishop placed on a light-colored square can only move to and attack other light-colored squares. Similarly, a bishop on a dark-colored square can only attack other dark-colored squares. This means a bishop on a light square can never attack a bishop on a dark square. This insight allows us to solve the problem for each color independently and then combine the results.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Edge Squares by Color**\nThe 28 edge squares are evenly divided by color.\n*   Number of light-colored edge squares = 14\n*   Number of dark-colored edge squares = 14\n\nWe can now rephrase the problem into two separate, identical sub-problems:\n1.  Place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the 14 light-colored edge squares.\n2.  Place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the 14 dark-colored edge squares.\n\n**Step 4: Maximizing Bishops on Light-Colored Edge Squares**\nThe 14 light-colored edge squares are:\n*   On the 1st rank: b1, d1, f1, h1 (4 squares)\n*   On the 8th rank: a8, c8, e8, g8 (4 squares)\n*   On the 'a' file: a2, a4, a6 (3 squares)\n*   On the 'h' file: h3, h5, h7 (3 squares)\n\nLet's try a simple placement strategy: placing bishops on the light squares of the 1st and 8th ranks. These are {b1, d1, f1, h1} and {a8, c8, e8, g8}.\n*   Bishops on the same rank do not attack each other.\n*   We must check for attacks between the bishops on the 1st rank and those on the 8th rank. Two squares (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are on the same diagonal if the absolute difference of their coordinates is equal: |x1 - x2| = |y1 - y2|.\n*   For a bishop on the 1st rank (y1=1) and a bishop on the 8th rank (y2=8), the difference is |1 - 8| = 7. Thus, they only attack each other if their file difference is also 7.\n*   Let's check our 8 squares: The only pair with a file difference of 7 is a8 (file 'a', or 1) and h1 (file 'h', or 8), since |1 - 8| = 7.\n*   So, a8 and h1 attack each other. All other pairs are safe (e.g., for b1 and g8, file difference is |2 - 7| = 5 â‰  7).\n*   From this set of 8 squares, we can place a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops by excluding either a8 or h1. Let's place bishops on {b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, g8}. This gives us 7 bishops.\n*   Now we check if these 7 bishops attack any of the other 6 light edge squares on the 'a' and 'h' files.\n    *   b1 attacks a2.\n    *   d1 attacks a4.\n    *   f1 attacks a6.\n    *   c8 attacks h3.\n    *   e8 attacks h5.\n    *   g8 attacks h7.\n*   This arrangement shows that all 6 light squares on the side files are attacked. Therefore, we cannot place any more light-colored bishops.\n*   The maximum number of light-colored bishops that can be placed on the edge is 7.\n\n**Step 5: Maximizing Bishops on Dark-Colored Edge Squares**\nDue to the symmetry of the chessboard, the logic for dark squares is identical.\n*   The 14 dark-colored edge squares are {a1, c1, e1, g1}, {b8, d8, f8, h8}, {a3, a5, a7}, and {h2, h4, h6}.\n*   Considering the 8 dark squares on the 1st and 8th ranks, the only attacking pair is a1 and h8.\n*   By placing 7 bishops (e.g., on {a1, c1, e1, g1, b8, d8, f8}), we can show they attack all 6 remaining dark squares on the side files.\n*   The maximum number of dark-colored bishops that can be placed on the edge is also 7.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n*   Total number of bishops placed = 7 (light) + 7 (dark) = 14 bishops.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   The question asks for the number of edge squares that *lack* bishops.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Number of placed bishops\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nThus, if they succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, 14 squares would have bishops, and 14 squares would be empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
