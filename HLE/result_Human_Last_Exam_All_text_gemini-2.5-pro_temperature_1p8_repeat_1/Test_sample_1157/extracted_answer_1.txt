The appropriate management for the patient involves a multi-phased approach, prioritizing her systemic health.

**Phase 1: Immediate Management**
1.  **Medical Consultation:** The patient must be immediately referred to a physician to begin treatment for her uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%). Systemic stabilization is paramount before any significant dental work.
2.  **Wound Care:** Since reimplantation is impossible after 28 hours, the open sockets must be debrided, irrigated with an antimicrobial rinse, and sutured for proper healing.
