    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by using the concept of polar duality and some fundamental theorems from the geometry of numbers.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Condition:**\n    Let `D` be a convex domain in the plane. The problem requires that for every pair of coprime integers `(p, q)`, the intersection of `D` with the line `l_{p,q}` given by `px + qy = 1` is non-empty (`D ∩ l_{p,q} ≠ ∅`). Let `Z_c` be the set of all integer vectors `v = (p,q)` such that `p` and `q` are coprime.\n\n2.  **Introducing the Support Function:**\n    The support function of a convex set `D`, denoted `H_D(v)`, is defined for any vector `v = (p,q)` as:\n    `H_D(v) = sup {p*x + q*y : (x,y) ∈ D}`\n    Geometrically, `H_D(v)` is the maximum projection of the set `D` onto the direction of vector `v`.\n    The condition that `D` intersects the line `px + qy = 1` means that the set of values of `px + qy` for points in `D` must include 1. This can be stated as:\n    `inf_{(x,y)∈D} (px+qy) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_{(x,y)∈D} (px+qy)`\n    Using the support function, this is:\n    `-H_D(-v) ≤ 1 ≤ H_D(v)` for all `v = (p,q) ∈ Z_c`.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Condition:**\n    The condition gives two inequalities: `H_D(v) ≥ 1` and `H_D(-v) ≥ -1`.\n    However, the set `Z_c` is centrally symmetric: if `v = (p,q)` is in `Z_c`, then `-v = (-p,-q)` is also in `Z_c`. Therefore, the condition `H_D(v) ≥ 1` must hold for `-v` as well. Applying it to `-v` gives `H_D(-v) ≥ 1`. This is a stronger condition than `H_D(-v) ≥ -1`.\n    Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition on `D` simplifies to `H_D(v) ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ Z_c`.\n\n4.  **Symmetry of the Solution:**\n    We can show that the minimal area must be achieved by a centrally symmetric convex domain. If `D` is a solution, then its centrally symmetric version `D_s = (1/2)(D - D)` is also a solution and `Area(D_s) ≥ Area(D)` by the Brunn-Minkowski inequality. Another argument is to consider `D ∩ -D`. If `D` is a minimal solution, so is `-D`. `D ∩ -D` is also a solution and has an area less than or equal to `D`. We can thus restrict our search to centrally symmetric domains without loss of generality for finding the minimum.\n\n5.  **Using Polar Duality:**\n    For a centrally symmetric convex domain `D` containing the origin, its polar dual `D^*` is defined as:\n    `D^* = {y : x·y ≤ 1 for all x ∈ D}`\n    The support function of `D` defines the boundary of `D^*`:\n    `D^* = {y : H_D(y) ≤ 1}`\n    The condition `H_D(v) ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ Z_c` means that no coprime integer vector can lie in the *interior* of `D^*`.\n    So, `int(D^*) ∩ Z_c = ∅`.\n    Since any non-zero integer vector is a positive integer multiple of a coprime vector, this implies that the interior of `D^*` contains no non-zero integer lattice points at all: `int(D^*) ∩ (Z² \\ {0}) = ∅`.\n\n6.  **Bounding the Area of the Dual Body (Minkowski's Theorem):**\n    We now have a convex centrally symmetric body `D^*` whose interior contains no non-zero integer points. According to Minkowski's First Theorem on convex bodies, if the area of such a body `K` were greater than 4, its interior would have to contain a non-zero integer point.\n    Therefore, the area of our dual body `D^*` must be less than or equal to 4:\n    `Area(D^*) ≤ 4`.\n\n7.  **Relating Areas of D and D* (Mahler's Inequality):**\n    There is a fundamental relationship between the area of a centrally symmetric convex body `K` and its polar dual `K^*`, given by the Mahler-Reisner inequality (also known as the inverse Blaschke-Santaló inequality):\n    `Area(K) * Area(K^*) ≥ 8`\n    Applying this to `D` and `D^*`, we have `Area(D) * Area(D^*) ≥ 8`.\n\n8.  **Finding the Lower Bound for the Area of D:**\n    From the previous two steps, we can find a lower bound for the area of `D`:\n    `Area(D) ≥ 8 / Area(D^*)`\n    Since `Area(D^*) ≤ 4`, we have `1 / Area(D^*) ≥ 1/4`.\n    Therefore, `Area(D) ≥ 8 / 4 = 2`.\n    The minimal possible area is at least 2.\n\n9.  **Constructing a Candidate Domain:**\n    This lower bound of 2 is achieved if we can find a domain `D` for which the equalities in the previous inequalities hold. This occurs if `Area(D^*) = 4` and `Area(D) * Area(D^*) = 8`.\n    -   `Area(K) * Area(K^*) = 8` is known to hold when `K` is a centrally symmetric parallelogram.\n    -   We need to find such a parallelogram `K = D^*` with `Area(K) = 4` and `int(K) ∩ (Z² \\ {0}) = ∅`.\n    A perfect candidate for `K` is the square `K = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`.\n    -   It is a centrally symmetric parallelogram.\n    -   Its area is `2 × 2 = 4`.\n    -   Its interior `(-1, 1) × (-1, 1)` clearly contains no non-zero integer points.\n\n10. **Finding the Minimal Domain D and its Area:**\n    The minimal domain `D` is the polar dual of this square `K`:\n    `D = K^* = {(x,y) : ux + vy ≤ 1 for all (u,v) ∈ K}`\n    The supremum of `ux+vy` for `(u,v)` in the square `[-1,1]x[-1,1]` is `|x|+|y|`.\n    So, the domain `D` is described by the inequality `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\n    This is a square with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`. The side length is `√2`, and the area is `(√2)² = 2`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe have shown that the minimal area of such a convex domain must be at least 2. We have also constructed a convex domain that satisfies the condition and has an area of exactly 2. Therefore, the minimal area is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
