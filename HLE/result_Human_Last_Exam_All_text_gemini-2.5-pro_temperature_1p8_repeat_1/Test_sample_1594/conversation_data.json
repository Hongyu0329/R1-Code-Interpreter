    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the letter formed by the buildings.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the exact location of the schools.**\nThe first step is to locate the two specified high schools, Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini, in Pisa, Italy. A search on a map service like Google Maps will show that both schools are located next to each other on the street Via Benedetto Croce.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the schools from an aerial perspective.**\nThe question requires us to view the buildings \"from above\". We will use the satellite view function on a map service to observe the layout of the school buildings.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the shape of the combined buildings.**\nObserving the satellite imagery reveals the following:\n*   There are two main, large, elongated buildings that are roughly parallel to each other. They form the primary structures of the two schools. These two parallel buildings can be seen as the two vertical strokes of a letter.\n*   At the northern end, there is a distinct connecting structure or covered walkway that links the two main parallel buildings. This connector forms a horizontal bar.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the letter formed.**\nWhen you combine the visual elements from Step 3, you get:\n*   A left vertical stroke (one school building).\n*   A right vertical stroke (the other school building).\n*   A horizontal crossbar connecting the two vertical strokes at the top.\n\nThis composition clearly forms the shape of the capital letter \"H\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to look at the combined shape of **both** school buildings, not each one individually.\n*   The perspective must be from directly above (aerial/satellite view) as specified in the question.\n*   The letter is formed by the architectural layout of the buildings and the connecting structures, not by chance markings on the roof.\n*   The resulting shape is a clear, uppercase letter.\n\n<<<H>>>"
