The edges become progressively smoother and simpler. Sharp corners are rounded, and small or thin features are eliminated. This is because the operation is equivalent to a geometric flow that minimizes the total length of the edges (a process known as curve shortening flow), causing convex shapes to shrink and concave regions to be filled in.
