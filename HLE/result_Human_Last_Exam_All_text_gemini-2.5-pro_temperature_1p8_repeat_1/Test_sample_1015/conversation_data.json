    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\n*   **Cambré:** A ballet term meaning \"arched.\" It refers to a bend of the body from the waist, either forward, backward, or sideways.\n*   **Derrière:** A ballet term meaning \"behind\" or \"back.\" So, a *cambré derrière* is a bend backward.\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A Russian ballet technique known for its precise, strong, and clean lines. It emphasizes epaulement (the artistic placement of the head, shoulders, and body) and builds strength and stability from a solid core and stable pelvis.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** An American ballet technique developed by George Balanchine. It is characterized by speed, energy, extreme lines, deep pliés, and a more open, dynamic upper body. It often prioritizes aesthetic lines and visual impact.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Mechanics of a Cambré Derrière**\nA cambré derrière involves several key body parts:\n*   The spine (specifically the upper and middle back).\n*   The head (which follows the line of the spine).\n*   The arms (which frame the movement).\n*   The hips and pelvis (which form the foundation for the bend).\n*   The core muscles (which support the entire movement).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Vaganova and Balanchine Approaches**\n\n*   **Vaganova Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Core Principle:** Stability and Control. The primary focus is on isolating the bend in the upper and middle back.\n    *   **Hip Placement:** This is the most crucial point. In the Vaganova method, the hips must remain absolutely square and directly over the supporting legs. The pelvis does *not* push forward. The goal is to achieve the backbend purely through the flexibility of the spine while maintaining a stable, strong base. This requires immense core and back strength. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical fault.\n    *   **Head and Arms:** The head follows the spine in a clean, continuous line, looking up and back. The arms, typically in 5th en haut (high fifth), maintain their shape and support the line without collapsing.\n\n*   **Balanchine Cambré Derrière:**\n    *   **Core Principle:** Dynamic Line and Visual Effect. The goal is to create a dramatic, sweeping C-curve with the entire body.\n    *   **Hip Placement:** In direct contrast to Vaganova, the Balanchine style encourages the dancer to press the hips *forward* as the upper body bends backward. This use of opposition and counterbalance allows for a visually deeper and more extreme backbend. The shape is more dynamic and off-balance.\n    *   **Head and Arms:** The head may drop back further, and the arms may be more open or even have the \"broken wrist\" look characteristic of Balanchine's style to accentuate the long, sweeping line.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices Based on the Comparison**\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in the arms, this is not the most fundamental or defining difference. The core mechanical difference lies in the torso and hips.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the key distinguishing factor. Vaganova insists on stationary hips, while Balanchine utilizes a forward press of the hips. This technical difference fundamentally changes the mechanics, aesthetics, and required muscular engagement of the step.\n*   **C. Speed:** Speed is a general characteristic of the Balanchine style but not a defining rule for a specific step like cambré. A cambré can be done slowly in a Balanchine adagio or quickly in a Vaganova allegro variation. Therefore, speed is not the primary difference.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The greater degree of backbend seen in the Balanchine style is a *result* of the hip placement, not the cause of the difference itself. The fundamental technical instruction that creates this deeper bend is the forward push of the hips. Therefore, \"Placement of hip\" is a more precise and foundational answer.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** Like the arms, head placement is a stylistic detail that follows from the primary action of the torso and hips. It's a contributing factor to the overall look but not the core mechanical difference.\n\n**Conclusion:** The most significant and technically defining difference between a Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière is how the hips are used. Vaganova requires stable, square hips, whereas Balanchine uses a forward thrust of the hips as a counterbalance.\n\n<<<B>>>"
