    "An analysis of the competitive programming problem is provided below, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Problem Deconstruction**: The core task is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two input strings that are guaranteed to have the same length. The program must output -1, 1, or 0 depending on the comparison result. A key constraint is to devise the solution that is *most memory-efficient* and to calculate the total memory `m` (in bytes) used by the program's variables.\n\n2.  **Comparison Logic**:\n    *   **Lexicographical comparison** dictates comparing the strings character by character from left (index 0) to right.\n    *   The comparison is decided by the first position where the two strings differ.\n    *   **Case-insensitivity** means that 'a' and 'A' are treated as identical, 'b' and 'B' are identical, and so on. A standard way to achieve this is to convert both characters at a given position to a common case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them. The C function `tolower()` from the `<ctype.h>` library is suitable for this.\n\n3.  **Memory Efficiency Strategy**: The main consumer of memory in this problem will be the storage for the input strings. The length can be up to 100 characters.\n\n    *   **Standard Approach**: A straightforward method is to declare two character arrays (buffers), each large enough to hold a 100-character string plus a null terminator (`\\0`).\n        *   `char str1[101];` (101 bytes)\n        *   `char str2[101];` (101 bytes)\n        *   Reading the input using `scanf(\"%s %s\", str1, str2);` populates these buffers. Then, a loop iterates through them to compare characters.\n        *   This approach is simple and robust but requires storing both strings in memory simultaneously. Total memory for these buffers alone is 202 bytes.\n\n    *   **Most Memory-Efficient Approach**: To minimize memory, we should avoid storing both strings completely if possible. The C standard input (`stdin`) is a forward-only stream; once a character is read, we cannot go back. This means we must store the characters of the first string to compare them against the characters of the second string as they are read from the input stream. However, we do not need to store the *entire* second string.\n        *   We can read the first string and store it in a single buffer.\n        *   Then, we can read the second string one character at a time using a function like `getchar()` and compare it immediately with the corresponding character from our stored first string.\n        *   This method eliminates the need for a second large buffer, significantly reducing memory usage.\n\n4.  **Variable Allocation for the Most Efficient Program**: Let's detail the variables needed for the memory-optimal solution.\n    *   **First String Buffer**: We need one buffer to store the first string. Since the maximum length is 100, we need an array of size 101 to accommodate the characters and the null terminator.\n        *   `char s1[101];` -> **101 bytes**\n    *   **Character from Second String**: We need a variable to hold each character from the second string as it is read. The `getchar()` function returns an `int` type so it can represent all possible characters as well as the special `EOF` (End-Of-File) value.\n        *   `int ch;` -> **4 bytes** (on typical 32-bit and 64-bit systems used in competitive programming)\n    *   **Loop Counter**: We need an index to iterate through the first string. Since the length is at most 100, an `unsigned char` (which can hold values 0-255) is sufficient and more memory-efficient than a standard `int`.\n        *   `unsigned char i;` -> **1 byte**\n    *   **Auxiliary Variables**: We could declare `char` variables to hold the lowercase versions of the characters being compared, but for minimum memory, the `tolower()` calls can be nested directly within the comparison logic (`if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(ch))`), thus avoiding the need for extra variables.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation of `m`**: The total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all declared variables in the most efficient implementation.\n    *   m = (size of first string buffer) + (size of character variable for the second string) + (size of loop counter)\n    *   m = `sizeof(s1)` + `sizeof(ch)` + `sizeof(i)`\n    *   m = 101 bytes + 4 bytes + 1 byte\n    *   **m = 106 bytes**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct `getchar()` Usage**: It is a common mistake to declare the variable for `getchar()`'s return value as `char`. It must be `int` to correctly handle the `EOF` value, which lies outside the `char` range.\n2.  **Input Stream Handling**: When mixing `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` with `getchar()`, it's important to handle the whitespace (like newlines `\\n`) that `scanf` leaves in the input buffer. The program must explicitly consume this whitespace before reading the characters of the second string.\n3.  **Data Type Sizing**: To be truly memory-efficient, use the smallest possible standard data type for each variable (e.g., `unsigned char` instead of `int` for a small, non-negative index).\n4.  **Problem Guarantees**: The guarantee that strings have the same length simplifies the logic immensely. We do not need to handle cases where one string is shorter or longer than the other; the comparison loop will naturally terminate correctly for both.\n\nThis step-by-step analysis leads to the design of a program that correctly solves the problem while minimizing variable memory usage to 106 bytes.\n\n<<<106>>>"
