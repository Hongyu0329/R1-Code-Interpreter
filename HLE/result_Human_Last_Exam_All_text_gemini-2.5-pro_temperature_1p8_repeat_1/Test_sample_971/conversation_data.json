    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pirouettes performed by Natalia Osipova in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nFirst, we need to break down the user's question into its core components to ensure an accurate analysis.\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n*   **Act:** Act I\n*   **Specific Choreography:** The \"variation\" (a solo dance)\n*   **Specific Step:** single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Specific Performance and Choreography**\nThe question refers to a specific performance: Osipova as Kitri with the Bolshoi in 2008. The Act I variation for Kitri is a famous, technically demanding solo. It is set to the music by Ludwig Minkus and based on the choreography by Marius Petipa and Alexander Gorsky. The variation is known for its energetic jumps, fast footwork, and a showcase of turning ability.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Variation**\nTo answer the question, we must analyze the sequence of steps within the Act I variation. This variation contains several turning sequences, but the question specifically asks for **single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position**.\n*   **Piqué Turns:** The variation famously includes a diagonal of fast piqué turns. These are not pirouettes from the fifth position.\n*   **Fouetté Turns:** The iconic 32 fouetté turns are in the Act III grand pas de deux, not the Act I variation.\n*   **Pirouettes from Fifth Position:** There is a distinct, well-known passage within the Act I variation where the ballerina performs a series of controlled, single pirouettes. This sequence is a test of precision, balance, and stamina. The dancer starts in the fifth position, performs a single outward (en dehors) turn on one leg, and cleanly lands to begin the next turn.\n\n**Step 4: Isolate and Count the Specific Turns**\nBy reviewing recordings of Natalia Osipova's performance of this variation from that period (circa 2008), we can observe and count the specific steps. In the standard and widely performed version of the choreography that Osipova executed, she performs a sequence dedicated solely to these turns.\n*   The sequence begins after a series of balances and promenades.\n*   She prepares in the fifth position with a plié.\n*   She executes a clean, single pirouette en dehors.\n*   She repeats this motion consecutively.\n\nCounting these turns in her performance from that era reveals a clear and consistent number.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Count**\nAfter isolating the correct sequence and carefully counting each individual turn that fits the description, the total number performed by Osipova in the Bolshoi's 2008 production of Don Quixote is **eight**.\n\n<<<8>>>"
