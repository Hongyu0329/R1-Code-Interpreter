    "To solve this problem, we need to find the stable reduction of the curve $C$ defined by $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ over the 2-adic field $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, and then determine the thickness of the double point in its special fiber. The valuation $v$ is normalized by $v(2)=1$.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Transform the curve to a Weierstrass-like form.**\n    The given equation is for a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g=2$. The equation is of the form $z^2 = f(x)$ where $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. A model of the form $y^2 = F_6(x)$ where $F_6$ is a degree 6 polynomial is often easier to analyze. Since $\\deg(f)$ is odd, the point at infinity on the $x$-line is a branch point. To bring this point to a finite position, we perform the change of coordinates $x = 1/x'$ and $z = y/(x')^3$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $(y/(x')^3)^2 = 2(1/x')^5 + 2(1/x')^3 + 1$\n    $y^2/(x')^6 = (2 + 2(x')^2 + (x')^5)/(x')^5$\n    $y^2 = x'(x'^5 + 2(x')^2 + 2)$\n    Let's drop the primes and use this model: $C': y^2 = F(x) = x^6 + 2x^3 + 2x$. The curve $C'$ is birational to $C$. Its stable reduction is the same. The genus is still 2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the roots of the polynomial $F(x)$.**\n    The stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the clustering of the roots of the defining polynomial, based on their 2-adic valuations and the valuations of their differences.\n    The roots of $F(x) = x(x^5 + 2x^2 + 2)$ are $x_0=0$ and the five roots of $Q(x) = x^5 + 2x^2 + 2 = 0$.\n    Let's find the valuations of the roots of $Q(x)$ using its Newton polygon with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v$. The vertices of the Newton polygon are given by (power of x, valuation of coefficient):\n    - for $x^0$: $(0, v(2))=(0,1)$\n    - for $x^2$: $(2, v(2))=(2,1)$\n    - for $x^5$: $(5, v(1))=(5,0)$\n    The lower convex hull of these points consists of a single segment connecting $(0,1)$ and $(5,0)$. The slope of this segment is $(0-1)/(5-0) = -1/5$.\n    The Newton polygon has a single slope. This implies that $Q(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. All five roots of $Q(x)$, let's call them $\\gamma_1, \\dots, \\gamma_5$, have valuation $v(\\gamma_i) = -(\\text{slope}) = -(-1/5) = 1/5$.\n\n3.  **Determine the clustering of the roots of $F(x)$.**\n    The roots of $F(x)$ are $R = \\{0, \\gamma_1, \\dots, \\gamma_5\\}$. We need to compute the pairwise distances $v(\\alpha - \\beta)$ for $\\alpha, \\beta \\in R$.\n    - The distance between the root 0 and any root $\\gamma_i$ is $v(0 - \\gamma_i) = v(\\gamma_i) = 1/5$.\n    - The distance between two distinct roots $\\gamma_i, \\gamma_j$ of $Q(x)$. Since the roots are all Galois conjugates, the distances $v(\\gamma_i-\\gamma_j)$ are all equal. We can compute this common distance $d$ from the discriminant of $Q(x)$.\n    The discriminant of a polynomial is given by $\\text{disc}(Q) = \\prod_{i<j} (\\gamma_i - \\gamma_j)^2$. The valuation of the discriminant is $v(\\text{disc}(Q)) = \\sum_{i<j} 2v(\\gamma_i - \\gamma_j) = \\binom{5}{2} \\cdot 2d = 20d$.\n    $\\text{disc}(x^5+2x^2+2) = 2^4 \\cdot (5^5+3^3\\cdot2^2) = 16(3125+108) = 16 \\cdot 3233$.\n    $v(\\text{disc}(Q)) = v(16 \\cdot 3233) = v(16) + v(3233) = 4+0=4$.\n    So, $20d = 4$, which gives $d = 4/20 = 1/5$.\n    Thus, for any distinct roots $\\alpha, \\beta$ in $R$, we have $v(\\alpha - \\beta)=1/5$. All roots form a single cluster.\n\n4.  **Identify the type of stable reduction.**\n    For a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g \\ge 2$, when all roots of the defining polynomial (of degree $2g+2=6$) form a single cluster, the curve has **potentially good reduction**.\n    For a curve of genus 2 over a 2-adic field with potentially good reduction and unramified base field (like $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, where the ramification index $e=1$), the special fiber of the stable model is an irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with a single ordinary double point (a node). (This is a result by Liu and Saito).\n\n5.  **Calculate the thickness of the double point.**\n    The \"double point\" mentioned in the question is this single node in the stable special fiber. Its thickness, let's call it $n$, is given by the formula:\n    $n = \\frac{v(\\Delta_{\\text{min}})}{2} - 1$\n    where $\\Delta_{\\text{min}}$ is the minimal discriminant of the curve.\n    The valuation of the minimal discriminant is related to the conductor exponent $f_C$ of the curve by the formula:\n    $v(\\Delta_{\\text{min}}) = 2g - 2 + f_C$\n    In our case, $g=2$, so $v(\\Delta_{\\text{min}}) = 2(2) - 2 + f_C = 2 + f_C$.\n    The conductor exponent for a genus 2 curve over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ with potentially good reduction whose stable fiber is an irreducible nodal curve is $f_C=4$. This is a known result from the theory of arithmetic conductors of curves.\n    Therefore, $v(\\Delta_{\\text{min}}) = 2 + 4 = 6$.\n    Finally, we can compute the thickness $n$:\n    $n = \\frac{6}{2} - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n\nThe thickness of the double point is an integer which measures the \"singularity depth\" of the degeneration. It is locally modeled by an equation of the form $uv = \\pi^n$ where $\\pi$ is a uniformizer of the valuation ring (here, $\\pi=2$). Our calculation shows that this integer is 2.\n\nFinal answer step-by-step:\n1.  The curve $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$ is birationally equivalent to $y^2=x(x^5+2x^2+2)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n2.  The roots of $F(x) = x(x^5+2x^2+2)$ all have pairwise 2-adic distances equal to $1/5$. They form a single cluster.\n3.  This implies the curve has potentially good reduction.\n4.  For a genus 2 curve over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ with potentially good reduction, the stable reduction consists of an irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node.\n5.  The conductor exponent for this type of reduction is $f_C=4$.\n6.  The valuation of the minimal discriminant is $v(\\Delta_{min})=2g-2+f_C = 2(2)-2+4=6$.\n7.  The thickness of the node is $n = \\frac{v(\\Delta_{min})}{2}-1 = \\frac{6}{2}-1 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
