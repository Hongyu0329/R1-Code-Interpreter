    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the ODE and the regime of interest.**\n    The given ODE is $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$.\n    The initial conditions are $y(0) = 0.00, y'(0) = 3.00, y''(0) = 2.00.$\n    We are asked for an analytical expression that approximates the solution for large $x$. The initial conditions with positive first and second derivatives suggest that the solution $y(x)$ will grow from $x=0$. The powerful nonlinear terms $y^4$ and $(y')^4$ suggest that this growth might be very rapid, possibly leading to a singularity at a finite value of $x$, say $x_c$. In this context, the \"large $x$ regime\" refers to the behavior of the solution as $x$ approaches this singularity $x_c$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the ODE for the large $x$ regime (approaching the singularity).**\n    As $x$ approaches a finite value $x_c$, if $y$ and its derivatives blow up, the term $\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$ will be small compared to the exploding terms, since the denominator is finite and non-zero (assuming $x_c$ is not some pathological point). The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$ is oscillatory and bounded, except at its own singularities. Assuming the solution's singularity $x_c$ does not coincide with a singularity of $\\tan(x)$ or where $\\tan(x)=-1$, this term is also negligible compared to the exploding terms.\n    Therefore, the dominant behavior is governed by the simplified ODE:\n    $y''' \\approx y^4 + (y')^4$.\n\n3.  **Determine the dominant balance in the simplified ODE.**\n    Let's test which term on the right-hand side dominates as $x \\to x_c$.\n    If we assume $y \\to \\infty$ and behaves like a power law, say $y \\sim (x_c-x)^{-\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha>0$.\n    Then $y' \\sim (x_c-x)^{-\\alpha-1}$.\n    $y^4 \\sim (x_c-x)^{-4\\alpha}$ and $(y')^4 \\sim (x_c-x)^{-4\\alpha-4}$.\n    As $x \\to x_c$, $(x_c-x) \\to 0$. The term with the more negative exponent, $(y')^4$, will dominate over $y^4$.\n    So, the ODE simplifies further to $y''' \\approx (y')^4$.\n\n4.  **Solve the dominant equation.**\n    Let $u = y'$. The equation becomes $u'' = u^4$. This is a second-order autonomous ODE. We can find a first integral by multiplying by $u'$:\n    $u'u'' = u^4 u' \\implies \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(u')^2\\right) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{5}u^5\\right)$.\n    Integrating gives $\\frac{1}{2}(u')^2 = \\frac{1}{5}u^5 + C_1$, where $C_1$ is an integration constant.\n    Substituting back $u=y'$ and $u'=y''$, we get:\n    $\\frac{1}{2}(y'')^2 = \\frac{1}{5}(y')^5 + C_1$.\n    As $x \\to x_c$, we expect $y'$ and $y''$ to become very large, so the constant $C_1$ becomes negligible. The asymptotic relation is $(y'')^2 \\approx \\frac{2}{5}(y')^5$.\n    This leads to $y''(x) \\approx \\sqrt{2/5} (y'(x))^{5/2}$. Let $u=y'$. This is a separable first-order ODE for $u$: $\\frac{du}{dx} \\approx \\sqrt{2/5} u^{5/2}$.\n    $\\int u^{-5/2} du = \\int \\sqrt{2/5} dx \\implies \\frac{u^{-3/2}}{-3/2} = \\sqrt{2/5} (x - x_c)$.\n    Solving for $u = y'$ gives $y'(x) \\approx K(x_c - x)^{-2/3}$ for some constant $K$.\n    Integrating $y'$ to find $y(x)$:\n    $y(x) = \\int K(x_c - x)^{-2/3} dx = -3K(x_c - x)^{1/3} + C_3$.\n    This shows that as $x \\to x_c$, $y(x)$ approaches a finite constant $C_3$, while $y'$ and its higher derivatives blow up. So, the analytical expression approximating the solution in the large $x$ regime (as $x \\to x_c$) is $y(x) \\approx C_3$.\n\n5.  **Use the initial conditions to find the constants.**\n    The relationship derived from the simplified model is general. We can relate the derivatives:\n    From $y''(x) \\approx K' (x_c-x)^{-5/3}$ and $y'(x) \\approx K(x_c-x)^{-2/3}$, we can see that $\\frac{y''(x)}{y'(x)} \\approx \\frac{K'}{K}(x_c-x)^{-1}$.\n    A more careful derivation from $u'' \\approx \\sqrt{2/5}u^{5/2}$ where $u=y'$ shows $\\frac{y''}{y'} \\frac{d(y')}{dx} / y'$ No, from $u'=\\sqrt{2/5}u^{5/2}$ and $u=\\dots (x_c-x)^{-2/3}$, we get $u'(x) = \\dots (x_c-x)^{-5/3}$. Ratio $u'/u = \\frac{2}{3(x_c-x)}$.\n    So, $\\frac{y''(x)}{y'(x)} \\approx \\frac{2}{3(x_c-x)}$.\n    Let's evaluate this relationship at $x=0$ using the given initial conditions: $y'(0)=3.00, y''(0)=2.00$.\n    $\\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{3(x_c - 0)} \\implies x_c=1$.\n    This is a remarkable result. The ratio of the given initial conditions predicts that the singularity will occur at $x_c=1$. This cannot be a coincidence and is likely an intended feature of the problem.\n\n6.  **Find the constant limit $C_3$.**\n    The large $x$ approximation for the solution is $y(x) \\to C_3 = y(1)$. We need to find this value.\n    The exact relationship between the initial conditions and $C_3$ is complicated because the simplified ODE is not exact for small $x$.\n    However, we can construct an `ansatz` (an educated guess for the solution form) that matches the initial conditions and has the correct singular behavior at $x_c=1$. Let's try to find a function of the form $y(x)=k(1-(1-x)^{1/3})$.\n    This form has a singularity at $x_c=1$ and satisfies $y(x) \\to k$ as $x \\to 1$.\n    Also, $y(0) = k(1-1) = 0$, which matches the first initial condition.\n    Let's find $k$ by matching the other initial conditions.\n    $y'(x) = k \\cdot ( - \\frac{1}{3}(1-x)^{-2/3}(-1) ) = \\frac{k}{3}(1-x)^{-2/3}$.\n    At $x=0$, $y'(0) = k/3$. We are given $y'(0)=3$, so $k/3 = 3 \\implies k=9$.\n    Let's check the third initial condition with $k=9$.\n    Our proposed function is $y(x)=9(1-(1-x)^{1/3})$.\n    $y''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (3(1-x)^{-2/3}) = 3 \\cdot (-\\frac{2}{3})(1-x)^{-5/3}(-1) = 2(1-x)^{-5/3}$.\n    At $x=0$, $y''(0)=2(1-0)^{-5/3}=2$. This also matches the given initial condition.\n    So, the function $y(x) = 9(1-(1-x)^{1/3})$ satisfies all three initial conditions at $x=0$ and has the correct type of singularity at $x_c=1$. It's a very good candidate for the approximate solution.\n\n7.  **Determine the final answer.**\n    The analytical expression that approximates the solution is $y(x) \\approx 9(1-(1-x)^{1/3})$.\n    We are asked for this approximation in the large $x$ regime, which is $x \\to x_c = 1$.\n    As $x \\to 1$, $y(x) \\approx 9(1 - (1-1)^{1/3}) = 9(1-0) = 9$.\n    The solution approaches the constant value 9. The question asks to round the answer to two decimal places.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation: The value is 9. Rounded to two decimal places, it is 9.00.\n\n<<<9.00>>>"
