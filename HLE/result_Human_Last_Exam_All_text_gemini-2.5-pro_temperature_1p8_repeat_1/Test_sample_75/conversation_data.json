    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore.\n\n### Step 1: Define the \"Second Great War\"\nThe term \"Second Great War\" is used by the StarCraft community and lore to describe the galaxy-wide conflict that takes place during the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy. This includes the campaigns of *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*. It is distinct from the first \"Great War\" (the original *StarCraft* game) and the \"Brood War\" (the *Brood War* expansion).\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Timeline from StarCraft Lore\nTo calculate the duration, we need to establish the start and end dates of the conflict based on the official in-game timeline.\n\n*   **Start of the War:** The war begins with the Zerg Swarm's renewed invasion of the Koprulu Sector at the start of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*. According to official lore, this event takes place in the year **2504**.\n*   **End of the War:** The main conflict concludes with the defeat of the dark god Amon, which happens during the epilogue campaign of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void*, titled *Into the Void*. These events take place in the year **2506**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Duration\nThe war's events span across three calendar years: 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n\n*   The events of *Wings of Liberty* and the beginning of *Heart of the Swarm* occur in **2504**.\n*   The majority of *Heart of the Swarm* takes place through **2505**.\n*   The main campaign of *Legacy of the Void* and the final epilogue missions occur in **2506**.\n\nSince the war starts at some point in 2504 and ends at some point in 2506, the total elapsed time is more than two full years. For example, if it started in March 2504 and ended in October 2506, the duration would be 2 years and 7 months. The exact duration in days is not specified in the lore, but it clearly spans more than two full years.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Rounding Rule\nThe question asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**.\n\n*   Calculated duration: Greater than 2 years.\n*   Applying the \"round up\" rule to any value between 2.0 and 3.0 (exclusive of 2.0) results in **3**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Correctly Identifying the War:** It's crucial to understand that the \"Second Great War\" refers to the *StarCraft II* trilogy, not the Brood War or another conflict.\n2.  **Using Official Timeline:** The calculation relies on the established in-game years (2504-2506).\n3.  **Interpreting \"Duration\":** The conflict spans *across* three calendar years, which means the duration is between 2 and 3 years.\n4.  **Strictly Following Rounding:** The specific instruction to \"round up\" is key to resolving the ambiguity and arriving at a single whole number. Any duration greater than 2 years must be rounded up to 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
