    "### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks to identify the primary target neuron for the axons of the ASJ neuron in an adult *C. elegans*. The metric for \"main\" or \"primary\" target is specified as the total number of synapses.\n\n2.  **Define the Key Elements:**\n    *   **ASJ Neuron:** This is a specific type of chemosensory neuron in *C. elegans*. There is a pair of them, ASJL (left) and ASJR (right). They are part of the amphid sensilla.\n    *   **Axon Projection Target:** This refers to the postsynaptic neuron(s) that the ASJ axon connects with and sends signals to.\n    *   **Synapse Number:** The number of chemical synapses is the quantitative measure we must use to determine the \"main\" target.\n    *   **Adult *C. elegans*:** The analysis must be based on the connectome (wiring diagram) of the adult stage of the worm.\n\n3.  **Consult Authoritative Data Sources:** To answer this question, we must refer to the *C. elegans* connectome data, which has been mapped using serial section electron microscopy. The foundational work was done by White et al. (1986), and more recent, comprehensive reconstructions have been published (e.g., Cook et al., 2019; Witvliet et al., 2021). Resources like WormAtlas, WormBook, and online connectome browsers provide access to this data.\n\n4.  **Examine ASJ's Synaptic Outputs:** We need to look at the list of neurons that are postsynaptic to ASJ. Since ASJ is a pair (ASJL/ASJR), we should consider their outputs collectively to determine the main target neuron *class*.\n\n5.  **List Major Targets and Compare Synapse Numbers:**\n    *   Connectome data reveals that ASJ axons make numerous synaptic connections within the nerve ring, primarily to a set of first-layer interneurons.\n    *   The most significant postsynaptic partners of the ASJ neurons are the interneuron classes AIA, AIB, and AIY.\n    *   We now compare the number of synapses from the ASJ pair to each of these target neuron pairs:\n        *   **ASJ to AIY:** This is consistently the strongest connection. In the classic White et al. (1986) dataset, the ASJL/ASJR pair makes a total of approximately 16 synapses onto the AIYL/AIYR pair.\n        *   **ASJ to AIA:** This is the next strongest connection. The ASJ pair makes a total of approximately 12 synapses onto the AIAL/AIAR pair.\n        *   **ASJ to AIB:** The ASJ pair makes a total of approximately 8 synapses onto the AIBL/AIBR pair.\n    *   Newer and more comprehensive datasets, such as the one from Cook et al. (2019), have refined these numbers but confirm the same ranking. The connection from ASJ to AIY remains the one with the highest synapse count.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the quantitative analysis of synapse numbers from multiple *C. elegans* adult connectome datasets, the AIY interneuron class receives the highest number of synaptic inputs from the ASJ sensory neurons. Therefore, AIY is considered the main projection target of ASJ axons.\n\n<<<AIY>>>"
