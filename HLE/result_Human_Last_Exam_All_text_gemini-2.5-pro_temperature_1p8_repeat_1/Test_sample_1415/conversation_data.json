    "This problem asks us to evaluate a definite integral and then perform a calculation based on its value. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Integrand**\n\nThe expression to be integrated is `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)`. This is a specific form that should be recognized. If we let `u = F₃(x)`, then its derivative with respect to x is `du/dx = F₃'(x)`. The integrand can be written as `(du/dx) / u`, or `u'/u`.\n\n**2. Find the Antiderivative**\n\nThe integral of `u'/u` with respect to `x` is a standard result in calculus:\n`∫ (u'/u) dx = ln|u| + C`\nIn our case, `u = F₃(x)`, so the antiderivative of `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n**3. Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\n\nWe need to evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1. Let `V` be the value of the integral.\n`V = ∫₀¹ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = [ln|F₃(x)|]₀¹`\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**4. Evaluate F₃(0)**\n\nWe follow the sequence of function definitions for `x = 0`:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`  =>  `F₀(0) = 0`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x))`  =>  `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x))`  =>  `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))`  =>  `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n**5. Evaluate F₃(1)**\n\nWe follow the same sequence for `x = 1`. In calculus, arguments to trigonometric functions are in radians unless otherwise specified.\n*   `F₀(x) = x`  =>  `F₀(1) = 1`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x))`  =>  `F₁(1) = sin(1)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x))`  =>  `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x))`  =>  `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**6. Substitute into the Expression for V**\n\nNow we substitute our expressions for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` back into the equation for `V`.\n\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2)`. Since `2 > 1`, `ln(2)` is positive.\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`. Since `1` is in radians, `0 < 1 < π/2`, which means `sin(1)` is positive. `e` raised to a positive power is greater than 1. So `1 + e^(sin(1)) > 2`, which means `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` is also positive.\n\nSince both `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` are positive, the absolute value signs can be dropped.\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, this can also be written as:\n`V = ln [ (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / (ln(2)) ]`\n\n**7. Perform the Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow we compute the numerical value of V.\n*   `sin(1) ≈ 0.84147`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.84147 ≈ 2.31977`\n*   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(1 + 2.31977) = ln(3.31977) ≈ 1.20002`\n*   `ln(2) ≈ 0.69315`\n\nNow we calculate V using these intermediate values:\n*   `V = ln(1.20002) - ln(0.69315)`\n*   `V ≈ 0.18234 - (-0.36651)`\n*   `V ≈ 0.18234 + 0.36651`\n*   `V ≈ 0.54885`\n\n**8. Final Step: Calculate the required value**\n\nThe question asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n*   `10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54885 = 5488.5`\n\nSince the fractional part is 0.5 or greater, we round up to the next integer. Using a higher precision calculator:\n`V ≈ 0.548851086`\n`10000 * V ≈ 5488.51086`\nThe closest integer to `5488.51086` is **5489**.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5489}$.\n<<<5489>>>"
