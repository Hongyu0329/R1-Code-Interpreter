    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Definitions**\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$. This means we need to find two matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the following conditions:\na. $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$.\nb. $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ must be stable and proper. A rational matrix is stable if all its poles are in the open left-half of the complex plane (Re(s) < 0). It is proper if the degree of the numerator of each element is less than or equal to the degree of its denominator.\nc. $D(s)$ must be invertible (i.e., its determinant is not identically zero).\nd. $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ must be left coprime. This means that the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all $s$ in the closed right-half plane (Re(s) ≥ 0). This is equivalent to saying that there exist stable, proper matrices $X(s)$ and $Y(s)$ such that the Bezout identity $X(s)D(s) + Y(s)N(s) = I$ holds.\n\n**2. Identify Unstable Poles of H(s)**\nThe given transfer function is:\n\\[\nH(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe poles of $H(s)$ are the union of the poles of its elements. The poles are at $s = -1$ (from the terms $\\frac{s-1}{s+1}$ and $\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$) and $s = 1$ (from the term $\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$).\nThe pole at $s = -1$ is in the left-half plane, so it is a stable pole.\nThe pole at $s = 1$ is in the right-half plane, so it is an unstable pole.\nOur goal is to choose $D(s)$ such that it \"cancels\" this unstable pole when we compute $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$, making $N(s)$ stable.\n\n**3. Set up the Equations and Find Conditions on D(s)**\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. The equation $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nExpanding this matrix multiplication gives the elements of $N(s)$:\n- $n_{11}(s) = d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$\n- $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$\n- $n_{21}(s) = d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$\n- $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$\n\nFor $N(s)$ to be stable, none of its elements can have poles in the right-half plane.\n- From $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ and $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$, we see that $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be stable and proper functions.\n- For $n_{11}(s)$ to be stable, the potential pole at $s=1$ introduced by the term $\\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)}$ must be cancelled. The residue of $n_{11}(s)$ at $s=1$ must be zero.\n  \\[ \\text{Res}(n_{11}, 1) = \\lim_{s \\to 1} (s-1) n_{11}(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 1} \\left( d_{11}(s)\\frac{(s-1)^2}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s+1} \\right) = 0 + d_{12}(1)\\frac{2}{2} = d_{12}(1) \\]\n  Thus, we must have $d_{12}(1) = 0$.\n- Similarly, for $n_{21}(s)$ to be stable, its residue at $s=1$ must be zero.\n  \\[ \\text{Res}(n_{21}, 1) = \\lim_{s \\to 1} (s-1) n_{21}(s) = \\lim_{s \\to 1} \\left( d_{21}(s)\\frac{(s-1)^2}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s+1} \\right) = 0 + d_{22}(1)\\frac{2}{2} = d_{22}(1) \\]\n  Thus, we must have $d_{22}(1) = 0$.\n\n**4. Construct a Simple D(s) and Calculate N(s)**\nWe need to choose stable, proper $d_{ij}(s)$ that satisfy the conditions found above. To construct the simplest possible factorization, let's try to make $D(s)$ a diagonal matrix by setting $d_{12}(s) = 0$ and $d_{21}(s) = 0$.\n- $d_{12}(s)=0$ satisfies $d_{12}(1)=0$.\n- $d_{21}(s)=0$ is stable and proper, so $n_{22}(s)=0$ which is also stable and proper.\n- For $d_{11}(s)$, we need a simple stable, proper function. The simplest choice is $d_{11}(s) = 1$. Then $n_{12}(s) = 1$.\n- For $d_{22}(s)$, we need a stable, proper function such that $d_{22}(1)=0$. The simplest non-zero function that has a zero at $s=1$ is of the form $k(s-1)$. To make it proper and stable, we can divide by a stable polynomial of degree at least 1, like $(s+\\alpha)$ for $\\alpha>0$. Let's choose the simplest one, $d_{22}(s) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$.\n\nWith these choices, we have our candidate $D(s)$:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nNow we calculate the corresponding $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\cdot (\\frac{s-1}{s+1}) + 0 & 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\\\ 0 + \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} & 0 + 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**5. Verify the Factorization**\nWe check the four conditions for our solution:\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}$, $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\na. **$H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$?**\n   $\\det(D(s)) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} - 0 = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$.\n   $D^{-1}(s) = \\frac{1}{\\det(D(s))} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{s+1}{s-1} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s+1}{s-1} \\end{bmatrix}$.\n   $D^{-1}(s)N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s+1}{s-1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{s+1}{s-1}\\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = H(s)$.\n   This condition is satisfied.\n\nb. **Stable and Proper?**\n   All elements of $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ have poles only at $s=-1$ (or no poles). Since $-1$ is in the LHP, both matrices are stable. All elements are also proper (degree of numerator ≤ degree of denominator). This condition is satisfied.\n\nc. **Invertible D(s)?**\n   $\\det(D(s)) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1}$ is not identically zero, so $D(s)$ is invertible. This condition is satisfied.\n\nd. **Left Coprime?**\n   We check the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ for Re(s) ≥ 0.\n   $[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n   The rank of this $2 \\times 4$ matrix is 2 unless the two rows are linearly dependent. Since the first element of the first row is 1 and the first element of the second row is 0, the first row can never be a multiple of the second row. Thus, the two rows are linearly independent for all $s$ where they are defined. The only pole is at $s=-1$, which is not in the closed RHP. Therefore, the matrix has full row rank (rank 2) for all $s$ with Re(s) ≥ 0. The coprimeness condition is satisfied.\n\nFinal Answer: The calculated matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ form a valid left coprime factorization.\n\n>>>D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{s-1}{s+1} \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{(s+1)^2} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}"
