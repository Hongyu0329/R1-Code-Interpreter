    "An analysis of the question, careful points, and step-by-step solution are provided below.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Grand Canonical Ensemble and Interpret the Hamiltonian**\n\n*   The grand canonical partition function `Z` for a system with Hamiltonian `H_sys` and particle number operator `N^` is defined as `Z = Tr[exp(-β(H_sys - μN^))]`, where `β = 1/(k_B T)` and `μ` is the chemical potential.\n*   The question specifies a system with \"Hamiltonian `H^ = -μN^`\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. There are two main interpretations:\n    1.  `H_sys` is given by `-μN^`. In this case, the operator in the exponent would be `H_sys - μN^ = (-μN^) - μN^ = -2μN^`.\n    2.  The question uses `H^` as a shorthand for the entire operator in the grand canonical exponent, i.e., `H^ = H_sys - μN^`.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The second interpretation is the most standard and physically plausible one. It implies that the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian `H_sys` (which describes kinetic and potential energy) is zero. The particles are non-interacting and have no kinetic energy (`ε_k=0`). The chemical potential `μ` originates from the reservoir the system is in contact with, not from the system's own Hamiltonian. We will proceed with this interpretation: `H_sys = 0`.\n*   Therefore, the operator in the exponent is `K^ ≡ H_sys - μN^ = 0 - μN^ = -μN^`.\n*   The partition function to be calculated is `Z = Tr[exp(-βK^)] = Tr[exp(-β(-μN^))] = Tr[exp(βμN^)]`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Problem to Path Integrals**\n\n*   The question explicitly asks to use path integrals. The partition function `Z` can be expressed as a functional integral over fields `φ(x, τ)` that are periodic in imaginary time `τ` with period `β`.\n    `Z = ∫ D[φ*, φ] exp[-S[φ*, φ]]`\n*   The Euclidean action `S` for the grand canonical ensemble is given by:\n    `S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ φ*(x,τ)(∂_τ)φ(x,τ) + H_sys(φ*,φ) - μN(φ*,φ) ]`\n*   In our case, since we determined `H_sys = 0`, the action simplifies. The number operator `N^` is represented by `∫ d^d x φ*(x,τ)φ(x,τ)`.\n*   So, the action is `S = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ φ*(∂_τ - μ)φ ]`.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Path Integral**\n\n*   The partition function is `Z = ∫ D[φ*, φ] exp[- ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x φ*(∂_τ - μ)φ ]`.\n*   This is a Gaussian path integral. Formally, its value is given by the inverse of the determinant of the operator in the action: `Z = [Det(∂_τ - μ)]^{-1}`.\n*   To evaluate the determinant, we work in Fourier space. The fields are expanded over momentum modes `k` and bosonic Matsubara frequencies `ω_n = 2πn/β`.\n*   The operator `(∂_τ - μ)` becomes `(-iω_n - μ)` for each mode `(k, n)`.\n*   The determinant is a product over all these modes: `Det = Π_{k,n} (-iω_n - μ)`.\n*   Thus, the partition function is `Z = Π_k [ Π_n (-iω_n - μ) ]^{-1}`.\n\n**Step 4: Resolve the Path Integral Result Using the Operator Formalism**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** Directly evaluating the infinite product over Matsubara frequencies `n` can be subtle and often introduces zero-point energy terms that may not be present in the original problem definition. A more direct and reliable method is to perform the trace calculation using the operator formalism. The path integral must ultimately agree with this result after proper definition and regularization.\n*   Let's calculate `Z = Tr[exp(βμN^)]` directly. The total number operator is the sum of number operators for each single-particle state (mode) `k`: `N^ = Σ_k N^_k = Σ_k a_k^† a_k`.\n*   The trace can be written as a product over the traces for each independent mode `k`:\n    `Z = Tr[exp(βμ Σ_k a_k^† a_k)] = Tr[Π_k exp(βμ a_k^† a_k)] = Π_k Tr_k[exp(βμ a_k^† a_k)]`\n*   Now we calculate the trace `Z_k` for a single mode `k`. We sum over the Fock states `|n_k⟩` (with `n_k = 0, 1, 2, ...` particles in mode `k`).\n    `Z_k = Tr_k[exp(βμ a_k^† a_k)] = Σ_{n_k=0}^∞ ⟨n_k| exp(βμ a_k^† a_k) |n_k⟩`\n*   Since `a_k^† a_k |n_k⟩ = n_k |n_k⟩`, this becomes:\n    `Z_k = Σ_{n_k=0}^∞ ⟨n_k| e^{βμn_k} |n_k⟩ = Σ_{n_k=0}^∞ e^{βμn_k} ⟨n_k|n_k⟩ = Σ_{n_k=0}^∞ (e^{βμ})^{n_k}`\n*   This is a geometric series.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** For the series to converge, the absolute value of the ratio must be less than one: `|e^{βμ}| < 1`. Since `β > 0`, this requires `exp(βμ) < 1`, which implies `βμ < 0`, or `μ < 0`. This is the standard stability condition for a non-interacting Bose gas.\n*   Assuming `μ < 0`, the sum of the geometric series is:\n    `Z_k = 1 / (1 - e^{βμ})`\n\n**Step 5: Combine Results to Obtain the Final Answer**\n\n*   The total partition function `Z` is the product of the single-mode partition functions `Z_k` over all possible single-particle states `k`.\n*   Therefore, the final result is `Z = Π_k Z_k = Π_k [1 / (1 - e^{βμ})]`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian H^=−μN^ in the grand canonical ensemble, interpreted as a system with `H_sys=0`, is given by the product over all single-particle states `k` of the single-state partition function. The calculation yields:\n\n`Z = Π_k [1 / (1 - e^(βμ))]`\n\nThis result is valid for `μ < 0`, where `β=1/(k_B T)` is the inverse temperature and `μ` is the chemical potential.\n\n<<<`Z = Π_k [1 / (1 - e^(βμ))]`>>>"
