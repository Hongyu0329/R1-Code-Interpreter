    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** SNP heritability is a population parameter that quantifies the proportion of variation in a phenotype that can be explained by the additive effects of all the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) considered (e.g., all SNPs on a standard genotyping chip). It represents the *theoretical upper limit* or ceiling on the predictive power that can be achieved using a linear combination of these SNPs. It assumes you know the true, underlying effect size of every SNP.\n\n2.  **Define a Polygenic Score (PGS):** A PGS is a practical tool used to predict a phenotype. It is a weighted sum of an individual's genotypes. Crucially, the weights (effect sizes) are not the true, unknown effect sizes. Instead, they are *estimates* derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) conducted on a finite 'discovery' sample.\n\n3.  **Compare PGS Predictive Ability and SNP Heritability:**\n    *   The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by the proportion of phenotypic variance it can explain in a separate 'target' sample. This is typically calculated as the R² from a regression of the phenotype on the PGS.\n    *   SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the theoretical maximum R² that a perfect PGS could achieve. A perfect PGS would be one constructed using the *true* genetic effect sizes, not estimated ones.\n    *   Since any real-world PGS is built using *estimated* effect sizes from a finite GWAS sample, these estimates will inevitably contain some level of statistical noise or error.\n    *   This estimation error means that the weights used in the PGS are suboptimal compared to the true weights.\n    *   Other factors also reduce the predictive ability of a PGS below the h²_SNP ceiling, such as differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure or allele frequencies between the GWAS discovery sample and the target sample.\n\n4.  **Analyze the word \"necessarily\":** The term \"necessarily\" implies this relationship always holds. The R² of a PGS can be thought of as a fraction of the SNP heritability (R²_PGS = C * h²_SNP), where the constant C is always less than 1. This constant C depends on factors like the size of the GWAS discovery sample, the genetic architecture of the trait, and the match between discovery and target populations. As the discovery sample size increases towards infinity, the effect size estimates become perfect, and C would approach 1. However, in any practical application with a finite sample size, C will be less than 1. Therefore, the variance explained by the PGS will be less than the SNP heritability. Equality (`R²_PGS = h²_SNP`) is a theoretical limit that is not achievable in practice.\n\n**Conclusion:** The SNP heritability represents the total signal available from the SNPs. A polygenic score is an imperfect attempt to capture that signal using noisy, estimated data. Therefore, the performance of the PGS is bounded by the SNP heritability and, in practice, will always be lower.\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
