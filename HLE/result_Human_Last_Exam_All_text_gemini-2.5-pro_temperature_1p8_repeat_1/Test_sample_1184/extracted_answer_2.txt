Based on analysis using the human Beta-1b subunit (UniProt: P54289-1) as the reference, the key residues are as follows:

**1) Hotspot residues from the beta-1 subunit for INTERACTION (binding) with the alpha-1 subunit:**

These residues form a hydrophobic groove (the Beta Interaction Domain, BID) that binds the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit.

*   **Y215 (Tyrosine-215):** Contributes to the hydrophobic surface of the binding groove.
*   **L221 (Leucine-221):** Lines the wall of the hydrophobic pocket.
*   **V228 (Valine-228):** Provides hydrophobic contact within the groove.
*   **I286 (Isoleucine-286):** Forms part of the pocket's hydrophobic lining.
*   **W295 (Tryptophan-295):** A critical anchor residue; its large side chain forms a major part of the binding interface.
*   **M306 (Methionine-306):** Contributes to the hydrophobic nature of the binding site.
*   **Y355 (Tyrosine-355):** Works with W295 to create a stable docking surface for the AID helix.
*   **F357 (Phenylalanine-357):** Another key aromatic residue contributing to the binding pocket.

**2) Hotspot residues/regions from the beta-1 subunit for GATING MODULATION of the alpha-1 subunit:**

These regions/residues are critical for the functional effects of the beta-1 subunit on channel kinetics and voltage dependence, often acting allosterically after the initial binding event.

*   **The N-terminal Domain (approx. residues 1-46):** This is the most critical region for modulating the voltage-dependence of activation. The entire region functions as a modulatory domain, though specific charged residues within it, such as **D27 (Aspartic acid-27)**, are thought to play a significant role.
*   **The "Hook" Region (approx. residues 238-258):** This flexible linker between the core domains is believed to be crucial for transmitting the modulatory signal from the BID to other parts of the alpha-1 subunit.
*   **L380 (Leucine-380):** A residue at the periphery of the BID, shown to be more important for transducing the gating modulation signal than for the core binding affinity.
