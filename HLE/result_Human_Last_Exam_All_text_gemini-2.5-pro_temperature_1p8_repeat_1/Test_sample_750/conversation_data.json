    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\n### Step 1: Express the equation using the definition of complex exponentiation.\nThe given equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\nThe term $i^z$ is a complex exponentiation, defined as $a^b = e^{b \\ln a}$. The complex logarithm, $\\ln a$, is a multivalued function given by $\\ln a = \\ln|a| + i(\\arg(a) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$.\n\nFor $a=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\pi/2$.\nSo, $\\ln(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's define a constant for each branch of the logarithm: $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)$.\nSo, $i^z = e^{z \\ln(i)} = e^{z \\cdot i C_k}$.\n\nThe original equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z i C_k}$\n\n### Step 2: Use substitution to simplify the equation.\nThis equation has the form $A \\cdot z = e^{B \\cdot z}$. To solve this, we can use a substitution.\nLet's define a new complex variable $w = z i C_k$.\nFrom this substitution, we can express $z$ in terms of $w$:\n$z = \\frac{w}{i C_k} = \\frac{-iw}{C_k}$.\n\nNow, substitute this expression for $z$ back into the equation $z \\cdot i = e^{z i C_k}$:\n$(\\frac{-iw}{C_k}) \\cdot i = e^w$\n\n### Step 3: Solve the simplified equation.\nLet's simplify the left-hand side:\n$\\frac{-i^2 w}{C_k} = e^w$\n$\\frac{-(-1) w}{C_k} = e^w$\n$\\frac{w}{C_k} = e^w$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged into the standard form that defines the Lambert W function ($u e^u = X \\iff u = W(X)$).\n$w = C_k e^w$\n$w e^{-w} = C_k$\n\nTo get it into the standard form, let $u = -w$. Then $w = -u$.\n$(-u) e^{-(-u)} = C_k$\n$-u e^u = C_k$\n$u e^u = -C_k$\n\nThe solution for $u$ is given by the Lambert W function:\n$u = W(-C_k)$\n\nThe Lambert W function is itself multivalued. Its different branches are denoted by $W_n$, where $n$ is an integer. So, a more complete solution is:\n$u = W_n(-C_k)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Step 4: Substitute back to find z.\nNow we reverse the substitutions to find $z$.\nWe had $w = -u$, so $w = -W_n(-C_k)$.\nAnd we had $z = \\frac{-iw}{C_k}$, so:\n$z = \\frac{-i(-W_n(-C_k))}{C_k} = \\frac{i \\cdot W_n(-C_k)}{C_k}$\n\nFinally, substitute the expression for $C_k$:\n$C_k = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k) = \\frac{(4k+1)\\pi}{2}$.\nThe set of all solutions for $z$ is given by:\n$z = \\frac{i}{\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)} W_n(-\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k))$\nThis can also be written as:\n$z = \\frac{2i}{\\pi(4k+1)} W_n(-\\frac{\\pi(4k+1)}{2})$\nwhere $k$ and $n$ are any integers.\n\n### Careful Points:\n1.  **Multivalued Logarithm**: The expression $i^z$ is multivalued because the complex logarithm is multivalued. Each integer `k` corresponds to a different \"branch\" of the equation. The solution set is the union of solutions from all branches.\n2.  **Lambert W Function**: The resulting transcendental equation $we^{-w}=C_k$ requires the Lambert W function for its solution. This function is also multivalued (except for arguments 0 and -1/e), and its branches are indexed by an integer `n`.\n3.  **Real and Imaginary Solutions**: Specific choices of $k$ and $n$ lead to real or purely imaginary solutions.\n    *   **Real solutions** ($z=1, z=-1$): These occur when $W_n(-C_k)$ is purely imaginary, which happens when its argument satisfies specific conditions. We can show that these known real solutions are contained within the general formula. For instance, for any $k$, taking $m = -2k-1$ (odd) gives $C_k = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2}+m)(-1)^m$, leading to $z=1$. Similarly, taking $m=2k$ (even) leads to $z=-1$.\n    *   **Purely imaginary solutions**: These occur when $W_n(-C_k)$ is real. This requires the argument of W to be real and greater than or equal to $-1/e$. This condition, $-C_k \\ge -1/e$, simplifies to $k \\le -1$. For these values of $k$, $-C_k > 0$, and the principal branch $W_0$ gives a real value. This yields an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions for $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$ and $n=0$.\n4.  **Complex Solutions**: For most choices of $k$ and $n$, $W_n(-C_k)$ will be a complex number, leading to a complex solution $z$ that is neither purely real nor purely imaginary. The general formula captures all of these solutions.\n\nThe final answer encompasses all possible solutions by using the doubly-infinite set of parameters $k$ and $n$.\n\n<<<The set of all solutions $z\\in\\mathbb{C}$ is given by the formula:\n$z = \\frac{i}{\\pi(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k)} W_n\\left(-\\pi\\left(\\frac{1}{2} + 2k\\right)\\right)$\nwhere $k$ and $n$ are any integers, and $W_n$ denotes the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function.>>>"
