    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nThe question asks for a specific \"Christian theologian\" who meets several precise criteria:\n1.  **\"First developed\":** This points to an originator or a foundational figure, likely from the early or medieval church, not a modern commentator.\n2.  **\"Specialized terminology\":** The theologian must have coined or systematically used specific terms or concepts, not just discussed the ideas in general language.\n3.  **\"To describe changes in the laws of nature\":** The terminology must relate to how the regular, observable order of the physical world can be altered, suspended, or superseded.\n4.  **\"Applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus\":** The framework must be able to explain a specific, singular miracle that suspends a known biological law.\n5.  **\"And the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall\":** The same framework must also be applicable to a more systemic, ongoing change in the state of nature resulting from a historical, theological event (the Fall of Man).\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Potential Theologians and Their Concepts\n\nSeveral major theologians discussed miracles and the nature of creation, but we must find the one whose specific terminology best fits all criteria.\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (13th Century):** Aquinas developed the distinction between God's **ordinary power (*potentia ordinata*)** and His **absolute power (*potentia absoluta*)**. The *potentia ordinata* refers to God's power as expressed through the established laws of nature, while the *potentia absoluta* is God's ability to do anything that is not logically contradictory, including miracles. This is indeed \"specialized terminology.\" It explains the virgin birth as an act of God's absolute power. However, it is less suited to describing a systemic *change in the laws of nature* at the Fall. For Aquinas, death was natural to the human body, and humanity's pre-Fall immortality was a supernatural gift that was lost; the laws of physics themselves did not fundamentally change.\n\n*   **Other Early/Medieval Figures:** Irenaeus, Origen, Anselm, and others discussed creation and miracles, but they are not primarily known for creating a specific, technical vocabulary to explain the mechanism of how natural law could be altered in the way the question describes.\n\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (4th-5th Century):** Augustine is a very strong candidate. He wrote extensively on creation, miracles, and the effects of the Fall. He was concerned with reconciling the perfection of God's one-time act of creation with the later appearance of new things and miracles.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing Augustine's Specific Contribution\n\nTo address these issues, Augustine adopted and Christianized a concept from Stoic philosophy, developing the specialized terminology of **\"seminal reasons\"** (in Latin: ***rationes seminales*** or ***rationes causales***).\n\n*   **What are \"Seminal Reasons\"?** Augustine proposed that in the initial creation, God did not make everything in its final, developed form. Instead, He embedded \"seminal\" or \"causal\" reasons—hidden potentialities and principles—into the fabric of creation. These are like seeds that contain the potential for future development, which can then unfold over time according to God's providential plan.\n\n*   **How does this terminology apply to the question's criteria?**\n    1.  **\"First Developed\":** As a major theologian of the late Roman Empire, Augustine's systematic use of this concept makes him a foundational figure in Western thought on this topic.\n    2.  **\"Specialized Terminology\":** *Rationes seminales* is a perfect example of specialized, technical terminology.\n    3.  **\"Changes in the Laws of Nature\":** This framework explains how events that appear to violate the *known* laws of nature can occur without God having to perform a new act of creation. A \"miracle\" is not God breaking His own laws, but rather the unfolding of a deeper law or potential that was part of the original design.\n    4.  **Application to the Virgin Birth:** The virgin birth can be understood as the activation of a unique \"seminal reason\" that God had placed within creation (specifically, in Mary's lineage or body) from the beginning, destined to be actualized at the Incarnation. It's a change to the normal course of nature, but one planned within nature's deeper structure.\n    5.  **Application to the Fall:** The negative consequences of the Fall—such as the earth bringing forth \"thorns and thistles\" (Genesis 3:18), painful childbirth, and physical decay—can also be explained using this framework. These negative changes can be seen as the activation of dormant, negative potentials in nature, triggered by human sin. This represents a significant alteration in the functioning of the natural world from its original state.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAugustine of Hippo is the theologian who first developed a specialized conceptual tool—the doctrine of *rationes seminales*—that provided a unified way to think about both unique miracles like the virgin birth and systemic shifts in the natural order like those associated with the Fall. His framework explains these \"changes in the laws of nature\" as the unfolding of potentials embedded within creation from its origin.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
