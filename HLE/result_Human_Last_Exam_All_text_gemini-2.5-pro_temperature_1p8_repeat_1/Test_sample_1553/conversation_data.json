    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the character the protagonist of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" marries.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Novel and Protagonist:**\n    *   The novel in question is \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) by Polish author Jacek Dukaj.\n    *   The main character, or protagonist, of the novel is Adam Zamoyski. He is a 21st-century human who is resurrected in the far future and is referred to as a \"stahs\" (standard posthumous).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Protagonist's Key Relationships:**\n    *   Upon his resurrection, Adam Zamoyski is placed under the care and guidance of a powerful post-human entity known as a \"whir\" (in Polish: \"wir\").\n    *   This whir's name is Angelika Anker. She is an immensely powerful and intelligent being who is central to Adam's new existence.\n\n3.  **Determine the Nature of their Bond:**\n    *   Initially, the relationship between Adam Zamoyski and Angelika Anker is one of a ward and a guardian/mentor. She protects him and helps him navigate the incomprehensible reality of the far future.\n    *   As the story progresses, their relationship deepens significantly. It evolves into a complex romantic partnership and a strategic alliance. They become lovers.\n    *   **Careful point:** The concept of \"marriage\" as a formal 21st-century ceremony may not apply directly in the novel's far-future post-human society. The novel explores themes of transhumanism, where traditional human institutions are often transcended or redefined.\n\n4.  **Confirm the \"Marital\" Union:**\n    *   The culmination of Adam and Angelika's relationship is the creation of a child, which solidifies their bond into what is functionally a family unit.\n    *   Their partnership is the most profound and lasting relationship for the main character in the entire novel. While the specific word \"marriage\" might not be used in a traditional sense, their committed, romantic, and family-forming union is the clear narrative equivalent. No other character comes close to holding this role in Adam Zamoyski's life.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the plot and character dynamics, the character that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, forms a life-long, marital-equivalent partnership with is Angelika Anker.\n\n<<<Angelika Anker>>>"
