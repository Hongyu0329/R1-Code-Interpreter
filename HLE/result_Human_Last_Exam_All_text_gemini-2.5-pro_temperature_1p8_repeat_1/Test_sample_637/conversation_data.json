    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the observer gain matrix.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to design a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system. A deadbeat observer estimates the system state `x(k)` such that the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` becomes identically zero in the shortest possible number of time steps. This shortest duration is determined by the system's observability index, denoted by `ν`. The dynamics of the observation error are given by `e(k+1) = (A - LC)e(k)`. To make the error vanish in `ν` steps for any initial error `e(0)`, the observer gain matrix `L` must be chosen such that the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A - LC` is nilpotent with a nilpotency index of `ν`, i.e., `(A - LC)^ν = 0` and `(A - LC)^(ν-1) ≠ 0`.\n\n**2. System Matrices**\nThe system is described by `x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)` and `y(k) = Cx(k)`.\n*   State matrix `A` (size n x n, with n=4):\n    `A = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]`\n*   Input matrix `B`: (not needed for observer design)\n    `B = [[0], [1], [-1], [1]]`\n*   Output matrix `C` (size p x n, with p=2):\n    `C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n\n**3. Determine the Observability Index (ν)**\nThe observability index `ν` is the smallest integer such that the observability matrix `O_ν = [C^T, (CA)^T, ..., (CA^(ν-1))^T]^T` has rank `n=4`.\n\n*   **Step ν=1:** `O_1 = C`.\n    The rows of `C` are `r1 = [1, 0, 0, 0]` and `r2 = [1, 0, 0, 1]`. These are linearly independent, so `rank(C) = 2`.\n*   **Step ν=2:** `O_2 = [C; CA]`. We calculate `CA`.\n    `CA = [[1,0,0,0];[1,0,0,1]] * A = [[-1,0,0,1]; [-2,0,1,0]]`.\n    The rows of `CA` are `r3 = [-1,0,0,1]` and `r4 = [-2,0,1,0]`.\n    Let's check for linear dependencies among `{r1, r2, r3, r4}`. We notice `r3 = -2*r1 + r2`. Thus, `r3` is dependent on `r1` and `r2`.\n    The set of independent rows so far is `{r1, r2, r4}`. `rank([C; CA]) = rank({r1,r2,r4}) = 3`.\n*   **Step ν=3:** `O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2]`. We calculate `A^2` and `CA^2`.\n    `A^2 = A*A = [[0,0,0,-2], [-3,0,0,-1], [2,0,0,3], [2,1,-1,-3]]`\n    `CA^2 = C*A^2 = [[0,0,0,-2]; [2,1,-1,-5]]`.\n    The rows of `CA^2` are `r5 = [0,0,0,-2]` and `r6 = [2,1,-1,-5]`.\n    The row `r5` is a multiple of `r2 - r1`, so it's dependent on the previous rows.\n    The row `r6` has a non-zero second component, which none of the independent vectors `{r1, r2, r4}` have in their span. Thus, `r6` is linearly independent of the previous rows.\n    The set `{r1, r2, r4, r6}` is linearly independent, proving `rank(O_3) = 4`.\n*   **Conclusion:** The observability index `ν` is 3. We need to find an observer gain `L` such that `(A - LC)^3 = 0`.\n\n**4. Design the Observer Gain Matrix L**\nThe matrix `L` is `n x p` = 4x2. Let `L = [L_col1, L_col2]`.\nThe product `LC` is `(A - LC)`:\n`LC = L_col1*C_row1 + L_col2*C_row2`\n`LC = [[l11],[l21],[l31],[l41]]*[1,0,0,0] + [[l12],[l22],[l32],[l42]]*[1,0,0,1]`\n`LC = [[l11+l12, 0, 0, l12], [l21+l22, 0, 0, l22], [l31+l32, 0, 0, l32], [l41+l42, 0, 0, l42]]`\n\nThe closed-loop matrix is `A_cl = A - LC`.\n`A_cl = [[-1-(l11+l12), 0, 0, 1-l12], [1-(l21+l22), 0, 0, 2-l22], [-(l31+l32), 1, 0, -1-l32], [-1-(l41+l42), 0, 1, -1-l42]]`\n\nTo simplify finding `L`, we can try to make some columns or rows of `A_cl` zero. Let's set the 4th column of `A_cl` to zero.\n`col4(A_cl) = col4(A) - col4(LC) = 0`\n`[1, 2, -1, -1]^T - [l12, l22, l32, l42]^T = 0`\nThis gives us the second column of `L`:\n`L_col2 = [l12, l22, l32, l42]^T = [1, 2, -1, -1]^T`.\n\nNow, `A_cl` has the simplified form:\n`A_cl = [[-1-l11-1, 0, 0, 0], [1-l21-2, 0, 0, 0], [-l31-(-1), 1, 0, 0], [-1-l41-(-1), 0, 1, 0]]`\n`A_cl = [[-2-l11, 0, 0, 0], [-1-l21, 0, 0, 0], [1-l31, 1, 0, 0], [-l41, 0, 1, 0]]`\n\nFor `A_cl` to be nilpotent, all its eigenvalues must be zero. The characteristic polynomial is `det(zI - A_cl) = (z - (-2-l11)) * z^3`. To make all eigenvalues zero, we must have `-2-l11 = 0`, which gives `l11 = -2`.\n\nWith `l11 = -2`, `A_cl` becomes:\n`A_cl = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [-1-l21, 0, 0, 0], [1-l31, 1, 0, 0], [-l41, 0, 1, 0]]`\nLet `a = 1+l21`, `b = 1-l31`, `c = -l41`. Then `A_cl = [[0,0,0,0], [-a,0,0,0], [b,1,0,0], [c,0,1,0]]`.\n\nNow, we enforce the condition `(A_cl)^3 = 0`.\n`A_cl^2 = [[0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [-a,0,0,0], [b-a*c, 1, 0, 0]]`\nThere was a mistake in my thought block. Recomputing:\n`A_cl^2(4,:) = [c,0,1,0]*A_cl = [c*0+1*b, c*0+1*1, c*0+1*0, c*0+1*0] = [b,1,0,0]`\n`A_cl^2 = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[-a,0,0,0],[b,1,0,0]]`\n\n`A_cl^3 = A_cl^2 * A_cl`\nThe first three rows of `A_cl^3` will be zero. The fourth row is:\n`row4(A_cl^3) = [b,1,0,0]*A_cl = [b*0+1*(-a), b*0+1*0, b*0+1*0, b*0+1*0] = [-a, 0, 0, 0]`\nSo, `A_cl^3 = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[-a,0,0,0]]`.\n\nFor `A_cl^3 = 0`, we must have `-a = 0`, which implies `a=0`.\n`a = 1 + l21 = 0` => `l21 = -1`.\n\nThe parameters `b` and `c` do not affect the nilpotency index as long as `a=0` and `A_cl^2` is not zero. `A_cl^2` is not zero if `a,b` are not both zero. Since we set `a=0`, we need `b != 0`. `b = 1-l31`.\nThe parameters `l31` and `l41` can be chosen freely, as long as `b=1-l31` is not zero. Let's choose the simplest values: `l31 = 0` and `l41 = 0`. This makes `b=1` and `c=0`.\n\nThis gives the first column of `L`: `L_col1 = [l11, l21, l31, l41]^T = [-2, -1, 0, 0]^T`.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\nThe observer gain matrix `L` is formed by `L_col1` and `L_col2`:\n`L = [[l11, l12], [l21, l22], [l31, l32], [l41, l42]]`\n`L = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]`\n\nLet's do a quick final check of the resulting `A_cl` matrix.\n`A_cl = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0]]`\n`A_cl^2 = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,0]] ≠ 0`\n`A_cl^3 = A_cl^2 * A_cl = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]] = 0`\nThe nilpotency index is 3, which is the shortest possible time.\n\nThe observer gain matrix L is:\n```\n[[-2,  1],\n [-1,  2],\n [ 0, -1],\n [ 0, -1]]\n```\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
