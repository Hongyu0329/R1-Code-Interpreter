    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This means the board wraps around at the edges. For example, row 1 is adjacent to row 5, and column 1 is adjacent to column 5.\n*   **Pieces:** 4 non-attacking queens.\n*   **Non-attacking condition on a toroidal board:** Two queens at positions `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` are \"attacking\" each other if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board, this is defined by the following conditions, using coordinates from `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` for rows and columns:\n    1.  **Row attack:** `r1 = r2`\n    2.  **Column attack:** `c1 = c2`\n    3.  **Main diagonal attack:** `r1 - c1 ≡ r2 - c2 (mod 5)`\n    4.  **Anti-diagonal attack:** `r1 + c1 ≡ r2 + c2 (mod 5)`\n\nSo, for a valid placement of 4 queens at `(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)`, all four `r_i` values must be distinct, all four `c_i` values must be distinct, all four `(r_i - c_i) mod 5` values must be distinct, and all four `(r_i + c_i) mod 5` values must be distinct.\n\n### **Step 2: Devising a Strategy**\n\nDirectly counting the placements of 4 queens using combinatorics or backtracking is very complex. A more elegant strategy is to relate this problem (placing `N-1` queens on an `N x N` board) to the simpler problem of placing `N` queens on the same board. Here, `N=5`.\n\nOur strategy will be:\n1.  Find the number of ways to place 5 non-attacking queens on the 5x5 toroidal board (`Q_5`).\n2.  Establish a relationship between the number of 4-queen placements (`Q_4`) and the number of 5-queen placements (`Q_5`).\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating the Number of 5-Queen Solutions (Q_5)**\n\nFor 5 non-attacking queens, all 5 rows, 5 columns, 5 main diagonals, and 5 anti-diagonals must be occupied. Solutions to this problem for prime `N > 3` are known to be \"linear\", meaning they follow a formula `c ≡ a*r + b (mod N)`.\n\nLet's find the number of such solutions for `N=5`:\n*   The positions are `(r, a*r + b)` for `r \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}`.\n*   **Row condition:** `r` takes on all 5 distinct values by definition.\n*   **Column condition:** The column values `c = a*r + b` must all be distinct. This holds if and only if `a` is a unit modulo 5 (i.e., `a` has a multiplicative inverse), so `a \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}`.\n*   **Main diagonal condition:** The values `r - c = r - (ar + b) = (1-a)r - b` must be distinct. This holds if `1-a` is a unit, meaning `1-a \\not\\equiv 0 \\implies a \\not\\equiv 1`.\n*   **Anti-diagonal condition:** The values `r + c = r + (ar + b) = (1+a)r + b` must be distinct. This holds if `1+a` is a unit, meaning `1+a \\not\\equiv 0 \\implies a \\not\\equiv -1 \\implies a \\not\\equiv 4`.\n\nCombining the constraints, `a` must be in `{1, 2, 3, 4}` but `a \\not\\equiv 1` and `a \\not\\equiv 4`. So, the only valid choices for `a` are `a=2` and `a=3`.\nThe value `b` is an offset and can be any value from `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` (5 choices).\n\nThus, the total number of 5-queen solutions is `2 (choices for a) * 5 (choices for b) = 10`.\nSo, `Q_5 = 10`.\n\n### **Step 4: Relating 4-Queen and 5-Queen Solutions**\n\nThe key insight is that every valid 4-queen placement can be uniquely extended to a valid 5-queen placement. Let's prove this.\n\nConsider any valid placement of 4 non-attacking queens.\n*   There will be exactly one unused row, `r_u`.\n*   There will be exactly one unused column, `c_u`.\n*   There will be exactly one unused main diagonal index, `d_u`.\n*   There will be exactly one unused anti-diagonal index, `a_u`.\n\nTo extend this to a 5-queen solution, we must place the 5th queen on the unused row and column, i.e., at position `(r_u, c_u)`. For this placement to be valid, it must also occupy the unused diagonals. We need to check if:\n1.  `r_u - c_u \\equiv d_u \\pmod 5`\n2.  `r_u + c_u \\equiv a_u \\pmod 5`\n\nLet the positions of the 4 queens be `(r_i, c_i)` for `i=1,2,3,4`.\nWe know that the sum of all row indices is `0+1+2+3+4 = 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 5`. Therefore:\n`r_u = (\\sum_{k=0}^4 k) - \\sum_{i=1}^4 r_i \\equiv - \\sum_{i=1}^4 r_i \\pmod 5`.\nSimilarly, `c_u \\equiv - \\sum_{i=1}^4 c_i \\pmod 5`.\n`d_u \\equiv - \\sum_{i=1}^4 (r_i - c_i) \\equiv -(\\sum r_i - \\sum c_i) \\equiv \\sum c_i - \\sum r_i \\pmod 5`.\n`a_u \\equiv - \\sum_{i=1}^4 (r_i + c_i) \\equiv -(\\sum r_i + \\sum c_i) \\pmod 5`.\n\nLet's check the two conditions:\n1.  `r_u - c_u = (-\\sum r_i) - (-\\sum c_i) = \\sum c_i - \\sum r_i \\equiv d_u \\pmod 5`. This holds.\n2.  `r_u + c_u = (-\\sum r_i) + (-\\sum c_i) = -(\\sum r_i + \\sum c_i) \\equiv a_u \\pmod 5`. This holds.\n\nThis proves that placing the 5th queen in the only available row and column will automatically satisfy the diagonal conditions. Therefore, any valid 4-queen arrangement can be extended to a valid 5-queen arrangement in exactly one way.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nWe have established a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) between two sets:\n*   Set A: The set of all valid 4-queen placements.\n*   Set B: The set of pairs `(S, q)`, where `S` is a valid 5-queen placement and `q` is one of the 5 queens in `S`.\n\nThe size of Set A is `Q_4`, the number we want to find.\nThe size of Set B is `Q_5 \\times 5`, because for each of the `Q_5` solutions, there are 5 choices for the queen `q` to \"remove\".\n\nSince there's a bijection, `|A| = |B|`.\n`Q_4 = Q_5 \\times 5`\n`Q_4 = 10 \\times 5 = 50`.\n\nThere are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard."
