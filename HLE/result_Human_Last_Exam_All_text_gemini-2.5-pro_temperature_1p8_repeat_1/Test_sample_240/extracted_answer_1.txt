The most common reason a functional MRI coil does not show resonance when probed with a sniffer coil is that its protective circuitry is in a default "safe" mode. When disconnected from the scanner, the coil receives no power. This causes its **active T/R (Transmit/Receive) decoupling circuit** to engage, intentionally detuning the coil to protect it from high-power pulses. Additionally, the coil's integrated **low-noise preamplifier (LNA) is unpowered**, presenting an incorrect impedance to the coil element, which also shifts or destroys the resonance. The coil is not broken; it is simply not in its operational "receive" state.
