    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed-form expression of the infinite product.\n\n**1. Understand the Expression**\n\nThe infinite product is given by:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi}) $$\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written in terms of q-series notation as:\n$$ P = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots = \\prod_{k=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k+1}) $$\nThis is the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q; q^2)_\\infty$.\n\n**2. Relate the Product to Known Functions**\n\nWe can express this product as a ratio of two other infinite products:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)}{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})} $$\nThe numerator is the product over all positive integers, and the denominator cancels out the terms with even powers of $q$.\n\nThese products define the Euler function $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$.\nSo, our product is:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)} = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})} $$\n\n**3. Use the Theory of Jacobi Theta Functions and Elliptic Moduli**\n\nThe Euler function $\\phi(q)$ is directly related to the Jacobi theta function $\\theta_3(0;q)$. Specifically, $\\phi(q)$ is equivalent to the theta constant which is also denoted as $\\vartheta_3(0, \\tau)$, where the nome $q=e^{i\\pi \\tau}$. The standard notation varies, so careful application is key. A common notation for this function is $\\theta_3(q) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} q^{n^2}$.\nIt's a classical result in the theory of elliptic functions that relates the ratio of theta constants to the elliptic modulus $k$.\nThe identity is:\n$$ \\frac{\\phi^2(q)}{\\phi^2(q^2)} = \\frac{\\theta_3^2(q)}{\\theta_3^2(q^2)} = \\frac{2}{1+k'} $$\nwhere $k'$ is the complementary modulus, $k'^2 = 1 - k^2$. The elliptic modulus $k$ is determined by the nome $q$ via the relation $q = e^{-\\pi K'/K}$, where $K=K(k)$ and $K'=K(k')$ are the complete elliptic integrals of the first kind.\n\n**4. Determine the Elliptic Modulus**\n\nWe are given $q = e^{-\\pi}$. Comparing this with the relation $q = e^{-\\pi K'/K}$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{K'}{K} = 1 $$\nThis corresponds to the singular modulus $k_1$. The value of $k$ for which $K'(k)=K(k)$ is:\n$$ k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nThe complementary modulus $k'$ is then:\n$$ k' = \\sqrt{1 - k^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Expression**\n\nNow we can substitute the value of $k'$ back into our expression for the product squared:\n$$ P^2 = \\frac{\\phi^2(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi^2(e^{-2\\pi})} = \\frac{2}{1+k'} = \\frac{2}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}} $$\nLet's simplify this expression:\n$$ P^2 = \\frac{2}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{\\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}+1} $$\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\sqrt{2}-1)$:\n$$ P^2 = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{(\\sqrt{2}+1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)} = \\frac{2(2-\\sqrt{2})}{2-1} = 4 - 2\\sqrt{2} $$\nFinally, since the product consists of terms $(1-x)$ where $0 < x < 1$, the product $P$ must be positive. We take the positive square root:\n$$ P = \\sqrt{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\nThis is the closed-form expression for the given infinite product.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The value is approximately $\\sqrt{4-2(1.4142)} = \\sqrt{4-2.8284} = \\sqrt{1.1716} \\approx 1.0824$. This is a real, positive number as expected.\n\n>>>$\\sqrt{4-2\\sqrt{2}}$"
