    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix**: The Danish flag consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. To analyze its rank, we can imagine it as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a point on the flag, and the value is determined by its color. Let's assign numerical values to the colors, for example, Red = R and White = W.\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Structural\" Patterns**: The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. For a flag's design, we can simplify this by looking at the \"structural\" patterns. A structural row is the sequence of colors you encounter moving horizontally across the flag. A structural column is the sequence of colors moving vertically. The rank will be the minimum of the number of linearly independent structural rows and the number of linearly independent structural columns. The instruction \"assume that values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal\" means we should choose color values (e.g., R=1, W=2) that don't create artificial linear dependencies.\n\n3.  **Identify Denmark's Structural Patterns**:\n    *   **Structural Rows**: Any horizontal line drawn across the Danish flag will produce one of two patterns:\n        1.  A line passing through the upper or lower red rectangles: `(Red, White, Red)`\n        2.  A line passing through the horizontal bar of the cross: `(White, White, White)`\n        These two patterns are linearly independent (one cannot be a scalar multiple of the other, unless Red=White). Thus, there are 2 linearly independent structural rows.\n    *   **Structural Columns**: Similarly, any vertical line will produce one of two patterns:\n        1.  A line passing through the left or right red rectangles: `(Red, White, Red)`\n        2.  A line passing through the vertical bar of the cross: `(White, White, White)`\n        These two patterns are also linearly independent. Thus, there are 2 linearly independent structural columns.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rank**: The rank is the minimum of the row rank and column rank.\n    Rank(Denmark) = min(2, 2) = 2.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Criteria for Other Flags\n\nWe are looking for African national flags that also have a rank of 2. Based on the analysis above, a flag will have a rank of 2 if its design meets these criteria:\n*   It must have both horizontal and vertical variations. Flags with only horizontal stripes or only vertical stripes have a rank of 1.\n*   The number of linearly independent structural row patterns must be 2.\n*   The number of linearly independent structural column patterns must be 2.\n*   We must consider the impact of emblems (stars, shields, etc.). Complex, non-geometric emblems or shapes like stars (which have multiple vertices creating numerous distinct horizontal/vertical profiles) will create many structural patterns, leading to a rank higher than 2. Simple geometric shapes like rectangles, triangles, and circles/disks can result in a rank of 2.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Flags of African Nations\n\nWe will now examine the flags of African nations based on their geometric structure, excluding those with complex emblems or those whose geometry leads to a rank other than 2.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 1**: Flags composed solely of horizontal or vertical stripes have a rank of 1. This excludes many flags, such as Nigeria (vertical tricolor), Ivory Coast (vertical tricolor), Mauritius (horizontal stripes), Gabon (horizontal tricolor), etc.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank > 2**: Flags with very complex designs (e.g., South Africa) or those with diagonal divisions (e.g., Tanzania, Republic of the Congo) create many different structural row and column patterns, leading to a high rank. Flags with complex emblems (coats of arms, animals, detailed stars) are also excluded for this reason.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 2**: We are looking for flags with simple, bisecting geometric patterns.\n\n1.  **Benin**: The flag has a vertical green stripe at the hoist and two horizontal stripes (yellow and red) at the fly.\n    *   Structural Rows: `(Green, Yellow)`, `(Green, Red)`. Two linearly independent patterns.\n    *   Structural Columns: `(Green, Green)`, `(Yellow, Red)`. Two linearly independent patterns.\n    *   Rank = min(2, 2) = 2. This flag qualifies.\n\n2.  **Madagascar**: The flag has a vertical white stripe at the hoist and two horizontal stripes (red and green) at the fly. This has the exact same geometric structure as Benin.\n    *   Rank = 2. This flag qualifies.\n\n3.  **Sudan**: The flag is a horizontal tricolor (red, white, black) with a green triangle at the hoist.\n    *   Structural Rows: `(Green, Red)`, `(Green, White)`, `(Green, Black)`. The vector space spanned by these three patterns has a dimension of 2.\n    *   Structural Columns: `(Green, Green, Green)`, `(Red, White, Black)`. Two linearly independent patterns.\n    *   Rank = min(2, 2) = 2. This flag is composed of simple geometric shapes and qualifies.\n\n4.  **Niger**: The flag is a horizontal tricolor (orange, white, green) with an orange disk in the center of the white stripe.\n    *   Structural Rows: `(Orange)`, `(White, Orange, White)`, `(Green)`. The vector space spanned by these patterns has a dimension of 2 (the constant stripes are linearly dependent, and the `(W,O,W)` pattern is independent of them).\n    *   Structural Columns: `(Orange, White, Green)`, `(Orange, Orange, Green)`. Two linearly independent patterns.\n    *   Rank = min(2, 2) = 2. A disk is a simple geometric shape, so this flag qualifies.\n\n**Flags excluded due to complex emblems (stars, shields, etc.):**\nMany flags have a rank-2 geometric base but include complex emblems that raise their rank above 2. These include Central African Republic (star), Djibouti (star), Equatorial Guinea (coat of arms), Guinea-Bissau (star), Liberia (star), Mozambique (emblems), Sao Tome and Principe (stars), South Sudan (star), Togo (star), Tunisia (star and crescent), Uganda (bird), and Zimbabwe (bird).\n\nBased on this analysis, the flags that consist of simple geometric patterns and have a rank of 2 are a small, specific set.\n\n***\n\nThe flags of the African nations that have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark are those with a simple geometric structure that results in exactly two linearly independent row patterns and two linearly independent column patterns. These are:\n\n*   **Benin**\n*   **Madagascar**\n*   **Sudan**\n*   **Niger**\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, Sudan, Niger>>>"
