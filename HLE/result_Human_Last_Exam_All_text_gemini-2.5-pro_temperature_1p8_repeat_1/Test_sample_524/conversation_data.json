    "This problem asks for the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes) of spaces that are simultaneously continua, planar, and homogeneous. This is a classic problem in point-set topology, and its solution is a celebrated classification theorem built over several decades by multiple mathematicians.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space. Examples include a line segment, a disk, a sphere, and a single point.\n*   **Planar:** A topological space that can be embedded in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$). This means there is a homeomorphism from the space onto a subset of $R^2$.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space $X$ is homogeneous if for any two points $p, q \\in X$, there exists a homeomorphism $h: X \\to X$ of the space onto itself such that $h(p) = q$. This property implies that the space looks the same from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A collection of all topological spaces that are homeomorphic to each other. The question asks for the number of these collections that satisfy the given properties.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis of the Trivial (Degenerate) Case\n\nWe must first consider the simplest possible continuum: a single point.\n*   **Is a point a continuum?** Yes. It is non-empty, compact, connected, and metric.\n*   **Is it planar?** Yes, trivially.\n*   **Is it homogeneous?** Yes. For any two points $p, q$ in a single-point space, we have $p = q$. The identity map is a homeomorphism that sends $p$ to $q$.\nTherefore, the **point** constitutes one homeomorphism class.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Non-Degenerate, Locally Connected Cases\n\nNow, we consider continua with more than one point. A fundamental division is based on the property of local connectedness.\n*   A classic theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz (1920) states that any non-degenerate, homogeneous, and locally connected continuum must be homeomorphic to a **simple closed curve** (i.e., a circle).\n*   Let's check if the circle fits our criteria:\n    *   **Continuum:** The circle ($S^1$) is compact, connected, and metric. Yes.\n    *   **Planar:** It can be embedded in $R^2$. Yes.\n    *   **Homogeneous:** Rotations of the circle are homeomorphisms that can map any point to any other point. Yes.\n*   Thus, the **circle** is the second homeomorphism class.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of Non-Degenerate, Non-Locally Connected Cases\n\nThe remaining possibilities must be continua that are not locally connected. This is where more exotic spaces appear. The analysis here splits further based on whether the continuum is decomposable or indecomposable.\n*   A key result by R. H. Bing states that any homogeneous planar continuum that is not a circle cannot contain any arcs.\n\n**Case 4a: The Indecomposable Case**\n*   A continuum is **indecomposable** if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   There is a famous indecomposable continuum called the **pseudo-arc**.\n*   Let's check the pseudo-arc:\n    *   **Continuum:** Yes, by definition. It is notoriously not locally connected at any point.\n    *   **Planar:** Yes, standard constructions place it in the plane.\n    *   **Homogeneous:** This is a very deep result, also proven by Bing.\n*   A combination of results by various topologists (including L. Fearnley and C. L. Hagopian) establishes that the pseudo-arc is the *only* non-degenerate indecomposable homogeneous planar continuum, up to homeomorphism.\n*   Therefore, the **pseudo-arc** is the third homeomorphism class.\n\n**Case 4b: The Decomposable Case**\n*   Could there be a non-degenerate, non-locally connected, homogeneous planar continuum that *is* decomposable?\n*   This was the final and most difficult part of the classification, solved by J. T. Rogers, Jr. in the 1970s and 80s.\n*   He constructed and proved the uniqueness of such a space. It is known as the **circle of pseudo-arcs**. This continuum can be thought of as being formed by a \"continuous circle\" of pseudo-arcs.\n*   Let's check this object:\n    *   **Continuum:** Yes.\n    *   **Planar:** Yes, Rogers' construction shows it can be embedded in the plane.\n    *   **Homogeneous:** Yes.\n    *   It is not homeomorphic to the circle (it's not locally connected) or the pseudo-arc (it's decomposable).\n*   Thus, the **circle of pseudo-arcs** is the fourth and final homeomorphism class.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe complete classification theorem for homogeneous planar continua states that any such space must be homeomorphic to exactly one of the following four spaces:\n\n1.  **The Point** (degenerate)\n2.  **The Circle** (non-degenerate, locally connected)\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc** (non-degenerate, not locally connected, indecomposable)\n4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs** (non-degenerate, not locally connected, decomposable)\n\nThere are no other possibilities. Therefore, there are exactly 4 such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
