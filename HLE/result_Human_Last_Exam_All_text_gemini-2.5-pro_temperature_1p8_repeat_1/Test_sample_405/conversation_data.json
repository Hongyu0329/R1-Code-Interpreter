    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the primary allotropes of phosphorus:** Phosphorus is known for its allotropy, meaning it can exist in several different structural forms in the solid state. We need to consider the major, distinct, and observable allotropes. The four most well-established allotropes are:\n    *   White Phosphorus\n    *   Red Phosphorus\n    *   Violet Phosphorus\n    *   Black Phosphorus\n\n2.  **Determine the color of each pure allotrope:** The question asks for the colors of the *pure* forms.\n    *   **White Phosphorus (Pâ‚„):** When perfectly pure, this molecular allotrope is a translucent, waxy solid that is essentially **colorless**. It is commonly referred to as \"white phosphorus\" because in bulk or finely divided form, it scatters light to appear white. So, we count **White/Colorless** as the first color.\n    *   **Red Phosphorus:** This is a polymeric form of phosphorus. As its name clearly states, its characteristic color is **Red**. The exact hue can range from orange to dark purple depending on the method of preparation and particle size, but its fundamental color category is red. This is our second distinct color.\n    *   **Violet Phosphorus (also known as Hittorf's Metallic Phosphorus):** This is a crystalline, polymeric allotrope. It forms deep **Violet** or purple crystals that are very stable. This is a distinct color from red. This is our third distinct color.\n    *   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of phosphorus under standard conditions. It has a layered, flaky structure similar to graphite and appears **Black** with a metallic luster. This is our fourth distinct color.\n\n3.  **Count the distinct colors:** We have identified four primary allotropes, each with a unique and characteristic color.\n    *   Color 1: **White**\n    *   Color 2: **Red**\n    *   Color 3: **Violet**\n    *   Color 4: **Black**\n    These four colors are distinct from one another.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Purity:** The question specifies \"pure\" allotropes. This is important because white phosphorus is often seen as yellow due to slight decomposition into red phosphorus upon exposure to light. The pure form is white or colorless.\n*   **Distinct Colors vs. Shades:** Red phosphorus can have various shades (orange-red, dark-red), but these all fall under the general color \"red.\" The question is asking for the number of fundamentally different colors.\n*   **Other Allotropes:** While other forms like \"scarlet phosphorus\" exist, they are generally considered to be less crystalline or amorphous variants of red phosphorus and fall within the red color category. Newer, research-level forms like blue phosphorus (a 2D material) are typically not considered in this type of general knowledge question, which focuses on classical, observable bulk allotropes.\n*   **Counting Colors, Not Allotropes:** The final answer should be the number of distinct colors, which corresponds to the four major allotropes discussed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the four major and distinct allotropes of phosphorus, we can observe four different colors.\n\n<<<4>>>"
