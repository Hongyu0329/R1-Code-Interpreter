To be functionally accurate, when the sun rises, the table must change from an elongated, straight configuration (representing the *trans*-isomer) to a bent configuration (representing the *cis*-isomer) due to the sun's UV light. When the sun sets and the UV light is gone, it must relax back into its original straight configuration.
