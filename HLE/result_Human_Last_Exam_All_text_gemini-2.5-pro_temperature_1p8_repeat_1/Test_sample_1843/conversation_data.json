    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$.\n$N = 36 \\times 1001$\n$N = (6^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\n$N = (2^2 \\cdot 3^2) \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$\nSo, the prime factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding Primitive Characters and Their Structure\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\cdot \\chi_{3^2} \\cdot \\chi_7 \\cdot \\chi_{11} \\cdot \\chi_{13}$,\nwhere $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p^k$.\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be a **primitive character** of conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ must be a primitive character of conductor $p^k$.\n\nThe **order** of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\nWe are looking for characters where this order is 6.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Primitive Characters for Each Prime Power Factor\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor $p^k$ in the factorization of $N$, whose order divides 6.\n\n1.  **Conductor $m=4=2^2$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one trivial character (order 1, conductor 1) and one non-trivial character (order 2, conductor 4). For a primitive character modulo 4, its conductor must be 4. There is only one such character, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, we have **1** choice for $\\chi_4$. Its order is 2.\n\n2.  **Conductor $m=9=3^2$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character mod 9 is primitive if it is not induced from a character mod 3. The characters mod 3 have orders 1 and 2. Thus, the primitive characters mod 9 are those whose orders do not divide 2, i.e., orders 3 and 6. Both 3 and 6 divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3 in $C_6$: $\\phi(3)=2$. These are primitive.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6 in $C_6$: $\\phi(6)=2$. These are primitive.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_9$ is $2+2 = \\textbf{4}$. The order of $\\chi_9$ will be 3 or 6.\n\n3.  **Conductor $m=7$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. For a prime conductor $p$, all non-trivial characters are primitive. We need to find the primitive characters whose order divides 6. The possible orders of characters are the divisors of 6, which are 1, 2, 3, 6. Excluding the trivial character (order 1), the primitive characters have orders 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_7$ is $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\n4.  **Conductor $m=11$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The possible orders of primitive (non-trivial) characters are the divisors of 10 greater than 1: 2, 5, 10. For the lcm of all orders to be 6, the order of $\\chi_{11}$ must divide 6. Out of {2, 5, 10}, only 2 divides 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$ is **1**. Its order must be 2.\n\n5.  **Conductor $m=13$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. The possible orders of primitive (non-trivial) characters are the divisors of 12 greater than 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. We require the order of $\\chi_{13}$ to divide 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5}$.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the results\nWe need to find the number of tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6.\nLet the orders be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$. From our analysis:\n*   $o_4 = 2$\n*   $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_{11} = 2$\n*   $o_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nThe lcm must satisfy two conditions to be equal to 6:\n1.  All orders must divide 6. This is satisfied by our selection process.\n2.  The lcm must be a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3.\n    *   Since $o_4=2$, the lcm is always a multiple of 2.\n    *   Since $o_9$ is either 3 or 6, the lcm is always a multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore, for any valid combination of the component characters we've counted, the lcm of their orders will be a multiple of both 2 and 3, hence a multiple of 6. Since all orders divide 6, the lcm must be exactly 6.\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal Number = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal Number = $100$\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$ is 100."
