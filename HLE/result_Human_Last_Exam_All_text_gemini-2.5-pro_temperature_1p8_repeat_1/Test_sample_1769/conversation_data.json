    "This is a fascinating question that dives deep into the historical linguistics of the English language. To determine the answer, we must trace the etymology of the current word and then project how the original native word would have evolved without external influence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the current word, \"sister\".**\n\nThe Modern English word \"sister\" comes from the Middle English *sister*, which is itself a result of influence from Old Norse. The Old Norse word for sister was *systir*. This Norse word either replaced or heavily influenced the native Old English word. Both the Old Norse and Old English words ultimately derive from the same Proto-Germanic root, *\\*swestēr*. The key point is that the form we use today, with its crisp \"-is-\" sound, is much closer to the Old Norse *systir* than to its native Old English counterpart.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word.**\n\nBefore the Viking invasions and settlement, the word for sister in Old English was **sweostor** (pronounced roughly \"SWEH-os-tor\"). There were also regional variations like *swustor*. This is the word that would have continued its natural evolution in the absence of Norse contact.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the hypothetical evolution of Old English *sweostor*.**\n\nWe need to apply the known rules of sound change that transformed Old English into Middle English and then into Modern English.\n\n*   **From Old to Middle English:** The Old English *sweostor* did not disappear entirely; it survived in some dialects and evolved naturally. A common simplification in Old English words was the loss of the 'w' sound after an initial 's', especially before a rounded back vowel like 'o' or 'u'. Furthermore, the first vowel sound simplified. This process turned *sweostor* into the Middle English form **suster**. This form is well-attested in Middle English texts, existing alongside the Norse-influenced *sister*.\n*   **From Middle English to Modern English:** Now, we trace the evolution of *suster*. The key sound change here involves the vowel 'u'. In Middle English, the 'u' in *suster* was pronounced like the 'oo' in \"boot\" or the 'u' in \"put\". During the evolution to Modern English (part of a series of changes related to the Great Vowel Shift), this short 'u' sound in a stressed syllable generally changed to the /ʌ/ vowel, known as the STRUT vowel.\n\n    *   We can see this exact change in many other words:\n        *   Middle English *sunne* → Modern English \"sun\" (/sʌn/)\n        *   Middle English *cuppe* → Modern English \"cup\" (/kʌp/)\n        *   Middle English *butere* → Modern English \"butter\" (/'bʌtər/)\n\n    Applying this rule to Middle English *suster* gives us a Modern English pronunciation of /'sʌstər/.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Norse Influence:** The primary point is recognizing that our current word \"sister\" is not a pure descendant of the Old English word. The crisp \"s\" and \"t\" sounds are characteristic of the Norse influence, which was simpler and perhaps easier to pronounce than the Old English *sweostor*.\n2.  **Attested Forms:** This is not pure speculation. The form *suster* is a historically documented descendant of *sweostor* that was used in English dialects for centuries. The question is essentially \"What if the dialectal form *suster* had become the standard, instead of the Norse-influenced *sister*?\"\n3.  **Predictable Sound Change:** The shift from the Middle English 'u' sound to the Modern English /ʌ/ (STRUT) sound is one of the most regular and predictable sound changes in the history of the language. This makes the projection from *suster* to its modern form highly reliable.\n4.  **Spelling:** The spelling would most likely have remained **suster**, consistent with words like \"butter,\" \"cutter,\" and \"gust.\"\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWithout the linguistic interchange with the Norse, the native Old English word *sweostor* would have simplified to *suster* in Middle English. Following standard English sound changes, this would have evolved into the Modern English word **suster**, pronounced to rhyme with \"buster.\"\n\n<<<suster>>>"
