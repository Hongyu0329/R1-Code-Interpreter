    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Theoretical Framework**\nThe question asks for the specific heat scaling exponent $\\alpha$ within the framework of renormalization group (RG) theory, specifically using the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion. The context is critical phenomena in a physical system. The standard model for this is the Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson theory for an $n$-component order parameter field $\\phi$, often referred to as the $O(n)$ or $n$-vector model.\n\n**2. Determine the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$)**\nThe upper critical dimension is the spatial dimension at and above which the critical exponents take their mean-field theory values. For the standard model with a $\\phi^4$ interaction term, the engineering dimension of the coupling constant $u$ becomes positive for $d<4$, making it relevant and leading to non-mean-field behavior. At $d=4$, the coupling is marginal.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension:** $d_c = 4$.\n\n**3. Define the Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion**\nThe epsilon expansion is a perturbative technique used to calculate critical exponents as a power series in the parameter $\\epsilon$, defined as the deviation from the upper critical dimension.\n*   **Expansion Parameter:** $\\epsilon = d_c - d$\n*   For the given problem, the spatial dimension is $d=3$. Therefore, $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n**4. Use Scaling Relations**\nCritical exponents are not all independent; they are connected by scaling relations. The specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ is related to the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ and the spatial dimension $d$ by the hyperscaling relation:\n*   **Hyperscaling Relation:** $2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\n*   Rearranging for $\\alpha$, we get: $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$.\n\n**5. Find the Exponent $\\nu$ from the Epsilon Expansion**\nTo find $\\alpha$, we first need to find the expression for $\\nu$ in the epsilon expansion. The standard result for the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ for the $n$-vector model, calculated to the first order in $\\epsilon$, is:\n*   **Correlation Length Exponent:** $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**6. Derive the Epsilon Expansion for $\\alpha$**\nNow, substitute the expressions for $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ and the first-order expansion for $\\nu$ into the hyperscaling relation for $\\alpha$:\n*   $\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\nu$\n*   $\\alpha = 2 - (4 - \\epsilon) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right]$\n\nExpand this expression, keeping only terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$:\n*   $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ (4)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (4)\\left(\\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon\\right) - (\\epsilon)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n*   $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n*   $\\alpha = -\\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n*   Combine the terms in the parenthesis: $\\alpha = -\\left( \\frac{2(n+2) - (n+8)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n*   $\\alpha = -\\left( \\frac{2n+4-n-8}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n*   $\\alpha = -\\left( \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n*   **Result for $\\alpha$ in terms of $n$ and $\\epsilon$**: $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Choice of Model:** The question refers to \"a system\" without specifying the nature of the order parameter. The most common and fundamental example of a phase transition is the liquid-gas or Ising magnetic transition, where the order parameter is a scalar. Thus, it is standard to assume the Ising model, which corresponds to **$n=1$**.\n2.  **Order of Expansion:** The calculation is performed to the first order in $\\epsilon$. The epsilon expansion is an asymptotic series, and using $\\epsilon=1$ gives an approximation. The question asks for the result *using* this method, so the first-order approximation is the expected answer.\n3.  **Accuracy of Formulas:** The calculation relies on standard, well-established formulas for $\\nu$ from RG theory. The derivation from first principles is complex, so using the known result is appropriate.\n4.  **Algebraic Precision:** Care must be taken during the algebraic manipulation to combine terms correctly and avoid sign errors.\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nNow, we substitute the specific values for our problem into the derived formula for $\\alpha$.\n*   Number of order parameter components (Ising model): $n=1$\n*   Epsilon value for $d=3$: $\\epsilon=1$\n\nSubstitute these values into the first-order expression for $\\alpha$:\n*   $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times 1$\n*   $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{3}{2 \\times 9}$\n*   $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{3}{18}$\n*   $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThis value of $\\alpha \\approx 0.167$ is the first-order epsilon expansion result. For comparison, the accepted numerical/experimental value for the 3D Ising model is $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$. The discrepancy is expected since $\\epsilon=1$ is not a very small expansion parameter.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
