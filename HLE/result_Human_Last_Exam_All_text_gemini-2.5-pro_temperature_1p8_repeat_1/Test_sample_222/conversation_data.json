    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs), `X(k)` and `H(k)`, corresponding to two 4-point time-domain sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. We need to find the DFT of a new 8-point sequence, `y(n)`, which is created by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n    *   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n*   **Sequence to Transform:** `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n*   **To Find:** `Y(k)`, the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`.\n\n**2. Relate the New Sequence `y(n)` to `x(n)` and `h(n)`**\n\nThe structure of `y(n)` shows that `x(n)` provides the even-indexed samples and `h(n)` provides the odd-indexed samples.\n*   Even part: `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   Odd part: `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n**3. Apply the Decimation-in-Time (DIT) FFT Property**\n\nThis structure is the basis of the decimation-in-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. The formula that relates the `2N`-point DFT of a sequence to the `N`-point DFTs of its even and odd parts is:\n\n`Y(k) = G(k \\mod N) + W_{2N}^k \\cdot F(k \\mod N)`\n\nwhere:\n*   `Y(k)` is the `2N`-point DFT of the full sequence `y(n)`.\n*   `G(k)` is the `N`-point DFT of the even part `g(n) = y(2n)`.\n*   `F(k)` is the `N`-point DFT of the odd part `f(n) = y(2n+1)`.\n*   `W_{2N} = e^{-j2\\pi / (2N)}` is the twiddle factor.\n\nIn our problem:\n*   `2N = 8`, so `N = 4`.\n*   `G(k) = X(k)` and `F(k) = H(k)`.\n*   The formula becomes: `Y(k) = X(k \\mod 4) + W_8^k \\cdot H(k \\mod 4)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., 7`.\n\n**4. Simplify the Computation**\n\nWe can compute `Y(k)` more efficiently by noticing the properties of the formula for `k` and `k+4`:\n*   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k H(k)` for `k=0,1,2,3`\n*   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k H(k)` for `k=0,1,2,3` (since `W_8^{k+4} = W_8^k W_8^4 = -W_8^k`)\n\nThis is the butterfly structure of the FFT.\n\n**5. Calculate the Necessary Twiddle Factors `W_8^k`**\n\nWe need `W_8^k` for `k=0,1,2,3`:\n*   `W_8^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = e^{-j\\pi/4} = \\cos(\\pi/4) - j\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - j\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}`\n*   `W_8^2 = e^{-j\\pi/2} = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = e^{-j3\\pi/4} = \\cos(3\\pi/4) - j\\sin(3\\pi/4) = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} - j\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-1-j}{\\sqrt{2}}`\n\n**6. Perform the Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **For k=0:**\n    *   `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 H(0) = 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 = 1`\n    *   `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 H(0) = 1 - 1 \\cdot 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k=1:**\n    *   Compute the product term: `W_8^1 H(1) = \\frac{1-j}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot (1+j) = \\frac{1^2 - j^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1 - (-1)}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}`\n    *   `Y(1) = X(1) + \\sqrt{2} = j + \\sqrt{2}`\n    *   `Y(5) = X(1) - \\sqrt{2} = j - \\sqrt{2}`\n\n*   **For k=2:**\n    *   Compute the product term: `W_8^2 H(2) = (-j) \\cdot 1 = -j`\n    *   `Y(2) = X(2) + (-j) = -1 - j`\n    *   `Y(6) = X(2) - (-j) = -1 + j`\n\n*   **For k=3:**\n    *   Compute the product term: `W_8^3 H(3) = \\frac{-1-j}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot (1-j) = \\frac{-(1+j)(1-j)}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-(1^2-j^2)}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{2}} = -\\sqrt{2}`\n    *   `Y(3) = X(3) + (-\\sqrt{2}) = -j - \\sqrt{2}`\n    *   `Y(7) = X(3) - (-\\sqrt{2}) = -j + \\sqrt{2}`\n\n**7. Assemble the Final Result**\n\nCombine the calculated values into a single vector `Y(k)` for `k = 0, ..., 7`.\n\n*   `Y(0) = 1`\n*   `Y(1) = \\sqrt{2} + j`\n*   `Y(2) = -1 - j`\n*   `Y(3) = -\\sqrt{2} - j`\n*   `Y(4) = 1`\n*   `Y(5) = -\\sqrt{2} + j`\n*   `Y(6) = -1 + j`\n*   `Y(7) = \\sqrt{2} - j`\n\nFinal answer is the list of these complex numbers.\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
