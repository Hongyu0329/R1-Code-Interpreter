    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the genus of mushroom known for a blue spore print.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify a specific *genus* of mushroom based on a single, unique characteristic: a \"distinctly blue spore print\".\n\n2.  **Understand \"Spore Print\":** A spore print is a critical tool in mycology for identifying mushrooms. It's the colored powder left behind when a mushroom cap is placed on a surface, allowing its spores to fall. Common spore print colors include white, cream, pink, yellow, various shades of brown, purple, and black.\n\n3.  **Recognize the Rarity of Blue:** A blue spore print is exceptionally rare in the fungal kingdom. This suggests we are looking for a very specific and well-documented exception, not a common characteristic.\n\n4.  **Eliminate Common Misconceptions (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Blue Mushroom Color vs. Blue Spore Print:** It is crucial not to confuse the color of the mushroom's body with the color of its spores. For example, *Lactarius indigo* is a striking blue mushroom, but its spore print is yellowish to cream-colored. Similarly, New Zealand's famous *Entoloma hochstetteri* is brilliantly blue, but its spore print is reddish-pink.\n    *   **Blue Staining vs. Blue Spore Print:** Many mushrooms, like *Gyroporus cyanescens* (the Bluing Bolete), turn blue when cut or bruised due to an oxidation reaction. However, the spore print of *G. cyanescens* is yellowish. The question is not about bruising, but about the innate color of the spores in mass.\n\n5.  **Research the Specific Genus:**\n    *   Mycological sources consistently point to one genus that contains species with this rare feature. This genus is ***Entoloma***.\n    *   While the vast majority of species in the large and diverse *Entoloma* genus have the characteristic pink to salmon-pink spore print, there is a specific group within it known for blue spores.\n    *   This group was formerly classified as a separate genus, ***Leptonia***, which is now considered a subgenus of *Entoloma*. Species within this group, such as *Entoloma lazulinum* (formerly *Leptonia lazulina*), are noted for producing spore prints that can be sky-blue, lilac, or grayish-blue, particularly when fresh.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Answer:** Since *Leptonia* is now taxonomically included within the genus *Entoloma*, the correct answer at the genus level is *Entoloma*. It is the single genus known to contain species that produce a genuinely blue spore print, even though this is not a characteristic of the entire genus.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, despite most of its members having pink spores, the genus *Entoloma* is the only one known to contain species that produce a distinctly blue spore print.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
