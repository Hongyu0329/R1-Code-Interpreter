    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the conceptual entity.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question's key elements.**\nThe question contains several key pieces of information:\n*   **Protagonist:** Fernand Braudel, a historian known for his global perspective and focus on long-term historical structures (*longue durée*).\n*   **Source:** Paul Morand, a French author from whom Braudel is quoting.\n*   **Core Metaphor:** A conceptual entity \"should be inscribed within a sphere.\" This metaphor implies placing the entity within a global, all-encompassing context, rather than viewing it in isolation.\n*   **The Entity's Nature:** It is a \"conceptual entity\" that is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This means a nation is a prime example of this entity, but the entity itself is a broader category.\n\n**Step 2: Connect Braudel's philosophy to the metaphor.**\nFernand Braudel's entire historical project was a reaction against traditional history that focused too narrowly on politics, events, and individual nations. He advocated for studying vast, slow-moving structures that underpin history, such as geography, climate, large-scale economic systems (world-economies), and overarching cultural areas. The idea of inscribing something within a \"sphere\" aligns perfectly with his call for a global, interconnected perspective.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the specific quote and its context.**\nThe quote from Paul Morand appears in several of Braudel's works, including his influential essay collection *On History* and his book *A History of Civilizations*. In *A History of Civilizations*, Braudel uses the quote to set the stage for his entire analysis. He writes:\n\n> \"'Each **civilization**,' wrote Paul Morand in his travel-book *Le Voyage*... 'must be inscribed within a sphere whose centre must be everywhere and circumference nowhere.' A fine literary turn of phrase, a striking aphorism. For the historian, it stands for a crucial problem... every civilization must be seen in a world context.\"\n\n**Step 4: Analyze how the identified entity fits all the criteria.**\n*   **Is it a \"conceptual entity\"?** Yes, \"civilization\" is a core concept in history, anthropology, and sociology, and it was a central unit of analysis for Braudel.\n*   **Is it \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation\"?** Yes. For Braudel, a civilization (e.g., Western Civilization, Islamic Civilization) is a vast cultural space that is much larger and older than any single nation-state. A nation, like France or Spain, is a constituent part—an example or \"exemplar\"—of the broader entity of Western Civilization. To understand the history of France, one must \"inscribe\" it within the larger \"sphere\" of its parent civilization and the world.\n*   **Does it match the quote?** Yes, the direct quote Braudel uses from Morand explicitly names \"civilization.\"\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\nBy examining the direct quotation used by Fernand Braudel and understanding his historical framework, it is clear that the conceptual entity he believed, following Paul Morand's assertion, must be inscribed within a sphere is **civilization**. The nation is a smaller unit used as an example of a component that can only be properly understood within this wider civilizational and global context.\n\n<<<Civilization>>>"
