    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question's Components:**\n    *   **HR (Heart Rate):** This is the average number of heartbeats per minute (BPM).\n    *   **HRV (Heart Rate Variability):** This is the measure of the variation in time between successive heartbeats.\n    *   **PPG (Photoplethysmography):** This is the technology used (often in smartwatches) to measure the change in blood volume, from which heartbeats are detected.\n    *   **\"beat-to-beat intervals\":** This is the key phrase. It refers to the duration of time that elapses from one heartbeat to the very next one.\n    *   **The Core Question:** The question asks for the specific name of this \"beat-to-beat interval\" value, which is the fundamental data point used to calculate HRV metrics.\n\n2.  **Analyze the underlying physiology and terminology:**\n    *   A heartbeat has a distinct electrical signature, which can be measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). The most prominent spike in this signature is called the \"R-wave\".\n    *   The time measured from one R-wave to the next R-wave is the most precise way to determine the time between two consecutive heartbeats.\n    *   Therefore, the formal, clinical name for this time interval is the **R-R interval**.\n\n3.  **Consider the context of PPG:**\n    *   PPG does not measure the heart's electrical signals (R-waves). Instead, it measures the pulse wave in the blood vessels that results from the heart's contraction.\n    *   The time measured from the peak of one pulse wave to the peak of the next is functionally equivalent to the R-R interval for HRV calculation.\n    *   This interval measured by PPG can also be called an **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** or a peak-to-peak interval.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Determine the Best Answer:**\n    *   Although the data comes from PPG, the term **R-R interval** is widely adopted and used interchangeably with IBI in the context of HRV analysis across both clinical (ECG) and consumer tech (PPG) domains.\n    *   HRV metrics like RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences) and SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals) are calculated from a series of these R-R intervals.\n    *   Therefore, the \"value between heartbeats\" that is captured as a \"beat-to-beat interval\" is most commonly and accurately called the **R-R interval**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **HR vs. HRV:** It is crucial not to confuse Heart Rate (an average rate) with the individual time intervals between beats (the raw data for HRV). A steady HR of 60 BPM does not mean each beat is exactly 1 second apart; the tiny variations around that 1-second average are what constitute HRV.\n*   **ECG vs. PPG:** While the origin of the term \"R-R interval\" is from ECG, it has become the standard term in the field of HRV, even when the intervals are derived from PPG sensors.\n*   **NN Interval:** A closely related term is \"NN interval\". This refers to \"Normal-to-Normal\" intervals, which is a dataset of R-R intervals that has been filtered to remove abnormal beats (e.g., artifacts, arrhythmias). This cleaning step is essential for accurate HRV calculation. However, the fundamental value being measured is still the R-R interval.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe question asks for the name of the value measured between heartbeats to compute HRV. Based on the analysis, this time value, measured from one beat to the next, is most precisely and commonly known as the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
