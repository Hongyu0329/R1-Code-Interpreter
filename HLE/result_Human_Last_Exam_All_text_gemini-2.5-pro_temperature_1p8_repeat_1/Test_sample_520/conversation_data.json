    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\n*   **Subject:** Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in the UK.\n*   **Time Period:** World War II.\n*   **Situation:** He was suspected of being a German spy by British counterintelligence (MI5).\n*   **Reason for Suspicion:** He concealed his true profession from his interrogators.\n*   **Question to be answered:** What was his true profession?\n\n**Step 2: Understand the context and potential pitfalls.**\n*   **Context:** During WWII, Britain was extremely wary of enemy spies infiltrating the country, especially among refugees. MI5's role was to vet arrivals and uncover any potential threats. This high-stakes environment meant that any unusual behavior, evasiveness, or inconsistencies in a person's story would trigger intense suspicion.\n*   **The nature of the problem:** Vernault's dilemma was that telling the truth seemed as risky as lying. His profession was so unusual that he feared his interrogators would think it was a poorly fabricated cover story, making him seem even more suspicious. This is a classic example of how fear and paranoia can lead to misunderstandings in intelligence work.\n\n**Step 3: Research and retrieve the factual information.**\n*   A search of historical records, particularly the declassified files of MI5 and histories written about British intelligence operations like the \"Double Cross System,\" is necessary.\n*   Sources such as Ben Macintyre's book \"Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies\" and the official MI5 history detail this specific case.\n*   These sources confirm that Andre Vernault, a Belgian who arrived in Britain in 1941, was thoroughly interrogated. His refusal to state his occupation made MI5 believe he was a German spy sent by the Abwehr (German military intelligence).\n*   After prolonged interrogation and investigation, the truth was finally revealed.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the information to determine the specific profession.**\n*   The historical accounts all agree on the profession Vernault was trying to hide.\n*   He was not a spy. He was simply embarrassed and afraid that his real job was so bizarre that no one in wartime Britain would believe him.\n*   His true profession was that of a **lion tamer**. He had worked in a circus before the war.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis and prepare the final answer.**\n*   The analysis confirms that British counterintelligence mistakenly suspected Andre Vernault.\n*   The reason for the suspicion was his concealment of his job.\n*   The job he was concealing was \"lion tamer.\"\n\n<<<Lion tamer>>>"
