    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the specific US city where the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, moves to in the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the character's role in the movie's plot.**\nTommaso is a key friend of the protagonist, Piero Mansani. His life path diverges from Piero's. While Piero remains in his hometown of Livorno, Tommaso pursues different opportunities.\n\n**Step 3: Focus on the specific plot point of Tommaso's move.**\nTowards the end of the film, Tommaso's academic or career ambitions lead him to leave Italy. The question specifically mentions he moves to the United States. We need to find the exact city.\n\n**Step 4: Research the plot details from reliable sources.**\nConsulting plot summaries from film databases (like IMDb) or encyclopedic sources (like Wikipedia) for *Ovosodo* is the most effective method. A review of the movie's plot reveals that Tommaso gets an opportunity to study abroad.\n\n**Step 5: Pinpoint the exact city name.**\nAccording to the film's narrative, Tommaso receives a scholarship or a study-trip opportunity. This journey takes him to the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Character Distinction:** It is crucial not to confuse Tommaso with the main protagonist, Piero, who does not move to the United States. The question correctly identifies the character as Tommaso.\n*   **Source Verification:** The information about the city should be cross-referenced if possible, but it is a consistent and well-documented plot point in summaries of the film.\n*   **Film Title:** Using the original Italian title, *Ovosodo*, often yields more detailed results from Italian-language sources, which confirm the location as Philadelphia.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
