    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's break down the key terms in the question: \"How many finite groups contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3?\"\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-free set (S):** A subset `S` of `G` is product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This means if `s_1, s_2 \\in S`, then `s_1s_2 \\notin S`. This must also hold for squares, i.e., `s_1^2 \\notin S`.\n*   **Maximal by inclusion product-free set (S):** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means for any element `g` in `G \\ S` (the set of elements in `G` but not in `S`), the new set `S U {g}` is *not* product-free.\n*   **Size 3:** The set `S` must have exactly three elements, i.e., `|S|=3`.\n\nA crucial preliminary point: if a set `S` contains the identity element `e`, it cannot be product-free. If `e \\in S`, then for any other `s \\in S`, `es = s \\in S`, which violates the product-free condition (unless `S` has only one element, which is not our case). So, for our set `S` of size 3, `e \\notin S`.\n\n### Step 2: Applying Structural Theorems\n\nFinding all such groups from first principles is very complex. We can leverage known results from group theory concerning the structure of maximal product-free sets. A key result, refined over the years by various mathematicians (notably by Styrkas, and later by Giudici, Hart, and McNamara), provides a classification for maximal product-free sets in finite *soluble* groups. As it turns out, all groups satisfying the condition are soluble.\n\nThe theorem states that if `S` is a maximal product-free set in a finite soluble group `G`, then there exists a normal subgroup `H` of `G` such that `S` is a union of cosets of `H`, and the corresponding set of cosets `S/H` is a maximal product-free set in the quotient group `G/H`. The theorem then lists the possible structures for `G/H` and `S/H`.\n\nWe need to find the cases from this classification where the total size of `S` is 3.\n\nLet `S = {s_1, s_2, s_3}`.\n\nThe classification gives the following relevant cases:\n\n**Case A: `S` is a single coset of `H`**\nIn this case, `S = gH` for some `g \\in G \\setminus H`. The size of `S` is equal to the size of `H`, so we must have `|H|=3`. The theorem specifies the possible quotient groups `G/H`.\n\n1.  **`G/H \\cong Z_2`**. The order of `G/H` is 2. Since `|H|=3`, the order of `G` is `|G| = |H| \\cdot |G/H| = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6`. We need to find all soluble groups of order 6 that have a normal subgroup of order 3. By Sylow's theorems, a group of order 6 must have a normal subgroup of order 3. The two groups of order 6, `Z_6` (cyclic) and `S_3` (symmetric/dihedral), are both soluble and satisfy this condition.\n    *   **Group 1: `Z_6`**. The subgroup `H = {0, 2, 4}` is normal and has order 3. The coset `S = 1+H = {1, 3, 5}` is a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n    *   **Group 2: `S_3`**. The alternating group `H = A_3 = {e, (123), (132)}` is a normal subgroup of order 3. The coset `S` of non-identity elements is the set of transpositions `{(12), (13), (23)}`, which is a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n\n2.  **`G/H \\cong Z_3`**. The order of `G/H` is 3. Since `|H|=3`, the order of `G` is `|G| = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9`. All groups of order `p^2` (for a prime `p`) are abelian, and hence soluble. The two groups of order 9 are `Z_9` and `Z_3 \\times Z_3`.\n    *   **Group 3: `Z_9`**. The subgroup `H = {0, 3, 6}` is normal, order 3, and `G/H \\cong Z_3`. The cosets `S = 1+H = {1, 4, 7}` and `2+H = {2, 5, 8}` are maximal product-free sets of size 3.\n    *   **Group 4: `Z_3 \\times Z_3`**. Any subgroup of order 3, e.g., `H = <(1,0)> = {(0,0), (1,0), (2,0)}`, is normal and `G/H \\cong Z_3`. A coset like `S = (0,1)+H = {(0,1), (1,1), (2,1)}` is a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n\n3.  **`G/H \\cong Z_4`**. The order of `G/H` is 4. Since `|H|=3`, `|G| = 3 \\cdot 4 = 12`. We need soluble groups of order 12 with a normal subgroup `H` of order 3 and a quotient group `G/H \\cong Z_4`.\n    A group of order 12 has a normal Sylow 3-subgroup or a normal Sylow 2-subgroup. For `G/H \\cong Z_4`, `H` must be the unique (and therefore normal) Sylow 3-subgroup. The group `G` is a semidirect product `Z_3 \\rtimes Z_4`.\n    There are two such semidirect products, corresponding to the two homomorphisms from `Z_4` to `Aut(Z_3) \\cong Z_2`.\n    *   **Group 5: `Z_{12}`**. This arises from the trivial homomorphism, `G = Z_3 \\times Z_4 \\cong Z_{12}`.\n    *   **Group 6: `Dic_3`** (The dicyclic group of order 12, sometimes denoted `Q_{12}`). This arises from the non-trivial homomorphism `Z_4 \\to Aut(Z_3)`. It is isomorphic to `Z_3 \\rtimes Z_4`.\n\n**Case B: `S` is a union of multiple cosets of `H`**\nThe theorem provides other possibilities for `S/H` in `G/H`.\n\n1.  **`G/H \\cong S_3`** and `S/H` is the set of 3 transpositions. Here `|S/H|=3`. For `|S|=3`, we need `|S| = |H| \\cdot |S/H| \\Rightarrow 3 = |H| \\cdot 3 \\Rightarrow |H|=1`. So `H = {e}` and `G \\cong G/H \\cong S_3`. This just recovers the group `S_3`, which we already found.\n\n2.  **`G/H \\cong Z_5`** and `S/H` is `{1,4}` or `{2,3}`. Here `|S/H|=2`. For `|S|=3`, we need `3 = |H| \\cdot 2`. This is impossible for an integer `|H|`.\n\nOther cases listed in the full theorem also do not result in sets of size 3. For example, for non-soluble groups, analysis shows that the smallest one, `A_5`, does not possess maximal product-free sets of size 3. The classification for soluble groups appears to cover all possibilities.\n\n### Step 3: Final Count\n\nWe have identified 6 distinct isomorphism classes of finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3.\n\n1.  **Order 6:** `Z_6` and `S_3`\n2.  **Order 9:** `Z_9` and `Z_3 \\times Z_3`\n3.  **Order 12:** `Z_{12}` and `Dic_3`\n\nThese are all the groups that satisfy the condition. Therefore, the total number of such groups is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
