Here is the summary of the final answer.
A tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol can be designed by following these steps:

1.  **Foundation:** Choose an algebraically friendly signature scheme like Schnorr. This allows for linear operations on secret shares and nonces.

2.  **Phase 1: Distributed Key Generation (DKG):** Use a robust Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) protocol, such as Pedersen VSS. This allows `n` parties to distributively create a single group public key `Y` and for each party `P_i` to obtain a private key share `x_i` of the secret key `x`, without a trusted third party. The process must be robust against up to `t-1` malicious parties.

3.  **Phase 2: Two-Round Signing Protocol:** For a group of `t` signers wishing to sign a message `m`:
    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** Each participant `P_i` generates or selects a secret nonce `D_i` and broadcasts its public commitment `E_i = g^{D_i}`. To prevent attacks where a malicious user chooses their `E_i` after seeing others, all parties must commit simultaneously. This is of
