    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's \"Death of Nikiya\" variation.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the number of a specific ballet step (*entrelacé*) performed by a specific dancer (Natalia Osipova) in a specific role and performance (Nikiya's debut in \"Death of Nikiya\" scene, *La Bayadère*, Bolshoi Ballet, 2009).\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step:** An *entrelacé*, technically *tour jeté entrelacé*, is a type of turning leap. The dancer throws one leg up, jumps while switching the legs in mid-air, and lands on the first leg, having completed a half-turn to face the opposite direction. It has a characteristic whipping or interlacing look.\n\n3.  **Locate the Performance:** The performance in question is available to watch through various recordings online. We need to analyze the choreography of Nikiya's solo in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene from this specific 2009 Bolshoi Ballet production starring Osipova. This solo occurs just before she is presented with the basket of flowers containing the venomous snake.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Choreography for the Specific Step:**\n    *   The variation is highly dramatic and physically demanding, showcasing Osipova's renowned strength and high jumps.\n    *   A significant part of the variation involves a diagonal sequence of powerful jumps traveling from upstage right towards downstage left.\n    *   Observing this sequence closely reveals that these specific jumps are indeed *entrelacés*.\n\n5.  **Count the Entrelacés:** By watching the video of the performance and focusing on this diagonal sequence, we can count each individual leap.\n    *   The first jump is an *entrelacé*.\n    *   The second jump is an *entrelacé*.\n    *   The third jump is an *entrelacé*.\n    *   The fourth jump is an *entrelacé*.\n    *   The fifth jump is an *entrelacé*.\n    *   The sixth jump is an *entrelacé*.\n    *   After this sixth leap, the sequence concludes, and she moves into different choreographic phrases. There are no other *entrelacés* performed in the solo.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Correct identification of the step:** It is crucial to distinguish an *entrelacé* from other ballet leaps like a *grand jeté* (which doesn't turn in this manner) or a *saut de basque*. The whipping, leg-switching motion in Osipova's jumps confirms they are *entrelacés*.\n*   **Consistency of the choreography:** While dancers can sometimes add or subtract elements, this sequence of six *entrelacés* is a standard part of this specific choreographic version (Grigorovich's) for the Bolshoi Ballet. Osipova performs the established number.\n*   **Isolating the correct scene:** The question is very specific to the \"Death of Nikiya\" solo (Act II), not her variations in the \"Kingdom of the Shades\" (Act III). The specified jumps occur in the correct scene.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFollowing a detailed analysis of the choreography performed by Natalia Osipova in her 2009 Bolshoi debut as Nikiya, we can confidently count a single, continuous diagonal sequence containing exactly six *entrelacés*.\n\n<<<6>>>"
