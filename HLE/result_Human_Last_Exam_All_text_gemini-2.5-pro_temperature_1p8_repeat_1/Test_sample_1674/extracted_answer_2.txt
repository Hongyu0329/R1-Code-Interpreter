Yes, the theory can fail. The reversal or correction process is designed for the specific original system (medium T). When a new element (the birefringent medium J) is added, the system's overall transmission properties change (from T to J*T). Applying the old reversal procedure, which is based on the inverse of T (T_inv), to the new system will not work correctly because the inverse of J*T is not equal to T_inv in general. Mathematically, the operation to undo the new system requires (J*T)_inv = T_inv * J_inv, but the described process uses only T_inv, leading to an incorrect result.
