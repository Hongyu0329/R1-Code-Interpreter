    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. The general formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon (an alkane) is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$.\nThe given formula $C_7H_{14}$ has two fewer hydrogens than the corresponding alkane. This indicates one degree of unsaturation. A degree of unsaturation can correspond to one double bond (C=C) or one ring structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Data**\nThe spectrum shows 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in one overlapping signal.\n\nLet's analyze each signal based on its chemical shift and multiplicity (s = singlet, t = triplet, d = doublet, q = quartet), which indicates the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon.\n*   **145 ppm (s)**: The chemical shift (> 100 ppm) indicates a carbon in a C=C double bond. The multiplicity 's' (singlet) means it is a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). This corresponds to a >C= fragment.\n*   **112 ppm (t)**: This shift also indicates a carbon in a C=C double bond. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) means it is a methylene group (CH$_2$). This corresponds to a =CH$_2$ fragment.\n    *   Combining these two alkene signals gives the structural fragment >C=CH$_2$.\n*   **48 ppm (t)**: The shift (< 100 ppm) indicates an sp$^3$ hybridized (alkane-like) carbon. The multiplicity 't' means it is a methylene group (-CH$_2$-).\n*   **27 ppm (d)**: This is an sp$^3$ carbon. The multiplicity 'd' (doublet) means it is a methine group (-CH-).\n*   **22 ppm (q)**: This is an sp$^3$ carbon. The multiplicity 'q' (quartet) means it is a methyl group (-CH$_3$).\n*   **21 ppm (q)**: This is another sp$^3$ methyl group (-CH$_3$).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Structure by Assembling the Fragments**\nWe have identified fragments corresponding to 6 carbon atoms.\nLet's sum the carbons and hydrogens from the 6 signals:\n*   C (from 145 s): 1C, 0H\n*   CH$_2$ (from 112 t): 1C, 2H\n*   CH$_2$ (from 48 t): 1C, 2H\n*   CH (from 27 d): 1C, 1H\n*   CH$_3$ (from 22 q): 1C, 3H\n*   CH$_3$ (from 21 q): 1C, 3H\n*   **Total:** 6 Carbons, 11 Hydrogens.\n\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. We are missing 1 Carbon and 3 Hydrogens, which is a methyl group (-CH$_3$). This confirms that one of the methyl signals must represent two chemically equivalent methyl groups.\n\nOur complete set of building blocks is:\n*   One >C=CH$_2$ group\n*   One -CH$_2$- group\n*   One -CH- group\n*   Three -CH$_3$ groups in total, with two of them being equivalent.\n\nLet's assemble these pieces:\n1.  The two equivalent methyl groups (-CH$_3$) and the methine group (-CH-) naturally combine to form an isopropyl group: -(CH(CH$_3$)$_2$).\n2.  The remaining methylene group (-CH$_2$-) and the third methyl group (-CH$_3$) combine to form an ethyl group: -(CH$_2$CH$_3$).\n3.  The remaining fragment is the >C=CH$_2$ group. The quaternary carbon atom needs two substituents to be tetravalent.\n4.  The only way to connect all fragments is to attach the ethyl group and the isopropyl group to the quaternary carbon of the >C=CH$_2$ fragment.\n\nThis leads to the following structure:\n```\n      CH3\n       \\\n        CH - C = CH2\n       /    |\n     CH3    CH2-CH3\n```\nThis is a valid structure with the molecular formula $C_7H_{14}$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC Name**\nTo name this alkene, we follow IUPAC rules:\n1.  Find the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n2.  Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond.\n3.  Name and number the substituents.\n\nLet's examine the possible chains in our structure:\n```\n      CH3(4')\n       \\\n        CH(3) - C(2) = CH2(1)\n       /        |\n     CH3(4)     CH2-CH3\n```\nThere are two possible chains of equal length (4 carbons) that include the double bond (C1 and C2):\n*   **Chain A:** 1-2-3-4 (through one of the isopropyl methyls). This gives a but-1-ene chain with an ethyl group at C2 and a methyl group at C3. This gives two substituents.\n*   **Chain B:** 1-2-CH$_2$-CH$_3$. This gives a but-1-ene chain with an isopropyl group substituent at C2. This gives one substituent.\n\nAccording to IUPAC rules, if two chains have the same maximum length, the one with the greater number of substituents is chosen as the principal chain. Therefore, we choose Chain A.\n\n*   **Parent chain:** but-1-ene\n*   **Substituents:** an ethyl group at position 2, and a methyl group at position 3.\n\nListing the substituents alphabetically gives the final IUPAC name.\n\n**Final Check:**\n*   Structure: 2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene\n*   Carbons: C(1)=CH2(t), C(2)=quat(s), C(3)=-CH-(d), C(4)=-CH3(q), Ethyl[-CH2-(t), -CH3(q)], Isopropyl[contains C3 and two methyls, -CH3(q)].\n*   The two methyl groups of the isopropyl unit [-CH(CH$_3$)$_2$] are chemically equivalent, so they produce a single `q` signal. The ethyl's methyl is the second `q` signal. This matches the data: 1(s), 2(t), 1(d), 2(q). All data points are consistent with this structure.\n\nThe IUPAC name is **2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2-ethyl-3-methylbut-1-ene>>>"
