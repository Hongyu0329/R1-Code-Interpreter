    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the concept of equilibrium points and their stability.**\n\nThe given differential equation is an autonomous first-order ODE of the form $x'(t) = f(x)$, where $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Points:** These are the constant solutions to the ODE. They are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$. To find them, we must solve the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n*   **Stability of an Equilibrium Point:** An equilibrium point $x^*$ is:\n    *   **Stable (or asymptotically stable)** if solutions that start near $x^*$ tend to approach $x^*$ as $t \\to \\infty$. This happens if $f(x) > 0$ for $x < x^*$ (and near $x^*$) and $f(x) < 0$ for $x > x^*$ (and near $x^*$).\n    *   **Unstable** if solutions that start near $x^*$ tend to move away from $x^*$.\n    *   **Semi-stable** if solutions on one side of $x^*$ approach it, while on the other side they move away. A semi-stable point is not considered stable.\n\nA common method to test stability is the first derivative test. For an equilibrium point $x^*$:\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we must analyze the sign of $f(x)$ around $x^*$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points.**\n\nWe set $x'(t) = 0$ and solve for $x$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nFirst, factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square:\n$$ -x(x - 1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points:\n$x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\n\nWe will use the first derivative test. First, we compute the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\nNow we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:**\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:**\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n    *   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x=0.9$): $f(0.9) = -(0.9)(0.9 - 1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.009 < 0$. Since $x'(t) < 0$, solutions starting to the left of 1 move further to the left (away from 1).\n    *   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x=1.1$): $f(1.1) = -(1.1)(1.1 - 1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -0.011 < 0$. Since $x'(t) < 0$, solutions starting to the right of 1 move to the left (towards 1).\n    Since solutions on one side (left side) move away from $x=1$, this equilibrium point is not stable. It is **semi-stable**.\n\n**Step 4: Find the number of stable equilibrium points, $m$.**\n\nFrom our analysis in Step 3, only one equilibrium point, $x=0$, is stable. The other point, $x=1$, is semi-stable and therefore not counted as stable.\nThus, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression.**\n\nThe question asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ into the expression:\n$$ m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1 - 2^{4048}}$.\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
