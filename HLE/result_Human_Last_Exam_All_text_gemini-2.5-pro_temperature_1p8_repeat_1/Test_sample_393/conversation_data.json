    "This problem asks for the number of Tverberg partitions of a specially constructed set of points $X$. The key to solving this problem is to understand the properties of this set $X$ and then translate the problem into a combinatorial counting exercise.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nLet's break down the key terms and the setup.\n*   **A partition of n:** We are given a partition of the integer $n$ into $r$ positive integer parts, $n = a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_r$.\n*   **A set $X \\subset \\mathbb R^d$ of n points:** This is our ground set of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional space.\n*   **Tverberg's Theorem:** This theorem states that for a set of $N \\ge (r-1)(d+1)+1$ points in $\\mathbb R^d$, there exists a partition of the set into $r$ disjoint subsets, $X_1, \\dots, X_r$, such that their convex hulls have a point in common ($\\cap_{i=1}^r \\text{conv}(X_i) \\neq \\emptyset$).\n*   **Tverberg partition:** Such a partition $\\{X_1, \\dots, X_r\\}$ of the set $X$ is called a Tverberg partition of rank $r$.\n*   **Induced partition on n:** A partition of the set $X$ into subsets $X_1, \\dots, X_r$ induces a partition of the integer $n$ through the cardinalities of these subsets, i.e., $n = |X_1| + \\dots + |X_r|$.\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Special Nature of the Point Set X\nThe problem states a crucial fact: \"For any partition $a_1, \\dots, a_r: 1 \\le a_i \\le d+1$ of $n$, there exists a set $X \\subset \\mathbb R^d$ of $n$ points, such that **every** Tverberg partition of $X$ induces the same partition on $n$ given by the parts $a_1, \\dots, a_r$.\"\n\n*   This is not true for any arbitrary set of points. For a generic set of points, there might be Tverberg partitions inducing different integer partitions, or no Tverberg partitions at all if $n$ is too small.\n*   The existence of such a special set $X$ is a deep result in combinatorial geometry related to the **constrained Tverberg problem**. The condition $1 \\le a_i \\le d+1$ is precisely the condition required to guarantee the existence of such a set $X$.\n*   The statement implies that for this specific set $X$, a partition of its points into subsets $\\{X_1, \\dots, X_r\\}$ is a Tverberg partition **if and only if** the multiset of cardinalities $\\{|X_1|, \\dots, |X_r|\\}$ is equal to the given multiset of parts $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_r\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Reframing the Problem as a Combinatorial Question\nBased on the understanding from Step 2, the task of finding the \"number of Tverberg's partitions of X\" is transformed into a purely combinatorial problem:\n\n**\"What is the number of ways to partition a set of $n$ distinct elements into $r$ subsets with sizes given by $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r$?\"**\n\nThe elements are the $n$ distinct points of $X$. The partitions are collections of subsets of these points.\n\n### Step 4: Deriving the Counting Formula\nLet's derive the formula for this combinatorial problem. Let our set of $n$ points be $X = \\{p_1, \\dots, p_n\\}$.\n\n1.  **Ordered Partitions:** First, let's count the number of ways to create an *ordered* sequence of subsets $(X_1, \\dots, X_r)$ where $|X_i|=a_i$.\n    *   The number of ways to choose $a_1$ points for the first subset $X_1$ is $\\binom{n}{a_1}$.\n    *   From the remaining $n-a_1$ points, the number of ways to choose $a_2$ points for $X_2$ is $\\binom{n-a_1}{a_2}$.\n    *   Continuing this process, the total number of ways is:\n        $\\binom{n}{a_1}\\binom{n-a_1}{a_2} \\cdots \\binom{a_r}{a_r} = \\frac{n!}{a_1!(n-a_1)!} \\frac{(n-a_1)!}{a_2!(n-a_1-a_2)!} \\cdots 1 = \\frac{n!}{a_1!a_2!\\cdots a_r!}$\n    This is the well-known **multinomial coefficient**, denoted $\\binom{n}{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r}$.\n\n2.  **Unordered Partitions:** A Tverberg partition is a *set* of subsets $\\{X_1, \\dots, X_r\\}$, meaning the order does not matter. The multinomial coefficient counts ordered partitions, so we have overcounted. We need to correct for this by dividing by the number of permutations of the subsets that lead to the same partition.\n    *   If all the part sizes $a_i$ are distinct, then the subsets are distinguishable by their size, so no two subsets can be swapped. In this case, the number of partitions is simply the multinomial coefficient.\n    *   However, if some parts have the same size, say $a_i = a_j$, then swapping the subsets $X_i$ and $X_j$ results in the same partition of the set $X$. We must divide by the number of such permutations.\n\n3.  **The General Formula:** Let the distinct part sizes in the multiset $\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r\\}$ be $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k$. Let $m_j$ be the multiplicity of the size $s_j$ (i.e., the number of parts $a_i$ that are equal to $s_j$). The total number of permutations of subsets of the same size is $m_1! \\times m_2! \\times \\cdots \\times m_k!$.\n\n    Therefore, the number of distinct (unordered) partitions is the number of ordered partitions divided by this correction factor.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe number of Tverberg partitions of the set $X$ is the number of ways to partition a set of $n$ elements into subsets of sizes specified by the multiset $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_r\\}$. This is given by the formula:\n\n$$ \\frac{1}{m_1! m_2! \\cdots m_k!} \\binom{n}{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r} $$\n\nwhere:\n*   $n = a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_r$ is the total number of points.\n*   $\\binom{n}{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r} = \\frac{n!}{a_1! a_2! \\cdots a_r!}$ is the multinomial coefficient.\n*   $\\{s_1, \\dots, s_k\\}$ are the distinct values among the part sizes $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_r\\}$.\n*   $m_j$ is the number of times the size $s_j$ appears in the list of parts $(a_1, \\dots, a_r)$.\n\n<<<Let $\\{s_1, \\dots, s_k\\}$ be the set of distinct values in the multiset of part sizes $\\{a_1, \\dots, a_r\\}$, and let $m_j$ be the multiplicity of $s_j$ for $j=1, \\dots, k$. The number of Tverberg partitions is $\\frac{1}{m_1! m_2! \\cdots m_k!} \\binom{n}{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_r}$.>>>"
