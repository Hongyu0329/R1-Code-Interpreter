    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question.**\nThe question asks for the total number of distinct members belonging to the let-7 microRNA (miRNA) family that have been identified in humans (*Homo sapiens*) up to the present day.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"let-7 family member\".**\nIn the context of miRNAs, a \"family\" is a group of miRNAs that share a common \"seed sequence.\" The seed sequence is a short (typically 6-8 nucleotides) region at the 5' end of the mature miRNA that is crucial for determining which messenger RNAs (mRNAs) it will target and regulate. A \"member\" of the family refers to a unique mature miRNA sequence, not the number of genes that code for it. This is a critical distinction because some family members are encoded by multiple genes at different locations in the genome.\n\n**Step 3: Consult authoritative sources.**\nThe most reliable and standard repository for miRNA sequences and nomenclature is miRBase. Scientific reviews on the let-7 family also provide consensus information. We will cross-reference information from these sources.\n\n**Step 4: Identify and list the members of the human let-7 family.**\nBased on the current version of miRBase and the scientific literature, the human let-7 family is composed of the following distinct mature miRNA sequences. All of these share the canonical let-7 seed sequence (GAGGUAG).\n1.  **let-7a**\n2.  **let-7b**\n3.  **let-7c**\n4.  **let-7d**\n5.  **let-7e**\n6.  **let-7f**\n7.  **let-7g**\n8.  **let-7i**\n9.  **miR-98**\n\n**Step 5: Address careful points and potential confusion.**\n*   **Careful Point 1: Members vs. Genes.** It is important not to confuse the number of family members (unique mature sequences) with the number of genes. For example, the mature `let-7a` miRNA is produced from three different genes (`MIRLET7A1`, `MIRLET7A2`, and `MIRLET7A3`). Similarly, `let-7f` is produced from two genes (`MIRLET7F1` and `MIRLET7F2`). Although there are 12 genes in total that encode these 9 members, the number of distinct family members is 9.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Obsolete or Misidentified Members.** An older entry, `let-7h`, was previously listed but has since been removed from miRBase for humans as it was determined to be a misidentification. Therefore, it is not included in the current count.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Broader Superfamily.** Some researchers may consider a broader \"superfamily\" that includes miRNAs with similar but not identical seed sequences (like `miR-202`). However, the canonical, universally accepted core let-7 family consists of the 9 members listed above.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the final number.**\nBy counting the distinct, canonical mature miRNA sequences listed in Step 4, we arrive at the final number.\n\n1.  let-7a\n2.  let-7b\n3.  let-7c\n4.  let-7d\n5.  let-7e\n6.  let-7f\n7.  let-7g\n8.  let-7i\n9.  miR-98\n\nThe total count is 9.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the analysis of unique mature miRNA sequences listed in the authoritative miRBase database, there are 9 members of the canonical let-7 family that have been identified in humans.\n\n<<<9>>>"
