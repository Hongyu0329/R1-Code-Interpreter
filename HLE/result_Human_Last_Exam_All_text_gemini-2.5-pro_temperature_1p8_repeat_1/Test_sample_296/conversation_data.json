    "Answering this question requires knowledge of the structure of the Grigorchuk group, denoted by G. We are looking for the number of subgroups H such that the index `[G:H]` is 4.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Connecting Subgroups of Index 4 to Group Actions**\n    A subgroup `H` of index 4 in a group `G` gives rise to a transitive action of `G` on the set of left cosets `G/H`, which has 4 elements. This action is defined by a homomorphism `φ: G → S₄`, where `S₄` is the symmetric group on 4 elements. The image of this homomorphism, `Im(φ)`, must be a transitive subgroup of `S₄`. Conversely, any homomorphism `φ: G → S₄` with a transitive image defines a class of conjugate subgroups of index 4, given by the stabilizers of the points {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n\n2.  **Identifying Possible Transitive Subgroups of S₄**\n    We need to identify the transitive subgroups of `S₄` that can be homomorphic images of the Grigorchuk group `G`.\n    The transitive subgroups of `S₄` are:\n    *   `C₄` (Cyclic group of order 4)\n    *   `V₄` (Klein four-group, order 4)\n    *   `D₄` (Dihedral group of order 8)\n    *   `A₄` (Alternating group, order 12)\n    *   `S₄` (Symmetric group, order 24)\n\n3.  **Using Properties of the Grigorchuk Group (G)**\n    The Grigorchuk group `G` has several key properties that severely restrict the possible homomorphic images:\n    *   **Residually Finite p-group:** `G` is a residually finite 2-group. This means that for any non-identity element `g ∈ G`, there is a homomorphism `φ` to a finite 2-group (a group whose order is a power of 2) such that `φ(g)` is not the identity. A crucial consequence is that any finite homomorphic image of `G` must be a 2-group.\n    *   **Abelianization:** The abelianization of `G` is `G/[G,G] ≅ C₂ × C₂ × C₂`. Any homomorphism from `G` to an abelian group must factor through its abelianization.\n\n4.  **Analyzing Each Possible Image Group**\n    We now check which of the transitive subgroups of `S₄` can be a homomorphic image of `G`.\n\n    *   **`A₄` and `S₄`:** The orders of `A₄` (12) and `S₄` (24) are not powers of 2. Since any finite quotient of `G` must be a 2-group, there are no surjective homomorphisms from `G` to `A₄` or `S₄`. Thus, these cannot be the image of the action.\n\n    *   **`C₄`:** `C₄` is an abelian group. Any homomorphism `φ: G → C₄` must factor through the abelianization `G/[G,G] ≅ C₂³`. The image of any element from `C₂³` in `C₄` must have an order dividing 2. The only subgroup of `C₄` with this property is its unique subgroup of order 2, `C₂`. An image of size 2 cannot act transitively on 4 elements. Therefore, `Im(φ)` cannot be `C₄`.\n\n    *   **`V₄` and `D₄`:** The orders of `V₄` (4 = 2²) and `D₄` (8 = 2³) are powers of 2. These are the only remaining possibilities for the image of the homomorphism `φ`.\n\n### Counting the Subgroups\n\nWe count the subgroups based on these two possible image types.\n\n**Case 1: Image is `V₄` (Klein four-group)**\nLet `H` be a subgroup of index 4 such that its corresponding action has image `V₄`. This means `G/core(H) ≅ V₄`, where `core(H)` is the kernel of the action. The index `[G:core(H)]` is 4. Since `[G:H]` is also 4 and `core(H) ⊆ H`, we must have `H = core(H)`. This means `H` is a normal subgroup of `G` with `G/H ≅ V₄`.\n\nTo count these subgroups, we count the number of distinct kernels of surjective homomorphisms `φ: G → V₄`.\n*   Since `V₄` is abelian, these homomorphisms factor through `G/[G,G] ≅ C₂³`. So we need to count surjective homomorphisms `ψ: C₂³ → V₄`.\n*   A map from `C₂³` (a 3D vector space over `F₂`) to `V₄` (a 2D vector space over `F₂`) is a linear map. The number of surjective linear maps can be calculated. The total number of linear maps is `|V₄|^dim(C₂³)=4³ = 64`. The non-surjective maps have an image of dimension 0 or 1. There is 1 map with a 0D image (the zero map). There are 3 distinct 1D subspaces in `V₄`, and for each, there are `2³-1 = 7` non-zero maps into it. So, there are `1 + 3×7 = 22` non-surjective maps. The number of surjective maps is `64 - 22 = 42`.\n*   Two homomorphisms `ψ₁` and `ψ₂` have the same kernel if and only if `ψ₂ = α ∘ ψ₁` for some automorphism `α ∈ Aut(V₄)`. The group `Aut(V₄)` is isomorphic to `GL(2, F₂)` and has order 6.\n*   The number of distinct kernels is the number of surjective maps divided by the order of the automorphism group: `42 / 6 = 7`.\n*   Therefore, there are **7 normal subgroups** of index 4.\n\n**Case 2: Image is `D₄` (Dihedral group of order 8)**\nLet `H` be a subgroup of index 4 such that its corresponding action has image `D₄`.\n*   The kernel of the action, `N = core(H)`, is a normal subgroup of `G` with `G/N ≅ D₄`. The index of `N` is `[G:N] = |D₄| = 8`.\n*   The subgroup `H` contains `N`. The index relation gives `[G:N] = [G:H][H:N]`, so `8 = 4 × [H:N]`, which implies `[H:N] = 2`.\n*   This means `H` corresponds to a subgroup of index 2 in `G/N ≅ D₄`. Conversely, any subgroup of `D₄` of index 2 gives rise to a subgroup `H` of `G` of index 4. However, we must consider all such normal subgroups `N`.\n*   A fundamental result about the Grigorchuk group is that it has a **unique** normal subgroup `N` of index 8 for which the quotient `G/N` is isomorphic to `D₄`.\n*   Therefore, all subgroups `H` of this type must contain this unique normal subgroup `N`. To count them, we need to count the subgroups of `G/N ≅ D₄` that have index `[G:H] / [G:N] = 4/8`... wait, the index of `H/N` in `G/N` is `[G/N : H/N] = [G:H] = 4`. This is incorrect. The index of `H/N` in `G/N` is `[G:N]/[H:N]`. Wait, let's use the index formula: `[G:N] = [G:H][H:N]`. So `H` corresponds to `H/N`, which is a subgroup of `G/N`. `[G/N : H/N] = [G:H]=4`.\n    `|G/N| / |H/N| = 4`, so `8 / |H/N| = 4`, which implies `|H/N|=2`.\n*   We need to count the number of subgroups of order 2 in `D₄`. The elements of `D₄ = <r,s | r⁴=s²=1, srs=r⁻¹>` are `{e, r, r², r³, s, sr, sr², sr³}`. The elements of order 2 are `r²` and the four reflections `s, sr, sr², sr³`. There are 5 such elements, and each generates a unique subgroup of order 2.\n*   So there are 5 subgroups of `D₄` of order 2. These correspond to **5** subgroups of `G` of index 4 containing `N`.\n*   One of these subgroups of `D₄`, `<r²>`, is the center and is normal in `D₄`. The corresponding subgroup `H₁` in `G` is therefore normal. For this `H₁`, the quotient is `G/H₁ ≅ (G/N)/(H₁/N) ≅ D₄/<r²> ≅ V₄`. This normal subgroup is therefore one of the 7 we already counted in Case 1.\n*   The other 4 subgroups of `D₄` of order 2 are not normal. These correspond to **4 non-normal subgroups** of `G` of index 4. These are distinct from the 7 normal subgroups found earlier.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   From Case 1, we found 7 normal subgroups of index 4.\n*   From Case 2, we found 4 non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n*   The total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of these two counts.\n\nTotal = 7 (normal) + 4 (non-normal) = 11.\n\nFinal Answer: The Grigorchuk group has 11 subgroups of index 4.\n\n<<<11>>>"
