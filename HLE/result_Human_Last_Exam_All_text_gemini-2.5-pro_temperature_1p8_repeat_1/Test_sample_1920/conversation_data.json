    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the conductor $d$\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   We can test for small prime factors:\n    *   $53599$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n    *   $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$. So, $7$ is a factor.\n    *   Now we factor $7657$. $\\sqrt{7657} \\approx 87.5$. We test primes up to 87.\n    *   $7657 \\div 13 = 589$. So, $13$ is a factor.\n    *   Now we factor $589$. $\\sqrt{589} \\approx 24.2$. We test primes up to 23.\n    *   $589 \\div 19 = 31$. So, $19$ is a factor, and $31$ is prime.\n*   The prime factorization of $d$ is:\n    $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n    The conductor is a product of distinct odd primes (it is \"square-free\").\n\n### Step 2: Understand the structure of Dirichlet characters for a composite conductor\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the group of invertible residues modulo $d$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, can be decomposed into a direct product of groups modulo its prime factors:\n$(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/19\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/31\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\n\nThis isomorphism implies that the group of Dirichlet characters modulo $d$ also decomposes into a direct product:\nAny character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi_p$ modulo the prime factors of $d$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p$.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the character's properties (primitivity, order) to its components\n*   **Primitivity:** For a character $\\chi$ with a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$, it is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p_i}$ is non-trivial (i.e., not the principal character). A non-trivial character modulo a prime $p$ has conductor $p$. The conductor of the product character is the product of the conductors of the components, so $\\text{cond}(\\chi) = \\prod \\text{cond}(\\chi_{p_i}) = \\prod p_i = d$.\n*   **Order:** The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{order}(\\chi_7), \\text{order}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{order}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{order}(\\chi_{31}))$.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the counting problem\nWe are looking for the number of tuples of non-trivial characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that the least common multiple of their orders is exactly 6.\n\nFor a prime $p$, the group of characters modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The order of any character $\\chi_p$ must divide $p-1$. Let's list the relevant group orders:\n*   mod 7: $\\phi(7) = 6$\n*   mod 13: $\\phi(13) = 12$\n*   mod 19: $\\phi(19) = 18$\n*   mod 31: $\\phi(31) = 30$\n\nThe condition that $\\text{lcm}(\\text{orders}) = 6$ implies two things:\n1.  The order of each component character $\\chi_p$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set of orders cannot all be divisors of 3 (at least one must be even), and they cannot all be divisors of 2 (at least one must be a multiple of 3).\n\n### Step 5: Use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion\nWe can count the characters by finding the total number whose orders divide 6, and then subtracting the ones whose orders are proper divisors of 6 (i.e., divide 3 or 2).\n\nLet $N(k)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $d$ whose order divides $k$. The number of characters of order exactly 6 is:\n$N(\\text{order}=6) = N(\\text{order}|6) - N(\\text{order}|3) - N(\\text{order}|2) + N(\\text{order}|1)$.\nA character of order 1 is the principal character, which is not primitive for $d>1$, so $N(\\text{order}|1)=0$. Therefore, we have:\n$N(\\text{order}=6) = N(\\text{order}|6) - N(\\text{order}|3) - N(\\text{order}|2)$.\n\nTo calculate $N(\\text{order}|k)$: a primitive character $\\chi=\\prod \\chi_p$ has order dividing $k$ if and only if each component $\\chi_p$ has order dividing $k$. For primitivity, each $\\chi_p$ must be non-trivial. The number of characters modulo $p$ whose order divides $k$ is $\\gcd(k, p-1)$. We subtract 1 to exclude the trivial character. So, for each prime factor $p$, the number of choices is $\\gcd(k, p-1)-1$.\n\n$N(\\text{order}|k) = \\prod_{p|d} (\\gcd(k, p-1) - 1)$\n\n**Calculation for $k=6$**:\nThe number of primitive characters with order dividing 6 is:\n$N(\\text{order}|6) = (\\gcd(6, 6)-1) \\times (\\gcd(6, 12)-1) \\times (\\gcd(6, 18)-1) \\times (\\gcd(6, 30)-1)$\n$= (6-1) \\times (6-1) \\times (6-1) \\times (6-1) = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 625$.\n\n**Calculation for $k=3$**:\nThe number of primitive characters with order dividing 3 is:\n$N(\\text{order}|3) = (\\gcd(3, 6)-1) \\times (\\gcd(3, 12)-1) \\times (\\gcd(3, 18)-1) \\times (\\gcd(3, 30)-1)$\n$= (3-1) \\times (3-1) \\times (3-1) \\times (3-1) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n(Note: a character in this set has order $\\text{lcm}(\\text{orders of components})$. Since each component has order dividing 3 and is non-trivial, each component has order 3. Thus the lcm is 3. All 16 of these characters have order 3).\n\n**Calculation for $k=2$**:\nThe number of primitive characters with order dividing 2 is:\n$N(\\text{order}|2) = (\\gcd(2, 6)-1) \\times (\\gcd(2, 12)-1) \\times (\\gcd(2, 18)-1) \\times (\\gcd(2, 30)-1)$\n$= (2-1) \\times (2-1) \\times (2-1) \\times (2-1) = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n(Note: Similar to the above, this one character has order 2).\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion formula:\nNumber of characters of order 6 = $N(\\text{order}|6) - N(\\text{order}|3) - N(\\text{order}|2)$\n$= 625 - 16 - 1 = 608$."
