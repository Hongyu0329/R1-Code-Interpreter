    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the range of verses (bayts) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Poem's Structure**: The poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' is a concise and structured text on Islamic creed. It begins with praise for Allah, then covers His necessary, impossible, and possible attributes. Following this, it moves on to the articles of faith concerning the Prophets.\n\n2.  **Locate the Beginning of the Section on Prophets**: The section about the prophets starts after the discussion of Allah's attributes. The poet, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, first states the obligation of knowing the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an. This is found in Bayt (verse) 27:\n    *   **Bayt 27**: `تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ *** كُلُّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ`\n    *   **Translation**: *The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding for every accountable person, so verify and seize the benefit.*\n    *   **Note**: This verse introduces the list but does not contain any of the prophets' names.\n\n3.  **Identify the First Verse Containing Names**: The actual listing of the prophets' names begins immediately in the following verse.\n    *   **Bayt 28**: `هُمْ آدَمٌ ادْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ *** صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ`\n    *   **Translation**: *They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.*\n    *   **Conclusion**: Therefore, the enumeration of the names starts at **Bayt 28**.\n\n4.  **Trace the Listing Through to the End**: We must now find the last verse that contains names from this list. The poem continues listing them over the next few verses:\n    *   **Bayt 29**: Mentions Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 30**: Mentions Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n    *   **Bayt 31**: `إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى *** عِيسَى وَطٰهٰ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا`\n    *   **Translation**: *Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a title for Prophet Muhammad), the Seal; leave misguidance.*\n    *   **Conclusion**: This verse concludes the list of the 25 prophets. Therefore, the list ends at **Bayt 31**.\n\n5.  **Final Determination of the Range**: Based on the analysis, the names of the prophets are mentioned starting from Bayt 28 and ending at Bayt 31.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Verse Numbering**: The verse numbering (27, 28, 29, 30, 31) is the most common and standard one found in widely published editions and commentaries. However, very minor variations could exist in rare manuscripts, but the content and sequence of the verses remain the same.\n2.  **The Introductory Verse vs. The List**: A key point is to distinguish between the verse that introduces the topic (Bayt 27) and the verses that actually contain the names. The question specifically asks for where the *names are mentioned*, which begins at Bayt 28.\n3.  **References to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)**: In the final verse of the list (Bayt 31), Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) is not mentioned by his most common name. Instead, he is referred to by the title 'Taha' (طٰهٰ), a name derived from the opening letters of the 20th chapter of the Qur'an, and by his role as the 'Khatim' (خَاتِمٌ), meaning the Seal of the Prophets.\n\n### Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe names of the prophets in Islam are mentioned in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' over a series of four bayts (verses). The enumeration starts in **Bayt 28** and concludes in **Bayt 31**.\n\n*   **Start**: Bayt 28 begins the list with \"هُمْ آدَمٌ...\" (They are Adam...).\n*   **End**: Bayt 31 completes the list, ending with \"...عِيسَى وَطٰهٰ خَاتِمٌ\" (...'Isa, and Taha, the Seal).\n\nTherefore, the specific range is from Bayt 28 to Bayt 31.\n\n<<<From Bayt 28 to Bayt 31>>>"
