    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the exact musical piece and section.**\nThe piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B♭ major, Op. 4\". We need to look at the very end of the final movement (4th Movement: Allegro con fuoco) in the orchestral score.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the first violin part.**\nIn a full orchestral score, the first violin part is typically labeled \"Violino I\" and is the top line of the string section.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the final measures for the first violin.**\nLooking at the score, the final measure consists of a single, sustained whole note. The measure just before the final one contains the last bit of fast melodic movement for the violins.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the \"three notes\" the part ends on.**\nThe question is slightly ambiguous, as the first violin plays a sequence of notes leading to the end. The final melodic flourish before the long, sustained final note is a descending run of four 16th notes. This run is B♭5 – G5 – F5 – D5. The most logical interpretation of \"the three notes\" it ends on is the last three notes of this final run before the concluding sustained note.\n\n**Step 5: List the last three notes of the final flourish.**\nThe last three notes of the sequence B♭5 – G5 – F5 – D5 are:\n1.  G5\n2.  F5\n3.  D5\n\n**Step 6: Compare the pitches to find the lowest one.**\nWe need to compare the pitches of G5, F5, and D5. All three notes are in the same octave (the octave starting on the C above middle C).\n*   In the musical scale, D is the lowest.\n*   F is higher than D.\n*   G is higher than F.\n\nTherefore, of the three notes G5, F5, and D5, the note D5 is the lowest one.\n\n<<<D>>>"
