    "This question asks for a characterization of a specific class of finite groups: the finite filled nilpotent groups. To solve this, we must break down the definitions and connect them using key theorems from group theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Definitions**\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A set with a binary operation satisfying the group axioms, with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A non-empty subset `S ⊆ G` such that for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (possibly `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written succinctly as `S² ∩ S = ∅`.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPFS):** A product-free set `S` such that it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. In other words, if you add any element `g ∈ G \\ S` to `S`, the new set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called filled if the union of all its MIPFSs is equal to `G` itself. That is, `G = ∪ S_i`, where `{S_i}` is the collection of all MIPFSs in `G`.\n*   **Finite Nilpotent Group:** A finite group that is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. This is a very strong structural property.\n\n**2. Careful Points and Initial Observations**\n\n*   **The Identity Element Problem:** Let `e` be the identity element of `G`. Can `e` be in a product-free set `S`? If `e ∈ S`, then for that same element `x=e ∈ S`, the product `e·e = e` is also in `S`. This violates the condition `S² ∩ S = ∅`. Therefore, the identity element `e` can *never* be a member of any product-free set.\n*   **Consequence for the \"Filled\" Definition:** Since `e` is not in any product-free set, it cannot be in any MIPFS. Consequently, the union of all MIPFSs can never contain `e`. For the condition `∪ S_i = G` to hold, `G` must not contain `e`, which is only true for an empty set, not a group. This seems to lead to a contradiction where no group can be filled.\n*   **The Standard Convention:** In the study of product-free and sum-free sets, this issue is well-known. The definition of a \"filled group\" is almost always interpreted with this in mind. The implicit or standard definition becomes:\n    > A group `G` is filled if `G \\ {e} = ∪ S_i`, where `{S_i}` is the collection of all MIPFSs.\n    Under this refined definition, we ask: for which groups is every non-identity element part of at least one MIPFS?\n*   **The Trivial Group:** Let `G = {e}`. The set of non-identity elements `G \\ {e}` is the empty set `∅`. The only product-free set in `G` is the empty set `∅`. This is maximal by inclusion (since adding `e` makes it not product-free). So the union of all MIPFSs is `∅`. Thus, `∪ S_i = ∅ = G \\ {e}`, which means the trivial group **is a filled group**.\n\n**3. The Main Theorem**\n\nFor non-trivial finite groups, there is a fundamental theorem that characterizes filled groups. This result, proven by G.L. Walls, is the key to solving the problem.\n> **Theorem:** A non-trivial finite group `G` is filled if and only if `G` has no normal subgroups of index 2 or 3.\n\n**4. Applying the Theorem to Nilpotent Groups**\n\nWe now need to find which finite nilpotent groups have no normal subgroups of index 2 or 3.\n\n*   **Normal Subgroups and Quotients:** A group `G` has a normal subgroup `N` of index `k` if and only if there exists a surjective homomorphism `φ: G → H` to some group `H` of order `k`. For prime index `p`, this means `G` has a quotient group isomorphic to `C_p`, the cyclic group of order `p`.\n*   **Abelianization:** The existence of a surjective homomorphism from `G` to an abelian group (like `C_2` or `C_3`) is governed by the abelianization of `G`, which is the quotient group `G/[G,G]` where `[G,G]` is the commutator subgroup. Specifically, `G` has a normal subgroup of prime index `p` if and only if the order of its abelianization, `|G/[G,G]|`, is divisible by `p`.\n*   **Condition for a Filled Group:** Using the theorem and the point above, a non-trivial finite group `G` is filled if and only if `|G/[G,G]|` is not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3 (i.e., `gcd(|G/[G,G]|, 6) = 1`).\n\n**5. Structure of Finite Nilpotent Groups**\n\nNow we use the fact that `G` is nilpotent.\n*   Let `G` be a finite nilpotent group. `G` is the direct product of its Sylow `p`-subgroups: `G ≅ P₁ × P₂ × ... × P_k`, where `P_i` is the Sylow `p_i`-subgroup of `G`.\n*   The commutator subgroup `[G,G]` also respects this decomposition: `[G,G] ≅ [P₁, P₁] × [P₂, P₂] × ... × [Pk, Pk]`.\n*   Therefore, the abelianization is `G/[G,G] ≅ (P₁/[P₁, P₁]) × (P₂/[P₂, P₂]) × ... × (Pk/[Pk, Pk])`.\n*   The order of the abelianization is `|G/[G,G]| = |P₁/[P₁, P₁]| ⋅ |P₂/[P₂, P₂]| ⋅ ... ⋅ |Pk/[Pk, Pk]|`.\n*   For any non-trivial `p`-group `P`, its commutator subgroup `[P,P]` is a proper subgroup, meaning the abelianization `P/[P,P]` is a non-trivial `p`-group. Its order is `p^m` for some `m ≥ 1`.\n\n**6. Final Deduction**\n\n*   We require `|G/[G,G]|` to be coprime to 2. This means that if `G` has a Sylow 2-subgroup `P₂`, we must have `|P₂/[P₂, P₂]| = 1`. This only happens if `P₂` is the trivial group, `{e}`. Thus, the order of `G` cannot be divisible by 2.\n*   We also require `|G/[G,G]|` to be coprime to 3. This means that if `G` has a Sylow 3-subgroup `P₃`, we must have `|P₃/[P₃, P₃]| = 1`. This only happens if `P₃` is the trivial group, `{e}`. Thus, the order of `G` cannot be divisible by 3.\n*   Conversely, if the order of a finite nilpotent group `G` is not divisible by 2 or 3, then its Sylow 2-subgroup and Sylow 3-subgroup are both trivial. The order of its abelianization, `|G/[G,G]|`, will be a product of powers of primes `p ≥ 5`. This number is not divisible by 2 or 3. Therefore, `G` has no normal subgroups of index 2 or 3, and so `G` is a filled group.\n*   This condition also covers the trivial group `G={e}`, whose order is 1, which is not divisible by 2 or 3.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe finite filled nilpotent groups are precisely the finite nilpotent groups whose order is not divisible by 2 or 3. In other words, a finite nilpotent group `G` is a filled group if and only if all prime factors of its order `|G|` are greater than or equal to 5.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if the order of G is not divisible by 2 or 3.>>>"
