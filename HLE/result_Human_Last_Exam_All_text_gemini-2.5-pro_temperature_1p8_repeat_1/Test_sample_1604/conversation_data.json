    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Artist and Her Relevant Works**\n\nThe artist in question is Elizabeth Southerden Thompson, famously known as Lady Butler (1846–1933). She was a prominent British painter renowned for her detailed and dramatic military scenes. To answer the question, we need to list her major paintings that depict specific battles or military campaigns and identify the historical event associated with each.\n\n### **Step 2: List Paintings and Identify the Corresponding Historical Battles/Events**\n\nHere is a list of some of Lady Butler's most famous military paintings and the historical events they depict:\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** **(painted 1875):** Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which took place on **June 16, 1815**, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!*** **(painted 1881):** Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on **June 18, 1815**.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** **(painted 1874):** Shows a roll call of the Grenadier Guards after the Battle of Inkerman, fought on **November 5, 1854**, during the Crimean War.\n*   ***Balaclava*** **(painted 1876):** Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava on **October 25, 1854**, also during the Crimean War.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** **(painted 1880):** Represents the battle at the Rorke's Drift mission station, which occurred on **January 22–23, 1879**, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** **(painted 1898):** Depicts the actions of Lieutenant Robert Elwes at the Battle of Laing's Nek on **January 28, 1881**, during the First Boer War.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** **(painted 1885):** Shows the British assault at the Battle of Tel El Kebir, fought on **September 13, 1882**, during the Anglo-Egyptian War.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** **(also known as *The Desert March, Gordon Relief Expedition*; painted c. 1890s):** This painting portrays the British Camel Corps during the Gordon Relief Expedition of **1884–1885**. This campaign, part of the Mahdist War, included several engagements, most notably the Battle of Abu Klea on **January 17, 1885**.\n\n### **Step 3: Compare the Dates of the Historical Events**\n\nNow, we arrange the battles in chronological order based on their historical date, not the date the painting was created.\n\n1.  **Battle of Quatre Bras:** June 16, 1815\n2.  **Battle of Waterloo:** June 18, 1815\n3.  **Battle of Balaclava:** October 25, 1854\n4.  **Battle of Inkerman:** November 5, 1854\n5.  **Battle of Rorke's Drift:** January 22–23, 1879\n6.  **Battle of Laing's Nek:** January 28, 1881\n7.  **Battle of Tel El Kebir:** September 13, 1882\n8.  **Battle of Abu Klea (Gordon Relief Expedition):** January 17, 1885\n\n### **Step 4: Identify the Latest Battle**\n\nBy comparing the dates, it is clear that the Gordon Relief Expedition (1884-1885) is the latest historical conflict depicted by Lady Butler among her major works. The most significant battle of that expedition's advance was the Battle of Abu Klea.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Painting Date vs. Event Date:** The question asks for the latest historical battle, not the latest painting. For example, *Floreat Etona!* was painted in 1898 but depicts an event from 1881.\n*   **Specific Battle vs. Campaign:** Some paintings depict a specific named battle (e.g., *Tel-el-Kebir*), while others show a scene from a larger campaign (e.g., *The Camel Corps*). In this case, the Gordon Relief Expedition campaign, which included the Battle of Abu Klea, is later than the Battle of Tel El Kebir.\n\n### **Final Answer Derivation**\n\nThe latest historical battle found among Lady Butler's paintings is the Battle of Abu Klea, which was part of the Gordon Relief Expedition during the Mahdist War.\n\nThe battle depicted in the painting *Tel-el-Kebir* occurred on September 13, 1882.\nThe battles of the Gordon Relief Expedition, depicted in the painting *The Camel Corps*, occurred between 1884 and 1885, with the Battle of Abu Klea taking place on January 17, 1885.\n\nSince 1885 is later than 1882, the latest battle is from the Gordon Relief Expedition.\n\n<<<Battle of Abu Klea>>>"
