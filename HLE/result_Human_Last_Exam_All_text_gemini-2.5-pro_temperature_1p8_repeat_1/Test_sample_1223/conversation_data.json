    "This problem asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of a specific topological space. Let's analyze the question step by step.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement**\n\n*   **The space X:** $X$ is a *hereditary indecomposable metric continuum*.\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space.\n    *   **Indecomposable** means it cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua.\n    *   **Hereditarily indecomposable** means every subcontinuum of $X$ is also indecomposable. A classic example is the pseudo-arc.\n*   **The point x:** $x$ is an arbitrary point in $X$.\n*   **The space Y:** We consider the space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Since $X$ is a compact metric space, $Y$ is a locally compact, non-compact, and separable metric space.\n*   **The Stone-Cech Compactification:** We consider $\\beta Y$, the Stone-Cech compactification of $Y$.\n*   **The Stone-Cech Remainder:** We are interested in the remainder, $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n*   **The Quantity to Find:** The \"maximum possible number of composants\" of $Y^*$.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Term \"Composant\"**\n\nThe term \"composant\" is a technical term in continuum theory. For a point $p$ in an indecomposable continuum $K$, the composant of $p$ is the set of all points $q$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$.\n\nThere are two main interpretations of the question:\n1.  **\"Composant\" as a typo for \"Connected Component\":** If the question meant \"connected component\", we can use a general theorem about compactifications. $X$ is a compactification of $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ with a single point remainder $\\{x\\}$. There is a continuous surjective map $\\pi: \\beta Y \\to X$ that is the identity on $Y$. This map takes the remainder $Y^*$ to the remainder $\\{x\\}$. A fundamental theorem states that the preimage of a point under this canonical map is connected. Therefore, $\\pi^{-1}(x) = Y^*$ is a connected, compact space (a continuum). A connected space has exactly **1** connected component. This interpretation, however, ignores the very strong and specific hypothesis that $X$ is *hereditarily indecomposable*.\n\n2.  **\"Composant\" in its technical sense:** This interpretation assumes the question is from continuum theory and uses the term precisely. This requires us to analyze whether the remainder $Y^*$ is an indecomposable continuum itself. The strong hypotheses on $X$ make this interpretation highly probable.\n\nWe will proceed with the second, more likely interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Topological Nature of the Remainder $Y^*$**\n\n*   As established in the first interpretation, the remainder $Y^*$ is a continuum (compact and connected).\n*   A deep and relevant theorem by H. Cook (1970) states that if $C$ is a subcontinuum of a hereditarily indecomposable continuum $X$, then the Stone-Cech remainder $\\beta(X \\setminus C) \\setminus (X \\setminus C)$ is also a hereditarily indecomposable continuum.\n*   In our case, $C = \\{x\\}$ is a subcontinuum of $X$.\n*   Therefore, the remainder $Y^* = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is a **hereditarily indecomposable continuum**.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Composants of the Remainder $Y^*$**\n\nSince $Y^*$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum, it is partitioned by its composants. We need to determine how many such a space has.\n\n*   **Metric Case:** A classical theorem by Mazurkiewicz states that any non-degenerate *metric* indecomposable continuum has $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum) many composants.\n*   **Non-Metric Case:** Our remainder $Y^*$ is not metrizable. $\\beta Y$ is not first-countable for a non-compact space $Y$, so it cannot be a metric space. For a general non-metric indecomposable continuum $K$, it is a long-standing conjecture (and true for all known examples) that the number of composants is equal to the cardinality of the space itself, $|K|$.\n\nWe will proceed under the standard assumption that the number of composants of $Y^*$ is equal to its cardinality, $|Y^*|$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Cardinality of the Remainder $|Y^*|$**\n\nWe need to find the cardinality of $Y^* = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n\n*   The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a separable metric space. Any such space has cardinality $|Y| \\le c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. Since $X$ is a non-degenerate continuum, $|X|=c$, so $|Y|=c$.\n*   Metric spaces are realcompact.\n*   A key theorem in the theory of Stone-Cech compactifications states that for any non-compact, locally compact, realcompact space $Y$, the cardinality of its remainder is given by $|Y^*| = 2^{|Y|}$.\n*   Substituting $|Y|=c$, we find the cardinality of the remainder:\n    $|Y^*| = 2^c = 2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n\nCombining the steps:\n1.  The question most likely uses \"composant\" in its technical sense from continuum theory.\n2.  The remainder $Y^*$ is a hereditarily indecomposable continuum.\n3.  The number of composants of such a continuum is its cardinality.\n4.  The cardinality of $Y^*$ is $2^c = 2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$.\n\nThis result does not depend on the specific choice of the hereditarily indecomposable metric continuum $X$ or the point $x$. Therefore, the number of composants is constant for all spaces satisfying the problem's conditions. The \"maximum possible number\" is this constant value.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"Composant\":** The primary challenge is correctly interpreting this term. The context of \"hereditary indecomposability\" strongly suggests the technical meaning.\n*   **Properties of the Remainder:** One must know or deduce that the remainder is (a) a continuum, (b) indecomposable, (c) non-metric, and (d) of a specific cardinality. This requires recalling several advanced theorems.\n*   **Cardinality Calculation:** The formula $|Y^*|=2^{|Y|}$ is crucial and relies on $Y$ being a realcompact space (which is true for metric spaces).\n*   **Number of Composants in the Non-Metric Case:** The fact that the number of composants is equal to the cardinality of the space is a standard result for all known examples, although it remains an open question in its full generality. For the purpose of answering such a question, this standard result is assumed.\n\nThe maximum possible number of a composant is the cardinality of the remainder space, which is $2^c$ or $2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$.\n\n<<<2^(2^aleph_0)>>>"
