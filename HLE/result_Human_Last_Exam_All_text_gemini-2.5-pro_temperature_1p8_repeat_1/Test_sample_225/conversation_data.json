    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and the Curve**\n\nThe curve is given by the parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nThis is a specific type of curve known as a Lissajous curve. A self-intersection point is a point (x, y) on the curve that is reached at two or more distinct time values, say t1 and t2, within the fundamental period of the curve.\n\nThe period of x(t) = cos(9t) is T_x = 2π/9.\nThe period of y(t) = sin(5t) is T_y = 2π/5.\nThe curve completes a full cycle over the least common multiple of T_x and T_y, which is LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π.\nSo, we are looking for self-intersections for t in the interval [0, 2π).\n\nA self-intersection occurs for t1 ≠ t2 in [0, 2π) such that:\ncos(9*t1) = cos(9*t2)\nsin(5*t1) = sin(5*t2)\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Intersections**\n\nThe self-intersection points can be categorized into two types:\n1.  **Interior points:** Points where both x and y coordinates are non-zero.\n2.  **Points on the axes:** Points where either the x or y coordinate is zero.\n\nWe will calculate the number of points in each category and sum them up. The curve is defined within the rectangle [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]. The \"axes\" here refer to the x-axis (y=0) and y-axis (x=0) within this rectangle.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Interior Intersections**\n\nFor Lissajous curves of the form x=cos(at), y=sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, there's a standard formula for the number of interior self-intersection points:\nN_interior = (a-1)(b-1) / 2\n\nIn our case, a = 9 and b = 5. They are coprime.\nN_interior = (9-1)(5-1) / 2 = (8)(4) / 2 = 16.\n\nSo there are 16 self-intersection points not on the x or y axes.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Intersections on the Axes**\n\n**a) Intersections on the x-axis (y=0)**\n\nAn intersection on the x-axis means y=0 at two different times, but the x-value is the same.\nSet y(t) = 0:\nsin(5t) = 0 => 5t = kπ for some integer k.\nt = kπ/5\nFor t in [0, 2π), the possible values for k are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n\nWe now need to find pairs of these times (t1, t2) where x(t1) = x(t2). Let t1 = k1π/5 and t2 = k2π/5 with k1 ≠ k2.\ncos(9*k1π/5) = cos(9*k2π/5)\nThis equality holds if 9*k1π/5 = ±9*k2π/5 + 2jπ for some integer j.\nDividing by π, we get 9k1/5 = ±9k2/5 + 2j, which simplifies to 9(k1 ∓ k2) = 10j.\nSince 9 and 10 are coprime, (k1 ∓ k2) must be a multiple of 10.\n-   If k1 - k2 is a multiple of 10, e.g., k1 - k2 = 10, it's not possible with k1, k2 in {0,...,9}.\n-   If k1 + k2 is a multiple of 10. Since 0 ≤ k1 < k2 ≤ 9, their sum is between 1 and 17. So, we must have k1 + k2 = 10.\n\nThe pairs (k1, k2) that sum to 10 are:\n(1, 9), (2, 8), (3, 7), (4, 6).\nEach of these 4 pairs corresponds to a unique self-intersection point on the x-axis. The points are (cos(9π/5), 0), (cos(18π/5), 0), (cos(27π/5), 0), (cos(36π/5), 0).\nSo, N_xaxis = 4.\n\n**b) Intersections on the y-axis (x=0)**\n\nAn intersection on the y-axis means x=0 at two different times, but the y-value is the same.\nSet x(t) = 0:\ncos(9t) = 0 => 9t = π/2 + kπ = (2k+1)π/2 for some integer k.\nt = (2k+1)π/18\nFor t in [0, 2π), the possible values for k are {0, 1, 2, ..., 17}.\n\nWe need to find pairs of these times (t1, t2) where y(t1) = y(t2). Let t1=(2k1+1)π/18 and t2=(2k2+1)π/18.\nsin(5t1) = sin(5t2)\nThis equality holds if 5t1 = 5t2 + 2jπ (which implies t1=t2) or 5t1 = π - 5t2 + 2jπ.\nUsing the second case:\n5(t1 + t2) = (2j+1)π\n5 * [ (2k1+1)π/18 + (2k2+1)π/18 ] = (2j+1)π\n5 * [ (2k1 + 2k2 + 2)π/18 ] = (2j+1)π\n5 * (k1 + k2 + 1) / 9 = 2j+1\n5(k1 + k2 + 1) = 9(2j+1)\n\nSince 5 and 9 are coprime, (k1+k2+1) must be a multiple of 9. Let k1+k2+1 = 9q.\nAs 0 ≤ k1 < k2 ≤ 17, we have 1 ≤ k1+k2+1 ≤ 34.\nSo, the possible values for 9q are 9, 18, 27.\nAlso, 9(2j+1) must be a multiple of 5. This requires (2j+1) to be a multiple of 5. So, q = (9(2j+1))/5 requires q to be a multiple of 9.\nThis is incorrect. The reasoning should be: 5(k1+k2+1)=9(2j+1). So (k1+k2+1) is a multiple of 9, AND (2j+1) is a multiple of 5.\n-   Let k1+k2+1 = 9. Then k1+k2 = 8. The pairs (k1, k2) with k1<k2 from {0..17} are (0,8), (1,7), (2,6), (3,5). This gives 4 pairs.\n-   Let k1+k2+1 = 18 (not possible as 18 is not odd multiple of 9 for RHS)\n-   Let k1+k2+1 = 27. Then k1+k2 = 26. The pairs are (9,17), (10,16), (11,15), (12,14). This gives 4 pairs.\n-   Let k1+k2+1 = 36 (not possible).\n\nWe have a total of 4 + 4 = 8 pairs. These pairs generate 8 distinct intersection points on the y-axis.\nSo, N_yaxis = 8.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Number of Intersections**\n\nThe total number of self-intersection points is the sum of the points from each category.\nN_total = N_interior + N_xaxis + N_yaxis\nN_total = 16 + 4 + 8\nN_total = 28\n\nThe curve has 28 distinct self-intersection points.\n\n<<<28>>>"
