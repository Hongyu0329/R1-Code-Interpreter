    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question lies in the relationship between \"overturning a reverse turn\" and the fundamental \"technique\" of a specific dance. \"Overturning\" means turning more than the standard amount. A \"reverse turn\" is a standard figure involving a turn to the left. The key phrase is \"without disregarding the technique,\" which means we are looking for a dance where the very rules and principles of its movement make excessive rotation impossible. If you were to add more rotation, you would have to break the foundational rules of that dance.\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"Swing\" Dances (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep):**\n    *   **Common Technique:** These four dances are known as \"swing dances.\" Their technique is built upon generating momentum through the body, known as \"body swing.\" This swing, combined with principles like Contra Body Movement (CBM), sway, and rise and fall, creates a powerful, flowing, and rotational movement.\n    *   **Overturning in Swing Dances:** In these dances, rotation is a direct product of swing. To create more rotation (to overturn), a dancer would simply apply more swing, more sway, or more rise. While this might be difficult to control or look unrefined, it is an *exaggeration* of the existing technique, not a violation of it. The technique itself provides the tools to turn more. Therefore, in Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, it is technically possible to overturn a reverse turn without fundamentally disregarding the technique.\n\n3.  **Analyze the European Tango:**\n    *   **Unique Technique:** The Tango stands apart from the swing dances. Its technique is characterized by sharp, staccato movements, and it is a \"walking\" or \"marching\" dance. Crucially, Tango has **no rise and fall** and **no body swing**. The dancers maintain a constant level, with flexed knees, moving with a \"cat-like\" stealth. The feet are picked up and placed deliberately, rather than gliding from the momentum of a swing.\n    *   **Overturning in Tango:** A reverse turn in Tango is executed with sharp, clipped actions. Rotation is generated from a twisting of the body and swivels on the feet, but always in a grounded manner. To \"overturn\" this turn—to add significant extra rotation—a dancer would need to spin. Spinning requires rising onto the ball of the foot and using momentum, which would introduce \"rise and fall\" and a form of \"swing,\" both of which are fundamentally against the rules of Tango technique. The sharp close of the feet in many Tango turns also acts as a physical \"stop\" to rotation. Therefore, to overturn a reverse turn in Tango, one *must* disregard the core technical principles of the dance (no rise and fall, no swing).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAmong the given options, the European Tango is the only dance where the fundamental technique—specifically the absence of swing and rise and fall—makes it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without violating those core principles.\n\n<<<C>>>"
