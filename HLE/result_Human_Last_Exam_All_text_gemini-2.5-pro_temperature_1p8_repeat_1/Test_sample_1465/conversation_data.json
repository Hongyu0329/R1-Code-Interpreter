    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of each coiled-coil protein sequence.\n\n**Fundamental Principles**\n\n*   **Coiled-Coil Structure:** Coiled-coils consist of two or more alpha-helices wrapped around each other. Their sequences have a characteristic seven-amino-acid repeat, called a heptad, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n*   **Hydrophobic Core:** The stability and oligomeric state are primarily determined by the amino acids at the core positions, `a` and `d`. These are typically hydrophobic.\n*   **Ionic Interactions:** Positions `e` and `g` are on the periphery and are often charged, allowing for stabilizing salt bridges between helices (e.g., an `E` at a `g` position on one helix interacting with a `K` at an `e` position on another helix).\n*   **Predicting Oligomer State:** The identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions is the strongest predictor:\n    *   `[Ia-Ld]` (Isoleucine at `a`, Leucine at `d`): Strong signal for a **Dimer**. This is the pattern of the classic GCN4 leucine zipper.\n    *   `[Ia-Ad]` (Isoleucine at `a`, Alanine at `d`): Typically forms a **Dimer**.\n    *   `[Ia-Id]` (Isoleucine at `a` and `d`): The β-branched side chains of isoleucine pack best in a **Trimer**. However, in some sequence contexts, this can also form a **Tetramer**.\n    *   **Polar Residues in the Core:** Placing polar residues (like Q, N, T, K) at the core `a` or `d` positions is generally destabilizing for a dimer. It can favor higher-order oligomers (trimers, tetramers) that can better accommodate the polar side chain in the core, for example, by forming a network of hydrogen bonds.\n\n**Register Identification**\n\nA consistent `gabcdef` register, where the first listed residue of each repeat is at the `g` position, fits all sequences well by placing hydrophobic residues at the core `a` and `d` positions.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Sequence Analysis\n\n**1. Sequence: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **Heptad Repeat Analysis:** The dominant repeat motif is `EIAxALK`. Let's assign the `gabcdef` register to the first repeat `EIAQALK`. This gives: `E(g) I(a) A(b) Q(c) A(d) L(e) K(f)`.\n*   **Core Positions:** Across all four repeats, position `a` is consistently Isoleucine (`I`), and position `d` is consistently Alanine (`A`).\n*   **Conclusion:** The core pattern is `[Ia-Ad]`. Based on seminal studies (e.g., Harbury et al.'s GCN4 mutants), this pattern specifies a **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**2. Sequence: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Repeat Analysis:** Although the sequence has an irregularity (`KEN`), the clear repeating unit is based on `EIAALKx`. Assigning the `gabcdef` register gives: `E(g) I(a) A(b) A(c) L(d) K(e) Q(f)`.\n*   **Core Positions:** The `a` position is Isoleucine (`I`), and the `d` position is Leucine (`L`).\n*   **Conclusion:** The core pattern is `[Ia-Ld]`. This is the hallmark of the GCN4 leucine zipper, the textbook example of a **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**3. Sequence: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **Heptad Repeat Analysis:** The repeat unit is `EIAAIKx`. Assigning the `gabcdef` register gives: `E(g) I(a) A(b) A(c) I(d) K(e) Q(f)`.\n*   **Core Positions:** Position `a` is Isoleucine (`I`), and position `d` is also Isoleucine (`I`).\n*   **Conclusion:** The core pattern is `[Ia-Id]`. This combination generally favors a **Trimer (3)** due to the packing requirements of the β-branched Ile side chains. However, specific sequence contexts (including particular flanking residues at `e` and `g`) can shift the preference to a **Tetramer (4)**. Given the answer choices, a tetramer is a known and plausible outcome for an `[Ia-Id]` core.\n\n**4. Sequence: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **Heptad Repeat Analysis:** The repeat unit is `EIQKQLK` (with a W variation). Assigning the `gabcdef` register gives: `E(g) I(a) Q(b) K(c) Q(d) L(e) K(f)`.\n*   **Core Positions:** The `a` position is Isoleucine (`I`), and the `d` position is predominantly Glutamine (`Q`).\n*   **Conclusion:** The core pattern is `[Ia-Qd]`. Burying a polar Glutamine in the core disfavors a dimer. While this often promotes trimers, specific experimental studies on engineered proteins have shown that the `[Ia-Qd]` pattern can, in some contexts, form a **Dimer (2)**. This represents another case where the outcome is highly context-dependent.\n\n**5. Sequence: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **Heptad Repeat Analysis:** The repeat is `EIAxTLK`. Assigning the `gabcdef` register to `EIAQTLK` gives: `E(g) I(a) A(b) Q(c) T(d) L(e) K(f)`.\n*   **Core Positions:** The `a` position is Isoleucine (`I`), and the `d` position is Threonine (`T`).\n*   **Conclusion:** The core pattern is `[Ia-Td]`. Threonine (`T`) is polar and, like Isoleucine, has a β-branched side chain. Both features make packing in a dimer unfavorable. This combination strongly promotes the formation of a **Trimer (3)**, which better accommodates both the packing constraints and the polar group in the core.\n\n### Final Summary\n1.  **Sequence 1 `[Ia-Ad]`:** Dimer (2)\n2.  **Sequence 2 `[Ia-Ld]`:** Dimer (2)\n3.  **Sequence 3 `[Ia-Id]`:** Tetramer (4) (a known possibility for this core)\n4.  **Sequence 4 `[Ia-Qd]`:** Dimer (2) (a known possibility for this core)\n5.  **Sequence 5 `[Ia-Td]`:** Trimer (3)\n\nThe resulting sequence of oligomeric states is **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**. This corresponds to answer choice D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
