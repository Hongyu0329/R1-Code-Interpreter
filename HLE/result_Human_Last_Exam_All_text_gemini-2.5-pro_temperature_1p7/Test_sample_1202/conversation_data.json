    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** Duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes. Gene duplication is a primary source of new genetic material and is common in eukaryotes.\n    *   **Process 1: Retention:** What causes the second copy of the gene to be kept in the genome instead of being lost? The default fate for a redundant gene is to be lost through mutation (pseudogenization), so retention implies some kind of selective advantage.\n    *   **Process 2: Divergence:** What causes the two gene copies to become different from each other over time in their DNA sequence and, consequently, their function?\n    *   **Goal:** Identify the single \"most likely\" mechanism among the choices that explains both retention and divergence.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. In the context of duplicated genes, it tends to make the copies more similar, not more different. This process, known as concerted evolution, counteracts divergence. Therefore, it is not a mechanism for divergence.\n\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one copy of a duplicated gene accumulates deleterious mutations and becomes non-functional (a pseudogene). This is the most common fate of a duplicate gene. However, it represents the *loss* of a functional gene, not its *retention* as a working gene. While the pseudogene sequence diverges from the functional gene, the mechanism does not explain the retention of two functional copies.\n\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. This model explains both:\n        *   **Retention:** The new beneficial function provides a selective advantage, ensuring the new copy is kept, and the original copy is kept for its essential ancestral function.\n        *   **Divergence:** The accumulation of mutations to create a new function inherently means the sequences diverge.\n        *   **Careful Point:** This model requires a rare gain-of-function mutation to occur before the gene copy is silenced by more common loss-of-function mutations.\n\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model assumes the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or expression patterns (i.e., it was pleiotropic). After duplication, each copy accumulates degenerative mutations that knock out *different* subfunctions. For example, copy 1 loses function B but keeps A, while copy 2 loses function A but keeps B. This model also explains both:\n        *   **Retention:** Both copies become essential because together they are required to carry out the full range of the ancestral gene's functions. Losing either one would be deleterious.\n        *   **Divergence:** The sequences diverge as different mutations accumulate in each copy, leading to specialization.\n        *   **Careful Point:** This model relies on complementary loss-of-function mutations, which are much more common than the gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization. This provides a more immediate and probable pathway to protect both copies from being lost.\n\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of species to fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a mechanism at the molecular level that explains how a specific duplicate gene is retained within a genome. It operates at the level of populations and species, not individual genes.\n\n3.  **Compare the Viable Options (C vs. D):**\n    *   Both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes.\n    *   The question asks for the \"**most likely**\" mechanism.\n    *   The primary challenge for a new duplicate gene is to avoid pseudogenization. Subfunctionalization provides a swift path to preservation. Because loss-of-function mutations are common, it's relatively likely that two copies will accumulate different inactivating mutations, making both necessary for survival. This effectively \"rescues\" the duplicate gene from being lost.\n    *   Neofunctionalization requires a rare beneficial gain-of-function mutation to occur in the small window of time before the redundant copy is silenced.\n    *   Therefore, many evolutionary biologists argue that subfunctionalization is a more common and thus \"more likely\" mechanism, at least for the initial retention of duplicate genes, which then creates the opportunity for longer-term divergence, which might even include later neofunctionalization. Given the options, subfunctionalization represents a more probable general mechanism.\n\n### Final Answer Determination\nBased on the analysis, Subfunctionalization (D) is considered the most likely mechanism because it relies on common mutational events (loss-of-function) to create a situation where both gene copies are essential, thus ensuring their retention and allowing for their subsequent divergence. This is seen as a more probable pathway than waiting for a rare gain-of-function mutation as required by neofunctionalization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
