    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Terminology\n\nFirst, we need to understand the terms used in the question:\n*   **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**: An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements $x, y$ have a least upper bound (or join), denoted $x \\vee y$. Any poset can be viewed as a category, and a functor from this category to another is a representation of the poset.\n*   **Functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$**: This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(j_1 \\to j_2): f(j_1) \\to f(j_2)$ to each relation $j_1 \\le j_2$, respecting composition and identities. The category of such functors is equivalent to the category of modules over the **incidence algebra** $KJ$.\n*   **Tame Functor**: The term \"tame\" usually describes a representation category (or an algebra), not an individual object (functor/module). An algebra is of **tame representation type** if its indecomposable modules can be classified and, for each dimension, fall into a finite number of one-parameter families. The modules belonging to these one-parameter families are typically called **regular modules**. It is a standard convention in Auslander-Reiten theory to distinguish these from the \"discrete\" preprojective and preinjective modules. Thus, it's highly probable that \"tame functor\" refers to an indecomposable regular representation of the poset $J$. Such functors exist only if the representation type of $J$ is tame (but not finite).\n*   **$n$-resolvable**: In homological algebra, a module $M$ is said to have a projective resolution of length $n$ if there exists an exact sequence $0 \\to P_n \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$, where each $P_i$ is a projective module. The minimal such $n$ is the projective dimension of $M$, denoted $\\text{pd}(M)$. The term \"$n$-resolvable\" in this context is best interpreted as having a projective dimension of at most $n$.\n\nRephrasing the question with this interpretation: **Let $J$ be an upper semilattice of tame representation type. What is the projective dimension of a regular indecomposable representation of $J$?**\n\n### Step 2: Applying the Structure Theory of Tame Upper Semilattices\n\nThe properties of being an upper semilattice and being of tame representation type are very restrictive. We need to use known classification theorems from representation theory.\n\n1.  A key result in the representation theory of semilattices (by R. Vila) provides a characterization of tame upper semilattices. It states that an upper semilattice is of tame representation type if and only if it is a disjoint union of an upper semilattice of finite representation type and one or more \"tame tree semilattices\".\n2.  An indecomposable representation must be supported on a single connected component of the poset. Since \"tame functors\" (regular representations) do not exist for posets of finite type, any such functor must be an indecomposable representation of one of the \"tame tree semilattice\" components.\n3.  A \"tree semilattice\" is an upper semilattice whose Hasse diagram is a tree. The classification further shows that the incidence algebra of a tame tree semilattice is Morita equivalent to a path algebra of a valued quiver whose underlying graph is an extended-Dynkin diagram (e.g., $\\tilde{A}_n, \\tilde{D}_n, \\tilde{E}_6, \\tilde{E}_7, \\tilde{E}_8$).\n\n### Step 3: Homological Properties of the Associated Algebras\n\nThe path algebras of quivers of extended-Dynkin type are known as the **tame hereditary algebras**. So, the problem reduces to finding the projective dimension of regular modules over a tame hereditary algebra.\n\n1.  Hereditary algebras are algebras with a global dimension of at most 1. This means every module that is not projective must have a projective dimension of exactly 1.\n2.  A classical result by Claus Michael Ringel in the representation theory of hereditary algebras states that all regular indecomposable modules are not projective.\n3.  Therefore, for any tame hereditary algebra, every regular indecomposable module has a projective dimension of exactly 1. This means there is a short exact sequence $0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to M \\to 0$ for any regular module $M$, where $P_0$ and $P_1$ are projective.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nFollowing the chain of reasoning:\n*   A \"tame functor\" is a regular indecomposable representation of $J$.\n*   Such a representation must live on a \"tame tree semilattice\" component of $J$.\n*   The representation theory of such a component is equivalent to that of a tame hereditary algebra.\n*   The regular modules of a tame hereditary algebra have a projective dimension of exactly 1.\n\nTherefore, a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is 1-resolvable.\n\nFinal check on careful points:\n*   The interpretation of \"tame functor\" and \"n-resolvable\" is crucial and seems plausible in the context of modern representation theory.\n*   The validity of the argument hinges on the structure theory of tame upper semilattices, which is a specialized but established result.\n*   The final step relies on the fundamental properties of tame hereditary algebras, which are cornerstone results in the field. The logic appears sound.\n\nThe value of $n$ for which a tame functor is $n$-resolvable is 1."
