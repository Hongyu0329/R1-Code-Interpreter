    "An analysis of the symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ involves finding the continuous group of transformations of variables that leave the set of solutions to the equations invariant. The dimension of this Lie group is the number of independent parameters that define these transformations.\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are given by:\n1.  Momentum Equation: $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  Incompressibility Condition: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ is the velocity field, $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ is the pressure, and $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity. The independent variables are time $t$ and space coordinates $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. The dependent variables are the velocity components $u_1, u_2, u_3$ and the pressure $p$.\n\nWe look for the Lie group of point symmetries. The dimension of this group is the dimension of its Lie algebra, which is found by identifying all linearly independent infinitesimal generators of these symmetries.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the symmetries and their contribution to the dimension of the group:\n\n**1. Time Translation (1 dimension)**\nThe equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$. Therefore, if $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}))$ is a solution, then so is $(\\mathbf{u}(t-c, \\mathbf{x}), p(t-c, \\mathbf{x}))$ for any constant $c$. This corresponds to a one-parameter group of time translations.\n*   Infinitesimal generator: $\\partial_t$\n*   Dimension contributed: 1\n\n**2. Space Translations (3 dimensions)**\nThe equations do not explicitly depend on the spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$. The domain is the entire $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Thus, if $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}))$ is a solution, so is $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{c}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}-\\mathbf{c}))$ for any constant vector $\\mathbf{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n*   Infinitesimal generators: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$\n*   Dimension contributed: 3\n\n**3. Spatial Rotations (3 dimensions)**\nThe equations are covariant under rotations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. A rotation transforms the coordinates $\\mathbf{x}$ and the vector field $\\mathbf{u}$, while the scalar pressure $p$ remains invariant at the corresponding point. For any rotation matrix $R \\in SO(3)$, if $(\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t), p(\\mathbf{x}, t))$ is a solution, then $(R\\mathbf{u}(R^{-1}\\mathbf{x}, t), p(R^{-1}\\mathbf{x}, t))$ is also a solution. The group of rotations $SO(3)$ is three-dimensional.\n*   Infinitesimal generators: $x_j \\partial_{x_k} - x_k \\partial_{x_j} + u_j \\partial_{u_k} - u_k \\partial_{u_j}$ for $(j,k) = (1,2), (2,3), (3,1)$.\n*   Dimension contributed: 3\n\n**4. Galilean Boosts (3 dimensions)**\nThe Navier-Stokes equations respect Galilean relativity. One can transform to a coordinate system moving with a constant velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ without changing the form of the equations. The transformation is:\n$t' = t$\n$\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{v}t$\n$\\mathbf{u}'(\\mathbf{x}', t') = \\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t) - \\mathbf{v}$\n$p'(\\mathbf{x}', t') = p(\\mathbf{x}, t)$\nSince the boost velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ can be any constant vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this is a three-parameter group of transformations.\n*   Infinitesimal generators: $t\\partial_{x_i} - \\partial_{u_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$.\n*   Dimension contributed: 3\n\n**5. Scaling (or Dilatation) Symmetry (1 dimension)**\nThe equations are also invariant under a specific one-parameter group of scaling transformations. By seeking a transformation of the form $t' = a^\\alpha t, \\mathbf{x}' = a^\\beta \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}' = a^\\gamma \\mathbf{u}, p' = a^\\delta p$ that leaves the equations invariant, one finds a unique relationship between the exponents. This relationship is determined by requiring all terms in the momentum equation to scale by the same factor. The resulting scaling law is:\n$t' = a^2 t$\n$\\mathbf{x}' = a \\mathbf{x}$\n$\\mathbf{u}' = a^{-1} \\mathbf{u}$\n$p' = a^{-2} p$\nThis is a one-parameter family of transformations (parameterized by $a$), so it contributes one dimension to the symmetry group.\n*   Infinitesimal generator: $2t \\partial_t + \\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} - \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{u}} - 2p \\partial_p$\n*   Dimension contributed: 1\n\n**Total Dimension**\nSumming the dimensions from each independent symmetry subgroup gives the total dimension of the Lie group of symmetries:\nTotal Dimension = 1 (Time translation) + 3 (Space translations) + 3 (Rotations) + 3 (Galilean boosts) + 1 (Scaling) = 11.\n\nThis 11-dimensional Lie algebra is the maximal point symmetry algebra of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This is a classical result confirmed by many authors using systematic Lie group analysis. It is important to note that this result is specific to the 3D case; the 2D case, for instance, famously admits an infinite-dimensional symmetry group.\n\n<<<11>>>"
