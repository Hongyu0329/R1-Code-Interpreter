    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, including careful points, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Framing the Problem in the Context of Large Deviation Theory (LDT)**\n\nThe core idea of applying LDT to statistical mechanics is to view the equilibrium state as the most probable macroscopic configuration. Any deviation from this equilibrium state is a \"rare event\" whose probability is exponentially small, governed by a rate function.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem relates the probability of observing a particular empirical distribution of particles among energy states to an entropy-like functional. For a Bose gas, the probability of observing a set of mean occupation numbers `{f_i}` is `P({f_i}) ≈ exp(-I({f_i}))`, where the rate function `I({f_i})` is the negative of the entropy functional. The equilibrium distribution is the one that minimizes this rate function (i.e., maximizes the entropy) subject to physical constraints.\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem deals with the probability of the sample mean of random variables deviating from its expected value. We can apply this to the total energy of the system, which is a sum of the energies of all quanta. The theorem allows us to find the equilibrium mean energy `<E>` by relating it to the cumulant generating function (CGF), which in this context is the logarithm of the Grand Partition Function.\n\n**2. Defining the System: Light Quanta (Photon Gas)**\n\nWe consider a gas of photons in a volume `V` in thermal equilibrium with a heat reservoir at temperature `T` (or inverse temperature `β = 1/(k_B T)`).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Bosons.** Photons are bosons, so they obey Bose-Einstein statistics. Any number of identical, indistinguishable photons can occupy a given single-particle quantum state `i` with energy `ε_i`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Non-conserved Particle Number.** Unlike a typical gas, photons can be created and absorbed by the walls of the container. This means the total number of photons `N` is not conserved. In the language of thermodynamics, this implies the **chemical potential `μ` is zero**.\n\n**3. Finding the Equilibrium Distribution using Cramer-Chernoff Theorem**\n\nThe equilibrium state is characterized by the mean occupation numbers `<n_i>` of the energy levels `ε_i`. We find this using the Grand Canonical Ensemble, whose principles are underpinned by the Cramer-Chernoff theorem.\n\nThe Grand Partition Function `Z_G` for a system with `μ=0` is the product of partition functions `Z_i` for each single-particle state `i`:\n`Z_G = Π_i Z_i`\n\nFor each state `i`, the partition function is the sum over all possible occupation numbers `n_i = 0, 1, 2, ...`:\n`Z_i = Σ_{n_i=0}^∞ exp(-β n_i ε_i) = 1 + e^(-β ε_i) + e^(-2β ε_i) + ...`\nThis is a geometric series which sums to:\n`Z_i = 1 / (1 - e^(-β ε_i))`\n\nThe CGF for the energy is directly related to the logarithm of `Z_G`:\n`ln(Z_G(β)) = ln(Π_i Z_i) = Σ_i ln(Z_i) = - Σ_i ln(1 - e^(-β ε_i))`\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy `U` (or `<E>`) is found by differentiating `ln(Z_G)` with respect to `-β`. This is equivalent to finding the mean from the CGF as prescribed by the Cramer-Chernoff formalism.\n`U = - ∂/∂β [ln(Z_G(β))] = - ∂/∂β [- Σ_i ln(1 - e^(-β ε_i))]`\n`U = Σ_i [ (1 / (1 - e^(-β ε_i))) * (-e^(-β ε_i)) * (-ε_i) ]`\n`U = Σ_i [ ε_i * e^(-β ε_i) / (1 - e^(-β ε_i)) ] = Σ_i [ ε_i / (e^(β ε_i) - 1) ]`\n\nThis expression has the form `U = Σ_i ε_i <n_i>`, which allows us to identify the equilibrium mean occupation number for state `i`, which is the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for `μ=0`:\n`<n_i> = 1 / (e^(β ε_i) - 1)`\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (`U`)**\n\nTo get a concrete value for `U`, we must sum over all possible states. For a large volume `V`, the energy levels are closely spaced, so we can replace the sum with an integral over the density of states `g(ε)`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Density of States.** For photons in a 3D box, including a factor of 2 for the two possible polarizations, the density of states is:\n    `g(ε)dε = (8πV / (h³c³)) ε² dε`\n    where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe total mean energy is:\n`U = ∫₀^∞ ε <n(ε)> g(ε) dε = ∫₀^∞ ε * (1 / (e^(βε) - 1)) * (8πV / (h³c³)) ε² dε`\n`U = (8πV / (h³c³)) ∫₀^∞ (ε³ / (e^(βε) - 1)) dε`\n\nTo solve the integral, we make the substitution `x = βε`, so `ε = x/β` and `dε = dx/β`.\n`U = (8πV / (h³c³)) * (1/β)⁴ ∫₀^∞ (x³ / (eˣ - 1)) dx`\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: The Integral.** The definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann-Zeta function and has the value:\n    `∫₀^∞ (x³ / (eˣ - 1)) dx = Γ(4)ζ(4) = 6 * (π⁴/90) = π⁴/15`\n\nSubstituting this back and using `β = 1/(k_B T)`:\n`U = (8πV / (h³c³)) * (k_B T)⁴ * (π⁴/15)`\n`U = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / (15h³c³)) V T⁴`\nThis is the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law** for the total energy of blackbody radiation.\n\n**5. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (`S`)**\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem tells us that the rate function for the distribution `{f_i}` is `-S({f_i})/k_B`. The entropy for a Bose gas is given by:\n`S = k_B Σ_i [ (1+<n_i>) ln(1+<n_i>) - <n_i> ln(<n_i>) ]`\n\nWhile we could substitute our result for `<n_i>` into this formula and integrate, a much simpler method is to use a fundamental thermodynamic relation. For a system with `μ=0`, the Helmholtz Free Energy `F` is equal to the Grand Potential `Φ`.\n\n`F = Φ = -k_B T ln(Z_G) = -k_B T [ -Σ_i ln(1 - e^(-β ε_i)) ]`\n`F = k_B T ∫₀^∞ g(ε) ln(1 - e^(-βε)) dε`\n\nUsing integration by parts, one can show a very important relation for the photon gas:\n`F = -U/3`\n\nNow, we can find the entropy `S` from the definition of `F`:\n`F = U - TS`\n`-U/3 = U - TS`\n`TS = U + U/3 = (4/3) U`\n`S = (4U) / (3T)`\n\nSubstituting our expression for `U`:\n`S = (4 / (3T)) * [(8π⁵k_B⁴ / (15h³c³)) V T⁴]`\n`S = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / (45h³c³)) V T³`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy of a photon gas (the Bose case of light quanta) are functions of the system's volume `V` and temperature `T`.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):**\n    `U = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / (15h³c³)) V T⁴`\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\n    `S = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / (45h³c³)) V T³`\n\n<<<Equilibrium Mean Energy U = (8π⁵k_B⁴ / (15h³c³)) V T⁴ and Equilibrium Entropy S = (32π⁵k_B⁴ / (45h³c³)) V T³>>>"
