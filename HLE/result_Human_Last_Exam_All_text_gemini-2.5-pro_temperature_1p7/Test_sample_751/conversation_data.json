    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality and find the new matrix C.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Principle of Duality**\n\nThe principle of duality in linear systems states that there is a correspondence between the observability of a system and the controllability of its dual system.\nThe observer canonical form of a system (A, C) can be found by first finding the controller canonical form of its dual system (A', C') and then transposing the resulting matrices.\n\nOriginal System (Primal System):\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\nwith `A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]` and `C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`.\n\nDual System:\nThe state-space representation of the dual system is given by:\n`z(k+1) = A_d * z(k) + B_d * v(k)`\nwhere `A_d = A'` (transpose of A) and `B_d = C'` (transpose of C).\n\n`A_d = A' = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = C' = [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Step 2: Find the Controller Canonical Form for the Dual System**\n\nFirst, we check the controllability of the dual system (A_d, B_d). The state dimension is n=3. The controllability matrix W is given by `W = [B_d, A_d*B_d, A_d^2*B_d, ...]`. We need to check if rank(W) = 3.\n\nLet `b1` and `b2` be the columns of `B_d`:\n`b1 = [0, 1, 0]'`\n`b2 = [1, 1, 0]'`\n\nNow, compute `A_d*B_d`:\n`A_d*B_d = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]] = [[2, 3], [1, 2], [1, 1]]`\n`A_d*b1 = [2, 1, 1]'`\n`A_d*b2 = [3, 2, 1]'`\n\nThe controllability matrix W starts with `W = [b1, b2, A_d*b1, A_d*b2, ...]`.\nLet's select linearly independent columns in order:\n1. `v1 = b1 = [0, 1, 0]'`\n2. `v2 = b2 = [1, 1, 0]'` (linearly independent from v1)\n3. `v3 = A_d*b1 = [2, 1, 1]'` (linearly independent from v1 and v2, due to the non-zero third component)\nSince we have found 3 linearly independent vectors, the system is controllable.\n\nThe structure of the selected vectors `{b1, A_d*b1}` and `{b2}` determines the controllability indices: `mu_1 = 2` and `mu_2 = 1`.\n\nThe transformation matrix `P` that transforms the dual system into controller canonical form has its columns composed of these selected vectors, arranged in chains. Let `P = [b1, A_d*b1, b2]`.\n`P = [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\n\nNow, we need to compute the inverse of P, `T = P^-1`.\n`det(P) = 0 - 2(0 - 0) + 1(1 - 0) = 1`\nThe adjugate of P is `adj(P) = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`\n`T = P^-1 = (1/det(P)) * adj(P) = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]]`\n\nThe matrices for the controller canonical form, `A_c` and `B_c`, are given by:\n`A_c = T * A_d * P`\n`B_c = T * B_d`\n\n`B_c = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]] * [[0, 1], [1, 1], [0, 0]]`\n`B_c = [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\nTo find `A_c`, we first compute `A_d*P`:\n`A_d*P = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]] * [[0, 2, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]] = [[2, 4, 3], [1, 5, 2], [1, 1, 1]]`\n`A_c = T * (A_d*P) = [[-1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, -2]] * [[2, 4, 3], [1, 5, 2], [1, 1, 1]]`\n`A_c = [[0, 2, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 2, 1]]`\n\n**Step 3: Obtain the Observer Canonical Form**\n\nThe observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)` for the original system is obtained by transposing the controller canonical form matrices `(A_c, B_c)` of the dual system.\n`A_o = A_c'`\n`C_o = B_c'`\n\n`A_o = [[0, 2, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 2, 1]]' = [[0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 2], [0, 1, 1]]`\n`C_o = [[1, 0], [0, 0], [0, 1]]' = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the value of the new matrix C in the observer canonical form, which is `C_o`.\n\n`C_o = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`"
