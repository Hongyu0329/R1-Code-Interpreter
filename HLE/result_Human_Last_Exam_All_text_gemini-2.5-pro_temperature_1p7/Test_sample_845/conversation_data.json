    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question's Core Components:**\n    *   **Technology Used:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used to capture data.\n    *   **Primary Measurement:** The technology captures \"beat-to-beat intervals.\"\n    *   **Computed Value:** The question asks for the name of the \"value between heartbeats\" that is used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\n2.  **Understanding the Measurement Process:**\n    *   PPG works by shining light into the skin and measuring the amount of light that is reflected or transmitted.\n    *   When the heart pumps blood, the volume of blood in the arteries and capillaries increases, causing more light to be absorbed. This creates a peak in the PPG signal.\n    *   The time between two consecutive peaks in this signal represents the time between two consecutive heartbeats.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Name of the Value:**\n    *   This measured time between consecutive beats is the fundamental data point for all HRV calculations.\n    *   In medical and signal processing terminology, this duration is most commonly called the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n    *   In the context of Electrocardiography (ECG), which is the gold standard for heart monitoring, the highest peak of a heartbeat is the \"R-wave.\" The interval between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   Because R-R interval is such a common term, it is often used interchangeably with IBI, even when the data comes from a PPG sensor instead of an ECG. Both terms refer to the same physiological event: the time duration between successive heartbeats.\n\n4.  **Careful Points to Consider:**\n    *   **Distinction between the Interval and HRV:** It's crucial to understand that the \"Inter-beat Interval\" is not HRV itself. HRV is a statistical measure of the *variation* in a sequence of many IBIs over a period of time (e.g., the standard deviation of the IBIs, or the root mean square of successive differences between IBIs). However, the question asks for the name of the *value between heartbeats*, which is the interval.\n    *   **PPG vs. ECG Terminology:** While \"R-R interval\" is technically specific to ECG, it is widely adopted and understood in the context of consumer wearables (which use PPG). \"Inter-beat Interval (IBI)\" is a more general and technically accurate term for any beat-to-beat measurement, including from PPG.\n    *   **Other Related Terms:** Sometimes you might see \"Peak-to-Peak (PP) Interval\" used specifically for PPG data, referring to the time between signal peaks. This is essentially synonymous with IBI in this context.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe value computed between heartbeats, derived from beat-to-beat intervals captured by PPG, is the time duration between those beats. The most common and accurate technical name for this value is the Inter-beat Interval (IBI). The term R-R interval is also frequently used.\n\n<<<Inter-beat Interval (IBI) or R-R Interval>>>"
