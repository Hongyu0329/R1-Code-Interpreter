    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\), we need to find the continued fraction of a specific quadratic irrational number, let's call it \\( \\alpha_{p/q} \\). This number has a continued fraction that is purely periodic, and the repeating block of partial quotients is a palindrome.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find this continued fraction for \\( p/q = 4/7 \\).\n\n**Step 1: Find the continued fraction of the rational number \\( p/q \\).**\nWe start by finding the standard continued fraction expansion of \\( 4/7 \\).\nThe Euclidean algorithm gives:\n\\( 7 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\)\n\\( 4 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\)\n\\( 3 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\)\nThe partial quotients are \\( c_1=1, c_2=1, c_3=3 \\). So, the continued fraction is:\n\\( \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\)\nFor the construction to work, the last partial quotient, \\( c_n \\), must be greater than or equal to 2. Here, \\( c_3 = 3 \\ge 2 \\), so we can proceed.\n\n**Step 2: Construct the palindromic sequence of partial quotients.**\nThere is a recursive algorithm to construct the palindromic sequence \\( W_{p/q} \\) from the partial quotients \\( (c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n) \\) of \\( p/q \\). Let us denote the sequence for the rational with CF \\( [0; c_1, \\dots, c_k] \\) as \\( \\sigma_k \\).\n\nThe recursion is as follows:\nLet \\( \\sigma_0 \\) be an empty sequence.\nFor \\( k \\ge 1 \\), the sequence \\( \\sigma_k \\) is constructed from \\( \\sigma_{k-1} \\) and the partial quotient \\( c_k \\) by the rule:\n\\( \\sigma_k = \\sigma_{k-1} \\cdot c_k \\cdot \\sigma_{k-1}^* \\)\nwhere \\( \\cdot \\) denotes concatenation and \\( \\sigma_{k-1}^* \\) is the reverse of the sequence \\( \\sigma_{k-1} \\).\n\nLet's apply this to \\( 4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\), where \\( c_1=1, c_2=1, c_3=3 \\).\n\n*   **k=1**:\n    \\( \\sigma_0 = () \\) (empty sequence)\n    \\( c_1 = 1 \\)\n    \\( \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_0 \\cdot c_1 \\cdot \\sigma_0^* = () \\cdot 1 \\cdot () = (1) \\)\n\n*   **k=2**:\n    \\( \\sigma_1 = (1) \\)\n    \\( c_2 = 1 \\)\n    \\( \\sigma_1^* = (1) \\) (the reverse of (1) is (1))\n    \\( \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_1 \\cdot c_2 \\cdot \\sigma_1^* = (1) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1) = (1, 1, 1) \\)\n\n*   **k=3**:\n    \\( \\sigma_2 = (1, 1, 1) \\)\n    \\( c_3 = 3 \\)\n    \\( \\sigma_2^* = (1, 1, 1) \\) (the reverse of (1, 1, 1) is (1, 1, 1))\n    \\( \\sigma_3 = \\sigma_2 \\cdot c_3 \\cdot \\sigma_2^* = (1, 1, 1) \\cdot 3 \\cdot (1, 1, 1) = (1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1) \\)\n\nSince \\( n=3 \\), the final palindromic sequence is \\( W_{4/7} = \\sigma_3 = (1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1) \\).\n\n**Step 3: State the final continued fraction.**\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the one whose period is the palindromic sequence we just found. It is a purely periodic continued fraction.\n\n\\( \\alpha_{4/7} = [0; \\overline{1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1}] \\)\n\nCareful points:\n*   The continued fraction of the rational number must be in the standard form where the last partial quotient is greater than 1. If we had ended with a 1, we would have combined the last two terms (e.g., \\( [\\dots, a, 1] \\) becomes \\( [\\dots, a+1] \\)). For \\(4/7\\), this was not an issue.\n*   The construction algorithm must be followed precisely. The order of concatenation matters. The result is a palindrome by its very construction.\n*   The question asks for the continued fraction itself, not the numerical value of the irrational number or the value of \\(m_{4/7}\\).\n\nThe final result is the continued fraction defined by the palindromic period derived from the continued fraction of \\(4/7\\)."
