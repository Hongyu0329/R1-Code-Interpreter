    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group, denoted Θ₃ᴴ, that can be represented by 3-manifolds obtained through integral Dehn surgery on knots with a crossing number of four or less.\n\n**2. Understanding the Key Concepts**\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group (Θ₃ᴴ):** This is an abelian group whose elements are equivalence classes of oriented integral homology 3-spheres. Two homology spheres $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are equivalent (or homology cobordant) if there exists a smooth, compact, oriented 4-manifold $W$ whose boundary is the disjoint union of $Y_1$ and $-Y_2$ (i.e., $\\partial W = Y_1 \\sqcup -Y_2$), such that $W$ has the same integer homology as a cylinder ($Y_1 \\times [0,1]$). The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** This is a procedure that creates a 3-manifold $S^3_n(K)$ by cutting out a tubular neighborhood of a knot $K$ from the 3-sphere $S^3$ and gluing it back in with a twist determined by an integer framing $n$.\n*   **Condition for a Homology Sphere:** For the resulting manifold $S^3_n(K)$ to be a homology sphere (i.e., have the same integer homology as $S^3$), its first homology group $H_1(S^3_n(K); \\mathbb{Z})$ must be trivial. The first homology group of a surgery is given by $H_1(S^3_n(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$. For this group to be trivial, we must have $|n|=1$.\n*   **Careful Point:** This means we only need to consider +1 and -1 surgeries on the specified knots.\n\n**3. Listing the Relevant Knots**\nWe need to list all prime knots with a crossing number of 4 or less, and consider their mirror images if they are distinct (chiral).\n*   **0 Crossings:** The unknot (0₁). It is amphichiral (not distinct from its mirror).\n*   **1 & 2 Crossings:** There are no knots with 1 or 2 crossings.\n*   **3 Crossings:** The trefoil knot (3₁). It is chiral, so we must consider the knot and its mirror image separately.\n*   **4 Crossings:** The figure-eight knot (4₁). It is amphichiral.\n\nSo the knots we must analyze are: the unknot (0₁), the trefoil (3₁), the mirror of the trefoil (m(3₁)), and the figure-eight knot (4₁).\n\n**4. Analyzing the Surgery on Each Knot**\n\n*   **Unknot (0₁):**\n    *   Both +1 and -1 surgery on the unknot result in the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $S^3$ represents the identity element in the homology cobordism group Θ₃ᴴ.\n    *   **Result:** 1 element (the identity).\n\n*   **Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):**\n    *   The figure-eight knot is a slice knot. A knot is slice if it bounds a smoothly embedded disk in the 4-ball.\n    *   **Careful Point (Key Theorem):** A fundamental result in low-dimensional topology states that any integral surgery on a slice knot produces a 3-manifold that is homology cobordant to $S^3$.\n    *   Therefore, both $S^3_{+1}(4_1)$ and $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$ represent the identity element in Θ₃ᴴ.\n    *   **Result:** 1 element (the identity).\n\n*   **Trefoil Knot (3₁) and its Mirror (m(3₁)):**\n    *   The trefoil knot is not slice. We must analyze its surgeries using other invariants. Let's denote the left-handed trefoil as $K_L$ and the right-handed trefoil as $K_R$.\n    *   The Rokhlin invariant, $\\mu$, is an invariant of homology spheres that is preserved by homology cobordism. A homology sphere that is homology cobordant to $S^3$ must have a Rokhlin invariant of 0. For a homology sphere $Y = S^3_{+1}(K)$, its Rokhlin invariant is given by $\\mu(Y) \\equiv \\sigma(K)/2 \\pmod 2$, where $\\sigma(K)$ is the signature of the knot $K$.\n    *   The signatures are $\\sigma(K_L) = 2$ and $\\sigma(K_R) = -2$.\n    *   **Surgery on Left-Handed Trefoil ($K_L$):**\n        *   For +1 surgery: The resulting manifold is the Poincaré homology sphere, $P$. Its Rokhlin invariant is $\\mu(P) = \\sigma(K_L)/2 = 2/2 = 1 \\pmod 2$. Since $\\mu(P) \\neq 0$, it represents a **non-trivial element** in Θ₃ᴴ. Let's call this element $[P]$.\n        *   For -1 surgery: We use the formula $S^3_{-1}(K) = -S^3_{+1}(m(K))$. So, $S^3_{-1}(K_L) = -S^3_{+1}(K_R)$. The manifold from +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil ($K_R$) is $-P$. Thus, $S^3_{-1}(K_L) = -(-P) = P$. This also represents the **same non-trivial element** $[P]$.\n    *   **Surgery on Right-Handed Trefoil ($K_R$):**\n        *   For +1 surgery: The manifold is $-P$. Its Rokhlin invariant is $\\mu(-P) \\equiv \\sigma(K_R)/2 = -2/2 = -1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, confirming it's non-trivial. It represents the element $[-P]$.\n        *   For -1 surgery: $S^3_{-1}(K_R) = -S^3_{+1}(K_L) = -P$. This also represents the element $[-P]$.\n    *   **Careful Point (Order of the Element):** The element $[P]$ represented by the Poincaré sphere is known to be the unique element of order 2 in Θ₃ᴴ that can be represented by a Seifert-fibered space. Since it has order 2, $[P] + [P] = 0$, which implies $[P] = -[P]$.\n    *   Therefore, the classes $[P]$ and $[-P]$ are the same. All four possible surgeries (±1 surgery on both the left- and right-handed trefoils) yield the **same single non-trivial element**.\n    *   **Result:** 1 non-trivial element.\n\n**5. Final Count**\nLet's collect the distinct elements found:\n*   From the unknot: The identity element.\n*   From the figure-eight knot: The identity element.\n*   From the trefoil knot and its mirror: A single non-trivial element of order 2.\n\nThe set of all elements obtained is {the identity element, the non-trivial element from the Poincaré sphere}. Therefore, there are a total of two distinct elements.\n\n<<<2>>>"
