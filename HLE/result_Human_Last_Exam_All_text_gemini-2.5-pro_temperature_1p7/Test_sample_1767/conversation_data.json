    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Components\n*   **Chern Insulator:** A Chern insulator is a 2D topological phase of matter characterized by a non-zero integer topological invariant called the Chern number (C).\n*   **Chern Number (C):** The Chern number quantifies the topology of the electronic band structure. Physically, it determines two key properties:\n    1.  **Quantized Hall Conductance:** The Hall conductance `σ_xy` is quantized in units of `e^2/h`, where `σ_xy = C * (e^2/h)`.\n    2.  **Chiral Edge States:** The number of gapless, one-way (chiral) conducting states at the boundary of the material is equal to the absolute value of the Chern number, `|C|`.\n*   **The Setup:** We have two Chern insulators, each with `C=1`. They are placed side-by-side (\"laterally\") to form a junction. The \"negligible tunneling barrier\" at the junction implies that the electronic states of the two insulators can mix freely at their interface.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Edge States\nLet's visualize the system. Imagine placing Insulator 1 (CI1) on the left and Insulator 2 (CI2) on the right. The junction is the vertical line between them.\n*   **Insulator 1 (CI1, C=1):** Having `C=1` means it has one chiral edge state circulating along its boundary. For a standard convention, this state propagates clockwise.\n    *   At the top edge, the state moves to the right.\n    *   At the right edge (the junction), the state moves downwards.\n    *   At the bottom edge, the state moves to the left.\n    *   At the left edge, the state moves upwards.\n*   **Insulator 2 (CI2, C=1):** This also has one clockwise-propagating chiral edge state.\n    *   At the top edge, the state moves to the right.\n    *   At the right edge, the state moves downwards.\n    *   At the bottom edge, the state moves to the left.\n    *   At the left edge (the junction), the state moves upwards.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Junction (Interface)\nNow, let's focus on the junction where CI1 and CI2 meet.\n*   At this interface, we have the right edge of CI1 and the left edge of CI2.\n*   The edge state from CI1 propagates **downwards** along the junction.\n*   The edge state from CI2 propagates **upwards** along the junction.\n*   We have two **counter-propagating** chiral states at the same physical location. The condition \"negligible tunneling barrier\" means these two states will interact strongly.\n*   When counter-propagating states hybridize, they typically open an energy gap. This phenomenon is known as \"gapping out\". Consequently, the gapless states at the internal junction are eliminated. The interface becomes insulating, just like the bulk of the insulators.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the Combined System\nWe now treat the combined structure as a single, larger system.\n*   **Bulk Property (Additivity of Chern Number):** The Chern number is a robust topological property of the bulk band structure. When two topological systems are combined and the overall system remains gapped (which it does, as the interface states gap out), the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n    *   `C_total = C_insulator1 + C_insulator2`\n    *   `C_total = 1 + 1 = 2`\n*   **Boundary Property (Edge States of Combined System):** Let's verify this result by looking at the outer boundaries of the new, larger system.\n    *   **Top Edge:** Both CI1 and CI2 contribute a right-propagating edge state. These two states are co-propagating, so they will not gap each other out. We are left with **two** right-propagating chiral states along the top edge.\n    *   **Bottom Edge:** Similarly, both CI1 and CI2 contribute a left-propagating edge state. We are left with **two** left-propagating chiral states along the bottom edge.\n    *   **Outer Edges:** The far-left edge has an upward-propagating state from CI1, and the far-right edge has a downward-propagating state from CI2. Combined with the top and bottom edges, this forms a picture of two chiral modes circulating the perimeter of the entire system.\n*   **Conclusion:** The presence of two chiral edge states on the boundary of the combined system is the hallmark of a system with a Chern number `C=2`. This confirms the result from the additivity rule.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Chern number of this junction\":** This phrase is slightly ambiguous. A 1D junction does not have a 2D Chern number. The standard interpretation is that it asks for the Chern number of the new 2D system formed by joining the two insulators.\n2.  **Negligible Tunneling Barrier:** This condition is crucial. It ensures the counter-propagating edge states at the interface interact and gap out, leaving the combined system as a well-defined Chern insulator with a single bulk and a clean boundary.\n3.  **Sign of the Chern Number:** The outcome depends on the signs. If one insulator had `C=1` and the other had `C=-1`, their sum would be `C_total = 1 + (-1) = 0`. At their interface, the edge states would be co-propagating and would not gap out, resulting in a 1D metallic channel embedded in a trivial insulator.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy applying the principle of additivity for Chern numbers, which is confirmed by the analysis of the system's edge states, the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n*   `C_total = C1 + C2 = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n<<<2>>>"
