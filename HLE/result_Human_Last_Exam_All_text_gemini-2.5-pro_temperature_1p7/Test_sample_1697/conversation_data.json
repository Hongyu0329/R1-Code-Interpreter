    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting compound is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n    *   **Benzamide:** A benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group which is in turn attached to a nitrogen atom (-C(=O)N-).\n    *   **N,N-diethyl:** Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the amide nitrogen. So, the group at position 1 is -C(=O)N(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n    *   **3-dimethylamino:** A dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is at position 3 on the benzene ring, relative to the amide group at position 1.\n\n    The structure has two key functional groups on the benzene ring:\n    *   At C1: The N,N-diethylamide group, -CONEt₂.\n    *   At C3: The dimethylamino group, -NMe₂.\n    The aromatic protons are at positions C2, C4, C5, and C6.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction Step:**\n    The reagents are sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi), N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), and tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the solvent.\n    *   **sec-BuLi:** This is a very strong organometallic base. Its primary role here is to deprotonate the most acidic proton in the molecule.\n    *   **TMEDA:** This is a chelating agent for the lithium cation (Li⁺). It complexes with the lithium, increasing the reactivity (basicity) of the butyl anion and helping to direct the deprotonation.\n    *   **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM):** The combination of a strong organolithium base and a substrate with a suitable functional group leads to a reaction called Directed ortho-Metalation. The functional group, called a Directed Metalation Group (DMG), coordinates to the lithium ion, bringing the base close to a proton on the *ortho* (adjacent) position of the ring, facilitating its removal.\n\n3.  **Identify the Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs) and Determine the Site of Deprotonation:**\n    Both the N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) can act as DMGs. We need to assess their directing strength and positions.\n    *   The N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) is at C1. It can direct deprotonation at its ortho positions, C2 and C6.\n    *   The dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) is at C3. It can direct deprotonation at its ortho positions, C2 and C4.\n    *   **Relative Directing Strength:** The amide group is one of the most powerful DMGs, significantly stronger than an amino group. The general hierarchy is: -CONR₂ > -OR > -NR₂.\n    *   **Cooperative Directing Effect:** The proton at C2 is ortho to *both* the strong -CONEt₂ director and the weaker -NMe₂ director. This synergistic effect makes the C2 proton exceptionally acidic and the overwhelmingly preferred site for deprotonation. The proton at C6 is only ortho to the amide, and the proton at C4 is only ortho to the weaker amino group.\n    *   Therefore, sec-BuLi will selectively deprotonate the molecule at the C2 position, forming a new C-Li bond. The product of this step is an aryllithium intermediate: N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Reaction Step:**\n    The aryllithium intermediate is then treated with methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n    *   **Aryllithium Intermediate:** The carbon atom bonded to the lithium is highly nucleophilic, behaving like a carbanion (C⁻).\n    *   **Methyl Iodide:** This is an electrophilic alkylating agent. The carbon atom of the methyl group is electrophilic because it is bonded to the more electronegative iodine atom.\n    *   **The Reaction:** The nucleophilic C2 of the aryllithium attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide. This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (specifically, a quaternization or alkylation) where the iodide ion (I⁻) acts as the leaving group. A new carbon-carbon bond is formed.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    The lithium atom at the C2 position is replaced by a methyl group (-CH₃). All other parts of the molecule remain unchanged.\n    *   Parent structure: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n    *   Modification: Addition of a methyl group at position 2.\n    *   Final Product Name: **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nSummary of transformation:\nBenzene ring with -CONEt₂ at C1 and -NMe₂ at C3\n→ (sec-BuLi/TMEDA) → Lithiation at C2 (most acidic position due to cooperative directing)\n→ (CH₃I) → Methylation at C2.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
