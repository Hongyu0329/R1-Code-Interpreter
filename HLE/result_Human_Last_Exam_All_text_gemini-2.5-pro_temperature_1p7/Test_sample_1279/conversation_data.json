    "To solve this problem, we need to identify all distinct connected vacuum bubble diagrams at the second order in $\\phi^4$ theory and then calculate the symmetry factor for each. The sum of these factors is the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Second-Order Vacuum Bubble Diagrams**\n\nIn $\\phi^4$ theory, the interaction vertex involves four $\\phi$ fields. A second-order diagram contains two such vertices. A vacuum bubble diagram is a connected Feynman diagram with no external lines. This means all the \"legs\" of the fields at the vertices must be connected to each other internally, forming propagators.\n\nWe have two vertices, let's call them $V_1$ and $V_2$. Each vertex has 4 legs. This gives a total of 8 legs to be connected in pairs. Each connection forms a propagator. Thus, there will be $8/2 = 4$ propagators in any second-order vacuum bubble diagram.\n\nWe can classify the possible connected diagrams by the number of propagators, $k$, that directly connect $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n\n*   **Case k=4:** All four propagators connect $V_1$ to $V_2$. This uses all 8 legs (4 from $V_1$ and 4 from $V_2$). This forms a valid connected diagram, which topologically resembles a figure-eight or a sunset. Let's call this **Diagram 1**.\n\n*   **Case k=3:** Three propagators connect $V_1$ and $V_2$. This uses 3 legs from each vertex, leaving one leg at $V_1$ and one at $V_2$. For the diagram to have no external lines, these two remaining legs must be connected to each other. This forms a fourth propagator between $V_1$ and $V_2$, which brings us back to the k=4 case. So, k=3 is not a distinct topology.\n\n*   **Case k=2:** Two propagators connect $V_1$ and $V_2$. This uses 2 legs from each vertex. This leaves 2 legs at $V_1$ and 2 legs at $V_2$. The remaining 2 legs at $V_1$ must connect to each other, forming a loop on $V_1$. Similarly, the 2 remaining legs at $V_2$ must form a loop on $V_2$. This results in a valid connected diagram with two vertices, two propagators between them, and one loop at each vertex. Let's call this **Diagram 2**.\n\n*   **Case k=1:** One propagator connects $V_1$ and $V_2$. This leaves 3 legs at each vertex. It is impossible to pair up an odd number of legs internally at a single vertex. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\n*   **Case k=0:** Zero propagators connect $V_1$ and $V_2$. This means the 4 legs of $V_1$ must connect among themselves, and the 4 legs of $V_2$ must connect among themselves. This results in two separate, disconnected diagrams. Since we are looking for connected vacuum bubble diagrams, this case is not considered. (These diagrams appear in calculations, but as a product of lower-order connected diagrams).\n\nThus, there are only two distinct connected vacuum bubble diagrams at the second order in $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Symmetry Factor for Diagram 1 (Sunset Diagram)**\n\nThe symmetry factor, $S$, of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which is the number of permutations of its lines and vertices that leave the diagram topologically unchanged.\n\n*   **Diagram 1:** Two vertices connected by four propagators.\n*   **Symmetries from permuting propagators:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are topologically identical. They can be permuted in any way without changing the diagram. The number of such permutations is $4! = 24$.\n*   **Symmetries from permuting vertices:** The two vertices are also identical. They can be swapped, and the diagram remains the same. This gives a factor of $2! = 2$.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these independent symmetries.\n$S_1 = (\\text{permutations of propagators}) \\times (\\text{permutations of vertices})$\n$S_1 = 4! \\times 2 = 24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Symmetry Factor for Diagram 2 (Double Scoop Diagram)**\n\n*   **Diagram 2:** Two vertices, $V_1$ and $V_2$, connected by two propagators. Additionally, there is one loop on $V_1$ and one loop on $V_2$.\n*   **Symmetries from permuting propagators:** The two propagators connecting $V_1$ and $V_2$ are identical. They can be swapped. This gives a factor of $2! = 2$.\n*   **Symmetries from permuting vertices:** The two vertices are identical in their structure (one loop, two lines to the other vertex). Swapping $V_1$ and $V_2$ also requires swapping the loop on $V_1$ with the loop on $V_2$, resulting in the same diagram. This gives a factor of $2$.\n*   **Symmetries within loops:** Each loop consists of a single propagator connecting a vertex to itself. This means two legs from the vertex are connected. Swapping these two legs does not change the propagator. This introduces a factor of 2 for each loop. Since there are two loops (one on each vertex), this contributes a factor of $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\nCombining all these symmetry factors:\n$S_2 = (\\text{swap connecting props}) \\times (\\text{swap vertices}) \\times (\\text{symmetry of loop 1}) \\times (\\text{symmetry of loop 2})$\n$S_2 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n**Alternative Check using Combinatorics**\nThe numerical contribution of a diagram in perturbation theory is proportional to (number of Wick contractions) / $S$. By calculating the number of contractions from first principles, we can deduce $S$. The expression for a second-order contribution from $(\\frac{-i\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4)^2$ includes a factor of $\\frac{1}{2!}$. The full formula relates the symmetry factor $S$ to the number of ways to form the diagram ($N_{contractions}$) from the vertices: $\\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{N_{contractions}}{2! (4!)^2}$.\n\n*   For Diagram 1: $N_{contractions}$ is the number of ways to connect 4 fields at $x$ to 4 fields at $y$, which is $4! = 24$.\n    $\\frac{1}{S_1} = \\frac{24}{2 \\cdot (24)^2} = \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 24} = \\frac{1}{48} \\implies S_1 = 48$.\n*   For Diagram 2: $N_{contractions}$ is the number of ways to form one loop at each vertex and connect the remaining. At vertex 1, choose 2 of 4 fields for the loop: $\\binom{4}{2}=6$. Same for vertex 2: $\\binom{4}{2}=6$. The remaining 2 fields from vertex 1 can be connected to the remaining 2 from vertex 2 in 2 ways. Total contractions: $6 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 72$.\n    $\\frac{1}{S_2} = \\frac{72}{2 \\cdot (24)^2} = \\frac{72}{1152} = \\frac{1}{16} \\implies S_2 = 16$.\nBoth methods give the same results, confirming their correctness.\n\n**Step 4: Sum the Symmetry Factors**\n\nThe final step is to sum the symmetry factors for all identified diagrams.\nTotal Sum = $S_1 + S_2$\nTotal Sum = $48 + 16 = 64$.\n\n<<<64>>>"
