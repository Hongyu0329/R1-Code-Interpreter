    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring with a specific stereochemistry.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide ($KOC(CH_3)_3$ or KOtBu). This is a strong and sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol ($(CH_3)_3COH$ or tBuOH). This is a polar solvent and the conjugate acid of the base.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Type of Reaction**\n*   The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base strongly favors an elimination reaction over a substitution reaction.\n*   The strong base will not wait for a carbocation to form (ruling out E1), so the mechanism will be a bimolecular elimination (E2).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stereochemical Requirement for E2 Elimination**\n*   The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Br) and the proton (H) to be removed must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation.\n*   For a cyclohexane ring, this means the Br and H must be in a **trans-diaxial** arrangement (one axial-up, one axial-down on adjacent carbons).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Structure and Conformation of the Substrate**\n*   First, we determine if (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a *cis* or *trans* isomer. By assigning priorities and using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules, we find that for the (1S, 2R) configuration, the bromo group and the methyl group are on opposite sides of the ring. Thus, it is a **trans** isomer.\n*   A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations that are in equilibrium:\n    1.  A **diequatorial (e,e)** conformer, where both the Br and the methyl group are in equatorial positions. This is the more stable conformer because bulky groups prefer the less crowded equatorial position.\n    2.  A **diaxial (a,a)** conformer, where both the Br and the methyl group are in axial positions. This is the less stable conformer.\n*   For the E2 reaction to occur, the leaving group (Br) must be in an axial position. Therefore, the reaction must proceed through the less stable **diaxial (a,a)** conformer. Although this conformer is present in a small amount at equilibrium, the reaction will consume it, and the equilibrium will shift to produce more of it (Curtin-Hammett principle).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Eliminatable Protons in the Reactive Conformer**\n*   Let's analyze the reactive diaxial conformer. Let's assume the Br at C1 is in the axial-down position. Because it is a trans-1,2-diaxial isomer, the methyl group at C2 must be in the axial-up position.\n*   The base needs to remove a proton that is anti-periplanar to the Br, meaning a proton that is in an axial-up position on an adjacent carbon (C2 or C6).\n*   **At Carbon C2:** The methyl group occupies the axial-up position. Therefore, the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial-down position. There is **no axial proton** on C2 that is anti-periplanar to the bromine. Elimination to form the more substituted Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene) is **geometrically impossible**.\n*   **At Carbon C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial-up, and the other is equatorial-down. The axial-up hydrogen on C6 is perfectly positioned (trans-diaxial) for E2 elimination with the axial-down bromine.\n\n**Step 6: Predict the Product**\n*   The strong base, potassium tert-butoxide, will abstract the only available anti-periplanar proton, which is the axial hydrogen on C6.\n*   The C-H bond electrons will form a new Ï€ bond between C1 and C6, and the bromide ion will leave.\n*   The resulting product is an alkene with a double bond between the carbons that were originally C1 and C6. The methyl group, which was on C2, is unaffected by the reaction.\n\n**Step 7: Name the Product**\n*   To name the alkene product using IUPAC nomenclature, the ring is numbered to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers (C1 and C2).\n*   In the product, the original C6 is now C1, and the original C1 is now C2. The methyl group is attached to the original C2, which becomes C3 in the new numbering scheme.\n*   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is considered an \"anti-Zaitsev\" or Hofmann-like product, but its formation is dictated by stereoelectronic control rather than steric factors.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
