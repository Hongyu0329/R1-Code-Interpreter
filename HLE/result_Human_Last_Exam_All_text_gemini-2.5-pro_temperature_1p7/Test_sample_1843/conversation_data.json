    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the character\n\nLet $\\chi$ be a Dirichlet character. We are given two main conditions:\n1.  **Conductor:** The conductor of $\\chi$ is $N=36036$. A character is called *primitive* if its modulus equals its conductor.\n2.  **Order:** The order of $\\chi$ is 6. This is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\chi(n)^k=1$ for all integers $n$ coprime to $N$.\n\n### Step 2: Factorize the conductor N\n\nTo analyze the character $\\chi$, we first need the prime factorization of its conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\n$N = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$\n\n### Step 3: Decompose the character\n\nAny Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\chi_{9} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a character modulo $p^a$.\n\nThe conditions on $\\chi$ translate to conditions on its components:\n1.  **Primitivity:** $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $N = \\prod p_i^{a_i}$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n2.  **Order:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n    We require this lcm to be 6.\n\n### Step 4: Count the valid choices for each component character\n\nWe need to count the number of choices for each primitive component $\\chi_{p^a}$ such that its order divides 6.\n\n*   **Careful point:** The number of characters of order $d$ in a cyclic group of order $m$ (where $d|m$) is $\\phi(d)$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\n\n#### Component $\\chi_4$ (mod 4)\n*   The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which has order $\\phi(4)=2$.\n*   There is one primitive character modulo 4. Its order is 2.\n*   Since $2$ divides $6$, this is a valid choice.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: **1**.\n\n#### Component $\\chi_9$ (mod 9)\n*   The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which has order $\\phi(9)=6$.\n*   A character $\\chi_9$ is primitive if it is not induced from a character modulo 3. This is equivalent to its order not dividing $\\phi(3)=2$.\n*   The possible orders for a character mod 9 are divisors of 6: {1, 2, 3, 6}.\n*   Primitive characters mod 9 must have order 3 or 6.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n*   Both orders 3 and 6 divide 6. So all 4 primitive characters are valid choices.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: $2+2 = \\textbf{4}$.\n\n#### Component $\\chi_7$ (mod 7)\n*   For a prime modulus $p$, any non-principal character is primitive.\n*   The group of characters mod 7 has order $\\phi(7)=6$.\n*   We need primitive characters whose order divides 6. This means all non-principal characters are valid choices.\n*   The number of such characters is $\\phi(7)-1 = 5$.\n*   Alternatively, by order: $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_7$: **5**.\n\n#### Component $\\chi_{11}$ (mod 11)\n*   Any non-principal character mod 11 is primitive. The character group has order $\\phi(11)=10$.\n*   We need characters whose order divides 6. The possible orders must divide $\\text{gcd}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), 6) = \\text{gcd}(10, 6) = 2$.\n*   So the only possible order (other than 1) is 2.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: **1**.\n\n#### Component $\\chi_{13}$ (mod 13)\n*   Any non-principal character mod 13 is primitive. The character group has order $\\phi(13)=12$.\n*   We need characters whose order divides 6. The possible orders must divide $\\text{gcd}(12, 6) = 6$.\n*   Possible orders are 2, 3, 6.\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n*   Total choices: $1+2+2=5$.\n*   Number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: **5**.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the results and verify the total order\n\nWe need to find the total number of ways to choose the component characters. This is the product of the number of choices for each component. Let's first ensure that the lcm of the orders will indeed be 6.\nLet $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$ be the tuple of orders of the chosen components.\n*   $o_4 = 2$.\n*   $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$.\n*   $o_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n*   $o_{11} = 2$.\n*   $o_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nThe lcm of these orders must be 6. Let's check the necessary conditions for this:\n1.  All orders must divide 6. By construction, we have already ensured this.\n2.  The lcm must be a multiple of 2. This is guaranteed since $o_4=2$.\n3.  The lcm must be a multiple of 3. This is guaranteed since $o_9$ must be 3 or 6, which are both multiples of 3.\n\nSince the lcm must be a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6. Combined with the fact that all orders divide 6 (so the lcm must divide 6), the lcm is *exactly* 6 for any valid combination of component characters.\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of valid choices for each component:\nTotal Number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$."
