    "An analysis of the problem to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Right Divisor:** A polynomial matrix R(s) is a right divisor of P(s) if there exists a polynomial matrix Q(s) such that P(s) = Q(s)R(s).\n*   **Common Right Divisor (CRD):** R(s) is a common right divisor of P1(s) and P2(s) if it is a right divisor of both.\n*   **Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD):** A CRD, G(s), is a GCRD if any other CRD, R(s), is a right divisor of G(s). That is, G(s) = H(s)R(s) for some polynomial matrix H(s). The GCRD is unique up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant).\n\n**2. State the Matrices**\n\nP1(s) = [ s² + s   -s      ]\n        [ -s² - 1   s²     ]\n\nP2(s) = [ s         0       ]\n        [ -s - 1    1       ]\n\n**3. Method 1: The Euclidean Algorithm**\n\nWe can find a GCRD by performing elementary row operations on the compound matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] to reduce it to the form [G(s); 0]. The resulting matrix G(s) will be a GCRD.\n\nThe initial matrix is:\nM(s) =\nRow 1: [ s² + s   -s      ]\nRow 2: [ -s² - 1   s²     ]\nRow 3: [ s         0       ]\nRow 4: [ -s - 1    1       ]\n\nLet's perform the row operations:\n\n*   **Step 1:** R1 ← R1 + s * R4\n    `[s² + s, -s] + s * [-s - 1, 1] = [s² + s - s² - s, -s + s] = [0, 0]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    [ 0         0       ]\n    [ -s² - 1   s²     ]\n    [ s         0       ]\n    [ -s - 1    1       ]\n\n*   **Step 2:** R2 ← R2 - s² * R4\n    `[-s² - 1, s²] - s² * [-s - 1, 1] = [-s² - 1 + s³ + s², s² - s²] = [s³ - 1, 0]`\n    The non-zero rows of the system are now equivalent to:\n    [ s³ - 1   0       ]\n    [ s        0       ]\n    [ -s - 1   1       ]\n\n*   **Step 3:** Let's reduce the new first row using the new second row. Using polynomial division, `s³ - 1 = s² * (s) - 1`.\n    Row'1 ← Row'1 - s² * Row'2\n    `[s³ - 1, 0] - s² * [s, 0] = [-1, 0]`\n    The set of independent non-zero rows is now:\n    [ -1       0       ]\n    [ s        0       ]\n    [ -s - 1   1       ]\n\n*   **Step 4:** Reduce the new second row using the new first row.\n    Row''2 ← Row''2 + s * Row''1\n    `[s, 0] + s * [-1, 0] = [s - s, 0] = [0, 0]`\n    The set of independent non-zero rows becomes:\n    [ -1       0       ]\n    [ -s - 1   1       ]\n\n*   **Step 5:** This matrix, G₁(s) = `[-1, 0; -s - 1, 1]`, is a valid GCRD. However, we can simplify it further to find a canonical form. Let's reduce the new second row using the new first row.\n    Row'''2 ← Row'''2 - (s+1) * Row'''1\n    `[-s - 1, 1] - (s+1) * [-1, 0] = [-s - 1 - (-s - 1), 1 - 0] = [0, 1]`\n    The set of independent non-zero rows is now:\n    [ -1   0 ]\n    [  0   1 ]\n\n*   **Step 6:** Make the leading entries positive.\n    Row''''1 ← -1 * Row''''1\n    This gives the final reduced matrix:\n    [ 1   0 ]\n    [ 0   1 ]\n\nThis is the identity matrix, I. Thus, a GCRD is the identity matrix.\n\n**4. Method 2: Coprimeness Test**\n\nTwo polynomial matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are right co-prime if their GCRD is a unimodular matrix. A test for this is to check if the rank of the stacked matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] is equal to the number of columns (which is 2) for all complex values of s.\n\n*   First, consider the determinant of a submatrix, for instance, P2(s).\n    det(P2(s)) = (s)(1) - (0)(-s - 1) = s.\n    For any `s` where `det(P2(s)) ≠ 0` (i.e., for all `s ≠ 0`), the matrix P2(s) has full rank (rank 2). This implies that the larger matrix M(s) also has rank 2 for all `s ≠ 0`.\n\n*   Now, we only need to check the case where `s = 0`.\n    M(0) = [ 0   0 ]\n           [ -1  0 ]\n           [ 0   0 ]\n           [ -1  1 ]\n    The non-zero rows are [-1, 0] and [-1, 1]. These two vectors are linearly independent, so the rank of M(0) is 2.\n\nSince `rank(M(s)) = 2` for all complex `s`, the matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are right co-prime.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nBecause P1 and P2 are right co-prime, their GCRD is any 2x2 unimodular matrix. By convention, the simplest and most canonical choice for the GCRD is the identity matrix, which is also in Hermite normal form. Our result from the Euclidean algorithm also simplified to the identity matrix.\n\nThe greatest common right divisor is:\n[ 1  0 ]\n[ 0  1 ]\n\n<<<(B) [1,0; 0,1]>>>"
