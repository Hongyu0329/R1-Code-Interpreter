**Management Plan Summary:**
1.  **Immediate Phase:** Medical referral for diabetes control (target HbA1c <7%), local wound debridement of sockets (#22, #23, #24), prescription of systemic antibiotics and analgesics, and fabrication of a temporary acrylic partial denture for aesthetics.
2.  **Cells of Interest:** Neutrophils, Macrophages, Fibroblasts, and Osteoblasts are of primary interest, as their function is impaired by uncontrolled diabetes, leading to increased infection risk and delayed soft and hard tissue healing.
3.  **Definitive Phase (after healing and glycemic control):**
    *   **Denture Type & Material:** A cast metal (Cobalt-Chromium) framework removable partial denture with acrylic saddles and artificial teeth.
    *   **Abutment Teeth:** The primary abutments will be the left central incisor (#21) and the left second premolar (#25). To ensure stability and indirect retention, the desi
