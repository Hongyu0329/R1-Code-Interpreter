    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Algebra and its Representations**\n\nThe question asks about the representations of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity (i.e., $q^3=1, q \\neq 1$). Let's denote this algebra by $u_q$. This is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra of dimension $3^3=27$.\n\nThe category $C$ consists of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q$. Since $u_q$ is a finite-dimensional algebra, all of its representations are finite-dimensional. An irreducible representation is always indecomposable, so the set of irreducible representations is a subset of the objects of $C$.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of objects in $C$ that are irreducible. This is naturally interpreted as the ratio of the number of isomorphism classes of irreducible representations to the number of isomorphism classes of indecomposable representations.\n\nLet $N_{irr}$ be the number of isomorphism classes of irreducible (or simple) $u_q$-modules.\nLet $N_{ind}$ be the number of isomorphism classes of indecomposable $u_q$-modules.\n\nThe value we need to compute is $(N_{irr} / N_{ind}) \\times 100\\%$.\n\n**Step 2: Classifying the Irreducible Representations**\n\nFor $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ where $q$ is a primitive $l$-th root of unity with $l$ odd, the number of non-isomorphic simple modules is known to be $(l-1)/2 + 2$.\nFor $l=3$, this number is $(3-1)/2 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3$.\nSo, $N_{irr} = 3$.\n\nThese three simple modules can be described as follows:\n1.  $L_1$: The trivial one-dimensional representation.\n2.  $L_2$: A two-dimensional representation, which is the quantum analogue of the standard 2D representation of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$.\n3.  $L_3$: A three-dimensional representation, which is of a type specific to the root-of-unity setting (a semi-cyclic representation).\n\nSo, there are exactly 3 isomorphism classes of irreducible representations for this algebra.\n\n**Step 3: Classifying the Indecomposable Representations**\n\nTo understand the set of all indecomposable representations, we must analyze the representation type of the algebra $u_q$. The representation theory of a finite-dimensional algebra is often studied by decomposing its category of modules into \"blocks\". An indecomposable module belongs to exactly one block.\n\nThe block structure of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at $l=3$ is determined by the first extension groups between the simple modules. Based on the values of $\\operatorname{Ext}^1(L_i, L_j)$, the category of $u_q$-modules decomposes into two blocks:\n1.  A block $B_0$ which contains the simple modules $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n2.  A block $B_1$ which contains only the simple module $L_3$.\n\nNow we must determine the representation type of each block.\n*   **Block $B_1$:** This block contains a single simple module $L_3$. It is known that $\\operatorname{Ext}^1(L_3, L_3) = 0$. This implies that the block $B_1$ is semi-simple. In a semi-simple category, every object is a direct sum of simple objects. Therefore, the only indecomposable object in $B_1$ is the simple object $L_3$ itself. So, this block contributes exactly 1 to the count of indecomposable modules.\n\n*   **Block $B_0$:** This block contains two simple modules, $L_1$ and $L_2$. It is known that the extension groups within this block are non-zero (e.g., $\\operatorname{Ext}^1(L_1, L_1) \\neq 0$ and $\\operatorname{Ext}^1(L_1, L_2) \\neq 0$). For $l \\ge 3$, this block is known to be of **wild representation type**.\n\n**Step 4: The Consequence of Wild Representation Type**\n\nAn algebra (or a block of an algebra) is of wild representation type if the problem of classifying its indecomposable modules is at least as hard as classifying pairs of matrices over a field up to simultaneous conjugation. A key feature of wild type is that there are infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. In fact, for a wild algebra, there exist dimensions $d$ for which there are continuous one-parameter families of non-isomorphic indecomposable modules of dimension $d$.\n\nTherefore, the block $B_0$ contains infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable modules.\n\n**Step 5: Calculating the Percentage**\n\nLet's summarize our counts of isomorphism classes:\n*   Number of irreducible representations: $N_{irr} = N_{irr}(B_0) + N_{irr}(B_1) = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n*   Number of indecomposable representations: $N_{ind} = N_{ind}(B_0) + N_{ind}(B_1)$. Since $N_{ind}(B_0) = \\infty$ and $N_{ind}(B_1) = 1$, the total number is $N_{ind} = \\infty$.\n\nThe percentage of objects of $C$ that are irreducible is the ratio of these numbers:\nPercentage = $(N_{irr} / N_{ind}) \\times 100\\% = (3 / \\infty) \\times 100\\%$.\n\nAny finite number divided by infinity is zero.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   **Algebra Identification:** The context strongly points to the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, for which the number of simple modules is finite. If it were the unrestricted quantum group $U_q$, both the number of simples and indecomposables would be infinite, making the question ill-defined.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Percentage\":** The standard interpretation in this context is the ratio of the cardinalities of the sets of isomorphism classes.\n*   **Known Results:** The analysis relies on established (but non-trivial) results from the representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity, namely the number of simple modules and the wild representation type of the principal block. These results are standard in the literature on the subject.\n\nFinal conclusion: There are 3 isomorphism classes of irreducible representations, but infinitely many isomorphism classes of indecomposable representations. Thus, the irreducible ones form a zero percentage of the total.\n\n<<<0>>>"
