    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the hypothetical Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Current Word and its Origin:**\n    *   The Modern English word is \"sister\".\n    *   Its etymology shows that it comes from the Old English *sweostor*, but its modern form was heavily influenced and ultimately replaced by its Old Norse cognate, *systir*. The Vikings brought this word with them during their invasions and settlement in the Danelaw region of England.\n\n2.  **Identify the Native Anglo-Saxon Word:**\n    *   Before the Viking invasions, the word used by the Anglo-Saxons was *sweostor*.\n    *   This word, like the Old Norse *systir*, descends from the same Proto-Germanic root, **\\*swestēr**. This means both the Anglo-Saxons and the Norse had a version of the word from their shared linguistic ancestry. The question is about which version would have survived and how it would have evolved.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Divergence:**\n    *   In the northern and eastern parts of England (the Danelaw), the Old Norse *systir* became dominant due to the large population of Norse settlers. Its phonetic simplicity helped it spread.\n    *   In the southern and western parts of England, where Norse influence was much weaker, the native Old English *sweostor* continued to evolve on its own path.\n\n4.  **Trace the Uninfluenced Anglo-Saxon Evolution:**\n    *   We need to track how *sweostor* would have changed from Old English to Middle English and then to Modern English without the interference of *systir*.\n    *   **From Old English to Middle English:** The Old English *sweostor* (and its common variant *swuster*) naturally evolved into the Middle English forms *suster* and *swester*. We have direct evidence of this in texts from areas outside the Danelaw. For example, Geoffrey Chaucer, a Londoner writing in the 14th century, uses the form **\"suster\"**.\n    *   **From Middle English to Modern English:** The next step is to project how \"suster\" would have changed during the Great Vowel Shift and other sound changes that shaped Modern English. We can use parallel words as a guide:\n        *   Old English *brōþor* -> Middle English *brother* -> Modern English *brother*\n        *   Old English *mōdor* -> Middle English *moder* -> Modern English *mother*\n        *   Old English *dohtor* -> Middle English *doughter* -> Modern English *daughter*\n    *   Following this pattern, the Middle English *suster* (pronounced roughly as \"soos-ter\") would have likely undergone a vowel shift where the 'u' sound /u/ became the /ʌ/ sound (like the 'u' in \"cup\" or \"duster\").\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the Hypothetical Word:**\n    *   The Middle English form *suster*, which was the dominant form in non-Norse influenced English, would have continued its development.\n    *   Its pronunciation and spelling would have standardized, most likely resulting in the Modern English word **\"suster\"**, rhyming with \"muster\" or \"duster\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Cognates:** It's crucial to understand that *sweostor* (Old English) and *systir* (Old Norse) are cognates, not completely different words. The influence was one form replacing another similar, related form.\n*   **Dialectal Variation:** English was not uniform. The form \"suster\" was prevalent in the South, while the Norse-influenced \"sister\" took hold in the North and Midlands before eventually becoming the standard across all of England. Without the Norse, the Southern form would have had a much stronger claim to becoming the standard.\n*   **Phonetic Evolution:** The prediction relies on the regular patterns of sound change observed in the English language. While exceptions always exist, the evolution of *suster* to a modern *suster* (rhyming with duster) follows the most common and expected path, mirroring words like *mother* and *brother*.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the natural linguistic evolution of the native Old English word *sweostor* in areas unaffected by Norse influence, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **suster**.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
