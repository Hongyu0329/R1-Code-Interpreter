    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Question**\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms used in the question:\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point. Examples include the closed interval [0, 1], a circle, or more complex spaces like the Knaster continuum or the pseudo-arc. A single point is a degenerate continuum.\n*   **Composant:** For a given point `x` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `x` (denoted `C(x)`) is the set of all points `y` in `X` such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing both `x` and `y`. A proper subcontinuum is a subset of `X` which is itself a continuum and is not equal to `X`. The collection of all distinct composants forms a partition of `X`.\n*   **Product of two continua:** Given two continua `X` and `Y`, their product `X × Y` equipped with the product topology is also a continuum. Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate, `X × Y` is also nondegenerate.\n\nThe question asks for the **largest possible number of composants** that the product space `X × Y` can have, where `X` and `Y` are any two nondegenerate continua.\n\n**2. Number of Composants and Decomposability**\n\nA crucial theorem in continuum theory connects the number of composants of a continuum to its decomposability.\n\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum `Z` is decomposable if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. That is, `Z = A ∪ B`, where `A` and `B` are continua, `A ⊂ Z`, `B ⊂ Z`, `A ≠ Z`, and `B ≠ Z`.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum is indecomposable if it is not decomposable.\n\nThe key theorem states:\n*   A decomposable continuum has exactly **1** composant.\n*   An indecomposable continuum has **c** composants, where `c` is the cardinality of the continuum (i.e., `c = 2^ℵ₀`, the size of the set of real numbers).\n\nTherefore, the problem is transformed into finding the decomposability properties of the product continuum `X × Y`.\n\n**3. Decomposability of the Product Space `X × Y`**\n\nLet's analyze when `X × Y` is decomposable.\n\nConsider the case where at least one of the continua, say `Y`, is decomposable.\nSince `Y` is decomposable, we can write `Y = A ∪ B`, where `A` and `B` are proper subcontinua of `Y`.\nNow, consider the product space `X × Y`. We can write it as:\n`X × Y = X × (A ∪ B) = (X × A) ∪ (X × B)`\n\nLet `K₁ = X × A` and `K₂ = X × B`.\n*   `K₁` is a continuum because it is the product of two continua (`X` and `A`). Since `A` is a proper subcontinuum of `Y`, there exists a point `y ∈ Y` such that `y ∉ A`. For any `x ∈ X`, the point `(x, y)` is in `X × Y` but not in `K₁`. Thus, `K₁` is a proper subcontinuum of `X × Y`.\n*   Similarly, `K₂` is a proper subcontinuum of `X × Y`.\n\nSince `X × Y` is the union of two of its proper subcontinua (`K₁` and `K₂`), `X × Y` is decomposable.\n\nFrom this, we conclude: **If either `X` or `Y` is decomposable, their product `X × Y` is decomposable and therefore has exactly 1 composant.**\n\n**4. Finding the Maximum Number of Composants**\n\nTo find the *largest possible* number of composants, we must investigate the case where `X × Y` is indecomposable. Based on the theorem, this would yield `c` composants.\nFor `X × Y` to have any chance of being indecomposable, both `X` and `Y` must be indecomposable. If either were decomposable, the product would have only 1 composant.\n\nSo, the question now is: Is the product of two indecomposable continua always indecomposable? Or can it be decomposable? Can we find an example where it is indecomposable?\n\nThis was a long-standing open problem in topology. The answer is that the product's decomposability depends on the specific indecomposable continua chosen.\n*   **Case 1: The product is decomposable.** There are examples of indecomposable continua whose product is decomposable. For instance, if `K` is the Knaster continuum (also known as the buckethandle continuum), which is indecomposable, it has been proven that the product `K × K` is decomposable. In this case, `K × K` has only **1** composant.\n*   **Case 2: The product is indecomposable.** There also exist examples where the product is indecomposable. The pseudo-arc, `P`, is a famous example of an indecomposable continuum. It has been proven that the product of the pseudo-arc with itself, `P × P`, is not only indecomposable but hereditarily indecomposable (meaning every subcontinuum of `P × P` is also indecomposable).\n\nSince `P × P` is an indecomposable continuum, it has **c** composants.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that the number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua `X × Y` can be:\n*   **1** (if `X` or `Y` is decomposable, or if `X` and `Y` are like the Knaster continuum).\n*   **c** (if `X` and `Y` are like the pseudo-arc).\n\nThe number of composants of a space cannot exceed the number of points in the space. For nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`, the cardinality of `X × Y` is `c × c = c`. Therefore, the number of composants cannot be greater than `c`.\n\nSince we have found an example that achieves `c` composants, the largest possible number of composants is **c**.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Definitions:** Be precise with the definitions of continuum, composant, and decomposability. A misunderstanding of these concepts can lead to incorrect conclusions.\n2.  **The Main Theorem:** The theorem stating that the number of composants is 1 for decomposable continua and `c` for indecomposable continua is the central pillar of the argument.\n3.  **Decomposability of Products:** The proof that if one factor is decomposable, the product is decomposable is simple but critical. It narrows the search for the maximum to the case where both factors are indecomposable.\n4.  **Reliance on Advanced Results:** The question cannot be fully answered with only elementary topology. It requires knowing (or finding) results from the research literature on continuum theory, specifically about the products of indecomposable continua like the Knaster continuum and the pseudo-arc.\n5.  **Distinguishing \"Possible\" from \"Necessary\":** It's important to recognize that the product of two indecomposable continua is not *necessarily* indecomposable. Finding examples for both possibilities (decomposable and indecomposable products) is key to establishing the range of outcomes and thus the maximum.\n6.  **Cardinality:** The final answer is a cardinal number, `c`. It is crucial to establish that this is an upper bound (as it's the cardinality of the space) and that this bound is achievable.\n\n---\n\nThe final answer is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
