    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the name of a *single genus* of mushroom. The key identifying characteristic given is that it is known to produce a *distinctly blue spore print*.\n\n2.  **Understand \"Spore Print\":** A spore print is a crucial identification tool in mycology. It is made by placing a mushroom cap, gills down, on a piece of paper, allowing the microscopic spores to fall and create a visible deposit. The color of this deposit is the spore print color. This is different from the color of the mushroom's cap, stem, or flesh.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Common Misconceptions:** Many people immediately think of mushrooms that are themselves blue.\n    *   **The *Lactifluus indigo* (formerly *Lactarius indigo*) mushroom:** This species is famous for its vibrant blue color and the blue \"milk\" (latex) it exudes when cut. However, its spore print is **not blue**. It is a creamy white to yellowish color. Therefore, neither *Lactifluus* nor its parent genus *Lactarius* is the correct answer.\n    *   **The *Entoloma hochstetteri* mushroom:** This is another famously blue mushroom, native to New Zealand. Despite its striking blue body, its spore print is pink, which is characteristic of most mushrooms in the *Entoloma* genus.\n\n4.  **Investigate Rare Spore Colors:** Standard spore print colors include white, cream, yellow, pink, brown, purple-brown, and black. Blue is exceptionally rare and is often cited as an anomaly. We must search for the specific genus where this anomaly is documented.\n\n5.  **Identify the Correct Genus:** Through mycological literature, it's established that while most species in the genus *Entoloma* have the characteristic pink spore print, this is the only genus known to contain a few rare species that produce a truly blue spore print. For example, species such as *Entoloma aeruginosum* from Japan are documented to have a sky-blue spore print when the deposit is fresh.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Although it is a rare trait found in only a few species *within* the genus, *Entoloma* is the only genus currently known to science that contains mushrooms capable of producing a distinctly blue spore print. Other genera may have blue-fleshed mushrooms or spores with a fleeting violaceous tint, but *Entoloma* stands alone as the definitive answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe single genus of mushroom known to contain species that produce a distinctly blue spore print is *Entoloma*.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
