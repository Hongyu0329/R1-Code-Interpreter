    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\n\nThe question asks for the common name of a specific mathematical object within a particular scientific community. Let's break down the key phrases:\n1.  **Generalized Pair Correlation Function:** In the context of nuclear criticality, this function describes the correlation between neutrons. Specifically, it gives the probability of finding a neutron at a certain position and time, given that another neutron was present at another position and time. This function, let's call it $g(\\mathbf{r}_1, t_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, t_2)$, is a fundamental quantity in the study of neutron fluctuations (also known as reactor noise). For a statistically stationary and spatially homogeneous system, this function depends only on the separation in space ($\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_2 - \\mathbf{r}_1$) and time ($\\tau = t_2 - t_1$), becoming $g(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau)$.\n2.  **Space-time, double Fourier transform:** This indicates a Fourier transform operation performed on both the spatial variable ($\\mathbf{r}$) and the temporal variable ($\\tau$). The transform converts the function from the space-time domain ($(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau)$) to the wavevector-frequency domain ($(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$).\n    *   The spatial transform variable is the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$.\n    *   The temporal transform variable is the angular frequency $\\omega$.\n    The resulting function, let's call it $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, represents the spectrum of the neutron fluctuations, decomposed into spatial and temporal modes.\n3.  **Nuclear Criticality Community:** This specifies the field of interest. The terminology must be what is commonly used by physicists and engineers working on nuclear reactors, subcritical assemblies, and criticality safety.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Physical Meaning and Analogies\n\nThe function $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$ describes how the \"power\" of the neutron noise is distributed among different frequencies ($\\omega$) and spatial wavevectors ($\\mathbf{k}$). This is the most complete description of the second-order statistics of the neutron population in the linear approximation.\n\nThis exact mathematical procedure is also fundamental in other fields of physics, most notably condensed matter physics. In that field, neutron scattering or X-ray scattering experiments are used to probe the structure and dynamics of materials. The double-differential scattering cross-section is directly proportional to the space-time Fourier transform of the particle pair correlation function of the material. In condensed matter physics, this quantity has a very specific and universally recognized name.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Terminology\n\n1.  **General Terminology:** According to the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, the Fourier transform of a correlation function is known as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**. This term is very widely used in the nuclear community. For instance, the time-Fourier transform of the signal from a single neutron detector (which is related to an autocorrelation function) is called the Auto-Power Spectral Density. The time-Fourier transform of the correlation between two separated detectors is the **Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)**. Therefore, \"Power Spectral Density\" is a correct and common descriptive term.\n\n2.  **Specific Terminology:** The question asks for the name of the *double* (space and time) Fourier transform. In condensed matter physics, this specific object, $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$, is called the **Dynamic Structure Factor**. It is a cornerstone concept for describing collective excitations like phonons and magnons.\n\n3.  **Usage in Nuclear Criticality:** Is the term \"Dynamic Structure Factor\" used in the nuclear criticality community?\n    *   While \"Power Spectral Density\" is more frequently encountered in general discussions, the more formal term \"Dynamic Structure Factor\" is indeed used in the specialized literature on reactor noise and neutron transport theory.\n    *   Researchers have recognized the direct analogy between the neutron fluctuations in a reactor and the particle fluctuations in a medium studied by scattering. Consequently, they have adopted the more precise terminology.\n    *   For example, modern research papers on advanced reactor noise analysis techniques explicitly use this term. A notable example is a 2017 paper in *Annals of Nuclear Energy* by A. C. Valentine et al., titled \"Measurement of the dynamic structure factor of coupled-core reactor systems,\" which states, \"The DSF is the spaceâ€“time Fourier transform of the neutron pair correlation function.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Common vs. Formal:** The question asks what the quantity is \"commonly called.\" This can be ambiguous. \"Power Spectral Density\" is arguably more common in a general sense, but \"Dynamic Structure Factor\" is the specific and formal name for the precise mathematical object described, and its use in the community is established.\n*   **Context is Key:** In many practical applications, only the frequency dependence is measured (the PSD), or the correlation between just two points (the CPSD). The full space-time transform is more theoretical or measured in specialized \"neutron wave\" type experiments. For this full transform, the more formal name is appropriate.\n*   **Distinction from Scattering:** It is important to distinguish this from the dynamic structure factor of materials *within* a reactor (e.g., the moderator or fuel), which is relevant for thermal neutron scattering calculations. Here, we are talking about the dynamic structure factor of the *neutron gas itself*.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, while \"Power Spectral Density\" is a correct and frequently used general term, the specific name for the space-time double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is the **Dynamic Structure Factor**. This term is formally correct and is used in the modern nuclear criticality literature, making it the best answer to the question.\n\n<<<Dynamic Structure Factor>>>"
