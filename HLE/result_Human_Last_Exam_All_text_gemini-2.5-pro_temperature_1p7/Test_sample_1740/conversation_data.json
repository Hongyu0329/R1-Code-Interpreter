    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the let-7 Family:** The let-7 family is a group of highly conserved microRNAs (miRNAs). MiRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. Members of the let-7 family share a similar \"seed sequence,\" which allows them to bind to and regulate a common set of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). They are fundamental regulators of developmental timing and cellular differentiation and are often considered tumor suppressors.\n\n2.  **Identify the Primary Authoritative Source:** The official repository for miRNA nomenclature, sequence, and annotation is **miRBase**. Any count of miRNA members should be consistent with the data curated in this database for humans (*Homo sapiens*).\n\n3.  **Distinguish Between Mature miRNAs and Precursor Genes (A Careful Point):** This is the most crucial point in answering the question accurately.\n    *   **Precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA):** This is the initial transcript from a specific gene locus on a chromosome. It is a hairpin-shaped molecule.\n    *   **Mature miRNA:** The pre-miRNA is processed by enzymes (like Dicer) into a short, double-stranded RNA, one strand of which becomes the mature, functional miRNA.\n    *   A single type of mature miRNA can be generated from multiple, distinct precursor genes located at different places in the genome. For example, the mature `let-7a` miRNA is the same final molecule whether it comes from the `let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, or `let-7a-3` gene.\n\n4.  **Count the Number of Distinct Mature let-7 miRNAs:** When we count the number of unique mature miRNA molecules in the family, we identify the following core members in humans:\n    *   `let-7a`\n    *   `let-7b`\n    *   `let-7c`\n    *   `let-7d`\n    *   `let-7e`\n    *   `let-7f`\n    *   `let-7g`\n    *   `let-7i`\n    *   `miR-98` (structurally and functionally part of the let-7 family)\n\n    This gives a total of **9** distinct mature miRNA members.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Note that `let-7h` is not present in humans, though it exists in other species.\n\n5.  **Count the Number of Identified Precursor Genes:** The question asks how many \"members... have been identified\". This is often interpreted in the scientific literature as the number of gene loci that have been identified. Counting the precursor genes provides a more complete picture of the family's genetic complexity.\n    *   `let-7a` is produced by **3** genes: `hsa-let-7a-1`, `hsa-let-7a-2`, `hsa-let-7a-3`.\n    *   `let-7f` is produced by **2** genes: `hsa-let-7f-1`, `hsa-let-7f-2`.\n    *   The other 7 members (`let-7b`, `let-7c`, `let-7d`, `let-7e`, `let-7g`, `let-7i`, and `miR-98`) are each produced by a **single** gene.\n\n    Summing these up: 3 (for let-7a) + 2 (for let-7f) + 7 (for the others) = **12** precursor genes.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** While there are 9 unique mature let-7 family miRNAs, they are encoded by 12 different gene loci in the human genome. Seminal scientific reviews and databases like NCBI Gene often refer to the **12** gene loci when discussing the members of the human let-7 family, as the differential regulation of these distinct genes is biologically significant. Therefore, the most comprehensive answer to \"how many members have been identified\" is the number of precursor genes.\n\n<<<12>>>"
