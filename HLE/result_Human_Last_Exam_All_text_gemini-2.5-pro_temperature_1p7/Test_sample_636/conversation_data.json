    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the state feedback gain `F`.\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given the system matrices:\nA = `[[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\nB = `[[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nThe state feedback control law is given by `u = -Fx`, where `x` is the state vector and `u` is the input vector. The closed-loop system dynamics are described by `x_dot = (A - BF)x`. The problem asks us to find a feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF` are at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The system has 2 states (since A is 2x2) and 2 inputs (since B is 2x2). Therefore, the feedback gain matrix `F` must be a 2x2 matrix. Let's define `F` as:\nF = `[[f11, f12], [f21, f22]]`\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial for a system with these eigenvalues is:\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ - p1)(λ - p2)`\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`P_desired(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2`:\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) - (-1)`\n`P_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Actual Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nFirst, calculate the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f11, f12], [f21, f22]] = [[f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22], [f11, f12]]`\n\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f11 + 2*f21, f12 + 2*f22], [f11, f12]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f11 + 2*f21, 1 + f12 + 2*f22], [1 + f11, f12]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `P_actual(λ) = det(λI - A_cl)`. For a 2x2 matrix, this is `λ^2 - trace(A_cl)λ + det(A_cl)`.\n\n*   **Trace of A_cl:**\n    `trace(A_cl) = (-1 + f11 + 2*f21) + f12 = f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1`\n*   **Determinant of A_cl:**\n    `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f11 + 2*f21)(f12) - (1 + f12 + 2*f22)(1 + f11)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f12 + f11*f12 + 2*f12*f21 - (1 + f11 + f12 + f11*f12 + 2*f22 + 2*f11*f22)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -1 - f11 - 2*f12 - 2*f22 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f11*f22`\n\nSo, the actual characteristic polynomial is:\n`P_actual(λ) = λ^2 - (f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1)λ + (-1 - f11 - 2*f12 - 2*f22 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f11*f22)`\n\n**Step 4: Equate the Coefficients and Solve for F**\n\nWe match the coefficients of `P_actual(λ)` with `P_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n\n1.  **Matching λ coefficient:**\n    `-(f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1) = 2`\n    `f11 + f12 + 2*f21 - 1 = -2`\n    `f11 + f12 + 2*f21 = -1`  (Equation 1)\n\n2.  **Matching constant term:**\n    `-1 - f11 - 2*f12 - 2*f22 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f11*f22 = 2`\n    `-f11 - 2*f12 - 2*f22 + 2*f12*f21 - 2*f11*f22 = 3` (Equation 2)\n\n**Careful Point 2:** We have a system of 2 equations with 4 unknowns (`f11, f12, f21, f22`). This means there are infinite solutions for the gain matrix `F`. This is a common property of multi-input systems. We can find one possible solution by making a simplifying assumption. A simple choice is to set the gains associated with the second input to zero, i.e., `f21 = 0` and `f22 = 0`.\n\nLet's apply the simplification `f21 = 0` and `f22 = 0`:\n\n*   **Equation 1 becomes:**\n    `f11 + f12 + 2(0) = -1`\n    `f11 + f12 = -1` (Equation 1a)\n\n*   **Equation 2 becomes:**\n    `-f11 - 2*f12 - 2(0) + 2*f12(0) - 2*f11(0) = 3`\n    `-f11 - 2*f12 = 3` (Equation 2a)\n\nNow we have a simple system of 2 linear equations with 2 unknowns (`f11`, `f12`).\n\n**Step 5: Solve the Simplified System of Equations**\n\nAdd Equation 1a and Equation 2a:\n`(f11 + f12) + (-f11 - 2*f12) = -1 + 3`\n`-f12 = 2`\n`f12 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f12 = -2` back into Equation 1a:\n`f11 + (-2) = -1`\n`f11 = 1`\n\nSo, with our simplification, we have `f11 = 1`, `f12 = -2`, `f21 = 0`, `f22 = 0`.\n\n**Step 6: State the Final Answer**\n\nOne possible state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\nF = `[[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\nWe can verify this. With this F, `A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`. The characteristic polynomial is `λ^2 - trace(A_cl)λ + det(A_cl) = λ^2 - (-2)λ + (2) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`, which matches the desired polynomial.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
