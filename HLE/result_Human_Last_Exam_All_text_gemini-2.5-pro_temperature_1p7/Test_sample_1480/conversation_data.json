    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Components of a Fuzzy Rule:**\n    A typical fuzzy rule has the form: `IF (antecedent condition) THEN (consequent conclusion)`.\n    *   **Antecedent:** The \"IF\" part of the rule. In this problem, the firing strength or degree of truth of the antecedent for the k-th rule is given by `Φ_k(x′) = 0.7`. This value represents how strongly the input `x'` matches the condition of the rule.\n    *   **Consequent:** The \"THEN\" part of the rule. It is a fuzzy set, `G_k`. The problem gives us the membership grade of a specific point `y_j` in this fuzzy set, which is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. This value represents the membership of `y_j` in the original, un-activated consequent fuzzy set.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Question's Goal:**\n    The question asks for the \"rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set\". This phrase can be interpreted as finding the membership grade of the *output fuzzy set* for this specific rule. This process, known as **implication**, combines the antecedent's firing strength with the consequent's fuzzy set to produce the rule's output. The operation to perform this combination is specified as a **t-norm**.\n\n3.  **Explain the Role of the \"Interval Type-3\" Context:**\n    An Interval Type-3 (IT3) Fuzzy Logic System is a highly complex system designed to handle extreme levels of uncertainty. In a full IT3 system, the firing level (`Φ_k`) and the membership functions (`μG_k_j`) would not be simple numbers but complex 3D sets. However, the problem provides crisp numerical values (`0.7` and `0.9`). This indicates that we are being asked to perform the calculation at a single, specific point within this complex structure. The fundamental operation at this point is still the t-norm, just as it is in a simpler Type-1 system. Therefore, the \"Interval Type-3\" label provides context but does not change the core arithmetic for the given values.\n\n4.  **Define and Apply the t-norm Operation:**\n    A t-norm is a function that models a fuzzy logical \"AND\". It is used to combine two membership values. The most common t-norm used in fuzzy inference systems (like the Mamdani method) is the **minimum operator**.\n    *   **Formula:** `Result = t-norm(antecedent_firing_strength, consequent_membership_value)`\n    *   **Another common t-norm is the product operator:** `Result = antecedent_firing_strength * consequent_membership_value`.\n    *   Unless specified otherwise, the minimum operator (`min`) is the standard choice for implication.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    Using the standard minimum t-norm:\n    *   Antecedent Firing Strength `Φ_k(x′)` = 0.7\n    *   Consequent Membership `μG_k_j(y_j)` = 0.9\n    *   Rule Activation Level = `min(Φ_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    *   Rule Activation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   Rule Activation Level = 0.7\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Terminology:** \"Rule activation level\" can sometimes refer only to the antecedent's firing strength (0.7). However, because the consequent's membership value (0.9) is also provided along with the instruction to use a t-norm, the question is asking for the result of the implication step, which \"activates\" the consequent.\n*   **Choice of t-norm:** While several t-norms exist (e.g., product, drastic, etc.), the minimum t-norm is the most prevalent and is the standard assumption in the absence of other information. Using the product t-norm would yield `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`, which is also a valid interpretation of \"a t-norm operation\". However, the minimum operator is the canonical choice.\n*   **Simplification of Type-3:** The problem cleverly uses the \"Interval Type-3\" label but simplifies the calculation by providing crisp numbers. The key is to recognize that the fundamental operation (t-norm) is preserved even within more complex fuzzy systems.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe rule activation level is determined by applying the t-norm operation to the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership value.\n\n*   Antecedent Firing Strength: `Φ_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   Consequent Membership Value: `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n*   T-norm Operation (using the standard minimum operator): `min(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   Result: `0.7`\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
