    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Preliminaries**\n\n*   **The 2-Torus ($T^2$):** This is a surface shaped like a donut. Topologically, it's the product of two circles, $S^1 \\times S^1$.\n*   **Smooth Function:** A function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is infinitely differentiable.\n*   **Critical Point:** A point $p \\in T^2$ where the derivative (gradient) of the function is zero. In local coordinates $(x, y)$, this means $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(p) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(p) = 0$.\n*   **The Goal:** Find the smallest possible number of critical points that *any* smooth function on the torus must have.\n\n**Step 2: Establish a Lower Bound using Topological Properties**\n\n1.  **Compactness:** The torus $T^2$ is a compact manifold. The Extreme Value Theorem states that any continuous (and therefore, any smooth) function on a compact space must attain a global maximum and a global minimum.\n2.  **Extrema are Critical Points:** By Fermat's theorem (for manifolds), any point that is a local maximum or a local minimum must be a critical point.\n3.  **Initial Lower Bound:** Since $f$ must have at least one global maximum and one global minimum, it must have at least **2** critical points. However, this is a very weak bound, and we can do better using more advanced tools.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Morse Theory for a Stronger Lower Bound**\n\nMorse theory provides a powerful connection between the number of critical points of a function and the topology of the underlying space.\n\n1.  **Betti Numbers of the Torus:** The topology of a space can be measured by its Betti numbers, which are the ranks of its homology groups. For the 2-torus, the Betti numbers are:\n    *   $b_0(T^2) = 1$ (it has one connected component).\n    *   $b_1(T^2) = 2$ (it has two fundamental non-contractible loops: one \"longitudinally\" and one \"latitudinally\").\n    *   $b_2(T^2) = 1$ (it is a closed surface, enclosing a \"void\").\n\n2.  **Morse Inequalities:** For any *Morse function* $f$ (a function whose critical points are all non-degenerate), let $c_k$ be the number of critical points with index $k$. The Morse inequalities state that $c_k \\ge b_k$ for all $k$.\n    *   The index of a critical point on a surface can be 0 (local minimum), 1 (saddle point), or 2 (local maximum).\n    *   Applying the inequalities to the torus:\n        *   $c_0 \\ge b_0 = 1$ (at least one minimum).\n        *   $c_1 \\ge b_1 = 2$ (at least two saddle points).\n        *   $c_2 \\ge b_2 = 1$ (at least one maximum).\n\n3.  **Lower Bound for Morse Functions:** The total number of critical points for a Morse function on the torus must be at least $c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\n4.  **Generalizing to All Smooth Functions:** The result from Morse theory can be extended to all smooth functions, not just Morse functions. A fundamental result (related to Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory or Morse homology) states that the number of critical points of *any* smooth function on a compact manifold $M$ must be at least the sum of its Betti numbers, $\\sum_k b_k(M)$.\n    *   For the torus, this gives a lower bound of $b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\n**Conclusion from Theory:** Any smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have at least 4 critical points.\n\n**Step 4: Construct an Example to Show the Bound is Achievable**\n\nTo prove that 4 is the *minimal* number, we must show that a function with exactly 4 critical points exists.\n\n1.  **Define the Torus:** We can represent the torus using two angle coordinates $(\\theta, \\phi)$, where $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$ and $0 \\le \\phi < 2\\pi$. This is like a square with opposite edges identified.\n2.  **Choose a Function:** Consider the function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by:\n    $f(\\theta, \\phi) = \\cos(\\theta) + \\cos(\\phi)$\n    This function is smooth and well-defined on the torus because $\\cos$ is a $2\\pi$-periodic function.\n\n3.  **Find Critical Points:** We set the partial derivatives to zero:\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\theta} = -\\sin(\\theta) = 0 \\implies \\theta = 0$ or $\\theta = \\pi$.\n    *   $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\phi} = -\\sin(\\phi) = 0 \\implies \\phi = 0$ or $\\phi = \\pi$.\n\n4.  **List the Critical Points:** This gives us four critical points in the domain $[0, 2\\pi) \\times [0, 2\\pi)$:\n    *   **Point A:** $(\\theta, \\phi) = (0, 0)$\n    *   **Point B:** $(\\theta, \\phi) = (0, \\pi)$\n    *   **Point C:** $(\\theta, \\phi) = (\\pi, 0)$\n    *   **Point D:** $(\\theta, \\phi) = (\\pi, \\pi)$\n\n5.  **Classify the Critical Points:** We use the second derivative test (Hessian matrix) to classify them.\n    *   The Hessian matrix is $H = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\cos(\\theta) & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\cos(\\phi) \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   **At A (0, 0):** $f(0,0)=2$. $H = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are -1, -1. This is a **local maximum**.\n    *   **At B (0, $\\pi$):** $f(0,\\pi)=0$. $H = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are -1, 1. This is a **saddle point**.\n    *   **At C ($\\pi$, 0):** $f(\\pi,0)=0$. $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are 1, -1. This is a **saddle point**.\n    *   **At D ($\\pi$, $\\pi$):** $f(\\pi,\\pi)=-2$. $H = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are 1, 1. This is a **local minimum**.\n\nThis example function has exactly four critical points: one minimum, one maximum, and two saddle points.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   Topological theory (Morse Theory) establishes that any smooth function on the 2-torus must have at least **4** critical points.\n*   We constructed an explicit smooth function, $f(\\theta, \\phi) = \\cos(\\theta) + \\cos(\\phi)$, that has exactly **4** critical points.\n*   Since the lower bound is 4 and this bound is achievable, the minimal number of critical points is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
