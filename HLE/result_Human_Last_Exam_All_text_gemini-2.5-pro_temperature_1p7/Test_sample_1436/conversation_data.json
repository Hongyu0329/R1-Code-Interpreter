    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for the **symmetry factor** of a Feynman diagram with two key features:\n1.  **Two vertices**: These are points where particle lines meet, representing interactions.\n2.  **Four field contractions**: A \"field contraction\" corresponds to a propagator in a Feynman diagram. A propagator connects two field operators. Therefore, the diagram has four propagators (internal lines).\n\n### Step 2: Determining the Theoretical Context and Interaction Type\nTo analyze the diagram, we must first establish the underlying quantum field theory. A diagram with a specific number of vertices and propagators implies a certain type of interaction vertex.\n\n*   Let the interaction be from a term of the form $\\frac{\\lambda}{k!} \\phi^k$ in the Lagrangian, where $k$ is the number of fields meeting at each vertex.\n*   The diagram has $V=2$ vertices. The total number of field \"legs\" available at these vertices is $k \\times V = 2k$.\n*   The diagram has $I=4$ propagators (contractions). Each propagator consumes two field legs.\n*   Assuming the diagram is a **vacuum diagram** (no external lines), all field legs must be contracted internally. Therefore, the total number of legs used is $2I$.\n*   Equating the available legs to the used legs: $2k = 2I$.\n*   Substituting the known values: $2k = 2 \\times 4 \\implies 2k = 8 \\implies k = 4$.\n\nThis analysis shows that the vertices originate from a $\\mathbf{\\phi^4}$ interaction, with a Lagrangian term like $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = \\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$. The perturbative expansion will contain a term for two such vertices, which looks like $\\frac{1}{2!} \\left( \\frac{-i\\lambda}{4!} \\right)^2$.\n\n### Step 3: Identifying Possible Diagram Topologies\nNow we must determine how two $\\phi^4$ vertices (each with 4 legs) can be connected using four propagators. There are two possible connected topologies for a vacuum diagram:\n\n1.  **The \"Melon\" Diagram**: All four propagators connect the first vertex directly to the second vertex. This diagram is highly symmetric.\n2.  **The \"Setting-Sun\" Diagram**: Two propagators connect the two vertices, and each vertex has one self-loop (a propagator starting and ending at the same vertex).\n\nThe question is phrased in the singular (\"a Feynman diagram\"), which is ambiguous. In such cases, it is common to consider the most symmetric or structurally simplest case. The \"Melon\" diagram is arguably simpler as it only contains one type of connection (lines between the two vertices), whereas the \"Setting-Sun\" has two types (lines between and self-loops). The \"Melon\" diagram also has a higher degree of symmetry. We will proceed by calculating the symmetry factor for this diagram.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Symmetry Factor for the \"Melon\" Diagram\nThe symmetry factor, $S$, of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which represents the number of ways the lines and vertices can be permuted without changing the diagram's topology.\n\nFor the **\"Melon\" diagram**:\n*   **Propagator Symmetry**: There are 4 identical propagators connecting the two vertices. These propagators are indistinguishable and can be permuted in $4!$ ways.\n    *   Factor = $4! = 24$.\n*   **Vertex Symmetry**: The two vertices are of the same type ($\\phi^4$) and are connected in an identical manner (each has 4 lines going to the other vertex). Therefore, the two vertices can be swapped without changing the diagram.\n    *   Factor = $2$.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these individual symmetry factors.\n\n$S = (\\text{Propagator Symmetry}) \\times (\\text{Vertex Symmetry})$\n$S = 4! \\times 2 = 24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n\n**Alternative Calculation (using Wick Contractions):**\nThis method confirms the result. The overall numerical factor for a diagram in the perturbation series is $1/S$.\n1.  The factor from the Taylor series and Lagrangian is $\\frac{1}{2!(4!)^2}$.\n2.  The number of ways to contract 4 fields at vertex $x_1$ with 4 fields at $x_2$ (forming the melon diagram) is $4! = 24$.\n3.  The diagram's total coefficient is $\\frac{\\text{Number of ways to contract}}{\\text{Denominator factors}} = \\frac{24}{2!(4!)^2} = \\frac{24}{2 \\times (24)^2} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 24} = \\frac{1}{48}$.\n4.  Since the coefficient is $1/S$, the symmetry factor is $S = 48$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n**(For completeness, the symmetry factor for the \"Setting-Sun\" diagram would be 16, but based on the likely interpretation of the question, 48 is the intended answer).**"
