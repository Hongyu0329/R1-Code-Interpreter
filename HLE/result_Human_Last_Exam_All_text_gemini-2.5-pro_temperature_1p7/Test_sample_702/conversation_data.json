    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the spaces and rephrase the question\nThe question asks for the connectivity of the map $\\phi: \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\nLet's denote the source space by $X$ and the target space by $Y$.\n*   Source: $X = \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$\n*   Target: $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$\n\nA map $f: X \\to Y$ is said to be $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and an epimorphism (surjection) for $i = k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of $f$ being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\nWe can simplify the target space using the standard homotopy equivalence for smash products of spheres: $S^m \\wedge S^n \\simeq S^{m+n}$.\nSo, $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$.\nTherefore, the target space is $Y \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\nThe question is to find the integer $k$ which is the connectivity of the map $\\phi: \\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces\nThe connectivity of a space is the largest integer $n$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ are trivial for $i \\le n$. We use the following rules:\n*   $S^d$ is $(d-1)$-connected.\n*   If a space $Z$ is $d$-connected, its loop space $\\Omega Z$ is $(d-1)$-connected.\n*   If a space $Z$ is $d$-connected, its suspension $\\Sigma Z$ is $(d+1)$-connected.\n*   If $U$ is $d_1$-connected and $V$ is $d_2$-connected, their smash product $U \\wedge V$ is $(d_1+d_2+1)$-connected.\n\nLet's apply these rules to our spaces:\n1.  **Connectivity of $\\Omega S^4$**: $S^4$ is $(4-1)=3$-connected. So, $\\Omega S^4$ is $(3-1)=2$-connected.\n2.  **Connectivity of $\\Omega S^6$**: $S^6$ is $(6-1)=5$-connected. So, $\\Omega S^6$ is $(5-1)=4$-connected.\n3.  **Connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$**: This space is $(2+4+1) = 7$-connected.\n4.  **Connectivity of the source space $X$**: $X = \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. This space is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n5.  **Connectivity of the target space $Y$**: $S^{10}$ is $(10-1)=9$-connected. So, $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$ is $(9-1)=8$-connected.\n\n### Step 3: Initial analysis of the map's connectivity\nSince both the source space $X$ and the target space $Y$ are 8-connected, their homotopy groups $\\pi_i(X)$ and $\\pi_i(Y)$ are trivial for $i \\le 8$.\nThe induced map $\\phi_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$ is a map from a trivial group to a trivial group for $i \\le 8$, which is necessarily an isomorphism.\nAccording to the definition of connectivity, this implies that the connectivity of the map $\\phi$ is at least 8. To find the exact connectivity, we must analyze the map on the first non-trivial homotopy group, which is $\\pi_9$.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the map and apply the relevant theorem\nThe phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" hints at a standard construction in homotopy theory. The map $\\phi: \\Sigma(\\Omega A \\wedge \\Omega B) \\to \\Omega(A \\wedge B)$ is a well-studied map, often called the Berstein-Hilton-Ganea map or related to the James-Hopf invariant.\n\nThere is a powerful theorem by Brayton Gray concerning the connectivity of this map.\n\n**Gray's Theorem:** Let $A$ and $B$ be $(n-1)$-connected and $(m-1)$-connected CW complexes, respectively, with $n, m \\ge 2$. Then the map $\\Sigma(\\Omega A \\wedge \\Omega B) \\to \\Omega(A \\wedge B)$ is $(n+m-1)$-connected.\n\nWe apply this theorem to our specific case:\n*   $A = S^4$. It is 3-connected. So, $n-1=3 \\implies n=4$.\n*   $B = S^6$. It is 5-connected. So, $m-1=5 \\implies m=6$.\n\nAccording to Gray's theorem, the connectivity of the map $\\phi$ is:\nConnectivity = $n+m-1 = 4+6-1 = 9$.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the result\nThe theorem states that the connectivity of the map is 9. This means:\n*   $\\phi_*: \\pi_i(X) \\to \\pi_i(Y)$ is an isomorphism for $i < 9$.\n*   $\\phi_*: \\pi_9(X) \\to \\pi_9(Y)$ is an epimorphism.\n\nThis is consistent with our findings in Step 3. The theorem provides the crucial information for $i=9$. (Note: A more detailed analysis shows that for this particular map, $\\pi_9(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\pi_9(Y) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, so an epimorphism is also an isomorphism. The connectivity is exactly 9 because the map on $\\pi_{10}$ is not an epimorphism).\n\nThe connectivity of the map is the integer 9."
