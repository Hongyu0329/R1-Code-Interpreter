    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function `f`\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We want to find the cardinality of $S$, denoted as $|S|$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity of `f`**:\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    Using the given equation, this implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$.\n    Since the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, it is injective. Thus, $x_1 = x_2$.\n    Therefore, $f$ must be an injective (one-to-one) function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of `f`**:\n    A continuous injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n    Let's check the composition $f \\circ f$:\n    *   If $f$ is strictly increasing, then for $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$, and applying $f$ again gives $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This is consistent with $\\exp(x)$ being strictly increasing.\n    *   If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then for $x_1 < x_2$, we have $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$, and applying the decreasing function $f$ again reverses the inequality, giving $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This is also consistent with $\\exp(x)$ being strictly increasing.\n    So, a priori, $f$ could be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the strictly decreasing case\n\nLet's assume $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function.\n\n1.  **Limits at infinity**:\n    *   As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x)$ must tend to some limit $L \\in \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{-\\infty\\}$. Let $y = f(x)$. If $L$ is a finite number, then as $x \\to \\infty$, $y \\to L$. By continuity, $f(y) \\to f(L)$. However, $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x) \\to \\infty$. This is a contradiction. Thus, we must have $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n    *   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ must tend to some limit $M \\in \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$. Let $y = f(x)$. If $M = \\infty$, then as $y \\to \\infty$, we know from the previous point that $f(y) \\to -\\infty$. But $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x) \\to 0$. This is a contradiction. Thus, $M$ must be a finite real number, so $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = M$.\n\n2.  **A key value of `f`**:\n    Since $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = M$ and $f$ is continuous, we have $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = f(M)$.\n    We also know that $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} \\exp(x) = 0$.\n    Therefore, we must have $f(M) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Finding a contradiction**:\n    *   Since $f$ is a decreasing function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to its range $(\\lim_{x\\to\\infty}f(x), \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}f(x)) = (-\\infty, M)$, the value $0$ must be in the range of $f$. This means $0 < M$.\n    *   Now we have $f(M)=0$ for some $M>0$. From the original equation, $f(f(M)) = \\exp(M)$, which implies $f(0) = \\exp(M)$.\n    *   Let's compare the inputs $M$ and $\\exp(M)$. The function $\\exp(x) - x$ is always positive (its minimum value is 1 at $x=0$), so $\\exp(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In particular, $\\exp(M) > M$.\n    *   Since $f$ is strictly decreasing and $\\exp(M) > M$, applying $f$ to both sides reverses the inequality: $f(\\exp(M)) < f(M)$.\n    *   We know $f(M)=0$.\n    *   To find $f(\\exp(M))$, we use the equation again: $f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$. Since we found $f(0) = \\exp(M)$, this means $f(\\exp(M)) = 1$.\n    *   Substituting these values back into the inequality $f(\\exp(M)) < f(M)$, we get $1 < 0$.\n    *   This is a clear contradiction.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption must be false. There are **no strictly decreasing** continuous functions that satisfy the given equation.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the strictly increasing case\n\nAll solutions must be strictly increasing. Let's analyze their properties.\n\n1.  **Fixed points**: If $f$ had a fixed point $c$, so $f(c)=c$, then $f(f(c))=f(c)=c$. This would mean $\\exp(c)=c$, which has no real solution. So, $f$ has no fixed points.\n2.  **Behavior relative to `y=x`**: Since $f$ is continuous and has no fixed points, either $f(x)>x$ for all $x$ or $f(x)<x$ for all $x$.\n    *   If $f(x)<x$ for all $x$, then since $f$ is increasing, $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$.\n    *   This would mean $\\exp(x) < x$, which is false for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   Therefore, any solution must satisfy $f(x)>x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n3.  **Limits and range**:\n    *   As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x)>x$, so $f(x) \\to \\infty$.\n    *   As $x \\to -\\infty$, let $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)=M$. $M$ must be a finite number, otherwise if $M=-\\infty$, we would have $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty}f(f(x)) = -\\infty$, which contradicts $\\exp(x) \\to 0$. So $M \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   The range of $f$ is $(M, \\infty)$.\n    *   By continuity, $f(M) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(f(x)) = 0$.\n    *   Since $f(x)>x$ for all $x$, we must have $f(M)>M$, which means $0>M$. So $M$ must be negative.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing solutions and determining the cardinality\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the number of strictly increasing continuous functions satisfying the given properties. The existence of at least one such function is a non-trivial result from the theory of functional equations (related to fractional iteration or \"functional roots\"). Let's assume at least one such function exists. We can show that there is a continuum of solutions.\n\nConsider the construction of a solution $f$. We know there is a unique $M<0$ for this solution such that $f(M)=0$.\nThis leads to a sequence of points:\n$c_0 = M$\n$c_1 = f(c_0) = 0$\n$c_2 = f(c_1) = f(0)$. From $f(f(M))=\\exp(M)$, we get $f(f(M))=f(0)=\\exp(M)$, so $c_2 = \\exp(M)$.\n$c_3 = f(c_2) = f(\\exp(M))$. From $f(f(0))=\\exp(0)=1$, and using $f(0)=c_2$, we get $f(c_2)=1$. So $c_3=1$.\nAnd so on. The function $f$ must map the interval $[c_n, c_{n+1}]$ to $[c_{n+1}, c_{n+2}]$.\n\nThe key insight is the amount of freedom in constructing such a function.\n1.  We can choose the value of $M \\in (-\\infty, 0)$. A different choice of $M$ leads to a different function, as the asymptotic behavior as $x \\to -\\infty$ will be different. There are uncountably many choices for $M$.\n2.  For a fixed $M<0$, we can start building the function. $f$ maps the interval $[M, 0]$ to the interval $[0, \\exp(M)]$. Any strictly increasing continuous function $g: [M, 0] \\to [0, \\exp(M)]$ can be a candidate for $f$ on this starting interval.\n3.  The set of all strictly increasing continuous functions from one interval to another is uncountably infinite. For instance, for any two such functions $g_1, g_2$, their weighted average $t g_1 + (1-t)g_2$ (for $t \\in (0,1)$) is also such a function. This alone creates a continuum of choices for the definition of $f$ on just the interval $[M, 0]$.\n4.  Once $f$ is defined on $[M, 0]$, its definition on other intervals like $[0, \\exp(M)]$, $[\\exp(M), 1]$, etc., is determined by the original equation (e.g., for $y \\in [0, \\exp(M)]$, let $y=f(x)$ for some $x \\in [M,0]$, then $f(y)=f(f(x))=\\exp(x)=\\exp(f^{-1}(y))$).\n\nThis line of reasoning demonstrates that there is a vast amount of freedom in constructing a solution. The number of ways to choose the initial building blocks (like the value of $M$ and the function $g$ on a starting interval) is uncountable. Each distinct choice leads to a distinct solution function $f$.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is at least the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}|$.\nThe set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ itself has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. The set $S$ is a subset of this set, so its cardinality can be no more than $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nCombining these two facts, the cardinality of the set $S$ must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The cardinality is that of the continuum ($2^{\\aleph_0}$ or $\\mathfrak{c}$).\n\n>>>$\\mathfrak{c}$"
