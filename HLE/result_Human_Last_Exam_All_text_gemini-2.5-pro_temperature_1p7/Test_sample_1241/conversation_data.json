    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$. This represents the sum of the probabilities of being in state 0 and state 1 at steady state (as time $t \\to \\infty$). At steady state, the probabilities are constant, so their derivatives with respect to time are zero. Let $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ for $i=0, 1, 2, 3$.\n\n**2. Formulate the Steady-State Equations**\nBy setting the time derivatives $P_i'(t)$ to zero in the given system of differential equations, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations:\n(1) $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}$\n(2) $0 = \\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n(3) $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}$\n(4) $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n\nWe also have the normalization condition, which states that the sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n(5) $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\n**3. Substitute the Given Values**\nLet's plug the given values of $\\lambda_{ij}$ into the equations:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nThe system becomes:\n(1) $0 = -0.019 P_{0} + 0.65 P_{1}$\n(2) $0 = 0.019 P_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4) P_{1} + 0.392 P_{2} + 0.008 P_{3}$\n(3) $0 = 0.4 P_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) P_{2}$\n(4) $0 = 0.008 P_{2} - 0.008 P_{3}$\n(5) $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\n**4. Solve the System of Linear Equations**\nWe will solve the system by expressing $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.\n\n*   From equation (4):\n    $0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_3 = P_2$.\n    *Careful point: Check the values. Here $\\lambda_{23}=\\lambda_{31}$, which leads to a simple relationship.*\n\n*   From equation (3):\n    $0.4 P_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) P_2$\n    $0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_1 = P_2$.\n    *Careful point: A coincidence in the numbers makes the calculation simpler. $\\lambda_{12} = \\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}$.*\n    Combining these, we get $P_1 = P_2 = P_3$.\n\n*   From equation (1):\n    $0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1$.\n    *Careful point: It's often better to work with fractions to avoid rounding errors.*\n\nAt this stage, we have expressed $P_0$, $P_2$, and $P_3$ in terms of $P_1$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1$\n$P_2 = P_1$\n$P_3 = P_1$\nNote: Equation (2) is redundant (linearly dependent on the others), but we can use it for verification if needed.\n\n**5. Use the Normalization Condition**\nSubstitute the expressions for $P_0, P_2, P_3$ into equation (5):\n$P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19} P_1\\right) + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n\nCombine the terms with $P_1$:\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 1 + 1 + 1\\right) P_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 3\\right) P_1 = 1$\n\nFind a common denominator:\n$\\left(\\frac{650}{19} + \\frac{3 \\times 19}{19}\\right) P_1 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}\\right) P_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} P_1 = 1$\n\nSolve for $P_1$:\n$P_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for $P_0 + P_1$. First, we calculate $P_0$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\nNow, calculate the sum $P_0 + P_1$:\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\nTo get the final numerical answer, we perform the division:\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to a reasonable number of significant figures (e.g., five decimal places), we get 0.94625.\n\nFinal calculation:\n$P_0 = 650/707$\n$P_1 = 19/707$\n$P_2 = 19/707$\n$P_3 = 19/707$\nSum Check: $(650+19+19+19)/707 = 707/707 = 1$. The individual probabilities are correct.\nRequired Value: $P_0 + P_1 = 650/707 + 19/707 = 669/707$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n$669 \\div 707 \\approx 0.946251768$\n\nLet's provide the answer as a decimal rounded to six digits.\n\nFinal Answer: $0.946252$\n\n<<<0.9462517680339462>>>"
