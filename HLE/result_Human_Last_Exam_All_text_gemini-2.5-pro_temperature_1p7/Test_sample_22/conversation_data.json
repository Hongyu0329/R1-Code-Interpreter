    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of SNP Heritability (h²_SNP).**\n*   **Heritability** is a concept in genetics that estimates the proportion of variation in a specific trait (phenotype) within a population that can be attributed to genetic variation among individuals.\n*   **SNP heritability (h²_SNP)** specifically refers to the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are typically measured by a genotyping array.\n*   Crucially, h²_SNP is a *theoretical upper bound* or a ceiling. It represents the maximum possible predictive power you could achieve if you could build a perfect linear predictive model using all the considered SNPs with their true, unknown effect sizes. It is a parameter of the population.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the definition of a Polygenic Score (PGS) and its predictive ability.**\n*   A **Polygenic Score (PGS)**, also known as a polygenic risk score (PRS), is a tool used to predict an individual's phenotype based on their genotype.\n*   It is constructed by summing up the effects of many SNPs. The \"effect\" of each SNP (its weight in the score) is *estimated* from a large-scale genetic study called a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   The **predictive ability** of a PGS is measured by how well it can predict the phenotype in a *new, independent sample* (one not used to create the score). This is typically quantified by R², which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype explained by the PGS.\n\n**Step 3: Compare SNP heritability (h²_SNP) and PGS predictive ability (R²).**\n*   The core difference lies in what each value represents. h²_SNP is the **theoretical maximum** variance that can be explained. The R² of a PGS is the **actual, realized** variance explained by a specific predictive model.\n*   The PGS model is built using *estimated* effect sizes from a GWAS. Since the GWAS is conducted on a finite sample of people, these estimates are not perfect; they contain statistical noise or error.\n*   Because the weights used to build the PGS are imperfect estimates rather than the true values, the resulting score cannot capture all the genetic signal perfectly.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze why PGS predictive ability is lower than SNP heritability.**\nThere are several reasons why the R² of a PGS is lower than h²_SNP:\n1.  **Imperfect Effect Size Estimates:** This is the primary reason. A GWAS has a finite sample size, so the estimated effect of each SNP comes with uncertainty. This estimation error reduces the accuracy of the final PGS when applied to a new sample. A larger GWAS leads to better estimates and a higher PGS R², bringing it closer to the h²_SNP ceiling, but it can't reach it with a finite sample.\n2.  **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Mismatch:** The patterns of correlation between SNPs (LD) might differ between the GWAS sample and the prediction sample, which can reduce predictive accuracy.\n3.  **Genetic Architecture:** The PGS model makes simplifying assumptions (e.g., that effects are additive) which may not perfectly match the true underlying biology of the trait.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude on the word \"necessarily\".**\n*   The term \"necessarily\" implies that this relationship must always hold true.\n*   Given that any real-world PGS is built from data from a finite sample, the effect size estimates will *always* have some degree of error.\n*   Because of this inherent estimation error, the performance of the practical predictor (the PGS) will necessarily be degraded compared to the theoretical ideal (represented by h²_SNP). The only way for the PGS R² to equal the h²_SNP would be if the effect sizes were known perfectly, which would require an infinitely large GWAS sample—a theoretical impossibility.\n*   Therefore, the predictive ability of a polygenic score is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability.\n\n<<<True"
