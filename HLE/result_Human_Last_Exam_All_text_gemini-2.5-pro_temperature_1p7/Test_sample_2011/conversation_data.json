    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** We are dealing with a graph `G` that has a set of 128 vertices.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size `k` is denoted as `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a set of vertices `S`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` consists of the vertices in `S` and *all* the edges from the original graph `G` that connect pairs of vertices within `S`.\n*   **Clique as an Induced Subgraph:** A set of `k` vertices forms a clique if and only if the subgraph induced by these `k` vertices is a complete graph `K_k`. Thus, the phrase \"clique sizes that appear as induced subgraphs\" simply refers to the sizes of cliques present in the graph.\n\n**Step 2: Rephrase the question**\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible value for `m`, where `m` is the number of different integers `k` for which a given graph `G` (with 128 vertices) contains a clique of size `k`.\n\nLet's denote `C(G)` as the set of all integers `k` such that `G` has a clique of size `k`. The problem is to find the maximum possible value of `|C(G)|` over all possible graphs `G` with 128 vertices.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the set of clique sizes**\n\nLet's consider any graph `G`. Let `K_max` be the size of the largest clique in `G`. This value is also known as the clique number of `G`, denoted `omega(G)`.\nBy definition, there exists a clique in `G` of size `K_max`. Let the set of vertices in this largest clique be `S_max`. `|S_max| = K_max`.\n\nNow, let's consider any integer `j` such that `1 <= j <= K_max`.\nCan we find a clique of size `j` in `G`?\nYes. We can simply take any subset of `j` vertices from the large clique `S_max`. Let this subset be `S_j`. Since every vertex in `S_max` is connected to every other vertex in `S_max`, the same must be true for the subset `S_j`. Therefore, `S_j` forms a clique of size `j`.\n\nThis leads to a crucial insight: If a graph contains a clique of size `K_max`, it must also contain cliques of all smaller integer sizes, from 1 to `K_max - 1`.\nTherefore, the set of all possible clique sizes in any graph `G` is not an arbitrary collection of numbers but is always a consecutive set of integers starting from 1:\n`C(G) = {1, 2, 3, ..., omega(G)}`\nThe number of different clique sizes is simply `|C(G)| = omega(G)`.\n\n**Step 4: Reduce the problem to finding the maximum clique number**\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 3, the problem of maximizing the number of different clique sizes is equivalent to maximizing the clique number, `omega(G)`, over all graphs `G` with 128 vertices.\n\nSo, the question is now simplified to: \"What is the maximum possible clique number for a graph on `n=128` vertices?\"\n\n**Step 5: Determine the maximum clique number**\n\nA clique in a graph is a subset of its vertices. Therefore, the size of any clique cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph. For a graph with `n=128` vertices, the clique number `omega(G)` can be at most 128.\n\nTo show that this maximum is achievable, we need to construct a graph `G` on 128 vertices that has a clique number of 128. The complete graph, `K_128`, is such a graph. In `K_128`, all 128 vertices are connected to each other, forming a single large clique of size 128.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The maximum possible clique number for a graph with 128 vertices is 128.\n*   Since the number of different clique sizes in any graph `G` is equal to its clique number `omega(G)`, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is also 128.\n*   This maximum is achieved by the complete graph `K_128`, which contains induced cliques of every size from 1 to 128, for a total of 128 different sizes.\n\n<<<128>>>"
