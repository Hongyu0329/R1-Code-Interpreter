    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all edges of the complete graph $K_{35}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that cover all edges of the complete graph $K_n$ where $n=35$.\n\n*   **Complete Graph $K_{35}$:** This is a graph with 35 vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n*   **Family of Bipartite Graphs:** We are looking for a collection of bipartite graphs, say $\\{B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k\\}$.\n*   **Covering all edges:** The union of the edge sets of all these bipartite graphs must be equal to the edge set of $K_{35}$. That is, every edge in $K_{35}$ must be present in at least one of the graphs $B_i$.\n*   **Minimizing the number of graphs:** The phrasing \"minimum number of vertices in a family\" is ambiguous. A standard interpretation in this context is that it is a misphrasing for the \"minimum number of bipartite graphs in the family\". Let's call this number $k$. This is a well-known problem in graph theory, often referred to as finding the bipartite dimension of a complete graph.\n\n**2. Formulating the Condition for Edge Covering**\n\nLet the set of vertices of $K_{35}$ be $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{35}\\}$.\n*   Each bipartite graph $B_i$ in the family partitions the vertex set $V$ into two disjoint subsets, let's call them $X_i$ and $Y_i$ (where $V = X_i \\cup Y_i$ and $X_i \\cap Y_i = \\emptyset$).\n*   The edges of $B_i$ are a subset of the edges of the complete bipartite graph on the partition $(X_i, Y_i)$. To cover the maximum number of edges, we can assume each $B_i$ is a complete bipartite graph with partition $(X_i, Y_i)$. An edge $(u, v)$ exists in such a graph if and only if $u$ and $v$ are in different partitions (i.e., one is in $X_i$ and the other is in $Y_i$).\n\n**3. Representing Partitions with Binary Strings**\n\nWe can represent the partition $(X_i, Y_i)$ for each graph $B_i$ using a binary assignment. For each vertex $v \\in V$, we can define a coordinate $c_i(v)$:\n*   $c_i(v) = 0$ if $v \\in X_i$\n*   $c_i(v) = 1$ if $v \\in Y_i$\n\nSo, for a family of $k$ bipartite graphs, we can associate a binary vector (or string) of length $k$ with each vertex $v$:\n$c(v) = (c_1(v), c_2(v), \\dots, c_k(v))$.\n\n**4. The Core Insight**\n\n*   An edge $(u,v)$ is covered by the graph $B_i$ if and only if vertices $u$ and $v$ are in different partitions of $B_i$. In our binary representation, this means $c_i(u) \\neq c_i(v)$.\n*   For the entire family of $k$ graphs to cover all edges of $K_{35}$, for any pair of distinct vertices $u, v$, there must be at least one graph $B_i$ that contains the edge $(u,v)$.\n*   This means that for any two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$, there must be at least one index $i$ such that $c_i(u) \\neq c_i(v)$.\n*   This condition is equivalent to saying that the binary vectors associated with any two distinct vertices must be different. That is, if $u \\neq v$, then $c(u) \\neq c(v)$.\n\n**5. Finding the Minimum Number of Graphs ($k$)**\n\nWe need to assign a unique binary vector of length $k$ to each of the $n=35$ vertices.\n*   The total number of distinct binary vectors of length $k$ is $2^k$.\n*   To assign a unique vector to each of the 35 vertices, the number of available vectors must be at least the number of vertices. This gives us the inequality:\n    $2^k \\ge n$\n*   In our case, $n = 35$, so we need to find the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies:\n    $2^k \\ge 35$\n\n**6. Solving the Inequality**\n\nLet's test powers of 2:\n*   $2^1 = 2$\n*   $2^2 = 4$\n*   $2^3 = 8$\n*   $2^4 = 16$\n*   $2^5 = 32$ (This is less than 35, so $k=5$ is not sufficient).\n*   $2^6 = 64$ (This is greater than or equal to 35, so $k=6$ is sufficient).\n\nThe smallest integer $k$ that satisfies the condition is 6. This can also be expressed using the ceiling of a logarithm: $k = \\lceil \\log_2(35) \\rceil = 6$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ambiguous Phrasing:** The most critical point is interpreting \"minimum number of vertices in a family\" correctly. As reasoned above, it most plausibly means the \"minimum number of graphs in the family.\" Other interpretations are not standard or lead to different, more complex problems.\n*   **Covering vs. Partitioning:** This problem is about *covering* edges, meaning an edge can appear in multiple bipartite graphs. This is different from *partitioning* the edges (where each edge must belong to exactly one graph), which is a harder problem (the Graham-Pollak theorem states that partitioning the edges of $K_n$ into complete bipartite graphs requires exactly $n-1$ graphs).\n*   **Construction:** The argument shows that $k$ must be at least $\\lceil \\log_2(n) \\rceil$. The assignment of unique binary vectors to vertices demonstrates that this number is also sufficient, providing a constructive proof for the minimum value.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover all the edges of $K_{35}$ is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
