    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Phenomenon - Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC)**\nSPDC is a quantum optical process that is classified as a second-order nonlinear optical effect. In this process, a single high-energy photon (from a \"pump\" source) interacts with a nonlinear material and is annihilated, creating a pair of lower-energy photons (conventionally called the \"signal\" and \"idler\"). For this process to occur, energy and momentum must be conserved.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Material Requirement for SPDC**\nThe key requirement for any material to exhibit second-order nonlinear optical effects, including SPDC and the related process of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG), is that the material's crystal structure must **lack a center of inversion symmetry**.\n\n*   **Symmetry and Nonlinear Optics:** In materials with inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric materials), the second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, denoted as χ⁽²⁾, is identically zero. Since the strength of any second-order process is proportional to the square of the magnitude of χ⁽²⁾, these effects are forbidden in centrosymmetric materials under the electric dipole approximation.\n*   **Conclusion for this step:** The question \"would free-standing boron nanosheets exhibit SPDC?\" is equivalent to asking \"Do free-standing boron nanosheets have a crystal structure that lacks inversion symmetry?\"\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Crystal Structure of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\nUnlike graphene, which has a single, highly stable hexagonal lattice, boron nanosheets are polymorphic, meaning they can exist in several different structural phases. We must examine the symmetry of these common phases.\n\n*   **Common Phases:** The most widely studied and experimentally realized phases of free-standing borophene include the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, as well as various \"striped\" phases.\n*   **Symmetry Analysis:**\n    *   Both the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, despite their buckled nature, belong to the orthorhombic space group *Pmmn* (No. 59).\n    *   The common buckled striped phases of borophene also belong to the *Pmmn* space group.\n*   **Inversion Center:** The *Pmmn* space group is **centrosymmetric**. This means it possesses centers of inversion. Although the sheets are buckled (some atoms are out-of-plane), the overall arrangement of atoms in the unit cell is symmetric with respect to an inversion point. An atom at position (x, y, z) relative to this point has an identical atom at (-x, -y, -z).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Draw a Conclusion**\n1.  SPDC requires a non-centrosymmetric material (non-zero χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric (*Pmmn* space group).\n3.  Therefore, the intrinsic, bulk second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) of these boron nanosheets is zero.\n4.  As a result, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion as an intrinsic, bulk property.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Ideal vs. Real Material:** This analysis applies to an ideal, defect-free, infinite boron nanosheet. In real samples, effects that break the local inversion symmetry can occur.\n2.  **Edge Effects:** The edges of a finite-sized nanosheet inherently break the periodicity and inversion symmetry of the bulk lattice. It is possible to observe second-order effects originating specifically from the edges, but this is not a property of the bulk material.\n3.  **Defects and Strain:** Structural defects, impurities, or the application of a non-uniform strain field can locally disrupt the inversion symmetry and potentially lead to a weak, localized second-order optical response.\n4.  **Substrate Interaction:** The question specifies \"free-standing\". If the nanosheet were placed on a substrate, the interaction between the nanosheet and the substrate could break the overall symmetry of the system, potentially enabling SPDC. However, this would not be an intrinsic property of the boron nanosheet itself.\n5.  **Electric Field Induced Effects:** A strong external DC electric field can break the inversion symmetry of a centrosymmetric material, inducing a second-order response. This is known as Electric-Field-Induced Second-Harmonic generation (EFISH) or a similar effect for SPDC. However, this is an induced effect, not a spontaneous one occurring just from excitation by incident light.\n\nBased on the intrinsic properties of the material as requested by the question, the conclusion holds.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe process hinges on the material having a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is only possible for non-centrosymmetric materials. The most common and stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets possess crystal structures that are centrosymmetric. Therefore, their intrinsic bulk χ⁽²⁾ is zero, and they are not expected to exhibit SPDC.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect that requires the material to have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. The common, stable phases of boron nanosheets (borophene) possess inversion symmetry (i.e., they are centrosymmetric), which forbids second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC.>>>"
