No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical effect that requires the material to have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. The common, stable phases of boron nanosheets (borophene) possess inversion symmetry (i.e., they are centrosymmetric), which forbids second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC.
