    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ratio of the two products.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactant and Reaction Type**\nThe reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is a linear conjugated polyene with four double bonds. The total number of π electrons is 4 × 2 = 8 electrons.\nThe reaction is an electrocyclic ring closure under thermal conditions. An 8-π electron system cyclizes to form a cyclooctatriene ring. The reaction involves forming a σ-bond between the termini of the conjugated system, which are C2 and C9. The products are described as *cis*- and *trans*-isomers of 5,6-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,7-triene.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory for the \"Allowed\" Pathway**\nAccording to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules and FMO theory, the stereochemical outcome of an electrocyclic reaction is determined by the symmetry of the Frontier Molecular Orbital.\n*   **System:** 8 π-electrons. This is a 4n system, where n=2.\n*   **Condition:** Thermal.\n*   **Governing FMO:** For a thermal reaction, the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) determines the course. For an 8 π-electron system, the electrons occupy ψ₁, ψ₂, ψ₃, and ψ₄. Thus, the HOMO is ψ₄.\n*   **Symmetry of HOMO (ψ₄):** For a linear polyene MO ψₙ, the p-orbitals at the termini have opposite phases if n is even and the same phase if n is odd. Since n=4 (even), the terminal p-orbitals on C2 and C9 have **opposite phases**.\n*   **Mode of Ring Closure:** To form a bonding σ-orbital, the lobes that overlap must have the same phase. For terminal orbitals with opposite phases, this requires a **conrotatory** motion (both orbitals rotate in the same direction, either both clockwise or both counter-clockwise).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry of the \"Allowed\" Product (Product B)**\nThe stereochemistry of the product depends on the arrangement of the substituents at the termini (C2 and C9) and the mode of ring closure (conrotatory).\nThe substituents are a methyl group (Me) and a hydrogen atom (H) at each end.\n*   **At C2 (from 2Z configuration):** For a Z-double bond in the reactive s-cis conformation, one substituent points \"inward\" toward the forming ring, and one points \"outward\". Let's determine which is which. The (2Z) designation means the higher priority group on C2 (the rest of the chain, C3) and the higher priority group on C3 (C4) are on the same side of the C2=C3 bond. The substituents on C2 are Me and H. In the curled reactive conformation, the Me group points **inward** and the H atom points **outward**.\n*   **At C9 (from 8E configuration):** For an E-double bond, the substituents are arranged differently. The (8E) designation means the higher priority group on C8 (the C7 chain) and the higher priority group on C9 (the C8 atom) are on opposite sides of the C8=C9 double bond. This places the Me group on C9 pointing **outward** and the H atom pointing **inward**.\n\nSo, for the conrotatory closure:\n*   The two methyl groups are arranged as (one **in**, one **out**).\n*   The two hydrogen atoms are arranged as (one **out**, one **in**).\n\nFor a conrotatory closure, groups that are arranged (in, out) end up *trans* in the product. Therefore, the allowed conrotatory pathway produces the **trans-isomer (B)**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Formation of the \"Forbidden\" Product (Product A)**\nThe problem states that a second isomer, the *cis*-isomer (A), is also formed. Based on the same substituent analysis:\n*   The two methyl groups are (in, out). For them to become *cis*, a **disrotatory** closure is required.\n*   The two hydrogen atoms are (out, in). For them to become *cis*, a **disrotatory** closure is also required.\n\nSo, the *cis*-isomer (A) must be formed via a disrotatory pathway. This pathway is \"forbidden\" by simple FMO theory because it would involve an anti-bonding interaction between the HOMO (ψ₄) termini in the transition state.\n\n**Step 5: Reconcile Theory with Observation and Predict the Ratio**\nSimple FMO theory predicts only the formation of product B, meaning a ratio of A:B = 0:1. However, the problem explicitly states that A is also formed, which points to a known exception to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n*   **Steric Effects:** The planar all-s-cis conformation required for cyclization is sterically strained. To relieve this strain (e.g., between hydrogens on C3 and C6), the polyene must adopt a non-planar, helical conformation.\n*   **Advanced FMO Theory in Helical Systems:** In a helical (non-planar) system, the p-orbitals are no longer perfectly aligned. This distortion causes mixing between the molecular orbitals of the ideal planar system. Specifically, the true HOMO of the helical molecule is a mixture of the planar system's HOMO (ψ₄) and HOMO-1 (ψ₃).\n    *   HOMO_helical ≈ c₁⋅ψ₄ + c₂⋅ψ₃\n*   **Competition between Pathways:**\n    *   The conrotatory pathway is electronically allowed due to the ψ₄ component (coefficient c₁). However, the conrotatory motion in a helix can be sterically hindered as one substituent must rotate through the center of the helix.\n    *   The disrotatory pathway is electronically allowed due to the ψ₃ component (coefficient c₂). This \"forbidden\" path may be sterically less hindered than the \"allowed\" conrotatory path.\n*   **Predicting the Ratio:** The ratio of the products A (from disrotation) to B (from conrotation) will depend on the relative rates of the two competing pathways, which in turn depend on their activation energies. In this orbital mixing model, the ratio of rates can be approximated by the square of the orbital coefficients:\n    Ratio [A]/[B] = k_dis / k_con ≈ (c₂)² / (c₁)²\n*   **The Specific Case of (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene:** The question implies that FMO theory can lead to a specific numerical ratio without complex calculations. This suggests that the molecule represents a special case. The three Z-bonds introduce significant helicity, which promotes the mixing of orbitals and makes the forbidden disrotatory path more accessible. The single terminal E-bond might counteract this twisting effect compared to an all-Z isomer. This specific combination of Z and E bonds can be seen as creating a scenario where the steric hindrance of the allowed path and the electronic penalty of the forbidden path balance each other out. This means the activation energies for both pathways become nearly equal.\n    ΔG‡(disrotatory) ≈ ΔG‡(conrotatory)\n    If the activation barriers are equal, the rates of formation are equal.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of product A to product B is predicted to be 1:1.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nThe ratio of A to B is asked for.\nRatio = [A] / [B] = 1 / 1 = 1.\n\n>>>1:1"
