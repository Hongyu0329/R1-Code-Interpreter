    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve in the interval $t\\in[0,\\pi]$.**\nIn this interval, the parameter $b=1$. The equations for the curve are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\sin t$\nWe can recognize this as the standard parameterization of a unit circle. Since $t$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi$, this part of the curve traces the upper semi-circle of the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.\nLet's find the extreme coordinates for this part:\n*   When $t=0$, $(x,y) = (\\cos 0, \\sin 0) = (1,0)$.\n*   When $t=\\pi/2$, $(x,y) = (\\cos(\\pi/2), \\sin(\\pi/2)) = (0,1)$.\n*   When $t=\\pi$, $(x,y) = (\\cos \\pi, \\sin \\pi) = (-1,0)$.\nFor this section, the x-coordinates range from -1 to 1, and the y-coordinates range from 0 to 1.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the parametric curve in the interval $t\\in(\\pi, 2\\pi)$.**\nIn this interval, the parameter $b=5$. The equations for the curve are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 5\\sin t$\nThis can be recognized as the parameterization of an ellipse. We can find its Cartesian equation:\n$x^2 = \\cos^2 t$\n$(y/5)^2 = \\sin^2 t$\nAdding these gives the equation of the ellipse: $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1$.\nSince $t$ ranges from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $\\sin t$ will be less than or equal to 0. This means this part of the curve traces the lower semi-ellipse.\nLet's find the extreme coordinates for this part:\n*   As $t \\to \\pi^+$, $(x,y) \\to (\\cos \\pi, 5\\sin \\pi) = (-1,0)$.\n*   When $t=3\\pi/2$, $(x,y) = (\\cos(3\\pi/2), 5\\sin(3\\pi/2)) = (0, -5)$.\n*   As $t \\to 2\\pi^-$, $(x,y) \\to (\\cos(2\\pi), 5\\sin(2\\pi)) = (1,0)$.\nFor this section, the x-coordinates range from -1 to 1, and the y-coordinates range from -5 to 0.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the overall dimensions (bounding box) of the figure.**\nBy combining the two parts, we can find the overall minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates.\n*   **x-coordinates:** In both parts, the x-values range from -1 to 1. So, $x_{min} = -1$ and $x_{max} = 1$.\n*   **y-coordinates:** The first part covers the y-range $[0, 1]$. The second part covers the y-range $[-5, 0]$. Combining these, the total y-range is $[-5, 1]$. So, $y_{min} = -5$ and $y_{max} = 1$.\n\nThe total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\nThe total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the smallest square that outcircles (circumscribes) the figure.**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. A square that contains this rectangle must have a side length at least as long as the larger of the rectangle's dimensions.\nThe side length of the smallest square, $s$, must be equal to the maximum of the width and height.\n$s = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the area of this smallest square.**\nThe area of a square with side length $s$ is $A = s^2$.\n$A = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Pay close attention to the piecewise definition of the parameter $b$. It defines two different geometric shapes for the two intervals of $t$.\n*   Correctly identify the range of $x$ and $y$ for each part of the curve and then combine them to find the overall range.\n*   The term \"outcircles\" means to contain or circumscribe. The smallest square that contains a rectangle of size $W \\times H$ has a side length of $\\max(W,H)$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
