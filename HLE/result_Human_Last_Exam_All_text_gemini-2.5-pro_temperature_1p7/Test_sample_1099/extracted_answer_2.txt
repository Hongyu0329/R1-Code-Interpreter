The minimal resources required, on average, are a combination of classical communication ($C_{avg}$ bits) and non-signaling PR-boxes ($P_{avg}$) such that their sum equals one: $C_{avg} + P_{avg} = 1$. This includes the specific cases of using 1 bit of communication and 0 PR-boxes, or 1 PR-box and 0 communication.
