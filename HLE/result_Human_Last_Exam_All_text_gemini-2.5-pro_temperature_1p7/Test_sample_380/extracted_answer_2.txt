No, for a general and accurate calculation, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered to be radial. The correct procedure is to use the components of the magnetic field perpendicular to the local average magnetic field direction, as AIC waves propagate along these field lines. Using a radial-based system is only valid in the special case of a "radial IMF" interval where the local magnetic field happens to be aligned with the radial direction.
