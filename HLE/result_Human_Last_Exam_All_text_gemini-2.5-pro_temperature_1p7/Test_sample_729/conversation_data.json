    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup H of a group G is called a power subgroup if it can be generated by a single element of G. In other words, H is a cyclic subgroup. So, the question asks for the number of distinct cyclic subgroups in the group.\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128:** The generalized quaternion group of order 4n is denoted $Q_{4n}$ and is defined by the presentation:\n    $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    For our group of size 128, we have $4n = 128$, which means $n = 32$. The specific presentation is:\n    $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\n**2. Classify the Elements of Q_128**\n\nThe elements of $Q_{128}$ can be partitioned into two types:\n*   Elements that are powers of $x$: $\\{x^k \\mid 0 \\le k < 64\\}$. These form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n*   Elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$: $\\{x^k y \\mid 0 \\le k < 64\\}$. There are 64 such elements.\n\nWe will find the number of cyclic subgroups generated by elements of each type.\n\n**3. Case 1: Cyclic subgroups contained within `<x>`**\n\n*   The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64.\n*   A fundamental theorem of group theory states that for any cyclic group of order `m`, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of `m`.\n*   We need to find the number of divisors of 64, which is denoted by $\\tau(64)$.\n*   Since $64 = 2^6$, the number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6 + 1 = 7$.\n*   These 7 subgroups correspond to the divisors of 64 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64) and are generated by $\\langle x^{64/d} \\rangle$ for each divisor `d`.\n*   **Careful Point:** These 7 subgroups are all distinct and are all cyclic.\n\n**4. Case 2: Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form `x^k y`**\n\n*   First, we must determine the order of an element $g = x^k y$.\n    *   $g^2 = (x^k y)(x^k y) = x^k(yx^k)y = x^k(x^{-k}y)y = x^k x^{-k} y^2 = y^2$.\n    *   From the group presentation, $y^2 = x^{32}$. So, $g^2 = x^{32}$.\n    *   The element $x^{32}$ has order 2 (since $(x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$), so $g^2 \\ne 1$.\n    *   $g^4 = (g^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n    *   This shows that every element of the form $x^k y$ has order 4.\n*   Next, we count the number of *distinct* cyclic subgroups generated by these elements.\n    *   Let $H_k = \\langle x^k y \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order 4.\n    *   A cyclic group of order 4 has $\\phi(4) = 2$ generators.\n    *   The generators of $H_k$ are $g = x^k y$ and $g^3$. Let's compute $g^3$:\n        $g^3 = g^2 \\cdot g = x^{32} \\cdot x^k y = x^{k+32} y$.\n    *   So, the two generators of $H_k$ are $x^k y$ and $x^{k+32} y$. This means $\\langle x^k y \\rangle = \\langle x^{k+32} y \\rangle$.\n    *   There are 64 elements of the form $x^k y$ (for $k=0, 1, ..., 63$). Since each cyclic subgroup of this type has two such elements as its generators, the number of distinct subgroups is the total number of these elements divided by 2.\n    *   Number of subgroups = $64 / 2 = 32$.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must check if any of these 32 subgroups are identical to any of the 7 subgroups found in Case 1. The subgroups in Case 1 consist solely of powers of $x$. The subgroups in Case 2 all contain elements of the form $x^k y$, which are not powers of $x$. Therefore, the two sets of subgroups are disjoint.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nTo find the total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups), we sum the counts from the two disjoint cases.\n\n*   Number of cyclic subgroups from Case 1 = 7\n*   Number of cyclic subgroups from Case 2 = 32\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{39}$.\n<<<39>>>"
