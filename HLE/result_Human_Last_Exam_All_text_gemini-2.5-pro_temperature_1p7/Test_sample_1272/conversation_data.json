    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to the Ming Dynasty's occupation of Vietnam, known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination (1407-1427). The key figures are the Chinese Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟) and the Vietnamese resistance leader Lê Lợi, who initiated the Lam Sơn Uprising in 1418.\n\n2.  **Define \"First Major Defeat\":** A \"major defeat\" implies a significant military engagement with substantial losses in troops and high-ranking officers, leading to strategic consequences. It is distinct from minor skirmishes or tactical retreats. We are looking for the *first* such event in which Mu Sheng was the commanding general.\n\n3.  **Review Mu Sheng's Early Campaigns (1418-1424):** In the initial years of the Lam Sơn Uprising, Lê Lợi's forces were relatively small and mostly confined to the mountainous regions of Thanh Hóa. While there were many battles, the Ming forces, under the overall command of Mu Sheng (who was based in Yunnan but directed operations), were generally successful in containing the rebellion. Lê Lợi's forces suffered several setbacks during this period. Therefore, Mu Sheng's first major defeat did not occur in this early phase.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Turning Point (1424-1425):** The turning point of the war came in late 1424 when Lê Lợi, on the advice of his strategist Nguyễn Chích, shifted his operations south from the mountains of Thanh Hóa into the less-defended and populous province of Nghệ An. The Lam Sơn army quickly captured the provincial capital and gained widespread popular support.\n\n5.  **Identify the Decisive Battle:** In response to losing control of Nghệ An, the Ming court ordered a massive counter-attack in early 1425. General Mu Sheng personally led a large army from Yunnan into Nghệ An to crush the rebellion. He was joined by other generals, including Chen Zhi and Li An. Lê Lợi anticipated this move and prepared an ambush.\n\n6.  **The Battle of Khả Lưu Pass - Bồ Ải (1425):**\n    *   **Location:** The ambush was set at the strategic Khả Lưu Pass (đèo Khả Lưu) and in the vicinity of Bồ Ải, located in the western, mountainous part of Nghệ An.\n    *   **Outcome:** The Ming army marched into the trap and was decisively routed. The Vietnamese forces inflicted heavy casualties. Ming General Li An was killed in action, and another general, Chen Zhi, was captured. Mu Sheng himself was defeated and forced to flee, barely escaping with his life.\n    *   **Significance:** This was a catastrophic failure for the Ming. It was the first time a large army, personally commanded by Mu Sheng, was shattered in a major battle during the Lam Sơn Uprising. The defeat solidified Lê Lợi's control over Nghệ An and allowed him to expand his operations, marking a crucial step towards final victory.\n\n7.  **Map the Historical Location to a Modern Province:** The historical site of the Battle of Khả Lưu Pass is located within the territory of the modern-day **Nghệ An Province** in Vietnam.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the historical records, the Battle of Khả Lưu Pass in 1425 was the first major defeat suffered by an army under the personal command of General Mu Sheng during the Lam Sơn Uprising. This battle took place in the area that is now part of Nghệ An Province.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
