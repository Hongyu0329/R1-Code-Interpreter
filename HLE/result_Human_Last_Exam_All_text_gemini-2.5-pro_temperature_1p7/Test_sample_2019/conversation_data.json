    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Board and Constraints\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid.\n*   **Toroidal:** The board wraps around on its edges. This means row 0 is adjacent to row 4, and column 0 is adjacent to column 4. We can think of coordinates as being calculated modulo 5.\n*   **Pieces:** 4 queens.\n*   **Non-Attacking Condition:** No two queens can threaten each other. On a standard board, this means they cannot be in the same row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board, the diagonal attack is extended.\n\nLet two queens be at positions `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)`, where `r` is the row and `c` is the column, indexed from 0 to 4. They attack each other if any of the following conditions are met:\n1.  **Same Row:** `r1 = r2`\n2.  **Same Column:** `c1 = c2`\n3.  **Same \"Sum\" Diagonal:** `(r1 + c1) mod 5 = (r2 + c2) mod 5`\n4.  **Same \"Difference\" Diagonal:** `(r1 - c1) mod 5 = (r2 - c2) mod 5`\n\nThe goal is to find the number of sets of 4 coordinates `{(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)}` that satisfy these non-attacking conditions. Since the queens are identical, the order of the coordinates in the set does not matter.\n\n### Step 2: Devise a Counting Strategy\n\nA direct approach of trying all `C(25, 4)` combinations and checking for attacks is too cumbersome. A more systematic approach is to place the queens one by one and use the board's symmetries to simplify the counting.\n\nWe will calculate the number of **ordered** placements of 4 non-attacking queens, `(Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)`, and then divide by `4!` (the number of ways to order 4 queens) to get the number of unordered sets.\n\n### Step 3: Execute the Counting, Placing Queens Sequentially\n\n**A. Placing the 1st Queen (Q1)**\n*   There are 25 squares to place the first queen.\n*   Due to the toroidal nature of the board, all squares are equivalent by symmetry (we can always shift the board so any chosen square becomes `(0,0)`).\n*   Let's place Q1 at `(0,0)` and multiply our final result by 25.\n*   **Number of choices for Q1 = 25.**\n\n**B. Placing the 2nd Queen (Q2)**\n*   With Q1 at `(0,0)`, we need to find the number of squares not attacked by Q1.\n    *   Attacked by Row 0: 4 squares.\n    *   Attacked by Column 0: 4 squares.\n    *   Attacked by \"Difference\" Diagonal (`r-c = 0 mod 5`): 4 squares `(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)`.\n    *   Attacked by \"Sum\" Diagonal (`r+c = 0 mod 5`): 4 squares `(1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1)`.\n*   Total squares attacked by Q1 = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16.\n*   Number of squares available for Q2 = Total squares - Q1's position - Attacked squares = `25 - 1 - 16 = 8`.\n*   **Number of choices for Q2 = 8.**\n*   *Careful point:* All these 8 squares are equivalent by the board's rotational and reflectional symmetries that fix `(0,0)`. So, we can pick any one of them for our analysis without loss of generality. Let's place Q2 at `(1,2)`.\n\n**C. Placing the 3rd Queen (Q3)**\n*   Now we have Q1 at `(0,0)` and Q2 at `(1,2)`. We need to find the number of squares available for Q3. An available square must not be attacked by Q1 or Q2.\n*   Total squares occupied or attacked by Q1 and Q2 = `|{Q1,Q2}| + |Attacked_by_Q1 U Attacked_by_Q2|`.\n*   `|A1 U A2| = |A1| + |A2| - |A1 âˆ© A2|`, where `A1` and `A2` are the sets of squares attacked by Q1 and Q2, respectively.\n*   `|A1| = 16`, `|A2| = 16`.\n*   We must find the number of squares attacked by both. A careful analysis shows there are 12 such squares: `(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,4)`. (This step requires careful checking of all attack lines from Q1 and Q2).\n*   Number of attacked squares = `16 + 16 - 12 = 20`.\n*   Total squares removed from play = 2 (for Q1,Q2) + 20 (attacked) = 22.\n*   Number of squares available for Q3 = `25 - 22 = 3`.\n*   **Number of choices for Q3 = 3.**\n*   *Careful point:* Let's identify these 3 squares. They are `(2,4)`, `(3,1)`, and `(4,3)`.\n\n**D. Placing the 4th Queen (Q4)**\n*   We have now placed Q1, Q2, and Q3. The number of choices for Q4 depends on the placement of Q3. Since there are only 3 possibilities for Q3, we can check them all.\n    *   **Case 1:** Q3 is at `(2,4)`. The triplet is `{(0,0), (1,2), (2,4)}`. We must find available squares for Q4. A square `(r,c)` is available if `r` is not in `{0,1,2}`, `c` is not in `{0,2,4}`, and the diagonal conditions are met. We check the remaining squares and find that 2 squares are available: `(3,1)` and `(4,3)`.\n    *   **Case 2:** Q3 is at `(3,1)`. The triplet is `{(0,0), (1,2), (3,1)}`. Checking the remaining squares, we again find 2 available: `(2,4)` and `(4,3)`.\n    *   **Case 3:** Q3 is at `(4,3)`. The triplet is `{(0,0), (1,2), (4,3)}`. We again find 2 available squares: `(2,4)` and `(3,1)`.\n*   In every case, after placing 3 non-attacking queens according to our chain of choices, there are exactly 2 valid positions for the 4th queen.\n*   **Number of choices for Q4 = 2.**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Number of ordered placements:** We multiply the number of choices at each step.\n    Number of ordered tuples = (Choices for Q1) * (Choices for Q2) * (Choices for Q3) * (Choices for Q4)\n    Number of ordered tuples = `25 * 8 * 3 * 2 = 1200`.\n\n2.  **Number of unordered sets:** Since the 4 queens are identical, the order in which we placed them does not matter. We must divide the number of ordered placements by the number of ways to order 4 items, which is `4!`.\n    `4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24`.\n    Number of ways = `1200 / 24 = 50`.\n\nThe total number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is 50.\n\n<<<50>>>"
