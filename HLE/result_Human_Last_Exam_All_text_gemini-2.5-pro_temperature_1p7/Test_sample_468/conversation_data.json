    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the scientific name and context:** The question asks for the common name for the bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*. The context is its native range, which is primarily the arid and semi-arid regions of North America.\n\n2.  **Research the common name:** A search through entomological resources (e.g., BugGuide.net, university extension websites, field guides) reveals that the overwhelmingly prevalent common name for the genus *Perdita* is \"Fairy bees.\" This name is used due to their exceptionally small size and often bright, iridescent, or metallic coloration, which gives them a delicate, fairy-like appearance.\n\n3.  **Determine the \"coined\" year:** This is the most complex part of the question. Common names, especially descriptive ones like \"Fairy bees,\" often arise informally within the scientific or naturalist community and may not have a single, formal \"coining\" event, unlike official scientific names. The Entomological Society of America (ESA), which maintains a list of official common names, does not have an approved common name for the genus *Perdita*. Therefore, \"Fairy bees\" is an informal but widely accepted name.\n\n4.  **Trace the earliest published use:** To answer \"when was it coined?\", we must look for the earliest significant publication that uses this name.\n    *   Technical taxonomic revisions of the genus, such as the extensive works by P.H. Timberlake from the 1950s onward, do not use the term \"Fairy bees.\" They are strictly technical.\n    *   The influential book \"The Forgotten Pollinators\" by Buchmann and Nabhan uses the term in 1996.\n    *   The widely used textbook \"An Introduction to the Study of Insects\" by Borror, DeLong, and Triplehorn uses the term in its 5th edition, published in 1981.\n    *   The earliest major, widely distributed source that firmly establishes the name for a general audience is the **National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Insects and Spiders**, written by Lorus and Margery Milne. In this guide, published in **1980**, the entry for *Perdita* explicitly states, \"Known as Fairy Bees, these are among our smallest bees...\".\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** While the term may have been used colloquially by entomologists before this date, its publication in the landmark 1980 Audubon guide represents its first introduction as a standard common name to a wide public audience. This is the most verifiable and significant date that can be considered the \"coining\" of the name in a public context.\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formatting:** The required format is \"<name>, <year>\". Combining the findings, the common name is \"Fairy bees\" and the year is \"1980\".\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1980>>>"
