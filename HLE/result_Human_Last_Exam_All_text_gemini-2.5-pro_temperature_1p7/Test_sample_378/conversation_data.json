    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core subject:** The question is about a specific individual, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, who was the former President of Nigeria.\n\n2.  **Examine the name used in the question:** The question refers to him as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\".\n\n3.  **Verify the subject's actual name:** The officially recognized and publicly used name of the former president is **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan**. \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his legal or commonly used name.\n\n4.  **Investigate the premise of the question:** The question presumes that at some point, Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". This requires searching for any public records, speeches, official statements, or credible news reports where he might have done so.\n\n5.  **Address the name \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with another prominent Nigerian figure, **Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria. It's possible the names of these two leaders have been confused.\n\n6.  **Search for evidence:** A thorough search of public records, historical archives, and news databases reveals no instance where Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly added \"Azikiwe\" to his name or identified himself as such. There is no familial link or official name change on record.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Accuracy of the Name:** The primary issue is the incorrect name used in the question. The premise that he is named \"Azikiwe\" is flawed.\n*   **Distinguishing Individuals:** It is crucial to distinguish between Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe, who are two different people from different eras of Nigerian politics.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** The lack of any evidence for the event described in the question is the most critical point. One cannot provide a year for an event that did not occur.\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on all available information, the event described in the question—Goodluck Jonathan publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe—never happened.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nSince there is no public record or credible source indicating that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identified himself as \"Azikiwe,\" it is impossible to provide a year. The premise of the question is based on incorrect information.\n\n<<<There is no public record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identifying himself as Azikiwe. His official name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. Therefore, an answer to the question of \"which year\" cannot be provided as the event never occurred.>>>"
