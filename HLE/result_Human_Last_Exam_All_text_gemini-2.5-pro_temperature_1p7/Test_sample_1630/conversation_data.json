    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the problem algebraically.**\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3. Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the maximum number of fixed points of $h(x)$. A fixed point is a real number $x$ such that $h(x) = x$.\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum number of real roots of the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the equation.**\nSince $f$ and $g$ are both degree 3 polynomials, their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $\\deg(f) \\times \\deg(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nTherefore, the equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x)) - x = 0$, is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots. Thus, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is at most 9.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conditions on the derivatives.**\nWe are given that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$.\nLet $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$. Then $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$.\nFor this quadratic to be always positive, the parabola must open upwards ($3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$) and have no real roots (discriminant must be negative). The discriminant is $\\Delta_f = (2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) = 4b^2 - 12ac < 0$, which simplifies to $b^2 < 3ac$.\nSimilarly, if $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, then $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$. For $g'(x) > 0$, we must have $p > 0$ and $q^2 < 3pr$.\n\nThe condition that the derivatives are positive means that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions on the entire real line.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$.**\nThe derivative of $h(x)$ is given by the chain rule: $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\nSince $f'(y) > 0$ for any input $y$, and $g'(x) > 0$, their product must be positive.\nSo, $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This means $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\nA strictly increasing function can intersect the line $y=x$ multiple times. For example, $x^3-x+10=10$ has 3 roots, and $x^3+x$ is strictly increasing. If we want $x^3+x$ to intersect $y=2x$, we solve $x^3+x=2x$, which is $x^3-x=0$, giving 3 roots. So, the monotonicity itself doesn't limit the number of fixed points beyond what the degree implies.\n\n**Step 5: Argue for the attainability of the upper bound of 9.**\nTo have 9 distinct real roots for the degree 9 polynomial $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$, the graph of $y=k(x)$ must \"wiggle\" enough to cross the x-axis 9 times.\nBy Rolle's Theorem, if $k(x)$ has 9 real roots, then its derivative $k'(x)$ must have at least 8 real roots.\nLet's analyze $k'(x)$:\n$k'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = h'(x) - 1$.\nThe problem of $k'(x)$ having 8 roots is equivalent to the problem of $h'(x) = 1$ having 8 roots.\n\nLet's find the degree of $h'(x)$.\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$\n$f'(y) = 3ay^2 + 2by + c$ is degree 2.\n$g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$ is degree 3.\n$g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$ is degree 2.\n$f'(g(x))$ is a polynomial in $x$ of degree $2 \\times \\deg(g) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\nSo, $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nAn 8th-degree polynomial can have up to 8 real roots. So it is possible for $k'(x) = h'(x) - 1$ to have 8 real roots.\nIf $k'(x)$ has 8 distinct real roots, then $k(x)$ has 8 local extrema (4 local maxima and 4 local minima).\nLet's say these occur at $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_8$.\nThe polynomial $k(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ has a leading term which is the leading term of $f(g(x))$, which is $a(px^3)^3 = ap^3 x^9$. Since $a>0$ and $p>0$, the leading coefficient $ap^3$ is positive.\nThis means $k(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$ and $k(x) \\to +\\infty$ as $x \\to +\\infty$.\nFor $k(x)=0$ to have 9 real roots, the values of the local extrema must alternate in sign: $k(x_1) > 0$, $k(x_2) < 0$, $k(x_3) > 0$, ..., $k(x_8) < 0$.\n\nCan we find $f$ and $g$ that satisfy this? The polynomials $f$ and $g$ have 4 coefficients each, giving us 8 parameters to tune (e.g., $a,b,c,d,p,q,r,s$). The conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ define an open set in this parameter space. It is plausible that within this set of allowed functions, we can choose parameters to make $h'(x)=1$ have 8 distinct real roots and then adjust the constant term (e.g., $d$ in $f(x)$) to shift the graph of $k(x)$ vertically to ensure the signs of its extrema alternate, thus achieving 9 roots.\n\nThere is no simple theorem that suggests a lower bound. The analysis based on the degree of the second derivative, $k''(x) = h''(x)$, shows that $h''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, which means $k(x)$ has at most $7+2=9$ roots, confirming our bound. It is a known result in this area of mathematics (real algebraic geometry/dynamical systems) that this bound can often be achieved. Therefore, we conclude that 9 is the maximum possible number.\n\nFinal check on the argument:\n1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of real roots of the degree 9 polynomial $f(g(x))-x$.\n2. An upper bound is immediately 9.\n3. There are no obvious constraints that would force the number of roots to be smaller than 9 in the general case (non-symmetric functions). The degrees of the derivatives are high enough to allow for the required number of \"wiggles\".\n4. The existence of 8 free parameters in the definitions of $f$ and $g$ makes it plausible that all the conditions for 9 roots can be met simultaneously.\n\nThus, the maximum number of fixed points is 9."
