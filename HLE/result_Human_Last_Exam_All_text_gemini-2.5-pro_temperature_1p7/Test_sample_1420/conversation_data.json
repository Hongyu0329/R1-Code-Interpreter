    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Theoretical Framework**\nThe problem is set in the context of the renormalization group (RG) theory and asks for a critical exponent using the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion. This method is used to study critical phenomena near a continuous phase transition. The relevant physical model is the Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson (GLW) or $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$)**\nThe upper critical dimension is the spatial dimension at or above which the critical exponents take their classical, mean-field theory values. For the $\\phi^4$ theory, which governs the universality class of systems like the Ising model, the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$. Below this dimension, fluctuations become dominant and alter the values of the exponents.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Expansion Parameter $\\epsilon$**\nThe epsilon expansion is a perturbative calculation performed in the small parameter $\\epsilon$, defined as the deviation from the upper critical dimension:\n$\\epsilon = d_c - d$\nGiven that the system has a spatial dimension $d=3$ and the upper critical dimension is $d_c=4$, the value of epsilon is:\n$\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$\n\n**Step 4: Recall the Formula for the Specific Heat Exponent $\\alpha$**\nThe epsilon expansion provides expressions for the critical exponents as a series in $\\epsilon$. The results depend on the number of components, $n$, of the order parameter.\n*   $n=1$ corresponds to the Ising universality class (e.g., liquid-gas transition, uniaxial magnets).\n*   $n=2$ corresponds to the XY universality class (e.g., superfluid transition in Helium-4).\n*   $n=3$ corresponds to the Heisenberg universality class (e.g., isotropic ferromagnets).\n\nThe general one-loop (first order in $\\epsilon$) result for the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ in the O(n) model is:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)} \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**Step 5: Specify the Universality Class and Calculate $\\alpha$**\nThe question does not specify the universality class. In such cases, it is standard to assume the most fundamental case: the Ising model, which corresponds to an order parameter with a single component ($n=1$).\n\nSubstituting $n=1$ into the formula:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\epsilon = \\frac{3}{18} \\epsilon = \\frac{1}{6} \\epsilon$\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the Value of $\\epsilon$ to get the Final Answer**\nNow, we substitute the value $\\epsilon = 1$ (for $d=3$) into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The $\\epsilon$ expansion is an asymptotic series. For $\\epsilon=1$, higher-order corrections are significant. However, without advanced resummation techniques, simply including the next term can worsen the estimate. The first-order (one-loop) result is the standard \"textbook\" answer derived directly from the expansion.\n*   The exponent $\\alpha$ can be negative for models with $n>4$. A negative $\\alpha$ corresponds to a finite cusp in the specific heat at the critical point, rather than a divergence. For the Ising model ($n=1$), $\\alpha$ is positive, indicating a divergence, which is consistent with known behavior.\n*   The connection between exponents, such as the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - \\nu d$ (where $\\nu$ is the correlation length exponent), is preserved order by order in the $\\epsilon$ expansion.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the scaling exponent for the specific heat is calculated to first order in the epsilon expansion.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
