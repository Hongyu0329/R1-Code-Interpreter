    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of 4 variables, denoted as a(4).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Key Concepts\n\n*   **Boolean Function:** A function with `n` binary inputs (0 or 1) and a single binary output (0 or 1). For `n` variables, there are `2^n` possible input combinations (minterms) and `2^(2^n)` possible functions.\n*   **Minterm:** A product term (AND operation) that includes all `n` variables, either in their complemented or uncomplemented form. Each minterm corresponds to exactly one input combination for which the output is 1.\n*   **Implicant:** A product term that implies the function. If an implicant is true (evaluates to 1), the function's output is also 1. This means the set of minterms covered by the implicant is a subset of the minterms for which the function is 1.\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant that cannot be simplified further by removing a literal. For example, if `AB` is an implicant, but neither `A` nor `B` alone are implicants, then `AB` is a prime implicant. Prime implicants represent the most simplified terms covering a set of the function's minterms.\n*   **a(n):** The maximal number of prime implicants that any Boolean function of `n` variables can have. We are asked to find `a(4)`.\n\n### Step 2: The Strategy for Maximizing Prime Implicants\n\nThe number of prime implicants is maximized when a function has a specific structure on the `n`-dimensional Boolean hypercube. In this hypercube, vertices represent minterms, and edges connect adjacent minterms (those differing by only one bit).\n\nA known construction for generating a large number of prime implicants is to define the function to be true for all minterms in two adjacent \"layers\" of this hypercube.\n\n*   A **layer `k`** of the hypercube consists of all minterms that have a \"weight\" of `k`. The weight of a minterm is the number of '1's in its binary representation. Let's denote the set of minterms of weight `k` as `S(n,k)`.\n*   The size of `S(n,k)` is given by the binomial coefficient `C(n,k)` or \"n choose k\".\n*   We can construct a function `f_k` by selecting all minterms from two adjacent layers, `k` and `k+1`. So, `f_k` is true for all minterms in `S(n,k) U S(n,k+1)`.\n\nFor such a function, it can be shown that the prime implicants are precisely the `(n-1)`-literal terms formed by combining each adjacent pair of minterms, one from `S(n,k)` and one from `S(n,k+1)`. The number of such pairs (and thus the number of PIs) is the number of edges connecting layer `k` and layer `k+1`. This quantity is `(n-k) * C(n,k)`.\n\nOur goal is to find the value of `k` that maximizes this expression for `n=4`.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Strategy to n=4\n\nWe need to calculate the number of prime implicants, `P(k) = (4-k) * C(4,k)`, for all possible values of `k` (from 0 to `n-1=3`).\n\n*   **For k = 0:**\n    *   The function is `f_0 = S(4,0) U S(4,1)`.\n    *   The number of PIs is `P(0) = (4-0) * C(4,0) = 4 * 1 = 4`.\n\n*   **For k = 1:**\n    *   The function is `f_1 = S(4,1) U S(4,2)`.\n    *   The number of PIs is `P(1) = (4-1) * C(4,1) = 3 * 4 = 12`.\n\n*   **For k = 2:**\n    *   The function is `f_2 = S(4,2) U S(4,3)`.\n    *   The number of PIs is `P(2) = (4-2) * C(4,2) = 2 * 6 = 12`.\n\n*   **For k = 3:**\n    *   The function is `f_3 = S(4,3) U S(4,4)`.\n    *   The number of PIs is `P(3) = (4-3) * C(4,3) = 1 * 4 = 4`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBy evaluating all possible layer pairs, we find that the maximum number of prime implicants is 12. This maximum is achieved by two different functions:\n1.  `f_1`, which is true for all minterms of weight 1 and 2.\n2.  `f_2`, which is true for all minterms of weight 2 and 3.\n\nOther types of functions, such as the \"checkerboard\" function (true for all minterms of odd weight), yield fewer prime implicants. For n=4, the checkerboard function `f = S(4,1) U S(4,3)` results in `C(4,1) + C(4,3) = 4 + 4 = 8` prime implicants, which is less than 12.\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables, a(4), is 12."
