    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the sequence and the goal**\nThe given sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( ).\nThe goal is to find the pattern governing the sequence and use it to determine the next number that should be in the parentheses.\n\n**Step 2: Check for simple patterns**\nFirst, we look for simple arithmetic or geometric progressions.\n*   **Arithmetic Progression (Common Difference):** We calculate the differences between consecutive terms.\n    *   11 - 2 = 9\n    *   23 - 11 = 12\n    *   51 - 23 = 28\n    *   119 - 51 = 68\n    The differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. Since the differences are not constant, it is not a simple arithmetic sequence.\n*   **Geometric Progression (Common Ratio):**\n    *   11 / 2 = 5.5\n    *   23 / 11 â‰ˆ 2.09\n    The ratios are not constant, so it's not a simple geometric sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the sequence of differences**\nSince the first-level differences did not reveal a simple pattern, let's analyze this new sequence of differences: 9, 12, 28, 68. Let's call this sequence \"D\".\n*   `D_1 = 9`\n*   `D_2 = 12`\n*   `D_3 = 28`\n*   `D_4 = 68`\n\n**Step 4: Find the pattern within the difference sequence (D)**\nLet's look for a recursive relationship within sequence D. We can test if a term can be derived from the previous one using multiplication and addition.\n*   Let's relate `D_3` (28) to `D_2` (12):\n    *   `28 = 2 * 12 + 4`\n*   Let's test if the same pattern holds for `D_4` (68) and `D_3` (28):\n    *   `68 = 2 * 28 + 12`\nThis reveals a consistent pattern: `D_n = 2 * D_(n-1) + C_n`, where `C_n` is a new sequence of numbers.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the pattern of the new constant sequence (C)**\nFrom the previous step, we found the constants:\n*   For `D_3`, the constant was 4.\n*   For `D_4`, the constant was 12.\nThe sequence of constants (C) is 4, 12, ...\nThe most straightforward pattern for this short sequence is a geometric progression where each term is 3 times the previous term (`12 = 4 * 3`).\n*   **Careful Point:** We assume this pattern continues. This is a common requirement in such puzzles.\n\n**Step 6: Predict the next terms based on the discovered patterns**\n1.  **Find the next term in sequence C:** Following the pattern `C_(n+1) = C_n * 3`, the next term after 12 is `12 * 3 = 36`.\n2.  **Find the next term in the difference sequence D:** We use the formula `D_n = 2 * D_(n-1) + C_n` to find `D_5`.\n    *   `D_5 = 2 * D_4 + 36`\n    *   `D_5 = 2 * 68 + 36`\n    *   `D_5 = 136 + 36 = 172`.\n3.  **Find the missing term in the original sequence:** The missing term is the previous term (119) plus the next difference (`D_5`).\n    *   Missing Number = 119 + `D_5`\n    *   Missing Number = 119 + 172 = 291.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\nThe next number in the sequence is 291. This matches option A.\n\n<<<A>>>"
