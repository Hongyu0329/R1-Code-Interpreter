    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question requires us to find a specific film that meets three criteria:\n1.  It must have won the Academy Award for **Best Picture**.\n2.  It must be the **first** winner to meet the visual requirement. This means we must analyze the winners chronologically.\n3.  It must **depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the \"Luxor Obelisks\"\nThere are two famous obelisks originally from the Luxor Temple in Egypt. The question is not specific as to which one. Therefore, a depiction of either obelisk would qualify.\n*   **Obelisk 1:** Still standing at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n*   **Obelisk 2:** Located in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France, where it was erected in 1836.\n\n### Step 3: Chronological Search Strategy\nThe most logical approach is to go through the list of Best Picture winners, starting from the first award (for 1927/1928), and look for films with settings in either Paris or Luxor.\n\n### Step 4: Analysis of Best Picture Winners\n*   **1920s and 1930s:**\n    *   ***Wings*** (1927/1928): Set partially in France during WWI, but scenes are focused on aerial combat and specific city locations like the Folies Bergère, not broad landmark vistas like the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   ***The Life of Emile Zola*** (1937): This film is set in Paris. However, its scenes focus on courtrooms, apartments, and the École Militaire. It does not contain a depiction of the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   Other winners from this era (*The Broadway Melody*, *All Quiet on the Western Front*, *It Happened One Night*, *Gone with the Wind*) are set in locations like the US, Germany, and the American South, and do not feature either obelisk.\n\n*   **1940s:**\n    *   The winners of this decade (*Rebecca*, *How Green Was My Valley*, *Casablanca*, *Hamlet*) are set in England, Wales, Morocco, and Denmark, none of which feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n*   **1950s:**\n    *   ***An American in Paris*** **(Winner for 1951):** The title itself points to the correct location. This film is a musical romance set in Paris. The film's climax is a lavish 17-minute ballet sequence. During this sequence, the main character dreams his way through settings inspired by famous French painters. One of these segments is based on the work of Raoul Dufy and is explicitly set in a stylized **Place de la Concorde**, with the **Luxor Obelisk** and its surrounding fountains clearly and prominently depicted. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n*   **Checking subsequent winners to confirm it is the first:**\n    *   ***Around the World in 80 Days*** (1956): While the film's journey includes stops in Paris and Egypt, a review of its scenes confirms it does not show the Place de la Concorde in Paris or the Temple in Luxor.\n    *   ***Gigi*** (1958): This film is also set in Paris and does show the Place de la Concorde obelisk. However, it won seven years after *An American in Paris*.\n    *   ***Ben-Hur*** (1959): The famous chariot race features an obelisk in the center of the track (the spina), but this is a representation of an obelisk in a Roman circus, not specifically one of the two \"Luxor Obelisks\" from the Luxor Temple.\n    *   ***Lawrence of Arabia*** (1962): Features scenes in Cairo, Egypt, but does not depict Luxor or its temple.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nAfter a chronological review, no Best Picture winner prior to 1951 features a Luxor Obelisk. *An American in Paris* is the first film to win the award that contains a clear depiction of one—the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde, shown during the climactic ballet sequence.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
