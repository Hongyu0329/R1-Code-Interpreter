    "This problem asks us to identify all finite nilpotent groups that are also \"filled\" groups. To solve this, we must carefully define and analyze the terms involved.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n1.  **Finite Group (G)**: A set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverse elements for all elements, containing a finite number of elements.\n2.  **Product-Free Set (S)**: A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (where `x` and `y` can be the same), their product `xy` is not in `S`. Symbolically, this is written as `S² ∩ S = ∅`, where `S² = {xy | x, y ∈ S}`.\n3.  **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MIPFS)**: A product-free set `S` is a MIPFS if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. In other words, if `T` is a product-free set and `S ⊆ T`, then it must be that `S = T`. This is equivalent to saying that for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n4.  **Filled Group**: A finite group `G` is called a filled group if the union of all its MIPFSs is equal to the group `G` itself. That is, if `M` is the collection of all MIPFSs of `G`, then `G` is filled if `∪_{S∈M} S = G`.\n5.  **Finite Nilpotent Group**: A finite group `G` is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. Examples include all finite abelian groups and all finite p-groups.\n\n### Step 2: Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **The Identity Element (`e`)**: The role of the identity element `e` is critical. We must determine if `e` can be part of a product-free set.\n2.  **Existence of MIPFS**: For any non-identity element of a finite group, does it belong to at least one MIPFS?\n3.  **Interpretation of \"Fills G\"**: The phrase \"fills G\" must be interpreted. The standard interpretation is that the union of the sets equals `G`.\n4.  **The Trivial Group**: The group `G = {e}` is a special case that should be handled separately.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the properties of filled groups based on these definitions.\n\n**Part A: The Status of the Identity Element `e`**\n\nLet `G` be any non-trivial finite group and `e` be its identity element. Let `S` be any product-free set in `G`.\nCan `e` be an element of `S`?\nAssume `e ∈ S`. According to the definition of a product-free set, for any `x, y ∈ S`, the product `xy` must not be in `S`.\nLet's choose `x = e` and `y = e`. Both are in `S` by our assumption.\nThen their product is `xy = e ⋅ e = e`.\nThe definition requires `e ∉ S`. But we assumed `e ∈ S`. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the assumption that `e ∈ S` must be false.\n**Conclusion**: The identity element `e` cannot be a member of any product-free set in a non-trivial group `G`.\n\n**Part B: Consequence for Filled Groups**\n\nA MIPFS is, by definition, a product-free set. From Part A, we know that `e` cannot be in any product-free set. Consequently, `e` cannot be in any MIPFS of a non-trivial group `G`.\n\nLet `M` be the collection of all MIPFSs of `G`. The union of all these sets is `U = ∪_{S∈M} S`.\nSince no set `S` in the union contains `e`, the union `U` also cannot contain `e`. So, `e ∉ U`.\nThis means `U` is a subset of `G \\ {e}`.\n\nFor `G` to be a filled group, the condition `U = G` must be satisfied.\nHowever, for any non-trivial group, `e ∈ G`. We have shown `e ∉ U`.\nSo, `U` is always a proper subset of `G`, meaning `U ≠ G`.\n**Conclusion**: No non-trivial finite group can be a filled group.\n\n**Part C: Analyzing the Trivial Group**\n\nWhat about the trivial group `G = {e}`?\nThe subsets of `G` are `∅` and `{e}`.\n1.  Is `S = {e}` a product-free set? No, because `e ⋅ e = e`, which is in `S`. So `{e}` is not product-free.\n2.  Is `S = ∅` a product-free set? Yes. The condition `xy ∉ ∅` for all `x, y ∈ ∅` is vacuously true since there are no elements in `∅`.\n\nSo, the only product-free set in `G = {e}` is the empty set, `∅`.\nIs `∅` a MIPFS? A product-free set is maximal if adding any other element makes it not product-free.\nThe only element in `G \\ ∅` is `e`. Let's add it: `∅ ∪ {e} = {e}`.\nAs we saw, `{e}` is not product-free.\nThus, `∅` is indeed a MIPFS. In fact, it is the *only* MIPFS in the trivial group.\n\nNow, we check if the trivial group is filled. The union of all MIPFSs must be `G`.\nHere, the union of all MIPFSs is just `∅`.\nThe condition is `∅ = G = {e}`, which is false.\n**Conclusion**: The trivial group `G = {e}` is not a filled group.\n\n**Part D: Final Conclusion**\n\nFrom Parts B and C, we have shown that neither the trivial group nor any non-trivial finite group can be a filled group. Therefore, there are no finite filled groups at all.\n\nThe question asks for the finite filled **nilpotent** groups. Since the set of all finite filled groups is empty, the set of finite filled nilpotent groups must also be the empty set.\n\n<<<There are no finite filled nilpotent groups."
