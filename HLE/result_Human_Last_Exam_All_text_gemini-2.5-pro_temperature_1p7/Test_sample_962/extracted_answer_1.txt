A tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol can be designed using the BLS signature scheme as its foundation.

**Phase 1: Setup via Distributed Key Generation (DKG)**
A DKG protocol, such as Pedersen's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS), is run by the *n* parties to establish a shared secret without a trusted third party. The process generates a master secret key $x$ (as the constant term of a secret polynomial $f(z)$ of degree $t-1$) and a corresponding public key $Y=g_1^x$. Each party $P_i$ receives a secret share $x_i = f(i)$ and a public verification key $Y_i = g_1^{x_i}$.

**Phase 2: Two-Round Signing Protocol**
Given a message *m* to be signed by a set *S* of *t* parties:

*   **Round 1 (Commitment):** Each party $P_i \in S$ broadcasts a commitment to its participation, binding its identity, the message, and the set of signers (e.g., $C_i = H(\text{id}_i, m, S)$). All participants wait to receive commitments from all others in *S*. This round ensures synchronized agreement on the signing context before proceeding.

*   **Round 2 (Signing and Aggregation):**
    1.  After receiving all commitments, each party $P_i$ computes its deterministic partial signature $\sigma_i = H(m)^{x_i}$.
    2.  Each party broadcasts its partial signature $\sigma_i$.
    3.  An aggregator (which can be any party) collects *t* partial signatures. It first verifies each $\sigma_j$ using the corresponding public share $Y_j$.
    4.  The aggregator then computes Lagrange coefficients $\lambda_j$ for the set *S* and combines the verified partial signatures into the final signature: $\sigma = \prod_{j \in S} (\sigma_j)^{\lambda_j}$.

This final $\sigma$ is a standard BLS signature, verifiable with the single group public key $Y$.

**Security Justification:**
The security of this scheme has a **tight reduction** to the co-Computational Diffie-Hellman (co-CDH) problem in the random oracle model. The tightness is achieved because the partial signatures are deterministic, which allows the security proof to proceed without the "guessing" of random nonces that plagues many other schemes and weakens their security guarantees. The two-round structure provides robustness against concurrent attacks.
