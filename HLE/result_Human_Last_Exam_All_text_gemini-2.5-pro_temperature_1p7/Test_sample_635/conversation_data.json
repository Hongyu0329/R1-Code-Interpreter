    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to calculate the left coprime factorization of the given transfer function.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$ in the form $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$. This means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that:\n1.  $D(s)$ is non-singular (i.e., its determinant is not the zero polynomial).\n2.  The equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$ holds.\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. Two polynomial matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime if the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$. A sufficient condition for coprimeness is that the factorization is \"minimal,\" which means the determinant of $D(s)$ is, up to a non-zero constant, equal to the characteristic polynomial (pole polynomial) of the system $H(s)$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Characteristic Polynomial of H(s)**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of $H(s)$ is the least common multiple of the denominators of all minors of $H(s)$.\nThe given transfer function is:\n\\[ H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n*   **Minors of order 1:** These are the individual entries: $\\frac{s-1}{s+1}, 1, \\frac{2}{s^2-1}, 0$. The denominators are $(s+1)$ and $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$.\n*   **Minor of order 2:** This is the determinant of $H(s)$:\n    \\[ \\det(H(s)) = \\left(\\frac{s-1}{s+1}\\right)(0) - (1)\\left(\\frac{2}{s^2-1}\\right) = -\\frac{2}{s^2-1} \\]\n    The denominator is $s^2-1$.\nThe least common multiple of all denominators is $s^2-1$. So, the characteristic polynomial is $p(s) = s^2-1$. For a minimal (and thus coprime) factorization, we should seek a $D(s)$ such that $\\det(D(s)) = c \\cdot (s^2-1)$ for some non-zero constant $c$. We will aim for $c=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct D(s) and N(s) row by row**\n\nWe use the equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$, which can be written as:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Constructing the first row:**\nThe first row of the product is given by:\n*   $n_{11}(s) = d_{11}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1}$\n*   $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) \\cdot 1 + d_{12}(s) \\cdot 0 = d_{11}(s)$\n\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, $n_{11}(s)$ and $n_{12}(s)$ must be polynomials.\nFrom the second equation, $d_{11}(s)$ must be a polynomial. To make $n_{11}(s)$ a polynomial, we need to choose $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{12}(s)$ to cancel the denominators. A simple choice that clears the denominator in the $(1,1)$ entry of $H(s)$ is to set $d_{12}(s)=0$ and $d_{11}(s)=s+1$.\nWith this choice:\n*   $d_{11}(s) = s+1$\n*   $d_{12}(s) = 0$\nThe corresponding entries in $N(s)$ are:\n*   $n_{12}(s) = s+1$\n*   $n_{11}(s) = (s+1) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + 0 = s-1$\nSo, the first row of $D(s)$ is $[s+1 \\quad 0]$ and the first row of $N(s)$ is $[s-1 \\quad s+1]$.\n\n**Constructing the second row:**\nThe second row of the product is given by:\n*   $n_{21}(s) = d_{21}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1}$\n*   $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) \\cdot 1 + d_{22}(s) \\cdot 0 = d_{21}(s)$\n\nAgain, $d_{21}(s)$ must be a polynomial. To make $n_{21}(s)$ a polynomial, the term $\\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. This requires the numerator, $d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$, to be divisible by $s^2-1=(s-1)(s+1)$.\n\nNow we assemble the full $D(s)$ matrix and use the determinant condition from Step 2.\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe determinant is $\\det(D(s)) = (s+1)d_{22}(s)$. We require $\\det(D(s)) = s^2-1 = (s+1)(s-1)$.\nTherefore, we must have $d_{22}(s) = s-1$.\n\nNow we find $d_{21}(s)$. We know the numerator $d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$ must be divisible by $s^2-1$. Substituting $d_{22}(s) = s-1$, the numerator becomes:\n$d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2(s-1) = (s-1) \\left[ d_{21}(s)(s-1) + 2 \\right]$\nSince this must be divisible by $(s-1)(s+1)$, the term in the brackets, $\\left[ d_{21}(s)(s-1) + 2 \\right]$, must be divisible by $(s+1)$. This implies that it must be zero when we substitute $s=-1$:\n$d_{21}(-1)(-1-1) + 2 = 0 \\implies -2d_{21}(-1) + 2 = 0 \\implies d_{21}(-1) = 1$.\nThe simplest polynomial satisfying $d_{21}(-1)=1$ is the constant polynomial $d_{21}(s) = 1$.\n\nSo, the second row of $D(s)$ is $[1 \\quad s-1]$.\n\n**Step 4: Finalize D(s) and N(s)**\nWe have found:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nNow we calculate the second row of $N(s)$ using $d_{21}(s)=1$ and $d_{22}(s)=s-1$.\n*   $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) = 1$\n*   $n_{21}(s) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1) \\frac{2}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2}{s+1} = \\frac{s+1}{s+1} = 1$\nThe second row of $N(s)$ is $[1 \\quad 1]$.\n\nSo, the final factorization is:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\quad \\text{and} \\quad\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 5: Verification**\n*   **Polynomial Matrices:** $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are clearly polynomial matrices.\n*   **Non-singular D(s):** $\\det(D(s)) = (s+1)(s-1) - 0 = s^2-1$, which is not zero.\n*   **Coprimeness:** Since $\\det(D(s)) = s^2-1$ is the characteristic polynomial of $H(s)$, the factorization is minimal and therefore left coprime.\n*   **Check $D^{-1}N = H$:**\n    \\[ D^{-1}(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2-1}\\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    \\[ D^{-1}(s)N(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2-1}\\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{s^2-1}\\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)^2 & (s-1)(s+1) \\\\ -(s-1)+(s+1) & -(s+1)+(s+1) \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    \\[ = \\frac{1}{s^2-1}\\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)^2 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = H(s) \\]\nThe factorization is correct.\n\n<<<\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n>>>"
