    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecule\nFirst, we need to determine the chemical formula and the number of each type of atom in the molecule.\n*   **Molecule:** Toluene\n*   **Structure:** A benzene ring (C6H5) attached to a methyl group (CH3).\n*   **Chemical Formula:** C7H8\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   7 Carbon (C) atoms\n    *   8 Hydrogen (H) atoms\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Basis Set Notation (6-31G)\nThe notation \"6-31G\" is a Pople-style basis set. It describes how atomic orbitals are represented by a set of mathematical functions called contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs), which are themselves linear combinations of primitive Gaussian functions (pGTOs). The question asks for the number of CGFs, which are also commonly referred to as basis functions.\n\nLet's break down the notation `k-nmG`:\n*   **`k` (before the hyphen):** This describes the core atomic orbitals. It means the core orbitals are represented by a single CGF, which is a contraction of `k` pGTOs.\n*   **`nm` (after the hyphen):** This describes the valence atomic orbitals. This is a \"split-valence\" basis set, meaning each valence orbital is represented by two CGFs (in this case, since there are two numbers, 'n' and 'm').\n    *   The first CGF (the \"inner\" part of the valence shell) is a contraction of `n` pGTOs.\n    *   The second CGF (the \"outer\" part of the valence shell) is a contraction of `m` pGTOs.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of CGFs for each Atom Type\n\n**For a Carbon (C) atom (a second-row element):**\n*   **Core orbital (1s):** The `6-` indicates that the 1s core orbital is represented by **1 CGF** (contracted from 6 pGTOs).\n*   **Valence orbitals (2s and 2p):** The `-31G` describes these orbitals. Each valence orbital is split into two basis functions.\n    *   **Inner Valence (`3`):**\n        *   One 2s CGF (from 3 pGTOs)\n        *   Three 2p CGFs (one each for 2px, 2py, 2pz), each from 3 pGTOs.\n        *   Total for inner valence = 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer Valence (`1`):**\n        *   One 2s CGF (from 1 pGTO)\n        *   Three 2p CGFs (one each for 2px, 2py, 2pz), each from 1 pGTO.\n        *   Total for outer valence = 1 (s) + 3 (p) = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total CGFs per Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 CGFs.**\n\n**For a Hydrogen (H) atom (a first-row element):**\n*   **Core orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons. The entire notation applies to its valence 1s orbital.\n*   **Valence orbital (1s):** The `-31G` part splits the 1s orbital into two basis functions.\n    *   **Inner Valence (`3`):** One 1s CGF (contracted from 3 pGTOs) = **1 CGF**.\n    *   **Outer Valence (`1`):** One 1s CGF (from 1 pGTO) = **1 CGF**.\n*   **Total CGFs per Hydrogen atom = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = 2 CGFs.**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of CGFs for Toluene (C7H8)\n\nNow we multiply the number of CGFs per atom by the number of atoms of that type in the molecule and sum the results.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:**\n    *   7 Carbon atoms × 9 CGFs/Carbon atom = 63 CGFs\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:**\n    *   8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 CGFs/Hydrogen atom = 16 CGFs\n*   **Total Number of Contracted Gaussian Functions:**\n    *   Total CGFs = 63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = 79\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n1.  **CGF vs. pGTO:** The question asks for \"contracted Gaussian functions\" (CGFs), not \"primitive Gaussian functions\" (pGTOs). A CGF is a single basis function, which may be composed of one or more pGTOs.\n2.  **Atom-Specific Interpretation:** The basis set notation is interpreted differently for first-row atoms (H, He) and second-row atoms (Li-Ne). For H, the whole `31G` part describes the 1s orbital. For C, the `6-` describes the 1s core, and `-31G` describes the 2s and 2p valence orbitals.\n3.  **Counting Valence Orbitals:** For second-row atoms, the split-valence description applies to *all* valence orbitals. This means the 2s orbital is split, and the set of three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz) is also split.\n4.  **Molecular Formula:** Ensure the atom count for the molecule (C7H8 for toluene) is correct.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the final answer is 79.\n\n<<<79>>>"
