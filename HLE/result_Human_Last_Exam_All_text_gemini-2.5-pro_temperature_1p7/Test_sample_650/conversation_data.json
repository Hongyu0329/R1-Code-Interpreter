    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's computational time complexity.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Algorithm's Goal**\nThe algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and a base `c` (`c ≥ 2`) and computes the representation of `n` in base `c`. This is the standard method of repeatedly taking the number modulo the base to find the next digit, and then dividing the number by the base for the next iteration.\n\n**2. Analyze the Cost of Each Step**\nWe analyze the complexity assuming a standard Random Access Machine (RAM) model of computation, where basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and assignments are considered to take constant time, denoted as O(1).\n\n*   **Step 1: Initialization**\n    *   `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n    *   This line consists of four operations: two assignments, one floor division, one multiplication, and one subtraction.\n    *   Under the RAM model, this sequence of operations takes a constant amount of time.\n    *   **Cost of Step 1: O(1)**\n\n*   **Step 2: The `while` loop**\n    *   This is the main part of the algorithm. To find its cost, we need to determine two things: the number of times the loop executes and the cost of each execution (iteration).\n    *   **Cost of a single iteration (Step 2.1):**\n        *   `i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc$`\n        *   This block of code is similar to the initialization step. It contains a few assignments and arithmetic operations.\n        *   Each operation takes O(1) time.\n        *   **Cost per iteration: O(1)**\n    *   **Number of iterations:**\n        *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Let's track how the value of `q` changes.\n        *   Before the loop: `q_0 = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n        *   After 1st iteration: `x` becomes `q_0`, so `q_1 = ⌊q_0/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c^2⌋`.\n        *   After 2nd iteration: `x` becomes `q_1`, so `q_2 = ⌊q_1/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c^2⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c^3⌋`.\n        *   After `k` iterations, the value of `q` will be `q_k = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n        *   The loop terminates when `q ≤ 0`. Since `n ≥ 0` and `c ≥ 2`, this happens when `q = 0`.\n        *   We need to find the number of iterations, `k`, for which `q_k` becomes 0.\n        *   The condition `q_k = ⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0` is true if `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, which is equivalent to `n < c^(k+1)`.\n        *   Taking the logarithm base `c` on both sides gives `log_c(n) < k+1`.\n        *   The loop runs as long as the condition from the *previous* step, `q_{k-1} > 0`, holds. `q_{k-1} = ⌊n/c^k⌋ > 0` implies `n/c^k ≥ 1`, so `log_c(n) ≥ k`.\n        *   Combining these, we have `k ≤ log_c(n) < k+1`. By definition of the floor function, this means the number of iterations `k` is exactly `⌊log_c(n)⌋` (for n ≥ c).\n        *   Therefore, the number of iterations is `O(log_c n)`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Return**\n    *   `return ((a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1}  a_{0}))`\n    *   This step involves returning the computed sequence of digits. The number of digits is `i+1`, which is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. The time taken is proportional to the number of digits.\n    *   **Cost of Step 3: O(log_c n)**\n\n**3. Combine Costs to Find Overall Complexity**\nThe total time complexity is the sum of the costs of all parts:\nTotal Time = Cost(Step 1) + Cost(Step 2) + Cost(Step 3)\nTotal Time = O(1) + (Number of iterations × Cost per iteration) + O(log_c n)\nTotal Time = O(1) + (O(log_c n) × O(1)) + O(log_c n)\nTotal Time = O(1) + O(log_c n) + O(log_c n)\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `O(log_c n)`.\n\n**4. List of Careful Points**\n*   **Model of Computation:** The analysis hinges on the assumption that basic arithmetic operations take constant time (O(1)). This is standard in introductory algorithm analysis but ignores that for very large numbers, these operations take time proportional to the number of bits in the operands.\n*   **Input Variables:** The complexity depends on both `n` and `c`. The notation `O(log_c n)` correctly shows this dependency. The algorithm runs faster for larger bases `c`.\n*   **Logarithm Base:** In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm is often omitted (e.g., writing `O(log n)`) because `log_c n = log_2 n / log_2 c`, and for a constant `c`, `log_2 c` is just a constant factor. However, since `c` is an input variable, `O(log_c n)` is a more precise representation.\n*   **Dominant Operation:** The `while` loop is the performance-critical part of the algorithm. The number of times it executes dictates the overall complexity.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the computational time complexity of the algorithm is proportional to the number of digits in the base-`c` representation of `n`. This number is `O(log_c n)`.\n\n<<<O(log_c n)>>>"
