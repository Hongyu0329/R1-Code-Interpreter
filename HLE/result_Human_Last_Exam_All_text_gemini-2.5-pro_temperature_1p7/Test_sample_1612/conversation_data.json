    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question and Define the \"Triple Crown\"**\n\nThe user is asking for the total number of individual players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n\nThe batting Triple Crown is one of the most prestigious and rare achievements in baseball. To win it, a player must lead their respective league (American League or National League) in three key offensive statistics in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (AVG)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n**Careful Point:** The question asks for the number of \"winners\" (i.e., unique players), not the total number of times the Triple Crown has been won. Some players have accomplished the feat more than once.\n\n**Step 2: List All Instances of a Triple Crown Win in MLB History**\n\nTo find the number of unique winners, we must first compile a complete list of every time the Triple Crown has been won. This list includes the player, year, and league. The RBI statistic was not officially tracked until 1920, but has been retroactively calculated for prior seasons. This list is generally accepted as definitive.\n\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878, National League)\n2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887, American Association*)\n3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894, National League)\n4.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901, American League)\n5.  **Ty Cobb** (1909, American League)\n6.  **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912, National League)\n7.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, National League)\n8.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1925, National League) - *Second time for this player*\n9.  **Chuck Klein** (1933, National League)\n10. **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, American League)\n11. **Lou Gehrig** (1934, American League)\n12. **Joe Medwick** (1937, National League)\n13. **Ted Williams** (1942, American League)\n14. **Ted Williams** (1947, American League) - *Second time for this player*\n15. **Mickey Mantle** (1956, American League)\n16. **Frank Robinson** (1966, American League)\n17. **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, American League)\n18. **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, American League)\n\n*The American Association is considered a historical Major League.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to list all occurrences, even duplicates, to ensure the final count of unique players is accurate. In 1933, two different players won the Triple Crown in their respective leagues.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Number of Unique Winners from the List**\n\nNow, we will go through the list from Step 2 and count each player only once.\n\n1.  Paul Hines\n2.  Tip O'Neill\n3.  Hugh Duffy\n4.  Nap Lajoie\n5.  Ty Cobb\n6.  Heinie Zimmerman\n7.  Rogers Hornsby (won twice)\n8.  Chuck Klein\n9.  Jimmie Foxx\n10. Lou Gehrig\n11. Joe Medwick\n12. Ted Williams (won twice)\n13. Mickey Mantle\n14. Frank Robinson\n15. Carl Yastrzemski\n16. Miguel Cabrera\n\nBy counting each name on this list a single time, we arrive at the total number of individual Triple Crown winners.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer Formulation**\n\nThe comprehensive list shows that the Triple Crown has been won 18 times in MLB history. However, since two players (Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams) each won it twice, the number of unique players to achieve the feat is lower than 18. The final count of unique individuals is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
