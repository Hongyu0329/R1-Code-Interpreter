    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n**Careful Points & General Principles:**\n\n1.  **Coiled-Coil Structure:** Coiled-coils consist of two or more alpha-helices wrapped around each other. Their oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, etc.) is the number of helices in the structure.\n2.  **Heptad Repeat:** The primary sequence of a coiled-coil follows a seven-residue pattern, called a heptad repeat, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`.\n3.  **Hydrophobic Core:** The stability and oligomeric state of a coiled-coil are primarily determined by the amino acids at the core positions, `a` and `d`. These positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues (like L, I, V, A).\n4.  **Electrostatic Interactions:** Positions `e` and `g` are often occupied by charged residues (like E, K) and are located on the outside of the core, where they can form stabilizing salt bridges between helices.\n5.  **Determining the Register:** The first step is to correctly assign the `a-g` positions to the amino acids in the sequence. Given the repeating motifs (e.g., `EIA...K...`), a common and chemically sensible phasing for these designed peptides is `gabcdefg`. This places the frequently observed `E` (Glutamic Acid) and `K` (Lysine) at the solvent-exposed `g` and `e` positions, and the hydrophobic `I` (Isoleucine) at the core `a` position. With this register, the core `a` residue is the 2nd amino acid of the heptad, and the core `d` residue is the 5th.\n6.  **Rules of Oligomerization:** Based on seminal studies (notably by Peter Kim and Tom Alber), specific pairings of amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions strongly favor certain oligomeric states:\n    *   `(a=I, d=L)`: The canonical leucine zipper motif; strongly favors **Dimers**.\n    *   `(a=I, d=I)`: The bulky, beta-branched isoleucine packs well in a three-fold symmetric core; favors **Trimers**.\n    *   Polar residues in the core: Residues like Asn (N), Gln (Q), or Thr (T) in the core can form hydrogen bond networks that stabilize specific higher-order structures. `d=Q` often favors trimers, and `d=T` can favor tetramers.\n    *   `(a=I, d=A)`: The small Alanine residue at `d` creates a cavity if in a dimer; this can be better filled by a **Trimer**.\n    *   `(a=L, d=I)` or `(a=L, d=L)`: These combinations typically favor **Tetramers**.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Sequence:**\n\nWe will use the `gabcdefg` register, meaning the 2nd residue is at position `a` and the 5th is at position `d`.\n\n1.  **Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n    *   Let's analyze the repeating heptad pattern. The variations (Q, K, W) occur at the 4th position of each heptad (`c` position), which is solvent-exposed.\n    *   The 2nd residue is consistently `I` (Isoleucine). The 5th residue is consistently `A` (Alanine).\n    *   Core composition: `a=I`, `d=A`.\n    *   As noted in the principles, this `(Ia, Ad)` core favors **Trimer (3)** formation.\n\n2.  **Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n    *   This sequence appears to have typos (`KENAALK`). Assuming the intended, systematic design is based on the dominant `EIAALKQ` unit.\n    *   In the `EIAALKQ` heptad, the 2nd residue is `I` and the 5th residue is `L` (Leucine).\n    *   Core composition: `a=I`, `d=L`.\n    *   This is the classic leucine zipper motif, which forms a **Dimer (2)**.\n\n3.  **Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n    *   Similar to the above, we assume the intended systematic repeat is `EIAAIKQ`. The variations are at non-core positions.\n    *   In the `EIAAIKQ` heptad, the 2nd residue is `I` and the 5th residue is `I`.\n    *   Core composition: `a=I`, `d=I`.\n    *   This `(Ia, Id)` core is known to promote the formation of **Trimers (3)**.\n\n4.  **Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n    *   The repeating unit is `EIQKQLK` (with one likely `c`-position substitution of W for Q).\n    *   In the `EIQKQLK` heptad, the 2nd residue is `I` and the 5th residue is `Q` (Glutamine).\n    *   Core composition: `a=I`, `d=Q`.\n    *   A polar Gln residue at the `d` position is known to stabilize a **Trimer (3)** through inter-helical hydrogen bonding.\n\n5.  **Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n    *   The repeating pattern gives a consistent core composition across the four heptads.\n    *   The 2nd residue is `I` and the 5th residue is `T` (Threonine).\n    *   Core composition: `a=I`, `d=T`.\n    *   The polar Threonine residues at the `d` positions can form a hydrogen-bonded network in the core that specifically stabilizes a **Tetramer (4)**.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nCompiling the results from the analysis:\n*   Sequence 1: **3** (Trimer)\n*   Sequence 2: **2** (Dimer)\n*   Sequence 3: **3** (Trimer)\n*   Sequence 4: **3** (Trimer)\n*   Sequence 5: **4** (Tetramer)\n\nThe resulting sequence of oligomeric states is **3, 2, 3, 3, 4**. This corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
