To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape in response to sunlight. When the sun rises, the UV light should cause the table to isomerize, changing from a flat, usable shape (representing the stable *trans*-azobenzene) to a bent or folded shape (representing the less stable *cis*-azobenzene). As the sun sets and darkness falls, the table must relax back to its original flat, usable shape (the *trans* form), mimicking the thermal relaxation of the molecule.
