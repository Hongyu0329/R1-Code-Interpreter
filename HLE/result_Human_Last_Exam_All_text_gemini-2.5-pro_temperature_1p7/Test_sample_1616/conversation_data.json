    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)**\n\nTrisyllabic Laxing is a historical sound change in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of the word).\n\n*   **Condition 1:** The word must have at least three syllables.\n*   **Condition 2:** The vowel in question must be tense (e.g., the vowels in *sane*, *serene*, *divine*, *south*, *goose*).\n*   **Condition 3:** This tense vowel must be located in the third-to-last syllable of the word.\n\nIf all three conditions are met, the tense vowel changes to its corresponding lax vowel (e.g., /eɪ/ → /æ/, /iː/ → /ɛ/, /aɪ/ → /ɪ/).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyzing Each Word**\n\nLet's examine each word against the conditions for Trisyllabic Laxing.\n\n1.  **southern**\n    *   **Syllables:** `south-ern` (2 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word is disyllabic (has two syllables). Therefore, it does not meet Condition 1 for trisyllabic laxing. Although the vowel in the base word *south* (/aʊ/) is tense and the vowel in *southern* (/ʌ/) is lax, this change is not due to TSL.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has **not** undergone TSL.\n\n2.  **derivative**\n    *   **Syllables:** `de-riv-a-tive` (4 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word has more than three syllables. Let's look at the base word, *derive*. The vowel in the stressed syllable is the tense diphthong /aɪ/ (as in d**i**vine). In *derivative*, this syllable (`riv`) becomes the antepenultimate (third from end). The vowel sound changes from the tense /aɪ/ to the lax /ɪ/. This is a classic example of TSL.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Has** undergone TSL.\n\n3.  **serenity**\n    *   **Syllables:** `se-ren-i-ty` (4 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word has more than three syllables. Its base word is *serene*, which has a tense vowel /iː/ (as in s**e**rene). In *serenity*, this syllable (`ren`) is the antepenultimate syllable, and its vowel sound changes from the tense /iː/ to the lax /ɛ/. This is another classic example of TSL.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Has** undergone TSL.\n\n4.  **pleasant**\n    *   **Syllables:** `pleas-ant` (2 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word is disyllabic. It fails to meet Condition 1 for TSL. While the vowel in the base word *please* (/iː/) is tense and becomes lax (/ɛ/) in *pleasant*, this is an example of a different rule, often called pre-cluster shortening (shortening before the consonant cluster `-sant`), not TSL.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has **not** undergone TSL.\n\n5.  **gratitude**\n    *   **Syllables:** `grat-i-tude` (3 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word is trisyllabic. The `grat-` syllable is the antepenultimate. In the related word *grateful*, the vowel is tense: /eɪ/. Historically, this vowel was tense (/aː/), and in *gratitude*, it becomes the lax vowel /æ/. This fits the pattern of TSL.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Has** undergone TSL.\n\n6.  **shadow**\n    *   **Syllables:** `shad-ow` (2 syllables).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word is disyllabic, so it does not meet Condition 1 for TSL. Furthermore, looking at its history (from Old English *sceadu*), the vowel in the first syllable was always short/lax. There was never a tense vowel to be laxed. It fails to meet the conditions for TSL on two counts.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Has **not** undergone TSL.\n\n### **Step 3: Comparing the Results and Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\nWe have identified three words that have undergone TSL (*derivative*, *serenity*, *gratitude*) and three that have not (*southern*, *pleasant*, *shadow*). Since the question asks for a single answer, we must choose the best option among the words that did not undergo the change.\n\n*   *southern* and *pleasant* both derive from words with tense vowels (*south*, *please*). They *do* show a laxing process, but it's not TSL because they are only two syllables long.\n*   *shadow*, however, is fundamentally different. Not only is it disyllabic, but its stem vowel has been lax throughout its history in English. It was never a candidate for TSL or any other laxing process because there was no tense vowel to shorten in the first place.\n\nTherefore, *shadow* is the most definitive example of a word that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing, as it meets none of the criteria required for the rule to apply.\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n*   Trisyllabic Laxing is about the number of syllables in the *derived* word, not the base word.\n*   The key is identifying a historical change from a tense vowel to a lax vowel in the specific antepenultimate position.\n*   Other sound changes can cause vowel shortening/laxing (e.g., pre-cluster shortening). It is important to distinguish these from TSL.\n*   Some words, like *shadow*, have always had a lax vowel and were thus never eligible for laxing rules.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
