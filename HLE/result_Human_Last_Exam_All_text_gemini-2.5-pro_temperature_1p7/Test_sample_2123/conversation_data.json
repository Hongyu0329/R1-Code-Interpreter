    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the English surname of an English poet. This surname appears in a specific context: within the Russian translation of an essay, during a description of the wide boulevards of Vienna. This implies that the connection between the poet's name and the description is likely a pun or wordplay that functions in the Russian language.\n\n**Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Clue:** The key elements are \"wide boulevards,\" \"Vienna,\" \"Russian language,\" and \"English poet.\" The link must be a play on words.\n\n2.  **Focus on the Russian Language Pun:** Let's consider how one might describe something as \"wide\" in Russian. A common simile is \"широкий, как...\" (shirokiy, kak...), meaning \"as wide as...\". The puzzle suggests that the name of a poet can complete this phrase.\n\n3.  **Identify the Source:** This specific literary puzzle refers to a well-known passage from the essay \"A Guide to a Renamed City\" («Путеводитель по переименованному городу») by the Russian-American Nobel laureate Joseph Brodsky. In the essay, while describing Vienna, he makes exactly this pun.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Pun:** Brodsky writes that the Viennese boulevards are \"широкие, как...\" (\"wide as...\") and then notes that the surname of an English Romantic poet comes to mind.\n    *   In Russian, there is a common expression \"широк, как кит\" (shirok, kak kit), which translates to \"as wide as a whale.\"\n    *   The Russian word for \"whale\" is **\"кит\" (kit)**.\n\n5.  **Connect the Pun to an English Poet:** We need to find an English poet whose surname, when transliterated into Russian, sounds like \"кит\" (kit).\n    *   The great English Romantic poet John **Keats** is transliterated into Russian as **\"Китс\" (Kits)**.\n    *   The pronunciation of \"Китс\" (Kits) is nearly identical to that of \"кит\" (kit).\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The pun is that the Viennese boulevards are so wide that they could be described as \"широкие, как Китс\" (wide as Keats), which sounds to a Russian ear like \"as wide as a whale.\" The poet referenced is John Keats. The question asks for the surname.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Translation is Key:** The puzzle would not work in English. It relies entirely on the phonetic similarity between a Russian word (\"кит\") and the Russian transliteration of an English name (\"Китс\").\n*   **Specificity of \"Poet\":** The clue sometimes includes \"Romantic poet,\" which helps narrow down the possibilities from all English poets to a specific group (Byron, Shelley, Keats, Wordsworth, etc.), making Keats a prime candidate.\n*   **The Source Material:** Knowing the source (Brodsky's essay) makes solving the puzzle immediate, but it can be solved by deduction using linguistic knowledge.\n\nThe surname of the English poet is Keats.\n\n<<<Keats>>>"
