    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, leading to the final formula.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Definition of the Partition Function**\n\nThe starting point in quantum statistical mechanics is the canonical partition function, Z, which encapsulates the statistical properties of a system in thermal equilibrium at a temperature T. It is defined as the trace (Tr) of the density matrix operator:\n\n*   **Z = Tr(e⁻ᵇᴴ)**\n    *   **H** is the Hamiltonian of the system.\n    *   **β = 1/(k_B T)** is the inverse temperature (we will set Boltzmann's constant k_B = 1 for simplicity).\n    *   **Tr(...)** denotes the trace, which is a sum over a complete set of basis states of the system's Hilbert space: Tr(Ô) = Σₙ <n|Ô|n>.\n\n**Step 2: Connection to Imaginary Time Evolution**\n\nFeynman's path integral was originally formulated for quantum mechanics in real time, `t`. The time evolution operator is `U(t) = e⁻ⁱᴴᵗ/ħ` (setting ħ = 1). We can see a structural similarity between the statistical operator `e⁻ᵇᴴ` and the time evolution operator. This suggests a connection by performing a Wick rotation, replacing real time `t` with imaginary time `τ`:\n\n*   Let **t = -iτ**.\n*   The time evolution operator becomes `e⁻ⁱᴴ(-iτ) = e⁻ᴴτ`.\n*   If we set the duration of this evolution in imaginary time to be **τ = β**, we precisely recover the statistical operator `e⁻ᵇᴴ`.\n\nTherefore, the partition function Z can be interpreted as the sum over all possible \"evolutions\" of the system in an imaginary time interval of length β.\n\n**Step 3: Path Integral Formulation**\n\nFeynman's insight was to express the trace as a sum (or integral) over all possible \"paths\" or field configurations.\n\n*   To calculate the trace, `Tr(e⁻ᵇᴴ) = Σₙ <n|e⁻ᵇᴴ|n>`, we need to sum over all states `|n>` where the initial and final states are the same.\n*   In the path integral language, this means we must integrate over all field configurations `φ(x,τ)` that are **periodic** over the imaginary time interval β. That is, `φ(x, τ=0) = φ(x, τ=β)`.\n*   For a bosonic field `φ`, the path integral for the partition function is written as:\n    `Z = ∫ D[φ] e⁻ˢᴱ[φ]`\n    where `S_E` is the Euclidean action, the action of the system written in imaginary time.\n\n**Step 4: The Challenge of Fermions and Key Careful Points**\n\nThis is where fermions introduce critical differences compared to bosons.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Anticommutation and Grassmann Numbers.**\n    Fermionic creation (ψ†) and annihilation (ψ) operators **anticommute**, e.g., {ψᵢ, ψⱼ} = 0 and {ψᵢ†, ψⱼ} = δᵢⱼ. Standard numbers (c-numbers) commute. A path integral built on standard numbers cannot reproduce this anticommuting algebra.\n    *   **Solution:** We introduce a new mathematical object called a **Grassmann number**. These are anticommuting numbers. Let ψᵢ and ψⱼ be two Grassmann numbers; their defining property is **ψᵢψⱼ = -ψⱼψᵢ**. A crucial consequence is that **ψ² = 0** for any single Grassmann variable.\n    *   The path integral for fermions is therefore an integral over fields of these Grassmann numbers, denoted `ψ(x,τ)` and `ψ̄(x,τ)`. The integration measure is written as `D[ψ̄] D[ψ]`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Anti-periodic Boundary Conditions.**\n    The trace for fermions involves a sum over states from a Fock space built on anticommuting operators. The antisymmetry required by the Pauli exclusion principle has a profound effect on the boundary conditions in the path integral.\n    *   When the trace `Tr(e⁻ᵇᴴ)` is properly constructed for fermions, it leads to the requirement that the fermionic Grassmann fields must be **anti-periodic** in the imaginary time direction.\n    *   **Boundary Condition:** **ψ(x, τ=β) = -ψ(x, τ=0)**.\n    *   This is arguably the most important feature distinguishing the fermionic partition function from the bosonic one (which has periodic boundary conditions).\n\n**Step 5: Constructing the Final Formula**\n\nCombining these points, we can write down the formula.\n\n1.  **The Euclidean Action (S_E):** For a typical system of non-interacting fermions, the action in imaginary time is:\n    **S_E[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̄(x,τ) [∂_τ + H₀ - μ] ψ(x,τ)**\n    *   `ψ̄(x,τ)` and `ψ(x,τ)` are the independent Grassmann fields.\n    *   `∫₀ᵝ dτ` is the integral over the imaginary time interval from 0 to β.\n    *   `∫ dᵈx` is the integral over spatial dimensions.\n    *   `∂_τ` is the partial derivative with respect to imaginary time.\n    *   `H₀` is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator (e.g., for free particles, `H₀ = -∇²/2m`).\n    *   `μ` is the chemical potential, which controls the average particle number.\n\n2.  **The Path Integral Expression:** The partition function is the integral of `e⁻ˢᴱ` over all possible field configurations, subject to the correct boundary conditions.\n\n### Final Formula with Analysis\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman's path integral formalism is:\n\n**Z = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] e⁻ˢᴱ[ψ̄, ψ]**\n\nwhere the Euclidean action `S_E` is given by:\n\n**S_E[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̄(x,τ) [∂_τ + H₀ - μ] ψ(x,τ)**\n\nThe integral is performed over all Grassmann-valued field configurations `ψ(x,τ)` and `ψ̄(x,τ)` that satisfy **anti-periodic boundary conditions** in imaginary time:\n\n**ψ(x, τ + β) = -ψ(x, τ)**\n\nThis expression is a \"functional integral,\" representing an integral over all possible functions (paths) that the fermion fields can take, weighted by the exponential of the negative Euclidean action. It is the fundamental starting point for many calculations in quantum many-body theory and quantum field theory at finite temperature.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by Z = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ]), where S_E is the Euclidean action S_E = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̄(x,τ) (∂_τ + H₀ - μ) ψ(x,τ). The path integral ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] is over all independent, anticommuting Grassmann fields ψ̄ and ψ which must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time variable τ, i.e., ψ(x, τ=β) = -ψ(x, τ=0).>>>"
