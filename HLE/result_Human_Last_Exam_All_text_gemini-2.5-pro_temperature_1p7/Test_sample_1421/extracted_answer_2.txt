The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by Z = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ]), where S_E is the Euclidean action S_E = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx ψ̄(x,τ) (∂_τ + H₀ - μ) ψ(x,τ). The path integral ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] is over all independent, anticommuting Grassmann fields ψ̄ and ψ which must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time variable τ, i.e., ψ(x, τ=β) = -ψ(x, τ=0).
