    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Target Cryptosystem:** The question is about **symmetric key cryptography**. In this system, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. A common example is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).\n\n2.  **Understand the Threat Model:** The threat is an \"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer\". This means we must consider the most effective attacks that a quantum computer could perform. We are looking for a key length that would make a successful attack computationally infeasible, even with such a machine.\n\n3.  **Classical vs. Quantum Attacks on Symmetric Keys:**\n    *   **Classical Attack:** The most efficient general attack against a symmetric key algorithm is a **brute-force search**. For a key of length *n* bits, there are 2^n possible keys. A classical computer would have to try, on average, half of them (2^(n-1)) to find the correct one. The computational complexity is on the order of O(2^n). For AES-128, this means 2^128 operations, which is considered completely infeasible for any current or foreseeable classical computer. A 128-bit security level is the standard benchmark for strong classical security.\n    *   **Quantum Attack:** The most effective known quantum algorithm for this type of problem (an unstructured search) is **Grover's algorithm**. Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup compared to a classical brute-force search. Instead of O(N) operations to search a space of size N, it requires only O(√N) operations.\n\n4.  **Applying Grover's Algorithm to Key Cracking:**\n    *   The search space (the number of possible keys) for an *n*-bit key is N = 2^n.\n    *   Using Grover's algorithm, a quantum computer can find the correct key in approximately O(√(2^n)) = O(2^(n/2)) operations.\n    *   This means that Grover's algorithm effectively halves the security level of a symmetric key in terms of bits. An *n*-bit key provides only *n/2* bits of security against a quantum computer.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Required Minimum Key Length:**\n    *   The goal is to achieve a security level that is considered \"unbreakable\". The standard benchmark for this is a **128-bit security level**. This means an attacker would need to perform roughly 2^128 operations to break the encryption, which is considered secure for the foreseeable future, even against quantum computers.\n    *   Let *k* be the minimum required symmetric key length.\n    *   The security level provided by this key against a quantum computer is *k/2*.\n    *   We want this quantum security level to be at least 128 bits.\n    *   So, we set up the equation: `Security Level = k / 2 ≥ 128`\n    *   Solving for *k*: `k ≥ 128 * 2` -> `k ≥ 256`\n\n6.  **Conclusion and Evaluation of Choices:**\n    *   The calculation shows that a symmetric key must be at least **256 bits** long to provide a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer.\n    *   Let's check the options:\n        *   **A. 256:** A 256-bit key provides 256/2 = 128 bits of quantum security. This matches our requirement for the minimum secure length.\n        *   **B. 128:** A 128-bit key would provide only 128/2 = 64 bits of quantum security. 2^64 operations are considered feasible to perform, making this insecure.\n        *   **C. 512:** A 512-bit key provides 512/2 = 256 bits of quantum security. This is very secure, but the question asks for the *minimum* length.\n        *   **D. 1024 / E. 2048:** These are also secure but are longer than the required minimum.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography:** The impact of quantum computers is different for different types of cryptography. For asymmetric (public-key) cryptography like RSA and ECC, Shor's algorithm poses a much more severe threat, capable of breaking them completely with a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. This requires moving to entirely new \"post-quantum\" asymmetric algorithms.\n*   **Grover's Algorithm's Effectiveness:** The analysis assumes an ideal implementation of Grover's algorithm on a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer, which does not yet exist. However, when planning for long-term security, we must assume such a computer will eventually be built.\n*   **Security Level Benchmark:** The choice of a 128-bit security level as the target is a widely accepted standard (e.g., by organizations like NIST - the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology).\n*   **\"At Least\":** The question asks for the minimum length. While 512-bit keys are more secure, 256 bits is the minimum required to meet the 128-bit security benchmark against quantum attacks.\n\nTherefore, doubling the key size from the classical security standard of 128 bits to 256 bits is the standard recommendation to maintain a 128-bit security level in a post-quantum world.\n\n<<<A>>>"
