    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question asks to identify a specific philosopher from a particular school of thought who made a specific conceptual distinction.\n*   **Philosopher's Group:** Lviv-Warsaw School. This was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland during the interwar period. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n*   **Core Concept:** \"Hallmark\". This is the term to be analyzed. In the context of Polish philosophy and semiotics (the theory of signs), the Polish word is *znak*, which is most accurately translated as \"sign\". \"Hallmark\" can be considered a valid, if slightly less common, translation.\n*   **The Distinction:** The decomposition of \"hallmark\" (or *znak*) into two sub-categories: \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Philosopher and Their Theory**\nSearching within the works of the Lviv-Warsaw School for a theory of signs (*znak*) that involves a distinction between symptoms and signals points directly to **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**. He was a prominent logician and philosopher of language within this school. Ajdukiewicz's work in semiotics is fundamental to his philosophy.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Distinction Made by Ajdukiewicz**\nKazimierz Ajdukiewicz proposed a classification of signs (*znaki*). He divided them into two primary categories based on the nature of the relationship between the sign and what it signifies.\n\n*   **Symptom (Polish: *oznaka* or *symptom*):** This is a type of sign that has a **natural, causal connection** to the object or state of affairs it signifies. The relationship is not based on human intention or agreement. One event is a symptom of another if it is caused by it or regularly co-occurs with it due to natural laws.\n    *   *Example:* Smoke is a symptom of fire. A fever is a symptom of an illness. Dark clouds are a symptom of impending rain.\n\n*   **Signal (Polish: *sygnał*):** This is a type of sign whose connection to what it signifies is established by **convention, rule, or human agreement**. The relationship is arbitrary and must be learned. Signals are created with the intention of communicating.\n    *   *Example:* A red traffic light is a signal to stop. The word \"tree\" is a signal for the concept of a tree. A referee's whistle is a signal to stop play. Language itself is a complex system of signals.\n\n**Step 4: List Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Translation Nuance:** The term \"hallmark\" in the question is a translation of the Polish *znak*. The most standard and precise philosophical translation is **\"sign\"**. Understanding this helps situate the discussion within the field of semiotics.\n2.  **The Basis of Distinction:** The critical difference is **causality vs. convention**. Symptoms are linked naturally (cause-and-effect), while signals are linked artificially (by agreement or rule).\n3.  **Intentionality:** Signals are typically produced with the intention to communicate a specific meaning. Symptoms, on the other hand, are natural occurrences and do not inherently have a communicative intention (though a person can intentionally point out a symptom to communicate).\n4.  **Philosophical Context:** This distinction was part of the Lviv-Warsaw School's broader project of achieving conceptual clarity and logical rigor in philosophy. By analyzing a common-sense notion like \"sign\" into its constituent, mutually exclusive parts, Ajdukiewicz was applying the analytical method for which the school was famous.\n5.  **Attribution:** While other philosophers (historically and within the school) discussed signs, this specific and influential dichotomy between the naturally caused \"symptom\" and the conventionally established \"signal\" is a hallmark (pun intended) of Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz's philosophy of language and logic.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made this distinction is clearly Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. He systematically broke down the concept of a sign (*znak*) into categories, the most fundamental of which are symptoms (*oznaki*) and signals (*sygnały*).\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
