    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Novel:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Core Question:** The name of the spouse of the novel's main character.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe protagonist of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski. He is a human from the 21st century who has been cryogenically frozen and resurrected in the far future, a time dominated by post-human entities.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the plot to find the main character's romantic relationships and marriage.**\n*   Upon his resurrection, Adam Zamoyski is guided through this new, incomprehensible reality by a powerful post-human being (a \"phoebe\").\n*   This guide becomes his primary protector, mentor, and eventually his love interest. Their relationship is central to the narrative.\n*   The novel builds towards a formal, binding union between Adam, a baseline human (\"stah\"), and this post-human being. This union is the functional and narrative equivalent of a marriage, a merger of two vastly different forms of existence.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name of this character.**\nThe name of the post-human character who guides Adam and whom he ultimately marries is Angelika.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Protagonist's Identity:** It's crucial to correctly identify Adam Zamoyski as the protagonist.\n*   **Concept of \"Marriage\":** The union in the book is not a traditional human marriage. It's a far-future, technologically profound bond. However, within the context of the story, it is the formal union that answers the question.\n*   **Spelling:** The name is Angelika, a common name, which simplifies recall.\n*   **Distinguishing Characters:** Angelika is the most significant relationship Adam forms, making her distinct from other entities he interacts with.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the plot and the relationships of the main character, Adam Zamoyski, we can definitively state that he marries the post-human character Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
