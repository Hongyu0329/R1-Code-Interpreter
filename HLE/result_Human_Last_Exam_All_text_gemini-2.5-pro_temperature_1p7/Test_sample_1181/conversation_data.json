    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying trait is that this character expresses shame about missing a particular sensory experience from Earth: the sound of rustling leaves.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Answer Choices (Characters)**\nLet's consider the psychology and role of each character in the film.\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist, a psychologist sent to the station. The film is bookended by scenes of him on Earth at his father's dacha, surrounded by nature. He is deeply connected to Earth and his past, but his primary emotional conflict revolves around his guilt over his deceased wife, Hari. While he certainly misses Earth, the specific emotion of *shame* for missing rustling leaves is not his defining sentiment.\n*   **B. Hari:** Hari is not a human being but a \"visitor\" or \"guest\" created by the sentient ocean of Solaris from Kris's memories. She has no genuine memories of Earth herself, only those implanted from Kris's mind. Therefore, she could not miss something she has never truly experienced.\n*   **C. Snaut:** Dr. Snaut is a cybernetics expert and one of the two scientists who have been on the station for a long time before Kris arrives. He is depicted as world-weary, cynical, and often philosophical. He has become detached from humanity and Earthly concerns due to his prolonged isolation. A moment of profound nostalgia breaking through his cynical exterior would be a significant character beat.\n*   **D. Sartorius:** Dr. Sartorius is an astrobiologist, the other scientist on the station. He is portrayed as cold, rigid, and clinical. He treats the \"visitors\" as a scientific problem to be solved, showing little patience for emotion or nostalgia, which he would likely view as a weakness. It is highly inconsistent with his character to express such a poetic and vulnerable sentiment.\n*   E. **Gibarian:** Gibarian is a physiologist and friend of Kris who commits suicide just before Kris's arrival. We only see him in a video message he left for Kris. His message is one of despair and warning about the situation on the station. While he may have felt such emotions, this specific statement is not attributed to him in his brief appearance.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Specific Scene and Dialogue**\nThe line in question is spoken during a scene in the station's library, where the characters are celebrating Kris's \"birthday.\" In this scene, a drunken and emotional Dr. Snaut delivers a monologue about humanity's flawed reasons for space exploration. He says that humans don't really want new worlds; they want a mirror. He expresses deep disillusionment with their scientific mission. It is in this vulnerable state that he confesses his simple, profound longing for Earth. He admits that he is ashamed to be reduced to missing something as basic as the rustling of leaves, seeing it as a failure of their grand ambitions.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the character analysis and the specific dialogue from the film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling is Dr. Snaut. This confession highlights his internal conflict between his scientific cynicism and his deep-seated, undeniable human need for connection to his home world.\n\n<<<C>>>"
