The analysis is based on the canonical human CaVβ1 protein sequence (UniProt accession number Q02641).

**1) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit:**

The primary interaction occurs when the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1 subunit binds into a hydrophobic groove on the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain of the beta-1 subunit. The key residues on the beta-1 subunit that form this binding groove and are hotspots for the interaction are:

*   **Tyrosine 278 (Y278)**
*   **Isoleucine 311 (I311)**
*   **Valine 314 (V314)**
*   **Valine 352 (V352)**
*   **Methionine 373 (M373)**
*   **Isoleucine 376 (I376)**
*   **Tryptophan 421 (W421)**
*   **Valine 422 (V422)**

These residues, among others in the vicinity, make direct hydrophobic and van der Waals contacts with the AID helix, anchoring the beta-1 subunit to the alpha-1 subunit.

**2) Residues from the beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for fine-tuning gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit:**

Gating modulation is functionally distinct from the binding event and is mediated by several regions of the beta-1 subunit that allosterically influence the alpha-1 subunit. The key hotspots are located in variable regions outside the core binding pocket.

*   **The N-Terminus Region:** This region (approx. residues 1-35) plays a crucial role in modulating both the speed of inactivation and the voltage-dependence of activation. The exact sequence here differs between splice variants, making it a critical determinant of function. In the common CaVβ1b splice variant, a di-leucine motif has been identified as a key modulator:
    *   **Leucine 21 (L21)** and **Leucine 22 (L22)**

*   **The HOOK Region (SH3-GK Linker):** This flexible linker (approx. residues 239-258) controls the relative orientation of the SH3 and GK domains, which in turn influences channel inactivation kinetics. A conserved proline residue is thought to be a critical pivot point for this modulatory action:
    *   **Proline 247 (P247)**

*   **The SH3 Domain Surface:** A secondary modulatory site exists on the SH3 domain that interacts with other parts of the alpha-1 subunit. This interaction is important for voltage-dependent inactivation. A key residue identified at this auxiliary site is:
    *   **Lysine 230 (K230)**
