    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the components of the question\n\n1.  **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$. A unary predicate describes a property of a single element in the domain.\n2.  **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This notation describes a specific subset of First-Order Logic.\n    *   **FO**: First-Order Logic.\n    *   **[S]**: The logic uses only the predicates from schema S. The atomic formulas are of the form $P_i(v)$, where $v$ is a variable.\n    *   **Subscripts**: Only the following logical symbols are allowed:\n        *   $\\exists$: The existential quantifier.\n        *   $\\land$: Conjunction (AND).\n        *   $\\top$: The logical constant for True.\n        *   $\\bot$: The logical constant for False.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The fragment does not include negation ($\\lnot$), disjunction ($\\lor$), or the universal quantifier ($\\forall$).\n3.  **VC Dimension**: The VC dimension measures the complexity of a class of classifiers. In our context:\n    *   **Classifiers**: These are the formulas $\\phi(x)$ in our logic fragment that have exactly one free variable, say $x$.\n    *   **Concept**: For a given model (a universe of elements and an interpretation of the predicates), a formula $\\phi(x)$ defines a concept, which is the set of all elements $a$ in the universe for which $\\phi(a)$ is true.\n    *   **Shattering**: A set of points $X$ is shattered by our logic if for every possible subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists a formula $\\phi_Y(x)$ in our logic that \"picks out\" exactly $Y$ from $X$. That is, the set $\\{a \\in X \\mid \\phi_Y(a) \\text{ is true}\\}$ is equal to $Y$.\n    *   **VC Dimension of a Logic**: It is the size of the largest set $X$ that can be shattered. To establish the VC dimension, we need to show that there *exists* some model in which a set of that size can be shattered.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize the formulas (the Hypothesis Class)\n\nLet's analyze the structure of any formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in our logic fragment.\nA general formula could involve existential quantifiers over other variables, e.g., $\\exists y_1 \\exists y_2 \\dots \\psi(x, y_1, y_2, \\dots)$.\nThe part inside the quantifiers, $\\psi$, can only be a conjunction of atomic formulas (since $\\land$ is the only connective). Since predicates are unary, each atom involves only one variable. So, we can group the atoms by variable:\n$\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots) = \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\bigwedge_{j \\in I_1} P_j(y_1) \\right) \\land \\left( \\bigwedge_{k \\in I_2} P_k(y_2) \\right) \\land \\dots$\n\nWe can rewrite the full formula by distributing the quantifiers:\n$\\phi(x) = \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\exists y_1 \\bigwedge_{j \\in I_1} P_j(y_1) \\right) \\land \\left( \\exists y_2 \\bigwedge_{k \\in I_2} P_k(y_2) \\right) \\land \\dots$\n\nEach part like $\\exists y (\\dots)$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). For any specific model, a sentence is either true or false. Let's call these sentences $C_1, C_2, \\dots$. So the formula becomes:\n$\\phi(x) = \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x) \\right) \\land C_1 \\land C_2 \\land \\dots$\n\nIn a given model, the conjunction of sentences $C_1 \\land C_2 \\land \\dots$ is either true (evaluates to $\\top$) or false (evaluates to $\\bot$).\nTherefore, for any given model, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to one of two forms:\n1.  $\\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x) \\right) \\land \\top \\equiv \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x)$\n2.  $\\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_0} P_i(x) \\right) \\land \\bot \\equiv \\bot$\n\n**Careful Point**: The hypothesis class (the set of all possible concepts) defined by our logic consists of sets definable by formulas that are conjunctions of positive atomic formulas, e.g., $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$, as well as the empty set $\\emptyset$ (from $\\bot$) and the whole universe (from $\\top$, which is an empty conjunction). This is equivalent to the class of concepts formed by taking intersections of the sets defined by the base predicates. With 4 predicates, this is the class of intersections of 4 sets.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Lower Bound of the VC Dimension\n\nTo show that $\\mathrm{VCdim} \\ge 4$, we must construct a model and a set $X$ of size 4 that is shattered.\n\n*   **Construction**:\n    *   Let the set to be shattered be $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We can define the universe of our model as $U=X$.\n    *   Let $S_i$ be the set of elements where predicate $P_i$ is true. We define these sets as follows: $S_i = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    *   This specifies our model. For instance, $P_1$ is true for $\\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$ but false for $x_1$.\n\n*   **Proof of Shattering**: We must show that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can find a formula $\\phi_Y(x)$ in our logic that defines $Y$.\n    *   Let $Y$ be any subset of $X$.\n    *   Let $I_Y = \\{i \\mid x_i \\in X \\setminus Y\\}$ be the set of indices corresponding to the elements *not* in $Y$.\n    *   Consider the formula $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_Y} P_i(x)$. This is a valid formula in our fragment.\n    *   The set defined by $\\phi_Y(x)$ is the intersection of the corresponding sets $S_i$: $\\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} S_i = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} (X \\setminus \\{x_i\\})$.\n    *   By De Morgan's laws, this is equivalent to $X \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I_Y} \\{x_i\\}$.\n    *   By definition of $I_Y$, the union $\\bigcup_{i \\in I_Y} \\{x_i\\}$ is exactly the set of elements not in $Y$, which is $X \\setminus Y$.\n    *   So the defined set is $X \\setminus (X \\setminus Y) = Y$.\n\nSince we can define any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 4: Find the Upper Bound of the VC Dimension\n\nTo show that $\\mathrm{VCdim} \\le 4$, we must show that no set of size 5 can be shattered, in any model.\n\n*   **Argument**:\n    *   Let $X$ be any set of points of size 5. To shatter $X$, we would need to be able to define all $2^5 = 32$ of its subsets.\n    *   As established in Step 2, in any model, a formula from our logic can only define concepts that are intersections of the base sets $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$, or the empty set.\n    *   The number of possible ways to choose a subset of the 4 predicates to form a conjunction is $2^4 = 16$.\n    *   This means that we can form at most 16 distinct concepts of the form $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i$. Even if some conjunctions define the same set, the total number of distinct concepts cannot exceed 16.\n    *   The concepts $\\top$ and $\\bot$ define the entire universe and the empty set respectively, which are already included (the empty intersection gives the universe, and some non-empty intersection might give the empty set).\n    *   So, our logic can generate at most 16 different subsets of the universe.\n    *   Since $16 < 32$, there are not enough distinct concepts to realize all possible subsets of a 5-element set.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This argument holds for any model because the limitation on the number of formulas is inherent to the logic itself, not the specific model.\n\nTherefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered, which means the VC dimension is less than 5, i.e., $\\mathrm{VCdim} \\le 4$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nCombining the results from the lower and upper bounds:\n*   $\\mathrm{VCdim} \\ge 4$\n*   $\\mathrm{VCdim} \\le 4$\n\nThus, the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
