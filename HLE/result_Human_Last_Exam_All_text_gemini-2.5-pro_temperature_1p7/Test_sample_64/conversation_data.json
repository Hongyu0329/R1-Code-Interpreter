    "*   **Step 1: Identify the word and its pronunciation.**\n    The word is 「弟」. Its reading is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n*   **Step 2: Break down the pronunciation into morae.**\n    A mora is a unit of sound that determines timing and rhythm in Japanese.\n    「おとうと」 is composed of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to).\n\n*   **Step 3: Understand the different types of Japanese pitch accent patterns.**\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板式):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. It is often represented with a [0]. Example: さかな (sa(L)-ka(H)-na(H)) + が (ga(H)) -> さかなが.\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式):** The pitch is high on the first mora and then drops on all subsequent morae, including the following particle. It is represented by a [1]. Example: いのち (i(H)-no(L)-chi(L)) + が (ga(L)) -> いのちが.\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高式):** The pitch starts low, rises after the first mora, and drops somewhere in the middle of the word. The following particle is low. The number [n] indicates the pitch drops after the nth mora. Example: あなた (a(L)-na(H)-ta(L)) + が (ga(L)) -> あなたが. This is a [2] pattern for a 3-mora word.\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高式):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high until the last mora of the word. It drops on the following particle. The number [n] represents the number of morae in the word. Example: いもうと (i(L)-mo(H)-u(H)-to(H)) + が (ga(L)) -> いもうとが. This is a [4] pattern for a 4-mora word.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the pitch accent of 「弟」 (おとうと).**\n    The standard Tokyo dialect accent for 「おとうと」 is pronounced with the first mora (お) low and the following morae (と, う, と) high.\n    - お(↓)とうと(↑↑↑)\n    When a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached, it also remains high.\n    - お(↓)とうと(↑↑↑)が(↑)\n    This pattern, where the pitch rises after the first mora and does not fall again (even on the particle), is the defining characteristic of the **Heiban (平板式)** pattern. In accent dictionaries, this is marked as [0].\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare the analysis with the given answer choices.**\n    *   A. Heiban: This matches our analysis.\n    *   B. Atamadaka: This would be **お**とうと (**o**touto), which is incorrect.\n    *   C. Nakadaka: This would mean the pitch drops within the word, like お**と**うと (o**to**uto), which is incorrect.\n    *   D. Odaka: This would mean the pitch drops on the particle, like お**とうと**が (o**touto** ga), which is incorrect.\n    *   E. Heiban or Nakadaka: There isn't a widely accepted Nakadaka variant for this word in standard Japanese.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 is Heiban.\n\n<<<A>>>"
