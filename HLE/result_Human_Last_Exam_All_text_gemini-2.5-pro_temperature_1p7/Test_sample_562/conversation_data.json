    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Character**\nThe character in question is 謄. We need to identify its primary radical, known as *bushu* (部首) in Japanese. A kanji can be made of several components, but only one is designated as its official radical for dictionary classification.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the Character and Identify the Radical**\nThe character 謄 can be visually broken down. It appears to have a left part and a right part.\n*   The left part is 月. This is often a radical itself, called *tsuki* or, when it represents \"flesh,\" *nikuzuki*.\n*   The right part is more complex, but it contains the component 言 at the bottom.\n\nTo definitively determine the radical, we must refer to standard kanji dictionaries. In these dictionaries, characters are grouped by their main radical. The character 謄 is classified under the section for the radical **言**. This is because 言 (meaning \"words,\" \"to say\") is the primary semantic component, indicating the character's meaning of \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe,\" which is an action related to words. The other parts primarily contribute to the character's pronunciation.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Name of the Radical**\nThe radical is 言. In Japanese, radicals often have specific names, which can change depending on their position within a character.\n*   When 言 appears on the left side of a character (e.g., 話, 語, 説), it is called **ごんべん (gonben)**. The \"gon\" part comes from one of the readings of the character 言, and \"ben\" (a phonetic variation of \"hen\") means \"left side.\"\n*   When 言 appears as a full character or at the bottom, it can be called by its *kun'yomi* reading, *kotoba*.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Correct Name and Transcription**\nThe question asks for the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name, providing \"Onnahen\" as an example for 媛. In 媛, the radical 女 is on the left, so its name is *onnahen*.\n\nIn the case of 謄, the radical 言 is not strictly on the left side. However, the name **Gonben** is the most common and standard way to refer to the entire family of kanji classified under the 言 radical, regardless of its specific position. It is the name used for the radical section in most dictionaries. Therefore, \"Gonben\" is the correct and expected answer.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Formulation**\n*   **Character:** 謄\n*   **Radical:** 言\n*   **Name of Radical Group:** ごんべん (Gonben)\n*   **Hepburn Transcription:** Gonben\n\nThe final answer is the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
