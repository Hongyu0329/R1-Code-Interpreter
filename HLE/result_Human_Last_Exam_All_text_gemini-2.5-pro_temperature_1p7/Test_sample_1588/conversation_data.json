    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Expansion**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an explicit expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$ where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting elements of a Lie algebra. The formula is given by a series expansion:\n$Z = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\n\nEach term $Z_n(X, Y)$ is a homogeneous polynomial of total degree $n$ in $X$ and $Y$. More specifically, $Z_n$ is a *Lie polynomial*, meaning it is a linear combination of nested commutators involving $n$ instances of $X$ and $Y$.\nFor example:\n*   $Z_1 = X + Y$\n*   $Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]$\n*   $Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X,[X,Y]] + \\frac{1}{12}[Y,[Y,X]]$\n\n**Step 2: Interpreting the \"Number of Non-Zero Coefficients\"**\n\nThe question asks for the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10. This refers to the term $Z_{10}(X, Y)$. When we express $Z_{10}$ in a canonical basis of Lie polynomials of degree 10, the \"coefficients\" are the numerical factors multiplying these basis elements. The question is asking for the number of such basis elements that are present with a non-zero coefficient in the expansion of $Z_{10}$.\n\n**Step 3: Connecting to the Dimension of the Free Lie Algebra**\n\nThe set of all homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree $n$ in two variables ($X$ and $Y$) forms a vector space over the rational numbers, denoted as $\\mathcal{L}_n(X, Y)$. The term $Z_n(X, Y)$ is an element of this space.\n\nA fundamental result in the theory states that the BCH expansion does not have accidental cancellations of entire basis elements. In other words, when $Z_n$ is written as a linear combination of basis elements for $\\mathcal{L}_n(X, Y)$, all the coefficients are non-zero. Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients in $Z_n$ is equal to the number of basis elements of $\\mathcal{L}_n(X, Y)$, which is its dimension.\n\n**Step 4: Calculating the Dimension using the Witt Formula**\n\nThe dimension of the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree $n$ in $k$ variables, denoted $\\dim(\\mathcal{L}_n(k))$, is given by the **Witt formula**:\n\n$N_n(k) = \\dim(\\mathcal{L}_n(k)) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $n$ is the degree (order).\n*   $k$ is the number of variables (generators).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n*   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n**Step 5: Applying the Witt Formula to the Specific Problem**\n\nFor this question, we have:\n*   Order (degree) $n = 10$.\n*   Number of variables $k = 2$ (since we use $X$ and $Y$).\n\nPlugging these values into the Witt formula gives:\n$N_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n\n**Step 6: Performing the Calculation**\n\n1.  **Identify the divisors of n=10:** The divisors are $d = \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n\n2.  **Recall the values of the Möbius function $\\mu(d)$:**\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (since 2 is a single prime factor)\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (since 5 is a single prime factor)\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (since 10 is the product of 2 distinct prime factors)\n\n3.  **Calculate each term in the sum $\\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$:**\n    *   For $d=1$:  $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = (1) \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$\n    *   For $d=2$:  $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = (-1) \\cdot 2^5 = -32$\n    *   For $d=5$:  $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = (-1) \\cdot 2^2 = -4$\n    *   For $d=10$: $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = (1) \\cdot 2^1 = 2$\n\n4.  **Compute the sum:**\n    Sum = $1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990$\n\n5.  **Divide by n=10 to get the final answer:**\n    $N_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 990 = 99$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the space of homogeneous Lie polynomials of degree 10 in two variables, which is calculated to be 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
