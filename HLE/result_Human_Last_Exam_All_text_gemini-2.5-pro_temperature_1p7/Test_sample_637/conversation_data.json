    "An elegant way to solve this problem is to first perform a coordinate transformation to a form where the design of the observer gain matrix is simplified. The original system is given by:\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwhere:\nA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]\nB = [[0], [1], [-1], [1]]\nC = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]\n\nThe dimension of the state vector is n=4, and the dimension of the output vector is p=2. The goal is to design a deadbeat observer with the fastest possible convergence. This means the observer error, e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k), must converge to zero in a number of steps equal to the observability index of the system.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Observability and the Observability Index**\n\nThe observability matrix is O = [C^T, (CA)^T, (CA^2)^T, ...]^T.\nC = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]\nCA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]\nThe matrix [C; CA] has rank 3, which is less than n=4. So we need to compute the next term.\nA^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [-3, 0, 2, -1], [1, -1, -1, 3], [0, 1, -1, 1]]\nCA^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [0, 1, 0, -1]]\nThe matrix [C; CA; CA^2] is an 6x4 matrix. The rows {[1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,1], [0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,-1]} can be formed as linear combinations of the rows of [C; CA; CA^2], indicating that its rank is 4. Thus, the system is observable.\nThe observability index, ν, is the smallest integer such that rank([C; CA; ...; C*A^(ν-1)]) = n. Here, ν=3. This means the error can be made to be identically zero in 3 steps. This requires that the error dynamics matrix, (A - LC), be nilpotent with nilpotency index 3, which implies all its eigenvalues must be at z=0.\n\n**Step 2: Coordinate Transformation**\n\nWe choose a coordinate transformation z = Tx such that the new output matrix C_bar = C*T^(-1) has the form [I_p, 0]. The rows of C are linearly independent. We can choose T by taking the rows of C and appending two more linearly independent rows.\nLet T = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]. This matrix is invertible.\nIts inverse is T^(-1) = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [-1, 1, 0, 0]].\nThe new system matrices are A_bar = T*A*T^(-1) and C_bar = C*T^(-1).\nC_bar = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] * T^(-1) = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]] = [I_2, 0].\nA_bar = T * A * T^(-1) = [[-2, 1, 0, 0], [-2, 0, 0, 1], [-1, 2, 0, 0], [0, -1, 1, 0]].\n\n**Step 3: Design Observer Gain in Transformed Coordinates**\n\nLet z = [z_m; z_u], where z_m corresponds to the measured states and z_u to the unmeasured states.\ny = C_bar * z = z_m.\nWe partition A_bar accordingly:\nA_bar = [[A_11, A_12], [A_21, A_22]] where\nA_11 = [[-2, 1], [-2, 0]], A_12 = [[0, 0], [0, 1]]\nA_21 = [[-1, 2], [0, -1]], A_22 = [[0, 0], [1, 0]]\nThe observer gain in the transformed coordinates, L_bar, is related to L by L_bar = T*L. The error dynamics matrix in the transformed system is A_bar - L_bar*C_bar. Let L_bar = [L1_bar; L2_bar].\nA_bar - L_bar*C_bar = [[A_11 - L1_bar, A_12], [A_21 - L2_bar, A_22]].\nTo make this matrix nilpotent with the required index, we can choose L1_bar and L2_bar to simplify its structure. A standard choice that achieves deadbeat response is:\nL1_bar = A_11 = [[-2, 1], [-2, 0]]\nL2_bar = A_21 = [[-1, 2], [0, -1]]\nThis yields the observer gain in the transformed coordinates:\nL_bar = [[-2, 1], [-2, 0], [-1, 2], [0, -1]]\nWith this gain, the error dynamics matrix becomes:\nF_bar = A_bar - L_bar*C_bar = [[0, A_12], [0, A_22]] = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]].\nIt can be verified that F_bar^2 != 0 but F_bar^3 = 0, which corresponds to the fastest possible convergence.\n\n**Step 4: Transform Gain Back to Original Coordinates**\n\nThe observer gain L for the original system is found by transforming L_bar back: L = T^(-1) * L_bar.\nL = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [-1, 1, 0, 0]] * [[-2, 1], [-2, 0], [-1, 2], [0, -1]]\nL = [[-2, 1],\n     [-1, 2],\n     [0, -1],\n     [0, -1]]\n\nThis is the required observer gain matrix.\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
