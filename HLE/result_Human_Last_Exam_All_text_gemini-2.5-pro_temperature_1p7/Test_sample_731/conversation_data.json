    "An analysis of the question to find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions.**\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, has the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, sr = r^{k}s \\rangle$ where $k = -1 + 2^{n-2}$.\n    In this problem, the group order is 512, which is $2^9$. So, we have $n=9$.\n    The group is $G = SD_{512}$, with order $2^9$.\n    The presentation is $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{9-1}} = r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, sr = r^{-1+2^{9-2}}s = r^{127}s \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $m$ such that $H$ is the subgroup generated by all the $m$-th powers of elements of $G$. This is denoted by $H = G^m = \\langle g^m \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    The question asks for the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way. That is, we need to find the size of the set $\\{ G^m \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the problem by relating $G^m$ to the group exponent.**\n*   The set of power subgroups is determined by the exponent of the group, $\\exp(G)$. The exponent is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $g^k=1$ for all $g \\in G$.\n*   Let $e = \\exp(G)$. It can be shown that for any integer $m$, the power subgroup $G^m$ is equal to the subgroup $G^d$, where $d = \\gcd(m, e)$.\n    *   **Proof:** Let $d = \\gcd(m, e)$. Since $d$ divides $m$, $m=dk$ for some integer $k$. Any element $g^m = (g^k)^d$ is a $d$-th power, so it belongs to $G^d$. Therefore, $G^m \\subseteq G^d$. Conversely, by the extended Euclidean algorithm, $d = am + be$ for some integers $a, b$. For any $g \\in G$, $g^d = g^{am+be} = g^{am}g^{be} = (g^a)^m (g^e)^b$. Since $e = \\exp(G)$, $g^e = 1$. Thus, $g^d = (g^a)^m$, which is an $m$-th power of an element in $G$. This means any generator of $G^d$ is in $G^m$, so $G^d \\subseteq G^m$. Therefore, $G^m=G^d=G^{\\gcd(m,e)}$.\n*   This means the number of distinct power subgroups is equal to the number of distinct subgroups of the form $G^d$, where $d$ is a divisor of $\\exp(G)$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the exponent of $G = SD_{512}$.**\n*   We need to find the orders of all elements in $G$. The elements are of the form $r^i$ or $r^i s$.\n*   The order of $r^i$ is $256/\\gcd(i, 256)$. The maximum order for these elements is $o(r) = 256$.\n*   Let's find the order of elements of the form $r^i s$. We calculate $(r^i s)^2$:\n    $(r^i s)^2 = r^i s r^i s = r^i (sr^i s^{-1})s^2$.\n    Using the relation $srs^{-1} = r^{127}$, we get $sr^i s^{-1} = (srs^{-1})^i = (r^{127})^i = r^{127i}$.\n    So, $(r^i s)^2 = r^i \\cdot r^{127i} = r^{128i}$.\n    *   If $i$ is even ($i=2j$), then $(r^{2j}s)^2 = r^{128(2j)} = r^{256j} = 1$. The order is 2.\n    *   If $i$ is odd ($i=2j+1$), then $(r^{(2j+1)}s)^2 = r^{128(2j+1)} = r^{256j} \\cdot r^{128} = r^{128}$. Since $(r^{128})^2 = r^{256} = 1$, the order of $r^i s$ is 4 when $i$ is odd.\n*   The set of possible element orders is $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, \\dots, 256\\}$.\n*   The exponent of $G$, $\\exp(G)$, is the least common multiple of all element orders, which is 256.\n\n**Step 4: Count the divisors of the exponent.**\n*   We need to find the number of distinct subgroups $G^d$ where $d$ is a divisor of $\\exp(G) = 256$.\n*   The number 256 can be written as $2^8$. The divisors of $2^8$ are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8$.\n*   The divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\n*   There are $8+1=9$ divisors. This means there are at most 9 distinct power subgroups.\n\n**Step 5: Verify that these 9 subgroups are indeed distinct.**\n*   We calculate the subgroups $G^d$ for each divisor $d$ of 256.\n*   For $d=1$: $G^1 = G$. The order is 512.\n*   For $d=2$: $G^2 = \\langle g^2 \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$. The set of squares consists of elements of the form $(r^i)^2 = r^{2i}$ and $(r^is)^2=r^{128i}$. The subgroup generated by $\\{r^{2i}\\}$ is $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$. The subgroup generated by $\\{r^{128i}\\}$ is $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$. Since $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle \\subset \\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (as $128=2\\cdot64$), the subgroup generated by all squares is $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic subgroup of order $256/2 = 128$.\n*   For $d=4$: $G^4 = (G^2)^2 = (\\langle r^2 \\rangle)^2 = \\langle (r^2)^2 \\rangle = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$. This has order $256/4 = 64$.\n*   In general, for $d = 2^k$ with $k \\ge 1$: $G^{2^k} = \\langle r^{2^k} \\rangle$. The order is $256/2^k = 2^{8-k}$.\n*   Let's list the resulting subgroups and their orders:\n    1.  $d=1=2^0$: $G^1 = G$, order 512.\n    2.  $d=2=2^1$: $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$, order 128.\n    3.  $d=4=2^2$: $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$, order 64.\n    4.  $d=8=2^3$: $G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$, order 32.\n    5.  $d=16=2^4$: $G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$, order 16.\n    6.  $d=32=2^5$: $G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$, order 8.\n    7.  $d=64=2^6$: $G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$, order 4.\n    8.  $d=128=2^7$: $G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$, order 2.\n    9.  $d=256=2^8$: $G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$, order 1.\n*   Since all these subgroups have different orders, they are all distinct.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between the divisors of the group's exponent (256) and the set of power subgroups. The number of divisors of $256 = 2^8$ is $8+1=9$. Thus, there are 9 distinct power subgroups.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{9}$.\n\n<<<9>>>"
