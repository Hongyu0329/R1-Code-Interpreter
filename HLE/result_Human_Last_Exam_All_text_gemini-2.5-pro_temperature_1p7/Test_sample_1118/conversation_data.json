    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the object Curt Querner holds in his 1933 self-portrait.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the specific artwork and its context.**\nThe question refers to a self-portrait painted by Curt Querner in 1933. The crucial context is that it was made after he was arrested by Nazi authorities. Querner was a member of the \"Assoziation revolutionärer bildender Künstler\" (Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists), a Communist-affiliated group. In May 1933, shortly after the Nazis seized power, he was arrested by the SA (Sturmabteilung) and held in custody. The self-portrait was created after his release, making it a powerful statement of his state of mind and political position. The painting is often titled \"Self-Portrait with Red Scarf\" or \"Self-Portrait after Release from Custody\".\n\n**Step 2: Examine the symbolic elements of the painting.**\nTo understand the meaning of the object he holds, we must look at the painting's other symbols.\n*   **The Red Scarf:** The most prominent symbol is the red scarf or cloth around his neck. Red was the color of Communism and the international workers' movement. Displaying this color so boldly in 1933 was an act of open defiance against the Nazi regime, which was violently suppressing all political opposition, especially communists.\n*   **The Defiant Gaze:** Querner does not look defeated. He stares directly and intensely at the viewer with a stern, determined expression. This posture conveys an unbroken will and refusal to be intimidated.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the object in his hand.**\nObserving the painting, we can see that Querner holds a long, thin, colored object in his right hand. It is pointed like a pencil. Given his profession as a painter and draftsman, this is a tool of his trade. The color of this tool is crucial.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the symbolism of the object.**\nThe object he is holding is a **red crayon** or **red chalk pencil**. This choice is highly significant.\n*   **Connection to his Art:** By holding a tool of his craft, he identifies himself primarily as an artist.\n*   **Connection to his Politics:** By holding a *red* crayon, he connects his art directly to his political convictions. Just like the red scarf, the red color of the crayon symbolizes his unwavering commitment to his leftist beliefs.\n*   **The Symbol of Resistance:** The red crayon is therefore a symbol of resistance on multiple levels. It signifies that he will not be silenced. He will continue to use his art—his means of expression and his \"weapon\"—in service of his political cause, despite the persecution he has just endured. It is a declaration that his artistic and political identities are inseparable and that he will continue to fight the Nazi regime through his work.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Arrest vs. Escape:** The prompt mentions \"escaped from Gestapo.\" Historical sources more commonly state he was arrested by the SA and then released. The core context of persecution by the new Nazi regime remains the same.\n*   **Crayon vs. Pencil:** The object is described variously as a red crayon, colored pencil, or chalk pencil. The exact medium is less important than its function as an artist's tool and its symbolic red color.\n*   **Integrated Symbolism:** The power of the object comes from its combination with the other elements—the red scarf and the defiant gaze. Together, they create a portrait not of a victim, but of a resistor who will continue his fight with the tools he has.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on this analysis, the object Curt Querner holds in his hand is a red crayon, which symbolizes his defiance and his commitment to continuing his political struggle through his art.\n\n<<<A red crayon.>>>"
