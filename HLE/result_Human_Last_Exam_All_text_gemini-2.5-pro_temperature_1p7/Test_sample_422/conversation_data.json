    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Premise:**\n    *   **Definition of Knowledge:** Knowledge is Justified True Belief (K = JTB). This means for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met: (1) P is true, (2) S believes P, and (3) S is justified in believing P.\n    *   **Core Constraint:** The only available epistemic states (mental states regarding a proposition) are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This is a restrictive, artificial environment for analyzing the theory.\n    *   **Exclusion:** We must ignore Gettier problems, which are scenarios where a person has a JTB that, intuitively, doesn't seem to be knowledge (usually due to luck).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Impact of the Constraint:**\n    The core of the problem is to see how the restrictive environment of \"only Knowledge and Belief as states\" conflicts with the JTB definition `K = J + T + B`. We must analyze the components of JTB under this constraint.\n\n3.  **Finding Problem 1: The Issue with \"Justification\" (J)**\n    *   The JTB model requires \"Justification\" as a key component.\n    *   However, \"Justification\" is not listed as one of the two available epistemic states. Therefore, the state of being justified must be explainable in terms of \"Knowledge\" or \"Belief\".\n    *   **Scenario A: Justification is a Belief.** If the justification for a belief P is based on another belief Q, we must ask what justifies belief Q. This leads to an infinite regress, as each justifying belief requires another justifying belief. There is no ultimate foundation.\n    *   **Scenario B: Justification is Knowledge.** If the justification for believing P requires *knowing* the evidence Q, then the definition of knowledge becomes circular. The definition would be: \"To *know* P, you must *know* Q (your justification) and believe P, and P must be true.\" We are using the concept of Knowledge within its own definition. This is known as the problem of the criterion or epistemic circularity.\n    *   **Conclusion for Problem 1:** The \"Justification\" condition, when forced into the box of being either \"Knowledge\" or \"Belief\", renders the JTB definition either viciously regressive or logically circular.\n\n4.  **Finding Problem 2: The Issue with the Relationship between \"Belief\" (B) and \"Knowledge\" (K)**\n    *   The JTB definition asserts that Knowledge is a specific *type* of Belief. It is a belief that also has the properties of being true and justified. This means that Knowledge is a subset of Belief; if you know something, you inherently believe it (`K â†’ B`).\n    *   The constraint presents \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" as the two available epistemic states. This phrasing strongly suggests that they are distinct categories, implying that an agent's stance toward a proposition must be one *or* the other, but not both. That is, it suggests they are mutually exclusive.\n    *   **The Conflict:** Here lies a direct contradiction.\n        *   The JTB model's structure requires that Knowledge and Belief are *not* mutually exclusive. Having Knowledge entails having Belief.\n        *   The problem's constraint, by positing K and B as the two choices of state, implies they *are* mutually exclusive.\n    *   If the states are mutually exclusive, then if an agent is in the \"Knowledge\" state, they cannot be in the \"Belief\" state. But this violates the \"Belief\" condition of the JTB formula, making it impossible to ever satisfy the definition of Knowledge.\n    *   **Conclusion for Problem 2:** The JTB model's hierarchical structure (where K is a subset of B) is fundamentally incompatible with a system where \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" are presented as the two distinct, mutually exclusive epistemic states.\n\n---\n**Final Answer Derivations**\n\nBased on the analysis, the two primary problems for the JTB definition under the specified constraints are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Epistemic Circularity or Infinite Regress:** The \"Justification\" component is not an allowed state, so it must be grounded in either \"Belief\" (leading to an infinite regress) or \"Knowledge\" (leading to a circular definition).\n\n2.  **The Problem of Contradictory Exclusivity:** The JTB definition requires that Knowledge is a type of Belief (non-exclusive), but the constraint that these are the *only two* states implies they are mutually exclusive categories, making the JTB definition impossible to fulfill.\n\n<<<\nThe two problems that the JTB definition of knowledge runs into under these constraints are:\n\n1.  **Epistemic Circularity / Infinite Regress of Justification:** The JTB theory requires \"justification\". Since the only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, the justification for a belief must itself be based on either another Belief or on Knowledge.\n    *   If justification is based on another **Belief**, it leads to an infinite regress (i.e., what justifies that belief? And the next one?).\n    *   If justification is based on **Knowledge**, the definition of knowledge becomes circular (i.e., to know P, you must first know E, where E is your evidence). You are using \"knowledge\" to define itself.\n\n2.  **Contradiction of State Exclusivity:** The JTB definition states that knowledge is a *type* of belief (a belief that is also true and justified). This means if you have knowledge, you must also have belief. However, the constraint that \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" are the only two available epistemic states suggests they are distinct and mutually exclusive categories. This creates a contradiction: JTB requires that knowledge is a subset of belief, but the constraint implies an agent is either in the state of \"Knowledge\" or in the state of \"Belief\", but not both. If the states are mutually exclusive, the belief condition for knowledge could never be met."
