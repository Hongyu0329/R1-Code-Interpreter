The two problems that the JTB definition of knowledge runs into under these constraints are:

1.  **Epistemic Circularity / Infinite Regress of Justification:** The JTB theory requires "justification". Since the only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, the justification for a belief must itself be based on either another Belief or on Knowledge.
    *   If justification is based on another **Belief**, it leads to an infinite regress (i.e., what justifies that belief? And the next one?).
    *   If justification is based on **Knowledge**, the definition of knowledge becomes circular (i.e., to know P, you must first know E, where E is your evidence). You are using "knowledge" to define itself.

2.  **Contradiction of State Exclusivity:** The JTB definition states that knowledge is a *type* of belief (a belief that is also true and justified). This means if you have knowledge, you must also have belief. However, the constraint that "Knowledge" and "Belief" are the only two available epistemic states suggests they are distinct and mutually exclusive categories. This creates a contradiction: JTB requires that knowledge is a subset of belief, but the constraint implies an agent is either in the state of "Knowledge" or in the state of "Belief", but not both. If the states are mutually exclusive, the belief condition for knowledge could never be met.
