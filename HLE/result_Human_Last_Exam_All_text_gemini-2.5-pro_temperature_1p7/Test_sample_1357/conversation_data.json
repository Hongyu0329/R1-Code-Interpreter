    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the number of types of stable reductions of a genus 4 curve whose Jacobian has good reduction.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Conditions\n\nLet $C$ be a curve of genus $g=4$ defined over a valuation field $K$. Let $R$ be the valuation ring of $K$ and $k$ be its residue field.\n\n1.  **Stable Reduction:** By the Stable Reduction Theorem, after a possible finite extension of $K$, the curve $C$ admits a stable model $\\mathcal{C}$ over $R$. The special fiber $C_k = \\mathcal{C} \\times_R k$ is a stable curve of arithmetic genus $g=4$. A stable curve is a connected nodal curve with a finite automorphism group.\n\n2.  **Jacobian with Good Reduction:** The Jacobian variety $J(C)$ of the curve $C$ is an abelian variety of dimension $g=4$. The condition that $J(C)$ has good reduction means that its NÃ©ron model over $R$ has a special fiber that is an abelian variety.\n\n### Step 2: Translating the Conditions into Combinatorics\n\nThe structure of the special fiber $C_k$ of a semistable model is linked to the reduction of its Jacobian. Let $C_k$ be composed of irreducible components $C_1, \\ldots, C_n$. The combinatorial structure of how these components are connected is described by the **dual graph** $\\Gamma(C_k)$.\n*   Vertices of $\\Gamma(C_k)$ correspond to the components $C_i$.\n*   Edges of $\\Gamma(C_k)$ correspond to the nodes (double points) where different components intersect.\n\nThe theory of reduction of abelian varieties states that the Jacobian $J(C)$ has good reduction if and only if two conditions on the special fiber $C_k$ of the stable model are met:\n1.  The first Betti number of the dual graph is zero, i.e., $b_1(\\Gamma(C_k)) = 0$. This means the dual graph must be a **tree**.\n2.  The arithmetic genus of $C_k$ is the sum of the arithmetic genera of its components: $p_a(C_k) = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_a(C_i)$. Since $p_a(C_k)=g=4$, this translates to $\\sum_{i=1}^n p_a(C_i) = 4$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to a combinatorial one: to count the number of \"types\" of stable curves of genus 4 whose dual graph is a tree. A \"type\" is determined by the structure of the weighted dual graph $(T, \\{p_i\\})$, where $T$ is the tree, and the vertices are weighted by the arithmetic genera $p_i = p_a(C_i)$ of the components.\n\n### Step 3: Stability Conditions for Components\n\nFor the total curve $C_k$ to be stable, its components must satisfy certain stability conditions. Let a component $C_i$ have arithmetic genus $p_i = p_a(C_i)$ and be connected to $d_i$ other components (so its corresponding vertex in the tree has degree $d_i$). The stability conditions are:\n*   If $p_i=0$ (the component is a rational curve), it must have at least 3 special points (nodes connecting to other components). So, $d_i \\ge 3$.\n*   If $p_i=1$ (the component is an elliptic curve, or a rational curve with one node), it must have at least 1 special point. So, $d_i \\ge 1$.\n*   If $p_i > 1$, the component is stable on its own, so there's no condition on $d_i$ other than being part of the tree ($d_i \\ge 1$ if $n>1$).\n\n### Step 4: Enumerating the Types\n\nWe need to find the number of non-isomorphic weighted trees satisfying $\\sum p_i = 4$ and the stability conditions. We can classify these based on the multiset of arithmetic genera $\\{p_i\\}$ of the components.\n\nLet $m_P$ be the number of components with positive arithmetic genus ($p_i>0$), and $m_0$ be the number of components with zero arithmetic genus ($p_i=0$). A key insight is that any leaf of the tree (a vertex with degree 1) cannot have $p_i=0$. This leads to a useful inequality: $m_0 + 2 \\le m_P$.\n\n**Case 1: No rational components ($m_0=0$)**\nThe genera $\\{p_i\\}$ form a partition of 4 into positive integers.\n1.  **{4}**: 1 component, $p_1=4$. The tree is a single vertex. Trivial type. (**1 type**)\n2.  **{3,1}**: 2 components, $p_1=3, p_2=1$. The tree is an edge connecting them. Both vertices have degree 1. Stability is satisfied. (**1 type**)\n3.  **{2,2}**: 2 components, both $p=2$. Similar to the previous case. (**1 type**)\n4.  **{2,1,1}**: 3 components. The only tree is a path $v_1-v_2-v_3$.\n    *   $p(v_2)=2$, $p(v_1)=p(v_3)=1$. This is a valid configuration.\n    *   $p(v_1)=2$, $p(v_2)=p(v_3)=1$. Also a valid, but distinct configuration based on the position of the genus 2 component.\n    (**2 types**)\n5.  **{1,1,1,1}**: 4 components, all $p=1$. There are two trees on 4 vertices:\n    *   The path graph $P_4$. All vertices have degree $\\ge 1$, so it's a valid configuration.\n    *   The star graph $K_{1,3}$. All vertices have degree $\\ge 1$, also a valid configuration.\n    (**2 types**)\n\nTotal for $m_0=0$: $1+1+1+2+2 = 7$ types.\n\n**Case 2: With rational components ($m_0 > 0$)**\nWe check partitions of 4 that can support components with $p_i=0$, using the inequality $m_0+2 \\le m_P$.\n\n1.  **Positive genera partition {2,1,1}**: Here $m_P=3$. The inequality $m_0+2 \\le 3$ implies $m_0 \\le 1$. So we can have one rational component.\n    *   Genera set is {2,1,1,0}. Tree has 4 vertices. The $p=0$ vertex must have degree $\\ge 3$. In a 4-vertex tree, the only way is the star graph $K_{1,3}$, with the $p=0$ vertex at the center (degree 3). The leaves are the components with genera 2, 1, 1. This is a valid configuration. (**1 type**)\n\n2.  **Positive genera partition {1,1,1,1}**: Here $m_P=4$. The inequality $m_0+2 \\le 4$ implies $m_0 \\le 2$. We can have one or two rational components.\n    *   **One rational component ($m_0=1$)**: Genera set is {1,1,1,1,0}. Tree has 5 vertices. The $p=0$ vertex must have degree $\\ge 3$.\n        *   Tree is $K_{1,4}$ (star graph): $p=0$ vertex at the center (degree 4). The four $p=1$ components are leaves. This is valid. (**1 type**)\n        *   Tree has max degree 3: The only other 5-vertex tree with a node of degree $\\ge 3$ has degree sequence (3,2,1,1,1). The $p=0$ component is the vertex of degree 3. The other four $p=1$ components are placed on the remaining vertices. This is also a valid configuration. (**1 type**)\n    *   **Two rational components ($m_0=2$)**: Genera set is {1,1,1,1,0,0}. Tree has 6 vertices. Both $p=0$ vertices must have degree $\\ge 3$. The four $p=1$ vertices must be leaves. This forces a \"barbell\" structure where the two $p=0$ vertices are connected and each is connected to two $p=1$ leaves. Each $p=0$ vertex has degree 3. This is a valid configuration. (**1 type**)\n\n3.  **Other positive genera partitions**:\n    *   {4}, {3,1}, {2,2}: $m_P$ is 1 or 2. The inequality $m_0+2 \\le m_P$ shows $m_0$ must be 0. So no rational components possible.\n\n### Final Count\n\nSumming up all the identified types:\n*   Cases with no rational components ($m_0=0$): 7 types.\n*   Cases with rational components ($m_0 > 0$):\n    *   {2,1,1,0}: 1 type.\n    *   {1,1,1,1,0}: 2 types.\n    *   {1,1,1,1,0,0}: 1 type.\nTotal types with rational components = $1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\nThe total number of types of stable reductions is $7 + 4 = 11$."
