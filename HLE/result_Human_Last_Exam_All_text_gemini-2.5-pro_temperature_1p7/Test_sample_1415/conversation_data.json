    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the functions**\n\nFirst, let's write down the explicit form of the function `F₃(x)` by composing the given functions:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integrand**\n\nThe question asks to evaluate the definite integral:\nV = ∫[from 0 to 1] (F₃'(x) / F₃(x)) dx\n\nThe integrand is in the form `f'(x) / f(x)`, where `f(x) = F₃(x)`. This is a standard integral form known as the logarithmic derivative.\n\n**Step 3: Find the antiderivative**\n\nThe antiderivative of `f'(x) / f(x)` can be found using a u-substitution.\nLet `u = f(x)`. Then `du = f'(x) dx`.\nThe integral becomes ∫ (1/u) du = ln|u| + C.\nSubstituting back `u = f(x)`, the antiderivative is `ln|f(x)|`.\nIn our case, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the definite integral**\n\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate the definite integral:\nV = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\n**Step 5: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\n\nWe need to calculate the values of the function `F₃(x)` at the limits of integration, x=0 and x=1.\n\n*   **At x = 0:**\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))`\n    Since `sin(0) = 0` and `e^0 = 1`,\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n*   **At x = 1:**\n    `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    (Here, `sin(1)` is sine of 1 radian).\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the values into the integral result**\n\nNow we substitute these values back into the expression for V.\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\nV = ln|ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))| - ln|ln(2)|\n\n**Careful Point: Check the signs of the terms to handle the absolute value.**\n*   `ln(2)` is approximately 0.693, which is positive. So `|ln(2)| = ln(2)`.\n*   For `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`:\n    *   `sin(1)` (in radians) is approx. 0.841.\n    *   `e^(sin(1))` is approx. `e^0.841` which is approx. 2.319. This is greater than 1.\n    *   `1 + e^(sin(1))` is approx. 3.319.\n    *   `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` is approx. `ln(3.319)` which is approx. 1.2. This is also positive.\n*   Since both `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` are positive, we can remove the absolute value bars.\n    V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n    V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can simplify this to:\nV = ln[ (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / ln(2) ]\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final numerical value**\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation for V.\n1.  `sin(1)` ≈ 0.84147098\n2.  `e^(sin(1))` ≈ `e^0.84147098` ≈ 2.3197706\n3.  `1 + e^(sin(1))` ≈ 3.3197706\n4.  `ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` ≈ ln(3.3197706) ≈ 1.2001601\n5.  `ln(2)` ≈ 0.6931472\n6.  The ratio `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2)` ≈ 1.2001601 / 0.6931472 ≈ 1.7314545\n7.  V = ln(1.7314545) ≈ 0.5489815\n\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.5489815 = 5489.815\n\nThe closest integer to 5489.815 is 5490.\n\n<<<5490>>>"
