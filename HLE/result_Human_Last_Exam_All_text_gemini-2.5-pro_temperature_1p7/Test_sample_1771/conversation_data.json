    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical linguistic development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb *seh₂gieti.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Starting Point:** We begin with the PIE 3rd person singular present tense verb *seh₂g-ie-ti.\n2.  **Root and Meaning:** The root is *seh₂g-, meaning 'to track, perceive, seek out'. This is supported by the cognates provided: Hittite *sākizzi* '(s)he gives a sign/omen' and Latin *sāgīre* 'to perceive acutely, be keen-nosed'.\n3.  **Grammatical Form:** The suffix *-ie-* marks it as a *ye/yo*-present, and the ending *-ti* marks it as a 3rd person singular active indicative.\n4.  **Target Languages:** We need to find the reflex (the evolved form) of this specific PIE word in Proto-Germanic (PGmc), Old Norse (ON), Old English (OE), and Old High German (OHG).\n\n### Careful Points and Sound Laws\n\nTo trace the development, we must apply a series of well-established sound laws that govern the transition from PIE to Proto-Germanic and from Proto-Germanic to its daughter languages.\n\n*   **Grimm's Law:** A set of changes affecting PIE stop consonants in Proto-Germanic. For this root, it means PIE voiced stop *g* becomes a PGmc voiceless stop *k*.\n*   **Laryngeal Theory:** The PIE consonant *h₂* (\"a-coloring laryngeal\") colors an adjacent *e*-vowel to an *a*-vowel before the laryngeal is lost. The sequence *eh₂* before a consonant typically becomes a long vowel.\n*   **Germanic Vowel Shifts:** PIE vowels underwent systematic changes. Notably for this problem, PIE *ā* (from *eh₂*) becomes PGmc *ō* in most dialects (except Gothic).\n*   **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** A key phonological process in the daughter languages where a vowel in a root syllable is fronted or raised when an /i/ or /j/ sound occurs in the following syllable. This is crucial because the PIE suffix *-ie-* becomes PGmc *-ija-*, providing the trigger for umlaut.\n*   **Palatalization:** A process specific to Old English (and Frisian) where velar consonants like *k* and *g* become palatal affricates or glides when next to front vowels.\n*   **High German Consonant Shift:** A series of changes distinguishing Old High German from other West Germanic languages. For this problem, it means PGmc *k* becomes the fricative *hh* (/xː/) and the ending dental fricative *þ* becomes the stop *t*.\n*   **Verb Classification:** A PIE *ye/yo*-present verb regularly becomes a Class 1 weak verb in Germanic. These verbs form their past tense with a dental suffix and are characterized by the stem-forming suffix *-ija-* in the present tense.\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**Step 1: From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\n1.  **Root:** Start with PIE *seh₂g-.\n2.  **Laryngeal Effect:** The *h₂* colors the preceding *e* to *a*. It then disappears, lengthening the vowel: *seh₂g-* → Pre-Germanic *sāg-. The Latin cognate *sāgīre* confirms this long *ā*.\n3.  **Grimm's Law:** The PIE voiced stop *g* becomes the PGmc voiceless stop *k*. So, *sāg-* → *sāk-.\n4.  **Vowel Shift:** In non-Gothic Germanic dialects, PIE *ā* becomes PGmc *ō*. So, *sāk-* → **PGmc *sōk-**.\n5.  **Verb Formation:** The PIE present suffix *-ie-* becomes the PGmc Class 1 weak verb suffix *-ija-*. The 3rd person singular ending PIE *-ti* becomes PGmc *-þi* (via Grimm's Law: *t* → *þ*).\n6.  **Combining:** We combine the root *sōk-* with the suffix elements: *sōk-i-þi*. The *i* here is the thematic vowel from the *-ija-* suffix, which triggers I-Umlaut in the daughter languages.\n7.  **Final Proto-Germanic Form:** **\\*sōkīþ(i)**. (The infinitive form would be *\\*sōkijaną*, which is the attested source for 'to seek' in these languages).\n\n**Step 2: From Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **Start with:** PGmc *\\*sōkīþ(i)*.\n2.  **I-Umlaut:** The *i* in the suffix causes I-Umlaut of the root vowel *ō*. In Old Norse, *ō* becomes *œ*. So, *sōk-* → *sœk-*.\n3.  **Ending:** The 3rd person singular present indicative ending in Old Norse becomes *-r*. The historical path is complex, but the outcome is regular (e.g., PGmc *\\*haubidiþi* → ON *heyfir*).\n4.  **Stem Vowel:** The medial *-ī-* is retained.\n5.  **Combining:** *sœk* + *-i-* + *-r* → *sœkir*.\n6.  **Final Old Norse Form:** **\\*sœkir**\n\n**Step 3: From Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **Start with:** PGmc *\\*sōkīþ(i)*.\n2.  **I-Umlaut:** The *i* causes I-Umlaut of the root vowel *ō*. In Old English, *ō* becomes *ē*. So, *sōk-* → *sēc-*. After causing the umlaut, the medial *-i-* is lost.\n3.  **Palatalization:** The resulting front vowel *ē* causes the preceding PGmc *k* to palatalize into the affricate *ċ* (/tʃ/). So, *sēc-* → *sēċ-*.\n4.  **Ending:** The PGmc ending *-þ* is retained.\n5.  **Combining:** *sēċ-* + *-þ* → *sēċþ*.\n6.  **Final Old English Form:** **\\*sēċþ** (West Saxon dialect).\n\n**Step 4: From Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **Start with:** PGmc *\\*sōkīþ(i)*.\n2.  **Vowel Shift:** The PGmc vowel *ō* becomes *uo* in Old High German. So *sōk-* → *suoh-*.\n3.  **I-Umlaut:** The *i* in the suffix causes I-Umlaut of *uo*, resulting in *üo*. However, this sound change was often not represented in early OHG spelling, so the digraph *uo* is commonly written.\n4.  **High German Consonant Shift:**\n    *   The PGmc consonant *k* shifts to the geminate fricative *hh* (/xx/) medially and finally. So *suoh-* → *suohh-*.\n    *   The PGmc ending *-þ* becomes the stop *t*.\n5.  **Stem and Ending:** The PGmc sequence *-īþ(i)* becomes *-it* in OHG for Class 1 weak verbs.\n6.  **Combining:** *suohh-* + *-it* → *suohhit*.\n7.  **Final Old High German Form:** **\\*suohhit**\n\n### Summary of Results\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *\\*sōkīþ*\n*   **Old Norse:** *\\*sœkir*\n*   **Old English:** *\\*sēċþ*\n*   **Old High German:** *\\*suohhit*\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *\\*sōkīþ*, Old Norse: *\\*sœkir*, Old English: *\\*sēċþ*, Old High German: *\\*suohhit*>>>"
