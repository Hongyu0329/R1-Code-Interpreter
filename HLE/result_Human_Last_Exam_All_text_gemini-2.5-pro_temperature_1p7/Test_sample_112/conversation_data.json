    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific text that falls into the genre of a \"book of manners\" and was physically preserved in the same manuscript as the poem \"Sir Launfal\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Key Elements**\n*   **\"Sir Launfal\":** This is the primary subject. It's crucial to identify which version of the \"Sir Launfal\" story is being referenced. In the context of medieval manuscripts, this almost certainly refers to the Middle English romance written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century, not the earlier French *lai* by Marie de France or the later 19th-century poem by James Russell Lowell.\n*   **\"Book of manners\":** This refers to a specific genre of medieval literature, also known as a courtesy book. These texts provided instructions on etiquette, social conduct, morality, and often the specific duties of squires, pages, and other members of a noble household.\n*   **\"Preserved alongside\":** This phrase implies that the two works were part of the same physical document, most likely a codex or manuscript collection. This means we need to find the specific manuscript that contains Thomas Chestre's \"Sir Launfal\".\n\n**Step 3: Research and Locate the Manuscript**\n*   Research shows that Thomas Chestre's romance, *Sir Launfal*, survives in only one single manuscript.\n*   This unique manuscript is identified as **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, which is now part of the collection in the British Library. It is a famous and important miscellany (a collection of various texts) from the mid-15th century.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Contents of the Manuscript**\n*   To find what was \"preserved alongside\" *Sir Launfal*, we must examine the list of contents for Cotton MS Caligula A.ii.\n*   This manuscript contains a variety of significant Middle English works, including romances like *Floris and Blancheflour* and historical texts like Layamon's *Brut*.\n*   When we scan the table of contents for this manuscript, we find a specific text that perfectly fits the description of a \"book of manners\".\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Book of Manners**\n*   Within Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, there is a poem known as **_The Boke of Curtasye_** (or, in modern spelling, *The Book of Courtesy*).\n*   This text is a classic example of a medieval courtesy book. It provides detailed rules on proper behavior, particularly focusing on table manners and the duties of servants in a great lord's house.\n*   Since both *Sir Launfal* and *The Boke of Curtasye* are contained within the same manuscript (Cotton MS Caligula A.ii), it is the correct answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Distinguish between different \"Sir Launfal\" stories:** It's essential not to confuse Thomas Chestre's poem with others of the same name to ensure the correct manuscript is identified. The context of a medieval \"book of manners\" points directly to Chestre.\n2.  **Understand the term \"manuscript\":** The texts were not published as separate books but were hand-copied together into a single volume or codex. The owner or compiler of the manuscript chose which texts to include, often based on a theme.\n3.  **Recognize the genre:** Knowing what a \"book of manners\" or \"courtesy book\" is helps in identifying the correct title from the manuscript's list of contents. Titles like *The Boke of Curtasye* are clear indicators of the genre.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBy following the steps above, we have established:\n1.  The relevant \"Sir Launfal\" is by Thomas Chestre.\n2.  It is found in the manuscript Cotton MS Caligula A.ii.\n3.  This manuscript also contains a courtesy book, a \"book of manners\".\n4.  The title of that book is *The Boke of Curtasye*.\n\nTherefore, the book of manners Sir Launfal was preserved alongside is *The Boke of Curtasye*.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye (The Book of Courtesy)>>>"
