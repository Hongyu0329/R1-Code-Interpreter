    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to find the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum ($\\Delta p$) to its actual momentum ($p$) when the electron is in the first Bohr orbit (n=1).\n\n**2. Identify Given Information**\n*   The electron is in the **first Bohr orbit**, so the principal quantum number $n = 1$.\n*   The uncertainty in the electron's position is $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$ ($1 \\text{ pm} = 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$).\n\n**3. Identify Required Physical Principles**\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** This principle connects the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) and the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$). The mathematical relation is $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant ($\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J} \\cdot \\text{s}$).\n*   **Bohr Model of the Atom:** This model provides a way to calculate the momentum ($p$) of an electron in a specific orbit. The key postulate is that the angular momentum ($L$) of the electron is quantized: $L = n\\hbar$.\n\n**4. Plan the Calculation**\n*   **Part A:** Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$) using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the given $\\Delta x$.\n*   **Part B:** Calculate the momentum ($p$) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit using the principles of the Bohr model.\n*   **Part C:** Calculate the final ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n\n### **Execution of the Plan**\n\n**Part A: Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$)**\n1.  Start with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n2.  To find the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n3.  Rearrange the formula to solve for $\\Delta p$:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\n**Part B: Calculate the Momentum ($p$) in the First Bohr Orbit**\n1.  From the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized: $L = n\\hbar$.\n2.  The definition of angular momentum is $L = mvr = pr$, where $p$ is the linear momentum and $r$ is the radius of the orbit.\n3.  Combining these, we get $pr = n\\hbar$.\n4.  For the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$, and the radius is the Bohr radius, $r_1 = a_0 \\approx 52.9 \\text{ pm}$.\n5.  So, for the first orbit, $p \\cdot r_1 = (1)\\hbar$.\n6.  Rearrange to solve for $p$:\n    $p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}$\n\n**Part C: Calculate the Ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$**\n1.  Set up the ratio using the expressions from Part A and Part B:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}}$\n2.  Simplify the expression. The $\\hbar$ terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x} \\cdot \\frac{r_1}{\\hbar} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n3.  Substitute the known values into the simplified formula:\n    *   $r_1$ (Bohr radius) = $52.9 \\text{ pm}$\n    *   $\\Delta x$ (given position uncertainty) = $10 \\text{ pm}$\n4.  Calculate the final ratio:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{52.9 \\text{ pm}}{2 \\times 10 \\text{ pm}} = \\frac{52.9}{20}$\n5.  $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = 2.645$\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Choice of Uncertainty Formula:** The Heisenberg principle is an inequality ($\\geq$). By using the equality $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, we are calculating the *minimum possible* uncertainty in momentum, which is the standard interpretation for this type of problem.\n2.  **Constants:** It's important to use the correct values for physical constants. The radius of the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$) is the Bohr radius, $a_0 \\approx 52.9 \\text{ pm}$.\n3.  **Units:** The simplification in Part C, where $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$, is very helpful. It shows that as long as the units for $r_1$ and $\\Delta x$ are the same (in this case, both are in picometers), they will cancel out, and we don't need to convert them to meters. This reduces the chance of conversion errors.\n4.  **Concept:** The final ratio is greater than 1, which means the uncertainty in the electron's momentum is larger than the momentum itself. This highlights a fundamental conflict between the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the Bohr model's concept of well-defined orbits and momenta.\n\n### **Final Answer Calculation**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis:\nRatio = $\\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x} = \\frac{52.9}{2 \\times 10} = \\frac{52.9}{20} = 2.645$\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
