    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph.\n\n### **Step 1: Defining the Graph Structure**\n\n1.  **Barbell Graph:** The problem considers a barbell graph with a total of $N=10$ nodes. A standard barbell graph is constructed from two identical complete graphs (cliques) that are connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the \"bottleneck edge\" or \"bridge\".\n2.  **Clique Size:** Since there are 10 nodes in total, the graph consists of two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (two $K_5$ cliques).\n3.  **Node and Edge Identification:** Let's name the two cliques $C_A$ and $C_B$. Let the bottleneck edge be $e_{b}$, connecting node $u \\in C_A$ to node $v \\in C_B$.\n\n### **Step 2: Understanding the Sampling Process (Randomized Uniform Gossiping)**\n\nThe process of \"randomized uniform gossiping\" for sampling an edge in a graph involves two sequential steps:\n\n1.  **Node Selection:** A node is chosen uniformly at random from the entire set of $N=10$ nodes. The probability of picking any specific node is $1/N = 1/10$.\n2.  **Neighbor Selection:** The initially selected node then chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to form an edge for gossiping. If the selected node is $x$ and its degree (number of neighbors) is $d(x)$, the probability that it selects a particular neighbor $y$ is $1/d(x)$.\n\nThe \"sampled edge\" is the edge connecting the initially chosen node and its subsequently chosen neighbor.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculating Node Degrees**\n\nTo calculate the probability, we need the degrees of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge, $u$ and $v$.\n\n1.  **Degree of Node `u`:** Node $u$ is part of the complete graph $C_A$ ($K_5$). This means it is connected to the other $4$ nodes within its clique. In addition, it is connected to node $v$ via the bottleneck edge.\n    *   Degree of $u$, $d(u) = (\\text{connections within } C_A) + (\\text{connection to } C_B) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n2.  **Degree of Node `v`:** Similarly, node $v$ is part of the complete graph $C_B$ ($K_5$) and is connected to the other $4$ nodes within its clique. It is also connected to node $u$.\n    *   Degree of $v$, $d(v) = (\\text{connections within } C_B) + (\\text{connection to } C_A) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n\n### **Step 4: Calculating the Sampling Probability for the Bottleneck Edge**\n\nThe bottleneck edge $e_b = (u,v)$ can be sampled in one of two mutually exclusive ways:\n*   **Scenario A:** Node $u$ is chosen first, and then it chooses its neighbor $v$.\n*   **Scenario B:** Node $v$ is chosen first, and then it chooses its neighbor $u$.\n\nLet's calculate the probability for each scenario:\n\n1.  **Probability of Scenario A:**\n    *   The probability of selecting node $u$ initially is $P(u) = 1/N = 1/10$.\n    *   Given that $u$ was selected, the probability that it chooses neighbor $v$ is $P(v|u) = 1/d(u) = 1/5$.\n    *   The total probability of Scenario A is $P(A) = P(u) \\times P(v|u) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\n2.  **Probability of Scenario B:**\n    *   The probability of selecting node $v$ initially is $P(v) = 1/N = 1/10$.\n    *   Given that $v$ was selected, the probability that it chooses neighbor $u$ is $P(u|v) = 1/d(v) = 1/5$.\n    *   The total probability of Scenario B is $P(B) = P(v) \\times P(u|v) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{50}$.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two scenarios:\n$P(\\text{sample } e_b) = P(A) + P(B) = \\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{2}{50} = \\frac{1}{25}$.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe probability expressed as a decimal is $1/25 = 0.04$.\n\n<<<0.04>>>"
