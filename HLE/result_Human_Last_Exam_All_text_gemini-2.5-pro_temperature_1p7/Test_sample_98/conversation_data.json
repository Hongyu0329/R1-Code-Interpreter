    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Icosahedron**\nAn icosahedron is a regular polyhedron, meaning all of its faces are identical regular polygons, and the same number of faces meet at each vertex. Specifically:\n*   It has 20 faces, each being an equilateral triangle.\n*   It has 30 edges and 12 vertices.\n*   A key property of a regular icosahedron is that it has a high degree of symmetry, including a center of symmetry (or inversion center). This means for any point within the icosahedron, there is a corresponding point at the same distance on the opposite side of the center.\n*   The icosahedron also has opposite faces that are parallel to each other.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Orientation of the Tank**\nThe problem states the icosahedron tank is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of the triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base of the tank.\n*   Because the icosahedron has parallel opposite faces, the face directly opposite the base will be at the top and will also be horizontal.\n*   The vertical line passing through the centers of the top and bottom faces is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the \"Half-Filled\" Condition**\nThe tank is \"half-filled with water,\" which means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   The surface of the water will be a horizontal plane.\n*   Because the icosahedron has a center of symmetry, any plane passing through this center divides the icosahedron's volume into two equal halves.\n*   Therefore, the horizontal water surface must be the plane that passes through the exact geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Shape of the Water Surface**\nThe question asks for the shape of the water surface. This is the shape of the cross-section created by slicing the icosahedron with a horizontal plane through its center.\n*   The icosahedron is oriented with a 3-fold symmetry axis being vertical. Any horizontal cross-section must respect this symmetry. Therefore, the shape of the water surface must have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   The cutting plane passes through the center of symmetry of the icosahedron. This implies that the resulting 2D cross-section must also have a center of symmetry (i.e., it is unchanged by a 180-degree rotation in its plane).\n*   A polygon that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and a center of symmetry must have 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   When this central plane cuts the icosahedron, it does not pass through any vertices. It intersects a set of edges that form the \"waist\" or \"equator\" of the icosahedron in this orientation. There are 6 such edges.\n*   The intersection of the plane with the faces of the icosahedron forms a six-sided polygon (a hexagon).\n*   Since this hexagon must have 6-fold rotational symmetry, all its sides must be of equal length, and all its interior angles must be equal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA polygon with six equal sides and six equal angles is a regular hexagon. Therefore, the shape of the water surface is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<a regular hexagon>>>"
