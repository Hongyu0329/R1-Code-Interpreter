    "This is a 3D packing problem. We need to find the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit into a 15x15x15 cube.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Initial Estimate**\n- We have a large cube with edge length 15. Its volume is `15 * 15 * 15 = 3375` cubic units.\n- We have small blocks (cuboids) with dimensions 9x1x1. Their volume is `9 * 1 * 1 = 9` cubic units.\n- A simple division of volumes gives a theoretical upper limit: `Volume of Cube / Volume of Block = 3375 / 9 = 375`.\n- This number assumes no empty space, which is often impossible in packing problems due to dimensional constraints. We must find a physical arrangement to determine the actual maximum.\n\n**Step 2: Simple Packing Strategy (and why it's not optimal)**\nLet's consider placing all blocks with their length of 9 parallel to one axis, for instance, the X-axis.\n- Along the X-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 9) = 1` block.\n- Along the Y-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 1) = 15` blocks.\n- Along the Z-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 1) = 15` blocks.\n- Total blocks = `1 * 15 * 15 = 225`.\nThis arrangement leaves a large empty space of `(15-9) x 15 x 15 = 6x15x15`. Clearly, we can use this space by orienting blocks differently. This shows that a single-orientation strategy is not enough.\n\n**Step 3: A More Advanced Packing Strategy using Partitioning**\nThe key to better packing is to use all three possible orientations for the blocks and to partition the cube space efficiently. The dimensions of the cube (15) and the block (9) suggest that a partition based on these numbers would be effective. Let's split the `15x15x15` cube based on the main block dimension, 9.\n\n1.  **First Partition:** We divide the `15x15x15` cube into two rectangular prisms (cuboids):\n    *   **Cuboid A:** `9x15x15`\n    *   **Cuboid B:** `6x15x15` (This is the leftover space)\n\n2.  **Packing Cuboid A (9x15x15):**\n    We can perfectly fill this cuboid. We align the 9-unit length of the blocks with the 9-unit edge of the cuboid.\n    *   Number of blocks along the 9-unit edge: `9 / 9 = 1`\n    *   Number of blocks along the 15-unit edge: `15 / 1 = 15`\n    *   Number of blocks along the other 15-unit edge: `15 / 1 = 15`\n    *   Total blocks in Cuboid A = `1 * 15 * 15 = 225` blocks.\n\n3.  **Packing Cuboid B (6x15x15):**\n    Now we must pack the remaining `6x15x15` space. The blocks are `9x1x1`. Since the smallest dimension of this cuboid is 6, we cannot place the 9-unit length of the blocks along it. We must align the length 9 along one of the two 15-unit edges.\n    *   Let's partition Cuboid B further. We can take a `6x9x15` slice from it.\n    *   **Packing the `6x9x15` part of Cuboid B:** We align the 9-unit length of the blocks with the 9-unit edge of this new slice.\n        *   Number of blocks along the 6-unit edge: `6 / 1 = 6`\n        *   Number of blocks along the 9-unit edge: `9 / 9 = 9`\n        *   Number of blocks along the 15-unit edge: `15 / 1 = 15`\n        *   Total blocks = `6 * 1 * 15 = 90` blocks.\n    *   After filling this part, the remaining space from Cuboid B is `6x(15-9)x15 = 6x6x15`. Let's call this Cuboid C.\n\n4.  **Packing Cuboid C (6x6x15):**\n    We now pack the `6x6x15` space. Again, the 9-unit length of the blocks must be aligned with the 15-unit edge.\n    *   Number of blocks along the 6-unit edge: `6 / 1 = 6`\n    *   Number of blocks along the other 6-unit edge: `6 / 1 = 6`\n    *   Number of blocks along the 15-unit edge: `floor(15 / 9) = 1`\n    *   Total blocks in Cuboid C = `6 * 6 * 1 = 36` blocks.\n    *   These blocks occupy a `6x6x9` volume within Cuboid C.\n\n5.  **Final Wasted Space:**\n    After placing the 36 blocks in Cuboid C, the remaining empty space is `6x6x(15-9) = 6x6x6`.\n    A `9x1x1` block cannot fit into a `6x6x6` cube, because its longest side (9) is greater than any dimension of the cube (6). So this space is waste.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Blocks**\nBy summing the blocks from each packed section, we get the total number of blocks that can fit.\n- From Cuboid A (`9x15x15`): 225 blocks\n- From Cuboid B (`6x9x15` part): 90 blocks\n- From Cuboid C (`6x6x9` part): 36 blocks\n\n**Total = 225 + 90 + 36 = 351**\n\nThis construction shows that 351 blocks can fit. Alternative partitions, such as centering a `9x9x9` cube within the `15x15x15` cube, also yield the same result of 351 blocks and a total wasted volume of `216` cubic units (equivalent to a `6x6x6` cube), which strengthens the conclusion that this is the maximum possible number.\n\n<<<351>>>"
