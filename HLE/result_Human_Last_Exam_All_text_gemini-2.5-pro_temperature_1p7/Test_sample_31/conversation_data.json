    "On a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, when solving using the CFOP method, the final step is PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer). At this stage, the top face colors are all correctly oriented (e.g., all yellow stickers are facing up), but the side pieces of that layer are not yet in their final positions. There are 21 possible permutations, including the solved state. The task is to determine the minimum number of side stickers one must observe to uniquely identify which of the 21 PLL cases is presented.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine this number:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Constraints**\nThe goal is to find the minimum number of stickers required to differentiate all 21 PLL cases. This number must be sufficient for the \"worst-case scenario\"â€”the case that is most difficult to distinguish from others. We are only looking at the non-top-facing stickers of the last layer (the 4 side-facing edge stickers and 8 side-facing corner stickers, for a total of 12).\n\n**Step 2: How PLLs are Recognized**\nSpeedcubers don't look at random stickers; they recognize patterns. The most common patterns are:\n*   **Blocks:** A corner piece and an adjacent edge piece that are correctly solved relative to each other (their side stickers on one face match). A 1x2 block requires seeing 2 stickers. A 1x3 bar (a fully solved side) requires seeing 3 stickers.\n*   **Headlights:** Two corner pieces on the same face show the same color on their side stickers. For example, on the front face, the front-facing stickers of the top-left and top-right corners are both orange. This requires seeing 2 stickers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze \"Easy\" Cases**\nMany PLL cases can be identified by looking at a small number of stickers.\n*   **U-Perm:** Recognized by a fully solved 1x3 bar on one side. Seeing this bar (3 stickers) and one edge sticker on the opposite face to determine the direction of the cycle (1 sticker) is enough. Total: 4 stickers.\n*   **Y-Perm:** Recognized by a single pair of headlights. Seeing the headlights (2 stickers) and the sticker on the opposite edge to confirm it's an opposite-edge swap (1 sticker) is sufficient. Total: 3 stickers.\n*   **T-Perm:** Recognized by headlights on one face and a 1x2 block on the opposite face. Seeing the headlights (2 stickers) and the block (2 stickers) uniquely identifies it. Total: 4 stickers.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the \"Hardest\" Cases (G-Perms and N-Perms)**\nThe cases that are most similar to each other will require the most information to tell apart. The G-perms and N-perms are famously the most complex to recognize.\n\n*   **Analysis of G-Permutations:**\n    *   There are four different G-perms. They are all recognized by a signature pattern: a 1x2 block on one face and a pair of headlights on an *adjacent* face.\n    *   To confirm the presence of the 1x2 block, you must observe **2 stickers** (one corner, one edge).\n    *   To confirm the presence of the headlights on an adjacent face, you must observe **2 stickers** (the two corners on that face).\n    *   At this point, you have seen **4 stickers**. This confirms you have a G-perm, but it's not enough to know *which* of the four it is. This 4-sticker pattern narrows the possibilities down to a pair of G-perms (e.g., Ga vs. Gc, or Gb vs. Gd).\n    *   To make the final distinction between the remaining two possibilities, you must look at one more specific sticker. A common method is to check the color of the \"other\" side-sticker of the corner that forms part of the block. This is **1 more sticker**.\n    *   Therefore, identifying the most difficult G-perms requires a total of 2 + 2 + 1 = **5 stickers**.\n\n*   **Analysis of N-Permutations (for confirmation):**\n    *   There are two N-perms. They are recognized by having headlights on two *opposite* faces (e.g., Front and Back). The H-perm is similar, having headlights on all four faces.\n    *   To see the headlights on the Front face requires **2 stickers**.\n    *   To see the headlights on the Back face requires **2 stickers**.\n    *   Seeing this 4-sticker pattern confirms it's an N-perm (and not an H-perm, which would also have headlights on the sides). However, this doesn't distinguish between Na and Nb.\n    *   The two N-perms differ in how they cycle the edges. To distinguish them, one must observe the sticker of at least one edge piece to see where it needs to go. This is **1 more sticker**.\n    *   This analysis also results in a total of 2 + 2 + 1 = **5 stickers**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nSince the worst-case scenarios (distinguishing between specific G-perms or N-perms) require seeing 5 non-top-facing stickers, this is the minimum number that one *must* be prepared to see to guarantee identification of any given PLL case. While many cases require fewer, the question asks for the number that is sufficient for all of them.\n\n<<<5>>>"
