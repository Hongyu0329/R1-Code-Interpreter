    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Musical Piece and Section**\nThe question concerns Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". We need to look at the very end of the symphony, which is the final measure of the fourth movement (Allegro con fuoco).\n\n**Step 2: Locate the First Violin Part in the Score**\nIn a standard orchestral score, the first violin part (\"Violino I\") is located at the top of the string section, just below the woodwinds and brass. We must analyze the very last note(s) written for this specific instrument.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Final Notes**\nUpon examining the score, we find that the symphony concludes with a powerful B-flat major chord played by the full orchestra. The first violin section does not play three notes one after another (melodically). Instead, it plays a three-note chord simultaneously to contribute to the final harmony. This is a common technique known as a triple stop or, more likely in a section, having the players divide the notes among themselves (divisi).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Pitches of the Three Notes**\nThe three notes that make up this final chord in the first violin part are the notes of the B-flat major triad. They are:\n*   **B♭3** (The B-flat just below Middle C)\n*   **D4** (The D just above Middle C)\n*   **F4** (The F in the first octave above Middle C)\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Notes to Find the Lowest One**\nTo find the lowest of these three notes, we compare their positions on the musical staff and their respective frequencies.\n*   F4 is the highest.\n*   D4 is in the middle.\n*   **B♭3** is the lowest of the three notes.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **\"Three notes\":** It's important to understand this refers to a three-note chord played at once, not three sequential notes.\n*   **Instrument:** The analysis must be strictly limited to the first violin part, not the entire orchestra.\n*   **Octave:** Simply identifying the note as \"B-flat\" isn't sufficient without context. Comparing the specific pitches (B♭3, D4, F4) confirms that the B-flat is the lowest in the chord.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe three final notes are B♭3, D4, and F4. By comparing their pitches, the lowest one is B-flat.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
