    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** The question provides several key pieces of information about a person referred to as \"HE\" and \"HIS work,\" based on an interpretation by \"Veronika Campan.\"\n    *   **The Work:** The work in question involves a list of prohibitions.\n    *   **Clue 1: \"separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions.\"** This strongly suggests one of the Ten Commandments, specifically the one that states, \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house... or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" The word \"separately\" is a crucial detail.\n    *   **Clue 2: \"at the end of HIS work.\"** The commandment against coveting is the last one in the Decalogue (the Ten Commandments). This aligns with the first clue.\n    *   **Clue 3: \"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\"** \"Prohibition against representation\" refers to the commandment against making graven images or idols (\"You shall not make for yourself an idol...\"). The clue suggests that in order to structure the list in a certain way, the person (\"HE\") had to treat this specific prohibition differently, effectively merging it with another one.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Context:** The clues point directly to the historical debate over the numbering and grouping of the Ten Commandments. There are several different traditions (Jewish, Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant). The prompt describes a very specific system.\n\n3.  **Identify the System:** Let's analyze the system described:\n    *   To \"separately\" address material possessions, the final commandment against coveting must be split into two. This is characteristic of the Catholic and Lutheran traditions, which list the Ninth Commandment as \"You shall not covet your neighbor's wife\" and the Tenth Commandment as \"You shall not covet your neighbor's goods\" (i.e., material possessions).\n    *   How is this 10-commandment structure achieved if the last one is split in two? It must be balanced by combining two commandments at the beginning. The prompt states this was done by \"ignoring the prohibition against representation.\" This is exactly what this system does: it combines the prohibition against having other gods with the prohibition against making graven images/representations into a single First Commandment.\n\n4.  **Identify the Originator (\"HE\"):** This specific numbering scheme for the Decalogue was most famously formulated and popularized by a highly influential Church Father in his theological writings. He created this structure, which differed from the earlier Jewish division established by Philo and Josephus.\n\n5.  **Name the Person:** The theologian who established this system is Saint Augustine of Hippo. His structuring of the Ten Commandments, laid out in his *Questions on Exodus*, became standard for the Western Catholic Church.\n\n6.  **Determine the \"Full Name\":** The question asks for HIS \"full name.\" Saint Augustine of Hippo's full name at birth was **Aurelius Augustinus**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The key is realizing the question is about the *numbering system* of the Ten Commandments, not just their content.\n*   The phrase \"ignoring the prohibition against representation\" means treating it not as a standalone commandment but as part of another (the First).\n*   The phrase \"separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions\" refers to splitting the commandment against coveting into two, with the final one dealing exclusively with goods and property.\n*   The reference to \"Veronika Campan\" is a modern scholarly source likely used to frame the riddle, confirming that this is a subject of academic theological interpretation. The interpretation itself, however, is ancient.\n*   The person responsible for this influential structure is Augustine of Hippo. His full Latin name is the most complete answer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the person who created the structure of the Ten Commandments described in the prompt is Augustine of Hippo. His full name is Aurelius Augustinus.\n\n<<<Aurelius Augustinus>>>"
