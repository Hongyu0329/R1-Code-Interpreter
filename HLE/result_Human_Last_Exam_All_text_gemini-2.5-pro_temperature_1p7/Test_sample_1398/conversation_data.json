    "This problem asks us to find a transformation rule that maps an input binary grid to an output binary grid, based on five examples, and then apply this rule to a sixth input grid.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Hypothesis: Simple Cellular Automata Rule.** A common type of grid transformation rule is a cellular automaton, where the output value of a cell `(r, c)`, denoted `O(r, c)`, depends on its input value `I(r, c)` and the values of its neighboring cells. We can define a neighborhood, for example, the 8 surrounding cells (Moore neighborhood) or the 4 orthogonal cells (von Neumann neighborhood).\n\n2.  **Exploring Neighborhood Definitions.**\n    *   **Moore Neighborhood (8 neighbors):** Let's hypothesize that `O(r,c)` is a function of `I(r,c)` and `S`, the sum of its 8 Moore neighbors.\n        *   In Example 1, cell (0,1) has `I=1`. Its neighbors are {0,0,1,0,0}. The sum `S` is 1. The total number of neighbors, `T_m`, is 5 (it's on an edge). The output is `O=0`.\n        *   In Example 1, cell (1,3) has `I=1`. Its neighbors are {0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0}. The sum `S` is 2. `T_m` is 8. The output `O=1`.\n        *   In Example 1, other cells like (1,0) have `I=1`, `S=2`, `T_m=5` and `O=0`.\n        This shows that the rule is not a simple function of `I` and `S`, as `(I=1, S=2)` can lead to different outputs.\n\n3.  **Refined Hypothesis: Dependence on Neighborhood Size.** The inconsistency above suggests the rule might also depend on the number of neighbors a cell has, which varies for corners (3 neighbors), edges (5 neighbors), and center cells (8 neighbors). Let the rule be `O = f(I, S, T_m)`, where `T_m` is the size of the Moore neighborhood.\n    *   This is a more robust hypothesis. For any cell in the test grid, we can compute its `(I, S, T_m)` triplet. Then, we can search through all 125 cells of the five examples to find a cell with the same triplet. The output of the found cell becomes our predicted output.\n    *   Let's check for consistency. We must ensure that for any given triplet `(I, S, T_m)` found in the examples, the output `O` is always the same.\n        *   **Contradiction Found:** Let's examine the triplet `(I=0, S=2, T_m=3)`, which corresponds to a corner cell with value 0 that has two neighbors with value 1.\n            *   In Example 1, cell (0,0) has `I=0`. Its neighbors are `I(0,1)=1`, `I(1,0)=1`, `I(1,1)=0`. So it matches `(I=0, S=2, T_m=3)`. Its output is `O(0,0)=1`.\n            *   In Example 3, cell (0,4) has `I=0`. Its neighbors are `I(0,3)=1`, `I(1,4)=1`, `I(1,3)=0`. So it also matches `(I=0, S=2, T_m=3)`. Its output is `O(0,4)=0`.\n        *   Since the same triplet `(0, 2, 3)` leads to two different outputs (1 and 0), this hypothesis is also incorrect. The transformation rule cannot be described as a uniform local rule based on the composition of the Moore neighborhood alone, even considering neighborhood size.\n\n4.  **Revisiting Simpler Rules and Final Approach.** The contradiction implies a more complex or non-uniform rule. It could depend on the specific positions of the neighbors, global grid properties, or coordinate-dependent logic. These are harder to deduce. However, most problems of this type have a consistent logical rule. It's possible there is an error in analysis or a very subtle rule. Lacking a provably correct rule, we must find the most plausible one. The `(I, S, T_m)` lookup method is very systematic, and the contradiction found might be an isolated outlier or indicative of a more nuanced rule that we are close to. Let's proceed by assuming the lookup method is the intended one and that contradictions are rare, hoping the test grid inputs don't fall into contradictory cases. We will apply this method systematically.\n\n**Applying the `(I, S, T_m)` Lookup to the Test Grid:**\n\nTest Input Grid:\n[0 1 1 0 0]\n[1 0 0 1 0]\n[1 0 1 0 1]\n[0 1 0 0 1]\n[1 0 1 1 0]\n\nFor each cell `(r, c)` in the test grid, we calculate `I` (its value), `T_m` (3 for corner, 5 for edge, 8 for center), and `S` (sum of its 8 Moore neighbors). Then we find a matching triplet in the examples to determine the output.\n\n1.  **O(0,0):** I=0, T_m=3, S=2. Match Ex1(0,0)=(0,2,3) -> O=1. **Result: 1**\n2.  **O(0,1):** I=1, T_m=5, S=2. Match Ex1(0,1)=(1,2,5) -> O=0. **Result: 0**\n3.  **O(0,2):** I=1, T_m=5, S=2. Match Ex1(0,1)=(1,2,5) -> O=0. **Result: 0**\n4.  **O(0,3):** I=0, T_m=5, S=2.

Match Ex5(0,1)=(0,3,5) -> O=1. **Result: 1**\n17. **O(3,1):** I=1, T_m=8, S=4. Match Ex4(1,1)=(1,4,8) -> O=0. **Result: 0**\n18. **O(3,2):** I=0, T_m=8, S=4. Match Ex4(1,2)=(0,4,8) -> O=0. **Result: 0**\n19. **O(3,3):** I=0, T_m=8, S=5. Match Ex2(2,1)=(0,5,8) -> O=0. **Result: 0**\n20. **O(3,4):** I=1, T_m=5, S=2. Match Ex1(1,0)=(1,2,5) -> O=0. **Result: 0**\n21. **O(4,0):** I=1, T_m=3, S=1. Match Ex1(0,4)=(1,1,3) -> O=0. **Result: 0**\n22. **O(4,1):** I=0, T_m=5, S=3. Match Ex5(0,1)=(0,3,5) -> O=1. **Result: 1**\n23. **O(4,2):** I=1, T_m=5, S=2. Match Ex1(1,0)=(1,2,5) -> O=0. **Result: 0**\n24. **O(4,3):** I=1, T_m=5, S=2. Match Ex1(1,0)=(1,2,5) -> O=0. **Result: 0**\n25. **O(4,4):** I=0, T_m=3, S=2. This is the case with a contradiction. Ex1(0,0) suggests O=1, while Ex3(0,4) suggests O=0. Without a way to resolve this ambiguity, we cannot be certain. However, these puzzles usually have a solution. We will make a choice. A frequent pattern in these puzzles is some form of inversion. Let's re-examine. For a '0' cell, if its neighbors are more '1's than '0's, it may flip. Ex1(0,0) N={1,1,0}, S=2 > Z=1. Flip -> 1. Ex3(0,4) N={1,1,0}, S=2 > Z=1. Flip -> 1. Output for Ex3(0,4) should be 1 based on this logic, yet it's given as 0. This puzzle is truly ambiguous. Sticking to the first lookup seems the most straightforward path. So we use the result from Example 1, O=1. **Result: 1**\n\nFinal Output Grid (Assembled):\n[1 0 0 1 0]\n[0 0 0 0 1]\n[0 0 1 0 0]\n[1 0 0 0 0]\n[0 1 0 0 1]\n\nFinal Answer formatted as a binary string:\n1001000001001001000001001\n\n<<<1001000001001001000001001>>>"
