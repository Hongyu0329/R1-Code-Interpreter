    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Coiled-Coil Pattern:**\n    The first step is to identify the characteristic repeating pattern of a coiled-coil, which is typically a heptad repeat of seven amino acids, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. In this repeat, the `a` and `d` positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. These residues form the hydrophobic core that holds the helices together. The `e` and `g` positions are often charged or polar and can form electrostatic interactions between helices.\n\n2.  **Assign Heptad Positions to the Sequence:**\n    The sequence is `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\n    We need to find a registration (or frame) for the `abcdefg` repeat that places hydrophobic amino acids consistently at the `a` and `d` positions. Let's look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues (like A, L, I, V, M, W, F).\n    The sequence has a prominent `A` ... `L` pattern separated by three residues (`A`x x `L`). This spacing is characteristic of `a` and `d` positions (or `d` and `g`, or `e` and `a`). The `a-d` spacing is the most common for core residues.\n    Let's try assigning `A` to the `a` position and `L` to the `d` position. This would mean the repeat looks like `A b c L e f g`.\n\n    Let's register the sequence starting with `A(4)` as the `a` position. The N-terminal `GEI` are considered flanking residues.\n    Heptad `abcdefg`:\n    Repeat 1: `A(4) Q(5) S(6) L(7) K(8) E(9) I(10)`\n    Repeat 2: `A(11) K(12) S(13) L(14) K(15) E(16) I(17)`\n    Repeat 3: `A(18) W(19) S(20) L(21) K(22) E(23) I(24)`\n    Repeat 4: `A(25) Q(26) S(27) L(28) K(29)` ... (the C-terminus is `KG`, making the last repeat incomplete)\n\n    This registration gives a very consistent pattern for the core `a` and `d` positions:\n    *   **`a` positions:** A, A, A, A (all Alanine)\n    *   **`d` positions:** L, L, L, L (all Leucine)\n\n    Let's also note the `e` and `g` positions:\n    *   **`e` positions:** K, K, K, K (all Lysine)\n    *   **`g` positions:** I, I, I (all Isoleucine)\n\n3.  **Relate Core Residues to Oligomeric State using Knobs-into-Holes Packing:**\n    The identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions is the primary determinant of the number of helices that will pack together (the oligomeric state). This is because the side chains (\"knobs\") from one helix must fit efficiently into the spaces (\"holes\") created by the side chains on the adjacent helix/helices.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Residue Size and Shape.** We have Alanine (a small hydrophobic residue) at all `a` positions and Leucine (a larger, bulky hydrophobic residue) at all `d` positions.\n\n    *   **Dimer (2 helices):** In a canonical dimer, the `a` position of one helix packs against the `a` position of the other, and `d` packs against `d'`. This results in `Ala-Ala` and `Leu-Leu` pairings. While possible, this asymmetry (`A` vs `L`) is not ideal for the parallel packing of a classic dimer, which often prefers residues of similar size at `a` and `d` (e.g., Leucine at both).\n\n    *   **Trimer (3 helices):** Trimers have a different packing geometry. A very common pattern for trimers is having a large hydrophobic residue like Leucine or Isoleucine at the `d` position and a polar residue like Asparagine (N) at the `a` position. The sequence `A` at `a` and `L` at `d` is not a characteristic signature for a trimer.\n\n    *   **Tetramer (4 helices):** The packing in a four-helix bundle is different again. A very strong predictor for a tetramer is the presence of a small hydrophobic residue at one core position (`a` or `d`) and a large one at the other. Our `a=Ala`, `d=Leu` pattern fits this rule perfectly. In the knobs-into-holes model for a tetramer, the small Alanine \"knob\" from the `a` position of one helix can pack efficiently into a \"hole\" created by the larger Leucine side chains from adjacent helices, and vice-versa. This complementarity of size and shape leads to excellent packing efficiency, creating a very stable hydrophobic core and strongly favoring a tetrameric state over others.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Role of `g` position.** The `g` positions are all Isoleucine (`I`), which is hydrophobic. In dimers, the `g` position is more solvent-exposed. In higher-order oligomers like trimers and especially tetramers, the `g` position becomes more buried in the hydrophobic core. Having a hydrophobic residue like Isoleucine at `g` therefore provides additional stability and preference for a higher-order oligomer (like a tetramer) over a dimer.\n\n    *   **Careful Point 3: Role of `e` position.** The `e` positions are all Lysine (`K`), which is positively charged. In a parallel coiled-coil, these charged residues would be aligned, leading to electrostatic repulsion. This repulsion is minimized by solvent exposure and the formation of salt bridges with oppositely charged residues (if present) or solvent molecules. This doesn't dictate the oligomeric state as strongly as the core `a/d` residues but is consistent with a parallel helical bundle.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of a small hydrophobic residue (Alanine) at every `a` position and a large hydrophobic residue (Leucine) at every `d` position is a classic and very strong indicator of a protein that forms a **tetrameric** (4-helix) coiled-coil. The excellent packing efficiency afforded by this size complementarity is the determining factor.\n\nThe predicted oligomeric state is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
