    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Artist and her Subject Matter**\nThe artist in question is Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler (1846–1933). She was a renowned British painter celebrated for her works depicting military history, particularly scenes of the British Army in action.\n\n**Step 2: List Notable Battle Paintings by Lady Butler and their Historical Dates**\nTo find the latest battle, we need to compile a list of her famous paintings and the dates of the historical events they portray.\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which took place on **16 June 1815**, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on **18 June 1815**.\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army*** (painted 1879): Depicts Dr. William Brydon's arrival at Jelalabad, the culmination of the British retreat from Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War in **January 1842**.\n*   ***Calling the Roll After an Engagement, Crimea*** (or *The Roll Call*) (painted 1874): Depicts a scene after the Battle of Inkerman, which occurred on **5 November 1854**, during the Crimean War.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Depicts the battle at the Rorke's Drift mission station during the Anglo-Zulu War, which took place on **22–23 January 1879**.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1898): Depicts the death of Lieutenant Robert Elwes at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War on **28 January 1881**.\n*   ***The Camel Corps*** (painted in the 1890s): Depicts a scene from the Nile Expedition of **1884–1885**, which was an attempt to relieve Major-General Charles Gordon at Khartoum during the Mahdist War.\n*   ***The Munsters' last stand at Etreux*** (painted 1920): Depicts the Rearguard Affair of Étreux, a battle involving the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Munster Fusiliers during the First World War on **27 August 1914**.\n*   ***A German Attack on a British Trench during the First World War*** (painted c. 1916): This painting shows a generic, but intense, scene of trench warfare from the **First World War (1914-1918)**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Dates of the Depicted Battles**\nNow, let's arrange the historical events in chronological order to find the latest one:\n1.  Battle of Quatre Bras (1815)\n2.  Battle of Waterloo (1815)\n3.  Retreat from Kabul (1842)\n4.  Battle of Inkerman (1854)\n5.  Battle of Rorke's Drift (1879)\n6.  Battle of Laing's Nek (1881)\n7.  Nile Expedition (1884-1885)\n8.  Rearguard Affair of Étreux (August 1914)\n9.  German Attack on a British Trench (sometime during WWI, after trench warfare began in late 1914)\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Latest Battle**\nFrom the list, the latest conflict Lady Butler painted was the First World War. She has two notable paintings from this period. The Rearguard Affair of Étreux (August 1914) was part of the war's initial mobile phase. Her other painting, *A German Attack on a British Trench*, depicts the static trench warfare that characterized the conflict from late 1914 until 1918. Therefore, the event shown in this latter painting is historically later than the action at Étreux.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the unnamed battle scene from the First World War shown in her painting *A German Attack on a British Trench during the First World War*.\n\n<<<A battle of the First World War, as depicted in the painting *A German Attack on a British Trench during the First World War*."
