The best replacement for the amino acids at positions 47-50 (S-E-E-D) would be to mutate all four residues to Alanine (A). This would create a neutral A-A-A-A patch, which directly tests the hypothesis by removing the negative charges from Glutamate and Aspartate and preventing the negative charge addition via phosphorylation at the Serine site, all while minimizing other structural or chemical disruptions.
