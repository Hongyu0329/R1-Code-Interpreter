    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d$:\n$d = 53599$.\nWe can test small prime factors:\n$53599 = 7 \\times 7657$\n$7657 = 13 \\times 589$\n$589 = 19 \\times 31$\nAll the factors $7, 13, 19, 31$ are prime numbers. So, the factorization is:\n$d = 7 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 31$\nSince $d$ is a product of distinct primes (i.e., it is square-free), the analysis is simplified.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo each prime factor:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p$.\n\n*   **Primitivity Condition:** A character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free number $d$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_p$ is primitive. For a prime modulus $p$, a character is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character (the character that is 1 for all inputs coprime to $p$). This is equivalent to saying that the order of $\\chi_p$ must be greater than 1.\n\n*   **Order Condition:** The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$.\n    We are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Component Characters\nFor a prime modulus $p$, the group of Dirichlet characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ (where $k$ divides $\\phi(p)$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n\nLet's find the orders of the character groups for our prime factors:\n*   $p=7: \\phi(7) = 6$\n*   $p=13: \\phi(13) = 12$\n*   $p=19: \\phi(19) = 18$\n*   $p=31: \\phi(31) = 30$\n\nFor the lcm of the orders of the components to be 6, the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be a divisor of 6. Combining this with the primitivity condition ($\\text{ord}(\\chi_p) > 1$), the possible orders for each component character are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nSince 6 divides $\\phi(p)$ for all our primes $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, characters of orders 2, 3, and 6 exist for each modulus. Let's count them:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$\n\nFor each prime factor $p$, the number of non-principal characters whose order divides 6 is the sum of the counts for orders 2, 3, and 6:\n$1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n### Step 4: Combinatorial Counting with Inclusion-Exclusion\nWe need to select one character $\\chi_p$ for each of the four primes $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$ such that:\n1.  Each $\\chi_p$ is non-principal and its order divides 6 (there are 5 choices for each).\n2.  The lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n\nThe lcm of the orders is 6 if and only if:\n*   (A) At least one component character has an order divisible by 2.\n*   (B) At least one component character has an order divisible by 3.\n\nWe will use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. Let $S$ be the set of all possible combinations of primitive characters whose orders divide 6.\n*   Total number of combinations in $S$: Since there are 5 choices for each of the 4 component characters, $|S| = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow, we subtract the combinations from $S$ where the lcm is NOT 6. This happens if the lcm is not divisible by 2, or not divisible by 3.\n*   **Case 1: lcm is not divisible by 2.** This means that the order of every component character $\\chi_p$ must be odd. From the possible orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, the only odd order is 3. So, each $\\chi_p$ must be a character of order 3. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ such characters.\n    Number of such combinations = $2^4 = 16$.\n\n*   **Case 2: lcm is not divisible by 3.** This means that the order of every component character $\\chi_p$ must not be a multiple of 3. From the possible orders $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, the only order not divisible by 3 is 2. So, each $\\chi_p$ must be a character of order 2. For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ such character.\n    Number of such combinations = $1^4 = 1$.\n\n*   **Overlap: lcm is not divisible by 2 AND not divisible by 3.** This would require the order of each component to be not divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3. No order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ satisfies this. The only such integer order is 1, but this corresponds to principal characters, which are excluded. So the number of such combinations is 0.\n\nThe number of combinations where the lcm is not 6 is the sum of Case 1 and Case 2 (since the overlap is 0): $16 + 1 = 17$.\n\nFinally, the number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of combinations minus those where the order is not 6:\nNumber of characters = $625 - 17 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
