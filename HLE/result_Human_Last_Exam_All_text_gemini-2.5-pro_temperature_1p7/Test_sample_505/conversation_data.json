    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in the described surface code configuration.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Logical Qubit Encoding in a Single Surface Code Patch\n\nA surface code encodes logical quantum information non-locally in the topological properties of a 2D lattice of physical qubits. For a finite, planar piece of surface code, often called a \"patch,\" logical qubits can be encoded in two main ways:\n\n1.  **Using Boundaries:** A single, simple rectangular patch of surface code, with specifically engineered boundaries (often called \"smooth\" and \"rough\" edges), can store **one logical qubit**. The logical operators are strings of physical qubit operations that stretch between opposite boundaries of the same type.\n2.  **Using Holes:** Creating a hole within the patch introduces a new, internal boundary. This new boundary allows for the definition of a new, independent logical qubit. A logical operator can be a string that loops around the hole, and its corresponding partner operator can be a string that connects the hole's boundary to the patch's outer boundary.\n\nTherefore, for a single patch of planar surface code, the number of logical qubits ($k$) it can encode is determined by the number of holes ($h$) it contains. The formula is:\n$k = 1 + h$\nThe '1' comes from the fundamental qubit encoded by the outer boundaries of the patch, and each hole adds an additional qubit.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Problem for Multiple Patches\n\nThe problem specifies:\n*   Number of patches ($N_p$) = 2\n*   Total number of holes ($N_h$) = 2\n\nSince the two patches are distinct and separate physical systems, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each individual patch.\n\nLet's label the patches as Patch 1 and Patch 2.\nLet $h_1$ be the number of holes in Patch 1 and $h_2$ be the number of holes in Patch 2.\n\nThe number of logical qubits in each patch will be:\n*   For Patch 1: $k_1 = 1 + h_1$\n*   For Patch 2: $k_2 = 1 + h_2$\n\nThe total number of logical qubits ($K_{total}$) is:\n$K_{total} = k_1 + k_2 = (1 + h_1) + (1 + h_2)$\n$K_{total} = 2 + h_1 + h_2$\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Constraint on the Number of Holes\n\nWe are given that the total number of holes is 2. This gives us the constraint:\n$h_1 + h_2 = 2$\n\nWe can now substitute this constraint into our equation for the total number of logical qubits:\n$K_{total} = 2 + (h_1 + h_2) = 2 + 2 = 4$\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Maximum by Considering All Distributions\n\nTo ensure this is the maximum, we can analyze all possible ways to distribute the two holes between the two patches. Since the number of holes must be an integer, the possible distributions for $(h_1, h_2)$ are:\n\n*   **Case A: Both holes in one patch.**\n    *   Let $h_1 = 2$ and $h_2 = 0$.\n    *   Qubits in Patch 1: $k_1 = 1 + h_1 = 1 + 2 = 3$\n    *   Qubits in Patch 2: $k_2 = 1 + h_2 = 1 + 0 = 1$\n    *   Total Qubits: $K_{total} = 3 + 1 = 4$\n\n*   **Case B: One hole in each patch.**\n    *   Let $h_1 = 1$ and $h_2 = 1$.\n    *   Qubits in Patch 1: $k_1 = 1 + h_1 = 1 + 1 = 2$\n    *   Qubits in Patch 2: $k_2 = 1 + h_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$\n    *   Total Qubits: $K_{total} = 2 + 2 = 4$\n\nBoth possible distributions of the holes result in a total of 4 logical qubits. Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 4.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe number of logical qubits in this setup is given by the sum of the number of patches and the total number of holes ($K = N_{patches} + N_{holes}$). With 2 patches and 2 holes, the total number of logical qubits is $2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
