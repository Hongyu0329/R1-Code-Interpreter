    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The primary task is to compute the determinant of the 3x3 matrix A, which is explicitly given:\n    \\[\n    A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n    -1 & -1 & 2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The context provided (\"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\") is a specific name for this matrix in a particular field of study. However, for the calculation of the determinant, we only need the matrix A itself. The numbers 1/2 and 13 do not appear in the matrix entries, so we can proceed with standard methods of linear algebra.\n\n2.  **Choose a Method for Calculation:** There are several ways to compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\n    *   The Cofactor Expansion method.\n    *   Sarrus's Rule.\n    *   Using properties of the matrix, such as row operations or finding eigenvalues.\n\n3.  **Method 1: Using Matrix Properties (Most Efficient):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Observe the rows (or columns) of the matrix. Notice if there's a special relationship between them.\n    *   Let's sum the elements of each row:\n        *   Row 1: \\( 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0 \\)\n        *   Row 2: \\( (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0 \\)\n        *   Row 3: \\( (-1) + (-1) + 2 = 0 \\)\n    *   **Key Insight:** If the sum of the entries in each row of a square matrix is zero, its rows are linearly dependent. Specifically, if we add the second and third columns to the first column (an elementary column operation that does not change the determinant), we get a column of zeros.\n        \\[ C_1 \\to C_1 + C_2 + C_3 \\]\n        \\[\n        \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2-1-1 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1+2-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1-1+2 & -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n        \\]\n    *   A matrix with a column of zeros has a determinant of 0.\n    *   **Alternative Explanation (Eigenvalues):** The fact that each row sums to 0 means that the vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = [1, 1, 1]^T \\) is an eigenvector with an eigenvalue of 0, since \\( A\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0} = 0\\mathbf{v} \\). The determinant of a matrix is the product of its eigenvalues. Since one of the eigenvalues is 0, the product must be 0.\n\n4.  **Method 2: Cofactor Expansion (Verification):**\n    *   The formula for the determinant using cofactor expansion along the first row is:\n        \\[ \\det(A) = a_{11} C_{11} + a_{12} C_{12} + a_{13} C_{13} \\]\n        \\[ \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n    *   Calculate the 2x2 determinants:\n        *   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n        *   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n        *   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n    *   Substitute these values back:\n        \\[ \\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3) \\]\n        \\[ \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0 \\]\n    *   This method confirms the result.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth methods clearly show that the determinant of the matrix A is 0. The most elegant approach involves noticing the linear dependence of the rows/columns, which immediately implies a zero determinant.\n\nThe final answer is **0**.\n\n<<<0>>>"
