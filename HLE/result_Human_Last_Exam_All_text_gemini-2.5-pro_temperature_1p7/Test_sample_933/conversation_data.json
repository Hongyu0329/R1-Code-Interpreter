    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Synthesis of Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF4)**\nXenon tetrafluoride is synthesized by the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) gas and fluorine (F2) gas. The balanced chemical equation is:\nXe(g) + 2 F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\nThis reaction is exothermic, but it requires an initial input of energy (activation energy) to get started.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Factors Affecting the Product**\nThe synthesis of xenon fluorides is very sensitive to the reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the molar ratio of the reactants. Different conditions will favor the formation of different xenon fluorides (XeF₂, XeF₄, or XeF₆).\n*   **To produce XeF₂:** An excess of xenon is typically used, and the reaction is often carried out at ~400 °C or by using photochemical methods (UV light).\n*   **To produce XeF₆:** A large excess of fluorine is used, along with higher pressures and temperatures (e.g., >300 °C and >50 atm).\n*   **To produce XeF₄:** Specific conditions are required to maximize the yield of XeF₄ while minimizing the formation of XeF₂ and XeF₆.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Optimal Conditions for Efficient XeF₄ Production**\nAccording to established chemical literature and standard laboratory procedures, the most common and efficient method for producing pure Xenon tetrafluoride involves the following conditions:\n*   **Reactant Ratio:** A molar ratio of Xe to F₂ of approximately 1:5. The excess fluorine helps drive the reaction towards XeF₄ rather than stopping at XeF₂.\n*   **Container:** The reaction is carried out in a vessel made of a material that can withstand highly reactive fluorine gas, such as nickel.\n*   **Temperature:** The mixture is heated to a specific temperature to ensure a reasonable reaction rate. The standard, well-established temperature for this synthesis is **400 °C (673 K)**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Temperature Options**\nWe need to find the coldest temperature at which XeF₄ can *still be produced efficiently*. Let's consider the choices:\n*   **A. 600 C:** This temperature is quite high. While the reaction would proceed, higher temperatures, especially with excess fluorine, can start to favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). Therefore, it is not the most optimal temperature for XeF₄.\n*   **B. 400 C:** This is the widely cited and accepted temperature for the efficient, high-yield synthesis of XeF₄. It provides enough energy to overcome the activation energy and proceed at a practical rate, while being controlled enough to prevent significant formation of XeF₆.\n*   **C. 200 C:** At this lower temperature, the rate of reaction between xenon and fluorine would be significantly slower. The process would not be considered \"efficient\" as it would take a very long time to produce a substantial amount of product.\n*   **D. 78 C, E. 0 C, F. -78 C:** These temperatures are far too low for the thermal reaction to proceed at any meaningful rate. The activation energy barrier is too high, and the reaction would be impractically slow, if it occurs at all without other energy sources like UV radiation.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, 400 °C is the standard and optimal temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride via the direct thermal method. While the reaction might occur at slightly lower temperatures, the efficiency drops significantly. Among the given choices, 400 °C is the lowest temperature that aligns with a standard, efficient production method.\n\n<<<B>>>"
