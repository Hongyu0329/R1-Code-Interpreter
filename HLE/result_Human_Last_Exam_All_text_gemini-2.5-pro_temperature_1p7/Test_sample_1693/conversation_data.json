    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for a specific ship with four key criteria:\n1.  **Nationality:** French.\n2.  **Size:** The largest by displacement.\n3.  **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by a German U-boat.\n4.  **Timeframe:** During World War II, but specifically before the Franco-German Armistice of 22 June 1940. This period runs from 3 September 1939 to 21 June 1940.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the \"Careful Points\"\n*   **\"Largest by displacement\"**: This is a crucial detail. Displacement is the weight of a ship, typically measured in tons. For merchant ships, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) is more common, which measures volume, not weight. We must find the displacement figure to make an accurate comparison. A large passenger liner generally has a higher displacement than a tanker of similar GRT.\n*   **\"Sunk by a U-boat\"**: This can mean a direct attack (torpedo or deck gun) or an indirect one, such as hitting a mine laid by a U-boat. Minelaying was a primary function of U-boats, and a ship lost to a U-boat-laid mine is officially credited as a U-boat sinking. We must consider both types of sinking.\n*   **\"Before the 1940 armistice\"**: The Armistice was signed on 22 June 1940. Any sinking up to and including 21 June 1940 falls within the specified timeframe.\n\n### Step 3: Searching for Candidates\nWe need to search for all French ships sunk by U-boats in the specified period and then compare their displacements.\n\n*   **Major Warships:** A review of French naval losses shows that no major warships (battleships, aircraft carriers, heavy cruisers) were sunk by U-boats during this early period of the war. Losses of smaller warships, like the destroyer *Siroco*, were due to S-boats and aircraft, not U-boats.\n*   **Merchant Ships and Auxiliaries:** This is the most likely category. Large passenger liners and tankers were in service. Let's examine some of the largest French vessels sunk by U-boats in this period:\n    *   The armed merchant cruiser **Bretagne**: Sunk on 14 October 1939 by a torpedo from *U-45*. It had a GRT of 10,108 and an approximate displacement of around 15,000 tons.\n    *   The tanker **Emile Miguet**: Sunk on 12 October 1939 by a torpedo from *U-48*. It was a very large tanker with a GRT of 14,115. Its deadweight tonnage was over 20,000 tons, putting its full load displacement in the range of 27,000-28,000 tons.\n    *   The passenger liner **SS Champlain**: This ship was requisitioned for government service. It struck a mine laid by *U-65* off the coast of France on 17 June 1940 and subsequently sank.\n\n### Step 4: Comparing the Final Candidates\nNow we compare the top candidates, focusing on displacement.\n\n1.  **Emile Miguet**:\n    *   Sinking: 12 October 1939 by torpedo from *U-48*. Fits the timeframe and cause.\n    *   Displacement: Estimated at approximately **28,000 tons**.\n\n2.  **SS Champlain**:\n    *   Sinking: 17 June 1940 from a mine laid by *U-65*.\n        *   The cause, a U-boat-laid mine, qualifies as \"sunk by a U-boat\".\n        *   The date, 17 June 1940, is five days before the armistice was signed, so it falls within the required timeframe.\n    *   Displacement: The *Champlain* was a very large passenger liner. Its Gross Register Tonnage was 28,124, but its full load displacement is cited as approximately **33,700 tons**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nComparing the two largest vessels, the **SS Champlain** had a significantly larger displacement (approx. 33,700 tons) than the tanker **Emile Miguet** (approx. 28,000 tons). Both sinkings meet the criteria of being caused by a U-boat and occurring before the June 1940 armistice. Therefore, the *SS Champlain* is the correct answer.\n\n<<<SS Champlain"
