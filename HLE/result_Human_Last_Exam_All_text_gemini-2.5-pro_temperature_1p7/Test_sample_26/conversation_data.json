    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object $X$**\nLet $X$ be a smooth quintic hypersurface in complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n*   **Hypersurface**: $X$ is defined by a single homogeneous polynomial equation $F(Z_0, Z_1, Z_2, Z_3) = 0$.\n*   **Quintic**: The degree of the polynomial $F$ is 5.\n*   **Smooth**: This implies that $X$ is a complex manifold.\n*   **Dimension**: The ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a complex manifold of dimension 3 (real dimension 6). A hypersurface in it has complex dimension $3-1=2$. So, $X$ is a complex surface, which corresponds to a real manifold of dimension 4.\n*   **Topological Properties**: As a closed submanifold of a compact space ($\\mathbb{CP}^3$), $X$ is compact. Being a complex manifold, it is also orientable. Thus, $X$ is a compact, connected, orientable 4-dimensional real manifold.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Homotopy Group to a Homology Group**\nOur goal is to find the rank of the abelian group $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring with $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nA crucial link between homotopy and homology groups is provided by the Hurewicz theorem.\n*   **Hurewicz Theorem (mod C, due to Serre)**: For a simply connected topological space $Y$ (i.e., $\\pi_1(Y) = 0$), the Hurewicz map induces an isomorphism $\\pi_n(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\cong H_n(Y; \\mathbb{Q})$ for all $n \\ge 1$. This implies that the rank of the homotopy group $\\pi_n(Y)$ is equal to the rank of the homology group $H_n(Y; \\mathbb{Z})$, which is the n-th Betti number $b_n(Y)$.\n*   Therefore, if we can show that $X$ is simply connected, our problem reduces to calculating the rank of $H_3(X)$, which is the Betti number $b_3(X)$.\n\n**Step 3: Prove that $X$ is Simply Connected**\nWe can use the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem to relate the topology of $X$ to the topology of the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n*   **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem (Homotopy Version)**: Let $M$ be a smooth complex projective variety of dimension $n$, and let $X$ be a smooth hyperplane section of $M$. Then the inclusion map $i: X \\to M$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(M)$ for $k < n-1$ and a surjection for $k = n-1$. A more general version states that for a subvariety $X$ of complex dimension $m$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^N$, the inclusion map induces isomorphisms $\\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^N)$ for $k < m$ and a surjection for $k = m$.\n*   In our case, $X$ has complex dimension $m=2$ inside $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. The theorem implies that the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces an isomorphism $i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$ for $k < 2$.\n*   For $k=1$, we have $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n*   It is a standard result that complex projective spaces are simply connected, so $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\n*   Therefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. This confirms that $X$ is simply connected.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Third Betti Number, $b_3(X)$**\nNow that we have established that rank$(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$, we need to compute $b_3(X)$. We can do this using Poincaré Duality.\n*   **Poincaré Duality**: For a compact, connected, orientable $n$-dimensional manifold $M$, there is an isomorphism between its homology and cohomology groups: $H_k(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^{n-k}(M; \\mathbb{Z})$ for all $k$.\n*   For our manifold $X$, which is a compact, orientable 4-manifold ($n=4$), Poincaré Duality gives $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H^{4-3}(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$.\n*   This isomorphism implies that their ranks are equal: $b_3(X) = \\text{rank}(H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = \\text{rank}(H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = b^1(X)$.\n*   **Universal Coefficient Theorem**: This theorem relates cohomology to homology. For any topological space, the Betti numbers computed from homology and cohomology are equal, i.e., $b^k(M) = b_k(M)$. Thus, $b^1(X) = b_1(X)$.\n*   Therefore, we have the chain of equalities: $b_3(X) = b^1(X) = b_1(X)$.\n*   The first Betti number, $b_1(X)$, is the rank of the first homology group $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. The Hurewicz theorem states that $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $\\pi_1(X)$.\n*   Since we found in Step 3 that $\\pi_1(X)=0$, its abelianization is also the trivial group. So, $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n*   The rank of the trivial group is 0, so $b_1(X) = 0$.\n*   This leads to the conclusion that $b_3(X) = 0$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nCombining the results from the previous steps:\n1.  We need to find the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n2.  Since $X$ is simply connected (Step 3), rank($\\pi_3(X)$) = rank($H_3(X)$) = $b_3(X)$.\n3.  We calculated $b_3(X) = 0$ (Step 4).\n4.  Therefore, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 0.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   The argument relies on several powerful theorems: Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, Hurewicz Theorem, Poincaré Duality, and Universal Coefficient Theorem.\n*   The property of $X$ being a complex manifold is crucial, as it ensures $X$ is orientable, which is required for Poincaré Duality.\n*   The fact that the hypersurface is *quintic* (degree 5) is not essential for this specific result. The same argument holds for any smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, as the reasoning only depends on its dimension and smoothness.\n*   An alternative method using Hodge theory for Kähler manifolds also confirms that $b_3(X) = b_1(X)$ for any complex surface, leading to the same conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition:\nThe analysis has robustly shown that $b_3(X) = 0$. As $X$ is simply connected, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is equal to $b_3(X)$."
