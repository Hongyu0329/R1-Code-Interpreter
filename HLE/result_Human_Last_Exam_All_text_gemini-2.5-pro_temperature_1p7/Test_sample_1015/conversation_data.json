    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify the key difference in the execution of a specific ballet movement, *cambré derrière*, between two distinct ballet training methods: Vaganova and Balanchine.\n\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A backward bend of the torso from the waist. *Cambré* means \"arched,\" and *derrière* means \"to the back.\"\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A Russian ballet technique known for its precise, logical progression, strength, clean lines, and focus on coordinating the entire body harmoniously. It emphasizes stability and control.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** An American ballet technique developed by George Balanchine, characterized by speed, musicality, athleticism, and a \"neo-classical\" aesthetic that often extends and reinterprets classical lines. It frequently utilizes more extreme positions and an \"off-balance\" feeling.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the execution of a cambré derrière in the Vaganova method.**\nThe Vaganova method places a strong emphasis on core stability and maintaining proper alignment.\n*   **Torso and Back:** The bend initiates from the upper back, lifting up and out of the waist before arching backward. The movement is controlled and supported by the back and abdominal muscles.\n*   **Hips:** This is a crucial point. In the Vaganova technique, the hips must remain completely square to the front. Both hips are pressed forward equally as the upper body bends back. This creates a stable base and isolates the bend in the spine, ensuring a pure, classical line. The pelvis acts as a solid, unmoving foundation.\n*   **Head and Arms:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back without \"breaking\" the neck. The arms (*port de bras*) are held in a classical, rounded shape (e.g., fifth position en haut).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the execution of a cambré derrière in the Balanchine method.**\nThe Balanchine method often prioritizes dynamic lines and visual impact over the strict stability of the Vaganova method.\n*   **Torso and Back:** The bend can be much deeper and is often executed more quickly to match the musicality.\n*   **Hips:** This is the most significant point of divergence. To achieve a deeper and more dramatic backbend, the Balanchine style allows the hip of the supporting leg to press forward. The pelvis is not kept rigidly square; it is allowed to open or angle slightly. This \"releases\" the hip, which in turn allows for a greater range of motion in the spine and creates a sweeping, dynamic, and often off-balance line that is characteristic of Balanchine's choreography.\n*   **Head and Arms:** The head may be thrown back more dramatically. The arms may also be styled differently, sometimes with less roundedness and more angularity to create a sharper, neo-classical look.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two methods and evaluate the answer choices.**\nBy comparing the two techniques, the primary and most fundamental difference in the mechanics of the movement is how the hips are used.\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While the styling of the arms (*port de bras*) can differ, it's a stylistic detail rather than the core mechanical difference in the cambré itself.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the central difference. Vaganova requires square, stable hips. Balanchine allows the hip to release and push forward to create a deeper, more dynamic line. This is a foundational, defining technical distinction.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is often faster, speed is a quality of performance, not a core technical difference in *how* the step is formed. A cambré can be done slowly or quickly in either style.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The deeper backbend in the Balanchine style is a *result* of the technique, specifically the released hip. The hip placement is the *cause* of the potentially deeper bend, making it the more fundamental difference.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** Similar to the arms, the head placement is a stylistic detail that follows the overall line created by the body. The fundamental driver of that line's difference is the hip placement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most accurate and fundamental distinction between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière lies in the alignment and use of the hips. Vaganova prioritizes pelvic stability (square hips), while Balanchine utilizes a released hip to achieve its signature aesthetic.\n\n<<<B>>>"
