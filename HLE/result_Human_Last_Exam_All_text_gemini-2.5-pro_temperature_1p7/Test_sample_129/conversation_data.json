    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Expression Length:** The final expression must contain exactly 5 symbols.\n2.  **Allowed Symbols:** T, F, !, &, |, (, ). Symbols can be repeated.\n3.  **Target Value:** The expression must evaluate to True (T).\n4.  **Operator Precedence:** The order of operations is `!` (highest), then `&`, then `|` (lowest).\n5.  **Parentheses:** `()` are used for grouping and overriding precedence. They count towards the symbol limit.\n6.  **Valid Syntax:** Expressions must be syntactically correct. For example, `T&F` is valid, but `T&&F` is not. `!(T&F)` requires parentheses and has a length of 6 (`!`, `(`, `T`, `&`, `F`, `)`), so it is not a 5-symbol expression.\n\nWe will find all possible valid structures for a 5-symbol expression and count how many of them evaluate to True.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Expression Structures**\n\nLet's categorize the expressions by their top-level structure. `A` and `B` represent single literals (`T` or `F`). `E_n` represents a valid expression of length `n`.\n\n**Category 1: `A op B op C` (No parentheses)**\nThese are expressions with three literals and two binary operators. The length is 3 (for literals) + 2 (for operators) = 5.\n*   **Structure `A & B & C`**: This is parsed as `(A & B) & C`. It evaluates to True only if A, B, and C are all `T`.\n    *   `T & T & T` → True. (1 expression)\n*   **Structure `A | B | C`**: This is parsed as `(A | B) | C`. It evaluates to True if at least one of A, B, or C is `T`. It is False only if all are `F`. There are 2³ = 8 combinations for A, B, C.\n    *   7 combinations are True. (e.g., `T|T|T`, `T|T|F`, ..., `F|F|T`). (7 expressions)\n*   **Structure `A & B | C`**: Parsed as `(A & B) | C`. True if `C` is `T`, or if `C` is `F` and `A&B` is `T`.\n    *   `C=T`: 4 combinations (`T&T|T`, `T&F|T`, `F&T|T`, `F&F|T`). All are True.\n    *   `C=F` and `A&B=T`: 1 combination (`T&T|F`). This is True.\n    *   Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n*   **Structure `A | B & C`**: Parsed as `A | (B & C)`. True if `A` is `T`, or if `A` is `F` and `B&C` is `T`.\n    *   `A=T`: 4 combinations (`T|T&T`, `T|T&F`, `T|F&T`, `T|F&F`). All are True.\n    *   `A=F` and `B&C=T`: 1 combination (`F|T&T`). This is True.\n    *   Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n*   **Subtotal for Category 1:** 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18**\n\n**Category 2: `!A op !B`**\nThe structure is `!`, `A`, `op`, `!`, `B`. Length is 1+1+1+1+1 = 5. Due to precedence, this is parsed as `(!A) op (!B)`.\n*   **Structure `!A & !B`**: True only if `!A` is True and `!B` is True. This means `A` must be `F` and `B` must be `F`.\n    *   `!F & !F` → `T & T` → True. (1 expression)\n*   **Structure `!A | !B`**: False only if both `!A` and `!B` are False. This means `A=T` and `B=T`.\n    *   `!T | !T` → False. The other 3 combinations (`!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`) are True. (3 expressions)\n*   **Subtotal for Category 2:** 1 + 3 = **4**\n\n**Category 3: Nested `!` operators**\n*   **Structure `!!!!A`**: The symbols are `!`, `!`, `!`, `!`, `A`. Length 5.\n    *   `!!!!T` → `!!!F` → `!!T` → `!F` → `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!!!!F` → `F`.\n*   **Structure `!!(A)`**: Symbols are `!`, `!`, `(`, `A`, `)`. Length 5.\n    *   `!!(T)` → `!!T` → `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!!(F)` → `!!F` → `F`.\n*   **Structure `!(!A)`**: Symbols are `!`, `(`, `!`, `A`, `)`. Length 5.\n    *   `!(!T)` → `!F` → `T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!(!F)` → `!T` → `F`.\n*   **Subtotal for Category 3:** 1 + 1 + 1 = **3**\n\n**Category 4: Expressions with essential parentheses**\nThe parentheses must not be redundant (i.e., they change the default order of operations or group a sub-expression).\n\n*   **Structure `(E_3)`**: The expression `E_3` must have length 3, and the total length with parentheses is 5. We need `E_3` to be True.\n    *   Valid true expressions of length 3:\n        1.  `T & T`\n        2.  `T | T`\n        3.  `T | F`\n        4.  `F | T`\n        5.  `! ! T`\n        6.  `( T )`\n    *   Encasing these 6 expressions in parentheses gives 6 true expressions of length 5: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, `(!!T)`, `((T))`. (6 expressions)\n*   **Structure `A op (B)`**: The expression has length `1+1+3=5`. Parentheses group the single literal `B`.\n    *   `A & (B)`: True only for `T & (T)`. (1 expression)\n    *   `A | (B)`: True for `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`. (3 expressions)\n*   **Structure `(A) op B`**: Symmetrical to the above.\n    *   `(A) & B`: True only for `(T) & T`. (1 expression)\n    *   `(A) | B`: True for `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T`. (3 expressions)\n*   **Subtotal for Category 4:** 6 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 = **14**\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nLet's sum the counts from all disjoint categories:\n*   Category 1 (`A op B op C`): 18\n*   Category 2 (`!A op !B`): 4\n*   Category 3 (Nested `!`): 3\n*   Category 4 (Essential Parentheses): 14\n\nTotal = 18 + 4 + 3 + 14 = 39.\n\nThere are 39 distinct true boolean expressions of length 5.\n\n<<<39>>>"
