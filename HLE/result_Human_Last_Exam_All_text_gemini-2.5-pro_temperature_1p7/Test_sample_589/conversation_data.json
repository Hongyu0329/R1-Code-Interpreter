    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for a specific film based on a very detailed scene. The essential criteria are:\n*   **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n*   **Production:** Produced by a major film studio (e.g., Paramount, Warner Bros., Universal, etc.).\n*   **Character:** A teenager.\n*   **Object:** A pink bike.\n*   **Action:** The teenager pedals the pink bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm potential genres and films.**\nThe scene described is one of defiance and recklessness, likely a \"game of chicken.\" This points toward dramas or action films centered on teenage rebellion. Many teen movies feature bicycles (*E.T.*, *The Goonies*, *It*, *Super 8*), but the combination of a *pink* bike and a direct confrontation with a car is the most distinctive clue.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate common teen movies with themes of rebellion.**\nA prominent film about teenage rebellion is *Footloose*. It's famous for scenes of defiance involving vehicles.\n*   In the original **1984 version of *Footloose***, the most similar scenes are the \"tractor chicken\" game and Ariel Moore standing in the path of an oncoming train. Neither of these scenes involves a pink bike.\n*   Remakes often alter iconic scenes to create a new experience for the audience. Therefore, the **2011 remake of *Footloose*** is a strong candidate to examine.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the 2011 remake of *Footloose*.**\nLet's check if this film meets all the criteria from the question.\n*   **Hollywood feature film from a major studio?** Yes, *Footloose* (2011) was produced and distributed by Paramount Pictures, a major studio.\n*   **A teenager?** The characters are high school students. The specific character in the scene is Rusty Rodriguez, the best friend of the female lead, Ariel. Rusty is a teenager.\n*   **A pink bike and the specific action?** There is a scene where Rusty, after an argument with her boyfriend, gets on her bicycle to leave. Her boyfriend gets into his car and drives aggressively toward her. In a moment of defiance, Rusty turns her bike around and pedals straight at his oncoming car. The bike she is riding is distinctly and memorably pink. Her boyfriend swerves away at the last second to avoid hitting her.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\nThe scene in the 2011 remake of *Footloose* precisely matches every detail provided in the question. It is a Hollywood feature film from a major studio, and it depicts the teenager Rusty riding her pink bike directly into the path of her boyfriend's oncoming car.\n\n<<<Footloose (2011)>>>"
