    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** \"Andrei Voznesensky called this man 'a joy-discovering sailor'\".\n    *   The poet is Andrei Voznesensky, a famous 20th-century Russian poet. This strongly suggests the subject is a figure from Russian history.\n    *   The phrase \"joy-discovering sailor\" (or more fully in the original poem, \"seafarer and carpenter and discoverer of joy\") points to a historical explorer or traveler who was the subject of one of Voznesensky's poems. This poetic description suggests a journey that was not just about geographical discovery, but also had a significant emotional or romantic element.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** \"and wondered, 'Where is your grave, even a mound?'\"\n    *   This is a direct quote from a poem. It tells us that at the time Voznesensky wrote the poem, the subject's final resting place was unknown. The grave had been lost to history.\n    *   These lines are from Voznesensky's famous poem \"Saga\" (Сага), which formed the basis for the popular Soviet rock opera *Juno and Avos* (Юнона и Авось). This rock opera tells the tragic love story of a Russian diplomat and a Spanish girl in California.\n\n3.  **Identify the subject of the poem/opera:**\n    *   The central figure of *Juno and Avos* is the Russian nobleman, explorer, and diplomat Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. He led a mission to California in 1806 on behalf of the Russian-American Company. There, he fell in love with Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the Spanish commandant of San Francisco. He promised to return to her after getting the Tsar's permission to marry a Catholic, but tragically died on his journey back across Siberia.\n\n4.  **Analyze the third clue:** \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"\n    *   This clue requires us to verify the history of Rezanov's grave.\n    *   Nikolai Rezanov died in the city of Krasnoyarsk in 1807. He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral.\n    *   In the 1930s, under Soviet rule, the cathedral and its cemetery were destroyed. The exact location of Rezanov's grave was lost, which is why Voznesensky could write, \"Where is your grave...?\"\n    *   Spurred by the immense popularity of the *Juno and Avos* rock opera in the 1980s, a group of historians and enthusiasts in Krasnoyarsk launched a search. Using old city plans, they managed to determine the approximate location of the former altar of the destroyed cathedral and, with it, the presumed spot of Rezanov's grave. This successful identification of the site happened in the late 1980s, perfectly matching the clue. A monument was eventually placed on the site.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Source:** The key is recognizing that the quotes belong to Andrei Voznesensky's famous work about a specific historical figure. Knowing about the rock opera *Juno and Avos* is a significant shortcut.\n*   **The Subject's Role:** Rezanov was more of a statesman and diplomat than a simple \"sailor,\" but he did command a sea voyage, making Voznesensky's poetic label fitting.\n*   **The Lost Grave:** It is important to understand that the grave was not lost at sea or in an unknown land; it was destroyed within a major Siberian city, making its rediscovery a matter of historical and archaeological research rather than exploration.\n*   **The Timeline:** The \"late 1980s\" is a very specific timeframe. This is not a vague clue; it refers to a documented historical event (the rediscovery of the grave's location) which solidifies the identification of the man as Rezanov.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  The poem and quotes are from Andrei Voznesensky's work about a Russian historical figure.\n2.  The famous work is *Juno and Avos*, based on the poem \"Saga.\"\n3.  The main character of this work is Nikolai Rezanov.\n4.  Rezanov's grave was in Krasnoyarsk, was destroyed by the Soviets, and its location was rediscovered in the late 1980s.\n5.  All clues perfectly align with the life and death of Nikolai Rezanov. Therefore, the man's last name is Rezanov.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
