    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle's transformation logic.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Input and Output Format\nThe inputs and outputs are strings representing a grid of numbers. Commas (`,`) are used to separate the rows of the grid. The core of the puzzle is to figure out the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Transformation in Example A\n\n*   **Input_A**: `001111,121111,111111`\n    *   Grid form:\n        ```\n        0 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 2 1 1 1 1\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n*   **Output_A**: `201111,101111,111111`\n    *   Grid form:\n        ```\n        2 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n*   **Changes**:\n    1.  The `2` at position `(1,1)` (row 1, column 1, using 0-based indexing) has become a `0`.\n    2.  The `0` at position `(0,0)` has become a `2`.\n*   **Observation**: This looks like the `2` \"moved\" from `(1,1)` to the location of an adjacent `0`, which is `(0,0)`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Transformation in Example B\n\n*   **Input_B**: `...1111002111111...`\n*   **Output_B**: `...1111000211110...`\n*   **Changes**:\n    1.  The `2` is located at `(3,6)`. It becomes a `0`.\n    2.  The `0` at `(2,7)` becomes a `2`.\n*   **Observation**: The `2` at `(3,6)` also moved to an adjacent `0` position, `(2,7)`.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate a Hypothesis for the Movement Rule\n\nIn both cases, the `2` moves to one of its 8 neighboring cells, provided that cell contains a `0`. The key is to figure out which neighbor is chosen if multiple `0`s are available.\n\nLet's look at the choices:\n*   **In A**: The `2` is at `(1,1)`. Its neighboring `0`s are at `(0,0)` and `(0,1)`. The chosen destination was `(0,0)`. This is the top-most, left-most neighbor. (Min row, then min col).\n*   **In B**: The `2` is at `(3,6)`. Its neighboring `0`s are at `(2,5)`, `(2,6)`, `(2,7)`, and `(3,5)`. The chosen destination was `(2,7)`. This is the top-most, right-most neighbor. (Min row, then max col).\n\nThe rule seems to be conditional. Let's see what the condition might be. A common trick in grid puzzles is to use the parity (evenness or oddness) of the coordinates.\n*   **For A**: The `2` is at `(r,c) = (1,1)`. `r+c = 1+1 = 2` (Even). The rule used was: \"select the neighbor with the minimum row, then the minimum column\".\n*   **For B**: The `2` is at `(r,c) = (3,6)`. `r+c = 3+6 = 9` (Odd). The rule used was: \"select the neighbor with the minimum row, then the maximum column\".\n\nThis leads to a solid hypothesis:\n1.  Find the `2` at position `(r,c)`.\n2.  If `r+c` is **even**, the `2` moves to its neighboring `0` that is top-most, then left-most.\n3.  If `r+c` is **odd**, the `2` moves to its neighboring `0` that is top-most, then right-most.\n4.  The original position of the `2` becomes `0`.\n\n### Step 5: Apply the Rule to Input_C to find the MISSING value\n\n*   **Input_C**: `000000,011120,111111`\n    *   Grid form:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0  (Row 0)\n        0 1 1 1 2 0  (Row 1)\n        1 1 1 1 1 1  (Row 2)\n        ```\n1.  **Locate the `2`**: It's at `(r,c) = (1,4)`.\n2.  **Check parity**: `r+c = 1+4 = 5`, which is **odd**. So, we must use the \"odd\" rule.\n3.  **Find adjacent `0`s**: The neighbors of `(1,4)` are:\n    *   Above: `(0,3)`, `(0,4)`, `(0,5)` -> Values are `0, 0, 0`\n    *   Sides: `(1,3)`, `(1,5)` -> Values are `1, 0`\n    *   Below: `(2,3)`, `(2,4)`, `(2,5)` -> Values are `1, 1, 1`\n    The coordinates of the neighboring `0`s are: `(0,3)`, `(0,4)`, `(0,5)`, and `(1,5)`.\n4.  **Apply the \"odd\" rule**: Select the neighbor with the minimum row index, breaking ties with the maximum column index.\n    *   The minimum row index is `0`. The candidates are `(0,3)`, `(0,4)`, and `(0,5)`.\n    *   Among these, the one with the maximum column index is `(0,5)`.\n5.  **Transform the grid**:\n    *   The `2` at `(1,4)` moves to `(0,5)`.\n    *   The value at `(1,4)` becomes `0`.\n    *   The value at `(0,5)` becomes `2`.\n6.  **Construct the final grid**:\n    *   The original grid was:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0\n        0 1 1 1 2 0\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   The new grid will be:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 2\n        0 1 1 1 0 0\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n7.  **Format the final answer as a string**: Concatenate the rows with commas.\n\nThe final answer is `000002,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
