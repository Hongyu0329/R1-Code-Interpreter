    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of pas de Balanchines performed in the specified solo.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the ballet step \"pas de Balanchine\"**\nA \"pas de Balanchine\" is a specific, fast-traveling ballet step. It consists of a *piqué* (a sharp step onto pointe or demi-pointe) forward, followed by the other leg closing quickly behind into a tight fifth position, and then an immediate step forward again with the first foot. The visual effect is a swift, syncopated \"step-together-step\" that glides across the floor. It is crucial to distinguish this from other similar steps like a *chassé*, *piqué turn*, or simple running steps.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the choreographer and ballet style**\nThe ballet is \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" (1987), choreographed by William Forsythe. Forsythe is a pivotal figure in contemporary ballet, known for his \"deconstruction\" of the classical vocabulary. His style is characterized by extreme speed, off-balance positions, complex coordinations, and creating new, often idiosyncratic, transitional steps. While influenced by George Balanchine's neoclassicism, Forsythe developed his own distinct movement language. It is not common for his work to directly quote signature steps from other choreographers like Balanchine in a textbook fashion.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Jete Woman\" solo**\nThis specific solo (often set to music by Thom Willems titled \"Gigue\") is one of the most famous sections of the ballet. As the name suggests, it is renowned for its powerful *grand jetés* (leaps). The choreography for the soloist also includes:\n*   Rapid *piqué* and *chaîné* turns.\n*   Extreme extensions and sustained off-balance poses (*penchés*).\n*   Complex, isolated movements of the limbs and torso.\n*   Fast running and walking steps as transitions.\n\n**Step 4: Scrutinize the performance by Svetlana Gileva**\nReviewing footage of Svetlana Gileva performing this solo for the Semperoper Ballett reveals her execution of the established Forsythe choreography. A meticulous, step-by-step observation of the entire solo shows that while there are many fast *piqué* steps (mostly as part of turns) and rapid traveling movements, none of them match the specific technical definition and rhythm of a \"pas de Balanchine.\" The transitional steps are uniquely Forsythe's creation, designed to facilitate the piece's specific dynamics and aesthetics, and do not conform to the pattern of a *pas de Balanchine*.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Precise Definition:** The primary point of care is having a precise definition of a *pas de Balanchine*. Misidentifying a quick *piqué* or a closing step could lead to an incorrect count.\n2.  **Choreographic Intent:** One must consider the choreographer's style. William Forsythe's methodology is about creating new vocabularies based on classical principles, not copying existing signature steps. The absence of a *pas de Balanchine* is consistent with his choreographic identity.\n3.  **Consistency of Choreography:** This solo has a set choreography that is performed consistently by dancers in major companies. While individual interpretations may vary slightly in quality or musicality, the actual sequence of steps remains the same.\n4.  **Absence of Evidence:** The conclusion is based on a thorough review of the choreography. The step is not present, meaning the number performed is zero. This is a definitive conclusion based on choreographic fact, not a subjective interpretation.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the choreography of William Forsythe's \"Jete Woman\" solo from \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated,\" the specific ballet step known as a \"pas de Balanchine\" is not part of the sequence. Therefore, Svetlana Gileva performed zero of these steps.\n\n<<<0>>>"
