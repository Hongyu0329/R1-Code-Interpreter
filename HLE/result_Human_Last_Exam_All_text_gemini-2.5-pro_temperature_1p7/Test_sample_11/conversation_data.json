    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the very first statute enacted by the modern State of Israel that explicitly contained the legal concept of \"good faith.\"\n    *   **\"First statute\":** This requires a chronological approach, looking for the earliest law that meets the criteria.\n    *   **\"Modern State of Israel\":** This limits the search to laws passed by the Knesset after Israel's establishment in 1948. Laws from the British Mandate or the Ottoman period are excluded, unless they were re-enacted as new Israeli legislation.\n    *   **\"Explicitly introduce\":** The Hebrew term for good faith, \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*), must be written in the text of the law. A law that implies a duty of fairness without using this specific term would not qualify.\n    *   **\"Concept of 'good faith'\":** This refers to the legal principle that parties to a transaction or legal relationship must act honestly and fairly.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Elimination:**\n    *   The most famous law concerning good faith is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 and 39 made good faith a universal principle in Israeli contract law. However, the question asks for the *first* such law, and 1973 is relatively late. This is likely not the first.\n    *   Israel passed a series of laws on specific types of contracts before the general law of 1973. We should check these. The **Sale Law, 1968**, for example, explicitly requires in Section 6 that obligations be performed in good faith. The **Land Law, 1969**, also mentions good faith in the context of competing transactions (Section 9). Since 1968 predates 1969 and 1973, the Sale Law is a better candidate than these two.\n\n3.  **Deeper Chronological Search:** We need to look for laws enacted even earlier than 1968.\n    *   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957:** This law is a Knesset re-enactment and Hebrew translation of an earlier Mandatory ordinance. Section 28 of this law defines a \"holder in due course\" as someone who took a bill of exchange \"in good faith\" (*be-tom lev*). This is an explicit statutory use of the term and predates the Sale Law by 11 years.\n    *   **Standard Contracts Law, 1964:** This law was designed to protect consumers from unfair clauses in standard form contracts. Section 14 of this law allowed a court to void or modify a \"restrictive term\" if it was, among other things, \"contrary to the requirements of good faith.\"\n\n4.  **Comparing the Early Candidates:**\n    *   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957:** This appears to be the earliest *mention* of the term \"good faith\" in a modern Israeli statute. However, its use is very narrow and technical, inherited directly from English law to define a \"holder in due course.\" It does not introduce good faith as a general principle of conduct or fairness.\n    *   **Standard Contracts Law, 1964:** This law's use of \"good faith\" is much more significant. It introduces the concept as a broad, normative standard that courts can use to review the substance of a contract and ensure fairness. This is arguably the first time the *concept* of good faith was introduced into Israeli law as a powerful, general principle, rather than just a technical requirement in a specific context.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** While the words \"good faith\" first appear in the 1957 Bills of Exchange Ordinance, the **Standard Contracts Law, 1964**, was the first statute to introduce the *concept* of good faith as a broad standard for evaluating fairness in contracts. This marks its true introduction as a foundational principle in Israeli civil law, predating the more famous laws of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Therefore, it is the most accurate answer to the question of which statute first *introduced the concept*.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nFollowing the step-by-step analysis, the final answer is determined.\n\n<<<Standard Contracts Law>>>"
