    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, a list of careful points to consider, and the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Context:** The problem is set within the framework of finite-temperature quantum field theory for a neutral (real) scalar field, $\\phi$. This framework utilizes the imaginary-time (or Matsubara) formalism. The spacetime is Euclidean, where the time coordinate $\\tau$ is treated as imaginary ($t \\to -i\\tau$) and is compactified on a circle of circumference $\\beta = 1/T$, where $T$ is the temperature. The partition function $Z$ is given by a functional integral (or path integral) over all field configurations $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$ that are periodic in $\\tau$ with period $\\beta$.\n\n2.  **Write the Partition Function and Action:** The partition function is given by:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n    For a free neutral scalar field with mass $m$, the Euclidean action $S_E[\\phi]$ is given by the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density, $\\mathcal{L}_E$:\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\mathcal{L}_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n    Here, $d$ is the number of spatial dimensions.\n\n3.  **Define the Inner Product:** The notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ suggests an inner product. In the context of a real scalar field over Euclidean spacetime, the most natural inner product is the standard $L^2$ inner product:\n    $(f, g) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, f(\\tau, \\vec{x}) g(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\n4.  **Identify the Operator D:** The action for a free field theory is quadratic. We can express it in a general quadratic form $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$, where $D$ is a linear differential operator. To find $D$, we perform integration by parts on the kinetic terms in the action.\n    *   $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 = [\\phi \\, \\partial_\\tau \\phi]_0^\\beta - \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\, \\phi(\\partial_\\tau^2 \\phi)$\n    *   $\\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, (\\nabla\\phi)^2 = \\oint (\\phi \\nabla \\phi) \\cdot d\\vec{S} - \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\phi(\\nabla^2 \\phi)$\n    The boundary term in time, $[\\phi \\, \\partial_\\tau \\phi]_0^\\beta$, vanishes because the field $\\phi$ is periodic in $\\tau$ with period $\\beta$. The spatial boundary term vanishes under the standard assumption that the fields decay to zero at spatial infinity.\n    After integration by parts, the action becomes:\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\phi(-\\partial_\\tau^2\\phi) + \\frac{1}{2}\\phi(-\\nabla^2\\phi) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left( [-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2] \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\right)$\n    Comparing this with the form $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$, we can identify the operator $D$:\n    $D = -\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2 = -\\Box_E + m^2$\n    This is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. The term $D_\\phi$ in the question is understood as the action of this operator on the field, $D\\phi$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Inner Product $(\\phi, D\\phi)$:** Using the definitions established above, we can now compute the required inner product:\n    $(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) (D\\phi)(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n    $(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) [-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2] \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\n6.  **Relate the Result to the Action:** By inspecting the expression for the action in Step 4, we find a direct relationship:\n    $(\\phi, D\\phi) = 2 S_E[\\phi]$\n    We can also express this result using the initial form of the action from Step 2, by effectively reversing the integration by parts:\n    $(\\phi, D\\phi) = 2 \\times \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n    $(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2 + m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n    This gives the final explicit expression for the inner product.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The validity of the integration by parts hinges on the boundary conditions. The periodicity of the bosonic field $\\phi$ in imaginary time is crucial for the temporal boundary term to vanish. The assumption that fields decay sufficiently rapidly at spatial infinity is also necessary.\n*   **Real vs. Complex Field:** The calculation is specific to a neutral (real) scalar field. For a complex scalar field, the action and inner product would be defined differently (typically involving a complex conjugate), leading to a similar but distinct result.\n*   **Free Field Theory:** The operator $D$ is defined by the quadratic part of the action, which corresponds to the free theory. If interaction terms (e.g., $\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$) were present in the action, they would not be part of this quadratic structure. The question implicitly concerns the kinetic operator of the theory.\n*   **Notation:** The notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is standard physics shorthand. A mathematician might write it more formally, but the interpretation as $(\\phi, D\\phi)$, where $D$ is the kinetic operator and $(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ is the $L^2$ inner product, is standard in this context.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is twice the Euclidean action for the free scalar field, $2S_E[\\phi]$. When expressed explicitly in terms of the field $\\phi$ and its derivatives, it is given by:\n\n<<<$\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\vec{x} \\, \\left( (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2 + m^2\\phi^2 \\right)$>>>"
