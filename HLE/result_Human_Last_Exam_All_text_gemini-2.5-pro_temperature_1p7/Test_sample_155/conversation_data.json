    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Encoding**\nThe question presents a word encoded using the letters 't' and 'b' arranged in a specific layout within a `\\begin{verbatim}` block. The `verbatim` environment in LaTeX ensures that all characters, spaces, and line breaks are rendered exactly as they appear, preserving horizontal and vertical alignment. This strongly suggests the encoding is visual, forming shapes on a grid.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate a Hypothesis**\nThe most likely hypothesis is that the characters form block letters on a grid. The letter 't' probably represents a filled part of the shape (the \"ink\"), and 'b' represents an empty or background part (the \"paper\"). The spaces in the original text are also part of the background.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Grid**\nWe need to map the 't' and 'b' characters from the input onto a 2D grid based on their row and column positions.\n\nThe input text is:\n```\nt b b t t t t b b b\nb\nb\nb\nt\nb\nt b t t b b b b b b\n                  b\n                  b\n                  t\n                  t\n                  b\nb b t t t t b t b b\n```\nThere are 13 lines, so our grid will have 13 rows. To determine the width, we look at the horizontal positions of the characters. The characters in lines like `t b b ...` are separated by single spaces. The last 'b' on the first line is at character position 19. The indented characters on lines 8-12 are also at position 19. So, the grid is at least 19 columns wide.\n\nLet's create a coordinate map for all the 't' characters (row, column):\n*   **Row 1:** `t` at col 1, `t` at col 7, `t` at col 9, `t` at col 11, `t` at col 13.\n*   **Row 5:** `t` at col 1.\n*   **Row 7:** `t` at col 1, `t` at col 5, `t` at col 7.\n*   **Row 10:** `t` at col 19.\n*   **Row 11:** `t` at col 19.\n*   **Row 13:** `t` at col 5, `t` at col 7, `t` at col 9, `t` at col 11, `t` at col 15.\n\n**Step 4: Visualize the Word**\nNow, let's plot these 't' coordinates as '#' on a grid to make the letters visible. The `b` characters and spaces will be left blank.\n\n    Columns:\n          1   3   5   7   9  11  13  15  17  19\n    Row 1:    #           #   #   #   #\n    Row 2:\n    Row 3:\n    Row 4:\n    Row 5:    #\n    Row 6:\n    Row 7:    #       #   #\n    Row 8:\n    Row 9:\n    Row 10:                                 #\n    Row 11:                                 #\n    Row 12:\n    Row 13:           #   #   #   #       #\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Letters**\nBy looking at the plotted grid, we can discern the shapes of three distinct, though stylized, letters.\n\n*   **First Letter (Columns 1-7):** The `t`s at (1,1), (5,1), and (7,1) form a vertical stem. The `t`s at (7,5) and (7,7) connect to the stem at (7,1) to form a middle bar. This shape is a capital **F**. The top bar is missing in this particular font style.\n    ```\n      #\n      #\n      #--#--#\n    ```\n\n*   **Second Letter (Columns 7-13):** There are `t`s forming the top part of the letter on row 1 (columns 7, 9, 11, 13). There are `t`s forming the bottom of the letter on row 13 (columns 7, 9, 11). These are connected by vertical strokes (implied between the top and bottom). This forms a shape resembling a capital **U**.\n    ```\n      # # # #\n      . . . .\n      . . . .\n      # # # #\n    ```\n\n*   **Third Letter (Columns 13-19):** We see a `t` at (1,13) for the top-left. We have a `t` at (13,15) for a point on the diagonal. We have `t`s at (10,19) and (11,19) for the bottom-right vertical stem. Connecting these points forms a capital **N**.\n    ```\n      #       \n          \\\n           \\\n            #\n            #\n    ```\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Letters**\nAssembling the three identified letters—F, U, and N—gives us the final word.\n\nThe encoded word is FUN.\n\n<<<FUN>>>"
