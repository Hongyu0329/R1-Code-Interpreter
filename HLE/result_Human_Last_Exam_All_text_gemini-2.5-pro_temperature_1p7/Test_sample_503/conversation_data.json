    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category consists of a pair of 1-cells (morphisms) $f: X \\to Y$ and $g: Y \\to X$, and two 2-cells (transformations) called the unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_X \\to g \\circ f$ and the counit $\\varepsilon: f \\circ g \\to \\mathrm{id}_Y$, satisfying the triangle identities. The notation for such an adjunction is $f \\dashv g$, indicating that $f$ is the left adjoint and $g$ is the right adjoint.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ in the simplex category $\\Delta$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the 2-category structure of $\\Delta$**\n*   **0-cells (Objects):** The objects are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. Our objects are $[23]$ and $[37]$.\n*   **1-cells (Morphisms):** A morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is an order-preserving map, i.e., a function such that if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   **2-cells (Transformations):** Since $\\Delta$ is a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$, for any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-cell from $f$ to $g$ if and only if $f$ is pointwise less than or equal to $g$. That is, $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. Because the hom-sets are posets, this 2-cell is unique if it exists.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the definition of an internal adjunction**\nWe are looking for adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$. This means we are counting pairs of morphisms $(f,g)$ where $f: [23] \\to [37]$ is the left adjoint and $g: [37] \\to [23]$ is the right adjoint ($f \\dashv g$).\nThe existence of the unit and counit 2-cells translates to the following pointwise inequalities:\n1.  **Unit** $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[23]} \\to g \\circ f$: This requires $\\mathrm{id}_{[23]}(i) \\le (g \\circ f)(i)$ for all $i \\in [23]$. This simplifies to $i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n2.  **Counit** $\\varepsilon: f \\circ g \\to \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}$: This requires $(f \\circ g)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[37]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [37]$. This simplifies to $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nIn a posetal 2-category, the triangle identities for the unit and counit are automatically satisfied if the 2-cells exist. The two conditions above are precisely the definition of a Galois connection between the posets $([23], \\le)$ and $([37], \\le)$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps**\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint map or the right adjoint map.\n*   A map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a **left adjoint** if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). The posets $[k]$ are complete lattices. The preservation of all suprema is equivalent to preserving the supremum of the empty set, which is the bottom element. Thus, $f$ must be order-preserving and satisfy $f(0) = 0$.\n*   A map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ is a **right adjoint** if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). This is equivalent to preserving the infimum of the empty set, which is the top element. Thus, $g$ must be order-preserving and satisfy $g(n) = m$.\n\nSo, we can count the number of adjunctions by counting the number of left adjoints $f: [23] \\to [37]$ or, equivalently, the number of right adjoints $g: [37] \\to [23]$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of left adjoint maps**\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ that satisfy the condition $f(0)=0$. An order-preserving map is defined by the non-decreasing sequence of its values:\n$f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23)$.\nThe values $f(i)$ are in $[37] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nWith the condition $f(0)=0$, the sequence becomes:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\nThis means we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23, namely $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$, with values chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. Let $k=23$ be the length of the sequence and $N=37$ be the maximum value. The values are chosen from a set of size $N+1 = 38$. The number of such non-decreasing sequences is given by the multiset coefficient formula, also known as \"stars and bars\":\n$$ \\binom{(N+1) + k - 1}{k} = \\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n**Step 5: Verification by counting right adjoint maps**\nTo double-check, let's count the number of right adjoint maps $g: [37] \\to [23]$. These are order-preserving maps that satisfy $g(37)=23$. The sequence of values must satisfy:\n$g(0) \\le g(1) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le g(37) = 23$.\nWe need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 37, namely $g(0), g(1), \\dots, g(36)$, with values chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\nHere, the sequence length is $k=37$, and the values are from a set of size $23+1=24$. The number of such sequences is:\n$$ \\binom{24 + 37 - 1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\nUsing the binomial identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we can see that:\n$$ \\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\nThe results match, confirming our method.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is therefore $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<Binomial[60, 23]>>>"
