    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely identified by a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$. A partition of an integer $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 + \\dots + \\lambda_k = n$, where $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$. For each partition $\\lambda$, there is a conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ obtained by transposing its Young diagram. The dimensions of the irreps corresponding to $\\lambda$ and $\\lambda'$ are equal, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$.\n\nWe need to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ such that the dimension of the corresponding irrep, $d_\\lambda$, is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ can be calculated using the hook-length formula. However, a full calculation for all 1958 partitions of 25 is impractical. We will systematically search for partitions with small dimensions. Dimensions tend to be smaller for partitions whose Young diagrams are \"long and thin\" or \"short and wide\" (hook-like shapes) and larger for diagrams that are more \"square-like\".\n\nWe will organize our search based on the number of boxes outside the first row, $m = n - \\lambda_1$. For a fixed $m$, we consider all partitions of $m$, say $\\mu = (\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\dots)$, to form the partitions of $n=25$ as $\\lambda = (n-m, \\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\dots)$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for $m=0, 1, 2, \\dots$ systematically.**\n\n*   **m=0:** $\\lambda=(25)$. This is the trivial representation. $d_{(25)} = 1$. The conjugate is $\\lambda'=(1^{25})$, the sign representation, for which $d_{(1^{25})} = 1$. Both are < 500,000.\n    *Count: 2*\n\n*   **m=1:** $\\lambda=(24,1)$. The dimension is $d_{(24,1)} = n-1 = 24$. The conjugate is $\\lambda'=(2, 1^{23})$, with $d_{(2,1^{23})}=24$. Both are < 500,000.\n    *Count: 2*\n\n*   **m=2:** Partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$. This and its conjugate $(2^2, 1^{21})$ are valid.\n    *   $\\lambda=(23,1,1)$: This is a hook partition $(n-k, 1^k)$ with $k=2$. $d_{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$. This and its conjugate $(3,1^{22})$ are valid.\n    *Total for m=2: 2 pairs = 4 irreps.*\n\n*   **m=3:** Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$. (Valid pair)\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$: Calculation using the hook-length formula gives $d_{(22,2,1)}=4025$. (Valid pair)\n    *   $\\lambda=(22,1,1,1)$: $d_{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$. (Valid pair)\n    *Total for m=3: 3 pairs = 6 irreps.*\n\n*   **m=4:** Partitions of 4 are (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1,1,1,1). All 5 lead to irreps with dimension < 500,000.\n    *   $d_{(21,4)} = 10,350$.\n    *   $d_{(21,3,1)} = 19,950$.\n    *   $d_{(21,2,2)} = 21,000$.\n    *   $d_{(21,2,1,1)} = 31,625$.\n    *   $d_{(21,1^4)} = 10,626$.\n    *None of these partitions are self-conjugate. Total for m=4: 5 pairs = 10 irreps.*\n\n*   **m=5:** Partitions of 5 are 7. All 7 lead to irreps with dimension < 500,000.\n    *   $d_{(20,5)} = 40,480$.\n    *   $d_{(20,4,1)} = 96,140$.\n    *   $d_{(20,3,2)} = 133,400$.\n    *   $d_{(20,3,1,1)} = 163,625$.\n    *   $d_{(20,2,2,1)} = 194,325$.\n    *   $d_{(20,2,1^3)} = 168,024$.\n    *   $d_{(20,1^5)} = 42,504$.\n    *Total for m=5: 7 pairs = 14 irreps.*\n\n*   **m=6:** Partitions of 6 are 11. We check them:\n    *   $d_{(19,6)} = 123,970$. (Valid)\n    *   $d_{(19,5,1)} = 320,320$. (Valid)\n    *   $d_{(19,4,2)} = 412,125$. (Valid)\n    *   $d_{(19,4,1,1)} = 446,875$. (Valid)\n    *   $d_{(19,3,3)} = 489,125$. (Valid)\n    *   $d_{(19,3,2,1)} \\approx 715,715 > 500,000$. (Invalid)\n    *   $d_{(19,2,2,2)} \\approx 595,350 > 500,000$. (Invalid)\n    *   $d_{(19,2,2,1,1)}$ will be larger. (Invalid)\n    *   $d_{(19,3,1^3)}$ will be larger. (Invalid)\n    *   $d_{(19,2,1^4)} = 442,260$. (Valid)\n    *   $d_{(19,1^6)} = 134,596$. (Valid)\n    *We have found 7 valid partitions for m=6. None are self-conjugate. Total for m=6: 7 pairs = 14 irreps.*\n\n*   **m=7:** Partitions of 7 are 15. The dimensions grow significantly.\n    *   $d_{(18,7)} = \\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480,700 - 177,100 = 303,600$. (Valid)\n    *   $d_{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$. (Valid)\n    *For other partitions of 7, like $(6,1)$, the dimension becomes larger. For instance, $d_{(18,6,1)} \\approx 891,891 > 500,000$. Partitions \"between\" these two extremes will have even larger dimensions.\n    *Total for m=7: 2 pairs = 4 irreps.*\n\n*   **m=8:**\n    *   $d_{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1,081,575 - 480,700 = 600,875 > 500,000$.\n    *   $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471 > 500,000$.\n    *Since the partitions that generally yield the smallest dimensions are already over the limit, no partitions for $m=8$ will work. The same reasoning applies for $m > 8$.\n\n**Step 2: Final Tally.**\n\nWe sum the number of irreps found for each value of $m$:\n*   m=0: 2\n*   m=1: 2\n*   m=2: 4\n*   m=3: 6\n*   m=4: 10\n*   m=5: 14\n*   m=6: 14\n*   m=7: 4\n*   m>=8: 0\n\nTotal number of irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 14 + 4 = 56$.\n\nNone of the identified partitions are self-conjugate (a partition $\\lambda$ is self-conjugate if $\\lambda = \\lambda'$, meaning its Young diagram is symmetric about the main diagonal). All our partitions are \"skewed\", with $\\lambda_1$ being large and the number of parts $\\lambda'_1$ being small, so $\\lambda_1 \\neq \\lambda'_1$. Therefore, each valid partition contributes its conjugate as a distinct partition, and we have correctly counted them in pairs.\n\nFinal Answer is 56.\n\n<<<56>>>"
