    "Answering this question requires analyzing the reduction of a hyperelliptic curve modulo a prime, a topic in arithmetic geometry. The number of double points is a property of the stable reduction of the curve.\n\n**Step 1: Define the curve and the context**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$.\nWe need to find the number of double points (also called nodes) in its stable reduction \"above 2\". This means we are working over the 2-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and considering the reduction over the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\nThe polynomial on the right is $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThe degree of $f(x)$ is $d=5$. Since the polynomial has no repeated roots over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (its discriminant is non-zero), the curve $C$ is smooth over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The genus of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ with $\\deg(f)=d$ is $g = \\lfloor(d-1)/2\\rfloor$.\nFor our curve, the genus is $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\n\n**Step 2: Reduce the curve equation modulo 2**\nWe reduce the coefficients of the polynomial $f(x)$ modulo 2:\n$8 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, $4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$, $1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.\nThe reduced equation is $\\tilde{C}: y^2 \\equiv x^2 \\pmod{2}$.\nIn $\\mathbb{F}_2$, this is $y^2 - x^2 = y^2 + x^2 = (y+x)^2 = 0$.\nThe reduced curve is a double line, which is highly singular (in fact, every point on the line $y+x=0$ is singular). The reduction is \"bad\".\n\n**Step 3: Find a better model for the curve**\nThe initial model gives a very degenerate reduction. To understand the stable reduction, we need to find a \"better\" model of the curve, which we can obtain by a change of variables of the form $x = p^a X$, $y = p^b Y$ (with $p=2$). The goal is to find a model whose reduction is \"as good as possible\".\n\nLet's try the substitution $x = 2^a X$ and $y = 2^b Y$ in the original equation:\n$(2^b Y)^2 = 8(2^a X)^5 + 4(2^a X)^4 + 4(2^a X)^3 + (2^a X)^2 + 8(2^a X)$\n$2^{2b} Y^2 = 2^{3+5a} X^5 + 2^{2+4a} X^4 + 2^{2+3a} X^3 + 2^{2a} X^2 + 2^{3+a} X$\nWe want to choose integers $a, b$ to get a new equation in $X, Y$ which is defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ and has a \"nicer\" reduction. Let's try to make the powers of 2 minimal by dividing by an overall power of 2. We can divide the whole equation by $2^{2a}$:\n$2^{2b-2a} Y^2 = 2^{3+3a} X^5 + 2^{2+2a} X^4 + 2^{2+a} X^3 + X^2 + 2^{3-a} X$.\nFor this equation to be defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, all coefficients must have non-negative 2-adic valuation. This requires $3-a \\ge 0$, so $a \\le 3$.\nLet's choose $a=3$. The equation becomes:\n$2^{2b-6} Y^2 = 2^{12} X^5 + 2^8 X^4 + 2^5 X^3 + X^2 + X$.\nNow, we choose $b$ to make the coefficient of $Y^2$ equal to 1. So, we set $2b-6=0$, which gives $b=3$.\nThe new model $C'$ is given by the equation:\n$Y^2 = 4096X^5 + 256X^4 + 32X^3 + X^2 + X$.\nThis change of variables $(x, y) = (8X, 8Y)$ is an isomorphism over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, so the new curve $C'$ has the same stable reduction as $C$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the reduction of the new model**\nLet $k(X) = 4096X^5 + 256X^4 + 32X^3 + X^2 + X$.\nReducing this equation modulo 2 gives the new reduced curve $\\tilde{C'}$:\n$Y^2 \\equiv X^2 + X \\pmod{2}$.\nThe roots of $X^2+X = X(X+1)$ are $X=0$ and $X=1$, which are distinct in $\\mathbb{F}_2$. A model whose reduced polynomial has distinct roots is often semistable (this is guaranteed for $p>2$; for $p=2$ it's more complex, but this model is better).\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the geometry of the reduced curve $\\tilde{C'}$.**\nThe curve $\\tilde{C'}: Y^2 = X(X+1)$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is a rational curve (it can be parametrized), so its geometric genus is 0. However, it is singular. To find the singular points, we take partial derivatives in the projective plane. The homogeneous equation is $F(X,Y,Z) = Y^2Z + X^2Z + XZ^2 = 0$.\nThe partial derivatives are: $\\partial F/\\partial X = Z^2$, $\\partial F/\\partial Y = 2YZ = 0$, $\\partial F/\\partial Z = Y^2+X^2=(Y+X)^2$.\nA point is singular if all partial derivatives vanish. $Z^2=0 \\implies Z=0$. $(Y+X)^2=0 \\implies Y=X$.\nSo the only singular point is $(X:Y:Z)=(1:1:0)$, which is the point at infinity.\nFor a curve to be stable, its singularities must be ordinary double points (nodes). We analyze the type of singularity at $(1:1:0)$. In the affine chart $Y=1$, the equation becomes $Z = X^2Z+XZ^2$. The singular point is $(X,Z)=(1,0)$. Let $u=X-1, v=Z$. Substituting this gives $v(u^2+uv+v)=0$. This describes two curves meeting tangentially at the origin $(u,v)=(0,0)$, which is a tacnode, not a node.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the number of nodes in the stable reduction.**\nThe stable reduction is obtained by resolving the singularities of the special fiber of a minimal regular model. The model we found ($C'$) is a minimal Weierstrass model, but its special fiber has a non-nodal singularity, so it's not a semistable model.\nThe number of double points in the stable reduction is given by the sum of the delta-invariants ($\\delta_P$) of the singular points of the special fiber of a good model. For $\\tilde{C'}$, there is only one singular point $P=(1:1:0)$.\nThe $\\delta$-invariant of the tacnode singularity can be computed. It measures how far the singularity is from being smooth. For two smooth curves intersecting tangentially at a point $P$, the delta-invariant is the intersection multiplicity $(C_1 \\cdot C_2)_P$. Here, the components are $v=0$ and $u^2+uv+v=0$. The intersection multiplicity is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_2} \\mathbb{F}_2[[u,v]]/(v, u^2+uv+v) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_2} \\mathbb{F}_2[[u]]/(u^2) = 2$.\nSo, $\\delta_P = 2$.\nThe total number of double points in the stable reduction is the sum of these invariants, which is just 2.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency with the genus drop formula.**\nThe stable reduction of a curve is a stable curve, which means it is a (connected) curve whose only singularities are nodes. Let's suppose the stable reduction is an irreducible rational curve ($g_s = 0$) with $\\delta_s$ nodes. The genus drop formula states (in its simplest form):\n$g-1 = (g_s - 1) + \\delta_s$.\nPlugging in our values:\n$2-1 = (0-1) + \\delta_s \\implies 1 = -1 + \\delta_s \\implies \\delta_s=2$.\nThis confirms our result. An irreducible rational curve with 2 nodes is a stable curve of genus 2, so this is a consistent configuration for the stable reduction.\n\nThus, the stable reduction has 2 double points."
