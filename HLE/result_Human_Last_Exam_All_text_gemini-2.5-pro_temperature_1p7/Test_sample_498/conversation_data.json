    "This is a letter sequence puzzle. To solve it, we need to find the underlying pattern.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the letters:** The sequence is Z, X, X, C, V, Y, B, N, _. Most of these letters (Z, X, C, V, B, N) are found together on a standard QWERTY keyboard. They are the first six letters on the bottom row of letters.\n\n2.  **Look for a simple pattern:** The sequence is not alphabetical. The repetition of 'X' and the appearance of 'Y' (from the top row of the keyboard) indicates that the pattern is more complex than simply listing the letters from the keyboard row.\n\n3.  **Test the interleaved sequence hypothesis:** A common technique for complex sequences is to split them into two or more alternating sub-sequences. Let's create two sequences by taking every other letter.\n\n    *   **Sequence 1 (odd-numbered positions):** Z, X, V, B, _\n    *   **Sequence 2 (even-numbered positions):** X, C, Y, N\n\n4.  **Analyze Sequence 1:** The letters are Z, X, V, B. Let's look at their positions on the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard:\n    *   **Z** is the 1st letter.\n    *   **X** is the 2nd letter.\n    *   (C is the 3rd letter)\n    *   **V** is the 4th letter.\n    *   **B** is the 5th letter.\n    *   (N is the 6th letter)\n    *   (M is the 7th letter)\n\n    The pattern for Sequence 1 becomes clear: it takes two consecutive letters from the bottom row (Z, X), skips the next letter (C), then takes the next two consecutive letters (V, B).\n\n5.  **Predict the next letter in Sequence 1:** Following this pattern:\n    *   After taking V and B, we should skip the next letter on the bottom row, which is N.\n    *   After skipping N, we should take the next letter, which is M.\n    *   Since the blank space is in the 9th position (an odd position), it belongs to Sequence 1.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The next letter in the sequence should be **M**.\n\n*(Note: While Sequence 2 (X, C, Y, N) has a less obvious pattern, the clarity and consistency of the pattern in Sequence 1 are strong enough to determine the answer.)*\n\n<<<M>>>"
