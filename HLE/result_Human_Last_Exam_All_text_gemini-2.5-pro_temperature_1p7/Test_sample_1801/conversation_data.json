    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Subject:** Two individuals.\n*   **Qualification:** They must be Nobel laureates.\n*   **Context:** They were featured in a commercial.\n*   **Company:** The commercial was for Enron.\n*   **Year:** The commercial aired in 2000.\n*   **Tagline:** The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n\n**Step 2: Research the Enron \"Ask Why\" Campaign**\nIn 2000, just before its scandalous collapse, Enron launched a major advertising campaign with the tagline \"Ask Why.\" The campaign aimed to rebrand the company from a simple energy provider to an innovative, forward-thinking global corporation. The commercials were notable for featuring various celebrities and intellectuals who would look at the camera and simply say the word \"Why?\".\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Nobel Laureates Involved**\nThe campaign featured several well-known figures. Research into the cast of these commercials reveals the names of the public figures involved. The goal is to cross-reference this list with a list of Nobel Prize winners.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the First Laureate**\nOne of the individuals featured was **Amartya Sen**.\n*   **Who is he?** An Indian economist and philosopher.\n*   **Nobel Prize:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1998** for his contributions to welfare economics.\n*   **Careful Point:** Since he won his prize in 1998, he was already a Nobel laureate when he appeared in the Enron commercial in 2000.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Second Laureate**\nAnother intellectual featured in the campaign was **Paul Krugman**.\n*   **Who is he?** An American economist and public intellectual.\n*   **Nobel Prize:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008** for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is a crucial detail. At the time the commercial aired in 2000, Paul Krugman was a prominent economist but not yet a Nobel laureate. However, the question asks \"Which two Nobel laureates were featured...\", which refers to their current status. Since he won the prize in 2008, he is now a Nobel laureate and thus fits the criteria of the question.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize and Finalize the Answer**\nThe two individuals who are Nobel laureates and appeared in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" campaign are Amartya Sen and Paul Krugman. The fact that Enron, a company that would soon collapse due to massive fraud, enlisted such respected thinkers (one a laureate at the time, the other a future laureate) is a key reason the campaign is now considered \"infamous\" and a classic example of corporate hubris.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Amartya Sen>>>"
