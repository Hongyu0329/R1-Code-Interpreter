The maximally parsimonious model is a linear relationship between $y$ and the square root of $x$, given by the equation $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1\sqrt{x}$. The estimated parameter values, rounded to three significant digits, are $\beta_0 = -1.33$ and $\beta_1 = 1.27$. The model is: $y = -1.33 + 1.27\sqrt{x}$.
