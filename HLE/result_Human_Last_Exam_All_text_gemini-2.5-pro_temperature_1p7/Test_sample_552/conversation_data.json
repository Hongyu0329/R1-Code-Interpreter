    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific work:** The question refers to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The official title of this paper is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). This was one of his four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers.\n\n2.  **Understand the context:** This paper was published in May 1905. During this same period, Einstein was completing his doctoral dissertation, \"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\" (\"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\"), which he submitted to the University of Zurich in July 1905. The two works are very closely related in their subject matter and theoretical foundations.\n\n3.  **Examine the paper's citations and connections:** A careful point is to check if the citation is *directly* in the paper or in a closely related work that Einstein himself connects to the paper.\n    *   In the very first footnote of his Brownian motion paper, Einstein explicitly states: \"The present paper is closely related to a dissertation submitted by me to the University of Zürich.\"\n    *   This statement directly links the paper to his dissertation, making the dissertation's acknowledgements and citations relevant to understanding the intellectual origins of the paper.\n\n4.  **Analyze the dissertation's acknowledgements:** In the introductory section of his dissertation, Einstein makes a direct attribution to the source of his ideas. He writes (translated from German):\n    > \"The main results of the following investigation have already been published in a different form. The impetus for this work as well as the main ideas and methods are based upon the **lectures of Herr Professor Dr. A. Kleiner**...\"\n\n5.  **Identify the cited individual:** The person whose lectures Einstein cited as providing the \"impetus\" and \"main ideas\" for his work is **Professor Dr. Alfred Kleiner**.\n\n6.  **Clarify the relationship:** Alfred Kleiner was a professor of experimental physics at the University of Zurich. More importantly, he was Albert Einstein's doctoral advisor. He played a crucial role in guiding Einstein's early research that culminated in both the dissertation and the landmark paper on Brownian motion.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy explicitly linking his 1905 Brownian motion paper to his doctoral dissertation, and then crediting the lectures of his advisor in that dissertation, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of **Alfred Kleiner** as being foundational to his work.\n\n<<<Alfred Kleiner>>>"
