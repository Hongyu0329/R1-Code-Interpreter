    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n*   **Manhattan Lattice**: This is a 2D square grid where points have integer coordinates (x, y). Movement is restricted to adjacent vertices, either horizontally or vertically. Each vertex has a degree of 4.\n*   **n-step Walk**: A sequence of n+1 vertices, starting from a point $v_0$, where each subsequent vertex $v_{i+1}$ is adjacent to the previous one, $v_i$. The length of the walk is n, the number of steps or edges.\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW)**: A walk in which no vertex is visited more than once. The path does not intersect itself.\n*   **a(n)**: The function representing the total number of distinct n-step SAWs starting from a fixed point (e.g., the origin). By symmetry, this number is independent of the starting point on an infinite lattice.\n\nThe goal is to find the specific value of a(10).\n\n### Step 2: Method of Calculation - Recursive Enumeration\nThere is no simple closed-form formula for a(n). The value must be found by enumeration. A common method is a recursive approach where we extend existing walks one step at a time.\nThe number of (n+1)-step walks can be calculated by summing the number of valid, non-revisiting, forward moves from the endpoint of every possible n-step walk.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation for Small Values of n\nLet's calculate the first few terms of the sequence a(n) to illustrate the process. We assume the walk starts at (0,0).\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    From the origin, there are 4 possible moves: North (0,1), East (1,0), South (0,-1), West (-1,0). All are valid 1-step SAWs.\n    *   a(1) = 4\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    For each of the 4 one-step walks, we can take a second step. The only restriction is that we cannot immediately move back to the origin. For example, from (1,0), we can move to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1), but not back to (0,0). So, there are 3 valid choices for the second step.\n    *   a(2) = a(1) * 3 = 4 * 3 = 12\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    Let's consider the 12 two-step walks. They fall into two shape categories:\n    1.  \"Straight\" walks (e.g., (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0)). There are 4 such walks.\n    2.  \"Bent\" walks (e.g., (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1)). There are 4 (initial directions) * 2 (turns) = 8 such walks.\n    For any walk in either category, the endpoint has three valid moves. For the straight walk ending at (2,0), the neighbors are (1,0), (3,0), (2,1), (2,-1). The move to (1,0) is forbidden. For the bent walk ending at (1,1), the neighbors are (1,0), (2,1), (1,2), (0,1). The move to (1,0) is forbidden. In both cases, the endpoint is not adjacent to any past vertices other than the immediately preceding one. So, there are 3 choices.\n    *   a(3) = 12 * 3 = 36\n\n### Step 4: Increased Complexity and \"Closure\" Events\nThis simple multiplication breaks down when the walk can \"turn back\" on itself, creating a shape where the endpoint is adjacent to a vertex other than its direct predecessor.\n\n*   **a(4):**\n    We analyze the 36 three-step walks.\n    1.  Most walks are \"open\", meaning their endpoint is only adjacent to the previous vertex in the path. These will have 3 valid extensions.\n    2.  Some walks form a \"U\" shape (3 sides of a square), for example, (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1).\n    Let's count these \"U-shaped\" paths. There are 4 choices for the first step, 2 choices for the first turn, and 1 choice for the next step forward, totaling 4 * 2 * 1 = 8 such paths.\n    For a U-shaped path ending at (0,1), its neighbors are (0,0), (1,1), (-1,1), and (0,2). The path's vertices are {(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)}. The path contains two of the endpoint's neighbors: the preceding vertex (1,1) and the starting vertex (0,0). This leaves only 4 - 2 = 2 valid choices for the next step.\n    *   Number of U-shaped 3-step walks = 8. Contribution to a(4) = 8 * 2 = 16.\n    *   Number of \"open\" 3-step walks = 36 - 8 = 28. Contribution to a(4) = 28 * 3 = 84.\n    *   a(4) = 16 + 84 = 100.\n\n*   **a(5):**\n    This process continues. We must classify the 100 four-step paths based on how many valid extensions each one has (1, 2, or 3).\n    *   Paths creating a closure, reducing choices from 3 to 2: We need to find 4-step paths where the endpoint $v_4$ is adjacent to a non-predecessor vertex, $v_1$ or $v_2$ (it cannot be adjacent to $v_0$ in 4 steps). Analysis shows there are 16 such paths (e.g., a path with moves East-East-North-West). These 16 paths have 2 choices for the next step.\n    *   The remaining 100 - 16 = 84 paths have 3 choices for the next step.\n    *   a(5) = (16 paths * 2 choices) + (84 paths * 3 choices) = 32 + 252 = 284.\n\n### Step 5: Acquiring the Final Answer for a(10)\nAs n increases, the number of different path configurations grows explosively. Manually classifying all paths for each step becomes computationally infeasible. For n=9, there are 16,268 paths to classify to find a(10).\n\nThis is a well-studied problem, and the values of a(n) for small n have been determined using computer-based enumeration algorithms (like the backtracking algorithm). The sequence is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A001411.\n\nConsulting this established resource, the sequence is:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\n<<<44100>>>"
