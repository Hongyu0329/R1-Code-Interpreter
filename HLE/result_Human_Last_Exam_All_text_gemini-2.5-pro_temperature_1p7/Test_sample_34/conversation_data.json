    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited Jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Scenario\n\n*   **Game:** 100BB rake-free cash game.\n    *   **100BB effective stack:** This is the standard stack depth, and strategies are well-established for it.\n    *   **Rake-free:** This is a key detail. Rake is the fee taken by the house from each pot. In a normal game, you must open a hand strong enough to beat both your opponents *and* the rake. In a rake-free game, the threshold for profitability is lower, meaning you can open a wider range of hands than you normally would.\n    *   **Cash game:** Opponents are assumed to be unknown but competent, playing a GTO-based (Game Theory Optimal) strategy.\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN).\n    *   The button is the most profitable position in poker because you are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street (flop, turn, river). This positional advantage allows you to realize your equity much more effectively and to bluff more successfully. Consequently, you should play the widest range of hands from the button.\n*   **Action:** Open to 2.5x.\n    *   This is a standard open-raise size. The specific size doesn't dramatically change the *range* of hands you open, but it affects the pot size and subsequent strategy.\n*   **Question:** What is the \"worst suited jack you should open\"?\n    *   This asks for the weakest hand of the type JXs (Jack-X-suited) that is still considered a standard, profitable open-raise. This is the hand at the absolute bottom of the JXs opening range. Any JXs hand weaker than this would be a fold.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating Suited Jack Hands\n\nLet's list all the suited Jack hands from best to worst based on their general strength and playability.\n\n1.  **JTs:** A premium suited connector. It can make the nut straight and strong flushes. Very strong.\n2.  **J9s:** A suited one-gapper. Still very strong, with excellent straight and flush potential.\n3.  **J8s:** A suited two-gapper. Playability for straights decreases slightly, but it's still a very solid hand.\n4.  **J7s:** A suited three-gapper.\n5.  **J6s:** A suited four-gapper.\n6.  **J5s:** This hand is interesting. While it has a large gap, the '5' allows it to connect with low boards to make \"wheel\" straights (A-2-3-4-5). This gives it slightly more playability than hands like J6s or J4s in certain situations.\n7.  **J4s, J3s, J2s:** These hands have very poor straight potential. Their value comes almost exclusively from their flush potential and the high-card value of the Jack.\n\nThe general ranking by raw strength and playability is: **JTs > J9s > J8s > J7s > J6s > J5s > J4s > J3s > J2s**. The worst hand in this group is **J2s**.\n\n### Step 3: Consulting GTO Principles\n\nNow, we need to determine which of these hands are profitable opens.\n\n*   **Button Opening Range:** A standard GTO opening range from the button in a 6-max game is very wide, typically around 45-50% of all hands.\n*   **Inclusion of JXs:** Due to the massive positional advantage and the playability of suited hands (making flushes), a standard GTO chart for the button includes *all* suited Aces, all suited Kings, all suited Queens, and **all suited Jacks**.\n*   **Impact of \"Rake-Free\":** As established, the absence of rake makes opening even more profitable. If a hand like J2s is a standard open in a game *with* rake (which it is), it is definitively a profitable open in a game *without* rake. Its expected value (EV) will be even higher.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on GTO principles, a player on the button should open every single suited Jack, from JTs down to J2s. The question asks for the \"worst\" one that you *should* open. Since all of them are considered standard opens, the worst one is the hand with the lowest raw strength and EV. That hand is **J2s**. It is the hand at the bottom of the suited Jack hierarchy that is still included in a standard button opening range.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
