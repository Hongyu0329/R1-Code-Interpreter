    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure that allows coloring the figure-eight knot.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand Knot Coloring and its Algebraic Structure**\n\nKnot coloring is a method used to distinguish knots from one another. The most common type is **Wirtinger coloring**.\n\n1.  **Colors:** We use a set of *n* colors, typically represented by the integers $\\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$.\n2.  **Arcs:** In a knot diagram, the continuous segments of the knot between crossings are called arcs. Each arc is assigned a color.\n3.  **Coloring Rule:** At each crossing, there is one over-strand and two under-strands. Let the color of the over-strand be *x*, and the colors of the two under-strands be *y* and *z*. The rule is that the colors must satisfy the equation:\n    $2x \\equiv y + z \\pmod{n}$\n4.  **Non-trivial Coloring:** A coloring is considered non-trivial if at least two different colors are used. The existence of a non-trivial *n*-coloring is a knot invariant.\n5.  **Algebraic Structure:** The set of colors $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$ together with the operations of addition and multiplication modulo *n* forms the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_n$. The coloring conditions are a system of linear equations over this ring. More specifically, the set of colors with the operation $a \\triangleright b = 2b - a \\pmod{n}$ forms an algebraic structure called a **dihedral quandle**. The question asks for the smallest size *n* of such a structure that permits a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot.\n\n**Step 2: Set up the Coloring Equations for the Figure-Eight Knot**\n\nThe figure-eight knot (knot 4₁) is the simplest non-trivial knot after the trefoil. It has 4 crossings. Let's label the four arcs in its standard diagram as $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$.\n\nWe can write down one equation for each of the four crossings:\n\n*   **Crossing 1:** Arc $a_1$ goes over arcs $a_2$ and $a_4$. The equation is $2a_1 \\equiv a_2 + a_4 \\pmod{n}$.\n*   **Crossing 2:** Arc $a_2$ goes over arcs $a_1$ and $a_3$. The equation is $2a_2 \\equiv a_1 + a_3 \\pmod{n}$.\n*   **Crossing 3:** Arc $a_3$ goes over arcs $a_2$ and $a_4$. (Note: In the standard diagram, $a_4$ goes over $a_3$ and $a_2$). Let's use a standard labeling.\n    *   Crossing A: $a_1$ over $a_2, a_4 \\implies 2a_1 - a_2 - a_4 = 0$\n    *   Crossing B: $a_2$ under $a_1, a_3$ (so $a_3$ is over) $\\implies 2a_3 - a_1 - a_2 = 0$\n    *   Crossing C: $a_4$ over $a_1, a_3 \\implies 2a_4 - a_1 - a_3 = 0$\n    *   Crossing D: $a_3$ under $a_2, a_4$ (so $a_2$ is over) $\\implies 2a_2 - a_3 - a_4 = 0$\n    This set of equations depends heavily on the specific labeling. Let's use a confirmed one.\n\nA standard set of equations for the figure-eight knot is:\n1.  $2a_1 - a_2 - a_4 = 0 \\pmod{n}$\n2.  $-a_1 + 2a_2 - a_3 = 0 \\pmod{n}$\n3.  $-a_2 - a_3 + 2a_4 = 0 \\pmod{n}$\n4.  $-a_1 + 2a_3 - a_4 = 0 \\pmod{n}$\n\nThis system can be represented by the matrix equation $M\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{0}$, where $\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)^T$ and M is the **coloring matrix**:\n$M = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 2 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 3: Find the Condition for Non-trivial Colorability**\n\nA knot is non-trivially *n*-colorable if and only if the determinant of its coloring matrix is congruent to 0 modulo *n* (det(M) $\\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}$), and there exists a solution other than $a_1=a_2=...=c$.\nFor any knot, the sum of the columns of its coloring matrix is the zero vector, which means its determinant is always 0 over the integers. This corresponds to the existence of trivial colorings (where all arcs have the same color).\n\nTo find the condition for *non-trivial* colorings, we use the **determinant of the knot**, which is a knot invariant. The determinant of a knot, det(K), is defined as the absolute value of the determinant of any submatrix formed by removing one row and one column from the coloring matrix M.\n\nLet's compute this value for the figure-eight knot by removing the last row and last column from M:\n$M' = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\ndet(M') = $2 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} + 0$\ndet(M') = $2 \\cdot (2(-1) - (-1)(-1)) + 1 \\cdot ((-1)(-1) - (-1)(0))$\ndet(M') = $2 \\cdot (-2 - 1) + 1 \\cdot (1 - 0)$\ndet(M') = $2 \\cdot (-3) + 1 = -6 + 1 = -5$\n\nThe determinant of the figure-eight knot is det(K) = |-5| = 5.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Smallest Number of Colors**\n\nA knot with determinant det(K) is non-trivially *n*-colorable if and only if *n* has a common factor with det(K) greater than 1. That is, $\\text{gcd}(\\text{det}(K), n) > 1$.\n\nFor the figure-eight knot, we have det(K) = 5. We need to find the smallest integer *n* > 1 such that:\n$\\text{gcd}(5, n) > 1$\n\nSince 5 is a prime number, any integer *n* that has a common divisor with 5 greater than 1 must be a multiple of 5. The smallest such integer *n* (which represents the number of colors, or the number of elements in our algebraic structure) is 5.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe smallest integer *n* > 1 for which the figure-eight knot is *n*-colorable is 5. This means the smallest algebraic structure (the dihedral quandle $\\mathbb{Z}_5$ with the coloring operation) that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot has 5 elements."
