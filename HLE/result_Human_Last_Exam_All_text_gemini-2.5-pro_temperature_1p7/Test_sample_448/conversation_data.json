    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. In order of increasing atomic number, they are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*   Oganesson (Og)\n\n**Step 2: Consider the Context**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas \"on Earth\" as a percentage of \"all terrestrial matter\" in \"2002\".\n*   **\"On Earth\" / \"Terrestrial Matter\":** This requires us to consider the natural abundance of these elements in the Earth's atmosphere, crust, and oceans. The primary reservoir for these gases is the atmosphere.\n*   **\"2002\":** The composition of Earth's stable gases does not change significantly over short periods like decades. Therefore, data from around that time or even current data is valid.\n*   **\"Rarest\":** This means the one with the lowest concentration or total mass.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Abundance of Each Noble Gas**\n\n*   **Oganesson (Og):** Oganesson is a synthetic element. It has only been created in laboratories and does not exist naturally on Earth. Its natural abundance is zero. Therefore, it is not a component of natural terrestrial matter. We should focus on naturally occurring noble gases.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** This is the most abundant of the noble gases on Earth, making up about 0.934% (9340 parts per million, ppm) of the Earth's atmosphere by volume.\n\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant, with an atmospheric concentration of about 18.2 ppm.\n\n*   **Helium (He):** Its atmospheric concentration is about 5.2 ppm. Although it is continuously produced in the Earth's crust by radioactive decay, it is light enough to escape Earth's gravity, which keeps its atmospheric concentration low.\n\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Its concentration in the atmosphere is about 1.1 ppm.\n\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Xenon is significantly rarer than the above gases, with an atmospheric concentration of only about 0.09 ppm (or 90 parts per billion).\n\n*   **Radon (Rn):** Radon is a unique case because it is radioactive. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. It is constantly being formed by the radioactive decay of radium in the Earth's crust and constantly decaying away. Because of this extremely short half-life, it never accumulates in the atmosphere. Its concentration is incredibly small and highly variable, but on average, it is estimated to be about 1 part in 10^21 by volume. This is orders of magnitude lower than Xenon's concentration.\n\n**Step 4: Compare and Conclude**\n\nLet's list the approximate atmospheric abundances of the naturally occurring noble gases from most to least abundant:\n1.  **Argon (Ar):** 9,340 ppm\n2.  **Neon (Ne):** 18.2 ppm\n3.  **Helium (He):** 5.2 ppm\n4.  **Krypton (Kr):** 1.1 ppm\n5.  **Xenon (Xe):** 0.09 ppm\n6.  **Radon (Rn):** ~0.000000000000001 ppm (or 1 part per 10^21)\n\nFrom this comparison, it is clear that Radon's steady-state concentration is vastly lower than that of any other noble gas, including Xenon.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   **Included all noble gases:** Yes, from Helium to Oganesson.\n*   **Correctly handled synthetic vs. natural:** Yes, Oganesson was excluded as it's not naturally occurring.\n*   **Correctly handled radioactive vs. stable:** Yes, Radon's short half-life and its resulting minuscule steady-state concentration were the key factors.\n*   **Compared concentrations accurately:** Yes, the ranking of abundance is correct and highlights the extreme rarity of Radon compared to Xenon.\n*   **Relevance of the year 2002:** Correctly identified as not changing the outcome.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nThe analysis shows that among the naturally occurring noble gases, Radon is present in the smallest amount on Earth at any given time due to its radioactive nature and very short half-life.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
