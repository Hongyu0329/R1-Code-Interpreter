    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\n\n*   **Goal:** Construct a \"full spectral volume\". This is a three-dimensional (3D) data cube, typically represented as `f(x, y, λ)`, where `(x, y)` are spatial coordinates and `λ` is the wavelength.\n*   **Input:** \"A single image\". This means all the information needed for the 3D reconstruction must be captured in one two-dimensional (2D) snapshot on a detector (e.g., a CCD or CMOS sensor).\n*   **Method:** \"Computed tomography\". This tells us the reconstruction will use principles analogous to medical CT scans, where a 3D object is reconstructed from a series of 2D projections.\n*   **Tool:** \"Diffraction gratings\". These are the optical components used to create the necessary \"projections\" by dispersing light into its constituent colors (wavelengths).\n*   **Question:** What is the *minimum* number of these gratings required to make the reconstruction possible?\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Analogy to Computed Tomography (CT)**\n\nIn standard medical CT, an X-ray source and a 1D detector rotate around a patient to capture multiple \"projections\" (line integrals) through a 2D slice of the body. To reconstruct the 2D slice, you need projections from many different angles. A single projection is not enough information. The absolute minimum for any kind of tomographic reconstruction is to have projections along at least two different (non-parallel) directions.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the CT Analogy to Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS)**\n\nIn Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), the \"object\" we want to reconstruct is the 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)`. The \"image\" we capture is a 2D projection on a detector `g(u, v)`. The diffraction grating's job is to perform the projection.\n\n*   **How does a grating project the data?** A grating takes the light from a point `(x, y)` in the scene and disperses it, spreading its spectrum `(λ)` out into a line or pattern on the detector.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Case with One Diffraction Grating**\n\nLet's consider a single, simple (1D) diffraction grating. It will disperse light along only one axis. For instance, a horizontally ruled grating will spread the spectrum of each point source horizontally on the detector.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The Ambiguity Problem.** Imagine two points in the original scene, Point A at `(x1, y1)` and Point B at `(x1, y2)`. They are in the same vertical column. The single horizontal grating will disperse the spectrum of Point A horizontally, and the spectrum of Point B horizontally. On the detector, these two dispersed spectra will land on top of each other, completely overlapping. There is no information in the final 2D image to distinguish how much of the spectrum came from Point A versus Point B.\n*   **Conclusion for one grating:** This fundamental loss of information is analogous to having only one projection angle in CT. You cannot uniquely reconstruct the original object. Therefore, one diffraction grating is insufficient.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Case with Two Diffraction Gratings**\n\nTo solve the ambiguity problem, we need to introduce dispersion in a second direction. The simplest way to do this is to add a second grating, oriented perpendicularly to the first one (e.g., one horizontal, one vertical). This is called a \"crossed grating\" system.\n\n*   **How does this help?** A crossed grating system produces a 2D pattern of diffraction orders. For each point `(x, y)` in the scene, instead of a single dispersed line, you get a 2D array of spectrally dispersed spots on the detector.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Multiple Projections.** Each of these diffraction orders (e.g., the one dispersed horizontally, the one dispersed vertically, the one dispersed diagonally) is a different mathematical \"projection\" of the original 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)`.\n*   **Conclusion for two gratings:** Because we now have multiple, different projections encoded onto the single 2D image (analogous to having CT scans from multiple angles), the system of equations becomes solvable. The tomographic reconstruction algorithm can use these different views to \"triangulate\" the spectral information back to its original `(x, y)` location. This provides the minimum necessary information for reconstruction.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate Other Options**\n\n*   **Three or more gratings:** While using more gratings (e.g., overlaid at 0, 60, and 120 degrees) would create even more projections and likely lead to a higher-quality, more robust reconstruction, it is not the *minimum* number required. The principle of reconstruction is enabled as soon as you have two non-collinear dispersion directions.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOne diffraction grating is insufficient due to a fundamental loss of spatial information. Two crossed diffraction gratings are the minimum required to provide dispersion in two dimensions, which in turn generates the multiple, distinct \"projections\" necessary for a tomographic reconstruction algorithm to solve for the 3D spectral data cube.\n\n<<<B>>>"
