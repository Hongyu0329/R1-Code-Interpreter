The solutions are $z = 1$, $z = -1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_n = iy_n$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \ldots$, where $y_n$ is the unique negative real solution to the equation $-y = \exp\left(-y\left(\frac{\pi}{2}-2n\pi\right)\right)$. These imaginary solutions can be expressed using the Lambert W-function as $z_n = -i \frac{W_0\left(\left(2n-\frac{1}{2}\right)\pi\right)}{\left(2n-\frac{1}{2}\right)\pi}$.
