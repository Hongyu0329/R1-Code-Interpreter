In the framework of the $\epsilon = 4-d$ expansion for a single-component scalar field theory, the specific heat critical exponent $\alpha$ scales linearly with the deviation of the dimensionality $d$ from the upper critical dimension of four. To first order in $\epsilon$, the quantitative relationship is given by the formula $\alpha \approx \frac{4-d}{6}$.
