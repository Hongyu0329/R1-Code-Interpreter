    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 distinct two-dimensional crystallographic groups that describe all possible repeating patterns on a plane.\n*   **Point Group (Crystal Class):** For a given wallpaper group, the point group is the set of symmetry operations (rotations, reflections) that leave at least one point fixed. It describes the symmetry of the pattern's motif. According to the crystallographic restriction theorem, only point groups with rotation orders 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 are allowed in a crystal lattice.\n*   **Order of a Group:** This is simply the number of elements (i.e., distinct symmetry operations) in the group.\n\nThe question asks us to identify which of the 17 wallpaper groups have a point group containing exactly two symmetry operations.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the possible 2D crystallographic point groups and their orders**\n\nThere are 10 possible point groups for 2D crystals. Let's list them and find their orders.\n1.  **1** (C₁): Contains only the identity operation. Order = 1.\n2.  **2** (C₂): Contains identity and a 180° rotation. Order = 2.\n3.  **m** (D₁): Contains identity and a single reflection. Order = 2.\n4.  **3** (C₃): Contains identity, 120° rotation, and 240° rotation. Order = 3.\n5.  **2mm** (D₂): Contains identity, 180° rotation, and two perpendicular reflections. Order = 4.\n6.  **4** (C₄): Contains identity, 90°, 180°, and 270° rotations. Order = 4.\n7.  **3m** (D₃): Contains symmetries of an equilateral triangle. Order = 6.\n8.  **6** (C₆): Contains rotations by multiples of 60°. Order = 6.\n9.  **4mm** (D₄): Contains symmetries of a square. Order = 8.\n10. **6mm** (D₆): Contains symmetries of a regular hexagon. Order = 12.\n\nFrom this list, we see that there are two point groups of order 2: **2** and **m**.\n\n### **Step 3: List the 17 wallpaper groups and identify the point group for each**\n\nNow, we need to find which of the 17 wallpaper groups correspond to the point groups **2** and **m**. We can categorize the wallpaper groups by their crystal system.\n\n*   **Oblique System**\n    *   `p1`: Point group is **1** (Order 1)\n    *   `p2`: Point group is **2** (Order 2)\n\n*   **Rectangular System**\n    *   `pm`: Point group is **m** (Order 2)\n    *   `pg`: Point group is **m** (Order 2) - Even though it has glide reflections, its macroscopic point symmetry is that of a single reflection.\n    *   `cm`: Point group is **m** (Order 2)\n    *   `p2mm`: Point group is **2mm** (Order 4)\n    *   `p2mg`: Point group is **2mm** (Order 4)\n    *   `p2gg`: Point group is **2mm** (Order 4)\n    *   `c2mm`: Point group is **2mm** (Order 4)\n\n*   **Square System**\n    *   `p4`: Point group is **4** (Order 4)\n    *   `p4mm`: Point group is **4mm** (Order 8)\n    *   `p4gm`: Point group is **4mm** (Order 8)\n\n*   **Hexagonal System**\n    *   `p3`: Point group is **3** (Order 3)\n    *   `p3m1`: Point group is **3m** (Order 6)\n    *   `p31m`: Point group is **3m** (Order 6)\n    *   `p6`: Point group is **6** (Order 6)\n    *   `p6mm`: Point group is **6mm** (Order 12)\n\n### **Step 4: Count the relevant wallpaper groups**\n\nWe now count the wallpaper groups whose point group is either **2** or **m** (since both have order 2).\n\n1.  **p2** (has point group **2**)\n2.  **pm** (has point group **m**)\n3.  **pg** (has point group **m**)\n4.  **cm** (has point group **m**)\n\nThere are a total of 4 such wallpaper groups.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, we have identified that there are four wallpaper groups whose associated point group has an order of 2. These groups are p2, pm, pg, and cm.\n\n<<<4>>>"
