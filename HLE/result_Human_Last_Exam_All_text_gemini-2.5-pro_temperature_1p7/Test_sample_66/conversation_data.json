    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix derived from the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the flag of Tonga\nThe flag of Tonga has a simple but distinct design:\n1.  The main field of the flag is red.\n2.  In the upper-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle.\n3.  Inside this white rectangle, there is a red cross.\n4.  The cross is a \"couped cross,\" which means its arms do not extend to the edges of the white rectangle.\n\n### Step 2: Define the matrix `M`\nWe construct a matrix `M` that represents a pixelated image of the flag.\n*   Every red pixel is assigned the value `a`.\n*   Every white pixel is assigned the value `b`.\nThe matrix `M` will therefore only contain the values `a` and `b`. The question asks for the *maximal possible* rank, which means we can choose the values of `a` and `b` to maximize the rank.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the rows of the matrix `M`\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's analyze the structure of the rows of `M`. We can identify two distinct regions of the flag that produce different row patterns.\n\nLet the total dimensions of the matrix be `H x W`. Let the canton have dimensions `h x w`.\n\n**Region 1: Rows that do not pass through the canton**\nAny row below the canton (from row `h+1` to `H`) passes entirely through the red field of the flag. All pixels in these rows are red.\n*   The corresponding row vectors are `(a, a, a, ..., a)`.\nAll of these `H-h` rows are identical (or zero if `a=0`).\n\n**Region 2: Rows that pass through the canton**\nThese are the first `h` rows of the matrix. A row in this region passes through the canton on the left (`w` columns) and the red field on the right (`W-w` columns).\nWe need to further break this down based on the canton's design (a red cross on a white field).\n\n*   **Sub-region 2a: Rows passing through the horizontal bar of the red cross.**\n    These rows pass through a completely red section within the canton. Combined with the red field to the right of the canton, every pixel in these rows is red.\n    *   The corresponding row vectors are `(a, a, a, ..., a)`.\n    *   This is the same type of row vector as in Region 1.\n\n*   **Sub-region 2b: Rows passing through the white part of the canton.**\n    These rows correspond to the parts of the canton above and below the horizontal bar of the cross. A row in this sub-region has:\n    1.  A section of white pixels (value `b`).\n    2.  A section for the vertical bar of the red cross (value `a`).\n    3.  Another section of white pixels (value `b`).\n    4.  The rest of the row, to the right of the canton, is the red field (value `a`).\n    Because the cross is couped, the sections of white pixels at the beginning and end of the canton part of the row are guaranteed to exist.\n    *   The corresponding row vector has the structure: `(b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, | a, ..., a)`.\n    *   All rows in this sub-region (both above and below the horizontal bar) are identical.\n\n### Step 4: Identify the distinct row types\nFrom the analysis in Step 3, we see that the entire matrix `M` is composed of only **two** distinct types of rows:\n1.  **Type 1 (The \"all-red\" row):** `v₁ = (a, a, ..., a)`\n2.  **Type 2 (The \"canton-white\" row):** `v₂ = (b, ..., b, a, ..., a, b, ..., b, a, ..., a)`\n\nThe row space of the matrix `M` is the vector space spanned by these two vectors, i.e., `span{v₁, v₂}`.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the maximal rank\nThe rank of `M` is the dimension of its row space, `dim(span{v₁, v₂})`. The dimension of the space spanned by two vectors can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\n*   **Rank 0:** This occurs only if both `v₁` and `v₂` are the zero vector. This requires `a = 0` and `b = 0`.\n*   **Rank 1:** This occurs if `v₁` and `v₂` are linearly dependent (and not both zero). This happens if one vector is a scalar multiple of the other (e.g., `v₂ = k * v₁`).\n    *   If `v₂ = k * v₁`, then by comparing the components, we must have `b = k*a` and `a = k*a`.\n    *   If `a ≠ 0`, then `a = k*a` implies `k = 1`. This leads to `b = a`. So, if `a = b ≠ 0`, the two row types are identical, and the rank is 1.\n    *   If `a = 0`, then `v₁` is the zero vector. `v₂` becomes `(b, ..., b, 0, ..., 0, b, ..., b, 0, ..., 0)`. As long as `b ≠ 0`, `v₂` is not the zero vector. The set `{0, v₂}` is linearly dependent, and the rank is 1.\n*   **Rank 2:** This occurs if `v₁` and `v₂` are linearly independent. This happens when the conditions for Rank 0 and Rank 1 are not met. Based on the above, the vectors are linearly independent if `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`.\n\nTo find the **maximal possible rank**, we need to see if it's possible to choose `a` and `b` to make the rank 2. We can choose values that satisfy `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`. For example:\n*   Let `a = 1` and `b = 0`.\n    *   `v₁ = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1)`\n    *   `v₂ = (0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0, 1, ..., 1)`\n    These two vectors are clearly not multiples of each other; they are linearly independent. Thus, the rank of the matrix is 2.\n*   Let `a = 2` and `b = 1`.\n    *   `v₁ = (2, 2, ..., 2)`\n    *   `v₂ = (1, ..., 1, 2, ..., 2, 1, ..., 1, 2, ..., 2)`\n    Again, these are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\nSince the row space is spanned by at most two distinct vectors, the rank can never exceed 2. We have shown that a rank of 2 is achievable by choosing appropriate values for `a` and `b`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximal possible rank of the matrix is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
