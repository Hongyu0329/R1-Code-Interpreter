    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to derive the partition function Z using the path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the Grand Canonical Partition Function Operator**\n\nThe grand canonical partition function `Z` is defined as the trace of the density matrix operator for a system in contact with a heat and particle reservoir at temperature `T` and chemical potential `μ`.\nThe operator is `exp[-β(H - μN)]`, where `H` is the Hamiltonian operator, `N` is the particle number operator, and `β = 1/(kT)`.\nThe partition function is given by:\n`Z = Tr[exp(-β(H - μN))]`\n\n**2. Substitute the Given Hamiltonian**\n\nThe problem provides a specific Hamiltonian: `H = -μN`. We substitute this into the expression for `Z`.\n\n`Z = Tr[exp(-β((-μN) - μN))]`\n`Z = Tr[exp(-β(-2μN))]`\n`Z = Tr[exp(2βμN)]`\n\nThis is the operator whose trace we need to compute. This corresponds to an effective Hamiltonian in the exponent `H_eff = -2μN`.\n\n**3. Formulate the Path Integral**\n\nThe grand canonical partition function `Z` can be expressed as a functional path integral over fields `ψ(x, τ)` and `ψ*(x, τ)`, where `τ` is the imaginary time ranging from `0` to `β`.\n\n`Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] exp(-S[ψ*, ψ])`\n\nThe Euclidean action `S` is given by:\n`S = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x L`\nwhere the Lagrangian density `L` is related to the effective Hamiltonian `H_eff = H - μN`. For a general Hamiltonian `H(ψ*, ψ)`, the action is:\n`S = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ ψ*(∂_τ)ψ + H(ψ*, ψ) - μψ*ψ ]`\n\nIn our specific case, the effective operator is `H_eff = H - μN = -2μN`. In the language of second quantization, this operator corresponds to `H_eff(ψ*, ψ) = -2μ ∫ d³x ψ*ψ`.\n\nSubstituting this into the action formula gives:\n`S = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ ψ*(∂_τ)ψ - 2μψ*ψ ]`\nWe can factor out the fields:\n`S = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ ψ*(∂_τ - 2μ)ψ ]`\n\n**4. Simplify the System (Interpret the Hamiltonian)**\n\nThe given Hamiltonian `H = -μN` does not contain any spatial derivatives (like `∇²` from kinetic energy) or position-dependent potentials. This implies that the energy does not depend on the momentum or position of the particles. Therefore, all single-particle states are energetically identical. The simplest, most natural interpretation for such a model is that of a single, non-degenerate energy level that can be occupied by particles. This simplifies the system to a zero-dimensional one, so we can drop the spatial integral `∫d³x`.\n\nThe action becomes:\n`S = ∫₀^β dτ [ ψ*(τ)(∂_τ - 2μ)ψ(τ) ]`\n\n**5. Evaluate the Path Integral via Fourier Transform**\n\nTo evaluate the integral, we expand the field `ψ(τ)` in a Fourier series over the imaginary time interval `[0, β]`. The frequencies are the Matsubara frequencies, `ω_n`.\n`ψ(τ) = (1/√β) Σ_n ψ_n e^{-iω_n τ}`\n\nThe time derivative `∂_τ` acting on a mode gives a factor of `-iω_n`.\n`∂_τ ψ(τ) = (1/√β) Σ_n (-iω_n) ψ_n e^{-iω_n τ}`\n\nSubstituting the Fourier series into the action, the integral over `τ` projects out the terms, and the action becomes a sum over the Matsubara modes `n`:\n`S = Σ_n ψ*_n (-iω_n - 2μ) ψ_n`\n\nThe path integral now becomes a product of standard Gaussian integrals over the Fourier components `ψ_n` and `ψ*_n`.\n`Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] e^{-S} = Π_n ∫ dψ*_n dψ_n exp[-ψ*_n(-iω_n - 2μ)ψ_n]`\n\n**6. Consider Particle Statistics (Bosons vs. Fermions)**\n\nThe result of the integral depends on whether the fields `ψ` represent bosons (complex numbers) or fermions (Grassmann numbers). The problem does not specify, so we consider the standard case of bosons first.\n\n*   **For Bosons:** The fields `ψ` are complex variables and satisfy periodic boundary conditions, so the Matsubara frequencies are `ω_n = 2πn/β`. The Gaussian integral for each mode `n` is `∫ dψ*_n dψ_n e^{-A_n ψ*_n ψ_n} ∝ 1/A_n`.\n    `Z_B ∝ Π_n [1 / (-iω_n - 2μ)]`\n\n    To evaluate this product, we take the logarithm:\n    `ln(Z_B) = - Σ_n ln(-iω_n - 2μ)`\n\n    We use the standard Matsubara summation formula for bosons: `Σ_n ln(x - iω_n) = ln(1 - e^{-βx})`.\n    Here, our `x` is `-2μ`.\n    `ln(Z_B) = - [ln(1 - e^{-β(-2μ)})] = -ln(1 - e^{2βμ})`\n    `ln(Z_B) = ln((1 - e^{2βμ})⁻¹) `\n\n    Exponentiating both sides gives the partition function:\n    `Z_B = 1 / (1 - e^{2βμ})`\n\n    This result is valid only when the geometric series used implicitly in the Matsubara sum converges, which requires `|e^{2βμ}| < 1`, or `μ < 0`.\n\n*   **For Fermions (for completeness):** The fields are Grassmann variables, satisfying anti-periodic boundary conditions (`ω_n = (2n+1)π/β`). The integral for each mode is `A_n`.\n    `Z_F = Π_n (-iω_n - 2μ)`\n    `ln(Z_F) = Σ_n ln(-iω_n - 2μ)`\n    Using the fermionic Matsubara sum formula `Σ_n ln(x - iω_n) = ln(1 + e^{-βx})` with `x = -2μ`:\n    `ln(Z_F) = ln(1 + e^{-β(-2μ)}) = ln(1 + e^{2βμ})`\n    `Z_F = 1 + e^{2βμ}`\n\nSince the problem is posed generically with `ψ` fields, the bosonic case is the most conventional interpretation.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAssuming the particles are bosons, the partition function `Z` is:\n\n`Z = 1 / (1 - exp(2βμ))`\n\nThis is valid under the condition that the chemical potential `μ` is negative (`μ < 0`).\n\n<<<1 / (1 - exp(2βμ))>>>"
