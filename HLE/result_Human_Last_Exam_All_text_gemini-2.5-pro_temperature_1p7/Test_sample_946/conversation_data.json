The name is explicitly stated as \"Kassie K\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Episode Specificity:** It is important to analyze only Teen Girl Squad #15, as other episodes have different plots.\n*   **Fictional vs. Real:** The singer is a character *within* the Homestar Runner universe, not a real-world celebrity.\n*   **Exact Spelling:** The name is spelled \"Kassie K\", not \"Cassie\" or any other variation. This is confirmed by the narration and the text on the cutout in the cartoon.\n*   **Nature of Performance:** The question is precise in asking about the \"cardboard cutout\", which is a key detail of the gag in the episode. The characters even comment on how good she is \"for a cardboard cutout\".\n\nBy following these steps and paying attention to the details, we can confidently identify the name of the fictional singer.\n\n<<<Kassie K>>>"
