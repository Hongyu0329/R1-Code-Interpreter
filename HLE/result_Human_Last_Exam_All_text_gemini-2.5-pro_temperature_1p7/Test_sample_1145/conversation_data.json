    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Wavefunction and Probability Density\n\nFor a particle in a one-dimensional box of length 'a', the normalized wavefunction for the n-th energy state is given by:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nThe probability density, P(x), which is the probability per unit length of finding the particle at a position x, is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction:\nP(x) = |ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Specifics of the Problem\n\nThe problem asks for the probability for the state **n = 2** in the interval from **x₁ = 0.495a** to **x₂ = 0.505a**.\n\nFor n = 2, the probability density function is:\nP(x) = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\n### Step 3: Set up the Probability Integral\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in the interval [x₁, x₂] is the integral of the probability density function over that interval:\nProbability = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] P(x) dx\nProbability = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Interval and Choose a Method of Calculation\n\n*   **The center of the interval:** The interval is centered at x = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a.\n*   **The width of the interval:** The width is Δx = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a. This is a very small portion of the box length (1%).\n*   **The probability at the center:** For n=2, the wavefunction has a node at the center of the box (x = 0.5a = a/2), because sin(2π(a/2)/a) = sin(π) = 0. This means the probability density is zero at the exact center of our interval.\n\nSince the interval is very small and the function P(x) varies smoothly, we can use an approximation. The simple approximation `P(center) * Δx` would give 0, which is incorrect because the probability is non-zero away from the exact center. A more accurate method is to approximate the `sin` function itself, as its argument will be close to π.\n\nLet's change variables to `y = x - 0.5a`, which shifts the center of the interval to y=0.\n*   When x = 0.495a, y = -0.005a\n*   When x = 0.505a, y = +0.005a\n\nThe integral becomes:\nProbability = ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (2/a) * sin²(2π(y + 0.5a)/a) dy\nProbability = ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (2/a) * sin²(2πy/a + π) dy\n\nUsing the identity sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ), we get sin²(θ + π) = [-sin(θ)]² = sin²(θ).\nProbability = ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (2/a) * sin²(2πy/a) dy\n\nNow, for the small values of y in our interval, the argument of the sine function, z = 2πy/a, is also very small. We can use the small-angle approximation: sin(z) ≈ z.\n\nSo, sin²(2πy/a) ≈ (2πy/a)² = 4π²y²/a²\n\nThe integral approximation is:\nProbability ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (2/a) * (4π²y²/a²) dy\nProbability ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to +0.005a] (8π²/a³) y² dy\n\n### Step 5: Perform the Integration and Calculation\n\nNow, we compute the simplified integral:\nProbability ≈ (8π²/a³) * [y³/3] (evaluated from -0.005a to +0.005a)\nProbability ≈ (8π²/ (3a³)) * [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]\nProbability ≈ (8π²/ (3a³)) * [ (0.005a)³ + (0.005a)³]\nProbability ≈ (8π²/ (3a³)) * [ 2 * (0.005)³ * a³]\n\nThe `a³` terms cancel out:\nProbability ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\nProbability ≈ (16π²/3) * (5 x 10⁻³)³\nProbability ≈ (16π²/3) * (125 x 10⁻⁹)\nProbability ≈ (16 * 125 * π²) / (3 * 10⁹)\nProbability ≈ (2000 * π²) / (3 * 10⁹)\nProbability ≈ (2π²/3) * 10⁻⁶\n\nUsing the value π² ≈ 9.8696:\nProbability ≈ (2 * 9.8696 / 3) * 10⁻⁶\nProbability ≈ (19.7392 / 3) * 10⁻⁶\nProbability ≈ 6.5797 * 10⁻⁶\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the probability is 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Remember to use the n=2 state, not the ground state (n=1). The node at the center for n=2 is the key feature of this problem.\n*   The small interval allows for an accurate approximation. Direct integration is possible but requires careful handling of subtracting two nearly identical numbers, which can lead to precision errors if not done carefully.\n*   The small-angle approximation `sin(z) ≈ z` is valid here because the maximum value of the argument `z = 2πy/a` in the interval is `2π(0.005a)/a = 0.01π ≈ 0.0314` radians, which is a small angle.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is a numerical probability.\nProbability ≈ 6.58 x 10⁻⁶\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
