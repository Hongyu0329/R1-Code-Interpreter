    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines with the equation $px+qy=1$, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime integers.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Family of Lines and the Condition**\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all pairs of coprime integers $(p,q)$. The family of lines is $L_{p,q}: px+qy=1$ for all $(p,q) \\in S$.\nLet $K$ be a convex domain in the plane. The condition is that for every $(p,q) \\in S$, the intersection $K \\cap L_{p,q}$ must be non-empty.\n\nA line defined by the equation $v \\cdot x = c$ (where $v$ is a normal vector) intersects a convex set $K$ if and only if the value $c$ lies between the minimum and maximum values of the linear function $f(x) = v \\cdot x$ over the set $K$.\nLet $v = (p,q)$ and $c=1$. The condition that $K$ intersects the line $px+qy=1$ is:\n$$ \\inf_{x \\in K} (v \\cdot x) \\le 1 \\le \\sup_{x \\in K} (v \\cdot x) $$\nLet $h_K(v) = \\sup_{x \\in K} (v \\cdot x)$ be the support function of $K$. The infimum can be expressed as $\\inf_{x \\in K} (v \\cdot x) = -h_K(-v)$.\nSo, for every $v=(p,q) \\in S$, the condition is:\n$$ -h_K(-v) \\le 1 \\le h_K(v) $$\nThis gives two inequalities for each $v \\in S$:\n1.  $h_K(v) \\ge 1$\n2.  $h_K(-v) \\ge -1$\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Condition**\n\nThe set of primitive integer vectors $S$ is centrally symmetric. That is, if $v=(p,q) \\in S$, then $-v=(-p,-q)$ is also in $S$ because $\\gcd(p,q) = \\gcd(-p,-q)$.\nLet's apply the condition for both $v$ and $-v$ from the set $S$.\nFrom $v \\in S$, we have:\n(a) $h_K(v) \\ge 1$\n(b) $h_K(-v) \\ge -1$\n\nFrom $-v \\in S$, we have:\n(c) $h_K(-v) \\ge 1$\n(d) $h_K(-(-v)) \\ge -1$, which simplifies to $h_K(v) \\ge -1$.\n\nFor any $v \\in S$, all four conditions must hold. Combining them:\nFrom (a) and (d), we need $h_K(v) \\ge 1$.\nFrom (b) and (c), we need $h_K(-v) \\ge 1$.\nSo, the condition on the convex domain $K$ is that for every primitive integer vector $v=(p,q)$, we must have $h_K(v) \\ge 1$ and $h_K(-v) \\ge 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction to Centrally Symmetric Domains**\n\nLet $K$ be a convex domain satisfying the conditions. Let $K_s = \\frac{1}{2}(K-K) = \\{\\frac{1}{2}(k_1-k_2) \\mid k_1, k_2 \\in K\\}$ be its central symmetral. $K_s$ is a centrally symmetric convex body. Its support function is $h_{K_s}(v) = \\frac{1}{2}(h_K(v) + h_K(-v))$.\nFrom Step 2, for any $v \\in S$, we know $h_K(v) \\ge 1$ and $h_K(-v) \\ge 1$. Therefore, for the symmetral $K_s$:\n$$ h_{K_s}(v) = \\frac{1}{2}(h_K(v) + h_K(-v)) \\ge \\frac{1}{2}(1 + 1) = 1 $$\nSo if $K$ is a solution, $K_s$ is also a solution. The Rogers-Shephard inequality states that Area($K_s$) $\\le$ Area($K$). Thus, the minimal area will be achieved by a centrally symmetric domain. So we can restrict our search to centrally symmetric convex domains $K$.\n\nFor a centrally symmetric $K$, $h_K(v) = h_K(-v)$. The condition from Step 2 simplifies to:\n$$ h_K(v) \\ge 1 \\quad \\text{for all } v \\in S $$\n\n**Step 4: Using Duality**\n\nWe are looking for a centrally symmetric convex body $K$ with minimal area such that $h_K(v) \\ge 1$ for all primitive integer vectors $v \\in S$.\nLet $K^*$ be the polar body of $K$, defined as $K^* = \\{u \\mid u \\cdot x \\le 1 \\text{ for all } x \\in K\\}$.\n$K^*$ is also a centrally symmetric convex body. To minimize Area($K$), by the Blaschke-SantalÃ³ inequality (which states Area($K$)Area($K^*$) $\\le \\pi^2$), we need to maximize Area($K^*$).\nThe condition $h_K(v) \\ge 1$ for all $v \\in S$ imposes a restriction on $K^*$. A fundamental property of polarity is that $h_K(v) \\ge 1$ is equivalent to stating that the vector $v$ is not in the interior of $K^*$. So, for all $v \\in S$, $v \\notin \\text{int}(K^*)$.\nSo, the problem is transformed into finding the maximum area of a centrally symmetric convex body $K^*$ whose interior contains no primitive integer lattice points.\n\n**Step 5: Finding the Optimal Dual Body**\n\nThe set of points forbidden from the interior of $K^*$ is $S$. This includes $(\\pm 1, 0), (0, \\pm 1), (\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$, etc.\nLet's consider a point $(u_1, u_2) \\in K^*$. If $|u_1| > 1$, then by convexity, the line segment from the origin to $(u_1, u_2)$ is in $K^*$. This segment must contain a point $(1, u'_2)$ which would then lie in $K^*$. This isn't forbidden yet.\nHowever, it can be shown that any centrally symmetric convex body whose interior avoids all points in $S$ must be contained in the square $[-1,1] \\times [-1,1]$. The vertices of this square, such as $(1,1)$, are in $S$. Therefore, the interior of $K^*$ must be contained within the open square $(-1,1) \\times (-1,1)$.\nThe centrally symmetric convex body of maximum area avoiding primitive integer points in its interior is indeed the open square $C^* = (-1,1) \\times (-1,1)$. Its closure is $\\bar{C}^* = [-1,1] \\times [-1,1]$. The area of $C^*$ is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\n**Step 6: Finding the Primal Body and its Area**\n\nThe minimal area domain $K$ we seek is the polar body of $\\bar{C}^* = [-1,1] \\times [-1,1]$.\n$$ K = (\\bar{C}^*)^* = \\{ (x,y) \\mid ux+vy \\le 1 \\text{ for all } (u,v) \\in [-1,1]\\times[-1,1] \\} $$\nThe condition $ux+vy \\le 1$ must hold for all $(u,v)$ in the square. Since the function $f(u,v) = ux+vy$ is linear, its maximum on the square is achieved at one of the four vertices: $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$.\nThis leads to the four inequalities:\n1.  $1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot y \\le 1 \\implies x+y \\le 1$\n2.  $1 \\cdot x - 1 \\cdot y \\le 1 \\implies x-y \\le 1$\n3.  $-1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot y \\le 1 \\implies -x+y \\le 1$\n4.  $-1 \\cdot x - 1 \\cdot y \\le 1 \\implies -x-y \\le 1$\n\nThese four inequalities combine to $|x| + |y| \\le 1$.\nThis describes a diamond shape (a square rotated by 45 degrees) with vertices at $(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)$.\n\nThe area of this diamond is half the area of the bounding box $[-1,1]\\times[-1,1]$, so Area = $\\frac{1}{2}(2 \\times 2) = 2$. Or, as a square with diagonal length 2, the side length is $\\sqrt{2}$, and Area = $(\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$.\n\nLet's double check that this domain works. For $K = \\{(x,y) : |x|+|y|\\le 1\\}$, the support function is $h_K(p,q) = \\max(|p|, |q|)$. For any coprime integers $(p,q)$, they cannot both be zero. If $p \\ne 0$, $|p| \\ge 1$. If $q \\ne 0$, $|q| \\ge 1$. Thus $\\max(|p|,|q|) \\ge 1$. So $h_K(p,q) \\ge 1$ for all $(p,q)\\in S$. This shows the domain is a valid solution.\n\nFinal conclusion: The minimal area is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
