    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terms in the Question\n\nFirst, we need to understand the music theory behind the question.\n*   **The Beatles:** The song must be from the catalog of The Beatles.\n*   **Starts with:** This usually implies the very beginning of the song, the intro. However, it can sometimes refer to the beginning of the main musical theme or a prominent section.\n*   **Tonic:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord built on the first note of the scale, typically represented by the Roman numeral \"I\" in a major key (a major chord) or \"i\" in a minor key (a minor chord).\n*   **Minor fifth chord:** This is a minor chord built on the fifth note of the scale, represented by the Roman numeral \"v\". In a major key, the naturally occurring chord on the fifth degree is major (V). To get a minor fifth chord (v), you must borrow it from the parallel minor key. This technique is called \"modal interchange\" and was a favorite of The Beatles.\n\nFor example, in the key of F Major:\n*   The **tonic (I)** chord is **F Major**.\n*   The fifth note of the scale is C. The standard dominant (V) chord is C Major.\n*   The **minor fifth (v)** chord would be **C minor**.\n\nSo, the question is looking for a Beatles song that has a chord progression of **I -> v** (e.g., F Major to C minor) at its beginning.\n\n### Step 2: Search for Songs with this Specific Opening\n\nA literal search for a Beatles song whose first two chords are I -> v is challenging. Let's examine some famous intros:\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\":** Starts with a famous, dissonant Gsus4/F chord. Does not fit.\n*   **\"Help!\":** In A Major. The progression is A (I) -> C#m (iii) -> F#m (vi). Does not fit.\n*   **\"Yesterday\":** In F Major. The progression is F (I) -> Em7 -> A7 -> Dm. The second chord is not the minor fifth (Cm). Does not fit.\n*   **\"Eleanor Rigby\":** In E minor. The progression is Em (i) -> C (VI). Does not fit.\n\nA direct search for a song starting with this exact progression from the very first beat is difficult and does not yield an obvious answer. This suggests we may need to interpret \"starts with\" more broadly.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Most Likely Candidate and Analyze Its Structure\n\nThe song most frequently cited as the answer to this question is **\"Michelle\"** from the album *Rubber Soul*. Let's analyze its structure to see why.\n\n*   **Key:** The song is famous for moving between F minor (for the verses) and F major (for the bridge). This constant shifting between the parallel major and minor keys is central to the song's character.\n*   **Intro:** The song begins with a beautiful fingerpicked instrumental passage by Paul McCartney. The chords during this intro are based around F minor, with a descending bassline (Fm -> Fm(maj7) -> Fm7 -> Bbm...). It does not start with an F Major to C minor jump.\n*   **Verse (\"Michelle, ma belle...\"):** This section is in F minor. The tonic is Fm (i).\n*   **Bridge (\"I love you, I love you, I love you...\"):** This section shifts to the key of F Major. The chords are F (I) -> Gm (ii) -> C7 (V7) -> F (I). The tonic here is F Major.\n\n### Step 4: Pinpoint the Exact Chord Jump\n\nThe specific progression we are looking for does not happen at the absolute start of the song. It happens in the transition *after* the F Major bridge and *before* the next verse section.\n\n1.  The bridge ends with the line \"...what my heart is tryin' to **say**\". The word \"say\" is held over a clear **F Major** chord (the tonic of the bridge).\n2.  Following this, there is a short instrumental re-introduction to the verse theme. This transitional phrase **starts** with that same **F Major (I)** chord, which then jumps directly to a **C minor (v)** chord.\n3.  The progression at this point is **F Major -> C minor -> F7 -> Bb major**.\n\nThis **F Major to C minor** (I -> v) jump is the exact progression described in the question. While it's not the first sound on the record, it marks the *start* of a significant and memorable transitional phrase, bridging the two main sections of the song. It is a perfect example of borrowing the minor fifth (v) from the parallel minor key (F minor) to use within a major key context.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on this analysis, the question refers to the start of a key musical phrase rather than the literal start of the recording. The song that features this iconic chord jump from the tonic (F Major) to the minor fifth (C minor) is \"Michelle\".\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
