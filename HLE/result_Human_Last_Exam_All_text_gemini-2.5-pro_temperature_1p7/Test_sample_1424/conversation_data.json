    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the functional dependence of the bare Green's function ($G_0$) on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$) in the Feynman path integral formalism.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the System and the Bare Action ($S_0$)\n\nThe starting point is the action for a non-interacting many-particle system. In the Feynman path integral formalism, the dynamics of the system are encoded in this action, $S_0$. Let's consider a system described by fields $\\psi(x)$, where $x=(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ represents position and time.\n\nThe action for a non-interacting system is quadratic in the fields and can be written as:\n$S_0[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int dt \\int d^d\\mathbf{r} \\, \\psi^*(\\mathbf{r}, t) [i\\hbar\\partial_t - (\\hat{H}_0 - \\mu)] \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$\nwhere:\n*   $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ and $\\psi^*(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ are Grassmann fields (for fermions) or complex fields (for bosons).\n*   $\\hat{H}_0$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n\n### Step 2: Diagonalizing the Action in the Energy Eigenbasis\n\nTo see the dependence on the energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$, we must switch to the basis that diagonalizes the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_0$. Let $\\{|\\phi_k\\rangle\\}$ be the complete set of orthonormal eigenstates of $\\hat{H}_0$ with corresponding eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$:\n$\\hat{H}_0 |\\phi_k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |\\phi_k\\rangle$\n\nWe can expand the field $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ in this basis:\n$\\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\sum_k \\phi_k(\\mathbf{r}) c_k(t)$\nwhere $\\phi_k(\\mathbf{r}) = \\langle \\mathbf{r} | \\phi_k \\rangle$ is the eigenfunction in real space, and $c_k(t)$ is the corresponding field amplitude in the eigenbasis.\n\nSubstituting this expansion into the action $S_0$ and using the orthogonality of the eigenstates, the action becomes a sum over independent modes indexed by $k$:\n$S_0 = \\sum_k \\int dt \\, c_k^*(t) [i\\hbar\\partial_t - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)] c_k(t)$\n\n### Step 3: Fourier Transforming to Frequency Space\n\nThe action can be further diagonalized by performing a Fourier transform from time ($t$) to frequency ($\\omega$). For convenience and generality, we use the imaginary time (Matsubara) formalism, where we use imaginary time $\\tau=it$ and discrete Matsubara frequencies $i\\omega_n$.\n\nIn this formalism, the action becomes:\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} c_k^*(i\\omega_n) [-i\\hbar\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu] c_k(i\\omega_n)$\n(Here we have absorbed the temperature factor $1/\\beta$ into the sum definition).\n\nThe key insight is that the entire action is now a sum of simple quadratic terms. The operator acting on the fields in this diagonal $(k, i\\omega_n)$ basis is $[-i\\hbar\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu]$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)\n\nThe Green's function in the path integral formalism is defined as the expectation value of field products. For a quadratic action like $S_0$, the two-point Green's function is simply the inverse of the operator in the action. This is a fundamental result for Gaussian integrals.\n\nLet's define the bare Matsubara Green's function in the $(k, i\\omega_n)$ basis as $\\mathcal{G}_0(k, i\\omega_n)$. It is the inverse of the operator we found in Step 3. (Note: The sign conventions can vary, but the functional form remains the same).\n$\\mathcal{G}_0(k, i\\omega_n) = [-i\\hbar\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu]^{-1} \\times (\\text{constant})$\nWith the standard definition, this becomes:\n$\\mathcal{G}_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n### Final Analysis of Functional Dependence and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Inverse Relationship**: The functional dependence is an **inverse linear relationship**. The bare Green's function $\\mathcal{G}_0$ is inversely proportional to a term that is linear in the single-particle energy eigenvalue, $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, it depends on the quantity $\\xi_k = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$, which is the single-particle energy measured relative to the chemical potential.\n\n2.  **Poles of the Green's Function**: The most important physical consequence of this relationship is that the poles of the Green's function are located at the single-particle excitation energies. If we analytically continue from Matsubara frequencies to a complex frequency $z$ (i.e., $i\\hbar\\omega_n \\to z$), the Green's function $G_0(k, z) = \\frac{1}{z - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$ has a simple pole at $z = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$. The poles of the propagator tell us the energies of the stable, non-interacting particles in the system.\n\n3.  **Bare vs. Interacting**: This simple inverse relationship is strictly true only for the **bare** Green's function ($G_0$). For an interacting system, the action contains higher-order terms. The full Green's function ($G$) is then related to the bare one via the Dyson equation: $G = G_0 + G_0 \\Sigma G$, where $\\Sigma$ is the self-energy. This results in $G(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{i\\hbar\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) - \\Sigma(k, \\omega)}$. The presence of the self-energy $\\Sigma$, which itself depends on frequency and momentum, makes the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ much more complex.\n\n4.  **Choice of Basis**: The simple form $\\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$ is only manifest when the Green's function is expressed in the **energy-frequency basis** ($k, \\omega$). In real space and time, $G_0(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, the relationship is smeared out by Fourier transforms over all $k$ and $\\omega$ modes, making the dependence indirect.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ in the energy-frequency representation has its poles at the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$. The functional dependence is that of an inverse, typically taking the form:\n\n$G_0 \\propto \\frac{1}{(\\text{frequency}) - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function, $G_0$, on a single-particle energy eigenvalue, $\\epsilon_k$, when expressed in the corresponding energy-frequency basis $(k, \\omega)$, is that of an inverse. The Green's function is proportional to the reciprocal of the difference between the frequency variable and the energy eigenvalue, often appearing in the denominator as $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$ or $(i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k)$, where the energy is typically measured relative to the chemical potential. Therefore, the poles of the bare Green's function directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues.>>>"
