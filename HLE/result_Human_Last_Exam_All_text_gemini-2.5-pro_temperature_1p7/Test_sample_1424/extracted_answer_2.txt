The functional dependence of the bare Green's function, $G_0$, on a single-particle energy eigenvalue, $\epsilon_k$, when expressed in the corresponding energy-frequency basis $(k, \omega)$, is that of an inverse. The Green's function is proportional to the reciprocal of the difference between the frequency variable and the energy eigenvalue, often appearing in the denominator as $(\omega - \epsilon_k)$ or $(i\omega_n - \epsilon_k)$, where the energy is typically measured relative to the chemical potential. Therefore, the poles of the bare Green's function directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues.
