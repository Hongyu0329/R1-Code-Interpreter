    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nLet's break down the key requirements from the user's question:\n1.  **Who:** A specific physicist.\n2.  **Primary Field:** \"Better known for work in the microscopy field.\"\n3.  **Discovery:** An \"optical effect in real imagery.\"\n4.  **Origin of Discovery:** It was prompted by an \"accidental observation\" from a \"custodial worker.\"\n5.  **Technology Involved:** The context was the cleaning of \"concave mirrors.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Clues**\nThe most unique and identifying clue is the involvement of a custodial worker in a scientific discovery. This is a very specific historical anecdote. The combination of \"microscopy\" and \"concave mirrors\" points away from standard light microscopes (which use lenses) and towards more specialized instruments like reflecting microscopes, or perhaps microscopy using other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, like X-rays.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the Anecdote**\nA search for scientific discoveries inspired by janitors or custodial workers quickly leads to a famous story in the field of X-ray optics. The story involves the development of the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Anecdote to the Physicist**\nThe physicists behind this invention were Paul Kirkpatrick and Albert Baez. The specific anecdote attributes the breakthrough moment to **Albert Baez**. The story goes that Baez was working late at night, struggling to find a way to focus X-rays. A single concave mirror would only focus X-rays into a line, not a point, a problem known as astigmatism. A janitor sweeping the floor commented to Baez that if you want to concentrate dust, you sweep it into a corner.\n\n**Step 5: Verify How the Clues Fit the Physicist and Discovery**\nLet's check if Albert Baez and his discovery fit all the points from Step 1.\n\n*   **Physicist:** Yes, Albert Baez (1912-2007) was a prominent physicist.\n*   **Microscopy Field:** Yes, Baez is well-known for his pioneering work in X-ray microscopy and X-ray imaging. The device he co-invented is fundamental to the field.\n*   **Optical Effect in Real Imagery:** The discovery was a method to overcome astigmatism and create a true, focused real image using X-rays. This is a crucial principle (or \"effect\") in grazing-incidence X-ray optics.\n*   **Accidental Observation by a Custodial Worker:** The janitor's remark about sweeping dust into a corner was the accidental observation that provided the key insight.\n*   **Concave Mirrors:** Baez's idea, inspired by the \"corner\" analogy, was to use two separate, curved (concave) mirrors, arranged at right angles to each other. The first mirror would focus the X-ray beam in one dimension (e.g., vertically), and the second mirror would then focus that line-beam into a point in the other dimension (horizontally), creating a sharp image.\n\nAll the criteria are met perfectly by Albert Baez and the story of his discovery.\n\n**Step 6: Formulate the Final Answer**\nThe physicist who fits this description is Albert Baez. He is renowned for his contributions to X-ray microscopy, and his key insight for the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system was famously sparked by an offhand comment from a janitor about sweeping dust into a corner.\n\n<<<Albert Baez>>>"
