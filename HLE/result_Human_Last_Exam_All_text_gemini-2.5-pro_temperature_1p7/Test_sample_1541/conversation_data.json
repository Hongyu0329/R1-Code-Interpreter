    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient solution and calculate its memory usage.\n\n### Question Analysis\nThe user wants to solve a programming problem with a specific constraint: finding the most memory-efficient C program. The problem itself is to reorder the numbers in a given sum so that they appear in non-decreasing order.\n\n*   **Input**: A string representing a sum of numbers (e.g., \"3+2+1+1\").\n*   **Summands**: The numbers in the sum are guaranteed to be only 1, 2, or 3.\n*   **Output**: The same sum with the numbers sorted (e.g., \"1+1+2+3\").\n*   **Primary Goal**: Minimize the total memory in bytes used for variables in the C program.\n*   **Secondary Goal**: Report this minimum memory usage `m`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Logic\n1.  **Read the input**: The input is a string of characters.\n2.  **Count the numbers**: We need to find out how many 1s, 2s, and 3s are in the sum. A simple and efficient way to do this is to iterate through the input and use counters for each number. This is the core idea of a Counting Sort.\n3.  **Construct the output**: After counting, we can print the sorted sum. We first print all the '1's, then all the '2's, and finally all the '3's, separated by '+' signs.\n\n### Careful Points & Optimization Strategy\n\n1.  **Avoiding large buffers**: The most significant memory usage in a naive solution would be storing the input string. The string can be up to 1000 characters long, which would require a `char` array of size 1001 (for the null terminator), consuming 1001 bytes. To be memory-efficient, we should avoid storing the entire string. We can process the input character by character as it's being read from the standard input.\n\n2.  **Using `getchar()`**: In C, we can read one character at a time using the `getchar()` function in a loop. This allows us to count the occurrences of '1', '2', and '3' without needing a large buffer. We simply ignore the '+' characters.\n\n3.  **Choosing correct data types for counters**:\n    *   The input string has a maximum length of 1000. The maximum possible number of summands occurs in a string like \"1+1+...+1\". This string would have `(1000 - 1) / 2 + 1 = 500` terms.\n    *   Therefore, our counters for '1', '2', and '3' must be able to hold a value up to 500.\n    *   An `unsigned char` (range 0-255) is not sufficient.\n    *   The next smallest standard integer type is `short int`, which typically uses 2 bytes and can hold values up to 32,767. This is sufficient and is the most memory-efficient choice.\n\n4.  **Variable for `getchar()`**: The `getchar()` function returns an `int`, not a `char`. This is because it needs to return every possible character value, as well as a distinct value `EOF` (End Of File) to signal the end of the input stream. Therefore, the variable used to store the result of `getchar()` must be an `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n\n5.  **Minimizing printing logic variables**: When printing the output `1+1+2+3`, we need to place '+' signs correctly. A common way is to use a boolean flag to avoid printing a '+' before the very first number. This flag would consume 1 byte (`char first = 1;`). However, we can eliminate this flag by structuring the code differently: print the first number unconditionally, and then have all subsequent print operations inside loops that prepend a '+'. This removes the need for the flag variable, saving 1 byte.\n\n### Final Memory Usage Calculation\n\nBased on the most memory-efficient strategy outlined above, the variables required are:\n\n1.  **Counters for numbers 1, 2, and 3**:\n    *   We need three counters. As determined, `short int` is the most efficient type that can hold the required range of values.\n    *   Variables: `short count1, count2, count3;`\n    *   Memory: `3 * sizeof(short) = 3 * 2 bytes = 6 bytes`.\n\n2.  **Variable for reading input characters**:\n    *   We need one variable to hold the return value of `getchar()`. This must be an `int` for correctness.\n    *   Variable: `int ch;`\n    *   Memory: `1 * sizeof(int) = 1 * 4 bytes = 4 bytes`.\n\nNo other variables are needed to store the program's state. The logic for printing without a flag does not require any extra variables.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation (`m`):**\nm = (Memory for counters) + (Memory for input character)\nm = 6 bytes + 4 bytes\nm = 10 bytes\n\n<<<10>>>"
