    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends with the same leg position as its starting position. The most common starting and ending position for these steps is the fifth position.\n\n**Analysis of Each Option:**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six:**\n    *   **Start:** The dancer begins in fifth position, for example, with the right foot in front.\n    *   **Movement:** This is a vertical jump in which the legs beat very rapidly, crossing three times in the air (totaling six movements, hence \"six\"). The legs open and close three times. Let's trace the beats: the back leg beats to the front, then the front leg beats to the back, and finally, the back leg beats to the front again before landing.\n    *   **End:** The dancer lands back in the original fifth position, with the right foot still in front. The nature of even-numbered entrechats (quatre, six, huit) is that they finish in the same position they started.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending leg positions are the same.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n    *   **Start:** Begins in a closed position, such as fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** \"Échappé\" means \"escaped,\" referring to the legs opening from a closed to an open position (like second position). \"Battu\" means there's a beat of the calves as the legs open. \"Changé\" means \"changed.\" In the full step, the dancer jumps from fifth, opens the legs to second (with a beat), then jumps from second, closing into fifth position with the opposite foot now in front.\n    *   **End:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The word \"changé\" explicitly indicates that the feet have changed positions. The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé:**\n    *   **Start:** Typically starts from fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** \"Assemblé\" means \"to assemble\" or \"join together.\" The working leg brushes out (for example, the back leg slides to the side), the dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and the legs are brought together (\"assembled\") in the air.\n    *   **End:** The dancer lands on both feet simultaneously in fifth position. In a standard assemblé (like *assemblé dessus*), the working leg lands in front. So if the back (left) leg started the movement, it would land in front. The final position would be fifth with the left foot in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The feet have changed places. The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière:**\n    *   **Start:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** \"Glissade\" means \"to glide.\" \"Derrière\" means \"behind.\" To execute this step, the back foot (the left foot) glides out to the side, the dancer transfers weight to it, and the front foot (the right foot) then glides to close *behind* the left foot in fifth position.\n    *   **End:** The dancer finishes in fifth position with the left foot now in front.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The feet have changed places. The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade:**\n    *   **Start:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** This is a decorative jumping step, similar to a *pas de chat*. The dancer jumps, performing a quick double *rond de jambe* (circular motion) with each leg in the air. For example, traveling to the right, the right leg performs its circle, followed by the left leg.\n    *   **End:** The dancer lands on the first foot (right) and then closes the second foot (left) in front, finishing in fifth position with the left foot forward.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The feet have changed places. The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n**Final Determination:**\n\nAfter analyzing all the steps, the only one that, by its standard definition, starts and ends in the exact same leg position (i.e., the same foot in front in fifth position) is the **Entrechat six**.\n\n<<<A>>>"
