    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel in question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Clues in the Question\n\nThe question provides two distinct and powerful clues attributed to the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  **A description of the novel:** It possesses \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" This suggests a work that is both fiercely passionate and intricately structured.\n2.  **A description of the author:** Borges refers to the author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\" This points to a writer whose style or themes are influenced by the American novelist William Faulkner but are perhaps more accessible.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Author\n\n*   The clue \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is the most direct way to identify the author. Many writers of the Latin American Boom were influenced by Faulkner's creation of the mythical Yoknapatawpha County and his complex narrative techniques.\n*   However, the one most famously and directly linked to Faulkner, and who himself acknowledged the debt, is **Gabriel García Márquez**.\n*   García Márquez's fictional town of Macondo is often compared to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha. He adapted Faulkner's non-linear timelines and multi-generational sagas. Borges's qualification \"(and simplifier)\" is also apt; while García Márquez's narrative is complex, its prose is generally seen as more fluid and less syntactically convoluted than Faulkner's most difficult passages.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Novel\n\n*   Now that we have identified the author as Gabriel García Márquez, we can connect the first clue to his most famous work.\n*   The phrase \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" perfectly describes **_One Hundred Years of Solitude_** (_Cien años de soledad_).\n*   **\"The intensity of a tiger\"**: This refers to the raw, untamed, and mythic energy of the novel. It encompasses the epic civil wars, the forbidden passions, the biblical plagues (like insomnia and rain), and the larger-than-life characters of the Buendía family. The story is driven by a primal, often violent, force.\n*   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\"**: This points to the novel's meticulous and brilliant structure. Despite its sprawling, chaotic events, the story is tightly woven with recurring names, cyclical patterns of fate, and a deterministic structure that is only fully revealed at the end. The intricate family tree and the interconnected events are plotted with the precision of a master chess player.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Source\n\n*   A search confirms that Jorge Luis Borges did indeed write these words. He wrote them in a brief but highly influential prologue for the Italian edition of *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, published in 1968. This prologue cemented the novel's critical reputation and highlighted Borges's admiration for the work.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy combining the clues, we can confidently identify the author as Gabriel García Márquez and the specific novel praised by Borges as *One Hundred Years of Solitude*. The descriptions perfectly capture the novel's unique blend of epic, magical storytelling and its intricate, almost mathematical, structure.\n\n***\n\n<<<One Hundred Years of Solitude (Cien años de soledad)>>>"
