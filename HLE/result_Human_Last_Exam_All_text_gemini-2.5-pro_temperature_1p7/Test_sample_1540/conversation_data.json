    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the derivation of the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The primary task is to perform a lexicographical comparison of two strings.\n2.  **Identify Key Constraints & Rules:**\n    *   **Input:** Two strings are provided, one on each line.\n    *   **Case-Insensitivity:** The comparison must ignore whether letters are uppercase or lowercase. For example, 'A' should be treated as equal to 'a'.\n    *   **Guaranteed Properties:** The strings are guaranteed to be of the same length, and their length will be between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive. They only contain uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n    *   **Output:** The program must print:\n        *   \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n        *   \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically greater than the second.\n        *   \"0\" if the strings are equal after ignoring case.\n\n3.  **Formulate an Algorithm:**\n    *   Read the two input strings.\n    *   Iterate through the strings from the first character to the last, comparing characters at the same position (index).\n    *   In each iteration, take the character from the first string and the character from the second string.\n    *   Convert both characters to a common case (e.g., lowercase) to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n    *   Compare the converted characters.\n    *   If the character from the first string is less than the one from the second, we have our answer. Print \"-1\" and stop.\n    *   If the character from the first string is greater than the one from the second, print \"1\" and stop.\n    *   If the characters are equal, continue to the next position in the strings.\n    *   If the loop finishes without finding any difference, it means the strings are equal. Print \"0\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Buffer Size:** In C, to store a string of maximum length 100, the character array (buffer) needs to be of size `100 + 1 = 101` to accommodate the null terminator (`\\0`).\n2.  **Case Conversion:** The most reliable way to handle case-insensitivity is to use a standard library function. The `<ctype.h>` header provides the `tolower()` function, which safely converts an uppercase letter to lowercase while leaving other characters (including already lowercase letters) unchanged.\n3.  **Lexicographical Order:** The comparison must stop at the *first* point of difference. For example, when comparing \"apple\" and \"apply\", the comparison ends at the 4th character ('l' vs 'y'), and \"apple\" is determined to be smaller. There is no need to check the remaining characters.\n4.  **Equal Length Guarantee:** The problem states the strings have the same length. This simplifies the code, as we don't have to handle cases where one string is shorter than the other (which would make it lexicographically smaller if it's a prefix of the longer string). We can loop until we hit the null terminator of either string.\n5.  **Memory Efficiency:** The prompt specifically asks for the *most memory-efficient* program. This requires careful selection of data structures and variables to minimize memory footprint.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer (`m`)\n\nTo write the most memory-efficient C program, we must minimize the memory allocated for variables.\n\n1.  **Standard Approach vs. Memory-Efficient Approach:**\n    *   A typical C solution would declare two character arrays of size 101, one for each string: `char str1[101]; char str2[101];`. This would use `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the buffers.\n    *   A more memory-efficient approach recognizes that you only need the first string fully in memory. The second string can be read one character at a time and compared against the corresponding character of the stored first string.\n\n2.  **Variables for the Most Memory-Efficient Program:**\n    To implement this optimized approach, the following variables are necessary:\n    *   **A buffer for the first string:** We must read and store the entire first string before we can begin reading the second.\n        *   `char str1[101];`\n        *   Memory Cost: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n    *   **A variable for the loop index:** We need to keep track of our position in `str1`. The index will range from 0 to 99. The smallest standard data type that can hold this range is `char`.\n        *   `char i;`\n        *   Memory Cost: `1 * sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n    *   **A variable to store the current character of the second string:** As we read the second string character-by-character, we need a place to hold each character temporarily for comparison.\n        *   `char ch2;`\n        *   Memory Cost: `1 * sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Total Memory Calculation:**\n    The total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all declared variables.\n\n    m = (memory for `str1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `ch2`)\n    m = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 1 byte\n    m = **103 bytes**\n\nThis is the minimum memory required for variables to solve the problem correctly in C.\n\n<<<103>>>"
