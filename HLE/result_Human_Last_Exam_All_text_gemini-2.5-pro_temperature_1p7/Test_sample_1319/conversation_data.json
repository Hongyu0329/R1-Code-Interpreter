    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the mountains mentioned in the *Iliad***\n\nFirst, we need to compile a list of all the real, physical mountains that are explicitly named in Homer's epic poem, the *Iliad*.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, mentioned extensively throughout the epic. It is the tallest mountain in Greece.\n*   **Mount Ida:** A very significant mountain in the story. Zeus often watches the Trojan War from its summit. This refers to the Mount Ida in the Troad region (modern-day Kaz Dağı in Turkey), not the Mount Ida in Crete.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** Poseidon watches the battle from the highest peak of the island of Samothrace (\"the topmost peak of wooded Samos,\" i.e., Samothrace). This peak is known today as Mount Fengari or Saos.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Mentioned by name as one of the landmarks Hera passes during her journey from Olympus to Ida in Book 14.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in the \"Catalogue of Ships\" in Book 2 as a mountain in Maeonia (later Lydia), home to nymphs.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned in connection with the great ash spear of Achilles, which was cut from its summit.\n*   **Mount Othrys:** Mentioned in the \"Catalogue of Ships\" as a landmark in the kingdom of Protesilaus.\n\n**Step 2: Find the modern elevations of these historical mountains**\n\nTo determine the ranking by height, we need the modern, accepted elevation data for each mountain identified.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 meters (9,573 ft)\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağlar range, Turkey):** 2,157 meters (7,077 ft)\n*   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters (6,670 ft)\n*   **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı, Turkey):** 1,774 meters (5,820 ft)\n*   **Mount Othrys:** 1,726 meters (5,663 ft)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters (5,328 ft)\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Peak: Fengari):** 1,611 meters (5,285 ft)\n\n**Step 3: Rank the mountains by height and identify the second tallest**\n\nNow, we can rank the mountains from tallest to shortest to find the one that comes after Mount Olympus.\n\n1.  **Mount Olympus:** 2,918 m\n2.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,157 m\n3.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n4.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n5.  **Mount Othrys:** 1,726 m\n6.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n7.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n\nBased on this ranking, the tallest mountain is Mount Olympus, and the second tallest is Mount Tmolus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Which Mount Ida?**: It is crucial to correctly identify the Mount Ida from the *Iliad*. The epic's context places it overlooking the Trojan plain, which corresponds to Kaz Dağı in Turkey, not the taller Mount Ida on the island of Crete.\n2.  **Historical vs. Mythical**: All the mountains listed are real, physical locations, fitting the \"historical mountain\" criterion.\n3.  **Specific Mentions**: The analysis only includes mountains specifically named in the *Iliad*. General references to mountain ranges are not specific enough to be included.\n4.  **Modern Elevation Data**: The answer relies on modern geological surveys for elevation, as this is the only objective way to measure and compare their heights.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe analysis shows that the highest mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is Mount Olympus. The next highest on the list is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
