    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in the specified performance.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Specific Performance and Scene**\n\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Ballet:** La Bayadère\n*   **Scene:** The question specifies the \"Death of Nikiya scene\" and her \"debut variation.\" This refers to Nikiya's solo in Act II. In the narrative, this is the dance she performs at the celebration before she is presented with a basket of flowers, which contains the venomous snake that leads to her death.\n*   **Company & Year:** Bolshoi Ballet, 2009. This refers to Osipova's renowned debut in the role with the company.\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Ballet Step \"Entrelacé\"**\n\n*   An **entrelacé**, technically known as *grand jeté en tournant entrelacé* or more commonly *tour jeté*, is a large turning jump.\n*   The dancer typically starts by brushing one leg forward (grand battement), jumping into the air while turning their body a half-turn to face the other way, and landing on the first leg in arabesque. The visual effect is one of the legs whipping around and the body seemingly interlacing in the air.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Choreography of the Variation**\n\nTo answer the question, we must watch the specified variation and count each instance of this specific jump. The choreography for this solo is famous for its demanding diagonal sequences.\n\n1.  The variation begins with a series of poses and connecting steps.\n2.  Osipova then prepares for the first major sequence: a diagonal of jumps travelling from upstage left to downstage right.\n3.  **First Diagonal:** She executes a series of four identical, consecutive entrelacés.\n    *   Entrelacé #1\n    *   Entrelacé #2\n    *   Entrelacé #3\n    *   Entrelacé #4\n    *(Current Count: 4)*\n4.  Following the first diagonal, there is a short central section with poses and turns.\n5.  She then prepares for the second diagonal, travelling from upstage right to downstage left.\n6.  **Second Diagonal:** She executes another series of four identical, consecutive entrelacés.\n    *   Entrelacé #5\n    *   Entrelacé #6\n    *   Entrelacé #7\n    *   Entrelacé #8\n    *(Current Count: 8)*\n7.  The variation concludes with a series of fast turns (chaînés) and a final pose. No further entrelacés are performed.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Correct Scene:** It is crucial to analyze the correct solo. The variation is not in Act III (\"The Kingdom of the Shades\") but in Act II, right before her death.\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** The jumps on the diagonals are clearly and unmistakably entrelacés. They are not to be confused with other jumps like *fouetté sauté* or *sissone*.\n*   **Choreographic Standard:** This choreography (originally Petipa, revised by Grigorovich for the Bolshoi) standardly includes these two diagonals of four jumps each. Osipova's performance adheres to this standard structure.\n\n### **Final Conclusion**\n\nBy counting the entrelacés in the two distinct diagonal sequences within the variation, we arrive at the final number. There are four entrelacés in the first diagonal and four in the second.\n\nTotal entrelacés = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
