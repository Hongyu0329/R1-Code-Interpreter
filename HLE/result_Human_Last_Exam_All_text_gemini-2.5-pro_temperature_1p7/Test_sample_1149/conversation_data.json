    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** *Irritator challengeri*, a species of spinosaurid dinosaur.\n    *   **Anatomical Feature:** The \"lacrimal recess\". The lacrimal is a skull bone located in front of the eye socket. A recess is a depression or fossa on a bone.\n    *   **Specific Inquiry:** The number of \"depressions\" *contained within* this lacrimal recess.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source of Information:**\n    *   Anatomical details for extinct animals are found in peer-reviewed scientific papers that describe their fossil remains.\n    *   The primary specimen for *Irritator challengeri* is the holotype skull, SMNS 58022.\n    *   The definitive description of this skull is found in the paper by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott (2002), titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil.\"\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Anatomical Description:**\n    *   Within the Sues et al. (2002) paper, we need to find the section on cranial osteology (the study of the skull bones).\n    *   Specifically, we need to look for the description of the **lacrimal bone**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Recess:**\n    *   The paper describes the lacrimal bone and its features in detail. It notes that the external surface of the lacrimal forms the back portion of a larger depression called the antorbital fossa.\n    *   Within this larger fossa, on the lacrimal bone, is the \"lacrimal recess\".\n    *   The key sentence in the paper that answers the question is: \"...the lacrimal recess itself encloses **two** subsidiary depressions.\"\n\n5.  **Cross-reference with Other Studies (Careful Point):**\n    *   It is good practice to see if subsequent studies support or contradict this finding.\n    *   A later review paper by Sales & Schultz (2017), \"Spinosaur taxonomy and evolution of craniodental features: Evidence from Brazil,\" also analyzes the skull of *Irritator*.\n    *   In their description, they note that the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri* possesses \"two accessory openings.\" \"Accessory openings\" and \"subsidiary depressions\" refer to the same features in this context.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nBoth the primary description of the *Irritator challengeri* skull and subsequent comparative studies consistently report the presence of two smaller depressions or openings within the larger lacrimal recess.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
