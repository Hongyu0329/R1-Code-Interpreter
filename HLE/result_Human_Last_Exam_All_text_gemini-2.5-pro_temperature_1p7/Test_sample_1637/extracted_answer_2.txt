Yes, changing the amide group to a more hydrophilic PEG group is a well-established chemical strategy known as PEGylation. This modification would significantly increase the overall water solubility of the probe and reduce its tendency to aggregate, thus it would very likely solve the problem of precipitation in the cell culture medium.
