    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of K.\n\n**1. Understand the Tensor and the Vector Spaces**\n\n*   The spaces $V_1^{\\otimes n} = V_2^{\\otimes n} = V_3^{\\otimes n}$ are defined as the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$. Let's denote this space by $F_n$. The dimension of this space is $2^n$.\n*   The tensor in question is an element of $F_n \\otimes F_n \\otimes F_n$. This space can be identified with the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n \\times \\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$.\n*   The tensor is given by the function $F(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$, where $x=(x_1, \\dots, x_n)$, $y=(y_1, \\dots, y_n)$, and $z=(z_1, \\dots, z_n)$ are vectors in $\\{0, 1\\}^n$.\n\n**2. Simplify the Problem Using Properties of Slice Rank**\n\n*   Let $G(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ and $U(x, y, z) = 1$. The tensor $F$ is then $F = G - U$.\n*   The tensor $U$ is a rank-1 tensor, as it can be written as $U(x,y,z) = u(x)u(y)u(z)$ where $u$ is the constant function $u(v)=1$ for all $v \\in \\{0,1\\}^n$. Any rank-1 tensor has a slice rank of 1.\n*   The slice rank is subadditive, so $\\text{SR}(G) - \\text{SR}(U) \\le \\text{SR}(F) \\le \\text{SR}(G) + \\text{SR}(U)$.\n*   This gives $\\text{SR}(G) - 1 \\le \\text{SR}(F) \\le \\text{SR}(G) + 1$.\n*   For large $n$, the slice rank grows exponentially. An additive constant of 1 is absorbed into the $e^{o(n)}$ term. Therefore, the asymptotic growth rate of $\\text{SR}(F)$ is the same as that of $\\text{SR}(G)$. We can focus on finding the slice rank of $G$.\n\n**3. Decompose the Tensor `G` into a Tensor Power**\n\n*   The space $F_n = \\text{Fun}(\\{0,1\\}^n, \\mathbb{C})$ is naturally isomorphic to the $n$-th tensor power of the base space $F_1 = \\text{Fun}(\\{0,1\\}, \\mathbb{C})$. So, $F_n \\cong (F_1)^{\\otimes n}$.\n*   The tensor $G$ is an element of $F_n \\otimes F_n \\otimes F_n \\cong ((F_1)^{\\otimes n}) \\otimes ((F_1)^{\\otimes n}) \\otimes ((F_1)^{\\otimes n})$.\n*   By rearranging the terms, this space is isomorphic to $(F_1 \\otimes F_1 \\otimes F_1)^{\\otimes n}$.\n*   The function $G(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ corresponds exactly to the $n$-th tensor power of the base tensor $g(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$ defined on $F_1 \\times F_1 \\times F_1$. So, $G = g^{\\otimes n}$.\n\n**4. Use the Multiplicative Property of Slice Rank**\n\n*   The slice rank is multiplicative with respect to the tensor product. That is, for any two tensors $T_1$ and $T_2$, $\\text{SR}(T_1 \\otimes T_2) = \\text{SR}(T_1) \\text{SR}(T_2)$.\n*   Applying this property repeatedly, we get $\\text{SR}(G) = \\text{SR}(g^{\\otimes n}) = (\\text{SR}(g))^n$.\n*   The problem is now reduced to finding the slice rank of the base tensor $g$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Slice Rank of the Base Tensor `g`**\n\n*   The base tensor $g$ is a $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor defined on $\\{0,1\\} \\times \\{0,1\\} \\times \\{0,1\\}$. Its entries are $g_{ijk} = i+j+k$ for $i,j,k \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n*   A key theorem states that the slice rank of a tensor of size $d_1 \\times d_2 \\times d_3$ is at most $\\min(d_1, d_2, d_3)$. For our $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor $g$, this means $\\text{SR}(g) \\le 2$.\n*   To establish a lower bound, we check if $\\text{SR}(g)=1$. A tensor has slice rank 1 if it can be written in one of the forms $a(i)B(j,k)$, $C(j)D(i,k)$, or $E(k)F(i,j)$.\n    Let's check the first form. This would imply that the \"slices\" of the tensor for different values of $i$ are proportional.\n    The slice for $i=0$ is the matrix $M_0$ with entries $M_0(j,k) = 0+j+k$, which is $M_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    The slice for $i=1$ is the matrix $M_1$ with entries $M_1(j,k) = 1+j+k$, which is $M_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    For $M_1$ to be proportional to $M_0$, we would need $M_1 = c \\cdot M_0$ for some constant $c$. This is not possible because $M_0$ has a zero entry ($M_0(0,0)=0$) while the corresponding entry in $M_1$ is non-zero ($M_1(0,0)=1$).\n    By symmetry, the other forms for slice rank 1 also fail. Therefore, $\\text{SR}(g) > 1$.\n*   Since $1 < \\text{SR}(g) \\le 2$, and the slice rank must be an integer, we conclude that $\\text{SR}(g) = 2$.\n    (Indeed, we can write $g(i,j,k) = \\delta_0(i)(j+k) + \\delta_1(i)(1+j+k)$, which is a sum of two slices along the first dimension.)\n\n**6. Determine the Asymptotic Growth and Find K**\n\n*   Combining the results, the slice rank of $F$ has the asymptotic behavior:\n    $\\text{SR}(F) \\sim \\text{SR}(G) = (\\text{SR}(g))^n = 2^n$.\n*   The problem states that the slice rank is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$.\n*   The base of the exponential growth must match. So, we equate the bases:\n    $2 = \\frac{3}{2^K}$\n*   Now, we solve for $K$:\n    $2 \\cdot 2^K = 3$\n    $2^{K+1} = 3$\n    $K+1 = \\log_2(3)$\n    $K = \\log_2(3) - 1$\n*   Using logarithm properties, this can be simplified:\n    $K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)$.\n\nFinal Answer is $K=\\log_2(1.5)$."
