    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question:**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific Christian theologian who:\n*   Developed **specialized terminology**. This implies we are looking for a unique concept or phrase, not just a general idea.\n*   This terminology can describe **changes in the laws of nature**. This means it must account for shifts in how the natural world operates, not just one-off events that seem to defy nature.\n*   The terminology must be applicable to two specific cases:\n    *   **The virgin birth of Jesus:** An event where normal biological processes are bypassed.\n    *   **Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall:** The idea that after the sin of Adam and Eve, the fundamental workings of nature itself changed (e.g., introduction of death, decay, pain, etc.).\n\n**2. Initial Brainstorming of Theologians:**\nWhen thinking about the intersection of theology, nature, miracles, and creation, several key figures come to mind: Irenaeus, Origen, Augustine of Hippo, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, and various modern theologians. The question asks who *first* developed such a system, which points us toward the Early Church Fathers.\n\n**3. Focusing on Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD):**\nAugustine is a prime candidate. He wrote extensively on creation, miracles, and the nature of reality in works like *The City of God*, *On the Trinity*, and his commentaries on Genesis (*De Genesi ad litteram*). He was deeply concerned with reconciling the apparent inconsistencies between miracles and a God who creates an ordered, good world. He sought to explain how God could act in extraordinary ways without being capricious or violating the very nature He established.\n\n**4. Identifying Augustine's Specialized Terminology:**\nAugustine developed the concept of ***rationes seminales*** (Latin for \"seminal reasons\" or \"seed-like principles\").\n\n**5. Analyzing the Terminology (*rationes seminales*):**\n*   **Definition:** Augustine, borrowing from Stoic philosophy, proposed that God, at the moment of creation, embedded latent potentialities or causal principles—the *rationes seminales*—into matter. These are the \"seeds\" of everything that would ever come into being.\n*   **The \"Course of Nature\":** Most of these \"seeds\" sprout and develop according to a regular, observable pattern, which Augustine called the \"course of nature\" (*cursus naturae*). This is what we would today call the laws of nature.\n*   **Miracles and Changes:** However, some *rationes seminales* remain dormant. A miracle, in Augustine's view, is not God violating the nature He created. Instead, it is God, acting from outside of time, causing one of these hidden, pre-ordained \"seeds\" to develop outside the normal, everyday course of nature. God is not breaking His rules; He is acting according to a deeper, more comprehensive set of rules He embedded in creation from the very beginning.\n\n**6. Applying the Terminology to the Specific Cases:**\n\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** According to this framework, the virgin birth was not an \"unnatural\" act in the sense of violating God's created order. Rather, God activated a unique *ratio seminalis* He had placed within creation (specifically, within Mary's body) that allowed for conception without a human father. This potential was always part of God's plan for creation, but it was actualized outside the normal *cursus naturae*.\n\n*   **Alterations at the Fall:** The concept of *rationes seminales* also allows for a change in the state of nature. Before the Fall, creation operated according to one set of expressed principles (e.g., harmony, immortality). After the Fall, human sin triggered a shift in which \"seeds\" became active. The latent potentialities for death, decay, pain in childbirth, and thorns and thistles—which were always part of the full scope of creation's potential—were actualized, altering the \"course of nature\" to the state we now experience. This provides a theological mechanism for how the \"laws of nature\" could have been different before the Fall.\n\n**7. Listing Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinction from \"Violation\":** It is crucial to note that Augustine's view is more subtle than the common modern idea that a miracle is a \"violation\" of natural law. For Augustine, a miracle is a fulfillment of a deeper, hidden potential within nature itself.\n*   **God's Sovereignty:** This system upholds God's sovereignty and foreknowledge. Miracles are not ad-hoc interventions but are part of the original, comprehensive plan for creation.\n*   **Historical Context:** Augustine was not working with a post-Newtonian, mathematical concept of \"laws of nature.\" He was thinking in terms of causal principles and the regular \"course\" or \"order\" of nature. Nevertheless, his terminology directly addresses the question of how this regular order can be changed or superseded.\n*   **First Theologian:** While earlier theologians discussed miracles and the Fall, Augustine was the one who systematically developed this specific philosophical and theological terminology (*rationes seminales*) to provide a coherent explanation applicable to both phenomena.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe theologian who fits all the criteria is Augustine of Hippo. He developed the specialized terminology of *rationes seminales* (\"seminal reasons\") to explain how the observable \"course of nature\" could be altered or bypassed. This framework accounts for both singular miracles like the virgin birth and systemic changes to nature, such as those that may have occurred at the Fall, by positing that God is activating latent potentialities that He embedded in creation from the beginning.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
