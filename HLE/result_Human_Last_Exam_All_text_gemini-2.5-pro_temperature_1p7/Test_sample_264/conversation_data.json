    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step 1: Define the initial setup and coordinate system.\nLet's place the first cube, which we'll call Cube A, in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. We can define Cube A as the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n0 ≤ z ≤ 1\nThis is a cube with a side length of 1, located at the origin. Its volume is 1³ = 1.\n\n### Step 2: Understand and quantify the shift.\nThe problem states that the second cube (Cube B) is shifted relative to the first \"along the main diagonal\".\n*   **Main Diagonal:** For Cube A in our chosen coordinate system, a main diagonal connects the vertex at the origin (0, 0, 0) to the opposite vertex at (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is **D** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **Direction of Shift:** The shift is \"along the main diagonal\", which means the shift vector, let's call it **s**, must be in the same direction as **D**. Therefore, the shift vector can be written as **s** = (t, t, t) for some positive scalar t.\n*   **Magnitude of Shift:** The shift is \"by 1/2\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. We will analyze the most likely interpretations:\n    1.  **Interpretation A:** The magnitude (distance) of the shift is 1/2. The length of the shift vector is ||**s**|| = ||(t, t, t)|| = √(t² + t² + t²) = t√3. If we set t√3 = 1/2, we get t = 1/(2√3). This would result in a complex, irrational answer for the final volume, which is unlikely for this type of problem.\n    2.  **Interpretation B:** The displacement is 1/2 for each component of the vector that defines the diagonal. This means t = 1/2, making the shift vector **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n    3.  **Justification for Interpretation B:** A very plausible way to read \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is that the shift distance is 1/2 of the length of the main diagonal itself. The length of the main diagonal is ||**D**|| = √3. A shift of half this length would be (1/2)√3. Equating this to the shift distance:\n        t√3 = (1/2)√3\n        This gives **t = 1/2**.\n\nThis interpretation is the most reasonable as it leads to a simple, rational result, which is typical for such contest-style math problems. We will proceed with the shift vector **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n### Step 3: Define the position of the second cube.\nCube B is simply Cube A shifted by the vector **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). To find the coordinates of Cube B, we add the shift vector to the coordinates of Cube A:\nCube B is the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\n### Step 4: Determine the region of intersection.\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the set of points (x, y, z) that satisfy the conditions for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We need to find the intersection of their coordinate ranges.\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] AND [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection of these two intervals is [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] AND [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] AND [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is [1/2, 1].\n\nSo, the region of intersection is a smaller cube defined by 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1, 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the volume of the intersection.\nThe intersection is a cube. We can find its side length from the coordinate ranges calculated in the previous step.\n*   Side length = (upper bound - lower bound) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\nThe volume of a cube is (side length)³.\n*   Volume of intersection = (1/2)³ = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8.\n\nThe volume of the intersection of the two cubes is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
