    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the key components of the question:**\n    *   **Drug Container:** A single-dose container, specifically an **ampule**.\n    *   **Action:** It has been punctured (or more accurately, opened/broken).\n    *   **Environment:** The action occurs in a **sterile environment** (defined by standards like USP <797> as an ISO Class 5 or better environment).\n    *   **Question:** What is the **Beyond-Use Date (BUD)**?\n\n2.  **Define \"Ampule\":** An ampule is a hermetically sealed glass container that holds a single dose of medication. To access the medication, the neck of the ampule must be broken. Crucially, once opened, it cannot be resealed. This makes it an \"open-system\" container.\n\n3.  **Consult Authoritative Guidelines (USP <797>):** The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations\" provides the standards for sterile compounding, including BUDs.\n\n4.  **Apply the USP <797> Rule for Ampules:**\n    *   USP <797> is very specific about opened ampules. Because they are open systems that cannot be resealed, they are highly susceptible to microbial contamination after being opened.\n    *   The standard mandates that once an ampule is opened, its contents must be used **immediately**.\n    *   Any unused portion of the drug remaining in the ampule must be discarded and cannot be stored for future use.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on BUD:**\n    *   Based on the USP <797> guideline, there is no permissible storage time for an opened ampule.\n    *   Therefore, the concept of a BUD in terms of hours or days of storage does not apply. The BUD is effectively \"immediate use.\" The medication must be withdrawn and used in a single, continuous procedure.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ampule vs. Vial:** This is the most common point of confusion. The rules for ampules are different from those for vials. A **single-dose vial** (with a rubber stopper) can be used for up to **12 hours** after the initial puncture if it is maintained in an ISO Class 5 environment. An ampule does not have a resealable stopper, which is why its rule is much stricter.\n\n2.  **Impact of Sterile Environment:** While opening the ampule in a sterile environment minimizes immediate contamination, it does not override the physical limitation of the container. Since the ampule remains open and cannot be sealed, the risk of contamination over time is still unacceptably high, leading to the \"immediate use\" rule.\n\n3.  **Definition of \"Immediate Use\":** This term generally refers to administration that begins within 1 hour of the preparation of the dose. It implies that the withdrawal of the drug and its subsequent administration are part of a single, continuous process without delay or storage.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAccording to USP <797> guidelines, an opened single-dose ampule must be used immediately. Any unused portion must be discarded. It cannot be stored for any period, even if it was opened in a sterile environment. Therefore, a storage BUD does not apply.\n\n<<<Immediate use only; no storage is permitted.>>>"
