    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to derive the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral and Identify the Singularity**\nThe integral is given by:\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$\nLet the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + g(x)$, where $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$.\nWe are interested in the behavior of $I(\\epsilon)$ for very small positive values of $\\epsilon$ ($\\epsilon \\to 0^+$).\nThe integrand $\\frac{1}{D(x, \\epsilon)}$ becomes very large when the denominator $D(x, \\epsilon)$ becomes very small. This happens when $g(x)$ is close to zero, since $\\epsilon$ is small.\nWe need to find the minimum value of $g(x)$ on the integration interval $[0, 15.00]$.\nThe function $g(x)$ is a sum of terms with positive coefficients and even/odd powers of $x$. For $x \\ge 0$, $g(x) \\ge 0$. The minimum value occurs at $x=0$, where $g(0) = 0$.\nTherefore, for small $\\epsilon$, the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n\n**Step 2: Approximate the Denominator for Small x**\nNear $x=0$, we can approximate $g(x)$ by its term with the lowest power of $x$, as higher powers of $x$ will be negligible in comparison.\n$g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0} \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$ for small $x$.\nSo, the integral can be approximated by:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Integral by Extending the Integration Limit**\nThe integrand is significant only for small $x$. For larger $x$, say $x=15$, the term $9.0 x^{5.0}$ is very large, and the contribution to the integral is negligible, especially compared to the contribution from the region near $x=0$. Thus, extending the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to $\\infty$ will not change the leading-order asymptotic behavior of the integral. This simplifies the calculation.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Approximate Integral using Substitution**\nLet's evaluate the integral $J = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\nWe use a substitution to simplify the expression. Let $u = 9.0 x^{5.0}$.\nFrom this, we have $x^{5.0} = u / 9.0$, so $x = (u/9.0)^{1/5.0}$.\nThe differential $dx$ is found by differentiating $x$:\n$dx = (1/9.0)^{1/5.0} \\cdot \\frac{1}{5.0} u^{(1/5.0)-1} du = \\frac{1}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0}} u^{-4/5.0} du$.\nThe limits of integration for $u$ are from $9.0 \\cdot 0^{5.0} = 0$ to $9.0 \\cdot \\infty^{5.0} = \\infty$.\nSubstituting these into the integral $J$:\n$J = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + u} \\left( \\frac{1}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0}} u^{-4/5.0} \\right) du$\n$J = \\frac{1}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{-4/5.0}}{\\epsilon + u} du$\n\n**Step 5: Rescale the Integral to Isolate the Dependence on $\\epsilon$**\nThe integral still depends on $\\epsilon$. We perform a second substitution to factor out $\\epsilon$.\nLet $u = \\epsilon t$. This implies $du = \\epsilon dt$. The integration limits for $t$ are still from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n$J = \\frac{1}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\epsilon t)^{-4/5.0}}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon t} (\\epsilon dt)$\n$J = \\frac{1}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5.0} t^{-4/5.0}}{\\epsilon(1+t)} \\epsilon dt$\nThe $\\epsilon$ terms in the numerator and denominator cancel:\n$J = \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5.0}}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{-4/5.0}}{1+t} dt$\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the Standard Integral**\nThe remaining integral is a well-known definite integral related to the Euler Beta function. Its value is given by the formula:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{p-1}}{1+t} dt = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(p\\pi)}$, valid for $0 < p < 1$.\nIn our case, the exponent is $-4/5.0$. So, we have $p-1 = -4/5.0$, which gives $p = 1 - 4/5.0 = 1/5.0 = 0.2$. This value of $p$ is in the valid range $(0, 1)$.\nSo, the integral evaluates to:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{t^{-4/5.0}}{1+t} dt = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$\n\n**Step 7: Assemble the Final Analytical Formula**\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $J$, we obtain the final approximation for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx J = \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5.0}}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0}} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{\\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$\nThis can be written more cleanly as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\epsilon^{-4/5.0}$\n\nLet's write the exponents in decimal form to match the problem's notation:\n$1/5.0 = 0.2$ and $4/5.0 = 0.8$.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{0.2} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\epsilon^{-0.8}$\nThis is the analytical formula that approximates $I(\\epsilon)$ for the small $\\epsilon$ regime.\n\n<<<I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\epsilon^{-4/5.0}>>>"
