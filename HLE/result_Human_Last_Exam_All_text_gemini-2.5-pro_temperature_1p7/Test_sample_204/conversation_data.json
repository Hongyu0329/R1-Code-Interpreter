    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Vector Field Structure**\n\nThe given vector field `n = (nx, ny, nz)` is defined in terms of spherical coordinates on a unit sphere. Let's identify the polar and azimuthal angles.\n- The standard spherical coordinates for a unit vector are `(sin(θ)cos(φ), sin(θ)sin(φ), cos(θ))`, where `θ` is the polar angle (from the +z axis) and `φ` is the azimuthal angle (in the xy-plane).\n- Comparing this to the given field:\n  - `nx = sin(G)cos(f)`\n  - `ny = sin(G)sin(f)`\n  - `nz = cos(G)`\n- We can see that `G` plays the role of the polar angle `θ`, and `f` plays the role of the azimuthal angle `φ`. The condition `nx² + ny² + nz² = sin²(G) + cos²(G) = 1` is satisfied, so `n` is a unit vector field, representing a map from the space `R³` to the sphere `S²`.\n\n**2. Analyze the Angular Components `f` and `G`**\n\n*   **Azimuthal Angle `f`:** `f = atan2(y,x)`. This is the standard cylindrical coordinate angle `φ` in 3D space. As we traverse a circle around the z-axis in `(x,y,z)` space, the angle `f` goes from `0` to `2π`. The azimuthal angle of the vector `n` also goes from `0` to `2π`. This corresponds to a toroidal winding number of `k=1`.\n\n*   **Polar Angle `G`:** `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`, where `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)² + z*z)`. The angle `G` determines how much the vector `n` is tilted away from the z-axis. Let `ρ² = x² + y²`. Then `r2 = sqrt((ρ² - 0.5)² + z²)`.\n\n**3. Examine the Boundary Conditions and Preimages**\n\nThe Hopf charge is a topological invariant, meaning it depends on the global structure of the map from `R³` (compactified to `S³`) to `S²`. To understand this structure, we look at the preimages of specific points on the `S²` target space, particularly the north and south poles.\n\n*   **Preimage of the North Pole (`n = (0,0,1)`):**\n    This corresponds to `nz = cos(G) = 1`, which means `G = 0`.\n    `PI * exp(-10 * r2) = 0` implies `exp(-10 * r2) = 0`, which happens when `r2 → ∞`.\n    `r2` goes to infinity when `x`, `y`, or `z` go to infinity. This means the entire boundary at infinity of `R³` maps to the north pole of `S²`. This is the necessary condition for the Hopf charge to be well-defined.\n\n*   **Preimage of the South Pole (`n = (0,0,-1)`):**\n    This corresponds to `nz = cos(G) = -1`, which means `G = PI`.\n    `PI * exp(-10 * r2) = PI` implies `exp(-10 * r2) = 1`. This requires the exponent to be zero, so `-10 * r2 = 0`, which means `r2 = 0`.\n    For `r2` to be zero, `(ρ² - 0.5)² + z² = 0`. This is only possible if both terms are zero:\n    - `z = 0`\n    - `ρ² - 0.5 = 0`  =>  `ρ² = x² + y² = 0.5`\n    The preimage of the south pole is a circle in the `xy`-plane (`z=0`) with radius `sqrt(0.5)`, centered at the origin.\n\n**4. Interpret the Field as a Hopfion**\n\nThe vector field has the characteristic structure of an axisymmetric Hopfion. For such fields, the Hopf charge `H` can be calculated as the product of two integer winding numbers: `H = k * p`.\n\n*   `k`: The toroidal winding number, which describes how many times the vector `n` wraps around the z-axis as one goes around the z-axis in space. As established in step 2, `f = φ`, so `k = 1`.\n*   `p`: The poloidal winding number. It describes how the polar angle `G` varies from the \"center\" of the structure to \"infinity\". It can be calculated as `p = (G_center - G_infinity) / PI`.\n    - `G_center` is the value of `G` at the core of the topological structure, which is the preimage of the south pole (the circle `x²+y²=0.5, z=0`). Here, `G = PI`.\n    - `G_infinity` is the value of `G` at the boundary of space. Here, `G = 0`.\n    - Therefore, `p = (PI - 0) / PI = 1`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Hopf Charge**\n\nUsing the formula `H = k * p`:\n- `H = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\nThe structure is a mapping where the preimages of points on `S²` are loops in `R³`. The Hopf charge is the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points on `S²`. Taking the preimages of the North Pole (the point at infinity, which acts like an axis) and the South Pole (the circle `x²+y²=0.5, z=0`), we can see that they are linked once, confirming `H=1`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Field Structure Recognition:** The key is to recognize that `(nx, ny, nz)` can be described by spherical angles `(G, f)` and that this structure matches the Hopfion ansatz.\n2.  **Boundary Conditions:** Verifying that the field goes to a constant vector at infinity (`n -> (0,0,1)`) is crucial. This ensures the map is well-defined from `S³` (the one-point compactification of `R³`) to `S²`.\n3.  **Hopfion Formula:** Using the `H = k * p` formula is a standard method for axisymmetric Hopfions. `k` is read directly from the azimuthal dependency (`f = kφ`), and `p` is determined by the total change in `G/π` from the structure's core to its boundary.\n4.  **Geometric Interpretation:** The linking number interpretation confirms the result. The preimage of the south pole is a circle. The preimage of the north pole is the \"loop at infinity\", which is topologically equivalent to the z-axis passing through the center of the first circle. These two loops have a linking number of 1.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the Hopf charge of the given field is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
