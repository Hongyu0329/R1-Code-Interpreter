    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Meter and Syllabify**\nThe line is from Plautus' *Mercator* and is a **trochaic septenarius**. This meter consists of seven trochaic feet (base form: L S) plus a final catalectic syllable, totaling 15 syllables. Plautine meter allows for frequent substitutions and hiatus (ignoring elision), especially at the main caesura (break) in the middle of the line. The line has 15 syllables, so we will assume no elision.\n\nLine: `et | ti-bi | be-ne | es-se | so-li | quom | si-bi | sit | ma-le`\n\n**Step 2: Determine Syllable Quantities**\nWe determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on its vowel nature and position.\n\n*   `et`: The vowel `e` is short, but the syllable ends in a consonant (`t`) and is followed by another consonant (`t` in `tibi`). This makes it long by position. -> **L**\n*   `ti-bi`: Both `i`'s are short by nature. -> **S S**\n*   `be-ne`: Both `e`'s are short by nature. -> **S S**\n*   `es-se`: The syllable `es-` is followed by another `s`, making it long by position. The final `-se` has a short `e`. -> **L S**\n*   `so-li`: In the dative of `solus`, the `o` and `i` are both long by nature. -> **L L**\n*   `quom`: This is an old form of `cum`. The `o` is long by nature. -> **L**\n*   `si-bi`: Both `i`'s are short by nature. -> **S S**\n*   `sit`: The `i` is short, but the syllable is long by position because it's followed by a consonant (`m` in `male`). -> **L**\n*   `ma-le`: The `a` in `malus` and the final adverbial `-e` are both short. -> **S S**\n\n**Step 3: Group Syllables into Metrical Feet**\nNow we group the sequence of quantities (L S S S S L S L L L S S L S S) into the seven and a half feet of a trochaic septenarius, allowing for standard substitutions. The base foot is a trochee (L S).\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `et ti-`\n    *   Quantities: **L S**\n    *   This is a perfect **trochee**.\n\n*   **Foot 2:** `bi be ne`\n    *   Quantities: **S S S**\n    *   This is a **tribrach**, a common substitution for a trochee.\n\n*   **Foot 3:** `es se`\n    *   Quantities: **L S**\n    *   This is a perfect **trochee**.\n\n*   **Foot 4:** `so li`\n    *   Quantities: **L L**\n    *   This is a **spondee**, a common substitution for a trochee. (The main caesura typically falls here).\n\n*   **Foot 5:** `quom si-`\n    *   Quantities: **L S**\n    *   This is a perfect **trochee**.\n\n*   **Foot 6:** `bi sit`\n    *   Quantities: **S L**\n    *   This is an **iamb**. In Plautus, an iamb can substitute for a trochee, especially in the even-numbered feet (2, 4, 6).\n\n*   **Foot 7 & Catalexis:** `-ma le`\n    *   Quantities: **S S**\n    *   This is a **pyrrhic**. This is the most complex part of the line. For the meter to resolve, a pyrrhic (`S S`) is allowed as a substitution for the final trochee (`L S`) in some analyses of comic verse, especially after the rhythmic disturbance of the preceding iamb. This allows the 15-syllable line to fit into 7 full feet, making it an *acatalectic* septenarius (ending on a full foot) rather than the more common catalectic form.\n\nCombining these feet gives the final scansion.\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L L L S S L S S>>>"
