    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space and its properties.**\nThe space of $k$-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ or $Gr(k,n)$. The question asks about the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, which is $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n\nThere is a homeomorphism between $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ and $G_{n-k}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, given by taking the orthogonal complement of a subspace. Therefore, $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is homeomorphic to $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. We will analyze $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n\nThe dimension of $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is $k(n-k)$. For $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the dimension is $2 \\times (5-2) = 6$.\nA Grassmannian $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is orientable if and only if $n$ is even. For $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, $n=5$ is odd, so the manifold is non-orientable. This affects its top-dimensional cohomology group.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the question.**\nThe question asks for the **rank** of the **torsion subgroup** of the **integral cohomology ring** $H^*(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n- The integral cohomology ring is the direct sum of integral cohomology groups in each degree: $H^*(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$. This is a finitely generated graded abelian group.\n- The torsion subgroup of an abelian group $A$ is the subgroup $T(A)$ consisting of all elements of finite order.\n- The rank of a finitely generated abelian group $A \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T(A)$ is the number of $\\mathbb{Z}$ factors, which is $r$. For any abelian group $A$, its rank is defined as the dimension of the vector space $A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the integral cohomology groups of $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.**\nThe computation of the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is a classic but non-trivial result in algebraic topology. We rely on established computations from the mathematical literature (e.g., papers by A. Borel, S. Podkorytov, Á. Korbaš, among others).\n\nThe integral cohomology groups of $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ are as follows:\n*   $H^0(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ (since the space is connected)\n*   $H^1(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^2(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^5(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^6(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (since the manifold is compact, connected, non-orientable of dimension 6)\n*   $H^i(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $i > 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring.**\nThe cohomology ring, viewed as an abelian group, is the direct sum of the groups for each degree:\n$A = H^*(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}) = H^0 \\oplus H^1 \\oplus H^2 \\oplus H^3 \\oplus H^4 \\oplus H^5 \\oplus H^6$\n$A \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n\nBy rearranging terms, we can separate the free part and the torsion part:\n$A \\cong (\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^3 \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$.\n\nThe torsion subgroup $T(A)$ is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each $H^i$:\n$T(A) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the rank of the torsion subgroup.**\nThe question asks for the rank of the group $T(A) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$. According to the standard definition, the rank of any torsion group is 0. Let's verify this using the definition of rank.\nThe rank of an abelian group $G$ is $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q})$.\nFor the group $T(A) = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$, let's compute the tensor product with $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5 \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$.\nFor any element $x \\in (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5$, we have $2x = 0$. Consider a simple tensor $x \\otimes q \\in (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5 \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$x \\otimes q = x \\otimes (2 \\cdot \\frac{q}{2}) = (2x) \\otimes \\frac{q}{2} = 0 \\otimes \\frac{q}{2} = 0$.\nSince every simple tensor is 0, the entire tensor product group is the zero group: $(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^5 \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q} = \\{0\\}$.\nThe dimension of the zero vector space is 0.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the torsion subgroup is 0.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Identification of the space:** It is crucial to correctly identify the space as the Grassmannian $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ and know its equivalence to $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n2.  **Cohomology calculation:** The calculation of the integral cohomology groups of Grassmannians is complex. Relying on established results from the literature is the most reliable approach here. The non-orientability of the manifold is important for the top cohomology group.\n3.  **Definition of \"Rank\":** The main subtlety lies in the interpretation of the word \"rank\". In modern algebra, the rank of an abelian group is uniquely defined as the rank of its free part, which is 0 for any torsion group. While other notions like the minimal number of generators exist, they are not referred to as \"rank\" without qualification. Assuming the standard mathematical definition is key.\n4.  **Torsion of the whole ring:** The torsion subgroup of the direct sum of groups is the direct sum of their torsion subgroups.\n\nFinal analysis confirms that the calculation is robust based on standard mathematical definitions and established results.\n\n>>>0"
