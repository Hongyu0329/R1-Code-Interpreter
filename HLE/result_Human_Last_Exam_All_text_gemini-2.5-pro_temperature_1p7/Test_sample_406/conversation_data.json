    "This problem requires finding the conditions under which a system of three functions has a \"tripled fixed point\". This is a classic application of fixed-point theory, specifically the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, extended to a system of equations on a product of metric spaces.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Components:**\n    *   **Spaces:** We are given three non-empty sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z`. For fixed-point theorems to apply, these sets must be metric spaces, and typically, they must be complete.\n    *   **Functions:** We have three functions:\n        *   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n        *   `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n        *   `H: Z * Y * X → Z`\n        (Note: The question listed `G` twice; it is standard to interpret the second one as `H` to create a complete system for a tripled point `(x, y, z)`).\n    *   **The Goal:** We need to find the conditions for the existence (and typically, uniqueness) of an \"FGH-tripled fixed point\". This is a point `(x, y, z) ∈ X * Y * Z` that simultaneously satisfies the three equations:\n        1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n        2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n        3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n2.  **Strategy: The Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\n    The most powerful tool for this type of problem is the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. It states that a contraction mapping on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point. Our strategy will be to reformulate the problem of finding an FGH-tripled fixed point into a problem of finding a single fixed point for a combined operator on a product space.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Metric Space Requirement:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be metric spaces. Let their respective metrics be `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n2.  **Completeness Requirement:** For the Banach theorem to apply, the underlying metric space must be complete. Therefore, we must require that `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are all complete metric spaces.\n3.  **Product Space:** The point `(x, y, z)` belongs to the Cartesian product `M = X * Y * Z`. We need to define a metric `d` on this product space that makes `(M, d)` a complete metric space. A standard choice that works well is the **sum metric**:\n    `d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    If `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete, then the product space `M` with this metric is also complete.\n4.  **Combined Operator:** The system of three equations can be viewed as a single fixed-point equation `T(p) = p`, where `p = (x, y, z)` and `T` is an operator mapping `M` to `M`. The definition of `T` comes directly from the functions `F, G, H`:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n5.  **The Contraction Condition:** The crucial condition is that the operator `T` must be a **contraction mapping**. This means there must exist a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `p₁` and `p₂` in `M`, the distance between their images under `T` is smaller than the original distance by at least a factor of `k`.\n    `d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d(p₁, p₂)`\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Derivation\n\nLet's derive the explicit condition on `F`, `G`, and `H` by applying the contraction definition to our operator `T` and product metric `d`.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the Framework**\n*   Assume `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces.\n*   Consider the product space `M = X * Y * Z` with the complete metric `d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n*   Define the operator `T: M → M` by `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`. An FGH-tripled fixed point is a fixed point of `T`.\n\n**Step 2: State the Requirement**\nAccording to the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem, `T` will have a unique fixed point if it is a contraction mapping.\n\n**Step 3: Write out the Contraction Inequality**\nLet `p₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` be two arbitrary points in `M`. The contraction condition `d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d(p₁, p₂)` becomes:\n\n`d( (F(x₁,y₁,z₁), G(y₁,x₁,y₁), H(z₁,y₁,x₁)), (F(x₂,y₂,z₂), G(y₂,x₂,y₂), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ) ≤ k * d((x₁,y₁,z₁), (x₂,y₂,z₂))`\n\n**Step 4: Expand the Inequality using the Metric Definitions**\nUsing the definition of the sum metric `d`, we expand both sides of the inequality.\n\n*   **Left-hand side:**\n    `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂))`\n\n*   **Right-hand side:**\n    `k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the Final Conditions**\nCombining the expanded parts gives the explicit condition that `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy. This leads to the final answer.\n\n**The two main conditions are:**\n\n1.  **Structural Condition:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **complete metric spaces**.\n2.  **Contractive Condition:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must collectively satisfy a joint contraction inequality. Specifically, there must exist a constant `k` with `0 ≤ k < 1` such that for all points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `X * Y * Z`, the following holds:\n    `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k * [d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)]`\n\nIf these two conditions are met, the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem guarantees that there exists a **unique** point `(x, y, z)` that is an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n<<<Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be complete metric spaces. The functions `F: X * Y * Z → X`, `G: Y * X * Y → Y`, and `H: Z * Y * X → Z` have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, and `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following joint contraction inequality is satisfied:\n`d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`>>>"
