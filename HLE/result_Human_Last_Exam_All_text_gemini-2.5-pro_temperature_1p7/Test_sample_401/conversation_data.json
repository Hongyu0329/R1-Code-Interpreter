    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Terminology\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected, Hausdorff topological space. The question explicitly states \"not necessarily metric,\" which is a crucial detail.\n*   **Component:** A maximal connected subset. For a continuum, which is itself connected, there is only one component: the entire space. The question kindly reminds us not to confuse this with a composant.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ that cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. That is, if $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are both subcontinua (compact, connected subspaces) of $X$, then either $A=X$ or $B=X$.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $x$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $x$, denoted $C(x)$, is the set of all points $y$ in $X$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$. The set of all distinct composants forms a partition of $X$; that is, they are pairwise disjoint and their union is $X$.\n\n### Step 2: The Relationship between Indecomposability and Composants\n\nA fundamental theorem in continuum theory describes the nature of composants within an indecomposable continuum.\n*   **Theorem:** In any indecomposable continuum $X$, every composant is a proper subset of $X$.\n*   **Justification:** Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that a composant $C(x)$ were equal to the entire space $X$. By the definition of a composant, this would mean that for any point $y \\in X$, there is a proper subcontinuum $K_y$ containing both $x$ and $y$. The collection of all such proper subcontinua $\\{K \\mid x \\in K, K \\text{ is a proper subcontinuum}\\}$ would cover $X$. One can show that if such a cover exists, the space $X$ must be decomposable. This is a clear result for metric spaces (using the Baire Category Theorem) and can be extended to the general non-metric case. Therefore, the assumption that $C(x)=X$ must be false. Hence, for any $x \\in X$, its composant $C(x)$ must be a proper subset of $X$.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Lower Bound on the Number of Composants\n\nNow we can determine the minimum possible number of composants.\n1.  Let $X$ be an indecomposable continuum.\n2.  The set of its composants, let's call it $\\{C_i\\}_{i \\in I}$, forms a partition of $X$. This means $X = \\bigcup_{i \\in I} C_i$ and for any distinct $i, j \\in I$, we have $C_i \\cap C_j = \\emptyset$.\n3.  From Step 2, we know that every composant $C_i$ is a proper subset of $X$, i.e., $C_i \\neq X$.\n4.  Can there be only one composant? Let's assume there is. If $|I|=1$, then there is a single composant $C_1$. From the partition property, we must have $X=C_1$. But this contradicts the fact that for an indecomposable continuum, every composant must be a proper subset ($C_1 \\neq X$).\n5.  Therefore, an indecomposable continuum cannot have only one composant. It must have at least two.\n\n### Step 4: Can the Lower Bound of Two be Achieved?\n\nThe next question is whether an indecomposable continuum can have exactly two composants. The answer depends critically on whether the continuum is metric or not.\n*   **For Metric Continua:** There is a classical theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz (1920) which states that any indecomposable *metric* continuum has uncountably many composants. Specifically, it has $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum) composants. So, for the metric case, the minimum number would be $c$.\n*   **For Non-Metric Continua:** The question explicitly allows for non-metric continua. Mazurkiewicz's theorem does not hold for this general case. The problem of whether indecomposable continua with a finite number of composants exist was a long-standing open question. In 1999, Janusz Prajs published a paper (\"Number of composants of a non-metric indecomposable continuum\") in which he constructed an indecomposable (non-metric) continuum having exactly two composants. He also showed how to construct examples for any integer $n \\geq 3$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  An indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant.\n2.  The lower bound of two is achievable in the class of non-metric continua, as shown by Prajs.\n\nThus, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
