    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Determine the Base Health in Expert Mode**\n    *   The Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Classic Mode (for a single player) is 2,800.\n    *   In Expert Mode, this base health is increased. For a single player, its health is 3,640. This value is the starting point for any multiplayer scaling calculations in Expert Mode.\n\n2.  **Identify the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula**\n    *   In Expert Mode, the health of bosses scales with the number of players present in the world. This is to ensure the boss remains a challenge for larger groups.\n    *   The health multiplier is determined by the formula: `Multiplier = 1 + (NumberOfPlayers - 1) * 0.35`. Let's denote the number of players as `N`. The formula becomes `Multiplier = 1 + (N - 1) * 0.35`.\n    *   The final health is calculated by multiplying the single-player Expert Mode health by this multiplier:\n        `Final Health = 3640 * (1 + (N - 1) * 0.35)`\n\n3.  **Analyze the Impact of \"Infinite Players\"**\n    *   The question poses a theoretical scenario with an infinite number of players (`N` → ∞).\n    *   If we look at the formula `3640 * (1 + (N - 1) * 0.35)`, as `N` increases, the value of the expression also increases without any mathematical bound.\n    *   Expanding the formula: `3640 * (1 + 0.35N - 0.35) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35N)`.\n    *   As `N` approaches infinity, the `0.35N` term causes the entire expression to approach infinity. Mathematically, the health would be infinite.\n\n4.  **Consider the Game's Technical Limitations**\n    *   A video game, however, is not a pure mathematical system. It has technical limitations based on its programming.\n    *   In the source code of Terraria, the variable used to store the health of any Non-Player Character (NPC), including bosses, is `NPC.lifeMax`.\n    *   This variable is defined as a 32-bit signed integer (an `int` in the C# language).\n    *   A 32-bit signed integer has a finite range of values it can store. The maximum value is 2^31 - 1.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Theoretical Maximum Health**\n    *   The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2,147,483,647.\n    *   Although the health formula scales towards infinity with an infinite number of players, the game's code cannot store a value larger than this maximum.\n    *   When the calculation for `Final Health` results in a number that exceeds 2,147,483,647, the game engine will cap it at this maximum value.\n    *   Therefore, the *theoretical maximum health* that the Eye of Cthulhu can actually have within the game is limited by the maximum value of the data type used to store it.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Expert Mode Scaling:** The per-player health scaling (`+35%` per additional player) is a feature of Expert Mode and Master Mode. Classic Mode does not have this mechanic.\n*   **Theoretical vs. Practical:** The question asks for the *theoretical* maximum, which in this context means pushing the scaling formula to its limit within the game's technical constraints, not just the practical limit of players on a server (which is typically 255).\n*   **Data Type Limitation:** The key to solving this problem is understanding that software has hard limits. The choice of a 32-bit integer for health is the ultimate limiting factor, overriding the endlessly scaling mathematical formula.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, while the health scaling formula would yield an infinite result for an infinite number of players, the game's engine is limited by the 32-bit signed integer used for the health variable. The maximum value for this data type is the ultimate cap.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
