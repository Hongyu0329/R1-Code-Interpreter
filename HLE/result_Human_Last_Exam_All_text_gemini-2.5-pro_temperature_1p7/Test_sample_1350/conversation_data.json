    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from William Morris's novel, *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must fulfill three specific criteria:\n1.  They must have visited a Roman city.\n2.  They must describe the religious practices they observed there.\n3.  This description must be a clear allusion to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus, particularly the detail of being nursed by a she-wolf.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\nTo answer this correctly, we need to be careful about the following:\n*   **The specific text:** The answer must come directly from the events and dialogue within *The House of the Wolfings*, not from a general summary or another of Morris's works.\n*   **Character backstories:** The key characters (Thiodolf, Hall-Sun, the Wood-Sun) have distinct histories. We must identify the one whose past involves contact with the Romans.\n*   **The nature of the description:** The question specifies that the description is an allusion that \"readers will recognize.\" This implies the character might not use the names \"Romulus\" and \"Remus\" but will describe the core elements of their story.\n*   **Context:** The description is likely to be delivered from the character's perspective as a Germanic tribesperson, perhaps contrasting Roman beliefs with their own. The Wolfings, as their name suggests, have their own relationship with wolves, which would make the Roman myth particularly noteworthy to them.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Candidates:** The main characters are Thiodolf, the war-leader of the Wolfings; his daughter, Hall-Sun; and his foster-mother, the semi-divine Wood-Sun. Of these, Thiodolf is presented as having the most worldly experience beyond the tribe. His past is a central part of the plot.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Thiodolf's Backstory:** It is revealed in the novel that Thiodolf, in his youth, served with the Romans as a leader of Gothic auxiliaries. This experience would have given him direct, personal knowledge of Roman cities, their military, and their culture, including their religious beliefs. This makes him the most likely character to have visited a Roman city.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Passage:** In Chapter VI, titled \"Thiodolf telleth of the Town of the Romans,\" there is a scene where the Wolfings are at a feast and ask Thiodolf to tell them about the Romans. This is the exact context the question describes.\n\n4.  **Examine Thiodolf's Description:** During his speech, Thiodolf describes Roman religion. He speaks of the \"God-kin of the Wolf\" worshipped by the Romans. He tells the assembled tribe that the Romans worship \"two brethren, who, being twin-born, were cast out into the wildwood, and a She-wolf... nourished them, and they grew great and strong and terrible, and built them a city on the Tiber.\"\n\n5.  **Confirm the Allusion:** This description is an unmistakable and direct reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus. It includes all the key elements: twin brothers, being cast out as infants, being nursed by a she-wolf, and founding a city. Thiodolf even mentions that the image of the she-wolf and the twins is the Romans' \"holiest token.\"\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Thiodolf is the character who spent time with the Romans, visited their cities, and recounts their founding myth about twin brothers suckled by a she-wolf to his kinsfolk.\n\n<<<Thiodolf>>>"
