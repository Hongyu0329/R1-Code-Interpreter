    "This problem requires us to determine the number of distinct regions a square piece of paper is divided into by the complete set of creases from folding a standard origami crane. We can solve this by systematically analyzing the creases added at each stage of the folding process.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **The Base Folds (Preliminary Fold / Square Base):**\n    A standard crane begins with a series of base folds that form what is known as a \"preliminary fold\" or \"square base\". When unfolded, these creases are:\n    *   One horizontal fold through the center.\n    *   One vertical fold through the center.\n    *   Two diagonal folds connecting opposite corners.\n    These four lines all intersect at the exact center of the paper. This base grid divides the square into **8** triangular regions.\n\n2.  **The Bird Base Folds:**\n    The next step in folding a crane is to transform the Square Base into a \"Bird Base\". This is done by performing a \"petal fold\" on two opposing flaps of the Square Base. When analyzing the crease pattern (CP), this adds a new set of folds. The most common way to represent the final Bird Base CP is to add a square connecting the midpoints of the four sides of the paper to the basic 8-region grid from Step 1.\n\n    *   Let's verify the number of regions for this Bird Base CP. The two median lines divide the paper into four smaller squares. Let's look at one of these small squares (e.g., the top-right one). This square is crossed by one diagonal line and one edge of the new connecting square. These two lines do not intersect within the small square. A single region split by two non-intersecting lines results in 3 regions.\n    *   Since this is symmetrical for all four small squares, the total number of regions is 4 Ã— 3 = **12**.\n    *   So, the creases for the Bird Base divide the paper into **12** regions.\n\n3.  **The Narrowing Folds (Neck and Tail):**\n    After forming the Bird Base, two of the opposing \"points\" are made narrower to become the neck and tail. This is done by folding the outer edges of each point to its center line. For both the neck and the tail, this involves two folds (one on the left flap, one on the right flap), resulting in a total of four new crease lines on the final pattern.\n    *   Each of these four new crease lines is an edge that connects a corner of the paper to a vertex of the central diamond of the crease pattern. Adding a new edge between two existing vertices on a planar graph always splits a single region into two.\n    *   Therefore, these four new creases add 4 regions to our count.\n    *   Region Count: 12 + 4 = **16** regions.\n\n4.  **The Wing Folds:**\n    The remaining two points of the Bird Base are folded down to form the wings. This creates one new, primary crease for each wing.\n    *   These two new creases each split an existing region in two.\n    *   Therefore, the wing folds add 2 more regions.\n    *   Region Count: 16 + 2 = **18** regions.\n\n5.  **The Head Fold:**\n    Finally, the head is formed by performing an \"inside reverse fold\" on the tip of the neck. This single action creates a small V-shaped crease on the unfolded paper.\n    *   This V-shaped crease is composed of two new line segments that meet at a point. This V-shape is located inside one of the long, narrow regions that form the neck.\n    *   Adding a V-shape inside a region divides that one region into three new regions (the area inside the V, and the areas on either side of it). This results in a net gain of 2 regions (as one region is replaced by three).\n    *   Therefore, the head fold adds the final 2 regions.\n    *   Region Count: 18 + 2 = **20** regions.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Standard Crane:** The analysis assumes the most common, traditional origami crane model.\n*   **Crease Identification:** Every fold that leaves a permanent crease must be accounted for, including the small, final folds for the head.\n*   **Incremental Counting:** The step-by-step method of starting with a base number of regions and adding the effect of new creases is a reliable way to avoid errors in counting a complex pattern from scratch.\n*   **Region Splitting:** The core of the logic relies on the principle that adding a simple line segment across a planar region divides it into two, and adding a V-shape divides it into three.\n\n### Final Calculation\n*   Bird Base: 12 Regions\n*   Add Neck/Tail Narrowing Folds: +4 Regions\n*   Add Wing Folds: +2 Regions\n*   Add Head Fold: +2 Regions\n*   **Total:** 12 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 20 Regions.\n\nThe fold lines of a standard origami crane divide the paper into 20 regions.\n\n<<<20>>>"
