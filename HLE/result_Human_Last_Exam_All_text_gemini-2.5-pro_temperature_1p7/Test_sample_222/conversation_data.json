    "This problem requires finding a 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) for an 8-point sequence that is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, x(n) and h(n). We are given the 4-point DFTs of x(n) and h(n), denoted as X(k) and H(k) respectively.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Input and the Goal**\n\n*   We are given the 4-point DFT of a sequence x(n):\n    `X(k) = {X(0), X(1), X(2), X(3)} = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   We are given the 4-point DFT of a sequence h(n):\n    `H(k) = {H(0), H(1), H(2), H(3)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n*   We need to find the 4-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence `y(n)` formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n    `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n**2. Interpret the Ambiguous Request: \"4-point DFT for an 8-point sequence\"**\n\nCalculating a 4-point DFT for an 8-point sequence is not a standard operation. In the context of DFT properties, this almost always implies a process of aliasing the longer sequence down to the shorter length before transforming.\n\n*   Let the 8-point sequence be `y(n) = {y(0), y(1), ..., y(7)}`.\n*   A 4-point sequence `z(n)` can be formed by time-aliasing `y(n)`. This is done by \"folding\" the second half of `y(n)` onto the first half and adding them:\n    `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   The goal is to find `Z(k) = DFT_4[z(n)]`.\n\n**3. Relate the Desired 4-point DFT to the 8-point DFT**\n\nThere is a fundamental DFT property (related to the Decimation-in-Frequency FFT algorithm) that connects `Z(k)` to the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, let's call it `Y(k)`.\nThe property states that `Z(k)` is equal to the even-indexed samples of `Y(k)`:\n`Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nSo, our strategy is:\na. Find the 8-point DFT, `Y(k)`, of the interleaved sequence `y(n)`.\nb. Extract the even-indexed samples `Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)` to form the final 4-point DFT result `Z(k)`.\n\n**4. Find the 8-point DFT Y(k) using DFT Properties**\n\nThe interleaved structure of `y(n)` is a classic case for the Decimation-in-Time (DIT) FFT algorithm. The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` can be expressed directly in terms of the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n\n*   The sequence `y(n)` can be described as:\n    `y(2m) = x(m)` (even-indexed terms)\n    `y(2m+1) = h(m)` (odd-indexed terms)\n*   The formula relating the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` to the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` is:\n    `Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n    where `W_N^k = exp(-j * 2π * k / N)` is the DFT twiddle factor.\n\n**5. Calculate the Required Samples of Y(k)**\n\nWe need `Y(0), Y(2), Y(4),` and `Y(6)`.\n\n*   **Calculate Twiddle Factors:**\n    *   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n    *   `W_8^2 = e^(-j*2π*2/8) = e^(-jπ/2) = -j`\n    *   `W_8^4 = e^(-j*2π*4/8) = e^(-jπ) = -1`\n    *   `W_8^6 = e^(-j*2π*6/8) = e^(-j3π/2) = j`\n\n*   **Calculate Y(0): (This will be Z(0))**\n    `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **Calculate Y(2): (This will be Z(1))**\n    `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j`\n\n*   **Calculate Y(4): (This will be Z(2))**\n    `Y(4) = X(4 mod 4) + W_8^4 * H(4 mod 4) = X(0) + W_8^4 * H(0)`\n    `Y(4) = 1 + (-1)(0) = 1`\n\n*   **Calculate Y(6): (This will be Z(3))**\n    `Y(6) = X(6 mod 4) + W_8^6 * H(6 mod 4) = X(2) + W_8^6 * H(2)`\n    `Y(6) = -1 + (j)(1) = -1 + j`\n\n**6. Assemble the Final Answer**\n\nThe desired 4-point DFT `Z(k)` is composed of the samples we just calculated:\n`Z(k) = {Z(0), Z(1), Z(2), Z(3)} = {Y(0), Y(2), Y(4), Y(6)}`\n`Z(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final result is the 4-point DFT sequence derived from the calculations above.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
