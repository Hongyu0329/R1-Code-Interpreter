The edges of the image will be smoothed, and their curvature will be reduced with each iteration. Edges forming the boundaries of convex shapes will move inward, causing the shapes to shrink and eventually disappear. Edges forming the boundaries of concave shapes (holes) will move outward, causing the holes to be filled in and disappear. As the number of iterations $t \rightarrow \infty$, any closed or curved edge will be eliminated. The final image will converge to a state with no edges, i.e., a solid black or solid white image.
