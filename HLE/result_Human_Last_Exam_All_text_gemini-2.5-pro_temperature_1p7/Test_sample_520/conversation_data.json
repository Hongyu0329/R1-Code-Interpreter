    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\n*   **Subject:** Andre Vernault\n*   **Time Period:** World War II\n*   **Location:** United Kingdom\n*   **Situation:** He was a Belgian refugee interrogated by UK counterintelligence (MI5).\n*   **Problem:** He was suspected of being a German spy.\n*   **Reason for Suspicion:** He concealed his true profession from interrogators.\n*   **Goal:** To identify his true profession.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the reasons for suspicion.**\nWhen Vernault arrived in the UK in 1941, he was questioned at the London Reception Centre (LRC). He claimed to be an electrical engineer. However, the interrogators grew suspicious for a key reason: his hands were soft and uncalloused, which was inconsistent with the hands of someone who did manual work as an engineer in that era. This discrepancy, combined with the general wartime paranoia about infiltration, led MI5 to believe his claimed profession was a cover story for espionage.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate the concealed truth.**\nMI5 placed Vernault under surveillance, believing he was a German spy codenamed \"GANDER\". They expended considerable resources tracking him. The truth was far more mundane. Vernault was indeed hiding his real job, not because he was a spy, but because he was embarrassed by it. He feared that his profession would be seen as effeminate or undignified by the military authorities interrogating him.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific profession.**\nHistorical records, notably detailed in books about WWII counterintelligence like Ben Macintyre's \"Double Cross,\" reveal Andre Vernault's true profession. He was not an engineer but a designer and maker of women's undergarments.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude with the final answer.**\nThe profession that Andre Vernault concealed, leading to the false belief that he was a spy, was that of a **corset-maker** (or corseti√®re). This explained his soft hands and his reluctance to be truthful with his interrogators.\n\n***\n\n<<<Corset-maker>>>"
