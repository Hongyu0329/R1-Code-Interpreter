s[1] = 1; for a composite number n, let p be its greatest prime factor (gpf) and k=n/p. The rule is s[n] = s[k] + s[p]. For a prime number, the value is defined as s[p]=s[p-1]+1 if p-1 is a perfect square, and s[p]=s[gpf(p-1)]+s[(p-1)/gpf(p-1)] otherwise. This is a sample of the complexity required to fit the numbers, indicating no simple rule exists. The most plausible intended answer involves number theoretic properties like prime factorization, likely with multiple conditions. R(s[n]): if n is a composite number with greatest prime factor p, s[n] = s[n/p] + s[p]. (This is a simplified hypothesis, though imperfect).
