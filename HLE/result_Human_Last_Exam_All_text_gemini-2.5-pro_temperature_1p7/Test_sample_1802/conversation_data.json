    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Qudit**: A qudit is a quantum state in a $d$-dimensional complex Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$. For $d=2$, it's a qubit.\n*   **Generalized Pauli Operators**: For a $d$-dimensional system, there are $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) denoted by $U_{j,k}$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$. These operators form a complete orthogonal basis for the space of all linear operators on $\\mathcal{H}_d$, denoted $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. The dimension of this operator space is $d^2$. A key property is that the product of two Pauli operators is another Pauli operator, up to a phase factor.\n*   **Pauli Channel**: A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel whose action on a density matrix $\\rho$ can be written as:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{j,k} U_{j,k} \\rho U_{j,k}^\\dagger $$\n    where $\\{p_{j,k}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{j,k} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{j,k} p_{j,k} = 1$. The Kraus operators for this channel are $\\{E_{j,k} = \\sqrt{p_{j,k}} U_{j,k}\\}$. For simplicity, we can use a single index $k$ that runs from 1 to $d^2$ to represent the pairs $(j,k)$, so the Kraus operators are $\\{E_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k\\}_{k=1}^{d^2}$.\n*   **Complementary Channel**: Any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ from a system $A$ to itself can be viewed as an interaction with an environment $E$, followed by tracing out the environment. The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is obtained by tracing out the system $A$ instead. It maps quantum states of the system to quantum states of the environment.\n*   **Rank of a Channel**: The rank of a quantum channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-Jamiolkowski (CJ) matrix. This is also known as the Choi rank. For a channel $\\mathcal{E}$ with Kraus operators $\\{E_k\\}$, the Choi rank is the minimum number of Kraus operators needed to represent the channel, which is equal to the dimension of the vector space spanned by the Kraus operators, i.e., $\\dim(\\text{span}\\{E_k\\})$.\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Rank of the Complementary Channel\n\nA crucial result from quantum information theory relates the rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ to the Kraus operators $\\{E_k\\}$ of the original channel $\\Lambda$. The formula is:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{E_k^\\dagger E_l \\mid k, l \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, d^2\\}\\}) $$\nThis means the rank of the complementary channel is the dimension of the vector space spanned by all possible products of the form $E_k^\\dagger E_l$. These products are operators acting on the original Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_d$.\n\n### Step 3: Applying the Formula to a Pauli Channel\n\nFor a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, the Kraus operators are $E_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$. Substituting this into the formula for the rank of the complementary channel, we get:\n$$ E_k^\\dagger E_l = (\\sqrt{p_k} U_k)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_l} U_l) = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\, U_k^\\dagger U_l $$\nThe rank of $\\Lambda^c$ is the dimension of the space spanned by these operators:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = \\dim(\\text{span}\\{\\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\, U_k^\\dagger U_l \\mid k, l \\in \\{1, \\dots, d^2\\}\\}) $$\nTo find the maximal rank, we need to maximize this dimension by choosing an appropriate probability distribution $\\{p_k\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Maximizing the Rank\n\n1.  **Upper Bound on the Rank**: The operators $U_k^\\dagger U_l$ are all $d \\times d$ matrices, which are elements of the operator space $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. The dimension of this space is $d^2$. The dimension of any subspace spanned by elements of $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$ cannot exceed $d^2$. Therefore, the maximal possible rank is at most $d^2$.\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) \\le \\dim(\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)) = d^2 $$\n\n2.  **Achieving the Upper Bound**: To achieve the maximum rank of $d^2$, we need to find a Pauli channel for which the set of operators $\\{U_k^\\dagger U_l\\}$ spans the entire space $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. This requires that for any basis element of $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$, there is a linear combination of the operators $\\{U_k^\\dagger U_l\\}$ that equals it.\n    The set of generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_m\\}_{m=1}^{d^2}$ itself forms a basis for $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. Let's see if we can generate all of them.\n\n3.  **The Role of Pauli Operator Algebra**: The product of two generalized Pauli operators $U_k^\\dagger$ and $U_l$ is, up to a phase factor, another generalized Pauli operator. Specifically, $U_k^\\dagger U_l = c \\cdot U_m$ for some phase $c$ and some index $m$.\n    By varying $k$ and $l$ over all $d^2$ possibilities, the resulting index $m$ also ranges over all $d^2$ possibilities. For example, if we fix $k$ to be the index corresponding to the identity operator $U_0 = I$, then $U_0^\\dagger U_l = I U_l = U_l$. So, if the probability $p_0$ associated with the identity operator is non-zero, and all other probabilities $p_l$ are also non-zero, then the set of operators $\\{E_0^\\dagger E_l = \\sqrt{p_0 p_l} U_l\\}_{l=1}^{d^2}$ is present in the span. This set consists of all Pauli operators, each scaled by a non-zero constant.\n\n4.  **Example Channel - The Completely Depolarizing Channel**: Consider the completely depolarizing channel, where the system is replaced by the maximally mixed state. For this channel, the probabilities are uniform: $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k=1, \\dots, d^2$.\n    In this case, all probabilities are non-zero. The operators spanning the space for the complementary channel's rank are:\n    $$ \\{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{d^2}\\frac{1}{d^2}} \\, U_k^\\dagger U_l \\}_{k,l=1}^{d^2} = \\{ \\frac{1}{d^2} U_k^\\dagger U_l \\}_{k,l=1}^{d^2} $$\n    As argued above, by taking $k=0$ (the index for the identity operator) and letting $l$ range over all possible values, we generate the set $\\{\\frac{1}{d^2} U_l\\}_{l=1}^{d^2}$. This is a set of $d^2$ operators, which are just the scaled basis elements of $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$. Since they are scalar multiples of a basis, they are linearly independent and span the entire $d^2$-dimensional space $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H}_d)$.\n    Therefore, for the completely depolarizing channel, the rank of the complementary channel is exactly $d^2$.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel is bounded above by $d^2$. We have shown that this maximum value can be achieved for a specific, valid Pauli channel (the completely depolarizing channel). Thus, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
