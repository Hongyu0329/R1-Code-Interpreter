    "This problem asks us to identify all nonabelian \"filled\" groups of a specific order, `2q^m`. Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core definitions.**\n\n1.  **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for all elements `x, y` in `S` (including the case where `x = y`), their product `xy` is *not* in `S`.\n    *   Example: In the cyclic group `C_4 = {e, a, a^2, a^3}`, the set `{a, a^3}` is product-free because `a*a = a^2 \\notin S`, `a*a^3 = e \\notin S`, `a^3*a = e \\notin S`, and `a^3*a^3 = a^2 \\notin S`.\n\n2.  **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g` in `G \\setminus S`, the new set `S \\cup {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n3.  **A Set `S` Fills `G`:** A subset `S` of `G` is said to fill `G` if the subgroup generated by `S`, denoted `<S>`, is the entire group `G`. That is, `<S> = G`.\n\n4.  **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called a \"filled group\" if *every* maximal by inclusion product-free set `S` in `G` fills `G`.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the \"filled\" property to a known group-theoretic property.**\n\nThis problem involves a rather specialized definition. Such problems in group theory often hinge on a powerful classification theorem. For filled groups, the crucial result is:\n\n**Theorem 1:** A finite **solvable** group `G` is a filled group if and only if `G` has a **unique maximal subgroup**.\n\nThis theorem is the key to solving the problem. It transforms the question from one about product-free sets to one about the subgroup structure of `G`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the structure of the group `G` in question.**\n\nThe problem specifies that `G` is a group of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number (`m \\geq 1`).\n\nWe need to check if these groups are solvable to apply Theorem 1.\n\n**Theorem 2 (Burnside's `p^a q^b` Theorem):** Any group of order `p^a q^b`, where `p` and `q` are primes and `a, b` are non-negative integers, is solvable.\n\nIn our case, the order is `2^1 * q^m`. Since 2 and `q` are primes, any group `G` of this order is solvable by Burnside's theorem.\n\n**Conclusion of this step:** Since `G` is solvable, the condition that `G` is a \"filled group\" is equivalent to `G` having a unique maximal subgroup.\n\n**Step 4: Characterize groups with a unique maximal subgroup.**\n\nNow the problem is simplified to: *What are the nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` that have a unique maximal subgroup?*\n\nThere is another standard result in group theory that characterizes groups with this property.\n\n**Theorem 3:** A finite group `G` has a unique maximal subgroup if and only if `G` is a **cyclic p-group** (i.e., `G` is cyclic and its order is `p^k` for some prime `p` and integer `k \\geq 1`).\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the results to find a contradiction.**\n\nLet's assume such a nonabelian filled group `G` of order `2q^m` exists.\n1.  From the problem statement, `G` is a filled group.\n2.  From Step 3, we know `G` must be solvable.\n3.  Because `G` is a filled solvable group, by Theorem 1, `G` must have a unique maximal subgroup.\n4.  Because `G` has a unique maximal subgroup, by Theorem 3, `G` must be a cyclic p-group.\n5.  If `G` is a cyclic p-group, its order `|G|` must be a power of a single prime, i.e., `|G| = p^k`.\n\nNow we check if this is consistent with the given order `|G| = 2q^m`.\nThe order `2q^m` has two distinct prime factors: 2 and `q` (since `q` is an odd prime). Therefore, the order `2q^m` is not a power of a single prime.\n\nThis is a direct contradiction. Our assumption that such a group `G` exists must be false. The conditions required for `G` to be a filled group (`G` must be a cyclic p-group) are incompatible with the order of `G` (`2q^m`).\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion.**\n\nThe logical chain leads to a contradiction, implying that no group can satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously. It doesn't matter if the group is abelian or nonabelian; no group of order `2q^m` can be a filled group. Therefore, there are certainly no nonabelian ones.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correctly interpreting the definition of \"filled\":** The property must hold for *every* maximal product-free set, not just some of them.\n2.  **Identifying the relevant theorem:** The connection between \"filled\" and \"unique maximal subgroup\" for solvable groups is the critical shortcut. Without it, the problem is extremely difficult.\n3.  **Justifying the use of the theorem:** It's essential to confirm that groups of order `2q^m` are solvable, which is guaranteed by Burnside's Theorem.\n4.  **Knowing the characterization of groups with a unique maximal subgroup:** The fact that these are precisely the cyclic p-groups is the second crucial piece of theory.\n5.  **Recognizing the contradiction:** The heart of the proof is realizing that the group order `2q^m` is not a prime power, which contradicts the conclusion derived from the \"filled\" property.\n6.  **Addressing the \"nonabelian\" condition:** The proof shows that *no* group of this order can be filled. This is a stronger result which implies that no nonabelian group of this order can be filled. The \"nonabelian\" constraint doesn't change the final answer, which is that no such groups exist.\n\n### Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  A group `G` of order `2q^m` (for odd prime `q`) is solvable by Burnside's `p^a q^b` theorem.\n2.  A key theorem states that a finite solvable group is \"filled\" if and only if it has a unique maximal subgroup.\n3.  Since the groups in question are solvable, we are looking for nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` with a unique maximal subgroup.\n4.  Another key theorem states that a finite group has a unique maximal subgroup if and only if it is a cyclic group of prime-power order (a cyclic p-group).\n5.  A group of order `2q^m` has at least two distinct prime factors (2 and `q`). Therefore, its order is not a prime power.\n6.  This leads to a contradiction: a group `G` satisfying the conditions would have to be a cyclic p-group (and thus have prime-power order), but its given order is not a prime power.\n7.  Therefore, no such group `G` can exist.\n\nThere are no nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`.\n\n<<<There are no such groups.>>>"
