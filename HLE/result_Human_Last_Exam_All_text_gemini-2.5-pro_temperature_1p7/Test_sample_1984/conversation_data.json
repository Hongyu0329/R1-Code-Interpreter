    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are given a first-order autonomous differential equation:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nWe need to find the number of stable equilibrium points, which is denoted by $m$. After finding $m$, we need to calculate the value of the expression $m - 2^{4048}$.\n\n**2. Find the Equilibrium Points**\nEquilibrium points (or fixed points) are the constant solutions to the differential equation. They occur where the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$.\nLet's denote the right-hand side of the equation as $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. The equilibrium points are the roots of the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term in the parenthesis is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe roots of this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. These are the two equilibrium points of the system.\n\n**3. Determine the Stability of Each Equilibrium Point**\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we can analyze the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, which is $f'(x)$, at that point.\n- If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable.\n- If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium point $x^*$ is unstable.\n- If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we need to use another method, like analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ around the equilibrium point (phase line analysis).\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, let's test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:**\n    Evaluate $f'(0)$:\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:**\n    Evaluate $f'(1)$:\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the derivative test is inconclusive. We must perform a phase line analysis by checking the sign of $f(x)$ in the vicinity of $x=1$.\n\n    The function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$. Note that $(x-1)^2$ is always positive for $x \\neq 1$.\n    -   **To the left of $x=1$ (e.g., $x=0.9$):**\n        $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.009$.\n        Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, which means $x(t)$ is decreasing. The solution moves to the left, away from $x=1$.\n    -   **To the right of $x=1$ (e.g., $x=1.1$):**\n        $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -0.011$.\n        Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, which means $x(t)$ is decreasing. The solution moves to the left, towards $x=1$.\n\n    The phase portrait near $x=1$ looks like this: `...<---(moves away)--- 1 <---(moves towards)---...`\n    Since solutions starting from the left of $x=1$ move away from it, the point is not stable. Such a point is called **semi-stable**. A stable equilibrium requires that solutions from both sides converge to the point.\n\n**4. Count the Number of Stable Equilibria**\nBased on the stability analysis:\n-   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n-   $x=1$ is a semi-stable equilibrium point, not a stable one.\n\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\nWe need to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   An equilibrium point exists where $x'(t) = f(x) = 0$.\n*   The stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ is determined by the behavior of solutions that start near $x^*$.\n*   The first derivative test ($f'(x^*)$) is a shortcut for linearization. It provides conclusive results if $f'(x^*) \\neq 0$.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, a phase line analysis (checking the sign of $f(x)$ on either side of $x^*$) is required to determine stability.\n*   A stable equilibrium must be an attractor for trajectories on both sides. If it attracts from one side and repels from the other, it is called semi-stable and is not considered stable.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nStep 1: The differential equation is $x' = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$.\nStep 2: The equilibrium points are the roots of $-x(x-1)^2 = 0$, which are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\nStep 3: Test stability.\n   - For $x=0$, $f'(x) = -3x^2+4x-1 \\implies f'(0)=-1 < 0$, so $x=0$ is stable.\n   - For $x=1$, $f'(1)=0$, so the test is inconclusive. Phase line analysis shows $x=1$ is semi-stable.\nStep 4: The number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\nStep 5: Compute the final value: $m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
