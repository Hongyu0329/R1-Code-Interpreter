    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the group of people, represented as \"X-Ys\", whom Pavel Milyukov denounced as a \"stagnant swamp\" as part of his broader critique of Western culture in his era.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Pavel Milyukov and his Core Beliefs**\n*   Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943) was a prominent Russian historian, liberal politician, and a leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets).\n*   He was a staunch \"Westernizer,\" meaning he advocated for Russia to adopt Western models of liberal democracy, constitutionalism, and rationalism.\n*   This creates an important point of nuance: if he was a Westernizer, his critique would not be against all of Western culture, but against a specific trend within it that he found dangerous or counterproductive to the ideals he championed.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Metaphor \"Stagnant Swamp\"**\n*   A \"stagnant swamp\" is a powerful image. It evokes ideas of decay, murkiness, lack of progress, irrationality, and perhaps disease or poison.\n*   This suggests Milyukov was not critiquing something for being economically inefficient or politically wrong, but for being culturally and morally degenerate and devoid of purpose.\n\n**Step 4: Contextualize Milyukov's Cultural Critiques**\n*   Milyukov's prime was in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a period of immense cultural upheaval in Europe and Russia.\n*   The dominant new artistic and literary movements were part of Modernism, which included Symbolism, Futurism, and Cubism. These movements deliberately broke from 19th-century traditions of realism and positivism, which Milyukov revered.\n*   These new movements often explored themes of subjectivity, mysticism, pessimism, aestheticism (\"art for art's sake\"), and irrationality.\n\n**Step 5: Connect Milyukov's Beliefs to His Critique**\n*   As a rationalist and a liberal who believed art and culture should serve a positive social and civic purpose, Milyukov was horrified by these new trends.\n*   He saw them as a retreat from civic responsibility and a descent into self-indulgent nonsense. To him, this was the \"stagnant swamp\" – a culture that had lost its forward-moving, rational, and progressive direction.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the Specific Term for \"X-Ys\"**\n*   The term widely used at the time, by both proponents and critics, for the artistic and literary trend focused on aestheticism, artificiality, and themes of decay was the **Decadent movement**, or simply **Decadence**.\n*   Historical sources confirm that Milyukov used the exact phrase \"swamp of decadence\" (болото декадентства) to attack these movements, particularly the Russian Symbolists who were heavily influenced by Western European Decadents.\n*   Therefore, the people he was denouncing—the practitioners of this culture—were the **Decadents**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nPavel Milyukov, a champion of 19th-century liberal rationalism, saw the emerging modernist cultural trends of his time as a form of societal decay. He labeled this cultural environment a \"stagnant swamp\" of \"Decadence,\" and consequently denounced its followers and practitioners, the \"Decadents.\"\n\n<<<Decadents>>>"
