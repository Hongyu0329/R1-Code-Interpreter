    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### **Step 1: Relate the Neron-Severi group of X to that of C**\n\nLet $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$, and let $X = C^{(d)} = \\text{Sym}^d(C)$ be its $d$-th symmetric power. The object of study is the rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X$, denoted $\\rho(X)$, which is also known as the Picard number of $X$.\n\nFor a curve $C$ of genus $g$, there is a fundamental relationship between the Picard number of its symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ and the Picard number of its Jacobian variety $J(C)$. For any $d \\geq 1$, the Picard number of $C^{(d)}$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1 $$\nHere, $J(C)$ is the Jacobian of $C$, which is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension $g$.\n\n**Careful point:** This formula is a standard result in the theory of algebraic curves. It arises from the fact that the Picard group of $C^{(d)}$ is generated by the pullback of the Picard group of the Jacobian via the Abel-Jacobi map, plus one extra generator class which is not algebraically dependent on the others.\n\nIn our specific problem, $C$ is a genus 3 curve, so $g=3$. And $X$ is the 15th symmetric power, so $d=15$. Applying the formula, we have:\n$$ \\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1 $$\nThis reduces the problem to finding the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$ as $C$ varies over all genus 3 Riemann surfaces.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the possible range for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of J(C)**\n\nThe Jacobian $J(C)$ of a genus 3 curve is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. For any abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$, its Picard number $\\rho(A)$ is bounded. The lower bound comes from the existence of a polarization, and the upper bound is given by the dimension of the Hodge group $H^{1,1}(A)$.\n$$ 1 \\leq \\rho(A) \\leq h^{1,1}(A) $$\nFor an abelian variety of dimension $g$, the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(A)$ is given by $g^2$. In our case, $g=3$, so for the Jacobian $J(C)$, we have:\n$$ 1 \\leq \\rho(J(C)) \\leq 3^2 = 9 $$\nNow we need to determine if these bounds are actually achieved by the Jacobians of some genus 3 curves.\n\n### **Step 3: Find the smallest possible rank**\n\nThe smallest possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 1. We need to confirm that there exists a genus 3 curve $C$ for which $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$.\n\nThis occurs for a **generic** curve. A generic curve is one whose Jacobian $J(C)$ has the smallest possible endomorphism ring, which is just the integers, $End(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. For such an abelian variety, the Neron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$, generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). Therefore, its rank is 1.\n\nSince the set of curves with this property is dense in the moduli space of genus 3 curves, such curves exist.\nSo, the minimum possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 1.\n\nUsing this, we find the smallest possible rank for $X$:\n$$ \\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 $$\n\n**Careful point:** It is important to know that the lower bound of the theoretical range is actually achieved for a generic curve, ensuring that $\\rho(J(C))=1$ is a possible value.\n\n### **Step 4: Find the largest possible rank**\n\nThe largest possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 9. We need to confirm that there exists a genus 3 curve $C$ for which $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n\nA Jacobian $J(C)$ achieving the maximum Picard number $\\rho(J(C))=g^2$ is called a **singular abelian variety** (in the sense of Shioda) or an abelian variety of **CM-type**. This requires the Jacobian to have a very large ring of endomorphisms.\n\nA classical example of a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian has this property is the **Fermat curve of degree 4**, given by the equation:\n$$ C: x^4 + y^4 = z^4 $$\nThe genus of this curve is $g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3$. The Jacobian $J(C)$ of this curve is known to be isogenous to the product of three copies of a specific elliptic curve $E$, namely $E: y^2=x^3-x$. This elliptic curve $E$ has complex multiplication (CM) by the ring of Gaussian integers, $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n\nSo, $J(C)$ is isogenous to $E \\times E \\times E$. An isogeny preserves the rank of the Neron-Severi group. We need to calculate $\\rho(E \\times E \\times E)$. For a product of CM elliptic curves $E^g$, the Picard number is maximal: $\\rho(E^g) = g^2$. In our case, $g=3$, so $\\rho(J(C)) = 3^2 = 9$.\n\n**Careful point:** It is not sufficient to know that abelian varieties with $\\rho=9$ exist; we must know that one such variety is the Jacobian of an actual genus 3 curve. The Fermat curve provides this concrete example.\n\nSo, the maximum possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$ is 9.\n\nUsing this, we find the largest possible rank for $X$:\n$$ \\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 $$\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\n*   The smallest possible rank occurs for a generic curve $C$, where $\\rho(J(C))=1$. This gives $\\rho(X) = 2$.\n*   The largest possible rank occurs for a special curve like the Fermat curve of degree 4, where $\\rho(J(C))=9$. This gives $\\rho(X) = 10$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
