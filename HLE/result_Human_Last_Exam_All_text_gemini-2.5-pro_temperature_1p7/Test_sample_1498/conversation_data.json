    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the exact range of verses (abyāt) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi that list the names of the prophets.\n\n2.  **Locate the relevant section:** The poem is a summary of Islamic creed ('aqeedah). The part concerning belief in the Messengers of God (Rusul) is where this list would be found. This section typically follows the discussion on the attributes of Allah and the belief in Angels.\n\n3.  **Find the introductory verse:** Before listing the names, the author provides a preamble. Bayt (verse) number 31 serves this purpose:\n    *   تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ * كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *   *Translation: The details of twenty-five [prophets] are necessary for every responsible person, so ascertain [this] and seize [the opportunity].*\n    This verse states that the list of 25 prophets is about to be mentioned, but it does not contain the names themselves.\n\n4.  **Identify the starting verse of the list:** The actual enumeration of the prophets' names begins in the very next verse, Bayt 32:\n    *   هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ * صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *   *Translation: They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with Salih, and Ibrahim, each is followed.*\n    This is the first verse containing the names.\n\n5.  **Follow the sequence of verses:** The names continue to be listed in the subsequent verses:\n    *   **Bayt 33:** لُوطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا * يَعْقُوبُ يُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى (Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, likewise Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub...)\n    *   **Bayt 34:** شُعَيْبُ هَارُونُ وَمُوسَى وَالْيَسَعْ * ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ (Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, and al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman...)\n\n6.  **Identify the ending verse of the list:** The list of 25 prophets concludes in Bayt 35:\n    *   إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى * عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *   *Translation: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), the seal, leave misguidance.*\n    This verse mentions the last of the prophets in the list, making it the final verse of the enumeration.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important not to include Bayt 31 in the final range, as it only introduces the list without naming any prophets.\n*   The question asks \"from which bayt to which,\" implying a continuous range where the names are mentioned.\n*   Note that the final prophet, Muhammad (ﷺ), is referred to by one of his names, 'Taha' (طهَ), in the poem.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the verses that explicitly mention the names of the prophets start at Bayt 32 and end at Bayt 35.\n\n<<<From Bayt 32 to Bayt 35.>>>"
