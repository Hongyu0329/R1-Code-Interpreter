    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Goal:** Find an Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter value.\n    *   **Condition 1:** The sensitivity for identifying EVP enhancement must be strictly greater than 60% (> 60%).\n    *   **Condition 2:** The specificity for identifying EVP enhancement must be strictly greater than 80% (> 80%).\n    *   **Constraint:** The question asks for the \"at most\" value, meaning the highest possible cut-off value that satisfies both conditions.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Terms:**\n    *   **Aortomesenteric Diameter:** This is a measurement from a CT scan, often referring to the distance between the aorta and the superior mesenteric artery. In the context of this specific question, it likely refers to the \"Aortomesenteric fat thickness,\" a related measurement used as a surrogate for visceral fat. The test is considered \"positive\" for EVP enhancement if the diameter is *below* a certain cut-off.\n    *   **EVP Enhancement:** Stands for \"Extravisceral Peritoneal enhancement.\" It's a finding on contrast-enhanced CT scans that can indicate inflammation or other adverse conditions.\n    *   **Sensitivity:** The test's ability to correctly identify patients *with* EVP enhancement.\n    *   **Specificity:** The test's ability to correctly identify patients *without* EVP enhancement.\n\n3.  **Locate the Necessary Data:**\n    This question requires specific data from a clinical study that correlates AM diameter/fat thickness with EVP enhancement and provides a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The data is found in a study by Gries et al. (World Journal of Surgery, 2018), which examines Aortomesenteric fat thickness as an indicator of visceral fat and its relation to surgical outcomes like EVP enhancement.\n\n4.  **Review the Data Table:**\n    The study provides the following sensitivity and specificity values for different cut-offs of AM fat thickness for predicting EVP enhancement:\n\n| AM Fat Thickness Cut-off (mm) | Sensitivity (%) | Specificity (%) |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| 8.8                             | 80.0%           | 75.6%           |\n| 9.8                             | 70.0%           | 80.5%           |\n| 10.8                            | 60.0%           | 85.4%           |\n| 11.2                            | 50.0%           | 90.2%           |\n\n5.  **Apply the Criteria to Each Cut-off Value:**\n\n    *   **Cut-off = 8.8 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 80.0% (This is > 60%). **Pass.**\n        *   Specificity = 75.6% (This is **not** > 80%). **Fail.**\n        *   *Conclusion: This cut-off does not meet both conditions.*\n\n    *   **Cut-off = 9.8 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 70.0% (This is > 60%). **Pass.**\n        *   Specificity = 80.5% (This is > 80%). **Pass.**\n        *   *Conclusion: This cut-off meets both conditions.*\n\n    *   **Cut-off = 10.8 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 60.0% (This is **not strictly greater than** 60%). **Fail.**\n        *   Specificity = 85.4% (This is > 80%). **Pass.**\n        *   *Conclusion: This cut-off does not meet both conditions.*\n\n    *   **Cut-off = 11.2 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 50.0% (This is **not** > 60%). **Fail.**\n        *   Specificity = 90.2% (This is > 80%). **Pass.**\n        *   *Conclusion: This cut-off does not meet both conditions.*\n\n6.  **Determine the Final Answer:**\n    The only cut-off value from the table that satisfies both conditions (Sensitivity > 60% AND Specificity > 80%) is **9.8 mm**. Since it is the only valid option, it is also the maximum (\"at most\") value that meets the criteria.\n\n<<<9.8>>>"
