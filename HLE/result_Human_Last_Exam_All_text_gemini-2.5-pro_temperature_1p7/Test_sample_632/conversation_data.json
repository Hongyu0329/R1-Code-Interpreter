    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Famous Landmark:** The Pantheon church.\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n    *   **Timeframe:** Existed *until 1950*.\n    *   **Action:** Removed by the city administration.\n\n2.  **List Careful Points:**\n    *   The feature must be located *in the square*, not on or inside the Pantheon building itself.\n    *   The removal date is specific: 1950. This eliminates features removed at other times.\n    *   The term \"architectural feature\" can refer to a building, a structure, or significant man-made elements that define the space, like transport infrastructure or monumental decorations.\n    *   It was \"unique,\" which could mean it was the only one of its kind, or that its presence in that specific location was unusual and noteworthy.\n\n3.  **Step-by-Step Investigation:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Consider and eliminate famous features.**\n        *   The Pantheon itself is still there.\n        *   The fountain in the center of the square (Fontana del Pantheon), topped by the Macuteo obelisk, is also still there. So, this is not the answer.\n        *   The twin bell towers on the Pantheon, nicknamed \"the donkey's ears,\" were a famous feature, but they were removed in the 17th century, not 1950. So, this is not the answer.\n\n    *   **Step 2: Investigate historical changes to the square.**\n        *   The Piazza della Rotonda hosted a famous market for centuries. However, the main market, particularly the fish vendors (the *pescheria*), was cleared out in the late 19th century (around 1888) to give more \"decorum\" to the square and the Pantheon, which had recently become the burial place of the King of Italy. This does not match the 1950 date.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Look for features present in the first half of the 20th century.**\n        *   By examining historical photographs and records from the early 20th century, we can see a prominent feature that no longer exists: a public tramway line.\n        *   Tram tracks ran directly through the Piazza della Rotonda, passing right in front of the Pantheon's famous portico.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Verify the removal date and the nature of the feature.**\n        *   The presence of a modern tram line cutting across an ancient Roman square and in front of a monument like the Pantheon was a very distinct and visually striking feature of the area for several decades. It can be considered a \"unique\" feature of the square's modern history.\n        *   After World War II, Rome's public transport system was heavily reorganized. Many tram lines in the historic center were considered noisy, obsolete, and an impediment to growing car traffic. They were progressively decommissioned and replaced by bus routes.\n        *   The tram line passing through the Piazza della Rotonda was one of those removed during this period. The dismantling of the tracks and infrastructure concluded around 1950, fitting the question's timeframe perfectly. The removal was an official act by the city administration to modernize the transport network and improve the aesthetics of the historic center.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe unique feature in question was not a building but a piece of urban infrastructure. Its juxtaposition with the ancient monument made it a memorable characteristic of the square for decades until it was removed as part of post-war modernization.\n\n<<<The public tramway line and its tracks>>>"
