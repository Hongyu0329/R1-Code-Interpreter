    "The outer hull of the great icosahedron is its convex hull. Research indicates that the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. Since the faces of the convex hull are already triangles, no further triangulation is needed. The number of visible triangles from the outside is simply the number of faces of the regular icosahedron.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
