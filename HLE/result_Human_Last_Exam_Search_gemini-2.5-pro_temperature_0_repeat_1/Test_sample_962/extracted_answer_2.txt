A tightly secure two-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme can be designed by following these key principles:

1.  **Foundation on a Secure Signature Scheme:** Base the design on a signature scheme with a compatible algebraic structure, such as Schnorr signatures for classical security or a lattice-based scheme for post-quantum security.

2.  **Distributed Key Generation (DKG):** Employ a robust DKG protocol where *n* participants collaboratively create a shared public key and individual secret
