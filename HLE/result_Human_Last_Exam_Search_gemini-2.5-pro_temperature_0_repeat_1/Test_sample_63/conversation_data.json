    "In his novel *Breakfast of Champions*, Kurt Vonnegut describes a depiction of Saint Sebastian, a Christian martyr, as looking like a porcupine because he was shot with numerous arrows. An appropriate two-word name for this figure, with both words starting with the same letter, is \"soldier-saint.\"\n\nSaint Sebastian was a soldier in the Roman army and is also venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church. He was secretly a Christian and was sentenced to death by archers after his faith was discovered by Emperor Diocletian. Though he miraculously survived the initial execution attempt, he was later martyred. The image of him pierced with arrows is a common artistic representation.\n\n<<<soldier-saint>>>"
