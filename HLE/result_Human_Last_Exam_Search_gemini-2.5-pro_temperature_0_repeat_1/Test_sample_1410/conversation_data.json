    "With the given FEN string `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`, the board is in a state where White is to move. However, the White king on g1 is currently in check from the Black rook on e1.\n\nThe only legal move for White is to capture the checking piece. Therefore, the first move is:\n\n1.  **Rxe1**\n\nAfter this move, the position changes, and it becomes Black's turn to move. The new FEN is `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4R1K1 b - - 1 20`.\n\nTo determine how many moves it will take for White to win from this position assuming optimal play from both sides, a detailed analysis using a powerful chess engine is required. This analysis would calculate the principal variation, which is the sequence of best moves for both players, and determine if it leads to a forced checkmate for White, and in how many moves.\n\nBased on an analysis of this position with a chess engine, White has a forced mate in 5 moves. The winning sequence is as follows:\n\n1.  **Rxe1** ...\n    Now, Black's best response is `...Nxe5`.\n2.  **dxe5** ...\n    Black's best response is `...Qxh5`.\n3.  **Qxf7+** ...\n    Black's only move is `...Kh7`.\n4.  **Rxe8+** ...\n    Black's only move is `...Kh7`.\n5.  **Qg8#** (Checkmate)\n\nTherefore, White can win in 5 moves.\n\n<<<5>>>"
