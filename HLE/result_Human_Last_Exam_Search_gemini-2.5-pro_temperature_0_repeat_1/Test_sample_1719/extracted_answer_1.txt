The homotopy-theoretic obstructions for $\phi_t$ and $\psi_t$ to be homotopic through paths of bundle automorphisms fixing the endpoints are classified by the fundamental group $\pi_1(\text{Aut}(E))$. This group is determined by the following groups:

1.  The fundamental group of the special orthogonal group:
    \[\pi_1(SO(2k))\]
2.  The $(n-1)$-th cohomology group of $X$ with coefficients in the $(n+1)$-th homotopy group of $SO(2k)$, which by the Universal Coefficient Theorem is principally determined by the following two groups:
    \[H_{n-1}(X) \quad \text{and} \quad \pi_{n+1}(SO(2k))\]
    More precisely, the obstruction group is $\text{Hom}(H_{n-1}(X), \pi_{n+1}(SO(2k)))$.
