    "There are exactly four finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA set S within a finite group G is defined as \"product-free\" if the product of any two elements in S (including an element with itself) does not result in an element that is also in S. Formally, for all a, b ∈ S, ab ∉ S. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (also known as a locally maximal product-free set) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set within the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 was accomplished by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. Their work shows that only a specific and finite number of groups satisfy this property.\n\nThe four finite groups are:\n*   **C₄**: The cyclic group of order 4.\n*   **C₂ × C₂**: The Klein four-group.\n*   **C₆**: The cyclic group of order 6.\n*   **S₃**: The symmetric group on three elements (also known as the dihedral group of order 6).\n\nThese are the only finite groups for which a maximal product-free set of precisely two elements can be found.\n\n<<<4>>>"
