    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat, a symbol of his fearful and shifting mentality, appear six times.\n\nThe mentions of the coat serve as a recurring motif that underscores his vacillating and opportunistic nature. The act of putting on or taking off his cloak mirrors his changing stance in the conflict, which is entirely dependent on the perceived social standing of the dog's owner.\n\nThe instances are:\n*   The story begins with Otchumyelov \"wearing his new cloak.\"\n*   When it is first suggested the dog might belong to the General, Otchumyelov exclaims, \"Yeldyrin, take off my cloak. It's terribly hot!\"\n*   Upon being told the dog is not the General's, he says, \"Yeldyrin, help me put on my coat. It is cold.\"\n*   When the possibility of the dog being the General's is raised again, he repeats, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin . . . it's frightfully hot!\"\n*   After further confusion, he once again feels a chill and says, \"H'm, help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad . . . the wind's getting up. . . . I am cold. . . .\"\n*   Finally, as he departs, \"wrapping himself in his cloak, continued on his way across the market-place.\"\n\nThese repeated actions highlight his servility and how his sense of authority and even his physical sensations are subject to his fear of offending a person of high status.\n\n<<<6>>>"
