    "The rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is 0.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Identify the geometric object:** A smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in complex projective 3-space ($\\mathbb{CP}^3$) is a complex surface, meaning it has a complex dimension of 2 and a real dimension of 4.\n\n2.  **Determine the type of surface:** By the adjunction formula, the canonical bundle of $X$ is given by $K_X \\cong \\mathcal{O}_X(d - n - 1)$, where $d=5$ is the degree of the hypersurface and $n=3$ is the dimension of the ambient space. This gives $K_X \\cong \\mathcal{O}_X(5 - 3 - 1) = \\mathcal{O}_X(1)$. Since the anti-canonical bundle $-K_X$ is ample, $X$ is a Fano surface. Specifically, it is a del Pezzo surface of degree 5.\n\n3.  **Topological structure:** A standard result in algebraic geometry states that a del Pezzo surface of degree 5 is isomorphic to the blow-up of the complex projective plane $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ at four points in general position.\n\n4.  **Homotopy type:** Topologically, blowing up a point on a complex surface is equivalent to taking the connected sum with a copy of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ with its orientation reversed, denoted $\\overline{\\mathbb{CP}^2}$. Therefore, $X$ is diffeomorphic to the connected sum $\\mathbb{CP}^2 \\# 4\\overline{\\mathbb{CP}^2}$.\n\n5.  **Homotopy groups of a connected sum:** For simply-connected 4-manifolds, the third homotopy group of their connected sum is the direct sum of their individual third homotopy groups. Since $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^2) = 0$, our manifold $X$ is simply-connected. Thus, we have the relation:\n    $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2) \\oplus \\pi_3(\\overline{\\mathbb{CP}^2}) \\oplus \\pi_3(\\overline{\\mathbb{CP}^2}) \\oplus \\pi_3(\\overline{\\mathbb{CP}^2}) \\oplus \\pi_3(\\overline{\\mathbb{CP}^2})$.\n    As homotopy groups are independent of orientation, $\\pi_3(\\overline{\\mathbb{CP}^2}) \\cong \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2)$, which simplifies the expression to $\\pi_3(X) \\cong 5 \\cdot \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2)$.\n\n6.  **Calculation of $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2)$:** To find the third homotopy group of $\\mathbb{CP}^2$, we can use the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated with the Hopf fibration $S^1 \\hookrightarrow S^5 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^2$. The relevant part of the sequence is:\n    $$ \\dots \\rightarrow \\pi_3(S^1) \\rightarrow \\pi_3(S^5) \\rightarrow \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2) \\rightarrow \\pi_2(S^1) \\rightarrow \\dots $$\n    For the circle $S^1$, we know that $\\pi_k(S^1) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 2$. Therefore, $\\pi_3(S^1) = 0$ and $\\pi_2(S^1) = 0$. The exact sequence thus implies that the map between $\\pi_3(S^5)$ and $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2)$ is an isomorphism: $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2) \\cong \\pi_3(S^5)$.\n\n7.  **Homotopy groups of spheres:** A fundamental result in homotopy theory is that for a sphere $S^n$, the homotopy group $\\pi_k(S^n)$ is trivial (equal to 0) for all $k < n$. In our case, we need $\\pi_3(S^5)$. Since $3 < 5$, we have $\\pi_3(S^5) = 0$.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** From the steps above, we have $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^2) = 0$. Consequently, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong 5 \\cdot 0 = 0$. The rank of the trivial group is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
