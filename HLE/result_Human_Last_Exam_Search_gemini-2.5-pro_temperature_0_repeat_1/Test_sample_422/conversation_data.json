    "<<<In the context of the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge, where our only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, two significant problems arise, independent of Gettier cases.\n\nThe JTB theory posits that knowledge is any belief that is simultaneously true and for which the believer has adequate justification. However, this framework runs into fundamental difficulties concerning the nature of justification itself.\n\nThe two problems are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Infinite Regress:** This issue, also known as Agrippa's Trilemma, directly challenges the \"justification\" condition of the JTB account. For any belief to be justified, the justification provided must also be a belief that is itself justified. This creates a chain of justifications. The problem lies in how this chain can be acceptably terminated. There are only three possibilities, none of which are satisfactory for establishing knowledge under the JTB model:\n    *   **Infinite Regress:** The chain of justifications goes on forever, meaning no belief can ever be fully justified.\n    *   **Circular Reasoning:** The chain of justifications eventually circles back to support itself (e.g., Belief A is justified by B, and B is justified by A), which is a logical fallacy and provides no solid ground for the initial belief.\n    *   **Dogmatic Assumption:** The chain stops at a \"foundational\" belief that is accepted without justification. This violates the core requirement of JTB that knowledge must be justified.\n\n    This trilemma suggests that providing a complete and final justification for any belief is impossible, thus undermining the \"J\" in JTB.\n\n2.  **The Problem of the Justification Standard:** This problem centers on the question: \"How much justification is enough?\" The JTB definition does not specify the quality or quantity of justification required to turn a true belief into knowledge. This leads to a dilemma:\n    *   **If the standard is too low (Fallibilism):** This would mean that a belief could be considered \"justified\" even if the evidence is weak or fallible. This allows for instances where a person has a true belief based on flimsy but technically \"justified\" grounds. The belief would be true purely by luck, which intuitively should not count as knowledge.\n    *   **If the standard is too high (Infallibilism):** This would require that the justification must guarantee the truth of the belief, making it impossible to be wrong. Such a strict standard would mean that we have very little, if any, knowledge at all, leading to widespread skepticism.\n\n    With only two epistemic states available—Knowledge or Belief—this problem becomes particularly acute. There is no middle ground for a \"justified true belief that isn't quite knowledge.\" If a belief is true and meets the justification standard, it must be knowledge. The inability to define a non-arbitrary standard for justification that avoids both luck and skepticism is a fundamental flaw in the JTB framework.>>>"
