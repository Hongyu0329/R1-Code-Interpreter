**1. The Function `f(w)`:**

Let `P` be a formula variable. The function `f` maps a natural number `w` to the following linear logic formula:
$$ f(w) = (P^w)^⊥ $$
where `P^w` denotes the formula $\underbrace{P \otimes P \otimes \dots \otimes P}_{w \text{ times}}$ and `(F)^⊥` is shorthand for `F \multimap \bot`.

**2. The Formula `C(W, m, b)`:**

The formula `C` is defined as:
$$ C(W, m, b) = ((P^b)^⊥)^m $$
which is the formula $\underbrace{(P^b)^⊥ \otimes (P^b)^⊥ \otimes \dots \otimes (P^b)^⊥}_{m \text{ times}}$.

To satisfy the constraint that the formulas contain no literals, we can instantiate the formula variable `P` with a constant formula that itself contains no literals, for instance `\mathbf{1} \multimap \mathbf{1}`.
