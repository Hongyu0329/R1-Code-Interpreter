    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we must first calculate the number of functions for each atom (Carbon and Hydrogen) and then multiply by the number of each atom in the molecule.\n\n### Analysis of the 6-31G Basis Set\n\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes a split-valence basis set. Here's how it breaks down for each type of atom in toluene:\n\n*   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n    *   **Core electrons (1s):** The \"6\" indicates that the core 1s orbital is represented by a single contracted function, which is a combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions. This gives **1 contracted function**.\n    *   **Valence electrons (2s, 2p):** The \"31\" indicates that the valence shell is split into two parts.\n        *   The inner part of the valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals) is described by one set of contracted functions made from 3 primitive Gaussians each. This includes one s-orbital and three p-orbitals (px, py, pz), for a total of **4 contracted functions**.\n        *   The outer part of the valence shell is described by another set of functions, each made from a single primitive Gaussian. This also includes one s-orbital and three p-orbitals, for another **4 contracted functions**.\n    *   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted functions**.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   **Valence electrons (1s):** Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s valence orbital is split into two parts according to the \"31\" designation.\n        *   The inner part is one contracted function made from 3 primitive Gaussians. This gives **1 contracted function**.\n        *   The outer part is one contracted function made from 1 primitive Gaussian. This gives **1 contracted function**.\n    *   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence) = **2 contracted functions**.\n\n### Calculation for Toluene (C7H8)\n\nNow, we can calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire toluene molecule, which has 7 carbon atoms and 8 hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\n**Total Contracted Gaussian Functions:** 63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
