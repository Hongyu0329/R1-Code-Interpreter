    "Two Nobel laureates were featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign: physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** and economist **Paul Krugman**.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, appeared in one of the television commercials. In a video, Gell-Mann himself discussed being paid for his participation in the ad, which was renewed for a second year.\n\nPaul Krugman, who would later win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, also had a connection to Enron's \"Ask Why\" campaign. He served on an advisory board for Enron in 1999, for which he was paid. While his advisory role is well-documented, his direct appearance in a commercial is less so, though some reports from the time of the scandal linked him to the campaign's messaging.\n\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a broad advertising effort by Enron that included television spots and print ads, intended to portray the company as innovative and a challenger of conventional wisdom. The campaign preceded the company's massive accounting fraud scandal and subsequent bankruptcy in 2001.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
