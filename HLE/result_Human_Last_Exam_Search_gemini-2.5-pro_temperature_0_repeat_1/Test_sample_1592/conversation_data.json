    "Ontario is the closest province to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\nThe Waskaganish gathering place is located in the Cree community of Waskaganish, situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay in Quebec. The province of Ontario lies to the west of Waskaganish, with the border running through James Bay.\n\nWhile the territory of Nunavut is also near Waskaganish, with its boundaries including the islands within James Bay, the mainland of Ontario is geographically closer than any of Nunavut's islands. For instance, Stag Island, which is part of Nunavut, is located approximately 30 kilometers from Waskaganish. However, the land border of Ontario is nearer.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
