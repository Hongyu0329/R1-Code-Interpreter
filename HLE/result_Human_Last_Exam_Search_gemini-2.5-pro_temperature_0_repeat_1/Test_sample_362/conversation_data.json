    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. This reaction involves a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent, reacting with a carbonyl compound. A key advantage of this method is that the location of the newly formed double bond is precisely determined, unlike in other alkene synthesis methods like alcohol dehydration which can produce mixtures of isomers.\n\nTo determine the product of the specified reaction, we must identify the two reactants:\n\n1.  **The Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, also known as 2,2-dimethylpropanal, has the chemical structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n2.  **The Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is a phosphorus ylide. Its structure consists of a triphenylphosphine group bonded to a carbon chain: (C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde's carbonyl group (C=O) is exchanged with the carbon group of the ylide. In this case, the (CH₃)₃C-CH= part of pivalaldehyde combines with the =CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl) part of the ylide.\n\nThis combination results in the formation of a new alkene. The final product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe reaction mechanism involves the nucleophilic attack of the ylide on the carbonyl carbon, leading to an intermediate called an oxaphosphetane, which then decomposes to the final alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide. The formation of the very stable phosphorus-oxygen double bond in triphenylphosphine oxide is the driving force for the reaction.\n\nDepending on the ylide's structure and the reaction conditions, Wittig reactions can produce different stereoisomers (E/Z isomers). Ylides without stabilizing electron-withdrawing groups, like the one in this reaction, are considered \"non-stabilized\" and typically favor the formation of the Z-alkene (cis isomer). However, the presence of a sterically bulky group like the pivalaldehyde's tert-butyl group can influence the stereochemical outcome.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
