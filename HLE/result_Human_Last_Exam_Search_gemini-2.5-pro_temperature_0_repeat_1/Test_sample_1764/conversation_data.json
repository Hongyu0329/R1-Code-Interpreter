    "I have gathered definitions for \"finite ultrametric space\", \"Banach space\", and \"isometric embedding\". A finite ultrametric space is a finite set with a distance function satisfying the strong triangle inequality: d(x, z) ≤ max(d(x, y), d(y, z)). A Banach space is a complete normed vector space. An isometric embedding of a metric space into a Banach space is a map that preserves distances.\n\nThe search results indicate that any metric space can be isometrically embedded into a Banach space (specifically, the space of bounded functions on the metric space). One result explicitly states that for any finite ultrametric space M and any infinite-dimensional Banach space B, there exists an isometric embedding of M into B. Another result mentions that any n-point ultrametric can be embedded with uniformly bounded distortion into any Banach space of dimension log n, which is a weaker condition than isometry.\n\nThe concept of \"linearly rigid\" metric spaces, which admit a unique isometric embedding up to isometry, has been introduced. However, it is also stated that no separable ultrametric space is linearly rigid. This suggests that there might be multiple isometric embeddings.\n\nThe question asks for the *smallest possible number* of isometric embeddings. The existence of at least one embedding seems guaranteed. The fact that ultrametric spaces are not linearly rigid suggests the number is greater than one in general. However, the question is about the *smallest possible* number, which could be one if a specific X and B are chosen.\n\nI need to investigate if there's a case where only one isometric embedding exists, or if there are always multiple possibilities. The cardinality of the Banach space B, denoted by K, might be a relevant factor, although the result in holds for any infinite-dimensional Banach space.\n\nMy next step will be to look for results that discuss the uniqueness or non-uniqueness of such embeddings more directly. I will also investigate if the cardinality of the Banach space plays a role in limiting the number of embeddings.I have gathered significant information. The key findings are:\n\n1.  **Existence of Embeddings:** For any finite ultrametric space M and any infinite-dimensional Banach space B, there exists at least one isometric embedding of M into B. More generally, any separable metric space can be isometrically embedded into ℓ∞.\n\n2.  **Non-uniqueness:** Separable ultrametric spaces are not \"linearly rigid\". Linearly rigid spaces admit a unique (up to isometry) linearly dense isometric embedding into a Banach space. This strongly suggests that, in general, there is more than one isometric embedding.\n\n3.  **Kuratowski Embedding:** A standard way to isometrically embed a metric space (X, d) into a Banach space is the Kuratowski embedding, which maps a point x to the function f_x(y) = d(x, y) - d(x_0, y) for a fixed x_0 in X. This embeds X into the space of bounded functions on X, C_b(X), which is a Banach space.\n\n4.  **Lipschitz-free spaces:** The study of Lipschitz-free spaces F(M) over a metric space M provides a framework for understanding embeddings. The space M can be isometrically embedded into F(M). For a separable ultrametric space M, F(M) is isomorphic to ℓ1 but not isometric to it, and F(M) is not rotund. This again points towards a rich structure of possible embeddings.\n\n5.  **Embeddings into specific spaces:** Every n+1 point ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into Euclidean space R^n. Every separable ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded in l2.\n\nThe initial searches confirm the existence of at least one embedding and strongly suggest that uniqueness is not the norm. The question asks for the *smallest possible* number of isometric embeddings. This could be 1, even if for most X and B there are many.\n\nTo answer the question definitively, I need to determine if there exists *any* pair of a finite ultrametric space X and a Banach space B for which there is only one isometric embedding. The concept of \"linearly rigid\" spaces is close to this, but the definition includes the condition of the image being \"linearly dense\". It's possible that an embedding exists which is not linearly dense, and this could affect uniqueness.\n\nI will perform one more search to see if there are any known examples of finite ultrametric spaces that have a unique isometric embedding into a specific Banach space, perhaps under weaker conditions than linear rigidity. I will also consider if the cardinality of the Banach space B being finite (which is not explicitly ruled out by the prompt, although Banach spaces are typically over the real or complex numbers and thus infinite-dimensional if non-trivial) could lead to a unique embedding. However, a \"finite\" Banach space would just be {0}. Let's assume B is a non-trivial Banach space over R or C, and thus has at least the cardinality of the continuum. The prompt mentions K as the cardinality of B.\n\nGiven that no separable ultrametric space is linearly rigid, it is highly probable that there is always more than one isometric embedding. Let's try to construct a second one. If f: X -> B is an isometric embedding, is -f also an isometric embedding?\n||(-f(x)) - (-f(y))|| = ||-(f(x) - f(y))|| = ||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x, y).\nSo, if f is an embedding, then -f is also an embedding. When would f and -f be the same up to an isometry of B? An isometry of B is a map T: B -> B such that ||Tx - Ty|| = ||x - y|| for all x, y in B. If we take T to be the negation map T(v) = -v, this is an isometry. So f and -f are always equivalent up to an isometry of B.\n\nWhat about isometries of X? An isometry of X is a permutation g of X such that d(g(x), g(y)) = d(x, y). If f is an embedding, then f o g is also an embedding.\n\nLet's consider a simple case. Let X = {a, b} with d(a, b) = 1. Let B be any Banach space. We need to find f(a) and f(b) in B such that ||f(a) - f(b)|| = 1. We can choose f(a) = 0. Then we need ||f(b)|| = 1. There are infinitely many such points in any non-trivial Banach space. So for this simple X, there are infinitely many embeddings.\n\nLet's consider a three-point space X = {a, b, c} with d(a,b) = d(a,c) = d(b,c) = 1 (an equilateral triangle). This is an ultrametric space. We need to find f(a), f(b), f(c) in B such that ||f(a)-f(b)|| = ||f(a)-f(c)|| = ||f(b)-f(c)|| = 1. We can set f(a) = 0. Then we need ||f(b)|| = 1, ||f(c)|| = 1, and ||f(b)-f(c)|| = 1. In a Hilbert space, we can find such vectors. For example, in R^2, we can't find three points at distance 1 from each other. We need to go to a higher dimension. In any infinite-dimensional Banach space, such a configuration exists.\n\nThe literature suggests that for any finite ultrametric space, there are generally many isometric embeddings into a given infinite-dimensional Banach space. The question is about the *smallest possible* number.\n\nIf we consider the trivial ultrametric space with one point, X = {x}, then d(x,x) = 0. Any map f: X -> B is an isometric embedding, as ||f(x) - f(x)|| = 0. So there are K embeddings, where K is the cardinality of B.\n\nIf X has more than one point, say |X| = n > 1. Let x_0 be a point in X. An isometric embedding f can be chosen such that f(x_0) = 0. Then for any other x in X, f(x) must satisfy ||f(x)|| = d(x_0, x). For any two points x, y in X, we must have ||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x, y).\n\nThe fact that no separable ultrametric space is linearly rigid implies that there is no unique compatible norm on the free vector space over X. This suggests that there is always more than one way to define the embedding, leading to more than one embedding up to isometry.\n\nLet's reconsider the definition of \"linearly rigid\". It requires the affine span of the image to be dense. What if we don't require this? Could there be a unique embedding then? It seems unlikely.\n\nLet's assume the smallest possible number is 1 and try to find a contradiction. If there were only one isometric embedding (up to isometry of B), this would make the ultrametric space \"rigid\" in a very strong sense. The result that no separable ultrametric space is linearly rigid is a strong indicator that this is not the case.\n\nLet's think about the structure of finite ultrametric spaces. They can be represented by a rooted tree. This structure is quite flexible.\n\nConsider the case where B is finite-dimensional. For example, let X be a four-point ultrametric space and B = R^2. It might be that there are no isometric embeddings. But the question assumes embeddings exist. A key result is that any finite ultrametric space *can* be isometrically embedded in a Hilbert space (and thus in any infinite-dimensional Banach space).\n\nLet's assume X has at least two points. Let f be an isometric embedding. Then for any v in B, the map g(x) = f(x) + v is also an isometric embedding, since ||g(x) - g(y)|| = ||(f(x)+v) - (f(y)+v)|| = ||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x,y). If B is non-trivial, there is more than one choice for v, so there is more than one embedding. However, these are all equivalent up to a translation (which is an isometry of B). The question is about the number of embeddings, not equivalence classes of embeddings. If B is a vector space, its cardinality K is infinite (assuming it's a non-trivial real or complex Banach space). So there are at least K such embeddings.\n\nThe question must be interpreted as asking for the number of non-equivalent isometric embeddings under isometries of the target space B. If so, we can fix one point f(x_0) = 0.\n\nEven then, for X = {a, b} with d(a,b)=1, and fixing f(a)=0, any vector f(b) with ||f(b)||=1 will do. The set of such vectors is the unit sphere of B. In any infinite-dimensional Banach space, the unit sphere is infinite. So there are infinitely many non-equivalent embeddings.\n\nWhat if B is finite-dimensional? Let B = R^n. The unit sphere is still infinite.\n\nPerhaps the question is simpler. Maybe there's a case where the number is small and finite.\n\nLet's reconsider the \"linearly rigid\" concept. A space is linearly rigid if it admits a unique, up to isometry, *linearly dense* isometric embedding. The fact that ultrametric spaces are not linearly rigid means that either there is no linearly dense embedding, or there is more than one. This doesn't preclude the possibility of a unique non-linearly dense embedding.\n\nHowever, the general sentiment from the literature is that ultrametric spaces are flexible and admit many embeddings.\n\nLet's consider the most trivial non-trivial case. X = {a, b}, d(a,b) = 1. B is a Banach space. An embedding f is determined by the choice of f(a) and f(b) in B such that ||f(a) - f(b)|| = 1. Let's count the number of such pairs (f(a), f(b)). The cardinality of B is K. We can choose f(a) to be any of the K points. Then f(b) must be a point at distance 1 from f(a). For any point v in B, the set {w in B: ||w-v||=1} is the sphere of radius 1 centered at v. In a non-trivial Banach space over R or C, this sphere is always an infinite set. So the number of embeddings is at least K * infinity, which is K if K is infinite.\n\nThis suggests the number of embeddings is always infinite if B is a typical Banach space. Is it possible that for some very specific, \"small\" Banach space, the number is finite? A Banach space over a finite field is not a standard definition. A finite-dimensional Banach space over R or C still has infinitely many points.\n\nPerhaps the question is about the number of *isometry classes* of embeddings. Two embeddings f1, f2 are in the same class if there is an isometry T of B such that f2 = T o f1.\nFor X = {a, b}, d(a,b)=1. Let f1 be an embedding. We can assume f1(a)=0, f1(b)=u with ||u||=1. Let f2 be another embedding, f2(a)=0, f2(b)=v with ||v||=1. Are f1 and f2 equivalent? We need an isometry T of B such that T(0)=0 and T(u)=v. If B is a Hilbert space, such a T (a rotation) exists if and only if the dimension is high enough. But for a general Banach space, such a T might not exist. The group of isometries fixing the origin of a Banach space can be very small. For some Banach spaces, the only such isometries are +-Id. In that case, for our two-point example, we would have at least as many non-equivalent embeddings as half the number of points on the unit sphere.\n\nThis seems to be getting very technical and dependent on the specific choice of B. The question asks for the \"smallest possible number\". This suggests we should be able to find a specific X and B for which this number is minimized.\n\nLet's reconsider the possibility that the answer is 0. Could there be a finite ultrametric space X and a Banach space B such that there are *no* isometric embeddings? The result from and says this is not the case if B is infinite-dimensional. What if B is finite-dimensional? A finite ultrametric space can always be embedded in a Hilbert space of sufficiently high dimension. So we can always find a Banach space (a Hilbert space) that works. So the number is at least 1.\n\nSo the smallest possible number is at least 1.\n\nIs it possible for the number to be exactly 1? This would mean that for some X and B, there is a unique isometric embedding (up to isometry of B). Let's assume such an (X, B) pair exists. Let f be the unique embedding. As argued before, if we fix f(x_0)=0, this fixes the image of one point. For any other point x, f(x) must lie on the sphere of radius d(x_0, x). The uniqueness would imply that the intersection of all spheres defined by the distance relations from all other points results in a single point for each x.\n\nThis seems highly unlikely given the geometric properties of Banach spaces.\n\nLet's try a different angle. What if the ultrametric space X is very simple?\n- |X|=1: As discussed, K embeddings.\n- |X|=2, X={x1, x2}, d(x1, x2)=d. Infinitely many embeddings in any standard Banach space.\n- |X|=3, X={x1, x2, x3}, d(x1,x2)=d1, d(x1,x3)=d2, d(x2,x3)=d3 with ultrametric inequality. Let d1=d2=1, d3=1 (equilateral). This is an ultrametric. We need to find v2, v3 in B with ||v2||=1, ||v3||=1, ||v2-v3||=1 (after setting f(x1)=0). In l_infinity^2, we can take v2=(1,0), v3=(0,1). Then ||v2||=1, ||v3||=1, ||v2-v3||=||(1,-1)||=1. So an embedding exists. Is it unique? We could also take v2=(1,0) and v3=(1,1). Then ||v2||=1, ||v3||=1, ||v2-v3||=||(0,-1)||=1. So we have found two different sets of images for {x2, x3}. Are these equivalent by an isometry of l_infinity^2 that fixes the origin? The isometries of l_infinity^2 are limited. This suggests non-uniqueness.\n\nThe paper \"Linearly rigid metric spaces and the embedding problem\" states: \"The goal of this paper is to describe the class of complete separable metric (= Polish) spaces (X, %) which have the following property: there is a unique (up to isometry) isometric embedding of (X, %) in a Banach space such that the affine span of the image of X is dense... We call such metric spaces linearly rigid.\" It later states that no separable ultrametric space is linearly rigid. This is the most direct piece of evidence. It implies that for any isometric embedding of a finite (and thus separable) ultrametric space X into a Banach space B such that the image is linearly dense, there exists another, non-equivalent one. This doesn't cover non-linearly-dense embeddings.\n\nHowever, the paper \"Isometric embedding of finite ultrametric spaces in Banach spaces\" by S. A. Shkarin is cited in. A search for this paper might be fruitful. The abstract of a related paper by Shkarin says \"We prove that for any finite ultrametric space M and any infinite-dimensional Banach space B there exists an isometric embedding of M into B.\"\n\nLet's assume the answer is 0. This is contradicted by the existence theorems.\nLet's assume the answer is 1. This would imply some form of rigidity. But ultrametric spaces are characterized as non-rigid.\n\nWhat if the question is interpreted not up to isometry of B? Then the number is always infinite for any non-trivial B, as we can translate the image. This seems too simple. The question must imply counting embeddings that are somehow distinct in a meaningful way, i.e., not just by a simple transformation of the target space. The standard way to do this is to consider embeddings to be equivalent if they are related by an isometry of the target space.\n\nSo, let's assume we are counting isometry classes of embeddings.\nThe evidence points to this number being greater than 1 in general. Is it possible to construct a scenario where it is exactly 1?\nIf B is the zero space {0}, then any ultrametric space with more than one point cannot be embedded. If the space has one point, it can be embedded in one way. But B={0} is a trivial Banach space. Let's assume B is non-trivial.\n\nIf X has only two points {x,y} with distance d, and B is a space where the group of isometries fixing the origin acts transitively on the unit sphere (like a Hilbert space), then all embeddings with f(x)=0 are equivalent. So there is only 1 isometry class of embeddings.\nLet's check if a two-point space is ultrametric. Yes, any metric space with two points is ultrametric.\nSo, for X = {x, y} and B being a Hilbert space, there is exactly one isometry class of embeddings.\n\nLet's verify this.\nAn embedding is a map f: {x,y} -> B.\nLet's count isometry classes. Let f1 be one embedding. By applying an isometry T(v) = v - f1(x), we get an equivalent embedding f1' with f1'(x) = 0. Then ||f1'(y) - f1'(x)|| = ||f1'(y)|| = d(x,y). So f1'(y) is a vector of norm d(x,y).\nLet f2 be another embedding. We can also find an equivalent f2' with f2'(x) = 0 and ||f2'(y)|| = d(x,y).\nNow, f1' and f2' are equivalent if there is an isometry T' of B with T'(0)=0 such that T'(f1'(y)) = f2'(y).\nThis means we need an isometry that maps one vector on the sphere of radius d(x,y) to another vector on the same sphere.\nIn a Hilbert space of dimension >= 2, the group of isometries fixing the origin (the orthogonal group) acts transitively on the unit sphere. This means for any two vectors u, v with ||u||=||v||, there is an isometry T' with T'(u)=v.\nSo, for X being a two-point space and B being a Hilbert space of dimension at least 2, there is exactly one isometry class of embeddings.\n\nA two-point space {x,y} with metric d(x,y)=d > 0 is a finite ultrametric space.\nA Hilbert space is a Banach space. Its cardinality K is infinite.\nSo, we have found a finite ultrametric space X and a Banach space B for which the number of non-equivalent isometric embeddings is 1.\n\nThe question is \"What is the smallest possible number...\". We have found a case where the number is 1. We already argued that the number must be at least 1 for any non-empty X.\nTherefore, the smallest possible number is 1.\n\nLet's double-check the reasoning.\n1. The question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings. This implies we can choose X and B to minimize this number.\n2. The number of embeddings is not meant to be a raw count of functions, as translations f(x) -> f(x)+v would make it infinite for any non-trivial B. It must refer to the number of isometry classes of embeddings, where two embeddings f1, f2 are equivalent if f2 = T o f1 for some isometry T of B.\n3. Let X be a two-point metric space {x1, x2} with d(x1, x2) = d > 0. This is a finite ultrametric space.\n4. Let B be a Hilbert space of dimension >= 2. A Hilbert space is a Banach space.\n5. We want to count the number of isometry classes of embeddings f: X -> B.\n6. Any embedding f can be transformed into an equivalent embedding f' = T o f where T(v) = v - f(x1). This f' has the property that f'(x1) = 0. Then ||f'(x2)|| = ||f'(x2) - f'(x1)|| = d(x1, x2) = d.\n7. So every isometry class is represented by an embedding that maps x1 to the origin and x2 to a vector of norm d.\n8. Let f_u and f_v be two such representatives, with f_u(x1)=0, f_u(x2)=u and f_v(x1)=0, f_v(x2)=v, where ||u||=||v||=d.\n9. f_u and f_v are in the same isometry class if there exists an isometry S of B such that S o f_u = f_v. This requires S(0) = f_v(x1) = 0 and S(u) = f_v(x2) = v.\n10. In a Hilbert space of dimension >= 2, for any two vectors u, v with the same norm, there exists an isometry S (a rotation) fixing the origin such that S(u) = v.\n11. Therefore, all embeddings of the form f_u are equivalent.\n12. This means there is only one isometry class of embeddings.\n13. The number of embeddings is 1.\n14. Since the number must be at least 1 (as embeddings exist), the minimum possible number is 1.\n\nThis seems correct. The key is that for a simple enough ultrametric space (a two-point space), the conditions on the image points in B are simple enough that the isometry group of a \"nice\" Banach space (a Hilbert space) can map any valid configuration to any other, making them all equivalent. For more complex ultrametric spaces, the configuration of image points becomes more rigid, and it's no longer guaranteed that an isometry of B can map one valid configuration to another. For instance, for a 3-point equilateral configuration, the angles between the vectors are fixed. An isometry must preserve these angles.\n\nThe argument holds. The smallest possible number is 1.An isometric embedding of a metric space $(X, d_X)$ into a normed space $(B, ||\\cdot||)$ is a function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, we have $||f(x_1) - f(x_2)|| = d_X(x_1, x_2)$. The question asks for the smallest possible number of such embeddings for a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$.\n\nFirst, it is important to clarify what \"number of isometric embeddings\" means. If we count every single function that satisfies the condition, then for any non-trivial Banach space $B$ (i.e., $B \\neq \\{0\\}$) and any finite ultrametric space $X$ that admits at least one embedding $f$, the number of embeddings is infinite. This is because if $f$ is an isometric embedding, then for any vector $v \\in B$, the translated function $g(x) = f(x) + v$ is also an isometric embedding:\n$||g(x_1) - g(x_2)|| = ||(f(x_1) + v) - (f(x_2) + v)|| = ||f(x_1) - f(x_2)|| = d_X(x_1, x_2)$.\nSince a non-trivial Banach space has infinitely many points, there are infinitely many choices for $v$, leading to infinitely many embeddings.\n\nTherefore, the question should be interpreted as asking for the smallest possible number of *isometry classes* of embeddings. Two embeddings, $f_1$ and $f_2$, are considered equivalent or in the same isometry class if there exists an isometry $T$ of the Banach space $B$ such that $f_2(x) = T(f_1(x))$ for all $x \\in X$.\n\nThe existence of at least one isometric embedding is well-established. For any finite ultrametric space $M$, and any infinite-dimensional Banach space $B$, there exists an isometric embedding of $M$ into $B$. Furthermore, any finite ultrametric space can be isometrically embedded into a finite-dimensional Hilbert space (which is a specific type of Banach space). Thus, the smallest possible number is at least 1.\n\nNow, we need to determine if this number can be exactly 1. Let's consider the simplest non-trivial finite ultrametric space.\nLet $X$ be a two-point space, $X = \\{x_1, x_2\\}$, with the metric $d_X(x_1, x_2) = d > 0$. Any metric space with only two points is an ultrametric space, as the ultrametric inequality $d(x, z) \\le \\max\\{d(x, y), d(y, z)\\}$ holds trivially for any three points.\n\nLet's choose the Banach space $B$ to be a Hilbert space of dimension at least 2, for instance, $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with the standard Euclidean norm. A Hilbert space is a Banach space.\n\nLet $f: X \\to B$ be an isometric embedding. We can define an equivalent embedding $f'$ by composing $f$ with the isometry $T(v) = v - f(x_1)$. The new embedding is $f'(x) = f(x) - f(x_1)$, and it has the property that $f'(x_1) = 0$. The isometric property requires $||f'(x_2) - f'(x_1)|| = d_X(x_1, x_2)$, which simplifies to $||f'(x_2)|| = d$. So, any isometry class of embeddings has a representative that maps $x_1$ to the origin and $x_2$ to a vector of norm $d$.\n\nNow, consider two such representative embeddings, $f_u$ and $f_v$, where:\n- $f_u(x_1) = 0$ and $f_u(x_2) = u$ with $||u|| = d$.\n- $f_v(x_1) = 0$ and $f_v(x_2) = v$ with $||v|| = d$.\n\nFor $f_u$ and $f_v$ to be in the same isometry class, there must exist an isometry $S$ of the Banach space $B$ such that $f_v = S \\circ f_u$. This requires $S(f_u(x_1)) = f_v(x_1)$, which means $S(0) = 0$, and $S(f_u(x_2)) = f_v(x_2)$, which means $S(u) = v$.\n\nIn a Hilbert space of dimension 2 or greater, the group of isometries that fix the origin (the orthogonal group) acts transitively on the sphere of any given radius. This means that for any two vectors $u$ and $v$ with the same norm ($||u|| = ||v|| = d$), there exists such an isometry $S$ (a rotation) with $S(u) = v$.\n\nTherefore, all embeddings of the two-point space $X$ into a Hilbert space $B$ are equivalent up to an isometry of $B$. This means there is exactly one isometry class of embeddings.\n\nSince we have found an example of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which the number of non-equivalent isometric embeddings is 1, and we know the number must be at least 1, the smallest possible number is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
