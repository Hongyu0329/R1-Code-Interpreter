    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by the addition of methyl iodide, results in the formation of **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThis transformation occurs through a process known as directed ortho-metalation (DoM). Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction mechanism:\n\n1.  **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM):** The first step involves the deprotonation of the aromatic ring. The starting material, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, has two directing metalation groups (DMGs): the tertiary amide group (-CONEt₂) at position 1 and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at position 3. Both of these groups can direct the deprotonation to a nearby (ortho) position by coordinating with the lithium ion of the sec-BuLi. The tertiary amide is one of the most powerful directing groups available. When two directing groups are present, the lithiation occurs at the position ortho to the stronger directing group. In this case, both groups direct the lithiation to the C2 position, which is ortho to both the amide and the dimethylamino groups, making this proton the most acidic on the ring. The sec-BuLi, a strong base, removes this proton, forming a lithiated intermediate. The presence of TMEDA enhances the basicity of the sec-BuLi by chelating the lithium ion, which facilitates the deprotonation.\n\n2.  **Electrophilic Quench:** The resulting aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile. In the second step, it reacts with methyl iodide (CH₃I), which is an electrophile. The nucleophilic carbon at the C2 position attacks the methyl group of the methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond.\n\nThe final product is therefore N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
