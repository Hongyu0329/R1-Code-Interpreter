    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat), Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures.\n\nSimilar to his groundbreaking paper on special relativity published in the same year, the paper on Brownian motion is notable for its lack of references to the contemporary scientific literature. While Einstein's work was built upon the foundations of the kinetic theory of heat, he did not formally cite the works of others in this particular paper. In fact, it is reported that Einstein was not even aware of the full extent of previous experimental observations of Brownian motion when he wrote his paper.\n\nAlthough in other contexts Einstein did refer to the lectures of Ludwig Boltzmann on gas theory, there is no evidence that he cited them in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion. The paper's style, with minimal to no citations, was not unusual for Einstein's publications during that period.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
