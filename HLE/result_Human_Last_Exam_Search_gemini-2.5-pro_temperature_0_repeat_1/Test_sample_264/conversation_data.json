    "The search results confirm my initial approach. When two axis-aligned cubes intersect, the intersection is also an axis-aligned rectangular prism (in this case, a cube). The volume is found by calculating the length of the intersection on each axis and multiplying them together.\n\nLet's formalize the calculation.\n\nLet the first cube, C1, be defined by the region where:\n*   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThe main diagonal of this cube connects the vertex (0, 0, 0) to the vertex (1, 1, 1). The vector representing this diagonal is (1, 1, 1).\n\nThe second cube, C2, is shifted by 1/2 along this main diagonal. This means the shift vector is (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Therefore, C2 is defined by the region where:\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n\nThe intersection of these two cubes is the region where a point (x, y, z) satisfies the conditions for both C1 and C2. We find the intersection of the intervals for each coordinate:\n*   For the x-axis: ∩ [1/2, 3/2] = [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   For the y-axis: ∩ [1/2, 3/2] = [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n*   For the z-axis: ∩ [1/2, 3/2] = [1/2, 1]. The length of this interval is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThe intersection is a cube with side lengths of 1/2.\n\nThe volume of this intersection is the product of the lengths of these intersection intervals:\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\nThe problem could be interpreted differently, for example, if the second cube was also rotated. However, the phrasing \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" most commonly implies a simple translation without rotation, keeping the cubes axis-aligned. The search results about intersecting non-axis-aligned cubes involve much more complex methods like the Separating Axis Theorem, which do not seem to be what this straightforwardly-phrased problem is asking for.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the intersection is 1/8.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1.  Define Cube 1:xx. Volume = 1.\n2.  Define the shift: The main diagonal vector is (1,1,1). A shift of 1/2 along this diagonal is a translation by the vector (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n3.  Define Cube 2: [1/2, 3/2]x[1/2, 3/2]x[1/2, 3/2]. Volume = 1.\n4.  Define the intersection: The intersection is the region where the coordinates fall within the ranges of both cubes.\n    *   x: max(0, 1/2) to min(1, 3/2) -> [1/2, 1]\n    *   y: max(0, 1/2) to min(1, 3/2) -> [1/2, 1]\n    *   z: max(0, 1/2) to min(1, 3/2) -> [1/2, 1]\n5.  The intersection is a cube with side length 1/2.\n6.  Calculate the volume of the intersection: (1/2)^3 = 1/8.\n\nThe logic is sound and the calculation is straightforward.\n\nFinal answer is 1/8.\n<<<1/8>>>"
