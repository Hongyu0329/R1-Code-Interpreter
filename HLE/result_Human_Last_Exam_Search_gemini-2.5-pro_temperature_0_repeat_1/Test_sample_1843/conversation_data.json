    "My initial analysis seems correct. The search results confirm the key principles I used.\n\n*   **Factorization of Conductor and Character**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$. This confirms step 2 of my reasoning.\n*   **Order of a Product of Characters**: The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple of the orders of the component characters $\\chi_i$. This is a standard property of group theory and is implicitly used in the sources.\n*   **Number of Primitive Characters**: The search results provide formulas and descriptions for the number of primitive characters modulo prime powers. My calculations for the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor of $N$ and their possible orders are consistent with the information found. For a prime power $p^a$, the number of primitive characters is $\\phi(p^a) - \\phi(p^{a-1})$ (for $p$ odd, $a \\ge 1$) or more generally, derived from the structure of the character group.\n*   **My specific calculations**:\n    *   $N = 36036 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n    *   Primitive characters mod 4: 1 character of order 2.\n    *   Primitive characters mod 9: 4 characters, with orders 3 (two characters) and 6 (two characters).\n    *   Primitive characters mod 7: 5 non-trivial characters, with orders 2 (one), 3 (two), and 6 (two).\n    *   Primitive characters mod 11: 9 non-trivial characters. Those with order dividing 6 must have order 2 (one character).\n    *   Primitive characters mod 13: 11 non-trivial characters. Those with order dividing 6 can have order 2 (one), 3 (two), or 6 (two).\n\nThe logic that the lcm of the orders of the component characters must be 6 seems robust.\n1.  The order of each component character must divide 6.\n2.  The lcm must be a multiple of 2 (due to the character mod 4).\n3.  The lcm must be a multiple of 3 (due to the character mod 9, whose order must be 3 or 6).\n\nTherefore, the lcm is always a multiple of 6. Since all component orders divide 6, their lcm must also divide 6. This forces the lcm to be exactly 6.\n\nThe final calculation is the product of the number of available choices for each component character that satisfies the order condition.\n\n*   Choices for $\\chi_1$ (mod 4): order 2. (1 character)\n*   Choices for $\\chi_2$ (mod 9): order 3 or 6. (2+2 = 4 characters)\n*   Choices for $\\chi_3$ (mod 7): order 2, 3, or 6. (1+2+2 = 5 characters)\n*   Choices for $\\chi_4$ (mod 11): order 2. (1 character)\n*   Choices for $\\chi_5$ (mod 13): order 2, 3, or 6. (1+2+2 = 5 characters)\n\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nThe reasoning is sound and confirmed by the general principles found in the search results. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nTo find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization of N**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n    $N = 36036 = 360 \\times 100 + 36 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 10 \\times 10 + 36$ - this is not a good way.\n    $N = 36036 = 4 \\times 9009 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 1001 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\n2.  **Decomposition of the Character**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive characters corresponding to the prime power factors of $N$.\n    Let $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4 \\chi_5$, where:\n    *   $\\chi_1$ is a primitive character modulo $2^2 = 4$.\n    *   $\\chi_2$ is a primitive character modulo $3^2 = 9$.\n    *   $\\chi_3$ is a primitive character modulo $7$.\n    *   $\\chi_4$ is a primitive character modulo $11$.\n    *   $\\chi_5$ is a primitive character modulo $13$.\n\n3.  **Order of the Character**: The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\n    We are given that this order must be 6.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Component Characters**: We determine the possible orders for each primitive component character and the number of characters for each valid order. The group of characters modulo $p^a$ is isomorphic to the group of units $(\\mathbb{Z}/p^a\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\n\n    *   **Modulo 4**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one primitive character, and its order is 2. So, for $\\chi_1$, there is 1 choice, and its order is 2.\n\n    *   **Modulo 9**: The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{\\phi(9)} = C_6$. A character is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(3)=2$. The possible orders for a primitive character are 3 and 6.\n        *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n        *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n        For $\\chi_2$, there are $2+2=4$ choices.\n\n    *   **Modulo 7**: The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. The order of $\\chi_3$ must divide 6.\n        *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n        *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n        *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n        For $\\chi_3$, there are $1+2+2=5$ choices.\n\n    *   **Modulo 11**: The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. The order of $\\chi_4$ must divide 6. The only divisor of 10 (other than 1) that also divides 6 is 2.\n        *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n        For $\\chi_4$, there is 1 choice, and its order is 2.\n\n    *   **Modulo 13**: The character group is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. The order of $\\chi_5$ must divide 6. The divisors of 12 that also divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n        *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n        *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n        *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n        For $\\chi_5$, there are $1+2+2=5$ choices.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: We need to count the number of combinations of these characters such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n    Let the orders be $(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4, k_5)$.\n    *   $k_1 = 2$.\n    *   $k_2 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$.\n    *   $k_3 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    *   $k_4 = 2$.\n    *   $k_5 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n    The lcm of these orders must be a multiple of 2 (since $k_1=2$) and a multiple of 3 (since $k_2$ is always a multiple of 3). Therefore, the lcm is always a multiple of 6.\n    Furthermore, since all possible orders are divisors of 6, their lcm must also be a divisor of 6.\n    A number that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 must be 6. Thus, any combination of the allowed characters will have an order of exactly 6.\n\n    The total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\n    Number of characters = (choices for $\\chi_1$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_2$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_3$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_5$)\n    Number of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n<<<100>>>"
