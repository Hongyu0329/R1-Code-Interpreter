    "To compute the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area, we first need to identify the space $X$.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Space X\n\nA lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the integer span of a basis of vectors $(v_1, v_2)$. These vectors can be represented as the columns of a matrix $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$. The set of all lattices can be identified with the quotient space $GL_2(\\mathbb{R})/GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, where $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is the group of integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$, representing changes of basis for the lattice.\n\nThe area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice $L$ is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The condition that the lattice has \"unit area\" restricts us to matrices $A$ where $|\\det(A)|=1$. The set of such matrices is $SL^{\\pm}_2(\\mathbb{R}) = \\{A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(A) = \\pm 1\\}$.\n\nThe \"moduli space\" implies that we identify lattices that are equivalent up to isometry. The group of isometries of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that fix the origin is the orthogonal group $O(2)$. Two lattices $L_1$ and $L_2$ are considered the same point in the moduli space if $L_2 = k L_1$ for some $k \\in O(2)$. This corresponds to a left action of $O(2)$ on the space of basis matrices.\n\nTherefore, the moduli space $X$ is the set of orbits:\n$X = O(2) \\backslash SL^{\\pm}_2(\\mathbb{R}) / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### 2. Simplifying the Space X\n\nWe can simplify this quotient space. Let's first consider the quotient by the group of orientation-preserving isometries, $SO(2)$. The Iwasawa decomposition of a matrix $A \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is $A=KAN$, where $K \\in SO(2)$, $A$ is a diagonal matrix with positive entries, and $N$ is an upper-triangular matrix with 1s on the diagonal. The space $SO(2) \\backslash SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is diffeomorphic to the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$. This is the space of conformal structures, or \"shapes\" of lattices.\n\nThe full orthogonal group is $O(2) = SO(2) \\cup k \\cdot SO(2)$ where $k = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$ is a reflection. The left quotient $O(2) \\backslash SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is the quotient of $\\mathbb{H}$ by the involution induced by $k$. This action on $\\mathbb{H}$ is $z \\mapsto -\\bar{z}$. The resulting quotient space is contractible.\n\nLet $W = O(2) \\backslash SL^{\\pm}_2(\\mathbb{R})$. This space has two connected components, $W_1 = O(2) \\backslash SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ and $W_2 = O(2) \\backslash \\{A \\mid \\det(A)=-1\\}$. Both components are contractible.\n\nNow, we take the quotient by $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ on the right. The group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ acts on the set of two components $\\{W_1, W_2\\}$. An element $g \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ with $\\det(g)=1$ (i.e., $g \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$) preserves each component. An element with $\\det(g)=-1$ swaps the two components.\nTherefore, the action is transitive on the components, and the quotient space is connected. We can compute $X$ as the quotient of one component by the stabilizer subgroup:\n$X \\cong W_1 / SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nSince $W_1 = O(2) \\backslash SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is a contractible space and $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a discrete group acting on it, the quotient space $X$ is an Eilenberg-MacLane space $K(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), 1)$.\n\n### 3. Computing the Homology\n\nFor an Eilenberg-MacLane space $K(G,1)$, the homology groups of the space are isomorphic to the group homology of the group $G$.\n$H_n(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_n(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nFor the first homology group ($n=1$), this is the abelianization of the group $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$:\n$H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})^{ab}$.\n\nThe special linear group $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by the matrices:\n$S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe defining relations for $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ can be given by $S^4 = I$ and $(ST)^3 = S^2$. Note that $S^2 = -I$ is a central element.\n\nTo find the abelianization, we add the relation that $S$ and $T$ commute ($ST=TS$).\nFrom the relation $(ST)^3 = S^2$, we get $S^3 T^3 = S^2$. Since $S$ is invertible, we can multiply by $S^{-2}$ to get $S T^3 = I$, or $S = T^{-3}$.\nNow substitute this into the other relation, $S^4=I$:\n$(T^{-3})^4 = I \\implies T^{-12} = I \\implies T^{12} = I$.\nThe abelianized group is generated by the image of $T$, and the only relation is that its order is 12. Therefore, the abelianization is the cyclic group of order 12.\n\n$SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})^{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n\nThus, the first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area is $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n\n"
