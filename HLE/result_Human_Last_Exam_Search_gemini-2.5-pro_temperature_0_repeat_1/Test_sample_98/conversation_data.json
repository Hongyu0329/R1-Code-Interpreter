    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is standing on one of its twenty triangular faces, that face forms the base of the tank. Due to the symmetrical nature of the icosahedron, there is an identical, parallel triangular face that forms the top of the tank.\n\nThe point of being \"half-filled\" with water corresponds to the water level reaching the exact center of the icosahedron's volume. Because of the icosahedron's high degree of symmetry, this half-full level is a horizontal plane situated precisely midway between the bottom and top faces.\n\nThe shape of the water's surface is therefore determined by the cross-section of the icosahedron at this central plane. When a plane cuts through an icosahedron parallel to one of its triangular faces at the halfway point, it intersects six of the other faces. The resulting shape of this intersection is a regular hexagon. This is because the icosahedron possesses three-fold rotational symmetry through the center of its opposite faces, which ensures that the hexagonal cross-section is equilateral and equiangular.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
