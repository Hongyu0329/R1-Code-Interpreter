    "The individual referred to, the traditional author of the work in question (the Book of Deuteronomy), is Moses.\n\nAccording to the user's description of Veronika Campan's interpretation, it is at the end of Moses' work, specifically in the last of the Ten Commandments, that the issue of another's material possessions is addressed. The Ten Commandments are reiterated in the Book of Deuteronomy. The final commandment is a prohibition against coveting your neighbor's property. The \"prohibition against representation\" refers to the second commandment, which forbids the making of graven images for worship.\n\nA possible scholarly interpretation, potentially from Véronique Campan's work on Krzysztof Kieślowski's film series \"The Decalogue,\" connects these two commandments. This interpretation would suggest that the act of coveting involves creating a mental \"representation\" or \"image\" of the desired person or object, thereby linking the tenth commandment to the principles of the second.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
