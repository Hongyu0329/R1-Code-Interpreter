    "On Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green) and blue itself is **G**.\n\nIsaac Newton created a color wheel where he linked the seven colors of the light spectrum to the seven notes of a musical scale. He based this on the Dorian mode, a musical scale that begins on the note D.\n\nThe correspondence is as follows:\n*   **Red:** D\n*   **Orange:** E\n*   **Yellow:** F\n*   **Green:** G\n*   **Blue:** A\n*   **Indigo:** B\n*   **Violet:** C\n\nThe color produced by mixing the primary colors yellow and blue is the secondary color green. According to Newton's system, the color green is associated with the musical note G. Therefore, the range beginning with green and extending to blue starts with the note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
