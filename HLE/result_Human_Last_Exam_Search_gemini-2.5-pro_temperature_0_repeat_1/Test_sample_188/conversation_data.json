  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "The problem provides several pieces of information, but the core of the question is about determining the maximum possible length of a message based on the number of symbols available to encode it.\n\n1.  **The \"Ching\" book** is the container for the encrypted message and has exactly 9999 symbols. These symbols are the building blocks of the encrypted text.\n2.  **The \"Shu\" book** provides the alphabet for the secret message. This alphabet consists of 120 unique Chinese characters.\n3.  **The Encryption:** The symbols in the \"Ching\" are used to represent the characters from the \"Shu\". To achieve the maximum possible message length, the most efficient encoding scheme is a one-to-one mapping, where each symbol in the \"Ching\" corresponds to exactly one character in the secret message.\n\nIf each of the 9999 symbols in the \"Ching\" encodes one character, the total length of the message would be 9999 characters. Using multiple symbols to encode a single character would result in a shorter message, not a longer one.\n\nThe other details, such as the total number of characters in the Shu (around 3000), the character recognition time (12 ms), and the computation time for operations (10 ns and 30 ns), are extraneous to calculating the maximum length of the message.\n\nTherefore, the maximum length of the secret message is equal to the number of symbols available in the \"Ching\" book.\n\n<<<9999>>>"
