    "To determine which transformation is not possible for a unitary quantum gate, we must check which of the given transformations cannot be represented by a single, consistent unitary operator. A unitary operator `U` must satisfy two crucial properties:\n\n1.  **Linearity:** For any states `|ψ₁⟩`, `|ψ₂⟩` and complex numbers `α`, `β`, the operator must satisfy `U(α|ψ₁⟩ + β|ψ₂⟩) = αU|ψ₁⟩ + βU|ψ₂⟩`.\n2.  **Unitarity:** The operator must preserve the inner product between any two states, which means `⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩`. Geometrically, this corresponds to a rotation on the Bloch sphere, preserving all angles and distances.\n\nThe six basis states can be expressed in terms of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`:\n*   `|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n*   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n*   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n\nA quantum gate's action is fully defined by its effect on the computational basis states, `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`. The transformation of any other state is then determined by linearity. However, quantum states are equivalent up to a global phase factor (i.e., `|ψ⟩` is physically indistinguishable from `e^(iφ)|ψ⟩`).\n\nA transformation `T` is possible if there exists a single unitary operator `U` and a set of phase factors `c_ψ` such that for every state `|ψ⟩` in the list, the specified output `T(|ψ⟩)` is physically equivalent to the action of `U` on `|ψ⟩`. That is, `T(|ψ⟩) = c_ψ * U(|ψ⟩)`.\n\nLet's analyze option F:\n*   `|0⟩ -> |+⟩`\n*   `|1⟩ -> |-⟩`\n*   `|+⟩ -> |1⟩`\n*   `|-⟩ -> |0⟩`\n*   `|i⟩ -> |i⟩`\n*   `|-i⟩ -> |-i⟩`\n\nLet's define a linear operator `U` based on its action on the computational basis:\n*   `U|0⟩ = |+⟩`\n*   `U|1⟩ = |-⟩`\n\nThis operator `U` is the Hadamard gate (`H`), which is a valid unitary gate. Now, we must check if the transformations for the other four states are consistent with this `U`, up to a global phase.\n\n1.  **Check `|+⟩`:**\n    Using linearity, `U|+⟩ = U((1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)) = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`.\n    Substituting the definitions for `U|0⟩` and `U|1⟩`:\n    `U|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|+⟩ + |-⟩) = (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(|0⟩+|1⟩) + (1/√2)(|0⟩-|1⟩) ] = (1/2)(2|0⟩) = |0⟩`.\n    The table for F states that `|+⟩ -> |1⟩`.\n    The calculated output state is `|0⟩`, while the specified output is `|1⟩`. These two states are orthogonal (`⟨0|1⟩ = 0`) and cannot be made equal by multiplying by a phase factor. Therefore, the transformation for `|+⟩` is inconsistent with the transformations for `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`.\n\n2.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since the transformation specified in option F is not self-consistent under the rules of linear quantum mechanics, it is not possible for any single unitary quantum gate to achieve this set of transformations.\n\nLet's briefly verify another option, for instance C, to see the difference.\n*   `|0⟩ -> |+⟩`, `|1⟩ -> |-⟩`, `|+⟩ -> |0⟩`, `|-⟩ -> |1⟩`, `|i⟩ -> |-i⟩`, `|-i⟩ -> |i⟩`\nHere, `U` is also the Hadamard gate `H`.\n*   `U|+⟩ = |0⟩`. The table says `|+⟩ -> |0⟩`. This is consistent.\n*   `U|-⟩ = |1⟩`. The table says `|-⟩ -> |1⟩`. This is consistent.\n*   `U|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|+⟩ + i|-⟩) = (1/2)((1+i)|0⟩ + (1-i)|1⟩)`. The table says `|i⟩ -> |-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`. These two resulting vectors are proportional (related by a phase factor `k = (1-i)/√2`), so this is a valid transformation.\n*   `U|-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|+⟩ - i|-⟩) = (1/2)((1-i)|0⟩ + (1+i)|1⟩)`. The table says `|-i⟩ -> |i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`. These are also proportional (related by a phase factor `k' = (1+i)/√2`).\nSince all transformations in C are consistent with the action of a single unitary operator (the Hadamard gate) up to a phase, option C represents a possible quantum operation.\n\nThe inconsistency found in option F makes it the impossible transformation.\n\n<<<F>>>"
