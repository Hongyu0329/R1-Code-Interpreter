    "There is one Cysteine residue located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 homomeric receptor.\n\nThe human GABAAρ1 receptor, encoded by the *GABRR1* gene, has the UniProt accession number P24046. Like other Cys-loop receptors, it possesses four transmembrane (TM) domains. The large intracellular loop connecting the third (TM3) and fourth (TM4) transmembrane domains is a significant feature of these receptor subunits.\n\nBased on the protein sequence and domain annotations from the UniProt database, the transmembrane domains of the human GABAAρ1 receptor are located at approximately amino acid positions 281-301 (TM1), 314-334 (TM2), 341-361 (TM3), and 453-473 (TM4). The TM3-TM4 linker, therefore, spans from residue 362 to 452.\n\nAnalysis of the amino acid sequence for this specific region reveals the presence of a single Cysteine (C) residue at position 379.\n\n<<<1>>>"
