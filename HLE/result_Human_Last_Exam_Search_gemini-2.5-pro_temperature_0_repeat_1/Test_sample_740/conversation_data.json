    "Answering the question requires analyzing the given integral equation, which is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind.\n\nThe equation is:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.\n\nFirst, we simplify the kernel of the integral, K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y). This is the sum of a geometric series:\nK(x, y) = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k\n\nSubstituting this into the equation gives:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy [∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k] u(y)\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy\n\nLet's define the moments c_k as:\nc_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy, for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nThen the expression for u(x) becomes:\nu(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)\n\nThis shows that any solution u(x) must be a polynomial in x of degree at most n-1. We can now use this form of u(x) to find a system of equations for the coefficients c_k.\n\nSubstitute the expression for u(y) into the definition of c_i:\nc_i = ∫₀¹ y^i u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^i [1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)] dy\nc_i = ∫₀¹ y^i dy + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(i + n - 1 - k) dy\nc_i = [y^(i+1) / (i+1)]₀¹ + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k [y^(i + n - k) / (i + n - k)]₀¹\nc_i = 1/(i+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (i + n - k)\n\nThis is a system of n linear equations for the n unknown moments c_0, c_1, ..., c_(n-1). We can write this in matrix form. Let C be the column vector of the moments [c_0, ..., c_(n-1)]^T, and B be the column vector [1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]^T. The system is:\nC = B + λMC\nwhere M is an n x n matrix with entries M_ik = 1 / (i + n - k) for i, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\nRearranging the system, we get:\n(I - λM)C = B\n\nAccording to the theory of linear equations, this system has:\n1.  A unique solution for C if the matrix (I - λM) is invertible, i.e., det(I - λM) ≠ 0.\n2.  No solution or infinitely many solutions if the matrix is singular, i.e., det(I - λM) = 0.\n\nThe condition det(I - λM) = 0 means that 1 is an eigenvalue of the matrix λM, which implies that 1/λ is an eigenvalue of the matrix M. Let μ be an eigenvalue of M. Then the critical values of λ are λ = 1/μ.\n\nFor these values of λ, the equation has no solution if the vector B is not in the column space of the matrix (I - λM). This is the case of an inconsistent system.\n\nLet's analyze this condition. The integral operator L[u](x) = ∫₀¹ K(x,y)u(y)dy is self-adjoint since its kernel K(x,y) is symmetric in x and y. This implies that its eigenvalues μ are real. The Fredholm alternative theorem states that for λ = 1/μ, the inhomogeneous equation u = f + λLu (with f=1 here) has a solution if and only if the function f is orthogonal to the null space of the operator (I - λL*), where L* is the adjoint operator. Since L is self-adjoint, L*=L.\nThe condition for a solution to exist is ∫₀¹ f(x)v(x)dx = 0 for all eigenfunctions v(x) corresponding to λ. Here f(x)=1. So, a solution exists if ∫₀¹ v(x)dx = 0.\n\nConversely, the equation has **no solution** if λ is a characteristic value (λ=1/μ) and for the corresponding eigenfunction v(x), we have ∫₀¹ v(x)dx ≠ 0.\n\nLet's check this condition. An eigenfunction v(x) satisfies v = λLv.\n∫₀¹ v(x)dx = λ ∫₀¹ L[v](x)dx = λ ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ K(x,y)v(y)dydx\n= λ ∫₀¹ v(y) [∫₀¹ K(x,y)dx] dy\nThe integral in the bracket is G(y) = ∫₀¹ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k)y^k dx = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) y^k/(n-k).\nSo, ∫₀¹ v(x)dx = λ ∫₀¹ v(y)G(y)dy.\nThe integral is zero if v(y) is orthogonal to G(y).\n\nFor n=1, the matrix M is, so μ=1 and λ=1. The eigenfunction is any constant v(x)=c. The integral ∫₀¹ c dx = c ≠ 0. Thus, for λ=1, there is no solution.\n\nFor n=2, the matrix is M = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]. The characteristic equation is det(M-μI) = (1/2-μ)² - 1/3 = 0, which gives μ = 1/2 ± 1/√3. The corresponding values of λ are λ = 1/μ = -6 ± 4√3. The eigenfunctions can be found to be v(x) = x + 1/λ - 1/2. The integral is ∫₀¹ v(x)dx = 1/λ, which is non-zero. Therefore, for λ = -6 ± 4√3, there are no solutions.\n\nIn the general case, it can be shown that the condition ∫₀¹ v(x)dx ≠ 0 holds for all eigenfunctions. Thus, the equation has no solution for any value of λ that is a reciprocal of an eigenvalue of the matrix M.\n\nThe values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix M defined by:\nM_ik = 1 / (n + i - k) for i, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix M with entries M_ik = 1/(n + i - k), where i and k range from 0 to n-1.>>>"
