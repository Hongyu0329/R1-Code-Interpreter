Yes, the theory can fail because the birefringent medium alters the polarization state of the light. A standard transmission matrix is often scalar and does not account for polarization changes. Therefore, the inverse of this matrix cannot correctly reverse the process for a polarization-altered beam. To overcome this, a more complex vectorial transmission matrix would be needed, but its practical implementation is challenging.
