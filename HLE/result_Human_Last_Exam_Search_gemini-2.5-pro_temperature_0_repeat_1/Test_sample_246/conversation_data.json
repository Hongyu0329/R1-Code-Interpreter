    "The minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil is 2.\n\nTo determine this, one must first find a presentation for the fundamental group of the manifold in question. The trefoil knot group can be presented as $\\langle x, y \\mid x^2 = y^3 \\rangle$. The fundamental group of the complement of the 5-twist-spun trefoil is then found, and from this, the group of the double branched cover is derived. This process involves adding a relation that corresponds to the two-fold nature of the cover.\n\nThe resulting fundamental group, let's call it $G$, has the following presentation:\n$G = \\langle y, t \\mid y^3=1, t^{10}=1, yt^2=t^2y \\rangle$.\n\nTo find the minimal number of generators for this group, we can analyze its structure. The group $G$ has a normal subgroup $C = \\langle t^2 \\rangle$, which is isomorphic to the cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_5$. The quotient group $G/C$ can be shown to have the presentation $\\langle \\bar{y}, \\bar{t} \\mid \\bar{y}^3=1, \\bar{t}^2=1 \\rangle$. This is the free product of a cyclic group of order 3 and a cyclic group of order 2, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}_3 * \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe group $\\mathbb{Z}_3 * \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is famously isomorphic to the modular group $PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, which is a non-abelian infinite group. The minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z}_3 * \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is 2. Since this group is a quotient of $G$, the minimal number of generators for $G$ must be at least 2. Given that the presentation for $G$ has two generators, $y$ and $t$, the minimal number of generators is exactly 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
