The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther.\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (Petit Bourgeois by the Radio), is a notable work of the New Objectivity movement. It depicts a man, identified as a certain Mr. Schreck who was a paraplegic and lived in the same house as Günther, listening to the radio.
