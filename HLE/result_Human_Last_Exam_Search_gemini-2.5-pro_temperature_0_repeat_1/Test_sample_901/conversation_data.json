    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The major product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reaction:\n*   **Reactants**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Reaction Type**: The conditions—a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base—strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) mechanism.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (bromine) and the hydrogen atom being removed must be in an anti-periplanar (or trans-diaxial) arrangement. In the more stable chair conformation of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, the larger methyl group occupies the equatorial position, which forces the bromine atom into the axial position. This axial orientation of the bromine is required for the E2 reaction to proceed.\n*   **Regioselectivity (Hofmann vs. Zaitsev)**: With the bromine in the axial position, there are two adjacent carbons with axial hydrogens that can be removed: one at C2 and one at C6.\n    *   Removal of the hydrogen at C2 would lead to the more substituted alkene, **1-methylcyclohexene** (the Zaitsev product).\n    *   Removal of a hydrogen at C6 would lead to the less substituted alkene, **3-methylcyclohexene** (the Hofmann product).\n*   **Effect of the Bulky Base**: Potassium tert-butoxide is a large, bulky base. Due to steric hindrance, it is easier for the base to access the less hindered proton on C6 than the more hindered proton on C2 (which is on the same carbon as the methyl group). Therefore, the reaction preferentially forms the less substituted alkene.\n\nThis preference for the formation of the less substituted alkene when using a bulky base is known as the **Hofmann rule**. Thus, the major product is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
