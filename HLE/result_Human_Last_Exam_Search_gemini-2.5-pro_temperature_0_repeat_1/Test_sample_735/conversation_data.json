    "A maximal by inclusion product-free set is a non-empty set of elements in a group where no product of two elements from the set is also in the set, and it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. A comprehensive classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by Chimere Stanley Anabanti and Sarah Hart.\n\nTheir research demonstrates that any finite group containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 must have an order of 24 or less. By examining all groups up to this order, they compiled a complete list of the 30 distinct finite groups that possess this property.\n\nThe 30 finite groups are:\n*   **Cyclic Groups:** C₅, C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₂, C₁₃, C₁₅, C₁₆, C₁₈, C₂₀, C₂₁, C₂₂, and C₂₄.\n*   **Dihedral Groups:** D₆ (isomorphic to S₃), D₁₀, D₁₂, D₁₄, D₁₆, D₁₈, D₂₀, and D₂₂.\n*   **Quaternion and Dicyclic Groups:** Q₈ (quaternion group), Q₁₆ (generalized quaternion group), and Q₂₀ (dicyclic group of order 20).\n*   **Other Groups:**\n    *   A₄ (the alternating group on 4 elements)\n    *   A group of order 16 with the structure (C₄ × C₂) ⋊ C₂\n    *   S₃ × C₃ (the direct product of the symmetric group on 3 elements and the cyclic group of order 3)\n    *   SL(2,3) (the special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field with 3 elements)\n\nTherefore, there are a total of 30 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\n<<<30>>>"
