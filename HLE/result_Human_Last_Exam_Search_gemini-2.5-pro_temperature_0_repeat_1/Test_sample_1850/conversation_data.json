    "John Miltonâ€™s epic poem *Paradise Lost* mentions by name five individuals who are considered historical saints in various Christian traditions. These figures are the archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel, as well as the patriarch Enoch.\n\nThe archangels are significant characters in the poem's narrative. Michael leads the heavenly army against Satan's forces and later reveals the future of mankind to Adam. Gabriel is a chief of the angelic guards in Paradise. Raphael is sent by God to warn Adam about Satan. Uriel, the \"Regent of the Sun,\" is tricked by Satan, who is disguised as a cherub. All four of these archangels are venerated as saints in different Christian denominations. Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael are recognized as saints in the Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican traditions. Uriel is also considered a saint in Anglican and Eastern Orthodox churches.\n\nIn Book 11 of *Paradise Lost*, the biblical patriarch Enoch is explicitly named. He is presented to Adam in a vision as a righteous man who \"was translated\" by God for his virtue in a corrupt world. Enoch is venerated as a saint in several Christian traditions, including the Eastern Orthodox and Armenian Apostolic Churches.\n\nWhile the term \"translated Saints\" is used in Book 3, the individuals, such as Elijah, are not mentioned by name in that section of the poem. Therefore, based on named individuals within *Paradise Lost*, the total count is five.\n\n<<<5>>>"
