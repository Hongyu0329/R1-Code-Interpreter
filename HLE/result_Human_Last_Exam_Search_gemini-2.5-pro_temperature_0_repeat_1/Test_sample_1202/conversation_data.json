    "When a gene is duplicated in a eukaryotic genome, it can have several fates. The most common outcome is that one copy becomes non-functional through the accumulation of mutations, a process called pseudogenization. However, several mechanisms can lead to the retention and divergence of both gene copies, providing raw material for evolutionary innovation.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the potential mechanisms and their likelihood:\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization:** This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns. After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that inactivate different subfunctions. As a result, both copies become necessary to perform the complete set of the original gene's functions, ensuring their mutual preservation. This process is considered a highly plausible and common mechanism for retaining duplicate genes because it can occur through neutral, degenerative mutations, which are more frequent than beneficial ones.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization:** In this scenario, one of the duplicated genes retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy is free from selective pressure and accumulates mutations that may lead to a completely new, beneficial function. While this is a key source of evolutionary novelty, it requires the rare occurrence of a beneficial mutation before the redundant gene copy is lost to pseudogenization. Some studies in specific lineages like *Drosophila* suggest neofunctionalization is the predominant mechanism for retaining young duplicate genes.\n\n*   **Gene Conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer where one gene sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them identical. Gene conversion acts to homogenize duplicated genes, thereby preventing, rather than promoting, their divergence.\n\n*   **Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a gene duplicate becomes a non-functional pseudogene. While this is the most frequent fate for a duplicated gene, it represents the *loss* of a functional copy, not the retention and divergence of two functional copies.\n\n*   **Adaptive Radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a species into multiple new forms. It is not a molecular mechanism that operates at the level of individual genes to ensure their retention.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. However, subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely initial step for preserving duplicates. It provides a neutral pathway for keeping both copies active in the genome, which can then create an opportunity for one copy to later evolve a new function (neofunctionalization). Therefore, subfunctionalization acts as a crucial transition state that increases the preservation of duplicated genes, which may eventually be neofunctionalized.\n\nGiven the options, subfunctionalization represents a highly probable and widely supported mechanism for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
