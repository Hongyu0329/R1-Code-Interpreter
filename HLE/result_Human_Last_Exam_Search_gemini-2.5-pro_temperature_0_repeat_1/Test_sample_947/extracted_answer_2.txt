The expression for the magnetic field `H = (Hx, Hz)` for `Ha > H0` and `|x| >> w` is given by:

`Hx(x, z) ≈ C * (cosh(2πx/D) * cos(2πz/D)) / (cosh^2(2πx/D) - sin^2(2πz/D))`

`Hz(x, z) ≈ Ha + C * (sinh(2πx/D) * sin(2πz/D)) / (cosh^2(2πx/D) - sin^2(2πz/D))`

where:
*   `C = (Jc*d / 2π) * (cosh(2πa/D) - cosh(2πw/D))`
*   `Jc` is the critical current density.
*   `d` is the strip thickness.
*   `2w` is the strip width.
*   `D` is the stacking interval.
*   `Ha` is the applied magnetic field.
*   `a` is the flux penetration depth, related to `Ha` by:
    `sinh(πa/D) = sinh(πw/D) * tanh(π*Ha / (Jc*d))`
