The one-step transformation of the probability distribution is given by $P_{t+1}(i) = p \cdot P_t(i-1) + q \cdot P_t(i+1)$, where indices are modulo N. The transition probability matrix $\hat{A}$ is a circulant matrix with $A_{i, i-1} = p$ and $A_{i, i+1} = q$ (with wrap-around for the edges). The eigenvectors are of the form $v_n$ with components $(v_n)_j = e^{ijk_n}$ where $k_n = 2\pi n/N$ for $n=0, 1, \dots, N-1$. The corresponding eigenvalues are $\lambda_n = \cos(k_n) + i(q-p)\sin(k_n)$. The largest eigenvalue is $\lambda_0 = 1$. The second-largest eigenvalue in magnitude is $|\lambda_1| = |\lambda_{N-1}| = \sqrt{1 - 4pq\sin^2(2\pi/N)}$. The rate of relaxation is determined by this second-largest eigenvalue; a smaller magnitude implies a faster relaxation to the stationary distribution.
