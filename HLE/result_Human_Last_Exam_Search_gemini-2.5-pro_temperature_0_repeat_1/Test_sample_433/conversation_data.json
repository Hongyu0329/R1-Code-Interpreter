    "### Opened Single-Dose Ampules Must Be Used Immediately\n\n**Once a single-dose ampule is opened, it must be used immediately and cannot be stored for any period of time.** This is a critical guideline from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) to ensure patient safety and the sterility of the medication.\n\nAn ampule is a sealed glass container that is broken open, and once opened, it cannot be resealed. This open state exposes the contents to the surrounding environment, making it susceptible to microbial contamination. Therefore, to prevent any risk of contamination, the contents must be used for a single procedure on a single patient right away.\n\nWhile regulations for single-dose *vials* (which have a rubber stopper that can be punctured multiple times) have evolved, allowing for a Beyond-Use Date (BUD) of up to 12 hours after the initial puncture in a sterile environment like an ISO Class 5 cleanroom, these rules do not apply to ampules. The guidance for opened single-dose ampules is unequivocal: they are not to be stored.\n\nFor immediate-use compounded sterile preparations (CSPs), any unused starting component from a single-dose container, such as an ampule, must be discarded after the preparation for an individual patient is complete.\n\n<<<Opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any time period and must be used immediately.>>>"
