    "The rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface can range from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 10. This range is determined by the properties of the Jacobian variety of the specific Riemann surface in question.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of how these values are determined:\n\n### Relationship between the Symmetric Power and the Jacobian\n\nLet `C` be a genus 3 Riemann surface and `X = Sym^15(C)` be its 15th symmetric power. The Néron-Severi group of a variety `V` is denoted by `NS(V)`, and its rank by `ρ(V)`.\n\n1.  **The Abel-Jacobi Map**: For a curve `C` of genus `g` and its `d`-th symmetric power `Sym^d(C)`, there is a map called the Abel-Jacobi map to its Jacobian variety, `Jac(C)`.\n2.  **Projective Bundle Structure**: When the degree `d` is sufficiently large, specifically `d ≥ 2g - 1`, the symmetric power `Sym^d(C)` has the structure of a projective bundle over the Jacobian `Jac(C)`.\n3.  **Calculating the Ranks**: In this case, with `g = 3` and `d = 15`, the condition `15 ≥ 2*3 - 1 = 5` is satisfied. `X = Sym^15(C)` is a `P^12`-bundle over `Jac(C)`. For such a projective bundle structure, the rank of the Néron-Severi group is given by the formula:\n    `ρ(X) = ρ(Jac(C)) + 1`.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension `g` is always at least 1.\n*   For a \"very general\" curve `C` of genus 3, its Jacobian `Jac(C)` is a simple abelian variety with the smallest possible endomorphism ring, `End(Jac(C)) = Z`.\n*   In this case, the Néron-Severi group `NS(Jac(C))` has the minimum possible rank, which is `ρ(Jac(C)) = 1`.\n\nThis leads to the smallest possible rank for `X`:\n`ρ_min(X) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of a `g`-dimensional abelian variety is bounded by `g^2`. For the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, this means `ρ(Jac(C)) ≤ 3^2 = 9`.\n\n*   This maximum rank is achieved for curves whose Jacobian has complex multiplication (CM) of a specific type. This occurs when `Jac(C)` is isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with CM, i.e., `Jac(C) ≈ E^3`.\n*   A well-known example of such a curve is the **Fermat quartic curve**, defined by the equation `X^4 + Y^4 = Z^4`. This is a smooth curve of genus `(4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3`.\n*   The Jacobian of the Fermat quartic is isogenous to the cube of the elliptic curve `y^2 = x^3 - x`, which has complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers `Z[i]`.\n*   For this curve, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian is maximal: `ρ(Jac(C)) = 9`.\n\nThis gives the largest possible rank for `X`:\n`ρ_max(X) = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\nIn summary, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of `X = Sym^15(C)` depends on the nature of the genus 3 curve `C`. For a very general curve, the rank is at its minimum, while for special curves like the Fermat quartic, it reaches its maximum.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is **2**.\nThe largest possible rank is **10**.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
