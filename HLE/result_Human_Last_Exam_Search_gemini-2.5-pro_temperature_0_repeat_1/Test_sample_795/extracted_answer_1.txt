The analytical expression for the initial magnetization curve of the superconducting bar in the limit b<<a is given by:

*   For an applied field H in the range **0 ≤ H ≤ Jc*b**:
    **M(H) = -H * (1 - H / (2 * Jc * b))**

*   For an applied field H greater than Jc*b (**H > Jc*b**):
    **M(H) = - (Jc * b) / 2**

Here, M is the magnetization, H is the applied magnetic field, Jc is the constant critical-current density, and 2b is the thickness of the bar in the direction of the applied field. The expression shows that the magnetization initially decreases with a slope of -1, characteristic of perfect diamagnetism, and then curves upwards until it reaches a constant saturation value at the full penetration field, H = Jc*b.
