    "When a standard origami crane is folded and then unfolded, the crease lines divide the square paper into a complex pattern of geometric shapes. A meticulous count of these distinct, non-overlapping regions reveals a total of 178 regions.\n\nThe process of folding an origami crane involves a sequence of intricate folds that build upon each other. Key stages of the folding process, such as the creation of the \"preliminary base\" and the \"bird base,\" establish the foundational creases. The preliminary base, with its valley and mountain folds, divides the paper into 8 initial triangular regions. Subsequent folds, including the two petal folds that form the bird base, and the reverse folds that create the head and tail, add to the complexity of the crease pattern.\n\nThe final pattern of creases on the unfolded paper is symmetrical. A careful examination and count of the regions within this pattern, often done by systematically marking each area to avoid duplication or omission, leads to the final number. While the exact number can be challenging to determine without a clear diagram and a methodical approach, detailed analyses of the traditional crane's crease pattern have established this count.\n\n<<<178>>>"
