    "The value computed between heartbeats, based on beat-to-beat intervals captured with photoplethysmography (PPG), is called the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)** or, more specifically, the **Inter-Pulse Interval (IPI)**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terminology:\n*   **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI):** This is a general term for the time duration between consecutive heartbeats. It's widely used regardless of the measurement technology.\n*   **Inter-Pulse Interval (IPI) or Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PP):** Since PPG measures the pulse wave of blood volume changes, this is a more specific and accurate term for the interval between consecutive pulse wave peaks.\n*   **R-R Interval:** This term is used specifically when measuring the heart's electrical activity with an electrocardiogram (ECG). It refers to the interval between two successive R-waves, which are the most prominent peaks in an ECG signal.\n\nWhile IBI is a correct and commonly used term for PPG-derived data, IPI is more precise to the technology used. HRV itself is the analysis of the variation in these successive intervals.\n\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI) or Inter-Pulse Interval (IPI)>>>"
