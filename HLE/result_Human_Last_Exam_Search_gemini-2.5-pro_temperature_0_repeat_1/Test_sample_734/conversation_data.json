    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nAugustine (354–430 AD) was the first major theologian to systematically articulate a distinction between the operation of nature before and after the Fall of Man. He developed the concept of a **\"prelapsarian state\"** to describe the world and human nature before sin entered it. In this original state, the laws of nature functioned in perfect harmony with God's will and human reason.\n\n**Application to the Fall:**\nAugustine argued that the Fall fundamentally altered the state of nature and humanity. Before the Fall, for instance, he posited that procreation would have been a rational act, with the reproductive organs under the direct control of the will, free from lust. After the Fall, this harmony was broken, leading to \"concupiscence\"—the rebellion of the body's desires against the mind—and introducing phenomena like pain in childbirth, which he saw as consequences of sin altering the original natural order. This framework describes a systemic change in how natural laws operate, particularly in relation to human beings.\n\n**Application to the Virgin Birth:**\nAugustine's understanding of the prelapsarian state provides the context for his view of miracles. He argued that an event like the virgin birth is contrary to the *current* course of nature, the nature that exists after the Fall. He saw it as a miraculous divine intervention, restoring a measure of the creative power that operated outside the now-degraded laws of procreation. In his work *Against Faustus*, he defends the virgin birth as a miraculous event, distinct from the normal, post-Fall course of nature.\n\nWhile later theologians like Thomas Aquinas would develop more intricate philosophical language, such as the distinction between **primary and secondary causes**, to explain how God could act outside the laws of nature without violating them, it was Augustine who first established the foundational theological terminology of a \"prelapsarian\" state. This concept specifically describes a *change* in the natural order itself due to the Fall, providing a framework applicable to both systemic alterations and specific miracles like the virgin birth.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
