A single-site catalyst composed of a Zirconium or Hafnium organometallic precursor supported on sulfated alumina (AlS) is the optimal combination. This system is capable of both efficient olefin polymerization and polyolefin hydrogenolysis, with the function being switchable based on the presence of either olefin monomers or hydrogen gas.
