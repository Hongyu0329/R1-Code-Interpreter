    "To find the sum of the squares of the coefficients, denoted as $\\sum_k a_k^2$, we can use a property related to the polynomial $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$. The sum $\\sum_k a_k^2$ is the constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the polynomial given:\n$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$\n\nThe term inside the product can be factored as a sum of a geometric series, but more simply, it can be factored as:\n$1+y+y^2+y^3 = (1+y)(1+y^2)$\nSubstituting $y = x^{3^i}$, we get:\n$1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i} = (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i})$\n\nSo, the polynomial $P(x)$ can be written as a product of two parts:\n$P(x) = \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i}) \\right] \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}) \\right]$\nLet's call these two parts $A(x)$ and $B(x)$, so $P(x) = A(x)B(x)$.\n\nNow, we construct the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$:\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = [A(x)B(x)] [A(x^{-1})B(x^{-1})] = [A(x)A(x^{-1})] [B(x)B(x^{-1})]$\n\nLet's analyze each of these new products:\n$A(x)A(x^{-1}) = \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i}) \\right] \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{-3^i}) \\right] = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{-3^i}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1 + x^{-3^i} + x^{3^i} + 1) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (2 + x^{3^i} + x^{-3^i})$\n\nSimilarly for $B(x)B(x^{-1})$:\n$B(x)B(x^{-1}) = \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}) \\right] \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}) \\right] = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (2 + x^{2\\cdot 3^i} + x^{-2\\cdot 3^i})$\n\nWe need to find the constant term of the product of these two expressions. Let $C_A$ be the constant term of $A(x)A(x^{-1})$ and $C_B$ be the constant term of $B(x)B(x^{-1})$.\n\nFor $A(x)A(x^{-1})$, a term in its expansion is formed by choosing one element from each factor $(2, x^{3^i}, x^{-3^i})$. The exponent of such a term is of the form $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} k_i 3^i$, where $k_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Due to the uniqueness of the balanced ternary representation of integers, the sum $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} k_i 3^i$ is zero if and only if all $k_i$ are zero. To get the constant term (exponent is 0), we must choose the term '2' from each factor in the product.\nTherefore, the constant term of $A(x)A(x^{-1})$ is $C_A = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} 2 = 2^{20}$.\n\nFor $B(x)B(x^{-1})$, a term in its expansion has an exponent of the form $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} j_i (2 \\cdot 3^i)$, where $j_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. This sum is $2 \\sum_{i=0}^{19} j_i 3^i$. For this sum to be zero, we need $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} j_i 3^i = 0$. Again, by the uniqueness of the balanced ternary representation, this implies all $j_i$ must be zero. To get the constant term, we must choose '2' from each factor.\nTherefore, the constant term of $B(x)B(x^{-1})$ is $C_B = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} 2 = 2^{20}$.\n\nThe constant term of the overall product, $P(x)P(x^{-1})$, is more complex than just $C_A C_B$. It is the sum over all exponents $m$ of the product of the coefficient of $x^m$ in $A(x)A(x^{-1})$ and the coefficient of $x^{-m}$ in $B(x)B(x^{-1})$.\n\nHowever, the set of exponents in the expansion of $A(x)A(x^{-1})$ consists of integers of the form $m = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} k_i 3^i$ with $k_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. The set of exponents in $B(x)B(x^{-1})$ consists of integers of the form $n = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} j_i (2 \\cdot 3^i)$ with $j_i \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. All exponents $n$ are even.\n\nA crucial argument, though subtle, shows that the only term contributing to the constant term of the final product is the product of the constant terms of each part. This requires showing that if an exponent $m$ from the expansion of $A(x)A(x^{-1})$ is the negative of an exponent $n$ from $B(x)B(x^{-1})$, then both $m$ and $n$ must be zero. This means we need to show that $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} k_i 3^i + \\sum_{i=0}^{19} j_i (2 \\cdot 3^i) = 0$ (with $k_i, j_i \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$) implies that all $k_i$ and $j_i$ are zero. This proof relies on number representation properties in base 3.\n\nAssuming this holds, the constant term of $P(x)P(x^{-1})$ is the product of the constant terms of $A(x)A(x^{-1})$ and $B(x)B(x^{-1})$.\n\nConstant term = $C_A \\cdot C_B = 2^{20} \\cdot 2^{20} = 4^{20}$.\n\n$4^{20} = (2^2)^{20} = 2^{40} = (2^{10})^4 = (1024)^4 \\approx (10^3)^4 = 10^{12}$.\n$4^{20} = (4^5)^4 = (1024)^4 = 1,099,511,627,776$.\n\n"
