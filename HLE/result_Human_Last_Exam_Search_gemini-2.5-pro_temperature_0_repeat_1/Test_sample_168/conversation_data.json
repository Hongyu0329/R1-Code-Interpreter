    "To determine which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches, we need to consider the frequency of sound produced by muscle contractions and compare it to the hearing ranges of the animals listed.\n\nHuman muscle twitches, or fasciculations, are minor, involuntary muscle contractions. The sounds produced by these contractions, known as mechanomyography (MMG), are of a very low frequency. Studies on muscle responses to stimuli show significant activity in the 10-80 Hz range. Some studies on muscle fatigue use stimulus frequencies of 15 Hz and 30 Hz.\n\nNow let's examine the hearing capabilities of the animals in the answer choices:\n\n*   **A. Dog:** A dog's hearing range is typically between 67 Hz and 45,000 Hz. While they can hear much higher frequencies than humans, their low-frequency hearing is not as sensitive and generally doesn't extend as low as other animals on this list.\n*   **B. Bat:** Bats are specialists in high-frequency hearing (ultrasound), which they use for echolocation. Their hearing can extend up to 200,000 Hz. However, their low-frequency hearing is limited; most bats cannot hear well below 1,000 Hz.\n*   **C. Herring:** The herring family has a specialized swim bladder connected to their inner ear, giving them very sensitive hearing. They can detect a wide range of frequencies. Studies show that herring have a low hearing threshold for frequencies between 30 and 1,200 Hz. Furthermore, they are sensitive to infrasonic sound pressure down to 5 Hz, which can trigger escape responses. This exceptional low-frequency sensitivity makes it plausible that they could detect the faint, low-frequency sounds of muscle contractions.\n*   **D. Whale:** Baleen whales, such as blue whales, are experts at hearing very low-frequency, infrasonic sounds, which they use to communicate over vast ocean distances. Some whales can hear sounds as low as 7 Hz or 16 Hz. While they possess the necessary low-frequency hearing, the context of hearing a human muscle twitch (which would typically occur in the air) makes this less direct than the herring's known predator-detection capabilities in water.\n*   **E. Human:** The standard hearing range for a healthy human is 20 to 20,000 Hz. The low-frequency sounds from muscle twitches are at the very edge or below this range, making them generally inaudible to humans.\n\nBased on this information, the herring is the most likely animal on the list to be able to detect the low-frequency sounds produced by muscle twitches due to its specialized and highly sensitive low-frequency hearing.\n\n<<<C>>>"
