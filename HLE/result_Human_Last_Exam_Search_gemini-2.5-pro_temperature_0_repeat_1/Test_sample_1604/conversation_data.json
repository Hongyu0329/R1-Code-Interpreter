    "The latest battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, which occurred on February 26, 1916. This event took place during the First World War in the Western Desert of Egypt.\n\nLady Butler, a renowned British battle artist, was commissioned to create the painting titled *The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia, 26 February 1916* to commemorate the charge. The painting captures the Dorset Yeomanry on horseback charging with drawn swords against Senussi tribesmen who were supported by Turkish and German officers. This charge was a decisive moment in the action at Agagia, leading to a British victory and helping to secure the Suez Canal from the threat posed by the Central Powers and their allies in the region.\n\nA chronological list of some of Lady Butler's other notable battle paintings and the historical events they depict further highlights that the engagement at Agagia is the most recent:\n\n*   ***Steady the Drums and Fifes***: Depicts the Battle of Albuera on May 16, 1811, during the Peninsular War.\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras***: Shows the Battle of Quatre Bras on June 16, 1815, part of the Waterloo campaign.\n*   ***Scotland Forever!***: Portrays the charge of the Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815.\n*   ***The Remnants of an Army***: Depicts the arrival of Assistant Surgeon William Brydon at Jalalabad on January 13, 1842, as the sole survivor of the retreat from Kabul during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n*   ***Balaclava***: Illustrates the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava on October 25, 1854, during the Crimean War.\n*   ***The Return from Inkerman***: Shows soldiers after the Battle of Inkerman, which was fought on November 5, 1854.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift***: Represents the battle at Rorke's Drift on January 22-23, 1879, during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!***: Depicts the Battle of Laing's Nek on January 28, 1881, during the First Boer War.\n*   ***After the Battle: Arrival of Lord Wolseley and Staff at the Bridge of Tel-el-Kebir***: Set after the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir on September 13, 1882, in the Anglo-Egyptian War.\n*   ***The Royal Horse Guards Retreat from Mons, 1914***: Portrays the retreat of the British Expeditionary Force after the Battle of Mons, which began on August 23, 1914.\n\n<<<The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia>>>"
