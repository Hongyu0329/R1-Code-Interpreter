    "Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts a six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon molecules of pyruvate. This process consists of ten reactions and does not involve the loss of any carbon atoms. Therefore, no carbon dioxide (CO2) is released during glycolysis.\n\nSince no CO2 is produced during the process of glycolysis, no 13C-labeled CO2 molecules will be released.\n\nIt is in the subsequent step, called pyruvate oxidation or the link reaction, that CO2 is first produced. In this step, each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA, releasing one molecule of CO2. Following the carbon atoms from 1,4-13C glucose:\n*   The C1 of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of one pyruvate molecule.\n*   The C4 of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the other pyruvate molecule.\n\nWhen these pyruvate molecules undergo oxidation, the carboxyl carbon is the one that is released as CO2. Consequently, one molecule of 13C-labeled CO2 would be released from the pyruvate that originated from C4 of glucose. However, this occurs after glycolysis.\n\n<<<0>>>"
