    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would likely be **suster**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" shows the influence of the Old Norse word \"systir\". This Norse form, with its \"i\" vowel sound, eventually replaced the native Old English terms.\n\nThe original Old English words for a female sibling were \"sweostor\" and \"swuster\". \"Swuster\" was a variant, particularly in the Late West Saxon dialect. In Middle English, before the Norse-influenced \"sister\" became standard, the form \"suster\" was common.\n\nWithout the Scandinavian influence, the Old English \"swuster\" would have likely undergone a natural phonological evolution. The initial \"sw\" sound would have probably simplified to \"s\", and the short \"u\" sound would have evolved into the modern /ÊŒ/ sound, similar to the vowel sound in \"sun\" or \"cup\". The unstressed final syllable would have also weakened over time. This linguistic path would have resulted in the word \"suster,\" which was already a prominent form in Middle English. Therefore, \"suster\" is the most probable word we would use today.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
