    "The problem asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Čech remainder of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum, $X$, with one point, $x$, removed. Let $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. We are interested in the number of composants of the Stone-Čech remainder, $Y^* = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$.\n\nFirst, we identify the space $X$. A key example of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum is the **pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is not only hereditarily indecomposable but also homogeneous. Homogeneity implies that for any two points $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, there exists a homeomorphism $h: X \\to X$ such that $h(x_1) = x_2$. This means that the topological structure of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is independent of the choice of $x$. Therefore, we can consider $X$ to be the pseudo-arc without loss of generality.\n\nThe space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a non-compact, locally compact, and connected metric space. A crucial topological property of such a space is the number of its \"ends\". A space has one end if, for any compact subset $K \\subset Y$, the set $Y \\setminus K$ has exactly one unbounded connected component. Since $X$ is a continuum, for any compact $K \\subset Y$, the set $X \\setminus K$ is connected. As $x \\notin K$, it follows that $Y \\setminus K = (X \\setminus K) \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is also connected. This demonstrates that $Y$ has one end.\n\nThe prototypical example of a one-ended, non-compact, locally compact, connected metric space is the half-line, $H = [0, \\infty)$. It is a significant result in topology that for a broad class of spaces, including the one in question, the homeomorphism type of the Stone-Čech remainder is determined by the end structure of the space. Spaces like $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ and the half-line $H$ are proper-homotopy equivalent, which implies that their Stone-Čech remainders are homeomorphic. Thus, the number of composants of $Y^*$ is the same as the number of composants of the Stone-Čech remainder of the half-line, $H^* = \\beta H \\setminus H$.\n\nThe remainder $H^*$ is a well-studied, non-metrizable indecomposable continuum. The number of its composants is a deep question connected to set theory, specifically the theory of ultrafilters on the set of natural numbers, $\\omega$. The composants of $H^*$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the **cofinal types** (or **Tukey types**) of non-principal ultrafilters on $\\omega$.\n\nThe question of the number of cofinal types of ultrafilters is a subject of advanced set theory. The number of such types is not a fixed value within the standard axioms of set theory (ZFC) but depends on additional axioms.\n*   It is consistent with ZFC that there is only **one** composant. This is equivalent to the set-theoretic principle of Near Coherence of Filters (NCF).\n*   It is also consistent that there are other numbers of composants, such as two.\n\nThe question asks for the *maximum possible* number of composants. This corresponds to the maximum possible number of distinct cofinal types of ultrafilters on $\\omega$. The total number of ultrafilters on $\\omega$ is $2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$, where $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum. It has been shown to be consistent with ZFC that there are $2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$ pairwise cofinally non-equivalent directed sets of cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. The number of cofinal types of ultrafilters on $\\omega$ can consistently be this maximum possible value.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of cofinal types, and thus the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Čech remainder, is $2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$.\n\n<<<2^c>>>The problem asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Čech remainder of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum, $X$, with one point, $x$, removed.
