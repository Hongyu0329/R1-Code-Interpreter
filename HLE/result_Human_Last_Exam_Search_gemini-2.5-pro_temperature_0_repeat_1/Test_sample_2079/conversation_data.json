    "I am unable to provide the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.\n\nWhile historical records confirm the existence of a town judge (in Latin, *iudex*; in Slovak, *richtár*) in Bártfa during the 15th century, and references to this official in the year 1461 have been found, the specific name of the individual holding the position in that year is not available in the searched online resources.\n\nKey academic publications that likely contain this information have been identified, notably \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata: Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\" by Mária Fedorčáková and \"Bardejov v XV. storočí. Štúdie z dejín mesta\" by Stanisław Andrzej Sroka. These books are stated to contain lists of the town's judges from that period. However, the actual lists are not accessible through the available search tools.\n\nA documented incident in 1461 involved a dispute between the residents of Bardejov and the town of Nowy Sącz, where the judge and the town council of Bardejov were mentioned, but the judge was not named. Without access to the specific lists of judges in the aforementioned scholarly works, the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 cannot be definitively determined at this time.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer.>>>"
