The approximate number of non-Clifford gates required to run a simulation of the implementation of a universal quantum computer on a 2D surface code with a distance-3 code is in the range of 4 to 8. For the implementation of a universal quantum computer on a 2D surface code with a distance-5 code, assuming a faulty gate error rate of at most 1%, the number is estimated to be between 100 million and 1 trillion, depending on the specific large-scale algorithm used as a benchmark.
