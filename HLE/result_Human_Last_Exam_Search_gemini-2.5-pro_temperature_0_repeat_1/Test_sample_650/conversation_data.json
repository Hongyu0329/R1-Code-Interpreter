    "To determine the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`, we need to analyze the number of elementary operations performed as a function of the input size.\n\n### Algorithm Breakdown:\n\n**Input:** Integers `n` (n ≥ 0) and `c` (c ≥ 2).\n**Output:** The base `c` representation of `n`.\n\n**Step 1: Initialization**\n*   `i := 0;`\n*   `x := n;`\n*   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`\n*   `a₀ := x - qc;`\n\nThis step involves a fixed number of basic arithmetic operations (assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). Assuming these operations take constant time for the numbers involved, the complexity of this step is O(1).\n\n**Step 2: The `while` loop**\nThe loop continues as long as `q > 0`. Inside the loop, the following operations are performed in each iteration:\n*   `i := i + 1;`\n*   `x := q;`\n*   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`\n*   `aᵢ := x - qc;`\n\nSimilar to the initialization step, each iteration of the loop consists of a constant number of basic arithmetic operations. Therefore, the cost of a single iteration is O(1).\n\nThe crucial part is to determine how many times the loop executes. The loop variable `q` is repeatedly divided by `c`.\n*   Before the loop: `q = ⌊n/c⌋`\n*   After 1st iteration: `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, which is approximately `n/c²`.\n*   After `k` iterations: `q` is approximately `n/c^(k+1)`.\n\nThe loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `n/c^k < 1`, which is equivalent to `n < c^k`. To find the number of iterations `k`, we can take the logarithm to the base `c`:\n`log_c(n) < k`\n\nThe number of iterations is therefore proportional to `log_c(n)`. The number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n` is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. The loop runs `⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n\n**Step 3: Return**\n*   `return ((aᵢaᵢ₋₁, ..., a₁a₀))`\n\nThis step returns the computed digits. The number of digits is `i+1`, which is O(log_c(n)).\n\n### Complexity Calculation:\n\nThe total time complexity is the sum of the complexities of the steps:\n*   **Initialization:** O(1)\n*   **Loop:** (Number of iterations) × (Cost per iteration) = O(log_c(n)) × O(1) = O(log_c(n))\n*   **Return:** O(log_c(n))\n\nThe dominant term is O(log_c(n)). According to the change of base formula for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c` is a constant (c ≥ 2), `log(c)` is also a constant. Therefore, the complexity can be expressed as O(log n).\n\nThis analysis assumes that the arithmetic operations (division, multiplication) on numbers up to size `n` take constant time. In a more theoretical model where the cost of operations depends on the number of bits in the operands (let's say `k = log n`), a division can take more than constant time. For instance, long division of a k-bit number by a small constant is O(k). In this case, the complexity would be the number of iterations multiplied by the cost of division: O(log n) * O(log n) = O((log n)²). However, for typical computational models used in algorithm analysis where standard-sized integers are assumed to have O(1) arithmetic, the complexity is O(log n).\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
