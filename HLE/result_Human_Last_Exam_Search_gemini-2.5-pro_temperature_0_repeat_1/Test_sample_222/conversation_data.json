    "To find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the 8-point sequence {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}, we denote this sequence as y(n). The 4-point DFT of this 8-point sequence, Y(k), is determined by a process known as time-aliasing. This involves creating a 4-point sequence, z(n), by summing the first half and the second half of y(n).\n\nFirst, we define the 8-point sequence y(n):\n*   y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}\n\nThe aliased 4-point sequence z(n) is calculated as z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4) for n = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n*   z(0) = y(0) + y(4) = x(0) + x(2)\n*   z(1) = y(1) + y(5) = h(0) + h(2)\n*   z(2) = y(2) + y(6) = x(1) + x(3)\n*   z(3) = y(3) + y(7) = h(1) + h(3)\n\nTo find the values of z(n), we first need to determine the values of the sequences x(n) and h(n) by computing the Inverse DFT (IDFT) of the given X(k) and H(k).\n\nFor the sequence x(n) with X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j], the IDFT calculation yields:\n*   x(n) = {0, 0, 0, 1}\n\nFor the sequence h(n) with H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j], the IDFT calculation yields:\n*   h(n) = {0.75, -0.75, -0.25, 0.25}\n\nNow, we can compute the values for the aliased sequence z(n):\n*   z(0) = x(0) + x(2) = 0 + 0 = 0\n*   z(1) = h(0) + h(2) = 0.75 + (-0.25) = 0.5\n*   z(2) = x(1) + x(3) = 0 + 1 = 1\n*   z(3) = h(1) + h(3) = -0.75 + 0.25 = -0.5\n\nSo, the resulting 4-point sequence is z(n) = {0, 0.5, 1, -0.5}.\n\nFinally, we compute the 4-point DFT of z(n) to find the desired Y(k):\n*   Y(0) = 0 + 0.5 + 1 - 0.5 = 1\n*   Y(1) = 0 + 0.5(-j) + 1(-1) + (-0.5)(j) = -1 - j\n*   Y(2) = 0 + 0.5(-1) + 1(1) + (-0.5)(-1) = 1\n*   Y(3) = 0 + 0.5(j) + 1(-1) + (-0.5)(-j) = -1 + j\n\nThe 4-point DFT for the given sequence is Y(k) = {1, -1-j, 1, -1+j}.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
