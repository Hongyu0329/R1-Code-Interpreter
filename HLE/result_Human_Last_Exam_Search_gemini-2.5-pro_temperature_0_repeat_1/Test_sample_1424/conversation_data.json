    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, often denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is most clearly seen in the frequency-momentum representation. For a non-relativistic system of fermions at zero temperature, the bare Green's function G₀(k, ω) is given by:\n\n<br>\n***G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - (ϵ_k - μ) + iη)***\n<br>\n\nHere:\n*   **ω** represents the frequency.\n*   **k** is the momentum quantum number.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a particle with momentum k.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential, which at zero temperature is equal to the Fermi energy (E_F). The term ξ_k = ϵ_k - μ represents the single-particle energy measured relative to the Fermi energy.\n*   **η** is an infinitesimal real number that determines the analytic properties of the Green's function. Its sign depends on whether the state k is occupied or unoccupied. Specifically, η is a small positive number (0+) for states above the Fermi level (ϵ_k > μ) and a small negative number (0-) for states below the Fermi level (ϵ_k < μ). This can be expressed as iδ sign(ξ_k), where δ is a small positive infinitesimal.\n\nThis form of the Green's function has a simple pole in the complex frequency plane at ω = ϵ_k - μ. The location of this pole, and thus the behavior of the propagator, is directly determined by the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k.\n\nThe derivation of this expression involves the Fourier transform of the time-ordered Green's function. In the path integral formalism, G₀ is fundamentally the inverse of the operator that appears in the quadratic part of the action for the non-interacting system. For a non-relativistic particle, this operator in frequency-momentum space is precisely the denominator seen in the expression for G₀(k, ω)."
