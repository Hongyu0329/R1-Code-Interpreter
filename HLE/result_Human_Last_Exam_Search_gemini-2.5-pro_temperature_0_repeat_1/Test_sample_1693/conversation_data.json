    "The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the steam tanker **Monique**.\n\nThe *Monique*, with a displacement of 7,011 gross register tons, was sunk on June 22, 1940, in the Bay of Biscay by the German submarine U-65. The ship was en route from Haifa to Le Havre carrying a cargo of 10,000 tons of crude oil when it was torpedoed approximately 70 miles southwest of Penmarch. The vessel was engulfed in flames and broke in two before sinking.\n\nThe armistice between France and Germany was signed on the same day, June 22, 1940, but it did not come into effect until June 25, 1940. Therefore, the sinking of the *Monique* occurred within the specified timeframe.\n\nAnother notable French naval loss to a U-boat during this period was the submarine *Doris*, which was sunk by U-9 on May 8, 1940. However, the *Doris* had a much smaller displacement of 552 tons surfaced and 787 tons submerged.\n\nIt is worth noting that the French destroyer *Sirocco* was also sunk during this period, on May 31, 1940, during the Dunkirk evacuation. While a significant naval loss, it was sunk by German motor torpedo boats (S-boats), not a U-boat.\n\n<<<Monique>>>"
