    "For the BDF4 numerical scheme, the region of absolute stability is A($\\alpha$)-stable. This means that the sector ${z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha, z \\neq 0}$ is contained within the stability region of the method. The angle $\\alpha$ represents the largest such angle.\n\nThe exact value of this angle has been determined by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis. For the BDF4 method, the maximum angle of A($\\alpha$)-stability, denoted as $\\vartheta_4$ in their paper, is given by the relation:\n$\\tan(\\vartheta_4) = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2033} - 41}{2(85 + \\sqrt{2033})}$\n\nThis result provides the exact value for the tangent of the stability angle. Another paper by Gander and Wanner confirms the existence of an exact formula containing a single square root for this value.\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ (which is $\\vartheta_4$) in radians is given in terms of the arctan function as:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2033} - 41}{2(85 + \\sqrt{2033})}\\right)$\n\nNumerically, this angle is approximately 73.35 degrees.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{2033} - 41}{2(85 + \\sqrt{2033})}\\right)$>>>"
