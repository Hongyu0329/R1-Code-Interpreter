    "## The Dawn of Recorded Time in the Americas: An Olmec Seal Holds the Earliest Known Date\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is believed to be **approximately 650 BCE**. This date is found on a ceramic cylinder seal discovered at San Andrés, an Olmec site in the present-day Mexican state of Tabasco.\n\nThe seal bears a set of glyphs that have been interpreted by archaeologists as representing the date **\"3 Ajaw\"** in the 260-day sacred calendar used by various Mesoamerican cultures. The discovery is significant as it pushes back the evidence of a formal writing system and calendrical records in the Americas by several centuries. The artifacts, including the cylinder seal, were unearthed from a refuse dump associated with elite feasting rituals, suggesting that writing was a sacred practice tied to important ceremonial activities.\n\nWhile the San Andrés seal holds the distinction of the earliest potential date, it is important to note the context of other early writing systems in the region. The **Cascajal Block**, another Olmec artifact dated to around 900 BCE, is considered by many to be the oldest example of writing in the Americas. However, the script on the Cascajal Block is undeciphered and does not appear to contain any calendrical information.\n\nAnother significant early record comes from the **Zapotec civilization** in the Valley of Oaxaca. **Monument 3 at San José Mogote**, dated to around 600 BCE, features a carved relief of a captive with a glyph between his legs interpreted as his name, \"1 Motion\" or \"1 Earthquake,\" derived from his birthdate in the 260-day calendar. This makes him the earliest known named individual in the Americas. Furthermore, Stelae 12 and 13 from the Zapotec city of Monte Albán, dated to between 500 and 400 BCE, also display early calendrical inscriptions.\n\nLater, the **Maya civilization** would develop a highly sophisticated calendrical and writing system. The earliest known Maya calendar notation is the date \"7 Deer,\" found on mural fragments at San Bartolo, Guatemala, which have been dated to between 300 and 200 BCE.\n\nThe earliest recorded **Long Count** date, a more complex system of tracking time, is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, an Epi-Olmec site. This stela records a date corresponding to **36 BCE**.\n\nIn summary, while various pre-Columbian civilizations developed sophisticated writing and calendrical systems, the Olmec cylinder seal from San Andrés with the \"3 Ajaw\" glyph currently stands as the earliest known recorded date in the Americas.\n\n<<<approximately 650 BCE>>>"
