    "The Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4. This conclusion is reached through an analysis of the group's structure, specifically its abelianization and the nature of its homomorphisms to groups of order 4.\n\nA subgroup of index 4 in a group G is the kernel of a surjective homomorphism from G to a group of order 4. The groups of order 4 are the cyclic group of order 4 (denoted as Z₄) and the Klein four-group (denoted as Z₂ × Z₂).\n\nThe Grigorchuk group is a 2-group, which means that every element in the group has an order that is a power of two. A fundamental property of group homomorphisms is that the order of the image of an element must divide the order of the element itself. Consequently, there can be no surjective homomorphism from the Grigorchuk group to Z₄, as Z₄ contains an element of order 4. Therefore, any subgroup of index 4 must be the kernel of a surjective homomorphism to the Klein four-group, Z₂ × Z₂.\n\nThe number of homomorphisms from a group G to an abelian group A is determined by the abelianization of G, which is the quotient group G/[G,G], where [G,G] is the commutator subgroup of G. The abelianization of the first Grigorchuk group is known to be the elementary abelian group of order 8, which is isomorphic to (Z/2Z)³.\n\nThe number of subgroups of index 4 is the number of distinct kernels of surjective homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to Z₂ × Z₂. This can be calculated by finding the number of surjective homomorphisms and dividing by the number of automorphisms of the target group, Z₂ × Z₂.\n\n1.  **Number of homomorphisms:** The number of homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to Z₂ × Z₂ is the same as the number of homomorphisms from its abelianization, (Z/2Z)³, to Z₂ × Z₂. Since these are vector spaces over the field with two elements (F₂), this is the number of linear maps from a 3-dimensional space to a 2-dimensional space over F₂. The total number of such maps is |Z₂ × Z₂|³ = 4³ = 64.\n\n2.  **Number of surjective homomorphisms:** A homomorphism is not surjective if its image is a proper subgroup of Z₂ × Z₂. The proper subgroups of Z₂ × Z₂ are the trivial subgroup and three distinct subgroups of order 2.\n    *   There is only one homomorphism that maps everything to the trivial subgroup.\n    *   For each of the three subgroups of order 2, there are 2³ - 1 = 7 non-trivial homomorphisms from (Z/2Z)³ to that subgroup. This gives a total of 3 * 7 = 21 homomorphisms whose image is a subgroup of order 2.\n    *   The total number of non-surjective homomorphisms is 1 + 21 = 22.\n    *   Therefore, the number of surjective homomorphisms is 64 - 22 = 42.\n\n3.  **Number of distinct subgroups:** Each surjective homomorphism corresponds to a normal subgroup of index 4. To find the number of distinct subgroups, we divide the number of surjective homomorphisms by the number of automorphisms of Z₂ × Z₂. The automorphism group of Z₂ × Z₂ is the general linear group GL(2, F₂), which has an order of (2² - 1)(2² - 2) = 6.\n\nThe number of normal subgroups of index 4 is therefore 42 / 6 = 7.\n\nFinally, the Grigorchuk group is a \"just-infinite\" group, which implies that all of its subgroups of finite index are normal subgroups. Thus, the number of subgroups of index 4 is precisely 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
