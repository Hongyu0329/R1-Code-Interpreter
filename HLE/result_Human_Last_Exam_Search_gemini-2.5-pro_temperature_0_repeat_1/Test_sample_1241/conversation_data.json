    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. In the steady state, the probabilities are constant, which means their derivatives with respect to time are zero. Therefore, we set $P_{i}'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\n\nThe given system of differential equations becomes a system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$:\n\n1.  $0 = -0.019 P_{0} + 0.65 P_{1}$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 P_{0} - (0.65 + 0.4) P_{1} + 0.392 P_{2} + 0.008 P_{3}$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 P_{1} - (0.392 + 0.008) P_{2}$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 P_{2} - 0.008 P_{3}$\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1:\n5.  $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\nWe can now solve this system of equations.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 P_{2} = 0.008 P_{3} \\implies P_{2} = P_{3}$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 P_{1} = (0.392 + 0.008) P_{2}$\n$0.4 P_{1} = 0.4 P_{2} \\implies P_{1} = P_{2}$\n\nCombining these results, we have:\n$P_{1} = P_{2} = P_{3}$\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 P_{0} = 0.65 P_{1} \\implies P_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_{1}$\n\nNow, we substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right) P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} + P_{1} = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right) P_{1} = 1$\n\nTo solve for $P_1$, we calculate the term in the parenthesis:\n$\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} = \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} = \\frac{0.707}{0.019}$\n\nSo, $\\frac{0.707}{0.019} P_{1} = 1$, which gives:\n$P_{1} = \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\nNow we can find $P_0$:\n$P_{0} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_{1} = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.65}{0.707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\nThe problem asks for the sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = P_0 + P_1$:\n$P_{0} + P_{1} = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal gives approximately 0.94625.\n\nThe final answer is the sum of these probabilities.\n\n$P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\n<<<669/707>>>"
