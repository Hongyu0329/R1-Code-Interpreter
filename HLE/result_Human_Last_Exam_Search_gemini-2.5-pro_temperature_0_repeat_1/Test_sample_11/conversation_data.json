    "The first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" was the Contracts (General Part) Law. This law, enacted in 1973, marked a significant shift in Israeli jurisprudence, which had previously been more aligned with the English common law that did not have a general doctrine of good faith in contracts.\n\nThe Contracts (General Part) Law introduced the duty of good faith in two key sections. Section 12 of the law mandates that parties act in \"customary manner and in good faith\" during the negotiation of a contract. Furthermore, Section 39 requires that any right or obligation arising from a contract be exercised or fulfilled in good faith. This introduction of a broad, objective requirement of propriety has been described as a major innovation in Israeli law, with its influence extending beyond contract law to other legal acts. The source of this concept is noted to be from continental legal systems, particularly German law.\n\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
