    "Up to homeomorphism, there are four classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. A planar continuum is one that can be embedded in the Euclidean plane. A space is considered homogeneous if for any two points within it, there exists a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps one point to the other.\n\nThe classification of these continua distinguishes between degenerate and non-degenerate cases. A continuum is non-degenerate if it consists of more than one point.\n\nThe homeomorphism classes are:\n*   **The single point:** This is the only degenerate homogeneous planar continuum.\n*   **The circle:** For a long time, it was questioned whether the circle was the only non-degenerate example.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** In 1948, R.H. Bing discovered this second example. The pseudo-arc is a fractal-like object that contains no arcs.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This third non-degenerate example was found by Bing and F.B. Jones in 1959. It can be thought of as a circle where each point is replaced by a pseudo-arc.\n\nA complete classification was provided in 2014 by L. Hoehn and L. G. Oversteegen, who proved that the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs are the only three non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua up to homeomorphism.\n\nTherefore, including the degenerate case of a single point, there are a total of four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<4>>>"
