    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While several species of mushrooms exhibit a blue coloration in their fruiting bodies, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nFor example, the notably blue mushroom *Entoloma hochstetteri*, also known as the blue pinkgill, has a reddish-pink spore print. Similarly, the Blue Roundhead (*Stropharia caerulea*) has a purple-black spore print, and the blue-staining *Panaeolus cyanescens* produces a black spore print. The elegant blue webcap, *Cortinarius rotundisporus*, has a reddish-brown spore print.\n\nSpore print colors are a crucial characteristic for mushroom identification and are typically in shades of white, cream, pink, brown, purple, or black. While there are rare exceptions, such as the green spore print of *Chlorophyllum molybdites*, a blue spore print has not been documented in any known mushroom genus.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a blue spore print.>>>"
