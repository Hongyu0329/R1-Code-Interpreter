    "## \"An American in Paris\" First Best Picture Winner to Feature a Luxor Obelisk Landmark\n\nThe 1951 musical \"An American in Paris\" holds the distinction of being the first Academy Award winner for Best Picture to feature a depiction of a landmark from the Place de la Concorde in Paris, home to one of the Luxor Obelisks. While the film does not show the actual obelisk, it includes a notable ballet sequence with a set designed to resemble the famous public square, including its iconic fountain.\n\nA thorough review of all previous Best Picture winners, from the award's inception in 1927, reveals no earlier on-screen appearances of either the Luxor Obelisk in Paris or its counterpart in Luxor, Egypt. Early winners with Parisian settings, such as \"Wings\" (1927) and \"The Life of Emile Zola\" (1937), were predominantly filmed on studio backlots in the United States, with no evidence of the Place de la Concorde being depicted.\n\nWhile historical footage of the Place de la Concorde existed from as early as the late 1890s and 1932, there is no indication that this stock footage was incorporated into any of the Best Picture-winning films preceding \"An American in Paris.\" The elaborate and artistically stylized set in the 1951 musical, therefore, marks the first time a Best Picture honoree visually referenced the famous Parisian landmark where the Luxor Obelisk stands. The film won a total of six Academy Awards at the 24th Academy Awards ceremony.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
