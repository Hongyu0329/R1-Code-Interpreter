    "### Optimal Ni/Ce Ratio in Ni-Ceria Nanoparticles Varies for Water Gas Shift and Water Splitting Reactions\n\nThe ideal nickel-to-cerium (Ni/Ce) ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is not a single value but rather depends significantly on the specific application, namely the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting (WS). Research indicates that different optimal ratios exist for each of these catalytic processes.\n\n**For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, a lower Ni/Ce ratio generally appears to be more favorable. In a study involving Ni-W-Ce mixed-metal oxide catalysts, a composition of Ni₀.₂W₀.₁Ce₀.₇O₂ displayed the highest catalytic activity. This corresponds to a Ni/Ce ratio of approximately 0.28. Another study focusing on the reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) reaction identified an optimal nickel proportion of around 7% molar, which translates to a Ni/Ce ratio of about 0.075. Furthermore, research on NiO/CeO₂ catalysts for CO oxidation, a related reaction, found that a 15 wt% NiO loading on CeO₂ was the most active and stable. While the exact molar ratio isn't specified, it points towards a lower nickel concentration.\n\n**In the context of water splitting**, a higher concentration of nickel relative to cerium tends to yield better results, although the ideal ratio can differ depending on the specific half-reaction (hydrogen evolution or oxygen evolution). A computational study suggested that a 3Ni/1Ce ratio (Ni/Ce = 3) exhibits favorable electronic properties for the water-splitting reaction. Experimental work on electrolytic water splitting for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) found that a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2, which is a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5, demonstrated optimal performance. For the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), another crucial step in water splitting, catalysts with Ni/Ce ratios of 3 (Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ) and 1 (Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ) were found to have larger electrochemically active surface areas, indicating enhanced performance.\n\nIn summary, for the Water Gas Shift reaction, a lower Ni/Ce ratio, generally below 0.3, appears to be optimal. Conversely, for water splitting, a higher Ni/Ce ratio, ranging from 0.5 to as high as 3, is reported to be more effective. The discrepancy in the ideal ratios underscores the different reaction mechanisms and the distinct roles that the Ni and Ce components play in each catalytic system.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value; for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a lower ratio (e.g., ~0.075 to 0.28) is generally preferred, while for water splitting, a higher ratio (e.g., 0.5 to 3) is more effective.>>>"
