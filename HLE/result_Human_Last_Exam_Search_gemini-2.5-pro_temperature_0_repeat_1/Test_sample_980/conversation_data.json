    "This sequence of numbers does not follow a conventional mathematical pattern. Instead, the numbers correspond to section numbers of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a comprehensive criminal code that was in effect in India until July 1, 2024. The IPC is divided into 23 chapters and contains 511 sections covering various offenses and legal procedures.\n\nThe provided sequence is: 111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124.\n\nMany of these numbers are valid sections within the IPC, for instance:\n*   **Section 10:** \"Man\", \"Woman\"\n*   **Section 36:** Effect caused partly by act and partly by omission\n*   **Section 41:** \"Special law\"\n*   **Section 49:** \"Year\", \"Month\"\n*   **Section 62:** Was related to forfeiture of property, but has been repealed.\n*   **Section 67:** Imprisonment for non-payment of fine when offence punishable with fine only\n*   **Section 93:** Communication made in good faith\n*   **Section 111:** Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done\n*   **Section 124:** Assaulting President, Governor, etc., with intent to compel or restrain the exercise of any lawful power\n*   **Section 142:** Being member of unlawful assembly\n*   **Section 155:** Liability of person for whose benefit riot is committed\n\nThe repetition of numbers and the non-sequential order suggest that this list is likely derived from a specific legal case, a lawyer's notes, or a curated list of sections relevant to a particular topic, rather than a mathematical or logical puzzle. Without the original context or the source document from which this sequence was extracted, it is impossible to determine the next number in the sequence.\n\n<<<Cannot be determined>>>"
