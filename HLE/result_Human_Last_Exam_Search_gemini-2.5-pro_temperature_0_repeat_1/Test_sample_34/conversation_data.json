    "Based on established Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategies for 100 big blind cash games, the worst suited jack that should typically be opened from the button is J5s.\n\nA common GTO-based opening range from the button is approximately 40.5% of hands. This range includes all suited aces, suited kings, suited queens down to Q3s, and suited jacks down to J5s. While some strategies advocate for even wider opening ranges from the button, with some suggesting over 50%, J5s is a frequently cited baseline for the weakest suited jack in a standard opening range.\n\nThe fact that the game is rake-free encourages opening a wider range of hands than in a standard raked game. In a rake-free environment, the pot odds are more favorable, making marginally profitable hands more appealing to play. This means that while J5s is a standard open in a raked game, in a rake-free setting, it becomes an even more comfortable open, and it's possible that even weaker suited jacks like J4s, J3s, and J2s could be opened at some frequency as part of a mixed strategy.\n\nHowever, without a specific GTO chart for a rake-free game, and based on the most explicit information available from standard GTO charts, J5s represents the bottom of the suited jack range that is consistently recommended as a profitable open from the button.\n\n<<<J5s>>>"
