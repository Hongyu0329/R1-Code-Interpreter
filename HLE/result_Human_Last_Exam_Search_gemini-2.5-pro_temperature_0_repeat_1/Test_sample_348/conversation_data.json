    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\n**1. Market Equilibrium**\n\nThe supply and demand functions are given as:\n*   Supply: P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)\n*   Demand: P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))\n\nAt equilibrium, Q_S = Q_D = Q_E, and the price is the same. Therefore, we set the two equations equal to each other to find the equilibrium quantity (Q_E):\nln(Q_E³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q_E))\n\nThis equation does not have a simple analytical solution and must be solved numerically. Using a computational tool, we find the equilibrium quantity to be approximately:\n**Q_E ≈ 4.7035**\n\nNow, we can find the equilibrium price (P_E) by substituting Q_E back into either the supply or demand equation. Using the demand equation:\nP_E = 18e^(-arctan(4.7035))\n**P_E ≈ 4.621**\n\n**2. Total Welfare**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It represents the total benefit to society from the production and consumption of the good. It can be calculated by finding the area between the demand and supply curves up to the equilibrium quantity.\n\nThe formula for total welfare (TW) is:\nTW = ∫ (from 0 to Q_E) [Demand(Q)] dQ - ∫ (from Q_min to Q_E) [Supply(Q)] dQ\n\nThe supply function P = ln(Q³ - 2) is only defined when Q³ - 2 > 0, which means Q > ∛2. Therefore, the lower limit for the supply integral is ∛2 (approximately 1.2599).\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n*   Integral of the demand function: ∫ (from 0 to 4.7035) [18e^(-arctan(Q))] dQ\n*   Integral of the supply function: ∫ (from ∛2 to 4.7035) [ln(Q³ - 2)] dQ\n\nThese integrals are also computed numerically:\n*   The integral of the demand function evaluates to approximately 33.353.\n*   The integral of the supply function evaluates to approximately 9.131.\n\nFinally, the total welfare is the difference between these two values:\nTW = 33.353 - 9.131 = 24.222\n\n<<<24.222>>>"
