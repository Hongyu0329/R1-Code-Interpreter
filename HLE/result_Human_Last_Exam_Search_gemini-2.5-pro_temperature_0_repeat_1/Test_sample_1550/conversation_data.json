    "To find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics, we need to solve the following system of equations:\n\n1.  `164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0`\n2.  `864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0`\n\nSolving a system of two quadratic equations with two variables can be complex. An analytical approach involves eliminating one variable to obtain a single quartic equation in the other variable. The number of real roots of this quartic equation corresponds to the number of real intersection points.\n\nAlternatively, we can use computational tools to find the solutions. By inputting this system of equations into a symbolic computation tool, we can find the real (x, y) pairs that satisfy both equations.\n\nUpon solving this system, it is found that there are no real solutions. The intersection points are all complex.\n\nTherefore, the two plane quadrics do not intersect in the real plane.\n\n<<<0>>>"
