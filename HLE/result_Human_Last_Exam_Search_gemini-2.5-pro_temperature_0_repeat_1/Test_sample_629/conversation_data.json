    "The minimal grid number for a knot, also known as its arc index, is the smallest integer `n` for which the knot can be represented on an `n x n` grid. For an alternating knot, the arc index is its minimal crossing number plus two. The trefoil knot is an alternating knot with a minimal crossing number of 3. Therefore, its minimal grid number is 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nWe are looking for the number of distinct 5x5 grid diagrams that represent the left-hand trefoil knot. Research has shown that there are a total of 10 minimal grid diagrams for the trefoil knot. These 10 diagrams account for both the left-handed and the right-handed versions of the knot.\n\nThe trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image. In the context of grid diagrams, taking the mirror image of a diagram for a left-handed knot results in a diagram for a right-handed knot. Consequently, the 10 minimal grid diagrams are split equally between the two chiralities.\n\nTherefore, there are 5 minimal grid diagrams for the left-handed trefoil knot and 5 for the right-handed trefoil knot. These enumerations are typically given up to the symmetries of translation and rotation.\n\n<<<E>>>"
