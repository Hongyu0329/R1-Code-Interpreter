    "To determine the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve defined by $z^2=2x^5+2x^3+1$ above 2, we need to analyze the structure of the stable model of this curve. The valuation $v$ is normalized such that $v(2)=1$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$. The stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve $z^2=f(x)$ is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)$ and their differences. To find the valuations of the roots, we use the Newton polygon of $f(x)$ with respect to the valuation $v=v_2$. The vertices of the Newton polygon are determined by the points $(i, v(c_i))$, where $c_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$. The coefficients are $c_5=2, c_3=2, c_0=1$. The corresponding points are $(5, v(2))=(5,1)$, $(3, v(2))=(3,1)$, and $(0, v(1))=(0,0)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points consists of a single line segment from $(0,0)$ to $(5,1)$. The point $(3,1)$ lies above this segment, since the line connecting $(0,0)$ and $(5,1)$ is given by $y=x/5$, and for $x=3$, we have $y=3/5 < 1$. The slope of this segment is $(1-0)/(5-0) = 1/5$. The valuations of the roots of $f(x)$ are the negative of the slopes of the Newton polygon. Therefore, all five roots $r_1, \\dots, r_5$ of $f(x)$ have valuation $v(r_i) = -1/5$.\n\nThis implies that to analyze the curve, we need to work in a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}_2(\\pi)$ where $\\pi^5=2$. The valuation on $K$ is $v_K$, normalized so that $v_K(\\pi)=1$. This means $v_K(2)=5$, and for any $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2$, $v_K(a) = 5v(a)$.\n\nLet's perform a change of variables to make the valuations of the roots equal to zero. Let $x = y/\\pi$. The roots $s_i$ of the new polynomial in $y$ will have valuation $v_K(s_i) = v_K(r_i \\pi) = v_K(r_i) + v_K(\\pi) = 5v(r_i)+1 = 5(-1/5)+1=0$. The equation of the curve becomes:\n$z^2 = 2(y/\\pi)^5 + 2(y/\\pi)^3 + 1$\n$z^2 = \\frac{2}{\\pi^5}y^5 + \\frac{2}{\\pi^3}y^3 + 1$\nSince $\\pi^5=2$, this simplifies to:\n$z^2 = y^5 + \\pi^2 y^3 + 1$\n\nThis is an equation for a model of the curve over the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}_2[\\pi]$. The stable reduction is the special fiber of the stable model, which is obtained by resolving the singularities of the special fiber of a regular model. The model given by $z^2 = y^5 + \\pi^2 y^3 + 1$ is regular. Its special fiber is obtained by reducing the equation modulo $\\pi$:\n$z^2 = y^5 + 1$\nThis is the equation of a curve over the residue field $k = \\mathcal{O}_K/(\\pi) \\cong \\mathbb{F}_2$. This curve is irreducible, but it is singular. The singularity is at the point at infinity. To see this, we homogenize the equation: $Z^2W^3 = Y^5 + W^5$. The point at infinity is $[Z:Y:W] = [1:0:0]$. Dehomogenizing by setting $Z=1$, we get $W^3 = Y^5+W^5$. The point $(Y,W)=(0,0)$ is a singular point, a cusp of type $(3,5)$.\n\nThe stable model is obtained by resolving this singularity. The resolution of a cusp of type $(m,n)$ is a chain of rational curves. Here, the singularity is on the special fiber of a model over a DVR. The process of finding the stable model involves a sequence of blow-ups.\n\nA more direct approach is to find a different model of the original curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Let's rewrite the equation as $z^2-1 = 2x^5+2x^3 = 2x^3(x^2+1)$.\nLet $z' = (z-1)/2$. Then $z=2z'+1$.\n$(2z'+1)^2-1 = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n$4(z')^2+4z' = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n$2z'(z'+1) = x^3(x^2+1)$\n\nThis is a new model of the curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. Let's examine its special fiber by reducing modulo 2:\n$0 = x^3(x^2+1) \\pmod 2$\n$0 = x^3(x+1)^2 \\pmod 2$\nThe special fiber is a union of two components: the line $C_1$ given by $x=0$ with multiplicity $m_1=3$, and the line $C_2$ given by $x=1$ with multiplicity $m_2=2$. This model is regular.\n\nThe stable reduction of a curve with such a special fiber is described by the theory of degenerations of curves. The stable model is obtained by resolving the non-transverse intersections and the multiplicities of the components. The components $x=0$ and $x=1$ are parallel and meet at infinity. The stable reduction will have a chain of rational curves connecting the strict transforms of $C_1$ and $C_2$. According to the theory of stable reduction for such configurations, the stable model will have two double points (nodes). The thicknesses of these nodes are given by the multiplicities of the components. Specifically, one node will have a thickness equal to the multiplicity of the first component, and the other node will have a thickness equal to the multiplicity of the second component.\n\nIn our case, the multiplicities are 3 and 2. This would imply two double points with thicknesses 3 and 2. The question asks for \"the\" thickness of \"the\" double point, which suggests a unique answer. In many contexts, the properties of the stable reduction are determined by the component with the lowest multiplicity greater than 1. Following this interpretation, the most significant double point would be the one associated with the lowest multiplicity, which is 2.\n\nThe thickness of a double point in the stable reduction is an integer representing the valuation of the local parameter in the equation $uv=t$. The value $v(t)$ must be an integer. The multiplicity of the component $C_2$ is 2.\n\nFinal Answer: The thickness of the double point is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
