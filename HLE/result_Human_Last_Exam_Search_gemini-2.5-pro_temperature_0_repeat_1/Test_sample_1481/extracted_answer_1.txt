In the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the asymptotic analysis of the generating function H(s,s′) that encapsulates the billiard map's symplectic structure reveals a leading-order behavior in the limit as the arc-length parameter separation ∣s′−s∣ approaches zero that is fundamentally influenced by the boundary's local curvature κ(s). The generating function H(s,s′) is defined as the negative of the Euclidean distance between two points on the boundary parametrized by their arc-lengths s and s′. Its partial derivatives with respect to s and s′ determine the cosines of the incident and reflection angles of the billiard trajectory.

For a C²-smooth boundary, the asymptotic expansion of H(s,s′) for small |s′ - s| is given by:

**H(s, s′) = -|s′ - s| [1 - (κ(s)²/24)(s′ - s)² - (κ(s)κ'(s)/24)(s′ - s)³ + O((s′ - s)⁴)]**

This expansion demonstrates that the leading-order behavior is not simply the linear separation but includes higher-order corrections dependent on the local geometry. The term proportional to κ(s)² introduces a fundamental non-linearity directly related to the curvature, while the term involving the derivative of the curvature, κ'(s), shows the influence of the local change in the boundary's shape on the dynamics. This nuanced interplay highlights how geometric curvature effects are intrinsically linked to the dynamical properties of the billiard system in this asymptotic regime.
