    "The major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is perylene-3-thiol.\n\nThe calculation of the Szeged/Wiener index ratio for this molecule, particularly with the inclusion of all hydrogen atoms, is a complex computational task that requires specialized chemical graph theory software. This specific value is not available in published literature or public chemical databases. The calculation involves constructing a molecular graph with 33 vertices (20 carbon, 12 hydrogen, 1 sulfur) and determining the sum of distances between all 528 pairs of vertices for the Wiener index, and then performing a related but distinct calculation for the Szeged index.\n\nAs this value cannot be retrieved from existing sources and requires de novo computation beyond the scope of available tools, a numerical answer cannot be provided.\n\n<<<The requested value is not available in published literature or public databases and requires complex computational chemistry calculations to determine.>>>"
