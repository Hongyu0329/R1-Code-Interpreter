    "An analysis of the position reveals that White has a decisive, game-winning move.\n\nThe position is defined by the FEN string 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1. It is White's turn to move.\n\nThe key to White's advantage lies in the exposed position of the Black king on b6 and the powerful placement of the White queen on f2. This allows for a tactical sequence that wins the Black queen.\n\nThe optimal move for White is to play the queen to c2, delivering a check to the Black king.\n\nAfter White plays **Qc2+**, Black is forced to move the king. Regardless of where the king moves (to a6, b7, a7, or b5), White can then capture the Black queen on c5 with **Qxc5**. This exchange leaves White with a queen against Black's pawns, which is a winning endgame. Any other move by White would allow Black to either capture the advanced d-pawn or improve their position.\n\n<<<Qc2+>>>"
