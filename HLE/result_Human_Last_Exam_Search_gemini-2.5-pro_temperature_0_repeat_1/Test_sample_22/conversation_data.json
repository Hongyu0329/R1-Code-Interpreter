    "True.\n\nThe predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS), measured by the proportion of variance it explains (R²), is theoretically capped by the SNP heritability (h²_SNP) of the phenotype. SNP heritability represents the total proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by the additive effects of all common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). It is the theoretical upper limit of predictive accuracy for any model, like a PGS, that uses only this SNP information.\n\nA polygenic score is a practical tool built from a GWAS. Its accuracy is limited for several key reasons:\n*   **Estimation Error:** A PGS is constructed using SNP effect sizes estimated from a GWAS with a finite sample size. This leads to imprecision and error in the weights assigned to each SNP.\n*   **Incomplete Information:** Not all causal genetic variants are captured or perfectly tagged by the SNPs included in standard genotyping arrays.\n*   **Methodological Assumptions:** The statistical methods used to create the score make simplifying assumptions, for instance, about how to handle the complex correlations between nearby SNPs (linkage disequilibrium).\n\nBecause of these factors, a PGS will practically always capture only a fraction of the total SNP heritability. The predictive power of a PGS (its R²) is expected to increase and approach the SNP heritability as the sample size of the underlying GWAS grows infinitely large, which reduces estimation error. However, in any real-world application, the R² of the PGS will be lower than the SNP heritability. For example, the SNP heritability for ADHD is estimated at 21.6%, while the best polygenic scores for ADHD explain about 5.5% of the variance.\n\nWhile some studies have noted rare instances where a PGS R² can exceed a specific *estimate* of SNP heritability, this is typically due to statistical artifacts or heterogeneity between the different populations used for the GWAS and the prediction sample. The fundamental principle remains that the true SNP heritability for a given population represents the theoretical ceiling for prediction based on common SNPs.\n\n<<<True>>>"
