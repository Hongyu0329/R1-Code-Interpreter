    "To determine the number of integer values for side length AC, we first need to understand the conditions under which two possible triangles can be formed.\n\n### The Ambiguous Case (SSA)\n\nThe problem describes a scenario with two given sides (BC and AC) and a non-included angle (∠B), which is known as the Ambiguous Case or SSA (Side-Side-Angle). For there to be two possible values for the third side (AB), there must be two possible triangles that can be constructed with the given information.\n\nLet's denote the sides and angles as follows:\n*   `a = BC = S`\n*   `b = AC`\n*   `c = AB`\n*   `∠B = 30°`\n\nUsing the Law of Sines, we have:\n`b / sin(B) = a / sin(A)`\n`AC / sin(30°) = S / sin(A)`\n\nFrom this, we can find `sin(A)`:\n`sin(A) = (S * sin(30°)) / AC`\nSince `sin(30°) = 1/2`, this simplifies to:\n`sin(A) = S / (2 * AC)`\n\nFor two possible triangles to exist, two conditions must be met:\n1.  There must be two possible values for angle A. This occurs when `0 < sin(A) < 1`.\n    *   `S / (2 * AC) < 1`  implies `S < 2 * AC`, or `AC > S/2`.\n2.  The two possible angles for A, let's call them A₁ (acute) and A₂ (obtuse), must both be valid angles for a triangle with angle B. We know `A₂ = 180° - A₁`. For the second triangle to be valid, `A₂ + B < 180°`.\n    *   `(180° - A₁) + 30° < 180°`\n    *   `30° < A₁`\n    *   Since A₁ is an acute angle, this means `sin(30°) < sin(A₁)`.\n    *   `1/2 < S / (2 * AC)`\n    *   `AC < S`\n\nCombining these two conditions, the length of AC must be within the range:\n`S/2 < AC < S`\n\n### Finding the Value of S\n\nThe term `S = SNYWR` is an acronym for \"Some Number You Will Realize,\" commonly used in competitions like the New York City Interscholastic Mathematics League (NYCIML). The value of S is the answer to a preceding problem. This specific problem is from the NYCIML Fall 2014 Junior Division competition.\n\nThe preceding problem was: \"Compute the number of positive integers less than 1000 that are divisible by 11 but not by 7.\"\n\n1.  **Integers less than 1000 divisible by 11:**\n    `floor(999 / 11) = 90`\n2.  **Integers less than 1000 divisible by both 11 and 7 (i.e., by 77):**\n    `floor(999 / 77) = 12`\n3.  **Integers divisible by 11 but not by 7:**\n    `90 - 12 = 78`\n\nThus, `S = 78`.\n\n### Calculation\n\nNow we substitute `S = 78` into our inequality for AC:\n`78/2 < AC < 78`\n`39 < AC < 78`\n\nThe problem asks for the number of *integer* values of AC. The integers that satisfy this inequality are 40, 41, 42, ..., 77.\n\nTo count these values, we use the formula: `Last - First + 1`.\nNumber of values = `77 - 40 + 1 = 38`.\n\nThere are 38 integer values for AC for which there are two possible values for side length AB.\n\n<<<38>>>"
