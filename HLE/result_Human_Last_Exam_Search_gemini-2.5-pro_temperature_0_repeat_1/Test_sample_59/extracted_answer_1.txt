The probability to draw a link \(y_{ij}\) is given by the expected value of the integral of the random graphon \(W\) over the unit square: \(P(y_{ij} = 1) = E_W \left[ \int_0^1 \int_0^1 W(u,v) du dv \right]\), where the expectation is taken over the random measure *F* that defines the distribution of *W*.
