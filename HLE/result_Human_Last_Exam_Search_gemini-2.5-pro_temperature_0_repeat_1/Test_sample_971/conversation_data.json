    "Despite a comprehensive search for information regarding Natalia Osipova's performance as Kitri in the 2008 Bolshoi Ballet production of *Don Quixote*, a definitive count of the single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position in the Act I variation could not be determined.\n\nNumerous performance reviews and discussions from that period praise Osipova's exceptional talent and her dynamic interpretation of the role. Her powerful jumps and turns were frequently highlighted as standout features of her performance. However, none of the available written accounts provide a precise choreographic breakdown of the number of pirouettes in the Act I variation.\n\nSeveral video recordings of the 2008 performance are referenced in search results, which would be essential for a precise count of the ballet steps. Unfortunately, all located links to these videos, including a promising high-definition version titled \"Kitri variation act 1 - Natalia Osipova em 2008 HD,\" are no longer active. Without access to a viewable recording of the performance, an accurate count of the specified pirouettes is not possible.\n\nTherefore, while it is well-documented that Natalia Osipova's portrayal of Kitri in 2008 was a celebrated event in the ballet world, the exact number of single-turn pirouettes she performed in the Act I variation is not available in the public record discovered.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number for the pirouettes as the video evidence of the 2008 performance is not available and written accounts do not contain this level of choreographic detail.>>>"
