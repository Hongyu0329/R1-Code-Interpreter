An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F:X×Y×Z→X, G:Y×X×Y→Y, and H:Z×Y×X→Z is an element (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The conditions for the existence of such a point are typically established in the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces and involve: the completeness of the metric spaces X, Y, and Z; a mixed monotone property for the mappings F, G, and H with respect to the partial orderings; a contractive condition on the mappings; and the existence of a suitable initial point.
