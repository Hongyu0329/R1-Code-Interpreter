    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This involves performing elementary row operations on a stacked matrix formed by P1 and P2 to reduce it to a simpler form. The resulting non-zero rows will form the GCRD.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nA key property of the GCRD is that its determinant must divide the greatest common divisor of the determinants of P1 and P2.\n\nFirst, let's compute the determinants of P1 and P2:\n*   det(P1) = (s^2 + s)(s^2) - (-s)(-s^2 - 1) = s^4 + s^3 - (s^3 + s) = s^4 - s = s(s^3 - 1)\n*   det(P2) = (s)(1) - (0)(-s - 1) = s\n\nThe greatest common divisor of det(P1) and det(P2) is gcd(s(s^3 - 1), s) = s. Therefore, the determinant of any common right divisor, D(s), must be a polynomial that divides s. This means det(D(s)) can be either a non-zero constant or a constant multiple of s.\n\nIf a common right divisor D(s) exists such that its determinant is a multiple of s, then det(D(0)) = 0. This would imply that the rank of the matrix D(0) is less than 2.\n\nA fundamental property relating a matrix and its divisor is that the rank of the stacked matrix [P1(s); P2(s)] must be less than or equal to the rank of the divisor D(s) for all values of s. Let's evaluate the rank of the stacked matrix at s = 0:\nM(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2], [s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\nM(0) = [, [-1, 0],, [-1, 1]]\n\nThe non-zero rows of M(0) are [-1, 0] and [-1, 1]. These two vectors are linearly independent, which means the rank of M(0) is 2.\n\nIf a common right divisor D(s) existed with det(D(s)) being a multiple of s, its rank at s=0 would be less than 2. This leads to a contradiction:\nrank(M(0)) ≤ rank(D(0))\n2 ≤ 1\n\nThis contradiction proves that no common right divisor with a determinant of 's' can exist. Therefore, any common right divisor of P1 and P2 must have a determinant that is a non-zero constant. Such matrices are called unimodular.\n\nWhen the only common right divisors are unimodular matrices, the original matrices are said to be right co-prime. In this case, any unimodular matrix can be considered a greatest common right divisor. By convention, the identity matrix is chosen as the canonical representative.\n\nThus, the greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2 is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
