    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. From the search results, we see that $53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\n### 2. Properties of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is a homomorphism from the multiplicative group of integers modulo $d$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, to the complex numbers.\n\nIf the conductor $d$ has the prime factorization $d = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, then any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i^{a_i}$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$\n\nThe character $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $d$ if and only if each of the component characters $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo its respective prime power factor $p_i^{a_i}$. In our case, $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$, so all exponents $a_i$ are 1. A character $\\chi_p$ modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if it is not the principal (trivial) character.\n\n### 3. Order of a Dirichlet Character\nThe order of the character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the individual characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$\n\nWe require the order of $\\chi$ to be 6. This means that the set of orders of the component characters must contain at least one order divisible by 2 and at least one order divisible by 3. The possible orders for each $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ must be divisors of 6, i.e., {1, 2, 3, 6}.\n\n### 4. Number of Primitive Characters of a Specific Order\nFor a prime conductor $p$, the group of characters modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of primitive characters of order $k$ (where $k>1$ and $k$ divides $p-1$) is given by $\\phi(k)$, which is Euler's totient function.\n\nLet's calculate the number of primitive characters of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6 for each prime factor of $d$:\n*   **For p = 7:** $\\phi(7-1) = \\phi(6) = 2$. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Order 1: 1 character (the principal character, which is not primitive).\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$ primitive character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$ primitive characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$ primitive characters.\n*   **For p = 13:** $\\phi(13-1) = \\phi(12) = 4$. The divisors of 12 that also divide 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Order 1: 1 non-primitive character.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$ primitive character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$ primitive characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$ primitive characters.\n*   **For p = 19:** $\\phi(19-1) = \\phi(18) = 6$. The divisors of 18 that also divide 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Order 1: 1 non-primitive character.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$ primitive character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$ primitive characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$ primitive characters.\n*   **For p = 31:** $\\phi(31-1) = \\phi(30) = 8$. The divisors of 30 that also divide 6 are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Order 1: 1 non-primitive character.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$ primitive character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$ primitive characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$ primitive characters.\n\nLet $N_k(p)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p$ of order $k$.\n*   $N_1(p) = 0$ (since primitive characters have order > 1)\n*   $N_2(p) = \\phi(2) = 1$ for $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$\n*   $N_3(p) = \\phi(3) = 2$ for $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$\n*   $N_6(p) = \\phi(6) = 2$ for $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$\n\n### 5. Combining the Characters\nLet the orders of the four primitive characters $\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31}$ be $k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4$. We need $\\text{lcm}(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4) = 6$. Each $k_i$ must be in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$ (but since the characters must be primitive, their orders must be greater than 1).\n\nLet $C_p(S)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p$ whose order is in the set $S$.\n*   $C_p(\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}) = N_2(p) + N_3(p) + N_6(p) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$ for each prime $p$.\n*   $C_p(\\{1, 3\\}) = N_3(p) = 2$ for each prime $p$.\n*   $C_p(\\{1, 2\\}) = N_2(p) = 1$ for each prime $p$.\n\nThe total number of combinations of primitive characters where all orders divide 6 is $5^4 = 625$.\n\nFrom this, we must subtract the cases where the lcm is not 6:\n*   **lcm divides 3:** The orders of all characters must be in {1, 3}. The number of ways is $2^4 = 16$.\n*   **lcm divides 2:** The orders of all characters must be in {1, 2}. The number of ways is $1^4 = 1$.\n\nThe case where the lcm is 1 is included in both subtractions. The number of ways for the lcm to be 1 is $0^4=0$, as primitive characters cannot have order 1.\n\nUsing the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, the number of characters of order 6 is:\n(Total where orders divide 6) - (Total where orders divide 3) - (Total where orders divide 2) + (Total where orders divide 1)\n$5^4 - 2^4 - 1^4 + 0 = 625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\nThus, there are 608 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 53599 and order 6.\n\n<<<608>>>"
