    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed where the ligand bridges two ruthenium centers. This reaction results in the formation of **two** diastereoisomers.\n\nThe ligand, 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole, acts as a bridging ligand, connecting two `Ru(bpy)2` units. The resulting dinuclear complex, `[{Ru(bpy)2}2(μ-2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole)]^4+`, has two chiral ruthenium centers.\n\nThe combination of the chiralities at these two metal centers leads to the formation of two distinct diastereomeric products:\n*   One is a **meso** form (Δ/Λ), which possesses a center of inversion.\n*   The other is a **racemic** mixture of the (Δ/Δ) and (Λ/Λ) enantiomers.\n\nThese two diastereoisomers, the meso and the racemic form, have been successfully separated and characterized.\n\n<<<2>>>"
