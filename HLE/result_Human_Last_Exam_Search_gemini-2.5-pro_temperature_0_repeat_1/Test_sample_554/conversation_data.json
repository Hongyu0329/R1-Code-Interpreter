    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms. This is based on the chemical formula of a specific nanocar molecule, C430H274O12, which was designed by a group at Rice University led by Professor James Tour.\n\nThe term \"perfluoro\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms in the original organic molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms. Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluorinated version of this nanocar is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in its molecular formula.\n\nThe original nanocar, designed in 2005, consists of an H-shaped chassis with fullerene groups at the corners that act as wheels. While various nanocars have been synthesized for events like the Nanocar Race, the formula C430H274O12 corresponds to a well-documented structure. The replacement of its 274 hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms would result in a perfluoronanocar.\n\n<<<274>>>"
