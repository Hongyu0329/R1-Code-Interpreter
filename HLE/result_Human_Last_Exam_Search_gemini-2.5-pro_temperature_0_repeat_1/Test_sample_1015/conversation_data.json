    "A key distinction between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods in the execution of a cambré derrière lies in the placement of the hip.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and strong torso. This principle dictates that the hips should remain aligned and not be displaced forward or to the side during the backbend. The movement is initiated from the upper back, with the entire body working as a coordinated unit to maintain stability and a clean line.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine technique is known for creating long, extended lines, and to achieve this, it often deviates from strict classical alignment. A notable characteristic of the Balanchine method is the use of an open hip in arabesque to create the illusion of a higher leg line. This principle of prioritizing the visual line over a squared torso can also be applied to other movements, including the cambré derrière, allowing for greater flexibility and a more dynamic, three-dimensional look. While Vaganova emphasizes a controlled and precise backbend with a stable pelvic alignment, Balanchine allows for the hip to open, which affects the overall shape and degree of the movement.\n\nOther elements also differ between the two styles. The arm placement in Balanchine is generally more open and less curved, sometimes featuring a \"broken wrist,\" in contrast to the specific, rounded port de bras of the Vaganova method. The speed of movement in Balanchine's style is typically faster and more athletic. The placement of the head in Vaganova is strictly coordinated with the arms and body, often turning to the side in a cambré derrière to maintain a long neck line and avoid strain. While all these aspects represent differences, the fundamental approach to the hip placement is a significant and defining divergence between the two techniques.\n\n<<<B>>>"
