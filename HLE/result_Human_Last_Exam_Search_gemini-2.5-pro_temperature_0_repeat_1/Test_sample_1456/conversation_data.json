    "The question asks for the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua. A continuum is a compact connected metric space, and it is nondegenerate if it contains more than one point.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n### 1. Decomposability of the Product Continuum\n\nLet X and Y be two nondegenerate continua. Their topological product, Z = X × Y, is also a continuum.\n\nA continuum is called **decomposable** if it can be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Otherwise, it is **indecomposable**. A key theorem states that a continuum is decomposable if and only if it contains a proper subcontinuum with a non-empty interior.\n\nWe can show that the product of two nondegenerate continua is always decomposable:\n*   Since X and Y are nondegenerate, they are not single points. As metric spaces, we can find proper non-empty open subsets U ⊂ X and V ⊂ Y.\n*   The product U × V is a non-empty open set in Z = X × Y.\n*   Consider the set K = cl(U) × cl(V), where cl denotes the closure. K is a subcontinuum of Z.\n*   Since U and V are proper open sets in connected spaces, their closures cl(U) and cl(V) are proper subcontinua of X and Y, respectively. Therefore, K is a proper subcontinuum of Z.\n*   The interior of K contains the non-empty open set U × V.\n*   Thus, Z = X × Y contains a proper subcontinuum (K) with a non-empty interior, which implies that Z is decomposable.\n\n### 2. Number of Composants of a Decomposable Continuum\n\nThe number of composants in a continuum depends on whether it is decomposable or indecomposable. For a decomposable continuum, the number of composants is either one or three.\n*   A decomposable continuum has **one** composant if it is not irreducible.\n*   A decomposable continuum has **three** composants if it is irreducible.\n\n### 3. Irreducibility of the Product Continuum\n\nA continuum is **irreducible** if there exist two points in it such that no proper subcontinuum contains both of them. To find the largest possible number of composants, we need to determine if the product Z = X × Y can be irreducible.\n\nThere is a classical theorem, which was later corrected, concerning the irreducibility of a product of continua. The corrected theorem by J. Krasinkiewicz (1973) states:\n\n> The product X × Y of two non-degenerate continua is irreducible if and only if both X and Y are irreducible and neither of them is an arc.\n\nAn arc (a space homeomorphic to) is an example of an irreducible continuum. However, the product of two arcs (a square) is not irreducible.\n\n### 4. Determining the Maximum Number of Composants\n\nBased on the corrected theorem, we can construct a product of two nondegenerate continua that is irreducible:\n1.  Choose X and Y to be irreducible continua that are not arcs. A well-known example of such a continuum is an **indecomposable continuum**, like the pseudo-arc or the buckethandle continuum. Indecomposable continua are always irreducible.\n2.  Let X and Y be two pseudo-arcs. They are nondegenerate, irreducible, and are not arcs.\n3.  According to the theorem, their product Z = X × Y is irreducible.\n\nNow, we can combine our findings:\n*   The product Z = X × Y is **decomposable** (from step 1).\n*   The product Z = X × Y is **irreducible** (by choosing appropriate X and Y, as shown in step 3).\n\nA continuum that is both decomposable and irreducible has exactly **three** composants. Since the number of composants for the product of two nondegenerate continua can be 1 (e.g., the product of two arcs) or 3, the largest possible number is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
