    "A \"power subgroup\" is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group. To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of order 512, we need to determine the number of distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 512, denoted as SD_512, is a group of order 2⁹. For a semidihedral group SD_2ⁿ (where n ≥ 4), a known formula calculates the number of its cyclic subgroups, denoted as c(SD_2ⁿ). The formula is:\n\nc(SD_2ⁿ) = 3 * 2ⁿ⁻³ + n\n\nIn this case, the order of the group is 512, which is 2⁹. Therefore, n = 9.\n\nSubstituting n = 9 into the formula:\n\nc(SD_512) = 3 * 2⁹⁻³ + 9\nc(SD_512) = 3 * 2⁶ + 9\nc(SD_512) = 3 * 64 + 9\nc(SD_512) = 192 + 9\nc(SD_512) = 201\n\nThus, there are 201 distinct cyclic subgroups in the semidihedral group of order 512.\n\nThis result can be derived by analyzing the structure of the group:\n*   The group SD_512 contains a cyclic subgroup of order 256 (2⁸). A cyclic group of order 2^k has k+1 subgroups. Thus, this subgroup contributes 8 + 1 = 9 cyclic subgroups.\n*   The remaining 256 elements are of two types: 128 elements of order 2 and 128 elements of order 4.\n*   The 128 elements of order 2 each generate a unique cyclic subgroup of order 2. This gives 128 subgroups.\n*   The 128 elements of order 4 pair up to generate cyclic subgroups of order 4, resulting in 128 / 2 = 64 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 128 + 64 = 201.\n\n<<<201>>>"
