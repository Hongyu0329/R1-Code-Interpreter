    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, a certain percentage of vaccinated individuals receive complete protection, while the rest receive no protection at all. In contrast, a \"leaky\" vaccine provides partial protection to all vaccinated individuals.\n\nTo determine how the 1-incidence rate ratio relates to per-exposure vaccine efficacy, let's break down the terms:\n\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the incidence rate of the disease in the vaccinated group divided by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group. Vaccine efficacy (VE) is commonly calculated as 1 - IRR.\n*   **Per-exposure Vaccine Efficacy:** This measures the reduction in infection risk for a vaccinated individual upon a single exposure to the pathogen, compared to an unvaccinated individual.\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine Action:** If a vaccine has an efficacy of, for example, 90%, it means 90% of the vaccinated population is fully immune, and the remaining 10% are as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals.\n\nIn an all-or-nothing model, the incidence rate in the vaccinated group is entirely due to infections in the unprotected fraction of that group. The protected fraction contributes zero cases. Therefore, the overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group is proportionally lower than in the unvaccinated group, and this proportion is directly determined by the fraction of the population that is not protected.\n\nThe result is that the vaccine efficacy calculated as `1 - IRR` is a direct measure of the proportion of the vaccinated population that is completely protected. This value is also equivalent to the average per-exposure efficacy across the entire vaccinated group. For the protected individuals, the per-exposure efficacy is 100%, and for the unprotected, it is 0%. The weighted average, which is the overall per-exposure efficacy, equals the proportion of protected individuals.\n\nTherefore, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the 1-incidence rate ratio correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
