    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Such curves are typically the stable and unstable manifolds associated with saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points exist where both $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + 0 - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)=0$:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1)+5(1)^2)d - 1(1-1)(1)^2 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$.\n    This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    Thus, we have two more equilibrium points: **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the nature of these equilibrium points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, (1, 0) is an **unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=-2$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, (1, -1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive, and this is a non-hyperbolic equilibrium point.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (1, -1). We look for an invariant curve—a trajectory of the system—that passes through this point. Let's test for a simple polynomial relationship between $d$ and $u$, of the form $d = f(u)$.\n\nLet's assume the separatrix has the form $d = -u^2$. We can verify if this curve is a solution to the system.\nFirst, we find the derivative of $d$ with respect to time, using the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{dd}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(-u^2) = -2u \\frac{du}{dt}$$\nSubstituting $u' = u^2(u-1)$:\n$$\\frac{dd}{dt} = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = -2u^4 + 2u^3$$\nNext, we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the original equation for $d'(t)$:\n$$d'(t) = 2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$$\n$$d'(t) = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4$$\n$$d'(t) = (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$$\nSince both expressions for $d'(t)$ are identical, the curve $d = -u^2$ is indeed an invariant manifold of the system.\n\nThis curve passes through two of the equilibrium points:\n*   For $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$, which is the saddle point (1, -1).\n*   For $u=0$, $d = -(0)^2 = 0$, which is the equilibrium point (0, 0).\n\nSince the curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold that contains a saddle point, it is a separatrix. Specifically, it represents the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1), as trajectories on this curve for $0<u<1$ move away from (1, -1) towards (0, 0). This curve divides the phase plane into regions of differing dynamic behavior.\n\n<<<The separatrix is given by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
