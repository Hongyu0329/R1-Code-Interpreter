The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is given by Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ]), where the integral is a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields ψ and ψ̄. These fields must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction, ψ(τ, **x**) = -ψ(τ + β, **x**), where β is the inverse temperature. The term S_E is the Euclidean action for the fermions, defined as S_E = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x L_E, with L_E being the Euclidean Lagrangian density.
