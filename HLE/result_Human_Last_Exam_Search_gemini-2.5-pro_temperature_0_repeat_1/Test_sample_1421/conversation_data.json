    "The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is a cornerstone of thermal quantum field theory. It allows for the study of fermionic systems in thermal equilibrium.\n\nThe partition function, denoted by Z, is expressed as a functional integral over all possible configurations of the fermionic fields. A key feature of this formalism is the use of Grassmann numbers, which are anti-commuting variables, to represent the fermionic fields, reflecting the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nThe imaginary time formalism is achieved through a Wick rotation of the time coordinate (`t → -iτ`), where `τ` is the imaginary time. In this formalism, the system is studied over a finite imaginary time interval from 0 to `β = 1/T`, where T is the temperature and `k_B` (Boltzmann's constant) is set to 1.\n\nA crucial aspect for fermions in this representation is the imposition of anti-periodic boundary conditions on the fermionic fields `ψ` and `ψ̄` in the imaginary time direction. This means that a field at the beginning of the imaginary time interval is related to the field at the end by a minus sign: `ψ(τ, **x**) = -ψ(τ + β, **x**)`.\n\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z is:\n\n**Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])**\n\nWhere:\n*   **Z** is the partition function.\n*   **∫ Dψ̄ Dψ** represents the functional or path integral over all possible configurations of the Grassmann-valued fermionic fields `ψ` and its adjoint `ψ̄`.\n*   **S_E[ψ̄, ψ]** is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system.\n\nThe Euclidean action `S_E` is obtained from the standard action in Minkowski space by performing a Wick rotation. It is given by the integral of the Euclidean Lagrangian density `L_E` over spacetime in Euclidean signature:\n\n**S_E[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x L_E(ψ̄, ψ, ∂_μψ, ∂_μψ̄)**\n\nFor a free Dirac fermion field with mass `m`, the Euclidean Lagrangian density `L_E` is typically written as:\n\n**L_E = ψ̄(x)(γ^μ ∂_μ + m)ψ(x)**\n\nIn this expression:\n*   `x = (τ, **x**)` represents the coordinates in Euclidean spacetime.\n*   `γ^μ` are the gamma matrices in the Euclidean metric.\n*   The fields `ψ(x)` and `ψ̄(x)` are functions of both imaginary time `τ` and spatial position **x**, and they are treated as independent Grassmann variables for each point in spacetime.\n\nThe path integral is performed subject to the anti-periodic boundary conditions for the fermion fields in the `τ` direction. This formulation provides a powerful tool for calculating thermodynamic properties and correlation functions of fermionic systems.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is given by Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ]), where the integral is a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields ψ and ψ̄. These fields must satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction, ψ(τ, **x**) = -ψ(τ + β, **x**), where β is the inverse temperature. The term S_E is the Euclidean action for the fermions, defined as S_E = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x L_E, with L_E being the Euclidean Lagrangian density.>>>"
