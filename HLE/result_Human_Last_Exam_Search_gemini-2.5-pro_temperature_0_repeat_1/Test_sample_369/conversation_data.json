    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must determine the quantity (long or short) of each syllable and group them into six metrical feet. The process involves identifying elisions, applying rules of vowel length, and recognizing patterns of dactyls (long-short-short) and spondees (long-long).\n\nThe line is from Lucretius' *De Rerum Natura* and is known for being metrically complex. Here is a step-by-step scansion:\n\n1.  **Elisions**:\n    *   The \"-um\" in `verum` elides with the initial \"u\" of `ubi`.\n    *   The \"-e\" in `atque` elides with the initial \"h\" of `hominis` (the 'h' is ignored for scansion).\n\n2.  **Syllable Analysis and Foot Division**:\n\n    *   **Foot 1**: `vēr-ŭ-bĭ` — The line begins with `ver(um) ubi`. `vēr` is long by position (followed by 'r' and the 'b' from `ubi`). The syllables `u` and `bi` are both short. This forms a **Dactyl (D)**.\n\n    *   **Foot 2**: `ē-quī` — The syllable `e` in `equi`, though naturally short, is lengthened by poetic license (ictus), a common practice at the beginning of a foot to maintain the meter. The `i` is long. This forms a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n    *   **Foot 3**: `at-qu(e) hōm-` — The `at` is long by position. The `-e` of `atque` elides. The syllable `hōm-` is long by position (followed by 'm' and 'n'). This forms a **Spondee (S)**.\n\n    *   **Foot 4**: `-ĭn-īs cā-` — The syllable `-in-` from `hominis` is short. However, the following syllable `-is` is long by position (it comes before the 'c' of `casu`). The `cā-` of `casu` is long by nature. This creates a sequence of short-long-long. The foot is formed by the two long syllables, `-īs cā-`, creating a **Spondee (S)**. The initial short syllable `-in-` acts as an anacrusis, or upbeat, to the foot.\n\n    *   **Foot 5**: `sū cŏn-vĕ-nĭt` — The `-su` of `casu` is long. The word `convenit` is scanned with a long `con-` (by position) and two short syllables, `-ve-` and `-nit`. The resulting pattern `long-long-short-short` does not form a standard foot. However, the fifth foot is overwhelmingly a dactyl. In this case, `cŏn-vĕ-nĭt` forms a **Dactyl (D)**, with the preceding `-sū` serving as the end of the fourth foot.\n\n    *   **Foot 6**: `ĭ-mā-gō` — The `i-` is short, but the `a` and `o` are long. For the line to resolve into a spondee (`--`) or trochee (`-u`), the initial `i` is treated as long. This forms a **Spondee (S)**.\n\nCombining these feet gives the complete scansion.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
