    "The haiku describes the end of World War II in Japan.\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"** refers to the tumultuous events of August 1945, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which can be seen as the \"tempest\".\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"** points to August 30, 1945. On this date, General Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan to oversee the occupation and the formal surrender, heralding a period of profound change for the country.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"** refers to Japanese Emperor Hirohito. Considered a divine figure by his people, he announced Japan's surrender and later formally renounced his quasi-divine status as part of the post-war changes.\n\nThe title, \"The Bays,\" is a question pointing to the key geographical locations, or bays, central to these events. The formal surrender ceremony took place aboard the USS Missouri, which was anchored in Tokyo Bay. The atomic bombs were dropped on cities located on or near Hiroshima Bay and Nagasaki Bay. Sagami Bay was also a critical strategic location, controlling the entrance to Tokyo Bay and was the site of the last major surface action of the war. It was also a planned landing site for the Allied invasion, Operation Coronet.\n\nIn alphabetical order, the answer is:\nHiroshima Bay, Nagasaki Bay, Sagami Bay, Tokyo Bay\n\n<<<Hiroshima Bay, Nagasaki Bay, Sagami Bay, Tokyo Bay>>>"
