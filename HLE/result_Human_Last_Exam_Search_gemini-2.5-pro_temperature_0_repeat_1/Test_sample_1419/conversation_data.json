    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, specifically in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, often denoted as u* or g*, is found by calculating the one-loop beta function for the coupling constant and identifying its non-trivial zero.\n\nThe one-loop beta function, β(u), for the coupling u is given by:\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²))u²\n\nA fixed point u* is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling does not change with the energy scale. Setting β(u*) = 0, we have:\n-ϵu* + (3 / (16π²))(u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions. One is the trivial Gaussian fixed point, u* = 0. The other is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which is of interest for critical phenomena. To find it, we can divide by u* (assuming u* ≠ 0):\n-ϵ + (3 / (16π²))u* = 0\n\nSolving for u* gives the leading order expression in ϵ:\nu* = (16π² / 3)ϵ\n\nThis result is a cornerstone of the epsilon expansion, which allows for the calculation of critical exponents in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory.\n\n<<<u* = (16π² / 3)ϵ>>>"
