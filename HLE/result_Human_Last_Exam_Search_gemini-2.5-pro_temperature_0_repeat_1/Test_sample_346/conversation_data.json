    "To determine the value of `log_2(n)` for the given SKI combinator expression, we must first evaluate the expression to find the Church integer `n`.\n\nThe expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nLet's break down the expression by identifying its components and their functions in SKI combinator logic.\n\n1.  **Church Numerals**: A Church numeral `c_n` is a function that takes a function `f` and an argument `x` and applies `f` to `x` `n` times.\n    *   `c_n = λf.λx. f^n(x)`\n    *   `c_1 = λf.λx. f(x)`, which is equivalent to the `I` combinator (`Ix = x`).\n    *   `c_2 = λf.λx. f(f(x))`. In SKI, this can be written as `S(I)I`. Let's verify: `S(I)I f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x)`. This is correct.\n\n2.  **Successor Function (`succ`)**: The successor function takes a Church numeral `c_n` and returns `c_{n+1}`.\n    *   `succ = λn.λf.λx. f(n f x)`\n    *   The SKI representation for the successor function is `S(S(K S)K)`. Let's verify this reduction:\n        `S(S(K S)K) n f x = (S(S(K S)K) n) f x`\n        Since `S A B C = (A C) (B C)`, we have:\n        `= (S(K S)K f) (n f) x`\n        Now, `S(K S)K f = (K S f) (K f) = S (K f)`.\n        So, the expression becomes `(S (K f) (n f)) x`.\n        Applying the `S` rule again: `S (K f) (n f) x = (K f x) (n f x) = f (n f x)`.\n        This confirms that `succ = S(S(K S)K)`.\n\n3.  **Simplifying the Expression**: Let's substitute our defined terms back into the main expression.\n    *   Let `succ = S(S(K S)K)`.\n    *   The term `S(I)I` is `c_2`.\n    *   The term `I` is `c_1`.\n    *   The expression can be written as: `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(succ c_1))))(succ c_2))`\n    *   `succ c_1` results in `c_2`.\n    *   `succ c_2` results in `c_3`.\n    *   So, the expression simplifies to: `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K c_2)))(c_3))`\n\n4.  **Evaluating the Structure**: Let `P = S(I)`. The reduction rule for `P` is `P x y = S(I) x y = I y (x y) = y (x y)`.\n    The expression is of the form `P(A)(B)` where `A = P(P(K c_2))` and `B = c_3`.\n    This reduces to `B (A B)`, which is `c_3 ( (P(P(P(K c_2)))) c_3 )`.\n\n    Let's evaluate the argument of `c_3`, which is `X = P(P(P(K c_2))) c_3`.\n    *   `X = c_3 ( P(P(K c_2)) c_3 )`\n    *   `P(P(K c_2)) c_3 = c_3 ( P(K c_2) c_3 )`\n    *   `P(K c_2) c_3 = c_3 ( (K c_2) c_3 ) = c_3 c_2`\n    *   Substituting back, we get `P(P(K c_2)) c_3 = c_3 (c_3 c_2)`.\n    *   Substituting again, `X = c_3 (c_3 (c_3 c_2))`.\n\n    So the entire expression `n` is `c_3 (c_3 (c_3 (c_3 c_2)))`.\n\n5.  **Church Numeral Exponentiation**: When a Church numeral `c_m` is applied to another Church numeral `c_n`, the result is exponentiation: `c_m c_n = c_{n^m}`.\n    Let's verify this: `c_m c_n f = c_n(c_n(...(c_n f)...))` (`m` applications of `c_n`).\n    `c_n f = λx. f^n(x)`.\n    `c_n(c_n f) = λx. (c_n f)^n(x) = λx. (λy. f^n(y))^n(x) = λx. f^{n*n}(x) = c_{n^2} f`.\n    By induction, `(c_n)^m f = c_{n^m} f`. Thus, `c_m c_n = c_{n^m}`.\n\n6.  **Calculating n**: Now we can calculate the value of `n`.\n    *   `n = c_3 (c_3 (c_3 (c_3 c_2)))`\n    *   Innermost part: `c_3 c_2 = c_{2^3} = c_8`.\n    *   Next part: `c_3 c_8 = c_{8^3} = c_{512}`.\n    *   Next part: `c_3 c_{512} = c_{512^3}`.\n    *   Outermost part: `n = c_3 (c_{512^3}) = c_{(512^3)^3} = c_{512^9}`.\n\n    So, `n = 512^9`.\n\n7.  **Calculating log_2(n)**:\n    *   `n = 512^9 = (2^9)^9 = 2^{81}`.\n    *   `log_2(n) = log_2(2^{81}) = 81`.\n\n<<<81>>>"
