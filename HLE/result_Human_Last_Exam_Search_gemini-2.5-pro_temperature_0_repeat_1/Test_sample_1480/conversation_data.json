    "In a fuzzy inference system, the rule activation level, also known as the firing strength of the rule's consequent, is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the antecedent and the membership degree of the consequent. The antecedent firing strength is given as `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`, and the consequent membership degree is `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n\nA t-norm is a type of fuzzy logic operator that generalizes the logical AND operation. While several t-norms exist, the most common one, often used as a default in fuzzy systems, is the minimum t-norm, which takes the minimum of the values.\n\nApplying the minimum t-norm to the given values:\nRule Activation Level = T( `Phi_k(x′)`, `μG_k_j(y_j)` )\nRule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)\nRule Activation Level = 0.7\n\nOther common t-norms would yield different results. For instance, the product t-norm would result in `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`. However, without further specification, the minimum operator is the standard choice. The fact that the context is an interval type-3 fuzzy set does not alter the fundamental application of the t-norm to combine these scalar membership values.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
