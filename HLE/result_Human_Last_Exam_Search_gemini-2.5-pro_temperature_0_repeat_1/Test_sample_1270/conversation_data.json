    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" is a chemistry joke, and its name suggests a benzene ring with a substituent that looks like the Mercedes-Benz logo. A benzene ring consists of 6 carbon atoms.\n\nThe three-pointed star of the Mercedes-Benz logo can be represented in a chemically plausible way by a *tert*-butyl group. This group has a central carbon atom bonded to three other carbon atoms. This substituent would therefore contain 4 carbon atoms.\n\nTo find the total number of carbons in \"mercedesbenzene,\" you would add the carbons from the benzene ring and the carbons from the *tert*-butyl group:\n\n6 carbons (from the benzene ring) + 4 carbons (from the *tert*-butyl group) = 10 carbons.\n\n<<<10>>>"
