For a p-electron, there are two possible states for the total angular momentum, characterized by the quantum numbers j = 1/2 and j = 3/2.

For the state with j = 1/2, the common eigenvalues are:
- Eigenvalue of J²: (3/4)ħ²
- Eigenvalues of Jz: (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ

For the state with j = 3/2, the common eigenvalues are:
- Eigenvalue of J²: (15/4)ħ²
- Eigenvalues of Jz: (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, (-1/2)ħ, (-3/2)ħ
