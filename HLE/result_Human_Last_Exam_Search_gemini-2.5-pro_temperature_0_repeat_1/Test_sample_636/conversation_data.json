    "To find the state feedback gain matrix F such that the eigenvalues of A + BF are at -1 ± j, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the System Matrices:**\n    The given matrices are:\n    A = [[-1, 1],]\n    B = [,]\n\n2.  **Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial:**\n    The desired eigenvalues are λ₁ = -1 + j and λ₂ = -1 - j.\n    The characteristic polynomial for these eigenvalues is:\n    P(λ) = (λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂)\n    P(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))\n    P(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)\n    P(λ) = (λ + 1)² - (j)²\n    P(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 1 + 1\n    P(λ) = λ² + 2λ + 2\n\n3.  **Form the Closed-Loop System Matrix:**\n    Let the state feedback gain matrix be F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]].\n    The closed-loop system matrix is A_cl = A + BF.\n    First, calculate BF:\n    BF = [,] * [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]\n    Now, calculate A + BF:\n    A + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄], [f₁, f₂]]\n    A_cl = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]\n\n4.  **Find the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System:**\n    The characteristic polynomial of A_cl is given by det(λI - A_cl) = 0.\n    det(λI - A_cl) = λ² - tr(A_cl)λ + det(A_cl)\n    Where `tr(A_cl)` is the trace and `det(A_cl)` is the determinant of A_cl.\n    tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃) + f₂ = f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1\n    det(A_cl) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃)(f₂) - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁)\n\n5.  **Equate the Coefficients of the Polynomials:**\n    By comparing the coefficients of the desired polynomial (λ² + 2λ + 2) with the calculated one (λ² - tr(A_cl)λ + det(A_cl)), we get:\n    -tr(A_cl) = 2  =>  tr(A_cl) = -2\n    det(A_cl) = 2\n\n    This gives us a system of two equations:\n    1) f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ - 1 = -2  =>  **f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1**\n    2) (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃)f₂ - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁) = 2\n\n    Since we have four unknowns (f₁, f₂, f₃, f₄) and only two equations, there are infinitely many solutions. We can find one specific solution by making a simplifying assumption.\n\n6.  **Solve for a Specific F:**\n    Let's assume that the second control input is not used, which means the second row of F is zero. Let f₃ = 0 and f₄ = 0.\n    The system of equations simplifies to:\n    1) **f₁ + f₂ = -1**\n    2) (-1 + f₁)f₂ - (1 + f₂)(1 + f₁) = 2\n       -f₂ + f₁f₂ - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂) = 2\n       -f₂ + f₁f₂ - 1 - f₁ - f₂ - f₁f₂ = 2\n       -f₁ - 2f₂ - 1 = 2\n       **-f₁ - 2f₂ = 3**\n\n    Now we solve this linear system of two equations:\n    1) f₁ + f₂ = -1\n    2) -f₁ - 2f₂ = 3\n\n    Adding the two equations together:\n    (f₁ + f₂) + (-f₁ - 2f₂) = -1 + 3\n    -f₂ = 2\n    **f₂ = -2**\n\n    Substitute f₂ = -2 into the first equation:\n    f₁ + (-2) = -1\n    **f₁ = 1**\n\n    Thus, a valid state feedback gain matrix is F = [[1, -2],].\n\n7.  **Verification (Optional but Recommended):**\n    Let's check if this F gives the desired eigenvalues.\n    F = [[1, -2],]\n    A + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [,] * [[1, -2],]\n    A + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]\n    A + BF = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]\n    The characteristic equation is det(λI - (A+BF)) = 0:\n    det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ² + 2λ + 2 = 0.\n    The roots of this equation are λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8))/2 = -1 ± j. This matches the desired eigenvalues.\n\n<<<F = [[1, -2],]>>>"
