    "To determine the central pixel of a line between (1,1) and (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, one must first plot all the integer coordinates of the pixels that form the line.\n\nBresenham's algorithm is an efficient method for line drawing on a grid, using only integer addition, subtraction, and bit shifting. For the given line from (1,1) to (11,5), the algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate the differences in the x and y coordinates:**\n    *   Δx = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   Δy = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n2.  **Initialize the decision parameter:**\n    *   The initial decision parameter is calculated as p = 2Δy - Δx = 2(4) - 10 = -2.\n\n3.  **Iterate and plot the pixels:**\n    Starting from the initial point (1,1), the algorithm iteratively determines the next pixel to plot. Since Δx > Δy, the x-coordinate will always be incremented by 1. The y-coordinate is conditionally incremented based on the sign of the decision parameter.\n\nThe sequence of pixels generated is:\n*   (1, 1)\n*   (2, 1)\n*   (3, 2)\n*   (4, 2)\n*   (5, 3)\n*   **(6, 3)**\n*   (7, 3)\n*   (8, 4)\n*   (9, 4)\n*   (10, 5)\n*   (11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels in the line. The central pixel is the 6th pixel in this sequence.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).\n\n<<<**(6, 3)**>>>"
