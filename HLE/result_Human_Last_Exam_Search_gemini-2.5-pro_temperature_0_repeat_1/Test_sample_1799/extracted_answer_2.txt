It is not entirely true that the second postulate is superfluous and can be deduced from the first without additional assumptions. While the constancy of the speed of light can be derived from the first postulate if one assumes the universal validity of Maxwell's equations, a more fundamental approach shows that the first postulate alone, combined with principles of spacetime homogeneity and isotropy, allows for different possible spacetimes with different transformation laws. The second postulate serves to select the correct physical reality—the one described by Lorentz transformations with a finite invariant speed—which is then experimentally identified as the speed of light. Therefore, the second postulate is considered a crucial and independent component of the theory of special relativity.
