    "The search results confirm that there are formulas for the number of self-intersection points of Lissajous curves.\n\nFor a Lissajous curve defined by x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt) or x(t) = sin(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are integers, the number of self-intersections depends on the parity of 'a' and 'b' and whether they are coprime.\n\nIn the given problem, the curve is (cos(9t), sin(5t)). Here, a = 9 and b = 5. Both 'a' and 'b' are odd integers and are coprime (gcd(9, 5) = 1).\n\nAccording to one of the search results, for a Lissajous figure where 'a' and 'b' are both odd, the number of intersections is given by the formula (a-1)(b-1)/2. Another source provides a more complex formula for the case where both are odd, but clarifies that the figure is traced twice, and it is reasonable to claim the number of intersections is (p-1)(q-1)/2 for what appears to be a single intersection.\n\nLet's apply the simpler formula which seems to be the standard for the visual number of self-intersection points.\n\nGiven:\na = 9\nb = 5\n\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = (8)(4) / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 32 / 2\nNumber of self-intersections = 16\n\nThe formula (a-1)(b-1)/2 for odd 'a' and 'b' is consistent across multiple sources for the number of unique self-intersection points.\n\nTherefore, the number of self-intersection points for the curve (cos(9t), sin(5t)) is 16.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1.  Identify the curve as a Lissajous curve.\n2.  Identify the parameters a=9 and b=5.\n3.  Note that both are odd and coprime.\n4.  Find the appropriate formula for this case. The formula is (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n5.  Calculate the result. (9-1)(5-1)/2 = 8*4/2 = 16.\n\nThe reasoning is sound. I am ready to provide the final answer.\nThe number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t) is determined by the properties of Lissajous curves. For a Lissajous curve with parameters 'a' and 'b' that are both odd integers, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n\nIn this case, a = 9 and b = 5. Both are odd integers.\n\nUsing the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2\n= 8 * 4 / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nThus, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
