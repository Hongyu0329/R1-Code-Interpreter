    "The symmetry group of the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C₁ in Schoenflies notation. This indicates that the arrangement has no rotational or reflectional symmetry. This information is based on the comprehensive data compiled on the website \"The best known packings of equal circles in a circle\" by Eckard Specht, where for N=1135, the symmetry group field is empty, which denotes C₁ symmetry.\n\n<<<C₁>>>"
