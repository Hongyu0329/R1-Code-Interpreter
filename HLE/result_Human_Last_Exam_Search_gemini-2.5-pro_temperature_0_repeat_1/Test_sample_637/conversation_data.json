    "To design an observer for the discrete-time system such that the observation error becomes zero in the shortest possible number of steps, we need to create a deadbeat observer. This is achieved by placing all the eigenvalues of the observer error dynamics matrix at the origin.\n\nThe given system is:\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith the matrices:\nA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1],, [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]\nB = [,, [-1],]\nC = [,]\n\nThe observer dynamics are given by:\nx̂(k + 1) = Ax̂(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - C x̂(k))\n\nThe observation error e(k) = x(k) - x̂(k) evolves according to:\ne(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\nFor a deadbeat response, we need to choose the observer gain matrix L such that all eigenvalues of (A - LC) are zero. This is a pole placement problem.\n\nWe can solve this by considering the dual control problem. The observer pole placement problem for the pair (A, C) is dual to the controller pole placement problem for the pair (A', C'). The observer gain L is then given by the transpose of the controller gain K, i.e., L = K'.\n\nThe dual system matrices are:\nA' = [[-1, 1, 0, -1],,, [1, 2, -1, -1]]\nC' = [,,,]\n\nWe need to find a state-feedback gain matrix K (a 2x4 matrix) such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix (A' - C'K) are all zero. The characteristic polynomial of (A' - C'K) must be z⁴ = 0.\n\nLet K = [[k₁₁, k₁₂, k₁₃, k₁₄], [k₂₁, k₂₂, k₂₃, k₂₄]].\nThe matrix A' - C'K is calculated as:\nC'K = [[k₁₁+k₂₁, k₁₂+k₂₂, k₁₃+k₂₃, k₁₄+k₂₄],,, [k₂₁, k₂₂, k₂₃, k₂₄]]\nA' - C'K = [[-1-k₁₁-k₂₁, 1-k₁₂-k₂₂, -k₁₃-k₂₃, -1-k₁₄-k₂₄],,, [1-k₂₁, 2-k₂₂, -1-k₂₃, -1-k₂₄]]\n\nThe characteristic polynomial det(zI - (A' - C'K)) must be equal to z⁴. This gives us four equations by comparing the coefficients of the polynomial, for the eight unknown elements of K. This means we have degrees of freedom to choose a solution.\n\nA common simplification is to set one row of K to zero. Let's set the first row of K to zero, so k₁₁ = k₁₂ = k₁₃ = k₁₄ = 0. The system of equations for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial simplifies to a system of four linear equations in the four unknowns k₂₁, k₂₂, k₂₃, k₂₄:\n1.  k₂₁ + k₂₄ = -2\n2.  k₂₃ + 2k₂₄ = -3\n3.  k₂₁ + k₂₂ + 2k₂₃ = 1\n4.  -k₂₁ + 2k₂₂ = 3\n\nSolving this system of linear equations yields:\nk₂₁ = -5/11\nk₂₂ = 14/11\nk₂₃ = 1/11\nk₂₄ = -17/11\n\nThus, a valid state-feedback gain for the dual system is:\nK = [, [-5/11, 14/11, 1/11, -17/11]]\n\nThe observer gain matrix L is the transpose of K:\nL = K'\n\n<<<[[0, -5/11], [0, 14/11], [0, 1/11], [0, -17/11]]>>>"
