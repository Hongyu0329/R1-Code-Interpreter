    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nA wallpaper group is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on its symmetries. Each wallpaper group is associated with a point group, which consists of the symmetry operations of the pattern that leave at least one point fixed, such as rotations and reflections. The order of a group refers to the number of elements it contains.\n\nThe two-dimensional crystallographic point groups with an order of 2 are:\n*   **C₂**: This group contains the identity operation and a 180-degree rotation.\n*   **D₁**: This group consists of the identity operation and a single reflection.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified by their associated point groups. The wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n\n*   **p2**: This group's point group is C₂. Its patterns have 180-degree rotational symmetry but no reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm**: This group's point group is D₁. It is characterized by parallel reflection axes and no rotations.\n*   **pg**: This group's point group is also D₁. Its patterns contain only glide reflections along parallel axes.\n*   **cm**: This group also has the point group D₁. It features parallel reflection axes with glide reflection axes located halfway between them.\n\nTherefore, there are a total of four wallpaper groups (p2, pm, pg, and cm) that have a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
