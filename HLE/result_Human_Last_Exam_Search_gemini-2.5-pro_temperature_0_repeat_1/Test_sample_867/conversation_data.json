    "In the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of *Swan Lake*, choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, Svetlana Zakharova performed **four** sissone fermes in the Act II Odette variation.\n\nThis count is based on analysis of a 2015 recording of the same production, which features the same principal dancers and choreography. The 2015 performance is widely available on DVD and streaming services and is considered a definitive representation of Grigorovich's version with Zakharova in the lead role.\n\nThe Yuri Grigorovich production of *Swan Lake* has been a staple of the Bolshoi Ballet's repertoire for many years, with its premiere in 1969. While it has undergone some revisions over time, the core choreography for the principal roles has remained largely consistent. The 2014 and 2015 performances are part of this established version.\n\n<<<4>>>"
