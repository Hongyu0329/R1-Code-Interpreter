    "The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is denoted as `a₂`. The spectral action is given by the trace of a function of the squared Dirac operator, `Tr(f(D²/Λ²))`, where `D` is the gauged Dirac operator and `Λ` is a cutoff scale. The asymptotic expansion of this action for large `Λ` is determined by the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients of the operator `D²`.\n\nThe operator `D²` is a Laplacian-type operator. For a massless Dirac spinor `ψ` in `d` dimensions, the Dirac operator coupled to a gauge field `A` is `D = iγ^μ(∂_μ + ω_μ + A_μ)`, where `γ^μ` are the Dirac matrices, `ω_μ` is the spin connection, and `A_μ` is the gauge connection. Its square can be written as `D² = - (∇² + E)`, where `∇` is the full covariant derivative on spinors and `E` is an endomorphism given by:\n`E = (1/4)R - (1/2)σ^{μν}F_{μν}`\nHere, `R` is the scalar curvature, `σ^{μν} = (i/2)[γ^μ, γ^ν]`, and `F_{μν}` is the field strength of the gauge field.\n\nThe Seeley-DeWitt coefficients, `a_n(x)`, are local invariants constructed from the curvature of the manifold and the gauge field. The second coefficient, `a₂(x)`, for a general second-order operator of the form `-g^{μν}∇_μ∇_ν - E` in four dimensions is given by:\n`a₂(x) = (1/360) (R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ} - R_{μν}R^{μν} - R_{;μ}^{;μ}) tr(I) + (1/12) tr(Ω_{μν}Ω^{μν}) + (1/2) tr(E²) + (1/6) R tr(E)`\nwhere `R_{μνρσ}` is the Riemann curvature tensor, `R_{μν}` is the Ricci tensor, `Ω_{μν}` is the curvature of the full connection `∇`, and `tr` denotes the trace over the spinor and gauge indices.\n\nFor a massless gauged Dirac spinor field in four dimensions, after performing the trace over the spinor indices, the coefficient `a₂` is found to be:\n`a₂(x) = - (1/12) tr(F_{μν}F^{μν}) + (1/240) (11R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ} - 26R_{μν}R^{μν} + 5R²) tr_V(I)`\nwhere `tr` now indicates the trace over the gauge group indices only, and `tr_V(I)` is the dimension of the gauge group representation.\n\n<<<The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field, `a₂`, is given by the integral of a local density `a₂(x)` over the manifold. In four dimensions, the trace of this density is:\n`Tr(a₂(x)) = C₁ tr(F_{μν}F^{μν}) + C₂ (R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ}) tr_V(I) + C₃ (R_{μν}R^{μν}) tr_V(I) + C₄ R² tr_V(I)`\nwhere `F_{μν}` is the gauge field strength, `R_{μνρσ}`, `R_{μν}`, and `R` are the Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, and Ricci scalar respectively, and `tr_V(I)` is the dimension of the representation space of the gauge group. The exact values of the coefficients `C₁, C₂, C₃, C₄` can vary depending on the conventions used in the heat kernel expansion. A commonly cited result is:\n`a₂(x) = - (1/12) tr(F_{μν}F^{μν}) + (1/240) (11R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ} - 26R_{μν}R^{μν} + 5R²) tr_V(I)`>>>"
