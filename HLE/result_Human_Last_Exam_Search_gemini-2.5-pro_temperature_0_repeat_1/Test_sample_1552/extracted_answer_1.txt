The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field, `a₂`, is given by the integral of a local density `a₂(x)` over the manifold. In four dimensions, the trace of this density is:
`Tr(a₂(x)) = C₁ tr(F_{μν}F^{μν}) + C₂ (R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ}) tr_V(I) + C₃ (R_{μν}R^{μν}) tr_V(I) + C₄ R² tr_V(I)`
where `F_{μν}` is the gauge field strength, `R_{μνρσ}`, `R_{μν}`, and `R` are the Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, and Ricci scalar respectively, and `tr_V(I)` is the dimension of the representation space of the gauge group. The exact values of the coefficients `C₁, C₂, C₃, C₄` can vary depending on the conventions used in the heat kernel expansion. A commonly cited result is:
`a₂(x) = - (1/12) tr(F_{μν}F^{μν}) + (1/240) (11R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ} - 26R_{μν}R^{μν} + 5R²) tr_V(I)`
