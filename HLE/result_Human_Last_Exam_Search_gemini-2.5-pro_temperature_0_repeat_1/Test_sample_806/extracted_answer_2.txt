The specific biochemical reaction that initiated the skin blisters was a T-cell mediated cytotoxic response to the medication, which caused the release of the protein granulysin from immune cells. Granulysin then induced widespread programmed cell death (apoptosis) of keratinocytes, leading to the separation of the epidermis from the dermis and the formation of blisters.
