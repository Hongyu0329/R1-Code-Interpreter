The optimal feedback adjustment factor is given by the piecewise function:
\[
b = 
\begin{cases} 
-P_1\alpha & \text{if } P_1^2\alpha^2 \le P_2 \\
-\text{sign}(\alpha)\sqrt{P_2} & \text{if } P_1^2\alpha^2 > P_2 
\end{cases}
\]
where \(P_1\) is the power of the first transmission, \(P_2\) is the power of the second transmission, and \(\alpha\) is the noise correlation coefficient.
