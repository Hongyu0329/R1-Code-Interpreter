    "A finite group G is called a **filled group** if all of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets fill the group. A product-free set S is a non-empty subset of G such that the product of any two elements in S is not in S. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. S fills G if every non-identity element of G is either in S or is a product of two elements from S.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups is known and can be broken down into groups of odd order and 2-groups. A key result states that a finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if it is isomorphic to C₃, C₅, or a filled 2-group.\n\nThe finite filled nilpotent groups are as follows:\n\n### Abelian Filled Nilpotent Groups\n\nThe finite abelian filled groups were classified by Street and Whitehead. A finite abelian group is filled if and only if it is one of the following:\n*   **C₃**: The cyclic group of order 3.\n*   **C₅**: The cyclic group of order 5.\n*   **Elementary abelian 2-groups**: These are groups isomorphic to the direct product of one or more copies of the cyclic group of order 2, denoted as (C₂)ⁿ for n ≥ 1. This includes C₂ and C₂ × C₂ (which is isomorphic to the dihedral group D₄).\n\n### Non-Abelian Filled Nilpotent Groups\n\nAll non-abelian filled nilpotent groups are 2-groups. The classification of these groups has also been established:\n\n*   **D₈**: The dihedral group of order 8. It is the only non-abelian dihedral group that is filled.\n*   **D₈ × C₂**: The direct product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 2.\n*   **D₈ ∗ Q₈**: The central product of the dihedral group of order 8 and the quaternion group of order 8. This is an extraspecial group of order 32.\n*   **(D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂**: The direct product of the central product D₈ ∗ Q₈ and the cyclic group of order 2.\n\nIt is important to note that the **quaternion group Q₈** itself is **not** a filled group. In fact, no generalized quaternion group is filled.\n\nIn summary, the finite filled nilpotent groups are precisely the groups listed above.\n\n<<<The finite filled nilpotent groups are the cyclic groups C₃ and C₅, the elementary abelian 2-groups (C₂)ⁿ for n ≥ 1, the dihedral group D₈, and the groups D₈ × C₂, D₈ ∗ Q₈, and (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂.>>>"
