    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, corresponds to a Galois connection between posets. The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite ordinals $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, and the morphisms are order-preserving maps. A 2-morphism between two parallel maps $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$ exists if and only if $f(x) \\le g(x)$ for all $x \\in [m]$.\n\nAn adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, a left adjoint $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and a right adjoint $R: [n] \\to [m]$, satisfying the equivalence:\n$L(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le R(y)$ for all $x \\in [m]$ and $y \\in [n]$.\n\nThere is a one-to-one correspondence between such adjunctions and the left adjoint maps $L$, and also a one-to-one correspondence with the right adjoint maps $R$. We can, therefore, count the number of possible left adjoints $L: \\to$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). In the context of the poset $[m]$, the join of the empty set is the minimum element, 0. For $L$ to preserve this join, it must map the minimum element of its domain to the minimum element of its codomain, i.e., $L(0) = 0$. Conversely, any order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ with $L(0)=0$ is a left adjoint.\n\nThus, we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: \\to$ that satisfy the condition $L(0) = 0$. An order-preserving map is defined by the sequence of its values:\n$L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$.\nThe domain of these values is $$, so $0 \\le L(i) \\le 37$ for all $i \\in$.\n\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value in the sequence. We are left with determining the sequence:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is equivalent to choosing 23 values ($L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from the set $ = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter as they will be arranged into a non-decreasing sequence. This is a classic stars-and-bars problem. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ with replacement is given by the multiset coefficient $\\left(\\!\\!{n \\choose k}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{n+k-1}{k}$.\n\nIn our case, we are choosing $k=23$ values for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ from a set of $n=38$ possible values $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{38 + 23 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the number of right adjoints $R: \\to$. An order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). The meet of the empty set in $[n]$ is the maximum element, $n$. For $R$ to preserve this meet, it must map the maximum element of its domain to the maximum element of its codomain, i.e., $R(n)=m$.\n\nSo we need to count the number of order-preserving maps $R: \\to$ with $R(37)=23$. This requires choosing the values for $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ such that:\n$0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$.\nThis is equivalent to choosing $k=37$ values from a set of $n=24$ possible values $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\nThe number of such maps is:\n$\\binom{24 + 37 - 1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we can see that the two results are identical:\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot 37!} = 47,331,548,128,833,600$.\n\n<<<47331548128833600>>>"
