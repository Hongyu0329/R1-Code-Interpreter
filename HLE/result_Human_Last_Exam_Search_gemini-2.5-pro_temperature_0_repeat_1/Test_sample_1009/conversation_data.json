    "I have gathered information about the definitions of compact, first-countable, and non-Hausdorff topological groups, as well as the definition of the weight of a topological space. I have also found some key theorems relating these properties.\n\nHere's a summary of what I've learned:\n- A topological space is first-countable if every point has a countable local basis of open sets.\n- The weight of a topological space is the smallest cardinality of a base for the topology.\n- A topological group is regular, even if it is not Hausdorff.\n- For a compact Hausdorff space X, it is known that w(X) ≤ |X|.\n- For a topological group G, the weight w(G) is related to its density d(G) and character χ(G) by the formula w(G) = d(G)χ(G).\n- The character of a first-countable space is countable (ℵ₀).\n- The density of a space is at most its cardinality.\n\nHowever, the initial searches did not directly address the case of a *non-Hausdorff* compact topological group. The relationship w(G) ≤ |G| is stated for *Hausdorff* compact groups. The failure of the Hausdorff property might allow for a larger weight. I need to investigate how the non-Hausdorff property affects the relationship between cardinality and weight in a compact, first-countable topological group. Specifically, I need to determine if the inequality |G| ≤ 2^w(G) still holds and how the density d(G) is constrained in this context.I have gathered more information, particularly regarding cardinal invariants in topological groups and non-Hausdorff spaces. Here's a summary of the key findings:\n\n- For a topological group G, a fundamental relation is w(G) = d(G)χ(G), where w(G) is the weight, d(G) is the density, and χ(G) is the character.\n- Since G is first-countable, its character χ(G) is countable (ℵ₀).\n- For any topological space, the density d(X) is less than or equal to its cardinality |X|.\n- For a *Hausdorff* compact group K, |K| = 2^w(K).\n- For a regular space X, which includes all topological groups (even non-Hausdorff ones), we have the inequality |X| ≤ 2^w(X).\n- A non-Hausdorff number, nh(X), has been introduced to generalize cardinality bounds. For any topological space X, |X| ≤ d(X)χ(X) * nh(X).\n- For a Hausdorff space, nh(X) = 2.\n\nThe crucial pieces of information are the relationships w(G) = d(G)χ(G) and |G| ≤ 2^w(G). The first-countability of G implies χ(G) = ℵ₀. The non-Hausdorff property is where the nuance lies. While for Hausdorff compact groups, there's a precise equality |K| = 2^w(K), for regular spaces in general, we have the inequality |G| ≤ 2^w(G). The cardinality of the group G is given as 2^(2^𝔠).\n\nLet's try to combine these facts. We have w(G) = d(G)χ(G) = d(G)ℵ₀ = d(G). Also, d(G) ≤ |G|. Therefore, w(G) ≤ |G| = 2^(2^𝔠).\n\nWe also have the inequality |G| ≤ 2^w(G). So, 2^(2^𝔠) ≤ 2^w(G), which implies w(G) ≥ 2^𝔠.\n\nThis gives us a range for the weight: 2^𝔠 ≤ w(G) ≤ 2^(2^𝔠).\n\nTo determine the *largest possible* weight, I need to investigate if a compact, first-countable, non-Hausdorff topological group G can have a weight equal to its cardinality. The existence of such a group would mean the upper bound is achievable. I will search for examples of non-Hausdorff topological groups to see if there are constructions that would lead to w(G) = |G|. Specifically, I'll look for constructions where the density can be maximized.I have gathered substantial information about cardinal invariants in topological groups, including both Hausdorff and non-Hausdorff cases. The key relationships identified are:\n\n1.  For any topological group G, even non-Hausdorff, the weight w(G), density d(G), and character χ(G) are related by the formula w(G) = d(G)χ(G).\n2.  Since the group G in the question is first-countable, its character χ(G) is countable (ℵ₀). Therefore, w(G) = d(G).\n3.  For any topological space, the density is at most its cardinality, so d(G) ≤ |G|. This implies w(G) ≤ |G|.\n4.  For a regular space, which includes all topological groups, the cardinality is bounded by its weight: |X| ≤ 2^w(X).\n5.  The cardinality of the group G is given as 2^(2^𝔠).\n\nFrom these points, we can establish the following inequalities:\n\n*   From w(G) = d(G) and d(G) ≤ |G|, we have w(G) ≤ |G| = 2^(2^𝔠).\n*   From |G| ≤ 2^w(G), we have 2^(2^𝔠) ≤ 2^w(G), which implies w(G) ≥ 2^𝔠.\n\nSo, the weight of the group G must be in the range [2^𝔠, 2^(2^𝔠)].\n\nTo determine the *largest possible* weight, we need to see if a group with the given properties can have a weight equal to its cardinality. Let's consider a construction. Let A be any abstract group of cardinality 2^(2^𝔠). We can endow A with the indiscrete topology, where the only open sets are the empty set and the entire group A.\n\nLet's check if this group G = (A, {∅, A}) satisfies the conditions:\n*   **Topological group:** The group operations (multiplication and inversion) are continuous. Since the codomain of these operations is G, and the only non-empty open set is G itself, any function into G is continuous. So, this is a topological group.\n*   **Compact:** Any open cover of G must contain G itself, which is a finite subcover. So, G is compact.\n*   **First-countable:** For any point x in G, the only open set containing x is G itself. The collection {G} is a countable local base for x. So, G is first-countable.\n*   **Cardinality:** The cardinality is |A| = 2^(2^𝔠).\n*   **Non-Hausdorff:** Since there are no disjoint non-empty open sets, the space is not Hausdorff (as long as |A| > 1).\n\nNow, let's determine the weight of this group G. The weight is the smallest cardinality of a base for the topology. The topology is {∅, G}. A base for this topology must be able to generate G. The smallest such base is {G}, which has cardinality 1. However, by convention, the weight of a non-discrete space is at least ℵ₀. Even with this convention, the weight would be ℵ₀. This construction does not yield a large weight.\n\nLet's reconsider the relationship w(G) = d(G). The density of the indiscrete group is 1 (any single point is dense). This is why the weight is small. To maximize the weight, we need to maximize the density.\n\nConsider a different topology. Let A be a group of cardinality κ = 2^(2^𝔠). Let the topology on A be the cofinite topology. This is also a non-Hausdorff, compact, first-countable space. However, constructing a group topology with the cofinite topology is not straightforward.\n\nLet's go back to the fundamental inequality |G| ≤ 2^w(G). We are looking for the *largest possible* weight. The upper bound we've established is w(G) ≤ |G| = 2^(2^𝔠). Is it possible to construct a group G that satisfies the conditions and for which w(G) = |G|?\n\nConsider a group G with the discrete topology. This is a first-countable topological group. However, it is not compact unless it is finite.\n\nLet's consider a product construction. Let K be a compact Hausdorff group of weight 2^𝔠 and cardinality 2^(2^𝔠) (for instance, the product of 2^𝔠 copies of a simple compact group). Let S be the Sierpiński space, which is compact and first-countable but not Hausdorff. The product G = K × S is a compact, first-countable, non-Hausdorff topological group. Its cardinality is |K| * |S| = 2^(2^𝔠) * 2 = 2^(2^𝔠). The weight of the product is w(K) + w(S) = 2^𝔠 + 2 = 2^𝔠. This gives a possible weight of 2^𝔠, which is the lower bound we found.\n\nTo get the largest possible weight, we need to maximize the density. Let G be a group of cardinality κ = 2^(2^𝔠). Let's try to define a topology on G that makes it a compact, first-countable, non-Hausdorff topological group with the largest possible weight.\n\nThe key seems to be that for a non-Hausdorff group, the weight can be larger relative to the cardinality than in the Hausdorff case. The inequality |X| ≤ 2^w(X) is a general result for regular spaces. The question is whether there exists a group G with the given properties where the weight w(G) can be as large as its cardinality, |G|.\n\nLet's assume such a group G exists. Then w(G) = d(G) and d(G) ≤ |G| = 2^(2^𝔠). So the weight is at most 2^(2^𝔠).\n\nConsider an abstract group A of cardinality 2^(2^𝔠). Let the topology be generated by a basis of size 2^(2^𝔠). We need to ensure this forms a compact, first-countable, non-Hausdorff topological group.\n\nLet's revisit the known inequalities. For any topological group G, |G| ≤ 2^(w(G)χ(G)). Since G is first-countable, χ(G) = ℵ₀. So, |G| ≤ 2^(w(G)ℵ₀) = 2^w(G). We are given |G| = 2^(2^𝔠). Thus, 2^(2^𝔠) ≤ 2^w(G), which implies w(G) ≥ 2^𝔠.\n\nWe also have w(G) = d(G)χ(G) = d(G)ℵ₀ = d(G). And d(G) ≤ |G|. So, w(G) ≤ |G| = 2^(2^𝔠).\n\nThe possible range for the weight is [2^𝔠, 2^(2^𝔠)]. The question asks for the *largest possible* weight. Without a specific construction of a group that achieves the upper bound, it is difficult to definitively say that 2^(2^𝔠) is attainable. However, in the absence of a theorem that places a stricter upper bound on the weight of a non-Hausdorff compact first-countable group, the theoretical maximum from the general inequality w(G) ≤ |G| is the most likely answer.\n\nLet's consider if there's any reason why the weight *must* be smaller than the cardinality in this case. The non-Hausdorff property generally allows for \"more\" points relative to the number of open sets (i.e., smaller weight for a given cardinality) or, conversely, requires \"more\" open sets to distinguish points (larger weight).\n\nGiven the fundamental inequality w(G) ≤ |G| for any topological group where w(G) = d(G), and the fact that we are looking for the *largest possible* weight, the upper bound of the cardinality itself is the most plausible answer. There are no general theorems found that would restrict this further for non-Hausdorff groups.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible weight is the cardinality of the group.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning:\n1. G is a topological group, so it is regular.\n2. G is first-countable, so χ(G) = ℵ₀.\n3. The relation w(G) = d(G)χ(G) holds for topological groups. Thus, w(G) = d(G).\n4. The density d(G) is at most the cardinality |G|. So, w(G) ≤ |G|.\n5. The cardinality is given as |G| = 2^(2^𝔠).\n6. Therefore, the weight is at most 2^(2^𝔠).\n7. To show this is the largest *possible* weight, we would ideally construct such a group. While a simple concrete construction is not immediately obvious, there is no known theorem that would force the weight to be strictly smaller than the cardinality for a non-Hausdorff compact group. The question asks for the largest *possible* weight, which implies we should consider the theoretical maximum unless proven impossible.\n\nThe largest possible value for the weight is its cardinality.Let G be a compact, first-countable topological group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ that may fail to be Hausdorff. We want to determine the largest possible weight of this group.\n\nFirst, let's recall the definitions of the key terms:\n*   **Topological Group:** A group G equipped with a topology such that the group operation and the inversion map are continuous. An important property of all topological groups is that they are regular spaces, even if they are not Hausdorff.\n*   **First-Countable:** A topological space is first-countable if every point has a countable local base of open neighborhoods. The character of a space X, denoted χ(X), is the minimum cardinality of a local base at any point. For a first-countable space, χ(X) = ℵ₀.\n*   **Compact:** A topological space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover.\n*   **Weight of a topological space:** The weight of a topological space X, denoted w(X), is the minimum cardinality of a basis for the topology on X.\n*   **Density of a topological space:** The density of a space X, denoted d(X), is the minimum cardinality of a dense subset of X.\n\nFor any topological group G, there is a fundamental relationship between its weight, density, and character, given by the formula of Arhangel'skii:\nw(G) = d(G) * χ(G)\n\nSince the group G is given to be first-countable, its character is countable, i.e., χ(G) = ℵ₀. Substituting this into the formula, we get:\nw(G) = d(G) * ℵ₀ = d(G)\n\nThe density of any topological space is at most its cardinality. Therefore, for our group G:\nd(G) ≤ |G|\n\nThis implies that the weight of G is also at most its cardinality:\nw(G) ≤ |G|\n\nThe cardinality of G is given as $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Thus, the weight of G is bounded above by this value:\n$w(G) \\le 2^{2^\\frak c}$\n\nNow, we need to determine if this upper bound can be achieved. For any regular space X (which includes all topological groups), the following inequality, also due to Arhangel'skii, holds:\n|X| ≤ 2^(w(X) * χ(X))\n\nAgain, since G is first-countable, χ(G) = ℵ₀. Therefore:\n$|G| \\le 2^{w(G) \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{w(G)}$\n\nWe are given the cardinality of G, so we can substitute that into the inequality:\n$2^{2^\\frak c} \\le 2^{w(G)}$\n\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides gives:\n$2^\\frak c \\le w(G)$\n\nCombining our findings, we have established a range for the weight of G:\n$2^\\frak c \\le w(G) \\le 2^{2^\\frak c}$\n\nThe question asks for the largest *possible* weight. The upper bound is the cardinality of the group itself, $2^{2^\\frak c}$. While for compact *Hausdorff* groups, the weight is strictly smaller than the cardinality (specifically, $|K| = 2^{w(K)}$ for an infinite compact Hausdorff group K), this restriction does not necessarily apply to non-Hausdorff groups. The failure of the Hausdorff property can allow for a topology where the weight is as large as the cardinality.\n\nTo confirm that this upper bound is possible, one would need to construct a topological group G with the given properties and with weight equal to its cardinality. While a concrete, standard example is not readily available in the search results, there is no theorem cited that would impose a stricter upper bound on the weight of a compact, first-countable, non-Hausdorff topological group than its cardinality. In the absence of such a constraining theorem, the largest possible weight is the maximum value allowed by the general inequalities.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible weight of the group G is its cardinality.\n\n<<<2^(2^frak c)>>>"
