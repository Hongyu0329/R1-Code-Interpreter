    "The search results confirm the structure of the generalized quaternion group Q_128 and some of its properties.\n- Q_128 has order 128.\n- It can be defined by the presentation Q_2^n = <x, y | x^(2^(n-1)) = 1, x^(2^(n-2)) = y^2, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1)>. For Q_128, n=7, so the presentation is <x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1)>. This matches my initial setup.\n- The subgroup <x> is cyclic of order 64.\n- Every element outside of <x> has order 4.\n- The commutator subgroup is <x^2>.\n- The center is {1, x^32}.\n\nMy derivation of the power subgroups depended on calculating G^k = <g^k | g in G>.\nLet's review the calculation.\nElements g are either x^i or x^i*y.\n\nIf k is odd:\n(x^i)^k generates <x^k> = <x^gcd(k,64)> = <x> since gcd(k,64)=1.\n(x^i*y)^k = x^(i(1-k)/2) * (x^i*y) if we use a different formula, let's stick to my previous derivation which was simpler.\n(x^i*y)^2 = x^32.\nIf k = 2m+1 (odd), (x^i*y)^k = ((x^i*y)^2)^m * (x^i*y) = (x^32)^m * (x^i*y) = x^(32m) * x^i * y.\nThe set of generators for G^k is {x^(ik)} and {x^(32m+i)*y}.\nSince k is odd, <x^k> = <x>, so x is in G^k.\nThis implies <x> is a subgroup of G^k.\nFrom the generators {x^(32m+i)*y}, if we take i=0, we get x^(32m)*y.\nSince x^(32m) is in <x> and thus in G^k, y must be in G^k.\nTherefore, for any odd k, G^k = <x, y> = G. This gives one power subgroup.\n\nIf k is even:\nLet k = 2m.\n(x^i)^k = x^(2im). These generate <x^(2m)> = <x^gcd(2m, 64)>.\n(x^i*y)^k = ((x^i*y)^2)^m = (x^32)^m = x^(32m).\nSo G^k = < <x^(2m)>, x^(32m) >.\nSince 32m is a multiple of 2m, x^(32m) is an element of <x^(2m)>.\nThus, G^k = <x^(2m)> = <x^gcd(2m, 64)>.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of distinct subgroups of the form <x^d> where d = gcd(2m, 64) for some integer m.\nThe divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\nd = gcd(2m, 64) = 2 * gcd(m, 32).\nThis means d must be an even divisor of 64.\nThe even divisors of 64 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\nLet's see if we can form all of them:\n- d=2: m=1, gcd(2, 64) = 2. Subgroup is <x^2>.\n- d=4: m=2, gcd(4, 64) = 4. Subgroup is <x^4>.\n- d=8: m=4, gcd(8, 64) = 8. Subgroup is <x^8>.\n- d=16: m=8, gcd(16, 64) = 16. Subgroup is <x^16>.\n- d=32: m=16, gcd(32, 64) = 32. Subgroup is <x^32>.\n- d=64: m=32, gcd(64, 64) = 64. Subgroup is <x^64> = {1}.\n\nSo for even k, we get 6 distinct power subgroups. These are the cyclic subgroups of <x> of orders 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1.\n\nThe total set of power subgroups is { G, <x^2>, <x^4>, <x^8>, <x^16>, <x^32>, {1} }.\nThese are 7 distinct subgroups.\n\nThe logic seems sound and consistent. The search results confirm the underlying group structure which the derivation is based on. I haven't found a direct source stating the number of power subgroups, but the derivation from first principles is robust.\n\nFinal check:\n- Power subgroups for odd k: G. (1 subgroup)\n- Power subgroups for even k: <x^d> where d is an even divisor of 64. The even divisors are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. This gives 6 distinct subgroups.\n- Total = 1 + 6 = 7.\n\nThe reasoning holds. I am ready to give the final answer.\nThe generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted by Q_128. It is given by the presentation:\nQ_128 = <x, y | x^64 = 1, x^32 = y^2, yxy^(-1) = x^(-1)>\n\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H such that H = G^k = <g^k | g âˆˆ G> for some integer k.\n\nWe analyze the generators of G^k based on whether k is odd or even.\n\n1.  **k is odd:**\n    The generators of G^k are of the form (x^i)^k and (x^j y)^k.\n    - (x^i)^k = x^(ik). Since k is odd, gcd(k, 64) = 1. The subgroup generated by these elements is <x^k> = <x>.\n    - (x^j y)^2 = x^j y x^j y = x^j (y x^j y^(-1)) y^2 = x^j (x^(-j)) x^32 = x^32.\n    - If k = 2m + 1, then (x^j y)^k = ((x^j y)^2)^m (x^j y) = (x^32)^m x^j y = x^(32m+j) y.\n    Since <x> is in G^k, x^(32m+j) is also in G^k. For G^k to contain x^(32m+j) y, it must also contain y.\n    Therefore, G^k contains both x and y, which means G^k = <x, y> = Q_128.\n    So, for any odd integer k, the power subgroup is the group Q_128 itself. This gives one power subgroup.\n\n2.  **k is even:**\n    Let k = 2m.\n    - (x^i)^k = x^(ik) = x^(2im). These elements generate the subgroup <x^(2m)> = <x^gcd(2m, 64)>.\n    - (x^j y)^k = (x^j y)^(2m) = ((x^j y)^2)^m = (x^32)^m = x^(32m).\n    So, G^k is generated by <x^(2m)> and x^(32m). Since 32m is a multiple of 2m, the element x^(32m) is already in the subgroup <x^(2m)>.\n    Thus, G^k = <x^(2m)> = <x^gcd(2m, 64)>.\n\n    We need to find the number of distinct subgroups generated this way. Let d = gcd(2m, 64).\n    Since d = 2 * gcd(m, 32), d must be an even divisor of 64.\n    The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\n    The even divisors of 64 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\n    For each even divisor d, we can find an m such that d = gcd(2m, 64).\n    - d=2: m=1, gcd(2, 64)=2. This gives the subgroup <x^2>.\n    - d=4: m=2, gcd(4, 64)=4. This gives the subgroup <x^4>.\n    - d=8: m=4, gcd(8, 64)=8. This gives the subgroup <x^8>.\n    - d=16: m=8, gcd(16, 64)=16. This gives the subgroup <x^16>.\n    - d=32: m=16, gcd(32, 64)=32. This gives the subgroup <x^32>.\n    - d=64: m=32, gcd(64, 64)=64. This gives the subgroup <x^64> = {1} (the trivial subgroup).\n\n    These 6 subgroups are all distinct cyclic subgroups of Q_128.\n\nCombining both cases, the set of power subgroups of Q_128 is:\n{ Q_128, <x^2>, <x^4>, <x^8>, <x^16>, <x^32>, {1} }\n\nThere are a total of 1 + 6 = 7 power subgroups.\n<<<7>>>"
