    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is the 1997 Italian film **\"Life is Beautiful\" (original title: \"La vita è bella\")**.\n\nIn a pivotal and deeply ironic scene, Guido Orefice and his son Giosuè, along with other Jewish Italians, are being deported to a concentration camp. As they are being forced onto a truck (often misremembered as a bus), a German officer callously offers a ride to the women and children. Unaware of the horrific truth of their destination, and in a moment that underscores his naive and optimistic nature, Guido's friend is tricked into thinking this is a kind gesture. As he helps his wife and daughter board, he politely says \"Thank you\" to the Nazi officer. This simple act of courtesy, in the face of such inhumanity, tragically seals his and his family's fate as they are transported to their deaths.\n\n\"Life is Beautiful\" was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won three, including Best Foreign Language Film, Best Actor for Roberto Benigni, and Best Original Dramatic Score. The scene is a powerful and heartbreaking example of the film's central theme of maintaining one's humanity and innocence in the midst of unimaginable horror.\n\n<<<Life is Beautiful>>>"
