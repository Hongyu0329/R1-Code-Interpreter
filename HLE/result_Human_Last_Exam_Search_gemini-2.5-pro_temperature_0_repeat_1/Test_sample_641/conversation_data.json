    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997) is a detailed calculation in the theory of finite classical groups. An involution is an element of order 2. For the group PSU(4, 997), we are considering matrices over a finite field with 997² elements.\n\nThe number of involutions in PSU(n, q) depends on the structure of the underlying special unitary group SU(n, q) and its center. For PSU(4, 997), we have n=4 and q=997. Since q = 997 is a prime, the characteristic of the field is 997, which is odd.\n\nThe involutions in PSU(4, q) are the images of elements `g` in SU(4, q) for which `g²` is in the center of SU(4, q). The center of SU(4, q) consists of scalar matrices `cI` where `c` is an element of the field of `q²` elements such that `c⁴=1` and `c^(q+1)=1`. For q=997, the center has order `gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. Thus, the center is `{I, -I}`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\n\nThis means the involutions in PSU(4, 997) correspond to elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g² = I` or `g² = -I`.\n\nA key factor in the calculation is whether `q` is congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4. Here, `997 = 4 * 249 + 1`, so `q ≡ 1 (mod 4)`. In this case, it can be shown that there are no elements `g` in the general unitary group GU(n, q), and therefore none in SU(n, q), such that `g² = -I`.\n\nConsequently, we only need to count the elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g² = I`. These are the true involutions in SU(4, 997). Apart from the identity matrix `I`, these involutions are semisimple matrices whose eigenvalues are +1 and -1. For the determinant to be 1, the number of -1 eigenvalues must be even. In SU(4, q), this means an involution (other than the identity) can have eigenvalues `{1, 1, -1, -1}` or `{-1, -1, -1, -1}`.\n*   The case `{-1, -1, -1, -1}` corresponds to the single element `-I`.\n*   The elements with eigenvalues `{1, 1, -1, -1}` form a single conjugacy class in SU(4, q).\n\nThe set of elements in SU(4, q) whose square is `I` consists of the identity `I`, the central element `-I`, and the conjugacy class of involutions with eigenvalues `{1, 1, -1, -1}`. The non-trivial involutions in PSU(4, q) arise from the elements of this conjugacy class.\n\nThe size of this conjugacy class is given by the formula `q⁴(q² - q + 1)(q² + 1)`. The total number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is the size of this single conjugacy class of involutions.\n\nTherefore, the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is:\n\n`997⁴ * (997² - 997 + 1) * (997² + 1)`\n\nExpanding this, we get the formula:\n\n`q⁸ + q⁶ - q⁵ + q⁴`\n\nSubstituting q = 997, the number is `997⁸ + 997⁶ - 997⁵ + 997⁴`.\n\n<<<997⁸ + 997⁶ - 997⁵ + 997⁴>>>"
