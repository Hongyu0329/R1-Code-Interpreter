    "The search results confirm my initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **Formula for the number of maximal tori:** Several sources implicitly confirm that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a finite group of Lie type $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|/|T(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$ where $T$ is a split maximal torus. This is a classical result.\n\n2.  **Group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$:** The search results confirm that for a finite field $k$, any algebraic group of type $E_8$ is split. This is because the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, which implies that the first Galois cohomology set $H^1(k, \\text{Aut}(E_8))$ is trivial. Therefore, the group $G$ is the Chevalley group $E_8(q)$.\n\n3.  **Order of $E_8(q)$:** The order of $E_8(q)$ is given by the formula $|E_8(q)| = q^{120} \\prod_{i=1}^8 (q^{d_i}-1)$, where $d_i$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group of $E_8$.\n\n4.  **Degrees of invariants for $E_8$:** The degrees of the fundamental invariants for the Weyl group of $E_8$ are 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30.\n\n5.  **Order of a split maximal torus:** A split maximal torus $T$ of rank $r$ has $|T(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^r$. For $E_8$, the rank is $r=8$.\n\nSo, all the pieces of the calculation are confirmed.\n\n*   $G(\\mathbb{F}_q) = E_8(q)$\n*   $|E_8(q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)$\n*   $T$ is a split maximal torus of rank 8.\n*   $|T(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^8$\n*   Number of tori = $\\frac{|E_8(q)|}{|T(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} = \\frac{q^{120} \\prod_{i=1}^8 (q^{d_i}-1)}{(q-1)^8}$\n\nThe calculation is straightforward from here. I will write down the final answer.\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula:\n$$ N = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|T(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\nwhere $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$, and $T$ is a split maximal torus of $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the group is split over any finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, so $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the Chevalley group $E_8(q)$. The rank of $E_8$ is 8.\n\nThe order of the group $E_8(q)$ is:\n$$ |E_8(q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1) $$\nThe numbers 2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30 are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group of $E_8$. The exponent 120 is the number of positive roots in the $E_8$ root system.\n\nA split maximal torus $T$ of rank 8 has a group of rational points $T(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times)^8$, so its order is:\n$$ |T(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^8 $$\n\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n$$ N = \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8} $$\nThis can be written as:\n$$ N = q^{120} \\left(\\frac{q^2-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^8-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{12}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{14}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{18}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{20}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{24}-1}{q-1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{q^{30}-1}{q-1}\\right) $$\nUsing the identity $\\frac{q^d-1}{q-1} = \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} q^i$, the expression can be expanded into a polynomial in $q$. The question asks for the \"exact number\", and this formula provides it as a function of $q$.\n\nFinal check of all components. Everything seems correct and well-supported by the search results.\n\nFinal answer format is <<<answer content>>>. I will provide the formula as the answer.\nThe final answer is the formula I derived.\n$q^{120} (q+1) (q^7+q^6+\\dots+1) (q^{11}+\\dots+1) \\dots (q^{29}+\\dots+1)$.\nI will write it in the more compact product form.\n\nFinal answer seems ready.\n<<<The exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the expression:\n$$ \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8} $$\nThis can also be written as the polynomial in $q$:\n$$ q^{120} \\prod_{i \\in \\{2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30\\}} \\frac{q^i-1}{q-1} $$\n>>>\nThis looks good. I will now generate the final response.\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the ratio of the order of the finite group of rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ to the order of the group of rational points of a maximally split torus $T(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n\nFor a group $G$ of type $E_8$, it is known that any such group over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is split. This means it is a Chevalley group, denoted $E_8(q)$. The rank of $E_8$ is 8.\n\nThe order of the group $E_8(q)$ is given by the formula:\n$|E_8(q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1)$\nwhere $N$ is the number of positive roots, $r$ is the rank, and $d_i$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group.\n\nFor $E_8$:\n*   The rank is $r=8$.\n*   The number of positive roots is $N=120$.\n*   The degrees of the fundamental invariants are $d_i \\in \\{2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30\\}$.\n\nSo, the order of $E_8(q)$ is:\n$|E_8(q)| = q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)$.\n\nA split maximal torus $T$ of rank 8 is isomorphic to the direct product of 8 copies of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{G}_m$. The group of its $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points, $T(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times)^8$. The order of $\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times$ is $q-1$.\nTherefore, $|T(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^8$.\n\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the ratio:\nNumber = $\\frac{|E_8(q)|}{|T(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} = \\frac{q^{120} (q^2-1)(q^8-1)(q^{12}-1)(q^{14}-1)(q^{18}-1)(q^{20}-1)(q^{24}-1)(q^{30}-1)}{(q-1)^8}$.\n\nThis expression gives the exact number as a function of $q$.\n\nFinal answer is ready. I will present it clearly.\nThe final answer is a mathematical expression. I will write it out clearly.\nI will use the product notation for conciseness.\nThe expression can be simplified by dividing each $(q^{d_i}-1)$ term by $(q-1)$.\n$\\frac{q^{d_i}-1}{q-1} = 1 + q + q^2 + \\dots + q^{d_i-1}$.\nSo the number is $q^{120} \\prod_{i=1}^8 (1+q+\\dots+q^{d_i-1})$.\nThis is a polynomial in $q$ with integer coefficients.\nThe question asks for the \"exact number\", and this polynomial is the most precise answer.\nI will provide the formula in its most common form.\n\nFinal check of the question and my planned answer.
