    "To find the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in a specific interval, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval.\n\n### 1. The Wave Function and Probability Density\n\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' for a given quantum state 'n' is:\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nFor the n = 2 state, the wave function is:\nψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)\n\nThe probability density, P(x), is the square of the magnitude of the wave function:\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\n### 2. Setting up the Integral\n\nThe probability (Prob) of finding the particle in the interval from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a is given by the integral of the probability density over this range:\nProb = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\n### 3. Solving the Integral\n\nThe interval [0.495a, 0.505a] is very small (with a width of Δx = 0.01a) and is centered at x = 0.5a. At this central point, the probability density for n=2 is:\nP(0.5a) = (2/a) * sin²(2π(0.5a)/a) = (2/a) * sin²(π) = 0\n\nSince the probability density is zero at the center of the small interval, we expect the probability to be very small. We can approximate the `sin` function to solve the integral.\n\nLet's define a new variable `u = x - 0.5a`. The integration limits for `u` become -0.005a to 0.005a.\nThe term `2πx/a` becomes `2π(u + 0.5a)/a = 2πu/a + π`.\nThe integral becomes:\nProb = ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * sin²(π + 2πu/a) du\n\nUsing the trigonometric identity `sin(π + θ) = -sin(θ)`, we get `sin²(π + 2πu/a) = sin²(2πu/a)`.\nProb = ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * sin²(2πu/a) du\n\nFor the small values of `u` in our interval, we can use the small-angle approximation `sin(θ) ≈ θ`.\nSo, `sin²(2πu/a) ≈ (2πu/a)² = 4π²u²/a²`.\n\nThe integral simplifies to:\nProb ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (2/a) * (4π²u²/a²) du\nProb ≈ (8π²/a³) ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] u² du\n\nNow, we perform the integration:\nProb ≈ (8π²/a³) * [u³/3] (evaluated from -0.005a to 0.005a)\nProb ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [(0.005a)³ - (-0.005a)³]\nProb ≈ (8π²/3a³) * [2 * (0.005a)³]\nProb ≈ (16π²/3a³) * (0.000000125 a³)\nProb ≈ (16π²/3) * 0.000000125\n\n### 4. Final Calculation\n\nUsing the value of π ≈ 3.14159:\nProb ≈ (16 * (3.14159)² / 3) * 0.000000125\nProb ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 0.000000125\nProb ≈ (52.6379) * 0.000000125\nProb ≈ 0.0000065797\n\nThus, the probability of finding the particle in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately 6.58 x 10⁻⁶.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
