    "### The Gauss Class Number Problem and Class Number 48\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in its modern formulation, seeks to provide a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields for each class number *n*. This is equivalent to finding all negative fundamental discriminants for which the class number of the corresponding imaginary quadratic field is *n*. A fundamental discriminant is an integer that is not divisible by any square of an odd prime and is either square-free and congruent to 1 modulo 4, or is 4 times a square-free integer congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4.\n\nFor a class number of 48, there are **243** negative fundamental discriminants. This has been determined through extensive computations by mathematicians working on this problem. A comprehensive table compiled by Mark Watkins of The Pennsylvania State University lists the number of negative fundamental discriminants for class numbers up to 100, and for class number 48, the count is 243.\n\n<<<243>>>"
