    "The Hollywood feature film in which a teenager rides a pink bike and pedals directly toward an oncoming car is the 1995 movie *Now and Then*, produced by New Line Cinema.\n\nIn the film, the character Roberta Martin, portrayed by Christina Ricci, is a tomboy and part of a group of four young friends. These girls have an ongoing rivalry with a group of neighborhood boys known as the Wormer brothers. Bicycles are a central element of the girls' friendship and their adventures.\n\nIn a notable scene of retaliation against the Wormer brothers, the girls decide it's \"payback time.\" During this confrontation, Roberta rides her bicycle head-on toward a car driven by the boys. While the bike's color is a pinkish-red, this scene matches the user's description of a teenager on a bike confronting an oncoming car as an act of defiance.\n\n<<<Now and Then>>>"
