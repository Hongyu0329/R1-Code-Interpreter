    "The initial search has provided some context on the problem of packing circles into a larger circle. It confirms that this is a known mathematical problem and that solutions, both proven and conjectured, exist for various numbers of circles. Specifically, for 14 circles, a solution has been established. However, the exact details of the arrangement and the formula for the radius of the enclosing circle are not yet clear. The search results mention that for n=14, the packing has \"loose\" circles, which suggests the arrangement is not as straightforward as a simple symmetric pattern. To proceed, I need to find the specific arrangement of 14 circles and the corresponding calculation for the radius of the larger circle.The search results have provided valuable information. I found a source that directly gives the radius ratio for packing 14 circles in a larger circle. Specifically, one result states \"14 circles in a circle radius = 0.598736595718 ratio = 1.670183528370\". The 'ratio' here is likely the ratio of the radius of the large circle to the radius of the small circles. If the small circles have a radius of one, then the radius of the large circle is simply this ratio. Another source provides a table of solutions for circle packing and for n=14, it is noted as a proven optimal packing. The problem is to find the radius of the large circle up to 4 significant digits.\n\nGiven the information, I can proceed to the final calculation.\n\nLet R be the radius of the large circle and r be the radius of the small circles.\nGiven r = 1.\nFrom the search result, the ratio R/r is 1.670183528370.\nSo, R = 1 * 1.670183528370 = 1.670183528370.\nRounding to 4 significant digits, R is 1.670.\n\nHowever, another search result provides a different value. A document from E. Specht states \"radius = 0.598736595718\" and \"ratio = 1.670183528370\". It seems the 'radius' mentioned here is the radius of the small circles when the large circle has a radius of 1. Let's verify this. If the large circle has radius R=1, and the small circles have radius r', then the ratio is R/r' = 1/r' = 1.670183528370. This would mean r' = 1/1.670183528370 = 0.598736595718, which matches the 'radius' value in that source.\n\nSo, if the small circles have a radius of r=1, the large circle's radius R is given by the ratio.\nR = ratio * r = 1.670183528370 * 1 = 1.670183528370.\n\nLet's look at another source to be sure. The Wikipedia page for \"Circle packing in a circle\" has a table of solutions. For n=14, it states the enclosing circle radius 'r' is proven optimal. The table seems to assume the small circles are unit circles (radius 1). Let's check for a simple case. For n=3, the radius is given as 1 + 2/sqrt(3) â‰ˆ 2.155. This is for unit circles.\n\nThe Wikipedia table for n=14 gives a value for the radius of the enclosing circle. Let's re-examine the search results to find that specific table. The search result from Wikipedia on \"Circle packing in a circle\" does mention a table of solutions. Let's assume the values in that table are for unit circles.\n\nI need to find the value for n=14 from a reliable source. The source from E. Specht seems quite specific. Let's use that value: R/r = 1.670183528370.\n\nRadius of the large circle = 1.670183528370 * 1 = 1.670183528370.\n\nRounding to 4 significant digits gives 1.670.\n\nLet me double check the search results for any other values or diagrams that might confirm the arrangement and the calculation. The search results confirm that for n=14, the packing is not simple and has \"rattlers\" or loose circles. This complexity makes a simple geometric calculation difficult, so relying on a documented result is the best approach.\n\nThe source from E. Specht seems to be a dedicated compilation of circle packing data, which lends it credibility. The ratio is provided with high precision.\n\nLet's re-read the prompt to ensure no misunderstanding. \"Fourteen circles of radius one are tightly packed into another circle. What is the radius of this circle up to 4 significant digits?\" The prompt is straightforward.\n\nThe value from Specht's page is R/r = 1.670183528370.\nFor r=1, R = 1.670183528370.\nRounding to 4 significant digits: 1.670.\n\nI am confident in this result based on the specialized source found.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1. Understood the problem: Find the radius of a larger circle that encloses 14 unit circles.\n2. Searched for information on this specific circle packing problem.\n3. Found a reliable source providing the ratio of the radii for the optimal packing of 14 circles.\n4. Used this ratio to calculate the radius of the larger circle.\n5. Prepared to round the result to the required number of significant digits.\n\nThe process is sound. I will now formulate the final answer.\nThe radius of the large circle is the given ratio multiplied by the radius of the small circles.\nRadius of large circle = 1.670183528370 * 1 = 1.670183528370.\nRounding to 4 significant digits, we get 1.670.\nThe trailing zero is significant.\n\nI will now check if there is a more direct source for the radius value itself, rather than the ratio, to be absolutely sure.\nI will perform one more search to confirm the radius value from another source if possible.The final search confirms that the problem of packing n circles in a larger circle is a well-studied problem and that for n=14, the optimal packing is proven. The Wikipedia article on \"Circle packing in a circle\" provides a table of solutions. Although the table in the snippet cuts off before n=14, the link to the full table and the mention of proven optimality for n=14 reinforces the idea that a definitive answer exists and is documented. The previous search provided a specific ratio from a reliable source (E. Specht's page on circle packing). I am confident that using this ratio will provide the correct answer. No conflicting values have been found in the subsequent searches. Therefore, I will proceed with the calculation based on the previously found ratio.\n\nThe radius of the small circles is given as 1.\nThe ratio of the radius of the large circle (R) to the radius of the small circles (r) for a tight packing of 14 circles is given as 1.670183528370.\nSo, R = 1.670183528370 * 1 = 1.670183528370.\nThe question asks for the radius up to 4 significant digits.\nRounding the value of R to 4 significant digits gives 1.670. The trailing zero is significant in this case.\n\nI have all the necessary information and am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nThe radius of the large circle is the ratio of the radii multiplied by the radius of the small circles.\nRadius of the large circle = 1.670183528370 * 1 = 1.670183528370.\nRounding to 4 significant digits, the radius is 1.670.\n\nFinal check: The question is simple and direct. The search has yielded a reliable value for the ratio of the radii. The calculation is straightforward. The rounding to 4 significant digits is the final step. I am confident in the result.\nThe problem of finding the smallest circle that can contain a given number of unit circles is a classic mathematical problem known as circle packing. For 14 circles, the arrangement is complex and not a simple symmetrical pattern. The solution is not straightforward to derive from basic geometric principles and relies on numerical optimizations and proofs.\n\nThe established ratio of the radius of the enclosing circle (R) to the radius of the smaller circles (r) for the optimal packing of 14 circles is approximately 1.67018. Given that the fourteen small circles each have a radius of one, the radius of the larger circle is simply this ratio multiplied by one.\n\nRadius of the large circle = 1.670183528370 * 1 = 1.670183528370.\n\nRounding this value to four significant digits gives 1.670.\n\n<<<1.670>>>"
