    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, it is a former thrall of the Romans, a man of the Gaelic people, who describes the religious practices of a Roman city in a way that alludes to the legend of Romulus and Remus. This account is relayed to the Wolfings by an Elking warrior named Hiarandi.\n\nThe Gaelic man, who was captured in battle and enslaved by the Romans, observed their customs firsthand. Hiarandi recounts the thrall's story in Chapter VI, explaining the nature of Roman society to a Wolfing warrior named Wolfkettle.\n\nThe specific reference to the Roman founding myth is subtle. The thrall does not explicitly name Romulus and Remus, but describes the Roman banner. He states that the Romans' banner of battle is a wolf, and that they believe a she-wolf suckled the first father of their folk. This imagery is a clear reference to the iconic story of the twin brothers being nursed by a she-wolf, a foundational myth of Rome. The Wolfings themselves use a wolf on their own banner, but the thrall's description of the Roman wolf and its associated origin story is what makes the connection to Romulus and Remus apparent to the reader.\n\n<<<A Gaelic thrall (a former slave of the Romans)>>>"
