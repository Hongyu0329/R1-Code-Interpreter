    "To determine the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the given figure, we first need to find the extent of the curve in the x and y directions.\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts:\n\n**Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\nThis corresponds to the upper half of a unit circle.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(0) = 1$. So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n*   The y-values range from $\\sin(0) = 0$ and $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$ up to a maximum of $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$. So, $y \\in$.\n\n**Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\nThis corresponds to the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$. So, $x \\in [-1, 1]$.\n*   The y-values are negative in this interval. They range from $5\\sin(\\pi) = 0$ and $5\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$ down to a minimum of $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$. So, $y \\in [-5, 0)$.\n\n**Overall Dimensions of the Figure**\nTo find the full extent of the figure, we combine the ranges from both parts:\n*   **Total x-range:** The union of $[-1, 1]$ and $[-1, 1]$ is $[-1, 1]$. The width of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values: $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **Total y-range:** The union of $$ and $[-5, 0)$ is $[-5, 1]$. The height of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values: $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Smallest Circumscribing Square**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. The smallest square that can circumscribe this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n*   Side length of the square = max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6.\n\n**Area of the Square**\nThe area of a square is the side length squared.\n*   Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>To determine the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the given figure, we first need to find the extent of the curve in the x and y directions.\n\nThe curve is defined in two parts:\n\n**Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\nThis corresponds to the upper half of a unit circle.\n*   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(0) = 1$.
