    "Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368. At the time of her death, she was at either Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire or Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England.\n\nIn 1367, Geoffrey Chaucer was in the service of King Edward III of England as a valet and later as a squire in the royal court. While some accounts suggest he may have traveled to the continent in 1368, possibly to France or Italy, the more definitive event of this period is his connection to the English court. Following Blanche's death, her husband John of Gaunt commissioned Chaucer to write the poem *The Book of the Duchess* in her honor. This commission would have most likely occurred in England, where Chaucer was in royal service. Therefore, it is most probable that Chaucer was in England when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n<<<C>>>"
