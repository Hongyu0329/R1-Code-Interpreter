    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide in refluxing tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by an aqueous work-up, results in the exhaustive substitution of all halogen atoms with phenyl groups.\n\nThe reactivity of the carbon-halogen bond towards reagents like Grignard reagents follows the order C-I > C-Br > C-Cl. Therefore, the iodine atom at the 2-position is the most reactive and will be substituted first. Due to the use of excess Grignard reagent and heating (reflux), the two less reactive bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 will also be substituted by phenyl groups.\n\nThe step-by-step substitution is as follows:\n1.  **Substitution of Iodine:** 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene reacts with phenyl magnesium bromide to form 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n2.  **Substitution of Bromines:** The resulting 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene then reacts further with the excess phenyl magnesium bromide to replace both bromine atoms with phenyl groups.\n\nThe final organic product formed after all halogens have been replaced is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene. The aqueous work-up step serves to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent and dissolve the magnesium halide byproducts, leaving the stable 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene as the final product.\n\nThe IUPAC name of this product is **1,2,3-triphenylbenzene**.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
