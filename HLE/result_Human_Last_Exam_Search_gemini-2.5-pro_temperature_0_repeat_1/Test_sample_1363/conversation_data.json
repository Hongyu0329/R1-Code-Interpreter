    "The ability to overturn a reverse turn is dependent on the specific technique of each dance. In the swing dances—Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep—the use of body sway, rise and fall, and continuous body movement (CBM) allows for the possibility of turning more than the standard amount. While a figure may have a prescribed amount of rotation, skilled dancers can and do overturn or underturn figures for floorcraft or styling purposes. For instance, in Foxtrot, a spin turn can be overturned. Similarly, in Waltz, it is possible to overturn turns, though underturning is often easier and more common for navigating corners.\n\nHowever, in the European Tango, the technique is fundamentally different. The Basic Reverse Turn in Tango is characterized by a staccato action, an absence of rise and fall, and, crucially, a lack of continuous body movement. The turn is executed with sharp, precise movements and specific footwork. For the follower, many reverse turns involve a heel turn, a specific action where rotation is limited by the mechanics of the movement itself. Attempting to rotate more than the prescribed amount would necessitate abandoning the core principles of Tango technique, such as introducing sway or altering the distinct foot-closing action, which would mean it is no longer a correct Tango Reverse Turn.\n\nTherefore, it is in the European Tango that overturning a reverse turn without disregarding the technique is considered impossible.\n\n<<<C>>>"
