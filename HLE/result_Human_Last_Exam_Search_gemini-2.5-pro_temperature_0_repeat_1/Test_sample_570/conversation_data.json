    "The minimal area of a convex domain in the plane that intersects every line with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers, is 2.\n\nTo determine this, we can establish a lower bound for the area and then demonstrate a convex domain that achieves this bound.\n\n### Lower Bound for the Area\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain that satisfies the given condition. This means `K` must intersect every line in the set `L = {l_pq | px + qy = 1, p, q ∈ ℤ, gcd(p, q) = 1}`.\n\nConsider the following specific lines from the set `L`:\n*   For `(p, q) = (1, 0)`, the line is `x = 1`.\n*   For `(p, q) = (-1, 0)`, the line is `x = -1`.\n*   For `(p, q) = (0, 1)`, the line is `y = 1`.\n*   For `(p, q) = (0, -1)`, the line is `y = -1`.\n\nThe convex domain `K` must intersect all four of these lines. Let the minimum and maximum x-coordinates of points in `K` be `x_min` and `x_max`, and the minimum and maximum y-coordinates be `y_min` and `y_max`.\n\n*   To intersect the line `x = 1`, `K` must contain a point with an x-coordinate of 1. Thus, `x_min ≤ 1 ≤ x_max`.\n*   To intersect the line `x = -1`, `K` must contain a point with an x-coordinate of -1. Thus, `x_min ≤ -1 ≤ x_max`.\n\nCombining these, we find that `x_min ≤ -1` and `x_max ≥ 1`. The width of `K` in the x-direction, `w_x = x_max - x_min`, must therefore be at least `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n\nSimilarly, by considering the lines `y = 1` and `y = -1`, the width of `K` in the y-direction, `w_y = y_max - y_min`, must be at least 2.\n\nFor any planar convex body, a known geometric inequality states that its area `A` is at least half the product of its widths in any two orthogonal directions. Therefore, `A ≥ (w_x * w_y) / 2`.\n\nUsing the minimum widths we found, we can establish a lower bound for the area of `K`:\n`A ≥ (2 * 2) / 2 = 2`.\n\n### Achieving the Lower Bound\n\nNow, we need to show that this minimal area of 2 is achievable. Consider the convex domain `K_0` defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`. This region is a square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), and (0, -1).\n\nThe area of this square is `(1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`.\n\nNext, we must verify that this square `K_0` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. A line `px + qy = 1` intersects a convex set if the values of the function `f(x, y) = px + qy` on the set span across 1. For a convex polygon, the extreme values of a linear function occur at its vertices.\n\nThe values of `f(x, y) = px + qy` at the vertices of `K_0` are:\n*   `f(1, 0) = p`\n*   `f(0, 1) = q`\n*   `f(-1, 0) = -p`\n*   `f(0, -1) = -q`\n\nThe maximum value of `f(x, y)` on `K_0` is `max(p, q, -p, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`. The minimum value is `min(p, q, -p, -q) = -max(|p|, |q|)`.\n\nThe line `px + qy = 1` intersects `K_0` if and only if `min(f) ≤ 1 ≤ max(f)`, which means `-max(|p|, |q|) ≤ 1 ≤ max(|p|, |q|)`. This simplifies to `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\n\nFor any pair of coprime integers `(p, q)`, it is not possible for both `p` and `q` to be zero. Therefore, at least one of `|p|` or `|q|` must be at least 1. This ensures that `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1` is always true for coprime integers `p` and `q`.\n\nThus, the square with vertices at (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), and (0, -1) has an area of 2 and intersects all the specified lines. Since we have established a lower bound of 2 for the area, this is the minimal possible area.\n\n<<<2>>>"
