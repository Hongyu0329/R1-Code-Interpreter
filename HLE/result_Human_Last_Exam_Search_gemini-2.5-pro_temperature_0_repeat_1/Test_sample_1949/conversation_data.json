    "### The Three Longest Rivers Mentioned in the Aeneid\n\nThe epic poem, the Aeneid by Virgil, makes reference to numerous rivers, both real and mythological. Among the terrestrial rivers mentioned, the three longest are the Ganges, the Aras (Araxes), and the Hydaspes.\n\n**The Ganges River**, the longest of the three, is alluded to in the Aeneid in the context of the farthest reaches of the known world. Ancient Greco-Roman writers, including Virgil, mentioned the Gangaridai, a people who lived by the Ganges, and whose formidable army was a reason for Alexander the Great's retreat from India. The Ganges has a total length of approximately 2,510 to 2,704 kilometers (1,557 to 1,680 miles).\n\n**The Aras River**, known in antiquity as the Araxes, is the second longest. Virgil mentions it in Book VIII of the Aeneid, describing it as a river that was \"angry at the bridge,\" signifying its conquest by the Romans who built a bridge over it. The Aras River flows through Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran, with a total length of about 1,072 kilometers (666 miles).\n\n**The Hydaspes River**, now known as the Jhelum River, is the third longest. The Aeneid references the famous battle that took place on its banks between Alexander the Great and King Porus. The Hydaspes is a major river in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent and has a total length of approximately 725 kilometers (450 miles).\n\nOther notable rivers mentioned in the Aeneid include the **Hebrus** (modern Maritsa or Evros), which is about 480 to 530 kilometers long, and the **Tiber**, the river of Rome, which is approximately 405 kilometers long. Several shorter rivers in Italy are also mentioned, such as the **Aufidus** (Ofanto), **Velinus**, **Sarnus**, **Galaesus**, and **Timavus**. The epic also famously features the mythological rivers of the underworld: the Styx, Acheron, Cocytus, Lethe, and Phlegethon.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Ganges, the Aras (Araxes), and the Hydaspes.>>>"
