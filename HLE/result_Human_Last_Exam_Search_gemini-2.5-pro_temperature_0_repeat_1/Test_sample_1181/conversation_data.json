    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is the protagonist, Kris Kelvin, who is shown to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth.\n\nWhile stationed on the space station orbiting the planet Solaris, Kris is depicted in a scene where he attaches strips of paper to an air vent. This act is a conscious effort to replicate the sound of leaves rustling in the wind, a sound he is deprived of in the sterile, artificial environment of space. This gesture highlights his deep-seated nostalgia and longing for the natural world of Earth, which stands in stark contrast to the cold and mysterious alien world he is investigating. The film opens with extended scenes of nature on Earth, establishing a sensory baseline that Kelvin later attempts to recreate, underscoring his feeling of loss and separation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
