    "Based on the current research in group theory, there are **no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m** for an odd prime q and a natural number m.\n\nThis conclusion is derived from a significant classification theorem by the mathematician C. S. Anabanti. A finite group *G* is termed \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set within the group has a property known as being \"complete\". A product-free set *S* is a subset of *G* such that the product of any two elements in *S* is not in *S*. Such a set is complete if every non-identity element of *G* is either in *S* or can be expressed as a product of two elements from *S*.\n\nA theorem by Anabanti in 2018 provides a complete classification of all finite filled groups whose order is of the form p^n*q^m, where p and q are prime numbers and n and m are natural numbers. The theorem states that any such group must be either an elementary abelian 2-group or one of the following nine nonabelian groups:\n*   D₆ (Dihedral group of order 12 = 2² × 3)\n*   D₈ (Dihedral group of order 16 = 2⁴)\n*   D₁₀ (Dihedral group of order 20 = 2² × 5)\n*   D₁₂ (Dihedral group of order 24 = 2³ × 3)\n*   D₁₄ (Dihedral group of order 28 = 2² × 7)\n*   D₈ × C₂ (Direct product of the dihedral group of order 16 and the cyclic group of order 2, with a total order of 32 = 2⁵)\n*   D₂₂ (Dihedral group of order 44 = 2² × 11)\n*   D₈ ∗ Q₈ (Central product of the dihedral group of order 16 and the quaternion group of order 8, with a total order of 32 = 2⁵)\n*   (D₈ ∗ Q₈) × C₂ (Direct product of the previous group and the cyclic group of order 2, with a total order of 64 = 2⁶)\n\nThe order of a nonabelian group of the form 2q^m must have a Sylow 2-subgroup of order 2. An examination of the orders of the nonabelian groups in Anabanti's classification reveals that none of them have an order where the prime factorization includes 2 to the power of 1. All the listed nonabelian filled groups have orders divisible by 2², 2³, 2⁴, 2⁵, or 2⁶.\n\nSince the provided list is exhaustive for filled groups of order p^n*q^m, and no group on this list has an order of 2q^m for an odd prime q, it follows that no such nonabelian filled groups exist.\n\n"
