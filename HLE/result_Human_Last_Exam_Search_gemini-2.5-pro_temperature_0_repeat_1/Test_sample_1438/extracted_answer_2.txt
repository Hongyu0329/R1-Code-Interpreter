The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is defined by the rules of Berezin integration, specifically that the integral of a Grassmann variable itself is one, and the integral of a constant is zero. This, combined with the anticommuting nature of Grassmann variables (where \( \psi_i \psi_j = - \psi_j \psi_i \) and consequently \( \psi_i^2 = 0 \)), ensures that any state with two fermions in the same quantum state vanishes, thus enforcing the Pauli exclusion principle.
