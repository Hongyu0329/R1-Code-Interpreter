    "Let $G$ be a graph with $n=12345$ vertices. The number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring is given by the chromatic number, denoted as $\\chi(G)$.\n\nThe chromatic number of any graph with $n$ vertices is at most $n$. Equality, $\\chi(G) = n$, holds if and only if the graph is a complete graph, $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\nThe problem states that the graph $G$ is not a complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than the number of vertices.\n$\\chi(G) < 12345$, which implies $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of colors required, we need to check if a chromatic number of 12344 is achievable for a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n\nConsider a graph $G$ constructed as the disjoint union of a complete graph on 12344 vertices ($K_{12344}$) and a single isolated vertex ($K_1$).\n*   The total number of vertices in this graph is $12344 + 1 = 12345$.\n*   This graph is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the vertices of the $K_{12344}$ component.\n*   The chromatic number of a graph that is a disjoint union of components is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\n*   The chromatic number of the complete graph $K_{12344}$ is 12344.\n*   The chromatic number of the isolated vertex $K_1$ is 1.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic number of our constructed graph $G$ is $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(K_1)) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nSince any graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph must have a chromatic number of at most 12344, and we have constructed such a graph with a chromatic number of exactly 12344, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\nAnother example of a graph that satisfies the conditions is a complete graph on 12345 vertices with a single edge removed ($K_{12345}-e$). This graph is not complete, and its chromatic number is also 12344.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
