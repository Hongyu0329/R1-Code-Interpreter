    "This is a problem in harmonic analysis, specifically concerning the $L^p$ integrability of the Fourier transform of a measure supported on a surface. The integral in question is:\n$I(a_1, ..., a_9) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i \\Psi(x,y)} dxdy$\nwhere the phase function $\\Psi(x,y)$ is a general cubic polynomial in two variables with coefficients $(a_1, ..., a_9)$:\n$\\Psi(x,y) = a_1 x+a_2 y + a_3 x^2 + a_4 xy + a_5 y^2 + a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3$\n\nThis integral can be viewed as the Fourier transform of a measure supported on the 2-dimensional surface in $\\mathbb{R}^9$ parametrized by:\n$\\vec{\\phi}(x,y) = (x, y, x^2, xy, y^2, x^3, x^2y, xy^2, y^3)$ for $(x,y) \\in^2$.\n\nTo determine the largest $p$ for which $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$, we need to find the critical exponent $p_0$ such that $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^9} |I(\\vec{a})|^p d\\vec{a}$ diverges for $p \\le p_0$ and converges for $p > p_0$. Since the integral is over a compact domain, the function $I(\\vec{a})$ is bounded, and we only need to consider the decay of $I(\\vec{a})$ as $|\\vec{a}| \\to \\infty$ to determine convergence.\n\nThe decay rate of such oscillatory integrals is determined by the geometry of the surface, particularly by its \"flattest\" points or directions. The decay is slowest when the phase function $\\Psi(x,y)$ is as flat as possible. This occurs when the coefficients corresponding to lower-order terms are zero, and the highest-order terms are themselves degenerate.\n\nLet's analyze the decay based on the degree of the terms in the phase:\n1.  **Generic case:** For a generic choice of $\\vec{a}$, the phase polynomial has a non-degenerate critical point, leading to a decay rate of $|I(\\vec{a})| \\sim |\\vec{a}|^{-1}$.\n2.  **Degenerate quadratic part:** If the quadratic part of the phase is degenerate (e.g., a perfect square), but the cubic part is not, the decay can be slower, like $|\\vec{a}|^{-1/2}$.\n3.  **Cubic part:** When the lower-order terms are zero, the decay is governed by the cubic part. For a non-degenerate homogeneous cubic phase in two variables, the decay rate is $|\\vec{a}|^{-2/3}$. This occurs on the 4-dimensional subspace where $a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4=a_5=0$.\n4.  **Degenerate cubic part:** If the cubic part itself is degenerate (e.g., of the form $(c_1 x + c_2 y)^3$), the decay can be even slower. For instance, if the phase is $\\lambda x^3$, the integral decays like $|\\lambda|^{-1/3}$. This corresponds to a line in the space of coefficients.\n\nThe overall integrability of $|I(\\vec{a})|^p$ depends on a trade-off between how slowly the integral decays and the dimension of the subspace of coefficients on which this slow decay occurs.\n\nThe most significant contribution to the divergence of the $L^p$ integral comes from the slowest decay that occurs on a subspace of sufficiently high dimension. Let's analyze the contribution from the cubic terms.\n\nConsider the 4-dimensional subspace $W$ where $a_1=a_2=a_3=a_4=a_5=0$. On this subspace, the integral is $I(\\vec{a}) = \\int_{^2} e^{2\\pi i (a_6 x^3 + a_7 x^2 y + a_8 x y^2 + a_9 y^3)} dxdy$. For a generic $\\vec{a} \\in W$, the cubic polynomial is non-degenerate, and the decay rate of the integral is $|\\vec{a}|^{-2/3}$.\n\nTo determine the critical exponent, we check the convergence of the integral of $|I(\\vec{a})|^p$ over this 4D subspace:\n$\\int_W |I(\\vec{a})|^p d\\vec{a} \\approx C \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^4} (|\\vec{a}|^{-2/3})^p d\\vec{a} = C \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^4} |\\vec{a}|^{-2p/3} d\\vec{a}$\n\nTo evaluate this, we use spherical coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^4$. The integral becomes:\n$C' \\int_0^\\infty r^{-2p/3} r^{3} dr = C' \\int_0^\\infty r^{3 - 2p/3} dr$\n\nThis integral diverges at infinity if the exponent is greater than or equal to -1:\n$3 - \\frac{2p}{3} \\ge -1$\n$4 \\ge \\frac{2p}{3}$\n$12 \\ge 2p$\n$p \\le 6$\n\nThis means that for $p \\le 6$, the integral of $|I(\\vec{a})|^p$ over this 4-dimensional subspace diverges, which implies that the integral over the full $\\mathbb{R}^9$ also diverges. Therefore, $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ for $p \\le 6$.\n\nFor $p > 6$, the integral over this subspace converges. While there are subspaces where the decay is slower (e.g., $|\\vec{a}|^{-1/3}$ on a line), the lower dimensionality of these subspaces leads to a less restrictive condition on $p$. For instance, for the $|\\vec{a}|^{-1/3}$ decay on a 1D subspace, the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} (r^{-1/3})^p dr$ diverges if $1-p/3 \\ge 0$, i.e., $p \\le 3$. Since $p \\le 6$ is a weaker condition, it is the one that determines the overall integrability threshold.\n\nThus, the function $I$ is in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ for $p > 6$ and not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ for $p \\le 6$. The largest value of $p$ for which $I$ is not in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^9)$ is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
