    "The single known integer value that completes the sequence 24663, 35005, 119261, 196219, 211770, 227296 as of August 2022 is **281311**.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A224423. The sequence consists of numbers `k` such that the number of solutions to the Diophantine equation `x^4 + y^4 = k` is greater than or equal to `n`, where `x` and `y` are positive integers. The provided numbers are the smallest such values of `k` for `n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7`.\n\nThe term that completes the sequence, 281311, is the smallest number known to be the sum of two fourth powers in eight distinct ways. This value was discovered by Allan MacLeod and announced in August 2022, which aligns with the timeframe specified in the question.\n\n<<<281311>>>"
