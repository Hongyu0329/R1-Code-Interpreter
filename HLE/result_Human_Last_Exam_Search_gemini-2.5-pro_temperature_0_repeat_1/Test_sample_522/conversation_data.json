    "This puzzle involves a transformation rule applied to a grid of numbers. Let's analyze the provided examples to deduce the rule.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\nThe transformation appears to center around the number `2`. In each case, the grid contains a single `2`.\n\n**1. General Mechanics**\n*   The cell that initially contains a `2` becomes `0` in the output.\n*   One of the neighboring cells that was `0` in the input becomes `2` in the output.\n*   All other cells in the grid retain their original values.\n\nThis suggests a \"movement\" of the number `2`. The core of the puzzle is to determine the direction of this movement.\n\n**2. Determining the Direction of Movement**\n\nLet's analyze the neighborhood of the `2` in each input to find what dictates the direction. The neighborhood consists of the 8 adjacent cells (including diagonals).\n\n**Example A:**\n*   **Input_A:**\n    ```\n    0 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 2 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   The `2` is at position (row 1, col 1).\n*   Its neighbors are: `0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`.\n*   There are **two** `0`s in the neighborhood.\n*   **Output_A:**\n    ```\n    2 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   The `2` moves from (1, 1) to (0, 0). This is a move to the **North-West** (`-1` row, `-1` col).\n\n**Example B:**\n*   **Input_B:**\n    ```\n    ...\n    ...000011...\n    ...002111...\n    ...111111...\n    ...\n    ```\n*   The `2` is at position (row 3, col 6).\n*   Its neighbors are: `0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1`.\n*   There are **four** `0`s in the neighborhood.\n*   **Output_B:**\n    ```\n    ...\n    ...000211...\n    ...000111...\n    ...111111...\n    ...\n    ```\n*   The `2` moves from (3, 6) to (2, 7). This is a move to the **North-East** (`-1` row, `+1` col).\n\n**3. The Rule**\n\nA clear pattern emerges: the number of zeros in the neighborhood of the `2` determines the direction of its movement.\n\n*   **2 neighboring zeros** -> Move North-West.\n*   **4 neighboring zeros** -> Move North-East.\n\n### Solving for Input_C\n\nNow, we apply this rule to `Input_C`.\n\n*   **Input_C:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0\n    0 1 1 1 2 0\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n1.  The `2` is at position (row 1, col 4).\n2.  Let's examine its neighbors:\n    *   Above: `(0,3)=0`, `(0,4)=0`, `(0,5)=0`\n    *   Sides: `(1,3)=1`, `(1,5)=0`\n    *   Below: `(2,3)=1`, `(2,4)=1`, `(2,5)=1`\n3.  Counting the zeros in the neighborhood, we find there are **four** `0`s.\n4.  According to our rule, when there are four neighboring zeros, the `2` moves **North-East**.\n5.  The new position for the `2` will be (row 1 - 1, col 4 + 1) = (0, 5). The original cell at (0, 5) is indeed a `0`.\n6.  The original position of the `2` at (1, 4) becomes `0`.\n7.  The cell at (0, 5) becomes `2`.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\n\n*   The first row `000000` becomes `000002`.\n*   The second row `011120` becomes `011100`.\n*   The third row `111111` remains unchanged.\n\nCombining these rows gives the final output string.\n\n`000002,011100,111111`\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
