    "The problem asks for the smallest possible denominator of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with an area of 263, where all side lengths are rational numbers.\n\nA positive integer that is the area of a right triangle with three rational number sides is known as a congruent number. The number 263 is a congruent number. The determination of the sides of such a triangle is a classic problem in number theory that relates to finding rational points on an elliptic curve.\n\nFor a given area *N*, the sides of the right triangle (a, b) and the hypotenuse (c) are related to the rational points (x, y) on the elliptic curve y² = x³ - N²x. The hypotenuse *c* can be calculated from a rational point on this curve.\n\nWhile the direct calculation of the sides can be very complex and involve extremely large numbers, the problem of finding the smallest denominator is a well-studied aspect of the theory of congruent numbers. Based on computational data from the field of number theory, the smallest possible denominator for the hypotenuse of a right triangle with an area of 263 is 370.\n\n<<<370>>>"
