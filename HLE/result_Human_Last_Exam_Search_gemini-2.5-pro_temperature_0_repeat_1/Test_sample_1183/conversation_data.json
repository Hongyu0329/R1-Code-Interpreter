    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a large, triangle-shaped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). These types of molecules are generally planar. The overall structure possesses a high degree of symmetry.\n\nTo determine the symmetry group, we identify the symmetry elements present in the molecule:\n*   **Principal Axis (C₃):** The molecule has a threefold rotational axis that passes through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its plane. A rotation of 120° around this axis leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **Perpendicular C₂ Axes:** There are three twofold rotational axes that lie within the plane of the molecule. Each of these axes passes through the center and bisects an angle of the triangular structure.\n*   **Horizontal Mirror Plane (σh):** The plane of the molecule itself acts as a horizontal mirror plane. Since the molecule is planar, reflection through this plane leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **Vertical Mirror Planes (σv):** There are three vertical mirror planes, each containing the principal C₃ axis and one of the C₂ axes.\n*   **Improper Rotation Axis (S₃):** The presence of a C₃ axis and a perpendicular σh plane implies the existence of an S₃ improper rotation axis.\n\nA molecule that has a principal Cₙ axis and n C₂ axes perpendicular to it belongs to a dihedral (D) point group. In this case, with a C₃ axis and three perpendicular C₂ axes, the molecule belongs to the D₃ group. The addition of a horizontal mirror plane (σh) further classifies the molecule into the **D₃h** point group.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
