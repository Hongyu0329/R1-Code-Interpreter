    "To determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols T, F, !, &, |, (, ), we must systematically enumerate all possible valid syntactic structures of length 5 and then count how many of them evaluate to True. The precedence of operators is ! > & > |, and symbols can be repeated. An expression is considered distinct if it is a unique string of 5 symbols.\n\nThe valid expressions can be categorized into the following groups based on their structure:\n\n### Group 1: Expressions dominated by unary operators and parentheses\nThis group consists of expressions where the structure is primarily defined by negation `!` and parentheses `()`.\n\n1.  `!!!!v`: Only `!!!!T` is true. (1 expression)\n2.  `!!(v)`: Only `!!(T)` is true. (1 expression)\n3.  `!(!(v))`: Only `!(!(T))` is true. (1 expression)\n4.  `!((v))`: Only `!((F))` is true. (1 expression)\n5.  `!(!!v)`: Only `!(!!F)` is true. (1 expression)\n6.  `(!!v)`: Only `(!!T)` is true. (1 expression)\n7.  `(!(v))`: Only `(!(F))` is true. (1 expression)\n8.  `(!(!v))`: Only `(!(!T))` is true. (1 expression)\n9.  `(((v)))`: Only `(((T)))` is true. (1 expression)\n\n*Total for Group 1: 9 expressions*\n\n### Group 2: Expressions with one binary operator\nThis group involves one binary operator `&` or `|` combined with variables, negations, and parentheses.\n\n1.  `(vov)`: `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, and `(T&T)`. (4 expressions)\n2.  `!(vov)`: `!(T&F)`, `!(F&T)`, `!(F&F)`, and `!(F|F)`. (4 expressions)\n3.  `(!v)ov`: `(!T)|T`, `(!F)|T`, `(!F)|F`, and `(!F)&T`. (4 expressions)\n4.  `vo(!v)`: `T|(!T)`, `T|(!F)`, `F|(!F)`, and `T&(!F)`. (4 expressions)\n5.  `!v o !v`: `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F`, and `!F&!F`. (4 expressions)\n6.  `!(v o !v)`: These are negations of false length-4 expressions like `T&!T`. The true expressions are `!(T&!T)`, `!(F&!T)`, `!(F&!F)`, and `!(F|!T)`. (4 expressions)\n7.  `!(!v o v)`: Similarly, `!(!T&T)`, `!(!T&F)`, `!(!F&F)`, and `!(!T|F)`. (4 expressions)\n8.  `!(!v o !v)`: Similarly, `!(!T&!T)`, `!(!T&!F)`, `!(!F&!T)`, and `!(!T|!T)`. (4 expressions)\n9.  `(v)o(v)`: `(T)|(T)`, `(T)|(F)`, `(F)|(T)`, and `(T)&(T)`. (4 expressions)\n\n*Total for Group 2: 9 patterns * 4 expressions/pattern = 36 expressions*\n\n### Group 3: Expressions with two binary operators\nThis group involves expressions with two binary operators, where operator precedence `(& > |)` and parentheses determine the order of evaluation.\n\n1.  **No parentheses (`v o v o v`)**:\n    *   `T&T&T` (1 expression)\n    *   Expressions with only `|`: 7 true expressions (`T|T|T`, `T|T|F`, `T|F|T`, `T|F|F`, `F|T|T`, `F|T|F`, `F|F|T`).\n    *   Mixed operators (e.g., `T&T|F`): Based on precedence, these are parsed as `(v&v)|v` or `v|(v&v)`. There are 5 true expressions for each form (`(T&T)|T`, `(T&T)|F`, `(T&F)|T`, `(F&T)|T`, `(F&F)|T` and `T|(T&T)`, `T|(T&F)`, `T|(F&T)`, `T|(F&F)`, `F|(T&T)`). (10 expressions)\n    *   Sub-total: 1 + 7 + 10 = 18 expressions.\n2.  **With parentheses to override precedence**:\n    *   `v&(v|v)`: `T&(T|T)`, `T&(T|F)`, `T&(F|T)`. (3 expressions)\n    *   `(v|v)&v`: `(T|T)&T`, `(T|F)&T`, `(F|T)&T`. (3 expressions)\n    *   Sub-total: 3 + 3 = 6 expressions.\n\n*Total for Group 3: 18 + 6 = 24 expressions*\n\n### Final Calculation\nSumming the counts from all groups:\n*   Group 1: 9\n*   Group 2: 36\n*   Group 3: 24\n\nTotal = 9 + 36 + 24 = 69.\n\nThere are 69 distinct true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the given symbols.\n\n<<<69>>>"
