    "In an interacting scalar field theory, the interaction is represented by vertices in Feynman diagrams, where multiple lines (representing particles) meet. The number of lines meeting at a vertex depends on the type of interaction. For a theory with a φⁿ interaction term, each vertex will have 'n' lines.\n\nA loop in a Feynman diagram corresponds to a closed path of internal lines (propagators), which represents a virtual particle loop. A two-loop diagram is a diagram that contains two independent closed loops. Topologically, the number of loops (L) in a connected diagram is related to the number of internal lines (I) and the number of vertices (V) by the formula L = I - V + 1.\n\nLet's consider the common types of scalar field theories:\n\n*   **φ³ Theory:** In this theory, each vertex has three lines.\n    *   With a single vertex (V=1), we have three lines. We can connect two of these lines to form one internal line (a propagator), creating a single loop (L=1). This is a \"tadpole\" diagram. It is not possible to form two loops with only one vertex.\n    *   With two vertices (V=2), we have a total of six lines. We can connect the two vertices with three internal lines (I=3). According to the formula, the number of loops is L = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2. This forms a \"sunset\" diagram, which is a two-loop diagram. Therefore, in a φ³ theory, the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop diagram is 2.\n\n*   **φ⁴ Theory:** This is a very common and physically significant interacting scalar field theory. In this theory, each vertex has four lines.\n    *   With a single vertex (V=1), we have four lines. We can connect these lines in pairs to form two internal lines (I=2). This creates a \"figure-eight\" vacuum bubble diagram. Using the formula, the number of loops is L = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSince a φ⁴ theory is a type of interacting scalar field theory, and it is possible to construct a two-loop diagram with just one vertex, the minimum number of vertices required is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
