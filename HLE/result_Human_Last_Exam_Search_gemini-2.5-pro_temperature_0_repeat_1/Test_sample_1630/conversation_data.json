    "Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The fixed points of the composite function $f(g(x))$ are the real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n1.  **Degree of the composite polynomial:**\n    Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 3, and $g(x)$ be a polynomial of degree 3. The composition of these two polynomials, $h(x) = f(g(x))$, is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\n2.  **Equation for fixed points:**\n    The fixed points are the roots of the equation $h(x) - x = 0$. Since $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9, the equation $h(x) - x = 0$ is also a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n\n3.  **Maximum number of real roots:**\n    According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$ can have at most 9 real roots. This means the maximum possible number of fixed points is 9.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the constraints:**\n    The problem states that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$. This means that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n    Let's analyze the derivative of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. Using the chain rule, we get:\n    $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$\n    Since $f'(y) > 0$ for any real number $y$ (including $y=g(x)$) and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, their product must also be positive:\n    $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n    This implies that the composite function $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n5.  **Feasibility of 9 fixed points:**\n    We need to determine if it is possible for a strictly increasing polynomial of degree 9 to have 9 fixed points. A fixed point is an intersection of the graph of $y = h(x)$ with the line $y = x$.\n    Let's consider a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree 9 defined as:\n    $P(x) = x + c \\prod_{i=1}^{9} (x - x_i)$\n    where $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_9$ are distinct real numbers and $c$ is a non-zero constant. The fixed points of $P(x)$ are the solutions to $P(x) = x$, which are precisely $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_9$. So, $P(x)$ has 9 fixed points.\n\n    Now, we must check if such a polynomial can be strictly increasing. The derivative is:\n    $P'(x) = 1 + c \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{9} (x - x_i) \\right)$\n    Let $Q(x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{9} (x - x_i)$. $Q'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. Since the degree is even and the leading coefficient is positive, $Q'(x)$ has a global minimum value, let's call it $m$.\n    To ensure $P'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, we need $1 + c Q'(x) > 0$.\n    If we choose $c$ to be a small positive number, we can satisfy this condition. Specifically, if we choose $c > 0$ such that $c < -1/m$ (if $m$ is negative), the condition $P'(x) > 0$ will hold for all $x$.\n\n    This shows that there exists a strictly increasing polynomial of degree 9 with 9 fixed points.\n\n6.  **Decomposability:**\n    The final step is to ascertain whether such a polynomial $h(x)$ with 9 fixed points and $h'(x)>0$ can be expressed as a composition of two cubic polynomials $f$ and $g$ with $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$.\n    The problem of the number of fixed points of polynomial compositions has been studied in mathematics. It is a known result that the maximum number of fixed points of the composition of two polynomials of degrees $m$ and $n$ is $mn$. Furthermore, this bound is sharp, meaning it can be achieved for any $m, n \\ge 2$.\n    While constructing an explicit example is complex, the theoretical framework does not preclude the existence of such polynomials $f$ and $g$. The conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ ensure that the resulting degree-9 polynomial $h(x)$ is strictly increasing, but it does not impose a stricter limit on the number of times its graph can intersect the line $y=x$. The \"wiggling\" nature of a degree 9 polynomial, which allows for 9 intersections, is governed by its higher-order derivatives. An analysis using Rolle's Theorem shows that a degree 9 polynomial having 9 roots is consistent with its derivatives up to the 8th order having the required number of roots. This structure is compatible with the structure of the derivatives of a composite function $f(g(x))$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
