    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors: white (which can appear yellow), red, violet, black, and scarlet.\n\nPhosphorus has several allotropes, each with unique properties and appearances. The most common forms are white and red phosphorus.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** When pure, this allotrope is a colorless or white waxy solid. However, upon exposure to light or due to impurities, it can take on a pale yellow hue, leading to it also being referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** As its name suggests, this allotrope is red in color. It is more stable and less reactive than white phosphorus.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this crystalline form is violet or a reddish-purple color.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope and has a black, flaky appearance, similar to graphite. It is a conductor of electricity.\n*   **Scarlet Phosphorus:** A less common allotrope, scarlet phosphorus can be produced by heating phosphorus tribromide with mercury.\n\n<<<5>>>"
