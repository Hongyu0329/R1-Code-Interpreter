    "A self-avoiding walk on a Manhattan lattice, also known as a square lattice, is a path on the grid that does not visit the same point more than once. The number of such distinct walks of a given length, `n`, is denoted by a(n). This sequence of numbers is a well-studied problem in combinatorics and physics, though no simple formula for a(n) is known.\n\nThe number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. The initial terms of the sequence are:\n*   a(0) = 1 (a walk of zero steps is a single point)\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   a(10) = 44100\n\nFor a 10-step self-avoiding walk, the number of possible paths is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
