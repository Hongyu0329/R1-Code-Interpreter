    "Until the late 19th century, the Pantheon in Rome's Piazza della Rotonda was adorned with a unique architectural feature: a pair of bell towers. These towers, added in the 17th century, were a significant alteration to the ancient temple's original appearance.\n\nThe bell towers were derisively nicknamed the \"ass's ears\" by the Roman populace, reflecting their unpopularity. While often misattributed to the famed Baroque artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini, historical records suggest they were likely designed by his rivals, Carlo Maderno and Francesco Borromini.\n\nIn a move to restore the Pantheon to a semblance of its original classical state, the bell towers were demolished. This removal took place in the late 19th century, with sources indicating the year as either 1883 or 1892. Although this is earlier than the 1950 date specified in the question, the removal of these prominent and widely discussed towers represents the most significant architectural alteration of this nature to the Pantheon in that era.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers, known as the \"ass's ears\".>>>"
