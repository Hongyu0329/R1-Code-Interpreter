    "To fully and unambiguously identify any of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases, a minimum of 5 non-top-facing stickers must be seen.\n\nWhen solving the last layer in the CFOP method, after completing OLL, the top face is a solid color, and the permutation of the pieces is identified by the stickers on the four side faces. There are 12 of these stickers in total (one on each of the four edge pieces and two on each of the four corner pieces).\n\nWhile standard \"2-side recognition\" techniques, which are sufficient to distinguish all cases, involve looking at the 6 stickers on two adjacent faces, this is not the absolute minimum. Advanced recognition systems have been developed that reduce the required number of stickers.\n\nThrough computational analysis and the development of specific recognition strategies (like the \"Straughan recognition\" concept), it has been demonstrated that a carefully selected set of 5 stickers is the minimum required to guarantee differentiation between all 21 PLL cases. For example, one such sufficient set includes the stickers from the UFL, UF, UFR, UR, and UBR pieces. While it is possible to distinguish many cases with fewer stickers, 5 is the minimum number needed to resolve the most ambiguous pairs of cases in a single look.\n\n<<<5>>>"
