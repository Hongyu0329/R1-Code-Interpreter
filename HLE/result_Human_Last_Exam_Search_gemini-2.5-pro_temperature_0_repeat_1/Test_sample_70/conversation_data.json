    "<<<The flag of Denmark and the flags of Madagascar, Mauritania, Senegal, and Somalia share a linear algebraic rank of 2.\n\nThe linear algebraic rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in that matrix. To determine the rank of a flag, it can be represented as a matrix where different colors correspond to different numerical values. To ensure the rank is maximal, these values are chosen to be linearly independent, meaning the rank is determined by the flag's geometric pattern.\n\nThe flag of Denmark, known as the Dannebrog, consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. This pattern of a single cross on a solid background creates a matrix with two linearly independent row types and two linearly independent column types, resulting in a rank of 2.\n\nSeveral African nations have flags whose designs also result in a rank of 2:\n*   **Madagascar:** The flag has a white vertical band on the hoist side with horizontal red and green bands. This arrangement creates two unique row patterns and two unique column patterns, giving it a rank of 2.\n*   **Mauritania:** The flag features a green field with a gold crescent and star, with red bands at the top and bottom. Despite having three colors, the structure, with the emblem contained within the central field, results in only two linearly independent row types and two linearly independent column types, yielding a rank of 2.\n*   **Senegal:** The flag is a vertical tricolor of green, yellow, and red, with a green five-pointed star in the central yellow band. The star's presence, being the same color as the hoist-side band, breaks the simple tricolor pattern. An analysis of the matrix shows that while there are three distinct column colors, one column vector is a scalar multiple of another, resulting in a column space dimension of 2. The row space also has a dimension of 2, giving the flag a rank of 2.\n*   **Somalia:** The flag consists of a light blue field with a central white five-pointed star. Similar to the Danish flag, this design of a single-colored emblem on a monochromatic field creates a matrix with a rank of 2.>>>"
