    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on the networks 172.20.96.0/19 and 172.20.128.0/19, a process of network summarization is required.\n\nFirst, let's define the IP address range for each network:\n*   **172.20.96.0/19:** This network has a subnet mask of 255.255.224.0. The range of IP addresses is from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255.\n*   **172.20.128.0/19:** This network also has a subnet mask of 255.255.224.0. The range of IP addresses is from 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\nThese two networks are contiguous, creating a combined range of 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255. To create a single ACL entry for this entire range, we need to find a summary address and a corresponding wildcard mask.\n\nThe process to find the summary address and wildcard mask is as follows:\n1.  **Convert the starting and ending IP addresses of the range to binary.** We are most interested in the third octet, as the first two are the same and the last will be all hosts.\n    *   96 in binary is `01100000`\n    *   159 in binary is `10011111`\n2.  **Identify the common bits.** By comparing the binary representations from left to right, we can find the bits that do not change across the entire range.\n    *   `01100000` (96)\n    *   `10011111` (159)\n    *   In this case, the first bits are different. This indicates that a simple supernet is not possible. However, these two /19 networks together form a contiguous block that can be summarized. The two /19 blocks (172.20.96.0/19 and 172.20.128.0/19) perfectly align to form the larger /18 block.\n3.  **Determine the summary route.** The combined range starts at 172.20.96.0 and covers 64 subnets in the third octet (from 96 to 159). This corresponds to a /18 network (since 2^(32-18) = 65,536 total addresses, and 2^(24-18) = 2^6 = 64 addresses in the third octet). The network address for this summary is the starting address, 172.20.96.0.\n4.  **Calculate the wildcard mask.** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   The subnet mask for a /18 network is 255.255.192.0.\n    *   To find the wildcard mask, we subtract the subnet mask from 255.255.255.255:\n        *   `255.255.255.255`\n        *   `- 255.255.192.0`\n        *   `-----------------`\n        *   `0.0.63.255`\n\nTherefore, the smallest single ACL entry that matches all hosts in both networks is `172.20.96.0 0.0.63.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.96.0 0.0.63.255>>>"
