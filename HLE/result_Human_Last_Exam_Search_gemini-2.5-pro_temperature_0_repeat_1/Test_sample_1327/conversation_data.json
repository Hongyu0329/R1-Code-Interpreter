    "To find the number that should be filled in the parentheses in the sequence 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, we need to identify the underlying pattern.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between consecutive terms:\n*   11 = 2 × 2 + 7\n*   23 = 2 × 11 + 1\n*   51 = 2 × 23 + 5\n*   119 = 2 × 51 + 17\n\nThis approach does not reveal a simple pattern in the numbers being added (7, 1, 5, 17).\n\nLet's try another method by examining the relationship with powers of 2:\n*   The first term is 2.\n*   The second term is 11, which can be expressed as 2³ + 3 = 8 + 3.\n*   The third term is 23, which can be expressed as 2⁴ + 7 = 16 + 7.\n*   The fourth term is 51, which can be expressed as 2⁵ + 19 = 32 + 19.\n*   The fifth term is 119, which can be expressed as 2⁶ + 55 = 64 + 55.\n\nNow, let's look at the sequence of the numbers that are added to the powers of 2: 3, 7, 19, 55. Let's find the differences between these numbers:\n*   7 - 3 = 4\n*   19 - 7 = 12\n*   55 - 19 = 36\n\nThe differences (4, 12, 36) form a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3 to get the next term. Following this pattern, the next difference will be 36 × 3 = 108.\n\nWe can find the next term in the sequence of added numbers by adding this difference to the last term: 55 + 108 = 163.\n\nFinally, to find the next term in the original sequence, we follow the established pattern: 2⁷ + 163.\n*   2⁷ = 128\n*   128 + 163 = 291\n\nTherefore, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
