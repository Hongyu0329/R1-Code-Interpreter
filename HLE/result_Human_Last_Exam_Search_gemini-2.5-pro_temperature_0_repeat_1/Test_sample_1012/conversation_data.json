    "An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer could theoretically break symmetric-key encryption using Grover's algorithm, which offers a significant speed-up over classical brute-force attacks. This algorithm effectively halves the bit-strength of a symmetric key.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the impact:\n\n*   **Grover's Algorithm:** For a symmetric key of 'n' bits, a classical computer would need to perform, on average, 2^(n-1) operations to find the key. A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm could find the key in approximately 2^(n/2) operations.\n*   **Security Reduction:** This means a 128-bit symmetric key, which is considered very secure against classical computers, would only offer a security level equivalent to a 64-bit key against a quantum computer. A 64-bit security level is not considered sufficient.\n*   **The Solution:** To mitigate this quantum threat, the straightforward recommendation from cryptographers and security agencies is to double the key length.\n*   **Recommended Key Length:** To achieve a 128-bit security level in a post-quantum world, a symmetric key of at least 256 bits is necessary. An algorithm like AES-256, which utilizes a 256-bit key, would have its effective security reduced to 128 bits by a quantum computer, a level that is still considered secure.\n\nTherefore, a symmetric key must be at least 256 bits long to be secure against an attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
