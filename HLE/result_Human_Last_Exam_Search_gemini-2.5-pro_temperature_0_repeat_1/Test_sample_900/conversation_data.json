    "It is not possible to determine the exact number of \"pas de Balanchine\" Svetlana Gileva performed in the Jete Woman solo scene of the Forsythe production \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for the Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nThere are several reasons for this:\n\n*   **Ambiguous Terminology:** The term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a standard or formally recognized term in ballet vocabulary. It is possible this is a colloquial or misinterpreted name for another ballet step. Without a precise definition of what a \"pas de Balanchine\" entails, it is impossible to count its occurrences.\n*   **Lack of Available Visual Evidence:** While records confirm Svetlana Gileva performed this role with the Semperoper Ballett in 2015, publicly available videos of her specific \"Jete Woman\" solo from that time are not accessible. Reviews and articles from the period praise her performance but do not provide a detailed choreographic breakdown of the steps performed.\n\nSvetlana Gileva was a principal dancer with the Semperoper Ballett at the time of the performance. The production of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" by William Forsythe is a well-documented and celebrated piece of modern ballet. However, without a visual reference of the specific solo or a clear definition of the step in question, a numerical count cannot be provided.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific number for the requested ballet step as the term is not standard and there is no available video of the performance to analyze.>>>"
