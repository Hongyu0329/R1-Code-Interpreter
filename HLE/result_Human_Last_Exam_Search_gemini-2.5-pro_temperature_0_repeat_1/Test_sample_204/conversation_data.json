    "The Hopf charge, or Hopf invariant, of a vector field `n(x,y,z)` that maps the 3D space (`R^3`) to the surface of a 2D sphere (`S^2`) can be determined using the Whitehead integral formula. However, a more intuitive method for fields with a specific topological structure, known as hopfions, is to calculate it as the product of two integer winding numbers: the toroidal winding number (`m`) and the poloidal winding number (`n`).\n\nThe given vector field is:\n`nx = sin(G)cos(f)`\n`ny = sin(G)sin(f)`\n`nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis field represents a unit vector, as `nx² + ny² + nz² = 1`, thus defining a map from the physical space `(x,y,z)` to the surface of a unit sphere `S²`, parameterized by the angles `(G, f)`.\n\nThe functions `G` and `f` are defined as:\n`f = atan2(y,x)`\n`r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`\n`G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))`\n\nThis structure is characteristic of a hopfion, a topological soliton in three dimensions. We can determine its Hopf charge by identifying the winding numbers `m` and `n`.\n\n1.  **Toroidal Winding Number (m):** This number describes how the vector field winds around the z-axis. The angle `f = atan2(y,x)` is the standard azimuthal angle in cylindrical coordinates. As one traces a loop in the `(x,y)` plane around the origin, `f` changes by `2π`. This corresponds to a single wrap in the toroidal direction. Therefore, the toroidal winding number `m = 1`.\n\n2.  **Poloidal Winding Number (n):** This number describes the winding of the field in the poloidal direction (from pole to pole on the `S²` sphere). This is determined by the function `G`.\n    *   The \"core\" of the hopfion is defined by the points where `r2 = 0`. This occurs on a circle in the `z=0` plane with radius `sqrt(0.5)`. At this core, `G = π * exp(0) = π`. This corresponds to the south pole of the `S²` sphere, where `n = (0, 0, -1)`.\n    *   At spatial infinity (`(x,y,z) -> ∞`), the distance `r2` also goes to infinity. In this limit, `G = π * exp(-∞) = 0`. This corresponds to the north pole of the `S²` sphere, where `n = (0, 0, 1)`.\n\n    As we move from the core of the hopfion to infinity, the angle `G` sweeps from `π` to `0`. The poloidal winding number `n` is given by the total change in `G` divided by `π`. Depending on the sign convention, this is calculated as `n = |(G_infinity - G_core) / π| = |(0 - π) / π| = 1`.\n\n3.  **Hopf Charge (H):** The Hopf charge is the product of the toroidal and poloidal winding numbers, `H = n * m`.\n    `H = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\nThe Hopf charge can also be interpreted as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points on the target sphere `S²`. For this specific field configuration, the preimage of the south pole is the circle `x² + y² = 0.5, z=0`, and the preimage of any point on the equator is a curve that links this circle exactly once, confirming that the linking number is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
