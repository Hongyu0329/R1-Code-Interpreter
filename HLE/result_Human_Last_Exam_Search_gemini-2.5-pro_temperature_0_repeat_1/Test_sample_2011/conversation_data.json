    "The search results primarily discuss the number of *maximal* cliques or the total number of cliques of any size, rather than the number of *different clique sizes*. The definition of a clique is consistent across the sources and matches the one used in the reasoning: a subset of vertices where every two are connected, which is equivalent to a complete induced subgraph.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding what determines the set of possible clique sizes in a graph.\n\nLet G be a graph on n = 128 vertices. A clique size is an integer *k* for which there exists a subset of *k* vertices in G that induces a complete graph (a clique, K_k).\n\nLet's analyze the set of possible clique sizes. If a graph G contains an induced clique of size *k*, let's call it C_k, which is formed by a set of *k* vertices. Then, any subset of *j* vertices (where 1 ≤ j < k) chosen from the vertices of C_k will also form a complete induced subgraph, which is a clique of size *j*.\n\nThis leads to a crucial property: if a graph has an induced clique of size *k*, it must also have induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to *k*. Therefore, the set of all possible clique sizes in any graph G is always of the form {1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}, where ω(G) is the clique number of G, representing the size of the largest clique in the graph.\n\nThe problem of finding the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is thus equivalent to finding the maximum possible clique number, ω(G), for a graph with 128 vertices.\n\nFor any graph G with n vertices, the size of any clique cannot exceed the total number of vertices. Therefore, ω(G) ≤ n. For n = 128, the maximum possible clique number is 128.\n\nThis maximum value is achieved by the complete graph, K_128. In a complete graph on 128 vertices, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. Any subset of *k* vertices from K_128, for any *k* from 1 to 128, forms an induced clique of size *k*.\n\nTherefore, for the graph G = K_128:\n*   The clique number is ω(K_128) = 128.\n*   The set of all clique sizes that appear as induced subgraphs is {1, 2, 3, ..., 128}.\n*   The number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\nSince no graph on 128 vertices can have a clique number greater than 128, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
