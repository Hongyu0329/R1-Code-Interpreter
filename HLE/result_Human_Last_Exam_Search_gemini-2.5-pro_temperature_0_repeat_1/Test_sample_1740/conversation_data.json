    "To date, there is a consensus that the human let-7 family comprises 10 unique mature microRNA (miRNA) sequences. These distinct mature members are let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, miR-98, and miR-202.\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the number of mature miRNAs and their precursor genes. While there are 10 different mature let-7 miRNAs, they are encoded by a larger number of precursor genes. For instance, some sources indicate that these 10 mature miRNAs are derived from 13 precursor genes. This is because some identical mature miRNAs can be produced from different genomic locations. As an example, the mature let-7a is encoded by three different precursor genes (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, and let-7a-3), and the mature let-7f is produced by two precursors (let-7f-1 and let-7f-2).\n\nOther sources might mention slightly different numbers, such as 9 mature let-7 miRNAs encoded by 12 distinct loci, or up to 12 or 13 members, which often refers to the number of precursor genes rather than the unique mature sequences. However, the most frequently cited and detailed sources point to 10 distinct mature let-7 family members in humans.\n\n<<<10>>>"
