    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem. The strategy employed is to read the input character by character, use a counting sort methodology with the smallest possible integer types, and then print the result using the counts, thereby avoiding the need to store the entire input string in memory.\n\n### Memory-Efficient C Program\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/*\n * This program solves the Xenia and the Sum problem with a focus on\n * minimizing memory usage.\n *\n * Strategy:\n * 1. Avoid storing the entire input string. Instead, read it character\n *    by character.\n * 2. Use an array of `short int` to count the occurrences of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n *    `short int` is used instead of `int` because the maximum count of any\n *    number will be approximately 501 (for a 1000-character input like \"1+1+...+1\"),\n *    which comfortably fits within the range of a short.\n * 3. Keep a running total of the number of summands to correctly place the \"+\" signs\n *    during output without needing an extra flag variable.\n * 4. The printing logic is unrolled into four separate loops to avoid the need for\n *    loop counter variables, further saving memory.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Variable Declaration & Memory Allocation:\n    // counts: An array to store the frequency of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    //         4 * sizeof(short) = 4 * 2 = 8 bytes.\n    // c: A character variable to read the input stream.\n    //    1 * sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    // total_summands: A counter for the total numbers to handle '+' printing.\n    //                 1 * sizeof(short) = 2 bytes.\n    short counts[4] = {0};\n    char c;\n    short total_summands = 0;\n\n    // Read the input character by character until the end of the line.\n    // Count the occurrences of each number and the total number of summands.\n    while (scanf(\"%c\", &c) == 1 && c != '\\n') {\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n            total_summands++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print the numbers in non-decreasing order.\n    // The loops are unrolled to avoid using loop counter variables (like i, j).\n    // The `total_summands` variable is used to decide whether to print a \"+\".\n\n    // Print all '1's\n    while (counts[0]-- > 0) {\n        printf(\"1\");\n        if (--total_summands > 0) {\n            printf(\"+\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print all '2's\n    while (counts[1]-- > 0) {\n        printf(\"2\");\n        if (--total_summands > 0) {\n            printf(\"+\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print all '3's\n    while (counts[2]-- > 0) {\n        printf(\"3\");\n        if (--total_summands > 0) {\n            printf(\"+\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    // Print all '4's\n    while (counts[3]-- > 0) {\n        printf(\"4\");\n        if (--total_summands > 0) {\n            printf(\"+\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation\n\nThe total memory `m` used for the variables in this program is calculated as follows, assuming standard data type sizes in a typical competitive programming environment (`sizeof(char) = 1`, `sizeof(short) = 2`):\n\n1.  `short counts[4]`: An array of 4 short integers to count the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n    *   Memory = `4 * sizeof(short)` = `4 * 2` = **8 bytes**.\n2.  `char c`: A single character variable to read the input stream one character at a time.\n    *   Memory = `1 * sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n3.  `short total_summands`: A short integer to count the total number of summands, used for placing the `+` symbols correctly.\n    *   Memory = `1 * sizeof(short)` = **2 bytes**.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables:\nm = 8 bytes (for `counts`) + 1 byte (for `c`) + 2 bytes (for `total_summands`) = 11 bytes.\n\n<<<11>>>"
