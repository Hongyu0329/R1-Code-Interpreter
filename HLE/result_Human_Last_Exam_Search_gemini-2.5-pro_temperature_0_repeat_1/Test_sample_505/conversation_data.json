    "In surface code, there are two primary methods for encoding multiple logical qubits: using multiple, distinct patches of code, or creating defects, known as holes, within a single patch. The question involves a combination of both approaches.\n\nA standard planar surface code patch without any holes encodes a single logical qubit. However, by introducing holes into the lattice, it's possible to encode more logical qubits within that same patch. The number of logical qubits that can be encoded is directly related to the number of holes created.\n\nFor a planar surface code, which is a surface with a boundary, creating *b* closed holes allows it to encode *k = b* logical qubits. Therefore, a single patch of surface code with two closed holes can encode two logical qubits.\n\nThe problem specifies two such patches. Since each patch is a distinct instance of the code, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits encoded in each patch. With each of the two patches containing two holes, each patch encodes two logical qubits.\n\nTherefore, the total number of logical qubits is 2 (from the first patch) + 2 (from the second patch) = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
