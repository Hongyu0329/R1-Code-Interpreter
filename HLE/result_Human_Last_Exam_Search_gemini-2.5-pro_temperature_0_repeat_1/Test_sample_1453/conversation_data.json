    "The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein is largely determined by the identity of the amino acid residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat, which form the hydrophobic core through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\nFirst, the provided amino acid sequence, `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, must be aligned to the `abcdefg` heptad repeat to identify the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions. The most plausible alignment, which places hydrophobic residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions, is as follows:\n\n`f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e`\n`G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\nThis alignment reveals a consistent pattern for the core residues:\n*   **'a' positions:** Isoleucine (I)\n*   **'d' positions:** Leucine (L)\n\nLandmark studies on the GCN4 coiled-coil established a set of rules that correlate the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions with the resulting oligomeric state. These rules are based on the efficiency of the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of the side chains.\n\nThe specific rules are as follows:\n*   **Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd'** promotes the formation of a **dimer**.\n*   **Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd'** favors a **trimer**.\n*   **Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd'** favors a **tetramer**.\n\nBased on the analysis of the given sequence, the repeating pattern of Isoleucine at the 'a' position and Leucine at the 'd' position strongly indicates that the protein will form a dimer.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state would be 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
