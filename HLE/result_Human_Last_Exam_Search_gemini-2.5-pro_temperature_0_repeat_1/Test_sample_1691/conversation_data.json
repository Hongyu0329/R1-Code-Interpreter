    "An analytical formula that approximates the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for the small $\\epsilon$ regime can be developed using asymptotic analysis. The behavior of the integral for small $\\epsilon$ is dominated by the region where the denominator is smallest, which occurs near $x=0$.\n\nThe method used is a singular perturbation expansion, also related to Laplace's method for integrals. We approximate the polynomial in the denominator by its behavior for small $x$, which is $f(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8 \\approx 9x^5 + 5x^6$. This allows us to find the leading terms of the asymptotic expansion of the integral.\n\nThe resulting analytical formula is an asymptotic expansion in fractional powers of $\\epsilon$:\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx A \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5} + B \\cdot \\epsilon^{-3/5}$\n\nwhere the coefficients A and B are given by:\n\n$A = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$\n\n$B = - \\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)}$\n\nThis formula provides a good approximation of the integral for small positive values of $\\epsilon$. The first term, proportional to $\\epsilon^{-4/5}$, is the dominant term, and the second term, proportional to $\\epsilon^{-3/5}$, provides the first correction.\n\n<<<For the small $\\epsilon$ regime, the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ can be approximated by the following analytical formula:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5} - \\frac{2\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{7/5} \\sin(2\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-3/5}$>>>"
