    "In a game of chess where two players cooperate to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares, 14 squares would remain without a bishop.\n\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has 28 edge squares. The challenge lies in placing as many bishops as possible on these squares so that no two bishops threaten each other. Bishops attack along diagonals, and a key constraint is that a bishop on a light-colored square can only attack another bishop on a light-colored square, and the same applies to dark-colored squares.\n\nThe 28 edge squares are evenly divided into 14 light and 14 dark squares. By analyzing the diagonals, it can be determined that a maximum of seven bishops can be placed on the dark edge squares without any of them attacking each other. Similarly, a maximum of seven bishops can be placed on the light edge squares.\n\nSince bishops on different colored squares cannot attack one another, the placements on light and dark squares are independent. Therefore, the total number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the perimeter is the sum of the maximums for each color, which is 7 (dark) + 7 (light) = 14 bishops.\n\nWith a total of 28 edge squares and a maximum of 14 bishops placed, the number of edge squares lacking a bishop is:\n\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (maximum bishops) = 14 squares.\n\n<<<14>>>"
