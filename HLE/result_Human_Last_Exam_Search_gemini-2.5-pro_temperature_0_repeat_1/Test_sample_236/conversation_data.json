    "Three distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knots and Relevant Surgeries:** The knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). The homology cobordism group, denoted Θ³_H, consists of integral homology 3-spheres. A Dehn surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere S³ results in an integral homology sphere if and only if the surgery coefficient is ±1. Therefore, only +1 and -1 surgeries on these knots can produce elements of this group.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Knot:**\n    *   **Unknot (0₁):** Both +1 and -1 surgery on the unknot yield the standard 3-sphere, S³. In the homology cobordism group, S³ represents the trivial element (the identity).\n    *   **Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** The figure-eight knot is a slice knot. A theorem by Casson and Gordon implies that any integral surgery on a slice knot results in a homology sphere that is homology cobordant to S³. Thus, ±1 surgery on the 4₁ knot only yields the trivial element, which has already been accounted for.\n    *   **Trefoil Knot (3₁):** The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image. We must consider surgeries on both the right-handed trefoil (T_R) and the left-handed trefoil (T_L).\n        *   **+1 surgery on T_R:** This produces the Poincaré homology sphere, Σ(2,3,5).\n        *   **-1 surgery on T_R:** This produces the Brieskorn sphere -Σ(2,3,7).\n        *   **+1 surgery on T_L:** This produces Σ(2,3,7).\n        *   **-1 surgery on T_L:** This produces -Σ(2,3,5).\n\n3.  **Count the Distinct Homology Cobordism Classes:**\n    *   **The Trivial Element [S³]:** This class is produced by surgery on the unknot and the figure-eight knot.\n    *   **The Class of the Poincaré Sphere [Σ(2,3,5)]:** This manifold is non-trivial in the homology cobordism group. Its Rokhlin invariant is 1, which implies it is an element of order 2 in the group, meaning it is its own inverse ([Σ(2,3,5)] = [-Σ(2,3,5)]). This single class represents the results of +1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil and -1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil.\n    *   **The Class of the Brieskorn Sphere [Σ(2,3,7)]:** This manifold is also non-trivial. Like the Poincaré sphere, its Rokhlin invariant is 1, so it is also an element of order 2 ([Σ(2,3,7)] = [-Σ(2,3,7)]). This class represents the results of +1 surgery on the left-handed trefoil and -1 surgery on the right-handed trefoil.\n\nThe three resulting classes, [S³], [Σ(2,3,5)], and [Σ(2,3,7)], are distinct from one another. Their distinction can be confirmed using invariants such as Heegaard Floer homology or d-invariants.\n\nTherefore, the surgeries on knots with at most four crossings represent a total of three unique elements in the homology cobordism group.\n\n<<<3>>>"
