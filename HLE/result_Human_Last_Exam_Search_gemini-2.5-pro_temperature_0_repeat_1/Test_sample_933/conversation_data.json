    "The most common and efficient method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) involves the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2) gases in a nickel container. This reaction is typically carried out at an elevated temperature.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, the optimal temperature for the production of XeF4 is approximately 400°C. The reaction is generally performed with a xenon to fluorine molar ratio of 1:5 and at a pressure of about 6 atmospheres. A US patent for this process specifies a temperature range between 350°C and 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature for a quantitative reaction.\n\nWhile flow methods can be used in a temperature range of 300-500°C, these can result in contamination with xenon difluoride (XeF2). The original synthesis of XeF4, first achieved in 1962, was also conducted by heating the elements at 400°C. Other synthesis methods, such as using electric discharge or photochemical irradiation, exist, but the thermal method at 400°C is the most frequently cited for efficient production.\n\nComparing this information with the provided answer choices, 400°C is the lowest temperature listed at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be efficiently produced.\n\n<<<B>>>"
