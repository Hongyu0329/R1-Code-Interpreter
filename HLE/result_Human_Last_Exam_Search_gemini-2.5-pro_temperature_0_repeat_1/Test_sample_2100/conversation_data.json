    "The man Andrei Voznesensky wrote about was the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\nVoznesensky's famous rock opera, \"Juno and Avos,\" which premiered in 1981, is based on the tragic love story of Rezanov and María de la Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco. The libretto was based on Voznesensky's 1970 poem \"Avos!\".\n\nRezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in March 1807, while on his return journey to St. Petersburg to seek the Tsar's permission to marry Concepción. He was buried at the Resurrection Cathedral in Krasnoyarsk, and a monument was erected on his grave in 1831. However, the cathedral was destroyed during the Soviet era, and the original grave was lost.\n\nThe \"answer\" to the question of his grave's location emerged metaphorically in the 1980s with the immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos,\" which brought Rezanov's story to national prominence. While his physical remains were reportedly moved to the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk in the late 1950s, a new memorial cross was officially dedicated there in October 2000. This monument features the lines \"I will never forget you\" and \"I will never see you again,\" echoing a song from the rock opera.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
