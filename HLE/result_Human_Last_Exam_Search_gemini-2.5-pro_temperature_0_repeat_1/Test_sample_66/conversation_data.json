    "The analysis of the flag of Tonga's structure is consistent with the search results. The flag consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner, which contains a red couped cross. This confirms the three distinct regions used in the reasoning: a general red background, a white rectangular area (the canton), and a red cross within that white area.\n\nThe matrix representing the flag will have its entries determined by which of these three regions a pixel falls into.\n*   Pixels in the main red field are given the value $a$.\n*   Pixels in the white area of the canton are given the value $b$.\n*   Pixels in the red cross within the canton are given the value $a$.\n\nLet's analyze the rows of this matrix.\n1.  **Rows below the canton:** These rows consist entirely of red pixels, so all entries are $a$. All these rows are identical.\n2.  **Rows that intersect the horizontal bar of the red cross:** The portion of the row within the canton is entirely red ($a$), and the portion outside the canton is also red ($a$). Therefore, these rows also consist entirely of the value $a$.\n3.  **Rows that intersect the white part of the canton:** These rows pass through the white background and the vertical part of the red cross.\n    *   The segment of the row outside the canton has the value $a$.\n    *   The segment of the row inside the canton has values $b$ for the white background and $a$ for the vertical bar of the cross.\n    *   All such rows will have the same pattern: a section of $b$'s interrupted by a smaller section of $a$'s (the cross), followed by a long section of $a$'s (the rest of the flag). All these rows are identical to each other.\n\nConsequently, there are only two distinct types of rows in the entire matrix:\n*   **Type 1:** A row composed entirely of the value $a$.\n*   **Type 2:** A row with a mix of $a$'s and $b$'s, corresponding to the white parts of the canton.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows. Since the entire set of rows in the matrix consists of only two distinct vectors, the row space is spanned by these two vectors.\n\nThe maximal rank is achieved when these two vectors are linearly independent.\n*   Let `v1 = [a, a, a, ..., a]`.\n*   Let `v2` be the other distinct row vector.\n\nIf $a = b$, then both row types become identical, and the rank of the matrix is 1 (assuming $a \\neq 0$). If we choose $a \\neq b$, the two row vectors are linearly independent. For instance, if $a=1$ and $b=0$, `v1` is a vector of all ones, and `v2` is a vector with some zeros, so they cannot be multiples of each other.\n\nSince the row space is spanned by at most two vectors, the rank of the matrix can be no greater than 2. By choosing values for $a$ and $b$ such that $a \\neq b$ (for example, $a=1, b=0$ or $a=2, b=1$), we ensure that the two distinct row types are linearly independent. This results in a rank of 2.\n\nTherefore, the maximal possible rank of this matrix is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
