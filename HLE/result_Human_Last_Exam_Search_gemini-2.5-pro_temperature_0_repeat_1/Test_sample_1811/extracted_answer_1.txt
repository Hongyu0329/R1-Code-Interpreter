If $\chi(\partial M) = 2\chi(M)$, the least number of zeros is 0. Otherwise, the least number of zeros is $|\chi(M)|$. Since a manifold must satisfy either $\chi(\partial M) = 2\chi(M)$ (for odd dimensions) or $\chi(\partial M) = 0$ (for even dimensions), the "otherwise" case corresponds to $\chi(\partial M) = 0$. Therefore, the answer is 0 if $\chi(\partial M) = 2\chi(M)$ and $|\chi(M)|$ if $\chi(\partial M) = 0$.
