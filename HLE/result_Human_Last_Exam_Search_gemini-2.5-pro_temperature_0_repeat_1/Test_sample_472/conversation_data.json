    "Based on a quantitative analysis of the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" from Terence's *Adelphoe*, which is written in the iambic senarius meter, the scansion is as follows. The meter consists of six feet, where iambs (S L) can be replaced by other feet like dactyls (L S S) or anapests (S S L).\n\nThe line is scanned with the following considerations:\n*   **Elision**: The final \"-e\" of \"bene\" elides with the initial \"e-\" of \"esse\".\n*   **Long by Position**: A vowel followed by two consonants is long (e.g., the 'e' in \"et\" before \"tibi\", the 'o' in \"quom\" before \"sibi\", and the 'i' in \"sit\" before \"male\").\n*   **Long by Nature**: The 'o' in \"soli\" is long.\n*   **Short by Nature**: Vowels that are not long by nature or position are short.\n*   **Final Syllable**: The final syllable of a line is considered long (*brevis in longo*).\n\nThe breakdown into six metrical feet is:\n\n1.  **et ti bi**: Dactyl (L S S)\n2.  **be n'es**: Iamb (S L)\n3.  **se so**: Iamb (S L)\n4.  **li quom**: Iamb (S L)\n5.  **si bi sit**: Anapest (S S L)\n6.  **ma le**: Iamb (S L)\n\n<<<L S S S L S L S L S S L S L>>>"
