    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix, the data is structured in a hierarchical binary tree. The matrix multiplication algorithm operates by traversing this tree, accessing the submatrices associated with each node.\n\nA hierarchical tree with a depth of 4 has 5 levels (from level 0 at the root to level 4 at the leaves). Assuming a full binary tree, which is standard for HSS representations, the number of nodes at each level `i` is 2<sup>i</sup>.\n\nThe total number of nodes, and therefore the number of submatrices accessed during multiplication, is the sum of the nodes at each level:\n\n*   **Level 0 (root):** 2<sup>0</sup> = 1 node\n*   **Level 1:** 2<sup>1</sup> = 2 nodes\n*   **Level 2:** 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 nodes\n*   **Level 3:** 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 nodes\n*   **Level 4 (leaves):** 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 nodes\n\nThe total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of the nodes across all levels:\n1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31\n\nEach of these nodes corresponds to a set of submatrices that are accessed during the multiplication process. The internal nodes have generator matrices for the off-diagonal blocks, and the leaf nodes contain the diagonal blocks of the matrix.\n\n<<<31>>>"
