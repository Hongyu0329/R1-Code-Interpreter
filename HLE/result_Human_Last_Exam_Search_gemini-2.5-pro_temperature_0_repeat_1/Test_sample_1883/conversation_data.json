    "### FMO Theory Predicts Exclusive Formation of the *cis*-Isomer\n\nUnder thermal conditions, the electrocyclic reaction of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, which form the basis for the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. This reaction involves the cyclization of a conjugated system with 8 π-electrons.\n\nAccording to FMO theory, the stereochemical outcome of a thermal pericyclic reaction is determined by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the open-chain partner. For a conjugated tetraene, which is an 8 π-electron system (a 4n system where n=2), the HOMO is ψ₄. The terminal p-orbitals of the ψ₄ HOMO have opposite phases. To achieve constructive overlap and form a new sigma (σ) bond, the termini of the polyene must rotate in the same direction—a process known as conrotatory ring closure.\n\nThe specific stereochemistry of the starting material, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, dictates the stereochemistry of the resulting product. In this molecule, the substituents at the termini of the conjugated system (C2 and C9) are a methyl group and a hydrogen atom.\n\n1.  At the C2 end, the (2Z) configuration places the methyl group and the hydrogen atom in specific positions relative to the rest of the carbon chain.\n2.  At the C9 end, the (8E) configuration also defines the spatial arrangement of the methyl group and hydrogen atom.\n\nWhen the molecule adopts the necessary s-cis conformation for ring closure, both methyl groups are positioned on the \"outside\" of the arc of the carbon chain, while the hydrogen atoms are on the \"inside\".\n\nDuring the conrotatory closure, both termini rotate in the same direction (either both clockwise or both counter-clockwise). This concerted motion forces both \"outside\" methyl groups to move to the same face of the newly forming ring. Consequently, the resulting product, 7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene, has the two methyl groups on the same side of the ring. This is the *cis*-isomer (A).\n\nThe alternative, the *trans*-isomer (B), would require the methyl groups to be on opposite sides of the ring. This would necessitate a disrotatory ring closure, where the termini rotate in opposite directions. However, for a thermal 8π-electron system, a disrotatory pathway is symmetry-forbidden by FMO theory as it would lead to destructive (antibonding) overlap of the HOMO lobes.\n\nTherefore, Frontier Molecular Orbital theory predicts that the reaction is highly stereospecific. The thermal electrocyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene should yield exclusively the *cis*-isomer (A). The formation of the *trans*-isomer (B) is predicted to be zero.\n\nBased on this analysis, the predicted ratio of A (*cis*-isomer) to B (*trans*-isomer) is 100:0.\n\n<<<100:0>>>"
