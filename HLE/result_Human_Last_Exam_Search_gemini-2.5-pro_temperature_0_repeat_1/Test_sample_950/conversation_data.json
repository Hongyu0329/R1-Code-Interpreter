    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 0.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation of this result:\n\n### 1. Identifying the Space\n\nThe space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G(3, 5)$. This space is diffeomorphic to the Grassmannian of 2-subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$, denoted $G(2, 5)$, by taking the orthogonal complement of each 3-subspace. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$. The space $G(3,5)$ is a compact, non-orientable manifold.\n\n### 2. The Integral Cohomology Ring\n\nThe integral cohomology ring, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, is the direct sum of the integral cohomology groups in each degree, $H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The calculation of these groups for real Grassmannians is a non-trivial task. According to specialized literature in algebraic topology, specifically the work of F. P. dos Santos, the integral cohomology groups for $G(3, 5) \\cong G(2, 5)$ are as follows:\n\n*   $H^0(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^5(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^6(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^k(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k > 6$.\n\n### 3. The Torsion Subgroup\n\nThe torsion subgroup of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order. The torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups from each degree:\n\n*   Torsion part of $H^0$: $0$\n*   Torsion part of $H^1$: $0$\n*   Torsion part of $H^2$: $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   Torsion part of $H^3$: $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   Torsion part of $H^4$: $0$\n*   Torsion part of $H^5$: $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   Torsion part of $H^6$: $0$\n\nSumming these up, the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring is $T = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n### 4. The Rank of the Torsion Subgroup\n\nThe rank of an abelian group is defined as the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset over the integers. Equivalently, it is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring the group with the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFor any torsion group, such as $T = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$, every element has a finite order. This means that for any element $x \\in T$, there exists a non-zero integer $n$ such that $nx = 0$. Consequently, any non-empty subset containing a non-zero element is linearly dependent over the integers. The only linearly independent subset is the empty set, which has a cardinality of 0. Therefore, the rank of any torsion group is 0.\n\nIt is worth noting that the term \"rank\" can sometimes be used informally to mean other things, such as the minimum number of generators (which is 3 for $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$) or the dimension as a vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ (which is also 3). However, in the standard terminology of group theory, the rank of this torsion subgroup is strictly 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
