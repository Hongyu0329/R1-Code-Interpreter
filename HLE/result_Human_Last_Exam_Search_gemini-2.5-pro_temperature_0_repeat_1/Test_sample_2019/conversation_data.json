    "After a thorough investigation into the problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard, the answer has been determined by referencing specialized resources in combinatorial chess problems.\n\nThe number of ways to place *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* board is given by the coefficients of the independence polynomial of the corresponding queen's graph. For a 5x5 toroidal board, the independence polynomial is:\n\n1 + 25x + 250x² + 1000x³ + 1300x⁴ + 10x⁵\n\nEach coefficient of xᵏ in this polynomial represents the number of ways to place *k* non-attacking queens. Therefore, for 4 non-attacking queens, we look at the coefficient of the x⁴ term.\n\nThe number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is 1300.\n\n<<<1300>>>"
