    "The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, when treated with a base like sodium ethoxide, is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate. This reaction is a notable example of ring contraction in cyclic α-halo ketones.\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity (Cm) is a quantitative measure of a molecule's complexity based on information theory. It is calculated by summing the information content of the chemical microenvironment of every atom in the molecule. This index is additive and sensitive to factors such as stereochemistry, the presence of heteroatoms, and molecular symmetry.\n\nCalculating the precise Böttcher Molecular Complexity value requires a specialized tool, such as the Böttcher Score calculator developed by the Forli Lab, which is based on the principles outlined by Thomas Böttcher. Since I cannot access external tools, I am unable to provide the final numerical value.\n\nHowever, the calculation can be performed using the web-based tool with the following information for the product molecule, ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate:\n*   **SMILES string:** CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a numerical answer as it requires using an external computational tool.>>>"
