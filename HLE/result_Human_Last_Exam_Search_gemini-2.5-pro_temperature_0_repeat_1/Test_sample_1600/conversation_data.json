    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams, denoted by a(n), for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics (QED) at order 2n depends on the specific counting rules used. A direct enumeration of all topologically distinct diagrams yields different sequences for the electron and photon propagators.\n\nHowever, the phrasing \"for the electron or the photon propagators\" suggests a context in which the number is the same for both. This is the case when one considers the number of \"primitive\" or \"topologically distinct\" one-particle-irreducible (1PI) diagrams, which correspond to the number of independent functions required for renormalization at a given loop order.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences as A002886. The sequence represents the number of topologically distinct Feynman diagrams for the electron self-energy with 2n vertices, and the same sequence applies to the photon self-energy (vacuum polarization).\n\nThe first few terms of this sequence a(n) are:\n*   a(1) = 1 (for order 2, which corresponds to 1-loop diagrams)\n*   a(2) = 1 (for order 4, which corresponds to 2-loop diagrams)\n*   a(3) = 2 (for order 6, which corresponds to 3-loop diagrams)\n*   a(4) = 4 (for order 8, which corresponds to 4-loop diagrams)\n\nThe question asks for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of these specific diagrams at order 6 (3 loops). According to the sequence, this value is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
