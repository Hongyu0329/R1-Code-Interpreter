In scalar field theory, for spatial dimensionalities *d* below the upper critical dimension of four, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, scales with *d* according to the epsilon expansion. To first order in ε = 4 - *d*, the relationship for an O(n)-symmetric model is given by the formula: α ≈ [(4 - n) / (2(n+8))] * (4 - *d*).
