    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional qudit density matrix is $d^2$. This maximum is achieved when the Pauli channel has a representation with the maximum number of non-zero Pauli error probabilities.\n\n### Derivation\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel and its Kraus Operators:** A qudit is a $d$-level quantum system, and its state is described by a $d \\times d$ density matrix $\\rho$. A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that describes decoherence due to random applications of generalized Pauli operators. It can be expressed using the operator-sum representation (or Kraus representation) as:\n\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$\n\n    Here, $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators for a $d$-dimensional system. These operators are unitary and form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $\\{p_k\\}$ are probabilities, satisfying $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$. The Kraus operators for this channel are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$.\n\n2.  **Complementary Channel and its Rank:** For any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$, the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ describes the information that \"leaks\" to the environment. The output of the complementary channel is given by:\n\n    $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l} \\text{Tr}(A_k \\rho A_l^\\dagger) |k\\rangle\\langle l|$\n\n    where $\\{|k\\rangle\\}$ form an orthonormal basis for the environment's Hilbert space, whose dimension is the number of Kraus operators. The rank of the complementary channel is the rank of the Gram matrix $G$ constructed from its Kraus operators, with entries $G_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(A_k^\\dagger A_l)$.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Rank for a Pauli Channel:** For a Pauli channel, the entries of the Gram matrix are:\n\n    $G_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(A_k^\\dagger A_l) = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_k} U_k)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_l} U_l)) = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\text{Tr}(U_k^\\dagger U_l)$\n\n    A key property of the generalized Pauli operators is their orthogonality with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product:\n\n    $\\text{Tr}(U_k^\\dagger U_l) = d \\cdot \\delta_{kl}$\n\n    where $\\delta_{kl}$ is the Kronecker delta. Substituting this into the expression for $G_{kl}$, we get:\n\n    $G_{kl} = d \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\delta_{kl}$\n\n    This shows that the Gram matrix $G$ is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries $d \\cdot p_k$.\n\n4.  **Maximizing the Rank:** The rank of a diagonal matrix is equal to the number of its non-zero diagonal entries. In this case, the rank of $G$ is the number of indices $k$ for which $p_k > 0$.\n\n    To find the *maximal* rank of the complementary channel, we need to choose a Pauli channel (i.e., a set of probabilities $\\{p_k\\}$) that maximizes the number of non-zero probabilities. Since there are $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, we can have at most $d^2$ non-zero probabilities.\n\n    A Pauli channel can be constructed where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero. A simple example is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k = 0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1$. For this channel, all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero.\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of non-zero entries in the Gram matrix is $d^2$, and thus the maximal rank of the complementary channel is $d^2$.\n\n<<<The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel for a qudit of dimension $d$ is $d^2$.>>>"
