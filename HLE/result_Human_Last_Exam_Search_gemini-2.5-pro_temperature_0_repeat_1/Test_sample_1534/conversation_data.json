    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes**, the **fin lobes**, and the **vasomotor lobes** (dorsal and ventral).\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a part of the posterior subesophageal mass, which is located in the posterior region of the cuttlefish brain. This mass also contains other lobes that control the more posterior parts of the animal's body.\n\nBased on the brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish, the palliovisceral lobe complex includes the following structures:\n*   Palliovisceral lobe\n*   Lateral ventral palliovisceral lobes\n*   Posterior chromatophore lobes\n*   Dorsal vasomotor lobe\n*   Ventral vasomotor lobe\n\nThe posterior chromatophore lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores (color-changing cells) on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass. The fin lobes control the movement of the fins. The palliovisceral lobe itself is involved in controlling escape movements and the ejection of ink. These lobes are all situated together in the posterior region of the subesophageal mass, as depicted in posterior views of the dwarf cuttlefish brain atlas.\n\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes, the fin lobes, and the vasomotor lobes.>>>"
