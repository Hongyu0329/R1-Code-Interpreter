    "Yes, there is an upper bound on the cardinality of $X$. The upper bound is the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step argument to establish this result:\n\n1.  **The dense open subset U is a 1-dimensional manifold.**\n    The condition that each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$ means that $U$ is a 1-dimensional topological manifold.\n\n2.  **The space U is second-countable and therefore separable.**\n    Since $X$ is a metric space, it is first-countable. As an open subset of a first-countable space, $U$ is also first-countable. A first-countable topological manifold is second-countable. A space is second-countable if it has a countable basis for its topology. A second-countable space is also separable, meaning it contains a countable dense subset. Let's call this countable dense subset of $U$ as $D$.\n\n3.  **The space X is separable.**\n    We can show that the countable dense subset $D$ of $U$ is also dense in $X$. Let $x$ be any point in $X$ and let $N$ be any open neighborhood of $x$. Since $U$ is dense in $X$, the intersection $N \\cap U$ is a non-empty open set in $U$. Because $D$ is dense in $U$, this non-empty open set must contain a point from $D$. Therefore, $N$ contains a point from $D$, which means $D$ is dense in $X$. Since $X$ contains a countable dense subset, $X$ is a separable space.\n\n4.  **Any separable metric space has a cardinality of at most the continuum.**\n    It is a standard result in topology that any separable metric space has a cardinality no greater than $2^{\\aleph_0}$, the cardinality of the real numbers. This can be shown by constructing an injective map from the space into the set of all sequences of elements from its countable dense set.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the upper bound.**\n    Since $X$ is a separable metric space, its cardinality is at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nFurthermore, since $X$ is a connected metric space with more than one point (as $U$ is a non-empty dense open subset), $X$ must be uncountable. Therefore, the cardinality of $X$ is between uncountable and $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nIn many typical cases, such as when $U$ is connected and not a single point, the cardinality of $U$ itself will be $2^{\\aleph_0}$, which would imply that the cardinality of $X$ is also $2^{\\aleph_0}$. For instance, any connected Hausdorff manifold with more than one point has a cardinality of $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n<<<Yes, the upper bound is the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$.>>>"
