    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the Galois group of the polynomial and the Chebotarev Density Theorem. This density is the proportion of elements in the Galois group that act as a single cycle on the roots of the polynomial. For the given polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$, the degree is 7, so we are interested in the proportion of 7-cycles in its Galois group.\n\nA search for the Galois group of this specific polynomial reveals that it is a known example in Galois theory. The Galois group of $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rational numbers is the Frobenius group $F_{21}$ (also known as the Metacyclic group of order 21). This group can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$.\n\nThe Frobenius group $F_{21}$ has an order of 21. Within this group, the elements can be analyzed by their cycle structure. The elements of order 7 in this group act as 7-cycles on the roots of the polynomial. The number of elements of order 7 in $F_{21}$ is 14.\n\nThe natural density is calculated as the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the Galois group.\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles in $F_{21}$) / (Order of $F_{21}$)\nDensity = 14 / 21\nDensity = 2/3\n\nThus, the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is 2/3.\n\n<<<2/3>>>"
