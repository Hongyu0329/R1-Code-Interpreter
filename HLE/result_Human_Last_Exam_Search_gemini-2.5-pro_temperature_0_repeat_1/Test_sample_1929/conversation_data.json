    "The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a cycloaddition reaction. Specifically, it is a [4+2] cycloaddition, commonly known as the Diels-Alder reaction. In this reaction, the conjugated diene (butadiene) reacts with the dienophile (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) to form a six-membered ring.\n\nThe product of this reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\nThe reaction can be represented as follows:\n\nCH₂=CH−CH=CH₂ (Butadiene) + CCl₂=CF₂ (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene) → 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene\n\nThis type of cycloaddition is a well-established reaction in organic chemistry. While [2+2] cycloadditions are also known to occur with fluorinated alkenes, the reaction with a conjugated diene like butadiene predominantly yields the [4+2] adduct. The resulting product is a cyclohexene derivative with the chlorine and fluorine atoms attached to one of the sp³-hybridized carbon atoms of the ring.\n\n<<<The product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene."
