    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) is determined by the topology of the torus, a result central to Morse theory.\n\nA key result from Morse theory is that for a smooth Morse function *f* on a compact manifold *M*, the number of critical points is at least the sum of its Betti numbers. A Morse function is one whose critical points are all non-degenerate.\n\nFor the 2-torus ($T^2$):\n*   The **Betti numbers**, which describe the topological features, are:\n    *   $b_0 = 1$ (it is one connected piece).\n    *   $b_1 = 2$ (it has two independent \"holes\" or loops).\n    *   $b_2 = 1$ (it encloses one volume).\n*   The **Morse inequalities** state that the number of critical points of index *k*, denoted $c_k$, must be at least the *k*-th Betti number, $b_k$.\n    *   $c_0 \\ge b_0 = 1$ (at least one local minimum).\n    *   $c_1 \\ge b_1 = 2$ (at least two saddle points).\n    *   $c_2 \\ge b_2 = 1$ (at least one local maximum).\n\nSumming these lower bounds gives the minimum total number of critical points for a Morse function:\nTotal critical points = $c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge b_0 + b_1 + b_2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\nThis theoretical minimum of 4 can be achieved. A standard example of a smooth Morse function on the torus that has exactly four critical points is the height function on a torus placed diagonally in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, or more simply, the function $f(\\theta, \\phi) = \\cos(\\theta) + \\cos(\\phi)$ defined on the square $[0, 2\\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$ with opposite sides identified. This function has:\n*   One local maximum.\n*   Two saddle points.\n*   One local minimum.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of critical points for a smooth Morse function on a 2-torus is 4.\n\nWhile it is possible for a general smooth function (which is not necessarily a Morse function) to have fewer critical points, this involves degenerate critical points. Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory provides a lower bound for any smooth function, which for the 2-torus is 3. However, the question typically implies non-degenerate scenarios as covered by classical Morse theory.\n\n<<<4>>>"
