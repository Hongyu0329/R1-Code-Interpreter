    "The minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\) is 210.\n\nThis problem is a well-known question in extremal graph theory. The minimum sum of the number of vertices of bipartite subgraphs whose edges cover the complete graph \\( K_n \\) is denoted by \\( s(K_n) \\).\n\nA theorem by Helge Tverberg states that the lower bound for this value is \\( n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\). For the complete graph \\( K_{35} \\):\n*   n = 35\n*   We need to calculate \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil \\). Since \\( 2^5 = 32 \\) and \\( 2^6 = 64 \\), the value of \\( \\log_2 35 \\) is between 5 and 6. Therefore, \\( \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6 \\).\n*   The lower bound is \\( 35 \\times 6 = 210 \\).\n\nThis lower bound is known to be tight when an upper bound matches it. A standard construction provides such an upper bound:\n1.  Consider a complete graph on \\( 2^6 = 64 \\) vertices, where vertices are represented by binary strings of length 6.\n2.  The edges of this larger graph can be covered by 6 bipartite graphs. In the i-th bipartite graph, the vertices are partitioned based on the i-th bit of their binary string representation.\n3.  By selecting any 35 of these 64 vertices, the induced subgraphs on these 35 vertices also form a bipartite covering of \\( K_{35} \\).\n4.  This construction yields a covering with 6 bipartite graphs, each on 35 vertices. The sum of the number of vertices is \\( 35 \\times 6 = 210 \\).\n\nSince the lower bound (210) and the upper bound (210) are equal, the minimum number of vertices is 210.\n\n<<<210>>>"
