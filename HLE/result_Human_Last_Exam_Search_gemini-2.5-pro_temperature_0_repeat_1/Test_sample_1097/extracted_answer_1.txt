The set M is the Banach space of continuous functions on the interval that satisfy the homogeneous boundary conditions, equipped with the supremum norm.

Specifically, M is defined as:
**M = {u ∈ C | u(0) = u(1) = 0}**

This set is a closed subset of the complete space C (the space of all continuous functions on with the supremum norm, ||u||_∞ = sup_{x∈} |u(x)|), and therefore M itself is a complete metric space.
