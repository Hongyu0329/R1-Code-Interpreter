    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function `Z` for a neutral scalar field `ϕ` is expressed using the functional integral formalism in Euclidean spacetime. The temperature `T` is introduced by making the Euclidean time dimension `τ` periodic with a period `β = 1/T`.\n\nThe partition function is defined as:\n`Z = ∫ Dϕ e^(-S_E[ϕ])`\nwhere the integral is over all field configurations `ϕ(τ, **x**)` that are periodic in `τ` with period `β`. `S_E[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action for the scalar field.\n\nFor a free (non-interacting) neutral scalar field with mass `m`, the Euclidean action is given by:\n`S_E[ϕ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ 1/2 (∂_τ ϕ)² + 1/2 (∇ϕ)² + 1/2 m²ϕ² ]`\n\nTo identify the inner product, it is conventional to write the action in a quadratic form. By performing an integration by parts on the derivative terms (and noting that the boundary terms vanish due to the periodicity of `ϕ` in `τ`), the action can be expressed as:\n`S_E[ϕ] = 1/2 ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(τ, **x**)`\n\nThis expression is of the general Gaussian form `exp[-1/2 (ϕ, D_ϕ)]`. From this, we can identify the operator `D_ϕ` and the associated inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)`.\n\nThe differential operator `D_ϕ` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n`D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²`\n\nThe inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation is the integral of the field `ϕ` multiplied by the result of applying the operator `D_ϕ` to `ϕ`. This inner product is defined over the Euclidean spacetime volume, which is a cylinder with length `β` in the time direction and infinite extent in the spatial directions.\n\nTherefore, the inner product is given by:\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) ϕ(τ, **x**)`\n\nThis can also be expressed in momentum space using the Matsubara formalism. By Fourier expanding the field `ϕ(τ, **x**)` with respect to the periodic time variable and continuous spatial variables:\n`ϕ(τ, **x**) = T ∑_{n=-∞}^{∞} ∫ (d³k/(2π)³) e^(iω_n τ + i**k**·**x**) ϕ̃(ω_n, **k**)`\nwhere `ω_n = 2πnT` are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies, the inner product becomes:\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = T ∑_n ∫ (d³k/(2π)³) (ω_n² + **k**² + m²) |ϕ̃(ω_n, **k**)|²`\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field `ϕ`, the partition function `Z` is given by the functional integral `Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])`, where `S_E[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action. The action for a free scalar field can be written in the form `S_E[ϕ] = 1/2 (ϕ, D_ϕ)`.\n\nThe inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is given by the integral over the Euclidean spacetime (with imaginary time `τ` having a period `β = 1/T`):\n\n`(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, **x**) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(τ, **x**)`\n\nHere, `m` is the mass of the scalar field, `∇²` is the spatial Laplacian operator, and `∂_τ²` is the second derivative with respect to the Euclidean time `τ`. The operator `D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator."
