Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit a more potent and sustained release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15. This is due to IL-15's role in promoting a less differentiated, memory-like T cell phenotype that is more resistant to exhaustion and capable of long-term effector function. While this enhanced cytokine production is linked to greater anti-tumor efficacy, it may also increase the potential for cytokine release syndrome.
