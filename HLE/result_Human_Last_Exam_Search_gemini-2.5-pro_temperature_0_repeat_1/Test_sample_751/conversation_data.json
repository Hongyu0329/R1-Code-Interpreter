    "To reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality, we follow these steps:\n\n**1. System and Dual System Definition**\n\nThe original system (primal system) is given by:\nx(k+1) = Ax(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwhere:\nA = [,,]\nC = [,]\n\nThe principle of duality states that a system (A, C) is observable if and only if its dual system (A', C') is controllable. The transformation to observer canonical form for the primal system is related to the transformation of the dual system to controllable canonical form.\n\nThe dual system is defined by:\nz(k+1) = A'z(k) + C'v(k)\n\nwhere A' is the transpose of A, and C' is the transpose of C.\nA' = [,,]\nC' = [,,]\n\n**2. Reduction to a Single-Output System**\n\nThe standard procedure for transformation to canonical form is defined for single-input, single-output (SISO) systems. The given system has two outputs, making its dual a two-input system. We proceed by selecting one of the outputs to create a SISO system. Let's choose the first output, y1(k).\n\nThe new output matrix is C₁ =.\nThe corresponding dual system becomes a single-input system with the input matrix B_d = C₁' = [,,].\n\n**3. Transformation of the Dual System to Controllable Canonical Form**\n\nWe need to find a transformation matrix, let's call it P, that transforms the dual system (A', B_d) into controllable canonical form (A_c, B_c). The state transformation is z_c = P * z.\n\nThe target controllable canonical form is:\nA_c = [,, [-a₃, -a₂, -a₁]]\nB_c = [,,]\n\nFirst, we find the characteristic polynomial of A (which is the same as for A'):\ndet(sI - A) = s³ - 2s² - 3s + 2 = 0\nThe coefficients are a₁ = -2, a₂ = -3, a₃ = 2.\n\nSo, the target A_c is:\nA_c = [,, [-2, 3, 2]]\n\nThe transformation matrix P is constructed from the relations A_c*P = P*A' and B_c = P*B_d. This leads to a system of equations for the first row of P, denoted p₁, which is solved to be p₁ = [0.5, 0, -1]. The full transformation matrix P is then constructed as:\nP = [[p₁], [p₁A'], [p₁A'²]]\n\nCalculating the rows:\np₁ = [0.5, 0, -1]\np₁A' = [0.5, 0, 0]\np₁A'² = [0.5, 1, 0]\n\nSo, the transformation matrix for the dual system is:\nP = [[0.5, 0, -1], [0.5, 0, 0], [0.5, 1, 0]]\n\n**4. Transformation of the Original System to Observer Canonical Form**\n\nBy the principle of duality, the transformation matrix T for the original system is T = (P⁻¹)'. The new system matrices are given by:\nA_o = T * A * T⁻¹\nC_o = C * T⁻¹\n\nIt can be shown that T⁻¹ = P'. Therefore, the new output matrix is:\nC_o = C * P'\n\nFirst, we find the transpose of P:\nP' = [[0.5, 0.5, 0.5],, [-1, 0, 0]]\n\nNow, we compute the new output matrix C_o:\nC_o = C * P' = [,] * [[0.5, 0.5, 0.5],, [-1, 0, 0]]\nC_o = [[(0*0.5 + 1*0 + 0*-1), (0*0.5 + 1*0 + 0*0), (0*0.5 + 1*1 + 0*0)],\n       [(1*0.5 + 1*0 + 0*-1), (1*0.5 + 1*0 + 0*0), (1*0.5 + 1*1 + 0*0)]]\nC_o = [, [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]\n\nThe new matrix C is [, [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]].\n\n<<<[, [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]>>>"
