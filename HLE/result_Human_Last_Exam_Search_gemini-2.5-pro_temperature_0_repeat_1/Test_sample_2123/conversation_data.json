    "The surname of the English poet that appears in the Russian translation of an essay by G.K. Chesterton is Pope.\n\nThis is a well-known piece of literary trivia related to the work of the acclaimed Russian translator Natalya Trauberg. Trauberg was renowned for her translations of English authors, particularly G.K. Chesterton and C.S. Lewis.\n\nIn her Russian rendering of one of Chesterton's essays, while describing the wide boulevards of Vienna, she introduced a creative pun. The exact original English phrase and the specific essay are not easily pinpointed, but the story of the translation is widely cited in Russian literary circles. Trauberg compared the boulevards' width to the corpulence of a priest, using the Russian word \"поп\" (pop), which means \"priest.\" This was a deliberate play on the surname of the 18th-century English poet Alexander Pope.\n\n<<<Pope>>>"
