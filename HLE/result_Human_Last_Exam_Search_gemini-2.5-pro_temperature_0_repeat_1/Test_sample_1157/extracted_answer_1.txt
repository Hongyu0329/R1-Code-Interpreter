This is a complex clinical case requiring a multi-faceted and phased approach to management. The patient's systemic health, the nature of the dental trauma, and her specific skeletal structure all play crucial roles in determining the appropriate treatment.

### **Appropriate Management and Procedures**

**Phase 1: Immediate and Emergency Care (First 28+ Hours)**

Given the 28-hour delay since the accident, replantation of the avulsed (knocked out) left lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar is not a viable option. The periodontal ligament cells on the root surfaces would be non-viable, making successful reattachment impossible and leading to complications like root resorption and ankylosis (fusion of the tooth to the bone).

The immediate management should therefore focus on:
*   **Medical Consultation and Glycemic Control:** The most critical initial step is a medical consultation to manage her uncontrolled diabetes. An HbA1c of 7.5% indicates poor glycemic control over the past 2-3 months, which significantly impairs wound healing and increases the risk of infection. Elective dental procedures should be postponed until her HbA1c is below 7%.
*   **Wound Care:** The empty tooth sockets must be gently irrigated with sterile saline or an antimicrobial rinse like chlorhexidine to remove debris and reduce the bacterial load.
*   **Antibiotic and Tetanus Prophylaxis:** Due to the contaminated nature of the injury and her compromised immune status from diabetes, systemic antibiotics are indicated to prevent infection. Her tetanus immunization status should also be checked and updated if necessary.
*   **Pain Management:** Appropriate analgesics should be prescribed to manage pain from the trauma.
*   **Radiographic Evaluation:** A thorough radiographic examination is necessary to rule out any fractures in the alveolar bone (the bone that holds the teeth).

**Phase 2: Diagnostic and Treatment Planning**

Once the immediate medical and dental issues are stabilized, a comprehensive plan for replacing the missing teeth can be developed.

*   **Significance of the SNB Angle (88⁰):** The SNB (Sella-Nasion-B point) angle is a cephalometric measurement that relates the position of the mandible (lower jaw) to the cranial base. An average SNB angle is around 80-82 degrees. An angle of 88⁰ indicates a significantly prognathic mandible, meaning the lower jaw is positioned far forward. This creates a skeletal Class III relationship, which will heavily influence the bite (occlusion) and aesthetics of the final prosthesis.

### **Cells of Interest in Healing**

The healing of the tooth sockets involves a complex, coordinated sequence of cellular activity, which is negatively impacted by high blood sugar. The key cells are:
*   **Inflammatory Cells:** Initially, **neutrophils** and **macrophages** migrate to the site to clean the wound of bacteria and damaged tissue. Macrophages also release growth factors that initiate the next phase.
*   **Proliferative Cells:**
    *   **Fibroblasts** are responsible for producing collagen and forming granulation tissue, which replaces the initial blood clot.
    *   **Endothelial cells** form new blood vessels (angiogenesis) to supply the healing tissue with oxygen and nutrients.
    *   **Osteoblasts** are the bone-forming cells that migrate into the socket to begin generating new bone.
*   **Remodeling Cells:** **Osteoclasts** (bone-resorbing cells) and **osteoblasts** work together to remodel the newly formed bone into a mature, stable alveolar ridge.

### **Denture Replacement: A Phased Approach**

Given the patient's uncontrolled diabetes, a definitive treatment like dental implants is contraindicated until her glycemic control is stable (HbA1c < 7%). Therefore, the most appropriate initial solution is a removable partial denture.

*   **Type of Denture:** A **Removable Partial Denture (RPD)** is the recommended choice. It is a non-invasive option that restores function and aesthetics while allowing for easy cl
