    "Of course. I will find the historical information and then present it using a Python script.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Research the history of the Piazza della Rotonda to identify a significant architectural or infrastructure feature that was removed around the year 1950.\n2.  Create a Python script that stores this information in a variable.\n3.  The script will then print a descriptive sentence that answers your question.\n\n```python\ndef solve_piazza_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the feature removed from\n    Piazza della Rotonda in the mid-20th century.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The architectural feature in question.\n    removed_feature = \"a tramway\"\n\n    # The approximate year of removal.\n    year = 1950\n\n    # The Piazza where the feature was located.\n    location = \"Piazza della Rotonda\"\n\n    # Print the detailed answer.\n    print(\n        f\"The unique feature in the '{location}' that was removed around the year {year} was {removed_feature}.\"\n    )\n    print(\"The tram lines and their overhead electrical wires were considered an eyesore and incompatible with the historical grandeur of the Pantheon, leading to their removal by the city.\")\n\nsolve_piazza_mystery()\n```\n<<<A tramway>>>"
