# The user wants to find the correct answer to a multiple-choice question
# regarding a lawyer's professional obligations.

# The scenario involves a lawyer, James, and his client, Eric.
# Eric has threatened to kill his ex-wife and himself tonight.
# James disclosed this confidential information to the police to prevent the harm.
# The question is whether James's disclosure was ethically permissible.

# The relevant ethical rule is the public safety exception to lawyer-client confidentiality.
# This exception allows a lawyer to disclose confidential information if they reasonably
# believe there is an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.

# Let's analyze the facts against the rule:
# 1. Is there a reasonable belief of risk? Yes, Eric's statement was direct and specific.
# 2. Is the risk of death or serious bodily harm? Yes, he mentioned a gun and "ending things."
# 3. Is the risk imminent? Yes, he said "tonight."
# 4. Was disclosure necessary to prevent the harm? Yes, informing the police was the proper course of action.

# Now let's evaluate the options:
# A. No, the threat was not imminent. This is factually incorrect.
# B. No, disclosure is prohibited regardless of circumstances. This is legally incorrect, as there are exceptions.
# C. No, James did not disclose the appropriate information. This is debatable but weak. While the vacation homes may have been extra, the core disclosure was appropriate and necessary to save lives. This answer choice would find the entire life-saving action improper due to a minor detail.
# D. Yes, because a lawyer must disclose if police request it. This is incorrect. The rule is that a lawyer *may* disclose; it is not mandatory.
# E. Yes, because James reasonably believed there was an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm, and disclosure was necessary to prevent the possible harm. This accurately describes the public safety exception and how it applies to this situation.

# Conclusion: Option E is the best fit.

# The final answer is E.
