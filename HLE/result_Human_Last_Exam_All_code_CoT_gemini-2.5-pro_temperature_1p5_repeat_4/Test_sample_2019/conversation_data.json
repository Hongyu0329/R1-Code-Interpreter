    "To solve this problem, I will use a Python script to count all possible valid placements of 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Model the Toroidal Board:** The 5x5 board has 25 squares. A queen's attack wraps around the edges. This means that for two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` on a 5x5 board, we must check for attacks not just by direct equality but also using modulo 5 arithmetic for the diagonals:\n    *   **Row attack:** `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Column attack:** `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Main diagonal attack:** `(r1 - c1) % 5 == (r2 - c2) % 5`\n    *   **Anti-diagonal attack:** `(r1 + c1) % 5 == (r2 + c2) % 5`\n\n2.  **Systematic Search:** The most straightforward way to find all solutions is to check every possible way to place 4 queens on the 25 squares. The total number of combinations is C(25, 4) = 12,650, which is small enough for a computer to check quickly.\n\n3.  **Python Implementation:**\n    *   I will use Python's `itertools.combinations` to generate all unique sets of 4 squares from the 25 available.\n    *   Each combination of 4 squares will be checked for validity.\n    *   A helper function `is_valid` will take the positions of the 4 queens and return `True` only if no two queens attack each other according to the toroidal rules.\n    *   A counter will be used to track the number of valid placements found.\n    *   Finally, the script will print the total count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_dim = 5\n    num_queens = 4\n    board_size = board_dim * board_dim\n    \n    # Generate all possible squares on the board, represented by numbers 0-24.\n    all_squares = range(board_size)\n    \n    # Generate all combinations of placing `num_queens` on the board.\n    queen_placements_indices = itertools.combinations(all_squares, num_queens)\n    \n    valid_placements_count = 0\n    \n    for placement_indices in queen_placements_indices:\n        # Convert indices (0-24) to (row, col) coordinates.\n        queens = [(i // board_dim, i % board_dim) for i in placement_indices]\n        \n        is_valid = True\n        # Check every pair of queens in the current placement for attacks.\n        for q1, q2 in itertools.combinations(queens, 2):\n            r1, c1 = q1\n            r2, c2 = q2\n            \n            # Check for row, column, and the two types of toroidal diagonal attacks.\n            if (r1 == r2 or\n                c1 == c2 or\n                (r1 - c1) % board_dim == (r2 - c2) % board_dim or\n                (r1 + c1) % board_dim == (r2 + c2) % board_dim):\n                \n                is_valid = False\n                break  # An attack was found, so this placement is invalid.\n        \n        if is_valid:\n            valid_placements_count += 1\n            \n    print(f\"Board size: {board_dim}x{board_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Number of queens: {num_queens}\")\n    print(f\"Total number of ways to place {num_queens} non-attacking queens on a {board_dim}x{board_dim} toroidal board is: {valid_placements_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the solution.\nsolve_toroidal_queens()\n<<<50>>>\n```"
