    print("\n1. Understanding the Experiment: This is a photo-affinity labeling experiment. A probe is activated by light to form a covalent bond with proteins. The final fluorescence comes from a cy5-azide reporter that is 'clicked' onto the probe after it has attached to a protein.")

    print("\n2. Identifying the Critical Difference: The only difference between the high-signal experiment (Probe 1) and the low-signal experiment (Probe 2) is a single functional group on the probe molecule.")
    print("   - Probe 1 has a '4-hydroxyphenyl' group (a phenol).")
    print("   - Probe 2 has a '4-(hydroxymethyl)phenyl' group (a benzyl alcohol).")

    print("\n3. Relating Structure to Photoreactivity: Phenol groups are known to be easily oxidized upon photo-irradiation in the presence of a photosensitizer. This oxidation produces a highly reactive intermediate.")

    print("\n4. Identifying the Reactive Intermediate: The one-electron oxidation of a phenol produces a 'phenoxyl radical'. This is a well-established reactive species in photochemistry.")

    print("\n5. Explaining the High Signal: The phenoxyl radical formed from Probe 1 is highly reactive and readily attacks nearby proteins, forming a covalent bond. This efficient labeling leads to a strong fluorescent signal after adding the cy5-azide reporter.")

    print("\n6. Explaining the Low Signal: Probe 2 contains a benzyl alcohol, which is much more resistant to oxidation and cannot form a phenoxyl radical under these conditions. Because this highly efficient labeling pathway is absent, the signal is much lower.")
    
    print("\n7. Conclusion: The dramatic difference in fluorescent signal between the two conditions is caused by the ability of Probe 1 to form a phenoxyl radical, while Probe 2 cannot. Therefore, the phenoxyl radical is the key species responsible for the difference.")
