    "As an AI, I am unable to watch a video of a ballet performance to count the number of specific dance moves. This task requires visual analysis of the 2015 performance of \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\" by the Semperoper Ballett, which is beyond my current capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a standard, formally defined ballet step. It's a descriptive term for the style, speed, and musicality characteristic of George Balanchine's choreography. Therefore, any count would be highly subjective and depend on the viewer's interpretation.\n\nThe following Python script explains this limitation and shows how the result would be presented if the data were available.\n\n```python\ndef count_dance_moves():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the user's request to count the number of\n    'pas de Balanchines' in a specific ballet performance.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the dancer, performance, and move in question.\n    dancer = \"Svetlana Gileva\"\n    performance = \"Jete Woman solo in Forsythe's 'In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated' (Semperoper Ballett, 2015)\"\n    move = \"pas de Balanchine\"\n\n    # Explain why this cannot be calculated by an AI.\n    print(f\"Analyzing the request to count the number of '{move}' moves performed by {dancer} in the performance: '{performance}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"This task requires visual analysis of a specific video, which is beyond the capabilities of an AI.\")\n    print(\"Additionally, a 'pas de Balanchine' is a stylistic term, not a discrete, countable step, making any count subjective.\")\n    \n    # Represent the unknown count.\n    # The value is set to a descriptive string because a numerical count is impossible to determine.\n    number_of_pas_de_balanchines = \"Cannot be determined\"\n\n    # As requested, printing the final \"equation\" with the result.\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"The number of {move}s performed = {number_of_pas_de_balanchines}\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the explanation.\ncount_dance_moves()\n```\n<<<Cannot be determined>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
