# This script calculates the properties of Cell 9 based on the observed patterns.

# --- Step 1: Determine the shape ---
# The shapes appear in groups of three: Circle, Square, Triangle.
cell_number = 9
shapes = ['Circle', 'Square', 'Triangle']
# We use integer division to find the index for the shape. (9-1) // 3 = 2
shape_index = (cell_number - 1) // 3
final_shape = shapes[shape_index]

print("Step 1: Calculating the Shape")
print(f"The shape for cell {cell_number} is '{final_shape}'.\n")


# --- Step 2: Determine the arrow angle ---
# The angle of the third cell in a group is derived from the second.
# The operation alternates: division by 2, multiplication by 2.
# For the Triangle group (the 3rd group), the operation is division by 2.
angle_cell_8_rad = math.pi  # Given for Cell 8
angle_cell_9_rad = angle_cell_8_rad / 2

print("Step 2: Calculating the Arrow Angle")
print(f"The angle for cell 8 is π radians.")
print(f"The operation for the Triangle group is division by 2.")
print(f"The angle for cell 9 is π / 2 = {angle_cell_9_rad:.4f} radians.\n")


# --- Step 3: Determine the number of dots ---
# The number of dots follows the formula: Dots = 3 * Angle(rad) / π
dots_cell_9 = (3 * angle_cell_9_rad) / math.pi

print("Step 3: Calculating the Number of Dots")
print("The formula is: Dots = 3 * Angle_in_radians / π")
print(f"Dots = 3 * (π/2) / π = {dots_cell_9}.\n")


# --- Step 4: Determine the final formatting ---
# The position is given in degrees if the angle (in radians) is not divisible by π/3.
angle_divisor = math.pi / 3
is_divisible = math.isclose((angle_cell_9_rad % angle_divisor), 0)
angle_in_degrees = math.degrees(angle_cell_9_rad)

print("Step 4: Determining Final Formatting")
print(f"Checking if {angle_cell_9_rad:.4f} rad is divisible by π/3: {is_divisible}")
print("Since it is not divisible, the angle must be represented in degrees.")
print(f"Angle in degrees = {angle_in_degrees}°.")
