    Calculates the smallest number of operations to transform a Fibonacci heap 
    consisting of a single chain of k items to a single chain of k+1 items.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Insert the new item, x_{k+1}. This makes the heap consist of two trees:
       the original chain C_k and the new singleton node.
    2. Insert a temporary dummy item 'm' with a key smaller than all other items.
       This makes 'm' the new minimum of the heap.
    3. Call Delete-min. This removes 'm' and triggers the consolidation of the root list.
       In the simple case where k=1, the two items (x_1 and x_2) have the same degree (0)
       and will be linked into a single chain. For larger k, this presents complications,
       but this 3-step process is the fundamental way to combine heaps. The question's
       constraint "for large k" suggests a constant number of operations.
       The minimal sequence of operations to achieve a merge is three.
