    # Historical Context:
    # 1. A devastating earthquake hit Kingston, Jamaica (a British colony).
    # 2. A US Navy squadron offered and provided immediate aid (firefighting, policing).
    # 3. The British Governor, Sir Alexander Swettenham, offensively rebuffed the American aid,
    #    causing a diplomatic incident between the US and UK.
    # 4. The local population and newspapers (like The Gleaner) were immensely grateful for
    #    the American help and highly critical of Governor Swettenham's actions, which
    #    they viewed as prioritizing colonial pride over the welfare of suffering Jamaicans.

    # Evaluate the options by assigning a plausibility score (0=low, 1=medium, 2=high)
    # This helps quantify the qualitative historical analysis.

    # Score for A: Plausible, but not the primary reaction. While educated Jamaicans were
    # certainly wary of America's Jim Crow racial policies, the immediate and dominant
    # reaction to the *incident* was gratitude for aid, not fear of intervention.
    score_A = 1

    # Score for B: Unlikely. The incident was an Anglo-American affair. Canadian annexation was not
    # a widespread demand or a relevant topic in the context of the earthquake response.
    score_B = 0

    # Score for C: Most likely. The locals' anger was directed at the *governor*, not the
    # British colonial system itself. They saw his actions as an embarrassment to the Empire.
    # As British subjects, they preferred a competent and compassionate colonial administration
    # over the prospect of foreign control, even if they were grateful for the temporary help.
    score_C = 2

    # Score for D: Unlikely. Same reason as B; Canadian annexation was not the focus. Locals
    # were far from "agnostic" - they had very strong opinions on the matter.
    score_D = 0

    # Score for E: Unlikely. Gratitude for aid is not the same as preferring annexation.
    # There's little evidence to suggest this incident sparked a desire to trade British rule for American.
    score_E = 0
