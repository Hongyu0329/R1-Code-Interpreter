# The problem asks for the number of equivalence classes on a space X,
# which is the disjoint union of 5 different topological spaces.
# The equivalence relation is x ~ y if there is an auto-homeomorphism of X sending x to y.

# Step 1: Analyze the structure of the space and the homeomorphisms.
# The space X is X = T U S U R U D3 U D5, where the union is disjoint.
# T = Torus, S = Sphere, R = Real line, D3 = 3-point discrete, D5 = 5-point discrete.
# These five component spaces are all topologically distinct. For example:
# - D3 and D5 are finite; the others are infinite.
# - T and S are compact; R is not.
# - T and S have different fundamental groups.
# Because they are distinct, any homeomorphism f: X -> X must map each component to itself.
# This means that if x and y are in different components, they cannot be equivalent.

# Step 2: Decompose the problem.
# The total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the number of equivalence classes
# in each individual component space.

# Step 3: Count equivalence classes in each component.
# A space is homogeneous if for any two points, there's a homeomorphism mapping one to the other.
# A homogeneous space has exactly one equivalence class.

# The torus is homogeneous (any point can be translated to any other point).
num_classes_torus = 1

# The sphere is homogeneous (any point can be rotated to any other point).
num_classes_sphere = 1

# The real line is homogeneous (any point can be translated to any other point).
num_classes_real_line = 1

# A three-point discrete space is homogeneous (any point can be permuted to any other point).
num_classes_d3 = 1

# A five-point discrete space is homogeneous (any point can be permuted to any other point).
num_classes_d5 = 1

# Step 4: Sum the results.
total_classes = num_classes_torus + num_classes_sphere + num_classes_real_line + num_classes_d3 + num_classes_d5

# Print the final breakdown and answer.
print("Each of the five component spaces is homogeneous, meaning all points within a single component belong to the same equivalence class.")
print("Therefore, each component contributes exactly one equivalence class.")
print("\nThe total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the number of classes from each component:")
print(f"{num_classes_torus} (from torus) + {num_classes_sphere} (from sphere) + {num_classes_real_line} (from real line) + {num_classes_d3} (from 3-point space) + {num_classes_d5} (from 5-point space) = {total_classes}")
