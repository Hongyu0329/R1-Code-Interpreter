    # The problem asks to identify the necessary assumption(s) from a given list
    # to prove that a Bayesian agent's expected information gain approaches zero.

    # Let's represent the options with letters 'a' through 'e'.
    # a. The prior has finite entropy.
    # b. The agent interacts with a specific type of MDP (finite/compact state space).
    # c. The limit of the state occupancy distribution exists.
    # d. Observations are sampled i.i.d.
    # e. The entropy of the posterior approaches zero.

    # Reasoning:
    # 1. The total expected information gain is bounded by the entropy of the prior distribution.
    #    This is a standard result: sum(E[info_gain_t]) <= H(prior).
    # 2. If the prior entropy is finite (Assumption a), the sum of non-negative information gain terms is finite.
    # 3. A convergent series must have terms that go to zero. Thus, E[info_gain_t] -> 0.
    # 4. This makes (a) a key assumption for a standard proof.
    # 5. Option (b) is a sufficient condition for stronger results (posterior consistency), but not necessary for information gain to vanish.
    # 6. Option (c) is a strong condition on the agent's policy, not generally necessary for belief convergence.
    # 7. Option (d) contradicts the interactive setting of the problem.
    # 8. Option (e) is a consequence of learning, not a prerequisite assumption.
    # Therefore, (a) is the necessary assumption from the list.

    # The final answer is 'a'.
    # We need to format this in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).
    # CNF is a conjunction (AND) of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals.
    # For a single proposition 'a', the CNF is simply (a).
    # Following the specified format "[(a OR e) AND (b OR e)]", the answer should be `[(a)]`.

    # Clauses are alphabetically ordered (trivially true).
    # Literals within a clause are alphabetically ordered (trivially true).
    # The clause is surrounded by parentheses.
    # The whole conjunction is surrounded by brackets.
    
    final_answer_cnf = "[(a)]"
