# Number of piqué soutenu followed by écarté back sequences

# In Peter Wright's choreography for the Royal Ballet, Marianela Núñez performs the sequence 4 times.
nunez_sequences = 4

# In Vasily Vainonen's choreography for the Mariinsky Theatre, the sequence is not performed.
khoreva_sequences = 0

# Calculate the difference
difference = nunez_sequences - khoreva_sequences

# Print the final result in a descriptive equation
print(f"The difference between the number of sequences is {nunez_sequences} - {khoreva_sequences} = {difference}")
