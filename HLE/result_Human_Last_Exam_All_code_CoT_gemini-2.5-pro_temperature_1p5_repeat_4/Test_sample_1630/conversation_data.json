    "My plan to solve this problem is to first establish an upper bound for the number of fixed points and then argue why this upper bound can be achieved.\n\n1.  **Define the problem mathematically.** A fixed point of $f(g(x))$ is a solution to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$. Let $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the maximum number of real roots of the equation $h(x) - x = 0$.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the polynomial.** $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 3. The degree of the composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is the product of their degrees, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$. Therefore, $P(x) = h(x) - x$ is a polynomial of degree 9. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. This gives us an upper bound of 9.\n\n3.  **Check if the upper bound is achievable.** For a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree 9 to have 9 distinct real roots, its derivative, $P'(x)$, must have 8 distinct real roots, according to Rolle's Theorem.\n\n4.  **Analyze the derivative.** Let's look at $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$. We need to determine if it's possible for $h'(x) - 1 = 0$ to have 8 real roots. This depends on the nature of $h'(x)$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the degree of $h'(x)$**. We have $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ by the chain rule.\n    *   Since $f(x)$ has degree 3, its derivative $f'(x)$ has degree 2.\n    *   Since $g(x)$ has degree 3, its derivative $g'(x)$ has degree 2.\n    *   The degree of the composite term $f'(g(x))$ is $\\text{degree}(f') \\times \\text{degree}(g) = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   The degree of the product $h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is the sum of the degrees of the factors: $6 + 2 = 8$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.** $P'(x) = h'(x) - 1$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have up to 8 real roots. Thus, it is theoretically possible for $P'(x)$ to have 8 real roots. This in turn allows $P(x)$ to have up to 9 real roots. The constraints that $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$ are always positive ensure that $f, g$, and the composition $h=f \\circ g$ are strictly increasing, but this does not prevent the function $h(x)$ from intersecting the line $y=x$ multiple times. By choosing appropriate coefficients for the polynomials $f$ and $g$, it is possible to construct a scenario where $h(x)-x=0$ has 9 distinct real solutions.\n\nThe following Python code outlines this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_fixed_points_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the maximum number of fixed points\n    for the composition of two cubic polynomials with positive derivatives.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the properties of the polynomials f(x) and g(x).\n    deg_f = 3\n    deg_g = 3\n    print(f\"Let f(x) and g(x) be polynomials of degree {deg_f} and {deg_g} respectively.\")\n    print(\"The conditions f'(x) > 0 and g'(x) > 0 mean f(x) and g(x) are strictly increasing.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the composite function and the fixed-point equation.\n    # The degree of a composition of polynomials is the product of their degrees.\n    deg_h = deg_f * deg_g\n    print(f\"Let h(x) = f(g(x)).
