    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$, we will follow a standard construction from the theory of the Markov and Lagrange spectra, particularly related to the work of mathematicians like L. Bowditch and C. Series on geodesics on punctured tori.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Find the Continued Fraction of the Rational Number:** First, we determine the continued fraction of the given rational number, $4/7$. The standard representation for a rational $p/q \\in (0,1)$ is $[0; c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n]$.\n2.  **Extract the Coefficients:** We take the sequence of coefficients $(c_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_n)$ from the continued fraction.\n3.  **Construct a Palindromic Period:** The periodic part of the associated continued fraction is formed by creating a palindrome. We take the sequence of coefficients from step 2, let's call it $C$, and concatenate it with its reverse, $C^R$. The resulting period is $P = (c_1, \\ldots, c_n, c_n, \\ldots, c_1)$.\n4.  **Define the Associated Continued Fraction:** The continued fraction associated with $m_{4/7}$ is the one with the purely periodic part $P$. We will denote this number by $x$. It is given by $x = [\\overline{c_1, \\ldots, c_n, c_n, \\ldots, c_1}]$.\n5.  **Determine the Quadratic Equation:** Since $x$ is a quadratic irrational with a purely periodic continued fraction, it is a root of a quadratic equation of the form $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$. We will compute the integer coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n6.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will perform these calculations and print the resulting continued fraction and its quadratic equation, explicitly showing each coefficient.\n\nThis procedure yields one of the two quadratic irrationals whose sum constitutes the generalized Markov number. We choose the one that is greater than 1, which corresponds to this specific construction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_cf_coeffs(p, q):\n    \"\"\"Computes the continued fraction coefficients for the rational number p/q.\"\"\"\n    coeffs = []\n    if q == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Denominator cannot be zero.\")\n    while q != 0:\n        a = p // q\n        coeffs.append(a)\n        p, q = q, p % q\n    return coeffs\n\ndef gcd_three(a, b, c):\n    \"\"\"Computes the greatest common divisor of three integers.\"\"\"\n    return math.gcd(math.gcd(a, b), c)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction associated with a generalized Markov number m_{p/q}\n    and the quadratic equation it satisfies.\n    \"\"\"\n    p, q = 4, 7\n    print(f\"The rational number is {p}/{q}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Get continued fraction coefficients of the rational number\n    cf_coeffs = get_cf_coeffs(p, q)\n    cf_str = f\"[{cf_coeffs[0]}; \" + \", \".join(map(str, cf_coeffs[1:])) + \"]\"\n    print(f\"Its continued fraction is {cf_str}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Extract the coefficients for construction\n    # We use the part of the CF after the integer part.\n    c = cf_coeffs[1:]\n    print(f\"The sequence of coefficients used is c = {c}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the palindromic period\n    period = c + c[::-1]\n    period_str = \", \".join(map(str, period))\n    print(f\"The palindromic period is constructed as c + reversed(c) = {period}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Define the associated continued fraction\n    print(f\"The associated continued fraction is x = [{period_str}, ...].\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 5: Determine the quadratic equation for x = [period]\n    # x = (p_k * x + p_{k-1}) / (q_k * x + q_{k-1})\n    # This leads to q_k * x^2 + (q_{k-1} - p_k) * x - p_{k-1} = 0\n\n    # Calculate convergents p_k, q_k, p_{k-1}, q_{k-1}\n    # Initialize for convergents calculation p_n/q_n\n    p_prev, p_curr = 0, 1\n    q_prev, q_curr = 1, 0\n\n    for a in period:\n        p_next = a * p_curr + p_prev\n        q_next = a * q_curr + q_prev\n        p_prev, p_curr = p_curr, p_next\n        q_prev, q_curr = q_curr, q_next\n    \n    p_k, p_km1 = p_curr, p_prev\n    q_k, q_km1 = q_curr, q_prev\n\n    A = q_k\n    B = q_km1 - p_k\n    C = -p_km1\n\n    # Simplify the equation by dividing by GCD\n    common_divisor = gcd_three(abs(A), abs(B), abs(C))\n    A //= common_divisor\n    B //= common_divisor\n    C //= common_divisor\n    \n    print(\"This continued fraction is a root of the quadratic equation:\")\n    # The required output format, printing each number in the equation\n    print(f\"{A}x^2 + ({B})x + ({C}) = 0\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n<<<5x^2 + (-6)x + (-5) = 0>>>"
