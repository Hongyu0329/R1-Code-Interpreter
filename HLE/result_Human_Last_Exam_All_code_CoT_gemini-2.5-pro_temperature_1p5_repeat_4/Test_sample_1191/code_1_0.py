    print("1. The cost of a HIGH mutation rate:")
    print("   - A high rate introduces many harmful (deleterious) mutations.")
    print("   - This decreases the average fitness of a population, a concept called 'mutational load'.")

    print("   - A low rate reduces the supply of beneficial mutations.")
