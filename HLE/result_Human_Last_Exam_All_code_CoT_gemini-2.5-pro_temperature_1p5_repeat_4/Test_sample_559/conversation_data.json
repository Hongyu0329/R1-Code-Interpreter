    "My plan to find the separatrix of the system is as follows:\n\n1.  **Find Equilibrium Points**: First, I will find the equilibrium points of the system by setting both `d'(t)` and `u'(t)` to zero. These are the points where the system is stationary.\n2.  **Classify Equilibrium Points**: Next, I will classify these points by linearizing the system. This involves calculating the Jacobian matrix and evaluating its eigenvalues at each equilibrium point. The classification (e.g., saddle, node, spiral) is crucial because separatrices are typically associated with saddle points.\n3.  **Identify the Saddle Point**: I expect to find at least one saddle point. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices, as they divide the phase plane into regions with distinct long-term trajectory behaviors.\n4.  **Find the Separatrix Equation**: I will hypothesize that the separatrix is a simple algebraic curve. By substituting a general polynomial form `d = f(u)` into the system's differential equations, I can solve for the coefficients of the polynomial. I will focus on finding an invariant curve that passes through the saddle point.\n5.  **Confirm the Result**: Finally, I will verify that the found curve is indeed the unstable (or stable) manifold of the saddle point, confirming its status as a separatrix. The Python code will then print the final equation of this separatrix.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the given system of differential equations to find the separatrix.\n    The analysis is explained in the thought process and comments.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define variables\n    u, d = sp.symbols('u d')\n    \n    # System of ODEs\n    # u_prime = u**2 * (u - 1)\n    # d_prime = 2*d**2 + (-3*u + 5*u**2)*d - u**3*(1-u)\n    \n    # Step 1 & 2: Find and classify equilibrium points.\n    # From u_prime = 0, we get u=0 or u=1.\n    # If u=0, d_prime = 2*d**2 = 0 -> d=0.
