    "To find the value of a(3), where a(n) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for electron or photon propagators in Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), we can use a known recurrence relation.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  The sequence `a(n)` is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A000698.\n2.  The sequence starts with `a(1) = 1` and `a(2) = 1`.\n3.  For `n >= 3`, the sequence follows the recurrence relation:\n    `n * a(n) = (4*n - 6) * a(n-1) - 4*(n - 3) * a(n-2)`\n4.  I will write a Python script to calculate `a(3)` using this relation and the initial values `a(1)` and `a(2)`.\n5.  The script will substitute `n=3` into the formula, plug in the known values for `a(1)` and `a(2)`, and solve for `a(3)`, printing each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_diagrams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(3) for the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams in QED.\n    \n    The number of diagrams a(n) of order 2n follows the recurrence relation:\n    n * a(n) = (4*n - 6) * a(n-1) - 4*(n - 3) * a(n-2)\n    with initial values a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    a1 = 1  # Value of a(n-2) when n=3\n    a2 = 1  # Value of a(n-1) when n=3\n\n    print(f\"To find a({n}), we use the recurrence relation with n={n}:\")\n    print(\"n * a(n) = (4*n - 6) * a(n-1) - 4*(n - 3) * a(n-2)\")\n    print(\"\\nWith a(1)=1 and a(2)=1, we can substitute n=3:\")\n    \n    # Building the equation string step-by-step\n    c1 = 4 * n - 6\n    c2 = 4 * (n - 3)\n    \n    print(f\"{n} * a({n}) = (4*{n} - 6) * a(2) - 4*({n} - 3) * a(1)\")\n    print(f\"{n} * a({n}) = ({c1}) * {a2} - ({c2}) * {a1}\")\n    \n    term1_val = c1 * a2\n    term2_val = c2 * a1\n    numerator = term1_val - term2_val\n    \n    print(f\"{n} * a({n}) = {term1_val} - {term2_val}\")\n    print(f\"{n} * a({n}) = {numerator}\")\n    \n    result = numerator / n\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {numerator} / {n}\")\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {int(result)}\")\n\nsolve_feynman_diagrams()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
