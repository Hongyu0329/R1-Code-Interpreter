    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation and display the results.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Framework**: The problem asks for the equilibrium properties of light quanta (photons). In statistical mechanics, photons are treated as a gas of bosons where the total number of particles is not conserved, meaning their chemical potential is zero. Equilibrium is the macroscopic state that maximizes the system's entropy for a given total energy. This principle is a direct consequence of the ideas underlying the large deviation theorems mentioned in the prompt.\n2.  **Energy Distribution**: We start by maximizing the entropy for a Bose gas with zero chemical potential. This procedure yields the Planck distribution, which describes the average number of photons at a given energy level `ε` and temperature `T`.\n3.  **Mean Energy (U)**: To find the total mean energy `U`, we integrate the energy of each state `ε` multiplied by the Planck distribution over all possible energies. This calculation results in the famous Stefan-Boltzmann law for the energy of black-body radiation, which states that `U` is proportional to `V * T^4`, where `V` is the volume and `T` is the temperature.\n4.  **Entropy (S)**: With the formula for `U`, we can find the entropy `S` using the fundamental thermodynamic relation for a system with zero chemical potential, which simplifies to `S = (U - Ω) / T`, where `Ω` is the Grand Potential. For a photon gas, it can be shown that `Ω = -U/3`. This leads to a simple relationship: `S = (4/3) * (U/T)`.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that first defines the necessary physical constants. It will then calculate the proportionality constants in the final equations for `U` and `S`. The script will print these derived formulas, showing how they are constructed from the fundamental constants, and then calculate the numerical values for `U` and `S` using an example temperature and volume.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_photon_gas_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the equilibrium equations for mean energy and\n    entropy of a photon gas based on statistical mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Introduction and Plan ---\n    print(\"This script finds the equilibrium values for Mean Energy (U) and Entropy (S) for light quanta (photons).\")\n    print(\"The derivation uses principles of statistical mechanics for a Bose gas where particle number is not conserved.\\n\")\n    print(\"Step 1: The Planck distribution for photons at a temperature T is determined by maximizing entropy.\")\n    print(\"Step 2: The Mean Energy (U) is found by integrating energy over this distribution.\")\n    print(\"Step 3: The Entropy (S) is found using the thermodynamic relation S = (4/3) * U / T.\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    # --- Constants ---\n    k_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    h = 6.62607015e-34   # Planck constant in J*s\n    c = 299792458       # Speed of light in m/s\n    pi = math.pi\n\n    # --- Calculate Coefficients for the Final Equations ---\n    \n    # The equation for mean energy is U = coeff_U * V * T^4\n    # The constant term is (8 * pi^5 * k_B^4) / (15 * h^3 * c^3)\n    coeff_U = (8 * pi**5 * k_B**4) / (15 * h**3 * c**3)\n    \n    # The equation for entropy is S = coeff_S * V * T^3\n    # The constant term is (32 * pi^5 * k_B^4) / (45 * h^3 * c^3)\n    coeff_S = (4 / 3) * coeff_U\n\n    # --- Display the Final Equations ---\n    \n    print(\"EQUILIBRIUM EQUATIONS FOR A PHOTON GAS\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"1.
