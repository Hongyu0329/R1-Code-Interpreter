    "To answer your question, I will identify the earliest fully recorded date from a pre-Columbian writing system and then create a Python script to display it.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Research the earliest recorded dates from pre-Columbian American civilizations, focusing on those with developed writing systems like the Maya, Olmec, Epi-Olmec, and Zapotec.\n2.  The key is to find a date that is part of a complete calendrical system that can be accurately correlated with our modern calendar. The Mesoamerican Long Count calendar is the prime example of such a system.\n3.  I will compare the earliest known Long Count dates, such as the one on Stela C from Tres Zapotes and the one on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo.\n4.  The artifact with the oldest Long Count date will be identified as the source of the earliest known recorded date.\n5.  I will then write a Python script that presents this date. The script will break down the Long Count number into its components (Baktun, Katun, etc.), display the full number sequence as found on the artifact, and provide its equivalent in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n```python\ndef display_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function displays the earliest known date recorded in a pre-Columbian\n    aboriginal writing system, which is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The date is recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count system.\n    # The date is 7.16.3.2.13.\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    uinal = 2\n    kin = 13\n    \n    print(\"The earliest known, fully recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo.\")\n    print(\"The date is recorded using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Long Count Date Breakdown ---\")\n    print(f\"{baktun:<10} (Baktun cycles of 144,000 days)\")\n    print(f\"{katun:<10} (Katun cycles of 7,200 days)\")\n    print(f\"{tun:<10} (Tun cycles of 360 days)\")\n    print(f\"{uinal:<10} (Uinal cycles of 20 days)\")\n    print(f\"{kin:<10} (Kin, or single days)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe full Long Count date as written is:\")\n    print(f\"{baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{uinal}.{kin}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThis date corresponds to the following in our modern Gregorian calendar:\")\n    print(\"December 7, 36 BCE\")\n\ndisplay_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<December 7, 36 BCE>>>"
