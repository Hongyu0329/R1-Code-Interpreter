    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene molecule (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 6-31G Basis Set for Carbon (C):**\n    *   Carbon is a second-row element.\n    *   The **core** orbital (1s) is described by **1** contracted function (from the '6' in 6-31G).\n    *   The **valence** orbitals (2s, 2p) are split. The '31' part means each valence orbital is described by two basis functions.\n    *   For the 2s orbital: **2** contracted functions.\n    *   For the three 2p orbitals (px, py, pz): 3 * 2 = **6** contracted functions.\n    *   Total per Carbon atom: 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = **9 contracted functions**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the 6-31G Basis Set for Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its 1s orbital is a valence orbital.\n    *   The '31' split applies to the 1s orbital.\n    *   Total per Hydrogen atom: **2 contracted functions**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total for Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   The molecule has 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Total = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\n    *   Total = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Define the number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon: 1 (1s core) + 2 (2s valence) + 6 (2p valence) = 9\nfuncs_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen: 2 (1s valence)\nfuncs_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions for each element\ntotal_funcs_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * funcs_per_carbon\ntotal_funcs_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * funcs_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total for the molecule\ntotal_contracted_functions = total_funcs_carbon + total_funcs_hydrogen\n\n# Print the final result showing the equation\nprint(f\"To calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"First, calculate the contribution from the {num_carbon_atoms} Carbon atoms:\")\nprint(f\"    {num_carbon_atoms} C atoms * {funcs_per_carbon} functions/atom = {total_funcs_carbon} functions\")\nprint(f\"Next, calculate the contribution from the {num_hydrogen_atoms} Hydrogen atoms:\")\nprint(f\"    {num_hydrogen_atoms} H atoms * {funcs_per_hydrogen} functions/atom = {total_funcs_hydrogen} functions\")\nprint(\"\\nFinally, sum the contributions to get the total:\")\nprint(f\"Total Functions = ({num_carbon_atoms} * {funcs_per_carbon}) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} * {funcs_per_hydrogen}) = {total_funcs_carbon} + {total_funcs_hydrogen} = {total_contracted_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
