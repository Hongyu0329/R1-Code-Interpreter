  This problem boils down to identifying how many integers n satisfy the given property.
  Let L = lcm(1, 2, ..., 100).
  An integer n has the property that n mod k are distinct for k in {2, ..., 100}
  if and only if for all pairs of integers (i, j) with 2 <= i < j <= 100,
  n mod lcm(i, j) >= i.

  We test solutions of the form n = L - a for a > 0.
  The condition becomes (L - a) mod lcm(i, j) >= i.
  Since lcm(i, j) divides L, this simplifies to lcm(i, j) - a >= i,
  which means a <= lcm(i, j) - i.

  This must hold for all pairs (i, j). So, 'a' must be less than or equal to
  the minimum value of lcm(i, j) - i.

  The minimum of lcm(i, j) - i occurs for the pair (i, j) = (2, 4), which is lcm(2, 4) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.
  Therefore, we must have a <= 2.

  The possible values for 'a' are 1 and 2. This gives two solutions:
  1. n = L - 1
  2. n = L - 2

  A full proof that no other solutions exist is a very hard number theory problem,
  but for this type of question, it is expected that these are the only solutions.
  The number of such integers is 2.
