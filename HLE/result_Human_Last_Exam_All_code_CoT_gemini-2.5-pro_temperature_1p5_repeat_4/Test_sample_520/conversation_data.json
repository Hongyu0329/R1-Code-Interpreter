    "This is a historical trivia question, not a computational problem. I will find the answer from my knowledge base. The plan is to write a simple Python script that stores this historical fact in a variable and then prints it to the console in a clear, complete sentence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the historical trivia question about Andre Vernault's profession.\n    Andre Vernault was an alias used by Lily Sergeyev, a French agent in the Double-Cross System.\n    British counterintelligence was suspicious of her because of inconsistencies in her story\n    and because she concealed her true profession.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This was the profession Vernault (Lily Sergeyev) concealed from interrogators.\n    concealed_profession = \"painter\"\n\n    # Print the final answer to the user's question.\n    print(f\"Andre Vernault concealed from interrogators his true profession, which was that of a {concealed_profession}.\")\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<painter>>>"
