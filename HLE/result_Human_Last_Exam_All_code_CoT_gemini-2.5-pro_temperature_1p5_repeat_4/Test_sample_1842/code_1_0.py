# The original equation factors into:
# (x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - w^4) * (x^3 + y^3 - z^3) = 0
# For positive integers, x^3 + y^3 = z^3 has no solutions (Fermat's Last Theorem).
# Thus, we must solve x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4.

# We need the solution with the smallest max(x, y, z, w).
# This is equivalent to finding the solution with the smallest w.
# The smallest known and verified solution is by Noam Elkies.
