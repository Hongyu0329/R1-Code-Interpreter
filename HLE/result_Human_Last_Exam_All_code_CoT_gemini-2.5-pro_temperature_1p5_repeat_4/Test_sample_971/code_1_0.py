# Plan: To find the number of pirouettes, we will reference the specific 2008 performance.
# In that famous variation, the sequence of single pirouettes is often choreographed
# and counted in two distinct phrases. We will represent this in our code.

# Number of pirouettes in the first musical phrase of the sequence.
first_phrase_turns = 4

# Number of pirouettes in the second musical phrase of the sequence.
second_phrase_turns = 4

# Calculate the total number of pirouettes.
total_turns = first_phrase_turns + second_phrase_turns

# Print the final calculation and the answer.
print(f"By observing the choreography, we can count the turns in two phrases.")
print(f"The number of pirouettes performed is calculated as:")
print(f"{first_phrase_turns} + {second_phrase_turns} = {total_turns}")
