    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to calculate the probability:\n\n1.  **Identify the System:** We are dealing with a particle in a 1D box, a fundamental quantum mechanics problem.\n2.  **State the Probability Density:** The probability of finding the particle at a certain position `x` is given by the square of the wavefunction's magnitude, `|ψ(x)|²`. For a 1D box of length `a`, this is `|ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a)`.\n3.  **Set Up the Integral:** To find the probability over an interval, we must integrate the probability density function over that interval. Here, `n=2`, and the interval is from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`. The integral is:\n    P = ∫ from 0.495a to 0.505a of `(2/a) * sin²(2*π*x/a) dx`\n4.  **Solve the Integral:** We will solve this definite integral. The variable `a` (the length of the box) will cancel out during the calculation. The analytical solution to the integral is `[x/a - (1/(4*π))*sin(4*π*x/a)]`.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Value:** We will evaluate the result of the integration at the given limits (`x = 0.495a` and `x = 0.505a`) and subtract them to find the final probability. I will use a Python script to perform this calculation with high precision.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Setup ---\n# Quantum number\nn = 2\n# Interval limits as a fraction of the box length 'a'\nx1_a = 0.495\nx2_a = 0.505\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# The probability P is the definite integral of |ψ(x)|² from x1 to x2.\n# P = ∫ [from x1 to x2] (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a) dx\n# The antiderivative of this function is:\n# F(x) = (x/a) - (1/(2*n*π)) * sin(2*n*π*x/a)\n# The probability is F(x2) - F(x1).\n# Note that 'a' cancels out if we work with x_a = x/a.\n\n# Let's define the antiderivative function in terms of z = x/a\ndef antiderivative(z, n_val):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the value of the integrated probability function.\"\"\"\n    return z - (1 / (2 * n_val * math.pi)) * math.sin(2 * n_val * math.pi * z)\n\n# Evaluate the antiderivative at the interval boundaries\nval_at_x2 = antiderivative(x2_a, n)\nval_at_x1 = antiderivative(x1_a, n)\n\n# The final probability is the difference\nprobability = val_at_x2 - val_at_x1\n\n# --- Output ---\nprint(\"To find the probability that the particle is in the interval [0.495a, 0.505a] for n=2, we solve the following integral:\")\nprint(\"P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2*π*x/a) dx\")\nprint(\"\\nAfter integration, the expression to evaluate is:\")\nprint(\"P = [x/a - sin(4*π*x/a) / (4*π)] evaluated from x=0.495a to x=0.505a\")\nprint(\"\\nThis results in the final equation:\")\n# We reconstruct the equation with all the numbers for clarity, as requested.\n# Equation form: P = (x2/a - x1/a) - (1/(4*π)) * [sin(4*π*x2/a) - sin(4*π*x1/a)]\nsin_term_2_val = math.sin(2 * n * math.pi * x2_a)\nsin_term_1_val = math.sin(2 * n * math.pi * x1_a)\ncoeff_val = 1 / (2 * n * math.pi)\n\nprint(f\"P = ({x2_a} - {x1_a}) - ({round(coeff_val, 5)}) * [sin(4*π*{x2_a}) - sin(4*π*{x1_a})]\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the numerical values of each part:\")\nprint(f\"sin(4*π*{x2_a}) = sin({round(4*x2_a, 3)}π) = {sin_term_2_val}\")\nprint(f\"sin(4*π*{x1_a}) = sin({round(4*x1_a, 3)}π) = {sin_term_1_val}\")\nprint(f\"Difference in sines = {sin_term_2_val} - ({sin_term_1_val}) = {sin_term_2_val - sin_term_1_val}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nPlugging these into the equation:\")\nprint(f\"P = {x2_a - x1_a} - {coeff_val} * ({sin_term_2_val - sin_term_1_val})\")\nprint(f\"P = {x2_a - x1_a} - {coeff_val * (sin_term_2_val - sin_term_1_val)}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe final probability is:\")\nprint(probability)\n\n<<<6.579737233890388e-06>>>\n```"
