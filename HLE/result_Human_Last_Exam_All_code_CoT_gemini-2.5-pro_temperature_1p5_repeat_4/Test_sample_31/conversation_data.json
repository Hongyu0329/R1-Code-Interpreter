    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers a person must look at to distinguish any of the 21 possible Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases from each other. This is a \"worst-case\" question, meaning we need to find the number of stickers required to differentiate the most similar-looking PLLs.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the Information Needed:** A PLL case is defined by the permutation of the 4 corner pieces and 4 edge pieces in the top layer. To identify the case, we need to gather enough information to know how these pieces are arranged.\n2.  **Corner Permutation is Key:** Many PLL recognition strategies start by identifying the permutation of the corner pieces. This is often done by looking for \"headlights\" â€“ a pair of corner pieces on a side face that have the same color sticker.\n3.  **Counting the Stickers for Corner Permutation:** To check for headlights on all four side faces (Front, Right, Back, and Left), we must observe the sticker colors on the corner pieces on each face.\n    *   **Front Face:** We need to see the stickers on the Front-Up-Left (FUL) and Front-Up-Right (FUR) corners. That's 2 stickers.\n    *   **Right Face:** We need to see the stickers on the Front-Up-Right (FUR) and Right-Up-Back (RUB) corners. That's 2 stickers, one of which we already saw from the front. So, 1 new sticker.\n    *   **Back Face:** We need to see the stickers on the Right-Up-Back (RUB) and Back-Up-Left (BUL) corners. That's 2 new stickers.\n    *   **Left Face:** We need to see the stickers on the Back-Up-Left (BUL) and Front-Up-Left (FUL) corners. These we have already seen while inspecting the other faces.\n\n4.  **A More Direct Count:** Let's list the unique corner stickers on the side faces:\n    *   The **FUL** corner has a sticker on the Front face and a sticker on the Left face. (2 stickers)\n    *   The **FUR** corner has a sticker on the Front face and a sticker on the Right face. (2 stickers)\n    *   The **RUB** corner has a sticker on the Right face and a sticker on the Back face. (2 stickers)\n    *   The **BUL** corner has a sticker on the Back face and a sticker on the Left face. (2 stickers)\n    To know the exact position and orientation of all four corner pieces, you must see all `4 corners * 2 stickers/corner = 8` stickers.\n\n5.  **Why 8 is Necessary:** Seeing these 8 stickers allows you to determine the permutation of the corners. This information is crucial and forms the basis of most recognition systems. For example, knowing the corner permutation tells you if you have headlights on zero, one, or four faces, which drastically narrows down the possible PLL case. While you might not always need all 8 (e.g., if you find headlights on the first face you look at), in the worst-case scenario, you would need to inspect all four faces to find the pattern. This requires observing all 8 unique corner stickers. Once the corner permutation is known, any remaining ambiguities (like distinguishing H, Z, and U perms, which all have solved corners) can be resolved by looking at just one or two edge stickers. However, the initial, unavoidable step in the worst case is determining the corner permutation.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of stickers that *must* be seen in the worst case to fully identify the PLL case is 8.\n\nThe python code below will print this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pll_sticker_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the reasoning for the number of stickers needed to identify a PLL case.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The 4 corner pieces of the top layer.\n    corners = [\"Front-Up-Left\", \"Front-Up-Right\", \"Right-Up-Back\", \"Back-Up-Left\"]\n    \n    # Each corner piece has 2 non-top-facing stickers.\n    stickers_per_corner = 2\n    \n    # The total number of non-top-facing corner stickers.\n    # This is the information required to know the permutation of all corners.\n    total_corner_stickers = len(corners) * stickers_per_corner\n    \n    print(\"To fully identify a PLL case, we need to distinguish it from all 20 other possibilities.\")\n    print(\"A robust method for this is to first determine the permutation of the 4 top-layer corner pieces.\")\n    print(\"\\nEach of the 4 corner pieces has 2 side-facing stickers.\")\n    print(f\"There are {len(corners)} corners and {stickers_per_corner} side stickers per corner.\")\n    print(\"To know where every corner is and how it's oriented, we must see all of these stickers.\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe calculation is: {len(corners)} corners * {stickers_per_corner} stickers/corner = {total_corner_stickers} stickers.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSeeing these 8 stickers allows you to identify patterns like 'headlights' on all four faces, which is the worst-case requirement for identifying the corner permutation.\")\n    print(\"Once the corner permutation is known, the PLL case is either uniquely identified or narrowed down to a very small group that can be distinguished by seeing just one or two more edge stickers.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, in the most challenging cases, 8 non-top-facing stickers must be seen to begin the identification.\")\n    \n    # Printing the final answer in the requested format\n    # The numbers in the equation are explicitly referenced.\n    num_corners = len(corners)\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Answer Equation: {num_corners} * {stickers_per_corner} = {total_corner_stickers}\")\n\n\nsolve_pll_sticker_count()\n\n# The final answer as a raw value\n# <<<8>>>\n```\n<<<8>>>"
