    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will identify the key concepts from the user's request. The user is asking for the maximum possible chromatic number ($\\chi(G)$) of a graph $G$ with a specific number of vertices, given that it's not a complete graph.\n2.  I will recall the fundamental properties of graph colouring. Specifically, the relationship between a graph's chromatic number and whether it is a complete graph.\n3.  I will establish an upper bound for the chromatic number for any graph that meets the specified conditions. A graph with $n$ vertices has a chromatic number of $n$ if and only if it is a complete graph ($K_n$). Since the graph is not complete, its chromatic number must be less than $n$.\n4.  Next, I will prove that this upper bound is achievable. I will construct an example of a graph with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete but has a chromatic number of $n-1$. A simple example is a graph consisting of a complete subgraph on $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and one additional isolated vertex.\n5.  Based on this reasoning, the maximum number of colours is $n-1$.\n6.  Finally, I will write a simple Python script to perform the calculation and print the result in the requested format, showing the numbers in the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring\n    of a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices in the graph G.\n    n = 12345\n    \n    # A graph on n vertices requires n colors if and only if it is the complete graph Kn.\n    # In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so each\n    # vertex must have a unique color.\n    \n    # The problem states that G is NOT a complete graph.\n    # Therefore, its chromatic number must be less than n.\n    # The maximum possible chromatic number is thus n - 1.\n    \n    # We can prove this is achievable by constructing a graph G' that is not complete\n    # and has a chromatic number of n - 1. For instance, consider a graph formed by\n    # a complete subgraph on n-1 vertices (K_{n-1}) and one isolated vertex.\n    # This graph has n vertices, is not complete, but requires n-1 colors for the K_{n-1} part.\n    # Thus, the maximum number of colors required is n - 1.\n    \n    max_colors = n - 1\n    \n    # Print the equation as requested.\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"For a graph G with n vertices, the chromatic number is n if and only if G is a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"Since G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be at most n-1.\")\n    print(\"This maximum is achievable, for example, by a graph consisting of a K_{n-1} clique and one isolated vertex.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the maximum number of colours is:\")\n    print(f\"{n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
