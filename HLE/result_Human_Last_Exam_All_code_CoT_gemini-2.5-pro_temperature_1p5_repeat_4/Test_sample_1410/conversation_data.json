    "My plan to solve this chess puzzle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** I will parse the provided FEN string `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20` to understand the placement of all pieces for both White and Black.\n2.  **Identify the optimal line of play:** My goal is to find the shortest forced checkmate for White, assuming Black plays optimally to defend and delay the mate as long as possible.\n3.  **Evaluate forcing moves:** I will look for checks, captures, and threats for White.\n    *   The move `1. Ng6+` is a powerful check.\n    *   I will analyze Black's possible responses to this check. I've determined that the pawn on f7 cannot capture the knight on g6 because it is pinned to the king by the White bishop on h5. The Black king also cannot move to h8 due to the same bishop. Therefore, Black has only one legal move: `1... hxg6`.\n4.  **Trace the forced sequence:** Since Black's first move is forced, I will follow the sequence to its conclusion.\n    *   After `1. Ng6+ hxg6`, White can continue the attack with `2. Qxg6+`.\n    *   This forces the Black king to the only available square: `2... Kh8`.\n    *   White can then deliver the final blow with `3. Qxh6#`, which is checkmate.\n5.  **Determine the number of moves:** The forced sequence consists of three moves by White. Therefore, White can win in 3 moves.\n6.  **Construct the Python script:** The final script will print the step-by-step move sequence of this forced mate and then output the final answer, which is 3.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and solves the chess puzzle presented by the FEN:\n    4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20\n    \n    The script will print the move-by-move solution for the forced checkmate.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The solution involves a forced checkmate for White.\")\n    print(\"Here is the winning sequence, which constitutes the 'equation' of moves:\")\n    \n    # The sequence of moves leading to mate.\n    moves = [\n        (\"Ng6+\", \"hxg6\"),\n        (\"Qxg6+\", \"Kh8\"),\n        (\"Qxh6#\", \"\")\n    ]\n    \n    num_white_moves = len(moves)\n    \n    # Printing the \"equation\" as requested, with each move number.\n    for i, move_pair in enumerate(moves):\n        move_number = i + 1\n        white_move, black_move = move_pair\n        if black_move:\n            print(f\"{move_number}. {white_move} {black_move}\")\n        else:\n            # The last move is checkmate, no black move follows.\n            print(f\"{move_number}. {white_move}\")\n            \n    print(\"\\nThis sequence is forced. Let's break down why:\")\n    print(\"1. Ng6+: White checks the Black king. The Black pawn on f7 cannot capture because it's pinned by the White bishop on h5. The king cannot move to h8 for the same reason. Black's only legal move is hxg6.\")\n    print(\"2. Qxg6+: White checks again. Black's only legal move is to move the king to h8.\")\n    print(\"3. Qxh6#: White delivers checkmate. The king is attacked and has no legal moves.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThus, assuming optimal play, the number of moves in which White can win is:\")\n    print(num_white_moves)\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n<<<3>>>\n```"
