    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the film and provide the answer.\n\nFirst, I will break down the user's request into key descriptive elements:\n1.  It's a Hollywood feature film from a major studio.\n2.  A teenager is the one riding the bike.\n3.  The bike's color is specifically pink.\n4.  The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\nBased on these specific details, I've identified the film. The scene occurs in the 1985 horror sequel *A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge*. In the film, the teenage protagonist, Jesse Walsh, flees his house on his little sister's pink bicycle. In a frantic attempt to get to a party, he pedals head-on toward a car, but is supernaturally lifted over it at the last second by Freddy Krueger's power. This film was produced by New Line Cinema (part of Warner Bros. Entertainment) and perfectly matches all the details in your query.\n\nHere is a Python script that will print the name of the movie for you.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies and prints the name of the film based on the described scene.\n# The film is a 1985 horror sequel produced by a major studio.\n# The scene involves a teenager named Jesse Walsh.\n# Jesse rides his little sister's pink bike directly toward an oncoming car.\nmovie_title = \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\"\nprint(movie_title)\n```\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"
