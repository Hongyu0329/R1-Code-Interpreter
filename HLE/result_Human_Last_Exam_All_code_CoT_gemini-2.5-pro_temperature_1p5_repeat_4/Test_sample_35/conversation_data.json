    "This is a classic poker scenario involving ICM (Independent Chip Model) pressure near the money bubble. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct hand to shove all-in.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Situation:**\n    *   **Position: UTG+1 (Under The Gun + 1)**. This is an early position, meaning there are many players to act after you. This requires a tighter hand range.\n    *   **Stack Size: 16 Big Blinds (bb)**. This is a typical \"shove/fold\" stack. You don't have enough chips to raise and then fold to a 3-bet, so your only viable aggressive options are to go all-in or fold.\n    *   **Tournament Stage: Near the Money Bubble**. This is the most critical factor. Players with medium or big stacks will be looking to abuse the bubble and call your all-in with a tighter range than usual because they don't want to risk their tournament life. Conversely, you also want to be more careful, as surviving to make the money has significant value (ICM pressure).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Opponent Calling Ranges:**\n    *   Because of the bubble pressure, your opponents will only call your 16bb shove with very strong hands. A typical tight calling range in this spot would be something like Pocket Nines or better (99+), Ace-Queen suited (AQs+), and Ace-King offsuit (AKo).\n\n3.  **Calculate Equity Against the Calling Range:**\n    *   We need to determine how our potential hands perform if we get called by this tight range. The goal is to shove with hands that have good \"showdown equity\" (chance to win if called) while also benefiting from \"fold equity\" (the chance everyone folds).\n    *   **QJs**: Performs very poorly against a range of {99+, AQs+, AKo}. It is dominated by AQs and is a big underdog to the pocket pairs. Its equity is only around 31%.\n    *   **AJo**: Also performs poorly. It is dominated by AQs and AKo and is only flipping against 99, TT, and JJ. Its equity is around 36%.\n    *   **99**: This is a strong hand. It's a coin flip against overcards like AQs and AKo but is behind the higher pairs (TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA). Its equity is respectable, around 44%. This is a standard and profitable shove.\n    *   **AKo**: This is a premium hand. It dominates AQs and flips with all pairs except AA and KK (which it blocks, making them less likely). It has the best performance when called, with about 47% equity against the assumed calling range.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Both `99` and `AKo` are correct, profitable shoves in this situation. However, `AKo` is the superior hand. It has higher equity when called and has powerful \"blocker\" effects, reducing the probability that an opponent holds AA or KK. Given the options, `AKo` is the strongest and most standard hand to jam.\n\nHere is the Python code that formalizes this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef poker_bubble_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes a poker hand scenario on the money bubble\n    to determine the correct all-in shove.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Scenario Definition ---\n    position = \"UTG+1\"\n    stack_bb = 16\n    situation = \"Near the money bubble\"\n\n    # --- Hand Options from the user ---\n    hand_options = {\n        \"A\": \"QJs\",\n        \"C\": \"99\",\n        \"D\": \"AJo\",\n        \"E\": \"AKo\"\n    }\n\n    # On the bubble, opponents will call a 16bb shove with a very tight range.\n    # We assume a calling range of 99+, AQs+, AKo.\n    assumed_calling_range = \"{99+, AQs+, AKo}\"\n\n    # Pre-calculated equities of each hand against the assumed calling range.\n    # In a real scenario, this is calculated with poker solver software.\n    equities = {\n        \"QJs\": 31,\n        \"99\": 44,\n        \"AJo\": 36,\n        \"AKo\": 47\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing shove options from {position} with {stack_bb}bb on the bubble.\\n\")\n    print(f\"We assume opponents will only call our all-in with a tight range like {assumed_calling_range}.\")\n    print(\"A good shove should have high fold equity and decent showdown equity if called.\\n\")\n    print(\"--- Equity Calculation When Called ---\")\n\n    best_hand = None\n    max_equity = -1\n\n    # We iterate through the provided choices to show the math for each.\n    for option_letter, hand_name in hand_options.items():\n        equity = equities[hand_name]\n        print(f\"Hand {option_letter} ({hand_name}): {hand_name} vs. {assumed_calling_range} = ~{equity}% equity\")\n        if equity > max_equity:\n            max_equity = equity\n            best_hand = hand_name\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"QJs and AJo have poor equity when called and are too weak to shove from early position on the bubble.\")\n    print(\"99 is a strong hand and a profitable shove with ~44% equity against a tight calling range.\")\n    print(f\"{best_hand} is a premium hand with the best equity when called (~{max_equity}%).
