    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this group theory problem using a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$ or $SD_{2^9}$. It is a non-abelian group of order 512.\n2.  **Define Power Subgroup:** A \"power subgroup\" of a group $G$ is a subgroup $H$ which can be written as $H = G^m = \\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $m$. For non-abelian groups, the set $G^m$ is not always a subgroup.\n3.  **Use a Known Theorem:** A theorem by R. Brandl states that for the semidihedral group $G = SD_{2^n}$ (with $n \\ge 4$), the set $G^m$ forms a subgroup if and only if one of these two conditions holds:\n    *   `m` is an even integer.\n    *   `m` is an integer such that $m \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{n-2}}$.\n4.  **Count the Subgroups:** I will write a Python script to count the number of distinct subgroups that arise from each of these conditions for our group $G = SD_{512}$ (where $n=9$).\n    *   **Case 1 (m is even):** For an even `m`, the power subgroup $G^m$ is a cyclic subgroup of the form $\\langle r^d \\rangle$, where `r` is the generator of the maximal cyclic subgroup of $G$ (of order 256), and `d` is an even divisor of 256. The script will count these subgroups.\n    *   **Case 2 (m $\\equiv$ 1 mod 128):** For any `m` satisfying this condition, the power subgroup $G^m$ is the entire group $G$ itself. This gives one more subgroup.\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases, as the subgroups are distinct (cyclic subgroups vs. the non-cyclic group G). The script will perform this sum and print the final equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n    A power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be expressed as\n    H = G^m = {g^m | g in G} for some integer m.\n\n    For the semidihedral group G = SD_{2^n}, G^m is a subgroup if and only if:\n    1. m is even.\n    2. m is congruent to 1 modulo 2^(n-2).\n\n    We analyze these two cases for G = SD_512, where n=9.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 9\n    order_r = 2**(n - 1)  # This is 256, the order of the maximal cyclic subgroup <r>\n\n    # Case 1: m is an even integer.\n    # The resulting power subgroups are the cyclic subgroups <r^d> where d is an even divisor of 256.\n    # The divisors of 256 (which is 2^8) are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\n    # The even divisors are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256. There are 8 of them.\n    # This number can be calculated as log2 of the order of <r>.\n    num_even_case_subgroups = int(math.log2(order_r))\n\n    # Case 2: m is congruent to 1 modulo 2^(n-2).\n    # For n=9, this condition is m = 1 (mod 128).\n    # This always results in the entire group G = SD_512 itself.\n    # This gives exactly one subgroup.\n    num_odd_case_subgroups = 1\n\n    # The subgroups from Case 1 are all cyclic and proper subgroups of G.\n    # The subgroup from Case 2 is G itself, which is non-cyclic.\n    # Therefore, the two sets of subgroups are disjoint.\n    total_subgroups = num_even_case_subgroups + num_odd_case_subgroups\n\n    print(f\"The number of power subgroups from Case 1 (m is even) is {num_even_case_subgroups}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of power subgroups from Case 2 (m = 1 mod 128) is {num_odd_case_subgroups}.\")\n    print(\"The total number of power subgroups is the sum of these two disjoint sets.\")\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{num_even_case_subgroups} + {num_odd_case_subgroups} = {total_subgroups}\")\n\n\ncount_power_subgroups()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
