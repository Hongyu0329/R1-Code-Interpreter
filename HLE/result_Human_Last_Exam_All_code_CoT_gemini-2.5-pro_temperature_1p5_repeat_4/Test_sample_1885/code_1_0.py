# This script explains why the answer to the user's question is NO.
# The code is a high-level pseudocode for a mathematical construction,
# as the objects involved (uncountable sets) are not machine-representable.

# --- The Main Idea ---
# We will construct a sequence of functions <f_alpha : alpha < omega_2>
# such that for any uncountable subset X of omega_2, the family of functions
# {f_beta : beta in X} is not pointwise bounded by any single function g.

# --- Sketch of the Counterexample Construction ---

# We define a sequence of functions f_alpha: omega_1 -> omega_1 for alpha < omega_2
# by transfinite recursion. The logic depends on the type of ordinal alpha is.

# 1. Base case (alpha = 0):
#    f_0 is the function that is always 0.
#    f_0(gamma) = 0 for all gamma < omega_1.

# 2. Successor step (alpha = beta + 1):
#    We simply increment the previous function.
#    f_{beta+1}(gamma) = f_beta(gamma) + 1 for all gamma.
#    This ensures f_beta < f_{beta+1} everywhere.

# 3. Limit step (alpha is a limit ordinal):
#    The definition depends on the cofinality of alpha.
#    a) If cofinality(alpha) is omega (countable):
#       Let beta_0, beta_1, ... be a sequence approaching alpha.
#       f_alpha(gamma) = sup{f_{beta_n}(gamma) for n in {0, 1, 2, ...}}.
#       Since omega_1 is a regular cardinal, this supremum of a countable
#       set of ordinals less than omega_1 is also an ordinal less than omega_1.
#
#    b) If cofinality(alpha) is omega_1 (uncountable):
#       This is the crucial step for the counterexample. We use these special
#       ordinals to ensure our sequence has the desired property.
#       There are omega_2 such 'special' alphas. We can pair each special alpha
#       with a coordinate gamma_special from omega_1.
#
#       For a special alpha paired with coordinate gamma_special, we define f_alpha
#       to grow extremely fast at that specific coordinate:
#       f_alpha(gamma_special) = sup{f_beta(gamma_special) for all beta < alpha} + 1.
#
#       (For other coordinates gamma != gamma_special, we use a simpler definition,
#       like in 3a, to ensure the increasing-modulo-finite property holds).

# --- Why This Construction Works (Proof Sketch) ---

# Let X be any uncountable subset of omega_2. We must show {f_beta : beta in X}
# is not pointwise bounded.

# 1. By a combinatorial argument (the pigeonhole principle for uncountable sets),
#    there must be a single coordinate, say gamma_star < omega_1, that was
#    designated as `gamma_special` for an uncountable number of ordinals in X.
#    Let's call this new uncountable subset of X, Y.

# 2. Now, consider any two functions f_{alpha_1} and f_{alpha_2} where
#    alpha_1 and alpha_2 are in Y and alpha_1 < alpha_2.
#    By our construction for these special ordinals:
#    f_{alpha_2}(gamma_star) = sup{ f_beta(gamma_star) for all beta < alpha_2 } + 1.
#    Since alpha_1 is one of the 'beta's less than alpha_2, this means:
#    f_{alpha_2}(gamma_star) is strictly greater than f_{alpha_1}(gamma_star).

# 3. This establishes that the set of values {f_alpha(gamma_star) : alpha in Y}
#    is a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals, indexed by the uncountable set Y.

# 4. A strictly increasing sequence of ordinals of length omega_1 (or more) cannot be
#    bounded within omega_1. Its supremum must be omega_1 itself.
#    Therefore, the set of values is cofinal (unbounded) in omega_1.

# 5. This means no single ordinal value g(gamma_star) < omega_1 can be an upper bound
#    for all f_alpha(gamma_star) where alpha is in Y. This proves that the family
#    {f_beta : beta in X} is not pointwise bounded.
