    This function determines the parameter group changes for different violin playing variations.
    
    The mapping is as follows:
    1. sul ponticello -> ii (timbre/harmonics)
    2. bridge mute -> iv (body/wood resonance)
    3. helium-filled room -> iii (air resonance)
    4. E string -> i (fundamental frequency)

    For the bridge mute (variation 2, group iv), the last parameter is f2.
    Adding mass with a mute lowers the resonant frequency.
    Therefore, the direction of change for f2 is 'down'.
