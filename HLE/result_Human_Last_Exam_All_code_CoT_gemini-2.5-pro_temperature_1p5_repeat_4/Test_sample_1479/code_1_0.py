    print("A Type-1 MF maps elements from a single domain to a crisp membership value.")
    print("It has a 2-dimensional structure:")
    print("  - Dimension 1: The variable from the Universe of Discourse (e.g., 'x')")
    print("  - Dimension 2: The membership grade 'Î¼(x)', a single number in [0, 1]")
    print("This can be visualized as a simple curve on a 2D plane.")

    # Step 2: Explain Type-2 Fuzzy MF
    print("\n[Step 2] Type-2 Fuzzy Membership Function (3D Structure)")
    print("A Type-2 MF models uncertainty about the membership grade itself. For any 'x', the membership grade is not a single point but a fuzzy set.")
    print("This requires adding a new dimension, resulting in a 3D structure:")
    print("  - Dimension 1: The variable from the Universe of Discourse ('x')")
    print("  - Dimension 2: The primary membership variable ('u'), which spans the possible membership grades for 'x'")
    print("  - Dimension 3: The secondary membership grade, which assigns a value to each primary membership variable 'u'")
    print("This 3D structure is the 'Footprint of Uncertainty' and its associated secondary grades, representing a fundamental shift to model uncertainty dimensionally.")

    # Step 3: Explain Type-3 Fuzzy MF
    print("\n[Step 3] Type-3 Fuzzy Membership Function (Extension of 3D Structure)")
    print("A Type-3 MF extends the Type-2 model by introducing uncertainty about the secondary membership grade.")
    print("This means the value in the 3rd dimension is now also a fuzzy set, requiring a 'tertiary membership function' to define.")
    print("While this can be conceptualized in 4D, it is an elaboration of the 3D uncertainty modeling paradigm introduced by Type-2 sets.")

    # Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices
    print("\n[Step 4] Evaluating the Answer Choices")
    print("The question asks for the 'fundamental difference' between Type-2 and Type-3 MFs in terms of dimensional structure.")
    print("\n- Choice F, 'Tertiary membership functions introduced', accurately describes the feature that distinguishes a Type-3 MF from a Type-2 MF.")
    print("- However, Choice E, 'Three-dimensional uncertainty modeling added', describes the paradigm shift that enables higher-order fuzzy sets like Type-2 and Type-3.")
    print("\nThe most 'fundamental' change in dimensional structure in the entire hierarchy is the move from a 2D curve (Type-1) to a 3D surface of uncertainty (Type-2).")
    print("Type-3 builds upon this same 3D structure by making the third dimension fuzzy. Therefore, the concept of 'three-dimensional uncertainty modeling' represents the core structural framework that underpins both Type-2 and Type-3, and its introduction is the most fundamental difference from simpler fuzzy sets.")
    print("\nFinal Conclusion: The fundamental concept that differentiates higher-order fuzzy sets (Type-2, Type-3, etc.) from Type-1 in terms of dimensional structure is the addition of the third dimension for uncertainty.")
