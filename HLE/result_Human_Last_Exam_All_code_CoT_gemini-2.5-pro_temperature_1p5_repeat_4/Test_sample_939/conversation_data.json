    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: The core of the problem is about color gamuts. The ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space has a much wider gamut than the sRGB color space. This means there are many colors that exist in ROMM RGB but fall outside the range of colors that sRGB can display. These are called \"out-of-gamut\" colors.\n2.  **Conversion Process**: To check if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert it to the sRGB color space. This involves a two-step mathematical process:\n    *   **Linearization**: The input ROMM RGB values are first converted to a linear representation. For ROMM RGB, this is done by raising the color component values to the power of 1.8 (gamma 1.8).\n    *   **Matrix Transformation**: The linear ROMM RGB values are then multiplied by a specific 3x3 conversion matrix. This matrix transforms the coordinates from the linear ROMM RGB space to the linear sRGB space.\n3.  **Gamut Check**: After the conversion, we get a set of linear sRGB values (R', G', B'). For a color to be representable in sRGB, all of these component values must fall within the range of [0, 1]. If any value is less than 0 or greater than 1, the original ROMM RGB color is out-of-gamut for sRGB and cannot be accurately represented.\n4.  **Execution**: I will write a Python script that performs these calculations for each of the five given colors. The script will:\n    *   Define the list of ROMM RGB colors.\n    *   Use the standard conversion matrix from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB.\n    *   For each color, linearize the components and apply the matrix transformation.\n    *   Print the resulting linear sRGB values for clarity, as requested.\n    *   Check if the results are within the [0, 1] gamut.\n    *   Collect the numbers of the colors that are out-of-gamut.\n    *   Finally, print the list of these numbers in the specified format.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the analysis:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which of the given ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented\n    by the sRGB color space.\n    \"\"\"\n    # This is the standard conversion matrix from linear ProPhoto RGB (ROMM RGB)\n    # to linear sRGB, including chromatic adaptation from D50 to D65.\n    M_ROMM_TO_SRGB = np.array([\n        [ 1.82137024, -0.61343460, -0.20793563],\n        [-0.18301323,  1.19233626, -0.00932303],\n        [ 0.02476595, -0.10640161,  1.08163566]\n    ])\n\n    # The list of ROMM RGB color values provided in the problem.\n    colors = [\n        (0, 0, 1),\n        (0, 1, 0),\n        (0, 0.5, 0.6),\n        (0.4, 0.5, 0.6),\n        (1, 1, 1)\n    ]\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"Analyzing ROMM RGB to sRGB conversion for gamut clipping:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 60)\n\n    # ROMM RGB uses a gamma of 1.8 for its transfer function.\n    # We linearize the values by raising them to the power of 1.8.\n    def linearize_romm_component(c):\n        # The full transfer function has a linear segment near black,\n        # but for the given values, a simple power function is sufficient.\n        return c**1.8\n\n    for i, color_romm in enumerate(colors):\n        r, g, b = color_romm\n        \n        # Step 1: Linearize the ROMM RGB values\n        romm_linear = np.array([\n            linearize_romm_component(r),\n            linearize_romm_component(g),\n            linearize_romm_component(b)\n        ])\n        \n        # Step 2: Convert from linear ROMM to linear sRGB via matrix multiplication\n        srgb_linear = M_ROMM_TO_SRGB.dot(romm_linear)\n        \n        # Step 3: Check if the resulting sRGB values are in the [0, 1] gamut.\n        # A small tolerance is used to account for floating-point inaccuracies.\n        is_out_of_gamut = np.any(srgb_linear < -0.0001) or np.any(srgb_linear > 1.0001)\n        \n        print(f\"Color {i+1}: ROMM RGB({r}, {g}, {b})\")\n        print(f\"  Final Equation Result (Linear sRGB):\")\n        print(f\"  R = {srgb_linear[0]:.4f}\")\n        print(f\"  G = {srgb_linear[1]:.4f}\")\n        print(f\"  B = {srgb_linear[2]:.4f}\")\n\n        if is_out_of_gamut:\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(i + 1)\n            print(\"  Result: Cannot be represented in sRGB (Out of Gamut).\\n\")\n        else:\n            print(\"  Result: Can be represented in sRGB (In Gamut).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"=\" * 60)\n    \n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        result_str = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        out_of_gamut_indices.sort()\n        result_str = \", \".join(map(str, out_of_gamut_indices))\n\n    print(f\"The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are: {result_str}\")\n    print(f\"<<<{result_str}>>>\")\n\n# Run the analysis\nsolve()\n```"
