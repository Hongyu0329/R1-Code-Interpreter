# This is a symbolic problem. The python code will not compute anything,
# but rather formalize the derivation process outlined in the plan.
# The final answer is a string of numbers derived from mathematical reasoning.

# Step 1-2: Define symbolic objects and basic properties.
# Let M be a commutative, idempotent monoid.
# Let G be an abelian group.
# Let Phi(m) be a function from M to G.
# Let '.' denote the monoid action m.g.
# Property 1 (cocycle): Phi(m1*m2) = Phi(m1) + m1.Phi(m2)
# Property 2 (idempotency): m*m = m
# From these, m.Phi(m) = 0 for all m in M.

# Step 3: The main assumption for some k, l, m in M
# Psi(k,l,m) = 0  =>  Phi(k) + Phi(l) + Phi(m) = Phi(k*l*m)

# Let's outline the derivation of the key result: x.Phi(y) = 0 for distinct x,y in {k,l,m}
# This part is pure mathematical reasoning.

# Step 4-5:
# Phi(k*l*m) = Phi(k*(l*m)) = Phi(k) + k.Phi(l*m) = Phi(k) + k.(Phi(l) + l.Phi(m))
#            = Phi(k) + k.Phi(l) + (k*l).Phi(m)
# By commutativity, k*l*m = l*k*m.
# Phi(l*k*m) = Phi(l) + l.Phi(k) + (l*k).Phi(m)
# Equating the two expressions for Phi(k*l*m):
# Phi(k) + k.Phi(l) = Phi(l) + l.Phi(k)
# => Phi(k) - l.Phi(k) = Phi(l) - k.Phi(l)
# This is Phi^2(k,l) = Phi^2(l,k).

# Step 6.1: Deriving (xy).Phi(x) = 0
# Act on Phi^2(k,l) = Phi^2(l,k) with k:
# k.(Phi(k) - l.Phi(k)) = k.(Phi(l) - k.Phi(l))
# k.Phi(k) - k.(l.Phi(k)) = k.Phi(l) - k.(k.Phi(l))
# 0 - (k*l).Phi(k) = k.Phi(l) - (k*k).Phi(l) = k.Phi(l) - k.Phi(l) = 0
# So, (k*l).Phi(k) = 0.
# By symmetry, for any distinct x, y from {k,l,m}, we have (x*y).Phi(x) = 0.

# Step 6.2: Deriving x.Phi(y) = (x*y).Phi(y)
# From the main assumption for (k,m,l): Phi(k)+Phi(m)+Phi(l) = Phi(k*m*l)
# Phi(k*m*l) = Phi(k) + k.Phi(m*l) = Phi(k) + k.(Phi(m) + m.Phi(l)) = Phi(k) + k.Phi(m) + (k*m).Phi(l)
# So, Phi(m) + Phi(l) = k.Phi(m) + (k*m).Phi(l).
# Act on this with k:
# k.Phi(m) + k.Phi(l) = k.(k.Phi(m)) + k.((k*m).Phi(l)) = k.Phi(m) + (k*k*m).Phi(l) = k.Phi(m) + (k*m).Phi(l)
# This implies k.Phi(l) = (k*m).Phi(l).
# By symmetry, for distinct x, y, z from {k,l,m}, we have x.Phi(y) = (x*z).Phi(y). Let's use x.Phi(y) = (x*y).Phi(y).
# To prove that, consider premise for (l,k,m) -> ... -> l.Phi(k)=(lk).Phi(k)
# By symmetry, for distinct x, y, we have x.Phi(y) = (xy).Phi(y).

# Step 6.3: Final deduction
# From Step 6.1, we have (y*x).Phi(y) = 0.
# From Step 6.2, we have x.Phi(y) = (x*y).Phi(y).
# Therefore, x.Phi(y) = 0 for distinct x, y.

# Step 7-12: Evaluate the 12 identities based on the result `x.Phi(y) = 0` for x!=y.
# We assume k,l,m are distinct. The result also holds for degenerate cases.

# 1. Phi(k) = 0: False. We showed this with a counterexample in our thought process.
# 2. l.Phi(m) = 0: True, since l != m.
# 3. (k*m).Phi(l) = k.(m.Phi(l)). Since m != l, m.Phi(l) = 0. So k.0 = 0. True.
# 4. (k*l*m).Phi(k) = (k*l).(m.Phi(k)). Since m != k, m.Phi(k) = 0. So (k*l).0 = 0. True.
# 5. Phi^2(k;l) = Phi(k) - l.Phi(k) = Phi(k) - 0 = Phi(k). Not necessarily 0. False.
# 6. k.Phi^2(l;m) = k.(Phi(l) - m.Phi(l)) = k.Phi(l) - k.(m.Phi(l)) = 0 - (k*m).Phi(l) = 0. True.
# 7. (l*m).Phi^2(k;m) = (l*m).(Phi(k)-m.Phi(k)) = (l*m).Phi(k)-(l*m*m).Phi(k) = (l*m).Phi(k)-(l*m).Phi(k) = 0. True.
# 8. (k*l*m).Phi^2(k;l) = (k*l*m).(Phi(k) - l.Phi(k)) = (k*l*m).Phi(k) - (k*l*m).(l.Phi(k)).
#    (k*l*m).Phi(k) = 0 (same as #4).
#    (k*l*m*l).Phi(k) = (k*l*m).Phi(k) = 0. So 0-0=0. True.
# 9. Phi^3(k;l;m) = Phi^2(k;l) - m.Phi^2(k;l) = (Phi(k)-l.Phi(k)) - m.(Phi(k)-l.Phi(k))
#                 = Phi(k) - m.Phi(k) = Phi(k). Not necessarily 0. False.
# 10. k.Phi^3(k;l;m) = k.(Phi(k)) = 0, by the general property m.Phi(m)=0. True.
# 11. (l*m).Phi^3(k;l;m) = (l*m).Phi(k) = l.(m.Phi(k)). Since m!=k, m.Phi(k)=0. So l.0=0. True.
# 12. (k*l*m).Phi^3(k;l;m) = (k*l*m).Phi(k) = 0, same as #4. True.
