    # The variance of the input rates (sigma^2) is also a crucial parameter.
    # For a rate calculated from a Poisson process over a time window T, Var(rate) = mean_rate / T.
    # We assume a standard unit time window (T=1s), which simplifies the variance to be equal to the mean.

    # The balance between potentiation and depression requires the expected change in the
    # mean synaptic weight to be zero. This leads to the following condition relating
    # the input statistics to the learning rule parameters:
    # C + sigma^2 = (N_v + N_s) * mu * (theta - mu)
    # From this, we can solve for the critical covariance C.
