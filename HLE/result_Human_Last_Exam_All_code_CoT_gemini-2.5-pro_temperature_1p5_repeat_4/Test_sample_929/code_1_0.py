This movement across the flower structure (like a milkweed umbel) is extremely effective for pollinating multiple flowers. It represents a high benefit (many flowers pollinated) for a low cost (less nectar consumed). This is arguably the ideal pollinator behavior from the plant's perspective."

However, it doesn't specify the quality of the interaction. The insect could land and remain on a single leaf or flower, which may not be as beneficial as the behavior described in A."
