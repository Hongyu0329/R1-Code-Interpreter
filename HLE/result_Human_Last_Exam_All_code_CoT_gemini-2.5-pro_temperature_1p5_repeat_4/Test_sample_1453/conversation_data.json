    "This task requires us to predict the oligomeric state of a protein's coiled-coil sequence. The primary determinant for this is the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of amino acid side chains in the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil. The core is formed by residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern called a heptad repeat (`abcdefg`).\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Assign Heptad Repeats:** I will map the given sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` to the `abcdefg` heptad repeat pattern.\n2.  **Identify Core Residues:** I will extract the amino acids at the core 'a' and 'd' positions. The size and shape of these residues are critical for determining the oligomeric state.\n3.  **Analyze Core Packing:** I will analyze the identified core residues based on established principles:\n    *   **Dimers (2-stranded coils):** Typically have medium-sized hydrophobic residues (like Leucine) that pack efficiently. A very bulky residue would cause steric hindrance.\n    *   **Trimers (3-stranded coils):** Have a larger core that can accommodate bulkier residues. The presence of a single, large aromatic residue like Tryptophan (W) often forces a trimeric state.\n    *   **Tetramers (4-stranded coils):** Have an even larger core but often require specific patterns of residues (e.g., Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd') for stable packing.\n4.  **Conclude and Code:** Based on the analysis, I will determine the most likely oligomeric state and write a Python script that prints this reasoning step-by-step. The script's output will explain the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_coiled_coil(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Assign heptad positions and identify core residues\n    heptad_map = \"abcdefg\"\n    a_positions = []\n    d_positions = []\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Assigning heptad repeat positions ('a' through 'g').\")\n    print(\"The critical core positions are 'a' and 'd'.\")\n    for i, residue in enumerate(sequence):\n        position = heptad_map[i % 7]\n        if position == 'a':\n            a_positions.append(residue)\n        elif position == 'd':\n            d_positions.append(residue)\n\n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: Identifying core residues.\")\n    print(f\"Residues at 'a' positions: {', '.join(a_positions)}\")\n    print(f\"Residues at 'd' positions: {', '.join(d_positions)}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze packing efficiency based on core residues\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing packing based on residue size.\")\n    \n    has_tryptophan_at_d = 'W' in d_positions\n    \n    print(\"Rule 1: Dimeric coiled-coils have a tightly packed core.
