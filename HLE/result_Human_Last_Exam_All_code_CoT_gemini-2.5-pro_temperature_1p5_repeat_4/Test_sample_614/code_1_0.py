# Based on the logic puzzle's clues, I've determined the correct sequence.
# Here is the breakdown of the solution:
# 1. Determine the order of the entities:
#    - Position 1: "Number 1" ("is the first to have something")
#    - Position 5: "the fifth" ("lastly follows")
#    - Position 4: "Number three" ("protects the last")
#    - Positions 2 & 3: "Number 2" then "Number 4" ("Number 4 ... always goes behind")
#    - The order of entities is: Number 1, Number 2, Number 4, Number three, the fifth.
#
# 2. Assign values {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} to the entities:
#    - Number 1 = 1 ("weakest")
#    - Number 2 = 5 ("best")
#    - From the remaining values {2, 3, 4}:
#        - Number three = 4 ("strongest")
#        - Number 4 = 3 ("likes two [value 5] the most", 3 is closer to 5 than 2 is)
#        - the fifth = 2 (the remaining value)
#
# 3. Construct the final sequence:
#    - Position 1 (Number 1) is 1
#    - Position 2 (Number 2) is 5
#    - Position 3 (Number 4) is 3
#    - Position 4 (Number three) is 4
#    - Position 5 (the fifth) is 2
#
# The final sequence is 1 5 3 4 2. The code below will print it.

final_sequence = [1, 5, 3, 4, 2]

# The riddle asks to put the numbers in the correct order.
# The following print statement outputs each number that forms the final sequence.
print("The numbers in the correct order are:")
print(final_sequence[0], final_sequence[1], final_sequence[2], final_sequence[3], final_sequence[4])
