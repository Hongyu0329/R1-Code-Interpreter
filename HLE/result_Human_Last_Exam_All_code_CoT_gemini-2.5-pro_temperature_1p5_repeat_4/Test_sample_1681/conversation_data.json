    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Quantum Game Framework**: We will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, which is a standard model for quantum games.\n    *   **Initial State**: The two players' qubits start in a maximally entangled state, created by an entangling operator `J` acting on the initial state `|00⟩`. We'll use the standard entangling operator `J = (1/√2)(I ⊗ I + i σ_x ⊗ σ_x)`. The initial state is `|ψ_in⟩ = J|00⟩`.\n    *   **Player Strategies**: The classical strategies 'Cooperate' (C) and 'Defect' (D) are represented by specific quantum operators. A new quantum-only strategy 'Q' is also introduced.\n        *   `C` (Cooperate): The identity operator, `I`.\n        *   `D` (Defect): The Pauli-Y rotation, `iσ_y`.\n        *   `Q` (Quantum \"Miracle\" Move): The Pauli-Z rotation, `iσ_z`.\n    *   **Final State and Measurement**: Players Alice and Bob apply their chosen strategies (`U_A`, `U_B`) to their respective qubits. The final state `|ψ_f⟩ = (U_A ⊗ U_B)|ψ_in⟩` is then disentangled using `J†` (the conjugate transpose of `J`) before measurement. The measured state is `|ψ_out⟩ = J†|ψ_f⟩`.\n    *   **Payoffs**: The probability of measuring each classical outcome (CC, CD, DC, DD) is calculated from `|ψ_out⟩`. These probabilities are then used with the given payoff matrix to determine the expected payoff for each player.\n\n2.  **Construct the Payoff Matrix**: We will calculate the expected payoffs for Alice and Bob for every possible combination of strategies from the set {C, D, Q}. This will give us a 3x3 payoff table.\n\n3.  **Identify the Nash Equilibrium**: A Nash Equilibrium is a strategy pair where neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. We will analyze the 3x3 payoff matrix to find such a point.\n\n4.  **Present the Final Calculation**: The Python code will formally calculate the payoffs for the identified equilibrium strategy pair. It will show how the outcome probabilities are determined and used to compute the final payoff values, presenting this as a final equation.\n\nBased on this plan, the analysis reveals that the classical Nash equilibrium `(D,D)` is no longer an equilibrium in this quantum version. A new equilibrium emerges. Surprisingly, it's not the much-discussed `(Q,Q)` strategy, which proves to be unstable as a player can get a higher payoff by defecting. Instead, the `(C,C)` strategy becomes a stable Nash Equilibrium, thus resolving the dilemma.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the payoffs for this equilibrium point.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef print_equilibrium_calculation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the payoff for the equilibrium point\n    in the quantum prisoner's dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Payoff matrix values: R(CC), S(CD), T(DC), P(DD)\n    R, S, T, P = 5, 0, 7, 1\n    payoffs_A = {'CC': R, 'CD': S, 'DC': T, 'DD': P}\n    payoffs_B = {'CC': R, 'CD': T, 'DC': S, 'DD': P}\n\n    # Define Pauli matrices and Identity\n    ID = np.array([[1, 0], [0, 1]], dtype=complex)\n    SIGMA_X = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]], dtype=complex)\n\n    # EWL Protocol operators\n    J = (1/np.sqrt(2)) * (np.kron(ID, ID) + 1j * np.kron(SIGMA_X, SIGMA_X))\n    J_dagger = J.conj().T\n\n    # Strategies\n    C = ID  # Cooperate\n\n    # The identified Nash Equilibrium in this quantum game is (Cooperate, Cooperate)\n    U_A = C\n    U_B = C\n\n    # Initial state |00>\n    psi_00 = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0], dtype=complex)\n\n    # Calculate the final state after measurement\n    # |psi_out> = J_dagger * (U_A kron U_B) * J * |00>\n    psi_f = np.kron(U_A, U_B) @ J @ psi_00\n    psi_out = J_dagger @ psi_f\n\n    # Calculate probabilities of classical outcomes\n    # P_xy = |<xy|psi_out>|^2\n    prob_CC = np.abs(psi_out[0])**2\n    prob_CD = np.abs(psi_out[1])**2\n    prob_DC = np.abs(psi_out[2])**2\n    prob_DD = np.abs(psi_out[3])**2\n\n    # Calculate expected payoffs\n    payoff_A = prob_CC * payoffs_A['CC'] + prob_CD * payoffs_A['CD'] + \\\n               prob_DC * payoffs_A['DC'] + prob_DD * payoffs_A['DD']\n    payoff_B = prob_CC * payoffs_B['CC'] + prob_CD * payoffs_B['CD'] + \\\n               prob_DC * payoffs_B['DC'] + prob_DD * payoffs_B['DD']\n\n    # Print the result as a detailed equation\n    print(\"Equilibrium Point: (Cooperate, Cooperate)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"Outcome Probabilities:\")\n    print(f\"P(CC) = {prob_CC:.1f}, P(CD) = {prob_CD:.1f}, P(DC) = {prob_DC:.1f}, P(DD) = {prob_DD:.1f}\")\n    print(\"\\nPayoff Calculation for Alice:\")\n    print(f\"Payoff(A) = P(CC)*{payoffs_A['CC']} + P(CD)*{payoffs_A['CD']} + P(DC)*{payoffs_A['DC']} + P(DD)*{payoffs_A['DD']}\")\n    print(f\"          = {prob_CC:.1f}*{payoffs_A['CC']} + {prob_CD:.1f}*{payoffs_A['CD']} + {prob_DC:.1f}*{payoffs_A['DC']} + {prob_DD:.1f}*{payoffs_A['DD']} = {payoff_A:.1f}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nPayoff Calculation for Bob:\")\n    print(f\"Payoff(B) = P(CC)*{payoffs_B['CC']} + P(CD)*{payoffs_B['CD']} + P(DC)*{payoffs_B['DC']} + P(DD)*{payoffs_B['DD']}\")\n    print(f\"          = {prob_CC:.1f}*{payoffs_B['CC']} + {prob_CD:.1f}*{payoffs_B['CD']} + {prob_DC:.1f}*{payoffs_B['DC']} + {prob_DD:.1f}*{payoffs_B['DD']} = {payoff_B:.1f}\")\n\n\nprint_equilibrium_calculation()\n```\n<<<Payoff(A) = 1.0*5 + 0.0*0 + 0.0*7 + 0.0*1 = 5.0>>>"
