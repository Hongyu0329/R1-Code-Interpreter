    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface.** For a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 2$, its simplicial volume is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g - 4$. This is derived from its relationship with the hyperbolic volume, $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)|$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2-2g$ is the Euler characteristic.\n\n2.  **Calculate the simplicial volume of each individual surface.**\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g_1 = 31$. So, $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times 31 - 4 = 120$.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g_2 = 17$. So, $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times 17 - 4 = 64$.\n\n3.  **Use the product formula for simplicial volume.** For two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ with dimensions $n$ and $m$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product is given by Gromov's theorem:\n    $\\|M \\times N\\| = \\binom{n+m}{n} \\|M\\| \\|N\\|$.\n    In our case, $M = \\Sigma_{31}$ and $N = \\Sigma_{17}$. Both are surfaces, so their dimensions are $n=2$ and $m=2$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the binomial coefficient.** The coefficient is $\\binom{2+2}{2} = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$.\n\n5.  **Combine the results.** We multiply the coefficient by the individual simplicial volumes to get the final answer:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the genera of the surfaces.\ng1 = 31\ng2 = 17\n\n# The dimensions of the surfaces are both 2.\nn = 2\nm = 2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the simplicial volume of each surface.\n# The formula for a surface of genus g >= 2 is ||Sigma_g|| = 4g - 4.\nvol1 = 4 * g1 - 4\nvol2 = 4 * g2 - 4\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the binomial coefficient for the product formula.\n# The coefficient is C(n+m, n).\ncoefficient = math.comb(n + m, n)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total simplicial volume of the product space.\ntotal_volume = coefficient * vol1 * vol2\n\n# Step 5: Print the final calculation, showing each number in the equation.\nprint(\"The simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces is calculated using the formula:\")\nprint(\"||Sigma_g1 x Sigma_g2|| = C(n+m, n) * ||Sigma_g1|| * ||Sigma_g2||\")\nprint(f\"where ||Sigma_g|| = 4g - 4, n = dim(Sigma_g1), and m = dim(Sigma_g2).\\n\")\nprint(\"For this problem:\")\nprint(f\"||Sigma_{g1}|| = 4 * {g1} - 4 = {vol1}\")\nprint(f\"||Sigma_{g2}|| = 4 * {g2} - 4 = {vol2}\")\nprint(f\"C({n+m}, {n}) = {coefficient}\\n\")\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"||\\u03A3_{g1} \\u00D7 \\u03A3_{g2}|| = {coefficient} \\u00D7 {vol1} \\u00D7 {vol2} = {total_volume}\")\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
