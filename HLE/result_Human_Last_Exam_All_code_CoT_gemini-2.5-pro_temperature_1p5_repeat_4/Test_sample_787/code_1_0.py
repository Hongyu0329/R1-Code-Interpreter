    This script calculates the limit of the sequence g_n for the given polynomial P(X).

    The limit of the sequence g_n is the fixed divisor of the polynomial P(X), which is
    the greatest common divisor of all values {P(k) | k in Z}.
    The fixed divisor d can be computed as d = product(q^a_q) over primes q, where
    a_q = min_{k in Z} v_q(P(k)), and v_q(n) is the q-adic valuation of n.

    The prime factors of d are determined to be 2, 3, and 5. For any other prime q,
    there exists an integer k such that P(k) is not divisible by q.

    The script then calculates the minimal q-adic valuations for q=2, 3, 5 and
    computes the final result.
