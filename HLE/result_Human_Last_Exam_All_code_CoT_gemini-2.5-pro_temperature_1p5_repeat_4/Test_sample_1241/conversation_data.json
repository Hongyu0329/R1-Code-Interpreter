    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the stationary (or steady-state) probabilities of the system. The stationary probabilities, denoted as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$, are the probabilities of the system being in state $i$ after a long time ($t \\to +\\infty$).\n\nAt steady state, the rate of change of probabilities is zero, so $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. This transforms the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Set up the steady-state equations:** Replace $P_i'(t)$ with 0 and $P_i(t)$ with $\\pi_i$ in the given system of equations.\n    *   $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n2.  **Add the normalization condition:** The sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1.\n    *   $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n3.  **Substitute the given values** for the transition rates $\\lambda_{ij}$.\n4.  **Solve the system of linear equations:** We now have a system of linear equations for the unknown probabilities $\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$. We can use any three of the first four equations along with the normalization condition to form a non-singular system.\n5.  **Calculate the desired sum:** Once we find the values for $\\pi_0$ and $\\pi_1$, we calculate their sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan by setting up the system of linear equations in matrix form `A * x = b` and solving it using `numpy.linalg.solve`. It then prints the individual probabilities and their sum as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given transition rates\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# To find the stationary probabilities P_inf = [pi_0, pi_1, pi_2, pi_3],\n# we set the derivatives of the system to zero, which gives a system of linear equations.\n# We select three independent equations from the system and add the normalization condition.\n#\n# 1) -lambda_01*pi_0 + lambda_10*pi_1 = 0\n# 2) lambda_12*pi_1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*pi_2 = 0\n# 3) lambda_23*pi_2 - lambda_31*pi_3 = 0\n# 4) pi_0 + pi_1 + pi_2 + pi_3 = 1\n#\n# This can be written in matrix form A * P_inf = b\n\nA = np.array([\n    [-lambda_01, lambda_10, 0, 0],\n    [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n    [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Solve the system of linear equations for the stationary probabilities\nP_inf = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n\n# Extract the probabilities for state 0 and state 1\nP0_inf = P_inf[0]\nP1_inf = P_inf[1]\n\n# Calculate the required sum\nresult = P0_inf + P1_inf\n\n# As requested, output each number in the final equation.\n# The final equation is P0(+infinity) + P1(+infinity) = result\nprint(f\"P0(+infinity) = {P0_inf}\")\nprint(f\"P1(+infinity) = {P1_inf}\")\nprint(f\"The equation is: {P0_inf} + {P1_inf} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339463>>>"
