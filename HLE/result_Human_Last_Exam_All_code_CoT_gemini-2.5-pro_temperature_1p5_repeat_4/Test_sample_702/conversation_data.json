    "To determine the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will analyze the long exact sequence of homotopy groups associated with a relevant fibration.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Fibration:** The map in question, let's call it $h: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, is a well-known map in homotopy theory. It is the main map in a fibration sequence:\n    $$ F \\to \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\xrightarrow{h} \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6) $$\n    The homotopy fiber, $F$, is the join of the loop spaces, $F = \\Omega S^4 * \\Omega S^6$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Connectivity of the Fiber:** The connectivity of the map $h$ is determined by the connectivity of its fiber $F$. We will calculate the connectivity of $F$ using established rules:\n    *   The connectivity of a sphere $S^n$ is $n-1$.\n    *   The connectivity of a loop space $\\Omega X$ is `conn(X) - 1`.\n    *   The connectivity of a join of two spaces $A * B$ is `conn(A) + conn(B) + 2`.\n\n3.  **Relate Fiber Connectivity to Map Connectivity:** We'll use the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the fibration. If the fiber $F$ is $k$-connected (meaning $\\pi_i(F) = 0$ for all $i \\le k$), then the map $h$ is $(k+1)$-connected. A map is said to be $n$-connected if it induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for $i < n$ and an epimorphism (a surjection) on $\\pi_n$.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** We will write a Python script to perform the numerical calculation based on the plan above and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the connectivity of the base spaces (spheres).\n    # The connectivity of S^n is n-1.\n    conn_s4 = 4 - 1\n    conn_s6 = 6 - 1\n    print(f\"The connectivity of S^4 is {conn_s4}.\")\n    print(f\"The connectivity of S^6 is {conn_s6}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the connectivity of the loop spaces.\n    # The connectivity of Omega X is conn(X) - 1.\n    conn_omega_s4 = conn_s4 - 1\n    conn_omega_s6 = conn_s6 - 1\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the loop space Omega S^4 is {conn_s4} - 1 = {conn_omega_s4}.\")\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the loop space Omega S^6 is {conn_s6} - 1 = {conn_omega_s6}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the connectivity of the fiber F = Omega S^4 * Omega S^6.\n    # The connectivity of the join A * B is conn(A) + conn(B) + 2.\n    conn_fiber = conn_omega_s4 + conn_omega_s6 + 2\n    print(\"The homotopy fiber of the map is the join of the loop spaces, F = Omega S^4 * Omega S^6.\")\n    print(f\"The connectivity of the fiber F is {conn_omega_s4} + {conn_omega_s6} + 2 = {conn_fiber}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Determine the connectivity of the map from the connectivity of the fiber.\n    # If the fiber is k-connected, the map is (k+1)-connected.\n    # This means the map induces isomorphisms on pi_i for i < k+1 and an epimorphism on pi_{k+1}.\n    conn_map = conn_fiber + 1\n    print(\"The connectivity of the map is the connectivity of its fiber + 1.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the final connectivity of the map is {conn_fiber} + 1 = {conn_map}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Final answer summary\n    print(f\"Final calculation: (conn(S^4)-1) + (conn(S^6)-1) + 2 + 1 = ({4}-1) + ({6}-1) + 2 + 1 = {3} + {5} + 2 + 1 = 9\")\n\n\nsolve_connectivity()\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"
