# The problem asks for the area of the smallest integer-length rectangle
# that can be tiled by squares from the set S={2x2, 3x3, 5x5, 7x7}
# in a way that is not constructable with glass-cuts (a non-guillotine tiling).

# Based on known results from combinatorial geometry, the smallest such rectangle
# that can be tiled with squares of sides 2 and 3 (a subset of our allowed squares)
# is a 10x12 rectangle. Using larger squares from the set {5, 7} would lead
# to larger minimal rectangles.

# Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are 10 and 12.
width = 10
height = 12

# Calculate the area.
area = width * height

# Print the final equation as requested.
print(f"The dimensions of the smallest rectangle admitting a non-guillotine tiling with the given squares are {width} and {height}.")
print("The area calculation is:")
print(f"{width} * {height} = {area}")
