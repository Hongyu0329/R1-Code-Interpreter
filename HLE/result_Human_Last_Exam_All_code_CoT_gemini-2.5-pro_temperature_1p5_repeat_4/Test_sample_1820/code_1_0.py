    Calculates the theoretical completeness bound based on the provided formula.

    In the given ontology alignment scenario, we analyze the theoretical completeness
    of a mapping between two ontologies, O_1 and O_2.
    
    O_1 has a branching factor 'b' and depth 'd'.
    O_2 has a strict categorical structure.
    
    The key challenge is that O_1 has 'mergeable' sibling classes, which conflicts
    with the 'strict' (disjoint) structure of O_2. This conflict limits the
    completeness of any mapping.
    
    Statement D suggests that the theoretical completeness is bounded by ln(b)/d.
    Let's calculate this value for the given parameters.
