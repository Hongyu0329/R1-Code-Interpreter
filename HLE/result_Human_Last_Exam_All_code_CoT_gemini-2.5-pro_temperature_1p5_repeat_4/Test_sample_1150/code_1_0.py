    Let's check Choice F against our analysis:
    - Part 1: 'x2 refers to something that is gray in color'. This aligns perfectly with our finding that x2 is derived from 'grusko' (gray).
    - Part 2: 'x3 refers to something that is in the future of x4'. This correctly associates the x3 place with the 'future' concept from 'balvi'. While the wording is a bit confusing (it describes the 'balvi' relation generally), it points to the correct component.

    No other option correctly identifies that x2 is related to 'gray' and x3 is related to 'future'. Therefore, F is the best fit.
