        'A. Transitivity': "This is the fundamental assumption that allows indirect comparisons (if A is like B, and B is like C, then an indirect A vs. C comparison is valid). It is necessary, but it's a conceptual assumption. It doesn't guarantee the statistical data will be consistent or that the studies themselves are of high quality.",
        
        'B. Consistency': "This means that evidence from direct comparisons (e.g., A vs C) and indirect comparisons (from A vs B and B vs C) agree. It's a critical check. However, you could have consistent results that are all derived from biased, low-quality studies. Thus, consistency is necessary but not sufficient.",
        
        'C. Homogeneity': "This refers to the similarity of effect sizes within studies making the same direct comparison (e.g., all A vs B trials). While important for creating reliable inputs for the network, it doesn't address the relationship between different comparisons (like consistency or transitivity).",

        'D. Similarity of Effect Modifiers': "This is the practical, clinical basis for the transitivity assumption. If effect modifiers (like patient age or disease severity) are different across studies, transitivity is violated. So, this underpins transitivity, but like transitivity, it is necessary, not sufficient, for overall validity.",

        'F. Exchangeability of treatment contrasts': "This is a statistical term, often used in Bayesian NMA, that encompasses the ideas of homogeneity and consistency. It assumes that all comparisons estimate the same underlying effects, but like the other options, it doesn't guarantee the external validity or the quality of the included studies."
