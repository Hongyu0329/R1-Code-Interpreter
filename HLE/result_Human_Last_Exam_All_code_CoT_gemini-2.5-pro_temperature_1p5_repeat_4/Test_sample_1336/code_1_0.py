    Calculates the total number of smooth coverings for PSL(2,p) with p > 5 prime.

    The problem asks for the total number of smooth coverings related to the
    quasi-simple group G = SL(2, p) and the simple group S = PSL(2, p) for p > 5 prime.
    This number can be determined from the fundamental invariants of the simple group S.
    The number of such structures is given by the product of the order of the
    Schur multiplier of S and the order of the outer automorphism group of S.
