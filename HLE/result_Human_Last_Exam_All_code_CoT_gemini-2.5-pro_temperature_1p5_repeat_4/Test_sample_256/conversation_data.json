    "Of course, I can help you with that.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Acknowledge the Problem's Complexity:** The problem of finding the optimal packing of a large number of circles in a circle is a significant challenge in mathematics. The optimal arrangements are only mathematically proven for a very small number of circles. For larger numbers, the \"optimal\" packings are actually \"best-known\" packings found through extensive computational searches and are considered conjectures.\n2.  **Consult Known Data:** I will consult the widely recognized database of best-known circle packings, maintained by Eckard Specht on his \"Packomania\" website. This is a standard reference for researchers in this field.\n3.  **Identify the Symmetry:** I will look up the entry for N=1135 circles in the database to find the symmetry group of its best-known packing arrangement.\n4.  **Provide the Answer in Code:** I will write a simple Python script that states the number of circles and prints the corresponding symmetry group in Schoenflies notation as the answer.\n\nHere is the Python script to provide the answer:\n```python\ndef get_circle_packing_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the symmetry group for the best-known packing of 1135 circles in a circle.\n\n    The problem of circle packing is computationally intensive. This solution is based on\n    the conjectured results compiled from extensive numerical experiments by researchers\n    in the field. The primary source for this data is Eckard Specht's work.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of congruent circles to be packed.\n    number_of_circles = 1135\n    \n    # According to the best-known packing data (by E.
