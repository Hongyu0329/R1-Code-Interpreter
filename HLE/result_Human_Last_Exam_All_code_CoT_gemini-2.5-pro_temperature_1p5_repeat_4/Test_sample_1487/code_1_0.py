# Based on the mathematical derivation, the expression simplifies significantly.
# The first term of the expression becomes (1024 + 1)^2.
term1 = 1025**2

# The second term of the expression is given as 10^15.
term2 = 10**15

# The final result is the sum of these two terms.
final_result = term1 + term2

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The simplified final equation is term1 + term2 = final_result.
