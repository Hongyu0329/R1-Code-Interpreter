    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the Japanese character \"謄\".\n2.  I will break it down into its constituent parts to identify the radical (bushu). The radical is the component used for classification in dictionaries.\n3.  The character 謄 is composed of 言 (gen, \"speech\") on the left and 朕 in a modified form on the right. In this structure, the left part, 言, is the radical.\n4.  When the 言 radical appears on the left side of a character, it is known as ごんべん (gonben).\n5.  I will then convert \"gonben\" into its standard Hepburn romanization.\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script that contains this information and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates finding the radical name for a given kanji.\n    It uses a predefined dictionary to store the information.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping specific kanji to the Hepburn romanization of their radical's name.\n    kanji_radical_map = {\n        '謄': 'Gonben',\n        '媛': 'Onnahen',\n        '校': 'Kihen'\n    }\n\n    # The target character.\n    character = '謄'\n\n    # Retrieve and print the radical name.\n    if character in kanji_radical_map:\n        radical_name = kanji_radical_map[character]\n        print(f\"The bushu/radical for the character '{character}' is called: {radical_name}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Radical information for '{character}' not found.\")\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
