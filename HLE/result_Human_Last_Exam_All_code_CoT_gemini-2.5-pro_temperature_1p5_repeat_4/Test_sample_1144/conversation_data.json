    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum (Δp) to its actual momentum (p) in the first Bohr orbit, which can be written as (Δp / p).\n\n2.  **Calculate Momentum Uncertainty (Δp):** We'll use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is at least h / (4π). We'll use the minimum uncertainty for our calculation:\n    Δp = h / (4π * Δx)\n\n3.  **Calculate Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit (p):** According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) is quantized: L = n * h / (2π). For the first orbit, n=1. We also know that L = p * r, where r is the orbital radius. For the first orbit, the radius (r₁) is the Bohr radius (a₀). Therefore, the momentum (p) is:\n    p = h / (2π * r₁) = h / (2π * a₀)\n\n4.  **Determine the Ratio (Δp / p):** We will now divide the expression for Δp by the expression for p:\n    Ratio = [h / (4π * Δx)] / [h / (2π * a₀)]\n    By simplifying this expression, we get a much cleaner formula:\n    Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Value:** We will substitute the known values into the simplified formula to get the final numerical answer.\n    *   Bohr radius (a₀) ≈ 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n    *   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m\n\nNow, here is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron\n    to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Constants and given values\n    # Bohr radius (a₀) in meters\n    a0 = 5.29177210903e-11\n    # Given uncertainty in position in picometers\n    delta_x_pm = 10\n    # Convert pm to meters (1 pm = 1e-12 m)\n    delta_x_m = delta_x_pm * 1e-12\n\n    # The ratio Δp/p simplifies to a₀ / (2 * Δx)\n    ratio = a0 / (2 * delta_x_m)\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the ratio of momentum uncertainty to momentum (Δp/p) for an electron in the first Bohr orbit.\")\n    print(\"The simplified formula used is: a₀ / (2 * Δx)\\n\")\n    print(f\"Values used:\")\n    print(f\"Bohr radius (a₀) = {a0:.5e} m\")\n    print(f\"Uncertainty in position (Δx) = {delta_x_pm} pm = {delta_x_m:.5e} m\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Final Equation with values:\")\n    # Using f-string formatting to display the equation with numbers\n    print(f\"Ratio = {a0} / (2 * {delta_x_m})\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nResult:\")\n    print(f\"The ratio Δp / p is: {ratio}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_momentum_ratio()\n```\n<<<2.645886054515>>>"
