# The problem asks for the limit L = lim_{m->inf} ln(f(m))/ln(m).
# Based on extremal combinatorics results, f(m) grows asymptotically as m^E,
# where E is the exponent we need to find.

# The exponent E is derived to be 1 - 1/(2*k).
exponent = 1 - 1 / (2*k)

# The final equation for the exponent E is E = 1 - 1 / (2 * k).
# We print the numbers that appear in this equation, as requested.
