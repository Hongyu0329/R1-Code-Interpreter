    This function predicts the product ratio for the thermal electrocyclization
    of (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.

    The reaction produces two isomers:
    - Product A: cis-isomer, formed via a sterically favored but electronically "forbidden" disrotatory path.
    - Product B: trans-isomer, formed via an electronically "allowed" but sterically hindered conrotatory path.

    The steric strain that makes the forbidden path competitive comes from the Z-bonds.
    We hypothesize the product ratio is determined by the count of Z versus E bonds.
