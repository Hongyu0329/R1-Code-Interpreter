# This script calculates the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks for a specific Lagrangian submanifold.
# The calculation is based on established theorems in symplectic geometry.

# 1. The base object: The Chekanov torus in the complex 2-dimensional projective space (CP^2).
# The number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks is given by the terms in its superpotential.
# For the Chekanov torus, the superpotential is W = x + y + q/(x*y), where q is a parameter.
# This potential has three distinct terms, each with a coefficient of 1.
# Each term corresponds to a family of Maslov 2 disks.
num_disks_family_1 = 1
num_disks_family_2 = 1
num_disks_family_3 = 1

# 2. The geometric construction: Iterated monotone Biran circle bundle lift.
# This construction lifts the Lagrangian from CP^n to CP^(n+1).
# The problem involves a two-step iteration: CP^2 -> CP^3 -> CP^4.

# 3. The key theorem: Invariance of the superpotential.
# According to results in Fukaya category theory, the superpotential is an invariant under
# the Biran lift for this class of Lagrangians.
# Therefore, the number of Maslov 2 disks does not change after the two lifts.

# 4. Final Calculation.
# The number of disks for the final object in CP^4 is the sum of disks from the base object.
total_maslov_2_disks = num_disks_family_1 + num_disks_family_2 + num_disks_family_3
