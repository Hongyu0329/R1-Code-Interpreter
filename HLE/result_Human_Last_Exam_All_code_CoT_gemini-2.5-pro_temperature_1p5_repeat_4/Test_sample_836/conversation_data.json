    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function (or more accurately, the neutron density covariance function) is commonly called the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** in the nuclear criticality community.\n\nFor a point reactor model, which neglects spatial effects, the shape of the PSD is determined by the square of the modulus of the reactor transfer function, $|G(\\omega)|^2$. The reactor transfer function, $G(\\omega)$, relates the neutron population response to a sinusoidal reactivity perturbation at an angular frequency $\\omega$. Its formula, based on the point kinetics equations with M groups of delayed neutrons, is:\n\n$G(\\omega) = \\frac{\\Lambda}{Z(\\omega)}$\n\nwhere the denominator, $Z(\\omega)$, is given by:\n\n$Z(\\omega) = i\\omega\\Lambda - \\rho + \\sum_{j=1}^{M} \\frac{i\\omega\\beta_j}{i\\omega + \\lambda_j}$\n\nHere is the key to the parameters:\n-   $\\omega$: Angular frequency (radians/second)\n-   $\\rho$: Reactivity (dimensionless, positive for supercritical, negative for subcritical)\n-   $\\Lambda$: Prompt neutron generation time (seconds)\n-   $\\beta_j$: Delayed neutron fraction for precursor group j\n-   $\\lambda_j$: Decay constant for precursor group j (s⁻¹)\n-   $M$: Total number of delayed neutron groups\n-   $i$: The imaginary unit, $\\sqrt{-1}$\n\nThe following Python code calculates the value of $|G(\\omega)|^2$ for a given set of reactor parameters. It explicitly prints each numerical component of the calculation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_psd_shape():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the shape of the Power Spectral Density (PSD) for a point reactor.\n    \n    The PSD shape is given by the square of the modulus of the reactor transfer\n    function, |G(w)|^2.
