# Step 1: Define the constants from the problem.
# C_n is the free product of 50 copies of B_n.
k = 50
# The constraint on the number of generators for C_n.
d_max = 100

# Step 2: Formulate the equation for d(C_n).
# According to Grushko's Theorem, for a free product G = H_1 * ... * H_k,
# d(G) = d(H_1) + ... + d(H_k).
# Since C_n is a free product of k=50 identical groups B_n, we have:
# d(C_n) = k * d(B_n)

# Step 3: Formulate the equation for d(B_n).
# B_n is the direct power of n copies of A, the alternating group A_5. So B_n = A_5^n.
# A_5 is a finite, perfect, 2-generated group.
# For such a group G, a known result states d(G^n) = n + 1 for n >= 1.
# Therefore, d(B_n) = n + 1.

# Step 4: Combine the formulas and solve the inequality.
# Substituting d(B_n) = n + 1 into the expression for d(C_n), we get:
# d(C_n) = k * (n + 1)
# The problem requires d(C_n) <= d_max, which gives the inequality:
# k * (n + 1) <= d_max

# To find the largest integer n, we solve for n at the boundary condition:
# k * (n + 1) = d_max
# We will print out the numbers in this final equation.
print(f"The problem reduces to finding the largest integer n that satisfies the inequality:")
print(f"{k} * (n + 1) <= {d_max}")

print(f"\nTo find the maximum value of n, we solve the boundary equation:")
print(f"{k} * (n + 1) = {d_max}")

# Solve for n algebraically
# n + 1 = d_max / k
# n = (d_max / k) - 1
n = (d_max / k) - 1

# The value of n must be an integer. Since n <= 1, the largest integer n is 1.
