    "To find the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th $K$-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is nonzero, we need to analyze the structure of the algebraic K-groups $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/m)$ for $m=27$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Identify the ring and its parameters. We are working with $R = \\mathbb{Z}/27 = \\mathbb{Z}/3^3$. This is a ring of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ with $p=3$ and $k=3$.\n2.  Find a relevant theorem describing the K-groups of such rings. The higher K-groups of $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$ were computed by Hesselholt and Madsen. A key paper by Geisser and Hesselholt provides vanishing and non-vanishing results for the even K-groups, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$.\n3.  Apply the theorem to our specific case ($p=3, k=3$). The theorem gives a threshold $N$ such that for $n \\ge N$, the group $K_{2n}$ is zero. This will give us an upper bound on the possible values of $n$.\n4.  Use the non-vanishing part of the same theorem to show that the K-group for the largest possible $n$ (found in the previous step) is indeed non-zero.\n5.  Combine the results to find the definitive largest $n$.\n\nThe following Python script will carry out these steps and print the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_k_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the largest natural number n such that the (2n)-th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the parameters of the ring Z/27\n    m = 27\n    # We recognize that 27 is a prime power: 27 = 3^3.\n    p = 3\n    k = 3\n    \n    print(f\"The problem asks for the largest natural number n such that K_{{2n}}(Z/{m}) is nonzero.\")\n    print(f\"The ring is Z/{m} = Z/{p}^{k}, so we have p = {p} and k = {k}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: State the relevant theorem\n    print(\"We use a theorem by Geisser and Hesselholt (2004) concerning the K-groups of rings of Witt vectors.\")\n    print(f\"The ring Z/{p}^{k} is isomorphic to the ring of Witt vectors W_{k}(F_{p}).\")\n    print(\"The theorem has two parts:\")\n    print(\" (i) Vanishing result: K_{{2n}}(Z/p^k) = 0 for n >= k*p / (p-1).\")\n    print(\" (ii) Non-vanishing result: K_{{2n}}(Z/p^k) is non-zero if 0 < n < k*p / (p-1) and n is not a multiple of p.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Apply the vanishing result to get an upper bound for n\n    print(\"Part 1: Finding the upper bound for n.\")\n    vanishing_threshold_numerator = k * p\n    vanishing_threshold_denominator = p - 1\n    vanishing_threshold = vanishing_threshold_numerator / vanishing_threshold_denominator\n    \n    print(f\"Calculating the vanishing threshold: n >= (k * p) / (p - 1)\")\n    print(f\"n >= ({k} * {p}) / ({p} - 1) = {vanishing_threshold_numerator} / {vanishing_threshold_denominator} = {vanishing_threshold}\")\n    \n    # The smallest integer n satisfying n >= 4.5 is 5.\n    n_vanish_start = math.ceil(vanishing_threshold)\n    \n    print(f\"So, for n >= {n_vanish_start}, the group K_{{2n}}(Z/{m}) is zero.\")\n    print(f\"This means the largest possible n for a non-zero group must be less than {n_vanish_start}.\")\n    print(f\"The largest possible integer value for n is {n_vanish_start - 1}.\")\n    largest_possible_n = n_vanish_start - 1\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Apply the non-vanishing result to confirm the upper bound is achieved\n    print(\"Part 2: Checking if the group is non-zero for n = 4.\")\n    # The non-vanishing condition is the same threshold, but with a strict inequality\n    # and an additional condition on divisibility by p.\n    non_vanishing_limit = vanishing_threshold\n    \n    print(f\"The non-vanishing theorem applies to integers n such that 0 < n < {non_vanishing_limit} and n is not divisible by p={p}.\")\n    \n    # We check if n=4 satisfies these conditions.\n    n_to_check = largest_possible_n\n    is_in_range = 0 < n_to_check < non_vanishing_limit\n    is_not_multiple_of_p = (n_to_check % p) != 0\n\n    print(f\"Let's check for n = {n_to_check}:\")\n    print(f\"  Is 0 < {n_to_check} < {non_vanishing_limit}? {is_in_range}.\")\n    print(f\"  Is {n_to_check} a multiple of p={p}? {'Yes' if not is_not_multiple_of_p else 'No'}.\")\n\n    if is_in_range and is_not_multiple_of_p:\n        print(f\"Since both conditions are met for n = {n_to_check}, the theorem guarantees that K_{{2 * {n_to_check}}}(Z/{m}) = K_{{8}}(Z/{m}) is non-zero.\")\n    else:\n         print(f\"The theorem does not guarantee non-vanishing for n = {n_to_check}.
