The nonabelian filled groups of order $2q^m$ for an odd prime $q$ and natural number $m$ are the generalized dihedral groups $\text{Dih}(A)$, where $A$ is an abelian group of order $q^m$. The isomorphism classes of these groups are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of $m$, which determine the structure of the abelian group $A$.
