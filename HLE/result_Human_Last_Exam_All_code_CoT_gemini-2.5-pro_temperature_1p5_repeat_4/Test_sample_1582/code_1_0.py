    Analyzes the recurrence property of a Markov chain based on a Lyapunov-like function.

    The user's question is:
    Given an irreducible Markov chain with a non-negative function f such that:
    1. For x outside a finite set A, the expected change in f, E[f(X_1)|X_0=x] - f(x), is non-negative.
    2. f(x) -> infinity as x -> infinity.
    Can we conclude the chain is not positive recurrent?

    This script illustrates that the answer is "Yes" using a concrete example.

    # At state 0, we have p(0, 1) = 1 (a reflecting barrier).
    # This chain is:
    # - Positive recurrent if p < 0.5
    # - Null recurrent if p = 0.5

    # We choose p = 0.5, which makes the chain null recurrent (and therefore not positive recurrent).
