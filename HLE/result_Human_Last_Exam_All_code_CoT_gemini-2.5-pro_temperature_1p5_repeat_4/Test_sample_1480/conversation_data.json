    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm operation, we need to apply the chosen t-norm to the given values. A t-norm is a function that models the fuzzy logical AND. The most commonly used t-norm is the minimum operator, which I will use for this calculation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Define the variables for the antecedent firing level, `Phi_k(x′)`, and the consequent membership degree, `μG_k_j(y_j)`.\n2.  Assign the given values, 0.7 and 0.9, to these variables.\n3.  Apply the minimum t-norm (`min()`) to these two values to find the rule activation level.\n4.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_activation_level():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rule activation level for an interval type-3 fuzzy set\n    using a minimum t-norm operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values\n    phi_k = 0.7  # Antecedent firing level\n    mu_g = 0.9   # Consequent membership degree\n\n    # The rule activation level is calculated using a t-norm.\n    # The minimum operator is a common t-norm.\n    # Activation Level = t-norm(phi_k, mu_g)\n    activation_level = min(phi_k, mu_g)\n\n    # Print the equation and the result\n    print(\"The rule activation level is determined by applying a t-norm (minimum) to the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership degree.\")\n    print(f\"Rule Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\n    print(f\"Rule Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_g}) = {activation_level}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_activation_level()\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
