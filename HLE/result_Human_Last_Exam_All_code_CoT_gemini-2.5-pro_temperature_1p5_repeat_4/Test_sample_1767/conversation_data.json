    "When two topological materials are brought into contact, the topological invariant of the combined system is the sum of the invariants of the individual components. In this case, we have two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1.\n\nThe Chern number of the junction, `C_junction`, is therefore the sum of the individual Chern numbers, `C1` and `C2`.\n\n*   Chern number of the first insulator, `C1 = 1`.\n*   Chern number of the second insulator, `C2 = 1`.\n\nThe total Chern number is `C_junction = C1 + C2`.\n\nThis means that on the outer edge of the combined system, there will be two co-propagating chiral edge modes, which is the physical signature of a system with a Chern number of 2. The counter-propagating modes at the interface between the two materials will gap out due to the negligible tunneling barrier, leaving the interface insulating.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate and display this result.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers of the two individual insulators.\nC1 = 1\nC2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of a junction of two topological systems is the\n# sum of their individual Chern numbers.\nC_junction = C1 + C2\n\n# Print the calculation and the final result.\n# The final equation shows each number involved in the sum.\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is C_junction = C1 + C2 = {C1} + {C2} = {C_junction}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
