    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Character**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1\\chi_2\\cdots\\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$ and $d = p_1^{a_1}\\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is the prime factorization of $d$.\n\nThe character $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $d$ if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{a_i}$. The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of its components.\n\n**2. Factor the Conductor**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d=53599$.\n$d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nSince $d$ is square-free (all exponents are 1), a character $\\chi = \\chi_7\\chi_{13}\\chi_{19}\\chi_{31}$ is primitive if and only if each component $\\chi_p$ is non-principal (i.e., has an order greater than 1).\n\n**3. Set up the Counting Problem**\n\nWe need to find the number of tuples of non-principal characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that their orders $(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31})$ satisfy:\n$\\operatorname{lcm}(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31}) = 6$.\n\nFor each prime factor $p$, the group of characters modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $m$ is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(m)$, provided that $m$ divides $p-1$.\n\n**4. Apply Inclusion-Exclusion**\n\nTo find the number of tuples whose orders' LCM is exactly 6, we can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. The final number is:\n(Number of tuples where LCM divides 6) - (Number of tuples where LCM divides 3) - (Number of tuples where LCM divides 2).\n\n*   **Tuples where LCM divides 6:** For each prime factor $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, the orders of its characters must divide 6. The possible non-principal orders are 2, 3, and 6. For each of these primes, $p-1$ is divisible by 6, so characters of these orders exist. The number of characters for each prime is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$. The total number of such tuples is $5^4$.\n\n*   **Tuples where LCM divides 3:** The order of each character must divide 3. The only non-principal option is order 3. The number of characters of order 3 is $\\phi(3)=2$. The total number of such tuples is $2^4$.\n\n*   **Tuples where LCM divides 2:** The order of each character must divide 2. The only non-principal option is order 2. The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. The total number of such tuples is $1^4$.\n\nThe final result is $5^4 - 2^4 - 1^4$. The following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    for p in prime_factorization(n):\n        result -= result // p\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given\n    conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    order_k = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order k = {d_factors}.\")\n    \n    d_factors = prime_factorization(d)\n    primes = list(d_factors.keys())\n    print(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of d = {d} is { ' * '.join(map(str, primes)) }.\")\n    print(\"Since d is square-free, a character is primitive if and only if its components are non-principal (order > 1).\")\n    print(f\"We need to find combinations of characters where the LCM of their orders is {order_k}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\")\n    print(\"Result = (count where lcm divides 6) - (count where lcm divides 3) - (count where lcm divides 2)\\n\")\n\n    # --- Calculate total where LCM divides 6 ---\n    phi_2 = phi(2)\n    phi_3 = phi(3)\n    phi_6 = phi(6)\n    num_per_prime_div6 = phi_2 + phi_3 + phi_6\n    total_div6 = num_per_prime_div6 ** len(primes)\n    \n    print(\"Calculation for tuples where LCM divides 6:\")\n    print(f\"  For each prime factor p, the number of primitive characters with order dividing 6 is:\")\n    print(f\"  phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6) = {phi_2} + {phi_3} + {phi_6} = {num_per_prime_div6}\")\n    print(f\"  Total number of combinations = {num_per_prime_div6}^{len(primes)} = {total_div6}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Calculate total where LCM divides 3 ---\n    num_per_prime_div3 = phi(3)\n    total_div3 = num_per_prime_div3 ** len(primes)\n    \n    print(\"Calculation for tuples where LCM divides 3:\")\n    print(f\"  For each prime factor p, the number of primitive characters with order dividing 3 is:\")\n    print(f\"  phi(3) = {phi_3}\")\n    print(f\"  Total number of combinations = {num_per_prime_div3}^{len(primes)} = {total_div3}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Calculate total where LCM divides 2 ---\n    num_per_prime_div2 = phi(2)\n    total_div2 = num_per_prime_div2 ** len(primes)\n    \n    print(\"Calculation for tuples where LCM divides 2:\")\n    print(f\"  For each prime factor p, the number of primitive characters with order dividing 2 is:\")\n    print(f\"  phi(2) = {phi_2}\")\n    print(f\"  Total number of combinations = {num_per_prime_div2}^{len(primes)} = {total_div2}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Final Calculation ---\n    final_result = total_div6 - total_div3 - total_div2\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Final Calculation\")\n    print(\"The total number of primitive characters of order 6 is:\")\n    print(f\"   ({num_per_prime_div6}^{len(primes)}) - ({num_per_prime_div3}^{len(primes)}) - ({num_per_prime_div2}^{len(primes)})\")\n    print(f\"=  {total_div6} - {total_div3} - {total_div2}\")\n    print(f\"=  {final_result}\")\n    \n    return final_result\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve()\n\n```\n<<<608>>>"
