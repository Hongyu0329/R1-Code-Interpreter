print("The most fundamental technical difference is the placement of the hips.")
print("In the Vaganova method, the dancer must maintain square hips, keeping both hip points facing forward to isolate the bend in the upper and middle back.")
print("In contrast, the Balanchine method allows the hip of the supporting leg to push forward while the other hip lifts and opens. This creates a more dynamic, larger, and spiral-shaped backbend.")
print("This core difference in hip placement is what dictates the other differences, such as the degree of the backbend and the subsequent placement of the upper body and head.")
