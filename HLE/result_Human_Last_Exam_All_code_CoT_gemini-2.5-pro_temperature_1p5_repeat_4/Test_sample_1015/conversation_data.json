    "My plan is to first analyze the core differences between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods for a cambré derrière based on the provided options. Then, I will create a Python script to programmatically evaluate these options. The script will assign a \"significance score\" to each factor (Arm placement, Hip placement, Speed, etc.) to quantify how fundamental the difference is. The script will then print these scores and identify the factor with the highest score as the most critical distinction, thereby providing a clear, reasoned answer in the required code format.\n\n```python\n# Ballet Method Analysis: Cambré Derrière\n\n# The key differences between Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière\n# can be ranked by their foundational importance to the technique.\n# We'll assign a \"significance score\" out of 10 to each option to represent this.\n\ndifferences = {\n    'A': {'name': 'Arm placement during allongé', 'score': 6},\n    'B': {'name': 'Placement of hip', 'score': 10},\n    'C': {'name': 'Speed', 'score': 4},\n    'D': {'name': 'Degree of backbend', 'score': 7},\n    'E': {'name': 'Placement of head', 'score': 5}\n}\n\nmax_score = 0\nbest_option_key = ''\n\nprint(\"Analyzing the primary difference between Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière:\\n\")\n\n# Here is the \"equation\" part of the response, showing each option's score.\nprint(\"--- Significance Score Equation ---\")\nfor key, value in differences.items():\n    # This line prints out each number in our evaluation \"equation\"\n    print(f\"Score for Option {key} ({value['name']}) = {value['score']}\")\n    if value['score'] > max_score:\n        max_score = value['score']\n        best_option_key = key\nprint(\"---------------------------------\\n\")\n\nprint(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\nprint(f\"The factor with the highest significance score is Option {best_option_key} with a score of {max_score}.\")\nprint(\"\\nExplanation:\")\nprint(\"The most fundamental technical difference is the placement of the hips.\")\nprint(\"In the Vaganova method, the dancer must maintain square hips, keeping both hip points facing forward to isolate the bend in the upper and middle back.\")\nprint(\"In contrast, the Balanchine method allows the hip of the supporting leg to push forward while the other hip lifts and opens. This creates a more dynamic, larger, and spiral-shaped backbend.\")\nprint(\"This core difference in hip placement is what dictates the other differences, such as the degree of the backbend and the subsequent placement of the upper body and head.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods? \n\nAnswer Choices:\nA.
