    Analyzes explanations for the trend of university entrants in Japan and identifies the incorrect ones.

    The task is to identify incorrect or inappropriate explanations for the increasing number of university entrants in Japan,
    despite a declining birthrate.

    A. The decrease in the 18-year-old population was smaller than predicted: This is factually incorrect.
       The decline was significant and widely predicted.
    B. Increase in university enrollment rate: This is correct. The rate has steadily increased, offsetting the population decline.
    C. Increased demand for re-learning by working adults: This is a correct, contributing factor.
    D. Diversification of higher education (as prep schools): This is inappropriate. The role of two-year colleges has diminished,
       not grown to push up four-year university entrant numbers.
    E. Government policies: This is correct. Deregulation eased the establishment of new universities.

    Therefore, the incorrect or inappropriate options are A and D.
