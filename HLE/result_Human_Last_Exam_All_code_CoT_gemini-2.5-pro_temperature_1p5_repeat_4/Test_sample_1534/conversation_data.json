    "This is a question about cephalopod neuroanatomy. To answer it using a script, I will first create a simple data model in Python representing the spatial relationships of key lobes in the cuttlefish brain. Then, I will write code to query this model and print the names of the regions located posterior to the palliovisceral lobe.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function models and queries the spatial relationships in a cuttlefish brain\n    to find regions posterior to the palliovisceral lobe.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A simplified model of the cuttlefish subesophageal brain mass.\n    # Data is based on neuroanatomical studies of cephalopods.\n    cuttlefish_brain_map = {\n        'palliovisceral_lobe': {\n            'description': 'A large median lobe in the posterior subesophageal mass controlling visceral organs and the mantle.',\n            'adjacent_posteriorly': ['giant fibre lobes', 'fin lobes']\n        },\n        'anterior_pedal_lobe': {\n            'description': 'Controls the arms and their suckers.',\n            'adjacent_posteriorly': ['posterior_pedal_lobe']\n        },\n        'posterior_pedal_lobe': {\n            'description': 'Controls the funnel for jet propulsion.',\n            'adjacent_posteriorly': ['palliovisceral_lobe']\n        }\n    }\n\n    # The specific lobe we are interested in.\n    target_lobe = 'palliovisceral_lobe'\n\n    # Retrieve the list of posteriorly adjacent lobes.\n    if target_lobe in cuttlefish_brain_map:\n        posterior_regions = cuttlefish_brain_map[target_lobe].get('adjacent_posteriorly', [])\n        if posterior_regions:\n            # Format the output for clear reading.\n            regions_text = ' and '.join(f\"'{region}'\" for region in posterior_regions)\n            print(f\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the '{target_lobe}' are the {regions_text}.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"No posterior adjacent regions are listed for the '{target_lobe}'.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The lobe '{target_lobe}' was not found in the brain map.\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer.\nget_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the giant fibre lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
