   - The poem describes a male figure in a dark, lonely place ('half-dark', 'underworld').
   - He is pining for a 'girl' associated with 'light' and the 'sun' who left 'to tease the soil'.
   - This is a clear reference to the Greek myth of Hades and Persephone. The girl is Persephone, goddess of spring, and the man left in the underworld is Hades."""

    setting_reasoning = """2. Identify the Setting:
   - The setting is described with modern details like a 'jukebox' and 'closing time'.
   - The imagery of men who 'spin jukebox coins on graves' and 'hawk and spit' strongly suggests a gritty, desolate Bar.
   - This modern bar serves as a metaphor for the mythological underworld."""

    form_reasoning = """3. Identify the Form:
   - A sonnet is a 14-line poem, and this poem has 12 lines.
   - However, it is written in iambic pentameter, which is the traditional meter for a sonnet.
   - Among the answer choices, the options that correctly identify the character as Hades all list the form as 'sonnet'.
   - This implies that 'sonnet' is the intended answer, representing a modern or variation of the form."""
