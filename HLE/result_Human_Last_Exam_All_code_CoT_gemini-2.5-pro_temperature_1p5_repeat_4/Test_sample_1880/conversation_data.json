    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: We first verify that the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. A common method for this is Eisenstein's criterion.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant of the polynomial will help narrow down the possible Galois groups. If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number, the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Find the Resolvent Cubic**: The resolvent cubic is an associated third-degree polynomial whose factorization properties determine the structure of the Galois group.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: We check if the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. If it is, the Galois group is smaller than $S_4$.\n5.  **Distinguish Between Remaining Possibilities**: Based on the reducibility of the resolvent cubic, we will be left with a few possible groups (in this case, $D_4$ or $C_4$). A final test involving the reducibility of the original polynomial over an extension field related to the discriminant will give us the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and determine the order of the Galois group.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to get all integer divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    n = abs(n)\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(-i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n            divs.add(-(n // i))\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + qx + r\n    q = 8\n    r = 14\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility using Eisenstein's criterion.\n    # The prime p=2 divides q=8 and r=14. p=2 does not divide the leading coefficient (1).\n    # p^2=4 does not divide the constant term r=14.\n    # Thus, f(x) is irreducible over Q.\n    print(\"Step 1: Irreducibility Check\")\n    print(\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with prime p=2:\")\n    print(\" - p=2 divides the coefficient of x (8) and the constant term (14).\")\n    print(\" - p=2 does not divide the leading coefficient (1).\")\n    print(\" - p^2=4 does not divide the constant term (14).\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers Q.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the discriminant of the quartic.\n    # For x^4 + qx + r, the discriminant is Delta = -27*q^4 + 256*r^3.\n    delta = -27 * (q**4) + 256 * (r**3)\n    print(\"Step 2: Discriminant Calculation\")\n    print(f\"The formula for the discriminant is Delta = -27 * q^4 + 256 * r^3\")\n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * ({q}^4) + 256 * ({r}^3) = {delta}\")\n    \n    sqrt_delta_int = math.isqrt(delta)\n    if sqrt_delta_int**2 == delta:\n        print(\"The discriminant is a perfect square.
