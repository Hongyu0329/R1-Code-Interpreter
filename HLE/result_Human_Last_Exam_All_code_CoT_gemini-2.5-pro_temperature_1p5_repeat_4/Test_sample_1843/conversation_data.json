    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ with a specific conductor $N=36036$ and order 6.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Factorize the Conductor**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N = 36036$.\n2.  **Decomposition of Characters**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1^{a_1}} \\chi_{p_2^{a_2}} \\cdots \\chi_{p_k^{a_k}}$, where $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ is the prime factorization of $N$ and each $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n3.  **Condition for Primitivity**: A character $\\chi$ is primitive with conductor $N$ if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p_i^{a_i}}$ is primitive for its respective modulus $p_i^{a_i}$.\n4.  **Condition on the Order**: The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_1^{a_1}}), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p_k^{a_k}}))$. We are given that this order must be 6.\n5.  **Counting for Each Factor**: For each prime-power factor $q=p^a$ of $N$, we will:\n    a. Determine the possible orders of primitive characters modulo $q$.\n    b. Count how many of these characters have an order that is a divisor of 6. This is a necessary condition for the final lcm to be 6.\n6.  **Combining the Counts**:\n    a. We multiply the number of choices for each component character to get the total number of characters where each component's order divides 6.\n    b. We then verify that for any such combination, the lcm of the orders is guaranteed to be exactly 6. This involves checking if the lcm will always contain the necessary prime factors (2 and 3).\n\nThe following Python script will carry out these calculations and print the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # A simple implementation is sufficient for the numbers in this problem\n    if n == 2: return 1\n    if n == 3: return 2\n    if n == 4: return 2\n    if n == 5: return 4\n    if n == 6: return 2\n    if n == 7: return 6\n    if n == 9: return 6\n    if n == 11: return 10\n    if n == 13: return 12\n    # Fallback for other numbers\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    result = n\n    for p in factors:\n        result -= result // p\n    return result\n\n# Main logic\nN = 36036\nprint(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order 6.\")\nprint(\"\\nStep 1: Find the prime factorization of N.\")\nfactors = get_prime_factorization(N)\nfactor_str = \" * \".join([f\"{p}^{a}\" for p, a in factors.items()])\nprint(f\"The prime factorization of {N} is: {factor_str}\")\nprint(\"A character mod N is primitive if and only if it is a product of primitive characters for each prime power factor.\")\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: For each prime power factor, count the number of primitive characters whose order divides 6.\")\n\n# Factor q = 4 = 2^2\nq4 = 4\nprint(f\"\\nFor q = {q4}:\")\nprint(f\"The group of characters mod {q4} has order phi({q4}) = {phi(q4)}.\")\nprint(f\"There is 1 primitive character modulo {q4}, and its order is 2.\")\nprint(\"Since 2 divides 6, this is a valid choice.\")\ncount_4 = 1\nprint(f\"Number of choices for characters mod {q4}: {count_4}\")\n\n# Factor q = 9 = 3^2\nq9 = 9\nprint(f\"\\nFor q = {q9}:\")\nprint(f\"The group of characters mod {q9} is cyclic of order phi({q9}) = {phi(q9)}.\")\nprint(\"The primitive characters mod 9 have orders that divide 6 but not phi(3)=2.
