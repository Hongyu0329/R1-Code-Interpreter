    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to refer to the classification of finite Coxeter groups (of which Weyl groups are a subset). The classification is based on Dynkin diagrams. The rank of the group corresponds to the number of vertices in its associated diagram.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  List the families of irreducible finite Weyl groups. These are denoted by A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n, E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, and G_2.\n2.  Identify which of these families can have a rank of 4 (i.e., n=4).\n3.  The infinite families A_n, B_n, C_n, and D_n give us A_4, B_4, C_4, and D_4 for n=4. It's a key fact that the Weyl groups for B_n and C_n are isomorphic, so B_4 and C_4 represent the same group.\n4.  From the exceptional groups (E, F, G families), only F_4 has a rank of 4.\n5.  This leaves us with the groups corresponding to the Dynkin diagrams: A_4, B_4, D_4, and F_4. These four groups are non-isomorphic.\n6.  The code will list these four groups and then sum them up to find the total count.\n\n```python\ndef count_weyl_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # From the classification of finite Weyl groups, we identify those with rank 4.\n    # The rank corresponds to the subscript 'n' for the classical types A, B, C, D,\n    # and is fixed for the exceptional types.\n    #\n    # 1. Type A_n: For rank 4, we have A_4.\n    # 2. Type B_n / C_n: For rank 4, we have B_4. (W(B_n) is isomorphic to W(C_n)).\n    # 3. Type D_n: For rank 4, we have D_4.\n    # 4.
