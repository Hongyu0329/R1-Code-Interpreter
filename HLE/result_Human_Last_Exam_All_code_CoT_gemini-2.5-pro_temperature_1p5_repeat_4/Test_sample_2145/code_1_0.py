# The four trivia answers reveal a hidden word by taking their first letters.

# 1. Slumdog Millionaire -> S
letter_1 = 'S'

# 2. Kulaks -> K
letter_2 = 'K'

# 3. Alice -> A
letter_3 = 'A'

# 4. Winnie-the-Pooh -> W
letter_4 = 'W'

# Concatenate the letters to form the hidden word
hidden_word = letter_1 + letter_2 + letter_3 + letter_4

# Print the equation as requested
print(f"{letter_1} + {letter_2} + {letter_3} + {letter_4} = {hidden_word}")
