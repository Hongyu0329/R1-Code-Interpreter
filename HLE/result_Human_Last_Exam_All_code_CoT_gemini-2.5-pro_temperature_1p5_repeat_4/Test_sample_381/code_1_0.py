    # Let's analyze the components of the expression ||B * Q_{0,M}||_inf.
    # We will use the submultiplicative property of matrix norms: ||AC|| <= ||A|| * ||C||.
    # Thus, ||B * Q_{0,M}||_inf <= ||B||_inf * ||Q_{0,M}||_inf.

    # 1. Bounding ||Q_{0,M}||_inf
    # Q_{0,M} is a product of matrices M_t = D^(t) * P^(t).
    # P^(t) is a row-stochastic matrix. The sum of absolute values of each row is 1.
    # Therefore, the infinity norm of P^(t) is 1.
    # D^(t) is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries d_i where 0 <= d_i <= 1.
    # The infinity norm of D^(t) is max(d_i), which is <= 1.
    #
    # So, for each matrix in the product:
    # ||D^(t) * P^(t)||_inf <= ||D^(t)||_inf * ||P^(t)||_inf <= 1 * 1 = 1.
    #
    # The norm of the product Q_{0,M} is:
    # ||Q_{0,M}||_inf = ||D^(M)P^(M) * ... * D^(0)P^(0)||_inf
    #                <= ||D^(M)P^(M)||_inf * ... * ||D^(0)P^(0)||_inf
    #                <= 1 * ... * 1 = 1
    # So, we have ||Q_{0,M}||_inf <= 1.

    # 2. Bounding ||B||_inf
    # B is the projection matrix onto the space orthogonal to span{1}.

    # The matrix B has diagonal elements of (1 - 1/N) and off-diagonal elements of (-1/N).
    # The infinity norm is the maximum absolute row sum.
    # For any row i, the sum of absolute values of its elements is:
    # |1 - 1/N| + (N-1) * |-1/N|
    # = (1 - 1/N) + (N-1)/N
    # = 1 - 1/N + 1 - 1/N

    # ||B * Q_{0,M}||_inf <= ||B||_inf * ||Q_{0,M}||_inf <= (2 - 2/N) * 1 <= 2.
    # The upper bound is 2.

    # The question asks for the upper-bound to be expressed as a factor of sqrt(N).
    # This means the bound is of the form K * sqrt(N).
    # Our derived upper bound is 2.
    # The inequality 2 <= K * sqrt(N) must hold for all N >= 1.
    # If we choose K=2, the inequality is 2 <= 2 * sqrt(N), which is true for all N >= 1.
    # So we can state that 2*sqrt(N) is an upper bound.
    # The corresponding factor K would be 2.

    # The final equation is ||B Q_{0,M}||_inf <= 2.
