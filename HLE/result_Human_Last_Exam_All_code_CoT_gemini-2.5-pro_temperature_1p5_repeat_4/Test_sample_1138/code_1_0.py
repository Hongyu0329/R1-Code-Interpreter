    print("Analysis: This is a general statement about the existence of certain types of broken schemes. We can easily construct one. For example, a trivial scheme where Verify(pk, m, sig) always returns true if sig == 1. An adversary can always output sig' = 1 for any message m, and it will be valid. This scheme is 'existentially forgeable' and fits the description.")
