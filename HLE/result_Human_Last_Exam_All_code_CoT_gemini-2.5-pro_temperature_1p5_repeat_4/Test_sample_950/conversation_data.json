    "To find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, we need to perform a series of calculations based on established results in algebraic topology.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the space**: The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. By a standard duality, this space is homeomorphic to the Grassmannian $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. We will use the parameters $k=2$ and $n=5$ for our calculations. The dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 2(5-2) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Find Betti numbers with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients**: We calculate the Poincaré polynomial for cohomology with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, $P_{\\mathbb{Z}_2}(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^6 d_i t^i$. The coefficients $d_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H^i(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ are given by the coefficients of the q-binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}_t$.\n\n3.  **Find Betti numbers with $\\mathbb{Q}$ coefficients**: We calculate the Poincaré polynomial for cohomology with rational coefficients, $P_{\\mathbb{Q}}(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^6 b_i t^i$. The coefficients $b_i$ are the Betti numbers, which represent the ranks of the free part of the integral cohomology groups $H^i(G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n4.  **Determine the torsion ranks**: The integral cohomology groups of real Grassmannians are of the form $H^i(G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n);\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{b_i} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_i}$, where $t_i$ is the rank of the torsion subgroup in degree $i$. The Universal Coefficient Theorem provides a relationship between $d_i$, $b_i$, and $t_i$: $d_i = b_i + t_i + t_{i+1}$. We can solve for the values of $t_i$ recursively, starting from $t_{dim+1}=0$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the total rank**: The rank of the torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is the sum of the ranks of the torsion part of each cohomology group, i.e., $\\sum_{i=0}^6 t_i$.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_cohomology_torsion_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\n    of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the space\n    # The space of 3-subspaces of R^5 is the Grassmannian G(3,5).\n    # G(k,n) is homeomorphic to G(n-k, n).
