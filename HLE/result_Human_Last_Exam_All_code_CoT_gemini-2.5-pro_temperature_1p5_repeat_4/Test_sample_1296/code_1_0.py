    # Part (a): If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
    # Based on the definition of a quasiprimitive action on the face set F, the socle N must be
    # transitive on F. The faces of the quotient D_N are the orbits of N on F. Since N is
    # transitive, there is only one orbit, making D_N unicellular.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # Part (b): Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism group
    # of D if D is a smooth covering of a unicellular dessin.
    # The conditions describe a regular dessin with a group G that acts quasiprimitively on faces
    # and satisfies the smooth covering condition. Examples of such dessins and groups are known
    # to exist for all three O'Nan-Scott types listed.
    answer_b = "HA, TW, AS"

    # Part (c): True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a smooth
    # covering of D_N.
    # A known theorem in the theory of regular maps states that for a group of type TW
    # (G = T wr Z_l), a smooth covering is only possible if l is a prime and l >= 7.
    # Since l <= 5, the condition is not met.
