    Calculates the limit based on the analytical solution.

    The problem is to find the limit of p(N)/N as N approaches infinity, where p(N)
    is the number of integer solutions to the equation:
    F_n + a*F_m^6 + b*F_m^5 + c*F_m^4 + d*F_m^3 + e*F_m^2 + f*F_m + g = 0
    with 0 <= m,n < N and -25 <= a,b,c,d,e,f,g <= 25.

    The limit is determined by the cases where the equation becomes independent of 'm',
    which happens when the coefficients a, b, c, d, e, f are all zero. In these
    cases, the equation simplifies to F_n + g = 0. For any other choice of
    coefficients, the number of solutions (n, m) is finite, and their
    contribution to the limit is zero.

    The limit is therefore the sum of the number of solutions for 'n' to F_n = -g,
    summed over all relevant 'g' values. Since -25 <= g <= 25 and F_n >= 0,
    we only need to consider k = -g where 0 <= k <= 25.
