    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Identify the geometric shape of the \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron. The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron, and its outer-hull (or convex hull) is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  Determine the number of faces of a regular icosahedron. The number of faces corresponds to the number of visible triangles from the outside.\n3.  A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 12 vertices (V) and 30 edges (E). We can use Euler's polyhedron formula (V - E + F = 2) to calculate the number of faces (F).\n4.  Since the faces of a regular icosahedron are themselves triangles, the number of faces is the minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation.\n5.  The Python script below will perform this calculation and print the explanation along with the final equation and answer.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_icosahedron_faces():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of faces of a regular icosahedron, which corresponds to\n    the number of triangles on the outer-hull of a great icosahedron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The outer-hull (convex hull) of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n    # We need to find the number of faces of a regular icosahedron.\n\n    # Properties of a regular icosahedron:\n    num_vertices = 12  # V\n    num_edges = 30     # E\n\n    # Euler's formula for polyhedra is V - E + F = 2, where F is the number of faces.\n    # We can rearrange it to find F: F = 2 - V + E.\n    num_faces = 2 - num_vertices + num_edges\n\n    print(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\n    print(\"A regular icosahedron has {} vertices (V) and {} edges (E).\".format(num_vertices, num_edges))\n    print(\"\\nUsing Euler's formula for polyhedra (V - E + F = 2), we can find the number of faces (F).\")\n    print(\"The equation is: F = 2 - V + E\")\n    print(\"Substituting the values:\")\n    # The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.\n    print(\"F = {} - {} + {}\".format(2, num_vertices, num_edges))\n    print(\"F = {}\".format(num_faces))\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe faces of a regular icosahedron are triangles.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating its surface is equal to its number of faces.\")\n    print(\"\\nMinimal number of triangles = {}\".format(num_faces))\n\ncalculate_icosahedron_faces()\n```\n<<<20>>>"
