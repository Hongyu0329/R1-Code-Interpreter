    This function determines the correct answer to the chemistry question.

    The question asks how the dissolution of ammonium sulfate aerosol particles
    enables the sulphate-reducing ammonium oxidation reaction, which normally
    requires energy. This points to a catalytic effect specific to the
    aerosol environment.

    Let's analyze the options:
    - A, D: These are plausible but describe the phenomenon in general terms.
    - B, C: These describe aspects of dissolution but don't adequately explain how a
      large energy barrier is overcome.
    - E: This option provides the most precise chemical mechanism. The air-water
      interface of an aerosol is a unique environment where the arrangement and
      hydration of ions differ from the bulk solution. This "altered surface ion pairing"
      can lead to the formation of "transient complexes" between ammonium and sulfate.
      These complexes act as intermediates in a new reaction pathway with a "lower
      reaction energy barrier," allowing the reaction to proceed without external energy input.
      This is the most accurate and specific explanation.
