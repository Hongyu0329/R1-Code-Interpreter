    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  The initial equation of the curve is $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a model for a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. To analyze its reduction at $p=2$, it's standard practice to find a better model, especially to understand the structure at the point at infinity.\n2.  I will perform a change of variables $x' = 1/x$. This maps the point at infinity to the origin. The equation becomes singular, so I will perform another substitution to get a new equation of the form $y^2 = f(x)$ where $f(x)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients.\n3.  The new model is $Y^2 = X^6 + 2X^3 + 2X$. The stable reduction of this curve is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(X) = X^6 + 2X^3 + 2X$.\n4.  I will analyze the roots of $f(X)$. I notice that $f(X) = X(X^5 + 2X^2 + 2)$. This means one root is $X=0$. The other five roots come from the quintic factor $h(X) = X^5 + 2X^2 + 2$.\n5.  I will study the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $h(X)$ using its Newton polygon at $p=2$. This will tell me how the roots of $f(X)$ cluster together.\n6.  The roots will partition into two sets: $R_1 = \\{0\\}$ and $R_2$ being the roots of $h(X)$. This partition corresponds to a double point in the stable reduction, which connects two components.\n7.  The thickness of this double point is given by a formula involving the resultant of the polynomials corresponding to the clusters of roots. Let $f_1(X) = X$ and $f_2(X) = X^5+2X^2+2$. The thickness is related to the 2-adic valuation of the resultant of these two polynomials, $v_2(\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2))$.\n8.  The resultant $\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2)$ can be calculated as $f_2(0)$.\n9.  The thickness of the double point is an integer value, which in the context of the NÃ©ron model of the Jacobian is given by $v_2(\\text{Res}(f_1, f_2))$. I will calculate this value.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Step 1-3: Define the polynomial from the transformed curve equation\n# The original curve is z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\n# Let x = 1/X.
