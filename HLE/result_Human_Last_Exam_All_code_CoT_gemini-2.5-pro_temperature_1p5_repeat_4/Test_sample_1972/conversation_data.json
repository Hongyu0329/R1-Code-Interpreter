    "Of course. Here is my plan to find the answer:\n\n1.  I will search for the specific quote attributed to Jorge Luis Borges: \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  I will also search for authors whom Borges described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n3.  I will cross-reference the results to find the single author and novel that match both descriptions.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information and prints the answer in a clear, formatted way.\n\n```python\ndef find_borges_reference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the novel and author\n    referenced by Jorge Luis Borges with the given quotes.\n    \"\"\"\n    novel_title_original = \"El astillero\"\n    novel_title_english = \"The Shipyard\"\n    author = \"Juan Carlos Onetti\"\n    source_of_quote = \"Borges's prologue to the novel\"\n\n    print(\"The novel Jorge Luis Borges was referring to is:\")\n    print(f\"- Title: {novel_title_original} ({novel_title_english})\")\n    print(f\"- Author: {author}\")\n    print(\"\\nBorges wrote these words in his prologue for the novel, where he also described Onetti's style in relation to William Faulkner's.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_borges_reference()\n```\n<<<El astillero>>>"
