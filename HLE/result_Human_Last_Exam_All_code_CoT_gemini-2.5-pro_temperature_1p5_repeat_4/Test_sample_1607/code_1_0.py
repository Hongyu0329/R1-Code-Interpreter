  # Based on the step-by-step analysis, the following statements were found to be true:
  # B1: Scale invariance for H=T+V implies V is proportional to 1/r^2.
  # D: If [τ,H]=0, τ|ψ⟩ is an energy eigenstate if |ψ⟩ is.
  # E: With ħ=1 convention, S(θ) with τ=Lz is a rotation by angle θ.
  # F: Conservation of <τ> is equivalent to [τ,H]=0.
  # G: Unitarity of S implies τ is Hermitian.
  # I: Non-commuting generators means exponentials don't simply add.
  # J: S|ψ⟩ has the same energy as |ψ⟩ if [S,H]=0.
