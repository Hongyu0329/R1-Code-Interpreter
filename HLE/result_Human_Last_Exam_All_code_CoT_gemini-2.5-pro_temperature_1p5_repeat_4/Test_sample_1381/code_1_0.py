    Calculates the number of possible equilibria for the generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics.

    The number of equilibria is determined by the number of possible subsets of
    species that can coexist. Based on the analysis of the system, any subset of the
    N species can form an equilibrium for some choice of parameters. The total
    number of subsets of a set of N elements is 2^N.
