    "My plan is to analyze the training methodologies of the famous ballet schools listed in the options. I will identify which school is uniquely known for having its dancers conduct their barre work predominantly in pointe shoes. This practice is a key characteristic of a specific ballet technique. After determining the correct school, I will write a Python script that explains the reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_ballet_school_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballet school training methods to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following ballet schools are female dancers known to train on the barre with mostly pointe shoes?\"\n\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'La Scala',\n        'B': 'Vaganova',\n        'C': 'The Royal Ballet',\n        'D': 'School of American Ballet',\n        'E': 'Bolshoi'\n    }\n\n    # Explanation based on ballet training methodologies\n    explanation = (\n        \"The various ballet schools and their associated methods have different approaches to pointe work. \"\n        \"Most traditional methods, such as the Vaganova (used at the Bolshoi and Vaganova academies), Royal Ballet (English style), \"\n        \"and La Scala (Italian/Cecchetti), emphasize building foundational strength at the barre in soft slippers first. \"\n        \"Pointe work is typically introduced later in the class, in the center.\\n\\n\"\n        \"However, the School of American Ballet (SAB) is famously associated with the Balanchine method.
