    "My plan is to first research the plot of the 1997 movie *Ovosodo* to determine which US city the character Tommaso moves to. After confirming the city, I will create a simple Python script that stores the city's name in a variable and then uses the `print()` function to display the answer clearly.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the US city where the character Tommaso moves in the movie \"Ovosodo\".\n# Based on plot summaries of the film, Tommaso moves to California.\n\n# Store the city name in a variable.\ncity = \"San Francisco\"\n\n# Print the final answer.\nprint(f\"In the movie 'Ovosodo', the character Tommaso moves to {city}.\")\n\n```\n<<<San Francisco>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In the 1997 movie Ovosodo (Hard Boiled Egg), Tommaso – played by Marco Cocci – moves to the United States.
