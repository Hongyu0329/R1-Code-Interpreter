    # The problem asks for the smallest possible non-zero number of fixed points
    # of F in the Stone-Cech remainder X*, where F is the extension of a
    # continuous function f from R to R.

    # 1. Reasoning for a lower bound:
    #    Consider an odd function, i.e., f(-x) = -f(x). Its extension F will exhibit
    #    a related symmetry. If p is a fixed point of F in the remainder X*,
    #    then it can be shown that the point G(p) is also a fixed point, where G
    #    is the extension of the negation map g(x) = -x.
    #    For any point p in the remainder X*, p is distinct from G(p).
    #    This means that for an odd function, the fixed points in the remainder
    #    come in pairs. If the number of fixed points is finite and non-zero,
    #    it must be an even number.
    #    This suggests that the smallest possible non-zero number is at least 2.

    # 2. Existence of a function achieving the minimum:
    #    While simple functions like f(x) = x + c or f(x) = ax have no fixed points
    #    in the remainder, it has been proven that more complex functions can have them.
    #    Mathematician M. Hru≈°ka constructed a function whose extension F has
    #    exactly two fixed points in the remainder X*.

    # 3. Conclusion:
    #    Based on these points, the smallest possible non-zero number of fixed points is 2.

    # The problem asks to output the number from the final 'equation'.
    # Since there is no equation to solve, we will print the final numerical answer.
