    "For a peptide of 100 amino acids containing an unnatural amino acid (UAA), direct chemical synthesis is challenging due to the length. The most helpful and powerful technique would be **recombinant expression using an expanded genetic code**. This biosynthetic method allows for the site-specific incorporation of the UAA (in this case, azido phenylalanine) into the peptide sequence inside a host organism like *E. coli*. It requires an engineered system consisting of an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and its corresponding tRNA, which recognizes a specific codon (often a repurposed stop codon) to insert the UAA during protein translation. This approach is highly efficient for long peptides and scalable for producing larger quantities.\n\nAs for the coding task, there is no explicit request, but a common task for a peptide sequence is to calculate its molecular weight. I will write a Python script to calculate the molecular weight of the provided fragment `KAVCLXVIGATR`.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a dictionary holding the average molecular weight of each relevant amino acid. I will include a value for 'X' representing azido phenylalanine (C₉H₁₀N₄O₂), which has a molecular weight of approximately 206.21 g/mol.\n2.  Sum the molecular weights of all amino acids in the fragment `KAVCLXVIGATR`.\n3.  Calculate the total mass of water lost during the formation of peptide bonds. For a 12-amino-acid fragment, 11 peptide bonds are formed, so 11 water molecules are lost.\n4.  Subtract the total mass of water from the sum of the amino acid masses to get the final molecular weight of the peptide fragment.\n5.  Print each step of this calculation to show the final equation and its components.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_peptide_fragment_mw():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular weight of a peptide fragment and prints the detailed equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Average molecular weights of amino acids (in g/mol)\n    amino_acid_mw = {\n        'A': 89.09, 'R': 174.20, 'N': 132.12, 'D': 133.10,\n        'C': 121.16, 'Q': 146.14, 'E': 147.13, 'G': 75.07,\n        'H': 155.16, 'I': 131.17, 'L': 131.17, 'K': 146.19,\n        'M': 149.21, 'F': 165.19, 'P': 115.13, 'S': 105.09,\n        'T': 119.12, 'W': 204.23, 'Y': 181.19, 'V': 117.15,\n        'X': 206.21  # Special case for p-Azido-L-phenylalanine\n    }\n    water_mw = 18.015\n\n    sequence = \"KAVCLXVIGATR\"\n    \n    print(f\"Calculating molecular weight for the peptide fragment: {sequence}\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Sum of individual amino acid masses ---\n    total_aa_mass = 0\n    mass_equation_parts = []\n    \n    for aa in sequence:\n        mass = amino_acid_mw.get(aa.upper())\n        if mass is None:\n            print(f\"Error: Amino acid '{aa}' not found in the library.\")\n            return\n        total_aa_mass += mass\n        mass_equation_parts.append(str(mass))\n        \n    print(\"Step 1: Sum of individual amino acid masses\")\n    sum_equation = \" + \".join(mass_equation_parts)\n    print(f\"{sum_equation} = {total_aa_mass:.2f} g/mol\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate mass of water lost ---\n    num_peptide_bonds = len(sequence) - 1\n    total_water_mass = num_peptide_bonds * water_mw\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate mass of water lost from peptide bond formation\")\n    print(f\"Number of peptide bonds: {num_peptide_bonds}\")\n    print(f\"Mass of water (H2O): {water_mw} g/mol\")\n    print(f\"{num_peptide_bonds} * {water_mw} = {total_water_mass:.3f} g/mol\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Final molecular weight ---\n    final_mw = total_aa_mass - total_water_mass\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate final molecular weight of the fragment\")\n    print(\"(Total AA Mass) - (Total Water Mass)\")\n    print(f\"{total_aa_mass:.2f} - {total_water_mass:.3f} = {final_mw:.3f} g/mol\\n\")\n    print(f\"Final Molecular Weight of '{sequence}': {final_mw:.3f} g/mol\")\n\n# Execute the calculation\ncalculate_peptide_fragment_mw()\n```\n<<<Recombinant expression with genetic code expansion>>>"
