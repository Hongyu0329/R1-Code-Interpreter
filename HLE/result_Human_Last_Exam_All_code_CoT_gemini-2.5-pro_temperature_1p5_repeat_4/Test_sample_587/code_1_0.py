# This script is designed to provide the solution to the user's question.
# The user's question is a theoretical multiple-choice problem from the field of
# parameterized complexity theory.

# After a thorough analysis of all the options, the conclusion is that statement B is the correct one.
#
# A: False. Counting cliques is hard.
# B: True. This is a direct consequence of a theorem by Flum and Grohe on the complexity of #k-Clique
#    on somewhere dense graph classes.
# C: False. Graphs with degree at most 2 have bounded treewidth, making the problem FPT.
# D: False. A counterexample was constructed to show this dichotomy does not hold for all
#    somewhere dense classes.
# E: False. The class of paths provides a counterexample.
#
# The problem does not involve any numerical calculations. The code below will simply print the
# letter corresponding to the correct answer choice.
