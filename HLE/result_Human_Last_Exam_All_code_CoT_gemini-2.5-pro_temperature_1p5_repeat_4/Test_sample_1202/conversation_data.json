    "Of course. I will help you solve this problem by creating a Python script that analyzes the provided answer choices based on the criteria in the question.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will define the core requirements from the question: a mechanism must explain both the **retention** (keeping the duplicate gene) and the **divergence** (the two gene copies becoming different) of duplicate genes.\n2.  I will create a dictionary in Python to represent each answer choice. For each choice, I will store a brief explanation and assign scores for how well it promotes 'retention' (+1 for promotes, -1 for prevents/loss, 0 for neutral) and 'divergence'.\n3.  The script will then iterate through each mechanism, print its explanation, and calculate a total \"fitness\" score by adding the retention and divergence scores.\n4.  Finally, the script will identify the mechanism with the highest score as the most likely answer and print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes mechanisms for duplicate gene retention and divergence\n    to determine the most likely candidate.\n    \"\"\"\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Gene conversion',\n            'explanation': 'A process that makes two similar gene sequences identical.
