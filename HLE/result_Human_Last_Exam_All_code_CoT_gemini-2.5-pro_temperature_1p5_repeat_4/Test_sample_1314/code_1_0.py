    The "doppelgänger syndrome" is a lay term. In neuroscience and psychiatry, the
    experience of seeing one's own double is a type of autoscopic phenomenon. The delusional
    belief that a familiar person (or even oneself) has been replaced by an identical

    recognized as a primary disease/syndrome underlying the experience.
