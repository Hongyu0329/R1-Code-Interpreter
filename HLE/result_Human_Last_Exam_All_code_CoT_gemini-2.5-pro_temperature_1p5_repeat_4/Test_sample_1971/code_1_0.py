    # Part 1: Determination of beta
    # The variation of the super-cosmological constant term L_cos must vanish.
    # We analyze the terms linear in the auxiliary field S.
    # The cancellation condition for terms linear in S from delta(L_cos) is:
    # kappa * (1/2 - beta) * (fermionic_term) + (1/(4*S)) * (variation_of_Rcov_term) = 0
    # The invariance of the L_sugra action gives a relation:
    # variation_of_Rcov_term = -kappa * S * (fermionic_term)
    #
    # Substituting the second into the first gives:
    # kappa * (1/2 - beta) - kappa / 4 = 0
    # 1/2 - beta = 1/4
    # beta = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4
    beta = sympy.Rational(1, 4)

    # Part 2: Determination of alpha^2
    # The bosonic part of the potential V(S) comes from L_aux and the S-term in L_cos.
    # The Lagrangian for the scalar potential part is L_V = e * (-1/3 * S**2 + alpha * S)
    # The equation of motion for S is d(L_V)/dS = 0 (since S is non-dynamical).
    # e * (-2/3 * S + alpha) = 0  => S_0 = 3*alpha/2
    #
    # We substitute this vacuum value S_0 back into the Lagrangian L_V to get the
    # effective cosmological constant term.
    # L_V_vacuum = e * (-1/3 * (3*alpha/2)**2 + alpha * (3*alpha/2))
    #            = e * (-1/3 * 9*alpha**2/4 + 3*alpha**2/2)
    #            = e * (-3*alpha**2/4 + 6*alpha**2/4)
    #            = e * (3*alpha**2/4)
    #
    # The Einstein Field Equations derived from L_EH + L_V = e*(-R/(2*kappa**2) + L_V/e) are:
    # G_munu = kappa**2 * (L_V/e) * g_munu
    # Taking the trace of this equation (G_munu trace is -R, g_munu trace is 4):
    # -R = kappa**2 * (L_V/e) * 4
    # -R = 4 * kappa**2 * (3*alpha**2/4)
    # -R = 3 * kappa**2 * alpha**2
    #
    # Solving for alpha**2:
    # alpha**2 = -R / (3 * kappa**2)
