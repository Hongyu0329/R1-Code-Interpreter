    This function solves a topology problem by applying a known theorem.

    The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a
    compact connected metric space X, given that for some n >= 2, the space
    of n distinct points in X is disconnected.
    """

    # The value of n is given to be an integer where n >= 2.
    # The exact value of n does not alter the conclusion, as long as the condition holds for at least one such n.
    n_condition = "n >= 2"

    # Step 1: Relate the problem's condition to a property of the space X.
    # A key theorem in topology (related to the work of Fox and Fadell) states that
    # for a compact, connected metric space X, the configuration space of n distinct points,
    # F(X, n), is connected for all n >= 2 if and only if X is NOT an arc.
    # An arc is a space that is homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1].

    # Step 2: Apply the theorem to the given information.
    # The problem states that F(X, n) is DISCONNECTED for some n >= 2.
    # This is the converse of the theorem's conclusion. Therefore, the space X
    # MUST BE an arc.
    #
    # To illustrate why an arc causes disconnectedness:
    # If X = [0, 1], we can map any tuple (x_1, ..., x_n) of distinct points
    # to the permutation that sorts them. For example, (0.5, 0.2) maps to the
    # permutation for (x_2, x_1). This mapping is continuous from F(X, n) to
    # the discrete space of permutations. Since the image is disconnected, the domain F(X, n) must be disconnected.

    # Step 3: Count the number of homeomorphism classes.
    # The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for X.
    # We have established that X must be an arc. By definition, any space
    # that is an arc is homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1].
    # This means that all possible spaces X that satisfy the condition belong
    # to a single homeomorphism class.

    number_of_classes = 1

    # Step 4: Print the final conclusion, showing the reasoning.
    print(f"The problem states that for a compact connected metric space X and for some integer {n_condition}, the configuration space of distinct points is disconnected.")
    print("A known theorem states this condition holds if and only if the space X is an arc (i.e., homeomorphic to [0, 1]).")
