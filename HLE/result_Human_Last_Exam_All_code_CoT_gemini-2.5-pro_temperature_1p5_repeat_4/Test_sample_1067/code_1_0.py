    # According to the "verifiable proof":
    P = True  # P: The dog detects an intruder.
    Q = False # Q: The dog barked.

    # Choice C proposes a new variable:
    # R: The dog was asleep.
    # We must deduce the truth value of R based on the logic.

    # The logical statement from Choice C is:
    # Premise 1: (P ∧ ¬R) → Q
    # Premise 2: ¬Q ∧ P
    # Conclusion: R

    # Let's verify that the conclusion (R must be True) is necessary for the
    # premises to hold.

    # The form A → B is logically equivalent to (not A or B).
    # So, Premise 1 is: not(P and not R) or Q

    # We know P is True and Q is False. Let's substitute them into Premise 1.
    # not(True and not R) or False
    # For this entire statement to be True, the first part must be True:
    # not(True and not R) must be True
    # This means (True and not R) must be False.

    # The only way for (True and not R) to be False is if (not R) is False.
    # If (not R) is False, then R must be True.

    R = True # Deduced truth value for R

    # Let's print the explanation and the final answer.
