    # Otherwise, it's 'non-vertical' (or 'horizontal').
    # Let's check the limit of g(z) as z -> infinity.
    # Since the degree of the denominator (3) is greater than the degree of the
    # numerator (1), the limit is 0.
    # Because the limit is 0, the end is vertical.
    # Thus, the number of non-vertical ends is 0.
