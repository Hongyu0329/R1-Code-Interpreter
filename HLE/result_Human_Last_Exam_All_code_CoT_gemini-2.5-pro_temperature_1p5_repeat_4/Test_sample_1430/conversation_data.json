    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the possible range for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 curve.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Relate the Rank of NS(X) to the Curve C:** The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a symmetric power of a curve is related to the curve's Jacobian variety. For a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g$, and its n-th symmetric power $C^{(n)}$, the rank of the Néron-Severi group, $\\rho(C^{(n)})$, is given by the formula:\n    \n    $\\rho(C^{(n)}) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))$\n    \n    Here, $J(C)$ is the Jacobian variety of $C$, which is a $g$-dimensional abelian variety. Notice that this rank is independent of the degree $n$ of the symmetric power, so the fact that we are looking at the 15th symmetric power doesn't change the calculation. Our problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$ when $g=3$.\n\n2.  **Find the Bounds for the Rank of NS(J(C)):** The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a $g$-dimensional abelian variety $A$ is bounded by $1 \\le \\rho(A) \\le g^2$.\n    *   **Smallest Rank:** The minimum value, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$, occurs for a \"generic\" curve. In this case, the Jacobian $J(C)$ has the smallest possible endomorphism ring, $\\mathbb{Z}$, and its Néron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization.\n    *   **Largest Rank:** The maximum value, $\\rho(J(C)) = g^2$, is achieved for special curves whose Jacobians have maximal complex multiplication (CM). These are curves whose Jacobians are isogenous to a product of $g$ elliptic curves with CM.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Final Ranks for X:** We will substitute the minimum and maximum values of $\\rho(J(C))$ into our initial formula for $X = C^{(15)}$, with genus $g=3$.\n    *   **Smallest rank of NS(X):** $\\rho(X)_{min} = 1 + \\rho(J(C))_{min} = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   **Largest rank of NS(X):** $\\rho(X)_{max} = 1 + \\rho(J(C))_{max} = 1 + g^2 = 1 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# The genus of the Riemann surface C\ng = 3\n\n# The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^(15) is given by\n# rho(X) = 1 + rho(J(C)), where J(C) is the Jacobian of C.\n# We need to find the minimum and maximum possible values for rho(J(C)).\n\n# For a g-dimensional Jacobian J(C), the rank of its Neron-Severi group\n# is bounded by 1 <= rho(J(C)) <= g^2.\n\n# Smallest possible rank of NS(J(C)) for a generic curve\nrho_J_min = 1\n\n# Largest possible rank of NS(J(C)) for a special curve with maximal Complex Multiplication\nrho_J_max = g**2\n\n# Calculate the smallest possible rank for NS(X)\nrho_X_min = 1 + rho_J_min\n\n# Calculate the largest possible rank for NS(X)\nrho_X_max = 1 + rho_J_max\n\n# Print the results, showing the full equations\nprint(f\"The genus of the curve C is g = {g}.\")\nprint(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of X=C^(15) is rho(X) = 1 + rho(J(C)).\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Smallest Possible Rank ---\")\nprint(\"For a generic curve, the rank of the Jacobian's Neron-Severi group is 1.\")\nprint(f\"Smallest rank of NS(X) = 1 + rho(J(C))_min = 1 + {rho_J_min} = {rho_X_min}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Largest Possible Rank ---\")\nprint(\"For a special curve, the rank of the Jacobian's Neron-Severi group is g^2.\")\nprint(f\"Largest rank of NS(X) = 1 + rho(J(C))_max = 1 + {g}^2 = 1 + {rho_J_max} = {rho_X_max}\")\n```\n<<<Smallest: 2, Largest: 10>>>"
