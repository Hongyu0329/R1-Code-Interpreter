# This problem reduces to finding the minimum of a ratio F = A^3 / V^2,
# where A is the surface area and V is the volume of a paraboloid segment.
# The ratio can be expressed as a function of a single dimensionless parameter y.
# Differentiating F(y) with respect to y and setting the result to zero to find the minimum
# leads to the cubic equation: y * (y**2 - 24*y + 96) = 0.
# The physically valid solution that minimizes the ratio is y = 12 + 4*sqrt(3).

# Substituting this value of y back into the simplified expression for the ratio F(y) gives
# the final analytical result: 27 * pi * (6 + 4 * sqrt(3)) / 6.
# This simplifies to 27*pi + 18*pi*sqrt(3).

# Define the constants from the derived analytical formula:
# Ratio = (c1 * pi) * (c2 + c3 * sqrt(c4)) / c5
c1 = 27
c2 = 6
c3 = 4
c4 = 3
c5 = 6

# Calculate components for the equation
pi = math.pi
sqrt_of_3 = math.sqrt(c4)

# Print the equation with its numerical components as requested
