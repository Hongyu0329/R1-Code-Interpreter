    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the property that the transpose of the GCRD is the greatest common left divisor (GCLD) of the transposed matrices. That is, `GCRD(P1, P2)^T = GCLD(P1^T, P2^T)`.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the input matrices `P1` and `P2`.\n2.  Compute their transposes, `P1^T` and `P2^T`.\n3.  Find the GCLD of `P1^T` and `P2^T`. This is done by forming a stacked matrix `M = [P1^T; P2^T]` and reducing it to `[G; 0]` using elementary row operations. The resulting `G` is the GCLD.\n4.  The GCRD of the original matrices `P1` and `P2` is then the transpose of the `G` we found in the previous step.\n\nLet's execute this plan step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Define and Transpose Matrices**\nP1 = `[[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]`\nP2 = `[[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]`\n\nP1^T = `[[s^2 + s, -s^2 - 1], [-s, s^2]]`\nP2^T = `[[s, -s - 1], [0, 1]]`\n\n**Step 3: Find GCLD of Transposed Matrices**\nWe form the stacked matrix M and perform row reduction.\nM =\n`[s^2 + s,  -s^2 - 1]`  (R1)\n`[   -s,         s^2]`  (R2)\n`[    s,      -s - 1]`  (R3)\n`[    0,           1]`  (R4)\n\nThis reduction is best done using a symbolic computation library to avoid errors. The following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform this calculation.\n\n**Step 4: Transpose the Result**\nThe code will calculate the GCLD of the transposed matrices and then transpose it back to get the final GCRD.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef find_gcrd(P1, P2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = sp.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Transpose the input matrices\n    P1_T = P1.transpose()\n    P2_T = P2.transpose()\n    print(\"P1 Transposed:\")\n    sp.pprint(P1_T)\n    print(\"\\nP2 Transposed:\")\n    sp.pprint(P2_T)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 3: Find the GCLD of the transposed matrices using row reduction\n    # Form the stacked matrix M = [P1^T; P2^T]\n    M = P1_T.col_join(P2_T)\n    print(\"Stacked matrix M = [P1^T; P2^T]:\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Make a copy to perform row operations on\n    M_reduced = M.copy()\n\n    # The last row R4 is [0, 1].
