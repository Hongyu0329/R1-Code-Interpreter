    "My plan is to identify the specific numerical imprints for both the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules based on publicly available drug identification data. I will then write a Python script that assigns these numbers to variables and prints them in a clear, descriptive sentence to answer the user's question directly.\n\n```python\n# The numerical imprint on Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules.\nimprint_10mg = \"3105\"\n\n# The numerical imprint on Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\nimprint_20mg = \"3109\"\n\n# Print the different numbers associated with each capsule strength.\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is {imprint_10mg}.\")\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is {imprint_20mg}.\")\n\n```\n<<<3105, 3109>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
