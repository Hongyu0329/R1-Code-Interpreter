    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of linearly independent Lie polynomials of degree 10 in two variables, X and Y. This number corresponds to the number of nonzero coefficients in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion at order 10. The result is given by Witt's formula for the dimension of the subspace of homogeneous elements of degree `n` in a free Lie algebra on `k` generators.\n\nThe formula is:\n`L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nIn this specific case:\n*   `n = 10` (the order of the expansion)\n*   `k = 2` (the number of generators, X and Y)\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Implement a Python function to compute the Möbius function, `μ(d)`.\n2.  Identify all divisors of `n = 10`, which are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n3.  Calculate `μ(d)` for each divisor `d`.\n4.  Calculate each term `μ(d) * 2^(10/d)` in the summation.\n5.  Sum up all the terms, divide by 10, and present the final equation and the result.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of num as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_num = num\n    while d * d <= temp_num:\n        while temp_num % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_num //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_num > 1:\n        factors[temp_num] = factors.get(temp_num, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef moebius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Moebius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_coeffs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of a given order in the\n    BCH expansion using Witt's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    k = 2\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of nonzero BCH coefficients for order n={n} and k={k} generators.\")\n    print(f\"Using Witt's Formula: L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ[d|n] (μ(d) * k^(n/d))\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    # We will build the string for the final equation step by step\n    equation_terms = []\n\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = moebius(d)\n        power_val = k**(n // d)\n        term = mu_d * power_val\n        total_sum += term\n        \n        sign = \"+\" if term >= 0 else \"-\"\n        # For the first term, we omit the leading '+'\n        if not equation_terms:\n            if sign == \"+\":\n                sign = \"\"\n        else:\n            sign = f\" {sign} \"\n            \n        # Add the detailed term to our equation string\n        equation_terms.append(f\"{sign}({mu_d}) * {k}^{n//d}\")\n        \n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    # Now build the numerical version of the equation\n    numerical_terms = []\n    current_sum = 0\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = moebius(d)\n        power_val = k**(n//d)\n        term = mu_d * power_val\n        current_sum += term\n        \n        sign = \"+\" if term >= 0 else \"-\"\n        # For the first term, we omit the leading '+'\n        if not numerical_terms:\n             # handle case where first term is negative\n            sign = \"\" if sign == \"+\" else \"-\"\n        else:\n            sign = f\" {sign} \"\n        numerical_terms.append(f\"{sign}{abs(term)}\")\n        \n    print(f\"The number of coefficients is (1/{n}) * ( \" + \" \".join(numerical_terms) + f\" )\")\n    print(f\"= (1/{n}) * ( {total_sum} )\")\n    print(f\"= {result}\")\n    \n    return result\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_bch_coeffs()\n    print(\"\\nThus, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is 99.\")\n    print(\"<<<99>>>\")\n\n```"
