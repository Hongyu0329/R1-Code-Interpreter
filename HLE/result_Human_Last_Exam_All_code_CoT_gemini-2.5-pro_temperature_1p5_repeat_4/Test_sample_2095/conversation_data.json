    "My plan is to find the original text where Liu Ban discussed Zhang Ji's poetry. The most likely source for this is Liu Ban's work on literary criticism, *中山诗话* (Poetry Talks from Zhongshan). I will search for the relevant passage in this text, extract the specific evaluation concerning Zhang Ji's seven-character poems, and then present this information clearly in Chinese. To adhere to the format, I will embed the final answer text within a Python script that prints the information.\n\n```python\ndef liu_ban_evaluation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints Liu Ban's evaluation of Zhang Ji's seven-character poems.\n    \"\"\"\n    evaluation_text = \"\"\"\n根据北宋学者刘攽在其著作《中山诗话》中的记载，他对唐代诗人张籍的七言诗评价如下：\n\n原文：“张籍歌诗乐府之善者，殆与元、白相上下。但其源出于李白、杜甫，而深浅清浊不同。其七言诗，拙处多于巧处，盖才思有限，不能兼善也。”\n\n其中，对于七言诗的直接评价是：“其七言诗，拙处多于巧处”。\n\n这句话的意思是，张籍的七言诗，写得笨拙的地方要比巧妙的地方多。刘攽认为这是因为张籍的才华和思致有限，无法精通所有体裁的诗歌。\n\"\"\"\n    print(evaluation_text)\n\nliu_ban_evaluation()\n```\n<<<根据北宋学者刘攽在《中山诗话》中的评价，他认为张籍的七言诗是“拙处多于巧处”，即笨拙的地方比巧妙的地方多。他认为这是因为张籍才思有限，不能兼善所有诗歌体裁。>>>"
