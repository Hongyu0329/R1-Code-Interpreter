The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in imaginary time is given by the functional path integral over Grassmann fields:

Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ * exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ])

Where:

1.  Z: The Partition Function of the fermionic system.

2.  ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ: The functional integral (or path integral) over all possible configurations of the independent Grassmann fields ψ(x, τ) and ψ̄(x, τ).

3.  exp(...): The exponential function.

4.  S_E[ψ̄, ψ]: The Euclidean action for the fermionic system. It is defined as:

    S_E = ∫[0 to β] dτ ∫ d^d x * L_E(ψ̄, ψ, ∂_μ ψ̄, ∂_μ ψ)

    - S_E contains all the dynamics of the system.
    - For example, for a free, non-relativistic fermion gas, the Euclidean Lagrangian L_E is:
      L_E = ψ̄(x, τ) * [ħ∂/∂τ - (ħ²/(2m))∇² - μ] * ψ(x, τ)

5.  β: The inverse temperature, defined as β = 1 / (k_B * T).
    - k_B is the Boltzmann constant.
    - T is the temperature.

6.  τ: Imaginary time, which runs from 0 to β.

7.  ħ: The reduced Planck constant. ħ = h / (2 * π).

8.  μ: The chemical potential.

9.  m: The mass of the fermion.

10. Boundary Conditions: The integral is performed over fields that satisfy anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction:
    ψ(x, τ=β) = -ψ(x, τ=0)
    ψ̄(x, τ=β) = -ψ̄(x, τ=0)
