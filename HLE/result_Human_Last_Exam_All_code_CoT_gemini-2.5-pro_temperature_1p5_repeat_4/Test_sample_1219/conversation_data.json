    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform a high-precision calculation. Standard floating-point numbers are not sufficient for a number as large as 10^100.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Use a High-Precision Library:** We will use the `mpmath` library in Python, which is designed for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic. If you don't have it installed, you can install it using `pip install mpmath`.\n2.  **Handle Periodicity:** The tangent function is periodic with a period of π. This means `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. The `mpmath` library's `tan` function automatically handles this reduction of large arguments, which simplifies the calculation.\n3.  **Set Sufficient Precision:** To accurately compute `10^100 mod π`, we need to use a precision greater than the number of digits in `10^100`. Since `10^100` is a 1 followed by 100 zeros (a 101-digit number), we need to set the precision in `mpmath` to more than 101 decimal places. A value of 110 is a safe choice.\n4.  **Calculate and Extract Digits:** We will calculate `tan(10^100)` using `mpmath`. Then, we'll convert the result to a string and extract the first three characters that appear after the decimal point.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# The mpmath library is required for this high-precision calculation.\n# If not installed, run: pip install mpmath\n\n# 1. Set the precision (dps = decimal places).\n# Since 10^100 is a 101-digit number, we need more than 101 places\n# of precision to get the remainder modulo pi accurately. We'll use 110.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 110\n\n# 2. Define the number for the tan function.\nx = mpmath.power(10, 100)\n\n# 3. Calculate tan(x).\n# mpmath automatically handles the large argument by reducing it modulo pi.\nresult = mpmath.tan(x)\n\n# 4. Extract the first 3 digits after the comma.\n# To do this, we convert the result to a string.\nresult_str = str(result)\n# Find the index of the decimal point.\ndecimal_point_index = result_str.find('.')\n# Slice the string to get the 3 characters after the decimal point.\nfirst_three_digits = result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n\n# As requested, we show the numbers in the final calculation.\nprint(f\"tan(10^100) = {result}\")\nprint(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma are: {first_three_digits}\")\n```\n<<<404>>>"
