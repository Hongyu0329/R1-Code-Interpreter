    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how logical qubits are encoded in a planar surface code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Logical Qubits in a Single Patch:** First, I'll establish the formula for the number of logical qubits in a single patch of a planar surface code. A standard planar patch without any holes encodes one logical qubit (`k=1`). Each hole you add to the patch introduces an additional logical qubit. Therefore, for a single patch with `h` holes, the number of logical qubits is `k = h + 1`.\n\n2.  **Logical Qubits in Multiple Patches:** The problem specifies two separate patches. Since these patches are not topologically connected, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each individual patch.\n\n3.  **Calculation:** Let the number of patches be `P` and the total number of holes be `H`. The total number of logical qubits `K` can be expressed as:\n    `K = (h1 + 1) + (h2 + 1) + ... + (hP + 1)`\n    where `h1, h2, ...` are the holes in each patch.\n    This simplifies to:\n    `K = (h1 + h2 + ... + hP) + P`\n    `K = H + P`\n\n4.  **Applying to the problem:** We have `P = 2` patches and `H = 2` total holes. Using the formula, we can calculate the total number of logical qubits. The distribution of the two holes between the two patches (e.g., one in each, or both in one) does not change the final sum.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a\n    system of separate surface code patches with a given number of holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of separate surface code patches\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Total number of holes across all patches\n    total_holes = 2\n\n    # The formula for the total number of logical qubits (K) in a system\n    # of P separate patches and H total holes is: K = H + P.\n    # This is because each patch contributes 1 logical qubit, and each hole\n    # adds an additional logical qubit.\n    # K = (qubits from patches) + (qubits from holes)\n    # K = P + H\n    \n    total_logical_qubits = total_holes + num_patches\n\n    print(\"To find the maximum number of logical qubits, we use the formula:\")\n    print(\"Total Logical Qubits = (Total Number of Holes) + (Number of Patches)\")\n    print(\"\\nGiven:\")\n    print(f\"Number of Patches = {num_patches}\")\n    print(f\"Total Number of Holes = {total_holes}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{total_holes} + {num_patches} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n\nsolve_qubits()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
