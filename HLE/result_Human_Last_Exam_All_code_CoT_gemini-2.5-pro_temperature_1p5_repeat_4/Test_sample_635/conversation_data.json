    "To find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function matrix $H(s)$, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  A left coprime factorization of a transfer function matrix $H(s)$ is given by $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, where $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are polynomial matrices that are \"left coprime\".\n2.  To find a candidate pair $(D(s), N(s))$, we search for a polynomial matrix $D(s)$ such that $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ also results in a polynomial matrix. The matrix $D(s)$ must be invertible, meaning its determinant is not the zero polynomial.\n3.  We start by analyzing the denominators in $H(s)$. The matrix $D(s)$ must be chosen carefully to cancel these denominators when multiplied with $H(s)$. For the given $H(s)$, the denominators are $(s+1)$ and $s^2-1 = (s+1)(s-1)$.\n4.  After finding a candidate pair $(D(s), N(s))$, we must verify that they are left coprime. The matrices are considered left coprime if the compound matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$. A practical method to confirm this is to show that at least one of its square sub-matrices of the highest possible order (a minor) has a determinant that is a non-zero constant.\n5.  We will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to perform these steps. The script will define the matrices, carry out the necessary calculations to find $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, and verify that they form a correct and coprime factorization. Finally, it will print out the resulting matrices.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates a left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\n    for the given transfer function matrix H(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the transfer function matrix H(s)\n    # H(s) = [[ (s-1)/(s+1),   1 ],\n    #         [ 2/(s^2-1),     0 ]]\n    H = sympy.Matrix([\n        [(s-1)/(s+1), 1],\n        [2/(s**2-1), 0]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"Calculating a left coprime factorization for H(s):\")\n    sympy.pprint(H)\n\n    # To make D(s) * H(s) a polynomial matrix, we need to choose D(s) to cancel\n    # the denominators in H(s).\n    # Let D(s) = [[d11, d12], [d21, d22]].\n    # N(s) = D(s) * H(s)\n    # n11 = d11*(s-1)/(s+1) + d12*2/(s^2-1)\n    # n21 = d21*(s-1)/(s+1) + d22*2/(s^2-1)\n    # We choose a simple D(s) that satisfies the polynomial condition for N(s).\n    # A simple choice that works is:\n    D = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, s - 1],\n        [0, s**2 - 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Calculate N(s) = D(s) * H(s) and simplify\n    N = sympy.simplify(D * H)\n\n    print(\"\\nA left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\n\n    # Print D(s) and N(s)\n    print(\"\\nD(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(D)\n\n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(N)\n\n    # --- Verification ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Verification Steps ---\")\n    # 1.
