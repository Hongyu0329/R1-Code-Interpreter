    print("   Analysis: INCORRECT. While vaping is less harmful than combustible cigarettes, it is not safe. Endorsing any nicotine use in adolescents is inappropriate due to risks to the developing brain and high addiction potential. The goal is complete cessation.\n")

    print("II. It would be good for her son to start using nicotine patches, gum, or lozenges instead of vaping.")
    print("   Analysis: CORRECT. Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) is a safer, evidence-based method to manage nicotine withdrawal and dependence. It's a key component of a cessation plan for adolescents.\n")

    print("III. Vaping’s risks and benefits are well understood in adults, but not in children, so her son should not vape at all.")
    print("   Analysis: CORRECT. This is a critical counseling point. It highlights that the risk-benefit calculation is different for adolescents and correctly emphasizes that the unknown long-term risks are a strong reason for complete cessation.\n")

    print("IV. Vaping’s risks and benefits remain poorly understood in children, but it has been shown vaping has clear benefits over cigarettes in children.")
    print("   Analysis: INCORRECT. This statement is false. The harm reduction model of vaping vs. smoking is for established adult smokers. Promoting vaping as having 'clear benefits' for children is dangerous and against medical guidance.\n")

    print("V. Consider initiating bupropion and varenicline depending on her son’s needs.")
    print("   Analysis: This is a plausible secondary option to consider for adolescents with severe, refractory nicotine dependence. However, options II and III form the core of initial counseling. Given the choices, the combination of II and III is the strongest and most essential.\n")
