    explanation = """
    The question asks for the dominant mechanism causing inward flow in a GTAW weld pool for 304 stainless steel. Let's analyze the forces:

    1. Arc Pressure/Drag: These forces from the plasma jet push the molten metal outward from the center. This is opposite to the observed flow.

    2. Lorentz (Electromagnetic) Force: This force, due to the welding current, does create an inward and downward "pinching" flow. It is a contributor.

    3. Marangoni Force (Surface Tension Gradient): This is the most critical force for determining surface flow direction.
       - In pure metals, temperature rises -> surface tension drops -> liquid flows outward.
       - In alloys like 304 stainless steel, surface-active elements (like sulfur) reverse this.
       - In this case, temperature rises -> surface tension rises -> liquid is pulled from the cooler outer edges INWARD to the hotter center.

    Conclusion: The inward flow described is a classic characteristic of the Marangoni effect in stainless steels. While the Lorentz force also contributes to inward flow, the Marangoni force is considered the DOMINANT mechanism that governs the surface flow direction and the resulting weld bead shape.
