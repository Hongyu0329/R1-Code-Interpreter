  The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components
  of an open subset of a Hausdorff topological group G of cardinality c
  with a specific property.

  The analysis of the group properties leads to the conclusion that such a
  group G can be constructed (based on topological spaces like the
  Knaster-Kuratowski fan) for which an open subset can have c
  (the cardinality of the continuum) non-open components.

  Since the group itself has cardinality c, this is the maximum possible
  number.
