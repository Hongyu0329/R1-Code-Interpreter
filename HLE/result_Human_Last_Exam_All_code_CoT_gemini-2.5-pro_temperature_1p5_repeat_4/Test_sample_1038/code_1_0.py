    # Option A
    print("--- Option A: Minimum-Length/Large-Width Transistors ---")
    print("This strategy prioritizes a fast reset (< 5 us) using a small capacitor and high drive current.")
    print("However, using a large W/L ratio directly increases subthreshold leakage current, working against the high-resistance goal.")
    print("Minimum-length devices suffer from short-channel effects, which also increase leakage and instability.")
    print("Verdict: Poor trade-off. Fails on stability and achieving high resistance.")
    print("-" * 50)

    # Option B
    print("--- Option B: Segmented Capacitor with Refresh ---")
    print("This strategy directly targets the gate-cap leakage (< 1%/s) requirement.")
    print("However, it introduces significant complexity with clocking and multiple switches.")
    print("The switching action itself creates noise, clock feedthrough, and charge injection, which degrades signal integrity.")
    print("Verdict: Overly complex and introduces new noise problems while not addressing the core headroom issue.")
    print("-" * 50)

    # Option C
    print("--- Option C: On-chip Body-Bias Generator ---")
    print("This strategy aims to reduce leakage by increasing the transistor's threshold voltage (Vt).")
    print(f"The critical flaw: Increasing Vt from an already high {threshold_voltage} V at a low {supply_voltage} V supply severely shrinks the available signal swing.")
    print(f"This makes it nearly impossible to accommodate the required +/- {sensor_offset * 1000} mV offset without saturating the device.")
    print("Verdict: Fails on the critical offset handling requirement due to low-voltage constraints.")

    # Option D
    print("--- Option D: High-Impedance Current Mirrors ---")
    print("This strategy solves gate-cap leakage by replacing the capacitor with an active current source.")
    print("However, this is fundamentally incompatible with the circuit's purpose. It creates a fixed gate voltage, destroying the 'bootstrapping' effect needed for offset rejection.")
    print(f"As the source moves by +/- {sensor_offset * 1000} mV, the Vgs would change dramatically, causing massive, uncontrolled resistance variation.")
    print("Verdict: A non-functional solution that fails on offset rejection and has no fast reset mechanism.")

    # Option E
    print("--- Option E: Split-Gate Transistor ---")

    print("1. Offset Rejection: The bootstrapped gate portion tracks the source voltage to handle the offset, preserving the core functionality.")
    print("2. Stable Biasing: The static gate portion provides a fixed, tunable bias, giving an extra degree of freedom to reliably set the subthreshold operating point within the limited {supply_voltage} V supply.")
    print("3. Fast Reset: Both gates can be driven during reset to turn the device fully on, ensuring fast settling (< 5 us).")
    print("Verdict: This strategy effectively uses a more advanced device structure to resolve all the conflicting requirements of offset tolerance, fast reset, and stable subthreshold biasing at a low supply.")
