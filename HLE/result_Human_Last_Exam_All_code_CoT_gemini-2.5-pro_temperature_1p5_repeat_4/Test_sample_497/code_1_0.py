# The problem requires finding the value of a capacitor 'x' in terms of 'c'
# such that the total equivalent capacitance of a ladder network is independent
# of the number of cells N.

# As derived, this condition leads to a quadratic equation for the ratio k = x/c:
# 2*k^2 + 2*k - 1 = 0

a = 2
b = 2
c_coeff = -1

# We solve this equation for k. The numbers in the final equation are the coefficients.
print("The value of x is found by solving the following quadratic equation for the ratio k = x/c:")
print(f"{a}*k^2 + {b}*k + {c_coeff} = 0")

# The positive solution for k gives the factor by which c is multiplied to get x.
# k = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c_coeff)) / (2*a)
# k = (-2 + sqrt(2^2 - 4*2*(-1))) / (2*2)
# k = (-2 + sqrt(4 + 8)) / 4
# k = (-2 + sqrt(12)) / 4
# k = (-2 + 2*sqrt(3)) / 4
# k = (sqrt(3) - 1) / 2

k = (math.sqrt(3) - 1) / 2

print("\nThe positive solution for k is (sqrt(3) - 1) / 2.")
print(f"The numeric value for k is approximately: {k:.5f}")

print("\nTherefore, the required value for the capacitor x is:")
print("x = c * (sqrt(3) - 1) / 2")
