The verses were written by the Spanish poet Rafael Alberti. They belong to his collection 'Sobre los ángeles (Concerning the Angels)'. This collection was heavily influenced by Francisco de Goya's 'Black Paintings (Pinturas negras)', and these specific verses are widely considered to be directed at the painting 'El Gran Cabrón (The Great He-Goat), also known as Aquelarre (Witches' Sabbath)'.
