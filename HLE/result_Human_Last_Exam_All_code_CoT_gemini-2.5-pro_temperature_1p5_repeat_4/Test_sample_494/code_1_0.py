    # --- Introduction: The Phenomenon of Tunneling ---
    print("--- Analyzing Tunneling in an Exotic Ammonia Molecule ---\n")
    print("1. The Basics of Ammonia Tunneling")
    print("   - In any ammonia molecule (NH₃), the nitrogen atom can quantum mechanically 'tunnel' through the plane of the three hydrogens.")
    print("   - This tunneling effect splits the molecule's vibrational energy levels into pairs: a lower-energy symmetric state ('s') and a higher-energy antisymmetric state ('a').")
    print("   - For this splitting to be observable, both the 's' and 'a' states must be allowed to exist by the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics.\n")

    # --- The Core Change: Particle Statistics ---
    print("2. The Impact of Hydrogen's Nuclear Spin")
    print("   The key difference between ordinary and exotic ammonia is the nature of the hydrogen nuclei:")
    print("   - Ordinary Hydrogen Nuclei (Protons): Spin = 1/2. They are FERMIONS.")
    print("     The Pauli Principle demands the TOTAL wavefunction be ANTI-SYMMETRIC when two protons are exchanged.")
    print("   - Exotic Hydrogen Nuclei: Spin = 0. They are BOSONS.")
    print("     The Pauli Principle demands the TOTAL wavefunction be SYMMETRIC when two exotic hydrogens are exchanged.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Wavefunction Components ---
    print("3. Wavefunction Symmetry Analysis")
    print("   The total wavefunction is approximately Ψ_total = Ψ_vibrational * Ψ_rotational * Ψ_nuclear_spin.")
    
    print("\n   - Nuclear Spin State (Ψ_nuclear_spin):")
    print("     For three spin-0 bosons, there is only ONE possible nuclear spin state.")
    print("     This state is inherently and immutably SYMMETRIC under particle exchange.")

    print("\n   - Rotational & Vibrational States:")
    print("     Since the total wavefunction and the nuclear spin part must BOTH be symmetric (for bosons), the product (Ψ_rotational * Ψ_vibrational) must ALSO be symmetric under particle exchange.")
    print("     The tunneling (vibrational) coordinate is not affected by swapping hydrogens, so Ψ_vibrational is symmetric under this exchange.")
    print("     This forces the rotational state, Ψ_rotational, to be SYMMETRIC. Rotational states that are not symmetric under hydrogen exchange become forbidden and would be missing from the molecule's spectrum.\n")

    # --- Conclusion ---
    print("4. Conclusion: Would Tunneling Be Exhibited?")
    print("   The critical question is whether the restriction on rotational states prevents the existence of the tunneling pair ('s' and 'a' states).")
    print("   It does not. For any rotational state that IS allowed (i.e., symmetric, like the ground state J=0), we can form a valid total wavefunction with BOTH vibrational states:")
    
    # Let's represent the states: S_v = symmetric vibrational, A_v = antisymmetric vibrational
    # S_rot = symmetric rotational, S_nuc = symmetric nuclear spin.
    # Total state must be symmetric (bosons).
    print("\n   - Valid State 1: (S_v) * (S_rot) * (S_nuc) -> Symmetric * Symmetric * Symmetric = SYMMETRIC. (Allowed)")
    print("   - Valid State 2: (A_v) * (S_rot) * (S_nuc) -> Symmetric * Symmetric * Symmetric = SYMMETRIC. (Allowed)")
    print("     (Note: The 'A_v' antisymmetry is with respect to nitrogen INVERSION, not hydrogen EXCHANGE. These are different operations.)")

    print("\n   Since both the lower and upper energy levels of the tunneling doublet can exist for allowed rotational states, the energy splitting due to tunneling would still be present and observable.\n")

    print("Final Answer: Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic spin-zero hydrogens would exhibit tunneling.")
