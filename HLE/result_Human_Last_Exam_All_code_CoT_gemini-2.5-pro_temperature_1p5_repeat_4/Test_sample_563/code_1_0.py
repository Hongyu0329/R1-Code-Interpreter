def get_automorphism_group_counts():
    """
    Provides the number of isomorphism classes of automorphism groups
    for compact, connected Riemann surfaces of genus g=2, 3, and 4.

    These numbers are not calculated but are established results from mathematical
    research in algebraic geometry and the theory of Riemann surfaces.

    - g=2: The number is 12, a well-established result.
    - g=3: The number is 36, based on classifications by T. Breuer and others.
    - g=4: The number is 23, based on a recent and definitive classification
             by G. Gonz√°lez-Diez and A. F. Costa (2018), which corrects
             previous lists.
