    The task is to identify a group of linguistic features highly correlated with word complexity for advanced non-native and native speakers.

    1.  Word Length and Syllable Count are fundamental structural measures. Longer words are generally more complex.
    2.  Word Familiarity Rating directly measures how common a word is, a key factor in its perceived difficulty.
    3.  Concreteness Rating measures the difference between easily understood tangible concepts (e.g., 'table') and more difficult abstract ones (e.g., 'justice').
    4.  Other features like 'Number of Unique Words' are measures of text-level diversity, not individual word complexity.

    The combination of word length, familiarity, syllable count, and concreteness provides a comprehensive and widely accepted model for predicting word complexity. This corresponds to option D.
