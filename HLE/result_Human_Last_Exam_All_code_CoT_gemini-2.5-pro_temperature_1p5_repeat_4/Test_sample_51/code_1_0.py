    print("### Analysis of the Problem ###")
    print("The task is to identify which axiom, when added to dependent type theory with a special subterm rule, leads to inconsistency.\n")

    print("Step 1: Understanding the Subterm Rule")
    print("------------------------------------------")
    print("The rule is: 'a lambda (λ x. f) is a subterm of X whenever X is a subterm of X'.")
    print("The condition 'X is a subterm of X' is always true due to the reflexive property of the subterm relation.")
    print("Therefore, the rule simplifies to: 'Any lambda expression (λ x. f) is a subterm of any term X'.")
    print("This is highly non-standard. Structural recursion requires that recursive calls are made on strictly smaller subterms to guarantee termination. This rule violates that principle, as a lambda expression is not inherently 'smaller' than X.")
    print("Conclusion: This rule allows for non-terminating computations, effectively giving the system the power of 'general recursion' (e.g., via a Y-combinator).\n")

    print("Step 2: The Consequence of General Recursion")
    print("-----------------------------------------------")
    print("It is a classic result in logic and computer science that a sufficiently powerful type theory (like the one described) that includes general recursion becomes inconsistent if combined with classical logic.")
    print("An inconsistent system is one where 'False' can be proven, making the system logically useless.\n")

    print("Step 3: Identifying the Axiom of Classical Logic")
    print("--------------------------------------------------")
    print("We now examine the list of axioms to find the one representing classical logic.")
    print(" - (F) Double-negation elimination (¬¬P → P) is a principle of classical logic.")
    print(" - (H) Excluded middle (P ∨ ¬P) is the most famous principle of classical logic.")
    print(" - (I) Markov's principle is a much weaker classical axiom, which is known to be consistent with general recursion in many systems.")
    print("In the context of dependent type theory, (F) and (H) are logically equivalent. However, proofs of the inconsistency often rely on a case-distinction, which is provided directly by the disjunction in the Law of the Excluded Middle (H).\n")

    print("Step 4: Explaining the Inconsistency")
    print("--------------------------------------")
    print("The inconsistency arises because general recursion allows us to define functions whose behavior (e.g., terminating or looping) depends on the truth of a proposition P.")
    print("Classical logic, specifically the Law of the Excluded Middle (H), asserts that for any P, we have a proof of 'P or not P'.")
    print("This allows us to construct a paradoxical term that formalizes a contradiction similar to the Halting Problem. We can define a function that, for a given proposition R, terminates if R is false and loops if R is true. We then set R to be the proposition 'this very function terminates', leading to a paradox: it terminates if and only if it does not terminate. This contradiction proves 'False'.\n")
    
    print("Step 5: Final Conclusion")
    print("-------------------------")
    print("The other axioms are either consistent with general recursion (A, B, D, E, G, I) or lead to other kinds of paradoxes not directly related to this recursion mechanism (C). The axiom that creates an inconsistency in this specific scenario is the one that introduces classical logic.")
    print("The most direct and fundamental axiom for this is (H) Excluded Middle.")
