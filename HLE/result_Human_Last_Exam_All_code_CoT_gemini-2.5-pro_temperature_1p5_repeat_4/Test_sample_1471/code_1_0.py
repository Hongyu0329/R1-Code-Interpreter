# Step 1: Define the numbers from the equation.
num1 = 24  # This is XXIV
num2 = 300 # This is CCC
num3 = 399 # This is CCCXCIX

# Step 2: Perform the calculation.
result = num1 / num2 - num3

# Step 3: Print the equation with the final answer.
# The format string prints each number in the equation followed by the result.
