    "To solve this problem, I will first convert the Roman numerals into modern numbers. Then, I will perform the arithmetic operations as specified in the equation.\n\n1.  **Decode the Roman Numerals:**\n    *   `XXIV` translates to 24 (10 + 10 + 4).\n    *   `CCC` translates to 300 (100 + 100 + 100).\n    *   `CCCXCIX` translates to 399 (300 + 90 + 9).\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:** The equation in modern numbers is: `24 / 300 - 399`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    *   First, divide 24 by 300, which equals 0.08.\n    *   Next, subtract 399 from 0.08, which equals -398.92.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the full equation with the solution.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the numbers from the equation.\nnum1 = 24  # This is XXIV\nnum2 = 300 # This is CCC\nnum3 = 399 # This is CCCXCIX\n\n# Step 2: Perform the calculation.\nresult = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# Step 3: Print the equation with the final answer.\n# The format string prints each number in the equation followed by the result.\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-398.92>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
