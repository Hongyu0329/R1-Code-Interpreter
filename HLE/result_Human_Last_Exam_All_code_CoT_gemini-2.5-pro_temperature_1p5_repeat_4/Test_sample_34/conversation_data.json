    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request is to identify the \"worst\" suited Jack (a hand like Jack-X of the same suit, abbreviated JXs) that should still be played as an open-raise from the button position in a standard 100 big blind No-Limit Hold'em cash game.\n2.  **Poker Position:** The \"button\" is the most powerful position in poker because you act last on every post-flop street. This advantage means you can profitably play a very wide range of hands.\n3.  **Hand Rankings:** Suited hands are ranked by their highest card, then their second-highest card (the \"kicker\"). For suited Jacks, the ranking from best to worst is JAs, JKs, JQs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n4.  **Game Theory Optimal (GTO) Ranges:** Modern poker strategy relies on GTO opening ranges, which are charts calculated by powerful computer solvers. These charts tell you which hands are profitable to open-raise from each position.\n5.  **Consulting the Range:** For a 100BB cash game, a standard GTO opening range from the button is very wide (often 45-50% of all possible hands). This range includes *all* suited Jacks, from Ace-high (JAs) down to the lowest possible kicker (J2s).\n6.  **Identifying the \"Worst\":** Since all suited Jacks are considered standard, profitable opens, the \"worst\" one is simply the one with the lowest rank and lowest expected value (EV). This is the hand with the lowest kicker: Jack-Two suited.\n7.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a simple Python script to declare the worst suited jack based on this poker theory and print it.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the worst suited jack to open-raise from the button in a\n    standard 100BB NLHE cash game based on GTO principles.\n\n    In poker theory, the button is the most profitable position, allowing for a\n    very wide opening range. Game Theory Optimal (GTO) charts show that all\n    suited jacks (from JAs down to J2s) are standard opens from this position.\n\n    Therefore, the \"worst\" hand in this category that is still a profitable\n    open-raise is the one with the lowest kicker.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # List of suited jacks from best to worst\n    suited_jacks = [\"JAs\", \"JKs\", \"JQs\", \"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\", \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"]\n    \n    # According to GTO charts, J2s is the last and therefore \"worst\" suited jack\n    # that is included in a standard button opening range.\n    worst_suited_jack_open = suited_jacks[-1]\n    \n    print(f\"Based on standard GTO poker opening ranges, the worst suited jack you should open from the button is: {worst_suited_jack_open}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
