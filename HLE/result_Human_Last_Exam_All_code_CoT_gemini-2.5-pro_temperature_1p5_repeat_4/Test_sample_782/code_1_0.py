def solve_cost_calculation():
    """
    Calculates the minimum cost for computing 2A - 3B on a twisted Edwards curve.

    The plan is to decompose the operation as 2(A - B) - B and sum the costs
    of the intermediate steps using efficient mixed-coordinate operations.
    Costs are based on the Explicit-Formulas Database (EFD) for twisted Edwards
    curves, with results in extended coordinates (X:Y:Z:T).
    Assumptions:
    - Cost of squaring (S) is equal to multiplication (M).
    - Cost of field additions/subtractions and multiplication by curve constants is negligible.
