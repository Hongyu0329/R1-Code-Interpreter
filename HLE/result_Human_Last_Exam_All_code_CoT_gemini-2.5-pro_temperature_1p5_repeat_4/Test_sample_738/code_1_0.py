# Step 1: Calculate the total number of distinct instructions.
# Instructions are: stop (1), turn left (2), turn right (2), forward (4), backward (2).
num_distinct_commands = 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2
print(f"1. Total number of distinct commands: 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = {num_distinct_commands}")

# Step 2: Determine the minimum bits needed to represent one instruction.
# To represent N states, we need ceil(log2(N)) bits.
bits_per_command = math.ceil(math.log2(num_distinct_commands))
print(f"2. Bits needed per command: ceil(log2({num_distinct_commands})) = {bits_per_command} bits")

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of instructions needed for a full Martian day (sol).
# A sol is 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.
# An instruction is given each Earth minute.
hours = 24
minutes = 39
seconds = 35.244
total_minutes_in_sol = (hours * 60) + minutes + (seconds / 60)

# We must have enough instructions for the whole day, so we round up.
total_commands_for_day = math.ceil(total_minutes_in_sol)
print(f"3. A Martian day is {total_minutes_in_sol:.4f} Earth minutes. We need {total_commands_for_day} commands to cover the day.")

# Step 4: Calculate the total memory in bytes.
# Total bits = total commands * bits per command
total_bits = total_commands_for_day * bits_per_command
# Total bytes = total bits / 8
total_bytes = total_bits / 8

print(f"\n4. Final Calculation:")
print(f"The smallest memory size is ({total_commands_for_day} commands * {bits_per_command} bits/command) / 8 bits/byte = {int(total_bytes)} bytes.")
