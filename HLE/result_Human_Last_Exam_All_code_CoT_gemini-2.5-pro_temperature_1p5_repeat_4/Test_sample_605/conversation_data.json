    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant for a quasihomogeneous polynomial $f(z_1, ..., z_n)$ with weights $(w_1, ..., w_n)$ and degree $d$ is given by the formula:\n    $c_N(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (1 - 2q_i)$, where the charges are $q_i = w_i/d$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree (d):** A polynomial is quasihomogeneous if every monomial term has the same weighted degree. We calculate this degree for each term using the given weights $w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n    *   $z_1^8z_3$: $8 \\times 22 + 1 \\times 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$\n    *   $z_1z_2^7$: $1 \\times 22 + 7 \\times 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$\n    *   $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$: $22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$\n    *   $z_2z_3^4$: $1 \\times 29 + 4 \\times 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$\n    *   $z_4^3z_5$: $3 \\times 50 + 1 \\times 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$\n    *   $z_5^3$: $3 \\times 75 = 225$\n\n    The term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a degree of $4 \\times 22 + 3 \\times 29 + 1 \\times 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$. This appears to be a typo in the polynomial, as all other terms consistently yield a degree of 225. For the link to be a Calabi-Yau, the polynomial must be quasihomogeneous. We will proceed with the well-defined degree $d=225$.\n\n3.  **Verify Calabi-Yau Condition:** For a hypersurface to be Calabi-Yau, its degree must equal the sum of the weights of the ambient space.\n    *   $d = 225$\n    *   $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$\n    *   Since $d = \\sum w_i$, the Calabi-Yau condition is satisfied.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Invariant:** We will now substitute the weights and the degree into the formula and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the final calculation and print the full equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights of the ambient space P(w1, w2, w3, w4, w5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    n = len(weights)\n\n    # The degree 'd' of the quasihomogeneous polynomial.\n    # As determined by analyzing the monomials, d=225.\n    d = 225\n\n    # Check if the Calabi-Yau condition (d = sum of weights) is met\n    if d != sum(weights):\n        print(f\"Warning: The Calabi-Yau condition is not met. d={d}, sum(w_i)={sum(weights)}\")\n    \n    # Calculate the charges q_i = w_i / d\n    charges = [w / d for w in weights]\n\n    # Calculate the individual terms (1 - 2*q_i) for the invariant sum\n    cn_terms = [1 - 2 * q for q in charges]\n\n    # Sum the terms to get the final invariant\n    cn_invariant = sum(cn_terms)\n\n    # Build and print the equation as requested\n    equation_parts = []\n    for w in weights:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"(1 - 2 * {w}/{d})\")\n    \n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"c_N = sum_{i=1 to 5} (1 - 2 * w_i/d)\\n\")\n    print(\"Substituting the given values:\")\n    # Using math.isclose() for a robust floating-point comparison to check if the result is an integer\n    if math.isclose(cn_invariant, round(cn_invariant)):\n        print(f\"c_N = {equation_string} = {int(round(cn_invariant))}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"c_N = {equation_string} = {cn_invariant}\")\n\ncalculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
