# 2. Determine donor atoms from the ligand
# Each arm has one '2-pyridyl' group and one 'pyrazolyl' group.
# The pyridine N is a donor.
# The pyrazole N2 is a donor (N1 is used for linkage).
# "Di" means there are two such arms.

# ZnBr2 provides one Zn(II) ion and two Br(-) anions.
# Bromide is a common coordinating ligand.

# 4. Determine the coordination environment of the Zn(II) center
# Zn(II) is a d10 ion and commonly forms 4- or 6-coordinate complexes.
# With a tetradentate (N4) ligand and two available bromide ligands,
# the most likely outcome is a 6-coordinate complex.

for atom, count in sorted(total_coordinated_atoms.items()):
    final_list.extend([atom] * count)

# We need to output each atom in the final equation.
# Based on the choices, the format is a comma-separated list of atom symbols.
print(', '.join(final_list))

# 5. Match with answer choices
# A. Br, Br, N, N (4-coordinate, wrong ligand denticity)
# B. Br, Br, N, N, N, N (6-coordinate, matches our finding)
# C. N, N, N, N (4-coordinate, ignores bromide ligands)
# The correct choice is B.
