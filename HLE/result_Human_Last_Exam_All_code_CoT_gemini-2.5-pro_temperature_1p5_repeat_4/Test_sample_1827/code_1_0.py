def solve_goldstone_bosons():
    """
    Calculates the number of Goldstone bosons for a QCD phase transition.

    The problem describes a phase transition in a system of light quarks,
    relevant to the K meson, from a gas phase to a condensed phase.

    1.  Gas Phase:
        The system starts with Nf light quarks. For Kaons (u,d,s quarks), Nf = 3.
        The flavor symmetry group is SU(Nf).
        The number of generators for SU(N) is N^2 - 1.

    2.  Condensed Phase:
        A quark with chemical potential (the strange quark) condenses.
        The problem states this effectively reduces the number of flavors to Nf - 1.
        The remaining flavor symmetry group is SU(Nf - 1).

    3.  Goldstone's Theorem:
        The number of Goldstone bosons equals the number of broken generators, which is
        the difference between the generators of the original and final symmetry groups.
