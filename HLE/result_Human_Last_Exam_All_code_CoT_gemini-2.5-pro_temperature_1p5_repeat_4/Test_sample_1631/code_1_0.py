# The user wants to identify the correct scientific basis for using bypass notches in sheet metal forming.
# I have analyzed the provided options based on my knowledge of manufacturing processes.
# Option D: "To counteract issues of material inflow into forming cavities around complex geometries of the workpiece (e.g. small radii, zero draft angles, etc.)"
# This is the most accurate description. In sheet metal forming, especially deep drawing, controlling the flow of material from the blank holder area into the die is critical.
# - Too much material flow leads to wrinkling.
# - Too little material flow leads to excessive thinning and tearing/splitting.
# Positive notches (drawbeads) are added to the binder surface to increase restraint and restrict material flow.
# Negative notches (cutouts in the binder or blank) are used to decrease restraint and encourage material flow into specific areas.
# This technique is essential for parts with non-uniform shapes and complex geometries, as different regions of the part require different amounts of material flow to form correctly.
# The other options are either incorrect (related to cutting, not forming), consequences of poor material flow (wrinkling, thinning), or secondary concerns.
# Therefore, D is the correct choice.

answer = 'D'
# The final answer is a single character.
# According to the instructions, I should not ask the user to copy/paste, so I will just print the answer letter.
# The instruction "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!" seems to be a leftover template instruction that doesn't apply here, as there is no equation. I will ignore it and provide the letter answer.
