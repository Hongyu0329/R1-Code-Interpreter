The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. Now Petya wants to compare those two strings lexicographically.

    "Of course! Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by a Python solution and the answer to your specific question about the C program's memory usage.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Solve the Problem with Python:** First, I will write a Python script to solve the string comparison problem. The script will read the two input strings, convert them to a consistent case (lowercase), and then perform a lexicographical comparison to produce the required output (-1, 0, or 1).\n2.  **Analyze the C Program for Memory Efficiency:** For the second part of your request, I will determine the most memory-efficient way to solve this in C. The optimal C approach would be to read the first string into a buffer and then read the second string one character at a time, comparing it on-the-fly with the buffered string. This avoids allocating memory for the second string.\n3.  **Calculate Memory Usage (m):** I will calculate the total memory (`m`) required for the variables in this optimized C program. This includes the buffer for the first string, a loop counter, and a variable to hold the character from the second string. To be as memory-efficient as possible, I will select the smallest standard C data types that can hold the required values. The final answer `m` will be the sum of the sizes of these variables in bytes.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads two strings, compares them lexicographically ignoring case,\n    and prints -1, 1, or 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the first string from standard input.\n    s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Read the second string from standard input.\n    s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n    s1_lower = s1.lower()\n    s2_lower = s2.lower()\n    \n    # Perform the lexicographical comparison and print the result.\n    if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n        print(\"-1\")\n    elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n        print(\"1\")\n    else:\n        print(\"0\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n### C Program Memory Analysis\n\nFor the most memory-efficient C program, we would use the following variables:\n1.  A character array to store the first string: `char s1[101];` (100 characters + 1 for the null terminator). This uses `101 * sizeof(char)` = 101 bytes.\n2.  An index variable to loop through the strings. Since the length is at most 100, a `char` is sufficient for the counter: `char i;`. This uses `1 * sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n3.  A variable to read each character of the second string: `char c2;`. This uses `1 * sizeof(char)` = 1 byte.\n\nThe total memory `m` for variables is the sum of these sizes: 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
