    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from $[n]$ to $[m]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [n] \\to [m]$ and $g: [m] \\to [n]$, that form a Galois connection. This means that for any $i \\in [n]$ and $j \\in [m]$, the relation $f(i) \\le j$ is equivalent to $i \\le g(j)$.\n\nSuch a pair of maps $(f,g)$ is uniquely determined by either one of the maps.\n1.  An order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a left adjoint (i.e., has a right adjoint partner $g$) if and only if $f(0)=0$.\n2.  An order-preserving map $g: [m] \\to [n]$ is a right adjoint (i.e., has a left adjoint partner $f$) if and only if $g(m)=n$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: [n] \\to [m]$ such that $f(0)=0$, with $n=23$ and $m=37$.\nAn order-preserving map is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(n)$. The condition is $0 \\le f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(n) \\le m$.\nWith the constraint $f(0)=0$, we are looking for the number of non-decreasing sequences:\n$0 \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. We need to choose 23 values for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ from the set of integers $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, with replacement allowed. The number of available integer values is $37 - 0 + 1 = 38$.\nThis is a \"stars and bars\" problem, and the number of such sequences is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{k+N-1}{k}$, where $k$ is the length of the sequence and $N$ is the number of values to choose from.\nHere, $k=n=23$ and $N=m+1=38$.\nThe total number is $\\binom{23 + 38 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\nAlternatively, the general formula for the number of such adjunctions from $[n]$ to $[m]$ is $\\binom{n+m}{n}$. For $n=23, m=37$, this is $\\binom{23+37}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find the number of internal adjunctions from [n] to [m].\n# For the given problem, we have:\nn = 23\nm = 37\n\n# The number of such adjunctions is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+m, n).\n# Here, we calculate C(23+37, 23) = C(60, 23).\ncomb_n = n + m\ncomb_k = n\n\n# Printing the numbers that go into the final equation as requested.\nprint(f\"The number of internal adjunctions from [{n}] to [{m}] is being calculated.\")\nprint(f\"This is equivalent to the binomial coefficient C({comb_n}, {comb_k}).\")\n\n# Calculate the binomial coefficient using math.comb\nresult = math.comb(comb_n, comb_k)\n\nprint(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<4642230635640>>>"
