# The problem is to find the number of internal adjunctions from [n] to [m].
# For the given problem, we have:
n = 23
m = 37

# The number of such adjunctions is given by the binomial coefficient C(n+m, n).
# Here, we calculate C(23+37, 23) = C(60, 23).
comb_n = n + m
comb_k = n

# Printing the numbers that go into the final equation as requested.
print(f"The number of internal adjunctions from [{n}] to [{m}] is being calculated.")
print(f"This is equivalent to the binomial coefficient C({comb_n}, {comb_k}).")

# Calculate the binomial coefficient using math.comb
result = math.comb(comb_n, comb_k)

print(f"The result is: {result}")
