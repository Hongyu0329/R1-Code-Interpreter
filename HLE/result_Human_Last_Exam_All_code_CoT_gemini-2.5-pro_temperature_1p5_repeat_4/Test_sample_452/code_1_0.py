    This function calculates the constant 'b' in the asymptotic formula C(n) ~ b * n^(3/2).
    
    The problem statement suggests C(n) is the expected cover-and-return time, but its
    known asymptotic behavior (scaling as n^(5/2)) contradicts the formula given.
    
    A more plausible interpretation that matches the n^(3/2) scaling is that C(n)
    represents the expected hitting time between two fixed vertices in a uniform random tree.
    
    The derivation is as follows:
    1. E[H(i,j)] = (n-1) * E[d(i,j)], where H is hitting time and d is distance.
    2. E[d(i,j)] ~ sqrt(pi * n / 2) for large n.
    3. E[H(i,j)] ~ (n-1) * sqrt(pi * n / 2)
                 ~ n * sqrt(pi * n / 2)
                 ~ sqrt(pi / 2) * n^(3/2)
    
    Therefore, the constant b = sqrt(pi / 2).
