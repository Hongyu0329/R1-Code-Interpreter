    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Manifold:** The non-Grassman (bosonic) variables of the supersymmetric sigma-model parametrize a specific mathematical space. For disordered systems of symmetry class D, this space is the symmetric space `G/H = O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n))`, where `n` is the number of replicas.\n2.  **Determine the Number of Variables:** The number of variables needed to parametrize this space is equal to its dimension. The dimension of such a space (`G/H`) is calculated as `dim(G) - dim(H)`.\n3.  **Calculate Dimensions of the Groups:**\n    *   The dimension of the orthogonal group `O(k)` is given by the formula `dim(O(k)) = k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n    *   We will calculate `dim(G) = dim(O(2n))`.\n    *   We will calculate `dim(H) = dim(O(n) x O(n))`, which is `dim(O(n)) + dim(O(n))`.\n4.  **Substitute and Solve:** We will substitute the given number of replicas, `n=2`, into the formulas, calculate the dimensions, and find the final result by subtraction.\n5.  **Present the Final Equation:** The final output will explicitly show the calculation `dim(O(4)) - dim(O(2)xO(2))` with the resulting numerical values.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\n# Number of replicas for the disordered system\nn = 2\n\n# The number of non-Grassman variables is the dimension of the bosonic manifold.\n# For symmetry class D, this is the symmetric space G/H = O(2n)/(O(n)xO(n)).\n# The dimension is calculated as dim(G) - dim(H).\n\n# 1.
