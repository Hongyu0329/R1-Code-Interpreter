# Plan:
# 1. Identify the field K based on the description.
#    - K is a complete discretely valued field (CDVF) of characteristic 2.
#    - Its residue field, let's call it k, is a local field of characteristic 2.
#    - A local field of characteristic 2 is a field of formal Laurent series over a finite field, so k = F_q((t)) for q=2^m.
#    - A CDVF K with residue field k, where char(K)=char(k), is isomorphic to a field of formal Laurent series k((S)), where S is the uniformizer.
#    - So, K = F_q((t))((S)).

# 2. Determine the property of the requested number N.
#    - The number N is the smallest integer such that any anisotropic quadratic form of dimension N is universal (surjective onto K).
#    - The u-invariant of a field, u(K), is the maximum possible dimension of an anisotropic quadratic form over K.
#    - By definition of the u-invariant, there are no anisotropic quadratic forms of dimension greater than u(K).
#    - The statement "for every anisotropic quadratic form Q of dimension N, Q is universal" is vacuously true if the set of anisotropic quadratic forms of dimension N is empty.
#    - This happens for any N > u(K).
#    - The smallest such natural number N is therefore u(K) + 1.

# 3. Calculate the u-invariant of K.
#    - We need to find u(K) for K = k((S)) where k = F_q((t)).
#    - A known theorem for Henselian fields of characteristic 2 states that u(F((T))) = 2 * u(F) if the residue field F is not "2-closed" (which k is not).
#    - So, u(K) = 2 * u(k).
#    - Now we need the u-invariant of k = F_q((t)). This is a standard local field of characteristic 2.
#    - The u-invariant of a local field of characteristic 2 is 4.
#    - Therefore, u(k) = 4.

# 4. Final Calculation.
#    - u(K) = 2 * u(k) = 2 * 4 = 8.
#    - N = u(K) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9.
# The code will print out these steps and the final result.
