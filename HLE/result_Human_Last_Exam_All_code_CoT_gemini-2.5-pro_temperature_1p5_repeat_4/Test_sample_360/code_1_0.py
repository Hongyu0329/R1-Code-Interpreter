# Step 1: Define the problem.
# We need to find the number of isomers formed when the tetradentate ligand (L)
# 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole reacts with the complex
# cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), or cis-[Ru(bpy)2(Cl)2].

# Step 2: Determine the product.
# The tetradentate ligand L will replace four ligands from the Ru complex.
# The most likely product is [Ru(L)(bpy)]^2+, where L replaces the two Cl-
# ligands and one bpy ligand.

# Step 3: Analyze the geometric isomerism of the product [Ru(L)(bpy)]^2+.
# The ligand L is planar and rigid, forcing it into the equatorial plane
# of the octahedral Ru center. The bpy ligand must then occupy the axial positions.
# This leads to only one possible geometric arrangement.
number_of_geometric_isomers = 1

# Step 4: Analyze the stereoisomerism (chirality) of the product.
# A molecule is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image.
# The coordinated bipyridine (bpy) ligand is twisted, not flat.
# This twist in the axial bpy ligand makes the entire [Ru(L)(bpy)]^2+ complex chiral.
# Chiral molecules exist as a pair of enantiomers.

# Step 5: Calculate the total number of isomers.
# Total isomers = (Number of geometric isomers) * (Number of stereoisomers per geometric isomer)
# In this case, there is 1 geometric isomer, and it exists as a pair (2) of enantiomers.
total_isomers = 1 * 2
