    This function explains the solution to the set theory problem.

    Let S be a collection of infinite subsets of omega, |S| < 2^omega.
    If the continuum hypothesis (CH) is true, does there always exist
    an infinite subset x of omega such that for every s in S, the
    intersection of x and s is finite?

The answer to the question is YES. Such a set x always exists. Here is the step-by-step proof.

Step 1: Apply the Continuum Hypothesis (CH)
The problem states that S is a collection of infinite subsets of the natural numbers (omega) and that its cardinality |S| is less than 2^omega.
The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) states that 2^omega = aleph_1, the first uncountable cardinal.
The condition |S| < 2^omega, combined with CH, implies that |S| < aleph_1.
Since the cardinality of a set must be a cardinal number, this means |S| is at most aleph_0.
Therefore, S is a countable (or finite) collection of sets. We can enumerate its elements as S = {s_0, s_1, s_2, ...}.

Step 2: Rephrase the Problem
With CH, the question becomes: Given a countable collection {s_0, s_1, s_2, ...} of infinite subsets of omega, can we find an infinite set x such that for all i in {0, 1, 2, ...}, the intersection |x intersect s_i| is finite?

Step 3: The Construction of Set x
We will construct the set x = {x_0, x_1, x_2, ...} by choosing its elements one by one, ensuring they form a strictly increasing sequence, which guarantees x is infinite. The construction uses a diagonalization method.

First, for each integer k >= 0, let's define a helper set C_k as follows:
C_k = intersect_{i=0 to k} (omega \\ s_i)
This is the set of all natural numbers that are NOT in s_0, NOT in s_1, ..., AND NOT in s_k.

Each set s_i is infinite, so its complement (omega \\ s_i) is also infinite (it is co-infinite). The intersection of a finite number of co-infinite sets is also co-infinite. Therefore, each set C_k is an infinite set.

Now, we can define the elements of x recursively:
- Choose x_0 as the smallest natural number in C_0.
- Choose x_1 as the smallest natural number in C_1 such that x_1 > x_0.
- Choose x_2 as the smallest natural number in C_2 such that x_2 > x_1.
- In general, for each k > 0, we choose x_k to be the smallest number in C_k such that x_k > x_{k-1}.

Since each C_k is infinite, we can always find such an x_k. This process gives us an infinite, strictly increasing sequence of numbers, so the set x = {x_0, x_1, x_2, ...} is an infinite subset of omega.

Step 4: Verify the Construction
We must show that for any j >= 0, the intersection |x intersect s_j| is finite.

Let's fix an arbitrary j from {0, 1, 2, ...}.
Consider any element x_k in x where the index k is greater than or equal to j (i.e., k >= j).
By our construction, x_k was chosen from the set C_k.
By definition, C_k = intersect_{i=0 to k} (omega \\ s_i).
Since k >= j, the intersection defining C_k includes the set (omega \\ s_j).
Therefore, x_k must be an element of (omega \\ s_j), which means x_k is NOT in s_j.

This proves that no element of x from x_j onwards (i.e., x_j, x_{j+1}, ...) is in the set s_j.
The only elements of x that could possibly be in s_j are the first j elements: {x_0, x_1, ..., x_{j-1}}.
So, the intersection (x intersect s_j) must be a subset of the finite set {x_0, x_1, ..., x_{j-1}}.
This implies that |x intersect s_j| <= j.

Since j is a finite number, the intersection is finite. As this holds for any j, the set x satisfies the required property for all sets in S.

Step 5: Conclusion
Yes, under the Continuum Hypothesis, for any collection S of infinite subsets of omega with |S| < 2^omega, there always exists an infinite set x that is almost disjoint from every set in S.
