    """
    Calculates the force F required to lift a rope of mass m and length l,
    such that the top end has velocity v when the bottom end leaves the ground.

    The derivation is as follows:
    1.  Assume the top of the rope undergoes constant acceleration 'a' from rest.
        Using kinematics, v^2 = 0^2 + 2*a*l, which gives a = v^2 / (2*l).
    2.  The net force on the rope is F_net = F_applied - F_gravity = F - m*g.
    3.  By Newton's second law, F_net = m * a_CoM, where a_CoM is the acceleration
        of the rope's center of mass.
    4.  Assuming a linear velocity profile along the rope (v(y) = (y/l)*v_top), the
        center of mass acceleration is a_CoM = a / 2.
    5.  Substituting a from step 1 into a_CoM: a_CoM = (v^2 / (2*l)) / 2 = v^2 / (4*l).
    6.  Combining equations: F - m*g = m * a_CoM = m * (v^2 / (4*l)).
    7.  Solving for F: F = m*g + (m * v^2) / (4 * l).
