    "To solve this problem, I will determine the number of syntactically valid boolean expressions of exactly length 5. The phrase \"true boolean expressions\" is interpreted as \"syntactically valid\" rather than \"expressions that evaluate to True\", as the latter would be a significantly more complex problem and usually stated more explicitly.\n\nMy approach uses dynamic programming based on a formal grammar that respects the given operator precedence (`! > & > |`). I will define categories of expressions based on their top-level operator and build up the counts for expressions of length 1 through 5.\n\nThe grammar can be defined as follows, in increasing order of operator precedence:\n1.  `E` (Expression): The most general type. Can be an `O` or an `E | O` (OR expression). This makes `|` left-associative and lowest precedence.\n2.  `O` (OR-precedence): Can be an `A` or an `O & A` (AND expression). This makes `&` left-associative and higher precedence than `|`.\n3.  `A` (AND-precedence): Can be an `F` or `! A` (NOT expression). This makes `!` prefix and highest precedence.\n4.  `F` (Factor): The atomic units, which are `T`, `F`, or a fully parenthesized expression `( E )`.\n\nLet `e[k]`, `o[k]`, `a[k]`, and `f[k]` be the number of valid expressions of length `k` for types `E`, `O`, `A`, and `F` respectively. I will compute these values iteratively for `k` from 1 to 5. The final answer will be `e[5]`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this dynamic programming solution and prints the step-by-step calculation to arrive at the final number.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of valid boolean expressions of length 5 using dynamic programming.\n    The method is based on a precedence-climbing grammar to count syntactically valid expressions.\n\n    The grammar is defined as:\n    E -> E | O | O  (Lowest precedence operator: |)\n    O -> O & A | A   (Middle precedence operator: &)\n    A -> !
