    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating geographical trivia question. To solve this, one would need to use a mapping service with satellite imagery.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the two schools mentioned: Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa, Italy.\n2.  Use a mapping tool (like Google Maps or OpenStreetMap) to locate them. They are indeed adjacent.\n3.  Switch to the satellite/aerial view to observe the shapes of the building footprints.\n4.  Analyze the combined shape of the two main buildings and any connecting structures.\n5.  The Python code below will simulate this process by explaining the steps and printing the final observation and conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pisa_highschool_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the steps to find the letter formed by two high schools\n    in Pisa when viewed from above.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    school_1 = \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\"\n    school_2 = \"Istituto Ulisse Dini\"\n\n    print(f\"Task: To determine the letter shape formed by the buildings of two high schools in Pisa.\")\n    print(f\"School 1: {school_1}\")\n    print(f\"School 2: {school_2}\")\n    print(\"\\nMethod:\")\n    print(\"1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In Pisa there are multiple highschools.
