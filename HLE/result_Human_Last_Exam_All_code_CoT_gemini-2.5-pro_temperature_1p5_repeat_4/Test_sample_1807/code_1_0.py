        'A. Genetic load': "Incorrect. Genetic load is the reduced fitness of a population due to deleterious alleles. While some deleterious alleles might be on sex chromosomes, genetic load itself is a measure of fitness, not a direct cause of allele frequency differentiation (Fst).",
        'B. XY vs ZW sex determining systems': "Correct. This is the most direct cause. In these systems, sexes have different chromosome compositions:\n"
                                           "   - XY System (e.g., humans): Males are XY, Females are XX. Any marker on the Y chromosome will only be found in males, leading to an Fst of 1. Markers on the X chromosome also differ in copy number (1 in males, 2 in females), which can cause Fst > 0.\n"
                                           "   - ZW System (e.g., birds): Females are ZW, Males are ZZ. Any marker on the W chromosome will only be found in females, leading to an Fst of 1.\n"
                                           "   - In both cases, markers on autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) would show Fst â‰ˆ 0. This perfectly explains why only 'some markers' exhibit high differentiation.",
        'C. Reproductive isolation': "Incorrect. Males and females within a single population are, by definition, NOT reproductively isolated. They must interbreed for the population to exist.",
        'D. Local adaptation to thermal environments': "Incorrect. Local adaptation explains differentiation between populations living in different environments. It does not explain genetic differentiation between sexes that share the same environment and interbreed.",
        'E. Hybrid zone dynamics': "Incorrect. A hybrid zone is where two genetically distinct populations meet and interbreed. The question describes a single, panmictic population."
