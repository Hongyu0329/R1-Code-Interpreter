    **Analysis Plan**

    1.  **Translate Standard Continuity to Nonstandard Terms:** The core of the problem is to find the nonstandard analysis equivalent of the standard (epsilon-delta) definition of continuity.
    2.  **Analyze Each Option:** Each option will be evaluated against this nonstandard definition. Key distinctions, like that between continuity and uniform continuity, will be highlighted.
    3.  **Conclude:** The option that perfectly matches the derived nonstandard definition of continuity will be chosen.

    **Step-by-step Derivations**

    *   **Standard Definition of Continuity:** A function `f` is continuous at a standard point `x₀` if for any open neighborhood `V` of `f(x₀)`, there is an open neighborhood `U` of `x₀` such that `f(U) ⊆ V`. The function is continuous on the space `X` if it is continuous at every point `x₀ ∈ X`.

    *   **Nonstandard Equivalent:** In nonstandard analysis, the concept of an open neighborhood is captured by the "monad". The monad of a standard point `p`, denoted `μ(p)`, is the set of all points `x*` (standard or nonstandard) that are infinitesimally close to `p` (written `x* ~ p`).
    The definition of continuity at a standard point `x₀` is equivalent to stating that the function `f` maps the monad of `x₀` into the monad of `f(x₀)`. Symbolically: `f(μ(x₀)) ⊆ μ(f(x₀))`.
    This means: for any point `x₁` in the nonstandard space `X*`, if `x₁ ~ x₀`, then it must be that `f(x₁) ~ f(x₀)`. For `f` to be continuous on all of `X`, this must hold for every standard point `x₀ ∈ X`.

    *   **Evaluating the Choices:**

        **A. ∀ x₀, x₁ ∈ X: x₀ ~ x₁ ⇒ f(x₀) ~ f(x₁)**
        This only involves standard points. Two distinct standard points are never infinitesimally close, so `x₀ ~ x₁` means `x₀ = x₁`. This makes the statement trivially true for any function and doesn't describe continuity.

        **B. ∀ x₀ ∈ X, ∀ x₁ ∈ X*: x₀ ~ x₁ ⇒ f(x₀) ~ f(x₁)**
        This precisely matches our derived nonstandard definition. It says for any standard point `x₀`, any point `x₁` infinitesimally close to it is mapped to a point infinitesimally close to `f(x₀)`. This is the definition of continuity.

        **C. ∀ x₀, x₁ ∈ X*: x₀ ~ x₁ ⇒ f(x₀) ~ f(x₁)**
        This is a stronger condition. It must hold for *any* infinitesimally close pair, including nonstandard points far from any standard point. This is the nonstandard definition of **uniform continuity**. Since continuity and uniform continuity are not the same, this is incorrect.

        **D, E, F.** These options state the reverse implication (`f(x₀) ~ f(x₁) ⇒ x₀ ~ x₁`). They are related to injectivity (a function being one-to-one), not continuity. For example, a constant function `f(x) = c` is continuous but fails these conditions.

    **Conclusion**

    The property that is equivalent to `f` being a continuous map is the one that captures the behavior near every standard point, which is option B.
