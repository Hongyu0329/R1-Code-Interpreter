# The problem contains a hidden puzzle within option D.
# Option D mentions "FIPS 140-3 Level 5", which is a non-existent security level.
# This option provides the numbers 140, 3, and 5.
# The prompt requires generating code that uses these numbers in an equation.
# The dash in "140-3" suggests subtraction. We will assume subtraction for the entire expression
# for a simple and consistent interpretation.

# Assign the numbers to variables
num1 = 140
num2 = 3
num3 = 5

# Perform the calculation
result = num1 - num2 - num3

# Print the equation and the result as requested.
# The instruction is to "output each number in the final equation!".
print(f"{num1} - {num2} - {num3} = {result}")
