# Step 1: Define the given probabilities from the problem description.
# Probability that a vertical edge is deleted.
prob_v_del = Fraction(1, 2)
# Probability that an upper horizontal edge is deleted.
prob_h_del = Fraction(1, 3)

# The probability that a vertical edge is kept is needed for the calculation.
prob_v_kept = 1 - prob_v_del

# Step 2: Formulate the asymptotic speed v based on the analysis.
# The logic described in the plan leads to the formula: v = 1 / (2 - p_v_kept),
# where p_v_kept is the probability of a vertical edge being kept.
# Let's calculate the numerator and denominator for this formula.
numerator = 1
denominator = 2 - prob_v_kept

# Step 3: Compute the final speed.
v = numerator / denominator

# Step 4: Print the calculation step-by-step.
