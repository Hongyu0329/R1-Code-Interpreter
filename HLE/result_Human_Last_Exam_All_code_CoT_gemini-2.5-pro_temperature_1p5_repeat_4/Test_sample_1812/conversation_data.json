    "To compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Matrix:** The matrix `A` is given as:\n    ```\n    [[ 2, -1, -1],\n     [-1,  2, -1],\n     [-1, -1,  2]]\n    ```\n2.  **Recall the Determinant Formula:** The determinant of a 3x3 matrix `[[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]` is calculated using the formula:\n    `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`\n3.  **Create a Python Script:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Uses the `numpy` library, which is standard for matrix operations.\n    *   Defines the matrix `A`.\n    *   Prints the formula and substitutes the numbers from matrix `A` into it, as requested.\n    *   Calculates and prints the final determinant.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix A\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# Extract the elements for the equation printout\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Calculate the determinant using numpy\ndeterminant = np.linalg.det(A)\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers\nprint(\"The determinant is calculated using the formula: a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\nprint(\"Substituting the values from the matrix:\")\nprint(f\"Determinant = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\nprint(f\"Determinant = ({a}) * ({e*i - f*h}) + {-b} * ({d*i - f*g}) + ({c}) * ({d*h - e*g})\")\nprint(f\"Determinant = {a * (e*i - f*h)} + {-b * (d*i - f*g)} + {c * (d*h - e*g)}\")\nprint(f\"Determinant = {int(round(determinant))}\")\n\n<<<0>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
