    Solves the peg game problem by finding the number of equivalence classes.

    The problem can be modeled by categorizing peg positions into 4 types
    based on the parity of their coordinates. Moves in the game define a
    "reducibility" relationship between these types. An equivalence class
    corresponds to a "minimal" set of types that cannot be reduced further.
    These minimal sets are the independent sets of a graph representing the
    reducibility relationships.

    The graph has 4 vertices (the types) and edges connecting types that can
    be reduced by a game move. The number of non-empty independent sets of this
    graph equals the number of equivalence classes.
