    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function `Z` for a system is given by a functional integral over all possible field configurations `ϕ`. For a neutral scalar field, this is `Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S[ϕ])`, where `S[ϕ]` is the Euclidean action. The inner product you're asking about, `(ϕ, Dϕ)`, is a key component of this action.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **The Euclidean Action (S[ϕ]):** For a free, neutral scalar field `ϕ` with mass `m` in a `(d+1)`-dimensional Euclidean spacetime (d spatial dimensions + 1 imaginary time dimension `τ`), the action is:\n    `S[ϕ] = ∫ dτ d^d x [ (1/2)(∂_τ ϕ)² + (1/2)(∇ϕ)² + (1/2)m²ϕ² ]`\n    Here, `(∂_τ ϕ)²` is the kinetic term in the imaginary time direction, and `(∇ϕ)²` is the kinetic term in the spatial directions. The integral is performed over `τ` from `0` to `β = 1/T` (where `T` is the temperature) and over all of d-dimensional space.\n\n2.  **The Operator (D):** The action is a quadratic form in the fields. We can express it as `S[ϕ] = (1/2) ∫ dτ d^d x ϕ(x,τ) D ϕ(x,τ)`. To find the explicit form of the operator `D`, we can perform an integration by parts on the derivative terms in the action. Assuming the field vanishes at spatial infinity and is periodic in imaginary time, the boundary terms are zero. This gives:\n    `S[ϕ] = (1/2) ∫ dτ d^d x ϕ [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ`\n    From this, we identify the operator `D` as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n    `D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²`\n\n3.  **The Inner Product (ϕ, Dϕ):** In this functional space, the inner product of two functions `A` and `B` is defined as `(A, B) = ∫ dτ d^d x A(x,τ)B(x,τ)`. Therefore, the inner product `(ϕ, Dϕ)` is:\n    `(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫ dτ d^d x ϕ * (Dϕ) = ∫ dτ d^d x ϕ [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ`\n    By comparing this with the expression for the action in step 2, we see that `(ϕ, Dϕ) = 2 * S[ϕ]`.\n\n4.  **Final Expression:** Substituting the original form of the action from step 1, we get the final expression for the inner product:\n    `(ϕ, Dϕ) = 2 * ∫ dτ d^d x [ (1/2)(∂_τ ϕ)² + (1/2)(∇ϕ)² + (1/2)m²ϕ² ]`\n    Which simplifies to:\n    `(ϕ, Dϕ) = ∫ dτ d^d x [ (∂_τ ϕ)² + (∇ϕ)² + m²ϕ² ]`\n\nThis expression represents the inner product. The following Python code uses the `sympy` library to symbolically represent and print the integrand of this expression.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef display_inner_product_integrand():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses the sympy library to symbolically represent the integrand\n    of the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) for a neutral scalar field.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the symbols required for the expression\n    # m is the mass of the field\n    m = sp.Symbol('m', real=True)\n    \n    # τ represents imaginary time\n    tau = sp.Symbol('τ', real=True)\n    \n    # ϕ is the scalar field, represented as a function.
