    # Step 1: Analyze the relationship between knowledge and perceived gaps.
    # The prompt states the self-stabilizing effect is "driven by the increasing number of knowledge gaps that open up".
    # This implies that as we learn, we become more aware of what we don't know.

    # Step 2: Evaluate the learning phases in the context of this relationship.
    # Early Phase: A learner has limited knowledge and is often unaware of the breadth and depth of the topic.
    # They "don't know what they don't know." Thus, the number of *perceived* knowledge gaps is low.
    # This makes option B incorrect, as the effect would be weak, not strongest.

    # Late Phase: A learner has "comprehensive knowledge" and understands "complex relationships."
    # This strong foundation is the perfect platform from which to see subtle connections and identify numerous, more advanced questions (knowledge gaps).
    # An expert can see far more areas for inquiry than a novice. Therefore, the number of perceived gaps is highest here.

    # Step 3: Conclude based on the analysis.
    # The effect is driven by the number of gaps. The number of perceived gaps is highest when a learner has a strong enough foundation to see them.
    # This occurs in the late learning phase, as described in the prompt. Therefore, the effect peaks in this phase.
    # Option C states this directly.
    # Option A is too general and doesn't account for a peak.
    # Option E is incorrect because the effect is not constant.

    correct_answer = 'C'
    explanation = """
The correct statement is C. Here's the reasoning:
- The 'self-stabilizing effect' is fueled by the discovery of knowledge gaps.
- In the Early Learning Phase, a learner lacks the foundational knowledge to even perceive most gaps. You don't know what you don't know, so the effect is weak. This rules out B.
- In the Late Learning Phase, a learner possesses 'comprehensive knowledge' and understands 'complex relationships.' This deep understanding is exactly what allows them to identify a greater number of more subtle and complex knowledge gaps, thus fueling their interest and curiosity. The effect, therefore, peaks when the learner's knowledge base is strong enough to support the discovery of the most new questions. This supports C.
- Statement A is a less precise generalization, while statement E contradicts the core definition.
