    "To determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we first need to know the point groups associated with each of the 17 wallpaper groups. The point group of a wallpaper group describes the symmetries (like rotations and reflections) of the pattern that leave at least one point fixed. The order of a group is the number of distinct symmetry operations in it.\n\nThe two-dimensional crystallographic point groups of order 2 are:\n1.  **C2**: Contains the identity and a 180-degree rotation.\n2.  **Cs (or Cm)**: Contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Create a mapping of each of the 17 wallpaper groups to the order of its corresponding point group.\n2.  Iterate through this mapping and identify all the groups whose point group order is 2.\n3.  Count these identified groups.\n4.  Display the names of the qualifying groups and print the final count, showing the summation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each wallpaper group to the order of its point group.\n    wallpaper_group_point_group_orders = {\n        # Oblique lattice\n        'p1': 1, 'p2': 2,\n        # Rectangular lattice\n        'pm': 2, 'pg': 2, 'cm': 2,\n        'p2mm': 4, 'p2mg': 4, 'p2gg': 4, 'c2mm': 4,\n        # Square lattice\n        'p4': 4, 'p4mm': 8, 'p4gm': 8,\n        # Hexagonal lattice\n        'p3': 3, 'p3m1': 6, 'p31m': 6,\n        'p6': 6, 'p6mm': 12\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    found_groups = []\n\n    # Find all groups with a point group of the target order\n    for group, order in wallpaper_group_point_group_orders.items():\n        if order == target_order:\n            found_groups.append(group)\n    \n    count = len(found_groups)\n    \n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order} are: {', '.join(found_groups)}.\")\n    \n    # Create the equation string as requested\n    if count > 0:\n        equation_parts = [\"1\" for _ in found_groups]\n        equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n        print(f\"The final count is derived from the equation: {equation_str} = {count}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No wallpaper groups found with the specified point group order.\")\n\n    print(f\"Total number of wallpaper groups with point group of order {target_order} is: {count}\")\n\ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
