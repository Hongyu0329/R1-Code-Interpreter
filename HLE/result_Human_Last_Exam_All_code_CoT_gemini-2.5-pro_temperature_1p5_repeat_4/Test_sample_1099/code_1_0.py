# Step 1: Define the CHSH correlation bounds for different models.

# For a Local Hidden Variable (LHV) model, the maximum CHSH score is 2.
S_classical = 2.0

# For a quantum model with a singlet state, the maximum is 2*sqrt(2) (Tsirelson's bound).
S_quantum = 2 * math.sqrt(2)

# For a non-signaling PR-Box, the maximum is 4.
S_pr_box = 4.0

# Step 2: Set up the equation to find the required resource amount 'p'.
# We model the quantum score as a probabilistic mixture of a PR-Box and a classical model:
# S_quantum = p * S_pr_box + (1 - p) * S_classical
#
# Rearranging to solve for p:
# p * (S_pr_box - S_classical) = S_quantum - S_classical
# p = (S_quantum - S_classical) / (S_pr_box - S_classical)

# Step 3: Calculate 'p', the minimal average amount of PR-Box resource.
p = (S_quantum - S_classical) / (S_pr_box - S_classical)

# Step 4: Print the results, including the full equation with numerical values.
# This value 'p' represents the fraction of a PR-box needed on average.
# Assuming a PR-box is equivalent to 1 bit of communication as a resource,
# 'p' also quantifies the required communication in bits for this simulation.
