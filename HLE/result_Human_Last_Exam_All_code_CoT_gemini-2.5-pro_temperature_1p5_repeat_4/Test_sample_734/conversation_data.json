    "The theologian who first developed a systematic and influential framework for this concept is Augustine of Hippo.\n\nIn works like *De Genesi ad Litteram* (On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis), Augustine articulated a sophisticated view of God's relationship with the natural world. He did not use the modern term \"laws of nature,\" but he wrote extensively about the *ordo naturae* (the order of nature).\n\nHis key ideas that apply here are:\n\n1.  **The State of Creation Before and After the Fall:** Augustine proposed that the natural order was different before the Fall of Man. The post-Fall world, with its suffering, decay, death, and hardships (like thorns and thistles), operates under a different set of conditions—a \"penal arrangement\"—than the one originally intended by God in Eden. This is a direct argument for an alteration in the functioning of the natural world as a result of a specific event.\n\n2.  ***Rationes Seminales* (Seminal Reasons/Causes):** Augustine theorized that God embedded \"seminal reasons\" into creation from the very beginning. These are the latent potentialities for all things that would ever come into being. Most things unfold according to the regular, observable \"order of nature.\" However, a miracle, like the virgin birth, is not a violation of the ultimate creative order, but rather God choosing to activate a \"seminal reason\" outside of the usual, predictable sequence of cause and effect. In this way, the virgin birth was a possibility woven into creation by God from the start, but manifested at a specific time by divine will, distinct from the normal course of biological reproduction.\n\nThis framework provided a way to understand both a fundamental shift in the natural world (at the Fall) and unique divine interventions (like the virgin birth) without making God seem arbitrary or contradictory to His own creation.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
