    "This sequence is quite tricky and appears to be based on a famous mathematical puzzle. The rule isn't a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. After analyzing the sequence, I've identified a likely underlying pattern, although the provided sequence seems to have some inconsistencies compared to the original puzzle's definition. The most probable rule is that the next term is calculated by adding the sum of the current term's digits and the product of the current term's digits to the current term itself.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to find the next number:\n1.  Take the last number in the sequence, which is `2352`.\n2.  Calculate the sum of its digits (SoD).\n3.  Calculate the product of its digits (PoD).\n4.  The next number in the sequence will be `current number + SoD + PoD`.\n5.  I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final result along with the equation.\n\nLet's apply this to the last number, `2352`:\n*   Sum of digits: `2 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 12`\n*   Product of digits: `2 * 3 * 5 * 2 = 60`\n*   Next number: `2352 + 12 + 60 = 2424`\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the next number in a sequence based on a specific rule.\n    The rule is: a_{n+1} = a_n + sum_of_digits(a_n) + product_of_digits(a_n).\n    \"\"\"\n    current_number = 2352\n    \n    # Convert the number to a string to iterate through its digits.\n    s_number = str(current_number)\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of digits.\n    sum_of_digits = 0\n    for digit in s_number:\n        sum_of_digits += int(digit)\n        \n    # Calculate the product of digits.\n    product_of_digits = 1\n    for digit in s_number:\n        product_of_digits *= int(digit)\n        \n    # Calculate the next number.\n    next_number = current_number + sum_of_digits + product_of_digits\n    \n    # Print the equation and the final answer.\n    print(f\"The last number is {current_number}.\")\n    print(f\"The sum of its digits is: \" + \" + \".join(s_number) + f\" = {sum_of_digits}\")\n    print(f\"The product of its digits is: \" + \" * \".join(s_number) + f\" = {product_of_digits}\")\n    print(f\"The next number is calculated as: {current_number} + {sum_of_digits} + {product_of_digits} = {next_number}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<2424>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
