    "Here is my plan to solve this chess puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position**: I will carefully examine the FEN `8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1`. The most critical feature is that White's queen on f2 is pinned to the king on g1 by Black's queen on c5.\n2.  **Identify legal moves for White**: Due to the absolute pin, White cannot move the queen. The only legal moves are with the king: `Kf1`, `Kg2`, and `Kh2`.\n3.  **Evaluate the consequences of each move**: I will analyze what happens after each of White's possible king moves. All these moves break the pin.\n4.  **Determine Black's optimal reply**: After White breaks the pin (e.g., with `1. Kg2`), White threatens `Qxc5+`. Black's best response is to immediately trade queens with `1... Qxf2+`.\n5.  **Analyze the resulting endgame**: After `1. Kg2 Qxf2+`, White must recapture with `2. Kxf2`. This leads to a King and Pawn endgame. I will analyze this endgame and determine that it is a forced win for Black. This is because Black's king is much more active and can capture White's key passed pawn on d6, after which Black's own d-pawn becomes the decisive factor.\n6.  **Conclude on the best move**: Since all of White's legal moves lead to the same forced loss against optimal play, any of them is technically the \"best\" move. I will select `Kg2` as a representative move.\n7.  **Construct the Python code**: I will write a Python script that explains this logic step-by-step using comments and `print` statements, clearly presenting the move sequence and the resulting outcome.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position from the FEN and determines White's best move.\n    \"\"\"\n    fen = \"8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze White's position.\n    # The White Queen on f2 is pinned by the Black Queen on c5.\n    # This means White's only legal moves are with the King.\n    legal_moves = [\"Kf1\", \"Kg2\", \"Kh2\"]\n    \n    # Step 2: Choose a candidate move and determine Black's optimal response.\n    # All king moves unpin the Queen.
