    "To determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players, we need to analyze the health scaling formula from Terraria's source code and consider the limitations of the game's data types.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Health Formula:** I will first state the formula used to calculate boss health in Terraria's Expert Mode, which scales based on the number of players.\n2.  **Define the Variables:** I will specify the base health for the Eye of Cthulhu and the scaling factor per additional player.\n3.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Scenario:** Mathematically, a linear scaling formula would result in infinite health for infinite players. However, the game's source code has practical limitations.\n4.  **Incorporate Source Code Limitations:** I will explain that NPC health in Terraria is stored as a 32-bit signed integer (`int`). This data type has a fixed maximum value, which acts as the true \"theoretical maximum\" within the context of the game's code.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** The python code will print the health scaling equation with the specific numbers for the Eye of Cthulhu, explain the data type limitation, and finally output the maximum possible health value.\n\n```python\ndef solve_terraria_health_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode, considering game engine limitations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Parameters from Terraria's source for Eye of Cthulhu (Expert Mode)\n    base_health = 3640\n    player_scaling_factor = 0.35\n\n    # The health increases by a fixed amount for each player after the first.\n    health_increase_per_player = int(base_health * player_scaling_factor)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Explain and print the health scaling equation ---\n    print(\"In Terraria's Expert Mode, boss health scales with the number of players, 'n'.\")\n    print(\"The formula is: Total Health = Base Health + (n - 1) * Health Increase Per Player\")\n    print(\"\\nFor the Eye of Cthulhu, the specific equation is:\")\n    # The user requested to output each number in the final equation.\n    # The equation for 'n' players is the most relevant one to show.\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_health} + (n - 1) * {health_increase_per_player}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Explain the implication of \"infinite players\" and the code limit ---\n    print(\"With the above formula, an infinite number of players would lead to infinite health.\")\n    print(\"\\nHowever, the question refers to the 'source code'. In Terraria's code, an NPC's health is stored as a 32-bit signed integer.\")\n    print(\"This data type has a hard-coded maximum value, which imposes the actual theoretical limit within the game engine.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Step 3: State the final answer ---\n    # The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer (System.Int32 in C#)\n    max_health_value = 2147483647\n\n    print(\"The final equation for the theoretical maximum health is therefore determined by this limit:\")\n    print(f\"Theoretical Maximum Health = {max_health_value}\")\n\n\nsolve_terraria_health_limit()\n```\n<<<2147483647>>>"
