    "Of all the noble gases, Radon (Rn) is the rarest. It is a radioactive gas that results from the decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. Its concentration in the atmosphere is extremely low and can be variable. We can use the standard accepted mean value for its volume fraction in the atmosphere to calculate the percentage. This atmospheric abundance is the most common way to measure the presence of such gases and serves as a good proxy for \"percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" The abundance levels would not have been significantly different in 2002.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify Radon (Rn) as the rarest noble gas.\n2.  Use its accepted mean volume fraction in the atmosphere, which is approximately 6 x 10⁻²⁰.\n3.  Write a Python script to convert this fraction into a percentage by multiplying it by 100.\n4.  The script will display the gas name and the final equation with all the numbers used in the calculation, as requested.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Identify the rarest noble gas. Radon (Rn) is the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n# 2. Define its abundance. We will use the mean atmospheric volume fraction, which is 6e-20.\n#    This value is stable over human timescales, so the value for 2002 is the same.\n# 3. Calculate the percentage by multiplying the fraction by 100.\n# 4. Print the name of the gas, the final calculation showing all numbers, and the result.\n\n# The rarest noble gas\nrarest_gas_name = \"Radon (Rn)\"\n\n# Its abundance as a volume fraction in the atmosphere\nvolume_fraction = 6e-20\n\n# The number to multiply by to get a percentage\nmultiplier = 100\n\n# The final calculation\npercentage = volume_fraction * multiplier\n\nprint(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is {rarest_gas_name}.\")\nprint(\"Its percentage, based on its mean volume fraction in the atmosphere, is calculated below.\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"Mean Volume Fraction: {volume_fraction}\")\nprint(f\"Multiplier: {multiplier}\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation: {volume_fraction} * {multiplier} = {percentage}\")\nprint(f\"-------------------------\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe percentage of Radon on Earth is approximately: {percentage}%\")\n```\n<<<6e-18>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was the rarest noble gas on Earth as as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
