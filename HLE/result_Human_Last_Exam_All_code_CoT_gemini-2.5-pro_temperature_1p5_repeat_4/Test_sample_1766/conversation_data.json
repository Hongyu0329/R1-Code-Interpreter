    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculations.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers**: For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l = 1`, and for any electron, the spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Find Total Angular Momentum (j)**: The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, is found by combining `l` and `s`. Its possible values range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Calculate Eigenvalues of JÂ²**: For each possible value of `j`, the eigenvalue of the operator $J^2$ is given by the formula $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$. We will calculate the coefficient `j(j+1)`.\n4.  **Find Magnetic Quantum Numbers (m_j)**: For each `j`, the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in steps of 1.\n5.  **Calculate Eigenvalues of J_z**: For each state defined by a `(j, m_j)` pair, the eigenvalue of the operator $J_z$ is given by $\\hbar m_j$. We will find the coefficient `m_j`.\n6.  **Output Results**: The code will systematically go through each possible state and print the common eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$, showing the calculations involved.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_p_electron_spin_orbit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z\n    for a spin-orbit coupling problem involving a p-electron.\n    Eigenvalues are expressed in units of hbar.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the orbital (l) and spin (s) quantum numbers.\n    l = 1.0  # For a p-electron, l=1\n    s = 0.5  # For an electron, s=1/2\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with orbital quantum number l = {l} and spin s = {s}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j.\n    # j ranges from |l - s| to l + s in integer steps.\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    \n    j_values = []\n    current_j = j_min\n    while current_j <= j_max:\n        j_values.append(current_j)\n        current_j += 1.0\n        \n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {j_values}\\n\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    # Iterate through each possible j value.\n    for j in j_values:\n        print(f\"Analyzing the case for j = {j}:\")\n\n        # Step 3: Calculate the eigenvalue of J^2.\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        print(f\"  The eigenvalue of J^2 is given by j(j+1)hbar^2.\")\n        print(f\"  Calculation: {j} * ({j} + 1) = {j_squared_eigenvalue}\")\n        print(f\"  So, the J^2 eigenvalue is {j_squared_eigenvalue}*hbar^2.\\n\")\n\n        # Step 4: Determine the possible values for the magnetic quantum number m_j.\n        # m_j ranges from -j to +j in integer steps.\n        m_j_values = []\n        current_m_j = -j\n        while current_m_j <= j:\n            m_j_values.append(current_m_j)\n            current_m_j += 1.0\n        \n        print(f\"  For j = {j}, the possible m_j values are: {m_j_values}\\n\")\n\n        # Step 5 & 6: For each state |j, m_j>, print the common eigenvalues.\n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            # The eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * hbar.\n            j_z_eigenvalue = m_j\n            print(f\"    * For the common eigenstate |j={j}, m_j={m_j}>:\")\n            print(f\"      - Eigenvalue of J^2 = {j_squared_eigenvalue}*hbar^2\")\n            print(f\"      - Eigenvalue of J_z = {j_z_eigenvalue}*hbar\")\n        \n        print(\"\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution.\nsolve_p_electron_spin_orbit()\n```"
