    "To identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Search Criteria:** The key parameters are:\n    *   **Nationality:** French\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** German U-boat (this includes both torpedoes and mines laid by U-boats).\n    *   **Timeframe:** From the start of WWII (September 3, 1939) to the armistice (June 22, 1940).\n    *   **Metric:** Largest by displacement. Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a measure of volume, is a common and reliable proxy for overall size, especially for merchant vessels.\n\n2.  **Research and Identify Candidates:** I will search historical naval records for this period. The most notable candidates that emerge are:\n    *   The oil tanker **Émile Miguet**: Sunk by torpedoes from U-48 on October 12, 1939. It was a very large ship for its time, with a GRT of 14,115.\n    *   The passenger liner **Champlain**: Struck a mine laid by U-66 on June 17, 1940. With a GRT of 28,124, it was significantly larger than the *Émile Miguet*.\n\n3.  **Compare and Conclude:** Comparing the two largest ships, the liner *Champlain* was substantially larger than the tanker *Émile Miguet*. Since a sinking caused by a mine laid by a submarine is considered a U-boat kill, the *Champlain* is the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Code Generation:** I will now generate a Python script to present this information clearly. The script will store the ship's name, its size (displacement), and the details of its sinking in variables, and then print a formatted string with the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information on the largest French ship by displacement \n    sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n    The information is based on historical research.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Ship details\n    ship_name = \"Champlain\"\n    \n    # Displacement is the measure of weight, which was requested.\n    # For a large passenger liner, this figure is often close to its Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).\n    # Its displacement was 27,680 tons. Its GRT was 28,124.\n    displacement = 27680\n    \n    # Details of the sinking\n    cause = \"a mine laid by the German submarine U-66\"\n    date = \"June 17, 1940\"\n\n    # Print the final answer, ensuring all key details and numbers are included.\n    print(f\"The largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the passenger liner '{ship_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"It was sunk on {date} by {cause}.\")\n    print(f\"The displacement of the '{ship_name}' was {displacement} tons.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<Champlain>>>"
