    Solves the theoretical questions about the Pohozaev identity.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) False: The Pohozaev identity is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a function to be a critical point of the energy functional J. A function can satisfy the integral identity without being a solution to the underlying PDE.
    (b) No: The existence of a unique positive scaling factor 't' to project a function onto the Pohozaev manifold P=0 depends on the sign of the nonlinear part of the functional. For an arbitrary function, this sign is not guaranteed to be positive, so a solution for 't' may not exist.
    (c) Yes: In the context of variational methods, a minimizer of the energy J on a constraint manifold (like P=0) is typically a saddle point in the full space. This means it maximizes the energy with respect to scaling variations. Therefore, the second derivative of the energy with respect to the scaling parameter, evaluated at the minimizer, must be negative.
