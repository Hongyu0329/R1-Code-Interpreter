    "My analysis indicates that the user's question is based on a false premise. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan did not adopt the name \"Azikiwe\" at a later stage in his life. \"Azikiwe\" is part of his full birth name: Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan. Therefore, there is no specific year when he began to publicly identify with it, as it has always been his name.\n\nSince this is a factual clarification rather than a computational task, the following Python script will print an explanation addressing the user's query.\n\n```python\ndef get_explanation():\n  \"\"\"\n  Provides an explanation regarding Goodluck Jonathan's name.\n  \"\"\"\n  explanation = (\n      \"There is no specific year when Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself as 'Azikiwe' \"\n      \"for the first time. The name 'Azikiwe' is part of his given birth name, \"\n      \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, and not a name he adopted later in life. \"\n      \"Therefore, he has carried the name since birth.\"\n  )\n  print(explanation)\n\nget_explanation()\n```\n<<<There is no specific year because 'Azikiwe' is part of his birth name.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
