    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** I will first determine the structure of a 10-node barbell graph. A barbell graph is formed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge, known as the \"bottleneck\" or \"bridge\". For a 10-node graph, this means we have two 5-node complete graphs (K5) connected by the bottleneck edge.\n2.  **Analyze Randomized Gossiping:** In the randomized uniform gossiping protocol, a node is selected uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph. This chosen node then selects one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random. The edge between these two nodes is the one sampled in that step.\n3.  **Calculate Node Degrees:** The probability of selecting a specific neighbor depends on the node's degree (the number of neighbors it has). I will calculate the degrees of the two specific nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n    *   A node in a K5 clique has 4 neighbors within that clique.\n    *   The two nodes connected by the bridge have their 4 neighbors within the clique plus the 1 neighbor across the bridge, giving them a total degree of 5.\n4.  **Formulate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge, let's call it (u, v), can be sampled in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    *   Node `u` is chosen, and it then chooses its neighbor `v`.\n    *   Node `v` is chosen, and it then chooses its neighbor `u`.\n    I will calculate the probability of each event and add them together to find the total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge.\n5.  **Code the Solution:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out each step of the logic, including the final equation with all the numerical values, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_gossiping_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    barbell graph with 10 nodes using randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
