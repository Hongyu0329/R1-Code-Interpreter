    "Answering this question requires knowledge of complex analysis, specifically the infinite product representation of certain special functions. The goal is to find a closed-form expression for the given infinite product.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Product Form**: The given expression is an infinite product of the form $\\prod (1+a_n)$, where $a_n = -z^3/n^3$. Since the sum $\\sum |a_n| = |z^3| \\sum 1/n^3$ converges (as it's a p-series with p=3 > 1), the infinite product converges.\n\n2.  **Factor the General Term**: The term inside the product can be factored using the difference of cubes formula, $a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$.\n    $1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\frac{n^3 - z^3}{n^3} = \\frac{(n-z)(n^2+nz+z^2)}{n^3}$.\n    The quadratic term $n^2+nz+z^2$ has roots $n=z\\omega$ and $n=z\\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ and $\\omega^2=e^{i4\\pi/3}$ are the primitive cube roots of unity.\n    So, $n^3 - z^3 = (n-z)(n-z\\omega)(n-z\\omega^2)$.\n    The general term becomes:\n    $\\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right)$.\n\n3.  **Relate to the Gamma Function**: The infinite product from $n=1$ is related to the Weierstrass product representation for the Gamma function. The identity is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{x^m}{n^m}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{k=0}^{m-1} \\Gamma(1 - x e^{i2\\pi k/m})} $$\n    For this problem, $m=3$. So, the product starting from $n=1$ is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n\n4.  **Adjust the Starting Index**: The problem asks for the product starting from $n=3$. We can obtain this by taking the product from $n=1$ and dividing out the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty} = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}}{\\left(\\text{term for } n=1\\right) \\times \\left(\\text{term for } n=2\\right)} $$\n    The term for $n=1$ is $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right) = 1-z^3$.\n    The term for $n=2$ is $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right) = 1-z^3/8$.\n\n5.  **Final Expression**: Combining these results gives the final closed-form expression for the infinite product.\n\n6.  **Code Implementation**: The Python code will print this final symbolic equation. The printed string will contain all the numbers present in the mathematical formula to satisfy the problem's requirement.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef generate_expression_string():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates and prints the symbolic expression for the given infinite product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The product we want to evaluate is P = Prod_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3 / n^3)\n    # This can be expressed using the Gamma function.\n\n    # The formula for the product from n=1 is:\n    # P_1 = 1 / (Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*w) * Gamma(1 - z*w^2))\n    # where w = exp(i*2*pi/3)\n\n    # We need to divide P_1 by the terms for n=1 and n=2.\n    # Term n=1: (1 - z^3/1^3)\n    # Term n=2: (1 - z^3/2^3)\n\n    # The final expression is therefore:\n    lhs_str = \"Product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3/n^3)\"\n    \n    # Using 'w' for exp(i*2*pi/3) and 'w^2' for exp(i*4*pi/3) for clarity\n    # rhs_str = \"1 / ((1 - z^3) * (1 - z^3/8) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*w) * Gamma(1 - z*w^2))\"\n    # To be more explicit with numbers as requested:\n    rhs_str = \"1 / ((1 - z^3) * (1 - z^3/8) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(i*2*pi/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(i*4*pi/3)))\"\n\n    # We output the full equation to show the result clearly.\n    # All numbers from the equation (3, 3, 1, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4) are present in the output string.\n    final_equation = f\"{lhs_str} = {rhs_str}\"\n    print(final_equation)\n\ngenerate_expression_string()\n```\n<<<1 / ((1 - z^3) * (1 - z^3/8) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(i*2*pi/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(i*4*pi/3)))>>>"
