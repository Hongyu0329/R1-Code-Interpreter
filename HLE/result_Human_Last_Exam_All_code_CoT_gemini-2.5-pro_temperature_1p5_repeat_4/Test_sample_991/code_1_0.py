# Step 1: Interpret the inner part of the character.
# The clues "A wooden stick" and "a ladder placed in the center" poetically describe the character for 'tree' or 'wood'.
inner_part = "木"
print(f"The 'wooden stick' and 'ladder' form the character: {inner_part}")

# Step 2: Interpret the outer part of the character.
# The clue "hanging a square box" describes an enclosure.
outer_part = "囗"
print(f"The 'square box' is the radical: {outer_part}")

# Step 3: Combine the components to form the final character and display the equation.
# A tree (木) inside a box (囗) forms the character 困 (kùn).
final_character = "困"
print(f"The final equation is: {inner_part} + {outer_part} = {final_character}")

# The character 困 (kùn) means "trapped", "difficult", or "sleepy", which visually matches a tree trapped in a box.
print(f"\nTherefore, the character referred to is: {final_character}")
