Step 1: Understanding the a anet.
The problem describes a sequence of sets, <x_α : α < δ>, with the following properties on the cardinal ω_2 (omega_2):
1.  Each set x_α has a size of ω_2.
2.  For any α < β < δ, the set difference |x_β \ x_α| has a size less than ω_2. This means that as we move up the tower, the sets are "growing slowly."
3.  There is no single set y of size ω_2 that is "almost a subset" of all sets in the tower. This is a maximality condition, implying the tower cannot be extended by a single set from below in a certain sense.

Step 2: Identifying the Mathematical Object.
This structure is a known object in advanced set theory. The length 'δ' of such a tower is an example of a cardinal characteristic. Specifically, the properties described are those for the "tower number" on ω_2, which is denoted t(ω_2). The question asks for the second smallest possible value of δ = t(ω_2).

Step 3: Applying Foundational Theorems of ZFC.
We use two key results from ZFC set theory:
a) The length 'δ' of such a tower must be a regular cardinal. If δ were a singular cardinal, a shorter tower of length cf(δ) (the cofinality of δ) could be constructed from the original, which would have the same properties. Thus, the possible values of δ are regular cardinals.
b) For any regular cardinal κ greater than ω, it is a theorem of ZFC that the tower number t(κ) is strictly greater than κ. In our case, with κ = ω_2, this means δ = t(ω_2) > ω_2.

Step 4: Determining the Possible Values for δ.
Combining the results from Step 3, δ must be a regular cardinal that is strictly greater than ω_2.
Let's list the regular cardinals in increasing order: ω, ω_1, ω_2, ω_3, ω_4, ω_5, ...
(Note: Successor cardinals like ω_3 and ω_4 are always regular).

The regular cardinals strictly greater than ω_2 are therefore: ω_3, ω_4, ω_5, and so on.

Step 5: Finding the Smallest and Second Smallest Values.
It is a major result in set theory (using the method of forcing) that for any regular cardinal λ > ω_2, it is possible to construct a model of ZFC where t(ω_2) = λ. This means the set of all possible values for δ is exactly the set of regular cardinals greater than ω_2.
- The smallest cardinal in this set is ω_3.
- The second smallest cardinal in this set is ω_4.
