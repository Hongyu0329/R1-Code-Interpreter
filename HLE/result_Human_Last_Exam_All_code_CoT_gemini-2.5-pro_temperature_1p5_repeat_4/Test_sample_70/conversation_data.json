    "The task is to identify which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark. To solve this, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark**: I will first analyze the design of the Danish flag to determine its rank. A flag's rank, in this context, is the number of linearly independent rows or columns in its matrix representation. The Danish flag consists of a white cross on a red field. This design creates two distinct types of rows: rows that are all white (part of the cross's horizontal bar) and rows that are red with a white interruption (part of the field). These two row types are linearly independent, meaning one cannot be created by simply scaling the other. Therefore, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n2.  **Analyze and Rank African Flags**: Next, I will analyze the flags of all African nations to determine their respective ranks based on their designs.\n    *   A flag with `k` horizontal or vertical stripes of different colors will have a rank of `k`.\n    *   A flag with a single-colored background and a simple, single-colored emblem will have a rank of 2 (one rank for the background row/column type, and a second for the row/column type that includes the emblem).\n    *   Flags with more complex arrangements will be analyzed based on the number of distinct, linearly independent row or column patterns.\n\n3.  **Identify and Print Matches**: Finally, I will write a Python script that encodes the ranks determined in the previous step. The script will then compare the rank of each African flag to the rank of the Danish flag (which is 2) and print the names of the countries whose flags have the same rank.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_flags_with_same_rank_as_denmark():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds and prints the names of African nations whose flags\n    have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n    Methodology:\n    1. The rank of a flag is determined by the number of linearly independent\n       rows or columns in its matrix representation. Different colors or distinct\n       patterns create these independent vectors.\n    2. The flag of Denmark (red with a white cross) has two distinct row patterns\n       (a solid white row and a red-white-red row), giving it a rank of 2.\n    3. We analyze the flags of African nations to determine their rank based on\n       their color patterns (e.g., number of stripes, presence of emblems).\n    4. This script compares the rank of each African flag to Denmark's rank and\n       outputs the names of the countries that match.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n    denmark_rank = 2\n    print(f\"The flag of Denmark has a linear algebraic rank of {denmark_rank}.\\n\")\n\n    # A dictionary mapping African nations to the rank of their flags.\n    # The ranks are pre-determined based on analysis of the flag designs.\n    # collections.OrderedDict is used to maintain alphabetical order for the output.\n    african_flag_ranks = collections.OrderedDict([\n        ('Algeria', 3), # Green/White vertical fields + Red emblem\n        ('Angola', 3), # Red/Black horizontal stripes + Yellow emblem\n        ('Benin', 2), # Two row types: [Yellow, Green] and [Red, Green]\n        ('Botswana', 3), # Blue, White, Black horizontal stripes\n        ('Burkina Faso', 3), # Red/Green horizontal stripes + Yellow star\n        ('Burundi', 4), # Complex saltire and emblem\n        ('Cabo Verde', 4), # Blue field, three stripes, ten stars\n        ('Cameroon', 3), # Vertical tricolor\n        ('Central African Republic', 5), # 4 horizontal stripes + 1 vertical stripe\n        ('Chad', 3), # Vertical tricolor\n        ('Comoros', 5), # 4 horizontal stripes + Green triangle\n        ('DR Congo', 3), # Blue field, Red/Yellow diagonal stripe\n        ('Republic of the Congo', 3), # Diagonal tricolor\n        ('Côte d\\'Ivoire', 3), # Vertical tricolor\n        ('Djibouti', 3), # Blue/Green stripes + White triangle\n        ('Egypt', 3), # Horizontal tricolor\n        ('Equatorial Guinea', 4), # Tricolor + Blue triangle\n        ('Eritrea', 3), # Diagonal tricolor design\n        ('Eswatini', 3), # Multi-stripe design + central shield\n        ('Ethiopia', 3), # Horizontal tricolor\n        ('Gabon', 3), # Horizontal tricolor\n        ('Gambia, The', 3), # Three main color stripes (R,B,G)\n        ('Ghana', 3), # Horizontal tricolor\n        ('Guinea', 3), # Vertical tricolor\n        ('Guinea-Bissau', 2), # Two row types: [Yellow, Red] and [Green, Red]\n        ('Kenya', 3), # Three main color stripes + shield\n        ('Lesotho', 3), # Horizontal tricolor\n        ('Liberia', 3), # Multiple stripes + canton\n        ('Libya', 3), # Horizontal tricolor\n        ('Madagascar', 2), # Two row types: [Red, White] and [Green, White]\n        ('Malawi', 3), # Horizontal tricolor\n        ('Mali', 3), # Vertical tricolor\n        ('Mauritania', 3), # Green field with two Red stripes\n        ('Mauritius', 4), # Four horizontal stripes\n        ('Morocco', 2), # Solid field (Red) + emblem (Green)\n        ('Mozambique', 5), # Complex design with multiple colors/emblems\n        ('Namibia', 4), # Complex diagonal design\n        ('Niger', 3), # Horizontal tricolor\n        ('Nigeria', 2), # Two column types: Green and White\n        ('Rwanda', 3), # Horizontal tricolor\n        ('São Tomé and Príncipe', 3), # Tricolor design + stars\n        ('Senegal', 3), # Vertical tricolor\n        ('Seychelles', 5), # Five oblique bands\n        ('Sierra Leone', 3), # Horizontal tricolor\n        ('Somalia', 2), # Solid field (Blue) + emblem (White star)\n        ('South Africa', 6), # Six-colored complex design\n        ('South Sudan', 5), # Complex design with tricolor, stripes, triangle\n        ('Sudan', 4), # Tricolor + Green triangle\n        ('Tanzania', 4), # Complex diagonal design\n        ('Togo', 3), # Five stripes + canton\n        ('Tunisia', 2), # Solid field (Red) + emblem (White disk)\n        ('Uganda', 3), # Six stripes of three colors\n        ('Zambia', 4), # Green field + three vertical stripes\n        ('Zimbabwe', 4), # Seven stripes of four colors + triangle\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The flags of the following African nations have the same rank (2):\")\n    matching_countries = []\n    for country, rank in african_flag_ranks.items():\n        if rank == denmark_rank:\n            matching_countries.append(country)\n            \n    # Print the final list\n    for country in matching_countries:\n        print(f\"- {country}\")\n\nfind_flags_with_same_rank_as_denmark()\n<<<Benin\nGuinea-Bissau\nMadagascar\nMorocco\nNigeria\nSomalia\nTunisia>>>"
