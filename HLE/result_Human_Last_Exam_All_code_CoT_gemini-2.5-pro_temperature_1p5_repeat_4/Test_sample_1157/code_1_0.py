    print("### PART 1: IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT & CONSIDERATIONS ###")
    print(f"1. Systemic Health: The patient's HbA1c is {hba1c}%, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. This is a primary concern as it impairs wound healing and increases the risk of infection. Management must begin with a medical consultation to control her blood glucose levels.")
    print(f"2. Acute Trauma: The accident occurred {time_since_trauma} hours ago. Given the delay, replantation of the avulsed (knocked out) teeth is no longer a viable option. Immediate dental care would focus on:")
    print("   - Cleaning the wounds to prevent infection.")
    print("   - Administering antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis.")
    print("   - Managing pain.")
    print("   - Taking radiographs to assess the condition of the sockets and remaining teeth.\n")

    print("### PART 2: SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ###")
    print("--- Which cells are of interest here? ---")
    print("The healing process involves a complex interplay of various cells:")
    print(" - Neutrophils and Macrophages: The first responders to injury, they clean the wound of bacteria and debris (inflammation phase).")
    print(" - Fibroblasts: These cells synthesize collagen to form new connective tissue (proliferative phase).")
    print(" - Osteoblasts and Osteoclasts: These cells are crucial for remodeling the alveolar bone socket after tooth loss. Osteoclasts resorb damaged bone, and osteoblasts form new bone.\n")

    print("--- Denture Replacement Plan (Hypothetical) ---")
    print("A definitive treatment plan depends on a full clinical examination.")
    print(" - Denture Type: A Removable Partial Denture (RPD) would be a common and practical choice to replace multiple teeth.")
    print(" - Material: A Chrome-Cobalt metal framework is often preferred for its strength, stability, and hygiene. The teeth and gum-colored portions would be made of Acrylic.")
    print(" - Abutment Teeth: These are the natural teeth that support the denture.")
    print("   - Potential Abutments: The Left Central Incisor and the Left Second Premolar would be considered.")
    print("   - Reason for Choice: The choice of abutments is critical. The dentist would evaluate their periodontal health, bone support, and structural integrity. A canine is a very strong and key abutment tooth, and its loss complicates the design. The abutments must be strong enough to support the denture without becoming damaged over time.")
    print(f" - Skeletal Factor: The SNB angle of {snb_angle} degrees indicates a protrusive mandible (Skeletal Class III). This must be carefully considered when designing the bite (occlusion) of the denture to ensure stability and function.\n")
    
    print("### PART 3: FINAL MANAGEMENT 'EQUATION' ###")
    print("A clinical decision is not a mathematical equation, but can be represented as a function of multiple factors:")
