    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the oligomeric state of the provided protein sequences.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Sequences**: First, I will analyze the provided protein sequences. These sequences have characteristics of coiled coils, which are protein structural motifs where alpha-helices are coiled together. The oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) is primarily determined by the specific amino acid residues at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad (`abcdefg`) repeat.\n2.  **Apply Prediction Rules**: I will apply established bioinformatics principles and use knowledge from prediction algorithms (like those used in tools such as LOGICOIL or SCORER 2.0) to determine the most likely oligomeric state for each sequence.\n    *   **Sequence 1**: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`. This sequence features a core pattern of Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and Leucine (L) at the 'd' positions. This classic I-L \"leucine zipper\" motif strongly favors the formation of **dimers (2)**.\n    *   **Sequence 2**: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`. This sequence is also dominated by an I-L core, which is strongly dimeric. The single substitution of a polar Asparagine (N) at one 'a' position is insufficient to disrupt the stable dimer interface. Therefore, it is predicted to be a **dimer (2)**.\n    *   **Sequence 3**: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`. This sequence has Isoleucine (I) at both the 'a' and 'd' core positions. This `I-I` packing arrangement is known to favor higher-order structures, with modern predictors strongly indicating a **tetramer (4)**.\n    *   **Sequence 4**: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`. The presence of a very bulky Tryptophan (W) residue at a core 'd' position introduces significant steric hindrance that is unfavorable for the tight packing required in a trimer. This strongly promotes the formation of a **dimer (2)**.\n    *   **Sequence 5**: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`. This sequence presents a combination of Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and Threonine (T) at the 'd' positions. While patterns with beta-branched amino acids can be complex, this specific `I-T` pairing is predicted by computational models to preferentially form a **trimer (3)**.\n3.  **Construct Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that stores these sequences and their corresponding predicted states (`2, 2, 4, 2, 3`). The script will then print the final sequence of oligomeric states.\n\n```python\ndef predict_oligomeric_states():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil protein sequences based on established rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequences = [\n        \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\",\n        \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\",\n        \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\",\n        \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\",\n        \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Predicted oligomeric states based on computational analysis and coiled-coil prediction rules.\n    # The states are [Dimer, Dimer, Tetramer, Dimer, Trimer].\n    oligomeric_states = [2, 2, 4, 2, 3]\n\n    print(\"Predicted oligomeric states for the coiled-coil sequences:\")\n    for i in range(len(sequences)):\n        print(f\"Sequence {i+1}: {sequences[i]} -> State: {oligomeric_states[i]}\")\n\n    # Format the final answer string as requested by the multiple-choice options\n    final_answer_string = \",\".join(map(str, oligomeric_states))\n    print(f\"\\nThe final sequence of numbers representing the oligomeric states is:\")\n    # Print each number in the final sequence individually, as requested\n    for i, number in enumerate(oligomeric_states):\n        if i < len(oligomeric_states) - 1:\n            print(number, end=\",\")\n        else:\n            print(number, end=\".\\n\")\n\npredict_oligomeric_states()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
