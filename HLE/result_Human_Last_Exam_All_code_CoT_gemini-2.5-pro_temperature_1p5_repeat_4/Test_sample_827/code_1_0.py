def find_starting_material():
    """
    This function determines and prints the name of the starting material (Compound A)
    based on the provided reaction scheme and spectral data.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  The NMR data for the final product points to the structure:
        7-(benzylamino)-5-(tert-butyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine.
        - ¹H NMR (ppm): 8.69 (t, 1H, NH), 8.24 (s, 1H, core CH), 8.11 (s, 1H, core CH), 
                      7.37-7.22 (m, 5H, Ph), 4.73 (d, 2H, CH2), 1.70 (s, 9H, tBu).
        - ¹³C NMR (ppm): 12 signals matching the proposed structure including benzyl carbons
                      (139.82, 128.82, 127.85, 127.35, 43.52), tert-butyl carbons (59.79, 29.25),
                      and core carbons (156.89, 154.96, 152.80, 130.16, 102.23).

    2.  This product is formed via two sequential nucleophilic substitutions.
        - Step 2: An intermediate reacts with benzylamine (PhCH2NH2). This means the 
          intermediate was 7-chloro-5-(tert-butyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine.
        - Step 1: Compound A reacts to form this intermediate. The formation of the 
          fused triazole ring with a C5-tert-butyl group from a pyrimidine precursor is
          a known reaction that uses pivaloyl hydrazine, (CH3)3C-C(=O)NHNH2.
          (Note: The problem's "tertbutyl hydrazine" is likely an error for pivaloyl hydrazine).
          
    3.  For this reaction to work, Compound A must be a pyrimidine with two leaving groups at
        positions 2 and 4.
        
    4.  Therefore, Compound A is 2,4-dichloropyrimidine.
