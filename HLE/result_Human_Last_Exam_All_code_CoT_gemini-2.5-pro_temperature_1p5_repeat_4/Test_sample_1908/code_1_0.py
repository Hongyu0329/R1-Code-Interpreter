def solve_topology_complement_problem():
    """
    This function determines the smallest possible number of complements a non-trivial,
    non-discrete topology on a set of cardinality c can have.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. Existence of Complements: In standard ZFC, we can assume the cardinality c
       is not a measurable cardinal. A theorem states that in this case, any
       topology on such a set has at least one complement. So the number is >= 1.
    2. No Topology Has a Single Complement: A known theorem in topology states
       that a topology on an infinite set cannot have exactly one complement.
       Thus, the number of complements must be either 0 or >= 2.
    3. Conclusion on Lower Bound: Combining these, if a topology has complements,
       it must have at least 2.
    4. Achievability: There are known constructions of topologies on any infinite
       set (including one of cardinality c) that have exactly 2 complements.
    5. Final Answer: The smallest possible number of complements is therefore 2.
