    Analyzes and presents the results for relativistic effects
    in a hypothetical Euclidean spacetime.

    The analysis is based on transformations that preserve the metric
    s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2. These are 4D rotations. For a boost
    with velocity v along the x-axis, the transformations are:
    x' = (x - v*t) / sqrt(1 + v^2)
    t' = (t + v*x) / sqrt(1 + v^2)

    answer1 = "Yes. Events simultaneous in one frame (dt=0) are not simultaneous in another (dt' = v*dx / sqrt(1+v^2)) if they are spatially separated (dx != 0)."
    answer2 = "Yes. Length is relative. An object with proper length L0 is measured to have a *longer* length L when moving (length expansion)."
    answer3 = "Yes. Time is relative. A clock's proper time interval T0 is measured as a *shorter* interval T in a frame where the clock is moving. Moving clocks run *faster*."
    answer4 = "No. There is no real, non-zero invariant speed. The math leads to an imaginary speed (u = i) as the only possibility."
    answer5 = "Yes. The rule for adding velocities is non-Newtonian, as it depends on the product of the velocities."
