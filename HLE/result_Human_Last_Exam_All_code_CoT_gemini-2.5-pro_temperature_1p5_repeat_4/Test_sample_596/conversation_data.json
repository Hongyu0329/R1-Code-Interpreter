    "Of course, I can help you with that. This problem involves concepts from algebraic topology and combinatorics. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Question:** The question asks for the number of \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" on a Möbius band that \"fail to simplicially collapse\". This points towards a specific result in algebraic combinatorics that connects such combinatorial objects (often called \"critical\" forests or trees) to the topological invariants of the underlying space.\n2.  **Identify the Key Theorem:** The number of these non-collapsing forests in a $d$-dimensional simplicial complex $K$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is given by the formula:\n    $$ \\text{Number} = \\sum_{i=0}^{d} \\beta_i(K) \\cdot \\beta_i(K, \\partial K) $$\n    where $\\beta_i(K)$ are the Betti numbers of the complex $K$, and $\\beta_i(K, \\partial K)$ are the relative Betti numbers of $K$ with respect to its boundary $\\partial K$.\n3.  **Determine Betti Numbers of the Möbius Band:** The \"standard triangulation of the Möbius band\" defines our simplicial complex, let's call it $K$. It is a 2-dimensional manifold ($d=2$). I will determine its Betti numbers $\\beta_i(K; \\mathbb{F}_2)$.\n    *   $\\beta_0(K)$: The Möbius band is path-connected, so $\\beta_0(K) = 1$.\n    *   $\\beta_1(K)$: The first homology group of the Möbius band is $H_1(K;\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}$. With $\\mathbb{F}_2$ coefficients, this becomes $H_1(K;\\mathbb{F}_2) = \\mathbb{F}_2$, so $\\beta_1(K) = 1$.\n    *   $\\beta_2(K)$: Since the Möbius band is a non-compact 2-manifold (it has a boundary), its second homology group is trivial. So, $\\beta_2(K) = 0$.\n4.  **Determine Relative Betti Numbers:** I will find the relative Betti numbers $\\beta_i(K, \\partial K; \\mathbb{F}_2)$ using Lefschetz duality. For a non-orientable $d$-manifold with boundary, this duality states that $\\beta_i(K, \\partial K; \\mathbb{F}_2) = \\beta_{d-i}(K; \\mathbb{F}_2)$. With $d=2$, we have:\n    *   $\\beta_0(K, \\partial K) = \\beta_2(K) = 0$.\n    *   $\\beta_1(K, \\partial K) = \\beta_1(K) = 1$.\n    *   $\\beta_2(K, \\partial K) = \\beta_0(K) = 1$.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** I will substitute these Betti numbers into the formula and compute the sum.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that performs this calculation and prints the result, showing each number in the final equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Plan\n# 1. Define the Betti numbers of the Mobius band (K) over the field F_2.\n#    The Mobius band is a 2-dimensional simplicial complex.\n#    b_0(K) = 1 (it is path-connected).\n#    b_1(K) = 1 (it deformation retracts onto a circle).\n#    b_2(K) = 0 (it is a manifold with boundary).\nbetti_K = {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 0}\n\n# 2. Determine the relative Betti numbers of the pair (K, partial K) where\n#    partial K is the boundary of the Mobius band.\n#    Using Lefschetz duality for a non-orientable n-manifold over F_2, we have:\n#    b_i(K, partial K) = b_{n-i}(K). Here n=2.\n#    b_0(K, partial K) = b_2(K) = 0.\n#    b_1(K, partial K) = b_1(K) = 1.\n#    b_2(K, partial K) = b_0(K) = 1.\nbetti_K_partialK = {\n    0: betti_K[2],\n    1: betti_K[1],\n    2: betti_K[0]\n}\n\n# 3. The number of higher dimensional rooted forests that fail to collapse\n#    is given by the formula: Sum_{i=0 to n} b_i(K) * b_i(K, partial K).\nterm0 = betti_K[0] * betti_K_partialK[0]\nterm1 = betti_K[1] * betti_K_partialK[1]\nterm2 = betti_K[2] * betti_K_partialK[2]\ntotal_sum = term0 + term1 + term2\n\n# 4. Print the final calculation, showing each number in the final equation.\n# The calculation is sum_{i=0 to 2} b_i(K) * b_i(K, partial K).\n# = b_0(K)*b_0(K,pK) + b_1(K)*b_1(K,pK) + b_2(K)*b_2(K,pK)\n# = b_0(K)*b_2(K) + b_1(K)*b_1(K) + b_2(K)*b_0(K)\nprint(f\"{betti_K[0]} * {betti_K_partialK[0]} + {betti_K[1]} * {betti_K_partialK[1]} + {betti_K[2]} * {betti_K_partialK[2]} = {total_sum}\")\n```\n<<<1>>>"
