    "This is a historical question that requires looking up information from historical records. I will find the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 and then present this information using a Python script, as requested.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Research historical sources to identify the judge (in Hungarian: *bíró*, Latin: *judex*) of the free royal town of Bártfa for the year 1461.\n2.  Store the name of the city, the year, and the judge's name in variables within a Python script.\n3.  Use a `print()` statement to output a formatted string that clearly answers the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_judge_of_bartfa_1461():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the name of the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n    The information is based on historical records for the free royal town.\n    \"\"\"\n    city = \"Bártfa (now Bardejov)\"\n    year = 1461\n    judge_name = \"Miklós Bárth\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a full sentence.\n    print(f\"The judge of {city} in {year} was {judge_name}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the information.\nfind_judge_of_bartfa_1461()\n```\n<<<Miklós Bárth>>>"
