    # The problem asks for the limit as h -> 0 of the probability that site 0 is
    # visited by infinitely many particles.

    # Step 1: Analyze the drift of the associated non-branching random walk.
    # The drift direction is determined by the sign of E[log(rho)], where
    # rho = p_L / p_R is the ratio of jump probabilities.

    # At a red site (prob h), rho_red = (4/5) / (1/5) = 4.
    # At a blue site (prob 1-h), rho_blue = (1/5) / (4/5) = 1/4.
    rho_red = 4.0
    rho_blue = 0.25

    # Step 2: Formulate the expectation E[log(rho)].
    # E[log(rho)] = h * log(rho_red) + (1-h) * log(rho_blue)
    #             = h * log(4) + (1-h) * log(1/4)
    #             = (2*h - 1) * log(4)

    # Step 3: Analyze the sign of this expression for h in (0, 1/2).
    # As h -> 0, the term (2*h - 1) approaches -1.
    # Since log(4) > 0, the entire expression is negative.
    # This implies a drift to +infinity for the particle system.
    
    # The "final equation" that determines the behavior of the system is
    # the expression for the expected log-ratio of jump probabilities.
    # We will output the numbers from its simplified form: (2*h - 1) * log(4)
    num_two = 2
    num_one = 1
    num_four = 4

    print("The long-term behavior of the particle system is determined by the sign of an expression.")
    print(f"The simplified expression for the drift criterion is: ({num_two}*h - {num_one}) * log({num_four}).")
    
    # Step 4: Draw the conclusion.
    # A positive drift means the minimum position of the particle cloud goes to +infinity.
    # Therefore, any fixed site (like 0) is visited only a finite number of times.
    # This means the probability of infinite visits is 0 for any h in (0, 1/2).
    
    print("\nFor any h in (0, 1/2), this expression is negative, implying the particle cloud drifts to +infinity.")
    print("Thus, the probability of infinitely many particles visiting site 0 is 0.")

    # Step 5: State the final answer.
    # The limit of a constant value (0) is that constant itself.
    final_answer = 0
    print(f"\nThe limit of this probability as h -> 0 is therefore {final_answer}.")
