# The problem is to find the coefficient of the gauge field term in the second
# Seeley-DeWitt coefficient (a_2) for a gauged Dirac operator in 4 dimensions.

# The local density of the a_2 coefficient, a_2(x), contains terms built from
# the spacetime curvature and the gauge field strength F. The term for the
# Yang-Mills action is of the form C * tr_g(F_uv F^uv), where tr_g is the trace
# over the gauge group representation. We need to find the constant C.

# This coefficient C is the sum of two contributions, C = C_omega + C_E2.

# 1. Contribution from the total curvature term (Omega^2):
# The a_2 formula includes a term (1/12) * Tr(Omega_uv Omega^uv), where Omega
# is the total curvature (spin connection + gauge connection).
# The part of this term that involves the gauge field F gives a contribution to C.
# For a Dirac spinor in 4D, the dimension of the spinor space is 4.
# This leads to a coefficient for tr_g(F^2) of:
C_omega = 4 / 12
# This simplifies to 1/3.

# 2. Contribution from the endomorphism term (E^2):
# The Lichnerowicz formula for the squared Dirac operator D^2 gives an
# endomorphism term E. The a_2 formula includes a term (1/2) * Tr(E^2).
# The part of this term involving F gives another contribution to C.
# After performing the trace over spinor indices, this contribution is found to be:
C_E2 = -1 / 4

# The final coefficient is the sum of these two parts.
C_total = C_omega + C_E2

# The equation for the final coefficient is C_total = C_omega + C_E2
