    "This is a geographical riddle. I will break down the clues to find the answer.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I'll dissect the riddle into key requirements:\n    *   An island town.\n    *   Distance: More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island (indicating extreme remoteness).\n    *   Geography: Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    *   Naming: The town and the bay share the same name.\n2.  **Identify Candidates:** I will consider famous remote islands like Tristan da Cunha, Pitcairn Island, and Easter Island.\n3.  **Verify Clues:** I will check each candidate against all the requirements. Easter Island (Rapa Nui) is a strong candidate. It is extremely remote (over 2,000 km to the Pitcairn Islands). Its landscape is dominated by volcanic craters (calderas). The main town is Hanga Roa, which is situated on Hanga Roa Bay. This matches all the clues.\n4.  **Construct Code:** I will write a Python script that explains this logic and prints the final answer. The script will also explicitly reference the number `500` from the clue to meet the user's instructions.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_geographical_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves a riddle about a remote island town.\n    It identifies the town by processing a series of geographical clues.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Clue Analysis ---\n    # The riddle provides several key pieces of information.\n    # We will use them to pinpoint the location.\n\n    # Clue 1: Remoteness. The distance from another inhabited island is specified.\n    distance_clue_km = 500\n\n    # Clue 2: Geography. The town is on a specific type of bay.\n    geographical_feature = \"bay formed by a volcanic caldera\"\n\n    # Clue 3: Naming. The town and bay have the same name.\n    naming_convention = \"shares the town's name\"\n\n    # --- Deduction ---\n    # Based on the extreme remoteness (> 500 km), we can consider locations\n    # like Easter Island, Tristan da Cunha, or the Pitcairn Islands.\n\n    # Easter Island (Rapa Nui) is a volcanic island whose nearest inhabited\n    # neighbor is over 2,000 km away, satisfying the distance clue.\n    # The island's landscape is defined by its volcanoes and calderas.\n\n    # The main town on Easter Island is named Hanga Roa.\n    # It is located on a bay which is also named Hanga Roa. This matches the\n    # naming and geography clues perfectly.\n\n    island = \"Easter Island (Rapa Nui)\"\n    town_and_bay = \"Hanga Roa\"\n\n    # --- Outputting the result ---\n    # The final code needs to output the numbers from the clues.\n    # Here we present the solution and the key number.\n    print(\"Finding the island town based on the riddle:\")\n    print(f\"The required distance from another inhabited island is > {distance_clue_km} km.\")\n    print(f\"The town and bay name match, and the location is on a bay formed by volcanic activity.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The island is: {island}\")\n    print(f\"The town that fits all criteria is: {town_and_bay}\")\n\nsolve_geographical_riddle()\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>\n```"
