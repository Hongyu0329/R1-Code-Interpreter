    Problem Analysis:
    We need to find the number of positive integers n for which the n-cube [0,1]^n cannot be the set of non-block points of any continuum.

    Let X be a continuum (a compact, connected metric space).
    Let N(X) be the set of its non-block points. A point p in X is a non-block point if X \\ {p} contains a continuum-connected dense subset.
    A space S is continuum-connected if for any two points x, y in S, there is a continuum K such that {x, y} is a subset of K and K is a subset of S.

    Step 1: Reduction of the problem.
    Suppose there exists a continuum X such that N(X) = [0,1]^n.
    The set [0,1]^n is non-empty for any n >= 1.
    A key theorem in topology states that for any continuum X, the set of its non-block points N(X) is either empty or dense in X.
    Since N(X) = [0,1]^n is not empty, it must be a dense subset of X.
    So, [0,1]^n is a dense subset of the continuum X.
    We also know that [0,1]^n is compact. A continuum X is a metric space, and thus a Hausdorff space.
    A topological theorem states that a compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed. Therefore, [0,1]^n is a closed subset of X.
    The only subset of a topological space that is both dense and closed is the space itself.
    Therefore, if such a continuum X exists, it must be homeomorphic to [0,1]^n.
    This simplifies the problem to: For which n >= 1 is the set of non-block points of [0,1]^n, N([0,1]^n), not equal to [0,1]^n?

    Step 2: Analysis for n = 1.
    Let X = [0,1]^1 = [0,1]. Let's find its set of non-block points, N([0,1]).
    Consider a point p in (0,1). The set X \\ {p} is [0, p) U (p, 1].
    This set is disconnected. Therefore, it is not continuum-connected.
    It cannot contain a dense continuum-connected subset either. Any continuum in R is an interval. A dense subset D of X \\ {p} must contain points from both [0,p) and (p,1]. Any interval containing points from both sides must contain p, which is not in X \\ {p}. So no such continuum-connected D exists.
    Thus, any point p in (0,1) is a block point.
    For the endpoints p=0 and p=1, the set X \\ {p} is connected (it's an interval), hence continuum-connected. So 0 and 1 are non-block points.
    So, N([0,1]) = {0, 1}.
    Since N([0,1]) != [0,1], the cube [0,1]^1 fails to be the set of non-block points of [0,1]. Based on Step 1, it cannot be the set of non-block points of any continuum.
    So, n=1 is the value we are looking for.

    Step 3: Analysis for n >= 2.
    Let X = [0,1]^n for n >= 2. Let's find N([0,1]^n).
    Consider any point p in [0,1]^n. The set S = X \\ {p} = [0,1]^n \\ {p}.
    For n >= 2, the space R^n \\ {p} is path-connected. The space [0,1]^n \\ {p} is also path-connected.
    Since S is path-connected, it is continuum-connected (for any two points, the path between them is a continuum).
    S serves as its own dense continuum-connected subset.
    Therefore, every point p in [0,1]^n is a non-block point for n >= 2.
    So, N([0,1]^n) = [0,1]^n for all n >= 2.
    This means for any n >= 2, the n-cube *does* occur as the set of non-block points of a continuum (namely, itself).

    Step 4: Conclusion.
    The n-cube [0,1]^n fails to occur as the set of non-block points of a continuum only for n = 1.
    The question asks "For how many n ...". The set of such n's is {1}.
    The count of such values of n is 1.
