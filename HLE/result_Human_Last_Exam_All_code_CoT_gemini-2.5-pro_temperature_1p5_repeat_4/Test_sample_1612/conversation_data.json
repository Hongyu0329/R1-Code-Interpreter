    "To determine the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Triple Crown:** Identify the two types of Triple Crowns in baseball: one for batters and one for pitchers.\n    *   **Batting Triple Crown:** Leading the league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs).\n    *   **Pitching Triple Crown:** Leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA).\n2.  **List Unique Winners:** Compile lists of all unique players who have won each type of Triple Crown. We count players only once, even if they achieved the feat in multiple seasons (e.g., Ted Williams or Sandy Koufax).\n3.  **Sum the Totals:** Add the number of unique batting winners and unique pitching winners to get the final count. Since no player has ever won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown, we can simply sum the two numbers.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation. It uses sets to store the names of the winners, which automatically handles players who have won multiple times, ensuring each winner is counted only once.\n\n```python\n# A function to solve the problem\ndef count_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the total number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n    This is done by counting the unique winners for both batting and pitching\n    and summing them up.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using a set to store names ensures that players who won multiple times are only counted once.\n    # Data is based on MLB official records.\n    batting_winners = {\n        \"Tip O'Neill\", \"Hugh Duffy\", \"Nap Lajoie\", \"Ty Cobb\", \"Heinie Zimmerman\",\n        \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"Chuck Klein\", \"Jimmie Foxx\", \"Lou Gehrig\", \"Joe Medwick\",\n        \"Ted Williams\", \"Mickey Mantle\", \"Frank Robinson\", \"Carl Yastrzemski\", \"Miguel Cabrera\"\n    }\n\n    pitching_winners = {\n        \"Tommy Bond\", \"Old Hoss Radbourn\", \"Tim Keefe\", \"John Clarkson\", \"Amos Rusie\",\n        \"Cy Young\", \"Rube Waddell\", \"Christy Mathewson\", \"Walter Johnson\", \"Pete Alexander\",\n        \"Hippo Vaughn\", \"Dazzy Vance\", \"Lefty Grove\", \"Lefty Gomez\", \"Bucky Walters\",\n        \"Bob Feller\", \"Hal Newhouser\", \"Sandy Koufax\", \"Dwight Gooden\", \"Roger Clemens\",\n        \"Pedro Martinez\", \"Randy Johnson\", \"Johan Santana\", \"Clayton Kershaw\", \"Justin Verlander\",\n        \"Shane Bieber\"\n    }\n\n    num_batting_winners = len(batting_winners)\n    num_pitching_winners = len(pitching_winners)\n    total_winners = num_batting_winners + num_pitching_winners\n\n    print(f\"Number of unique batting Triple Crown winners: {num_batting_winners}\")\n    print(f\"Number of unique pitching Triple Crown winners: {num_pitching_winners}\")\n    print(\"\\nTotal number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history:\")\n    # The final print statement shows the equation with each number\n    print(f\"{num_batting_winners} (batting) + {num_pitching_winners} (pitching) = {total_winners}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_triple_crown_winners()\n<<<41>>>\n```"
