    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the overall molecular symmetry.** The molecule consists of a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core substituted at the 1,3,5 positions. The three substituents (or \"arms\") are identical. This configuration gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry, meaning the three arms are chemically equivalent.\n2.  **Count the signals from the central core.** Due to the C3 symmetry, the three methyl groups on the central benzene ring are equivalent and will produce a single peak.\n3.  **Count the signals from the linker groups.** There are three `-CH2-` groups linking the core to the substituents. Because each linker connects an achiral center (the benzene ring) to a chiral center (the entire camphor-derived unit), the two protons on each `-CH2-` are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. This results in two distinct signals for the linker protons.\n4.  **Count the signals from one chiral substituent.** Since the three substituents are equivalent, we only need to count the non-equivalent protons in one. The camphor-derived unit is rigid and chiral, with no internal symmetry. Therefore, we count the number of protons in unique constitutional positions:\n    *   There is one proton on the pyrazole ring portion.\n    *   There are three distinct methyl groups, which are all non-equivalent.\n    *   There is one proton on a bridgehead carbon.\n    *   There are two `CH2` groups in the bicyclic framework. The four protons in these two groups are all non-equivalent (diastereotopic).\n    *   This gives a total of 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 9 signals from the substituent.\n5.  **Sum the signals.** We add the signals from the core, the linker, and one substituent to find the total number of peaks.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis for determining the number of 1H NMR peaks:\")\n\n    # 1.
