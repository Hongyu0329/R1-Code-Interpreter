    "The problem asks for the maximum generalized hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, with the condition that we do not assume a constant bound on the rank of the hypergraph.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Define Generalized Hypertreewidth (ghtw):** A generalized tree decomposition of a hypergraph H=(V, E) is a pair consisting of a tree T and a set of \"bags\" `B_t` (subsets of V) for each node `t` in T. This pair must satisfy two properties:\n    *   For every hyperedge `e` in E, there is a bag `B_t` that is a superset of `e`.\n    *   For every vertex `v` in V, the set of nodes `t` whose bags `B_t` contain `v` forms a connected subtree in T.\n    The width of such a decomposition is the size of the largest bag minus one (`max|B_t| - 1`). The `ghtw` of H is the minimum width over all possible decompositions.\n\n2.  **Establish a Lower Bound:** From the definition, for any hyperedge `e` in the hypergraph, at least one bag in any valid decomposition must contain all the vertices of `e`. This means the size of the largest bag must be at least the size of the largest hyperedge. The size of the largest hyperedge is called the rank of the hypergraph, `rank(H)`. Therefore, for any hypergraph H, its generalized hypertreewidth is bounded below by its rank: `ghtw(H) >= rank(H) - 1`.\n\n3.  **Use the Problem's Conditions:** The problem states that the hypergraph has 3 hyperedges and, crucially, that there is no constant bound on its rank. This means we can construct a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges where one hyperedge is arbitrarily large.\n\n4.  **Show Unboundedness:** Since `ghtw(H) >= rank(H) - 1` and `rank(H)` can be arbitrarily large, the generalized hypertreewidth is also unbounded. There is no finite maximum value.\n\n5.  **Demonstrate with Code:** I will write a Python script to demonstrate this. The script will take a desired width `W` and construct a hypergraph with 3 edges that has a generalized hypertreewidth of exactly `W`. This shows that the `ghtw` can be any non-negative integer, and thus its maximum is not a finite number. The script will also print the final equation for the `ghtw` calculation for the constructed example, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_unbounded_ghtw(target_width):\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates that the generalized hypertreewidth for a hypergraph\n    with 3 edges and unbounded rank is itself unbounded.\n\n    Args:\n        target_width (int): The target generalized hypertreewidth to demonstrate.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(target_width, int) or target_width < 0:\n        print(\"Error: Please provide a non-negative integer for the target width.\")\n        return\n\n    # To construct a hypergraph with a generalized hypertreewidth of 'target_width',\n    # we need its largest hyperedge to have a size of 'target_width + 1'.\n    e1_size = target_width + 1\n\n    # Define the three hyperedges.
