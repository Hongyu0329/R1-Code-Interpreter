    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe film you're referring to is \"The Godfather Part II.\" The character is Fredo Corleone. After Michael Corleone discovers Fredo's betrayal, Fredo panics and attempts to flee. During his desperate escape, he gets on a bus and says \"Thank you\" to the driver. This happens just before he is caught by Michael's men, sealing his tragic fate. The film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and won six, including Best Picture.\n\nHere is a Python script that will print the name of the film.\n\n```python\ndef find_film():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the film based on a specific scene description.\n    The scene described is from an Oscar-nominated film where a character's fate is sealed\n    after saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus.\n\n    - Character: Fredo Corleone\n    - Context: Fleeing after betraying his brother, Michael.\n    - Film: The Godfather Part II\n    \"\"\"\n    film_title = \"The Godfather Part II\"\n    print(film_title)\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_film()\n```\n<<<The Godfather Part II>>>"
