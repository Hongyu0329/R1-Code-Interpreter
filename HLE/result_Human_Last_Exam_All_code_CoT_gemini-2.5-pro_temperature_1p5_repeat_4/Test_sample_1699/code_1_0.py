# The user wants to know the best first move for Black to eliminate all White stones.
# Based on the analysis, the vital point is (2,4).
# This move initiates a sequence that leads to the capture of all white stones,
# even against White's best defense.

# The coordinate of the first move is (row, column).
row = 2
column = 4

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# Since there is no equation, we will simply print the chosen coordinate.
