    # The core problem is the non-identifiability of speciation (lambda) and extinction (mu) rates
    # from a phylogeny of only extant species. This means multiple pairs of (lambda(t), mu(t))
    # functions can give the same likelihood for a given tree.

    # We evaluate each strategy to see if it helps. A strategy helps if it adds new information
    # or reparameterizes the model to infer an identifiable quantity.

    # Strategy A: Fit a model with 10 constant pieces.
    # This is a parameterization choice. It discretizes time but doesn't solve the fundamental
    # issue that within each time slice, lambda and mu are not identifiable.
    # It does not add new information. It does not help.

    # Strategy B: Use priors in a Bayesian framework.
    # Priors add external information, constraining the possible parameter values. This helps.

    # Strategy C: Fit a model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5.
    # This is an extremely flexible parameterization, introducing many parameters.
    # A highly flexible model will have a larger space of congruent scenarios,
    # making the identifiability problem worse, not better. It does not help.

    # Strategy D & F: Incorporate fossils.
    # Fossils provide direct evidence of extinct lineages, which is the information missing
    # from extant phylogenies. This is a key way to solve the problem. This helps.

    # Strategy E & G: Reparametrize to infer pulled rates.
    # Pulled rates are combinations of lambda and mu that are identifiable from the data.
    # Inferring them directly sidesteps the problem. This helps.

    # Comparing A and C: Both are parameterization choices that do not fundamentally help.
    # However, C introduces massive flexibility, which actively makes the model harder
    # to estimate and more prone to non-identifiability issues. It's a textbook example
    # of a strategy that is not helpful.

    print("The strategy that does NOT help mitigate the identifiability issue is 'C'.")
    print("\nExplanation:")
    print("The core problem is that information about extinct lineages is lost when we only have a phylogeny of extant species. This makes the speciation rate (λ) and extinction rate (μ) impossible to disentangle—this is the non-identifiability problem.")
    print("\nStrategies that help must either:")
    print("1. Add new information (e.g., priors from other studies, or fossil data which directly records extinctions).")
    print("2. Re-parameterize the model to focus on quantities that *are* identifiable from the data (e.g., the 'pulled' rates).")
    print("\nLet's analyze option C:")
    print("'C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5'")
    print("This strategy describes a very flexible and complex way to parameterize the rates λ(t) and μ(t). A 5th-degree polynomial is a complex curve, and using one for each of 10 different time intervals creates a model with a very large number of parameters.")
    print("This approach does NOT add new information to the model. Instead, it increases the model's flexibility, allowing it to describe an even wider range of scenarios. This flexibility makes the non-identifiability problem worse, as there will be even more combinations of λ and μ that can explain the data equally well. Therefore, it does not help mitigate the issue.")
