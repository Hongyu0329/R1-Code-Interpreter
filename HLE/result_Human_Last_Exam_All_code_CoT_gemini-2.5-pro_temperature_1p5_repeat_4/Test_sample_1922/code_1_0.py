        'A': "CORRECT. Augustine's ideas on predestination are widely seen as a major theological precursor to Calvinism, making this a common point of discussion.",
        'B': "INCORRECT. R.A. Markus is a renowned scholar of Augustine. It is inconceivable that he would analyze Augustine's concept of freedom while 'ignoring his thoughts on predestination and grace.' These concepts are absolutely central to Augustine's theology and any serious scholarly discussion of his view on freedom must engage with them directly. This statement misrepresents Markus's scholarship.",
        'C': "CORRECT. Augustine extensively discusses the 'voluntas' (will) as a faculty of the human soul or psyche, and his work often engages with classical thinkers like Seneca.",
        'D': "CORRECT. This is a fundamental aspect of Augustinian thought. His philosophy and theology are deeply intertwined; one cannot be understood without the other.",
        'E': "CORRECT. Ã‰tienne Gilson was a prominent scholar who correctly distinguished Augustine's nuanced view of 'irresistible grace' from the more rigid, later interpretations of the Jansenists.",
        'F': "CORRECT. This accurately reflects a key argument from Augustine's dialogue 'On Free Will' ('De libero arbitrio'), where he establishes human responsibility for sin stemming from the misuse of the will."
