    # In SKI combinator logic, an expression of the form S(I)(n) acts as a successor
    # function when n is a Church numeral. It effectively adds 1 to the number n.

    # The given expression is: S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))
    # This can be seen as applying a successor function S(I) three times to a base number.
    # The structure is: succ(succ(succ(n_0))), where succ = S(I).

    # The base number n_0 is the innermost part:
    # n_0 = K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))
    # This can be written more simply using the standard B combinator (for composition):
    # B = S(S(K(S))(K))
    # and the omega combinator (for self-application):
    # omega = S(I)(I)
    # So, n_0 = K(B(I))(B(omega))

    # The K combinator is defined as K(x)(y) = x.
    # When we evaluate n_0, K takes B(I) as its 'x' and B(omega) as its 'y'.
    # Therefore, the entire expression for n_0 simplifies to B(I).
    # n_0 --> B(I)

    # Now we determine what number B(I) represents.
    # The B combinator is defined as B(f)(g)(x) = f(g(x)).
    # If we set f = I, we get B(I)(g)(x) = I(g(x)) = g(x).
    # This means that B(I) is functionally identical to the identity combinator, I.
    # The combinator I represents the Church numeral for 1, because for any function 'f'
    # and value 'x', I(f)(x) = f(x), which is one application of f.
    
    n_0 = 1
    
    # We started with n_0 and applied the successor function S(I) three times.
    # succ(n_0) = 1 + 1 = 2
    # succ(succ(n_0)) = 2 + 1 = 3
    # succ(succ(succ(n_0))) = 3 + 1 = 4
    n = n_0 + 3

    # The problem asks for the value of log_2(n).
    log_value = math.log2(n)

    print(f"The church integer n is {n}.")
