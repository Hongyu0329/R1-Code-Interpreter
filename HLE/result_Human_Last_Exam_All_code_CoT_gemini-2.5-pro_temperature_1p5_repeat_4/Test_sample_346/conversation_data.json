    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression**: The expression is complex, so I'll first break it down into more manageable parts based on its structure. I will identify that the expression is built by repeatedly applying a \"successor\" combinator to a base number combinator.\n2.  **Identify the Successor Combinator**: I'll recognize the pattern `S(I)` and demonstrate that it functions as a successor operation for Church numerals (i.e., `S(I)(n)` represents `n+1`).\n3.  **Identify and Simplify the Base Number (`n_0`)**: I will isolate the innermost expression, which represents the starting number `n_0`. I'll show that this complex-looking combinator expression simplifies to a much more basic combinator.\n4.  **Determine the Value of `n_0`**: I'll show that the simplified base expression is equivalent to the Church numeral for 1.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Integer `n`**: By starting with `n_0=1` and applying the successor combinator three times, I will calculate the final value of the Church integer `n`.\n6.  **Compute the Final Answer**: Finally, I will calculate `log_2(n)` as requested.\n\nI will implement this logic in Python, using functions to represent the combinators to verify the step-by-step simplification.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the problem by representing SKI combinators as Python functions\n    to programmatically prove the value of the Church integer and calculate its logarithm.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In SKI combinator logic, an expression of the form S(I)(n) acts as a successor\n    # function when n is a Church numeral.
