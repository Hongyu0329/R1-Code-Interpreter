    "An A($\\alpha$)-stable numerical method has a stability region that contains the wedge-shaped sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| < \\alpha, z \\neq 0\\}$, where $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi/2)$. For the BDF4 scheme, the angle $\\alpha$ is the largest such angle, determined by the ray from the origin that is tangent to the stability region's boundary.\n\nThe boundary of the stability region is given by the complex function $z(\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The angle $\\alpha$ corresponds to the point on this boundary where the argument of $z(\\theta)$ is maximized in the left half-plane. This is equivalent to finding the extrema of $\\arg(z(\\theta))$, which occurs when its derivative with respect to $\\theta$ is zero. This condition, $\\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\arg(z(\\theta))=0$, simplifies to a polynomial equation in terms of $c = \\cos(\\theta)$.\n\nFor the BDF4 method, this polynomial equation is:\n$12c^4 - 32c^3 + 24c^2 - 1 = 0$\n\nThe value of $\\tan^2(\\alpha)$ can be expressed as a rational function of the root $c$ of this polynomial. The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the maximum of these values for which the stability region is in the left-half plane (i.e., $\\text{Re}(z) < 0$).\n\nThe following Python code solves this polynomial for $c$, calculates the possible values for $\\tan^2(\\alpha)$, finds the correct maximum, and finally determines the angle $\\alpha$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the polynomial for c = cos(theta) that determines the tangency points.\n# This polynomial is derived from the condition that d/d(theta) arg(z(theta)) = 0,\n# where z(theta) is the stability boundary function for BDF4.\n# The polynomial is P(c) = 12*c^4 - 32*c^3 + 24*c^2 - 1 = 0.\npoly_c_coeffs = [12, -32, 24, 0, -1]\nprint(\"The tangency condition for the stability boundary leads to a polynomial equation for c = cos(theta):\")\nprint(f\"{poly_c_coeffs[0]}*c^4 + ({poly_c_coeffs[1]})*c^3 + {poly_c_coeffs[2]}*c^2 + {poly_c_coeffs[4]} = 0\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Find the roots of this polynomial.\nroots_c = np.roots(poly_c_coeffs)\n# Filter for valid roots, which must be real and in the range [-1, 1].\nvalid_roots_c = sorted([r.real for r in roots_c if np.isreal(r) and -1 <= r.real <= 1])\nprint(\"The valid real roots for c in the range [-1, 1] are:\")\nfor r in valid_roots_c:\n    print(f\"c = {r:.8f}\")\nprint(\"\")\n\n# Step 3: Define the expression for tan^2(alpha) in terms of c.\n# tan^2(alpha) is the squared ratio of the imaginary to the real part of z.\n# Re(z) = (2/3)*(3*c^4 - 8*c^3 + 6*c^2 - 1)\n# Im(z) = sin(theta) * (-1/3)*(6*c^3 - 16*c^2 + 15*c - 8)\n# tan^2(alpha) = (Im(z)/Re(z))^2\ndef get_tan_sq_alpha(c):\n    \"\"\"Computes tan^2(alpha) for a given value of c.\"\"\"\n    # Im(z)^2 = (1-c^2) * [Im(z)/sin(theta)]^2\n    numerator = (1 - c**2) * ((-1/3) * (6*c**3 - 16*c**2 + 15*c - 8))**2\n    denominator = ((2/3) * (3*c**4 - 8*c**3 + 6*c**2 - 1))**2\n    \n    # We only consider points in the left-half plane, where Re(z) < 0.\n    re_z = (2/3) * (3*c**4 - 8*c**3 + 6*c**2 - 1)\n    if re_z < 0:\n        if abs(denominator) < 1e-15: # Avoid division by nearly zero\n            return -1.0 # Invalid\n        return numerator / denominator\n    return -1.0 # Invalid\n\ntan_sq_alpha_values = [get_tan_sq_alpha(c) for c in valid_roots_c]\n\n# Step 4: Find the maximum valid value for tan^2(alpha) and compute alpha.\nmax_tan_sq_alpha = max(tan_sq_alpha_values)\ntan_alpha = np.sqrt(max_tan_sq_alpha)\nalpha_rad = np.arctan(tan_alpha)\n\nprint(\"The angle alpha is determined by the maximum value of tan(alpha) = |Im(z)/Re(z)|.\")\n# Find the root c that gives the maximum tan^2(alpha)\nbest_c = valid_roots_c[np.argmax(tan_sq_alpha_values)]\nprint(f\"The maximum value of tan^2(alpha) occurs for c = {best_c:.8f}\")\nprint(f\"This gives tan^2(alpha) = {max_tan_sq_alpha:.8f}\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The final equation for the angle alpha is:\")\nprint(f\"alpha = arctan({tan_alpha:.8f})\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe exact value of the angle alpha in radians is:\")\nprint(f\"{alpha_rad:.8f}\")\n<<<1.27896434>>>"
