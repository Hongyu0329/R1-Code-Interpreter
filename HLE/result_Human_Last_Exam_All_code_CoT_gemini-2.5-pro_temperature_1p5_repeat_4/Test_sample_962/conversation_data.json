    "Of course. Here is a plan to design and demonstrate a tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Choose the Scheme:** I will implement a simplified version of the **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)** scheme. FROST is a state-of-the-art threshold signature scheme known for its two-round signing variant and its tight security proof. It is based on the well-understood Schnorr signature algorithm.\n\n2.  **Simulation Setup:**\n    *   **Cryptography Primitives:** I'll use the `secp256k1` elliptic curve, which is the same curve used by Bitcoin and Ethereum. I will use the `py_ecc` library for the necessary elliptic curve operations.\n    *   **Parameters:** I will set `n=5` (total participants) and `t=3` (threshold).\n    *   **Distributed Key Generation (DKG):** A full DKG protocol is complex. For this demonstration, I will simulate it with a trusted \"dealer.\" The dealer will:\n        *   Create a secret polynomial of degree `t-1`. The constant term of this polynomial is the master secret key.\n        *   Generate a secret share for each of the `n` participants.\n        *   Compute and publish the public verification key for each participant's share, as well as the group's main public key.\n\n3.  **Signing Protocol (Two Rounds):**\n    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** A subset of `t` participants decides to sign a message. Each participant will:\n        1.  Generate a secret nonce.\n        2.  Compute and broadcast a public commitment (an elliptic curve point) corresponding to their nonce.\n    *   **Round 2 (Response):** After receiving commitments from all other signers, each participant will:\n        1.  Compute the group commitment `R` and the challenge `c` (a hash of `R`, the group public key, and the message).\n        2.  Calculate their partial signature using their secret share, nonce, and the group challenge `c`.\n        3.  Broadcast their partial signature.\n\n4.  **Signature Aggregation and Verification:**\n    *   An aggregator (which can be one of the signers) collects `t` partial signatures.\n    *   It sums them up to create the final signature `(R, z)`.\n    *   Finally, I will demonstrate how anyone can verify this signature using the group's public key and the verification equation. The code will explicitly print out this final equation with its components.\n\nThis illustrative code will walk through the core mathematical steps of a two-round threshold signature scheme, providing a clear example of its design.\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport random\nfrom py_ecc.secp256k1 import G, add, multiply, N\n\n# ---\n# Plan:\n# 1.
