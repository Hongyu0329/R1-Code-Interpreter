    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, then calculate the consumer surplus and producer surplus at that equilibrium point. The total welfare is the sum of these two surpluses.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium:** The market is in equilibrium when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (`Q_S = Q_D = Q_e`). I will find this equilibrium quantity (`Q_e`) by numerically solving the equation where the supply price equals the demand price: `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`. Once `Q_e` is found, I will calculate the equilibrium price (`P_e`) by plugging `Q_e` into either function.\n2.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS):** This represents the total benefit to consumers. It is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price. I will calculate it using the definite integral: `CS = ∫[from 0 to Q_e] (18 * e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - P_e * Q_e`.\n3.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS):** This represents the total benefit to producers. It is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. The supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is defined only when `Q^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. Therefore, the integration starts from this minimum quantity. I will calculate it using the formula: `PS = P_e * Q_e - ∫[from 2^(1/3) to Q_e] (ln(Q^3 - 2)) dQ`.\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare:** Total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus: `Total Welfare = CS + PS`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `scipy` library for the required numerical calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_and_calculate_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the market equilibrium and total welfare based on\n    the given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define supply and demand functions\n    def supply(Q):\n        # Supply function is valid only for Q^3 - 2 > 0.\n        # This check prevents math domain errors during the solving process.\n        if np.any(Q**3 <= 2):\n            return np.inf  # Return a large number if outside the domain\n        return np.log(Q**3 - 2)\n\n    def demand(Q):\n        return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(Q))\n\n    # Function to find the root of (Demand - Supply = 0)\n    def equilibrium_equation(Q):\n        # fsolve works with arrays, so we extract the single element.\n        q_val = Q[0]\n        return demand(q_val) - supply(q_val)\n\n    # 2. Find Market Equilibrium (Q_e, P_e)\n    # Provide an initial guess for the solver. A simple plot or a few test values\n    # suggest the equilibrium is around Q=4.5.\n    initial_guess = [4.5]\n    Q_e = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, initial_guess)[0]\n\n    # Calculate equilibrium price using the demand function\n    P_e = demand(Q_e)\n\n    # 3. Calculate Consumer and Producer Surplus\n    # The lower bound for supply integration is where the supply function is defined.\n    # Q^3 - 2 > 0  => Q > 2^(1/3)\n    min_q_supply = np.cbrt(2)\n    \n    # Integrate the demand function from 0 to Q_e\n    integral_demand, _ = quad(demand, 0, Q_e)\n    \n    # Integrate the supply function from its minimum valid Q to Q_e\n    integral_supply, _ = quad(supply, min_q_supply, Q_e)\n\n    # Calculate consumer surplus\n    consumer_surplus = integral_demand - (P_e * Q_e)\n    \n    # Calculate producer surplus\n    producer_surplus = (P_e * Q_e) - integral_supply\n\n    # 4. Calculate Total Welfare\n    total_welfare = consumer_surplus + producer_surplus\n\n    # Print the results as an equation\n    print(\"Finding Total Welfare: Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus\")\n    print(f\"Equilibrium Quantity (Q_e) = {Q_e:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Equilibrium Price (P_e) = {P_e:.4f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"Consumer Surplus = {consumer_surplus:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Producer Surplus = {producer_surplus:.4f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Total Welfare = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus\")\n    print(f\"Total Welfare = {consumer_surplus:.4f} + {producer_surplus:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Welfare = {total_welfare:.4f}\")\n\n# Run the calculation and print the output\nsolve_and_calculate_welfare()\n```\n<<<18.6222>>>"
