    This script calculates the final output of a quantum-classical hybrid system.

    The logic follows these steps:
    1. The initial input is classical 0, represented as the quantum state |0>.
    2. The first gate, A, creates a special superposition state. A key property of this state (Rule R1) is that when measured, it always collapses to 1.
    3. The second gate, B, performs this measurement. Therefore, the outcome is deterministically 1, and the system's state becomes |1>.
    4. This process is independent of the input to gate A, so for every 'ABC' sequence, the state entering gate C is always |1>.
    5. The final gate, C, takes the state |1> and applies its translation formula to get the final classical output bit.
