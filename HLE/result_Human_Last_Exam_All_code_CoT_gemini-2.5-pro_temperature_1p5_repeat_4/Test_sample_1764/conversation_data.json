    "Answering this question requires reasoning about the properties of metric spaces and mappings, rather than a numerical computation. However, I can encapsulate the logical deduction within a Python script that prints the explanation and the final answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Definitions:** I will first break down the terms in the question: \"finite ultrametric space,\" \"Banach space,\" \"cardinality K,\" and \"isometric embedding.\"\n2.  **Lower Bound on the Number of Embeddings:** I will show that if at least one isometric embedding exists from a space $X$ to a Banach space $B$, then there must be at least $|B| = K$ such embeddings, due to translations.\n3.  **Minimization Strategy:** To find the \"smallest possible number\" of embeddings, we should look for the scenario that minimizes this lower bound. This involves finding a valid Banach space with the smallest possible cardinality, $K$.\n4.  **The Trivial Case:** I will consider the simplest possible Banach space, the trivial space $B = \\{0\\}$, which has the smallest possible cardinality, $K=1$.\n5.  **Existence of Embedding:** I will determine for which finite ultrametric space $X$ an isometric embedding into $B=\\{0\\}$ can exist. This will constrain the choice of $X$.\n6.  **Calculate the Number of Embeddings:** For the specific $X$ and $B$ identified in the previous steps, I will calculate the exact number of possible isometric embeddings.\n7.  **Conclusion:** By combining the lower bound with the number found in the specific case, I will arrive at the final minimal number.\n8.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to print out this entire reasoning process, culminating in the final answer, fulfilling the user's request format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_math_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the reasoning to find the smallest possible number of\n    isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space X in a Banach space B.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the problem.\")\n    print(\"Let N be the number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B of cardinality K.\")\n    print(\"An isometric embedding is a function f: X -> B such that the distance between points is preserved.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the minimum possible value of N, given that we can choose X and B (where at least one embedding exists).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Finding a lower bound for N.\")\n    print(\"Let f: X -> B be an isometric embedding.

Let's define a new map f_v(x) = f(x) + v.\")\n    print(\"The map f_v is also an isometric embedding because ||f_v(x) - f_v(y)|| = ||(f(x)+v) - (f(y)+v)|| = ||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x, y).\")\n    print(\"Since each distinct vector v in B gives a distinct map f_v, there are at least |B| = K embeddings.\")\n    print(\"So, N >= K.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Minimizing the lower bound.\")\n    print(\"To find the smallest possible value of N, we should try to find the smallest possible value for K, the cardinality of the Banach space B.\")\n    print(\"A Banach space must be a complete normed vector space.

We must now check if an isometric embedding can exist in this case.\")\n    print(\"An embedding f: X -> {0} must map every element x in X to the zero vector.\")\n    print(\"The isometric condition is d(x, y) = ||f(x) - f(y)|| = ||0 - 0|| = 0.\")\n    print(\"This means that for an embedding to exist, the distance between ANY two points x, y in X must be 0.\")\n    print(\"According to the properties of a metric space, d(x, y) = 0 if and only if x = y.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, X can contain at most one point. Let's choose X to be a single-point space, e.g., X = {p}.\")\n    print(\"A single-point space is a valid finite ultrametric space.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 5: Calculating N for the minimal case.\")\n    print(\"Let's choose X = {p} and B = {0}.\")\n    print(\"We need to find the number of isometric embeddings from X to B.\")\n    print(\"An embedding is a function f: {p} -> {0}.
