    print("Step 1: Understanding the problem.")
    print("Let N be the number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B of cardinality K.")
    print("An isometric embedding is a function f: X -> B such that the distance between points is preserved.")
    print("We want to find the minimum possible value of N, given that we can choose X and B (where at least one embedding exists).\n")

    print("Step 2: Finding a lower bound for N.")
    print("Let f: X -> B be an isometric embedding. This means ||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x, y) for all x, y in X.")
    print("Consider a translation by any vector v in B. Let's define a new map f_v(x) = f(x) + v.")
    print("The map f_v is also an isometric embedding because ||f_v(x) - f_v(y)|| = ||(f(x)+v) - (f(y)+v)|| = ||f(x) - f(y)|| = d(x, y).")
    print("Since each distinct vector v in B gives a distinct map f_v, there are at least |B| = K embeddings.")
    print("So, N >= K.\n")

    print("Step 3: Minimizing the lower bound.")
    print("To find the smallest possible value of N, we should try to find the smallest possible value for K, the cardinality of the Banach space B.")
    print("A Banach space must be a complete normed vector space. The simplest such space is the trivial vector space containing only the zero vector: B = {0}.")
    print("This is a valid Banach space, and its cardinality is K = 1.\n")

    print("Step 4: Checking for existence of embeddings in B = {0}.")
    print("For B = {0}, the lower bound for N is 1. We must now check if an isometric embedding can exist in this case.")
    print("An embedding f: X -> {0} must map every element x in X to the zero vector.")
    print("The isometric condition is d(x, y) = ||f(x) - f(y)|| = ||0 - 0|| = 0.")
    print("This means that for an embedding to exist, the distance between ANY two points x, y in X must be 0.")
    print("According to the properties of a metric space, d(x, y) = 0 if and only if x = y.")
    print("Therefore, X can contain at most one point. Let's choose X to be a single-point space, e.g., X = {p}.")
    print("A single-point space is a valid finite ultrametric space.\n")

    print("Step 5: Calculating N for the minimal case.")
    print("Let's choose X = {p} and B = {0}.")
    print("We need to find the number of isometric embeddings from X to B.")
    print("An embedding is a function f: {p} -> {0}. There is only one such function: the one that maps p to 0.")
    print("We've already established this function is an isometric embedding.")
    print("So, for this choice of X and B, the number of embeddings N is exactly 1.\n")

    print("Step 6: Final Conclusion.")
    print("We showed that the number of embeddings N must be at least 1 (since N >= K and K >= 1).")
    print("We found a specific case (X = {p}, B = {0}) where the number of embeddings is exactly 1.")
    print("Therefore, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 1.")

    print("The final equation for the smallest possible number of embeddings N is:")
    final_equation = "N = 1"

    # As requested, outputting each number in the final equation.
    # The only number in 'N = 1' is 1.
