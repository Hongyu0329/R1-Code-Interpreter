    print("The problem defines a directed graph G whose vertices are the real numbers (R),")
    print("and there's an edge from x to y if and only if x < y.")
    print("X is the line graph of G. This means:")
    print(" - A vertex in X represents an edge in G. So, a vertex is a pair (a, b) where a, b are real numbers and a < b.")
    print(" - Two vertices in X, v1 = (a1, b1) and v2 = (a2, b2), are connected in the underlying undirected graph if the end of one edge is the start of the other.")

    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("Let's assume a clique of size 3 exists: C = {v1, v2, v3}.")
    print("Let v1 = (a1, b1), v2 = (a2, b2), v3 = (a3, b3).")
    print("A key property (provable from the adjacency condition and a < b) is that for any two vertices in a clique, their start points must be distinct, and their end points must be distinct.")
    print("This means a1, a2, a3 are all different, and b1, b2, b3 are all different.")

    print("\nLet's check the adjacency conditions:")
    print("1. v1 and v2 are adjacent: WLOG, let b1 = a2.")
    print("   This gives us the vertices v1 = (a1, b1) and v2 = (b1, b2).")
    print("   From the definition of vertices in X, we have the inequalities: a1 < b1 and b1 < b2.")

    print("2. v1 and v3 are adjacent: b1 = a3 or b3 = a1.")
    print("   The case b1 = a3 is impossible, because a2 = b1, and start points (a2, a3) must be distinct.")
    print("   So, we must have b3 = a1. This means v3 = (a3, a1), and we must have a3 < a1.")

    print("3. v2 and v3 are adjacent: b2 = a3 or b3 = a2.")
    print("   The case b3 = a2 is impossible. From above, b3=a1 and a2=b1, so this would mean a1=b1, which contradicts a1 < b1.")

    print("----------------------------------------")
    print("We have shown that the clique number must be less than 3.")
    print("A clique of size 2 can be easily found. For example, v1 = (1, 2) and v2 = (2, 3).")
    print("They are adjacent because the end point of v1 (which is 2) equals the start point of v2 (which is 2).")
    print("Since a clique of size 3 is impossible and a clique of size 2 is possible, the clique number is 2.")
