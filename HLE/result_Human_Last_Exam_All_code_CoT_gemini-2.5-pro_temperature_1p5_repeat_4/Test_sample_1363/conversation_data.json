    "My thinking process to arrive at the solution is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify which of the five standard ballroom dances has such a rigid technique that a specific figure, the \"Reverse Turn\" (a left turn), cannot be turned more than its standard amount (\"overturned\") without breaking the fundamental rules of that dance.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Technical Concepts:**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A fundamental figure in all five dances, involving a turn to the left.\n    *   **Overturning:** Intentionally rotating more than the syllabus amount for a given figure. This is often done for navigational purposes or as a specific, named variation.\n    *   **Disregarding the Technique:** This means violating the foundational principles of a dance. The most important principles to consider here are Rise and Fall, Sway, Footwork (Heel/Toe leads), and the nature of the movement (e.g., smooth swing vs. staccato).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Dance Option:**\n    *   **A, B, D, E (Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, Quickstep):** These are all classified as \"swing dances.\" They generate power and rotation through momentum, body swing, and controlled Rise and Fall. Because their technique is built on creating and managing this flowing movement, it is flexible enough to allow for variations in the amount of turn. In fact, overturned versions of Reverse Turns are standard, syllabus figures in the English Waltz and Slow Foxtrot. While perhaps less common or desirable in Quickstep and Viennese Waltz, the underlying swing technique does not make it *impossible*. It's a matter of control, not a technical contradiction.\n\n    *   **C (European Tango):** The Tango stands apart from the other four. Its technique is fundamentally different. It is *not* a swing dance. Its defining characteristics are:\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dancers maintain a constant level, moving with \"stolen\" steps and keeping their knees flexed and weight low.\n        *   **No Sway:** The body is held upright without the inclination (sway) seen in swing dances.\n        *   **Staccato Action:** Movement is sharp, deliberate, and clipped, not smooth and flowing.\n        *   **Grounded Movement:** The feet are picked up and placed, not glided across the floor with the same heel leads as in swing dances.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** To overturn a Reverse Turn, a dancer needs to generate extra rotation. In swing dances, this is achieved by increasing the swing, using more Rise and Fall, and leveraging momentum. If you were to attempt this in a Tango, you would be forced to introduce swing and rise, directly violating the \"no Rise and Fall\" and \"no swing\" foundations of the dance. The sharp, grounded, staccato technique of the Tango simply does not provide a mechanism to generate that extra rotation. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a Tango Reverse Turn without completely disregarding its core technique.\n\nBased on this analysis, the European Tango is the correct answer. I will now create a simple Python script to present this answer, as requested by the prompt format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the technical requirements of standard ballroom dances\n    to determine in which one it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn\n    without disregarding its core technique.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The five dance choices provided in the question.\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz',\n        'B': 'English Waltz',\n        'C': 'European Tango',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrott',\n        'E': 'Quickstep'\n    }\n\n    # The correct answer is European Tango.\n    correct_answer_key = 'C'\n    \n    # Explanation:\n    # The other four dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep) are \"swing\" dances. They use\n    # momentum, rise and fall, and sway to generate rotation. In these dances,\n    # overturning a figure is technically possible and often exists as a recognized variation.\n    #\n    # The European Tango is unique. Its technique forbids Rise and Fall and Sway.\n    # Movement is sharp and staccato, not swinging. Attempting to add extra rotation\n    # (overturning) would require generating momentum through swing and rise, which\n    # fundamentally violates the core technique of the Tango.\n\n    print(f\"The question asks in which dance it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique.\")\n    print(f\"The correct choice is '{correct_answer_key}'.\")\n    print(f\"The dance is: {choices[correct_answer_key]}.\")\n    print(\"\\nReasoning: The European Tango's technique of 'no rise and fall' and 'no sway' makes it technically impossible to generate the momentum required for an overturn without breaking these fundamental rules.\")\n\nsolve_dance_question()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
