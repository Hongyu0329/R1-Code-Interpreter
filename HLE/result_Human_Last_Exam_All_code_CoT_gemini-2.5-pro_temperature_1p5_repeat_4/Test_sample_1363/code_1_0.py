    # Explanation:
    # The other four dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep) are "swing" dances. They use
    # momentum, rise and fall, and sway to generate rotation. In these dances,
    # overturning a figure is technically possible and often exists as a recognized variation.
    #
    # The European Tango is unique. Its technique forbids Rise and Fall and Sway.
    # Movement is sharp and staccato, not swinging. Attempting to add extra rotation
    # (overturning) would require generating momentum through swing and rise, which
    # fundamentally violates the core technique of the Tango.
