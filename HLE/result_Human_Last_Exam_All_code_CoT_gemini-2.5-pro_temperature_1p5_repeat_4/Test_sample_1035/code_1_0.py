    Calculates the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover a complete graph K_n.

    The problem is to find the minimum number of bipartite graphs whose edge sets
    cover all the edges of the complete graph K_n, where n=35.

    This is a classic result in graph theory. The minimum number of bipartite
    subgraphs required to cover the complete graph K_n is n-1.

    For n = 35, the result is 35 - 1 = 34.
