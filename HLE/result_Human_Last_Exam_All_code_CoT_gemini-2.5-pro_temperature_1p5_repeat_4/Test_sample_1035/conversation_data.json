    "This problem asks for the minimum size of a family of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of a complete graph on 35 vertices, $K_{35}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Question:** The question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\". This phrasing is ambiguous. The most common and standard interpretation of this problem in graph theory is that it asks for the minimum number of **graphs** in the family, not the sum of vertices or any other vertex-related measure. This quantity is known as the bipartite dimension of the complete graph. Any other interpretation would either be trivial or lead to a much more complex, research-level problem, which is likely not the intent.\n2.  **State the Relevant Theorem:** A well-known theorem in graph theory, a generalization of the Graham-Pollak theorem by Tverberg, states that the minimum number of bipartite subgraphs needed to cover all edges of the complete graph $K_n$ is exactly $n-1$.\n3.  **Apply the Theorem to the Specific Case:** In this problem, the complete graph is $K_n$ with $n=35$.\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** Using the formula from the theorem, the minimum number of bipartite graphs is $n-1 = 35 - 1 = 34$.\n5.  **Generate the Code:** I will write a simple Python script to perform this calculation and print the explanation and the result as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bipartite_covering():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover a complete graph K_n.\n\n    The problem is to find the minimum number of bipartite graphs whose edge sets\n    cover all the edges of the complete graph K_n, where n=35.\n\n    This is a classic result in graph theory. The minimum number of bipartite\n    subgraphs required to cover the complete graph K_n is n-1.\n\n    For n = 35, the result is 35 - 1 = 34.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the complete graph K_n.\n    n = 35\n\n    # The minimum number of bipartite graphs required to cover K_n is n - 1.\n    min_graphs = n - 1\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the minimum number of bipartite graphs that cover all edges of the complete graph K_n for n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"According to a theorem by Graham, Pollak, and Tverberg, this number is exactly n - 1.\")\n    print(f\"The final calculation is: {n} - 1 = {min_graphs}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_bipartite_covering()\n```\n<<<34>>>"
