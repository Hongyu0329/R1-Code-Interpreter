def solve_homeomorphism_classes():
    """
    This function determines the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a space X
    with the given properties.

    The properties of X are:
    1. X is a compact topological space containing a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, omega_1).
       This implies X is a compactification of R.

    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous function on X.
       This is the defining universal property of the Stone-Čech compactification of a Tychonoff space.
       The long ray R is a Tychonoff space.

    Conclusion:
    The space X must be homeomorphic to the Stone-Čech compactification of the long ray, denoted beta R.
    The Stone-Čech compactification of a space is unique up to homeomorphism. This means that any two
    spaces satisfying these conditions are homeomorphic to each other.

    Therefore, there is only one such homeomorphism class.
