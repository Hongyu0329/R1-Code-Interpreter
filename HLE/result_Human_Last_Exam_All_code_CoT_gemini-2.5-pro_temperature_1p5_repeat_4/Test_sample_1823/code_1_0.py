# The user's request is a medical question that requires a logical explanation rather than code execution.
# The following text explains the reasoning behind the diagnosis.

# Step 1: Analyze the clinical information provided for the 1-year-old patient.
# Symptoms:
# - Hypertrophic scarring: Raised, thick scars, often from poor healing of skin lesions like ulcers.
# - Erythema: Redness of the skin, a sign of inflammation.
# - Spasticity: Increased muscle tone and stiffness, an upper motor neuron sign pointing to central nervous system involvement.
# Lab Results:
# - Negative for anti-Mi-2: This antibody is specific for a subset of Dermatomyositis, primarily in adults.

# Step 2: Evaluate the provided answer choices based on the clinical picture.
# A. Ectropion: This is the turning out of an eyelid. It is a symptom, not a systemic diagnosis, and doesn't explain the spasticity.
# B. McArdle disease: This is a metabolic muscle disease causing exercise intolerance. It doesn't cause spasticity or the described skin changes.
# C. Dermatomyositis: In its juvenile form (JDM), this disease is a systemic vasculopathy (inflammation of blood vessels).
#    - The vasculopathy can cause skin ulcerations which may heal with hypertrophic scarring. Erythema is a common feature.
#    - Though rare, the vasculopathy can affect the central nervous system, leading to stroke and resulting spasticity.
#    - Anti-Mi-2 antibodies are uncommon in JDM, so a negative test is the expected result for most juvenile cases.
#    - Therefore, this diagnosis fits all aspects of the patient's presentation.
# D. McCune Albright syndrome: This is a genetic disorder with a classic triad of fibrous dysplasia, caf√©-au-lait spots, and endocrine issues, which do not match the patient's signs.
# E. Cataracts: This is a clouding of the lens in the eye. It is a symptom, not a diagnosis that explains the patient's multisystem complaints.

# Step 3: Conclude the most likely diagnosis.
# Based on the analysis, Juvenile Dermatomyositis is the only option that accounts for the unique combination of inflammatory skin signs (erythema, hypertrophic scarring), central nervous system involvement (spasticity), and the negative anti-Mi-2 lab result in a patient of this age.
# The final answer is Dermatomyositis.
