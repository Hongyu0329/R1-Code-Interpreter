    # Step 1: Analyze the reaction.
    # The reaction is between Geraniol (a primary allylic alcohol) and O-(p-tolyl) chlorothionoformate.
    # Pyridine acts as a base. The initial product is an O-geranyl O'-(p-tolyl) thionocarbonate.
    # This thionocarbonate group is a good leaving group.

    # Step 2: Propose a rearrangement based on NMR data.
    # The problem states a peak in geraniol at 5.32-5.37 ppm (1H, multiplet) is replaced by
    # a peak at 5.97 ppm (1H, doublet of doublets) in Compound 1.
    # This suggests a change from geraniol's internal C=CH-CH2OH structure to a terminal
    # vinyl group (-CH=CH2), which is characteristic of a linalool skeleton.
    # The mechanism involves the thionocarbonate leaving, forming a primary geranyl carbocation,
    # which then rearranges to the more stable tertiary linalyl carbocation before the nucleophile re-attacks.

    # Step 3: Identify the final product.
    # The product is the result of this SN1' allylic rearrangement.
    compound_name = "O-linalyl O'-(p-tolyl) thionocarbonate"

    # Step 4: Present the conclusion with data from the problem.
