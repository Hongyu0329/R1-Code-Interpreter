def solve_category_count():
    """
    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.

    The logic is based on a case-by-case analysis of how the 4 morphisms can be
    distributed and how composition can be defined.

    Let the objects be A and B. There must be two identity morphisms, id_A and id_B.
    This leaves 2 non-identity morphisms, f and g. We classify categories based on
    the distribution of f and g into the four Hom-sets: Hom(A,A), Hom(A,B), Hom(B,A), Hom(B,B).
    
    Let n_XY be the number of morphisms from X to Y. The vector (n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)
    describes a distribution. The sum of its components must be 4.
