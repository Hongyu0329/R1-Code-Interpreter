    "To solve this problem, I will find the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  A category with 2 objects, say A and B, must have at least two identity morphisms, $id_A$ and $id_B$. With a total of 4 morphisms, this leaves 2 \"non-identity\" morphisms to place.\n2.  I will enumerate all possible ways to assign domains and codomains to these 2 non-identity morphisms. This gives 10 distinct distributions of morphisms into the sets $Hom(A, A)$, $Hom(A, B)$, $Hom(B, A)$, and $Hom(B, B)$.\n3.  Some of these distributions will lead to isomorphic categories. Specifically, if a distribution can be transformed into another by swapping the objects A and B, they belong to the same isomorphism group. I will group the 10 distributions accordingly.\n4.  For each group, I will determine the number of distinct, non-isomorphic category structures that can be defined. This involves analyzing the possible ways to define morphism composition while satisfying the associativity law. For some cases, this relies on the known classification of small monoids (categories with one object).\n5.  Finally, I will sum the counts from all the groups to get the total number of non-isomorphic categories.\n\nThe Python code below implements this summation, with comments explaining the count for each case.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n    The logic is based on a case-by-case analysis of how the 4 morphisms can be\n    distributed and how composition can be defined.\n\n    Let the objects be A and B. There must be two identity morphisms, id_A and id_B.\n    This leaves 2 non-identity morphisms, f and g. We classify categories based on\n    the distribution of f and g into the four Hom-sets: Hom(A,A), Hom(A,B), Hom(B,A), Hom(B,B).\n    \n    Let n_XY be the number of morphisms from X to Y. The vector (n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)\n    describes a distribution. The sum of its components must be 4.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Case 1: Distribution (3, 0, 0, 1).\n    # Hom(A,A) has 3 morphisms, Hom(B,B) has 1.
