    "This haiku is a riddle that describes a mathematical equation. My plan is to decode each line of the haiku to determine the numbers and the operator, and then use Python to perform the calculation and display the equation.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the haiku:\n\n1.  **\"The Bays\"**: The title sounds like \"The Bytes,\" which suggests the solution involves a bitwise operation, a fundamental concept in computing.\n2.  **\"An August tempest\"**: The month of August has 31 days. This line gives us the number `31`.\n3.  **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: \"Twice fifteen\" is `2 * 15`, which equals `30`. The phrase \"winds of change\" alludes to an operation that transforms or flips values. In the context of \"Bytes,\" this points to the bitwise XOR operator (`^`), which flips bits where they differ.\n4.  **\"A divine one yields\"**: This line tells us the result of the equation. \"Yields\" means equals, and \"a divine one\" is the number `1`.\n\nBased on this interpretation, the hidden equation is `31 ^ 30 = 1`. The following Python code will execute this calculation and print the full equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# The first number is derived from \"An August tempest\".\n# The month August has 31 days.\nnum1 = 31\n\n# The second number comes from \"Twice fifteen\".\n# 2 * 15 = 30.\nnum2 = 30\n\n# The operation is hinted at by \"The Bays\" (Bytes) and \"winds of change\".\n# This suggests a bitwise XOR operation (^).\nop_symbol = \"^\"\n\n# We perform the bitwise XOR calculation.\nresult = num1 ^ num2\n\n# The haiku states \"A divine one yields\", meaning the result is 1.\n# Our calculation confirms this: 31 (0b11111) XOR 30 (0b11110) = 1 (0b00001).\n# Now, we print the final equation, showing each number.\nprint(f\"{num1} {op_symbol} {num2} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<1>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    My haikus have titles, the one that follows is called “The Bays”.
