    print("4. In the Sicilian Defense (1. e4 c5 ...), the move ...a6 is the defining feature of the Najdorf Variation. It prevents White's pieces from using the b5 square and prepares a queenside expansion.")
    print("5. In the given position, White's move 6. a3 serves the exact same strategic purpose: it prevents Black's Knight or Bishop from coming to b4 and prepares for White's own queenside expansion with b4.")
    print("6. Therefore, White is employing a system identical in concept to the Sicilian Najdorf, but with the colors reversed and an extra tempo.")
    print("7. Comparing this to the other choices, the pawn structure and the specific strategic idea behind 6. a3 make it far more similar to the Sicilian Najdorf than to any other opening listed.")
    print("\nConclusion: The setup is most similar to the Sicilian Najdorf.")
