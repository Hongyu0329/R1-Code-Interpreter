# Final Answer Calculation

# Number of vertices (v) in the final graph skeleton.
# The vertices are: p (waistbands), j1 (P1's crotch), j2 (P2's crotch),
# l (left legs), r (right legs).
v = 5

# Number of edges (e) in the final graph skeleton.
# The edges connect:
# 1. p to j1
# 2. p to j2
# 3. j1 to l
# 4. j1 to r
# 5. j2 to l
# 6. j2 to r
e = 6

# The rank of the fundamental group (number of independent loops) for a
# connected graph is given by the formula: n = e - v + 1
n = e - v + 1

# The fundamental group of a graph is the free group on n generators, F_n.
# F_n is written as the free product of n copies of Z.
# For example, F_1 = Z, F_2 = Z * Z, F_3 = Z * Z * Z, etc.

print(f"Number of vertices (v): {v}")
print(f"Number of edges (e): {e}")
print(f"The rank of the fundamental group is n = e - v + 1 = {e} - {v} + 1 = {n}")
print(f"The fundamental group is the free group on {n} generators, F_{n}.")
print("This is commonly written as the free product of Z with itself n times.")

# Build the string representation for the answer
if n == 0:
    group_string = "0 (the trivial group)"
elif n == 1:
    group_string = "Z"
else:
    group_string = " * ".join(["Z"] * n)

print(f"The resulting group is {group_string}.")
print("This corresponds to option A.")
