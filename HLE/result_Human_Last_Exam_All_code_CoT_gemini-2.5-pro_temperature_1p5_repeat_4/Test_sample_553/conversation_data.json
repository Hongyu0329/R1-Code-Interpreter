    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a music theory question about the opening chords of a Beatles song.\n\nThe specific progression you're asking about is a jump from the tonic chord to the minor fifth chord. In music theory terms for a minor key, this is a `i` -> `v` progression. This is a very characteristic sound, and the song that uses it most prominently at its beginning is \"Things We Said Today.\"\n\nThe song is in the key of A minor. After a brief intro that establishes the A minor tonic chord, the verse begins with the line \"You say you will love me...\", where the chords move from A minor (the tonic, or `i`) to E minor (the minor fifth, or `v`).\n\nI will provide a Python script to lay out this analysis. The script will define the song, its key, and the relevant chords, and then print the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef identify_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the Beatles song that starts with a chord jump\n    from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Things We Said Today\"\n    key = \"A minor\"\n    \n    # In the key of A minor, the chords are derived from the A natural minor scale (A-B-C-D-E-F-G).\n    # The tonic (first degree) chord is A minor.\n    # The fifth degree chord (built on E) is E minor.\n    tonic_chord_name = \"A minor\"\n    tonic_chord_symbol = \"Am\"\n    \n    minor_fifth_chord_name = \"E minor\"\n    minor_fifth_chord_symbol = \"Em\"\n    \n    print(f\"The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is: '{song_title}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"The song is in the key of {key}.\")\n    print(\"The progression in question occurs at the start of the verse.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the final breakdown of the chord 'equation':\")\n    print(f\"1. The Tonic Chord: {tonic_chord_name} ({tonic_chord_symbol})\")\n    print(f\"2.
