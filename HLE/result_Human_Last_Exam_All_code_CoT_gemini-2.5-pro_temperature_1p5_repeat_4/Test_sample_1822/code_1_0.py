# 1. The strength of the initial evidence is the product of confidence and support (c * s).
# 2. The strength of the counter-evidence (c') is amplified by the structural bottleneck (beta).
#    A strong bottleneck (low beta) makes artifacts more likely, so the effective counter-evidence
#    is modeled as c' / beta.
