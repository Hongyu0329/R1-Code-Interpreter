    # Answers to the twelve questions in order.
    # Q1-Q4: Based on the "overshooting argument", where sums on the boundary grow faster than the target number k, making a(n) finite.
    # Q5: This is a known theorem, a(n) is bounded by a linear function of n.
    # Q6, Q7: These are proven lower bounds for d=3 and d=4 from mathematical literature.
    # Q8: This contradicts the extension of the conjecture for d=3,4, so it is likely false.
    # Q9: This is a conjecture that is not proven for all d>=2 (e.g., d=2 is open). Thus, it is not established as "true".
    # Q10-Q12: Analysis of the 1D case shows the process must stop after placing m=2 for any n>=2.
