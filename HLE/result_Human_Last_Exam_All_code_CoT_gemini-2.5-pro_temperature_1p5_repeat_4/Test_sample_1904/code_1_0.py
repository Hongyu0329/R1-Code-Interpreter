    This function explains and calculates the smallest possible number of connected components of CL(X).

    The space CL(X) is the set of non-empty closed subsets of an infinite,
    totally-disconnected ultrametric space X.

    The solution is based on constructing a specific space X for which we can prove
    CL(X) has exactly two components. Since the number of components must be greater than 1,
    this demonstrates that 2 is the minimum.

    The two components are:
    1. The component of non-empty bounded closed subsets.
    2. The component of non-empty unbounded closed subsets.

    For our chosen space, each of these is internally connected, and they are topologically
    separated from each other.
