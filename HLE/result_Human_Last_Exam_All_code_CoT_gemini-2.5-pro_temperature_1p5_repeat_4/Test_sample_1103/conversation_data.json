    "The Gauss class number problem involves finding the number of imaginary quadratic fields with a specific class number. For a given class number *h*, the task is to count how many negative fundamental discriminants *d* result in a class number *h(d) = h*.\n\nThis is a computationally intensive problem in number theory. The complete lists for class numbers up to 100 were determined by Mark Watkins in his Ph.D. thesis. We cannot compute this from scratch in a simple script, so we will rely on these established mathematical results.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that:\n1.  Stores the known result for class number 48 from Watkins's tables.\n2.  Prints this information to the user in a clear statement.\n\n```python\ndef solve_class_number_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the known count of negative fundamental discriminants for class number 48.\n\n    The Gauss class number problem, for a given integer h, is to find all imaginary\n    quadratic fields having class number h.
