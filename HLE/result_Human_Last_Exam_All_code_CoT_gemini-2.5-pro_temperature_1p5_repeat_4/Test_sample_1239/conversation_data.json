    "To determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations of the independent variables (time and space) and dependent variables (velocity and pressure) that leave the form of the equations unchanged. The dimension of the group is the total number of independent parameters required to specify these transformations.\n\nThe symmetries are as follows:\n\n1.  **Time translation:** The laws of physics do not depend on the choice of the time origin. This gives 1 dimension.\n    *   $t' = t + \\epsilon$\n2.  **Space translations:** The laws of physics are the same everywhere in space. Since space is 3-dimensional, this gives 3 dimensions.\n    *   $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$\n3.  **Spatial rotations:** The laws of physics are isotropic (the same in all directions). The group of rotations in 3D, SO(3), has a dimension of 3.\n    *   $\\mathbf{x}' = R\\mathbf{x}$\n4.  **Galilean boosts:** The equations are invariant under a transformation to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity. Since velocity is a 3D vector, this provides 3 dimensions.\n    *   $\\mathbf{x}' = \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u}' = \\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}$\n5.  **Scaling transformations:** The Navier-Stokes equations possess a non-trivial scaling symmetry. If we scale time by $a^2$ and space by $a$, the velocity scales by $a^{-1}$ and pressure by $a^{-2}$. This is a one-parameter group of transformations, so it contributes 1 dimension.\n    *   $t' = a^2 t$, $\\mathbf{x}' = a\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u}' = a^{-1}\\mathbf{u}$, $p' = a^{-2}p$\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of these individual symmetry groups. The following Python code calculates and displays this sum.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_lie_group_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the\n    3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Dimension from time translation (t -> t + a)\n    time_translation_dim = 1\n\n    # Dimension from space translations (x -> x + b) in R^3\n    space_translation_dim = 3\n\n    # Dimension from spatial rotations (x -> Rx) in R^3\n    rotation_dim = 3\n\n    # Dimension from Galilean boosts (x -> x - vt, u -> u - v) in R^3\n    galilean_boost_dim = 3\n\n    # Dimension from scaling symmetry (t -> a^2*t, x -> a*x, ...)\n    scaling_dim = 1\n\n    # Total dimension is the sum of all individual symmetry dimensions\n    total_dimension = (\n        time_translation_dim\n        + space_translation_dim\n        + rotation_dim\n        + galilean_boost_dim\n        + scaling_dim\n    )\n\n    print(\"The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is calculated by summing the dimensions of its constituent symmetries:\")\n    print(f\"Time Translations: {time_translation_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Space Translations: {space_translation_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Rotations: {rotation_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Galilean Boosts: {galilean_boost_dim}\")\n    print(f\"Scaling Symmetries: {scaling_dim}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Total Dimension =\",\n          f\" {time_translation_dim} + {space_translation_dim} + {rotation_dim} + {galilean_boost_dim} + {scaling_dim} =\",\n          f\" {total_dimension}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_lie_group_dimension()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
