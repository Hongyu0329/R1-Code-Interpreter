    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Riemann Tensor:** First, I'll start with the general Riemann curvature tensor, $R_{ijkl}$, and its standard symmetries on a general $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold.\n2.  **Introduce Kähler Manifolds:** I'll explain what a Kähler manifold is, noting that it has a complex structure compatible with its metric. The key is that the real dimension $n$ must be even, so we can write $n = 2m$, where $m$ is the complex dimension.\n3.  **Apply Kähler Symmetries:** The Kähler condition imposes additional, powerful symmetries on the Riemann tensor. I'll describe how these new symmetries drastically reduce the number of non-zero and independent components.\n4.  **Derive the Formula:** Using these symmetries, I'll count the remaining independent components. This involves seeing the tensor as a Hermitian matrix whose size is determined by the number of symmetric pairs of indices, $\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$. The number of independent real components in an $N \\times N$ Hermitian matrix is $N^2$.\n5.  **Develop Python Code:** I will write a Python script that implements the derived formula. The function will take the complex dimension `m` as input and print a step-by-step calculation of the number of independent Riemann tensor entries, as requested. The script will demonstrate this for a few example dimensions.\n\nHere is the derivation and the Python code:\n\nOn a Kähler manifold of complex dimension $m$ (and thus real dimension $n=2m$), the Riemann curvature tensor gains extra symmetries beyond those of a general Riemannian manifold. In a local complex coordinate system, the only non-zero components are of the form $R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta} \\gamma \\bar{\\delta}}$.\n\nThese components obey the following symmetries:\n1.  $R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta} \\gamma \\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\gamma \\bar{\\beta} \\alpha \\bar{\\delta}}$\n2.  $R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta} \\gamma \\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\delta} \\gamma \\bar{\\beta}}$\n3.  $R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta} \\gamma \\bar{\\delta}} = \\overline{R_{\\beta \\bar{\\alpha} \\delta \\bar{\\gamma}}}$ (Reality condition)\n\nThese symmetries imply that the tensor is fully determined by components $T_{I \\bar{J}} = R_{\\alpha \\bar{\\beta} \\gamma \\bar{\\delta}}$ where $I=(\\alpha, \\gamma)$ and $J=(\\beta, \\delta)$ are treated as symmetric multi-indices. The number of such symmetric indices is $N = \\binom{m+1}{2} = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$.\n\nThe reality condition means that if we view this tensor as an $N \\times N$ complex matrix, it must be Hermitian. The number of independent real components in an $N \\times N$ Hermitian matrix is $N^2$.\n\nTherefore, the number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension $m$ is:\n$$ \\text{Number of components} = \\left(\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\\right)^2 $$\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value for a given complex dimension `m`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_kahler_riemann_components(m: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of a given complex dimension.\n\n    Args:\n        m: The complex dimension of the Kähler manifold.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(m, int) or m <= 0:\n        print(\"Error: The complex dimension 'm' must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # The formula is (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2\n    # We will show the calculation step-by-step as requested.\n    \n    print(f\"--- Calculating for a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m = {m} ---\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Calculate m + 1\n    m_plus_1 = m + 1\n    print(f\"The first step in the numerator is m + 1: {m} + 1 = {m_plus_1}\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the full numerator m * (m + 1)\n    numerator = m * m_plus_1\n    print(f\"The full numerator is m * (m + 1): {m} * {m_plus_1} = {numerator}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the base of the exponent\n    base = numerator / 2\n    # Ensure the base is an integer for clarity in the printout\n    base_int = int(base)\n    print(f\"The base of the exponent is (m * (m + 1)) / 2: {numerator} / 2 = {base_int}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the final result by squaring the base\n    final_count = base_int ** 2\n    print(f\"The final number of independent components is the base squared: {base_int}^2 = {final_count}\")\n    print(\"-\" * (60))\n    \n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # The real dimension n of the manifold is 2*m.\n    \n    # Example 1: A Riemann surface (like a torus or a sphere).
