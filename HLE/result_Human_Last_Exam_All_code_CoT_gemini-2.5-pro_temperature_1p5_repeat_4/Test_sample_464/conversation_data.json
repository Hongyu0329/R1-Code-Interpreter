    "Yes, it follows that $f = 0$. Here is the reasoning, followed by a Python script that numerically illustrates the concept with a non-zero Schwartz function.\n\n### Mathematical Justification\n\nThe proof relies on the properties of the Fourier transform on the space of Schwartz functions.\n\n1.  **Fourier Transform:** Let $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ be the Fourier transform of $f(x)$, defined as $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx$. Since $f(x)$ is a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is also a Schwartz function.\n\n2.  **Derivatives of the Fourier Transform:** We can compute the derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ by differentiating under the integral sign. The $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is:\n    $$ \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} (e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi}) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} dx $$\n\n3.  **Using the Given Condition:** The problem states that all moments of $f(x)$ are zero, i.e., $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. If we evaluate the derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at $\\xi=0$, we get:\n    $$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\cdot 0 = 0 $$\n    This means that the Schwartz function $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ and all of its derivatives are zero at the origin.\n\n4.  **Key Property of Schwartz Functions:** A crucial theorem in analysis states that if a Schwartz function and all of its derivatives vanish at a single point, the function must be identically zero. Such a function is often called \"flat\" at that point, and this property means that no non-zero Schwartz function can be flat.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** From the property above, since $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k$, it must be that $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi$. The Fourier transform is invertible on the space of Schwartz functions, so if $\\hat{f} = 0$, then $f = 0$.\n\n### Numerical Illustration\n\nTo demonstrate this concept, let's take a well-known non-zero Schwartz function, the Gaussian function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$, and numerically compute its first few moments. Since this function is not the zero function, we expect that at least some of its moments will be non-zero. The following Python code calculates $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k e^{-x^2} dx$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, 10$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef demonstrate_moments():\n    \"\"\"\n    Numerically computes the moments of the Gaussian function f(x) = exp(-x^2).\n    A Schwartz function f(x) must be the zero function if all its moments are zero.\n    Since f(x) = exp(-x^2) is not the zero function, we expect to find non-zero moments.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define a non-zero Schwartz function (the Gaussian function)\n    f = lambda x: np.exp(-x**2)\n    \n    print(\"Calculating moments M_k = integral(x^k * f(x) dx) from -inf to inf for f(x) = exp(-x^2)\\n\")\n\n    max_k = 10\n    for k in range(max_k + 1):\n        # Define the integrand for the k-th moment\n        integrand = lambda x: (x**k) * f(x)\n        \n        # Perform the numerical integration\n        # quad returns a tuple (result, estimated_error)\n        moment, error = quad(integrand, -np.inf, np.inf)\n        \n        # The theoretical results are 0 for odd k, and non-zero for even k.\n        # Due to numerical precision, results for odd k will be very close to zero.\n        # We can round very small numbers to 0 for clarity.\n        if np.abs(moment) < 1e-9:\n            moment = 0.0\n            \n        print(f\"M_{k} = integral(x^{k} * exp(-x^2)) dx = {moment:.4f}\")\n\ndemonstrate_moments()\n```\n<<<Yes, it follows that $f = 0$.>>>"
