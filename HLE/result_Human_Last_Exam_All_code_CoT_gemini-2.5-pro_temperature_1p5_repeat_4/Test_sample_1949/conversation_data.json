    "To find the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid, we must first identify the rivers named in the epic poem and then find their real-world lengths to compare them.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Rivers:** I will compile a list of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid. These include major world rivers like the Nile, Danube (Ister), and Rhine, as well as rivers central to the plot like the Tiber.\n2.  **Gather Data:** I will find the approximate lengths of these real-world rivers in kilometers.\n3.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform the following:\n    *   Store the river names and their lengths in a dictionary.\n    *   Sort the rivers based on their length in descending order.\n    *   Select the top three from the sorted list.\n    *   Print the result in a clear, readable sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid\n    by sorting a predefined list of rivers and their lengths.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate lengths in kilometers.\n    # Sources for mentions include: Nile (Aen. 8), Danube/Ister (Georgics), Rhine (Aen. 8),\n    # Ganges (Aen. 8), Euphrates (Aen. 8), Tiber (frequently), Po/Eridanus (Aen. 6).\n    rivers = {\n        \"Nile\": 6650,\n        \"Danube\": 2850,\n        \"Euphrates\": 2800,\n        \"Ganges\": 2525,\n        \"Tigris\": 1900,\n        \"Rhine\": 1233,\n        \"Po (Eridanus)\": 652,\n        \"Tiber\": 406\n    }\n\n    # Sort the rivers by length in descending order\n    # sorted() returns a list of tuples (key, value)\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers\n    top_three = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    # Print the result\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {river}: approximately {length} km\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile (6650 km), the Danube (2850 km), and the Euphrates (2800 km).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
