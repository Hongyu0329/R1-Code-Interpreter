# The final answer is the sequence of commands to construct the square.
# The logic for deriving this sequence is as follows:
#
# Let P1 be the center of the initial circle and P2 be the point on its circumference.
#
# Step 1: L (Line)
# Draw a line through P1 and P2. This line forms the first diameter of the circle.
# This line intersects the circle at P2 and a new point on the opposite side, P3.
#
# Step 2: C (Circle)
# To find a second diameter perpendicular to the first, we construct its perpendicular bisector.
# Draw a circle with center P2 and a radius defined by the distance to P3.
#
# Step 3: C (Circle)
# Draw another circle with center P3 and a radius defined by the distance to P2.
#
# Step 4: L (Line)
# The two circles from steps 2 and 3 will intersect at two new points, P4 and P5.
# Draw a line connecting P4 and P5. This line is the perpendicular bisector
# of the first diameter and thus forms the second diameter of the circle.
#
# The four points where these two diameter lines intersect the original circle
# are the vertices of the inscribed square.
# The sequence of commands is LCCL.
