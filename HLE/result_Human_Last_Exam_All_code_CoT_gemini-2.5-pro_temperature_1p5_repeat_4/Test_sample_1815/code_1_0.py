# The problem asks for the number of group topologies on the integers that are
# both totally bounded and have no nontrivial convergent sequences.

# Step 1: Analyze the condition "no nontrivial convergent sequences".
# A sequence is nontrivial if it is not eventually constant.
# If a topological group has no nontrivial convergent sequences, its topology must be the discrete topology.
# This is because if the topology were not discrete, we could construct a sequence of non-zero elements that converges to 0.

# Step 2: Analyze the "totally bounded" condition for the discrete topology on the integers.
# A group G is totally bounded if for every open neighborhood U of the identity,
# G can be covered by a finite number of translates of U.
# For the group of integers Z, with the discrete topology, every subset is open.
# We can choose the open neighborhood U = {0}.
# To cover the infinite group Z with translates of {0}, we would need an infinite number of translates.
# A finite number of translates, say g_1+{0}, g_2+{0}, ..., g_n+{0}, only covers the finite set {g_1, g_2, ..., g_n}.
# Thus, the discrete topology on an infinite group like Z is not totally bounded.

# Step 3: Conclude.
# The two conditions are mutually exclusive for the group of integers.
# No such topology can exist.
# Therefore, the number of such topologies is 0.
