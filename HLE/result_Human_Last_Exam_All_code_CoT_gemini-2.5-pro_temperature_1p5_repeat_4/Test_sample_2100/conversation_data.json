    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this riddle, followed by the Python code.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the clues provided in the text to identify the historical figure.\n1.  **The Poet and Quote:** The quote \"a joy-discovering sailor\" is attributed to the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. I will identify the subject of the poem containing this line. This phrase is from his famous work which became the rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" and the subject is the Russian explorer and diplomat Nikolai Rezanov.\n2.  **The Mystery:** The line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" indicates that the person's burial site was lost or unknown for a significant period. Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk, and his grave was indeed lost after the original cemetery was destroyed.\n3.  **The Timeline:** The clue \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s\" aligns with the period when, fueled by the popularity of \"Juno and Avos,\" there was a renewed interest in Rezanov. A cenotaph (a memorial monument) was erected on the presumed site of his grave during this time, effectively \"answering\" the question for the public.\n\nBased on these steps, the man is Nikolai Rezanov. The code will represent these clues as variables and then print out a symbolic equation that combines them to reveal the last name.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by representing the clues as variables\n    and constructing a symbolic equation to find the answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clue 1: Quote from Andrei Voznesensky's work about a specific historical figure.\n    clue_1_subject = \"Nikolai Rezanov (as the 'joy-discovering sailor')\"\n    \n    # Clue 2: The mystery of his resting place.\n    clue_2_mystery = \"Lost grave after death in 1807\"\n    \n    # Clue 3: The rediscovery of the story and grave site.\n    clue_3_discovery = \"Grave site located in late 1980s\"\n\n    # The last name that satisfies all clues.\n    final_answer = \"Rezanov\"\n    \n    # The final output will be presented as a symbolic equation,\n    # as per the request, showing how each clue contributes to the final answer.\n    print(\"Logical Equation:\", end=\" \")\n    \n    # Print each part of the \"equation\" step-by-step\n    part1 = f\"Clue({clue_1_subject})\"\n    part2 = f\"Clue({clue_2_mystery})\"\n    part3 = f\"Clue({clue_3_discovery})\"\n    result = f\"Answer({final_answer})\"\n\n    sys.stdout.write(part1)\n    sys.stdout.write(\" + \")\n    sys.stdout.write(part2)\n    sys.stdout.write(\" + \")\n    sys.stdout.write(part3)\n    sys.stdout.write(\" = \")\n    sys.stdout.write(result)\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
