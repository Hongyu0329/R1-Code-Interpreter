    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Trace the Carbons**: First, I will trace the path of the labeled carbons (13C) from the initial glucose molecule through the steps of glycolysis.\n2.  **Glycolysis Split**: A glucose molecule (6 carbons) is split into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. I need to determine exactly where the initial labeled carbons (C1 and C4 of glucose) end up in the two resulting pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The top half of glucose (C1-C2-C3) becomes one pyruvate molecule. Due to the isomerization steps, the original C1 of glucose becomes the C3 (methyl group) of this pyruvate.\n    *   The bottom half of glucose (C4-C5-C6) becomes the second pyruvate molecule. The original C4 of glucose becomes the C1 (carboxyl group) of this pyruvate.\n3.  **CO2 Release**: Glycolysis itself does not release CO2. The first step that does is the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). This reaction specifically removes the C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate as a CO2 molecule.\n4.  **Count Labeled CO2**: By seeing which of the two pyruvate molecules has a label on its C1 carbon, I can determine how many labeled CO2 molecules are released.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that models this biochemical pathway, tracks the labeled carbons, and programmatically calculates the number of labeled CO2 molecules released. The script will print the logical steps and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_glycolysis_labeling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces 13C labels from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis and pyruvate\n    decarboxylation to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the initial molecule and its labels.\n    # Glucose has 6 carbons.
