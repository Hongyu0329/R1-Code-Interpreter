    "Here is the plan to determine the Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence:\n1.  First, I will identify the origin of the current word, \"sister\". This will confirm that it comes from Old Norse.\n2.  Next, I will find the original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for the same concept. This is the word that would have continued to be used.\n3.  Then, I will trace the likely linguistic evolution of this Old English word, following sound change patterns seen in other native words (like 'mother' from 'mōdor').\n4.  Finally, I will present the resulting word, which is the most probable form that would exist in Modern English today, and write a Python script to display this reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the hypothetical Modern English word for 'sister'\n    if the Norse influence had never occurred.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the etymology to find the hypothetical word for 'sister'...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the origin of the current word\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n    old_norse_origin = \"systir\"\n    print(f\"The current word, '{current_word}', is not native to Old English.\")\n    print(f\"It was borrowed from the Old Norse word '{old_norse_origin}' during the Viking Age (roughly 8th to 11th centuries).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the original Old English word\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    print(f\"The original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for sister was '{old_english_word}'.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Trace the linguistic evolution\n    print(\"Without the Norse influence, '{old_english_word}' would have evolved naturally.\")\n    print(\"Similar to how other Old English words changed:\")\n    print(\" - 'mōdor' became 'mother'\")\n    print(\" - 'brōþor' became 'brother'\")\n    print(f\"Following these patterns, the Old English '{old_english_word}' would have likely simplified.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Present the final predicted word\n    predicted_word = \"swester\"\n    print(f\"The word '{old_english_word}' would have evolved into the Middle English 'swester', and likely would have remained as such.\")\n    print(\"In fact, the word 'swester' existed in English for a time but was eventually outcompeted by the Norse version.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"Therefore, the hypothetical Modern English word would be:\")\n    print(f\"\\n>>> {predicted_word} <<<\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<swester>>>"
