    This function calculates the value of 'a' based on the given problem.
    It follows these steps:
    1.  Define the parametric equations for the astroid.
    2.  Calculate the arc length element ds = sqrt((dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2).
    3.  Determine the integration domain from the condition '0 <= x <= a'. For 0 < a < 1, this
        corresponds to two symmetric segments of the astroid.
    4.  Set up and evaluate the integral for the total arc length, which results in L(a) = 3 * a^(2/3).
    5.  Set this expression equal to the given length of 3/2 and solve for 'a'.
