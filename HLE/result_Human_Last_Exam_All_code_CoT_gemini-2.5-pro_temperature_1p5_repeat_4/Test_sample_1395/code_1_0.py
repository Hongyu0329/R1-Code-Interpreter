# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the Soviet dissolution.
# Before 1991, a 4-clique (four mutually bordering countries) existed: USSR, China, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.
# The size of the largest clique provides a lower bound for the chromatic number, so it must be at least 4.
# According to the Four Color Theorem, a planar graph's chromatic number is at most 4.
chromatic_number_before = 4

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after the dissolution.
# After 1991, the dissolution of the USSR created new countries.
# A new 4-clique was formed: China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.
# This means the chromatic number remained 4.
chromatic_number_after = 4

# Step 3: Calculate delta_soviet, the incremental change in the chromatic number.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The change in the chromatic number, delta_soviet, is {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}")

# Step 4: Determine beta based on the change in planarity.
# A graph of country borders on a map is inherently planar.
# This property did not change with the creation of new states.
# Since the planarity did not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The planarity of the Asian country graph did not change, so beta = {beta}")

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final calculation is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}")
