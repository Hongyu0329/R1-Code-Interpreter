    Computes the first l^2-Betti number of the fundamental group of the graph of groups X.

    1. Determine the topological properties of the underlying graph Gamma = L(P).
    2. Determine the l^2-Betti numbers of the vertex and edge groups.
    3. Apply the Dicks-Kropholler formula to compute the final result.
