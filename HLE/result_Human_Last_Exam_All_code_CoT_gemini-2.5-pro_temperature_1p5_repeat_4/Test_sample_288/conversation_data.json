    "To identify the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans*, I will analyze the synaptic wiring data. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Load the Connectome Data:** I will use the `c-elegans-wiring` Python library to access a standard adult hermaphrodite connectome dataset (N2U).\n2.  **Isolate ASJ Axonal Outputs:** I will filter this data to find all synaptic connections where the presynaptic neurons are ASJL and ASJR, which together form the ASJ pair.\n3.  **Aggregate Synapses by Target:** I will group these connections by their postsynaptic (target) neuron and sum the number of synapses for each target.\n4.  **Identify the Main Target:** I will then find the target neuron that receives the highest total number of synapses from both ASJL and ASJR.\n5.  **Present the Result:** Finally, I will display the result by showing the individual synapse counts from ASJL and ASJR to the main target neuron and their sum.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n# It may be necessary to install the library first:\n# pip install c-elegans-wiring\nfrom c_elegans_wiring.wiring_data import get_dataset\n\ndef find_main_asj_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main synaptic target of ASJ neurons in the adult C. elegans.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
