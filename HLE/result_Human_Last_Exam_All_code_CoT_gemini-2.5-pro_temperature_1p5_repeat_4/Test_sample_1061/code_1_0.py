    # Define the observation: a declining 13C ratio means the tree is incorporating
    # proportionally less 13C over time. This happens when the tree's discrimination
    # against 13C increases, typically due to reduced water stress.

    # -- Evaluation Equation Step 1: Analyze Factor B --
    print("\n1. Evaluating Factor 'B. Periods of drought':")
    print("   - Drought causes water stress, forcing the tree to close its stomata.")
    print("   - This limits the internal CO2 supply, reducing the tree's ability to discriminate against 13C.")
    print("   - Result: Drought leads to an INCREASE in the 13C ratio.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This contradicts the observed decline. This factor is incorrect.")

    # -- Evaluation Equation Step 2: Analyze Factors A, C, D --
    print("\n2. Evaluating Factors 'A. Tree maturity', 'C. Starch reserves', 'D. Wood proportion':")
    print("   - These are physiological or structural factors internal to the tree.")
    print("   - While they can influence the 13C ratio, they are generally considered secondary effects.")
    print("   - Conclusion: They are unlikely to be the predominant cause of a consistent, century-long trend across a region compared to a major climatic shift.")

    # -- Evaluation Equation Step 3: Analyze Factor E --
    print("\n3. Evaluating Factor 'E. Changes in the SE Asia monsoon':")
    print("   - The SE Asia monsoon is a major, large-scale climate driver in the region.")
    print("   - A long-term strengthening of the monsoon would lead to increased rainfall and humidity.")
    print("   - This reduces water stress on the trees, allowing them to keep stomata open and increase discrimination against 13C.")
    print("   - Result: A strengthening monsoon leads to a DECREASE in the 13C ratio.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This aligns perfectly with the observed decline and is a powerful, regional-scale explanation.")
