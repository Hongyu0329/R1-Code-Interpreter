    "Of course. The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic performance is not a single value but rather a range that depends on the specific synthesis method and reaction conditions. However, many studies converge on a ratio that maximizes the number of active Ni-Ceria interface sites while preventing the formation of large, less active nickel clusters.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  State a commonly cited optimal loading of Nickel in terms of weight percent (wt%) based on scientific literature. A value of around 8 wt% Ni on a CeO₂ support is often found to provide a good balance.\n2.  Write a Python script to convert this weight percent value into the more fundamental atomic (molar) ratio of Ni/Ce.\n3.  The script will use the molar masses of Nickel (Ni) and Cerium Oxide (CeO₂).\n4.  It will calculate the number of moles of Ni and Ce in a hypothetical 100g sample of the catalyst.\n5.  Finally, it will compute and print the Ni/Ce molar ratio, showing the numbers used in the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molar Ni/Ce ratio for a Ni-Ceria catalyst based on a given weight percentage.\n    \n    This function assumes the catalyst consists of Ni metal dispersed on a CeO2 (ceria) support.\n    A representative optimal loading of 8 wt% Ni is used for the calculation, as this value\n    is frequently cited in literature for balancing active sites and particle dispersion.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Constants: Molar masses in g/mol\n    molar_mass_ni = 58.69  # Molar mass of Nickel\n    molar_mass_ce = 140.12 # Molar mass of Cerium\n    molar_mass_o = 16.00  # Molar mass of Oxygen\n    molar_mass_ceo2 = molar_mass_ce + 2 * molar_mass_o\n\n    # Assumed optimal loading from literature\n    ni_weight_percent = 8.0\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the molar Ni/Ce ratio for a catalyst with {ni_weight_percent} wt% Ni on a CeO2 support.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Assume a 100g sample of the catalyst ---\n    total_mass = 100.0  # g\n    mass_ni = (ni_weight_percent / 100) * total_mass\n    mass_ceo2 = total_mass - mass_ni\n\n    print(f\"In a {total_mass}g sample:\")\n    print(f\"  - Mass of Ni = {mass_ni:.2f} g\")\n    print(f\"  - Mass of CeO2 = {mass_ceo2:.2f} g\")\n    \n    # --- Step 2: Calculate moles of Ni and Ce ---\n    # Moles of an element = mass / molar mass\n    moles_ni = mass_ni / molar_mass_ni\n    \n    # Moles of Ce is equal to the moles of CeO2\n    moles_ce = mass_ceo2 / molar_mass_ceo2\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculating moles using molar masses (Ni: {:.2f}, CeO2: {:.2f} g/mol):\".format(molar_mass_ni, molar_mass_ceo2))\n    print(f\"  - Moles of Ni = {mass_ni:.2f} g / {molar_mass_ni} g/mol = {moles_ni:.4f} moles\")\n    print(f\"  - Moles of Ce = {mass_ceo2:.2f} g / {molar_mass_ceo2:.2f} g/mol = {moles_ce:.4f} moles\")\n    \n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the final molar ratio ---\n    ni_ce_ratio = moles_ni / moles_ce\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"The final molar ratio (Ni/Ce) equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{moles_ni:.4f} moles Ni / {moles_ce:.4f} moles Ce = {ni_ce_ratio:.3f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"\\nThe ideal molar Ni/Ce ratio is approximately: {ni_ce_ratio:.3f}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_ni_ce_ratio()\n<<<0.255>>>"
