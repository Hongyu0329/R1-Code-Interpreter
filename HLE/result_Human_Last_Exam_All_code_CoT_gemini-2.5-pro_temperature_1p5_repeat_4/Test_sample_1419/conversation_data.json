    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation of the fixed point coupling, followed by a Python script to present the result.\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\n1.  **The Model and Dimensionality**: We consider the Euclidean $\\phi^4$ theory, which is a fundamental model in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. The goal is to study its critical behavior near its upper critical dimension, which is $d=4$. We use the dimensional regularization technique, working in $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ dimensions, where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive parameter.\n\n2.  **The Renormalization Group (RG) Beta Function**: The Renormalization Group (RG) describes how the parameters of a theory change as we change the length or momentum scale. The change in the dimensionless coupling constant, let's call it $u$, is described by the beta function, $\\beta(u)$. To leading order (one-loop approximation), the beta function for $\\phi^4$ theory is:\n    \n    $\\beta(u) = \\mu \\frac{du}{d\\mu} = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2}$\n    \n    Here:\n    *   The term $-\\epsilon u$ arises from the engineering dimension of the coupling constant $u$ in $4-\\epsilon$ dimensions.\n    *   The term $\\frac{3u^2}{16\\pi^2}$ is the one-loop quantum correction. The coefficient `3` comes from the combinatorics of the one-loop Feynman diagrams contributing to the 4-point vertex function.\n\n3.  **Finding the Fixed Point**: A fixed point, denoted as $u^*$, represents a scale-invariant point in the theory. At a fixed point, the coupling constant no longer changes with the scale, which means the beta function is zero:\n    \n    $\\beta(u^*) = 0$\n\n4.  **Solving for u***: We set the beta function to zero and solve for $u^*$:\n    \n    $-\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3(u^*)^2}{16\\pi^2} = 0$\n    \n    This equation can be factored as:\n    \n    $u^* \\left(-\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2}\\right) = 0$\n    \n    This gives two solutions:\n    *   $u^* = 0$: This is the **Gaussian fixed point**, corresponding to a free, non-interacting theory.\n    *   $-\\epsilon + \\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = 0$: This gives the non-trivial **Wilson-Fisher fixed point**.\n\n    Solving the second case for $u^*$ gives:\n    \n    $\\frac{3u^*}{16\\pi^2} = \\epsilon$\n    \n    $u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon$\n\nThis is the celebrated Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which controls the universal critical behavior of systems in the Ising universality class below four dimensions. The value is small for small $\\epsilon$, which justifies the use of perturbation theory in $\\epsilon$.\n\nHere is the Python code that prints this derivation and the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_fixed_point_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling (u*) in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Derivation of the Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point Coupling (u*) in phi^4 Theory:\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
