    "Of course. Here is my plan to address your question.\n\nFirst, I will explain the concept of the bare Green's function ($G_0$) in the context of many-body quantum mechanics. It describes the propagation of a single particle in a system without any particle-particle interactions.\n\nNext, I will present the mathematical form of the bare Green's function in frequency space, which is where its dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$) is most clearly expressed. The formula is derived from the Fourier transform of the time-ordered Green's function in a non-interacting system, which is a central part of the path integral formalism.\n\nFinally, I will provide a Python script that demonstrates this relationship. The script will:\n1.  Define a sample single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n2.  Define a sample Matsubara frequency $\\omega_n$, which is the appropriate frequency variable in the path integral formalism at finite temperature.\n3.  Calculate the value of the bare Green's function $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)$ using the standard formula.\n4.  Print out an explanation of the formula, showing the functional dependence, and then display the calculation with the specific numbers used, explicitly showing the final equation and its result.\n\nThis approach will directly answer your question by stating the functional dependence and illustrating it with a concrete, executable example.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\nimport numpy as np\n\n# In the Feynman path integral formalism at finite temperature, physical quantities\n# are often calculated in imaginary time and then transformed to Matsubara frequency space.\n\n# --- Parameters for our example ---\n\n# A single-particle energy eigenvalue (relative to the chemical potential).\n# This represents the energy of a quantum state 'k'.\nepsilon_k = 2.0\n\n# In the imaginary time formalism, we use Matsubara frequencies.\n# For fermions, these are given by omega_n = (2n+1) * pi / beta,\n# where n is an integer and beta is the inverse temperature (1/k_B T).\n# Let's choose the simplest case: n=0 and beta=1.0 for simplicity.\nn = 0\nbeta = 1.0\nomega_n = (2 * n + 1) * np.pi / beta\n\n# --- The Functional Dependence ---\n\n# The bare Green's function G_0(k, i*omega_n) in Matsubara frequency space\n# has a fundamental dependence on the single-particle energy epsilon_k.\n# The formula is: G_0 = 1 / (i*omega_n - epsilon_k)\n# This shows that G_0 is inversely proportional to the difference between\n# the complex frequency (i*omega_n) and the single-particle energy (epsilon_k).\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n\n# Calculate the complex frequency term\ni_omega_n = 1j * omega_n\n\n# Calculate the bare Green's function using the formula\nG0 = 1 / (i_omega_n - epsilon_k)\n\n# --- Output ---\n\nprint(\"The bare Green's function G_0 describes a non-interacting particle.\")\nprint(\"In frequency space, its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue epsilon_k is:\\n\")\nprint(\"G_0(k, i*omega_n) = 1 / (i*omega_n - epsilon_k)\\n\")\nprint(\"This shows G_0 is inversely proportional to the term (i*omega_n - epsilon_k).\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Example Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"Let's use a single-particle energy epsilon_k = {epsilon_k}\")\nprint(f\"And the lowest fermionic Matsubara frequency i*omega_n (for n=0, beta=1) = {i_omega_n:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation with these numbers is:\")\n# The following line explicitly prints the equation with the values, as requested.\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({i_omega_n:.4f} - {epsilon_k:.4f})\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe resulting bare Green's function is: G_0 = {G0:.4f}\")\n\n```\n<<<$1 / (i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k)$>>>"
