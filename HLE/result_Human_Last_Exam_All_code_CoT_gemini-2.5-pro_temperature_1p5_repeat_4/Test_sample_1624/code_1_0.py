    print("Step 1: Analyze the properties of the subset U.")
    print("The problem states that U is an open subset of X where each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the real line R.")
    print("This means U is a 1-dimensional topological manifold. Since U is an open subset of a metric space, U itself is a metrizable 1-manifold.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 2: Deduce properties of U from it being a metrizable manifold.")
    print("A fundamental theorem in topology states that every metrizable manifold is second-countable (has a countable base for its topology).")
    print("A second-countable space is also separable, meaning it contains a countable dense subset. Let's call this subset D.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 3: Relate the properties of U back to the entire space X.")
    print("We are given that U is dense in X. The set D is dense in U. A set that is dense in a dense subset is dense in the whole space.")
    print("Therefore, D is a countable dense subset of X, which means X is a separable metric space.")
    print("-" * 20)

    print("Step 4: Determine the cardinality of a separable metric space.")
    print("A separable metric space is always second-countable. Let B be a countable base for the topology of X.")
    print("For any second-countable Hausdorff space (which a metric space is), we can establish an upper bound on its cardinality.")
    print("We can map each point x in X to a unique subset of the countable base B (the subset of all elements in B containing x).")
    print("This defines a one-to-one function from X into the power set of B.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    print("Conclusion: The Upper Bound")
    print("The cardinality of X must be less than or equal to the cardinality of the power set of the countable base B.")
    print("The cardinality of a countable set is denoted as Aleph_0.")
    print("The cardinality of the power set is 2 raised to the power of the cardinality of the original set.")
    print("\nTherefore, we have the following relationship for the cardinality of X, denoted |X|:")
    
    # Representing the final equation
    print("The final inequality is: |X| <= 2^Aleph_0")
    print("Breaking down the numbers in the final equation:")
    print("The number is: 2")
    print("The exponent represents Aleph_0, the cardinality of the natural numbers.")
    print("\nThis upper bound, 2^Aleph_0, is the cardinality of the continuum (c), which is the cardinality of the set of all real numbers.")
