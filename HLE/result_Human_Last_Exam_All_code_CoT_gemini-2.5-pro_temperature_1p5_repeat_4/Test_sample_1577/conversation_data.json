    "To determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a surface, we need to understand how the topology of the surface affects the number of independent logical operators.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Base Surface**: The problem describes a surface with holes but doesn't specify the genus. The standard assumption in such problems is a sphere, which has genus `g=0`.\n2.  **Understand Holes and Boundaries**: The toric code Hamiltonian is modified at the boundaries (edges of the holes).\n    *   **Smooth (or electric) boundaries**: The lattice terminates with star operators. Plaquette operators at the boundary are removed from the Hamiltonian.\n    *   **Rough (or magnetic) boundaries**: The lattice terminates with plaquette operators. Star operators at the boundary are removed.\n3.  **Count Logical Qubits**: The GSD is `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits. A logical qubit consists of a pair of operators, `X_L` and `Z_L`, that commute with the Hamiltonian and all other logical qubit operators, but anticommute with each other (`X_L Z_L = -Z_L X_L`).\n4.  **Construct Logical Operators**: We can construct logical operators based on the types of boundaries.\n    *   For a set of `n` smooth holes (and `m>=1` rough holes), we can construct `n-1` independent \"smooth-type\" logical qubits.\n    *   For a set of `m` rough holes (and `n>=1` smooth holes), we can construct `m-1` independent \"rough-type\" logical qubits.\n5.  **Calculate Total Qubits**: The \"smooth\" qubits and \"rough\" qubits are independent and commute with each other. Thus, the total number of logical qubits `k` is the sum of the qubits from each type.\n    *   Number of smooth qubits: `n-1` (This requires `n > 1`).\n    *   Number of rough qubits: `m-1` (This requires `m > 1`).\n    *   Total qubits `k = (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2`. This formula is generally cited for the case where both `n` and `m` are greater than zero. While it has known issues with edge cases (like `n=1` or `m=0`), it's the most direct formula corresponding to one of the multiple-choice options.\n6.  **Determine GSD**: With `k = n+m-2` logical qubits, the GSD is `2^(n+m-2)`.\n7.  **Python Code**: Create a Python script that takes symbolic `n` and `m` and prints the final formula for the GSD.\n\n```python\ndef solve_degeneracy():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the ground space degeneracy\n    of the toric code with n smooth and m rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of smooth holes (symbolic)\n    n = \"n\"\n    # Number of rough holes (symbolic)\n    m = \"m\"\n\n    # The number of logical qubits 'k' can be derived from the topology of the surface.\n    # For a sphere (genus 0) with n smooth holes and m rough holes, the number of\n    # independent logical qubits is given by k = (n-1) + (m-1) = n + m - 2.\n    # This formula assumes n>=1 and m>=1.\n\n    # The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is 2^k.\n    print(\"The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is given by the formula 2^k, where k is the number of logical qubits.\")\n    print(\"For n smooth holes and m rough holes on a sphere:\")\n    print(\"k = (n - 1) + (m - 1)\")\n    print(f\"k = {n} + {m} - 2\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the GSD is:\")\n    # We use string formatting to display the final equation symbolically.\n    # The final print statement is designed to clearly show each part of the exponent.\n    final_equation = f\"2^({n} + {m} - 2)\"\n    print(final_equation)\n\nsolve_degeneracy()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
