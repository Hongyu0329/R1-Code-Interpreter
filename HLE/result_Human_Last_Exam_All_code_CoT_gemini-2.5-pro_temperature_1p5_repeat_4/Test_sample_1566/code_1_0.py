# The problem is to determine the number of topologically distinct continua
# that have more than one but finitely many end points, and exactly two
# orbits under the action of their auto-homeomorphism group.

# Our step-by-step analysis concluded that these properties uniquely
# define the topological type of the continuum to be an arc (i.e., any
# space homeomorphic to a closed interval [0,1]).

# Let N be the number of topologically distinct continua satisfying the properties.
# Since only one such type exists, N is 1.

number_of_continua = 1

# The problem asks us to present the result.
# The final equation is:
# Number of topologically distinct continua = 1
