    "My plan is to solve this problem by systematically enumerating and classifying the minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Define a minimal grid diagram:** The trefoil knot has a minimal grid number of 3. A 3x3 grid diagram can be represented by a pair of permutations of `{1, 2, 3}`, let's call them `O` and `X`. `O(i)` is the column of the 'O' mark in row `i`, and `X(i)` is the column of the 'X' mark.\n2.  **Identify left-hand trefoil diagrams:** For a pair `(O, X)` to represent a single-component knot, the permutation `pi = O_inv * X` must be a 3-cycle. There are two 3-cycles in the group of permutations of 3 elements (`S_3`). One corresponds to the left-hand trefoil, and the other to the right-hand trefoil. We will fix the left-hand trefoil's cycle, which we can determine to be `c1 = (2, 3, 1)`. Therefore, any diagram for the left-hand trefoil must satisfy `X = O * c1`.\n3.  **Enumerate all diagrams:** By letting `O` be each of the `3! = 6` permutations in `S_3`, we can generate all 6 minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil.\n4.  **Classify by translation:** \"Translation\" means cyclically shifting the rows or columns of the grid. We will group the 6 diagrams into equivalence classes (orbits) under these translations. We expect to find that the 6 diagrams fall into 2 distinct orbits of 3 diagrams each.\n5.  **Classify by rotation/reflection:** The full symmetry group of the grid also includes rotations and reflections (the Dihedral group `D_4`). We will show that applying a reflection operation to a diagram in one translation orbit maps it to a diagram in the other orbit.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the two translation orbits are connected by a reflection, all 6 diagrams belong to a single equivalence class under the full group of translations and rotations. Therefore, there is only one unique diagram.\n\nThe following Python code implements this step-by-step process.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef perm_to_str(p):\n    \"\"\"Converts a 1-indexed permutation tuple to a string.\"\"\"\n    return f\"({p[0]},{p[1]},{p[2]})\"\n\ndef perm_mult(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes permutation multiplication p1 * p2 (p2 is applied first).\n    Permutations are 1-indexed tuples. For example, in a 3x3 grid,\n    p=(2,3,1) means 1->2, 2->3, 3->1.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(p1)\n    res = [0] * n\n    # For each element i from 1 to n:\n    # 1. Find where p2 sends it: p2[i-1]\n    # 2. Find where p1 sends that result: p1[p2[i-1] - 1]\n    for i in range(n):\n        res[i] = p1[p2[i]-1]\n    return tuple(res)\n\ndef perm_inv(p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the inverse of a permutation.\n    If p sends i to p[i-1], the inverse sends p[i-1] back to i.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    res = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        res[p[i]-1] = i + 1\n    return tuple(res)\n\n# Step 1: Set up the permutations for a 3x3 grid\nS3 = sorted(list(itertools.permutations([1, 2, 3])))\n\n# Step 2: Define the cycle for the left-hand trefoil\n# The knot type is determined by O_inv * X.
