    # Analysis of Choice A
    print("Analyzing Choice A: 'Computers comp few urns'")
    print("- Phonetic Match: Poor. 'comp few urns' does not sound like 'computer'.")
    print("- Semantic Match: Poor. The meaning has no relation to the description.\n")

    # Analysis of Choice B
    print("Analyzing Choice B: 'Computer: \"Come poo, tern!\"'")
    print("- Phonetic Match: Excellent. The phrase 'Come poo, tern' is a strong phonetic repetition of the syllables in 'com-pu-ter'.")
    print("- Semantic Match: Excellent. The phrase is a direct command from the software (Computer) to a bird ('tern') telling it where to 'poo'. This perfectly fits the description.\n")

    # Analysis of Choice C
    print("Analyzing Choice C: 'Computer: \"Come, pee you turkey!\"'")
    print("- Phonetic Match: Poor. The syllable pattern and count ('Come, pee-you tur-key') does not match 'com-pu-ter'.")
    print("- Semantic Match: Fair. The theme is correct, but the phonetic structure is wrong, and 'tern' is a better phonetic match for 'ter' than 'turkey'.\n")

    # Analysis of Choice D
    print("Analyzing Choice D: 'Comb pewter computer'")
    print("- Phonetic Match: Excellent. 'Comb pewter' sounds almost identical to 'computer'.")
    print("- Semantic Match: None. The meaning ('to search through pewter items') is completely unrelated to the description about software and birds.\n")

    # Analysis of Choice E
    print("Analyzing Choice E: 'Computer needs bird relieves'")
    print("- Phonetic Match: None. This is not a pun and does not repeat syllables.")
    print("- Semantic Match: Poor. It's a literal (and grammatically awkward) statement, not a punny avalanche.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Choice B is the only option that satisfies both key requirements of the puzzle.")
    print("It has a strong phonetic resemblance to 'computer' AND its meaning perfectly aligns with the given description.")
