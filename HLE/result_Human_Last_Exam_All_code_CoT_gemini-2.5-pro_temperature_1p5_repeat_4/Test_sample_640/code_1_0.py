def solve_scattering_problem():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the correct statements about two-channel quantum scattering.

    Based on the principles of quantum scattering theory:
    - The property of being "nontrivially coupled" is equivalent for the potential V(r), 
      the Jost matrix F(E), and the scattering matrix S(E).
    - The property of being "diagonal" is also equivalent across V(r), F(E), and S(E).

    Analysis of the statements:
    1. Correct: Follows from the equivalence of nontrivial coupling between S(E) and V(r).
    2. Correct: A standard result from inverse scattering theory.
    3. Correct: Follows from the equivalence of nontrivial coupling between V(r) and F(E).
    4. Correct: Follows from the equivalence of nontrivial coupling between F(E) and S(E).
    5. Incorrect: A diagonal F(E) implies a diagonal V(r), which is not nontrivially coupled.
