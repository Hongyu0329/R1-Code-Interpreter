    "The user is asking for the specific name of the value measured between heartbeats, which is used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the standard technical term for the time interval between consecutive heartbeats.\n2.  Create a Python script that defines this term and its common alternative.\n3.  Use the `print()` function within the script to output the answer in a descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\n# This script answers the user's question about the name of the value\n# measured between heartbeats for HRV calculations.\n\n# The time measured between consecutive heartbeats is the fundamental data point for HRV.\n# While the user mentions PPG, the terminology is often borrowed from the gold-standard ECG (Electrocardiogram).\n# In an ECG reading, the most prominent spike is the \"R-wave\".\n# The time from one R-wave to the next is the standard measurement.\nmain_term = \"R-R interval\"\n\n# Another common, more general term is the Inter-beat Interval.\nalternative_term = \"Inter-beat interval (IBI)\"\n\nprint(f\"The value between heartbeats used to compute HRV is called the '{main_term}' or the '{alternative_term}'.\")\n\n```\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
