def solve_riddle():
    """
    This function solves the riddle based on the provided clues.

    The clues point to the author of the Ten Commandments.
    1.  The "prohibition against representation" refers to the Second Commandment.
    2.  The "issue of another's material possessions" refers to the Tenth Commandment.
    3.  Veronika Campan's interpretation suggests that the author, by listing items
        one should not covet (house, ox, etc.), is verbally "representing" them,
        thus ignoring the earlier prohibition.
    4.  The figure traditionally credited with receiving and writing the
        Ten Commandments is Moses.
