    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I will break down the provided text to identify the key elements.\n    *   \"Veronika Campan's interpretation\": This points to a specific scholarly work that I need to identify.\n    *   \"HIS work\": This refers to a significant, well-known text or body of law.\n    *   \"another's material possessions\": This strongly suggests a law or commandment against coveting or theft, likely the Tenth Commandment.\n    *   \"ignoring the prohibition against representation\": This is a critical clue, pointing to the Second Commandment, which forbids making graven images or representations of things.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the Clues:** The interpretation suggests that by listing the specific material possessions in the commandment against coveting (e.g., house, ox, donkey), the author of the text is verbally \"representing\" them. This act of representation is seen as \"naturally ignoring\" the earlier, stricter prohibition against making any representations.\n\n3.  **Identify the Figure:** The work containing the prohibitions against representation and coveting is the Ten Commandments. The historical and religious figure traditionally credited with receiving these commandments from God on Mount Sinai and delivering them to the people is Moses.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Code:** I will write a simple Python script that stores the name \"Moses\" in a variable and then prints it to the console, fulfilling the user's request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle based on the provided clues.\n\n    The clues point to the author of the Ten Commandments.\n    1.  The \"prohibition against representation\" refers to the Second Commandment.\n    2.  The \"issue of another's material possessions\" refers to the Tenth Commandment.\n    3.  Veronika Campan's interpretation suggests that the author, by listing items\n        one should not covet (house, ox, etc.), is verbally \"representing\" them,\n        thus ignoring the earlier prohibition.\n    4.  The figure traditionally credited with receiving and writing the\n        Ten Commandments is Moses.\n    \"\"\"\n    his_full_name = \"Moses\"\n    print(his_full_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Moses>>>"
