    "To answer this question, I will need to find the relevant scientific information from paleontological studies of *Irritator challengeri*. The primary source for the cranial anatomy of this dinosaur is the 2002 paper \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Recall the information from that specific scientific paper regarding the skull anatomy.\n2.  Focus on the description of the lacrimal bone and the lacrimal recess.\n3.  The paper states that the lacrimal recess is subdivided into two smaller depressions (a larger dorsal one and a smaller ventral one).\n4.  I will write a Python script that assigns these findings to variables and prints the total, including the simple equation that leads to the result.\n\n```python\n# The scientific paper describing the skull of Irritator challengeri\n# (Sues et al., 2002) notes that the lacrimal recess is subdivided.\n\n# Number of larger, dorsal depressions in the lacrimal recess.\ndorsal_depression = 1\n\n# Number of smaller, ventral depressions in the lacrimal recess.\nventral_depression = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of depressions.\ntotal_depressions = dorsal_depression + ventral_depression\n\nprint(\"Based on the description of the Irritator challengeri skull, the lacrimal recess contains a specific number of depressions.\")\nprint(f\"The total is the sum of a dorsal depression and a ventral depression: {dorsal_depression} + {ventral_depression} = {total_depressions}\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {total_depressions} depressions.\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
