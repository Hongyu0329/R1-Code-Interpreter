    print("\nAnalyzing Reason (5): Avoiding Revealing Your Hand")
    print("Similarly, this is about information control. You hide your hand to prevent an opponent from exploiting you later. A GTO opponent cannot exploit you based on seeing one of your hands at showdown. They already know your entire strategy (e.g., your bluffing frequencies) and are playing the perfect counter-strategy. Seeing one specific hand doesn't change their GTO approach.")
