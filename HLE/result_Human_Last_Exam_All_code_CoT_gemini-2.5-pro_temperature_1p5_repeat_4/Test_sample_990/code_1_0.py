# Step 1: Define the given values.
# The height H is given as 350g meters. We represent this as a coefficient and the variable 'g'.
H_coefficient = 350

# Step 2: State the derived constant acceleration.
# From the physical analysis, the acceleration 'a' is a constant fraction of 'g'.
# a = g / 7
a_denominator = 7

# Step 3: Set up the kinematic equation H = (1/2) * a * t^2.
# We need to solve for t.
# t^2 = 2 * H / a
# Substituting H = 350g and a = g/7:
# t^2 = 2 * (350 * g) / (g / 7)
# The 'g' terms cancel out.
# t^2 = 2 * 350 * 7

# Step 4: Calculate the value of t^2 and then t.
t_squared_val1 = 2
t_squared_val2 = H_coefficient
t_squared_val3 = a_denominator

t_squared = t_squared_val1 * t_squared_val2 * t_squared_val3
t = math.sqrt(t_squared)

# Step 5: Print the results clearly, showing the calculation.
