    "I will approach this problem by analyzing the tail end of the sequence to find a simple arithmetic relationship, as suggested by the hint to provide a \"final equation.\" The sequence appears erratic, which suggests a complex underlying rule is less likely than a simple, local rule for determining the *next* number.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Assume the next number is generated by a simple arithmetic operation on the last two numbers of the sequence.\n2.  The most common operations are addition and subtraction. I will test the subtraction hypothesis: `next_number = last_number - second_to_last_number`.\n3.  I will identify the last two numbers from the provided sequence.\n4.  I will then write a Python script to perform this calculation and print out each number in the equation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the next number in the sequence based on the hypothesis\n    that it is the difference between the last two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124]\n\n    # The last two numbers in the sequence\n    last_number = sequence[-1]\n    second_to_last_number = sequence[-2]\n\n    # The proposed equation is to find the difference\n    next_number = last_number - second_to_last_number\n\n    # Print out each number in the final equation, as requested\n    print(f\"{last_number} - {second_to_last_number} = {next_number}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<88>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the next number in the sequence:\n\n111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
