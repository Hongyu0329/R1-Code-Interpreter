def solve_geology_quiz():
    """
    Solves the geology consensus/debated quiz.

    The function analyzes 10 statements about North American Cordilleran geology
    and determines if each is a consensus view (C) or a debated topic (D).

    The analysis for each statement is as follows:
    1. Morrison formation as a foredeep deposit: Consensus (C)
    2. Metamorphic core complexes from a slab window: Debated (D)
    3. "Nevadaplano" existence by end-Cretaceous: Debated (D)
    4. "Arizonaplano" from magmatic thickening: Debated (D)
    5. Laramide structures are inboard of Sevier structures: Consensus (C)
    6. Sierra Nevada/Idaho batholiths from Cordilleran arc: Consensus (C)
    7. Eocene ignimbrite propagation to the southwest: Consensus (C)
    8. Colorado Plateau elevation history: Debated (D)
    9. Cascades arc elevation history: Debated (D)
    10. Laramide deformation caused by Shatsky conjugate: Debated (D)

    The final answer is a concatenated string of these determinations.
