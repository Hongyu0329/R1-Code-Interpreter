    "My plan is to solve this organic chemistry problem by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, and the reagent is potassium tert-butoxide. This combination of a secondary alkyl halide and a strong, bulky base indicates an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry**: The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Bromine) and the beta-hydrogen to be eliminated must be in an *anti-periplanar* (or trans-diaxial in a cyclohexane ring) conformation.\n\n3.  **Draw Chair Conformations**: For the reaction to occur, the substrate molecule must adopt a chair conformation where the bromine atom is in an axial position.\n    *   (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane. This means it can exist in two chair conformations: one where both substituents (Br and methyl) are equatorial, and another where they are both axial.\n    *   The E2 reaction can only proceed from the less stable diaxial conformation, as this places the Br in the required axial position.\n\n4.  **Identify Available Beta-Hydrogens**: In the reactive (diaxial) conformer, we will look at the hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to the one bearing the bromine (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2**: The methyl group is axial, which means the hydrogen on C2 is equatorial. This hydrogen is *not* anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, elimination to form 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product) is not possible.\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two hydrogens, one of which is axial. This axial hydrogen *is* anti-periplanar to the axial bromine.\n\n5.  **Determine the Product**: Since elimination is only possible by removing the axial hydrogen from C6, the double bond will form between C1 and C6. The methyl group on C2 is unaffected. The resulting product is the less substituted alkene (the Hofmann product) due to stereochemical constraints. The name of this product is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\nI will now generate the Python code that outlines this reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide\n    and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define reactants and conditions\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"Potassium tert-butoxide (a strong, bulky base)\"\n    reaction_type = \"E2 Elimination\"\n\n    # Step-by-step analysis\n    print(f\"Analyzing the reaction for: {substrate}\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(\"-\" * 50, file=sys.stdout)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify Reaction Type\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(f\"The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide treated with a strong, bulky base ({reagent}).\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(f\"This strongly favors an {reaction_type} reaction.\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(\"-\" * 50, file=sys.stdout)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Recall the Stereochemical Requirement for E2\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(\"The E2 mechanism requires the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen (H on an adjacent carbon) to be anti-periplanar.\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(\"In a cyclohexane ring, this means they must be in a trans-diaxial arrangement (both axial, one pointing up, one pointing down).\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(\"-\" * 50, file=sys.stdout)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyze the Substrate's Conformation\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(f\"The substrate, {substrate}, has a trans relationship between the Br and the methyl group.\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(\"For the E2 reaction to occur, the molecule must be in the chair conformation where the leaving group (Br) is axial.\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(\"In this trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, if Br is axial, the methyl group on C2 must also be axial.\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(\"-\" * 50, file=sys.stdout)\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Check for Available Anti-Periplanar Beta-Hydrogens\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(\"In the reactive (diaxial) conformation:\", file=sys.stdout)\n    print(\"  - At Carbon 2: The methyl group is axial, so the H on C2 is equatorial.
