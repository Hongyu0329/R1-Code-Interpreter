    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence to find the pattern and the next number.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the relationship between consecutive numbers.**\nLet the sequence be denoted by `a_n`. The given sequence is `a_1=2, a_2=11, a_3=23, a_4=51, a_5=119`. Let's test a pattern of the form `a_n = 3 * a_{n-1} +/- k`.\n\n*   `a_2` from `a_1`: `11 = 3 * 2 + 5`. So, we add 5.\n*   `a_3` from `a_2`: `23 = 3 * 11 - 10`. So, we subtract 10.\n*   `a_4` from `a_3`: `51 = 3 * 23 - 18`. `(3*23=69, 69-18=51)`. So, we subtract 18.\n*   `a_5` from `a_4`: `119 = 3 * 51 - 34`. `(3*51=153, 153-34=119)`. So, we subtract 34.\n\nThe pattern for the main sequence is:\n`a_2 = 3*a_1 + 5`\n`a_n = 3*a_{n-1} - k_{n-1}` for `n >= 3`.\nThe sequence of numbers we subtract, let's call it `k`, is `{10, 18, 34, ...}`.\n\n**Step 2: Find the pattern within the secondary sequence `k`.**\nThe sequence `k` starts at the third term of the main sequence, so let's call its elements `k_3, k_4, k_5`.\n*   `k_3 = 10`\n*   `k_4 = 18`\n*   `k_5 = 34`\n\nLet's find the relationship between these terms.\n*   `18 = 2 * 10 - 2`.\n*   `34 = 2 * 18 - 2`.\n\nThe pattern for `k` is `k_n = 2 * k_{n-1} - 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the next term in the `k` sequence.**\nUsing the pattern found, we can calculate the next term, `k_6`.\n*   `k_6 = 2 * k_5 - 2 = 2 * 34 - 2 = 68 - 2 = 66`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the next term in the main sequence `a`.**\nNow we can find the missing number, `a_6`, using the pattern `a_n = 3*a_{n-1} - k_{n-1}`.\n*   `a_6 = 3 * a_5 - k_6 = 3 * 119 - 66`.\n*   `a_6 = 357 - 66 = 291`.\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle.\n    The sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ...\n    \"\"\"\n    a = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    \n    # The pattern is a_n = 3*a_{n-1} - k_{n-1} for n>2\n    # The sequence k follows its own pattern: k_n = 2*k_{n-1} - 2\n    # Let's define the initial k values derived from the main sequence\n    # k_3 = (3*a_2) - a_3 = 3*11 - 23 = 10\n    # k_4 = (3*a_3) - a_4 = 3*23 - 51 = 18\n    # k_5 = (3*a_4) - a_5 = 3*51 - 119 = 34\n    \n    k = [10, 18, 34] # k values corresponding to a_3, a_4, a_5\n    \n    # Calculate the next k value\n    next_k = 2 * k[-1] - 2\n    \n    # Calculate the next a value\n    next_a = 3 * a[-1] - next_k\n    \n    # We still need to output the original numbers in the final equation.\n    # The final equation is a_6 = 3 * a_5 - k_6\n    print(f\"The pattern is a_n = 3 * a_{{n-1}} - k_n, where k_n = 2 * k_{{n-1}} - 2.\")\n    print(f\"The last number in the sequence is a_5 = {a[-1]}.\")\n    print(f\"The last subtraction amount is k_5 = {k[-1]}.\")\n    print(f\"The next subtraction amount is k_6 = 2 * {k[-1]} - 2 = {next_k}.\")\n    print(f\"The next number in the sequence is a_6 = 3 * {a[-1]} - {next_k} = {next_a}.\")\n    \nsolve_sequence()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
