    print("(a) True or false: The energy J_t becomes unbounded from below as t -> +infinity if p > 2(1 + 3s) / (1 + s).")
    print("\nReasoning:")
    print("To analyze the behavior of the functional J as t -> +infinity, we apply the scaling transformation to a function (u, v).")
    print("Let u_t(x, y) = t^((1+s)/2) * u(t^s * x, t * y). We analyze J(u_t, v_t).")
    print("Let's assume the norm is the standard H^1 norm, i.e., ||w||_{H^{1,s}}^2 = ||w||_{H^1}^2 = integral(|grad(w)|^2 + w^2) dxdy.")
    print("The kinetic energy term scales as: ||u_t||_{H^1}^2 = t^{2s}*||\u2202_x u||_{L^2}^2 + t^2*||\u2202_y u||_{L^2}^2 + ||u||_{L^2}^2.")
    print("For any non-trivial u, this term grows like t^max(2, 2s) for large t.")
    print("The L^p norm term scales as: ||u_t||_{L^p}^p = t^((p-2)(s+1)/2) * ||u||_{L^p}^p.")
    print("For the energy to be unbounded below (go to -infinity), the exponent of t in the negative L^p term must be greater than the exponent in the positive kinetic energy term.")
    print("So, we need: (p-2)(s+1)/2 > max(2, 2s).")
    
    print("\nCase 1: s >= 1. Then max(2, 2s) = 2s.")
    print("The condition is (p-2)(s+1)/2 > 2s, which simplifies to p > 2(1+3s)/(1+s).")

    print("The statement in the question gives p > 2(1+3s)/(1+s).")
    print("For s < 1, we have 2(s+3)/(s+1) > 2(1+3s)/(1+s). So the condition in the question is not sufficient.")

    # --- Question (b) ---
    print("--------------------------------------------------")
    print("(b) Given J_t(u, v) has a mountain pass geometry, does the existence of a critical point imply the existence of a positive ground state solution?")
    print("\nReasoning:")
    print("A 'mountain pass geometry' allows the use of the Mountain Pass Theorem to prove the existence of *a* critical point, which is a solution to the corresponding Euler-Langevin equations.")
    print("A 'positive ground state solution' is a solution (u,v) where u>0 and v>0 everywhere, and which minimizes the energy J among all non-trivial solutions.")
    print("The existence of a critical point does not necessarily imply the existence of a positive ground state for two main reasons:")
    print("1. The critical point found via the mountain pass method might not be a ground state. It is a saddle point, and there could be other solutions with lower energy.")
    print("2. The system can admit 'semi-trivial' solutions of the form (u, 0) or (0, v). A mountain pass argument on the full (u,v) space might find one of these semi-trivial solutions, especially if the coupling constant beta is small. A semi-trivial solution is not a 'positive ground state solution' in the sense that both components are positive.")
    print("Therefore, the answer is No.\n")
    
    # --- Question (c) ---
    print("--------------------------------------------------")
    print("(c) If r_1 + r_2 lies in the range (2, 2s), does the minimisation of J_t over P(a,b) yield a unique solution?")
    print("\nReasoning:")
    print("P(a,b) likely refers to the set S(a,b) = { (u,v) | ||u||_{L^2}^2 = a, ||v||_{L^2}^2 = b }, where one minimizes the functional J under a fixed L^2-norm constraint.")
    print("Uniqueness of solutions in variational problems is a very strong property and is often not true.")
    print("For this problem, set in R^2, there is translation invariance. If (u(x,y), v(x,y)) is a solution, then for any (x_0, y_0) in R^2, the translated function (u(x-x_0, y-y_0), v(x-x_0, y-y_0)) is also a solution with the same energy and norms. Since these translated functions are different, there are infinitely many solutions.")
    print("Even if 'uniqueness' is considered up to such geometric symmetries, it is still not guaranteed. Systems of equations can have multiple distinct solutions due to bifurcation phenomena or symmetry breaking.")
    print("The condition r_1 + r_2 in (2, 2s) is likely a condition to ensure the minimization problem is well-posed (i.e., the infimum is finite and achieved), but it is generally not sufficient to guarantee uniqueness.")
    print("Therefore, the answer is No.\n")
