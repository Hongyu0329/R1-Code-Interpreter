# The problem asks for the 50th segmented number.
# A segmented number is a positive integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of
# two or more consecutive smaller positive integers.

# Step 1: Analyze the property of non-segmented numbers.
# A number 'n' is NOT segmented if it can be written as:
# n = a + (a+1) + ... + (a+k-1)
# where 'a' is the starting positive integer (a >= 1) and 'k' is the number of terms (k >= 2).
# This is an arithmetic series with sum n = k/2 * (2*a + k - 1).

# Step 2: Determine which numbers have this property.
# Rearranging the formula gives 2n = k * (2a + k - 1).
# This equation can be solved for integers a>=1 and k>=2 if and only if 'n'
# is NOT a power of 2.
# Therefore, the numbers that CANNOT be expressed this way (the segmented numbers)
# must be the powers of 2.

# Step 3: Identify the sequence of segmented numbers.
# The sequence is 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, ...
# This gives the sequence: 1, 2, 4, 8, ...
# The problem statement confirms this: "The first element is 1 and the second element is 2."

# Step 4: Find the formula for the Nth element.
# The 1st element is 2^(1-1) = 2^0 = 1.
# The 2nd element is 2^(2-1) = 2^1 = 2.
# The Nth element is 2^(N-1).

# Step 5: Calculate the 50th element.
# We need to find the 50th element, so we set N = 50.
# The value is 2^(50-1) = 2^49.

# Python code to compute and print the result.
n = 50
base = 2
exponent = n - 1
result = base ** exponent

# The final equation is result = base^exponent.
# We print all numbers from this equation: the base, the exponent, and the result.
print(f"The {n}th segmented number is the result of the equation: {base}^{exponent}")
print(f"The final number is: {result}")
