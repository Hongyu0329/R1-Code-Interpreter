# According to the EKR theorem for cross-intersecting multiset families,
# the maximal sum |F| + |G| is achieved when F and G are both the family
# of all k-multisets containing a single fixed element.

# The size of such a family is the number of ways to choose the remaining k-1 elements
# from the m elements with repetition allowed. The formula for this is C(n+r-1, r)
# where n=m and r=k-1.
