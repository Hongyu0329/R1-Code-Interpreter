    This script provides the solution to the set theory problem by constructing
    and printing the final answer.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The problem asks for the order type of X, the set of possible
       cofinalities for 2^omega, given certain conditions.
    2. Analysis shows X is the set of all uncountable regular cardinals
       less than aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.
    3. In ZFC, uncountable regular cardinals are successor cardinals (aleph_{alpha+1}).
    4. Thus, X is the set of successor cardinals less than aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}.
    5. The order type of this set is the same as the order type of its
       indices: the set of successor ordinals less than omega_{omega+5}.
    6. For any infinite limit ordinal lambda, the set of successors less than
       lambda has order type lambda.
    7. Since omega_{omega+5} is a limit ordinal, the resulting order type is
       omega_{omega+5}.

    The code below constructs the string representation of this ordinal answer
    and prints it as the final equation.
    """

    # The problem involves the number 2 and 5, and the ordinal omega.
    # The final answer is an ordinal constructed from these components.
    number_from_omega_plus_5 = 5
    omega_symbol = "omega"
    plus_operator = "+"

    # The final equation is: Order Type = omega_{omega+5}
    # This string is constructed using the numbers and symbols from the problem.
    final_answer = f"{omega_symbol}_({{{omega_symbol}{plus_operator}{number_from_omega_plus_5}}})"

    print("The final answer is the order type of the set of possible cofinalities.")
    print("Based on the derivation, the final equation for the order type is:")
    print(f"Order Type = {final_answer}")
