    "The problem asks for the VC dimension of the class of formulas $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where the schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates. Let's denote the predicates as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Concept Class**: First, we need to understand what set of classifiers (or \"concepts\") is defined by the given logical fragment. A concept is a set of elements from a domain, and in this context, it's defined by a formula with one free variable, say $\\phi(x)$. We will show that the formulas in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ correspond to the class of concepts formed by conjunctions of the 4 base predicates.\n\n2.  **Define VC Dimension**: The VC dimension of a concept class measures its expressive power. It is the size of the largest set of points that can be *shattered* by the class. A set of points is shattered if, for every possible way of labeling the points (e.g., as 'in' or 'out' of the concept), there is a concept in the class that produces that exact labeling.\n\n3.  **Calculate the VC Dimension**: It's a known result from learning theory that the VC dimension of the concept class of *monotone monomials* (which are simple conjunctions of variables) over $n$ variables is exactly $n$. In our case, we have 4 predicates, so we expect the VC dimension to be 4. We will prove this by:\n    a. Showing that the VC dimension is at least 4. We do this by finding a specific set of 4 points and demonstrating that it can be shattered.\n    b. Arguing that the VC dimension is at most 4. This follows from a general theorem stating that any set of $n+1$ points cannot be shattered by conjunctions over $n$ variables.\n\n4.  **Provide a Demonstrative Script**: The Python code below will implement the proof for part (3a). It will define a set of 4 points and systematically check that for each of the $2^4 = 16$ possible subsets (labelings), there exists a conjunction of the predicates that correctly identifies that subset. This provides a concrete demonstration that the VC dimension is at least 4. The code will also print the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and demonstrates the VC dimension for the given problem.\n    The problem asks for the VC dimension of the set of concepts defined by\n    conjunctions of 4 unary predicates.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of unary predicates in the schema S.
