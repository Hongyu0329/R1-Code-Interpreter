    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the mathematical object**: The user is asking for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$. In the context of algebraic groups, \"number\" typically refers to the number of conjugacy classes under the action of the group of rational points, $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$.\n2.  **Relate tori to Galois cohomology**: The set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is in bijection with the first Galois cohomology set $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, W)$, where $W$ is the Weyl group of $G$. The cohomology is defined with respect to the action of the Frobenius morphism on $W$.\n3.  **Determine the form of G**: A reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ can be split or non-split. The form of the group determines the action of Frobenius on the Weyl group. The Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms. A key theorem in the theory of algebraic groups states that for a simple group whose Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms (like $G_2, F_4, E_8$), any form over a finite field must be the split form.\n4.  **Simplify for the split case**: For a split group, the Frobenius morphism acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. When the Galois action is trivial, the cohomology set $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, W)$ simplifies to the set of ordinary conjugacy classes of the group $W$.\n5.  **Reduce the problem**: The problem is now reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n6.  **Find the number of conjugacy classes**: The number of conjugacy classes for Weyl groups of exceptional types is a well-known result in computational group theory. For $W(E_8)$, this number has been computed to be 112.\n7.  **Construct the code**: I will write a Python script that states this reasoning and provides the final answer. The code will explicitly build the equation mentioned in the prompt to show the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E_8.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The problem asks for the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G of type E_8.\n    # This number corresponds to the number of G(F_q)-conjugacy classes of such tori.\n    \n    # Step 1: The number of tori classes is given by the size of the Galois cohomology set |H^1(F_q, W)|,\n    # where W is the Weyl group of G.\n    group_type = \"E_8\"\n    weyl_group_name = f\"W({group_type})\"\n    \n    # Step 2: For a group of type E_8, any form over a finite field F_q is the split form.\n    # This means the Frobenius map acts trivially on the Weyl group W.\n    \n    # Step 3: For a trivial action, H^1(F_q, W) is the set of conjugacy classes of W.\n    # So, we need the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group W(E_8).\n    \n    # Step 4: The number of conjugacy classes of W(E_8) is a known mathematical result.\n    # It is not computed from a simple formula but is available from sources like the ATLAS of Finite Group Representations.\n    num_conjugacy_classes_W_E8 = 112\n    \n    print(\"Let G be a reductive group of type E_8 over the finite field F_q.\")\n    print(\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of G (up to G(F_q)-conjugacy) is determined as follows:\")\n    print(\"1.
