    "Here is my plan to solve this 3D packing problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze Dimensions:** The container is a cube of 15x15x15. The blocks are 9x1x1. A simple volume division (Cube Volume / Block Volume = 3375 / 9 = 375) gives an upper bound, but it doesn't account for the physical constraints of fitting the shapes.\n\n2.  **Develop a Packing Strategy:** The key is to pack the cube in stages, dealing with the leftover space at each step. This is a greedy approach using orthogonal \"guillotine\" cuts.\n    *   **Stage 1:** Fill the largest possible rectangular volume within the 15x15x15 cube with blocks oriented the same way. We align the 9-unit side of the blocks with one of the cube's 15-unit edges. This fills a `9 x 15 x 15` volume.\n    *   **Stage 2:** This leaves a remaining space of `6 x 15 x 15`. We then try to pack blocks into this new space. We must reorient the blocks, aligning their 9-unit side with one of the 15-unit edges of the remaining space.\n    *   **Stage 3:** This will leave an even smaller space. We repeat the process, reorienting the blocks as needed to fit into the remaining space.\n    *   **Stage 4:** Eventually, the remaining space will be too small to fit any blocks (i.e., all its dimensions will be less than 9).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks placed in each stage.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that follows this step-by-step calculation, printing out the number of blocks added at each stage and the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit\n    inside a 15x15x15 cube using a step-by-step packing strategy.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Stage 1: Initial packing in the 15x15x15 cube ---\n    # We align the block's 9-unit side with one of the cube's axes.\n    # This fills a 9x15x15 section of the cube.\n    \n    s1_x, s1_y, s1_z = 15, 15, 15\n    b_l, b_w, b_h = 9, 1, 1\n    \n    # Calculate blocks in the first section\n    # Fit along x-axis: math.floor(15/9) = 1\n    # Fit along y-axis: math.floor(15/1) = 15\n    # Fit along z-axis: math.floor(15/1) = 15\n    blocks_stage1 = math.floor(s1_x / b_l) * math.floor(s1_y / b_w) * math.floor(s1_z / b_h)\n    \n    # The remaining space is (15-9) x 15 x 15 = 6x15x15\n    \n    # --- Stage 2: Packing the first remaining space (6x15x15) ---\n    # We must orient the block's 9-unit side along a 15-unit edge.\n    s2_x, s2_y, s2_z = 6, 15, 15\n    \n    # Calculate blocks in the second section\n    # Fit along x-axis (6): math.floor(6/1) = 6\n    # Fit along y-axis (15): math.floor(15/9) = 1\n    # Fit along z-axis (15): math.floor(15/1) = 15\n    blocks_stage2 = math.floor(s2_x / b_w) * math.floor(s2_y / b_l) * math.floor(s2_z / b_h)\n\n    # The remaining space is 6 x (15-9) x 15 = 6x6x15\n    \n    # --- Stage 3: Packing the second remaining space (6x6x15) ---\n    # We must orient the block's 9-unit side along the 15-unit edge.\n    s3_x, s3_y, s3_z = 6, 6, 15\n\n    # Calculate blocks in the third section\n    # Fit along x-axis (6): math.floor(6/1) = 6\n    # Fit along y-axis (6): math.floor(6/1) = 6\n    # Fit along z-axis (15): math.floor(15/9) = 1\n    blocks_stage3 = math.floor(s3_x / b_w) * math.floor(s3_y / b_h) * math.floor(s3_z / b_l)\n\n    # The remaining space is 6x6x(15-9) = 6x6x6.\n    # No 9x1x1 block can fit in a 6x6x6 cube.\n\n    # --- Final Calculation ---\n    total_blocks = blocks_stage1 + blocks_stage2 + blocks_stage3\n    \n    print(\"The problem is solved by packing the 15x15x15 cube in stages:\")\n    print(f\"1.
