    "My plan is to identify the character in William Morris's \"The House of the Wolfings\" who fits the user's description.\n\n1.  I will analyze the user's query to understand the specific requirements: a character who has been to a Roman city and describes a religion involving two founders and a wolf, which is a clear reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n2.  I will access my knowledge of the book's plot and characters.\n3.  I'll focus on characters who have experience outside the main tribe, The Wolfings. This points toward the thrall, Otter, who is known for his travels.\n4.  I will confirm that it is indeed Otter who recounts his observations of Roman culture and their founding myth to the other characters. He does this in Chapter IV, \"The Chamber of the Roof,\" where he describes the Romans as worshipping the \"She-wolf\" who suckled their city's founders.\n5.  Finally, I will write a simple Python script to print this character's name as requested in the prompt format.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the character from\n    \"The House of the Wolfings\" who described the Roman founding myth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character in the story is Otter, a thrall who has traveled to Roman lands.\n    # In Chapter IV, he describes the Roman origin story, referring to their founders\n    # as men suckled by a she-wolf, a clear allusion to Romulus and Remus.\n    character_name = \"Otter\"\n    print(f\"The character in William Morris's 'The House of the Wolfings' who describes the Roman founding myth is: {character_name}\")\n\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<Otter>>>"
