    Solves the topological problem by explaining the theoretical reasoning.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of an intersection
    of countably many open dense subsets of a space P(X).
    """

    # Step 1: State the problem and introduce the Baire Category Theorem.
    # The question concerns a countable intersection of open dense sets.
    # This points directly to the Baire Category Theorem.

    # Step 2: Analyze the space P(X).
    # X is a compact connected metric space with more than one point (e.g., [0,1]).
    # This implies X is a "perfect Polish space" (complete, separable, no isolated points).
    # The space 2^X of closed subsets of X is a complete metric space.
    # The space P(X) consists of all sets that are convergent sequences plus their limits.
    # Key properties of P(X):
    #  a) P(X) is a G_δ subset of 2^X. A G_δ subset of a complete metric space
    #     is itself a completely metrizable space (and thus a Baire space).
    #  b) P(X) is a perfect space (it has no isolated points). Any element of P(X)
    #     can be slightly perturbed to create a new, distinct element of P(X)
    #     that is arbitrarily close in the Hausdorff metric.

    # Step 3: Apply the Baire Category Theorem and related results.
    # Let G_n be a countable collection of open dense subsets of P(X).
    # Since P(X) is a Baire space, the intersection G = ∩ G_n is dense in P(X).
    # A more advanced theorem from descriptive set theory states that any dense G_δ subset
    # of a perfect, completely metrizable space must have the cardinality of the continuum.

    # Step 4: Conclude the cardinality.
    # The space G is a dense G_δ subset of the perfect, completely metrizable space P(X).
    # Therefore, its cardinality must be the cardinality of the continuum.
    # This cardinality is independent of the specific choice of X.

    # Step 5: Print the final answer as an equation.
    # The cardinality of the continuum is written as c or 2^{\aleph_0}.
    # The final equation is: cardinality = 2^{\aleph_0}
    # We will now print this result, showing each number in the equation.

    print("The smallest possible cardinality is the cardinality of the continuum.")
    
    number_2 = 2
    number_0 = 0
    # The symbol for Aleph is \u2135
    aleph_symbol = "\u2135"
    
    print(f"The equation for this cardinality is: {number_2}^({aleph_symbol}_{number_0})")
