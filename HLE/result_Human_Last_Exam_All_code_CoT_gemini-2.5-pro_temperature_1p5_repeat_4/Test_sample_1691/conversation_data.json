    "For the given integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$, we want to find an approximation for small $\\epsilon > 0$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Dominant Behavior**: For small $\\epsilon$, the value of the integral is dominated by the region where the denominator is smallest. The polynomial in the denominator, $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$, has its minimum value at $x=0$ within the integration range $[0, 15.0]$. The integrand becomes very large near this point as $\\epsilon \\to 0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the Integrand**: Near the minimum at $x=0$, the polynomial $g(x)$ can be approximated by its lowest power term, which is $g(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$. This is the principle of \"the most important term\". Let's call this approximation $G \\cdot x^P$, where $G=9.0$ and $P=5.0$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Integral**: The integral can thus be approximated as $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.0} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + G x^P} dx$. Since the main contribution comes from small $x$, we can extend the integration limit from $15.0$ to $\\infty$ without affecting the leading-order behavior of the result. This gives $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + G x^P} dx$.\n\n4.  **Solve Analytically**: This simplified integral has a known analytical solution. Through a change of variables ($t = Gx^P/\\epsilon$), it can be transformed into a standard integral form related to the Beta function. The result is:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{P \\cdot \\sin(\\pi/P) \\cdot G^{1/P}} \\epsilon^{(1/P - 1)}$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Result**: I will use a Python script to substitute the values $G=9.0$ and $P=5.0$ into this formula, calculate the resulting coefficient and exponent, and print out the final analytical formula with all numerical values.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays the analytical approximation for the given integral\n    in the small epsilon regime.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The integral is I(eps) = integral from 0 to 15 of 1/(eps + g(x)) dx\n    # where g(x) = 9.0*x^5.0 + 5.0*x^6.0 + 9.0*x^8.0.\n    \n    # For small epsilon, the integral is dominated by the behavior near x=0.\n    # We approximate g(x) by its leading term for small x, which is G * x^P.\n    G = 9.0\n    P = 5.0\n    \n    print(\"### Derivation of the Analytical Formula ###\\n\")\n    print(f\"The integral is approximated by I(eps) ~= Integral(0 to inf) [1 / (eps + {G}*x^{P})] dx.\")\n    print(\"This integral has an analytical solution of the form: C * eps^p\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate the exponent 'p'\n    # p = 1/P - 1\n    p_exponent = 1.0/P - 1.0\n    \n    print(f\"The exponent 'p' is calculated as: p = 1/P - 1 = 1/{P} - 1 = {p_exponent}\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate the coefficient 'C'\n    # C = (pi / (P * sin(pi/P))) * G^(-1/P)\n    # This can be rewritten for clarity as: pi / (P * G^(1/P) * sin(pi/P))\n    pi_val = math.pi\n    sin_pi_over_P = math.sin(pi_val / P)\n    G_pow_1_over_P = math.pow(G, 1.0/P)\n    \n    C_coefficient = pi_val / (P * G_pow_1_over_P * sin_pi_over_P)\n\n    print(\"The coefficient 'C' is calculated using the formula: C = pi / (P * G^(1/P) * sin(pi/P))\")\n    print(\"Plugging in the numbers:\")\n    print(f\"pi = {pi_val}\")\n    print(f\"P = {P}\")\n    print(f\"G = {G}\")\n    print(f\"sin(pi/P) = sin(pi/{P}) = {sin_pi_over_P}\")\n    print(f\"G^(1/P) = {G}^(1/{P}) = {G_pow_1_over_P}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"### Final Analytical Formula ###\\n\")\n    print(\"The final approximate formula, with all numerical values plugged in, is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) approx ({pi_val:.4f} / ({P} * {G_pow_1_over_P:.4f} * {sin_pi_over_P:.4f})) * epsilon^({p_exponent})\")\n    print(\"\\nWhich simplifies to:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) approx {C_coefficient} * epsilon^({p_exponent})\")\n\nsolve_integral_approximation()\n```\n<<<I(epsilon) approx (pi / (5.0 * 9.0**(1.0/5.0) * sin(pi/5.0))) * epsilon**(-4.0/5.0)>>>"
