    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Premise:** The user states the sequence is from the \"middle of an ORF\" (Open Reading Frame). This implies two things:\n    *   The sequence should already be in the correct reading frame. Therefore, we should start translating from the very first nucleotide (this is Frame 1).\n    *   An ORF, by definition, is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain a stop codon.\n\n2.  **Inspect the Sequence:** Upon inspecting the provided nucleotide sequence, I noticed two issues that contradict the premise:\n    *   The sequence contains multiple stop codons (`tag`, `taa`, `tga`).\n    *   The sequence length is 110, which is not a multiple of 3, leaving an incomplete codon at the end.\n\n3.  **Execution Plan:** Despite these contradictions, my task is to translate the given sequence. I will proceed by adhering to the most likely interpretation:\n    *   I will assume **Frame 1** is the correct frame as implied by the prompt.\n    *   I will translate the sequence codon by codon using the standard genetic code.\n    *   Stop codons will be translated to an underscore (`_`).\n    *   The final incomplete codon (`gc`) cannot be translated and will be represented by a question mark (`?`).\n    *   The python script below will define the genetic code, iterate through the sequence, and print each codon-to-amino-acid step before printing the final protein sequence.\n\n```python\ndef translate_orf_fragment():\n    \"\"\"\n    Translates a given DNA sequence fragment into a protein sequence.\n\n    The user specified that the sequence is from the middle of an ORF,\n    so we assume the first reading frame is the correct one.
