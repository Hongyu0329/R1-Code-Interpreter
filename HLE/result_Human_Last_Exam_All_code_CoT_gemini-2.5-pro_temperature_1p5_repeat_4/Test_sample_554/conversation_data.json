    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar, we need to first understand the structure of a standard nanocar and the meaning of the \"perfluoro\" prefix.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the structure of a Nanocar:** A well-known nanocar, developed by Professor James Tour's group at Rice University, consists of a chassis and four wheels. The wheels are typically C60 fullerene molecules (which have no hydrogen atoms), and the chassis is an organic molecule that connects them.\n2.  **Find the chemical formula of the chassis:** A common chassis used for these nanocars has the chemical formula C44H24.\n3.  **Define \"Perfluoro\":** In chemistry, the prefix \"perfluoro-\" means that all the hydrogen (H) atoms in an organic molecule have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n4.  **Calculate the number of fluorine atoms:** By applying the \"perfluoro-\" prefix to the nanocar chassis, we replace all 24 hydrogen atoms with 24 fluorine atoms. The C60 wheels are unaffected as they contain no hydrogen.\n5.  **Create a Python script** to represent this calculation and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fluorine_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n    \n    This is based on a common nanocar structure where:\n    1.
