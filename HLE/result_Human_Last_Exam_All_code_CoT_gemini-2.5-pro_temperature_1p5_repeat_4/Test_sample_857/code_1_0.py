    Problem Analysis:
    We are asked for the largest possible cardinality of the set of points where a hereditarily decomposable continuum X fails to be coastal. Let's call this set NC(X).

    Step 1: Characterizing Non-Coastal Points
    A fundamental theorem in continuum theory (by J.J. Charatonik and W.J. Charatonik) provides a crucial insight. For a hereditarily decomposable continuum X, the set of points where X fails to be coastal is precisely the set of 'terminal points' of X. A point p is a terminal point if for any two subcontinua K1 and K2 containing p, either K1 is a subset of K2 or K2 is a subset of K1.
    So, NC(X) = T(X), where T(X) is the set of terminal points.

    Step 2: Reframing the Question
    The problem is now simplified to finding the maximum possible cardinality of the set of terminal points in a hereditarily decomposable continuum.

    Step 3: Finding the Upper Bound
    A continuum is, by standard definition in this context, a compact, connected, metrizable space. Any metrizable continuum is separable, and its cardinality is at most 'c', the cardinality of the continuum. Since NC(X) is a subset of X, its cardinality cannot exceed c.
    So, |NC(X)| <= |X| <= c.

    Step 4: Demonstrating the Maximum is Attainable
    To show that 'c' is the maximum, we need to show that this cardinality can be achieved. We can do this with a constructive example:
    - Consider a dendrite. A dendrite is a locally connected continuum that contains no simple closed curve.
    - Every dendrite is hereditarily decomposable.
    - In a dendrite, the set of terminal points is the same as the set of 'endpoints'.
    - There exist specific dendrites, such as the 'standard universal plane dendrite', whose set of endpoints is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.
    - The Cantor set is well-known to have a cardinality of 'c'.

    Step 5: Conclusion
    Since the cardinality of non-coastal points is bounded above by 'c' and there exists a valid continuum for which this cardinality is exactly 'c', the largest possible cardinality is 'c'.

    The final answer is c, the cardinality of the continuum.
    This value is given by the equation: c = 2^{\\aleph_0}

    # To satisfy the instruction "output each number in the final equation!",
    # we identify the numbers in the expression c = 2^aleph_0.
    final_equation = "c = 2^aleph_0"
    print(f"The final answer is expressed by the equation: {final_equation}")
    print("The explicit numbers in this equation are 2 and 0.")
