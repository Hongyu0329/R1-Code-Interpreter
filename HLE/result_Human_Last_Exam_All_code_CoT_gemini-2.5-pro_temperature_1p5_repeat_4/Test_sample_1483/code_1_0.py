         "Let's start by clarifying the terms:\n"
         "- Continuum: A compact, connected metric space.\n"
         "- Decomposable Continuum: A continuum X that is the union of two of its proper subcontinua, say X = A U B.\n"
         "- Proper Subcontinuum: A subcontinuum that is not equal to the entire space X.\n"
         "- Regular Subcontinuum: A subcontinuum S such that S is the closure of its own interior, i.e., S = cl(int(S)).\n"
         "The question asks for the minimum possible size of the set of all regular proper subcontinua of such a space X."),

        ("Step 2: Proving the Cardinality is at least 2",
         "Let X be a nondegenerate decomposable continuum. By definition, we can write X = A U B, where A and B are proper subcontinua of X.\n"
         "Since A and B are proper subsets, A does not contain B, and B does not contain A (otherwise if A contains B, X = A U B = A, which contradicts A being proper).\n\n"
         "This means the set U_A = A \\ B and U_B = B \\ A are both non-empty. Since A and B are closed, U_A = X \\ B and U_B = X \\ A are open sets in X.\n\n"
         "Let C_A be any connected component of the open set U_A. C_A is itself a non-empty open set. Let S_A = cl(C_A). It can be shown that:\n"
         "1. S_A is a subcontinuum (closure of a connected set is connected).\n"
         "2. S_A is a proper subcontinuum (since C_A is a subset of A, S_A is a subset of A, which is proper).\n"
         "3. S_A is regular (the closure of any open set is a regular closed set).\n"
         "Thus, S_A is a regular proper subcontinuum.\n\n"
         "Similarly, we can take a connected component C_B of the open set U_B and form S_B = cl(C_B). By the same reasoning, S_B is also a regular proper subcontinuum.\n\n"
         "Are S_A and S_B distinct? Yes. S_A contains the open set C_A, which is entirely contained in A \\ B. S_B is contained within B. Therefore, C_A and S_B are disjoint, proving that S_A cannot be equal to S_B.\n\n"
         "This argument proves that any nondegenerate decomposable continuum must have at least 2 regular proper subcontinua."),

        ("Step 3: Constructing a Continuum with Exactly 2 Regular Proper Subcontinua",
         "Now we need to show that a cardinality of 2 is achievable. Consider the following construction:\n"
         "Let K1 and K2 be two indecomposable continua (for example, two pseudo-arcs in the plane). Let them intersect at a single point, p. Let X = K1 U K2.\n"
         "- X is a continuum (union of two continua with a non-empty intersection).\n"
         "- X is decomposable, as X = K1 U K2, and both K1 and K2 are proper subcontinua.\n\n"
         "Let's find the regular proper subcontinua of X:\n"
         "1. The subcontinuum K1: The interior of K1 in X is int(K1) = K1 \\ {p}. The closure, cl(int(K1)), is K1. So, K1 is a regular proper subcontinuum.\n"
         "2. The subcontinuum K2: Similarly, int(K2) = K2 \\ {p}, and cl(int(K2)) = K2. So, K2 is also a regular proper subcontinuum.\n\n"
         "Are there any others? It can be shown that any other regular proper subcontinuum S would have an interior int(S) which, due to the properties of indecomposable continua, would force its closure cl(int(S)) to be either K1, K2, or the entire space X. Since S must be proper, this leaves K1 and K2 as the only possibilities.\n\n"
