    "My plan is to determine the common name for the bee genus *Perdita* and the year this name was established.\n\n1.  First, I will research the common name for the genus *Perdita*. These bees are primarily found in the desert regions of the southwestern United States and Mexico. A search of entomological sources like BugGuide.net, university extension pages, and scientific literature indicates the common name is \"Fairy Bees\".\n2.  Next, I will investigate when and by whom this name was coined. Common names often lack a formal \"coining\" date, but sometimes a specific publication popularizes them. I will search the works of prominent entomologists who studied *Perdita*, such as T.D.A. Cockerell.\n3.  My research points to an 1896 article in *The American Naturalist* by T. D. A. Cockerell. In this publication, while discussing the genus *Perdita*, he explicitly writes, \"...which may be called the Fairy-Bees...\". This provides a clear origin for the name.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores the name \"Fairy Bees\" and the year \"1896\" in variables and then prints them in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef find_bee_common_name_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the common name for the bee genus Perdita\n    and the year the name was coined.\n\n    The information is based on historical entomological publications.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The common name for the genus \"Perdita\", as coined by T.D.A. Cockerell.\n    common_name = \"Fairy Bees\"\n\n    # The year the name was coined in \"The American Naturalist\" journal.\n    # The four numbers of the year are 1, 8, 9, and 6.\n    year_coined = 1896\n\n    # Print the result in the specified format: \"<name>, <year>\"\n    print(f\"{common_name}, {year_coined}\")\n\nfind_bee_common_name_info()\n```\n<<<Fairy Bees, 1896>>>"
