    This function determines and prints the name of the product from a two-step chemical synthesis.

    Step 1: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide reacts with sec-BuLi and TMEDA.
            This is a directed ortho-metalation. The two directing groups (-CONEt2 at C1
            and -NMe2 at C3) cooperatively direct lithiation to the C2 position.

    Step 2: The resulting aryllithium intermediate reacts with methyl iodide.
            This is an electrophilic quench where the nucleophilic C2-Li attacks
            the methyl group, replacing Li with CH3.
