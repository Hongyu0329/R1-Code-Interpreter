# The problem asks for the smallest number of topologically distinct compactifications
# of the ray with remainder X, where X is a nondegenerate locally-connected
# compact metric space.

# Step 1: State the key mathematical theorem.
# According to a theorem by Aarts and Oversteegen, for a locally connected
# compactum X, the number of distinct compactifications of the ray with
# remainder X is equal to the number of connected components of X.
# Let N(X) be the number of compactifications and C(X) be the number of components.
# Theorem: N(X) = C(X)

# Step 2: Reframe the problem.
# We want to find the minimum value of N(X) over all possible choices of X
# that satisfy the given conditions.
# min_{X} N(X) = min_{X} C(X)

# Step 3: Solve the simplified problem.
# We need to find the minimum number of connected components a space X can have,
# given the constraints.
# Constraint 1: X is nondegenerate, which means it is not an empty set.
# Any non-empty space has at least one connected component.
# Therefore, C(X) >= 1.

# Constraint 2: We must show that C(X) = 1 is achievable.
# Consider the space X = [0, 1] (the closed unit interval).
# - It is nondegenerate.
# - It is locally-connected.
# - It is compact and metric.
# - It is connected, meaning it has exactly 1 component.
# So, a space with C(X) = 1 exists.

# Step 4: Conclude.
# The minimum possible number of connected components is 1.
# Therefore, the smallest number of topologically distinct compactifications is 1.
