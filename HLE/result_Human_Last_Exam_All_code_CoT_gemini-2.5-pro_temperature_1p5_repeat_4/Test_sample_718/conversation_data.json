    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of $n$ for which a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable, given that $J$ is an upper semilattice.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Terminology**:\n    *   An \"$n$-resolvable\" functor is one that has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means its projective dimension, $\\text{pd}(f)$, is less than or equal to $n$. The question asks for a single value of $n$ that works for any such functor, which means we are looking for the maximum possible projective dimension, i.e., the global dimension of the underlying category of functors.\n    *   In the modern representation theory of algebras, \"tameness\" is a property of a category of modules (or functors), not of an individual object. A category is *tame* if its indecomposable objects in any given dimension can be classified by a finite number of one-parameter families.\n    *   The term \"a tame functor\" suggests an indecomposable functor belonging to one of these one-parameter families. The existence of such functors implies that the category $Fun(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is of *tame representation type* and, crucially, not of *finite representation type* (since finite-type categories do not have one-parameter families).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Role of the Conditions**:\n    *   **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**: By itself, this property is not enough to provide a universal bound on $n$. For example, a chain of length $k$, denoted $C_k = \\{1 < 2 < \\dots < k\\}$, is an upper semilattice. Its category of functors is of finite representation type, and its global dimension is $k-1$. Since $k$ can be arbitrarily large, there is no single $n$ that works for all upper semilattices.\n    *   **Tame Functor**: This is the critical condition. As interpreted above, it implies that the poset $J$ must be of tame, non-finite, representation type.\n\n3.  **Combine the Conditions and Apply a Key Theorem**:\n    *   We are looking for the global dimension of the category $Fun(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice of tame, non-finite representation type.\n    *   A major result in the representation theory of posets (due to the work of Nazarova, Drozd, Simson, Skowronski, and others) states that if a finite poset $P$ is of tame representation type but not of finite representation type, then the global dimension of its incidence algebra $K[P]$ is exactly 2. The category $Fun(P, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is equivalent to the category of modules over the incidence algebra $K[P]$.\n    *   The \"upper semilattice\" condition is compatible with this; there exist upper semilattices that are of tame, non-finite representation type (e.g., the cone over a 4-element antichain, which corresponds to the extended Dynkin diagram $\\tilde{D}_4$).\n\n4.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   Since the global dimension of the category is 2, the projective dimension of any functor within this category is at most 2.\n    *   Therefore, any such \"tame functor\" is 2-resolvable. The value of $n$ is 2.\n\nThe following Python code will print the reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tame_functor_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the mathematical problem about the resolvability of a tame functor.\n\n    The code outlines the logical steps to deduce the answer from principles of\n    representation theory of algebras.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding 'n-resolvable'.\")\n    print(\"A functor f is n-resolvable if its projective dimension is at most n.\")\n    print(\"The question asks for a universal n, which corresponds to the global dimension of the category of functors Fun(J, Vect_K).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Interpreting 'tame functor'.\")\n    print(\"In representation theory, tameness is a property of the entire category.\")\n    print(\"The phrase 'a tame functor' implies that the category is of tame representation type, but not of finite representation type.\")\n    print(\"This is because the truly 'tame' indecomposable functors are those in one-parameter families, which do not exist in finite-type categories.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing the conditions.\")\n    print(\"The 'upper semilattice' property alone is insufficient.
