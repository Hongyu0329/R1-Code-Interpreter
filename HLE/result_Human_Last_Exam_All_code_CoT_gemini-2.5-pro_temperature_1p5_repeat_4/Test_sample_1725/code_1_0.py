def solve_crystal_physics_problem():
    """
    This function calculates and prints the answers to the two-part physics problem.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    Part A: Dimension of the fiber of the bundle pi
    1.  The field C is identified with the 3x3 distortion tensor from the continuum theory of defects, which is consistent with all physical constraints given (dislocations, Burgers' vector).
    2.  A 3x3 tensor has 9 independent components.
    3.  Therefore, the dimension of the fiber (the space of possible values of C at a point) is 9.

    Part B: Number of coefficients specifying the energy E
    1.  The energy E is quadratic due to the linear dynamics requirement. It is composed of a strain-dependent part and a dislocation-dependent part: E = E_strain + E_dislocation.
    2.  E_strain depends on the symmetric strain tensor. For a cubic crystal, the number of independent elastic coefficients is 3.
    3.  E_dislocation depends on the dislocation density tensor. For a cubic crystal, the number of independent coefficients in a quadratic form of a general 3x3 tensor can be shown to be 4.
       (This is found by counting the quadratic invariants: 3 for its symmetric part and 1 for its anti-symmetric part).
    4.  The total number of coefficients is the sum of these two counts.
