    "The submitted Java program does not solve the problem correctly. It fails because it only handles two of the four possible statement formats. The code checks for `++X` and `--X` but does not handle `X++` and `X--`. For example, if the input is `X++`, neither of the `if` conditions will be true, and the variable `tresult` will not be updated, leading to a wrong final answer.\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently as requested, a C program is the ideal choice due to its speed and low memory overhead. My plan is to write a C program with an optimized logic and then, to adhere to the response format, provide a Python script that will print this C code.\n\nThe logic for the efficient C program is as follows:\n1.  Read the number of statements, `n`.\n2.  Initialize a counter variable, `x`, to `0`.\n3.  Loop `n` times to process each statement.\n4.  Inside the loop, instead of performing a slow string comparison, we can observe that for all possible statements (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`), the character that uniquely identifies the operation (`+` or `-`) is always present at index 1 (the middle character).\n5.  Therefore, by checking only the character at `statement[1]`, we can determine whether to increment or decrement `x`. This requires only a single character comparison per statement, making it extremely fast.\n6.  After the loop finishes, the program prints the final value of `x`.\n\nThis analysis informs the answer for the `Nx+y` format:\n*   **N**: The original Java program is incorrect.\n*   **x**: The smallest number of character comparisons for an input of 100 instructions. The proposed C logic uses exactly one comparison per instruction (`if (statement[1] == '+')`). For 100 instructions, this results in **100** comparisons.\n*   **y**: The smallest memory size in Bytes (B). A minimal C implementation would require storage for the number of statements (`int n`, 4 bytes), the counter (`int x`, 4 bytes), and a variable to read the critical character of the input (`char op`, 1 byte). The total memory for these variables is `4 + 4 + 1 = 9` bytes. This represents the minimal memory footprint.\n\n```python\n# This Python script prints a complete and efficient C program that correctly solves the problem.\n# C is used as it was specifically requested in the prompt for its efficiency in terms of both speed and memory usage.\n\nc_code_string = \"\"\"\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/*\n * This program solves the Bit++ problem efficiently.\n * It reads 'n' statements and calculates the final value of a variable 'x'\n * which is initialized to 0.\n */\nint main() {\n    int n;\n    // Read the total number of statements from the first line of input.\n    scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n    \n    int x = 0; // Initialize the variable x to 0.\n    char statement[4]; // Buffer to hold one statement (e.g., \"X++\"), plus a null terminator.\n    \n    // Loop 'n' times to process each statement.\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n        // Read the next statement into the buffer.\n        scanf(\"%s\", statement);\n        \n        // The most efficient way to check the operation is to look at the middle\n        // character of the 3-character string (at index 1).\n        // If it's a '+', it must be an increment operation (covers both \"++X\" and \"X++\").\n        // Otherwise, it must be a decrement operation (covers both \"--X\" and \"X--\").\n        // This single character comparison is much faster than searching within a string.\n        if (statement[1] == '+') {\n            x++;\n        } else {\n            x--;\n        }\n    }\n    \n    // Print the final value of x.\n    printf(\"%d\\\\n\", x);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(c_code_string)\n<<<N100+9>>>"
