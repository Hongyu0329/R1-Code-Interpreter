# The user wants to find the product with the higher molar mass from a chemical reaction.
# The reaction involves a spiroketal (indicated by the SMILES string pattern) in acidic water.
# This reaction is a hydrolysis, which opens the spiroketal rings to form a dihydroxy-ketone.
# The dihydroxy-ketone product has a higher molar mass because a water molecule is added during the reaction.
#
# The provided SMILES string 'CC12COC(OC1)(OC2)C1=CC=CC=C1' is syntactically invalid.
# Therefore, we must deduce a plausible product based on the intended fragments (a methyl group and a phenyl group).
#
# We will construct a plausible product: a dihydroxy-ketone containing these fragments.
# A suitable example is 1,6-dihydroxy-6-methyl-1-phenylhexan-3-one.
# This script will output the SMILES string for this molecule.
