    "### The Dilemma of Justified True Belief: Two Critical Flaws Beyond Gettier\n\nThe traditional definition of knowledge as Justified True Belief (JTB) posits that for an individual to \"know\" a proposition, three conditions must be met: the proposition must be true, the individual must believe the proposition, and the belief must be justified. However, when we are constrained to only two epistemic states—Knowledge and Belief—the JTB framework encounters significant problems, even when excluding the famous Gettier cases. These issues challenge the very foundation of what it means to have knowledge.\n\nOne of the primary challenges stems from the persistent issue of **Epistemic Luck**. Beyond the contrived scenarios of Gettier problems, luck can still play a pivotal role in a belief being true, which intuitively undermines the claim to knowledge. For instance, if someone forms a belief based on evidence that is generally reliable but not foolproof, the truth of their belief can still be accidental. This introduces a level of chance that is uncomfortable for a robust definition of knowledge, suggesting that the connection between justification and truth is not as secure as the JTB model implies.\n\nA second and equally pressing problem is the **Nature and Degree of Justification**. The JTB definition treats justification as a binary condition—a belief is either justified or it is not. However, in practice, justification is often a matter of degree. One can have varying amounts of evidence for a belief, making some beliefs more justified than others. This raises a critical question within a binary system of only Belief and Knowledge: at what specific point does a belief become sufficiently justified to transition from mere Belief to the esteemed status of Knowledge? The JTB model fails to provide a non-arbitrary threshold for this transition. This ambiguity suggests that what we call \"knowledge\" might simply be a strongly justified belief, blurring the clear line that the JTB definition seeks to draw between the two epistemic states. Some philosophers even propose that knowledge requires a level of justification so high that it is virtually impossible to attain, making \"justified belief\" the more practical epistemological standard.\n\n<<<Here are two problems that the JTB definition of knowledge runs into, ignoring Gettier problems, when our only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief:\n\n1.  **The Problem of Epistemic Luck (non-Gettier):** Even with justification, a belief's truth can still be a matter of luck. The JTB model struggles to adequately eliminate the role of chance in the connection between justification and truth. This means that a person could have a justified true belief that, intuitively, should not count as knowledge because its accuracy is accidental.\n\n2.  **The Problem of the Nature and Degree of Justification:** The JTB framework treats justification as a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" condition. In reality, justification exists on a spectrum. The theory doesn't specify how much justification is needed to elevate a \"true belief\" to the status of \"knowledge.\" This makes the distinction between a very well-justified belief and knowledge unclear and potentially arbitrary within a system that only allows for these two states.>>>"
