Here are two problems that the JTB definition of knowledge runs into, ignoring Gettier problems, when our only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief:

1.  **The Problem of Epistemic Luck (non-Gettier):** Even with justification, a belief's truth can still be a matter of luck. The JTB model struggles to adequately eliminate the role of chance in the connection between justification and truth. This means that a person could have a justified true belief that, intuitively, should not count as knowledge because its accuracy is accidental.

2.  **The Problem of the Nature and Degree of Justification:** The JTB framework treats justification as a simple "yes" or "no" condition. In reality, justification exists on a spectrum. The theory doesn't specify how much justification is needed to elevate a "true belief" to the status of "knowledge." This makes the distinction between a very well-justified belief and knowledge unclear and potentially arbitrary within a system that only allows for these two states.
