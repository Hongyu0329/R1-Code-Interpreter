    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is resting on one of its faces, it is positioned with one of its twenty equilateral triangular faces flat on the ground. Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, there is an opposite face that is parallel to this base.\n\nWhen the tank is half-filled with water, the water's surface will be a horizontal plane that is exactly halfway between the top and bottom faces of the icosahedron. The shape of this water surface is determined by the cross-section of the icosahedron at this half-height plane.\n\nThe resulting shape of the water surface is a **hexagon**.\n\nTo visualize this, consider the orientation of the icosahedron. When resting on a face, the top face is also an equilateral triangle. The six faces that are adjacent to the bottom face and the six faces adjacent to the top face form the \"sides\" of the tank. The plane of the water at the halfway point will intersect these twelve side faces. Each intersection of the plane with a triangular face creates a line segment. As there are twelve such faces being intersected, the resulting polygon will have twelve sides.\n\nHowever, a closer analysis of the geometry reveals the following: The plane at half-height intersects the edges of the icosahedron. There is a \"belt\" of six vertices around the middle of the icosahedron. The half-full water level corresponds to a plane that passes through these six vertices. Therefore, the shape of the water surface is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<hexagon>>>"
