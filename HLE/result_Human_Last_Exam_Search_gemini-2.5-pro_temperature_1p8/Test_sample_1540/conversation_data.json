    "To solve this problem with maximum memory efficiency, we need to minimize the amount of space allocated for variables. The core idea is to avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously. Since the strings are on separate lines in the input, we must read and store the first string completely before we can start reading the second one. However, we can read the second string one character at a time and compare it with the corresponding character of the stored first string.\n\nThis approach requires one buffer to hold the first string and a few extra variables for the loop and character-by-character reading of the second string.\n\n### The Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\nHere is the C program designed for minimal memory usage.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/*\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is optimized for memory efficiency by only storing the first string\n * and reading the second string character by character.\n */\nint main() {\n    // A buffer to store the first string. The maximum length is 100,\n    // so we need 101 bytes to accommodate the string and the null terminator ('\\0').\n    // Memory usage: 101 * sizeof(char) = 101 bytes.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // A variable to hold a single character from the second string.\n    // Memory usage: 1 * sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    char c2;\n\n    // A loop counter. Since the string length is at most 100, a 'char' type is\n    // sufficient to hold the index (0-99). A char is the smallest integer type.\n    // Memory usage: 1 * sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n    char i;\n\n    // Loop through the first string until its null terminator is reached.\n    for (i = 0; s1[i] != '\\0'; i++) {\n        // Read a single character from the second string for comparison.\n        // The leading space in \" %c\" handles any whitespace (like newlines)\n        // between the first and second strings.\n        scanf(\" %c\", &c2);\n\n        // Convert characters to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n        char lower_s1_char = tolower(s1[i]);\n        char lower_c2_char = tolower(c2);\n\n        // If the first string is lexicographically smaller, print -1 and exit.\n        if (lower_s1_char < lower_c2_char) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        // If the first string is lexicographically larger, print 1 and exit.\n        if (lower_s1_char > lower_c2_char) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // If the loop finishes without finding any differences, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory (`m`) used by the variables in this program is calculated by summing the sizes of all declared variables. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n\n1.  **`char s1[101];`**: An array to store the first string. It allocates space for 101 characters.\n    *   Memory = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n2.  **`char c2;`**: A variable to store one character from the second string.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n3.  **`char i;`**: The loop counter. Using `char` is the most memory-efficient choice since the string length is guaranteed to be between 1 and 100.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nThe variables `lower_s1_char` and `lower_c2_char` might be optimized away by the compiler and their values stored in registers. However, even if they are allocated on the stack, they add 2 more bytes. Let's strictly count the explicitly defined variables that must hold state between statements: `s1`, `c2`, and `i`.\n\nTotal memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables:\nm = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `c2`) + (memory for `i`)\nm = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
