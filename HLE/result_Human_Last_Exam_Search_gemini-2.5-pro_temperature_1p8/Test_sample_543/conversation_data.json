    "The reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent) in refluxing tetrahydrofuran (THF) followed by an aqueous work-up results in the substitution of all three halogen atoms with phenyl groups.\n\nThe reactivity of halogens on an aromatic ring in reactions with Grignard reagents generally follows the order: I > Br > Cl. This means the iodine atom is the most reactive and will be substituted first, followed by the two bromine atoms. The use of excess Grignard reagent and reflux conditions ensures that the less reactive C-Br bonds also react.\n\nThe step-by-step substitution proceeds as follows:\n1.  **First Substitution:** A phenyl group from phenyl magnesium bromide replaces the iodine atom at the 2-position to form 1,3-dibromo-2-phenylbenzene.\n2.  **Second Substitution:** Another phenyl group replaces a bromine atom at either the 1 or 3-position.\n3.  **Third Substitution:** The final bromine atom is substituted by a third phenyl group.\n\nThe final product is a benzene ring with three phenyl substituents located at the 1, 2, and 3 positions. The aqueous work-up serves to quench any unreacted Grignard reagent and neutralize the reaction mixture.\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name of the resulting product is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
