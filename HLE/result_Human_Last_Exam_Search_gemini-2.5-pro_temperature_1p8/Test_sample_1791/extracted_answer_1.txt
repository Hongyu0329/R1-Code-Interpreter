The effective electron-electron interaction, for a specific momentum transfer $\mathbf{q}$ and frequency $\omega_n$, mediated by phonons is given by:
$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, \omega_n) = - \frac{g^2}{m} \left( \sum_j q_j^2 \right) \frac{1}{w_{\mathbf{q}}^2 + \omega_n^2}$
For an isotropic system, this simplifies to:
$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}, \omega_n) = - \frac{g^2 q^2}{m} \frac{1}{w_q^2 + \omega_n^2}$
This interaction is attractive and retarded. The corresponding static interaction (at $\omega_n=0$) is:
$V_{eff}(\mathbf{q}) = - \frac{g^2 q^2}{m w_q^2}$
