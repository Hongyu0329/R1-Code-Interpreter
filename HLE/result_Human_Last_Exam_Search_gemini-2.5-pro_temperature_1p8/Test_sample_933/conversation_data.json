    "The most common and efficient method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) involves the direct reaction of xenon and fluorine gases. This synthesis is typically carried out by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine, often in a 1:5 molar ratio, in a sealed nickel vessel at a temperature of 400°C. The pressure for this reaction is maintained at around 6 atmospheres.\n\nThis specific temperature is highlighted as optimal in numerous sources. A US patent for the process specifies a temperature range between 350 and 450°C, but indicates a preference for 400°C. While flow methods can use a broader temperature range of 300-500°C, these can lead to contamination with Xenon difluoride (XeF₂). The original synthesis of XeF₄ in 1962 was also successfully performed at 400°C.\n\nIt is crucial to control the temperature, as lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of XeF₂, while higher temperatures and an excess of fluorine favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). Therefore, 400°C represents a well-established temperature for the efficient and selective production of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\n<<<B>>>"
