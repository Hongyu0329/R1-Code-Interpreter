    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes**.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a part of the posterior subesophageal mass, which is a collection of brain structures located in the rear part of the cuttlefish brain. This entire posterior section of the brain is enclosed by a cartilaginous structure.\n\nA three-dimensional brain atlas of the dwarf cuttlefish reveals the specific arrangement of these lobes. Views of the posterior aspect of the brain show the palliovisceral lobe situated anteriorly to the posterior chromatophore lobes. The fin lobes are also located in this posterior region, positioned laterally to the posterior chromatophore lobes.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe itself is involved in controlling escape movements and the expulsion of ink. The adjacent posterior chromatophore lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores (color- and pattern-changing cells) on the mantle of the cuttlefish.<<<In the dwarf cuttlefish, the posterior chromatophore lobes lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe.>>>"
