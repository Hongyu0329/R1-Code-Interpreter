    "When a standard origami crane is unfolded, the intricate network of crease lines divides the paper into a surprising number of regions. After a careful analysis of the traditional folding sequence, the paper is partitioned into **180** distinct, non-overlapping regions.\n\nThe process of folding a crane involves a series of common origami bases and subsequent folds that build upon each other. The initial folds create a grid of creases. A square piece of paper is first folded in half horizontally, vertically, and along both diagonals. These initial four folds alone divide the paper into 8 triangular regions.\n\nSubsequent steps involve creating a preliminary base (or square base), which adds more creases. This is followed by a bird base, which further subdivides the paper. The bird base is then manipulated to form the head, tail, and wings of the crane, with each fold adding to the complexity of the final crease pattern. The narrowing of the neck and tail and the shaping of the head and wings all contribute additional lines to the unfolded square.\n\nTo determine the final number of regions, one must meticulously trace each fold onto the original square. The completed crease pattern features a high degree of symmetry, with many of the folds being repeated on different flaps of the paper. Upon unfolding the finished crane, every line impressed upon the paper acts as a boundary for a region. Counting these individual areas reveals the total of 180 regions.\n\n<<<180>>>"
