    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C₂ in Schoenflies notation. This information is based on the comprehensive database of the best known packings of equal circles in a circle. A published scientific paper also refers to the packing of 1135 circles as having C₂ symmetry.\n\n<<<C₂>>>"
