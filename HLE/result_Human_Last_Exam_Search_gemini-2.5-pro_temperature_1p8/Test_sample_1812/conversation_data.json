The provided context about the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) does not alter the calculation for the specific matrix provided. The Markov quiver is a known structure in cluster algebra. Its associated matrices are subjects of study in various fields of mathematics and physics. However, the question boils down to a direct computation of the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n<<<0>>>"
