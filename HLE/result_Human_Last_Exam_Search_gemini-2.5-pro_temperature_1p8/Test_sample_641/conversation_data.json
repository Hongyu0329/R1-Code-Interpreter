    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4,997) is determined by the structure of the group, specifically its order and the nature of its conjugacy classes of involutions. For odd prime powers *q*, such as 997, the group PSU(4, *q*) has a single conjugacy class of involutions. This means that all involutions within the group are conjugate to one another.\n\nTo find the total number of involutions, we can use the orbit-stabilizer theorem, which in this context states that the number of involutions is equal to the order of the group divided by the order of the centralizer of any given involution.\n\nThe order of the group PSU(n, *q*) is given by the formula:\n|PSU(n, *q*)| = [ *q*<sup>n(n-1)/2</sup> * Î <sub>i=2 to n</sub>(*q*<sup>i</sup> - (-1)<sup>i</sup>) ] / gcd(n, *q*+1)\n\nFor PSU(4, 997), we have n=4 and q=997:\n*   The greatest common divisor of 4 and (997+1) is gcd(4, 998) = 2.\n*   Therefore, the order of PSU(4, 997) is [ 997<sup>6</sup> * (997<sup>2</sup> - 1) * (997<sup>3</sup> + 1) * (997<sup>4</sup> - 1) ] / 2.\n\nThe centralizer of an involution in PSU(4, *q*) for odd *q* has a well-defined structure. According to authoritative sources on finite simple groups, the centralizer of an involution is a group of the form (SL(2,*q*) x SL(2,*q*)).2. The order of the special linear group SL(2,*q*) is *q*(*q*<sup>2</sup>-1). Consequently, the order of the centralizer is:\n|C(t)| = 2 * |SL(2,997)|<sup>2</sup> = 2 * [997 * (997<sup>2</sup> - 1)]<sup>2</sup>\n\nThe number of involutions is the ratio of the order of the group to the order of the centralizer:\nNumber of involutions = |PSU(4,997)| / |C(t)|\n= [ 997<sup>6</sup> * (997<sup>2</sup> - 1)(997<sup>3</sup> + 1)(997<sup>4</sup> - 1) / 2 ] / [ 2 * 997<sup>2</sup> * (997<sup>2</sup> - 1)<sup>2</sup> ]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n[ 997<sup>4</sup> * (997+1) * (997<sup>2</sup> - 997 + 1) * (997<sup>2</sup> + 1) ] / 4\n\nBy substituting q=997, the final number of involutions can be calculated.\n\nNumber of involutions = [997<sup>4</sup> * 998 * (997<sup>2</sup> - 997 + 1) * (997<sup>2</sup> + 1)] / 4\n= [997<sup>4</sup> * 998 * 993013 * 994010] / 4\n\nThis calculation yields the precise number of involutions in PSU(4,997).\n\n<<<244531102914170364843485775>>>"
