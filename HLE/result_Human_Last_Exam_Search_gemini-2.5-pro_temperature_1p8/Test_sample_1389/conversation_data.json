    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, 1 minus the incidence rate ratio will correctly estimate the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\nAn \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine is a type of vaccine that confers complete protection to a certain percentage of vaccinated individuals, while the remaining portion of vaccinated individuals receives no protection at all. For instance, if a vaccine has an 80% all-or-nothing efficacy, it means 80% of those who are vaccinated are fully immune, and the other 20% have the same susceptibility to the infection as unvaccinated individuals.\n\nThe per-exposure vaccine efficacy, in the context of an all-or-nothing vaccine, refers to the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are completely protected from the infection.\n\nThe incidence rate is the rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population over a specific period. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) is calculated by dividing the incidence rate in the vaccinated group by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group. Vaccine efficacy (VE) is commonly estimated as 1 - IRR.\n\nIn the case of an all-or-nothing vaccine, the individuals who are not protected by the vaccine will get infected at the same rate as the unvaccinated population. The protected individuals will not get infected at all, regardless of their exposure to the pathogen.\n\nTherefore, the overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group will be lower than that of the unvaccinated group, in direct proportion to the fraction of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected. This means that 1 - IRR accurately reflects the proportion of the vaccinated population that is protected, which is the definition of per-exposure efficacy for this vaccine model.\n\nStudies that model and compare different vaccine types have shown that for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the measured vaccine effectiveness based on the incidence rate remains constant over time and accurately reflects the proportion of the population that is fully protected.\n\n<<<C>>>"
