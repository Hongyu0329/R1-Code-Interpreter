    "Analyzing the chessboard from the provided FEN string `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20` reveals a winning position for White, assuming optimal play from both sides.\n\nThrough a detailed analysis of the position, it is determined that White can force a checkmate in a specific number of moves. The most efficient line of play for White leads to a checkmate in 5 moves.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n1. Qxf7+ Kh8\n2. Ng6+ Kh7\n3. Nf8+ Kh8\n4. Qg8+ Kxg8\n5. Bf7#\n\nTherefore, White can win in 5 moves.\n\n<<<5>>>"
