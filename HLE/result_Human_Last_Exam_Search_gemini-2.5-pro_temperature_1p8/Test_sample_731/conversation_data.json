    "In group theory, a power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be formed by taking all the elements of G and raising them to the power of a fixed integer `k`. Specifically, $H = G^k = \\{g^k | g \\in G\\}$. The number of such subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512 is 9.\n\nThe semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as $SD_{512}$, is a non-abelian group with a specific structure. It is defined by the presentation:\n$SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n\nThe power subgroups of $SD_{512}$ can be determined by considering two cases for the integer exponent `k`:\n\n1.  **When `k` is odd:** The set of all k-th powers of elements of $SD_{512}$ results in the group $SD_{512}$ itself. This is because raising the generators to an odd power does not reduce the set of generated elements. Therefore, for any odd `k`, we get one distinct power subgroup, which is the group $SD_{512}$.\n\n2.  **When `k` is even:** When `k` is an even number, the power subgroup $G^k$ simplifies to a cyclic subgroup generated by an element of the form $r^d$. Here, `d` must be an even divisor of 256. The even divisors of 256 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and 256. This results in 8 distinct cyclic subgroups:\n    *   $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$\n    *   $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$\n    *   $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$\n    *   $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$\n    *   $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$\n    *   $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$\n    *   $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$\n    *   $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle$ (which is the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element)\n\nCombining these two cases, we have 1 power subgroup from the odd exponents and 8 power subgroups from the even exponents. Thus, there are a total of $1 + 8 = 9$ power subgroups.\n\nThis result can be generalized: for a semidihedral group of order $2^n$ (where $n \\ge 4$), the number of power subgroups is exactly `n`. In this case, the group is $SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}$, so $n=9$, which confirms the result of 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
