    "There are 511 negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48. This result is based on the work of Mark Watkins, who in 2004 computed the complete list of all imaginary quadratic fields with class numbers up to 100.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in its modern form, asks for a complete list of imaginary quadratic fields for each class number. For any given class number, there is a finite number of such fields. Watkins' extensive computations provided these lists for class numbers up to 100. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) entry A046125, which is defined as the number of negative fundamental discriminants having class number *n*, directly lists the value for *n*=48 as 511, citing Watkins' paper as the reference.\n\n<<<511>>>"
