(a) Yes. The conditions given, particularly \( g^2 \cdot 1_R = 1_R \), are often associated with actions being termed "symmetric" in the context of partial Hopf algebra actions, as suggested by research literature on the topic.

(b) \( (x \cdot 1_R)^2 (a \cdot 1_R) - (g^2 a \cdot 1_R) (x \cdot 1_R)^2 \)

(c) \( w^3 [ (a \cdot 1_R) - (1+q^{-1}+q^{-2})(g a \cdot 1_R) + q^{-1}(1+q^{-1}+q^{-2})(g^2 a \cdot 1_R) - q^{-3}(g^3 a \cdot 1_R) ] \), where \( w = x \cdot 1_R \).
