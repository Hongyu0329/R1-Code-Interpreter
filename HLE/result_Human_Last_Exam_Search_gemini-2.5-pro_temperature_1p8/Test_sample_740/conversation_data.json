    "This is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind.\nThe equation is given by:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 K(x,y) u(y) dy$, where the kernel is $K(x,y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$.\n\nFirst, we can simplify the kernel. The expression for the kernel is a finite geometric series:\n$K(x,y) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\nThis shows that the kernel is separable. This also shows the kernel is symmetric, i.e., $K(x,y) = K(y,x)$.\n\nLet's substitute this form of the kernel back into the integral equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$.\n\nLet's define the moments $c_k$ as the following constants:\n$c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$, for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nWith this definition, the solution $u(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\n\nNow, we can establish a system of linear equations for the unknown moments $c_j$. We substitute the expression for $u(y)$ into the definition of $c_j$:\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j \\left(1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k}\\right) dy$\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j dy + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\int_0^1 y^{j+n-1-k} dy$\n$c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$.\n\nThis can be written as a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknowns $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}$:\n$c_j - \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{j+n-k} c_k = \\frac{1}{j+1}$, for $j = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nLet's represent this system in matrix form as $(I - \\lambda A) \\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$, where:\n*   $\\mathbf{c}$ is the column vector of moments $[c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}]^T$.\n*   $\\mathbf{b}$ is the column vector $[1, 1/2, 1/3, \\dots, 1/n]^T$.\n*   $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$, where $j$ is the row index and $k$ is the column index ($j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$).\n\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system of linear equations has a unique solution if the matrix $(I - \\lambda A)$ is non-singular, i.e., $\\det(I - \\lambda A) \\neq 0$. This condition is equivalent to $\\lambda$ not being the reciprocal of an eigenvalue of $A$.\n\nIf $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value, meaning $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$ where $\\mu$ is an eigenvalue of $A$, then $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$. In this case, the equation may have no solutions or infinitely many solutions.\nThe equation has no solution if the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is not in the column space of $(I - \\lambda A)$. This is equivalent to $\\mathbf{b}$ not being orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint matrix $(I - \\lambda A)^T = I - \\lambda A^T$.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{y}$ be a vector in the null space of $I - \\lambda A^T$, which means $\\mathbf{y}$ is an eigenvector of $A^T$ for the eigenvalue $\\mu = 1/\\lambda$:\n$A^T \\mathbf{y} = \\mu \\mathbf{y}$.\n\nThe condition for having no solution is that $\\mathbf{b}$ is not orthogonal to $\\mathbf{y}$, i.e., $\\mathbf{b}^T \\mathbf{y} \\neq 0$.\nLet's compute the scalar product $\\mathbf{b}^T \\mathbf{y}$:\n$\\mathbf{b}^T \\mathbf{y} = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} b_j y_j = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{y_j}{j+1}$.\n\nNow, let's look at the eigenvector equation $A^T \\mathbf{y} = \\mu \\mathbf{y}$. The entries of $A^T$ are $(A^T)_{jk} = A_{kj} = \\frac{1}{k+n-j}$. Let's use indices $i$ and $j$: $(A^T)_{ij} = \\frac{1}{j+n-i}$. The eigenvector equation is:\n$\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{y_j}{j+n-i} = \\mu y_i$, for $i=0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nConsider the specific case for the last row, $i = n-1$:\n$\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{y_j}{j+n-(n-1)} = \\mu y_{n-1}$\n$\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \\frac{y_j}{j+1} = \\mu y_{n-1}$.\n\nThe left side is exactly the scalar product $\\mathbf{b}^T \\mathbf{y}$. So we have:\n$\\mathbf{b}^T \\mathbf{y} = \\mu y_{n-1}$.\n\nThe condition for no solution is $\\mathbf{b}^T \\mathbf{y} \\neq 0$, which translates to $\\mu y_{n-1} \\neq 0$.\nSince $\\mu=1/\\lambda$ must be a non-zero eigenvalue, this condition simplifies to $y_{n-1} \\neq 0$.\n\nFor Cauchy-type matrices like $A^T$, it can be shown that the components of the eigenvectors are generally non-zero. Specifically, for an eigenvalue $\\mu$ of $A^T$, if the last component of the corresponding eigenvector $y_{n-1}$ were zero, then $\\mu$ would also have to be an eigenvalue of the principal submatrix of $A^T$ of size $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$. It is a known property of such matrices that their eigenvalues are distinct and interlace with those of their principal submatrices, so they cannot be identical. Therefore, $y_{n-1}$ cannot be zero for any eigenvector.\n\nThis implies that for any eigenvalue $\\mu$ of $A$, the condition $\\mathbf{b}^T \\mathbf{y} \\ne 0$ holds for the corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{y}$ of $A^T$.\nThus, for any characteristic value $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$, the equation has no solution.\n\nThe problem is reduced to finding the characteristic values of $\\lambda$. These are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$.\n\nFor n=1, the equation is $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 u(y)dy$.\n$c_0 = 1 + \\lambda c_0 \\implies c_0(1-\\lambda)=1$.\nThere is no solution if $\\lambda = 1$.\nUsing the matrix method: $A_{00} = \\frac{1}{0+1-0} = 1$. So $A=$. The eigenvalue is $\\mu=1$. $\\lambda=1/\\mu=1$.\n\nFor n=2, the equation is $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1(x+y)u(y)dy$.\nThe matrix is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 & 1 \\\\ 1/3 & 1/2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe eigenvalues $\\mu$ of $A$ are solutions to $\\det(A-\\mu I)=0$:\n$(1/2-\\mu)^2 - 1/3 = 0 \\implies \\mu = 1/2 \\pm 1/\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{6}$.\nThe values of $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$ are:\n$\\lambda = \\frac{6}{3 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{6(3 \\mp 2\\sqrt{3})}{9-12} = -2(3 \\mp 2\\sqrt{3}) = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nSo, the equation has no solution for values of $\\lambda$ that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ defined by $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., n-1\\}$.\n\n<<<The values of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the $n \\times n$ matrix $A$ whose elements are given by $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$, where $j$ is the row index and $k$ is the column index, both ranging from $0$ to $n-1$.>>>"
