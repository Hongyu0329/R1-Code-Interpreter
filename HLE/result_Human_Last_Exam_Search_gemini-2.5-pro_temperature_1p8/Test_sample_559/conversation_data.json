    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and analyze their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors, and it is often associated with the stable or unstable manifolds of a saddle point.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points exist where $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom the equation for $u'$, we have $(u-1)u^2 = 0$, which yields $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the equation for $d'$ gives $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point $(0,0)$.\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the equation for $d'$ gives $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2+2d=0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This yields $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives the equilibrium points $(0,1)$ and $(-1,1)$.\n\nThus, the equilibrium points in the phase plane are $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(-1,1)$.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis**\n\nTo determine the stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system:\n$$J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n*   **At (0,1):** The Jacobian is $J(0,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=2$ and $\\lambda_2=1$. Since both are positive, $(0,1)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n*   **At (-1,1):** The Jacobian is $J(-1,1) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=-2$ and $\\lambda_2=1$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, $(-1,1)$ is a saddle point. The invariant manifolds of saddle points act as separatrices, dividing the phase plane into regions of distinct dynamic behaviors.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrix is an invariant manifold of the system. For a saddle point, its stable and unstable manifolds are key candidates for being separatrices. We test for a simple analytical solution in the form of a curve $d=f(u)$ that represents a trajectory of the system. Let's test the candidate solution $d = -u^2$. This curve passes through the saddle point $(-1,1)$ since $-1 = -(1)^2$, and also through the equilibrium point $(0,0)$.\n\nTo verify if $d(t) = -u(t)^2$ is a solution, we must check if it satisfies the system's differential equations. Taking the derivative of $d=-u^2$ with respect to $t$:\n$d' = -2u \\cdot u' = -2u(u^3 - u^2) = 2u^3 - 2u^4$.\n\nNow, we substitute $d = -u^2$ into the right-hand side of the first differential equation:\n$2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - (u^3 - u^4)$\n$= 2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) - u^3 + u^4$\n$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4$\n$= (2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3$\n$= -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\nSince both expressions are equal, the equation $d = -u^2$ describes a trajectory of the system. This trajectory connects the saddle point $(-1,1)$ to the equilibrium point $(0,0)$. This specific trajectory is the unstable manifold of the saddle point that enters the region $0 \\leq u < 1$. It acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase plane. Trajectories on one side of this curve will exhibit a different long-term behavior compared to trajectories on the other side.\n\nFor the system of differential equations considered on the upper half-plane ($u\\geq 0$), the separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
