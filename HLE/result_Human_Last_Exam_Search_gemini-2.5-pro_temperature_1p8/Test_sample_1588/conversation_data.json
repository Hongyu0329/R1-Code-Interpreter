    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 55.\n\nThe total number of coefficients for the BCH expansion at a specific order is equivalent to the dimension of the free Lie algebra with two generators (conventionally denoted as X and Y) at that degree. This dimension can be determined using Witt's formula. For a free Lie algebra of rank *k* and degree *n*, Witt's formula is:\n\n(1/n) * Σ<sub>d|n</sub> μ(d) * k<sup>(n/d)</sup>\n\nHere, the sum is over all positive divisors *d* of *n*, and μ is the Möbius function. For order 10, we have *n*=10 and *k*=2. The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The corresponding values of the Möbius function are μ(1)=1, μ(2)=-1, μ(5)=-1, and μ(10)=1.\n\nApplying Witt's formula, the total number of coefficients is:\n(1/10) * [μ(1) * 2<sup>(10/1)</sup> + μ(2) * 2<sup>(10/2)</sup> + μ(5) * 2<sup>(10/5)</sup> + μ(10) * 2<sup>(10/10)</sup>]\n= (1/10) * [1 * 2<sup>10</sup> - 1 * 2<sup>5</sup> - 1 * 2<sup>2</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>1</sup>]\n= (1/10) * [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]\n= (1/10) * 990 = 99\n\nSo, there is a total of 99 coefficients at order 10.\n\nHowever, not all of these coefficients are non-zero. The number of non-zero coefficients depends on the choice of basis for the free Lie algebra. A common and natural choice is the Lyndon basis. For the Lyndon basis, it has been shown that for even-numbered degrees, there is a systematic pattern of vanishing (zero) coefficients.\n\nFor an even degree *m* = 2*p*, the number of zero coefficients in the Lyndon basis is given by the formula:\nnc(2*p*) = dim(L<sub>2*p*</sub>) - dim(L<sub>2*p*-1</sub>) + 1\n\nFor order 10, we have *p*=5. The number of zero coefficients is therefore:\nnc(10) = dim(L<sub>10</sub>) - dim(L<sub>9</sub>) + 1\n\nWe have already calculated dim(L<sub>10</sub>) = 99. We need to calculate dim(L<sub>9</sub>) using Witt's formula (*n*=9, *k*=2). The divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9, with μ(1)=1, μ(3)=-1, and μ(9)=0.\ndim(L<sub>9</sub>) = (1/9) * [μ(1) * 2<sup>(9/1)</sup> + μ(3) * 2<sup>(9/3)</sup> + μ(9) * 2<sup>(9/9)</sup>]\n= (1/9) * [1 * 2<sup>9</sup> - 1 * 2<sup>3</sup> + 0 * 2<sup>1</sup>]\n= (1/9) * [512 - 8]\n= (1/9) * 504 = 56\n\nNow, the number of zero coefficients at order 10 is:\nnc(10) = 99 - 56 + 1 = 44\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients is the total number of coefficients minus the number of zero coefficients:\nNumber of nonzero coefficients = 99 - 44 = 55.\n\n<<<55>>>"
