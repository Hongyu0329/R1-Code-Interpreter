In one of the commercials, Gell-Mann is seen speaking about the importance of questioning existing ideas to make progress.\n\nPaul Krugman, who would later win the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, had a paid relationship with Enron. In 1999, he served on an advisory board for the company and received $50,000 for his role. Although he was associated with Enron, it is not clear whether he was featured in the \"Ask Why\" commercials themselves.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
