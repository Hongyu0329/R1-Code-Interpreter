    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation in the large $x$ regimes, we analyze the behavior of each term as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe equation is:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nFor large values of $x$, we look for the dominant terms that dictate the behavior of the solution. The method of dominant balance is appropriate for this purpose. This method involves comparing the magnitudes of the terms in the equation to find a simplified, solvable approximation.\n\nLet's examine the terms for large $x$:\n*   $y'''$, $y^4$, $y'^4$: The behavior of these terms depends on the solution $y(x)$.\n*   $-\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2}$: This term's denominator grows as $x^2$. Unless $y''$ grows faster than $x^2$, this term will become negligible compared to any constant or growing terms.\n*   $\\frac{1}{\\tan(x)+1}$: This is an oscillating term with singularities. It does not approach a limit as $x \\to \\infty$. Finding an exact analytical solution that incorporates this term is complex. A common approach in such problems is to find the leading-order behavior of the corresponding autonomous system, effectively treating the oscillatory term as a forcing function that we can neglect to find the underlying trend.\n\nWe will, therefore, find the asymptotic solution for the simplified equation:\n$y''' \\approx y^4 + y'^4$\n\nWe hypothesize a solution of the form $y(x) = Ax^n$ for large $x$.\n*   $y' = Anx^{n-1}$\n*   $y''' = An(n-1)(n-2)x^{n-3}$\n*   $y^4 = A^4x^{4n}$\n*   $(y')^4 = (Anx^{n-1})^4 = A^4n^4x^{4n-4}$\n\nWe need to find a balance between the most dominant terms.\n1.  Compare the two nonlinear terms, $y^4$ and $(y')^4$. Their exponents are $4n$ and $4n-4$. For any value of $n$, $4n > 4n-4$. Thus, for large $x$, the $y^4$ term will be dominant over the $(y')^4$ term. So, the right side of the simplified equation is dominated by $y^4$.\n2.  Now we must balance the dominant term on the left side ($y'''$) with the dominant term on the right side ($y^4$).\n    $y''' \\approx y^4$\n3.  To balance these terms, their orders of magnitude in $x$ must be the same. We equate their exponents:\n    $n-3 = 4n \\implies 3n = -3 \\implies n = -1$.\n4.  This potential solution $y(x) = Ax^{-1}$ is consistent with our assumption in step 1, as for $n=-1$, the term $y^4 \\sim x^{-4}$ is indeed much larger than $(y')^4 \\sim x^{-8}$ for large $x$. We also check the neglected term from the original equation: $-\\frac{y''}{3x^2+2} \\sim -\\frac{2Ax^{-3}}{3x^2} \\sim O(x^{-5})$, which is also smaller than the balanced terms ($O(x^{-4})$).\n5.  Now we solve for the constant coefficient $A$ by substituting $y(x)=Ax^{-1}$ into the balance equation $y'''=y^4$:\n    *   $y'''(x) = A(-1)(-2)(-3)x^{-4} = -6Ax^{-4}$\n    *   $y^4(x) = (Ax^{-1})^4 = A^4x^{-4}$\n    Equating the coefficients gives:\n    $-6A = A^4$\n6.  Assuming a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we can divide by $A$:\n    $A^3 = -6$\n    $A = \\sqrt{-6} \\approx -1.81712$\n7.  Rounding the coefficient to two decimal places, we get $A \\approx -1.82$.\n\nThe approximate analytical expression for the solution in the large $x$ regime is:\n$y(x) \\approx -1.82 x^{-1}$\n\n<<<y(x) = -1.82/x>>>"
