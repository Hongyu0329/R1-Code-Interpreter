    "It is possible for the intersection of the two closed connected subsets of the plane, whose union is the unit square, to have any finite number of connected components. There is no largest number.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we can construct an example for any given integer *n* > 1.\n\nImagine *n* separate closed discs inside the unit square. To form one of the connected sets, let's call it 'B', we can join these discs with thin, closed rectangular strips. The resulting set 'B' is a single, connected, closed set contained entirely within the interior of the unit square. The boundary of this set 'B' consists of *n* disjoint circles (the boundaries of the original discs).\n\nNow, let the second set, 'A', be the closure of the complement of 'B' within the unit square.\n*   **A is closed** by definition.\n*   **A is connected**. Since 'B' is contained in the interior of the square, the entire boundary of the square is part of 'A'. Any two points in 'A' can be connected by a path that may utilize the boundary of the square, thus 'A' is connected.\n*   **The union of A and B is the unit square**. This is true by construction, as A is essentially the square with holes punched out by the interior of B, and B fills these holes.\n*   **The intersection of A and B is the boundary of B**. This boundary, as established, is made up of *n* disjoint circles.\n\nTherefore, for any integer *n*, we can construct two closed connected sets whose union is the unit square and whose intersection has *n* connected components. Since *n* can be any positive integer, there is no largest number of components.\n\nWhile it's a known theorem in topology that the intersection of two closed connected sets whose union is the 2-sphere must be connected, this does not apply straightforwardly to a square in the plane because one of the sets could be entirely contained within the interior of the square, which prevents the direct application of sphere-based proofs.\n\nIt is also possible to construct examples with a countably infinite number of components.\n\n<<<There is no largest number.>>>"
