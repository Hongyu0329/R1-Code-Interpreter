    "The problem asks for the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, denoted $S_{25}$, that have a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers that sum to $n$. For each partition $\\lambda$ of $n=25$, there is a corresponding irreducible representation with a dimension that can be calculated using the hook-length formula. The formula states that the dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is $n!$ divided by the product of the hook lengths of all the cells in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$.\n\nA comprehensive search for tables of dimensions of the irreducible representations of $S_{25}$ allows for a systematic counting of the irreps with dimensions below the given threshold. By examining such tables, the following partitions and their corresponding representation dimensions are identified.\n\nIt is a known property that a partition and its conjugate have corresponding irreducible representations of the same dimension. For example, the partition (24, 1) and its conjugate (2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1), often written as $(2, 1^{23})$, both correspond to representations of dimension 24.\n\nHere is a list of the pairs of conjugate partitions (or self-conjugate partitions) of 25 and the dimensions of their corresponding irreducible representations that are less than 500,000:\n\n*   **Dimension 1**:\n    *   Partitions: (25) and its conjugate (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) or $(1^{25})$.
