    "Here is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem, followed by a detailed calculation of the memory used.\n\n### C Program\n\nThe most memory-efficient strategy is to read the input string character by character without storing the entire string in a buffer. This approach uses a counting sort method. We count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, and 4) and then construct and print the sorted sum directly. This avoids allocating a large array for the input string or for the numbers themselves.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/**\n * This program reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) as a string,\n * counts the occurrences of each number, and then prints the\n * sum with the numbers sorted in non-decreasing order.\n * This approach is highly memory-efficient as it does not store\n * the whole input string.\n */\nint main() {\n    // Four integer variables to store the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    int count1 = 0;\n    int count2 = 0;\n    int count3 = 0;\n    int count4 = 0;\n\n    // A single char variable to read the input character by character.\n    char c;\n\n    // Read the input until a newline or the end-of-file is reached.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        // Increment the appropriate counter if the character is a digit.\n        if (c == '1') {\n            count1++;\n        } else if (c == '2') {\n            count2++;\n        } else if (c == '3') {\n            count3++;\n        } else if (c == '4') {\n            count4++;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // A flag to correctly handle printing the '+' separator.\n    // Using 'char' instead of 'int' saves memory.\n    char is_first_term = 1;\n\n    // Print the numbers based on their counts, separated by '+'.\n    while (count1-- > 0) {\n        if (!is_first_term) {\n            printf(\"+\");\n        }\n        printf(\"1\");\n        is_first_term = 0;\n    }\n\n    while (count2-- > 0) {\n        if (!is_first_term) {\n            printf(\"+\");\n        }\n        printf(\"2\");\n        is_first_term = 0;\n    }\n\n    while (count3-- > 0) {\n        if (!is_first_term) {\n            printf(\"+\");\n        }\n        printf(\"3\");\n        is_first_term = 0;\n    }\n\n    while (count4-- > 0) {\n        if (!is_first_term) {\n            printf(\"+\");\n        }\n        printf(\"4\");\n        is_first_term = 0;\n    }\n\n    printf(\"\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory allocated for all variables used in the program. On typical competitive programming platforms, the sizes of data types are standard.\n\n*   `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes.\n*   `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n\nThe variables declared in the program are:\n\n1.  `int count1;`: Stores the count of the number '1'. Memory = **4 bytes**.\n2.  `int count2;`: Stores the count of the number '2'. Memory = **4 bytes**.\n3.  `int count3;`: Stores the count of the number '3'. Memory = **4 bytes**.\n4.  `int count4;`: Stores the count of the number '4'. Memory = **4 bytes**.\n5.  `char c;`: Used to read one character at a time from the input. Memory = **1 byte**.\n6.  `char is_first_term;`: Used as a flag for printing '+' signs. Using `char` is more memory-efficient than `int`. Memory = **1 byte**.\n\nThe `while` loops for printing do not declare new counter variables (like `int i`), instead they decrement the existing `count` variables, thus consuming no additional memory.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation:**\n\nm = (4 * `sizeof(int)`) + (2 * `sizeof(char)`)\nm = (4 * 4) + (2 * 1)\nm = 16 + 2\nm = 18 bytes\n\n<<<18>>>"
