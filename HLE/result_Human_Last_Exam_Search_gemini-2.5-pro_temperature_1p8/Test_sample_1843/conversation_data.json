    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\n### 2. Properties of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi_i$ with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n\nWe need to find the number of such characters $\\chi$ for which $\\text{ord}(\\chi)=6$.\n\n### 3. Finding Primitive Characters for Each Prime Power Factor\n\nLet's analyze the possible orders of primitive characters for each prime power factor of $N$. For a character $\\chi$ to have order 6, the order of each of its components $\\chi_i$ must be a divisor of 6.\n\n*   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$):** The group of Dirichlet characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one non-principal character, which is primitive and has order 2. This order (2) divides 6. So, there is **1** choice for the character component $\\chi_{2^2}$.\n\n*   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$):** The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character modulo $3^2$ is primitive if it is not induced by a character modulo 3. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ non-primitive characters (of order 1 and 2). The remaining $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6-2=4$ characters are primitive. Their orders are the divisors of 6, excluding 1 and 2. In a cyclic group of order 6, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ elements of order 3 and $\\phi(6)=2$ elements of order 6. Both orders (3 and 6) divide 6. Thus, there are $2+2 = \\mathbf{4}$ choices for $\\chi_{3^2}$.\n\n*   **Conductor 7:** The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. A character is primitive if it is not the principal character (order 1). The possible orders are divisors of 6, other than 1.\n    *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$ character.\n    *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$ characters.\n    *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$ characters.\n    All these orders (2, 3, 6) divide 6. So, there are $1+2+2 = \\mathbf{5}$ choices for $\\chi_7$.\n\n*   **Conductor 11:** The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The orders of primitive (i.e., non-principal) characters are the divisors of 10, other than 1: 2, 5, 10. For the order of the final character $\\chi$ to be 6, the order of each component must divide 6. Of {2, 5, 10}, only 2 divides 6. The number of primitive characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2)=1$. Therefore, there is only **1** choice for $\\chi_{11}$.\n\n*   **Conductor 13:** The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. The orders of primitive characters are the divisors of 12, other than 1: 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. We only consider orders that divide 6, which are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    The total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$ is $1+2+2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n### 4. Combining the Components\n\nWe need to form a primitive character $\\chi = \\chi_{2^2}\\chi_{3^2}\\chi_7\\chi_{11}\\chi_{13}$ of order 6.\nLet the orders of the component characters be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$. Based on our analysis, the possible orders are:\n*   $o_4 = 2$\n*   $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $o_{11} = 2$\n*   $o_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nThe order of the resulting character $\\chi$ is $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$. We must check if this lcm is exactly 6 for every combination of choices.\n1.  Since all component orders divide 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\n2.  The lcm must be a multiple of the order of each component.\n    *   From $\\chi_{2^2}$, we have $o_4=2$, so the lcm is a multiple of 2.\n    *   From $\\chi_{3^2}$, we have $o_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$, which means the order is always a multiple of 3.\n3.  Since the lcm is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2, 3)=6$.\n\nCombining points 1 and 3, the order of any character formed this way is exactly 6.\n\n### 5. Final Calculation\n\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of characters = (choices for $\\chi_{2^2}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{3^2}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nNumber of characters = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n"
