    "An analysis of integral surgeries on knots with four or fewer crossings reveals that four distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented. To be an element of this group, a 3-manifold must be an integral homology sphere, a condition met by ±1 surgery on any knot. The knots with at most four crossings are the unknot, the trefoil knot, and the figure-eight knot.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the elements generated:\n\n*   **The Unknot (0 crossings):** Both +1 and -1 surgeries on the unknot yield the 3-sphere (S³). The 3-sphere represents the **trivial element** in the homology cobordism group.\n\n*   **The Trefoil Knot (3 crossings):** This knot is chiral, meaning it has a right-handed and a left-handed version.\n    *   **Right-handed trefoil:**\n        *   +1 surgery produces the **Poincaré homology sphere (Σ(2,3,5))**. This manifold has a Rokhlin invariant of 1, giving it an order of 2 in the homology cobordism group.\n        *   -1 surgery results in the **Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7)**. This element is known to have infinite order in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **Left-handed trefoil:** The surgeries on this knot produce the mirror images of the manifolds from the right-handed trefoil.\n        *   +1 surgery gives the oppositely oriented Poincaré sphere. Since the Poincaré sphere has order 2, it is its own inverse, representing the same element.\n        *   -1 surgery yields the oppositely oriented Brieskorn sphere -Σ(2,3,7). As Σ(2,3,7) has infinite order, this is a **distinct new element**, the inverse of the one from the right-handed trefoil's -1 surgery.\n\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot (4 crossings):** This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is indistinguishable from its mirror image.\n    *   +1 surgery on the figure-eight knot also results in the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7).\n    *   -1 surgery produces the Poincaré homology sphere.\n\nIn summary, the distinct elements obtained are:\n1.  The trivial element (from the unknot).\n2.  The element of order 2 (the Poincaré sphere, obtained from both the trefoil and figure-eight knots).\n3.  An element of infinite order (the Brieskorn sphere Σ(2,3,7), also from both the trefoil and figure-eight knots).\n4.  The inverse of the element of infinite order (from the left-handed trefoil).\n\nTherefore, a total of four unique elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n\n<<<4>>>"
