    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water, we must account for both the dissolution of the solid into its ions and the subsequent formation of the complex ion Al(OH)₄⁻. The overall solubility is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n\nThe relevant chemical equilibria and their constants are:\n\n1.  **Dissolution:** Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    *   K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n2.  **Complex Formation:** Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    *   K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n3.  **Water Autoionization:** H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    *   K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴\n\nThe total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the sum of the concentrations of the aqueous aluminum species:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nTo solve for the concentrations of these species, we use the principle of charge neutrality. The sum of the positive charges in the solution must equal the sum of the negative charges:\n3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\nWe can express each concentration in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻]:\n*   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   From K_w: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n*   To find an expression for [Al(OH)₄⁻], we can combine the K_sp and K_f reactions. The product K_sp × K_f gives the equilibrium constant for the reaction Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq).\n    *   K_c = K_sp × K_f = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷)(1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴\n    *   From this, [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_c × [OH⁻] = (K_sp × K_f) × [OH⁻]\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the charge balance equation yields a single equation with one unknown, [OH⁻]:\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻])\n\nSolving this equation for [OH⁻] gives a concentration of approximately 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ mol L⁻¹.\n\nNow, we can calculate the concentrations of the individual aluminum species at this hydroxide concentration:\n*   [Al³⁺] = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.43 x 10⁻⁴ mol L⁻¹\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) × (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nThe total solubility is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = (4.43 x 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 x 10⁻³) = 1.773 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, based on the provided constants.\n\nThe solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water is 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹.\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
