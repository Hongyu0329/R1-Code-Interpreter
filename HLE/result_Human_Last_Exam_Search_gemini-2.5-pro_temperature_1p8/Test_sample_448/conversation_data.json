    "In 2002, the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was radon (Rn). When considering only naturally occurring elements, radon is by far the least abundant noble gas.\n\nRadon is an extremely rare, radioactive gas. None of its isotopes are stable, with the most long-lived, radon-222, having a half-life of only 3.8 days. It is continuously formed through the radioactive decay of uranium and radium found in rocks and soil. Due to its short half-life, its concentration in the Earth's crust is minuscule, estimated at about 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram. Its atmospheric concentration is even lower.\n\nAmong the stable, non-radioactive noble gases, xenon (Xe) is the rarest. Its concentration in Earth's atmosphere is approximately 0.086 parts per million (about 9 x 10⁻⁶ %). This is significantly more abundant than radon.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the synthetic noble gas Oganesson (Og) was first created in a laboratory in 2002. As only a few atoms of Oganesson were ever synthesized, it was technically the rarest noble gas on Earth that year, though it does not occur naturally.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
