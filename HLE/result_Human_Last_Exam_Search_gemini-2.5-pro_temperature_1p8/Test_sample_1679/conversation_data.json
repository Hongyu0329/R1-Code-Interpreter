    "**\"An American in Paris\" was the First Best Picture Winner to Feature a Luxor Obelisk On-Screen**\n\nThe 1951 musical spectacle, \"An American in Paris,\" holds the distinction of being the first Academy Award winner for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk. The film features a lavish and artistically stylized ballet sequence set in a vibrant, impressionistic Paris. Within this extended dream sequence, a set representing the Place de la Concorde prominently includes the iconic Egyptian obelisk.\n\nThis cinematic representation of the Parisian landmark predates other Best Picture winners that also feature obelisks. Notably, the 1959 epic \"Ben-Hur\" depicts an obelisk in its grand Circus Maximus chariot race sequence. While this obelisk was modeled after one of the many Egyptian obelisks brought to Rome, including one from the reign of Ramesses II, \"An American in Paris\" was released and won the Best Picture Oscar eight years prior.\n\nOther Best Picture winners filmed in Paris, such as \"Gigi\" (1958) and \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956), do not feature clear depictions of the Luxor Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde based on available information. While these films showcase various Parisian locales, specific scenes capturing the famous landmark are not well-documented. Early Best Picture winners like \"Wings\" (1927), \"The Broadway Melody\" (1929), and \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930) also show no evidence of featuring a Luxor Obelisk.\n\nTherefore, with its imaginative and artistic rendering of the Place de la Concorde, \"An American in Paris\" stands as the earliest Best Picture honoree to showcase this historic monument.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
