    "I have started the investigation by searching for the functional equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. The search results indicate that this is a known problem and is related to the concept of functional square roots, specifically the \"half-exponential function\". I found a link to a MathOverflow thread discussing the existence of real-analytic solutions, and it is mentioned that a holomorphic solution does not exist. Another result points to a paper by Kneser on real analytic solutions. I also found a related question about $f(f(x)) = e^{-x}$, where it's stated that no continuous real-valued solution exists because $f(f(x))$ must be increasing if $f$ is monotonic, while $e^{-x}$ is decreasing. This suggests that for $f(f(x)) = e^x$, any continuous solution must be strictly increasing.\n\nThe key question is about the *cardinality* of the set of continuous solutions. I've also searched for the cardinality of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, which is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$ (or $2^{\\aleph_0}$). This provides an upper bound for the cardinality of the solution set.\n\nTo determine the exact cardinality, I need to understand how different solutions can be constructed. I have not yet found a direct answer to the cardinality question for $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. I need to synthesize the information about the existence of solutions with methods for constructing multiple solutions. It seems likely that if there is at least one solution, there might be a way to generate a continuum of them. I need to investigate how to construct different solutions.\n\nI will update my plan to focus on the construction of a family of solutions.I have gathered significant information about the functional equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. The key takeaways are:\n- Solutions, often called half-exponential functions, are known to exist but are not elementary.\n- There are infinitely many such solutions.\n- A method for constructing solutions involves defining the function on an interval, for example, of the form $[a, f(a)]$, and then extending it to the entire real line using the given functional equation.\n- Specifically, one can choose a strictly increasing continuous function $h: \\to [1, e^{1/2}]$ such that $h(0)=1$ and $h(1)=e^{1/2}$, and this choice determines a continuous solution $f(x)$.\n\nLet's analyze the construction method to determine the cardinality. The core of the construction lies in defining the function on a specific interval. Let's pick a convenient interval to start with. Let's define $f$ on $[0, a]$ for some $a > 0$. Then $f([0, a])$ will be an interval $[f(0), f(a)]$, and $f([f(0), f(a)])$ will be $[f(f(0)), f(f(a))]$. From $f(f(x)) = e^x$, we have $f(f(0)) = e^0 = 1$. Let's assume we can find a starting point $x_0$ such that we can build a sequence $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$ and $x_{n+2} = e^{x_n}$.\n\nA common approach is to find a fixed point for a related function or to work on specific intervals. One of the search results hints at a construction by choosing a bijection $g:[0,A] \\to [A,1]$. Let's follow a similar, but perhaps more direct, line of reasoning.\n\nAny continuous solution $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ to $f(f(x)) = e^x$ must be injective. If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, so $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$, which implies $x_1 = x_2$. For a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, being injective means it must be strictly monotonic. Since $f(f(x)) = e^x$ is strictly increasing, $f$ must also be strictly increasing. (If $f$ were decreasing, $f \\circ f$ would be increasing).\n\nLet's consider an arbitrary real number $a$. Define the sequence $x_n$ by $x_0 = a$, $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$ for $n \\ge 0$. Then we have $x_{n+2} = f(x_{n+1}) = f(f(x_n)) = e^{x_n}$. So we have the sequence: $a, f(a), e^a, e^{f(a)}, e^{e^a}, e^{e^{f(a)}}, \\dots$.\n\nLet's try to build a solution. We can define $f$ on some interval $[a, f(a)]$. Let $b=f(a)$. The values of $f$ on $[a, b]$ determine the values of $f$ on $[b, e^a]$ because for any $y \\in [b, e^a]$, there is an $x \\in [a, b]$ such that $y=f(x)$ (since $f$ is continuous and increasing), and so $f(y) = f(f(x)) = e^x$. The choice of $f$ on the initial interval seems to be quite free.\n\nLet's make this more concrete. Choose a value $a_0$. Let $a_1 = e^{a_0}$, $a_2 = e^{a_1}$, and so on. This is the sequence of tetration $e^{e^{...^{a_0}}}$. Also let $a_{-1} = \\ln(a_0)$ (if $a_0>0$), $a_{-2} = \\ln(a_{-1})$, etc. Let $I_n = [a_n, a_{n+1}]$. Then $f$ maps $I_n$ to $I_{n+1}$.\n\nLet's choose an arbitrary increasing continuous function $h_0: \\to [1, \\sqrt{e}]$ with $h_0(0)=1$ and $h_0(1)=\\sqrt{e}$.\nWe can define $f(x)$ for $x \\in$ as $f(x) = h_0(x)$.\nThen for $x \\in [1, \\sqrt{e}]$, which is the range of $f$ on $$, we must have $f(x) = \\exp(h_0^{-1}(x))$. This defines $f$ on $[0, \\sqrt{e}]$.\nWe can continue this process. Let $x_0 = 0$, $x_1 = 1$, $x_2=f(1)=\\sqrt{e}$, $x_3=f(\\sqrt{e}) = e^{1/1} = e$, $x_4=f(e) = e^{\\sqrt{e}}$, and so on. We can also go backwards. $f(x_{-1}) = 0$ implies $e^{x_{-1}}=f(0)=1$, so $x_{-1}=0$. This causes a problem.\n\nLet's try a different starting point. There exists a unique real number $\\xi$ such that $e^\\xi = \\xi$. This is not correct. But there is a number $\\alpha$ such that $\\ln(\\alpha)=\\alpha$ is not solvable in reals. Let's think about a fixed point. If $f$ had a fixed point $c$, then $f(c)=c$, so $f(f(c))=f(c)=c$. Then $c = e^c$. The function $g(x) = e^x-x$ has no real roots (its minimum is at $x=0$, where $g(0)=1$). Thus, $f$ has no fixed points.\n\nSo for any $x$, we have $f(x) \\neq x$. Since $f$ is continuous, either $f(x)>x$ for all $x$ or $f(x)<x$ for all $x$.\nIf $f(x)<x$ for all $x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. But $f(f(x))=e^x$, so $e^x < x$, which is never true.\nSo we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.\n\nNow, let's go back to the construction on an interval.\nLet's define $f$ on an interval of the form $[x_0, f(x_0)]$. The issue is that we don't know $f(x_0)$ a priori.\n\nLet's try a different way. Pick any $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Define the sequence $x_{2n} = \\text{exp}^n(x_0)$ and $x_{2n+1} = \\text{exp}^n(f(x_0))$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (where $\\text{exp}^{-1} = \\ln$ and $\\text{exp}^0(x)=x$).\nThe whole real line is the union of the intervals $[x_n, x_{n+1}]$.\nTo define a solution $f$, we can choose an arbitrary strictly increasing continuous function $h: [x_0, f(x_0)] \\to [f(x_0), e^{x_0}]$.\nThis still seems to depend on the unknown $f(x_0)$.\n\nLet's consider a fixed interval, say $$.\nDefine an arbitrary strictly increasing continuous function $\\phi: \\to [f(0), f(1)]$. We have $f(f(0))=1$ and $f(f(1))=e$.\nThis seems complicated.\n\nLet's try to simplify the construction idea from the search results.\nLet's choose a continuous, strictly increasing function $g: [a, b] \\to [b, e^a]$ where $b=f(a)$.\nThis is the same issue.\n\nLet's try the idea of choosing a bijection over a certain range more carefully.\nLet $a_0 = 1, a_1 = e, a_2 = e^e, \\dots, a_{n+1} = e^{a_n}$. Also, $a_{-1} = \\ln(1)=0, a_{-2}=\\ln(0)$ is undefined. So let's start with a value for which we can go backwards. But $e^x>0$, so $f(f(x))>0$ for all $x$. This means $f$ must map to the domain of $f$, which in turn must allow the output of $e^x$. The range of $f$ must be a subset of its domain. Also, the range of $e^x$ is $(0, \\infty)$, so $f(f(\\mathbb{R})) = (0, \\infty)$. This implies that the range of $f$ must be some interval $(c, \\infty)$ where $f((c, \\infty))=(0, \\infty)$. This implies $c \\ge -\\infty$.\n\nLet's consider the construction on $[x_0, e^{x_0}]$.\nLet's pick an arbitrary $x_0$. Let's pick an arbitrary $y_0 > x_0$. Let $f(x_0)=y_0$. Then $f(y_0)=e^{x_0}$.\nNow, we have specified $f$ at two points.\nLet's define $f$ on the interval $[x_0, y_0]$.\nLet $\\phi: [x_0, y_0] \\to [y_0, e^{x_0}]$ be an arbitrary strictly increasing continuous function such that $\\phi(x_0)=y_0$ and $\\phi(y_0)=e^{x_0}$.\nLet's define $f(x) = \\phi(x)$ for $x \\in [x_0, y_0]$.\nThen for $x \\in [y_0, e^{x_0}]$, we define $f(x) = e^{\\phi^{-1}(x)}$.\nThis defines $f$ on $[x_0, e^{x_0}]$. We have defined $f$ on $[x_0, y_0] \\cup [y_0, e^{x_0}] = [x_0, e^{x_0}]$.\nIs this function continuous? By construction, $\\lim_{x \\to y_0^-} f(x) = \\phi(y_0) = e^{x_0}$ and $f(y_0) = e^{\\phi^{-1}(y_0)} = e^{x_0}$. So it is continuous at $y_0$.\nLet's check the functional equation. If $x \\in [x_0, y_0]$, then $f(x) = \\phi(x) \\in [y_0, e^{x_0}]$. So $f(f(x)) = f(\\phi(x)) = e^{\\phi^{-1}(\\phi(x))} = e^x$. This works.\nThis process can be continued by defining $f$ on $[e^{x_0}, e^{y_0}]$, and so on, and also on the preimages.\n\nThe construction of a solution is determined by the choice of the function $\\phi$.\n$\\phi$ is a strictly increasing continuous function from $[x_0, y_0]$ to $[y_0, e^{x_0}]$ with fixed endpoints.\nLet's normalize the intervals. Let $x_0=0, y_0=1$. Then $e^{x_0}=1$. The interval for $\\phi$ is $$ and the target is $$. This means $\\phi(x)=1$ for all $x \\in$, which is not strictly increasing. This choice of $x_0=0, y_0=1$ fails.\n\nWe need $y_0 < e^{x_0}$.\nSince $f(x)>x$, we must have $y_0 = f(x_0) > x_0$.\nAlso $f(y_0)=e^{x_0}$. We must have $f(y_0)>y_0$, so $e^{x_0} > y_0$.\nSo, for any choice of $x_0$, we must choose $y_0$ such that $x_0 < y_0 < e^{x_0}$.\nFor any such choice of $(x_0, y_0)$, we can choose an arbitrary strictly increasing continuous function $\\phi$ from $[x_0, y_0]$ to $[y_0, e^{x_0}]$.\nLet $C[I]$ be the set of continuous functions on an interval $I$.\nThe set of solutions is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of such functions $\\phi$.\nHow many such functions $\\phi$ are there?\nLet's fix $x_0=0$. We can choose any $y_0 \\in (0, 1)$. For each such $y_0$, we need to choose a strictly increasing continuous function $\\phi: [0, y_0] \\to [y_0, 1]$.\nLet's re-normalize. Let $g(t) = \\frac{\\phi(y_0 t) - y_0}{1-y_0}$ for $t \\in$.\nThen $g(0)=0, g(1)=1$. $g$ is a strictly increasing continuous function from $$ to $$.\nThe set of such functions $g$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum). We can see this because any such $g$ is determined by its values on the rationals in $$. And there are $\\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$ such choices. A simpler way to see this is to consider functions of the form $g(x) = x^a$ for $a>0$, which gives a family of cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Another way is to pick a point $t \\in (0,1)$ and map it to any $s \\in (0,1)$ and then connect the points with straight lines, e.g., $g(x) = \\frac{s}{t}x$ for $x\\in[0,t]$ and $g(x) = \\frac{1-s}{1-t}(x-t)+s$ for $x \\in [t,1]$. The choice of $s$ for a fixed $t$ gives $\\mathfrak{c}$ possibilities.\n\nSo, for a fixed pair $(x_0, y_0)$, there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ ways to define $\\phi$.\nAlso, there are continuum many choices for $y_0 \\in (x_0, e^{x_0})$.\nThe total number of solutions is therefore at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\nThe set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. A continuous function is uniquely determined by its values on the dense set of rational numbers. So the cardinality is $|\\mathbb{R}^{Q}| = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\nSince the set of solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions, its cardinality is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\nWe have found at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions.\nBy the Cantor-Bernstein theorem, the cardinality of the set of solutions is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe construction can be summarized as:\n1.  Choose any real number $x_0$.\n2.  Choose any real number $y_0$ such that $x_0 < y_0 < e^{x_0}$.\n3.  Choose any strictly increasing continuous function $\\phi: [x_0, y_0] \\to [y_0, e^{x_0}]$.\n4.  Define $f$ on $[x_0, y_0]$ as $f(x) = \\phi(x)$.\n5.  Extend the definition of $f$ to the rest of $\\mathbb{R}$ using the relation $f(f(x)) = e^x$. The domain of definition can be extended to intervals $[y_0, e^{x_0}]$, $[e^{x_0}, e^{y_0}]$, etc., and also backwards to preimages. For instance, for $z \\in [y_0, e^{x_0}]$, we can find a unique $x \\in [x_0, y_0]$ such that $\\phi(x)=z$, i.e. $x = \\phi^{-1}(z)$, and we must define $f(z) = e^x = e^{\\phi^{-1}(z)}$.\n\nThis construction generates a large family of solutions. We have established that for any fixed $x_0$ and $y_0$, the set of choices for $\\phi$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\nLet's verify this claim. Let $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ be two different such functions. Do they lead to different solutions $f_1$ and $f_2$? Yes, because they differ on the interval $[x_0, y_0]$ by definition.\n\nSo, the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\nThe search results confirm that there are infinitely many solutions and provide the general idea for their construction. The key step is that a continuous strictly increasing function can be chosen with a certain degree of freedom on an initial interval, and this choice then determines the rest of the function. This freedom of choice is what leads to the large number of solutions. The number of ways to choose a strictly increasing continuous function between fixed endpoints is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of real numbers, $|\\mathbb{R}|$, is denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$.\nThe set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\nThe construction outlined shows at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions.\nThe cardinality is therefore $\\mathfrak{c}$.\nI am now confident in this answer.\nFinal check of the reasoning:\n1. Any solution $f$ must be continuous and strictly increasing, with $f(x)>x$.\n2. We fix a point $x_0$. We must choose $y_0=f(x_0)$ such that $x_0 < y_0 < e^{x_0}$. Let's fix $x_0=0$, we can choose any $y_0 \\in (0, 1)$.\n3. For each such choice, we must define $f$ on $[0, y_0]$ as a strictly increasing continuous function from $[0, y_0]$ to $[y_0, 1]$.\n4. The number of such functions is the cardinality of the continuum. A simple way to see this is to note that for any $c \\in (y_0, 1)$, we can demand that $f(y_0/2)=c$. The number of choices for $c$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n5. Each of these choices leads to a unique solution for $f$.\n6. Therefore, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions.\n7. The total number of continuous functions is $\\mathfrak{c}$, so there can be at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ solutions.\n8. By Cantor-Bernstein, the cardinality is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe argument is sound.The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\nFirst, let's establish some properties of any such function $f$.\n1.  **Injectivity**: If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Thus, $f$ is an injective function.\n2.  **Monotonicity**: A continuous injective function on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic.\n3.  **Increasing**: If $f$ were strictly decreasing, then $f \\circ f$ would be strictly increasing. The function $\\exp(x)$ is strictly increasing, so this is consistent. However, if $f$ is strictly decreasing, it must have a unique fixed point $c$, i.e., $f(c)=c$. Then $f(f(c)) = f(c) = c$. From the given equation, we would have $\\exp(c) = c$. However, the equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions (the function $g(x) = e^x - x$ has a minimum value of 1 at $x=0$). Therefore, $f$ cannot have a fixed point and cannot be strictly decreasing. Thus, $f$ must be a strictly increasing function.\n4.  **No fixed points**: As shown above, $f$ cannot have any fixed points. Since $f$ is continuous, this means either $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$, then $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. But $f(f(x)) = e^x$, so this would mean $e^x < x$, which is never true. Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNow, let's consider the construction of such functions. This construction demonstrates that there is a large degree of freedom in choosing $f$, which will allow us to determine the cardinality of the set of solutions.\n\nThe construction proceeds as follows:\n1.  Choose an arbitrary real number $x_0$.\n2.  Choose a value for $f(x_0)$. Let's call it $y_0$. According to the property $f(x) > x$, we must have $y_0 > x_0$.\n3.  From the original equation, we have $f(y_0) = f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$. The property $f(x) > x$ also applies to $y_0$, so we must have $f(y_0) > y_0$, which means $\\exp(x_0) > y_0$.\n4.  So, for any chosen $x_0$, we are free to choose any $y_0$ such that $x_0 < y_0 < \\exp(x_0)$.\n\nLet's fix $x_0=0$. Then we can choose any $y_0$ such that $0 < y_0 < e^0 = 1$. Let's fix one such $y_0$, for instance $y_0=1/2$.\nWe have $f(0) = 1/2$ and $f(1/2) = e^0 = 1$.\n\nNow, we define $f(x)$ for $x \\in [0, 1/2]$. Since $f$ must be continuous and strictly increasing, we need to define $f$ as a continuous and strictly increasing function that maps the interval $[0, 1/2]$ to the interval $[f(0), f(1/2)] = [1/2, 1]$.\n\nThe core of the argument lies in the number of ways one can choose this function. Let's call this piece of the function $\\phi: [0, 1/2] \\to [1/2, 1]$. Any continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi$ with $\\phi(0) = 1/2$ and $\\phi(1/2) = 1$ will work for this segment.\n\nOnce $\\phi$ is chosen for the interval $[0, 1/2]$, the function $f$ is uniquely determined for all real numbers through the relation $f(f(x)) = e^x$. For instance:\n*   For $x \\in [1/2, 1]$, $x$ is in the range of $\\phi$. So, there's a unique $u \\in [0, 1/2]$ such that $x = \\phi(u)$. We must define $f(x) = f(\\phi(u)) = f(f(u)) = e^u = e^{\\phi^{-1}(x)}$.\n*   This process can be continued to define $f$ over the entire real line.\n\nThe number of solutions to the functional equation is therefore the number of possible choices for the initial function $\\phi$. The set of such functions $\\phi$ is the set of all strictly increasing continuous functions from $[0, 1/2]$ to $[1/2, 1]$.\n\nTo determine the cardinality of this set of functions, consider that for any number $c$ in the interval $(1/2, 1)$, we can require that our function $\\phi$ passes through the point $(1/4, c)$. This choice is arbitrary, and for each choice of $c$, we can construct a valid strictly increasing continuous function (for instance, by connecting the points with two straight lines). Since there is a continuum of choices for $c$ (the cardinality of $(1/2, 1)$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the real numbers), there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions $\\phi$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We have shown that the cardinality of $S$, denoted $|S|$, is at least $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nNow we need an upper bound for $|S|$. The set $S$ is a subset of the set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, let's call it $C(\\mathbb{R})$. It is a known result in set theory that the cardinality of $C(\\mathbb{R})$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$. This is because a continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ is uniquely determined by its values on a dense subset, such as the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The cardinality of $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, $|C(\\mathbb{R})| = |\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{Q}}| = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nSince $S \\subseteq C(\\mathbb{R})$, we have $|S| \\le |C(\\mathbb{R})| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nWe have shown that $|S| \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$ and $|S| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$. By the Cantor-Bernstein theorem, the cardinality of the set of solutions is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$ (also denoted as $2^{\\aleph_0}$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$).>>>"
