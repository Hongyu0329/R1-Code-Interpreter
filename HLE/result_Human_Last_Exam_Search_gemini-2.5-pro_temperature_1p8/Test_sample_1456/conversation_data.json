    "By a continuum, we mean a compact connected metric space, and a nondegenerate continuum is one that consists of more than one point. The question asks for the largest possible number of a specific type of subset called a composant in the product of two such spaces.\n\nFirst, it's important to understand the nature of a composant. In a continuum, the composant of a point *p* is the set of all points *q* for which there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both *p* and *q*. The number of a continuum's composants is closely tied to whether the continuum is decomposable or indecomposable.\n\n*   A **decomposable continuum** can be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. All decomposable continua have exactly one composant.\n*   An **indecomposable continuum** cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua. It is these indecomposable continua that can possess more than one composant.\n\nThe product of two continua, X and Y, results in a new space, X × Y, which is also a continuum. The number of composants in this product space depends on its own properties of decomposability.\n\nTo find the *largest possible number* of composants, we must consider the case where the product space X × Y is indecomposable. If X and Y are themselves chosen to be indecomposable continua, their product X × Y is also indecomposable.\n\nFor any nondegenerate *metric* indecomposable continuum, a fundamental theorem by the mathematician Stefan Mazurkiewicz states that it has precisely **c** (the cardinality of the continuum, equivalent to the number of points on the real line, 2<sup>ℵ₀</sup>) composants. These composants are disjoint and their union is the entire space.\n\nTherefore, by selecting two nondegenerate indecomposable metric continua (such as two copies of the Knaster \"bucket-handle\" continuum), their product will be a nondegenerate indecomposable metric continuum. As such, it will have **c** composants. The number of a composants of a metric space cannot exceed **c**, so this represents the maximum possible number.\n\nIn summary:\n1.  The product of two nondegenerate continua is a nondegenerate continuum.\n2.  To maximize the number of a composants, this product continuum must be indecomposable.\n3.  Choosing two indecomposable continua as the factors ensures their product is also indecomposable.\n4.  A metric indecomposable continuum has **c** composants.\n\nThus, the largest possible number of a composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua is **c**.\n\n<<<c>>>"
