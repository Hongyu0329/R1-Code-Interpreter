    "To date, there are 10 identified mature members of the let-7 family in humans. This family of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and is highly conserved across many species.\n\nThe 10 mature let-7 miRNAs are:\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n*   miR-98\n*   miR-202\n\nIt is important to note that these mature miRNAs originate from 13 different precursor genes located on various chromosomes. For instance, the mature let-7a sequence is produced from three distinct genomic loci (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, and let-7a-3). This distinction between the number of mature sequences and the number of precursor genes is the reason why different sources may cite varying numbers of let-7 family members, with some reporting 9, 12, or 13 members. However, the most frequently cited and recent count for unique mature let-7 sequences is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
