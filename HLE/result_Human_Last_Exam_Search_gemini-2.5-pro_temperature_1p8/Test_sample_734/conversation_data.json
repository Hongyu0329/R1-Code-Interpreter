    "### No Single Theologian Developed a Unified Terminology for Both Doctrines\n\nBased on extensive research, there is no evidence to suggest that a single Christian theologian first developed a specialized, unified terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall.\n\nTheological discourse has historically treated these two events as distinct categories, employing different sets of terminology for each. Events such as the virgin birth are generally categorized as miracles and are described using broad terms like \"divine intervention,\" \"supernatural\" acts, or a \"suspension\" or \"violation\" of the \"laws of nature\". This terminology is not exclusive to the virgin birth but is applied to all miracles. For instance, early Church Fathers and later scholastic theologians like Thomas Aquinas would speak of such events as being \"above\" or \"contrary to\" nature (\"contra naturam\").\n\nIn contrast, the theological exploration of the consequences of the Fall on the natural world has produced its own specific lexicon. Terms such as \"lapsarianism\"—which includes the concepts of \"supralapsarianism\" (God's decrees before the Fall) and \"infralapsarianism\" (God's decrees after the Fall)—were developed to order the divine decrees concerning the Fall and salvation. Additionally, some modern theologians have discussed a \"meta-historical fall,\" referring to an event outside of empirical history that affects all of creation. This language is specific to the theological debates surrounding sin, salvation, and the nature of creation after the Fall and is not used to describe the mechanics of specific miracles.\n\nWhile the 17th-century philosopher and scientist René Descartes was instrumental in formalizing the modern concept of the \"laws of nature\" as immutable decrees of God, there is no indication that he applied this framework to create a specialized terminology that would encompass both the virgin birth and the consequences of the Fall.\n\nIn conclusion, the Christian theological tradition has addressed the virgin birth and the Fall's impact on nature as separate issues with distinct terminological frameworks. A unified, specialized vocabulary developed by a single theologian to explain the mechanics of altered natural laws in both these contexts does not appear in the historical record.\n\n<<<No single Christian theologian is credited with developing such a unified terminology.>>>"
