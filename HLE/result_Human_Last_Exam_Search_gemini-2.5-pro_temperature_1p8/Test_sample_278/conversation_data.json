    "The curve is defined in two parts.\n\n**Part 1: For $t\\in[0,\\pi]$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\nThis corresponds to the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin.\nFor this part, the range of x-values is $[\\cos(\\pi), \\cos(0)] = [-1, 1]$.\nThe range of y-values is $[\\sin(0), \\sin(\\pi/2)] =$.\n\n**Part 2: For $t\\in(\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\nThis corresponds to the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\nFor this part, the range of x-values is $(\\cos(2\\pi), \\cos(\\pi)) = (-1, 1)$, but considering the endpoints for the full range, it is $[-1, 1]$.\nThe range of y-values is $[5\\sin(3\\pi/2), 5\\sin(\\pi)) = [-5, 0)$.\n\n**Combining both parts:**\nTo find the bounding box for the entire figure, we take the union of the ranges for $x$ and $y$.\n-   The total range for $x$ is $[-1, 1] \\cup [-1, 1] = [-1, 1]$.

The height of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values, which is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6.\nThe smallest square that can enclose this rectangle must have a side length equal to the maximum of its dimensions.\nSide length of the smallest enclosing square = $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nThe area of this square is the side length squared.\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>The curve is defined in two parts.\n\n**Part 1: For $t\\in[0,\\pi]$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\nThis corresponds to the upper half of a unit circle centered at the origin.\nFor this part, the range of x-values is $[\\cos(\\pi), \\cos(0)] = [-1, 1]$.\nThe range of y-values is $[\\sin(0), \\sin(\\pi/2)] = [0, 1]$.\n\n**Part 2: For $t\\in(\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nThe parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\nThis corresponds to the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal semi-axis of 1 and a vertical semi-axis of 5.\nFor this part, the range of x-values is $(\\cos(2\\pi), \\cos(\\pi)) = (-1, 1)$, but considering the endpoints for the full range, it is $[-1, 1]$.\nThe range of y-values is $[5\\sin(3\\pi/2), 5\\sin(\\pi)) = [-5, 0)$.\n\n**Combining both parts:**\nTo find the bounding box for the entire figure, we take the union of the ranges for $x$ and $y$.\n-   The total range for $x$ is $[-1, 1] \\cup [-1, 1] = [-1, 1]$.
