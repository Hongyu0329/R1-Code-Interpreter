The laboratory's mistake was in trusting a flawed quality control (QC) procedure. Their QC test, which used only a bacterium (*Bacillus subtilis*) on a medium designed to inhibit it, gave a misleading result of "no growth." This test could not differentiate between an effective antibiotic (Batches 1 and 2) and an ineffective one (Batch 3). The root cause was that the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being improperly autoclaved with the agar, a procedural error that the flawed QC check failed to detect.
