    "Let the first cube, C1, be the set of points (x, y, z) such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ z ≤ 1. The main diagonal of this cube connects the origin (0, 0, 0) to the point (1, 1, 1).\n\nThe second cube, C2, is shifted by 1/2 along this main diagonal. This corresponds to a translation by the vector (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Therefore, the coordinates of C2 are defined by the inequalities:\n*   1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n*   1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n*   1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nThe volume of the intersection of these two cubes is the region where the coordinates satisfy the conditions for both C1 and C2. When cubes are aligned with the axes, the intersection is found by determining the overlapping range for each coordinate separately.\n\nFor the x-coordinate, the point must be in both and [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection of these two intervals is [1/2, 1].\n*   Length of the intersection in the x-direction: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, for the y-coordinate, the point must be in both and [1/2, 3/2], which gives the interval [1/2, 1].\n*   Length of the intersection in the y-direction: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nAnd for the z-coordinate, the interval is also [1/2, 1].\n*   Length of the intersection in the z-direction: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.\n\nThe intersection is itself a cube with a side length of 1/2. The volume of this intersection is the product of these lengths.\n\nVolume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
