    "To find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a full Configuration Interaction (CI) calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set, we need to determine the number of electrons and the number of basis functions (molecular orbitals).\n\n### 1. Number of Electrons (N)\n\nFirst, we sum the electrons for each atom in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 6 electrons\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 atoms × 1 electron/atom = 2 electrons\n*   **Silicon (Si):** 14 electrons\n*   **Fluorine (F):** 9 electrons\n\nThe total number of electrons is N = 6 + 2 + 14 + 9 = 31. Since this is an odd number of electrons, the molecule is a radical, and its ground state is a doublet with a total spin S = 1/2.\n\n### 2. Number of Basis Functions (M)\n\nNext, we determine the number of basis functions for each atom using the 6-31G** basis set. The `**` notation indicates that polarization functions are added to both heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms (d-functions) and hydrogen atoms (p-functions).\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The 6-31G basis provides two functions for the 1s orbital. The `**` adds a set of three p-type polarization functions (p_x, p_y, p_z). Thus, each hydrogen atom has 2 + 3 = 5 basis functions. For two H atoms, this is a total of 10 basis functions.\n*   **Carbon (C) and Fluorine (F):** For second-row atoms, the 6-31G basis set consists of 9 functions. The `*` adds a set of six d-type Cartesian polarization functions. So, each of these atoms contributes 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n*   **Silicon (Si):** As a third-row atom, the 6-31G basis provides 13 functions. The `*` adds a set of six d-type polarization functions, resulting in 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n\nThe total number of basis functions (which corresponds to the number of molecular orbitals, M) is:\nM = (2 × 5) + 15 + 15 + 19 = 59 basis functions.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Number of CSFs\n\nThe number of CSFs for a system with N electrons, M orbitals, and total spin S can be calculated. For a doublet state (S=1/2), we first determine the number of alpha (spin-up) and beta (spin-down) electrons.\n*   n_α + n_β = N = 31\n*   (n_α - n_β) / 2 = S = 1/2  => n_α - n_β = 1\n\nSolving these equations gives n_α = 16 and n_β = 15.\n\nThe number of CSFs is the number of ways to arrange the alpha electrons in the M orbitals and the beta electrons in the M orbitals, while maintaining the correct total spin. This is given by the formula:\nNumber of CSFs = `(M choose n_α) * (M choose n_β) - (M choose n_α + 1) * (M choose n_β - 1)`\n\nPlugging in the values M=59, n_α=16, and n_β=15:\nNumber of CSFs = `(59 choose 16) * (59 choose 15) - (59 choose 17) * (59 choose 14)`\n\nUsing a calculator for the binomial coefficients:\n*   C(59, 14) ≈ 9.07 × 10¹¹\n*   C(59, 15) ≈ 2.72 × 10¹²\n*   C(59, 16) ≈ 7.49 × 10¹²\n*   C(59, 17) ≈ 1.88 × 10¹³\n\nCalculating the two terms:\n*   `C(59, 16) * C(59, 15)` ≈ (7.49 × 10¹²) × (2.72 × 10¹²) ≈ 2.038 × 10²⁵\n*   `C(59, 17) * C(59, 14)` ≈ (1.88 × 10¹³) × (9.07 × 10¹¹) ≈ 1.705 × 10²⁵\n\nThe final number of CSFs is the difference:\nNumber of CSFs ≈ 2.038 × 10²⁵ - 1.705 × 10²⁵ = 3.33 × 10²⁴\n\nThis extremely large number highlights why full CI calculations are only feasible for very small molecules with small basis sets.\n\n<<<3.33e+24>>>"
