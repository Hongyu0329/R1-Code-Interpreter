    "The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is its convex hull. The convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 triangular faces.\n\nThe process of triangulating a surface involves dividing it into a set of non-overlapping triangles. Since the surface of the convex hull (the regular icosahedron) is already composed of 20 triangles, the most straightforward and minimal triangulation is the set of these 20 faces themselves. Any further subdivision of these triangles would result in a greater number of triangles.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
