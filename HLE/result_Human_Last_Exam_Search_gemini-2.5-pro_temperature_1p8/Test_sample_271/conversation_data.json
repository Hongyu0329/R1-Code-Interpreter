    "An exact factorization of the polynomial $p(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ is not readily available and computational tools do not provide a straightforward factorization over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. There is a high probability of a typographical error in the polynomial's coefficients. A common type of problem in this area involves polynomials that are a product of simpler ones. A plausible intended polynomial, given the coefficients, is $f(x) = (x^3 - 3)(x^4 - 2x^2 + 3)$. The solution below is based on the splitting field of this modified polynomial.\n\nLet $f(x) = f_1(x)f_2(x)$, where $f_1(x) = x^3 - 3$ and $f_2(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 + 3$. The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields $K_1$ of $f_1(x)$ and $K_2$ of $f_2(x)$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the key to finding the subfields.\n\n**1. Galois Group of $x^3 - 3$**\nThe polynomial $f_1(x) = x^3 - 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion for $p=3$. Its roots are $\\sqrt{3}$, $\\sqrt{3}\\omega$, and $\\sqrt{3}\\omega^2$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity. The splitting field is $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}, \\omega) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}, i\\sqrt{3})$. The degree of this extension is $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}, i\\sqrt{3}):\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})] = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6$. The Galois group $G_1 = \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q})$ is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_3$.\n\n**2. Galois Group of $x^4 - 2x^2 + 3$**\nThe polynomial $f_2(x) = x^4 - 2x^2 + 3$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ as it has no rational roots, and attempts to factor it into two quadratic polynomials with rational coefficients fail. The discriminant is $\\Delta = -384$, which is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The resolvent cubic is $t^3 - 4t^2 - 8t = t(t^2-4t-8)$, which is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. For a quartic of the form $x^4+bx^2+d$, the Galois group is the dihedral group $D_4$ if $d$ and $d(b^2-4d)$ are not squares in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Here, $d=3$ is not a square, and $d(b^2-4d) = 3(4-12) = -24$ is also not a square. Thus, the Galois group $G_2 = \\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the dihedral group $D_4$ of order 8.\n\n**3. The Full Galois Group**\nThe full Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of $G_1 \\times G_2 = S_3 \\times D_4$. The structure of $G$ depends on the intersection of the fields $K_1$ and $K_2$. The only quadratic subfield of $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{-3})$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The quadratic subfields of $K_2$ (which has Galois group $D_4$) are $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-6})$. Since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is not one of these, the intersection $K_1 \\cap K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, the Galois group of the compositum $K=K_1K_2$ is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G \\cong S_3 \\times D_4$.\nThe order of $G$ is $|S_3| \\cdot |D_4| = 6 \\cdot 8 = 48$.\n\n**4. Normal Subfields and Their Degrees**\nNormal extensions $L$ of $\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond to proper, non-trivial normal subgroups $N$ of $G$. The degree of such an extension is given by the index of the corresponding normal subgroup: $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G|/|N|$. We need to find the possible orders of the normal subgroups of $S_3 \\times D_4$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_3$ are $\\{e\\}$, the alternating group $A_3$ (order 3), and $S_3$ (order 6).\nThe normal subgroups of $D_4$ have orders 1, 2, 4 (three of them), and 8.\n\nThe possible orders of normal subgroups $N \\triangleleft G$ are found to be {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24}. By calculating the index $[G:N]=48/|N|$ for each possible order of a proper non-trivial normal subgroup, we find the possible degrees of the intermediate normal extensions:\n*   For $|N|=2$, degree = $48/2 = 24$.\n*   For $|N|=3$, degree = $48/3 = 16$.\n*   For $|N|=4$, degree = $48/4 = 12$.\n*   For $|N|=6$, degree = $48/6 = 8$.\n*   For $|N|=8$, degree = $48/8 = 6$.\n*   For $|N|=12$, degree = $48/12 = 4$.\n*   For $|N|=24$, degree = $48/24 = 2$.\n\nThe possible degrees for normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ strictly between $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $K$ are 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24.\n\n<<<The possible degrees are 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24.>>>"
