    "The musical note that corresponds to the range between the colour produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself on Newton's colour circle is G.\n\nWhen yellow and blue pigments are mixed, the resulting colour is green. Sir Isaac Newton, in his work \"Opticks,\" created a colour circle where he associated the colours of the visible spectrum with the notes of a musical scale. The seven colours he identified were red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.\n\nNewton mapped these colours to the notes of a Dorian musical mode starting on the note D. In this system, the primary colours familiar to painters (red, yellow, and blue) correspond to the primary triad of the D scale. Following the progression of the spectrum and the musical scale, the mapping is as follows:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   Green - G\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nThe question asks for the note corresponding to the range between green (the combination of yellow and blue) and blue. On Newton's circle, the colour green is directly associated with the musical note G. This note represents the segment of the circle designated as green, which lies between yellow and blue in the spectral order.\n\n<<<G>>>"
