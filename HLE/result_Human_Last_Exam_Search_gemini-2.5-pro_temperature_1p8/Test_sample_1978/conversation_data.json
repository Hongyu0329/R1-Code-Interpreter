    "To find the index of the considered boundary-value problem, we first need to understand the structure of the system and its constraints.\n\nThe problem is defined by a system of linear ordinary differential equations and a set of boundary conditions. The index of such a linear boundary-value problem, which can be described by a Fredholm operator, is given by the formula:\n\nIndex = *n* - *m*\n\nwhere:\n*   ***n*** is the number of first-order differential equations in the system.\n*   ***m*** is the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n\n**1. Determining the number of equations (n):**\n\nThe state vector is given as  $x(t) = (x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), x_{3}(t), ..., x_{2024}(t))$. This indicates that the system consists of 2024 separate, first-order differential equations. The definition of the matrix A and vector I(t) up to 202,000 components does not alter the fact that the problem, as defined by the state vector x(t) and the boundary conditions, is a 2024-dimensional system.\nTherefore, **n = 2024**.\n\n**2. Determining the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (m):**\n\nWe must analyze the given boundary conditions to identify how many of them are unique and not simply restatements of others.\n\nThe given conditions are:\n1.  $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$\n2.  $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n3.  $5x_{2}(T) - 5x_{2}(0) = 0$, which is 5 times the second condition.\n4.  $100x_{2}(T) - 100x_{2}(0) = 0$, which is 100 times the second condition.\n5.  $1000 x_{2}(0) - 1000 x_{2}(T) = 0$, which is -1000 times the second condition.\n6.  $100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0$, which simplifies to $x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0$.\n\nCounting the linearly independent conditions:\n*   There is one condition for $x_1(t)$.\n*   Conditions 2, 3, 4, and 5 all represent the same single constraint on $x_2(t)$: $x_2(T) = x_2(0)$. Therefore, they contribute only one independent condition.\n*   There is one condition for $x_{2024}(t)$.\n*   There are no conditions for the components $x_3(t)$ through $x_{2023}(t)$.\n\nSo, the total number of linearly independent boundary conditions is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\nTherefore, **m = 3**.\n\n**3. Calculating the Index:**\n\nUsing the formula Index = n - m:\nIndex = 2024 - 3 = 2021\n\n<<<2021>>>"
