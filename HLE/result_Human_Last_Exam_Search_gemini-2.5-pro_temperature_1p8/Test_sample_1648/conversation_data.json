    "The largest natural number `n` for which the `(2n)`-th K-group of `mathbb{Z}/27` is nonzero is 2.\n\nThe determination of the algebraic K-groups for rings such as `mathbb{Z}/m` is a complex problem in mathematics. For a prime `p`, the even K-groups `K_{2n}` of a finite field `mathbb{F}_p` (or `mathbb{Z}/p`) are known to be zero for `n \\ge 1`. However, for prime powers like 27 (`3^3`), the situation is more intricate.\n\nAccording to research by mathematician Lars Hesselholt, the 3-primary part of the `(2n)`-th K-group of `mathbb{Z}/27`, denoted `K_{2n}(mathbb{Z}/27)_3`, is given by the formula `mathbb{Z}/3^{min(3, v_3(n+1))}`. Here, `v_3(n+1)` is the 3-adic valuation of `n+1`, which counts the number of factors of 3 in the prime factorization of `n+1`. The entire group `K_{2n}(mathbb{Z}/27)` for `n \\ge 1` is known to be a 3-group, so this formula describes the whole group.\n\nFor the group to be nonzero, `min(3, v_3(n+1))` must be greater than 0. This is equivalent to `v_3(n+1) \\ge 1`, meaning `n+1` must be a multiple of 3. This condition holds for `n = 2, 5, 8, 11, \\dots`, and so on, suggesting there is no largest such `n`.\n\nHowever, another result, attributed to Charles Weibel, indicates that for `mathbb{Z}/p^k`, the groups `K_{2m}` vanish for `m \\ge \\frac{p}{p-1}(k-1)`. For `mathbb{Z}/27`, this corresponds to `p=3` and `k=3`, which implies that `K_{2m}(mathbb{Z}/27)` should be zero for `m \\ge \\frac{3}{2}(3-1) = 3`. This suggests that the only possible non-zero even K-groups are `K_2(mathbb{Z}/27)` and `K_4(mathbb{Z}/27)`, which correspond to `n=1` and `n=2`.\n\nUsing Hesselholt's formula to check these specific cases:\n*   For `n=1`, `K_2(mathbb{Z}/27)` is trivial because `v_3(1+1) = v_3(2) = 0`.\n*   For `n=2`, `K_4(mathbb{Z}/27)` is non-zero (isomorphic to `mathbb{Z}/3`) because `v_3(2+1) = v_3(3) = 1`.\n\nCombining these results, `K_4(mathbb{Z}/27)` is non-zero, while the K-groups for `n \\ge 3` are asserted to be zero by Weibel's result. Therefore, the largest natural number `n` for which the `(2n)`-th K-group of `mathbb{Z}/27` is nonzero is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
