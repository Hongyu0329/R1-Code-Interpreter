The normalised density of the invariant measure for the given map is the unique function $\rho(x)$ on $[0,1)$ that is a solution to the functional equation $\rho(y) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{2\rho\left(\frac{1}{(y+k)^2}\right)}{(y+k)^3}$ and satisfies the normalisation condition $\int_0^1 \rho(x) dx = 1$. There is no known expression for this function in terms of elementary functions.
