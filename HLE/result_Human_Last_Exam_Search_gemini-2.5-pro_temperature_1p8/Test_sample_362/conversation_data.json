    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that transforms aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. It involves the reaction of a carbonyl compound with a triphenyl phosphonium ylide, commonly known as a Wittig reagent. A key advantage of this method is that the new carbon-carbon double bond forms specifically at the location of the original carbonyl group.\n\nThe reactants in this specific case are:\n*   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. The ylide is the reactive species, which is a molecule with opposite charges on adjacent atoms. The structure of this ylide is (C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄)-2-Cl.\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde's carbonyl group is exchanged with the carbon group of the ylide. The reaction proceeds through a four-membered ring intermediate called an oxaphosphetane, which then breaks down to yield the final alkene product and triphenylphosphine oxide ((C₆H₅)₃P=O).\n\nFollowing this mechanism, the pivalaldehyde ((CH₃)₃C-CHO) reacts with the ylide ((C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄)-2-Cl) to form a new alkene. The resulting product is formed by connecting the carbon from the aldehyde's carbonyl group to the primary carbon of the ylide's ethylidene group via a double bond.\n\nThe chemical structure of the product is (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄)-2-Cl.\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this compound is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nThe reaction can produce two different geometric isomers, (E) and (Z), depending on the arrangement of substituent groups around the newly formed double bond. The ylide in this reaction is considered \"unstabilized,\" which typically favors the formation of the (Z)-isomer.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
