    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA long-standing question in topology, dating back to a 1920 query by Knaster and Kuratowski, was to identify all topologically distinct, non-degenerate, homogeneous continua that can exist in a plane. A complete classification was eventually provided in a 2014 paper by Logan C. Hoehn and Lex G. Oversteegen.\n\nThe four homeomorphism classes are:\n*   **The point:** This is the simplest, albeit degenerate, case of a homogeneous planar continuum.\n*   **The circle:** For a long time, the circle was thought to be the only non-degenerate example.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** Discovered by R. H. Bing in 1948, the pseudo-arc is a fractal-like, one-dimensional continuum that contains no arcs. Any two pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic to each other.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** Introduced by Bing and F. Burton Jones in 1959, this space can be envisioned as a circle where each point is replaced by a pseudo-arc.\n\nThese four examples represent the exhaustive list of all such topological spaces.\n\n<<<4>>>"
