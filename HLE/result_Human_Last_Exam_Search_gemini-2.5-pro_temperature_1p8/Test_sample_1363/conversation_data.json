    "To determine the dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique, one must analyze the fundamental mechanics of each dance. The key distinction lies between \"swing\" dances and \"walking\" or \"marching\" dances.\n\nWaltz, Viennese Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep are all swing dances. They rely on the principle of \"swing,\" which involves body sway, rise and fall, and the use of momentum generated from body rotation (Contra Body Movement or CBM). This creates a pendulum-like motion. In these dances, while a specific amount of turn is prescribed for a standard figure, the momentum from the swing can be used to rotate more than the standard amount (overturn), especially in advanced choreography. A video on the double reverse spin even demonstrates an \"over spin\" version, intentionally overturning the figure.\n\nThe European Tango, however, operates on a completely different technical basis. It is not a swing dance. Its characteristics include:\n*   **No Swing or Sway:** Tango technique explicitly avoids the swinging and swaying actions that generate rotational momentum in other dances. The movement is more level and horizontal.\n*   **Staccato Action:** Tango is known for its sharp, staccato movements and sudden changes in direction, in contrast to the continuous, flowing motion of swing dances.\n*   **No Rise and Fall:** Tango is danced with slightly bent knees and without the rise and fall characteristic of the Waltz family.\n*   **Specific Footwork:** Feet are lifted and placed, often with a \"staccato\" or \"no foot swing\" rule, rather than gliding in constant contact with the floor. The action comes from the hip in a marching-like fashion.\n\nTo overturn a reverse turn, a dancer would need to generate extra rotational momentum. In the swing dances, this is achieved by amplifying the natural swing and CBM. In Tango, these mechanics are absent. Attempting to overturn a reverse turn in Tango would necessitate introducing swing, sway, and a type of rotational force that is fundamentally against the dance's core technique. While there are many reverse turn variations in Tango, and even figures with the word \"overturned\" in the name like the \"Overturned Five Step\" or an \"overturned Natural Twist Turn\", these are specific, choreographed figures with their own technical requirements. They do not represent an overturning of the basic Reverse Turn through swing-based momentum. The fundamental technique of a standard Tango Reverse turn, with its sharp, progressive, and non-swinging action, does not allow for it to be overturned without violating these principles.\n\n<<<C>>>"
