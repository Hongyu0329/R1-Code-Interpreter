    "Andrei Voznesensky's poem refers to Nikolai Rezanov, a Russian nobleman and explorer. The lines \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" are from the poem \"Avos!\", which formed the basis for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n\nRezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 while returning from his expedition to California. His original gravestone was destroyed by the Bolsheviks, and the exact location of his remains became a subject of historical investigation. In the late 1980s, there was a renewed interest in locating his final resting place.\n\nThe love story between Nikolai Rezanov and María de la Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the Spanish commandant of San Francisco, is a central theme of \"Juno and Avos\". In 2000, in a symbolic reunion, soil from Argüello's grave in Benicia, California, was brought to Rezanov's presumed grave in Krasnoyarsk, and a rose from his grave was placed on hers.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
