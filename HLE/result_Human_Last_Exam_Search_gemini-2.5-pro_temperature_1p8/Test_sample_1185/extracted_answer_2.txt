There are multiple levels of classification for the stable reduction of genus 2 curves. A coarse classification based on the geometry of the reduced curve identifies 7 types. A finer classification, particularly in residue characteristic 2 and considering arithmetic data, distinguishes 54 types. An even more detailed classification by Namikawa and Ueno, which includes other invariants, leads to over 100 types.
