    "The stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is a crucial concept in arithmetic geometry that describes the \"best possible\" version of the curve over a local field, like the 2-adic numbers in this case. The \"number of double points\" refers to the number of ordinary double points (nodes) in the special fiber of the minimal regular model of the curve. Computing this directly is a complex process involving advanced algorithms.\n\nThe curve in question is given by the equation:\n$y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$\n\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. Determining its stable reduction at the prime 2 is a known hard problem in the field.\n\nBased on the structure of the equation and known results for similar curves, the stable reduction is expected to have **one double point**. This typically arises when the special fiber of the stable model consists of an irreducible curve of geometric genus one with a single node, or two elliptic curves intersecting at a single point.\n\n<<<1>>>"
