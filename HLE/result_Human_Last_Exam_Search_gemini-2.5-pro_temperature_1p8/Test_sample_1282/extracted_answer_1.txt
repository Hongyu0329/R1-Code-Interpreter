No, the solution cannot blow-up in finite time from a smooth divergence-free initial data. The time-dependent viscosity term $(1+t)$ provides a dissipative effect that grows stronger with time. This increasing dissipation is sufficient to prevent the formation of singularities in the solution. For a solution to the Navier-Stokes equations to blow up in finite time, the nonlinear term $u \cdot \nabla u$ must overcome the dissipative term $\nu \Delta u$. In this case, the dissipative term's strength grows linearly in time, which is a strong condition ensuring that it will always dominate the nonlinear term for large times, thus preventing a finite-time blow-up. Standard energy estimates and regularity criteria for Navier-Stokes-like equations confirm that if the integral of the viscosity coefficient over time diverges, as it does for $\nu(t)=1+t$, then smooth solutions exist for all time.
