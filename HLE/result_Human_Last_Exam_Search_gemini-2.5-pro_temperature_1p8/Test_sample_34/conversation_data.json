    "In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the worst suited jack you should typically open with a 2.5x raise from the button is J5s.\n\nAccording to pre-flop opening ranges for a 100 big blind deep cash game, the button is the most profitable position to steal the blinds from. This allows for a much wider opening range compared to other positions. Game Theory Optimal (GTO) charts for this scenario generally include raising with all suited jacks down to J5s. Specifically, one source suggests an opening range from the button that includes \"suited jacks down to J5. Another source, when discussing button strategy, mentions that hands like \"Jack five suited and better\" are standard opens. Hands weaker than J5s, such as J4s, J3s, and J2s, are typically considered too weak to open and should be folded.\n\n<<<J5s>>>"
