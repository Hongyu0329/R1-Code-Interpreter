    "In Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's overcoat serve as a powerful symbol for his shifting and fearful mentality. Chekhov describes the coat in relation to Otchumyelov's changing demeanor three times.\n\nInitially, Otchumyelov is introduced walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat, a symbol of his authority. His first change in attitude occurs when it is suggested that the dog at the center of the conflict might belong to General Zhigalov. Overcome by servility and fear, Otchumyelov feels hot and orders the policeman, Yeldyrin, to take off his coat. This act signifies his sudden panic and desire to appease a person of high social standing.\n\nHowever, when another voice in the crowd states that the dog is not the general's, Otchumyelov's official and domineering posture returns. He complains of the cold and directs Yeldyrin to help him put his overcoat back on. This gesture indicates his return to a state of authority now that the immediate threat to his position has seemingly passed.\n\nFinally, after further confusion where the dog is identified as belonging to the general's brother, Otchumyelov wraps himself in his coat and walks away, threatening the crowd. This final act with the coat solidifies his return to his \"authoritative\" shell once he understands who holds the power in the situation. The putting on, taking off, and putting on again of the greatcoat are the key moments where the coat's symbolism is described.\n\n<<<3>>>"
