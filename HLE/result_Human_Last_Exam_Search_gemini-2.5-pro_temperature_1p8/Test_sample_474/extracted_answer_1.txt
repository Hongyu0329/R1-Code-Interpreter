The researcher's approach is **partially valid as an exploratory first step but is fundamentally flawed if used as the sole method for defining ecologically meaningful mimicry syndromes.**

The primary limitation is that human visual perception is not an accurate proxy for the perception of key bumblebee predators, such as birds. Humans are blind to ultraviolet (UV) signals, which may be a crucial component of the bees' warning coloration. Therefore, similarity rankings provided by undergraduates could lead to clusters that do not reflect the way bees are actually perceived by the predators they have evolved to deter.

However, the method can be a useful and practical way to generate preliminary hypotheses about mimicry rings based on patterns in the human-visible spectrum. There is scientific precedent for using this technique, provided its limitations are explicitly acknowledged. To produce a robust and ecologically valid clustering, the results from the human observers should be validated with objective methods, such as spectrophotometry to measure full-spectrum color data (including UV) and modeling based on the visual system of avian predators.
