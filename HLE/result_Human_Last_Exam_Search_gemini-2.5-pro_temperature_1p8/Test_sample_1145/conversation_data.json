    "The probability of finding a particle in a 1D box is determined by integrating the probability density function, \\(|\\psi_n(x)|^2\\), over the specified interval. For a particle in a 1D box of length 'a', the normalized wave function for the n-th energy state is given by:\n\n\\(\\psi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\)\n\nFor the n=2 state, the wavefunction is \\(\\psi_2(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\).\n\nThe probability density, \\(P(x)\\), is the square of the wavefunction's magnitude:\n\n\\(P(x) = |\\psi_2(x)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\)\n\nTo find the probability of the particle being in the interval from \\(x_1 = 0.495a\\) to \\(x_2 = 0.505a\\), we must calculate the definite integral:\n\n\\(P(0.495a \\le x \\le 0.505a) = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx\\)\n\nThis integral can be solved using the trigonometric identity \\(\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}\\). The calculation reveals that for such a small interval (\\(\\Delta x = 0.01a\\)) around the center of the box, where there is a node (zero probability) for the n=2 state, the probability is very small.\n\nUsing an approximation for a small interval \\(\\Delta x\\) around the node at \\(x=a/2\\), the probability can be calculated as:\n\n\\(P \\approx \\frac{2\\pi^2}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta x}{a}\\right)^3\\)\n\nGiven that the interval is from 0.495a to 0.505a, the width of the interval is \\(\\Delta x = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{\\Delta x}{a} = 0.01\\).\n\nSubstituting this value into the approximation formula:\n\n\\(P \\approx \\frac{2\\pi^2}{3}(0.01)^3 = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{3} \\times 10^{-6}\\)\n\nCalculating this value:\n\n\\(P \\approx \\frac{2 \\times (3.14159)^2}{3} \\times 10^{-6} \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 9.8696}{3} \\times 10^{-6} \\approx 6.5797 \\times 10^{-6}\\)\n\nThe exact integration provides a more precise result which closely matches this approximation.\n\n<<<6.5797e-6>>>"
