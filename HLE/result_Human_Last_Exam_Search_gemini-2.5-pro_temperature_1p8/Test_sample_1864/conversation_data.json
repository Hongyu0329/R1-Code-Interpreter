    "For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using streptavidin beads with detection in the AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 channels, you should prepare a minimum of **9 essential controls**. For the most accurate and publishable results, **14 controls** are highly recommended.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of the essential and highly recommended controls:\n\n### Essential Controls (Minimum for a reliable experiment):\n\n1.  **Unstained Cells (1 control):** This is the most fundamental control. It is used to determine the level of background fluorescence, or autofluorescence, of your cells. This allows you to set the baseline voltages for your detectors.\n\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 controls):** In any multicolor flow cytometry experiment, there is spectral overlap between the different fluorochromes. You must prepare a separate control for each of your five fluorochromes (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750) to mathematically correct for this overlap in a process called compensation. These controls can be prepared using either cells or compensation beads.\n\n3.  **Viability Control (1 control):** Dead cells have a tendency to non-specifically bind antibodies and can exhibit increased autofluorescence, which can lead to false positive results. A viability dye allows you to distinguish live cells from dead cells so you can exclude the dead cells from your sort.\n\n4.  **Streptavidin Bead Controls (2 controls):**\n    *   **Unstained Beads:** To measure the autofluorescence of the streptavidin beads themselves.\n    *   **Beads + Stains (No Cells):** This control includes the streptavidin beads and all the fluorescently labeled antibodies to ensure that the antibodies are not binding non-specifically to the beads.\n\n### Highly Recommended Controls (for the highest quality data):\n\n5.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 controls):** FMO controls are critical for accurate gate placement in a multicolor experiment. Each FMO control contains all the stains except for one. This helps you to visualize the spread of fluorescence from the other channels into the one that is missing, allowing you to set a precise gate between your negative and positive populations. For a five-channel experiment, you would ideally have five FMO controls.\n\nIn summary, the number of essential controls is:\n*   1 Unstained Control\n*   5 Single-Stain Compensation Controls\n*   1 Viability Control\n*   2 Streptavidin Bead Controls\n\n**Total Essential Controls = 9**\n\nFor the most robust experiment, you should also include:\n*   5 FMO Controls\n\n**Total Recommended Controls = 14**\n\nAdditionally, depending on the specific nature of your experiment, you would also include biological controls, such as a known positive and negative sample, to validate your experimental findings.\n\n<<<14>>>"
