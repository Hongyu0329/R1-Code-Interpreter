    "<<<In the grand canonical ensemble, the partition function Z is defined as:\n\nZ = Tr[exp(-β(Ĥ - μN̂))]\n\nwhere:\n*   Tr is the trace over all states in the Fock space.\n*   β = 1/(k_B T) is the inverse thermal energy, with T being the temperature and k_B being the Boltzmann constant.\n*   Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n*   μ is the chemical potential.\n*   N̂ is the particle number operator.\n\nYou have specified a system with the Hamiltonian Ĥ = -μN̂. Substituting this into the general formula for the partition function gives:\n\nZ = Tr[exp(-β(-μN̂ - μN̂))] = Tr[exp(2βμN̂)]\n\nTo express this in the language of path integrals, we need to define the corresponding Euclidean action (S_E). The partition function is then given by a functional integral over all possible field configurations, weighted by e⁻ˢᵉ.\n\nThe general form for the grand canonical Euclidean action for a quantum field (ψ) is:\n\nS_E = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x L_E(ψ, ∂τψ)\n\nwhere the Euclidean Lagrangian density, L_E, is related to the system's Hamiltonian Ĥ and particle number N̂. The standard procedure involves replacing the operator Ĥ - μN̂ with its corresponding classical field expression inside the Lagrangian.\n\nFor the given Hamiltonian Ĥ = -μN̂, the operator in the exponent is Ĥ - μN̂ = -2μN̂. Let's assume the particle number operator is given by N̂ = ∫ d³x ψ†(x)ψ(x), where ψ is the field operator. The corresponding term in the action will be ∫ dτ ∫ d³x (-2μψ*ψ).\n\nThe full Euclidean action also includes a dynamic term, which in imaginary time (τ) is typically of the form ψ*∂τψ. Combining these, the Euclidean action for this specific system is:\n\nS_E = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x [ψ*(x, τ)∂τψ(x, τ) - 2μψ*(x, τ)ψ(x, τ)]\nS_E = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x ψ*(x, τ)(∂τ - 2μ)ψ(x, τ)\n\nTherefore, the partition function Z as a path integral is:\n\n**Z = ∫ D[ψ*]D[ψ] exp(- ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x ψ*(x, τ)(∂τ - 2μ)ψ(x, τ))**\n\nThis integral is a functional integral over all possible configurations of the field ψ and its conjugate ψ*.\n\nAn important detail is the boundary conditions imposed on the fields in the imaginary time direction:\n*   For **bosonic** fields, periodic boundary conditions are used: ψ(x, 0) = ψ(x, β).\n*   For **fermionic** fields, the fields are represented by Grassmann numbers, and anti-periodic boundary conditions are imposed: ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β).>>>"
