    "The fundamental difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, which emphasizes a strong, square torso and back, the aim is to maintain a level and squared alignment of the hips during the backbend. The movement focuses on the upper and middle back flexibility, with the spine acting as the primary source of the bend.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method is characterized by its speed, athleticism, and the creation of long, dynamic lines. A distinctive feature of the Balanchine arabesque and movements to the rear, including the cambré derrière, is the opening of the hip toward the audience. This technique, where the hip of the working leg is released to open, allows for what is often described as a more dynamic and \"in-the-moment\" aesthetic. This deliberate hip placement is a key element that contributes to the signature look of the Balanchine line.\n\nWhile other differences in arm styling, head placement, and the degree of the backbend exist, they are often a result of this core difference in hip articulation. For instance, the open hip in the Balanchine style can facilitate a deeper backbend. The Vaganova method, in contrast, prioritizes control and precise, harmonious movement of the entire body.\n\n<<<B>>>"
