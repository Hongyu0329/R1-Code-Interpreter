    "When N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide reacts with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), a directed *ortho*-metalation reaction occurs. This type of reaction involves the deprotonation of an aromatic proton positioned *ortho* (adjacent) to a directing metalation group (DMG).\n\nIn this specific molecule, there are two directing groups: the N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) at position 1 and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at position 3. The tertiary amide group is a significantly stronger directing group than the tertiary amine. Therefore, the lithiation will be directed to a position *ortho* to the amide group.\n\nThe two positions *ortho* to the N,N-diethylamide group are C2 and C6. The C2 position is also *ortho* to the dimethylamino group at C3. This means the proton at C2 is activated by both directing groups, making it the most acidic and reactive site for deprotonation. The sec-BuLi, a strong base, especially when complexed with TMEDA, will selectively remove the proton from the C2 position, forming a lithiated intermediate.\n\nThis nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate then reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide (CH₃I). The methyl group attaches to the carbon atom where the lithium was located.\n\nThe final compound obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
