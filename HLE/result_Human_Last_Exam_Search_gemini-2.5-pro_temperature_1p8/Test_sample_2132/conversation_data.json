    "The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is a derivative of cyclopentanecarboxylic acid. When the reaction is conducted using sodium ethoxide as the base, the specific product is ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate.\n\nThe Böttcher Molecular Complexity (C_m) is a metric that quantifies the complexity of a molecule based on information theory. It is calculated by summing the information content of each atom's microenvironment, taking into account factors like valency, chemical environment, isomeric possibilities, and symmetry. The unit of Böttcher complexity is the mcbit (molecular complexity bit).\n\nTo obtain the precise Böttcher Molecular Complexity of ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate, one would typically use a computational tool. The Forli Lab at Scripps Research provides a web-based calculator for this purpose. There are also Python scripts available on GitHub that can perform this calculation using the molecule's SMILES string as input.\n\nThe canonical SMILES string for ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate is `CCOC(=O)C1CCCC1`.\n\nWhile an exact value cannot be generated without using the specific software, an estimate can be made by comparing it to similar molecules. For instance, a 2024 study reports the Böttcher complexity of ethyl acetate as approximately 49.5. Given that ethyl cyclopentanecarboxylate possesses a more complex cyclic structure than the linear ethyl acetate, its Böttcher complexity would be higher than 49.5 mcbit. A definitive value would require the use of the aforementioned computational tools.\n\n"
