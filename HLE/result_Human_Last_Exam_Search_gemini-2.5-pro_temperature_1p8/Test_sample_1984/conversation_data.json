    "To find the number of stable equilibria, $m$, for the differential equation $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$, we first need to identify the equilibrium points.\n\nEquilibrium points are the solutions to $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$.\nWe need to solve the equation:\n$$-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$$\nFactoring out $-x$, we get:\n$$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$$\nThis can be further factored as:\n$$-x(x-1)^2 = 0$$\nThe equilibrium points are therefore $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. We can use the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$ at the equilibrium points.\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$$\n\nNow we evaluate $f'(x)$ for each equilibrium point:\n1.  **For $x = 0$**:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point at $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n2.  **For $x = 1$**:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    When the first derivative test is inconclusive ($f'(x^*) = 0$), we need to analyze the function's behavior around the equilibrium point. Let's analyze the sign of $x'(t) = f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x = 1$:\n    *   For $x > 1$ (e.g., $x=2$): $f(2) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2 < 0$. Solutions will move to the left, towards $x=1$.\n    *   For $0 < x < 1$ (e.g., $x=0.5$): $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.125 < 0$. Solutions will move to the left, away from $x=1$ and towards $x=0$.\n\nAn equilibrium point is considered stable if solutions that start near it remain near it. It is asymptotically stable if they also approach the point as $t \\to \\infty$. A point is unstable if some nearby solutions move away from it. In the case of $x=1$, solutions starting from the right move towards it, but solutions starting from the left move away from it. This type of equilibrium is called **semi-stable** or **half-stable**, which is considered a subtype of **unstable** equilibrium. Thus, $x = 1$ is an unstable equilibrium.\n\nTherefore, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nSo, the number of stable equilibria is $m = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m$:\n$$1 - 2^{4048}$$\n\n$2^{4048}$ is a very large positive number. We can calculate it as $(2^{1024})^4$, which will be a very large number ending in 6. For example, $2^{10} = 1024$, $2^{20} \\approx 10^6$, $2^{100} = (2^{10})^{10} \\approx (10^3)^{10} = 10^{30}$. So, $2^{4048}$ is an immense number. The problem doesn't require calculating its exact value but rather expressing the final answer in terms of this number.\n\nThus, the final expression is $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2**4048>>>"
