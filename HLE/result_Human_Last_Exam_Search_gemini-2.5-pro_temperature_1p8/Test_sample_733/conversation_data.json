    "There are infinitely many finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA full classification of these groups was provided by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. While the complete, technical statement of their classification theorem is detailed in their paper \"Groups Containing Small Locally Maximal Product-Free Sets,\" the conclusion is that several infinite families of finite groups have this property.\n\nExamples of such groups include:\n*   The cyclic group Z_n for n ≥ 4.\n*   The dihedral group D_n for n ≥ 3.\n\nIt is known that some small groups, such as the cyclic groups Z_2 and Z_3, do not possess maximal product-free sets of size 2. The classification by Giudici and Hart precisely identifies all such groups, and it is not a finite list.\n\nTherefore, the number of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 is not finite.\n\n<<<infinitely many>>>"
