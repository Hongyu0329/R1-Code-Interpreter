    "To determine the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`, we analyze the number of fundamental operations it performs as a function of the input size `n`.\n\nThe core of the algorithm is the `while` loop, which continues as long as the quotient `q` is greater than 0. Let's trace the value of `q`:\n*   Before the loop: `q = ⌊n/c⌋`\n*   After the 1st iteration: `q = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋` ≈ `n/c²`\n*   After the 2nd iteration: `q` ≈ `n/c³`\n*   ...\n*   After the *k*-th iteration: `q` ≈ `n/c^(k+1)`\n\nThe loop terminates when `q` becomes 0, which happens when `c^(k+1) > n`. Taking the logarithm to the base `c` of both sides gives `k+1 > log_c(n)`, which means the number of iterations `k` is proportional to `log_c(n)`. In Big O notation, this is expressed as `O(log_c(n))`.\n\nInside the loop, the following operations are performed in each iteration:\n*   `i := i + 1` (one increment)\n*   `x := q` (one assignment)\n*   `q := ⌊x/c⌋` (one integer division)\n*   `a_i := x - qc` (one multiplication and one subtraction)\n\nIn standard computational models, where `n` can fit into a single machine word (e.g., a 32-bit or 64-bit integer), these arithmetic operations are considered to take constant time, `O(1)`.\n\nTherefore, the total time complexity is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the complexity of the operations inside the loop:\n`Time Complexity = O(log_c(n)) * O(1) = O(log_c(n))`\n\nAccording to the change of base rule for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log_2(n) / log_2(c)`. Since `c` is a constant integer greater than or equal to 2, `log_2(c)` is also a constant. In Big O notation, constant factors are ignored. Thus, the complexity can be simplified to:\n`O(log n)`\n\nThe number of iterations is directly related to the number of digits in the base `c` representation of `n`, which is `⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. Since the loop runs a number of times proportional to the number of digits, the time complexity is logarithmic.\n\nFor very large numbers that do not fit into a single machine word, the cost of arithmetic operations like division depends on the number of bits in `n`. However, for the typical analysis of this algorithm under standard assumptions, the complexity is determined by the number of divisions, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
