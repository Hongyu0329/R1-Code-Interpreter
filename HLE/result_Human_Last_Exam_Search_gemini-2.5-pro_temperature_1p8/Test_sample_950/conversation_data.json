    "The rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 0.\n\nThe space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3,5)$. A key property of real Grassmannians is that their integral cohomology rings are often not torsion-free. In fact, according to Ehresmann, the torsion subgroups of the integral homology (and thus cohomology by the Universal Coefficient Theorem) of any real Grassmannian consist exclusively of elements of order 2. This means the torsion subgroup is a $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})$-vector space.\n\nAn abelian group that consists entirely of torsion elements is called a torsion group or a periodic group. The rank of an abelian group is the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset. A fundamental property of torsion groups is that their rank is 0. Since the torsion subgroup is, by definition, a torsion group, its rank must be 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
