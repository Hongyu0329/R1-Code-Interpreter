    "To solve this problem, we will follow a two-step process based on the properties of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).\n\nFirst, let `y(m)` be the 8-point sequence created by interleaving the 4-point sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n`y(m) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\nLet `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of this new sequence `y(m)`. The relationship between the DFT of the interleaved sequence and the DFTs of the original sequences is a known property derived from the decimation-in-time FFT algorithm structure. This property states:\n`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\nwhere `W_8^k = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / 8)` is the DFT twiddle factor.\n\nSecond, the problem asks for the *4-point* DFT of this 8-point sequence `y(m)`. This operation involves time-domain aliasing (or, equivalently, frequency-domain decimation). Let's call the resulting 4-point DFT `Z(k)`. The property relating `Z(k)` to the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is:\n`Z(k) = Y(2k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nNow, we can compute the values for `Z(k)`.\n\n**Given:**\n*   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\n**Calculation:**\n\n*   **For Z(0):**\n    `Z(0) = Y(0) = X(0 mod 4) + W_8^0 * H(0 mod 4)`\n    `Z(0) = X(0) + 1 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For Z(1):**\n    `Z(1) = Y(2) = X(2 mod 4) + W_8^2 * H(2 mod 4)`\n    `W_8^2 = exp(-j * 2 * pi * 2 / 8) = exp(-j * pi / 2) = -j`\n    `Z(1) = X(2) + (-j) * H(2) = -1 - j * 1 = -1 - j`\n\n*   **For Z(2):**\n    `Z(2) = Y(4) = X(4 mod 4) + W_8^4 * H(4 mod 4)`\n    `W_8^4 = exp(-j * 2 * pi * 4 / 8) = exp(-j * pi) = -1`\n    `Z(2) = X(0) + (-1) * H(0) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For Z(3):**\n    `Z(3) = Y(6) = X(6 mod 4) + W_8^6 * H(6 mod 4)`\n    `W_8^6 = exp(-j * 2 * pi * 6 / 8) = exp(-j * 3 * pi / 2) = j`\n    `Z(3) = X(2) + j * H(2) = -1 + j * 1 = -1 + j`\n\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is the sequence of these calculated values.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
