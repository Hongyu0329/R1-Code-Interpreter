    "In a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of 79 contracted Gaussian functions are used. This is determined by summing the number of basis functions for each atom in the molecule.\n\nFor each carbon atom, the 6-31G basis set uses 9 basis functions. Since toluene has 7 carbon atoms, this contributes 63 basis functions. For each hydrogen atom, the 6-31G basis set uses 2 basis functions. With 8 hydrogen atoms, this adds another 16 basis functions.\n\nThe breakdown is as follows:\n*   **7 Carbon atoms**: Each carbon atom (a second-row element) is described by 9 contracted basis functions. This includes one for the core (1s) orbital and a split-valence representation for the valence (2s and 2p) orbitals.\n*   **8 Hydrogen atoms**: Each hydrogen atom is described by 2 basis functions, representing a split for its 1s valence orbital.\n\nTherefore, the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is calculated as:\n(7 C atoms × 9 functions/C atom) + (8 H atoms × 2 functions/H atom) = 63 + 16 = 79 functions.\n\nA similar calculation for methanol (CH4O) confirms this approach, resulting in 26 basis functions (1x9 for C + 4x2 for H + 1x9 for O), which is a commonly cited value.\n\n<<<79>>>"
