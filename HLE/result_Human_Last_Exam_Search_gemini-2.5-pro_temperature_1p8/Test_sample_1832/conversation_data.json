    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body with mass $M$, described by the Schwarzschild metric, there are 9 non-zero, unique Christoffel symbols ($\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$). Due to the symmetry of the Christoffel symbols in their lower indices ($\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$), some components are equal but are counted as a single unique symbol.\n\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\n*   $\\Gamma_{tt}^r = \\frac{M(r-2M)}{r^3}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{rr}^r = -\\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r = -(r-2M)$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r = -(r-2M)\\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma_{rt}^t = \\frac{M}{r(r-2M)}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi = \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\sin\\theta}$\n\nThese symbols are fundamental in calculating the geodesic equations, which describe the motion of particles in the gravitational field.\n\n<<<9>>>"
