    "Despite a thorough search for a Hollywood feature film produced by a major studio depicting a teenager riding a pink bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car, a definitive match has not been found.\n\nSearches using a variety of keywords and targeting different genres, including coming-of-age stories, dramas, and independent films, did not yield a scene that precisely matches this description. The search results included numerous unrelated movie scenes, discussions on forums about different films, and general articles about bicycles in cinematic history.\n\nIt is possible that the user may be recalling a scene from a non-Hollywood film, an independent movie with limited distribution, a short film, or a television show. It is also possible that some details of the scene have been misremembered.\n\nDue to the lack of specific, verifiable information linking this exact scene to a major Hollywood production, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the user's query at this time.\n\n<<<Unable to identify the film based on the information provided.>>>"
