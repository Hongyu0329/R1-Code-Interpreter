    "### Equilibrium Properties of Light Quanta from Large Deviation Theory\n\nThe equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta, i.e., a photon gas in thermal equilibrium (black-body radiation), can be determined using the principles of large deviation theory, specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a framework for understanding the statistical properties of systems with a large number of particles, and their application to a photon gas reproduces the well-established results of Bose and Planck.\n\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, the system is found in its most probable state. According to large deviation theory, this corresponds to the state that minimizes the rate function, which is a measure of the improbability of a given macroscopic state.\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy through Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem**\n\nThe Boltzmann-Sanov theorem deals with the probability of an empirical distribution of particles deviating from its expected distribution. The rate function in this theorem is the relative entropy. For a system at equilibrium, the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy is minimized, which corresponds to a maximization of the thermodynamic entropy.\n\nFor a photon gas, which is a system of bosons with a non-conserved number of particles and thus zero chemical potential, the application of this principle leads to the well-known formula for the entropy (S) of black-body radiation. The entropy of a photon gas in a volume V at a temperature T is given by:\n\n$S = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15h^3c^3}VT^3 = \\frac{4\\sigma}{3c}VT^3$\n\nwhere:\n- *k<sub>B</sub>* is the Boltzmann constant.\n- *h* is Planck's constant.\n- *c* is the speed of light.\n- *σ* is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\n\nThis result, derived from maximizing the statistical entropy, signifies the equilibrium state of the photon gas.\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy through Cramér-Chernoff Theorem**\n\nThe Cramér-Chernoff theorem provides bounds on the probability of the sum of independent and identically distributed random variables deviating from their expected value. This can be applied to the total energy of the photon gas, where the energy of individual photons is considered as random variables. At equilibrium, the system's mean energy will correspond to the value that minimizes the large deviation function, which is related to the free energy of the system.\n\nThe moment-generating function used in the Cramér-Chernoff theorem is analogous to the partition function in statistical mechanics. For a Bose gas of photons, the partition function leads to the Planck distribution for the mean number of photons at a given frequency.\n\nBy minimizing the corresponding rate function, we obtain the equilibrium mean energy (⟨E⟩) of the photon gas, which is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n\n$⟨E⟩ = \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15h^3c^3}VT^4 = \\sigma'VT^4$\n\nwhere *σ'* is the radiation constant, which is related to the Stefan-Boltzmann constant *σ* by *σ'* = 4*σ*/c. This expression represents the total energy of the black-body radiation at a given temperature. The work by D. P. Shinde explicitly shows that applying these large deviation theorems reproduces the results of Bose and Planck for a photon gas.\n\nIn summary, the large deviation theorems of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramér-Chernoff provide a rigorous mathematical framework for deriving the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a photon gas, confirming the foundational results of quantum statistics for black-body radiation.\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Entropy:\n$S = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15h^3c^3}VT^3$\n\nEquilibrium Mean Energy:\n$⟨E⟩ = \\frac{8\\pi^5 k_B^4}{15h^3c^3}VT^4$\n>>>"
