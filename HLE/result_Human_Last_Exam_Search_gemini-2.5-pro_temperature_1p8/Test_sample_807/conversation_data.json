    "While the precise chemical compositions of Crayola crayons are proprietary and not publicly disclosed, the chemical 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is the scientific name for **Rhodamine B**.\n\nRhodamine B is a synthetic dye that produces a vibrant fluorescent red to violet color. It is also known as D&C Red No. 19.\n\nAlthough there is no definitive confirmation from Crayola, research indicates that Rhodamine B is used as a colorant in the arts and crafts industry, including in wax crayons. Studies have also detected Rhodamine B in pink-colored children's products like playdough and finger paint. Given that Rhodamine B imparts a bright pink or reddish-purple hue, it is plausible that it could be a component in Crayola crayons with similar colors, such as those in the red, pink, or violet families. However, without access to Crayola's specific formulas, it is not possible to name a single, specific crayon.\n\nCrayola has stated that its products are non-toxic and that the primary ingredients are paraffin wax and color pigments. They do not release the specific pigments used for each color.\n\n<<<It is not possible to definitively identify a specific Crayola crayon color containing 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride based on publicly available information.>>>"
