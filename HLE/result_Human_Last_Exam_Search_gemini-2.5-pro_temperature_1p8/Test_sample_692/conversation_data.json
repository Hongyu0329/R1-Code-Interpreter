    "The earliest known and securely dated inscription recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is found on Stela 2 at the archaeological site of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. The inscription bears a date from the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar which correlates to **36 BCE**.\n\nThis significant artifact provides concrete evidence of a sophisticated calendrical and writing system in use during the 1st century BCE. While other writing systems, such as those of the Olmec and Zapotec, are known to be older, Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo holds the distinction of having the earliest clearly deciphered calendrical date. For instance, some Zapotec writing on a monument from San Jos√© Mogote is dated to as early as 500-600 BCE, but these are not calendrical dates in the same way.\n\nThere is another stela, Stela 2 from Takalik Abaj in Guatemala, that could potentially be older. However, the inscription is damaged, leading to a range of possible dates between 236 BCE and 19 BCE, making its status as the definitive earliest uncertain.\n\nThe Long Count calendar was a complex system used by several Mesoamerican cultures, most famously the Maya. It counted the number of days that had passed since a mythical creation date, which is generally correlated to August 11, 3114 BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The discovery of this early date at Chiapa de Corzo, a site with strong Zoque and Epi-Olmec influences, is crucial for understanding the development and spread of writing and calendrics in Mesoamerica.\n\n<<<36 BCE>>>"
