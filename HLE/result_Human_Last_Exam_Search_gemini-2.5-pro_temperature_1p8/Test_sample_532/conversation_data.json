    "## The Structure of Finite Filled Nilpotent Groups Revealed\n\nFinite nilpotent groups that are also \"filled\" are precisely the elementary abelian 2-groups, with two exceptions: the cyclic group of order 3 and the cyclic group of order 5. This classification stems from the specific properties of product-free sets within these algebraic structures.\n\nA finite group G is called a **filled group** if all of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets are also \"complete.\" A subset `S` of a group `G` is considered **product-free** if the product of any two elements in `S` (including an element with itself) is not also in `S`. A product-free set `S` is **maximal by inclusion** if it cannot be extended by adding any other element from `G` without losing its product-free property. Finally, a product-free set is **complete** if every non-identity element of the group can be expressed either as an element of `S` or as a product of two elements from `S`.\n\nThe classification of finite filled nilpotent groups is a known result in group theory. A key theorem states that a finite abelian group is filled if and only if it is the cyclic group of order 3 (`C₃`), the cyclic group of order 5 (`C₅`), or an elementary abelian 2-group. An elementary abelian 2-group is a group where every element is its own inverse and the group operation is commutative.\n\nSince all finite abelian groups are nilpotent, the classification of filled abelian groups provides a foundational understanding. For the non-abelian case, it has been shown that for a finite nilpotent group to be filled, it must be an elementary abelian 2-group. This is because the structure of non-abelian nilpotent groups allows for the construction of maximal product-free sets that are not complete.\n\nCombining these results, the complete list of finite filled nilpotent groups is:\n\n*   **Elementary abelian 2-groups:** These are groups of the form `(ℤ/2ℤ)ⁿ`, where every element has an order of 2.\n*   **The cyclic group of order 3 (C₃).**\n*   **The cyclic group of order 5 (C₅).**\n\nIt is important to note that while all finite p-groups (groups where the order of every element is a power of a prime p) are nilpotent, not all of them are filled. For instance, the quaternion group of order 8, a non-abelian 2-group, is nilpotent but not filled.\n\nIn essence, the property of being \"filled\" imposes strong structural constraints on a finite nilpotent group, leading to this precise and limited classification.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group is filled if and only if it is an elementary abelian 2-group, the cyclic group of order 3, or the cyclic group of order 5.>>>"
