    "**No lectures were cited in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.**\n\nAlbert Einstein's seminal 1905 paper, \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"), did not contain citations to any lectures.\n\nScholarly analysis of Einstein's four major papers from his \"miraculous year\" of 1905 reveals that they contained very few references. His paper on special relativity, for example, had no citations at all. The paper on Brownian motion itself does not include a bibliography or footnotes referencing the work of other scientists in the form of lectures or publications. In the paper, Einstein does mention the phenomenon of Brownian motion, stating, \"It is possible that the movements to be discussed here are identical with the so-called ‘Brownian molecular motion’; however, the data available to me regarding the latter is so lacking in precision, that I can form no judgment in the matter.\" This indicates his awareness of the topic but also the lack of specific data or prior work that he directly built upon or cited in his theoretical treatment."
