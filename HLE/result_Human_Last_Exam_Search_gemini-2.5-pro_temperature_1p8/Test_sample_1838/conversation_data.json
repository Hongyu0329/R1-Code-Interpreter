    "To determine the central pixel of the line segment between (1,1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, the path of the line must first be plotted.\n\nBresenham's algorithm is an efficient method for drawing lines on a grid of pixels. It operates by making incremental calculations using only integers. The algorithm determines the closest pixel to the actual line at each step.\n\nFor the line between (1,1) and (11,5):\n*   The change in x (Δx) is 10.\n*   The change in y (Δy) is 4.\n\nSince Δx is greater than Δy, the x-coordinate will be incremented in every step, while the y-coordinate will only be incremented when the decision parameter indicates it's necessary.\n\nThe sequence of pixels drawn by the algorithm is as follows:\n(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3), **(6, 3)**, (7, 3), (8, 4), (9, 4), (10, 5), (11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels in this line. The central pixel is the 6th one in the sequence.\n\n<<<The coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).>>>"
