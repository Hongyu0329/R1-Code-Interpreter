    "There are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\nOn a toroidal, or wrap-around, chessboard, the rules of queen attacks are modified. In addition to the standard horizontal, vertical, and diagonal attacks on a regular board, the wrap-around nature of the torus creates additional attack lines. For instance, a queen on the top row can attack a queen on the bottom row if they are in the same column, and similar logic applies to rows and diagonals.\n\nThe problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n x n board is a classic combinatorial problem. The toroidal variation adds a layer of complexity. For the specific case of placing 5 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board, solutions are known to exist. This is in line with a theorem by the mathematician George Pólya, which states that n non-attacking queens can be placed on an n x n toroidal board if and only if n is not divisible by 2 or 3. Since 5 is not divisible by 2 or 3, solutions for 5 queens are possible, and it has been shown that there are 10 such solutions.\n\nFor the case of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board, a specific enumeration is required. According to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), sequence A179061 documents the number of ways to place 4 nonattacking queens on an n x n toroidal board. For n=5, the value is listed as 50. This result is attributed to the extensive computations by mathematician and chess problem expert Václav Kotešovec.\n\n<<<50>>>"
