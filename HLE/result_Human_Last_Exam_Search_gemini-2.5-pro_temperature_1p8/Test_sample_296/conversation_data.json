    "The Grigorchuk group, denoted by Γ, is a fascinating and extensively studied object in group theory, known for its intermediate growth and other exotic properties. To determine the number of its subgroups of index 4, we delve into its structure and known results about its finite quotients.\n\nA key property of the Grigorchuk group is that it is a finitely generated infinite 2-group, meaning every element has an order that is a power of two. This implies that any finite quotient of the Grigorchuk group must also be a 2-group (a group of order 2^n for some integer n).\n\nThe number of subgroups of index *n* in a group *G* is equal to the number of distinct transitive homomorphisms from *G* to the symmetric group S_n, divided by *n*. For an index of 4, we are interested in transitive homomorphisms from the Grigorchuk group to S_4. The transitive subgroups of S_4 are the cyclic group of order 4 (C₄), the Klein four-group (V₄), the dihedral group of order 8 (D₈, which is the 2-Sylow subgroup of S_4), the alternating group A₄, and S₄ itself.\n\nSince the image of any homomorphism from the Grigorchuk group to a finite group must be a 2-group, we can eliminate A₄ (order 12) and S₄ (order 24) as possibilities. Furthermore, the abelianization of the Grigorchuk group, Γ/[Γ, Γ], is isomorphic to the elementary abelian group of order 8, (C₂)³. As this group only contains elements of order 2, there can be no surjective homomorphism from the Grigorchuk group onto C₄, which contains an element of order 4.\n\nThis leaves two possibilities for the image of a transitive homomorphism to S₄: the Klein four-group (V₄) and the dihedral group of order 8 (D₈).\n\nThe subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group can be classified as follows:\n*   **Normal subgroups of index 4:** These subgroups are the kernels of surjective homomorphisms from Γ onto an abelian group of order 4. The only such group is the Klein four-group, V₄ ≅ C₂ × C₂. The number of these subgroups is equal to the number of subgroups of index 4 in the abelianization of the Grigorchuk group, (C₂)³. A 3-dimensional vector space over the field of 2 elements has 7 two-dimensional subspaces. Thus, there are 7 normal subgroups of index 4, with the quotient group being isomorphic to the Klein four-group.\n*   **Non-normal subgroups of index 4:** These subgroups correspond to surjective homomorphisms from Γ onto the non-abelian dihedral group of order 8, D₈. It has been established that there are 14 such non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n\nCombining these, the total number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is 7 (normal) + 14 (non-normal) = 21.\n\n<<<21>>>"
