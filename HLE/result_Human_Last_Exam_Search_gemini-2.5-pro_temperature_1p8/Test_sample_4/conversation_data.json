    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given 6-dimensional real Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we first analyze its structure. The commutation relations are:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\nAll other brackets of generators are zero.\n\nThis Lie algebra can be viewed as a fiber product (or pullback) of two smaller Lie algebras over the 1-dimensional Lie algebra $\\mathbb{R}$.\nLet $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ be the 4-dimensional Lie algebra spanned by $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ with relations $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$ and $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$. This is the standard model filiform Lie algebra of dimension 4, often denoted $\\mathfrak{f}_4$.\nLet $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ be the 3-dimensional Lie algebra spanned by $\\{f_1, f_5, f_6\\}$ with relation $[f_1, f_5] = f_6$. This is the Heisenberg Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_3$. We identify $f_1$ with our $e_1$, $f_5$ with $e_5$, and $f_6$ with $e_6$.\n\nThe algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the fiber product of $\\mathfrak{g}_1$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_2$ over the common subalgebra $\\mathfrak{h} = \\text{span}\\{e_1\\} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\nFor such a fiber product of Lie algebras, the cohomology ring $H^*(\\mathfrak{g})$ is the graded tensor product of the cohomology rings of its components over the cohomology ring of the common subalgebra:\n$H^*(\\mathfrak{g}; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H^*(\\mathfrak{g}_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes_{H^*(\\mathfrak{h}; \\mathbb{R})} H^*(\\mathfrak{g}_2; \\mathbb{R})$\n\nThis relation on the level of cohomology rings implies a multiplicative relation for their Poincaré polynomials (which are the generating functions for the dimensions of the graded components of these rings):\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = \\frac{P_{\\mathfrak{g}_1}(x) P_{\\mathfrak{g}_2}(x)}{P_{\\mathfrak{h}}(x)}$\n\nWe need to compute the Poincaré polynomials for $\\mathfrak{g}_1 = \\mathfrak{f}_4$, $\\mathfrak{g}_2 = \\mathfrak{h}_3$, and $\\mathfrak{h} = \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n1.  **Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{h} = \\mathbb{R}$**:\n    This is a 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra. Its homology is $H_0(\\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}$ and $H_1(\\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}$, and all higher homology groups are trivial. The Betti numbers are $b_0=1, b_1=1$.\n    The Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x) = 1 + x$.\n\n2.  **Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}_2 = \\mathfrak{h}_3$**:\n    The Heisenberg algebra has dimension 3. Its Betti numbers are well-known: $b_0=1, b_1=2, b_2=2, b_3=1$.\n    The Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3$.\n    We can factor this as $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = (1+x)(1+x+x^2)$.\n\n3.  **Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}_1 = \\mathfrak{f}_4$**:\n    This is the 4-dimensional model filiform Lie algebra. We compute its Betti numbers using the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex for cohomology. The non-zero commutation relations are $[e_1, e_2]=e_3, [e_1, e_3]=e_4$. Let $\\{e^1, e^2, e^3, e^4\\}$ be the dual basis. The differentials are $de^1=0, de^2=0, de^3=-e^1\\wedge e^2, de^4=-e^1\\wedge e^3$.\n    *   $H^0(\\mathfrak{f}_4)$: $b^0=1$.\n    *   $H^1(\\mathfrak{f}_4)$: Cocycles are $e^1, e^2$. Boundaries are 0. $b^1=2$.\n    *   $H^2(\\mathfrak{f}_4)$: Cocycles are $e^1\\wedge e^2, e^1\\wedge e^3, e^1\\wedge e^4, e^2\\wedge e^3$. Boundaries are $e^1\\wedge e^2, e^1\\wedge e^3$. So $H^2$ is represented by classes of $e^1\\wedge e^4$ and $e^2\\wedge e^3$. $b^2=2$.\n    *   $H^3(\\mathfrak{f}_4)$: By Poincaré duality for nilpotent Lie algebras, $b^3=b_1=\\dim(\\mathfrak{g}/[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]) = 4-2=2$.\n    *   $H^4(\\mathfrak{f}_4)$: $b^4=b_0=1$.\n    So the Betti numbers for the cohomology are $(1, 2, 2, 2, 1)$.\n    The Poincaré polynomial is $P_{\\mathfrak{f}_4}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4$.\n\nNow we can compute the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = \\frac{P_{\\mathfrak{f}_4}(x) P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x)}{P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x)} = \\frac{(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3)}{1 + x}$\nUsing the factorization $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = (1+x)(1+x+x^2)$, we get:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)(1+x+x^2)$\nExpanding this product:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1)(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) + x(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) + x^2(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)$\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) + (x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5) + (x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + 2x^5 + x^6)$\nCollecting terms by powers of $x$:\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = 1 + (2+1)x + (2+2+1)x^2 + (2+2+2)x^3 + (1+2+2)x^4 + (1+2)x^5 + 1x^6$\n$P_\\mathfrak{g}(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nThe Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is $1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 5*x^2 + 6*x^3 + 5*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
