    "The problem of tightly packing circles into a larger circle is a classic mathematical challenge. For fourteen circles, the optimal arrangement and the radius of the enclosing circle have been determined.\n\nThe radius of the larger circle required to contain fourteen circles of radius one is approximately 3.4479 times the radius of the smaller circles. Given that the smaller circles have a radius of one, the radius of the larger circle is 3.4479. The solution for the tight packing of 14 circles has been proven to be optimal.\n\nThis optimal arrangement consists of a central circle surrounded by a ring of five circles, which is then enclosed by an outer ring of eight circles. This specific configuration minimizes the required radius of the larger circle. The solutions for the optimal packing of up to 20 circles have been compiled and are widely referenced. The problem of finding the smallest circle to contain a given number of unit circles has been solved for n=1 through 14, and n=19.\n\n<<<3.4479>>>"
