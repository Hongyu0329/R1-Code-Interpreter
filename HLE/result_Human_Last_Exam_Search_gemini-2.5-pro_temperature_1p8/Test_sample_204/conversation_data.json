    "The Hopf charge of the given vector field is determined by identifying its topological structure, which is that of a toroidal hopfion. The Hopf charge, also known as the Hopf index, for such a configuration is the product of two integer winding numbers: the toroidal winding number (n) and the poloidal winding number (m).\n\nThe vector field is defined as:\n*   `f = atan2(y,x)`\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`\n*   `G = PI*(exp(-10*r2))`\n*   `nx = sin(G)*cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G)*sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nHere, the angle `f` represents the azimuthal angle in a cylindrical coordinate system, which corresponds to the toroidal angle of the hopfion. The components `nx` and `ny` show a dependence on `cos(f)` and `sin(f)`, which indicates a winding around the z-axis. As a point makes a full circle around the z-axis, the vector field also completes one full rotation, which means the toroidal winding number is **n = 1**.\n\nThe angle `G` represents the poloidal angle. It is a function of `r2`, which is the distance from a circle of radius `sqrt(0.5)` located in the `z=0` plane. This circle forms the core of the torus.\n*   At the core of the torus (`r2 = 0`), the angle `G` is `PI`. This results in the vector `(nx, ny, nz)` being `(0, 0, -1)`.\n*   At an infinite distance from the torus (`r2` → ∞), the term `exp(-10*r2)` approaches 0, making `G` equal to `0`. This results in the vector `(nx, ny, nz)` being `(0, 0, 1)`.\n\nAs one moves from the core of the torus to its exterior, the vector field undergoes a full 180-degree rotation in the poloidal direction (from pointing down to pointing up). This full rotation signifies a poloidal winding number of **m = 1**.\n\nThe Hopf charge `Q_H` is the product of these two winding numbers. Therefore:\n`Q_H = m * n = 1 * 1 = 1`\n\n<<<1>>>"
