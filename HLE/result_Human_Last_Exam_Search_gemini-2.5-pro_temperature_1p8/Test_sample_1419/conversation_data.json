    "In the ϕ^4 theory near four dimensions, the behavior of the coupling constant `u` under changes in the energy scale is described by the beta function, β(u). In d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, where ϵ is a small positive parameter, the one-loop beta function for the coupling `u` associated with the (u/4!)ϕ^4 interaction term is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (3u^2)/(16π^2)\n\nThe fixed points of the renormalization group flow are the values of the coupling u* for which the beta function vanishes, i.e., β(u*) = 0. There are two fixed points. The first is the trivial Gaussian fixed point at u* = 0. The second, non-trivial fixed point, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, is found by solving:\n\n-ϵu* + (3(u*)^2)/(16π^2) = 0\n\nFor a non-zero coupling, we can divide by u* to obtain:\n\nϵ = (3u*)/(16π^2)\n\nSolving for u*, we get the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling in terms of ϵ:\n\nu* = (16π^2/3)ϵ.\n\nThis expression represents the value of the coupling constant at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which governs the universal critical behavior of the theory in dimensions slightly below four. The existence of this fixed point at a small, positive value of the coupling for small ϵ justifies the use of perturbation theory in the epsilon expansion to study critical phenomena.\n\n<<<u* = (16π^2/3)ϵ>>>"
