The displacement field $\vec{D}$ through the transistor, defined as the net field resulting from the superposition of the fields from the top and back gates, is given by the vector expression:
$\vec{D} = (C_{bg}V_{bg} - C_{tg}V_{tg})\hat{z}$
where $\hat{z}$ is the unit vector normal to the gates, pointing from the back gate to the top gate.
