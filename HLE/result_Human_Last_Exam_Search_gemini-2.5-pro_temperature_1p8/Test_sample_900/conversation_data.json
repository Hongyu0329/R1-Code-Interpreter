    "Despite an extensive search, a video of Svetlana Gileva performing the Jete Woman solo in the 2015 Forsythe production of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" with the Semperoper Ballett is not publicly available. The official video previously on YouTube is no longer accessible, and searches on other video platforms and with broader terms have not yielded a working version of this specific performance.\n\nAdditionally, while there is mention of a ballet step known as \"pas de Balanchine,\" detailed choreographic breakdowns of the \"Jete Woman solo\" that specifically identify this step within the piece are not available.\n\nWithout a visual record of Svetlana Gileva's performance and a confirmed choreographic definition of a \"pas de Balanchine\" within the context of this specific ballet, it is impossible to provide a number of times the step was performed.\n\n<<<Impossible to answer>>>"
