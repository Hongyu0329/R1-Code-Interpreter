    "To design an observer where the observation error becomes zero in the shortest possible time, we need to create a deadbeat observer. This involves placing all the eigenvalues of the observer error dynamics matrix, `(A - LC)`, at the origin. The condition for the existence of such an observer is that the system must be observable.\n\n### 1. System Definition\nThe given discrete-time system is:\n`x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nwith matrices:\n*   `A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`\n*   `B = [0; 1; -1; 1]`\n*   `C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n\nThe state vector dimension is `n=4`, and the output vector dimension is `m=2`.\n\n### 2. Observability Analysis\nFirst, we must check if the system is observable by calculating the rank of the observability matrix `O`. The observability matrix is constructed as:\n`O = [C; CA; CA^2; ...; CA^(n-1)]`\n\nLet's compute the necessary components:\n*   `C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n*   `CA = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`\n*   `CA^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [2, 1, 0, -3]]`\n\nThe observability matrix constructed from these blocks is:\n`O = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0; 0 0 1 -2; 2 1 0 -3]`\n\nThe rank of this 6x4 matrix can be determined to be 4. Since the rank equals the state dimension `n=4`, the system is completely observable, and a deadbeat observer can be designed. The shortest time for the error to converge to zero is determined by the observability index `ν`, which is the smallest integer such that `rank[C; CA; ...; CA^(ν-1)] = n`. For this system, the observability index `ν` is 3.\n\n### 3. Observer Gain Calculation\nFor a multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) system, we can use pole placement techniques. A common method is to convert the MIMO problem into a single-input, single-output (SISO) problem. We choose a vector `g` such that the pair `(A, g^T*C)` is observable and then design a SISO observer for this new system. The final observer gain `L` is then `l*g^T`, where `l` is the SISO observer gain.\n\nLet's select `g = [1; 0]`. The new output matrix is `C_g = g^T * C = [1, 0] * [[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,1]] = [1, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nWe design a deadbeat observer for the SISO system `(A, C_g)` by placing all poles at `z=0`. The desired characteristic equation is `p(z) = z^4 = 0`. We can use Ackermann's formula for the observer gain `l`:\n\n`l = p(A) * (O_g)^(-1) * [0; 0; 0; 1]`\n\nwhere `p(A) = A^4` and `O_g` is the observability matrix for the pair `(A, C_g)`.\n\n1.  **SISO Observability Matrix `O_g`**:\n    `O_g = [C_g; C_g*A; C_g*A^2; C_g*A^3]`\n    `O_g = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [-1, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, -2], [2, 1, -2, 1]]`\n    This matrix has a rank of 4, so the pair `(A, C_g)` is observable.\n\n2.  **Calculate `A^4`**:\n    `A^2 = [[0, 0, 1, -2], [-3, 0, 2, -1], [2, 0, -1, 3], [2, 1, -1, -1]]`\n    `A^3 = [[2, 1, -2, 1], [4, 2, -1, -4], [-5, -1, 3, 0], [-2, -1, -1, 6]]`\n    `A^4 = [[-4, -2, 1, 5], [-2, -1, -4, 13], [6, 3, 0, -10], [-5, -1, 6, -7]]`\n\n3.  **Solve for the last column of `(O_g)^(-1)`**:\n    Let `x` be the last column of `(O_g)^(-1)`. We solve `O_g * x = [0; 0; 0; 1]`.\n    The solution is `x = [0; 1; 0; 0]`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the SISO gain `l`**:\n    `l = A^4 * x`. This corresponds to the second column of `A^4`.\n    `l = [-2; -1; 3; -1]`\n\n5.  **Calculate the final observer gain matrix `L`**:\n    `L = l * g^T = [[-2], [-1], [3], [-1]] * [1, 0]`\n    `L = [[-2, 0], [-1, 0], [3, 0], [-1, 0]]`\n\nThis gain matrix `L` places all the eigenvalues of the error dynamics matrix `(A - LC)` at the origin, which makes the observation error zero in at most `n=4` steps.\n\n<<<[[ -2, 0 ], [ -1, 0 ], [ 3, 0 ], [ -1, 0 ]]>>>"
