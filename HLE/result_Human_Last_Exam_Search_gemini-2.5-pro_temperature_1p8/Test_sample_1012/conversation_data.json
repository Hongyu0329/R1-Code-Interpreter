    "An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer poses a significant threat to symmetric key cryptography due to Grover's algorithm, which can dramatically speed up the process of finding the correct encryption key. This algorithm effectively halves the bit-strength of a symmetric key.\n\nTo counteract the threat of a brute-force attack from a quantum computer, it is recommended to double the key length. For instance, an AES-128 key, under assault from a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm, would have its security diminished to that of a 64-bit key, which is no longer considered secure.\n\nTo achieve a level of security in a post-quantum world that is equivalent to 128-bit security in classical computing, a 256-bit key is necessary. A 256-bit key, when its strength is effectively halved by a quantum attack, provides a 128-bit security level, a standard that is currently considered secure for the foreseeable future. Therefore, symmetric ciphers like AES-256 are recommended for post-quantum security.\n\nBased on this, the minimum length a symmetric key needs to be to remain secure against an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer is 256 bits.\n\n<<<A>>>"
