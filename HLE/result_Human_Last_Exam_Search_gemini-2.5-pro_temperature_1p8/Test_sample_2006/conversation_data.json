    "The haiku provided describes a significant historical event that took place in August, culminating in the surrender or yielding of a divine figure, and is connected to a question about \"The Bays\".\n\nThe haiku's lines can be interpreted as follows:\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This points to a period of great turmoil and conflict in the month of August.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: This most directly refers to August 15th, a date of monumental change.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This alludes to the surrender of a figure who was regarded as divine by their people.\n\nThese clues strongly point to the end of World War II in the Pacific. The \"August tempest\" represents the atomic bombings of Hiroshima on August 6th and Nagasaki on August 9th, 1945, which led to the final stages of the war. On **August 15th**, 1945, a date signified by \"twice fifteen,\" Emperor Hirohito of Japan, who was considered a divine figure, announced the unconditional surrender of Japan to the Allied forces, heralding a massive \"wind of change\" and the end of the war.\n\nThe title of the haiku, a question, is \"The Bays\". The answer to this question is found in the location of the formal surrender ceremony. On September 2, 1945, the official Instrument of Surrender was signed aboard the USS Missouri, which was anchored in **Tokyo Bay**.\n\nThe request for the answer to be in alphabetical order indicates that the two words identifying the location should be alphabetized.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nBay, Tokyo\n\n<<<Bay, Tokyo>>>"
