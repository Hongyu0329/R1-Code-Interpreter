    "This puzzle requires figuring out a transformation rule that maps a given input grid to a corresponding output grid. The transformation appears to revolve around the character '2'.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rules\n\nLet's represent the inputs as grids, with rows and columns (0-indexed).\n\n**Case A:**\n*   Input_A:\n    ```\n    001111\n    121111\n    111111\n    ```\n*   Output_A:\n    ```\n    201111\n    101111\n    111111\n    ```\nIn `Input_A`, the '2' is at position (row=1, col=1). In `Output_A`, the '2' has moved to (0,0), and the original position (1,1) has become '0'. The character at the destination (0,0) was '0'. This suggests the '2' swaps places with a '0' at a new location.\n\n**Case B:**\n*   Input_B:\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000011110\n    1111002111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\n*   Output_B:\n    ```\n    0000000000000\n    1100000001000\n    1111000211110\n    1111000111111\n    1111111111111\n    ```\nIn `Input_B`, the '2' is at (3,6). In `Output_B`, it has moved to (2,7), and its original position (3,6) has become '0'. The character at the destination (2,7) was '0'.\n\n### Deducing the Rule\n\nThe movement of the '2' is determined by the characters immediately to its left (L) and right (R).\n\nLet `(r, c)` be the coordinates of '2'. The movement is `(dr, dc)`, where `dr` is the change in row and `dc` is the change in column.\n\n1.  **From Case A**:\n    *   The '2' is at (1,1).\n    *   L = `Input_A[1][0]` = '1'.\n    *   R = `Input_A[1][2]` = '1'.\n    *   The move is from (1,1) to (0,0), so `(dr, dc) = (-1, -1)`.\n    *   Rule inferred: If L='1' and R='1', the move is up-left.\n\n2.  **From Case B**:\n    *   The '2' is at (3,6).\n    *   L = `Input_B[3][5]` = '0'.\n    *   R = `Input_B[3][7]` = '1'.\n    *   The move is from (3,6) to (2,7), so `(dr, dc) = (-1, +1)`.\n    *   Rule inferred: If L='0' and R='1', the move is up-right.\n\nFrom these two examples, we can generalize the movement rule:\n*   The character `R` controls the vertical movement (`dr`): if `R` is '1', `dr` is -1 (up).\n*   The character `L` controls the horizontal movement (`dc`): if `L` is '1', `dc` is -1 (left); if `L` is '0', `dc` is +1 (right).\n\nLet's hypothesize the full rule for movement:\n*   If `R` is '1', `dr = -1` (Up). If `R` is '0', `dr = +1` (Down).\n*   If `L` is '1', `dc = -1` (Left). If `L` is '0', `dc = +1` (Right).\n\nThe transformation is only valid if the destination cell `(r+dr, c+dc)` contains a '0'.\n\n### Applying the Rule to Case C\n\nNow, let's analyze `Input_C` to understand why `Output_C` is 'MISSING'.\n\n*   Input_C:\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n1.  The '2' is at `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n2.  The character to the left is L = `Input_C[1][3]` = '1'.\n3.  The character to the right is R = `Input_C[1][5]` = '0'.\n4.  Based on our derived rules:\n    *   Since R is '0', `dr = +1` (Down).\n    *   Since L is '1', `dc = -1` (Left).\n5.  The target coordinates are `(r+dr, c+dc) = (1+1, 4-1) = (2, 3)`.\n6.  We check the character at the target position `Input_C[2][3]`. The value is '1'.\n\nSince the target cell does not contain a '0', the transformation rule cannot be applied. This type of failure results in the output 'MISSING'. The puzzle states `Output_C='MISSING'`, which aligns perfectly with our findings.\n\nThe question is \"What is the value of MISSING?\". Based on the puzzle's structure, \"MISSING\" is the specific output assigned when the transformation is not possible.\n\n<<<MISSING>>>"
