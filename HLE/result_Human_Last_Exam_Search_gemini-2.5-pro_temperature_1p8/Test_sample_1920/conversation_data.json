    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factorize the conductor $d$**: First, we need to find the prime factorization of $d=53599$. A search reveals that $53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 17 \\times 31$. Since $d$ is a square-free integer, it is a product of distinct primes.\n\n2.  **Structure of primitive characters for a square-free conductor**: For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\psi_1 \\psi_2 \\dots \\psi_k$, where each $\\psi_i$ is a non-principal (and thus primitive) character modulo the prime $p_i$.\n\n3.  **Order of the character**: The order of such a character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters $\\psi_i$. We need this order to be 6.\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\psi_7), \\text{ord}(\\psi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\psi_{17}), \\text{ord}(\\psi_{31})) = 6$.\n\n4.  **Possible orders of component characters**: The group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is a cyclic group of order $p-1$. A character $\\psi_p$ must have an order that divides $p-1$. For $\\chi$ to have order 6, the order of each component character $\\psi_p$ must be a divisor of 6. Also, since each $\\psi_p$ must be non-principal, its order must be greater than 1.\n\n    The number of primitive characters (all non-principal characters are primitive for a prime modulus) of order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is $\\phi(k)$ if $k | (p-1)$ and $k>1$.\n\n    Let's analyze the possible orders for each prime factor of $d=53599$:\n    *   For $p_1=7$: $p_1-1=6$. The possible non-principal orders dividing 6 are 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is:\n        *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n        *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$\n        *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$\n        The total number of non-principal characters with order dividing 6 is $1+2+2=5$.\n    *   For $p_2=13$: $p_2-1=12$. The possible non-principal orders dividing 6 are 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is:\n        *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n        *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$\n        *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$\n        The total is $1+2+2=5$.\n    *   For $p_3=17$: $p_3-1=16$. The only possible non-principal order dividing 6 is 2. The number of such characters is:\n        *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n    *   For $p_4=31$: $p_4-1=30$. The possible non-principal orders dividing 6 are 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is:\n        *   Order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$\n        *   Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$\n        *   Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$\n        The total is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n5.  **Counting the characters of order 6**: Let $N_k$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ and order exactly $k$. We want to find $N_6$. We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n    Let $A_k$ be the set of primitive characters of conductor $d$ whose order divides $k$. The number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each prime factor.\n    *   The number of characters with order dividing 6 is:\n        $|A_6| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 125$.\n    *   The order of a character divides 6 if and only if it is 1, 2, 3, or 6. As characters are primitive, the order cannot be 1.\n    *   Let's find the number of characters whose order divides 2 (i.e., is exactly 2). For the order of $\\chi$ to divide 2, the order of each component $\\psi_p$ must divide 2. Since they must be non-principal, their order must be exactly 2.\n        $|A_2| = (\\text{num. chars order 2 for } 7) \\times (\\text{num. chars order 2 for } 13) \\times (\\text{num. chars order 2 for } 17) \\times (\\text{num. chars order 2 for } 31)$\n        $|A_2| = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n    *   Let's find the number of characters whose order divides 3. For this, the order of each $\\psi_p$ must be 3.\n        $|A_3| = (\\text{num. chars order 3 for } 7) \\times (\\text{num. chars order 3 for } 13) \\times (\\text{num. chars order 3 for } 17) \\times (\\text{num. chars order 3 for } 31)$\n        $|A_3| = 2 \\times 2 \\times 0 \\times 2 = 0$. There are no characters of order 3 for modulus 17, as 3 does not divide $17-1=16$.\n    The number of characters of exact order 6 is given by:\n    $N_6 = |A_6| - |A_2| - |A_3| + |A_1|$.\n    Since the characters are primitive, they cannot have order 1, so $|A_1|=0$.\n    $N_6 = 125 - 1 - 0 + 0 = 124$.\n\nAn alternative way to see this is that any character $\\chi$ must have a component $\\psi_{17}$ of order 2. Thus, the order of $\\chi$ must be even. Therefore, no character of conductor $d$ can have an order of 1 or 3. The characters whose orders divide 6 can only have an actual order of 2 or 6. We counted one character of order 2, and the rest of the 125 must have order 6.\n\nFinal calculation:\nThe total number of primitive characters with conductor $d$ and order dividing 6 is 125.\nThe number of such characters with order 2 is 1.\nThe number of such characters with order 3 is 0.\nThe number of such characters with order 1 is 0.\nThus, the number of characters with order 6 is $125 - 1 = 124$.\n\n<<<124>>>"
