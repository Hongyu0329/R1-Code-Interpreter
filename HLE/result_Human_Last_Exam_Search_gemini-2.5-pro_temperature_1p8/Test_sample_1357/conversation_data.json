    "When a curve's Jacobian has good reduction, the stable reduction of the curve must have a special fiber whose dual graph is a tree, and all irreducible components of this special fiber are smooth curves. For a genus 4 curve, the sum of the genera of these components must equal 4. Therefore, the types of stable reductions correspond to the partitions of the number 4 into positive integers, along with the possible tree structures for each partition.\n\nThe possible partitions of the genus 4 are:\n1.  **4:** The special fiber is a single smooth curve of genus 4. This represents the case where the curve itself has good reduction. This corresponds to one type of stable reduction.\n2.  **3 + 1:** The special fiber consists of a smooth genus 3 curve and a smooth genus 1 curve (an elliptic curve), intersecting at a single node. This gives one type of stable reduction.\n3.  **2 + 2:** The special fiber is composed of two smooth genus 2 curves intersecting at one node. This accounts for one type.\n4.  **2 + 1 + 1:** The special fiber has three components: one of genus 2 and two of genus 1. As a tree structure with three vertices, it must be a path. There are two distinct configurations for the weighted graph:\n    *   The genus 2 curve is the central component, connected to the two genus 1 curves.\n    *   A genus 1 curve is the central component, connected to the genus 2 curve and the other genus 1 curve.\n    This gives two types of stable reductions.\n5.  **1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** The special fiber consists of four elliptic curves connected in a tree structure. There are two non-isomorphic trees with four vertices:\n    *   A path graph (a chain of four elliptic curves).\n    *   A star graph (one central elliptic curve connected to the other three).\n    This adds two more types of stable reductions.\n\nSumming these up, the total number of types of stable reductions is 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
