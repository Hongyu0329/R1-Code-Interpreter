    "I have conducted an extensive search for the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461. While the search has confirmed that the town, as a free royal borough, had a judge and a town council during this period, the specific name of the judge for the year 1461 is not available in the online resources I have been able to access.\n\nThe most promising lead is the academic monograph by historian Mária Fedorčáková titled **\"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. Správa mesta Bardejov v stredoveku (1320–1526)\"** (Our town called Bardejov. The Administration of the Town of Bardejov in the Middle Ages (1320–1526)). A review of this book explicitly states that it contains appendices with \"lists of judges and members of the town council until the 1520s\". This book is based on the remarkably well-preserved medieval archives of Bardejov.\n\nUnfortunately, the full text of this book, including its appendices, is not digitally accessible through the available tools. Therefore, without direct access to this publication or the physical archives, it is not possible to provide the name of the judge.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question based on the available information.>>>"
