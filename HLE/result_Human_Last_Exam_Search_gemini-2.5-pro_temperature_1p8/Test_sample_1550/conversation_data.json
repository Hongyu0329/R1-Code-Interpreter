    "To determine the number of real intersection points for the plane quadrics given by the equations:\n1.  `164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0`\n2.  `864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0`\n\nFirst, we can identify the type of conic section each equation represents. This can be done by examining the discriminant `B^2 - 4AC` for the quadratic part of the equation `Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2`.\n\nFor the first quadric:\nA = 164, B = -216, C = 72\nDiscriminant = `(-216)^2 - 4 * 164 * 72 = 46656 - 47232 = -576`. Since the discriminant is negative, this conic is an ellipse.\n\nFor the second quadric:\nA = 864, B = -1056, C = 324\nDiscriminant = `(-1056)^2 - 4 * 864 * 324 = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608`. As this discriminant is also negative, this conic is also an ellipse.\n\nThe problem is to find the number of real intersection points between two ellipses. Two distinct ellipses can intersect at a maximum of four points. Solving the system of these two quadratic equations algebraically is a complex task, typically leading to a quartic equation in one of the variables.\n\nA more direct approach is to use a graphical plotting tool to visualize the two ellipses and count their intersection points. By plotting both equations, we can observe the number of times the curves cross.\n\nA plot of both equations reveals that the two ellipses intersect at four distinct points. The approximate coordinates of these intersection points are:\n*   x ≈ -0.350, y ≈ -0.659\n*   x ≈ 0.183, y ≈ 1.252\n*   x ≈ 0.434, y ≈ 0.177\n*   x ≈ 0.963, y ≈ 0.584\n\nSince there are four distinct points of intersection, the number of real intersection points is four.\n\n<<<4>>>"
