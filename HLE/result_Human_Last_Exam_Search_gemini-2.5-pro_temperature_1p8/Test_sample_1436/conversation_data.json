    "The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram depends on its specific topology. For a diagram with two vertices and four field contractions, which is interpreted as four propagators (lines), a common example is a two-loop vacuum diagram in a theory with a φ⁴ interaction. The symmetry factor for this specific diagram is 48.\n\nThis value is determined by the number of permutations of the diagram's components that leave the diagram unchanged. The calculation for the two-vertex, four-propagator vacuum diagram is as follows:\n\n*   **Permutations of Identical Propagators:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are identical. They can be interchanged in 4! (4 factorial) ways.\n    4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.\n*   **Permutations of Identical Vertices:** Since this is a vacuum diagram with no external connections, the two vertices are indistinguishable. They can be swapped, which gives a factor of 2.\n    2! = 2.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these individual factors:\nS = 24 × 2 = 48.\n\nThis can be confirmed using a general formula for symmetry factors in a scalar field theory.\n\nIt is important to note that other diagrams with two vertices can be constructed, and their symmetry factors will differ based on their unique topologies. For instance:\n\n*   A \"figure-eight\" diagram contributing to a 4-point Green's function has two vertices and two internal propagators. Its symmetry factor is typically 8.\n*   A \"setting sun\" diagram, which contributes to the 2-point Green's function, has two vertices connected by three propagators. Because the external lines make the vertices distinguishable, its symmetry factor is 3! = 6.\n\nTherefore, the precise topology of the diagram is essential for determining its symmetry factor.\n\n<<<48>>>"
