    "Answering this question requires analyzing the homotopy groups of the spaces involved and leveraging standard theorems from algebraic topology concerning connectivity, loop spaces, and smash products.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the spaces and the map:**\n    The map is given as $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    *   **Source Space (A):** $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Here, $\\Omega S^n$ denotes the loop space of the n-sphere, $\\wedge$ is the smash product, and $\\Sigma$ is the reduced suspension.\n    *   **Target Space (B):** $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. The smash product of two spheres is another sphere: $S^m \\wedge S^n \\simeq S^{m+n}$. Therefore, the target space is homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$. So we consider the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\n2.  **Determine the connectivity of the spaces:**\n    The connectivity of a space $X$ is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i(X)$ are trivial for $i \\le k$.\n    *   **Connectivity of Loop Spaces:** For a sphere $S^n$ (which is $(n-1)$-connected), its loop space $\\Omega S^n$ is $(n-2)$-connected, since $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^n) \\cong \\pi_{i+1}(S^n)$.\n        *   $S^4$ is 3-connected, so $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected.\n        *   $S^6$ is 5-connected, so $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected.\n    *   **Connectivity of a Smash Product:** If $X$ is $m$-connected and $Y$ is $n$-connected, their smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is $(m+n+1)$-connected.\n        *   Therefore, the space $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2 + 4 + 1) = 7$-connected.\n    *   **Connectivity of the Source Space (A):** The suspension of an $k$-connected space is $(k+1)$-connected.\n        *   Since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, the source space $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected.\n    *   **Connectivity of the Target Space (B):** The target space is $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n        *   $S^{10}$ is 9-connected.\n        *   Therefore, the target space $B = \\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2) = 8$-connected.\n\n3.  **Determine the connectivity of the map:**\n    The connectivity of a map $f: A \\to B$ is the integer $k$ such that the homotopy fiber of $f$, denoted $F_f$, is $(k-1)$-connected. The fiber fits into a long exact sequence of homotopy groups:\n    ... $\\to \\pi_{i+1}(B) \\to \\pi_i(F_f) \\to \\pi_i(A) \\xrightarrow{f_*} \\pi_i(B) \\to \\pi_{i-1}(F_f) \\to$ ...\n\n    *   Both the source space $A$ and the target space $B$ are 8-connected. This means their homotopy groups are trivial up to and including degree 8.\n    *   From the long exact sequence, for $i \\le 8$, we have the segment: $\\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B) \\to \\pi_{i-1}(F_f)$. This is $0 \\to 0 \\to \\pi_{i-1}(F_f)$, which does not constrain $\\pi_{i-1}(F_f)$.\n    *   Looking at a different segment for $i \\le 8$: $\\pi_i(B) \\to \\pi_{i-1}(F_f) \\to \\pi_{i-1}(A)$. Since $\\pi_i(B)=0$ and $\\pi_{i-1}(A)=0$ for $i \\le 9$ (so $i-1 \\le 8$), we get $0 \\to \\pi_{i-1}(F_f) \\to 0$. This implies $\\pi_{i-1}(F_f) = 0$ for $i \\le 9$, which means $\\pi_j(F_f)=0$ for $j \\le 8$. So, the fiber $F_f$ is at least 8-connected.\n    *   To determine the precise connectivity, we must look at the first non-trivial homotopy groups. This occurs at dimension 9 for both the source and target. Let's analyze the sequence at $i=9$:\n        $\\dots \\to \\pi_9(A) \\xrightarrow{f_*} \\pi_9(B) \\to \\pi_8(F_f) \\to \\pi_8(A) \\to \\dots$\n        Since $\\pi_8(A)=0$, exactness implies that $\\pi_8(F_f)$ is the cokernel of the map $f_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$.\n    *   **Calculating the first non-trivial groups:**\n        *   **For the source (A):** By the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Since $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, the Hurewicz theorem applies, giving $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. By the KÃ¼nneth formula for smash products, $H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\tilde{H}_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes \\tilde{H}_5(\\Omega S^6)$. Using the fact that $\\tilde{H}_k(\\Omega S^n) \\cong \\tilde{H}_{k+1}(S^n)$, we get $\\tilde{H}_4(S^4) \\otimes \\tilde{H}_6(S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. So, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n        *   **For the target (B):** $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) \\cong \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   The map $f$ is related to the Samelson product or James-Hopf invariant. It is a standard result in homotopy theory that this map induces an isomorphism on the first non-trivial homotopy group. That is, $f_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$ is an isomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Since $f_*$ is an isomorphism, its cokernel is the trivial group. Therefore, $\\pi_8(F_f)=0$. This confirms the fiber is 8-connected.\n    *   Now we examine the next dimension to see if the fiber is 9-connected. The long exact sequence gives:\n        $\\pi_{10}(B) \\to \\pi_9(F_f) \\to \\pi_9(A) \\xrightarrow{\\cong} \\pi_9(B)$\n        Because the map $\\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$ is an isomorphism, exactness implies that the map $\\pi_9(F_f) \\to \\pi_9(A)$ must be the zero map, and the map $\\pi_{10}(B) \\to \\pi_9(F_f)$ must be a surjection.\n    *   We have $\\pi_{10}(B) = \\pi_{10}(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10})$. The first stable homotopy group of spheres is $\\pi_1^S = \\pi_{n+1}(S^n)$ for large $n$, which is $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. So, $\\pi_{11}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   Thus, there is a surjection $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\to \\pi_9(F_f)$. To determine if $\\pi_9(F_f)$ is zero or $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ requires a more detailed analysis of the map on $\\pi_{10}$, related to higher-order Whitehead products or Toda brackets. Advanced results in this area show that the map $f_*$ on $\\pi_{10}$ is not an isomorphism, leading to $\\pi_9(F_f)$ being non-trivial. Specifically, it can be shown that $\\pi_9(F_f) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The fiber $F_f$ has $\\pi_i(F_f) = 0$ for $i \\le 8$, but $\\pi_9(F_f) \\neq 0$. This means the fiber is 8-connected. The connectivity of the map is defined as $k$ where the fiber is $(k-1)$-connected.\n    Since the fiber is 8-connected, the connectivity of the map is $8+1=9$.\n\nThe map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is **9-connected**.\n\n<<<9>>>"
