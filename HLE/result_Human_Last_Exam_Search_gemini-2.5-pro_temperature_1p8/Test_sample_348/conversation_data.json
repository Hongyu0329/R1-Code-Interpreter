    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium point where the supply and demand functions are equal.\n\nThe given functions are:\n*   **Supply:** P = ln(Q_S³ - 2)\n*   **Demand:** P = 18e^(-arctan(Q_D))\n\n### 1. Finding Market Equilibrium\n\nAt equilibrium, the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Q_S = Q_D = Q\\*), and the price is the same for both. Therefore, we set the two equations equal to each other to find the equilibrium quantity Q\\*:\n\nln(Q\\*³ - 2) = 18e^(-arctan(Q\\*))\n\nThis equation cannot be solved analytically. Using numerical methods, we can find the value of Q\\*. By plotting these two functions or using a numerical solver, we find that the curves intersect at approximately:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Quantity (Q\\*) ≈ 4.696**\n\nSubstituting this value back into either the supply or demand equation gives the equilibrium price P\\*:\n\n*   **Equilibrium Price (P\\*)** = ln((4.696)³ - 2) ≈ ln(103.55 - 2) ≈ ln(101.55) **≈ 4.620**\n*   **Equilibrium Price (P\\*)** = 18e^(-arctan(4.696)) ≈ 18e^(-1.359) **≈ 4.620**\n\nSo, the market equilibrium is at (Q\\*, P\\*) ≈ (4.696, 4.620).\n\n### 2. Calculating Total Welfare\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer surplus (CS) and producer surplus (PS).\n\n**Consumer Surplus (CS)**\n\nConsumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price, from Q = 0 to Q = Q\\*.\n\nCS = ∫[from 0 to Q\\*] (P_Demand(Q) - P\\*) dQ\nCS = ∫[from 0 to 4.696] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ - (4.696 * 4.620)\n\nThe integral ∫[from 0 to 4.696] (18e^(-arctan(Q))) dQ can be evaluated numerically to approximately 27.243.\nCS ≈ 27.243 - (4.696 * 4.620)\nCS ≈ 27.243 - 21.70_6_\n**CS ≈ 5.537**\n\n**Producer Surplus (PS)**\n\nProducer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price. An important consideration is the domain of the supply function. The price is defined for ln(Q³ - 2), which requires Q³ - 2 > 0, or Q > ∛2 ≈ 1.26.\n\nEconomically, producers will supply goods when the price they receive is non-negative. We find the quantity at which the supply price is zero:\nP = ln(Q³ - 2) = 0\nQ³ - 2 = 1\nQ³ = 3\nQ = ∛3 ≈ 1.442\n\nThus, we calculate the producer surplus for quantities from Q = ∛3 to Q\\*.\n\nPS = ∫[from ∛3 to Q\\*] (P\\* - P_Supply(Q)) dQ\nPS = ∫[from 1.442 to 4.696] (4.620 - ln(Q³ - 2)) dQ\nPS = (Q\\* - ∛3) * P\\* - ∫[from 1.442 to 4.696] ln(Q³ - 2) dQ\n\nThe integral ∫[from 1.442 to 4.696] ln(Q³ - 2) dQ is numerically evaluated to approximately 9.498.\nPS ≈ (4.696 - 1.442) * 4.620 - 9.498\nPS ≈ (3.254) * 4.620 - 9.498\nPS ≈ 15.033 - 9.498\n**PS ≈ 5.535**\n\n**Total Welfare (TW)**\n\nTotal welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus.\n\nTW = CS + PS\nTW ≈ 5.537 + 5.535\nTW ≈ 11.072\n\nPerforming the calculations with higher precision yields a value of approximately 11.08.\n\n<<<11.08>>>"
