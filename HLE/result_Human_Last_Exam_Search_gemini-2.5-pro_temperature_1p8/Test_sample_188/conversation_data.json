  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "The problem presented is a logic puzzle that requires identifying the relevant pieces of information to determine the maximum possible length of a secret message.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:\n\n1.  **Identify the Encrypted Medium:** The message is hidden within the \"Ching,\" which contains exactly 9999 symbols. These symbols are the carriers of the encrypted information.\n2.  **Identify the Message's Alphabet:** The secret message is written using the characters from the \"Shu.\" The Shu uses a vocabulary of 120 unique characters. This set of 120 characters forms the alphabet for the decrypted message.\n3.  **Determine the Encoding that Maximizes Length:** To find the *maximum possible length* of the message, one must assume the most efficient encoding scheme possible. In information theory, the way to maximize the length of a message encoded in a sequence of symbols is to have a one-to-one correspondence between a single symbol and a single character of the message.\n    *   If more than one symbol from the Ching were used to represent one character of the message, the total message length would be shorter (e.g., if 2 symbols = 1 character, the message would be 9999 / 2 â‰ˆ 4999 characters long).\n    *   It is not possible for a single, discrete symbol to encode more than one character of the message without additional, unstated rules or complexity.\n4.  **Calculate the Maximum Length:** By using the most efficient, length-maximizing encoding (1 symbol = 1 character), the 9999 symbols in the Ching directly translate to 9999 characters in the secret message.\n5.  **Evaluate Extraneous Information:** The other details provided in the prompt are designed to be distractors and are not needed for the final calculation:\n    *   The total number of characters in the Shu (around 3000).\n    *   The time taken for character recognition (12 ms).\n    *   The computation time for operations (10 ns and 30 ns).\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible length of the secret message is equal to the number of symbols available to encode it.\n\n<<<9999>>>"
