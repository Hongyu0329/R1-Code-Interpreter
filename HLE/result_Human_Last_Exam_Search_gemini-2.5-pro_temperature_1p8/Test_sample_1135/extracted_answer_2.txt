In the CCSD method, the matrix elements of the form $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are also zero for all quintuply, sextuply, and higher excited Slater determinants. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the electronic Hamiltonian contains at most two-body interactions, which causes the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\bar{H}$, to terminate. As a result, the application of $\bar{H}$ to the reference determinant can generate determinants with at most four excitations, leading to zero matrix elements for any higher level of excitation.
