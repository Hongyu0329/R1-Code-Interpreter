    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The major product of this reaction is 1-methylcyclohexene. Here is a detailed explanation of why this product is formed:\n\n### Reactants and Conditions:\n*   **Substrate**: (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The (1S,2R) stereochemistry indicates that the bromo and methyl groups are *cis* to each other.\n*   **Reagent**: Potassium tert-butoxide (KOC(CH₃)₃) is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent**: Tert-butyl alcohol is the conjugate acid of the base and serves as the solvent.\n*   **Reaction Type**: These conditions—a secondary alkyl halide with a strong, bulky base—strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n### Stereochemical Requirement for E2 Reactions:\nThe E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbon with the leaving group) and the leaving group (bromine) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means both the hydrogen and the leaving group must be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one up, one down).\n\n### Analysis of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane Conformations:\nSince the bromo and methyl groups are *cis* in (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, we can draw two possible chair conformations that are in equilibrium:\n1.  **Conformation A**: Bromine is in an **axial** position, and the methyl group is in an **equatorial** position.\n2.  **Conformation B**: Bromine is in an equatorial position, and the methyl group is in an axial position.\n\nThe E2 reaction can only proceed from **Conformation A**, where the leaving group (bromine) is in the required axial position.\n\n### Identifying Possible Products:\nFrom Conformation A (with axial Br), we look for beta-hydrogens that are also in an axial position. There are two such types of hydrogens:\n*   **On Carbon 2 (C2)**: This carbon has the equatorial methyl group, so its hydrogen is in an axial position. Elimination of this hydrogen would create a double bond between C1 and C2, forming **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is a disubstituted alkene and is considered the **Hofmann product** (the less substituted alkene).\n*   **On Carbon 6 (C6)**: This carbon has two hydrogens, one of which is axial. Elimination of this axial hydrogen would create a double bond between C1 and C6, forming **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is a trisubstituted alkene and is considered the **Zaitsev product** (the more substituted and generally more stable alkene).\n\n### Predicting the Major Product:\nThe choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann products depends on the base used. Typically:\n*   **Small bases** (like ethoxide) favor the more stable Zaitsev product.\n*   **Bulky bases** (like potassium tert-butoxide) favor the Hofmann product because they preferentially attack the less sterically hindered beta-hydrogen.\n\nHowever, we must consider the specific stereochemistry of this substrate. In the reactive conformation (Conformation A), the base must choose between the axial hydrogen on C2 and the axial hydrogen on C6.\n\n*   The hydrogen on C2 is on a carbon that also holds an equatorial methyl group.\n*   The hydrogen on C6 is part of a -CH₂- group and is considered more sterically accessible.\n\nThe bulky tert-butoxide base will preferentially abstract the sterically less hindered proton, which is the axial hydrogen on C6. The removal of the C6 proton leads to the formation of **1-methylcyclohexene**, the Zaitsev product.\n\nTherefore, in this specific case, the use of a bulky base leads to the formation of the more stable Zaitsev product because the proton leading to its formation is the most sterically accessible of the two available anti-periplanar protons. For the *cis*-isomer, the Zaitsev product is the expected major product.\n\nThe name of the product is **1-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<1-methylcyclohexene>>>"
