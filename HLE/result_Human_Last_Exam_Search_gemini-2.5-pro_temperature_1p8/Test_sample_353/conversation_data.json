    "The exact value of the A(Î±) stability angle for the BDF4 method has been determined in research by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis and later simplified by Gander and Wanner. The calculation involves finding the maximum angle $\\alpha$ such that the stability region of the BDF4 method contains the sector $S_\\alpha = \\{ \\mu \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-\\mu)| \\le \\alpha, \\mu \\ne 0 \\}$. This angle is determined by the tangent from the origin to the boundary of the stability region.\n\nThe exact value is given by the expression:\n$\\alpha_4 = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(25+\\frac{1519}{\\sqrt{658933}}\\right) \\sqrt{8525+155\\sqrt{2033}}-849}\\right)$\n\nWhile the full expression is complex, this leads to an approximate value of $\\alpha_4 \\approx 73.35^\\circ$. The expression in terms of the arctangent function provides the precise mathematical value.\n\nTo provide the final answer in the requested format:\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(25+\\frac{1519}{\\sqrt{658933}}\\right) \\sqrt{8525+155\\sqrt{2033}}-849}\\right)$\n\n<<<$\\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(25+\\frac{1519}{\\sqrt{658933}}\\right) \\sqrt{8525+155\\sqrt{2033}}-849}\\right)$>>>"
