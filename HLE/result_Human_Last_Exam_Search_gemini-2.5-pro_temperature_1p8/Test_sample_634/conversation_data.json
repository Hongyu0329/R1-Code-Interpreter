    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [s^2 + s, -s;\n-s^2 - 1, s^2]\nand\nP2 = [s, 0;\n-s - 1, 1].\n\nWe can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices. This involves forming a stacked matrix and reducing it to a specific form using elementary row operations.\n\n1.  **Form the composite matrix M:**\n    We stack P1 and P2 to form a single 4x2 matrix M:\n    M =\n    [ s^2 + s,  -s     ]  (Row 1)\n    [ -s^2 - 1,   s^2    ]  (Row 2)\n    [ s      ,   0      ]  (Row 3)\n    [ -s - 1   ,   1      ]  (Row 4)\n\n2.  **Perform elementary row operations to reduce the matrix.**\n    The goal is to transform the matrix M by left-multiplication with a unimodular matrix into the form [G; 0], where G will be the GCRD. The elementary row operations are equivalent to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix.\n\n    We can use Row 4 to eliminate the entries in the second column of Row 1 and Row 2 because it has a '1'.\n\n    *   Replace Row 1 with (Row 1 + s * Row 4):\n        (Row 1') = [s^2 + s, -s] + s*[-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s] =\n\n    *   Replace Row 2 with (Row 2 - s^2 * Row 4):\n        (Row 2') = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2*[-s - 1, 1] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, s^2 - s^2] = [s^3 - 1, 0]\n\n    The matrix M now becomes M':\n    M' =\n    [ 0      ,   0      ]\n    [ s^3 - 1,   0      ]\n    [ s      ,   0      ]\n    [ -s - 1 ,   1      ]\n\n3.  **Continue with row operations on M'.**\n    We can simplify the rows with the polynomial Euclidean algorithm on the non-zero entries in the first column, which are `s^3 - 1` and `s`. The greatest common divisor of `s^3 - 1` and `s` is 1. We can achieve a row `[1, 0]` through linear combinations.\n\n    *   Replace Row 2' with (Row 2' - s^2 * Row 3'):\n        (Row 2'') = [s^3 - 1, 0] - s^2*[s, 0] = [s^3 - 1 - s^3, 0] = [-1, 0]\n\n    The matrix becomes M'':\n    M'' =\n    [ 0      ,   0      ]\n    [ -1     ,   0      ]\n    [ s      ,   0      ]\n    [ -s - 1 ,   1      ]\n\n4.  **Use the new Row 2'' to eliminate other entries in the first column.**\n    *   Replace Row 3'' with (Row 3'' + s * Row 2''):\n        (Row 3''') = [s, 0] + s*[-1, 0] = [s - s, 0] =\n\n    *   Replace Row 4'' with (Row 4'' + (-s - 1) * Row 2''):\n        (Row 4''') = [-s - 1, 1] + (-s - 1)*[-1, 0] = [-s - 1 + s + 1, 1] =\n\n    The matrix is now:\n    M''' =\n    [ 0,  0 ]\n    [ -1, 0 ]\n    [ 0,  0 ]\n    [ 0,  1 ]\n\n5.  **Rearrange the rows.**\n    By swapping rows, we can bring the non-zero rows to the top.\n    Final Matrix =\n    [ -1, 0 ]\n    [  0, 1 ]\n    [  0, 0 ]\n    [  0, 0 ]\n\nThis procedure has reduced the matrix [P1; P2] to the form [G; 0], where:\nG = [-1, 0;\n      0, 1]\n\nThe matrix G is a greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2. The GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant).\n\nThe determinant of G is `(-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1`, which is a non-zero constant. Thus, G is a unimodular matrix. Since any unimodular matrix multiplied by G is also a GCRD, we can choose a simpler form. For example, if we multiply G by itself:\n[-1, 0; 0, 1] * [-1, 0; 0, 1] = [1, 0; 0, 1] = I (The Identity Matrix)\n\nThe identity matrix I is also a GCRD. When the GCRD of two polynomial matrices is a unimodular matrix, the matrices are said to be relatively right prime.\n\n<<<[1, 0; 0, 1]>>>"
