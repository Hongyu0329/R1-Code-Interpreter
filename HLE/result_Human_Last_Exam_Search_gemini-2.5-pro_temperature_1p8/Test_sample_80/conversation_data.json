    "There are 28 edge squares on a chessboard. This is calculated by adding the squares on each of the four sides (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) and subtracting the four corner squares that are counted twice, which is 32 - 4 = 28. Alternatively, one can count the 8 squares of the top and bottom rows and the 6 squares on the left and right sides (excluding the corners), which is 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28.\n\nBishops move diagonally and can only attack pieces on squares of the same color. Therefore, the placement of bishops on white squares and black squares can be considered independently. The 28 edge squares of a chessboard are evenly divided into 14 white squares and 14 black squares.\n\nThe objective is to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on these 28 squares. The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on an entire 8x8 chessboard is 14. If a configuration can be found where all 14 of these bishops are on edge squares, this would be the maximum possible.\n\nSuch a configuration is possible. We can place 7 non-attacking bishops on the white edge squares and 7 non-attacking bishops on the black edge squares, for a total of 14.\n*   **On the 14 white edge squares**, we can place bishops on: b1, d1, f1, h1, c8, e8, and g8. These 7 bishops do not attack each other.\n*   **On the 14 black edge squares**, we can place bishops on: a1, c1, e1, g1, b8, d8, and f8. These 7 bishops also do not attack one another.\n\nSince bishops on white squares cannot attack those on black squares, this set of 14 bishops is a valid arrangement where none of the pieces can attack another. As the theoretical maximum number of non-attacking bishops on a chessboard is 14, it is not possible to place more.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is 14.\n\nTo find the number of edge squares that would lack bishops, we subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares:\n\nNumber of empty edge squares = Total edge squares - Maximum bishops placed\nNumber of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14\n\nThus, if two people succeeded in placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares of a chessboard, 14 edge squares would be left without bishops.\n\n<<<14>>>"
