    "In Major League Baseball (MLB), there are two types of Triple Crowns a player can achieve: one for batters and one for pitchers. The number of players who have accomplished this feat varies depending on whether statistics from the Negro Leagues, which are now recognized as Major Leagues, are included.\n\nThe **batting Triple Crown** is awarded to a player who leads their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season. In the American and National Leagues, 17 different players have won the batting Triple Crown. However, with the inclusion of statistics from the Negro Leagues, the total number of unique batting Triple Crown winners is 20. Two players in the American or National Leagues, Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams, have won it twice, as have Negro Leagues stars Oscar Charleston and Josh Gibson. The most recent player to win the batting Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera in 2012.\n\nThe **pitching Triple Crown** is achieved by a pitcher who leads their league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA). In the history of the American and National Leagues, 22 pitchers have won the Triple Crown since ERA became an official statistic in 1913. When including the Negro Leagues and pre-1913 statistics, the total number of pitchers to win the Triple Crown is 35. Several pitchers have won it multiple times, including Grover Cleveland Alexander, Walter Johnson, and Sandy Koufax, who each won it three times.\n\nIn total, when combining the lists of batting and pitching Triple Crown winners, including those from the Negro Leagues, there are **53** unique players who have won a Triple Crown in MLB history.\n\n<<<53>>>"
