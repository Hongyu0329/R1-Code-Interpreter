    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor**, denoted as S(k, ω) in the nuclear criticality community and the broader field of condensed matter physics.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, also known as the time-dependent pair correlation function or the Van Hove correlation function, G(r,t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at a time **t**, given that another particle was at the origin at time t=0.\n\nThe relationship between the generalized pair correlation function and the dynamic structure factor is defined by a double Fourier transform, one over space and one over time. The spatial Fourier transform of G(r,t) results in the intermediate scattering function, F(k,t). Subsequently, the temporal Fourier transform of F(k,t) yields the dynamic structure factor, S(k,ω). This can be expressed as:\n\nS(k, ω) = (1/2π) ∫∫ G(r,t) *e*<sup>-i(k·r - ωt)</sup> dr dt\n\nIn the context of nuclear criticality, the dynamic structure factor is a crucial quantity. It is directly related to the double-differential scattering cross-section, which describes the probability of a neutron scattering from a material and changing its energy and momentum. This information is vital for accurately modeling the behavior of neutrons in a nuclear reactor or a critical system, as it determines how neutrons thermalize (lose energy) through interactions with moderator materials like light or heavy water.\n\nThe intensity of inelastic coherent neutron scattering experiments is directly proportional to the dynamic structure factor. This experimental technique is used to measure S(k, ω) for various materials, and the data is then used in nuclear data libraries and simulation codes, such as MCNP, which are essential tools for nuclear criticality safety analysis. The thermal scattering law, often denoted as S(α,β) in nuclear engineering, is essentially the dynamic structure factor expressed in dimensionless units of momentum (α) and energy (β) transfer.\n\nTherefore, the term \"dynamic structure factor\" is the standard and widely accepted name for the space-time double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function within the scientific community concerned with nuclear criticality.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
