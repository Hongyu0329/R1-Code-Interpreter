Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit a more robust and polyfunctional cytokine release upon antigen stimulation compared to T cells manufactured without it. This includes higher production of key effector cytokines like IFN-γ and TNF-α, which contributes to their enhanced anti-tumor activity. However, this may also be associated with a higher incidence of cytokine release syndrome.
