    "In 2024, the commonly used name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native North American range is \"fairy bees\". This name appears to have been adopted in recent years, with one of the earliest documented uses found in 2020.\n\nThe term \"fairy bees\" is now widely used in scientific and educational resources. For instance, a 2024 publication refers to *Perdita meconis* as the \"Mojave poppy bee,\" a species of fairy bee. Similarly, a 2023 podcast on indigenous bees also uses the term \"fairy bees\" for the genus *Perdita*.\n\nWhile the exact origin is not definitively documented in the available resources, a 2020 article notes that common names for many bee species are a relatively new development and not always standardized. There is also a suggestion that the name may have been popularized through social media, with one forum in 2022 mentioning a rumor that the name was coined on Twitter. Despite the uncertainty of its origin, \"fairy bees\" is the established common name for this genus.\n\n<<<fairy bees, 2020>>>"
