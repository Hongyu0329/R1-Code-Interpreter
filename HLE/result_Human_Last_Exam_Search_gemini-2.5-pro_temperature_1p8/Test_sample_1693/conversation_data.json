    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the oil tanker **Monique**.\n\nThe *Monique*, with a gross register tonnage (GRT) of 7,011 tons, was sunk by the German submarine U-65 on June 22, 1940. The unescorted tanker was hit by two torpedoes in the Bay of Biscay, about 70 miles southwest of Penmarch. The ship was carrying 10,000 tons of crude oil and was en route from Haifa to Le Havre, having been rerouted to Brest and then Belle-ÃŽle due to the German advance.\n\nA larger French vessel, the passenger liner **SS *Champlain***, with a gross register tonnage of 28,124 tons, was also lost during this period. However, the circumstances of its sinking are more complex. On June 17, 1940, the *Champlain* struck a German air-laid magnetic mine off La Pallice and subsequently sank. A few days later, on June 21, the wreck of the already sunken vessel was torpedoed by the German submarine U-65. Because the primary cause of the sinking was a mine and the U-boat's attack was on a vessel that was already lost, the *Monique* is considered the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat as the principal cause of its loss before the armistice.\n\nOther notable French naval losses during this period include the submarine *Doris* (525 tons), sunk by U-9 on May 8, 1940, and the cruiser *La Tour d'Auvergne* (formerly *Pluton*), which was destroyed by an internal explosion of one of its own mines on September 13, 1939, not by enemy action.\n\n<<<Monique>>>"
