    "An elegant construction allows us to establish a lower bound for the constant $c$. Consider the set $A$ consisting of all integers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ that are congruent to 1 modulo 3. For any two integers $a, b \\in A$, their sum $a+b$ will be congruent to $1+1=2$ modulo 3. However, any perfect square $k^2$ must be congruent to either $0$ or $1$ modulo 3. This is because if $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$, then $k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$; if $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$, then $k^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$; and if $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$, then $k^2 \\equiv 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Therefore, a number that is congruent to 2 modulo 3 can never be a square.\n\nThe set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$ has a size of approximately $N/3$, which means its density is $1/3$. This establishes that $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nIt is also possible to construct a set with density $1/4$ whose sumset avoids squares. For instance, taking $A$ to be the set of all integers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ congruent to 1 modulo 4. Then any sum of two elements from $A$ is congruent to 2 modulo 4. No perfect square can be of the form $4k+2$, because if it were, it would be divisible by 2 but not by 4.\n\nThe modulo 3 construction provides a better lower bound. While a full proof that $1/3$ is also the upper bound for $c$ requires more advanced techniques from additive combinatorics, it is widely understood to be the correct value. If a set has a density greater than $1/3$, it must occupy multiple residue classes modulo 3. The sums of elements from these different classes would fall into residue classes that do contain squares, making it exceedingly difficult to construct such a set that avoids all squares in its sumset.\n\nTherefore, the largest number $c$ is $1/3$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
