    "A \"Manhattan lattice\" is another term for the square lattice. The number of n-step self-avoiding walks, denoted as a(n), on this lattice has been a subject of extensive study. While there is no simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given n, its values for small 'n' have been computed and are well-documented.\n\nThe sequence of the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under the sequence number A001411. For n=10, the value provided is 44,100.\n\nThe initial terms of the sequence a(n) are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\nThese values are obtained through computational enumeration rather than a direct formula.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
