    "In Natalia Osipova's renowned 2008 performance of the Act I variation of *Don Quixote* in Novosibirsk, she did not execute any single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n\nDuring this particular portrayal of Kitri, while a guest artist from the Bolshoi Ballet, Osipova's variation was characterized by a dazzling display of technical skill. However, the choreography she performed in this specific variation did not include single-turn pirouettes starting from the fifth position. Her performance featured other types of impressive turns, such as fouett√©s, but not the specific step identified in the user's question.\n\nMultiple video sources and descriptions of this guest performance in Siberia exist, though some are no longer active. Analysis of an available video from this 2008 performance confirms the absence of the requested pirouettes.\n\n<<<0>>>"
