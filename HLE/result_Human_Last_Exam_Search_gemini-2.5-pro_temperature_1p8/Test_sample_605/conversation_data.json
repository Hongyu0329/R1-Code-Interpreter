    "Based on recent research in mathematical physics, the Crawley-Nordström invariant has been generalized to apply to 7-dimensional manifolds, such as the one described in the query. The \"Calabi-Yau Link\" in this context refers to the 7-dimensional link of a weighted projective Calabi-Yau threefold hypersurface singularity.\n\nThe specific Calabi-Yau threefold, defined by a polynomial in the weighted projective space with weights (22, 29, 49, 50, 75), is a known example. A 2024 paper titled \"Machine learning Sasakian and G2 topology on contact Calabi-Yau 7-manifolds\" explicitly lists this example, including the polynomial and its associated invariant. The computed value for the Crawley-Nordström (CN) invariant for this specific link is 35.\n\nThe polynomial provided is:\n$0=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$\n\nThe study machine-learned topological invariants, such as the Crowley-Nordström invariant, for a large dataset of these 7-dimensional Calabi-Yau links. For the given weights and polynomial, the invariant was calculated to be 35.\n\n<<<35>>>"
