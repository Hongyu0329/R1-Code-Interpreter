    "Following the rules of the cellular automaton Rule 110, starting from a single cell in state 1 and applying the rule for 20 successive iterations, results in a specific binary pattern.\n\nThe state of each cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its two immediate neighbors (left and right). The rules for Rule 110 are as follows, where the triplet represents the state of (left neighbor, current cell, right neighbor) and the result is the new state of the current cell:\n\n*   **111** → 0\n*   **110** → 1\n*   **101** → 1\n*   **100** → 0\n*   **011** → 1\n*   **010** → 1\n*   **001** → 1\n*   **000** → 0\n\nThis set of rules is encapsulated by the binary number 01101110, which is equal to the decimal number 110.\n\nStarting with an initial state of a single '1' cell surrounded by '0's, the pattern evolves with each iteration. The first few generations are:\n\n*   **Generation 0:** `1`\n*   **Generation 1:** `11`\n*   **Generation 2:** `111`\n*   **Generation 3:** `1101`\n*   **Generation 4:** `1111`\n*   **Generation 5:** `10001`\n\nContinuing this process for 20 iterations yields the following binary pattern:\n\n*   **Generation 20:** `10000101`\n\n<<<10000101>>>"
