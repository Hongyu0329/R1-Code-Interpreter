    "To identify the correct reading frame and translate the nucleotide sequence, the sequence was analyzed in all three possible forward reading frames. An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain a stop codon. Since the provided sequence is from the middle of an ORF, the correct frame will be the one that is free of stop codons. The three standard stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA.\n\nThe nucleotide sequence is:\n`ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nThe translation for each of the three reading frames is as follows:\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Reading begins with the first nucleotide (`g`).\n    *   `gga cat tgt tgt tag...`\n    *   This translates to `G C C S *...` (where `*` indicates a stop codon from `tag`).\n    *   This frame contains a stop codon and is therefore incorrect.\n\n*   **Frame 2:** Reading begins with the second nucleotide (`g`).\n    *   `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c`\n    *   This translates to `D I V V S E D L N G T V K F S S L P Y P N N L N S V L P A E R L E K W`\n    *   This frame does not contain any stop codons.\n\n*   **Frame 3:** Reading begins with the third nucleotide (`a`).\n    *   `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...`\n    *   This translates to `T L L L A K T *...` (where `*` indicates a stop codon from `tga`).\n    *   This frame also contains a stop codon and is incorrect.\n\nBased on this analysis, Frame 2 is the only open reading frame.\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVEVFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLPAERLEKW>>>"
