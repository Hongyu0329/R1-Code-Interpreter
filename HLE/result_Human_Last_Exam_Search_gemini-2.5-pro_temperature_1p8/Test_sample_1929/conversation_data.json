    "The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a type of pericyclic reaction known as a Diels-Alder reaction, or a [4+2] cycloaddition. In this reaction, the conjugated diene (butadiene) reacts with the alkene (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene), which acts as a dienophile, to form a six-membered ring.\n\nThe product of this specific reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step description of the formation of the product:\n1.  Butadiene (H₂C=CH-CH=CH₂) provides a system of four π electrons.\n2.  1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (Cl₂C=CF₂) provides a system of two π electrons.\n3.  During the reaction, the four carbons of butadiene and the two carbons of the ethene derivative combine to form a cyclohexene ring.\n4.  Two new single bonds (sigma bonds) are formed between the terminal carbons of butadiene and the carbons of the dichloro-difluoroethene.\n5.  The double bonds in butadiene are rearranged to form a single double bond within the new six-membered ring.\n6.  The chlorine and fluorine atoms remain attached to the carbons from the original ethene molecule.\n\nSince both reactants are symmetrical, there is only one possible product from this cycloaddition.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
