The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is the Seeley-DeWitt coefficient `a₂`. In four dimensions, its local density `a₂(x)` is given by `a₂(x) = (1/360) * ( -15 R_{;μ}^{;μ} - 4 R_{μν}R^{μν} + 5 R² + R_{μνρσ}R^{μνρσ} ) * I - (1/12) F_{μν}F^{μν}`, where `R` denotes curvature tensors and `F` is the gauge field strength.
