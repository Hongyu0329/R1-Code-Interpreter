    "To determine which flags of African nations share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag. When viewed as a matrix, and choosing distinct numerical values for each color to maximize its rank, the Danish flag has a rank of 2.\n\nThe Danish flag consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. Representing this pattern in a matrix, for instance with Red=1 and White=2, results in a matrix with two linearly independent types of rows and columns: those containing only red, and those forming the white cross which also contain red. Any row (or column) containing the white cross is linearly independent from a row (or column) with only the red field color, and all rows of the same type are linearly dependent. This structure consistently yields a rank of 2.\n\nTherefore, the task is to identify African flags whose designs, when represented as a matrix, also result in a rank of 2. Assuming colors are chosen to maximize rank, several simple flag patterns will produce a rank of 2:\n\n*   **Vertical Bicolors:** A flag with two vertical stripes of different colors. The matrix representing this flag will have two linearly independent columns, resulting in a rank of 2.\n*   **Horizontal Bicolors:** A flag with two horizontal stripes of different colors. The matrix will have two linearly independent rows, leading to a rank of 2.\n*   **Vertical Tricolors with Identical Outer Bands (A-B-A pattern):** A flag with three vertical stripes where the two outer stripes are the same color. This design has only two distinct types of columns, which are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.\n*   **Horizontal Tricolors with Identical Outer Bands (A-B-A pattern):** A flag with three horizontal stripes where the top and bottom stripes are the same color. This creates two types of linearly independent rows, giving a rank of 2.\n\nBased on this classification, the following African nations have flags with a linear algebraic rank of 2:\n\n*   **Algeria:** Features a vertical bicolor of green and white.\n*   **Benin:** Has a design with two horizontal stripes (yellow and red) next to a vertical green stripe. From a matrix perspective, this creates two unique and linearly independent rows, thus giving it a rank of 2.\n*   **Nigeria:** This flag is a vertical tricolor with green, white, and green stripes. This A-B-A pattern results in a rank of 2.\n\n<<<Algeria, Benin, Nigeria>>>"
