    "The ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. For a generic orientable surface of genus *g* with *b* boundaries (holes), the GSD is given by the formula `4^g * 2^(b-1)`.\n\nThe problem asks for the GSD of the toric code with *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes. This is typically modeled on a plane, which is topologically equivalent to a sphere with one large hole acting as the outer boundary.\n\nLet's analyze the setup on a plane. A plane itself has one boundary. Punching *n* smooth holes and *m* rough holes into this plane results in a surface with a total of `b = n + m + 1` boundaries. However, the type of the outer boundary also matters. The problem is often simplified by considering the number of logical qubits introduced by the holes.\n\nSeveral sources indicate that for a toric code on a plane (also known as a planar code), each additional hole or puncture can be used to encode one logical qubit. For example, a system with a total of *N* holes on a plane can encode *N* logical qubits, leading to a ground state degeneracy of 2<sup>N</sup>.\n\nIn this problem, we have a total of *N = n + m* holes. Following the principle that each hole on a plane contributes one logical qubit, the total number of logical qubits is *n + m*.\n\nTherefore, the ground state degeneracy is 2 raised to the power of the number of logical qubits.\n\nGround Space Degeneracy = 2<sup>(number of logical qubits)</sup> = 2<sup>(n+m)</sup>.\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice A. This result is based on the standard configuration of the surface code where qubits are encoded in the presence of punctures on a planar surface.\n\nThe ground space degeneracy of the toric code on a surface is given by the number of independent, non-trivial loop operators (logical operators) that commute with the Hamiltonian. For a planar geometry with a total of `n+m` holes, there are `n+m` such independent logical operators, each corresponding to a qubit.\n\nThus, the total ground state degeneracy is 2^(n+m).\n\n<<<A>>>"
