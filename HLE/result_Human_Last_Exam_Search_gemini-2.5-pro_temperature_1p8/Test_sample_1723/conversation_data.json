    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While several species of fungi are blue in color, the color of the mushroom itself does not determine the color of its spores.\n\nSpore prints are a crucial tool for mushroom identification, and their colors are generally in the range of white, cream, black, pink, or various shades of brown and purple. For example, the strikingly blue *Entoloma hochstetteri* has a reddish-pink spore print. Similarly, other blue-colored mushrooms like the Indigo Milk Cap (*Lactarius indigo*) and the Blue Roundhead (*Stropharia caerulea*) have yellowish-cream and purple-black spore prints, respectively. While some mushrooms, like certain species of *Panaeolus* and *Psilocybe*, can have flesh that bruises blue, their spore prints are typically black or purplish-brown. Green is considered a rare spore print color, but blue is not a recognized spore print color in mycology.\n\n<<<There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
