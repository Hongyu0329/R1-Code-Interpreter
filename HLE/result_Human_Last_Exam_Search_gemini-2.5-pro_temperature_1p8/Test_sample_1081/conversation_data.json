    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$. When the group $G$ is of type $E_8$, its Weyl group is denoted by $W(E_8)$. Since the group $G$ is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Frobenius morphism acts trivially on the Weyl group. Therefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is precisely the number of conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ has been computed and is known to be 112. This value is a fundamental result in the theory of Weyl groups and is independent of the underlying field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, as long as the group is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nThus, for a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
