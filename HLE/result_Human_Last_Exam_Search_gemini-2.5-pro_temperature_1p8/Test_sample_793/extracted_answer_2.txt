The highest concentration of an individual chemical reaching the spring is approximately **0.68 Âµg/L of PFOS**. The effect of the "mixture" at this concentration is **not applicable** because, due to decay and retardation, PFOS is the only chemical that reaches the spring in any measurable amount. There is no mixture present, and therefore no additive, synergistic, or antagonistic effect can occur.
