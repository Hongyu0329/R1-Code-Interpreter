    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three ethynyl (-C≡CH) substituents.\n\nTo determine its symmetry group, we analyze its structural features:\n1.  **Core Structure**: The core is a large, trigonal, planar nanographene fragment known as dibenzo[fg,ij]phenanthro[9,10,1,2,3-pqrst]pentaphene. This core itself is highly symmetric.\n2.  **Substituents**: Three ethynyl (C#C) groups are attached to the core. The SMILES notation indicates these are placed in a symmetric fashion, preserving the trigonal nature of the molecule. This arrangement maintains a high degree of symmetry.\n3.  **Planarity**: As a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, the molecule is planar.\n\nBased on this structure, we can identify its symmetry elements:\n*   **Principal Axis (C₃)**: There is a 3-fold rotational axis perpendicular to the plane of the molecule, passing through its center. A rotation of 120° leaves the molecule unchanged.\n*   **Perpendicular Axes (C₂)**: There are three 2-fold rotational axes in the plane of the molecule, each passing through the center and one of the ethynyl-substituted corners.\n*   **Horizontal Mirror Plane (σₕ)**: Since the molecule is planar, its molecular plane acts as a horizontal mirror plane.\n*   **Improper Rotation Axis (S₃)**: The combination of a C₃ axis and a σₕ plane implies the existence of an S₃ improper rotation axis.\n*   **Vertical Mirror Planes (σᵥ)**: There are three vertical mirror planes that each contain the principal C₃ axis and one of the C₂ axes.\n\nA molecule that possesses a principal Cₙ axis, n C₂ axes perpendicular to it, and a horizontal mirror plane (σₕ) belongs to the Dₙₕ point group. For this molecule, n=3.\n\nTherefore, the combination of a C₃ axis, three perpendicular C₂ axes, and a horizontal mirror plane (σh) places the molecule in the **D₃ₕ** point group.\n\n<<<D₃ₕ>>>"
