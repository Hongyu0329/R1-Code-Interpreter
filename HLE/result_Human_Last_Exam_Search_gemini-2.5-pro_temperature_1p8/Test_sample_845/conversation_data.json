    "The value between heartbeats used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is called the **Interbeat Interval (IBI)** or **R-R interval**.\n\nHRV is the measurement of the variation in the time between consecutive heartbeats. This time period between successive heartbeats is referred to as the Interbeat Interval (IBI). When HRV is measured using an electrocardiogram (ECG), this interval is specifically called the R-R interval, which refers to the time between the peaks of two consecutive R waves in the ECG's QRS complex. For data captured using photoplethysmography (PPG), the term Interbeat Interval (IBI) is more commonly used for the time between successive pulse waves. Both IBI and R-R interval are used to calculate HRV metrics.\n\n<<<Interbeat Interval (IBI) or R-R interval>>>"
