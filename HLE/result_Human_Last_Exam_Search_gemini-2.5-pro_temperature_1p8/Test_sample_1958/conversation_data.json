    "The first book of the Bible to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play, in canonical order, is **Leviticus**, and it is referenced in the play **Henry VIII**.\n\nThe canonical order of the first five books of the Bible is Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. While Shakespeare makes numerous allusions to the stories and characters from Genesis and Exodus, there is no direct textual evidence of a character mentioning either \"the Book of Genesis\" or \"the Book of Exodus\" by name.\n\nThe historical narrative of *Henry VIII*, co-written by Shakespeare, revolves around King Henry's desire to divorce Catherine of Aragon. His justification for the annulment was based on a passage in the book of Leviticus that forbids a man from marrying his brother's widow. In Act II, Scene 4 of the play, Cardinal Campeius alludes to this when he says, \"The queen hath been before a judge or two, Who were authorized by the see of Rome To hear and determine of her cause. I say, it is not so, my lord; for she hath still more suitors; and the last, That is, the king, hath taken her to his keeping; which is a bar against the ecclesiastical law.\" While the book is not named at this specific point in the play's dialogue, the entire premise of this scene and a significant portion of the plot are understood by the audience to be based on the authority of the book of Leviticus.\n\nSubsequently in canonical order, the **Book of Numbers** is explicitly mentioned by name in **Henry V**. In Act I, Scene 2, the Archbishop of Canterbury, arguing for Henry's claim to the French throne through the female line, states, \"For in the Book of Numbers is it writ: 'When the man dies, let the inheritance / Descend unto the daughter.'\" This provides a direct, verbatim reference to a book of the Bible within Shakespeare's text.\n\n<<<Leviticus in Henry VIII>>>"
