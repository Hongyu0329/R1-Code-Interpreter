    "To determine the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication of two matrices represented by a Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) tree of depth 4, we must analyze the recursive nature of the multiplication algorithm.\n\nAn HSS matrix can be recursively partitioned into a 2x2 block matrix:\n\n```\nA = | A_11  A_12 |\n    | A_21  A_22 |\n```\n\nHere, `A_11` and `A_22` are HSS matrices of a smaller size (one level less deep in the tree), and the off-diagonal blocks, `A_12` and `A_21`, are represented as low-rank matrices.\n\nThe multiplication of two HSS matrices, C = A * B, is defined by the standard block matrix multiplication formula:\n\n```\nC_11 = A_11 * B_11 + A_12 * B_21\nC_12 = A_11 * B_12 + A_12 * B_22\nC_21 = A_21 * B_11 + A_22 * B_21\nC_22 = A_21 * B_12 + A_22 * B_22\n```\n\nThis computation involves eight smaller matrix multiplications and four additions. The key is that the multiplications `A_11 * B_11` and `A_22 * B_22` are recursive calls to the HSS matrix multiplication algorithm on trees of a smaller depth. The other six multiplications involve at least one low-rank off-diagonal block.\n\nWe assume the HSS tree is a full binary tree. A tree of depth 4 has levels 0 (the root) through 4 (the leaves). The recursive HSS multiplication is performed at each non-leaf node.\n\nLet's count the number of submatrix \"accesses,\" which we interpret as the number of submatrix operands in all the multiplication operations throughout the hierarchy.\n\n*   **At Level 0 (root, depth 4):** The multiplication of the two main matrices is broken down. To do this, we need to access the 8 submatrices at Level 1 (A_11, A_12, A_21, A_22 from matrix A, and B_11, B_12, B_21, B_22 from matrix B). This one top-level operation generates two recursive HSS multiplications.\n\n*   **At Level 1 (depth 3):** There are 2 nodes at this level. The two recursive HSS multiplications from Level 0 are performed here. Each of these two multiplications requires accessing the 8 respective submatrices at Level 2.\n    *   Number of submatrices accessed at this level: 2 nodes * 8 submatrices/node = 16.\n\n*   **At Level 2 (depth 2):** There are 4 nodes at this level, resulting from the recursive calls at Level 1. Each of these four HSS multiplications requires accessing 8 submatrices from Level 3.\n    *   Number of submatrices accessed at this level: 4 nodes * 8 submatrices/node = 32.\n\n*   **At Level 3 (depth 1):** There are 8 nodes. Each of these HSS multiplications accesses the 8 submatrices at Level 4 (the leaf level). The submatrices at the leaf level are typically dense diagonal blocks and low-rank off-diagonal blocks.\n    *   Number of submatrices accessed at this level: 8 nodes * 8 submatrices/node = 64.\n\nThe total number of submatrices accessed is the sum of the accesses at each stage of the recursion:\n\nTotal accesses = (Accesses for Level 0 operation) + (Accesses for Level 1 operations) + (Accesses for Level 2 operations) + (Accesses for Level 3 operations)\nTotal accesses = 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 120.\n\nThus, a total of 120 submatrices are accessed during the matrix multiplication.\n\n<<<120>>>"
