    "## Unveiling the Connection: How the Bare Green's Function Depends on Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, exhibits a direct and fundamental functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵₖ. In its frequency-momentum representation, G₀(k, ω) is expressed as a sum over all single-particle states, where the energy eigenvalues appear in the denominator, dictating the poles of the function.\n\nThe precise form of the bare Green's function for a non-interacting system of fermions can be written using the Lehmann representation. For a given momentum k and frequency ω, the bare Green's function is:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = Σₙ |ψₙ(k)|² [ (θ(ϵₙ - μ)) / (ω - ϵₙ + iη) + (θ(μ - ϵₙ)) / (ω - ϵₙ - iη) ]**\n\nHere:\n*   **ϵₙ** represents the single-particle energy eigenvalues for the n-th state.\n*   **ψₙ(k)** is the wavefunction of the single-particle state in momentum space.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential, which distinguishes between occupied and unoccupied states at zero temperature.\n*   **θ(x)** is the Heaviside step function, which is 1 for x > 0 and 0 for x < 0.\n*   **η** is a positive infinitesimal, ensuring proper convergence and causality.\n\nThis expression reveals that the poles of the bare Green's function occur precisely at the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵₙ. The first term in the summation corresponds to unoccupied states (ϵₙ > μ), representing the propagation of a particle added to the system. The second term corresponds to occupied states (ϵₙ < μ), describing the propagation of a hole (the absence of a particle).\n\nEssentially, the bare Green's function G₀ acts as a propagator for a single particle in the absence of interactions. Its mathematical structure is therefore fundamentally determined by the energy spectrum of these non-interacting particles. The Feynman path integral provides a powerful framework for deriving this relationship by summing over all possible particle trajectories, and it serves as the foundation for introducing interactions perturbatively. The bare Green's function, with its explicit dependence on ϵₖ, is the starting point for calculating the full, interacting Green's function through Dyson's equation.\n\nIn simpler terms, if you know the allowed energy levels for a single, non-interacting particle, you can directly construct its bare Green's function, which encapsulates how this particle propagates through space and time. This makes the functional dependence of G₀ on ϵₖ a cornerstone of many-body quantum mechanics."
