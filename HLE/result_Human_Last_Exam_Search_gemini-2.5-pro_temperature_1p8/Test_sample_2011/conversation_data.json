    "The problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph with 128 vertices.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the key terms:\n*   A **clique** is a subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.\n*   An **induced subgraph** `G[S]` is formed by a subset of vertices `S` and all the edges that connect pairs of vertices in `S` within the original graph `G`.\n*   If a set of `k` vertices forms a clique, the subgraph induced by these vertices is a complete graph, `K_k`.\n\nThe question is to find the maximum possible number of distinct integers `k` for which a given graph `G` on 128 vertices has an induced subgraph isomorphic to `K_k`.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between cliques and their sizes in any graph `G`:\n1.  The set of possible clique sizes is determined by the cliques present in the graph `G`.\n2.  If a graph `G` contains a clique of a certain size, say `k`, then it inherently contains cliques of all smaller sizes from 1 to `k-1`. This is because any subset of the `k` vertices of the clique also forms a clique.\n3.  Therefore, the set of all possible clique sizes in any graph `G` is of the form `{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`, where `ω(G)` is the *clique number* of `G`. The clique number is the size of the largest clique in the graph.\n4.  The number of different clique sizes is thus simply `ω(G)`.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to determining the maximum possible clique number `ω(G)` for a graph `G` with 128 vertices.\n\nFor any graph `G` with `n` vertices, the size of any clique cannot exceed `n`. Thus, for a graph with 128 vertices, the clique number `ω(G)` is at most 128.\n\nTo achieve this maximum, we can consider the **complete graph** `K_128`. In a complete graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n*   The graph `K_128` has 128 vertices.\n*   Any subset of `k` vertices from `K_128` forms a `k`-clique. The subgraph induced by these `k` vertices is a `K_k`.\n*   Since we can choose any number of vertices from 1 to 128, `K_128` contains cliques of every size from 1 to 128.\n*   Therefore, the clique number of `K_128` is 128.\n\nThis means that in the complete graph `K_128`, there are induced subgraphs that are cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., up to 128. The total number of different clique sizes is 128. Since no graph on 128 vertices can have a clique number greater than 128, this is the maximum possible value.\n\n<<<128>>>"
