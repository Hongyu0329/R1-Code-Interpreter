In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` in the functional integral representation of the partition function is the integral of the field `ϕ` multiplied by the result of the operator `D_ϕ` acting on `ϕ` over the compactified Euclidean spacetime. For a free scalar field, this is explicitly given by: `(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^(D-1)x ϕ(τ, x) (-∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2) ϕ(τ, x)`, where `D_ϕ = -∂_τ^2 - ∇^2 + m^2` is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. This expression corresponds to twice the free part of the Euclidean action.
