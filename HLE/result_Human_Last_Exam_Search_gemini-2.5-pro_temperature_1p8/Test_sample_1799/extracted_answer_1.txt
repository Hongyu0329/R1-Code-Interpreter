It is not true that the second postulate is superfluous and can be deduced from the first without additional assumptions. The first postulate, the principle of relativity, is also compatible with Galilean relativity, which contradicts the second postulate. To derive the constancy of the speed of light, one must either assume the validity of Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism within the framework of the first postulate or introduce other fundamental assumptions about the properties of spacetime, such as homogeneity and isotropy.
