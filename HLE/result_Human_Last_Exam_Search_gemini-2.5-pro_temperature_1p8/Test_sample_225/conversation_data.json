    "The number of self-intersection points of a Lissajous curve defined by x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are integers, can be determined using a known formula. In this specific case, the parametric equations are x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t), so we have a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nFor a Lissajous curve of the form x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, the number of self-intersections can be calculated with the formula:\nN = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nHere, a = 9 and b = 5. First, we check if they are coprime by finding their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 9 and 5 is 1, so they are coprime.\n\nNow, we can apply the formula:\nN = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nN = (8)(4) / 2\nN = 32 / 2\nN = 16\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
