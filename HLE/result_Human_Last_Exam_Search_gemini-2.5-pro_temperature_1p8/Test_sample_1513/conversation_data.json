    "An island town that perfectly matches all the specified criteria—being more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island, situated on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name—does not appear to exist based on available information.\n\nSeveral remote islands were investigated, but none fulfill all the necessary conditions:\n\n*   **Tristan da Cunha**, the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, has its main settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, on a coastal plain and not within a caldera bay. The town and the island do not share a name.\n*   **Easter Island** (Rapa Nui) is another of the most isolated inhabited islands globally. Its main town, Hanga Roa, is situated on a bay but not inside a volcanic caldera. The names of the town, the island, and its significant calderas, like Rano Kau, are all different.\n*   **Santorini**, a Greek island, has villages built on the cliffs of a volcanic caldera, and the island itself is known as Santorini, along with the caldera. However, it does not meet the remoteness requirement as it is located approximately 200 kilometers from mainland Greece and 120 kilometers from Crete.\n*   **Deception Island** in Antarctica is a flooded volcanic caldera that forms a large natural harbor called Port Foster. Inside this harbor is a smaller bay named Whalers Bay, where a seasonally inhabited whaling station once operated. While extremely remote, this settlement is now abandoned, and the names of the island, the caldera bay (Port Foster), and the settlement's bay (Whalers Bay) are all different.\n\nWhile there are remote volcanic islands and islands with towns in calderas, none of the researched locations satisfy the unique combination of extreme isolation, a town situated on a bay created by a volcanic caldera, and a shared name for the town, bay, and caldera.\n\n<<<No such island town appears to exist.>>>"
