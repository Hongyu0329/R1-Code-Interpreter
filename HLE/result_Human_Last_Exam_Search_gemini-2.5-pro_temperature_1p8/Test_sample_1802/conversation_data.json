    "The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that acts on a $d$-dimensional qudit density matrix is $d^2$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of this result:\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel and its Kraus Operators:**\n    A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is described by the operator-sum representation:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$\n    where $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ are the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators), and $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution satisfying $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_k p_k = 1$. The Kraus operators for this channel can be written as $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$. A channel may have up to $d^2$ such Kraus operators if all $p_k$ are non-zero.\n\n2.  **The Complementary Channel:**\n    Given a channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}$, the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ describes the information that leaks to the environment. For an input state $\\rho$, the output of the complementary channel is a matrix $\\sigma = \\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho)$ whose elements are given by:\n    $\\sigma_{kl} = \\text{Tr}(\\rho A_k^\\dagger A_l)$\n    If the channel $\\Lambda$ is described by $K$ Kraus operators, the output matrix $\\sigma$ is a $K \\times K$ matrix.\n\n3.  **Rank of the Complementary Channel:**\n    The rank of the complementary channel can be understood as the maximum possible rank of its output matrix $\\sigma$, maximized over all possible input states $\\rho$ and all channels $\\Lambda$ within the Pauli class.\n    $\\text{Maximal Rank} = \\max_{\\Lambda \\in \\text{Pauli}} \\max_{\\rho} \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho))$\n    The rank of the $K \\times K$ matrix $\\sigma$ is at most $K$. To maximize this rank, we should first maximize the number of Kraus operators, $K$.\n\n4.  **Maximizing the Number of Kraus Operators:**\n    A Pauli channel can have up to $d^2$ Kraus operators, corresponding to the case where all $d^2$ probabilities $p_k$ are non-zero. Let's consider such a channel, for example, the completely depolarizing channel where $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, ..., d^2-1\\}$. For this channel, the Kraus operators are $A_k = \\frac{1}{d} U_k$. The output of the complementary channel will be a $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix.\n\n5.  **Achieving the Maximal Rank:**\n    Now we must find an input state $\\rho$ that maximizes the rank of the output matrix $\\sigma$. Let's choose the maximally mixed state, $\\rho = \\frac{1}{d}I$, where $I$ is the $d \\times d$ identity matrix.\n    The elements of the output matrix $\\sigma$ are:\n    $\\sigma_{kl} = \\text{Tr}\\left( \\left(\\frac{1}{d}I\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{d}U_k\\right)^\\dagger \\left(\\frac{1}{d}U_l\\right) \\right) = \\frac{1}{d^3} \\text{Tr}(U_k^\\dagger U_l)$\n    The generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_k\\}$ form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, which means they satisfy the property:\n    $\\text{Tr}(U_k^\\dagger U_l) = d \\cdot \\delta_{kl}$\n    where $\\delta_{kl}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    Substituting this orthogonality relation into the expression for $\\sigma_{kl}$, we get:\n    $\\sigma_{kl} = \\frac{1}{d^3} (d \\cdot \\delta_{kl}) = \\frac{1}{d^2} \\delta_{kl}$\n    This means the output matrix $\\sigma$ is a $d^2 \\times d^2$ diagonal matrix:\n    $\\sigma = \\frac{1}{d^2} I_{d^2}$\n    where $I_{d^2}$ is the $d^2 \\times d^2$ identity matrix. The rank of a diagonal matrix is the number of its non-zero diagonal entries. Since all $d^2$ diagonal entries are $1/d^2$, they are all non-zero.\n    Therefore, the rank of $\\sigma$ is $d^2$.\n\nSince the rank of the output matrix cannot exceed its dimension, which is $d^2$, and we have demonstrated a specific Pauli channel and input state for which this rank is achieved, the maximal rank is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
