    "The lowest of the final three notes for the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2, Op. 4\" is B-flat.\n\nThe first violin section concludes the symphony with a final B-flat major chord, played as a triple stop. The notes in this chord are B-flat, D, and a higher B-flat. Therefore, the lowest of these three notes is B-flat. The symphony is in the key of B-flat major, and this final chord provides a powerful resolution.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
