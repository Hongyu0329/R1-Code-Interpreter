    "The ideal Nickel to Cerium (Ni/Ce) ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance differs for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, studies indicate that the optimal nickel loading is generally in the range of 7% to 12.5%. Specifically:\n*   Catalysts with 10 wt % and 12.5 wt % nickel on ceria have demonstrated high carbon monoxide conversion rates. The highest conversion of 97.8% was achieved with a **12.5 wt % Ni/CeO₂ catalyst** at 400°C.\n*   In studies of the high-temperature WGS reaction, increasing the nickel loading from 1% to 8% by weight led to a significant improvement in catalyst performance.\n*   For the reverse WGS reaction, an optimum nickel proportion of **7% molar** was found, although a higher loading of 10% molar yielded similar results.\n\n### Water Splitting\n\nThe optimal Ni/Ce ratio for water splitting is more varied, with different ratios being ideal for the two half-reactions: the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER).\n\n*   **Overall Water Splitting:** A computational study has indicated that Ni-Ceria nanoparticles with a **3Ni/1Ce ratio** show favorable electronic properties and better catalytic potential for the water-splitting reaction.\n*   **Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER):** For the OER, which is a key step in water splitting, catalysts with atomic ratios of **Ni₇₅Ce₂₅ (a 3Ni/1Ce ratio)** and **Ni₅₀Ce₅₀ (a 1Ni/1Ce ratio)** have demonstrated the highest activity. The Ni₇₅Ce₂₅ catalyst also showed remarkable long-term stability.\n*   **Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER):** In the case of Ni₃N-CeO₂ catalysts on nickel foam, a **Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (a 1Ni/2Ce ratio)** was found to be optimal for HER performance.\n\nIn conclusion, a single ideal Ni/Ce ratio for both reactions does not exist. For the Water Gas Shift reaction, a nickel content of **~7-12.5%** is generally most effective. For water splitting, and particularly for the critical Oxygen Evolution Reaction, a **3Ni to 1Ce atomic ratio** appears to be highly promising.\n\n<<<For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the ideal Ni content is in the range of 7% to 12.5%. For water splitting, a 3Ni/1Ce atomic ratio (Ni75Ce25) has shown high performance for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER).>>>"
