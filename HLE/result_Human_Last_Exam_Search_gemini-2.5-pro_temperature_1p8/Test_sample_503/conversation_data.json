    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, when viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of the category of posets $\\mathsf{Pos}$, corresponds to an adjunction between posets. An adjunction between two posets, in this case $[m] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$ and $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, is a pair of monotone (order-preserving) maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $R: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint), satisfying the condition:\n$L(x) \\le y \\iff x \\le R(y)$ for all $x \\in [m]$ and $y \\in [n]$.\n\nFor a pair of maps to form such an adjunction, it is necessary and sufficient that one of the maps determines the other in a specific way. For our calculation, it is most convenient to count the number of possible left adjoints $L: \\to$.\n\nA monotone map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). Since $[m]$ is a finite lattice, it has a least element (bottom), which is $0$. The supremum of the empty set is defined as the bottom element. For $L$ to preserve suprema, it must map the bottom element of $[m]$ to the bottom element of $[n]$. This means $L$ must satisfy the condition $L(0)=0$.\n\nThis condition is also sufficient. Any monotone map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ satisfying $L(0)=0$ has a unique right adjoint $R$ given by $R(y) = \\max \\{x \\in [m] \\mid L(x) \\le y\\}$. The set on the right is never empty because $L(0)=0 \\le y$ for any $y \\in [n]$, so $0$ is always in the set. Since $[m]$ is finite, the maximum always exists. One can verify that this definition of $R$ results in a monotone map and that the pair $(L, R)$ satisfies the adjunction property.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of monotone maps $L: \\to$ that satisfy the condition $L(0)=0$. A monotone map from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is completely determined by the non-decreasing sequence of its values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(m)$.\n\nFor this problem, $m=23$ and $n=37$. We are looking for the number of sequences:\n$L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$\nsuch that $0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$, with the additional constraint that $L(0)=0$.\n\nThis fixes the first value in the sequence, so we only need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23 (for $L(1)$ through $L(23)$), where the values are chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. This set has $37 - 0 + 1 = 38$ elements.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using stars and bars. We are choosing 23 values from 38 possibilities with replacement, and the order is fixed by the non-decreasing condition. The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula $\\binom{k+N-1}{k}$, where $k$ is the number of items to choose and $N$ is the number of categories to choose from.\n\nHere, $k=23$ (the number of values $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ to choose) and $N=38$ (the size of the set of possible values $\\{0, \\dots, 37\\}$).\nThe total number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{23 + 38 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nThis number can also be understood as counting the number of all monotone maps from $$ to $$, which by the standard formula is $\\binom{37+22+1}{22+1} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions in $\\Delta$ from $$ to $$ is therefore $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<\n$\\binom{60}{23}$\n>>>"
