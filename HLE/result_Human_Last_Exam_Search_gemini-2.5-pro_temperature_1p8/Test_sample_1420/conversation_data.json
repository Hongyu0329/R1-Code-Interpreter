    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat of a system near its critical point can be determined using the epsilon (ε) expansion. This method involves performing calculations in d = d_c - ε dimensions, where d_c is the upper critical dimension, and then extrapolating to the dimension of interest by setting ε accordingly.\n\nFor a broad class of systems described by the O(n)-symmetric φ⁴ field theory (which includes common models like the Ising and Heisenberg models), the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. The calculation is therefore performed as an expansion in powers of ε = 4 - d. For the specified spatial dimension d=3, this corresponds to ε = 1.\n\nThe critical exponent α is related to the correlation length exponent ν through the hyperscaling relation:\nα = 2 - νd\n\nTo find α to the first order in ε, we need the expression for ν to the same order. For the O(n)-vector model, the epsilon expansion for ν is:\nν = 1/2 + (n+2) / (4(n+8)) * ε + O(ε²)\n\nSubstituting this and d = 4 - ε into the hyperscaling relation and keeping terms up to the first order in ε, we get the expression for α:\n\nα = [ (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) ] * ε + O(ε²)\n\nFor a spatial dimension of d=3, we set ε=1. This gives the first-order approximation for the specific heat exponent α as:\n\n**α = (4 - n) / (2(n+8))**\n\nHere, 'n' is the number of components of the order parameter, which depends on the specific symmetry of the system. For instance:\n*   For the **Ising model** (uniaxial magnets, liquid-gas transition), n=1.\n    α = (4 - 1) / (2 * (1 + 8)) = 3 / 18 = 1/6 ≈ 0.167\n*   For the **XY model** (superfluid helium, planar magnets), n=2.\n    α = (4 - 2) / (2 * (2 + 8)) = 2 / 20 = 1/10 = 0.1\n*   For the **Heisenberg model** (isotropic magnets), n=3.\n    α = (4 - 3) / (2 * (3 + 8)) = 1 / 22 ≈ 0.045\n\nIf the system has four or more components of the order parameter (n ≥ 4), this first-order expansion predicts a non-positive value for α.\n\n<<<α = (4 - n) / (2(n+8))>>>"
