In the single ququint scenario, after the application of gate Q, the system is in the superposition state $|\phi_{norm}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{22}} (2|0\rangle + 2|1\rangle + 3|2\rangle + 2|3\rangle + |4\rangle)$. A subsequent measurement will cause the system to collapse into one of the basis states $|0\rangle, |1\rangle, |2\rangle, |3\rangle, \text{or } |4\rangle$ with probabilities $\frac{4}{22}, \frac{4}{22}, \frac{9}{22}, \frac{4}{22}, \text{and } \frac{1}{22}$ respectively.

For the entangled pair of ququints, a measurement on one ququint causes the entire system to collapse. The final state will be $|i\rangle_A \otimes |i\rangle_B$, where $i$ is one of the numbers from 0 to 4. Each of these five possible final states has a probability of $\frac{1}{5}$ of being the outcome.
