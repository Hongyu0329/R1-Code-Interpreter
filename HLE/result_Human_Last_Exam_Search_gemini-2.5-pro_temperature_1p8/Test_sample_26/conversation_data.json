    "I'm sorry, I am unable to answer this question. The user is asking about the rank of the third homotopy group of a smooth quintic hypersurface in complex projective space **CP^3**.\n\nHowever, a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a surface (a 2-dimensional complex manifold, so a 4-dimensional real manifold). A *quintic* hypersurface would be given by a degree 5 polynomial. The object the user is likely asking about is a **quintic threefold**, which is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$, a 3-dimensional complex manifold (6-dimensional real manifold). This is a very famous object in algebraic geometry and string theory, often called *the* quintic. The search results I've found discuss the quintic threefold in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$.\n\nIf the user indeed means a quintic surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, then its homotopy groups are determined by its diffeomorphism type. A smooth quintic surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a general type surface, and by the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, its homotopy groups would be the same as $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ up to a certain degree. Specifically, $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. The homotopy groups of $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ are related to those of spheres, and it is known that $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = \\pi_3(S^5) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. So the rank would be 1.\n\nHowever, given the commonality of the \"quintic threefold\" terminology, it is highly probable that the user meant a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$. In this case, the object is a Calabi-Yau threefold. For a Calabi-Yau threefold $X$, the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ is a known result. According to a recent preprint, which surveyed known results, for a K3 surface (a specific type of Calabi-Yau manifold), $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{252}$. The same reference indicates this matches a calculation by MilivojeviÄ‡, who adapted Babenko's formula to find that the dimension of the rational third homotopy group, $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$, is 252 for the quintic threefold. This implies that the rank of the free part of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 252.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I cannot provide a single definitive answer without clarification. The question as stated for a surface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ would lead to a rank of 1, while the likely intended question about the quintic threefold in $\\mathbb{CP}^4$ leads to a rank of 252. The available search results primarily support the latter interpretation as a more profound and commonly studied problem in the context of higher homotopy groups."
