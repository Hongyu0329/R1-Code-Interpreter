    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, the character of Dr. Gibarian is the one most closely associated with both missing the sounds of Earth and the feeling of shame.\n\nWhile on the space station, several characters attempt to replicate the earthly sound of rustling leaves. Dr. Snaut explains that it was Dr. Gibarian's idea to attach strips of paper to the air vents to create this sound. Snaut himself adopted this practice, and he notes that even the cynical Dr. Sartorius secretly keeps one in his closet after making fun of the others for it.\n\nThe connection of shame to Gibarian is made explicit following his death. The protagonist, Kris Kelvin, states, \"Gibarian didn't die of fear. He died of shame.\" This sentiment is followed by the profound statement, \"Shame â€“ the feeling that will save mankind.\" Although the shame is tied to the broader human condition and the \"visitors\" sent by the Solaris ocean, it is Gibarian who succumbs to this feeling. His invention to mimic the sound of leaves, combined with his death being attributed to shame, makes him the character who was ashamed to miss such an element of his terrestrial home.\n\n<<<E>>>"
