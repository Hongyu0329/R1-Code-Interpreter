The greatest known number of initial cells in a recognized, named pattern that fits a 12x12 area and stabilizes to over 100 cells is 7 (from the Acorn pattern), though it is highly likely that more dense, computationally-derived patterns exist with a higher initial cell count that also meet these criteria.
