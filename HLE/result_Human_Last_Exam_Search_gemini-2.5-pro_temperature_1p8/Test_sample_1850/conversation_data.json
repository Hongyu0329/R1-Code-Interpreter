    "In John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost*, a specific count of named historical saints reveals a fascinating intersection of biblical narrative and Protestant theology. While the poem does not feature a wide-ranging hagiography in the Catholic tradition, it does mention a select number of individuals who are considered saints in Christian history. Based on a detailed review of the text, there are **at least nine** historical saints mentioned by name.\n\nThese figures can be categorized as follows:\n\n**New Testament Saint:**\n\n*   **Saint Peter:** The most direct mention of a non-angelic, post-Christ historical saint appears in Book III, in the description of the \"Limbo of Vanity.\" Here, Milton satirizes the belief that entry into heaven can be gained through earthly means, writing, \"And now Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket seems / To wait them with his Keys...\".\n\n**Angelic Saint:**\n\n*   **Michael:** The archangel Michael is a prominent character, leading God's army against Satan. He is referred to as a \"saint\" in the sense of a holy being of heaven and is a significant figure in Christian tradition as Saint Michael.\n\n**Old Testament Saints:**\n\nThe poem also alludes to revered figures from the Old Testament who are considered saints in the broader Christian tradition.\n\n*   **Enoch and Elijah:** In Book III, Milton speaks of the \"Limbo of Vanity,\" and in discussing the celestial bodies, he mentions that some believe the moon is home to \"translated saints,\" a clear reference to Enoch and Elijah, who were taken into heaven without dying.\n*   **Abraham, Moses, and David:** These patriarchs and prophets are presented as foundational figures in the history of salvation that the Archangel Michael recounts to Adam. While not explicitly called \"saints\" in the poem, their roles as righteous servants of God place them within this context.\n*   **Adam and Eve:** As the progenitors of humanity and central figures in the epic, their story is one of fall and promised redemption, positioning them as the first \"saints\" in the narrative of human history.\n\nMilton's use of these figures reflects his deep engagement with the Bible and Christian tradition, while his Puritan beliefs led him to avoid the extensive veneration of saints found in Catholicism. The reference to \"Saint Peter\" is particularly noteworthy for its critical tone, highlighting the theological divisions of the 17th century. The other \"saints\" mentioned are primarily biblical figures central to the Christian story of salvation.\n\n<<<9>>>"
