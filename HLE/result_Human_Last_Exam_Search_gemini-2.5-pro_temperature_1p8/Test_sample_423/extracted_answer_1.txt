**Structure of B**: Pentane-1,3,5-triol
**Structure of A**: 3-oxopentanedial (OHC-CH₂-CO-CH₂-CHO)
**Molecular Formula of X**: C₁₀H₁₂O₂
**Inferred structural features of X**: Contains an aldehyde group, a phenolic or enolic hydroxyl group, and at least one C=C bond. The structure is symmetric.
A single structure that satisfies all the conflicting data points cannot be determined with certainty. The core issue lies in reconciling the molecular formula of X (C₁₀H₁₂O₂) with the ozonolysis product A (C₅H₆O₃) under the rule that only a single product is formed.
