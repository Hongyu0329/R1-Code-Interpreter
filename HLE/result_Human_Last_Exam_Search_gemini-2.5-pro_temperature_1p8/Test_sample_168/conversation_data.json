    "An animal that might be able to hear human muscle twitches would need an auditory range that extends to very low frequencies.\n\nScientific studies on the sound produced by human muscle contractions have shown that these sounds occur at very low frequencies. Research indicates that the primary frequencies of a maximal muscle twitch are below 4 Hz, and that frequencies under 20 Hz make up at least 90% of the muscle sound wave's power. Other research on muscle stimulation uses frequencies ranging from 15 Hz to 100 Hz.\n\nNow, let's examine the hearing capabilities of the animals listed in the options:\n\n*   **A. Dog:** A dog's hearing range is typically between 67 Hz and 45,000 Hz. Since the lower end of their hearing is well above the primary frequency of a muscle twitch, it is unlikely they could hear it.\n*   **B. Bat:** Bats are known for their high-frequency hearing, which they use for echolocation. Their hearing range is generally between 1,000 Hz and 200,000 Hz. This is far too high to detect the low-frequency sounds of a muscle twitch.\n*   **C. Herring:** Some species of herring are known as \"hearing specialists\". Their hearing can extend down to very low frequencies, with some being sensitive to infrasound as low as 5 Hz. This range overlaps with the frequencies produced by human muscle twitches.\n*   **D. Whale:** The hearing range of whales varies significantly by species. Baleen whales, for instance, can hear very low-frequency sounds, with some species detecting sounds as low as 7 Hz. Toothed whales, on the other hand, hear at much higher frequencies, typically from 150 Hz to 160,000 Hz. While some whales could potentially hear muscle twitches, the term \"whale\" encompasses species with vastly different hearing abilities.\n*   **E. Human:** The standard range of human hearing is between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. As most of the sound from a muscle twitch is below 20 Hz, it falls outside the typical range of human hearing.\n\nBased on this comparison, the herring is a very strong candidate due to its specialized ability to hear the specific low-frequency sounds that characterize a human muscle twitch.\n\n<<<C>>>"
