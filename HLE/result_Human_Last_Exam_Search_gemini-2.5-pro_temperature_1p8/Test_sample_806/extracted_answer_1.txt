The specific biochemical reaction that initiated the process of skin blister development was a drug-induced, T-cell mediated cytotoxic reaction. This process begins when the medication or its metabolites lead to the activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. These activated immune cells then cause widespread death (apoptosis) of keratinocytes (skin cells) through the release of cytotoxic molecules, including granulysin and via the Fas-Fas ligand pathway.
