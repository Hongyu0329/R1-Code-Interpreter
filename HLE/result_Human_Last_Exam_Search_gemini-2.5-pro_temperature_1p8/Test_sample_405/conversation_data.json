    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in at least five different colors: white, red, violet, black, and yellow.\n\nPhosphorus has several allotropes, with the most common being white, red, and black phosphorus. Each of these can exhibit different observable colors.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This allotrope is a translucent waxy solid that is typically colorless or white. However, upon exposure to light, it can turn yellow due to its gradual conversion to the more stable red phosphorus. For this reason, it is also known as yellow phosphorus.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** The color of red phosphorus can vary significantly. It is most commonly described as having a deep red or reddish-violet color. Its color can range from orange-red to a dark red-purple. Some forms of red phosphorus can also exhibit an iron-grey lustre.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus. It has an appearance similar to graphite, being black and flaky. It can also be described as a grey crystalline solid.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this allotrope has a violet or purple color. Descriptions of its appearance also include brown transparent plates and a steely blue lustre. When ground into a very fine powder, violet phosphorus can appear red.\n*   **Other observable colors:** Descriptions of the various forms of phosphorus also include dark orange for violet phosphorus and a general \"orange\" for some types of red phosphorus.\n\nIn summary, the distinct colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\n*   White\n*   Yellow\n*   Red\n*   Violet/Purple\n*   Black\n\n<<<5>>>"
