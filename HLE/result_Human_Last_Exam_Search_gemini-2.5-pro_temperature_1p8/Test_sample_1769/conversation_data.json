    "Without the Norse invasions and subsequent linguistic influence, the Modern English word for a female sibling would likely have evolved from the Old English word *sweostor* and its common variant *swuster*. Following the natural phonetic developments of the English language, the word would most likely be **\"suster\"** (pronounced to rhyme with \"duster\") or possibly **\"soster\"**.\n\nThe Old English word for \"sister\" was *sweostor*. However, even in Old English, a variant form, *swuster*, was in use. The existence of this variant is significant as it shows a tendency for the \"eo\" diphthong to change, in this case to a \"u\" sound. This variant form, which simplifies the initial vowel sound, provides a strong basis for the word's likely evolution.\n\nBy the Middle English period, the form *suster* was indeed common, alongside other variations. The initial \"sw\" sound was often simplified to \"s\" over time, and the \"eo\" vowel sound in *sweostor* monophthongized, typically to an \"e\" sound. However, the prevalence of the *swuster* and later *suster* forms suggests that the \"u\" pronunciation was a dominant and natural progression for the word in many dialects.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" owes its form to the influence of the Old Norse *systir*. This Norse word reinforced the \"i\" vowel sound, which eventually became standard. Without this influence, the Middle English *suster* would have undergone subsequent sound changes, most notably the Great Vowel Shift. However, the short \"u\" sound in *suster* was largely unaffected by the Great Vowel Shift, which primarily altered long vowel sounds. Therefore, the vowel sound would likely have remained as /ʌ/, the \"u\" sound in words like \"cup\" or \"dull\".\n\nThe unstressed final syllable \"-or\" in Old English words often reduced to a schwa sound (/ə/) over time, represented by \"-er\" in modern spelling, as seen in words like *fæder* > father and *mōdor* > mother. Thus, *suster* would likely have evolved with this same ending.\n\nConsidering these linguistic changes, the native English word for a female sibling would have transitioned from Old English *sweostor*/*swuster* to Middle English *suster*, and then to a Modern English form that would be spelled **suster**.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
