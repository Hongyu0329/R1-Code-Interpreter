    "To determine the VC dimension of the set of formulas $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, we must first understand the structure of the formulas in this language and the concept class they define.\n\n**1. Analyzing the Schema and the Language**\n\n*   **Schema S**: The schema $S$ contains 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A unary predicate takes a single argument, so we can form atomic formulas like $P_i(x)$.\n*   **Language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is the fragment of First-Order Logic built over the schema $S$ using only the following logical symbols:\n    *   $\\exists$: Existential quantification\n    *   $\\land$: Conjunction (AND)\n    *   $\\top$: True\n    *   $\\bot$: False\n\n**2. Defining the Concept Class**\n\nThe VC dimension is defined for a class of \"classifiers\". In this context, the classifiers are the formulas of our language with one free variable, say $x$. Each such formula $\\phi(x)$ defines a set (a concept) in any given model (a universe of elements): the set of all elements $a$ for which $\\phi(a)$ is true.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of any formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in our language.\nSince all predicates ($P_1, \\dots, P_4$) are unary, there are no predicates that can relate two different variables, like $R(x, y)$.\n\nConsider a formula in our language. It can be a conjunction of simpler formulas. The simplest formulas are the atomic ones, $P_i(x)$, and the constants $\\top$ and $\\bot$. We can also have existentially quantified parts, like $\\exists y (\\psi(x,y))$.\n\nHowever, since there are no predicates that take two or more arguments, any subformula $\\psi$ involving a variable $y$ cannot also involve the free variable $x$ in a dependent way. A formula like $\\psi(x, y)$ must be equivalent to a conjunction of formulas about $x$ and formulas about $y$, i.e., $\\alpha(x) \\land \\beta(y)$.\n\nTherefore, an existentially quantified subformula looks like this:\n$\\exists y (\\alpha(x) \\land \\beta(y)) \\equiv \\alpha(x) \\land \\exists y (\\beta(y))$\n\nThe part $\\exists y (\\beta(y))$ is a *sentence* (it has no free variables). In any given model, this sentence is either true (equivalent to $\\top$) or false (equivalent to $\\bot$). Therefore, the existential quantifier $\\exists$ does not add expressive power to the formulas with one free variable, as its effect can be compiled down to $\\top$ or $\\bot$.\n\nThis means any formula $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula. The quantifier-free formulas are constructed from the atomic formulas $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$ and the constants $\\top, \\bot$ using only conjunction ($\\land$).\n\nThe set of concepts is therefore the set of all possible conjunctions of the four basic predicates. For any subset of indices $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, we can form the concept defined by the formula $\\phi_I(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$. The empty conjunction ($I = \\emptyset$) corresponds to $\\top$, which defines the entire universe. We can also define the empty set using $\\bot$.\n\nThis problem is now equivalent to finding the VC dimension of the class of concepts formed by all monotone conjunctions over 4 boolean attributes. It is a standard result that the VC dimension of this concept class is the number of attributes. Here, we have 4 predicates, which act as our 4 attributes.\n\n**3. Calculating the VC Dimension**\n\nThe VC dimension is the size of the largest set of points that can be shattered by the concept class.\n\n**Part 1: The VC dimension is at least 4.**\nTo show this, we need to construct a model with a set of 4 elements that can be shattered. Let the universe contain the set $X = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$. We must define the behavior of the predicates $P_1, \\dots, P_4$ on these elements. Let's define $P_j(a_i)$ to be true if and only if $i \\neq j$.\n\n*   $a_1$ satisfies $\\{P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$ but not $P_1$.\n*   $a_2$ satisfies $\\{P_1, P_3, P_4\\}$ but not $P_2$.\n*   $a_3$ satisfies $\\{P_1, P_2, P_4\\}$ but not $P_3$.\n*   $a_4$ satisfies $\\{P_1, P_2, P_3\\}$ but not $P_4$.\n\nWe must show that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, there exists a conjunction of predicates that is true for all elements in $Y$ and false for all elements in $X \\setminus Y$. Let $Y = \\{a_{i_1}, \\dots, a_{i_k}\\}$. Consider the formula $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\notin \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}} P_j(x)$. This formula is the conjunction of all predicates not corresponding to the indices of the elements in $Y$.\nFor example, let's select the subset $Y = \\{a_1, a_3\\}$. The corresponding formula is $\\phi(x) = P_2(x) \\land P_4(x)$.\n*   For $a_1$: $P_2(a_1)$ is true and $P_4(a_1)$ is true. So $\\phi(a_1)$ is true.\n*   For $a_2$: $P_2(a_2)$ is false. So $\\phi(a_2)$ is false.\n*   For $a_3$: $P_4(a_3)$ is true and $P_2(a_3)$ is true. So $\\phi(a_3)$ is true.\n*   For $a_4$: $P_2(a_4)$ is true but $P_4(a_4)$ is false. So $\\phi(a_4)$ is false.\nThis formula correctly selects $\\{a_1, a_3\\}$. This construction can be generalized to realize all $2^4 = 16$ subsets of $X$. Therefore, the set $X$ of size 4 is shattered, and the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Part 2: The VC dimension is at most 4.**\nLet's assume we can shatter a set $X = \\{a_1, \\dots, a_5\\}$ of size 5. For each element $a_i \\in X$, we can associate a binary vector $v_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}^4$, where the $j$-th component of $v_i$ is 1 if $P_j(a_i)$ is true, and 0 otherwise.\n\nSince we have 5 vectors in a 4-dimensional space $\\{0, 1\\}^4$, these vectors must be linearly dependent over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This means there exists a non-empty subset of these vectors, say $\\{v_{i_1}, \\dots, v_{i_k}\\}$, whose sum modulo 2 is the zero vector. Let this set of indices be $I \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, 5\\}$.\n\nLet $Y = \\{a_i \\mid i \\in I\\}$. Consider the subset $Y' \\subset Y$ containing only the elements corresponding to the first $|I|-1$ indices. Since we assume $X$ is shattered, there must be a formula $\\phi(x)$ that defines exactly the set $Y'$. This formula is equivalent to a conjunction of some predicates, say $\\phi(x) = \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_j(x)$ for some $J \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, 4\\}$.\n\nFor this formula to select $Y'$, it must be that for every $a_i \\in Y'$, $\\phi(a_i)$ is true, which means $(v_i)_j = 1$ for all $j \\in J$. Also, for the last element $a_k$ (where $k$ is the last index in $I$), $\\phi(a_k)$ must be false, so there exists some $j_0 \\in J$ such that $(v_k)_{j_0} = 0$.\n\nHowever, the linear dependence $\\sum_{i \\in I} v_i = \\vec{0} \\pmod 2$ means that for any coordinate $j$, an even number of vectors in $\\{v_i \\mid i \\in I\\}$ have a 1 at that coordinate. For any $j \\in J$, we know that $(v_i)_j=1$ for all the first $|I|-1$ elements. If $|I|-1$ is odd, then for the sum to be even, $(v_k)_j$ must be 1. If $|I|-1$ is even, $(v_k)_j$ must be 0. This cannot hold simultaneously for all $j \\in J$ and all subsets $Y'$, leading to a contradiction. A more formal proof shows that the sum of the rows corresponding to $Y'$ in the incidence matrix cannot be matched by any concept-defining vector.\n\nA well-known result from learning theory (related to the Sauer-Shelah lemma) states that the VC dimension of monotone conjunctions on $k$ variables is exactly $k$. In our case, $k=4$. Therefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered.\n\nSince the VC dimension is at least 4 and at most 4, it is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
