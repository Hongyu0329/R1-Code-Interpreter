    "When the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is reacted with *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), a dinuclear complex is formed. This resulting complex exists as a mixture of two diastereoisomers.\n\nThe ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole acts as a bridging ligand, connecting two ruthenium centers. Each ruthenium atom retains its two bipyridine ligands, forming a chiral [Ru(bpy)2] unit. The *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) starting material is itself chiral, existing as two enantiomers (Δ and Λ).\n\nThe combination of two such chiral ruthenium centers linked by the bridging ligand leads to the formation of two diastereomeric products:\n\n*   **A meso form:** This isomer has opposite chirality at the two metal centers (Δ/Λ) and possesses a center of inversion.\n*   **A racemic form:** This is a mixture of two enantiomers, one with two Δ centers (Δ/Δ) and the other with two Λ centers (Λ/Λ). This form has a two-fold rotation axis.\n\nThese two diastereomers, the meso and the racemic pair, are distinct chemical compounds and can be separated, for instance, by cation exchange chromatography. Therefore, two isomers are formed in this reaction.\n\n<<<2>>>"
