    "While the specific protein target for the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817 is not explicitly defined in the available search results, the compound is consistently associated with the Growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6) and Axl receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway. This pathway is a key player in cellular processes like proliferation, survival, and migration and is a target for cancer therapy. Therefore, small molecules that interact with this pathway, particularly by inhibiting the GAS6-Axl interaction, are relevant.\n\nSeveral small molecules have been identified as inhibitors of the GAS6/Axl signaling pathway. These molecules function by targeting either the Axl receptor tyrosine kinase or the interaction between Axl and its ligand, GAS6.\n\n**Small Molecule Inhibitors of the GAS6/Axl Pathway:**\n\n*   **BMS777607:** A small molecule inhibitor that targets the tyrosine kinase domain of the AXL receptor. By blocking the kinase activity, it prevents the downstream signaling that promotes cell proliferation and survival.\n\n*   **Bosutinib (SKI-606):** This is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has been shown to decrease GAS6-mediated Axl phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting cell migration and invasion.\n\n*   **Cabozantinib (BMS-907351):** An oral small molecule inhibitor that targets multiple receptor tyrosine kinases, including Axl. It has been shown to decrease Axl phosphorylation and inhibit cell viability and migration.\n\n*   **Sunitinib (SU11248):** Another multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that shows activity against Axl.\n\n*   **Sitravatinib:** This small molecule inhibits several receptor tyrosine kinases, including Axl, and has been shown to decrease Axl phosphorylation.\n\n*   **RU-301 and RU-302:** These are small molecule inhibitors that have been developed to specifically target the interaction between GAS6 and the Axl receptor.\n\nIt is important to note that while CHEMBL4803817 is linked to the GAS6/Axl pathway, the direct interaction and its specific binding partner (whether it binds to GAS6 or Axl) have not been definitively established in the provided information. However, the small molecules listed above are known to form protein-ligand interactions within this significant signaling cascade.\n\n<<<The small molecules that are known to form protein-ligand interactions with the chemical represented by ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4803817, by likely targeting the GAS6/Axl signaling pathway, include BMS777607, Bosutinib, Cabozantinib, Sunitinib, Sitravatinib, RU-301, and RU-302.>>>"
