    "This particular sequence is not a standard mathematical progression. To find the next number, we need to identify the underlying pattern.\n\nFirst, let's examine the differences between consecutive numbers:\n6, 12, 18, 54, 120, 6, 60, 120, 30, 12, 30, 18, 12, 48, 24, 18, 132, 78, 78, 12, 30, 42, 30, 36, 24, 6, 60, 12, 132, 66, 12.\n\nThere is no immediately obvious pattern in these differences.\n\nA key property of all the numbers in the sequence is that they are divisible by 6. Let's divide each number in the sequence by 6 to see if a simpler pattern emerges:\n169, 170, 172, 175, 184, 204, 205, 215, 235, 240, 242, 247, 250, 252, 260, 264, 267, 289, 302, 315, 317, 322, 329, 334, 340, 344, 345, 355, 357, 379, 390, 392.\n\nNow, let's find the differences between these new consecutive numbers:\n1, 2, 3, 9, 20, 1, 10, 20, 5, 2, 5, 3, 2, 8, 4, 3, 22, 13, 13, 2, 5, 7, 5, 6, 4, 1, 10, 2, 22, 11, 2.\n\nThis sequence of differences still appears irregular. However, let's focus on the last few terms of this difference sequence: 22, 11, 2.\n\nA possible pattern emerges here: each term is related to the previous one by division.\n*   22 / 2 = 11\n*   A plausible next step could be continuing this pattern of division. The next logical divisor for 11 to get close to 2 would be 5 or 5.5, which is not as clean.\n\nLet's consider another interpretation. The pattern in the differences `(..., 22, 11, 2)` might be derived from the two preceding terms. For example, `floor(22 / 11) = 2`. If we apply this rule, we would need the next two terms to compute the following one. Let's assume this `a, b, floor(a/b)` pattern repeats. We'd have to establish the next two differences to find the third.\n\nLet's try to find a simpler repeating pattern in the tail of the differences of the sequence divided by 6: ..., 1, 10, 2, 22, 11, 2. Perhaps the pattern is a short repetition. However, this does not seem to be the case.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, another look at the tail end of the main sequence differences is warranted: 132, 66, 12.\nHere, we see a division by 2 (132 / 2 = 66). The next step to 12 is less clear. It could be division by 5.5.\n\nLet's assume a simple operation is applied to the last difference. The last difference is 12. The preceding difference is 66. A simple pattern isn't immediately obvious.\n\nHowever, if we observe the pattern in the differences of the sequence divided by 6: (..., 2, **22, 11, 2**). There is a pattern of `x, x/2` in `22, 11`. Let's assume a simple continuation and that the next difference is half of the last one, which is `2/2=1`.\n\nIf the next difference in the sequence divided by 6 is 1, the next term would be 392 + 1 = 393.\nTo get the corresponding term in the original sequence, we multiply by 6: 393 * 6 = 2358.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
