    "An analysis of the provided answer choices in the context of duplicate gene evolution reveals the following:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between homologous sequences. In the case of duplicate genes, it tends to homogenize the copies, making them more similar. This process works against divergence, although it can create novel chimeric alleles. Therefore, it is not the primary mechanism responsible for both retention and divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate for a duplicated gene, where one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes nonfunctional. While this involves divergence (the sequence changes from a functional gene to a nonfunctional pseudogene), it represents a failure to *retain* a second functional copy.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this process, one copy of the duplicated gene retains the original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new, beneficial function. This mechanism clearly explains both the *retention* of both copies (as they now have distinct, useful roles) and their *divergence* (as one copy must change to acquire the new function).\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This mechanism proposes that an ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns. After duplication, the two copies accumulate different degenerative mutations, resulting in the partitioning of the original functions between them. For instance, one copy might lose function A but retain B, while the other retains A and loses B. This makes both copies essential to carry out the full ancestral role, thus ensuring their *retention*. It also inherently involves *divergence* as the genes specialize.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary process describing the rapid diversification of a single lineage into multiple species that occupy different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not itself a mechanism for retaining and diverging individual genes within a genome. It operates at the level of species, not individual genes.\n\nBoth Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization are the principal and most widely accepted mechanisms that explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. Both lead to a state where the two gene copies are preserved in the genome and have diverged from one another. Subfunctionalization is often considered a highly plausible route for initial gene preservation because it can occur through neutral or nearly neutral degenerative mutations, which are more common than the rare beneficial mutations required for neofunctionalization. After being preserved by subfunctionalization, a gene copy may later undergo neofunctionalization. However, both choices C and D represent major, accepted pathways. Considering the options, they represent the two primary correct models for this phenomenon.\n\n<<<C, D>>>"
