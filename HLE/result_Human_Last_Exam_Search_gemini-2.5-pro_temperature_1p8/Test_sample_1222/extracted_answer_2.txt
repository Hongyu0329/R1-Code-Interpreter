(a) Yes.

Based on the problem statement, the map \( g \) is defined from the outset as a reflection acting on the quiver \( Q \) with the rule \( g \cdot e_i = e_{n-d-i} \). The question asks whether the condition \( \sigma(a) \neq 0 \) for all arrows \( a \in Q_1 \) implies that \( g \) acts by a reflection. Since \( g \) is stipulated to be a reflection by definition within the context of the question, the implication is satisfied by premise.

(b) A condition on \( d \) for which \( \sigma(a) \neq 0 \) must hold for all \( a \in Q_1 \) is that **\( n-d \) is odd**.

This condition ensures that the reflection \( g \) has no fixed vertices. A vertex \( e_i \) is a fixed point of the reflection if \( g \cdot e_i = e_i \), which translates to \( e_{n-d-i} = e_i \). This requires the indices to be equal, so \( n-d-i = i \), or \( 2i = n-d \).

If \( n-d \) is an odd number, the equation \( 2i = n-d \) has no integer solution for \( i \). Consequently, there are no vertices that are fixed by the action of \( g \). In the theory of Hopf algebra actions on path algebras, the presence of fixed points under the group-like element's action can impose strong constraints that may force certain associated maps, like \( \sigma \), to be zero. By requiring that there are no fixed points, we remove this potential obstruction, creating a condition under which a non-trivial \( \sigma \) can exist for all arrows. This means \( n \) and \( d \) must have different parity.
