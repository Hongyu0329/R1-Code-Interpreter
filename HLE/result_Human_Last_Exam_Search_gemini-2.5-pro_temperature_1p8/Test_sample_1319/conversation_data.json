    "After Mount Olympus, the next tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Ida**, located in present-day Turkey, near the site of ancient Troy.\n\nTwo prominent mountains, aside from Mount Olympus, feature in the epic poem. One is Mount Ida in Anatolia, and the other is the highest peak on the island of Samothrace, Mount Saos (also known as Fengari). In the *Iliad*, the gods use both mountains as vantage points to watch the Trojan War. Zeus, in particular, spends a significant amount of time on Mount Ida's peak, Gargarus, observing the battle below. Poseidon is described as watching the conflict from the summit of Samothrace.\n\nWhile Greek mythology also references a Mount Ida on the island of Crete, which is notably taller, the mountain that plays a direct and recurring role in the narrative of the Trojan War as depicted in the *Iliad* is the one in Anatolia.\n\nThe heights of these historical mountains are as follows:\n*   **Mount Ida (Anatolia, Turkey):** Approximately 1,770 meters (5,820 feet).\n*   **Mount Saos (Samothrace, Greece):** Approximately 1,611 meters (5,285 feet).\n\nComparing these two, Mount Ida near Troy is the taller of the two historical mountains explicitly mentioned in the *Iliad* besides Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Ida>>>"
