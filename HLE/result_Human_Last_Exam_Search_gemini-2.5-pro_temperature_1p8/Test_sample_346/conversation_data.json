    "To determine the value of `log_2(n)` for the given SKI combinator expression, the first step is to evaluate the expression to find the Church integer `n` it represents.\n\nThe expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`\n\nThis can be broken down and simplified step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Combinators**:\n    *   `S`, `K`, and `I` are the basic SKI combinators with the following reduction rules:\n        *   `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n        *   `K x y = x`\n        *   `I x = x`\n    *   The sub-expression `S(S(K S) K)` is the successor combinator, `succ`, which adds one to a Church numeral.\n    *   The expression `S(I)` has the reduction rule `S(I) x y = I y (x y) = y (x y)`.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Sub-expressions**:\n    *   Let's first evaluate `S(I)I`. When applied to a function `f` and an argument `x`, which is how Church numerals are interpreted, we get:\n        `(S(I)I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (I f x) = f(f x)`. This is the definition of the Church numeral for **2**.\n    *   Next, let's look at `succ(S(I)I)`. Since `S(I)I` is `2`, `succ(2)` is the Church numeral for **3**.\n    *   Now, consider `succ I`. Applying this to `f` and `x` gives: `(succ I) f x = f (I f x) = f(f x)`. This is also the Church numeral for **2**.\n\n3.  **Substitute and Reduce the Main Expression**:\n    Let the original expression be `E`. By substituting the evaluated parts, we get:\n    `E = S(I) (S(I) (S(I) (K 2))) 3`\n\n    This expression has the form `S(I) A B`, where `A = S(I)(S(I)(K 2))` and `B = 3`. Using the reduction `S(I) A B = B (A B)`, the expression becomes:\n    `E = 3 (A 3)`\n\n4.  **Evaluate `A 3`**:\n    `A 3 = S(I) (S(I) (K 2)) 3`. This has the form `S(I) C D` where `C = S(I)(K 2)` and `D = 3`.\n    This reduces to `3 (C 3)`.\n\n5.  **Evaluate `C 3`**:\n    `C 3 = S(I) (K 2) 3`. This has the form `S(I) E' F` where `E' = K 2` and `F = 3`.\n    This reduces to `3 (E' 3)`, which is `3 ((K 2) 3)`.\n    The `K` combinator reduces `(K 2) 3` to `2`.\n    So, `C 3 = 3(2)`.\n\n6.  **Church Numeral Exponentiation**:\n    For Church numerals, the application of one numeral `m` to another `n`, written as `m n`, corresponds to exponentiation, `n^m`.\n    Therefore, `3(2)` evaluates to `2^3 = 8`. So, `C 3 = 8`.\n\n7.  **Back-substitute and Continue Reduction**:\n    *   Substituting `C 3 = 8` back into the expression for `A 3`, we get `A 3 = 3(8)`. This evaluates to `8^3`.\n        `8^3 = (2^3)^3 = 2^9`.\n    *   Finally, substitute this back into the main expression `E = 3 (A 3)`:\n        `E = 3 (2^9)`. This evaluates to `(2^9)^3 = 2^{27}`.\n\nSo, the Church integer `n` is `2^{27}`.\n\n8.  **Calculate log_2(n)**:\n    The final step is to calculate the base-2 logarithm of `n`:\n    `log_2(n) = log_2(2^{27}) = 27`.\n\n<<<27>>>"
