The density profile \(\rho(z)\) is determined by the numerical solution to the system of coupled differential equations for the number densities of each gas, \(n_A(z)\) and \(n_B(z)\), based on the principle of constant total potential (chemical + gravitational) in equilibrium.

The governing equations are:
\( \frac{d\mu_A}{dz} + M_A g = 0 \)
\( \frac{d\mu_B}{dz} + M_B g = 0 \)

Expanding these using the chain rule results in a system of coupled ordinary differential equations:
\( \frac{\partial\mu_A}{\partial n_A} \frac{dn_A}{dz} + \frac{\partial\mu_A}{\partial n_B} \frac{dn_B}{dz} = -M_A g \)
\( \frac{\partial\mu_B}{\partial n_A} \frac{dn_A}{dz} + \frac{\partial\mu_B}{\partial n_B} \frac{dn_B}{dz} = -M_B g \)

where the chemical potentials \(\mu_i\) and their partial derivatives are derived from the van der Waals model for a gas mixture. The total mass density profile is then given by:
\( \rho(z) = M_A n_A(z) + M_B n_B(z) \)

An analytical, closed-form solution for \(\rho(z)\) is not feasible due to the non-linearity of the system. The profile must be determined by numerical integration with appropriate boundary conditions.
