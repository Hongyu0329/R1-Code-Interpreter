    "To determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols T, F, !, &, |, (, ), we can systematically categorize and count the unique valid strings of symbols that evaluate to true. The operator precedence is given as ! > & > |.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the valid expression structures and the number of true expressions for each:\n\n### 1. Expressions with Three Literals and Two Binary Operators\nThese expressions have the form `x op y op z`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are either `T` or `F`. No parentheses are needed as the precedence rules (`&` before `|`) and associativity (left-to-right for same-precedence operators) resolve any ambiguity.\n\n*   **Two `|` operators** (`x | y | z`): An expression with only OR operators is false only if all operands are `F`. Of the 8 possible combinations of literals, 7 result in `True`.\n*   **Two `&` operators** (`x & y & z`): An expression with only AND operators is true only if all operands are `T`. This gives 1 true expression (`T&T&T`).\n*   **One `|` and one `&`** (`x | y & z`): Due to precedence, this is parsed as `x | (y & z)`. This expression is true if `x` is `T` (4 combinations) or if `x` is `F` and `y & z` is `T` (which only happens for `F|T&T`). This gives a total of 5 true expressions.\n*   **One `&` and one `|`** (`x & y | z`): This is parsed as `(x & y) | z`. This expression is true if `z` is `T` (4 combinations) or if `z` is `F` and `x & y` is `T` (`T&T|F`). This gives a total of 5 true expressions.\n\nThis category yields a total of 7 + 1 + 5 + 5 = **18** expressions.\n\n### 2. Expressions with Parentheses and Two Literals\nThese expressions use parentheses to group a sub-expression.\n\n*   **Form `(x op y)`**: Examples include `(T&T)` and `(T|F)`. There are 4 such expressions that evaluate to true: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, and `(F|T)`.\n*   **Form `(x) op y`**: For example, `(T)&T`. There are 4 true expressions of this form: `(T)&T`, `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, and `(F)|T`.\n*   **Form `x op (y)`**: Similar to the above, this yields 4 true expressions: `T&(T)`, `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, and `F|(T)`.\n\nThis category adds 4 + 4 + 4 = **12** expressions.\n\n### 3. Expressions with Negation (`!`) and Two Literals\nThese structures combine the NOT operator with AND or OR.\n\n*   **Form `!x op !y`**: This form is parsed as `(!x) op (!y)`. There are 4 combinations that result in true: `!F&!F`, `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, and `!F|!F`.\n*   **Form `!!x op y`**: The string `!!T&T` has 5 symbols and is parsed as `(!(!T))&T`. This evaluates to `T&T`, which is true. There are 4 such true expressions: `!!T&T`, `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, and `!!F|T`.\n*   **Form `x op !!y`**: Symmetrical to the above, this gives another 4 true expressions: `T&!!T`, `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, and `F|!!T`.\n\nThis category contributes 4 + 4 + 4 = **12** expressions.\n\n### 4. Expressions with One Literal Combining Negation and Parentheses\nThis group consists of expressions built around a single literal (`T` or `F`) using multiple operators and parentheses to reach a length of 5.\n\n*   `!!!!T`: This evaluates to `!(!(!(!T)))`, which simplifies to `True`.\n*   `!!(T)`: This string is parsed as `!(!T)`, which is `True`.\n*   `!(!T)`: This string consists of `!`, `(`, `!`, `T`, `)` and evaluates to `True`.\n*   `!((F))`: This is parsed as `!F`, resulting in `True`.\n*   `((!F))`: This is parsed as `!F`, which is `True`.\n*   `(!(F))`: This is parsed as `!F`, yielding `True`.\n\nThis final category adds **6** more expressions.\n\nSumming up all the categories gives the total count: 18 + 12 + 12 + 6 = 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
