    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, it is a Roman captive who describes the religious practices of his people in a way that clearly alludes to the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n\nDuring a council of the Goths, this captive is questioned about the Romans' beliefs. He recounts the foundational myth of his city, telling of twin brothers who were fathered by a god and a mortal woman. He explains that these twins were suckled and raised by a she-wolf, an animal held sacred by the Romans as a result. This description of a she-wolf nurturing the founders of their great city is a direct parallel to the well-known Roman myth of Romulus and Remus, the twin founders of Rome who were famously saved and suckled by a she-wolf. The captive's narrative, therefore, reveals to the reader the mythological underpinnings of the Roman antagonists in the novel.\n\n<<<A Roman captive>>>"
