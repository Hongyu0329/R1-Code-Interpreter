    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain a number of fluorine atoms equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar structure. The term \"perfluoro\" signifies that all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms. Since \"nanocar\" refers to a class of molecular machines rather than a single, specific molecule, the exact number of fluorine atoms depends on the nanocar's design.\n\nFor a specific example, a \"Nanocar with Flexible chassis\" has the chemical formula C₃₁₀H₃₄. If this nanocar were to be perfluorinated, all 34 hydrogen atoms would be replaced with fluorine atoms. Therefore, a perfluorinated version of this specific nanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nTo illustrate the variation, another molecular vehicle, a \"Nanotruck,\" has the formula C₂₈₂H₁₈N₄. A perfluorinated version of this Nanotruck would contain 18 fluorine atoms.\n\nThus, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar is dependent on the specific molecular structure of the nanocar in question.\n\n<<<34>>>"
