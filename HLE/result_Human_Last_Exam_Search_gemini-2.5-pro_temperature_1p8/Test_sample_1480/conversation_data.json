    "In a fuzzy logic system, the rule activation level, also known as the firing strength, is determined by combining the membership degrees of the inputs in the antecedent part of a rule. The antecedent is the \"IF\" part of a rule. When a rule has multiple antecedent clauses connected by \"AND\", a t-norm operation is used to combine them.\n\nWhile the term \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\" suggests a high level of complexity, the provided values are crisp numbers (0.7 and 0.9). This indicates a simplified problem where these values represent the membership degrees of the inputs for a specific rule's antecedents. The term `μG_k_j(y_j)` typically denotes a membership function in the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) of the rule, but in this context, it is most logically interpreted as the membership degree for a second antecedent.\n\nA t-norm (triangular norm) is a function that generalizes the logical \"AND\" operation for fuzzy logic. There are several types of t-norms, with the most common being the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm. In the absence of a specified t-norm, the minimum operator is often the default choice.\n\nUsing the minimum t-norm, the calculation is as follows:\n*   `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\nUsing the product t-norm, the result would be:\n*   `Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nSince the problem implies a single answer and does not specify which t-norm to use, the most standard and widely used t-norm, the minimum operator, is applied.\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level is calculated as the minimum of the two given membership values.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
