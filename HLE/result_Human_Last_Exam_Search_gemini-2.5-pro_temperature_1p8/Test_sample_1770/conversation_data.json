    "To prevent the degradation of the produced p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you should knock out a gene within the **phd gene cluster**. This cluster is responsible for the phenylpropanoid utilization pathway, which breaks down compounds like p-coumaric acid.\n\n*Corynebacterium glutamicum* is capable of using p-coumaric acid as a sole carbon and energy source through a CoA-dependent, β-oxidative deacetylation pathway. A specific set of genes, labeled the `phd` cluster, is essential for this process. This cluster includes the genes `phdA`, `phdB`, `phdC`, `phdD`, and `phdE`, which encode the enzymes for this β-oxidation-like pathway, as well as a transporter (`phdT`) and a regulator (`phdR`).\n\nResearch has demonstrated that the deletion of key genes within this cluster, such as **`phdA`**, **`phdB`**, **`phdC`**, or **`phdE`**, eliminates the ability of *C. glutamicum* to grow on p-coumaric acid, thereby preventing its degradation. Therefore, knocking out any of these genes would be an effective strategy to allow for the accumulation of p-coumaric acid. In some studies, a deletion of the `phdA` gene has been successfully used to enhance p-coumaric acid production.\n\nIn summary, to halt the degradation of p-coumaric acid, a knockout of a gene in the `phd` cluster is necessary.\n\n<<<phd gene cluster (e.g., phdA, phdB, phdC, or phdE)>>>"
