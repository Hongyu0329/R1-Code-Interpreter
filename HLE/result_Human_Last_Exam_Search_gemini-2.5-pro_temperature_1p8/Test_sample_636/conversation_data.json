    "### Desired Characteristic Polynomial\n\nThe desired eigenvalues are given as -1 + j and -1 - j. The characteristic polynomial for a system with these eigenvalues can be found as follows:\n(λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j)) = (λ + 1 - j)(λ + 1 + j)\n= (λ + 1)² - (j)²\n= λ² + 2λ + 1 - (-1)\n= λ² + 2λ + 2\n\n### System Dynamics and State Feedback\n\nThe state matrix A is given by:\nA = [[-1, 1],\n    ]\n\nThe input matrix B is given by:\nB = [,\n    ]\n\nLet the state feedback gain matrix be F:\nF = [[f₁, f₂],\n     [f₃, f₄]]\n\nHowever, for a standard state feedback controller, the input u = -Kx, where K is the feedback gain matrix. For a system with a state vector x of size 2, K would be a 2x2 matrix if the input u is a vector of size 2. Assuming a standard SISO-like feedback structure for pole placement where we are looking for a feedback gain vector F = [f₁ f₂] which is not standard for a B matrix of size 2x2, a different approach might be needed. Let's reconsider the problem as finding a simple feedback matrix.\n\nLet's assume a simpler form for F for this textbook problem, which is often the case. Let's test a case where F is a 2x1 vector applied to a single input constructed from the B matrix. This is ambiguous.\n\nLet's proceed by calculating A + BF with a general F.\nBF = [,\n     ] * [[f₁, f₂],\n                   [f₃, f₄]]\n   = [[f₁ + 2f₃, f₂ + 2f₄],\n      [f₁,       f₂]]\n\nA + BF = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄],\n          [ 1 + f₁,          f₂]]\n\nNow, let's calculate the characteristic polynomial of A + BF.\ndet(λI - (A + BF)) = 0\ndet([[λ - (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃), -(1 + f₂ + 2f₄)],\n     [-(1 + f₁),             λ - f₂]]) = 0\n\n(λ + 1 - f₁ - 2f₃)(λ - f₂) - (-(1 + f₂ + 2f₄))(-(1 + f₁)) = 0\nλ² - f₂λ + λ - f₂ - f₁λ + f₁f₂ - f₁ - 2f₃λ + 2f₃f₂ + 2f₃ - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁) = 0\nλ² + (1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃)λ + (-f₂ - f₁ + f₁f₂ + 2f₃f₂ + 2f₃) - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄) = 0\nλ² + (1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃)λ + (-f₂ - f₁ + f₁f₂ + 2f₃f₂ + 2f₃ - 1 - f₁ - f₂ - f₁f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄) = 0\nλ² + (1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃)λ + (-2f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₃ + 2f₃f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ - 1) = 0\n\nEquating coefficients with the desired polynomial λ² + 2λ + 2:\n1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃ = 2\n-2f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₃ + 2f₃f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ - 1 = 2\n\nThis gives a system of two equations with four unknowns, which means there are infinite solutions. We can find one solution by setting some variables to zero.\n\nLet f₃ = 0 and f₄ = 0.\n1 - f₁ - f₂ = 2  => f₁ + f₂ = -1\n-2f₁ - 2f₂ - 1 = 2 => -2(f₁ + f₂) = 3 => f₁ + f₂ = -3/2\n\nThis leads to a contradiction, so we cannot set both f₃ and f₄ to zero.\n\nLet f₂ = 0 and f₄ = 0.\n1 - f₁ - 2f₃ = 2 => -f₁ - 2f₃ = 1 => f₁ = -1 - 2f₃\n-2f₁ + 2f₃ - 1 = 2 => -2f₁ + 2f₃ = 3\n-2(-1 - 2f₃) + 2f₃ = 3\n2 + 4f₃ + 2f₃ = 3\n6f₃ = 1 => f₃ = 1/6\nf₁ = -1 - 2(1/6) = -1 - 1/3 = -4/3\n\nSo, one possible solution is:\nF = [[-4/3, 0],\n     [ 1/6, 0]]\n\nLet's check this solution:\nA + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [,] * [[-4/3, 0], [1/6, 0]]\nA + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [[-4/3 + 2/6, 0], [-4/3, 0]]\nA + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [[-4/3 + 1/3, 0], [-4/3, 0]]\nA + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [[-1, 0], [-4/3, 0]]\nA + BF = [[-2, 1], [-1/3, 0]]\n\nCharacteristic polynomial of A + BF:\ndet([[λ+2, -1], [1/3, λ]]) = λ(λ+2) - (-1)(1/3) = λ² + 2λ + 1/3\nThis is not the desired polynomial λ² + 2λ + 2. There was a mistake in the algebraic expansion.\n\nLet's re-calculate the characteristic polynomial of A + BF with F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]].\nA + BF = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]\ndet(λI - (A + BF)) = (λ - (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃))(λ - f₂) - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁)\n= λ² - f₂λ + λ(1 - f₁ - 2f₃) - f₂ (1 - f₁ - 2f₃) - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄)\n= λ² + (1 - f₁ - 2f₃ - f₂)λ - (f₂ - f₁f₂ - 2f₃f₂) - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄)\n= λ² + (1 - f₁ - f₂ - 2f₃)λ + (-2f₂ + 2f₃f₂) - 1 - f₁ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄)\nThis expansion is getting complicated and prone to errors.\n\nA more systematic method like Ackermann's formula is usually used for single-input systems. The presence of a 2x2 B matrix suggests a multi-input system.  Let's simplify the problem by assuming a more straightforward feedback structure. Perhaps the problem intends for a feedback u = -Kx, where K has a specific structure. If we assume a feedback gain vector k = [k₁, k₂], then the input is a scalar u, and we must choose a single column from B.  This is also an assumption.\n\nLet's assume F = [f₁; f₂] (a 2x1 matrix). This is not compatible with matrix multiplication with B (2x2). Let's assume the feedback is of the form u = -Fx, which is not standard.\n\nLet's stick with the most general form F = [[f₁, f₂], [f₃, f₄]] and re-derive the characteristic polynomial of A+BF.\n\nLet M = A + BF = [[-1 + f₁ + 2f₃, 1 + f₂ + 2f₄], [1 + f₁, f₂]]\nCharacteristic polynomial is λ² - tr(M)λ + det(M) = 0\ntr(M) = -1 + f₁ + 2f₃ + f₂\ndet(M) = (-1 + f₁ + 2f₃)f₂ - (1 + f₂ + 2f₄)(1 + f₁)\n= -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - (1 + f₁ + f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₄ + 2f₁f₄)\n= -f₂ + f₁f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - 1 - f₁ - f₂ - f₁f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄\n= -2f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - 1 - f₁ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄\n\nWe want the polynomial to be λ² + 2λ + 2.\nSo, -tr(M) = 2  => tr(M) = -2\ndet(M) = 2\n\ntr(M): -1 + f₁ + 2f₃ + f₂ = -2  =>  f₁ + f₂ + 2f₃ = -1\ndet(M): -f₁ - 2f₂ - 1 + 2f₃f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 2 => -f₁ - 2f₂ + 2f₃f₂ - 2f₄ - 2f₁f₄ = 3\n\nThis is a system of 2 equations with 4 unknowns. Let's find a simple solution.\nSet f₃ = 0, f₄ = 0.\nf₁ + f₂ = -1\n-f₁ - 2f₂ = 3\nAdding the two equations: (f₁ + f₂) + (-f₁ - 2f₂) = -1 + 3 => -f₂ = 2 => f₂ = -2\nf₁ + (-2) = -1 => f₁ = 1\n\nSo one possible solution is F = [[1, -2],].\n\nLet's check this solution.\nA + BF = [[-1, 1],] + [,] * [[1, -2],]\n= [[-1, 1],] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]\n= [[0, -1], [2, -2]]\nCharacteristic polynomial:\ndet(λI - (A + BF)) = det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ² + 2λ + 2.\nThis is the desired characteristic polynomial. So the gain matrix F is correct.\n\n<<<F = [[1, -2],]>>>"
