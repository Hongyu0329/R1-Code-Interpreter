    "The surname of the English poet that appears in the Russian translation of a certain essay describing the wide boulevards of Vienna is Byron.\n\nThe work in question is Stefan Zweig's memoir, \"The World of Yesterday.\" In the Russian translation of this book, the word \"байроны\" (Byrony), the plural of \"Байрон\" (the Russian spelling of Byron), is used. This reference appears in a description of elegant gentlemen riding horses on the boulevards of Vienna. The translator used the poet's name to evoke an image of romantic and dashing figures, a quality famously associated with Lord Byron. This was a specific choice by the Russian translator and is not present in Zweig's original German text.\n\n<<<Byron>>>"
