    "ROMM RGB, also known as ProPhoto RGB, is a color space with a significantly wider gamut than sRGB. This means that ROMM RGB can represent a broader range of colors, particularly highly saturated ones, than sRGB can. When converting a color from a wide-gamut space like ROMM RGB to a smaller-gamut space like sRGB, some colors may fall \"out of gamut,\" meaning they cannot be accurately represented in the smaller space. This is most common with highly saturated primary and secondary colors.\n\nOf the options provided, the following colors' representability in sRGB are as follows:\n\n*   **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This represents a pure, fully saturated blue in the ROMM RGB color space. Due to the much larger gamut of ROMM RGB, this highly saturated blue lies outside the sRGB gamut and therefore cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n*   **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This is a pure, fully saturated green in the ROMM RGB color space. Similar to the pure blue, this vibrant green is well outside the range of colors that sRGB can display.\n*   **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a muted, desaturated cyan-blue color. Being less saturated, it is likely to fall within the gamut of sRGB.\n*   **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a desaturated and darker cyan-blue. It is also well within the central area of the color gamut that is shared by both ROMM RGB and sRGB.\n*   **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white, which is a reference point in both color spaces and is therefore representable in both.\n\nTherefore, the highly saturated primary colors of blue and green in ROMM RGB cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2>>>"
