    "The search results confirm the initial reasoning. Let's break down the answer based on the search results and prior knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to establish the relationship between the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of C, denoted as `ρ(C^(15))`, and the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C, `ρ(J(C))`.\nFor a smooth projective curve C of genus `g`, the `d`-th symmetric power `C^(d)` is a smooth projective variety. The Néron-Severi group, `NS(X)`, is the group of divisors modulo algebraic equivalence, and its rank is the Picard number `ρ(X)`.\nFor `d ≥ g`, the Picard group of `C^(d)` is related to the Picard group of its Jacobian `J(C)`. More specifically, for a smooth curve `C` of genus `g ≥ 2` and `d ≥ g`, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the d-th symmetric power of C is given by `ρ(C^(d)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`. This is because the Néron-Severi group of `C^(d)` is generated by the pullback of the Néron-Severi group of `J(C)` via the Abel-Jacobi map and the class of a divisor `X_p = {p + D | D ∈ C^(d-1)}` for a point `p ∈ C`.\nIn our case, `C` is a genus `g=3` Riemann surface, and `X` is its 15th symmetric power, so `d=15`. Since `15 ≥ 3`, the formula applies, and we have `ρ(X) = ρ(C^(15)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`.\n\nNow, the problem is reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for `ρ(J(C))` where `C` is a genus 3 curve.\n\n**Smallest possible rank of `NS(J(C))`:**\nThe Jacobian `J(C)` of a generic curve `C` of genus `g` has a Néron-Severi group of rank 1. In this case, the endomorphism ring of `J(C)` is simply the integers, `Z`. Such Jacobians are simple and do not have complex multiplication. For `g=3`, a general curve can be, for example, a non-hyperelliptic smooth plane quartic or a general hyperelliptic curve.\nThus, the minimum possible rank for `NS(J(C))` is 1.\nThis leads to the smallest possible rank for `NS(X)`: `ρ_min(X) = 1 + 1 = 2`. and mention that for a general curve, the rank is 2.\n\n**Largest possible rank of `NS(J(C))`:**\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g` is bounded by `ρ(A) ≤ g^2`. For the Jacobian `J(C)` of a genus 3 curve, the dimension is `g=3`, so `ρ(J(C)) ≤ 9`.\nThis maximum rank is achieved when the abelian variety is of CM-type (Complex Multiplication). Specifically, an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g` has `ρ(A) = g^2` if and only if it is isogenous to `E^g`, where `E` is an elliptic curve with complex multiplication.\nFor a Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, the question is whether it can be isogenous to a product of three mutually isogenous elliptic curves with CM. The answer is yes. For instance, the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic curve, `x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0`, is isogenous to the cube of an elliptic curve with CM by `Z[i]`. Also, other hyperelliptic curves of genus 3 exist whose Jacobians have maximal Picard number `ρ=9`. For example, a result by Schoen points out that the Jacobian of the curve `y^2 = x^8-1` has `ρ=9`.\nTherefore, the maximum possible rank for `NS(J(C))` for a genus 3 curve is 9.\nThis gives the largest possible rank for `NS(X)`: `ρ_max(X) = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\nCombining these results, the smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1. `ρ(C^(15)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1` for `g=3`. This is correct.\n2. `min ρ(J(C))` for genus 3 is 1 (generic case). This is correct.\n3. `max ρ(J(C))` for genus 3 is 9 (CM case). This is correct.\n4. Smallest rank of `NS(X)` is `1 + 1 = 2`.\n5. Largest rank of `NS(X)` is `9 + 1 = 10`.\nThe reasoning holds.\n\nFinal answer will be presented as a pair of numbers for the smallest and largest rank.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2. The largest possible rank is 10.\nThe smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2, and the largest is 10.\nLet's formulate the final answer.\nSmallest possible rank: 2\nLargest possible rank: 10\nI should make sure that this is a definitive answer. The steps seem robust and based on well-known results in algebraic geometry. No contradictory information found. I'm ready for the final answer.\nFinal Answer will contain the reasoning and then the values. I need to be careful with the output format.\n\nI should provide a single final answer without the <<>> format for intermediate steps. I'll provide it in the final block.\nSo my thought process has converged to a solid conclusion.\n\nSmallest Rank: This occurs for a *generic* genus 3 curve C. For such a curve, the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian, NS(J(C)), is of rank 1, generated by the class of the theta divisor.\nLargest Rank: This occurs for a special genus 3 curve C with complex multiplication (CM). The maximum possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of a g-dimensional abelian variety is g^2. For g=3, this is 9. It is a known fact that there exist genus 3 curves (e.g., the Fermat quartic) whose Jacobian J(C) is isogenous to E^3, where E is a CM elliptic curve, and for which ρ(J(C))=9.\n\nWith the established relation `ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`, we can calculate the final values.\n\nSmallest rank: `min(ρ(X)) = min(ρ(J(C))) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\nLargest rank: `max(ρ(X)) = max(ρ(J(C))) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10`.\nEverything looks solid. I will now format the final response.\n\nFinal summary:\nLet `C` be a Riemann surface of genus `g=3` and `X = C^(15)` be its 15th symmetric power. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of `X` is denoted `ρ(X)`.\nFor `d ≥ g`, it is a standard result that the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the `d`-th symmetric power `C^(d)` is given by the formula `ρ(C^(d)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`, where `ρ(J(C))` is the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of `C`.\nIn this problem, `g=3` and `d=15`, so the condition `d ≥ g` is satisfied. Therefore, `ρ(X) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`.\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of `ρ(J(C))` for a genus 3 curve `C`.\n\n1.  **Smallest Rank:** For a generic curve `C` of genus `g=3`, its Jacobian `J(C)` is a simple abelian variety with endomorphism ring `Z`. In this case, the Néron-Severi group `NS(J(C))` is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), and its rank is `ρ(J(C)) = 1`.\n    Therefore, the smallest possible rank for `ρ(X)` is `1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n2.  **Largest Rank:** The rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g` is bounded by `ρ(A) ≤ g^2`. For `J(C)`, which is a 3-dimensional abelian variety, this means `ρ(J(C)) ≤ 9`. This maximum is achieved for certain special curves with complex multiplication (CM). It has been shown that there exist genus 3 curves whose Jacobians are isogenous to a product of three isogenous CM elliptic curves, and for which `ρ(J(C)) = 9`. An example is the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic curve `x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0`.\n    Therefore, the largest possible rank for `ρ(X)` is `9 + 1 = 10`.\n\nSo, the smallest rank is 2, and the largest rank is 10. This seems to be the complete and final reasoning.\nThe question is clear and the reasoning is solid.\n\nThe user asks for the smallest and the largest possible rank. I will give these two values in the final answer.Let C be a Riemann surface of genus `g=3` and let X be its 15th symmetric power, `X = C^(15)`. The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a variety is also known as its Picard number, denoted by `ρ`.\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of the `d`-th symmetric power of a curve `C` of genus `g`, `ρ(C^(d))`, is related to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian variety, `ρ(J(C))`. For `d ≥ g`, the relationship is given by the formula `ρ(C^(d)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`. In this problem, `g=3` and `d=15`, so the condition `d ≥ g` is met. Therefore, we have `ρ(X) = ρ(C^(15)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1`.\n\nThe problem is thus reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values of `ρ(J(C))` for a genus 3 curve `C`.\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nFor a \"very general\" curve `C` of genus `g`, its Jacobian `J(C)` is a simple abelian variety whose ring of endomorphisms is just the integers `Z`. For such curves, the Néron-Severi group `NS(J(C))` is generated by the class of the theta divisor, and its rank `ρ(J(C))` is 1.\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is:\n`ρ_min(X) = ρ_min(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\nThis is confirmed by sources indicating that for a general curve, the Néron-Severi rank of its symmetric powers is 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety `A` of dimension `g` is bounded by `ρ(A) ≤ g^2`. Since the Jacobian `J(C)` of a genus 3 curve is a 3-dimensional abelian variety, its Néron-Severi rank is at most `3^2 = 9`.\n\nThis maximum rank is achieved for special curves `C` whose Jacobians have complex multiplication (CM). An abelian variety of dimension `g` reaches this maximum rank if it is isogenous to the `g`-th power of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication, i.e., `E^g`. There exist genus 3 curves for which this is the case. For example, the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic curve (`x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0`) is isogenous to `E^3`, where `E` is an elliptic curve with CM by `Z[i]`. There are other examples of genus 3 curves, both hyperelliptic and non-hyperelliptic, whose Jacobians have a Néron-Severi rank of 9.\nThus, the maximum possible rank of `NS(J(C))` for a genus 3 curve is 9.\nTherefore, the largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is:\n`ρ_max(X) = ρ_max(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\nThe smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 2.\nThe largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
