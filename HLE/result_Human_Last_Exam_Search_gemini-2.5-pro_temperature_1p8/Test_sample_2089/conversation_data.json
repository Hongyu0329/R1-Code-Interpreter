    "I have been unable to identify an Oscar-nominated film that precisely matches the scene you described.\n\nMy search for a movie where a character seals their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus did not yield a definitive result among Oscar-nominated films. While I found information on numerous films featuring significant bus scenes and themes of fate, none contained the specific sequence of events you detailed.\n\nIt is possible the film is not Oscar-nominated, is a foreign film, or the details of the scene might be slightly different. For example, in the film *The Brutalist*, a character boards a bus after expressing thanks to a friend, and the film *Paterson* features a bus driver as its protagonist, but neither directly links the phrase \"Thank you\" on a bus to a character's sealed fate in the way described.\n\nIf you have any other details about the film, such as the genre, approximate year of release, or any actors you might remember, it could help in identifying the movie.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide the answer.>>>"
