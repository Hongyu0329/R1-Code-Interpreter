    "Based on an analysis of the provided amino acid sequence and the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing in coiled-coil proteins, the oligomeric state can be determined.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nCoiled-coil proteins are characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, which is labeled with the letters `a, b, c, d, e, f, g`. The stability of the coiled-coil structure comes from the hydrophobic interactions between amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions. These hydrophobic residues form a \"stripe\" that winds around each Î±-helix, allowing them to pack together tightly. This interaction is referred to as knobs-into-holes packing.\n\nThe provided sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nTo determine the register of the heptad repeat, we look for a consistent pattern of hydrophobic residues. In a standard coiled-coil, the `a` and `d` positions are four and three residues apart, respectively (d-e-f-g-a). In the given sequence, we can observe a recurring pattern where a hydrophobic Isoleucine (I) is followed three residues later by a hydrophobic Leucine (L).\n\nLet's test the hypothesis that Isoleucine (I) occupies the `d` position and Leucine (L) occupies the `a` position:\n`... d e f g a ...`\n\nApplying this to the sequence:\n`G E (I) A Q S (L) | K E (I) A K S (L) | K E (I) A W S (L) | K E (I) A Q S (L) | K G`\n\nThis alignment reveals a highly consistent pattern for the core `a` and `d` positions across four full heptad repeats:\n*   **Positions `a`**: L, L, L, L\n*   **Positions `d`**: I, I, I, I\n\n### 2. Determining Oligomeric State from Core Residues\n\nLandmark studies, particularly those involving the GCN4 coiled-coil, have established a set of rules that govern how the amino acid sequence affects the oligomeric state (the number of helices in the structure). The identity of the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions is a primary determinant:\n*   **Isoleucine at `a` and Leucine at `d`** typically forms a **dimer** (2 helices).\n*   **Isoleucine at `a` and Isoleucine at `d`** tends to form a **trimer** (3 helices).\n*   **Leucine at `a` and Isoleucine at `d`** strongly favors the formation of a **tetramer** (4 helices).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` consistently places Leucine (L) at the `a` positions and Isoleucine (I) at the `d` positions. According to the established principles of knobs-into-holes packing efficiency, this specific arrangement promotes the formation of a four-stranded, or tetrameric, coiled-coil. Therefore, the predicted oligomeric state is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
