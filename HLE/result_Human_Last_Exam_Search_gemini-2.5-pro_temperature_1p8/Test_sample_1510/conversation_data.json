    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are categorized based on their symmetry properties, and each is associated with a point group, which describes the rotational and reflectional symmetries of the pattern. The order of a point group is the number of distinct symmetry operations in that group.\n\nA point group of order 2 contains two symmetry operations: the identity operation and one other operation, which is either a 180-degree rotation or a reflection. The two crystallographic point groups of order 2 are C2 and D1.\n\nThe wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group has a C2 point group, characterized by 180-degree rotations (rotations of order 2) but no reflections.\n*   **pm**: This group has a D1 point group and contains parallel reflection axes but no rotations.\n*   **pg**: This group also has a D1 point group and is characterized by parallel glide reflections.\n*   **cm**: This group has a D1 point group and contains both reflections and glide reflections on parallel axes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
