    "**Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**, a prominent philosopher of the Lviv-Warsaw School, is the one who decomposed the general notion of a sign into categories including symptoms and signals.\n\nAjdukiewicz, a leading figure in Polish analytical philosophy, made significant contributions to logic, epistemology, and the philosophy of language. In his semiotic theory, he analyzed the concept of a sign (in Polish, \"*oznaka*,\" which can be translated as sign, mark, or indication) and distinguished between different types of signs.\n\nHis framework includes the following key distinctions:\n*   **Symptom (or Indication):** This refers to a natural sign. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is causal or based on natural correlation. For instance, a falling barometer is a symptom or an indication of impending rain.\n*   **Signal:** This denotes a conventional or artificial sign. The connection between a signal and its meaning is established by a convention or a rule. A green traffic light, for example, is a signal to proceed.\n\nWhile the term \"hallmark\" might not be a direct translation of a specific technical term used by Ajdukiewicz, it can be understood as a broader category for a sign or a distinguishing mark, which his theory then breaks down into these more specific categories of symptoms and signals.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
