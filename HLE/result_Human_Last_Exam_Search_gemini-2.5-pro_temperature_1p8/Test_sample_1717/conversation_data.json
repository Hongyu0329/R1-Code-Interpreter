    "Based on the information available from community analysis of Terraria's source code, there is no simple formula for boss health scaling in Expert Mode multiplayer. Each boss's health scales differently.\n\nFor the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, the health for a specific number of players has been recorded as follows:\n*   **1 Player:** 3,640 HP.\n*   **2 Players:** 4,913 HP.\n*   **3 Players:** 6,976 HP.\n*   **4 Players:** 9,565 HP.\n*   **5 Players:** 12,504 HP.\n*   **With at least 10 players,** the health was observed to be 29,364 HP.\n\nThe health scaling is not a simple linear or exponential function. The increase in health for each additional player is significant and does not appear to approach zero. This indicates that as the number of players increases, the Eye of Cthulhu's health will continue to increase without a clear upper limit.\n\nTherefore, for a theoretical infinite number of players, the health of the Eye of Cthulhu would also be infinite.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
