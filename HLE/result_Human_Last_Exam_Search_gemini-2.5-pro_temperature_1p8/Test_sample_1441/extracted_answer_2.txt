In scalar field theories below the upper critical dimension of four, the critical exponent for specific heat, α, scales with the spatial dimensionality, d, according to the hyperscaling relation α = 2 - dν, where ν is the correlation length exponent. Using the epsilon expansion (ε = 4 - d), ν can be expressed as a power series in ε. To the leading order in ε, this results in α scaling linearly with ε. The one-loop result for the O(n) model is α ≈ [(4-n)/(2(n+8))]ε.
