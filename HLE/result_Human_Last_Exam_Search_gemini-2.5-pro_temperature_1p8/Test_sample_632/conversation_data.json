    "A unique architectural feature of the Piazza della Rotonda was a pair of bell towers that flanked the facade of the Pantheon. However, these were not removed in 1950 but rather were demolished between 1881 and 1883.\n\nThe bell towers, often derisively nicknamed the \"ass's ears\" by the Roman populace, were added in the 17th century under Pope Urban VIII. Their design has been attributed to the famous Baroque artists Gian Lorenzo Bernini, as well as to Carlo Maderno and Francesco Borromini. The addition was an attempt to make the ancient pagan temple appear more like a traditional Christian church.\n\nThe removal of the towers in the late 19th century was part of a series of efforts to restore the Pantheon to its original classical appearance. This action was seen by some as less of an aesthetic choice and more of an anti-clerical statement by the then-secular Italian state.\n\nWhile numerous changes have occurred in the Piazza della Rotonda over the centuries, including the clearing of medieval shops and the installation of the central fountain and obelisk, the removal of these prominent bell towers stands out as a significant architectural alteration to the skyline of the square. Extensive research has not revealed any record of a different unique architectural feature being removed by the city administration in 1950.\n\n<<<The bell towers of the Pantheon>>>"
