    "### No Storage Permitted for Opened Single-Dose Ampules in Sterile Environments\n\nAccording to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter <797> on Pharmaceutical Compounding â€“ Sterile Preparations, a single-dose ampule must be discarded immediately after opening and not stored for any period. This guideline applies even when the ampule is opened within a sterile environment, such as an ISO Class 5 cleanroom.\n\nAn ampule is a sealed glass container with a neck that is broken to access the medication. Once broken, it cannot be resealed, which significantly increases the risk of microbial contamination. This characteristic distinguishes ampules from single-dose vials, which are sealed with a rubber stopper that can be punctured multiple times.\n\nFor single-dose *vials* that have been punctured in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, the beyond-use date (BUD) is up to 12 hours after the initial puncture, provided storage requirements are maintained. However, this allowance does not extend to ampules. Any unused portion from a single-dose container, which includes ampules, must be discarded after the preparation for an individual patient is complete.\n\nIt is critical to adhere to these standards to minimize the risk of contamination and ensure patient safety. <<<Opened single-dose ampules must not be stored for any time period and must be discarded immediately after use.>>>"
