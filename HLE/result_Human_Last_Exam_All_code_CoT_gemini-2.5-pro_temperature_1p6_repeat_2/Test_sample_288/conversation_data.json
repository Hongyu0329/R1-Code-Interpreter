    "To determine the main projection target of ASJ axons, I will analyze the adult *C. elegans* hermaphrodite connectome published by Witvliet et al. in 2021.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the analysis:\n1.  **Load Data**: I will fetch the connectome data using the `navis` Python library. This dataset details synaptic connections between all neurons.\n2.  **Filter Presynaptic Neurons**: I will filter these connections to isolate only those originating from the ASJ neuron pair (ASJL and ASJR). In this context, presynaptic terminals from ASJ are considered to be on its axon.\n3.  **Aggregate by Target**: I will group the filtered synapses by their postsynaptic (target) neuron and sum the number of synapses for each target. This will give a total count of synapses from ASJ to every neuron it connects to.\n4.  **Identify Main Target**: By sorting the aggregated counts, I will identify the neuron that receives the highest number of synapses from ASJ.\n5.  **Present Results**: I will print the name of the main target cell and show the breakdown of how many synapses it receives from ASJL and ASJR individually, as well as the total sum.\n\nThis script requires the `navis` and `pandas` libraries. You can install them with: `pip install navis[remote] pandas`\n\n```python\nimport navis\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_main_asj_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main postsynaptic target of ASJ neurons in the adult C. elegans\n    hermaphrodite connectome based on synapse number.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.
