    Calculates the Morse index of a minimal surface given its Gauss map.

    The problem states:
    M is a minimal surface in R^3, conformally equivalent to C.
    The Gauss map is g(z) = z / (z^3 + 2).

    Plan:
    1. Identify the degrees of the numerator and denominator of g(z).
    2. Determine the degree 'd' of the Gauss map, which is max(deg(num), deg(den)).
    3. Use the Lopez-Ros formula for the Morse index: Index = 2d - 3.
    4. Print the steps and the final result.
