    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan and the Python code to calculate the total welfare.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand Total Welfare**: Total welfare in a market is the sum of Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS). It represents the total benefit to society from the production and consumption of a good.\n    *   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price, from quantity 0 to the equilibrium quantity (Q*).\n    *   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price, from the minimum quantity supplied to the equilibrium quantity (Q*).\n\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium**: First, we need to find the equilibrium point (Q*, P*) where the market clears. This occurs where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (Q_S = Q_D = Q*) and the price is the same for both. We find this by setting the supply and demand equations equal to each other:\n    `ln(Q³ - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`\n    This equation is complex, so we will solve it numerically to find the equilibrium quantity, Q*. Then, we'll plug Q* back into either function to find the equilibrium price, P*.\n\n3.  **Determine Integration Bounds**:\n    *   The demand function is defined for Q ≥ 0. The consumer surplus integral will be from 0 to Q*.\n    *   The supply function, `P = ln(Q³ - 2)`, is only defined when `Q³ - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > 2^(1/3)`. This is the minimum quantity producers are willing to supply. The producer surplus integral will be from this minimum quantity (`Q_min_supply`) to Q*.\n\n4.  **Calculate Surpluses and Total Welfare**:\n    *   We'll calculate CS using the definite integral: `CS = ∫[from 0 to Q*] (Demand(Q) - P*) dQ`.\n    *   We'll calculate PS using the definite integral: `PS = ∫[from Q_min_supply to Q*] (P* - Supply(Q)) dQ`.\n    *   Finally, Total Welfare (TW) is the sum: `TW = CS + PS`.\n\nThese numerical calculations will be performed using Python with the `scipy` library, which provides functions for numerical solving (`fsolve`) and integration (`quad`).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_total_welfare():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare by finding the market equilibrium,\n    computing consumer and producer surplus, and summing them.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- 1.

Find Market Equilibrium ---\n\n    def equilibrium_equation(Q):\n        \"\"\"Equation to solve for equilibrium: D(Q) - S(Q) = 0\"\"\"\n        q_val = Q[0]\n        # Supply is undefined for q_val <= 2^(1/3). Return a large number\n        # to guide the solver away from this invalid region.\n        if q_val**3 <= 2:\n            return 1e6\n        return demand(q_val) - supply(q_val)\n\n    # Solve for equilibrium quantity Q*\n    initial_guess = [4.5]\n    Q_equilibrium = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, initial_guess)[0]\n\n    # Calculate equilibrium price P*\n    P_equilibrium = demand(Q_equilibrium)\n\n    # --- 3. Calculate Consumer and Producer Surplus ---\n\n    # Consumer Surplus (CS) = ∫[0 to Q*] (D(Q) - P*) dQ\n    integrand_cs = lambda Q: demand(Q) - P_equilibrium\n    consumer_surplus, _ = quad(integrand_cs, 0, Q_equilibrium)\n\n    # Producer Surplus (PS) = ∫[Q_min to Q*] (P* - S(Q)) dQ\n    # The supply curve is defined for Q > 2^(1/3)\n    Q_min_supply = (2.0)**(1/3.0)\n    integrand_ps = lambda Q: P_equilibrium - supply(Q)\n    producer_surplus, _ = quad(integrand_ps, Q_min_supply, Q_equilibrium)\n\n    # --- 4.
