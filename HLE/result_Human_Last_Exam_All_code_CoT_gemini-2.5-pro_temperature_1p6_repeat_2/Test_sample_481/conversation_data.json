    "My plan is to identify the numerical imprints on Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules. I will then create a Python script to display this information clearly, stating which number belongs to which dosage, and then print the final numerical answer as requested.\n\n```python\n# The imprints for Teva brand fluoxetine capsules.\nimprint_10mg = \"3109\"\nimprint_20mg = \"3105\"\n\nprint(\"The numerical imprint for the Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule is:\")\nprint(imprint_10mg)\n\nprint(\"\\nThe numerical imprint for the Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule is:\")\nprint(imprint_20mg)\n\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the two different numbers are:\")\nprint(f\"{imprint_10mg} and {imprint_20mg}\")\n```\n<<<3109 and 3105>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
