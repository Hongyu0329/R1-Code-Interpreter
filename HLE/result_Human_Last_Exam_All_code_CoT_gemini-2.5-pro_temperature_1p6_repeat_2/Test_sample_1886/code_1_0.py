Furthermore, there are exceptions (e.g., 'drôle' is not from Latin), and this rule is too specific to one vowel sound to be a general orthographic function."

The circumflex marked a long vowel, a distinction that was phonemic in older forms of French (e.g., pâte with a long 'a' vs. patte with a short 'a').
