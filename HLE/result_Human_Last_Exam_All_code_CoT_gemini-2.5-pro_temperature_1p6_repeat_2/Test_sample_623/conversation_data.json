    "To determine the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules released from 1,4-¹³C glucose after glycolysis, we need to trace the labeled carbons through the metabolic pathway.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Start with Glucose:** Identify the positions of the ¹³C labels on the 6-carbon glucose molecule (C1 and C4).\n2.  **Glycolysis:**\n    *   Trace the carbons as glucose is split into two 3-carbon molecules (DHAP and G3P).\n    *   DHAP (from C1, C2, C3) is isomerized into G3P. We now have two G3P molecules.\n    *   Trace the carbons as both G3P molecules are converted into pyruvate. This will show us where the original ¹³C labels end up in the two pyruvate molecules.\n3.  **Pyruvate Decarboxylation (Link Reaction):** This is the first step where CO₂ is released from the glucose backbone. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex removes the carboxyl group (-COO⁻) from pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA and CO₂.\n4.  **Count Labeled CO₂:** By identifying which carbon from pyruvate becomes CO₂, and knowing where our ¹³C labels are, we can count the number of labeled CO₂ molecules produced.\n\nThe following Python script will execute this plan step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef trace_glucose_catabolism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the carbons of 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis and pyruvate\n    decarboxylation to determine how many labeled CO2 molecules are released.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Tracing 1,4-13C Glucose Catabolism ---\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define the starting labeled glucose molecule\n    # C1 and C4 are labeled with 13C.\n    # We use a dictionary to map carbon position to its label status.\n    glucose = {1: '13C', 2: 'C', 3: 'C', 4: '13C', 5: 'C', 6: 'C'}\n    print(f\"\\nInitial Molecule: 1,4-13C Glucose\")\n    print(f\"Carbon labels: {glucose}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Glycolysis\n    # Glucose (6C) is cleaved into DHAP (from C1,C2,C3) and G3P (from C4,C5,C6).\n    print(\"Step A: Glycolysis - Cleavage\")\n    dhap = { 'C1': glucose[1], 'C2': glucose[2], 'C3': glucose[3] }\n    g3p_1 = { 'C1': glucose[4], 'C2': glucose[5], 'C3': glucose[6] }\n    print(f\"Glucose is split into:\")\n    print(f\"  - DHAP (from Glucose C1,C2,C3) -> {dhap}\")\n    print(f\"  - G3P (from Glucose C4,C5,C6)  -> {g3p_1}\")\n\n    # DHAP is isomerized to G3P.
