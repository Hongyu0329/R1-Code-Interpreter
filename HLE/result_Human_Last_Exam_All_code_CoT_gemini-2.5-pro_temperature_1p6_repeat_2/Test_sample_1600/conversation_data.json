    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams, a(n), for order 2n in QED is a known mathematical sequence. The problem asks for the value of a(3).\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the sequence of numbers for a(n). This corresponds to the sequence A000599 in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n2.  Store the first few terms of this sequence in a Python dictionary.\n3.  Retrieve the value for n=3 from the dictionary.\n4.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    If a(n) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics, what is a(3)?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
