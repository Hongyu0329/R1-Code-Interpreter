    # We use a symbolic variable 'v' to represent the order of the original SQS(v).
    v = sympy.Symbol('v')

    # Part (a): True or False: Each element is in exactly v - 1 ND-pairs.

    # Step 1: Define the degree of a point in the ND-pair graph of the original SQS(v).
    # The degree of a point in the ND-pair graph of a nested SQS(V) is equal to r,
    # the number of blocks containing that point, which is (V-1)(V-2)/6.
    deg_v = (v - 1) * (v - 2) / 6

    # Step 2: Calculate the degree of a point, say (p, 0), in the new SQS(2v).
    # This degree is the sum of ND-pairs from Type 1 and Type 2 blocks.
    #   - Type 1 blocks contribute pairs of the form {(a,0), (b,0)}. The number of such
    #     pairs containing (p,0) is equal to the number of ND-pairs containing p
    #     in the original SQS(v), which is deg_v.
    #   - Type 2 blocks {(x,0),(y,0),(x,1),(y,1)} are nested as {{(x,0),(y,1)},{(x,1),(y,0)}}.
    #     For a point (p,0), we get ND-pairs of the form {(p,0), (y,1)} for each y != p.
    #     There are v-1 such pairs.
    contrib_type1 = deg_v
    contrib_type2 = v - 1
    deg_2v = contrib_type1 + contrib_type2

    # Step 3: Check if deg_2v is equal to v - 1, as the question claims.
    # We set up the equation deg_2v = v - 1 and solve for v.
    # (v-1)(v-2)/6 + (v-1) = v-1
    # This simplifies to (v-1)(v-2)/6 = 0, which holds for v=1 or v=2.
    # Since the problem states v >= 4, the statement is false.
    answer_a = "False"

    # Part (b): Multiplicity of an ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)}.
    
    # Step 1: Identify the origin of ND-pairs of the form {(x,0), (y,0)}.
    # In the standard doubling construction, the nesting for Type 2 blocks does not
    # create pairs where both elements have the second coordinate as 0.
    # Such pairs only arise from Type 1 blocks: a nesting {{a,b}, {c,d}} in SQS(v)
    # becomes a nesting {{(a,0),(b,0)}, {(c,1),(d,1)}} in SQS(2v).
    # Step 2: Relate the multiplicity.
    # For every instance of {x,y} as an ND-pair in the original SQS(v), a single
    # ND-pair {(x,0), (y,0)} is created in the SQS(2v).
    # Therefore, if {x,y} has multiplicity μ, then {(x,0), (y,0)} also has multiplicity μ.
    answer_b = "μ"

    # Part (c): Must there exist ND-pairs with multiplicity exactly v?

    # Step 1: Analyze the possible multiplicities of any ND-pair in the new design.
    #  - Type `{(x,0), (y,0)}` or `{(x,1), (y,1)}`: Multiplicity is μ_xy from the SQS(v).
    #    The maximum value for μ_xy is (v-2)/2 (the number of blocks containing {x,y}).
    #    For v>=4, (v-2)/2 < v. So multiplicity cannot be v.
    #  - Type `{(x,0), (y,1)}` or `{(x,1), (y,0)}`: Multiplicity is 1.
    #    For v>=4, 1 < v. So multiplicity cannot be v.
    # Step 2: Conclude based on the analysis.
    # No type of ND-pair in the constructed design can have a multiplicity of exactly v.
