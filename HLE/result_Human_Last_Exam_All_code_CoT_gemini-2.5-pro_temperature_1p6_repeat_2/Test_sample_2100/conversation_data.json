    "This is a historical riddle. I will first identify the key clues and then use them to determine the historical figure.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** The riddle provides three main clues:\n    *   The person was called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky.\n    *   His grave was lost for a very long time.\n    *   The location of his grave was discovered in the late 1980s (specifically, in 1991 by a Russian-Danish expedition).\n\n2.  **Identify the Person:** These clues point to Vitus Bering, a Danish explorer in the service of the Russian Navy. He died in 1741 on an island that was later named after him (Bering Island). His grave's exact location was unknown until the expedition in 1991 found and identified his remains. The description by Voznesensky fits the romanticized image of these early Russian explorers.\n\n3.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that states these facts and prints the final last name.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# A function to solve the riddle based on historical facts.\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the clues provided in the riddle to identify the historical figure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clue 1: The poetic description by Andrei Voznesensky.\n    poet = \"Andrei Voznesensky\"\n    description = \"a joy-discovering sailor\"\n\n    # Clue 2: The mystery of the lost grave.\n    mystery_question = \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\"\n\n    # Clue 3: The discovery of the grave. The expedition that found the grave occurred in 1991,\n    # which aligns with the \"late 1980s\" timeframe mentioned.\n    discovery_info = \"The grave was discovered by a Russian-Danish expedition in 1991.\"\n\n    # The Solution: The clues point to the famous explorer Vitus Bering.\n    last_name = \"Bering\"\n\n    # Printing the answer in a structured way.\n    print(f\"The poet {poet} called a famous explorer '{description}'.\")\n    print(f\"For centuries, his burial site was unknown, leading to the question: '{mystery_question}'\")\n    print(f\"The answer was found when his remains were discovered in the early 1990s.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe man's last name is:\")\n    # sys.stdout.flush() helps ensure the print order is as expected.\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n    print(last_name)\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Bering>>>"
