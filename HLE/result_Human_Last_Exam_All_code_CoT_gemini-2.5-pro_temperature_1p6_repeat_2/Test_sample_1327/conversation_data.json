    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the number sequence problem:\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between consecutive terms.** Let's denote the sequence as `x_n`, where `x_1=2`, `x_2=11`, and so on. We will test for simple arithmetic or geometric patterns.\n2.  **Identify a recurrence relation.** We will look for a pattern of the form `x_{n+1} = a * x_n + b_n`, where `a` is a constant and `b_n` is a sequence that may depend on `n`.\n3.  **Test the hypothesis `x_{n+1} = 3 * x_n - k_n`**.\n    *   For `n=2`: `x_3 = 23`. We test `3 * x_2 = 3 * 11 = 33`. To get 23, we need to subtract 10. So, `x_3 = 3 * x_2 - 10`.\n    *   For `n=3`: `x_4 = 51`. We test `3 * x_3 = 3 * 23 = 69`. To get 51, we need to subtract 18. So, `x_4 = 3 * x_3 - 18`.\n    *   For `n=4`: `x_5 = 119`. We test `3 * x_4 = 3 * 51 = 153`. To get 119, we need to subtract 34. So, `x_5 = 3 * x_4 - 34`.\n4.  **Analyze the sequence of subtrahends `k_n`**. The sequence of numbers we subtract is `10, 18, 34, ...`.\n5.  **Find the pattern within the `k_n` sequence.**\n    *   The difference between `18` and `10` is `8`.\n    *   The difference between `34` and `18` is `16`.\n    *   The differences themselves (`8, 16`) form a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2. The next difference should be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n6.  **Calculate the next subtrahend.** The next term in the `k_n` sequence is `34 + 32 = 66`.\n7.  **Calculate the final term in the original sequence.** Using the rule `x_6 = 3 * x_5 - 66`, we calculate the missing number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the number sequence puzzle and explains the pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    \n    # The pattern identified is x_{n+1} = 3*x_n - k_n starting from n=2.\n    # Let's find the sequence k_n.\n    k2 = 3 * x[1] - x[2]  # k for x_3\n    k3 = 3 * x[2] - x[3]  # k for x_4\n    k4 = 3 * x[3] - x[4]  # k for x_5\n    \n    # The sequence of subtrahends is k = [10, 18, 34, ...]\n    \n    # The differences in k are:\n    diff1 = k3 - k2  # 18 - 10 = 8\n    diff2 = k4 - k3  # 34 - 18 = 16\n    \n    # The differences form a geometric progression with ratio 2.\n    # The next difference is:\n    next_diff = diff2 * 2  # 16 * 2 = 32\n    \n    # The next subtrahend is:\n    next_k = k4 + next_diff # 34 + 32 = 66\n    \n    # Now, calculate the next term in the main sequence.\n    next_x = 3 * x[4] - next_k\n    \n    print(\"The sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ...\")\n    print(\"The pattern is that each term (starting from the third) is 3 times the previous term minus a value.\")\n    print(f\"Equation for the 3rd term: {x[2]} = 3 * {x[1]} - {k2}\")\n    print(f\"Equation for the 4th term: {x[3]} = 3 * {x[2]} - {k3}\")\n    print(f\"Equation for the 5th term: {x[4]} = 3 * {x[3]} - {k4}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe sequence of subtrahends is 10, 18, 34, ...\")\n    print(\"The differences in this sequence are 8, 16, ... which double each time.\")\n    print(f\"The next difference is {diff2} * 2 = {next_diff}.\")\n    print(f\"The next subtrahend is {k4} + {next_diff} = {next_k}.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the final equation to find the missing number is:\")\n    print(f\"Missing Number = 3 * {x[4]} - {next_k} = {next_x}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
