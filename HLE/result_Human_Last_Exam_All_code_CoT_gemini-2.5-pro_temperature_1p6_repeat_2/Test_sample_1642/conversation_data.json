    "This problem is a variant of the well-known N-Queens problem. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify the Board Size (N):** The chessboard is 16x16, so N = 16.\n2.  **Recall the N-Queens Principle:** For any N x N board, the maximum number of queens that can be placed so that no two queens attack each other is N. This is because each queen must occupy its own row and column.\n3.  **Determine the Total Number of Queens:** The problem states there are `m` white queens and `m` black queens. The total number of queens on the board is `m + m = 2m`.\n4.  **Form the Equation:** Since the total number of non-attacking queens cannot exceed N, we can find the maximum `m` by setting the total number of queens equal to the maximum capacity of the board. This gives us the equation: `2 * m = N`.\n5.  **Solve for m:** By substituting N=16 into the equation, we get `2 * m = 16`. Solving for `m` gives us `m = 16 / 2 = 8`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the size of the chessboard\nN = 16\n\n# The total number of queens is m white queens + m black queens = 2*m.\n# The maximum number of non-attacking queens on an N x N board is N.\n# To find the maximum value for m, we set the total number of queens equal to N.\n# The equation is: 2 * m = N\n\n# Solve for m\nm = N / 2\n\n# Ensure m is an integer for the final output\nm_int = int(m)\n\n# Print the final result including the equation with the solved value of m.\nprint(f\"The maximum number of queens (m) of each color is found by solving the equation 2 * m = {N}.\")\nprint(f\"Solving for m gives m = {N} / 2 = {m_int}.\")\nprint(\"The final equation with the numbers is:\")\nprint(f\"2 * {m_int} = {N}\")\n\n```\n<<<8>>>"
