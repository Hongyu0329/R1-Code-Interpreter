    "Of course. Here is a plan to determine the specific verses.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  I will first identify the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi.\n2.  I will then locate the section within the poem that begins listing the names of the prophets.\n3.  The verse that introduces the list is bayt 37, which states that the details of 25 prophets are binding.\n4.  The actual enumeration of the prophets' names begins in the very next verse, bayt 38.\n5.  I will follow the list of names through the subsequent verses until the last prophet is named to find the concluding bayt.\n6.  Finally, I will write a simple Python script to store the starting and ending bayt numbers and print the answer in a clear sentence, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_verses_in_poem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt)\n    in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Bayt 37 introduces the list, stating 25 prophets will be named.\n    # The actual list begins in the next bayt.\n    start_bayt = 38\n    \n    # The list of prophets concludes with 'Isa and Taha (Muhammad)\n    end_bayt = 41\n\n    print(f\"The names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are found from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe specific verses are:\")\n    print(f\"Bayt {start_bayt}: Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, Salih, Ibrahim\")\n    print(f\"Bayt {start_bayt + 1}: Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, Ayyub\")\n    print(f\"Bayt {start_bayt + 2}: Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman\")\n    print(f\"Bayt {end_bayt}: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, Taha (Muhammad)\")\n\nfind_prophets_verses_in_poem()\n```\n<<<From bayt 38 to bayt 41>>>"
