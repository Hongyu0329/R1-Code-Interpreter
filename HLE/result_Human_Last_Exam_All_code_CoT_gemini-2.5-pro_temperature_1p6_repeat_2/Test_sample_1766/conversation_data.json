    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve for the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the quantum numbers**: For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`, and the spin quantum number is `s=1/2`.\n2.  **Determine possible total angular momentum (j)**: The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, can take values from `|l-s|` to `l+s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Calculate eigenvalues for each j**: For each possible value of `j`:\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $J^2$ operator is given by the formula `j(j+1)ħ²`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by `m_j * ħ`, where the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n4.  **Display the results**: The Python script will calculate these values and print them out clearly, showing the common eigenvalues for each state. The `fractions` module will be used for precise calculations with fractional numbers. Finally, I'll provide the total degeneracy of the system as the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues for J^2 and J_z\n    for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
