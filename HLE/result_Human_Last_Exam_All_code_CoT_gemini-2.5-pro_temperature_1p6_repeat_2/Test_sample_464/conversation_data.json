    "Yes, it does follow that $f=0$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the proof, illustrated with a Python script using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the Goal:** We want to prove that if a Schwartz function $f$ has all its moments equal to zero, then $f$ must be the zero function.\n2.  **Introduce the Tool:** The Fourier transform is the ideal tool for this problem because it beautifully connects the moments of a function to the derivatives of its transform.\n3.  **Connect Moments to the Fourier Transform:** We will show that the $k$-th moment of $f(x)$ is directly proportional to the $k$-th derivative of its Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, evaluated at $\\xi=0$.\n4.  **Apply the Condition:** The given condition (all moments are zero) implies that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin are zero.\n5.  **Use Taylor Series:** A function whose derivatives are all zero at a point has a trivial Taylor series (all terms are zero). Since the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function is analytic, it must be equal to its Taylor series. This forces the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ to be identically zero everywhere.\n6.  **Conclude:** By the uniqueness of the Fourier transform, if $\\hat{f}(\\xi)=0$ for all $\\xi$, then the original function $f(x)$ must also be zero for all $x$.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes and demonstrates the key steps of this argument.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef demonstrate_moment_problem_proof():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates symbolically that if all moments of a Schwartz function are zero,\n    the function itself must be zero.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Setup: Define symbols and the core idea ---\n    print(\"--- The Moment Problem for Schwartz Functions ---\")\n    print(\"Problem: If f(x) is a Schwartz function and Integral(x^k * f(x) dx) = 0 for all k=0, 1, 2,..., does f(x) = 0?\")\n    print(\"\\nPlan: We will analyze this using the Fourier Transform, F(xi), of f(x).\")\n\n    # Define symbolic variables for demonstration\n    x, xi = sympy.symbols('x xi', real=True)\n    k = sympy.Symbol('k', integer=True, nonnegative=True)\n    I = sympy.I # The imaginary unit\n\n    # --- Step 1: Relate Fourier Transform Derivatives to Moments ---\n    print(\"\\nThe Fourier Transform is F(xi) = Integral(f(x) * exp(-2*pi*i*x*xi) dx).\")\n    print(\"Its k-th derivative at xi=0, F^(k)(0), relates to the k-th moment of f(x).\")\n    print(\"F^(k)(0) = Integral( f(x) * [d^k/dxi^k(exp(-2*pi*i*x*xi))]_(xi=0) dx )\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Differentiate the Fourier Kernel ---\n    print(\"\\nLet's analyze the derivative of the kernel term, exp(-2*pi*i*x*xi), with respect to xi.\")\n    kernel = sympy.exp(-2 * sympy.pi * I * x * xi)\n    \n    # Calculate the general k-th derivative and evaluate it at xi = 0\n    # The derivative of exp(a*xi) w.r.t. xi is a*exp(a*xi).\n    # The k-th derivative is a^k*exp(a*xi), where a = -2*pi*i*x.\n    kernel_k_derivative = (-2 * sympy.pi * I * x)**k * kernel\n    kernel_k_derivative_at_0 = kernel_k_derivative.subs(xi, 0)\n    \n    print(f\"The k-th derivative of the kernel with respect to xi is: ({kernel_k_derivative})\")\n    print(f\"Evaluating this derivative at xi = 0 gives: {kernel_k_derivative_at_0}\")\n    \n    # --- Step 3: Form the Key Equation ---\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting this back gives the full relationship:\")\n    # Using sympy's pretty print to format the equation\n    moment = sympy.Integral(x**k * f(x), (x, -sympy.oo, sympy.oo))\n    F_k_0 = sympy.Derivative(sympy.Function('F')(xi), (xi, k)).subs(xi, 0)\n    \n    equation = sympy.Eq(F_k_0, (-2 * sympy.pi * I)**k * moment)\n    print(\"The k-th derivative of the Fourier transform at the origin is proportional to the k-th moment:\")\n    sympy.pprint(equation, use_unicode=True)\n    \n    # --- Step 4: Apply the Condition and Conclude ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"We are given that the moment, Integral(x^k * f(x) dx), is 0 for all k.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, from the equation above, the k-th derivative of F(xi) at xi=0 must also be 0 for all k.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe Taylor series for F(xi) around xi=0 is Sum[ (F^(k)(0) / k!) * xi^k ].\")\n    print(\"Since all derivatives F^(k)(0) are 0, the Taylor series is 0.\")\n    print(\"For a Schwartz function, its Fourier transform is analytic, so F(xi) must be identically 0 for all xi.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinally, by the uniqueness of the inverse Fourier transform, if F(xi) = 0, then f(x) must be 0.\")\n\ndemonstrate_moment_problem_proof()\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
