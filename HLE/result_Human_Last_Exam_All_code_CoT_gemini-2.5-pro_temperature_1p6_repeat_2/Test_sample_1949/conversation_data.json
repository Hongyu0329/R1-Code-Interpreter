    "To identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **List Rivers:** I will compile a list of real-world rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid. These include rivers from Italy, Greece, the Near East, and other regions known to the Romans. Mythological rivers of the underworld will be excluded as they don't have a measurable length.\n2.  **Find Lengths:** I will find the approximate modern lengths of these rivers in kilometers.\n3.  **Sort and Select:** I will store this data and then sort the list of rivers by length in descending order.\n4.  **Output:** Finally, I will select the top three and display their names and lengths.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_aeneid_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest real-world rivers mentioned in the Aeneid,\n    sorts them by length, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of major real-world rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate lengths in km.\n    # Sources for mentions include: Nile (Aen. 8.711-713), Danube/Ister (Aen. 8.727),\n    # Euphrates (Aen. 8.726), Ganges (Aen. 8.728), Tigris (Aen. 8.728, inferred),\n    # Rhine (Aen. 8.727), Araxes (Aen. 8.728), Tiber (frequently), etc.\n    river_data = {\n        \"Nile\": 6650,\n        \"Danube\": 2850,\n        \"Euphrates\": 2800,\n        \"Ganges\": 2525,\n        \"Tigris\": 1850,\n        \"Rhine\": 1230,\n        \"Araxes\": 1072,\n        \"Po (as Eridanus)\": 652,\n        \"Tiber\": 406\n    }\n\n    # Sort the rivers by length in descending order\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(river_data.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three\n    top_three = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, (name, length) in enumerate(top_three, 1):\n        print(f\"{i}. {name}: approximately {length} km\")\n\nfind_longest_aeneid_rivers()\n\n<<<Nile, Danube, Euphrates>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
