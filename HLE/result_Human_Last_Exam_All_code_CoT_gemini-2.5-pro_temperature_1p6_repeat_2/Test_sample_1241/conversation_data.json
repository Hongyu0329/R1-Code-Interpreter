    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we first need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. The steady state is reached when $t \\to +\\infty$, at which point the probabilities no longer change with time, meaning their derivatives, $P_{i}'(t)$, become zero.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Set the derivatives in the given Kolmogorov-Chapman equations to zero. This transforms the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n2.  The resulting system of equations for the steady-state probabilities $P_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ is:\n    *   $-\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1} = 0$\n    *   $\\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3} = 0$\n    *   $\\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_{2} = 0$\n    *   $\\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3} = 0$\n3.  We also have the normalization condition that the sum of all probabilities must equal 1:\n    *   $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n4.  Not all of the first four equations are linearly independent. I will select three independent equations from the original system and combine them with the normalization condition to form a solvable system of four linear equations for the four unknown probabilities ($P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$).\n5.  I will implement a Python script to solve this system. The script will use the `numpy` library to represent the system in matrix form ($Ax = b$) and solve for the vector of probabilities `x`.\n6.  After finding the values of $P_0, P_1, P_2$, and $P_3$, I will calculate the required sum, $P_0 + P_1$, and print the result, showing the individual values and their sum explicitly.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_steady_state_probabilities():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the steady-state probabilities for the given Kolmogorov-Chepmen system.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given lambda parameters\n    lambda_01 = 0.019\n    lambda_10 = 0.65\n    lambda_12 = 0.4\n    lambda_21 = 0.392\n    lambda_23 = 0.008\n    lambda_31 = 0.008\n\n    # At steady state (t -> +infinity), the derivatives P_i'(t) are zero.\n    # This leads to a system of linear equations.
