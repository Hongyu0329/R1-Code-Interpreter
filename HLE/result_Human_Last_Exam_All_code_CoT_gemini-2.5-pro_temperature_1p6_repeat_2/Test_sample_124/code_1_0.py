# Step 1: Analyze each statement about the junction tree algorithm.
# A: False. For graphs with high treewidth, approximate inference methods are more computationally efficient.
# B: False. The junction tree algorithm is not resilient to high treewidth; its complexity is exponential in it.
# C: True. The nodes of the junction tree are cliques, and the algorithm manipulates potentials which represent joint distributions over the variables in those cliques.
# D: False. The premise "the junction tree algorithm is resilient to graphs with high treewidth" is false.
# E: True. The exponential dependence on treewidth makes the algorithm impractical for graphs where this value is high.
# F: False. Same as D.
# G: True. The reason the algorithm is not resilient to high treewidth is precisely because it must handle joint distributions over potentially very large cliques, which is computationally expensive.
# H: False. The cost scales exponentially, not linearly, with the number of variables in the largest clique.
# I: True. The size of the potential tables, and thus the computational cost, grows exponentially with the number of variables in the largest clique.
# J: False. The efficiency is heavily dependent on the size of the largest clique.
# L: True. This is a correct statement of the running intersection property's implication. For any variable, the set of cliques containing it must form a connected subtree.

# Step 2: Collect the letters of the true statements.
correct_statements = ['C', 'E', 'G', 'I', 'L']

# Step 3: Format the output as a comma-separated list enclosed in brackets.
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as outputting each letter.
output_string = "{" + ", ".join(correct_statements) + "}"

# Step 4: Print the final formatted string.
print(output_string)
