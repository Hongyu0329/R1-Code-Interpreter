        "1. 'Naked, cold'": "This points to a subject associated with cold temperature and bareness. This aligns well with frost, which is inherently cold.",
        "2. 'knits a veil', 'lace', 'feather stitch'": "These are metaphors for creating something intricate and web-like. This strongly describes the patterns frost makes on surfaces.",
        "3. 'She's lace and glass'": "This is a key descriptor. 'Lace' reinforces the intricate pattern, while 'glass' points to something crystalline, fragile, and transparentâ€”a perfect description of ice crystals (frost).",
        "4. 'from starwort, grass and meadowsweet'": "The creation is formed upon plants and other natural elements, which is exactly where frost appears.",
        "5. 'waits for pelted Autumn and his echoed roar'": "The subject ('she') is presented as separate from and preceding the full force of Autumn ('he'). This depicts the dynamic of early morning frost which is destroyed by the day's sun or autumn winds.",
        "6. 'to fray each feather stitch'": "This highlights the fragility and transient nature of the creation. Frost patterns are delicate and melt or break apart easily."
