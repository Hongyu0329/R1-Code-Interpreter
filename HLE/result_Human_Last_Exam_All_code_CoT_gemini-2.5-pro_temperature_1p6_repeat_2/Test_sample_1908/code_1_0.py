# The problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements a topology T on a set X
# of cardinality c can have, given T is neither trivial nor discrete.

# Let C(T) be the set of complements to a topology T. We want to find min |C(T)|
# over all possible valid topologies T.

# Based on established results in general topology:
# 1. The number of complements can be 0. There exist topologies that have no complements.
# 2. The number of complements cannot be 1 for any topology on an infinite set.
# 3. For any integer n >= 2, there exists a topology with exactly n complements.

# The set of possible values for the number of complements is {0, 2, 3, 4, ...}.
# The smallest number in this set is 0.

smallest_possible_number_of_complements = 0

# There is no equation, just the final number.
# As per the instruction "output each number in the final equation!", I will just print the number.
