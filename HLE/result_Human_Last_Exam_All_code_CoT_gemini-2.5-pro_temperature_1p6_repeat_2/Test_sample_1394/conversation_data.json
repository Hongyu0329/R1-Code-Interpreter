    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the differential equation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Rearrange the Equation**: The given differential equation is a non-linear first-order ODE. I will start by rearranging it into a quadratic equation in terms of the term $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. This makes it easier to handle. The term $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ can be expressed as $\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d(y^2)}{dx}$.\n\n2.  **Solve the Quadratic Equation**: I will solve the resulting quadratic equation for $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. This will express the derivative in terms of $x$ and $y$.\n\n3.  **Substitution**: The expression for the derivative will be complex. To simplify it, I will use a substitution. First, let $u = y^2$. This simplifies the equation to a form involving $\\frac{du}{dx}$. The resulting equation will still contain a complicated square root term.\n\n4.  **Second Substitution**: I will introduce a second substitution, letting $w$ be equal to the expression under the square root. This key step will transform the complex equation into a much simpler separable differential equation.\n\n5.  **Solve the Separable Equation**: I will solve this separable equation by integrating both sides. This will give a solution for $w$ in terms of $x$ and an arbitrary constant of integration, which I'll call $C$.\n\n6.  **Back-Substitution**: I will substitute back for $w$ and then for $u$ to obtain the general solution for the original differential equation in terms of $x$, $y$, and the constant $C$.\n\n7.  **Final Code**: Finally, I will provide a Python code block that uses the `print()` function to display the general solution.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_and_present_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the steps to find the general solution of the given ODE\n    and prints the final solution.\n\n    The equation is: x^2 * y^2 = x^3 * y * y' + y^2 * (y')^2 + x * y * y' + 9 * x^2\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. Rearrange the equation\n    # Let p = dy/dx.

Second substitution\n    # Let w = (x^2+1)^2 + 4*u - 36\n    # dw/dx = 2*(x^2+1)*2x + 4*du/dx = 4x*(x^2+1) + 4*du/dx\n    # So, du/dx = (1/4)*dw/dx - x*(x^2+1)\n    # Substituting du/dx into the equation:\n    # (1/4)*dw/dx - x*(x^2+1) = -x*(x^2+1) +/- x*sqrt(w)\n    # (1/4)*dw/dx = +/- x*sqrt(w)\n    # dw/dx = +/- 4*x*sqrt(w)\n\n    # 3.
