    This script explains and presents the asymptotic analysis of the billiard
    generating function H(s, s') for a planar billiard system.

    The generating function H(s, s') for the billiard map is the length of the
    chord connecting two points, s and s', on the boundary of the billiard table.
    This analysis examines the behavior of H(s, s') when the distance between
    these points, measured along the boundary, becomes very small.

    The result reveals the fundamental connection between the local geometry
    of the boundary (its curvature, κ(s)) and the system's dynamics.
