    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve for the greatest common right divisor (GCRD):\n\n1.  **State the Theorem**: The Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices `P1` and `P2`, denoted as `GCRD(P1, P2)`, can be found by relating it to the Greatest Common Left Divisor (GCLD). The governing theorem is: `GCRD(P1, P2) = [GCLD(P1^T, P2^T)]^T`, where `T` indicates the transpose of a matrix.\n\n2.  **Transpose the Matrices**: First, we find the transposes of `P1` and `P2`.\n    *   `P1^T = [[s^2 + s, -s^2 - 1], [-s, s^2]]`\n    *   `P2^T = [[s, -s - 1], [0, 1]]`\n\n3.  **Find the GCLD via Row Reduction**: The GCLD of `P1^T` and `P2^T` can be determined by stacking them into a single matrix `M = [P1^T; P2^T]` and then applying polynomial elementary row operations to reduce `M` to its simplest form (a basis for the row space).\n    *   The stacked matrix is:\n        `M = [[s^2 + s, -s^2 - 1], [-s, s^2], [s, -s - 1], [0, 1]]`\n    *   Use the last row `[0, 1]` to eliminate the second-column entries in the other rows.\n    *   The rows `[s^2 + s, 0]`, `[-s, 0]`, and `[s, 0]` are obtained. The fourth row remains `[0, 1]`.\n    *   Notice that the first three new rows are all multiples of `[s, 0]`. We can perform further row operations to reduce them, leaving `[s, 0]` and two zero rows.\n    *   The non-zero rows that form a basis for the row space of `M` are `[s, 0]` and `[0, 1]`.\n\n4.  **Construct GCLD and GCRD**:\n    *   The non-zero rows form the GCLD:\n        `GCLD(P1^T, P2^T) = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`\n    *   According to the theorem, the GCRD is the transpose of this matrix:\n        `GCRD(P1, P2) = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]^T = [[s, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\n5.  **Final Output**: The resulting GCRD matrix will be printed.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of\n    two given polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n    \n    The method used is based on a standard result in linear systems theory:\n    GCRD(P1, P2) = [GCLD(P1^T, P2^T)]^T\n    where GCLD is the Greatest Common Left Divisor and T denotes the transpose.\n\n    The GCLD of P1^T and P2^T is found by performing elementary row operations\n    on the stacked matrix [P1^T; P2^T] to reduce it to its Hermite Normal Form.\n    The non-zero rows of the resulting matrix form the GCLD.\n\n    P1 = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n          [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\n\n    P2 = [[s, 0],\n          [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n    Step 1: Transpose the matrices.\n    P1^T = [[s^2 + s, -s^2 - 1],\n            [-s,      s^2]]\n\n    P2^T = [[s, -s - 1],\n            [0, 1]]\n\n    Step 2: Form the stacked matrix M = [P1^T; P2^T].\n    M = [[s^2 + s, -s^2 - 1],  (R1)\n         [-s,      s^2],       (R2)\n         [s,       -s - 1],    (R3)\n         [0,       1]]        (R4)\n\n    Step 3: Perform polynomial elementary row operations to reduce M.\n    We use R4 = [0, 1] to simplify the second column of the other rows.\n    - R1' = R1 + (s^2 + 1) * R4 = [s^2 + s, 0]\n    - R2' = R2 - s^2 * R4      = [-s, 0]\n    - R3' = R3 + (s + 1) * R4  = [s, 0]\n\n    The matrix becomes:\n    M' = [[s^2 + s, 0],\n          [-s,      0],\n          [s,       0],\n          [0,       1]]\n\n    Step 4: Further reduce the matrix.\n    The first three rows are all polynomial multiples of the vector [s, 0].\n    - R1'' = R1' - (s + 1) * R3' = [0, 0]\n    - R2'' = R2' + R3'           = [0, 0]\n\n    The remaining independent non-zero rows are [s, 0] and [0, 1].\n\n    Step 5: The non-zero rows form the GCLD of the transposed matrices.\n    GCLD(P1^T, P2^T) = [[s, 0],\n                        [0, 1]]\n\n    Step 6: The GCRD is the transpose of the GCLD.\n    GCRD(P1, P2) = [[s, 0],\n                    [0, 1]]\n    \"\"\"\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n    \n    # The GCRD matrix D(s) as determined by the algorithm\n    gcrd_matrix = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [0, 1]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The greatest common right divisor is the matrix GCRD(s):\")\n    sympy.pprint(gcrd_matrix)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe individual elements of the final GCRD matrix are:\")\n    print(f\"GCRD(1,1) = {gcrd_matrix[0,0]}\")\n    print(f\"GCRD(1,2) = {gcrd_matrix[0,1]}\")\n    print(f\"GCRD(2,1) = {gcrd_matrix[1,0]}\")\n    print(f\"GCRD(2,2) = {gcrd_matrix[1,1]}\")\n\nsolve_gcrd()\n<<<[[s, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
