    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan for solving the problem, followed by the Python code to present the answer.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reagents**: The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. The reagents are sec-BuLi/TMEDA followed by methyl iodide. This is a classic two-step organic synthesis reaction.\n2.  **Step 1: Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**:\n    *   sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium) is a very strong base. TMEDA (tetramethylethylenediamine) chelates the lithium ion, increasing the basicity of the base and its reactivity.\n    *   The starting molecule has two functional groups that can direct the lithiation (deprotonation of an adjacent C-H bond on the ring): the amide group (`-CONEt2`) and the dimethylamino group (`-NMe2`). These are known as Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs).\n    *   The amide group at position 1 directs lithiation to its ortho-positions (positions 2 and 6).\n    *   The dimethylamino group at position 3 directs lithiation to its ortho-positions (positions 2 and 4).\n    *   Both groups direct the deprotonation to position 2. This synergistic effect makes the hydrogen at position 2 the most acidic, and it will be selectively removed by the sec-BuLi.\n    *   This creates a reactive intermediate, an aryllithium species, with a lithium atom at position 2.\n3.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Quench**:\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate is a powerful nucleophile.\n    *   Methyl iodide (`CH3I`) is added, which is an electrophile.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon at position 2 of the ring attacks the methyl group, displacing the iodide ion.\n    *   This results in the formation of a C-C bond, attaching a methyl group at position 2 of the benzene ring.\n4.  **Final Product**: The final product is N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-(dimethylamino)benzamide.\n5.  **Python Code**: The Python code will first explain the chemistry. Then, it will programmatically confirm the IUPAC name of the predicted product using its SMILES string and the `pubchempy` library. Finally, it will display the full reaction equation and extract all the locant numbers from the names of the compounds involved as requested.\n\n```python\nimport re\ntry:\n    import pubchempy as pcp\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"PubChemPy library not found.
