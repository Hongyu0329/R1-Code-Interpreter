    """
    This function explains and prints the derived optimal feedback factor 'b'.
    
    The derivation proceeds as follows:
    1. The mutual information is proportional to log(|K_{X+Z}|). Maximizing it is equivalent to maximizing |K_{X+Z}|.
    2. The determinant is: |K_{X+Z}| = (P_1+1)(P_s+1) - alpha^2 + P_1*b^2 - 2*b*alpha*P_1.
    3. The power constraint is P_1 + P_s + b^2 = 2P. We fix P_1 and optimize for b.
       This means P_s = (2P - P_1) - b^2.
    4. Substituting P_s into the determinant expression gives a function of b:
       f(b) = C - b^2 - 2*alpha*P_1*b, where C is a constant with respect to b.
    5. This is a downward-opening parabola, maximized where its derivative is zero:
       f'(b) = -2*b - 2*alpha*P_1 = 0
    6. Solving for b yields the optimal relationship.
