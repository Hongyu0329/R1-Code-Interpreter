    # Option A analysis
    # "For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig'
    # that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability."
    # Fact: ECDSA is malleable. If sig = (r, s), then sig' = (r, -s mod n) is also a valid signature for m.
