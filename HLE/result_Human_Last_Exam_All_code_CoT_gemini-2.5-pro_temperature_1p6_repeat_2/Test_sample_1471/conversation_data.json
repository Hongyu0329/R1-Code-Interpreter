    "I will first convert the Roman numerals into modern numbers, then perform the requested calculation, and finally, present the entire process and the result in a Python script.\n\n1.  **VIII** is `8`.\n2.  **CCC** is `300`.\n3.  **CCLXXXVIII** is `100 + 100 + 50 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1` = `288`.\n4.  The equation is **8 / 300 - 288**.\n5.  I will calculate the result of this equation using Python.\n\n```python\n# Convert Roman numerals to modern numbers\nnum1 = 8  # VIII\nnum2 = 300 # CCC\nnum3 = 288 # CCLXXXVIII\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# Print the equation in modern numbers and its solution\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-287.9733333333333>>>"
