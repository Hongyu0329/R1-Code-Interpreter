# Step 1: Define properties of the variety
n = 102  # Dimension of the ambient space CP^n
degrees = [2, 2]  # Degrees of the defining polynomials
k = len(degrees)
m = n - k  # Dimension of the complete intersection X

# Step 2 has been outlined above, leading to the formula b_m = chi(X) - m.

# Step 3 and 4: Calculate the Euler Characteristic by computing the relevant coefficient using residue calculus.
# Let F(z) = (1+z)^(n+1) / (z^(m+1) * product(1+d*z)).
# We need a_m = Res(F, z=0).

# Calculate residue at z = -1/2
# Res(F, -1/2) = (1/4) * d/dz( (1+z)^(n+1) / z^(m+1) ) at z=-1/2
z = Fraction(-1, 2)
# g'(z) = ((1+z)**(n+1-1) * ((n+1-m-1)*z - (m+1))) / z**(m+1+1)
# g'(z) = ((1+z)**(n) * ((n-m)*z - (m+1))) / z**(m+2)
# With our values n=102, m=100
# g'(z) = ((1+z)**102 * (2*z - 101)) / z**102
g_prime_at_z0 = ((1 + z)**102 * (2 * z - 101)) / z**102
res_at_z0 = Fraction(1, 4) * g_prime_at_z0

# Calculate residue at infinity
# Res(F, inf) = -Res((1/w^2) * F(1/w), w=0)
# F(1/w) = (w+1)^(n+1) / ( (w+degrees[0]) * (w+degrees[1]) ) in our case
# h(w) = - (w+1)^(n+1) / ((w+2)*(w+2))
# We need h'(0)
w = 0
h_prime_at_0 = -Fraction(
    (n + 1) * (w + 1)**n * (w + 2)**2 - (w + 1)**(n + 1) * 2 * (w + 2),
    (w + 2)**4
)
res_at_inf = h_prime_at_0

# a_m = - (Res(F,-1/2) + Res(F,inf))
a_m = -(res_at_z0 + res_at_inf)

# chi(X) = product(degrees) * a_m
deg_X = 1
for d in degrees:
    deg_X *= d
chi_X = deg_X * a_m

# b_m = chi(X) - m
b_m = chi_X - m
