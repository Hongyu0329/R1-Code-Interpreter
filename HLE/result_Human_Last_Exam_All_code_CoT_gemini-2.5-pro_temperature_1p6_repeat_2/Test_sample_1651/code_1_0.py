    This function solves a theoretical problem about the Stone-Cech compactification.
    The solution is not found by computation, but by applying known mathematical theorems.

    Problem:
    Let f: R -> R be a continuous function. Let X be the Stone-Cech compactification
    of R, and F: X -> X be the extension of f. What is the smallest possible
    nonzero number of fixed points of F in the Stone-Cech remainder Y = X \ R?

    Reasoning:
    1. Fixed points of F in Y can only exist if f is unbounded at +infinity or -infinity.
       This induces a continuous self-map g on a part of the remainder (e.g., on Y+ or Y-).

    2. Theorem 1 (Hindman): Any such continuous self-map g must have at least one fixed point.
       This means the number of fixed points, if non-zero, is >= 1.

    3. Theorem 2 (Iliadis): The number of fixed points of such a self-map g cannot be exactly one.
       This means the number of fixed points is not equal to 1.

    4. Conclusion from theorems: If the number of fixed points is non-zero, it must be >= 2.

    5. Example of achievability: For the function f(x) = x + 1, it is a known result
       that its extension F has exactly two fixed points in the remainder.

    Therefore, the smallest possible non-zero number of fixed points is 2.
