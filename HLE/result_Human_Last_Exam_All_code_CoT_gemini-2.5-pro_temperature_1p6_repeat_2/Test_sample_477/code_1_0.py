    print("  - Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1) is caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat.")
    print("  - A key feature of DM1 is 'somatic instability', where the number of CTG repeats increases in body tissues over time.")
    print("  - LIG1 (DNA Ligase I) is an essential enzyme for sealing breaks in DNA during replication and repair.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: Connecting LIG1 to CTG instability")
    print("  - The CTG repeats can form unusual secondary structures (hairpins) that are processed by DNA repair machinery.")
    print("  - LIG1 is thought to be involved in an expansion-prone repair pathway. It performs the final step of ligating (sealing) the DNA strand after a hairpin has been processed in a way that incorporates extra repeats.")
    
    print("\nStep 3: Determining the impact of LIG1 knockout/knockdown")
    print("  - Studies in mouse models of Myotonic Dystrophy have shown that reducing the amount or activity of LIG1 leads to a significant decrease in the somatic expansion of CTG repeats.")
    print("  - This implies that LIG1's normal function inadvertently facilitates the expansion process on these repetitive sequences.")
    print("  - Therefore, inhibiting LIG1 reduces the overall rate of expansion, leading to reduced somatic instability.")
