    print("2. Totally Disconnected Space: A space where the only connected subsets are single points.")

    # --- The Proof ---
    print("\n--- The Proof (by Contradiction) ---")
    print("\nProposition: The set of dispersion points (D) can have a cardinality of at most 1.")
    print("\nStep 1: Assume for contradiction that there are at least two dispersion points.")
    print("Let d1 and d2 be two distinct dispersion points in X.")

    print("\nStep 2: Use the properties of dispersion points.")
    print("By definition, any non-degenerate connected subset of X must contain every dispersion point.")
    print("Therefore, any connected subset of X with more than one point must contain both d1 and d2.")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyze the space with one point removed.")
    print("Consider the space Y = X \\ {d2}. By definition, Y is totally disconnected.")
    print("Since X is a connected metric space with more than one point, it is uncountable. So Y is non-empty and contains more than one point.")
    print("d1 is a point in Y.")

    print("\nStep 4: Partition the totally disconnected space Y.")
    print("Since Y is a totally disconnected space with more than one point, it can be partitioned into two non-empty, disjoint sets, K and W, which are both open and closed in Y.")
    print("Let's make this partition such that d1 is in K, and some other point p is in W.")

    print("\nStep 5: Relate the partition back to the original space X.")
    print("For X to remain connected, the point d2 must be a 'bridge' between K and W.")
    print("This means d2 must be a limit point of both K and W. In other words, the closure of K in X is K U {d2}, and the closure of W in X is W U {d2}.")

    print("\nStep 6: Find a contradiction.")
    print("Consider the set C = W U {d2}. This set is the closure of W in X, so it is a closed (and thus compact) subset of X.")
    print("It can be shown that C is a connected set. It contains more than one point (since W is non-empty), so it is a non-degenerate connected subset of X.")
    print("However, by construction, d1 is in K, and K and W are disjoint. So, d1 is not in C.")
    print("This gives us a contradiction: we found a non-degenerate connected set C that does not contain the dispersion point d1. This contradicts our conclusion from Step 2.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The initial assumption that there are two or more dispersion points must be false.")
    print("Therefore, the number of dispersion points can be 0 or 1.")
    print("\nDoes a space with one dispersion point exist?")
    print("Yes. The 'Knaster-Kuratowski fan' is a well-known example of a compact connected metric space with exactly one dispersion point.")

    equation = "Maximum cardinality = 1"
    print(f"The maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points is 1.")
