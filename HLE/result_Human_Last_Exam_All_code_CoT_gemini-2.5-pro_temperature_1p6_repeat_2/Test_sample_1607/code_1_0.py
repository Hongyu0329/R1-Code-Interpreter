def solve_quantum_symmetry_quiz():
    """
    This function identifies the correct statements about quantum symmetries and prints the result.

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    A: False. Counterexample: momentum operator p̂.
    B1: True. The addendum forces the conclusion to be true, making the implication true.
    B2: False. The scaling factor is incorrect.
    C: False. It is a necessary AND sufficient condition.
    D: True. Follows from [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0.
    E: True. This is the definition of the z-component of angular momentum as a generator.
    F: True. This is a statement of Noether's theorem in quantum mechanics.
    G: True. The premise is always true, and the conclusion follows from S being unitary.
    H: False. Counterexample: angular momentum operator L_z.
    I: True. Consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for non-commuting operators.
    J: True. This is the definition of how a symmetry operator acts on energy eigenstates.
