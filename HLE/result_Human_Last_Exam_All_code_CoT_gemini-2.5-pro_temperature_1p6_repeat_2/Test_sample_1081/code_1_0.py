# This script calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E_8.

# --- Theoretical Background ---
# The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G over a finite field F_q
# (up to conjugacy by the group of F_q-rational points G(F_q)) is given by the number of
# F-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group W.
#
# For a group of type E_8, any such group over F_q is the 'split' form. For a split group,
# the Frobenius map F acts trivially on the Weyl group.
# Consequently, F-conjugacy classes are the same as ordinary conjugacy classes.
#
# The problem is thus reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group W(E_8).

# --- Calculation ---
# The number of conjugacy classes of W(E_8) is a known result from the mathematical literature
# on reflection groups. It is not calculated from a simple first-principles formula but is
# determined using the character theory of the group.
# The established value is 112.

number_of_tori = 112

# --- Final Answer ---
# The final "equation" is the statement of the equality between the number of tori
# and the number of conjugacy classes, and its resulting value.
