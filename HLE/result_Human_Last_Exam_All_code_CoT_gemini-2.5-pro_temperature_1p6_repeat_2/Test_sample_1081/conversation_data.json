    "Of course, I can help with this question from the theory of algebraic groups. Here is my thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Request:** The user wants to find the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori for a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The answer should be provided in a Python script.\n\n2.  **Relate Tori to the Weyl Group:** The key theoretical result connecting tori to a combinatorial object is that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori (up to conjugacy by the rational points $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$) is given by the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$ of $G$. The map $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specific Group G:**\n    *   **Group Type:** The group is of type $E_8$. The corresponding Weyl group is $W(E_8)$.\n    *   **Base Field:** The group is defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A fundamental result (Lang's theorem) implies that for any connected algebraic group $H$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Galois cohomology set $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, H)$ is trivial.\n    *   **Forms of E8:** Algebraic groups of a given type over a field are classified by the Galois cohomology of the automorphism group of the split form. The automorphism group of a split group $G_{split}$ is a semi-direct product of the adjoint group $G_{ad}$ and the automorphism group of the Dynkin diagram. The Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial symmetries. This means all forms of $E_8$ are *inner forms*, and their classification is governed by $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G_{ad})$. As this cohomology group is trivial, it implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is isomorphic to the *split* group.\n    *   **Action of Frobenius:** For a split group, the Frobenius map $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Problem:** With a trivial action of $F$ on $W$, an $F$-conjugacy class (which is of the form $\\{g x F(g)^{-1} | g \\in W\\}$) simplifies to an ordinary conjugacy class (since $F(g)=g$, $\\{g x g^{-1} | g \\in W\\}$).\n    Therefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n5.  **Find the Number of Conjugacy Classes:** The number of conjugacy classes for Weyl groups of exceptional Lie types is a well-established result in mathematics. These numbers are generally computed using advanced techniques from character theory, often with the aid of computational algebra systems (like GAP or Magma). For $W(E_8)$, this number is 112. This can be found in reference texts and papers, such as R.W. Carter's work on Weyl groups.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Code:** Since the result is a known constant, the Python script will not derive it from scratch. Instead, it will:\n    *   Explain the theoretical basis for the answer.\n    *   Define a variable for the result.\n    *   Print the \"equation\" that relates the number of tori to the number of conjugacy classes.\n    *   Print the final numerical answer, fulfilling the prompt's requirements.\n\nThis plan leads directly to the Python code below.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E_8.\n\n# --- Theoretical Background ---\n# The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G over a finite field F_q\n# (up to conjugacy by the group of F_q-rational points G(F_q)) is given by the number of\n# F-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group W.\n#\n# For a group of type E_8, any such group over F_q is the 'split' form. For a split group,\n# the Frobenius map F acts trivially on the Weyl group.\n# Consequently, F-conjugacy classes are the same as ordinary conjugacy classes.\n#\n# The problem is thus reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group W(E_8).\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# The number of conjugacy classes of W(E_8) is a known result from the mathematical literature\n# on reflection groups. It is not calculated from a simple first-principles formula but is\n# determined using the character theory of the group.\n# The established value is 112.\n\nnumber_of_tori = 112\n\n# --- Final Answer ---\n# The final \"equation\" is the statement of the equality between the number of tori\n# and the number of conjugacy classes, and its resulting value.\n\nprint(\"The relationship is: Number of F_q-rational maximal tori = Number of conjugacy classes in W(E_8)\")\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"Number of F_q-rational maximal tori of G(E_8) = {number_of_tori}\")\n```\n<<<112>>>"
