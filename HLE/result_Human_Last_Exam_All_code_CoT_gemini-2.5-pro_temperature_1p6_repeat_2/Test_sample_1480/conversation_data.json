    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to combine the firing level of the rule's antecedent part with the membership degree of the consequent part. This combination is done using a t-norm operation.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the given values: the antecedent firing level `Phi_k(x′)` is 0.7, and the consequent membership degree `μG_k_j(y_j)` is 0.9.\n2.  Select a t-norm. A commonly used t-norm is the minimum operator, which takes the minimum of the two values.\n3.  Apply the minimum t-norm to the given values to find the rule activation level.\n4.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_activation_level():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rule activation level for an interval type-3 fuzzy set\n    using a minimum t-norm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values\n    phi_k = 0.7\n    mu_G_k_j = 0.9\n\n    # The rule activation level is found by applying a t-norm to the antecedent\n    # firing level and the consequent membership degree.\n    # We will use the minimum t-norm: activation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n    activation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n\n    print(\"The rule activation level is calculated using a t-norm (e.g., minimum) on the antecedent firing level and the consequent membership degree.\")\n    print(f\"Antecedent Firing Level (Phi_k(x′)): {phi_k}\")\n    print(f\"Consequent Membership Degree (μG_k_j(y_j)): {mu_G_k_j}\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the rule activation level using the minimum t-norm:\")\n    print(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G_k_j})\")\n    print(f\"Final Rule Activation Level = {activation_level}\")\n\ncalculate_activation_level()\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
