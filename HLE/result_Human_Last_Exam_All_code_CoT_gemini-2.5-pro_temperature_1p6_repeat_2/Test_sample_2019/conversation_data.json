    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to place 4 queens on a 5x5 chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other, considering the board's toroidal (wrap-around) nature.\n\n### My Plan\n1.  **Define the Board and Attack Rules**: A 5x5 toroidal board means the edges wrap around. A queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks another at `(r2, c2)` if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board with size `N=5`, this translates to:\n    *   **Row Attack**: `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Column Attack**: `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Diagonal Attack**: `(r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N` or `(r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N`.\n\n2.  **Choose an Algorithm**: This is a constraint satisfaction problem, which is well-suited for a **backtracking algorithm**. This method will systematically explore all possible placements and discard invalid ones early.\n\n3.  **Implement the Backtracking Algorithm**:\n    *   We'll write a recursive function that tries to place queens one by one.\n    *   To avoid duplicate counting (e.g., placing queens at `A` then `B` vs. `B` then `A`), we will process the board's 25 squares in a fixed order (from square 0 to 24). When placing a queen, we only consider squares that come after the previously placed one.\n    *   For each potential square, we check if placing a queen there would conflict with any queens already on the board using the toroidal attack rules.\n    *   If the placement is safe, we add the queen and make a recursive call to place the next one.\n    *   After the recursion returns, we remove the queen (this is the \"backtracking\" step) to explore other possibilities.\n    *   If we successfully place all 4 queens, we increment a counter for valid solutions.\n\n4.  **Execute and Output**: The final Python code will implement this logic, calculate the total count, and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_4_queens_toroidal():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 5\n    num_queens = 4\n    \n    # Using a list to store the positions (r, c) of placed queens.\n    placements = []\n    \n    # We use a list to hold the final count, as nonlocal is not available in Python 2.\n    # This makes the code more portable and is a common pattern for modifying outer-scope integers.\n    solution_count = [0]\n\n    def is_safe(new_pos, existing_placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a new queen at new_pos attacks any existing queens.\n        \"\"\"\n        r2, c2 = new_pos\n        for r1, c1 in existing_placements:\n            # Check row and column conflict\n            if r1 == r2 or c1 == c2:\n                return False\n            # Check toroidal diagonal conflict\n            if (r1 - c1) % board_size == (r2 - c2) % board_size:\n                return False\n            if (r1 + c1) % board_size == (r2 + c2) % board_size:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def backtrack(k, start_square_index):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively places k queens on the board.\n        \n        k: Number of queens left to place.\n        start_square_index: The board square index (0-24) to start searching from.\n                            This prevents duplicate combinations.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If all queens have been placed, we found a solution.\n        if k == 0:\n            solution_count[0] += 1\n            return\n\n        # Optimization: If the number of remaining squares is less than the number of\n        # queens we still need to place, we can prune this search branch.\n        squares_available = board_size * board_size - start_square_index\n        if squares_available < k:\n            return\n\n        # Iterate through all possible squares for the current queen.\n        for i in range(start_square_index, board_size * board_size):\n            r, c = i // board_size, i % board_size\n            \n            # Check if this position is safe with respect to the queens already placed.\n            if is_safe((r, c), placements):\n                # Place the queen\n                placements.append((r, c))\n                # Recursively try to place the next queen, starting from the next square\n                backtrack(k - 1, i + 1)\n                # Backtrack: remove the queen to explore other possibilities\n                placements.pop()\n\n    # Start the backtracking process to place num_queens, starting from square 0.\n    backtrack(num_queens, 0)\n    \n    # The final count is the first element of our list\n    final_count = solution_count[0]\n    \n    # Since the problem doesn't have a simple formula, the result is the computed count.\n    # The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" isn't directly\n    # applicable as we use a search algorithm.
