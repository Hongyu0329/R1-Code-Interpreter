    print("Step 1: Analyzing the definition of the tower.")
    print("The problem defines a tower <x_alpha : alpha < delta> of omega_2-sized subsets of omega_2.")
    print("The conditions are:")
    print("1. For alpha < beta < delta, |x_beta \\ x_alpha| < omega_2. This describes an increasing chain under the 'almost subset' relation.")
    print("2. There is no omega_2-sized y such that for all alpha, |y \\ x_alpha| < omega_2.")
    print("\nStep 2: Correcting the definition.")
    print("A direct interpretation of these conditions leads to a contradiction. If the chain is increasing, the second condition is trivially false (e.g., y = x_0 would satisfy the property).")
    print("The standard definition of a set-theoretic tower uses a *decreasing* chain.")
    print("The likely intended condition is |x_alpha \\ x_beta| < omega_2 for alpha < beta. This means x_beta is 'almost contained' in x_alpha.")
    print("With this correction, the structure described is a tower in the poset P(omega_2)/[omega_2]^{<omega_2}, and delta is its length.")
    
    print("\nStep 3: Identifying the relevant cardinal number.")
    print("The smallest possible length 'delta' for such a tower is, by definition, the tower number of omega_2, denoted t(omega_2).")
    
    print("\nStep 4: Stating known results from ZFC set theory.")
    print("For any regular cardinal kappa, it is a theorem in ZFC that the tower number t(kappa) must be greater than or equal to kappa^+ (the successor cardinal of kappa).")
    print("In our case, kappa = omega_2, which is a regular cardinal.")
    print("Therefore, t(omega_2) >= omega_2^+.")
    print(f"Since omega_2^+ is omega_3, we have t(omega_2) >= omega_3.")
    
    print("\nStep 5: Determining the smallest possible cardinal delta.")
    print("Any possible length delta for such a tower must be at least t(omega_2). So, delta must be at least omega_3.")
    print("It is known to be consistent with ZFC that t(omega_2) can be equal to omega_3.")
    print("Therefore, the smallest possible cardinal delta for such a tower is omega_3.")

    print("\nStep 6: Determining the second smallest possible cardinal delta.")
    print("The possible values for delta are cardinals. We are looking for the second smallest possible value that delta can take, across all models of ZFC.")
    print("The smallest possible value is omega_3.")
    print("The cardinals are well-ordered. The next cardinal after omega_3 is omega_4.")
    print("So, the second smallest possible value for delta can be no smaller than omega_4.")

    print("\nStep 7: Confirming the second smallest value.")
    print("For omega_4 to be a possible value for delta, it must be consistent with ZFC that a tower of length omega_4 exists.")
    print("This is true if it's consistent that t(omega_2) = omega_4. This is a known consistency result in set theory.")
    print("Thus, a tower of length omega_4 can exist.")

    print("The second smallest possible cardinal delta is omega_4.")
