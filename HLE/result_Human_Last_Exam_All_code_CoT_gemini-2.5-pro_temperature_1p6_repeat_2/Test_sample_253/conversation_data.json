    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Rule**: Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton rule. The state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors. The rule is defined by the following 8 neighborhood-to-outcome pairs:\n    *   `111` -> `0`\n    *   `110` -> `1`\n    *   `101` -> `1`\n    *   `100` -> `0`\n    *   `011` -> `1`\n    *   `010` -> `1`\n    *   `001` -> `1`\n    *   `000` -> `0`\n    (The name \"Rule 110\" comes from the binary representation of these outcomes: `01101110` is 110 in decimal).\n\n2.  **Set Up the Automaton**:\n    *   I will represent the row of cells as a Python list of 0s and 1s.\n    *   The simulation requires 20 steps (generations). The pattern can grow by one cell on each side per generation. To ensure the pattern isn't cut off, I'll use a list of width `2 * 20 + 1 = 41`.\n    *   The initial state (generation 0) will be this list of 41 zeros, with a single `1` placed in the exact center.\n\n3.  **Simulate the Generations**:\n    *   I will loop 20 times to compute each generation from 1 to 20.\n    *   In each loop, I will create a new, empty list for the next generation.\n    *   I'll iterate through each cell of the current generation's list. For each cell, I'll look at its 3-cell neighborhood (left, center, right).\n    *   Using a dictionary to store Rule 110, I will find the new state for the cell and place it in the list for the next generation.\n    *   Once all the cells for the next generation are calculated, I'll replace the current generation's list with the new one.\n\n4.  **Final Output**:\n    *   After 20 loops, the simulation is complete. I will print the final list of 0s and 1s as a single binary string, representing the pattern.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the Rule 110 cellular automaton for 20 generations\n    starting from a single cell in state 1 and prints the final pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
