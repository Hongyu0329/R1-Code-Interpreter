# Step 1: Define the functions implicitly by calculating their values at x=0 and x=1.
# The function of interest is F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))).

# Step 2: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1).
# At x=0: F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(2)
f3_0 = math.log(2)

# At x=1: F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))
f3_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))

# Step 3: Evaluate the definite integral V.
# The integral of F₃'(x) / F₃(x) is ln(F₃(x)).
# By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:
# V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))
# (We can drop the absolute value since F₃(x) is positive on the interval [0,1]).
V = math.log(f3_1) - math.log(f3_0)

# Step 4: Perform the final calculation.
# We need to find the closest integer to 10000 * V.
final_value = 10000 * V
rounded_result = round(final_value)

# Step 5: Output the numbers from the calculation as requested.
# The equation for the integral is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).
