    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral to be evaluated is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`. This is a standard form integral, `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`, whose antiderivative is `ln|f(x)|`. In our case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from `x=0` to `x=1`. This gives `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Calculate `F₃(0)`:**\n    *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n4.  **Calculate `F₃(1)`:**\n    *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n    *   `F₁(1) = sin(1)`\n    *   `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n5.  **Evaluate the Integral Value (V):** Since `F₃(x)` is positive for `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, we can remove the absolute value. The value `V` is `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n6.  **Final Calculation:** We will compute `10000 * V` and round it to the nearest integer.\n7.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations using the `math` library. The script will print the values of `F₃(1)`, `F₃(0)`, the integral `V`, and the final rounded answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the functions implicitly by calculating their values at x=0 and x=1.\n# The function of interest is F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))).\n\n# Step 2: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1).\n# At x=0: F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(2)\nf3_0 = math.log(2)\n\n# At x=1: F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\nf3_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\n\n# Step 3: Evaluate the definite integral V.\n# The integral of F₃'(x) / F₃(x) is ln(F₃(x)).\n# By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:\n# V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n# (We can drop the absolute value since F₃(x) is positive on the interval [0,1]).\nV = math.log(f3_1) - math.log(f3_0)\n\n# Step 4: Perform the final calculation.\n# We need to find the closest integer to 10000 * V.\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nrounded_result = round(final_value)\n\n# Step 5: Output the numbers from the calculation as requested.\n# The equation for the integral is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\nprint(f\"The value of F_3(1) is: {f3_1}\")\nprint(f\"The value of F_3(0) is: {f3_0}\")\nprint(f\"The value of the integral V is ln({f3_1}) - ln({f3_0}), which equals: {V}\")\nprint(f\"The final calculation is 10000 * V = {final_value}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {rounded_result}\")\n<<<5487>>>\n```"
