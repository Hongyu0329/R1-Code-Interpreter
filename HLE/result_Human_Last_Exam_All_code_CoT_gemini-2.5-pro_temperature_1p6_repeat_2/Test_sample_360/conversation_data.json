    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that explains the stereochemistry and calculates the number of isomers formed in the reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Product:** First, I'll determine the chemical formula and structure of the product formed when *cis*-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) reacts with 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole. The reaction involves the new bidentate ligand replacing the two chloride ligands to form a tris-chelate octahedral complex.\n2.  **Analyze Ligand Symmetry:** I'll analyze the symmetry of the ligands involved. Bipyridine (`bpy`) is a symmetric bidentate ligand (type `AA`), while 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (`L`) is an asymmetric bidentate ligand (type `AB`).\n3.  **Count Isomers:** The total number of stereoisomers for the resulting `[Ru(AA)₂(AB)]` complex depends on two factors:\n    *   **Propeller Chirality:** Any tris-chelate octahedral complex is chiral and exists as two non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers), designated Δ (Delta) and Λ (Lambda).\n    *   **Asymmetric Ligand Orientation:** For each of the Δ and Λ configurations, the asymmetric ligand `L` can be placed in two different orientations, which are not equivalent. These two orientations result in diastereomers.\n4.  **Calculate Total:** Finally, I'll multiply the number of possibilities from each source of isomerism to get the total number of isomers.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_isomer_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the number of isomers formed in the reaction between\n    cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) and 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the reaction and product...\")\n    print(\"Reactants:\")\n    print(\"  1.
