    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for determining the Galois group of a quartic polynomial.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** We'll first verify if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. A common method is Eisenstein's criterion.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant of the polynomial gives us the first major clue about the structure of the Galois group. Specifically, the group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number.\n3.  **Construct and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** The factorization of a related polynomial, the resolvent cubic, provides the next level of discrimination. If the resolvent cubic is irreducible, the group is $S_4$. If it is reducible, the group is smaller.\n4.  **Distinguish Between Smaller Groups:** If the resolvent cubic is reducible, it narrows the possibilities to $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8) or $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), since the discriminant is not a perfect square. A final test involving reducibility over a quadratic field extension will distinguish between these two.\n5.  **State the Order:** Once the group is identified, its order is known.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations and determine the order of the Galois group.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_galois_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # This is in the depressed quartic form x^4 + qx + r.\n    q = 8\n    r = 14\n\n    print(f\"The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + {q}x + {r}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility over Q using Eisenstein's Criterion.\n    # The prime p=2 divides the non-leading coefficients q=8 and r=14.\n    # The prime p=2 does not divide the leading coefficient (which is 1).\n    # p^2=4 does not divide the constant term r=14.\n    # Thus, the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers Q.\n    print(\"Step 1: Checking for irreducibility\")\n    print(\"The polynomial is irreducible over Q by Eisenstein's criterion with p=2.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Compute the discriminant of the quartic.\n    # For a depressed quartic x^4 + qx + r, the discriminant is Delta = -27*q^4 + 256*r^3.\n    print(\"Step 2: Computing the discriminant (Delta)\")\n    delta = -27 * (q**4) + 256 * (r**3)\n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * ({q}^4) + 256 * ({r}^3)\")\n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * {q**4} + 256 * {r**3}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {-27 * (q**4)} + {256 * (r**3)}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {delta}\")\n    \n    # Check if Delta is a perfect square.\n    sqrt_delta_int = math.isqrt(delta)\n    if sqrt_delta_int * sqrt_delta_int == delta:\n        print(\"Delta is a perfect square.
