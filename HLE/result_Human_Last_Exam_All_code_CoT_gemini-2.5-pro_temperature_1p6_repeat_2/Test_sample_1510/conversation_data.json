    "To find the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Represent the Data**: First, I'll create a comprehensive list of all 17 wallpaper groups. For each group, I'll include its name, its corresponding crystallographic point group, and the order of that point group (the number of symmetry operations it contains).\n2.  **Filter the Data**: I'll then iterate through this list. In each iteration, I will check if the 'point group order' is exactly 2.\n3.  **Count and List**: I'll collect the names of all groups that meet this criterion and count them.\n4.  **Display the Result**: Finally, I'll print the names of the identified groups, the total count, and an addition equation that visually represents the count, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wallpaper_group_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts the wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of dictionaries representing the 17 wallpaper groups.\n    # Each dictionary contains the group's name, its point group, and the order of the point group.\n    wallpaper_groups_data = [\n        {'name': 'p1',   'point_group': 'C1', 'order': 1},\n        {'name': 'p2',   'point_group': 'C2', 'order': 2},\n        {'name': 'pm',   'point_group': 'D1', 'order': 2},\n        {'name': 'pg',   'point_group': 'D1', 'order': 2},\n        {'name': 'cm',   'point_group': 'D1', 'order': 2},\n        {'name': 'p2mm', 'point_group': 'D2', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'p2mg', 'point_group': 'D2', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'p2gg', 'point_group': 'D2', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'c2mm', 'point_group': 'D2', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'p4',   'point_group': 'C4', 'order': 4},\n        {'name': 'p4mm', 'point_group': 'D4', 'order': 8},\n        {'name': 'p4gm', 'point_group': 'D4', 'order': 8},\n        {'name': 'p3',   'point_group': 'C3', 'order': 3},\n        {'name': 'p3m1', 'point_group': 'D3', 'order': 6},\n        {'name': 'p31m', 'point_group': 'D3', 'order': 6},\n        {'name': 'p6',   'point_group': 'C6', 'order': 6},\n        {'name': 'p6mm', 'point_group': 'D6', 'order': 12}\n    ]\n\n    # Find groups where the point group order is 2.\n    found_groups = [group for group in wallpaper_groups_data if group['order'] == 2]\n\n    # Get the names and the total count.\n    group_names = [group['name'] for group in found_groups]\n    count = len(found_groups)\n\n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are: {', '.join(group_names)}.\")\n    print(f\"There are {count} such groups.\")\n    \n    # As requested, print an equation representing the count.\n    if count > 0:\n        sum_expression = \" + \".join([\"1\"] * count)\n        print(f\"This can be represented as the equation: {sum_expression} = {count}\")\n\nsolve_wallpaper_group_question()\n<<<4>>>"
