# Define the percentages from the correct statement
fbs_percentage = 10
antibiotic_percentage = 1

# The correct statement describes the process of isolating and culturing corneal fibroblasts.
# It correctly identifies the tissue layers to be removed (epithelium and endothelium),
# the cell type of interest (stromal cells), the resulting phenotype (myofibroblasts),
# the appropriate culture medium composition, and the adherent nature of the cells.
# The following code prints this correct statement.

print(f"Debrided epithelium and endothelium induced proliferation of the stromal cells to myofibroblasts in the medium containing {fbs_percentage}% of the FBS and {antibiotic_percentage}% antibiotic, and they adhered to the bottom of the flask.")
