    Analyzes the provided multiple-choice question and prints the correct answer.
    The question is: By which mechanism can magnesium supplementation help lower blood pressure?

    Choices:
    A. Through direct vasodilation
    B. By protecting elastic fibers from calcium deposition
    C. By increasing white matter and gray matter in the brain
    D. By stimulating an inflammatory response
    E. It raises systemic blood calcium levels

    # Explanation of the mechanism:
    # Magnesium acts as a physiological calcium channel blocker.
    # 1. Calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells causes them to contract, leading to vasoconstriction.
    # 2. Magnesium competes with calcium and blocks its entry into these cells.
    # 3. This leads to relaxation of the smooth muscle, causing vasodilation (widening of the blood vessels).
    # 4. Vasodilation reduces peripheral resistance, which in turn lowers blood pressure.
    
    # Evaluating the options based on this knowledge:
    # A is correct as it describes vasodilation.
    # B is a long-term effect, not the primary mechanism for acute BP lowering.
    # C is incorrect; this is not the mechanism for blood pressure control.
    # D is incorrect; magnesium is anti-inflammatory.
    # E is incorrect; magnesium antagonizes calcium, it does not raise its levels.

    explanation = (
        "Magnesium helps lower blood pressure primarily by acting as a natural calcium channel blocker. "
        "This action causes the smooth muscles in blood vessel walls to relax, leading to vasodilation (widening of the blood vessels). "
        "This vasodilation reduces systemic vascular resistance, thereby lowering blood pressure. "
        "Therefore, the correct mechanism is direct vasodilation."
