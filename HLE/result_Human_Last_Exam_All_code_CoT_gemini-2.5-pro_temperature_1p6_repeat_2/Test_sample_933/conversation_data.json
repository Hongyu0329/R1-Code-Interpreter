    "To determine the coldest temperature for efficient Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) production, we need to examine its synthesis methods.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Identify the primary synthesis reaction for Xenon tetrafluoride. The reaction is the direct combination of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gases: Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s).\n2.  Research the standard conditions (temperature, pressure, reactant ratio) for this reaction to maximize the yield of XeF₄. Chemical literature states that heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine (in a 1:5 molar ratio) to approximately 400 °C is the most common and efficient method.\n3.  Temperatures significantly lower than 400 °C are not efficient for this thermal synthesis or tend to favor the production of Xenon difluoride (XeF₂). Higher temperatures can lead to the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆).\n4.  Based on this information, I will write a Python script that analyzes the given options and selects 400 °C as the correct answer. The script will print the chemical reaction and the optimal temperature.\n\n```python\ndef find_synthesis_temperature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) to find the\n    optimal and coldest temperature for its efficient production from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride is achieved by heating Xenon and Fluorine gas.\n    # The balanced chemical equation is: Xe + 2F₂ -> XeF₄\n    # According to chemical literature, this reaction is typically carried out by heating\n    # the reactants to 400 °C at several atmospheres of pressure.\n    # This temperature provides a good rate and yield for XeF₄.\n\n    optimal_temp = 400  # in Celsius\n\n    # Provided answer choices\n    choices = {\n        \"A\": 600,\n        \"B\": 400,\n        \"C\": 200,\n        \"D\": 78,\n        \"E\": 0,\n        \"F\": -78\n    }\n\n    print(\"Synthesis of Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF₄):\")\n    \n    # Printing the components of the reaction as requested\n    reactant1 = \"Xe\"\n    reactant2_coefficient = 2\n    reactant2 = \"F₂\"\n    product = \"XeF₄\"\n    \n    print(f\"Reaction: {reactant1} + {reactant2_coefficient}{reactant2} -> {product}\")\n\n    # Find the correct choice\n    correct_choice_letter = None\n    for letter, temp in choices.items():\n        if temp == optimal_temp:\n            correct_choice_letter = letter\n            break\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe standard and coldest temperature for *efficient* synthesis of XeF₄ from the given options is {optimal_temp} °C.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to option {correct_choice_letter}.\")\n\n\nfind_synthesis_temperature()\n<<<B>>>"
