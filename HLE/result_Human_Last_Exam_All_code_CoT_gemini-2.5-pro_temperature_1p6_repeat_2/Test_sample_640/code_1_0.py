    Analyzes the statements about coupled-channel quantum scattering.

    The key principle is the equivalence of coupling properties:
    A system's potential V(r) is "trivially coupled" (can be diagonalized by a
    single constant matrix U for all r) if and only if its Jost matrix F(E) is
    trivially coupled (diagonalizable by the same U for all E), which is true
    if and only if its S-matrix S(E) is trivially coupled (diagonalizable by
    the same U for all E).

    Let TC = Trivially Coupled, NTC = Non-Trivially Coupled.
    The equivalence is: V is TC <=> F is TC <=> S is TC.
    The contrapositive is: V is NTC <=> F is NTC <=> S is NTC.

    We now evaluate each statement based on this logical foundation.

    # Counterexample: If V is TC but not diagonal (e.g., U is a rotation),

    # eigenvalues are all identical (S_diag = s(E) * Identity). In this case,
