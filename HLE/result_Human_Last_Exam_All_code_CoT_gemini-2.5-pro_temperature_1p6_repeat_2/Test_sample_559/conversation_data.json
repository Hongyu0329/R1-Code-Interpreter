    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand Separatrices**: A separatrix in a dynamical system is a trajectory that acts as a boundary, separating regions of the phase space with different long-term behaviors. In 2D systems, the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle-type equilibrium points are primary examples of separatrices.\n2.  **Find Equilibrium Points**: I will find the equilibrium points (also called critical points) of the system by solving for `d'(t) = 0` and `u'(t) = 0` simultaneously.\n3.  **Classify Equilibrium Points**: I'll compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluate it at each equilibrium point. By analyzing the eigenvalues of the Jacobian at each point, I can classify them as nodes, saddles, spirals, etc. The goal is to find a saddle point.\n4.  **Identify Manifolds of the Saddle Point**: Once a saddle point is identified, its stable and unstable manifolds are the separatrices we are looking for.\n    *   The **stable manifold** consists of all trajectories that approach the saddle point as time `t` goes to `+∞`.\n    *   The **unstable manifold** consists of all trajectories that approach the saddle point as time `t` goes to `-∞`.\n5.  **Determine the Equations**: I will find the analytical equations for these manifolds.\n    *   One manifold might be a simple line or curve that is an invariant set of the system (i.e., a line/curve that trajectories cannot cross). I will check for invariant lines like `u = constant`.\n    *   The other manifold can be found by solving the phase plane ordinary differential equation `dd/du = d'(t) / u'(t)`. As this equation might be hard to solve, I will look for a simple polynomial solution `d(u)` that passes through the saddle point and has the correct slope (determined by the corresponding eigenvector).\n6.  **Formulate the Python Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that presents these findings. The script will state the equations of the separatrices and, as requested, print out the specific numbers that form these equations.\n\n```python\ndef find_separatrix_equations():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds and prints the equations for the separatrices of the given system.\n\n    The system of differential equations is:\n    d'(t) = 2*d(t)^2 + (-3*u(t) + 5*u(t)^2)*d(t) - u(t)^3*(1-u(t))\n    u'(t) = u(t)^2*(u(t)-1)\n\n    The method involves finding the equilibrium points and identifying the saddle point.\n    The separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of this saddle point.\n    Through mathematical analysis, the saddle point is located at (u, d) = (1, -1).\n    The equations for its stable and unstable manifolds are then determined.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The system has a saddle point at (u, d) = (1, -1).\")\n    print(\"The separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of this point.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # The first separatrix is the stable manifold of the saddle point.\n    # Mathematical analysis shows this is a vertical line.\n    print(\"One separatrix is the line given by the equation:\")\n    u_coeff_1 = 1\n    const_1 = 1\n    print(f\"The equation is: {u_coeff_1} * u = {const_1}\")\n    print(\"\\nBreaking down the numbers in this equation:\")\n    print(f\"The coefficient of the variable u is {u_coeff_1}.\")\n    print(f\"The constant value on the right-hand side is {const_1}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n\" + \"-\" * 30 + \"\\n\")\n    \n    # The second separatrix is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n    # Mathematical analysis shows this is a parabolic curve.\n    print(\"The other separatrix is the curve given by the equation:\")\n    d_coeff_2 = 1\n    sign_2 = \"-\"\n    u_coeff_2 = 1\n    u_power_2 = 2\n    print(f\"The equation is: {d_coeff_2} * d = {sign_2}{u_coeff_2} * u^{u_power_2}\")\n    print(\"\\nBreaking down the numbers in this equation:\")\n    print(f\"The coefficient of the variable d is {d_coeff_2}.\")\n    print(f\"The sign of the term on the right is negative, corresponding to a multiplicative factor of -{u_coeff_2}.\")\n    print(f\"The coefficient of the u-term is {u_coeff_2}.\")\n    print(f\"The power of u is {u_power_2}.\")\n\n# Run the function to display the results.\nfind_separatrix_equations()\n```\n<<<The separatrices are u = 1 and d = -u**2>>>"
