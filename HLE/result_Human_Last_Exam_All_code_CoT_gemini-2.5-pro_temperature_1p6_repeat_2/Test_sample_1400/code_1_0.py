    print("      - Since each edge is processed a constant number of times throughout the algorithm, this part contributes O(m) to the total complexity.\n")

    print("      - The algorithm needs to find the minimum-weight incoming edge for various nodes/supernodes.")
    print("      - This is handled by 'extract-min' operations on the priority queue (Fibonacci heap).")
