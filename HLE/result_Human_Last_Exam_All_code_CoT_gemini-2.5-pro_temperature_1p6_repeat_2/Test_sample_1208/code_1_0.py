# --- Analysis of the options ---
# Statement I: Maintain current regimen and taper.
# Rationale: This approach is already failing for the patient, so it's not the best path forward.
#
# Statement II: Transition to methadone.
# Rationale: A valid option, but part of a broader set of choices a specialty team would consider.
#
# Statement III: Initiate a rapid opioid taper.
# Rationale: This is clinically dangerous and can lead to severe withdrawal and relapse. This is the worst option.
#
# Statement IV: Arrange a multidisciplinary consultation.
# Rationale: This is the gold standard for complex cases involving pain, opioid dependence, and psychological factors.
# This is a crucial step.
#
# Statement V: Prescribe buprenorphine-naloxone.
# Rationale: This is a modern, safe, and highly effective treatment for opioid use disorder that also addresses the patient's specific question.
#
# --- Synthesis ---
# The best course of action combines the best-practice framework with a specific, effective intervention.
# A multidisciplinary team (IV) is the ideal context to manage the patient's complex needs and initiate
# a treatment like buprenorphine-naloxone (V), which is an excellent choice for this scenario.
# Therefore, the combination of statements IV and V is the strongest answer.

# Find the corresponding letter for the answer "IV, V".
