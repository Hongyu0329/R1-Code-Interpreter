A proof by contradiction shows that if we assume there exist F, G in F^(1) with |F intersect G| = t+1, we can use the shifted property to construct two sets in F whose intersection is only t, which violates the (t+1)-intersection property of F. The contradiction arises because 1 is not in any set in F^(1), allowing a 'down-shift' to 1.")

The cross-intersecting property states that for ANY set from F and ANY set from G, their intersection is non-empty. Since this holds for the entire families, it must also hold for any pair of sets taken from their respective subfamilies F^(n) and G^(n).")
