# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes of a space X
# with a certain property of its configuration space.
# Based on the reasoning provided, the answer is a single integer.

# The only homeomorphism class satisfying the conditions is that of the simple arc, e.g., [0, 1].
# Therefore, the number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.
number_of_classes = 1
