    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to determine the Chern number of the junction:\n\n1.  **Define Chern Numbers**: We'll start by defining the Chern numbers for the two individual insulators, which are both given as 1.\n2.  **Apply Bulk-Boundary Correspondence**: The key physical principle here is the bulk-boundary correspondence. This principle states that at the interface between two regions with different Chern numbers, there will be a number of protected, one-way (chiral) edge states equal to the difference in their Chern numbers (`ΔC = C_region1 - C_region2`).\n3.  **Analyze the Internal Junction**: We will calculate the change in the Chern number (`ΔC`) specifically at the boundary between the two C=1 insulators. This will tell us if any new, protected modes are created at this internal junction.\n4.  **Determine the Overall Chern Number**: The Chern number is an intrinsic property of the bulk of a material. Since the two insulators are of the same topological phase (both have C=1), joining them together effectively creates a larger system within that same phase. We will conclude the Chern number of the combined system based on this fact.\n\nHere is the Python code that walks through these steps and provides the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chern_junction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Chern number of a junction between two Chern insulators.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the Chern numbers of the two individual insulators.\n    C1 = 1\n    C2 = 1\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Chern Insulator Junction ---\")\n    print(f\"The first Chern insulator has a Chern number, C1 = {C1}.\")\n    print(f\"The second Chern insulator has a Chern number, C2 = {C2}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the physical principle at the junction.\n    print(\"Principle: The number of protected chiral edge states at the interface\")\n    print(\"between two materials is determined by the difference in their Chern numbers (ΔC).\")\n    print(\"ΔC = C_region1 - C_region2\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the interface between the two insulators.\n    delta_C_junction = C1 - C2\n    print(\"Analyzing the internal junction between the two insulators:\")\n    print(f\"ΔC_junction = C1 - C2 = {C1} - {C2} = {delta_C_junction}\")\n    print(\"\\nBecause ΔC at the internal junction is 0, no new net edge states are formed at the interface.\")\n    print(\"The system behaves as a single, uniform material from a topological standpoint.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Step 4: Determine the Chern number of the combined system.\n    # The Chern number is a property of the bulk phase.
