    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensionality of the bosonic part of the target space for the supersymmetric sigma-model in symmetry class D with two replicas.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Manifold:** For symmetry class D and `n` replicas, the bosonic sector of the sigma-model is parametrized by the real-valued coordinates of the symmetric space `O(2n) / (O(n) x O(n))`. In this case, the number of replicas is `n=2`, so the manifold is `O(4) / (O(2) x O(2))`.\n2.  **Dimensionality Calculation:** The number of variables needed to parametrize this space is equal to its dimension. The dimension of a symmetric space `G/H` is calculated as `dim(G) - dim(H)`.\n3.  **Dimension of Orthogonal Groups:** The dimension of the orthogonal group `O(k)` is given by the formula `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n4.  **Compute:** We will calculate the dimensions of `O(4)` and `O(2) x O(2)` and then find their difference.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be created to perform these calculations and print out the steps and the final equation.\n\nThe script below will carry out these steps to find the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bosonic_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassmannian variables for the SUSY sigma-model\n    of class D with a given number of replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas for this problem\n    n_replicas = 2\n    \n    # The symmetry class is D.
