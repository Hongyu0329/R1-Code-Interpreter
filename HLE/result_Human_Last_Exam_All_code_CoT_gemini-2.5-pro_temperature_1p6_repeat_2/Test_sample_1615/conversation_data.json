    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Let $n$ be the number of vertices in the graph $G$. From the problem statement, we have $n=12345$.\n2.  The question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, given that $G$ is not the complete graph ($K_n$).\n3.  Recall a fundamental theorem in graph theory: for any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is less than or equal to $n$.\n4.  The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so all $n$ vertices need a unique color.\n5.  The problem explicitly states that $G$ is *not* the complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. This means $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n6.  Now, we need to determine if this upper bound of $n-1$ can be achieved. To do this, we need to see if there exists a graph with $n$ vertices that is not a complete graph but requires $n-1$ colors.\n7.  Consider a graph constructed by taking a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and adding one more vertex that is not connected to any of the other vertices (an isolated vertex).\n    *   This graph has a total of $(n-1) + 1 = n$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex.\n    *   The $K_{n-1}$ subgraph requires $n-1$ distinct colors. The isolated vertex can be given any of these colors since it has no adjacent vertices. Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed for this entire graph is $n-1$.\n8.  Since we have found an example of a graph with $n$ vertices which is not a complete graph and has a chromatic number of $n-1$, and we know that the chromatic number cannot exceed $n-1$, we can conclude that the maximum number of colors required is exactly $n-1$.\n9.  Finally, we calculate this value with $n = 12345$.\n\n```python\ndef solve_graph_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly\n    color a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph G.\n    num_vertices = 12345\n\n    # A graph with n vertices requires n colors if and only if it is the complete graph K_n.\n    # Since the graph G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than n.\n    # Therefore, the maximum possible chromatic number is n - 1.\n    # This maximum is achievable by a graph that consists of a complete subgraph K_{n-1}\n    # and one additional isolated vertex. Such a graph has n vertices, is not a complete graph,\n    # and its chromatic number is exactly n - 1.\n\n    max_colors = num_vertices - 1\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {num_vertices}.\")\n    print(\"For a graph with n vertices that is not the complete graph, the maximum number of colors needed is n - 1.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_graph_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
