The answer to your question is NO. Such an uncountable set X and a bounding function g do not necessarily exist based on the premises and ZFC axioms alone.

Here is a step-by-step explanation:

1.  **Understanding the Question**: The crucial part of the question is the word "necessarily". This asks if the existence of such a set X and function g is a provable theorem within ZFC, the standard axiomatic system for mathematics. If the statement could be true in some contexts (models of ZFC) and false in others, then it is not a necessary consequence.

2.  **Independence from ZFC**: The statement in question is known to be *independent* of the ZFC axioms.
    *   On one hand, it is consistent with ZFC to say that the answer is YES. If one assumes an additional axiom, like the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA), then one can prove that such a set X and function g must exist.
    *   On the other hand, it is also consistent with ZFC to say that the answer is NO. If one assumes a different additional axiom, like the Continuum Hypothesis (CH), one can construct a counterexample: a sequence of functions that satisfies the conditions but for which no such uncountable bounded set X exists.

3.  **Conclusion**: Since the statement's truth value depends on axioms beyond ZFC, it is not a theorem of ZFC. Therefore, we cannot say that such a set X and function g *necessarily* exist.

4.  **A Flawed Proof Attempt**: To appreciate why the answer isn't a simple "yes", consider this common line of reasoning and its flaw:
    *   For any fixed coordinate `gamma`, the sequence of values `<f_alpha(gamma) : alpha < omega_2>` is a sequence of length `omega_2` of ordinals smaller than `omega_1`. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be a single value `delta_gamma` that is taken `omega_2` many times. Let's call the set of indices where this happens `A_gamma`.
    *   One might hope to build the set `X` by intersecting all the `A_gamma` sets.
    *   **The Flaw**: The intersection of `omega_1` many sets of size `omega_2` is not guaranteed in ZFC to be non-empty. This crucial step in the proof fails, which is why the answer is not a straightforward "yes". In fact, a detailed analysis shows that this intersection can contain at most one point, which would not form an uncountable set X.

To satisfy the request for a final equation with numbers, we can represent this logical conclusion symbolically:
