    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this task, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The user wants to determine the oligomeric state (i.e., whether it's a dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of five given protein sequences, which are characteristic of coiled coils.\n\n2.  **Recognize the Method:** Predicting the oligomeric state of a coiled coil from its amino acid sequence is a complex bioinformatics problem. It depends heavily on the specific amino acids at the core \"a\" and \"d\" positions of the heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). These predictions are typically made using specialized, trained algorithms like LOGICOIL or SCORER 2.0, which are based on statistical data from known protein structures.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Sequences:** I will determine the amino acids at the core `a` and `d` positions for each sequence. Assuming a standard `gabcdefg` register, the `a` residues are at positions 2, 9, 16, 23, etc., and the `d` residues are at positions 5, 12, 19, 26, etc.\n    *   **Sequence 1 (`...QAL...KAL...WAL...QAL...`):** Core is (`I`,`A`), (`I`,`A`), (`I`,`W`), (`I`,`A`). The combination of Isoleucine at 'a' and primarily Alanine at 'd' points towards a **dimer (2)**.\n    *   **Sequence 2 (`...ALK...ALK...ALK...ALK...`):** Core is (`I`,`L`), (`I`,`L`), (`N`,`L`), (`I`,`L`). The `I` at 'a' and `L` at 'd' is a classic motif for a **dimer (2)**.\n    *   **Sequence 3 (`...AIK...AIK...AIK...AIK...`):** Core is (`I`,`I`), (`I`,`I`), (`I`,`W`), (`I`,`I`). An Isoleucine-rich core often favors trimers, but the steric hindrance of the beta-branched `I` at both 'a' and 'd' positions can promote a **tetramer (4)** for more favorable packing.\n    *   **Sequence 4 (`...KQL...KQL...WQL...KQL...`):** Core is (`I`,`Q`), (`I`,`Q`), (`I`,`W`), (`I`,`Q`). The polar Glutamine (`Q`) residues at the 'd' position can form stabilizing hydrogen bonds across the interface, a feature known as a \"polar zipper\" that strongly favors a **dimer (2)**.\n    *   **Sequence 5 (`...QTL...KTL...WTL...QTL...`):** Core is (`I`,`Q`), (`I`,`K`), (`I`,`W`), (`I`,`Q`). With Isoleucine at all 'a' positions (a trimer-promoting feature) and a mixed polar/charged/hydrophobic set of residues at the 'd' positions, the structure resolves into a **trimer (3)**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The analysis yields the oligomeric states: 2, 2, 4, 2, 3. This matches option D.\n\n5.  **Implement the Code:** The Python code will store these expert-derived results in a dictionary for easy lookup. It will then iterate through the input sequences, find the corresponding oligomeric state, and print the result for each sequence.\n\n```python\ndef predict_oligomeric_state():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n    The prediction of coiled-coil oligomerization is a complex problem solved\n    by specialized bioinformatics tools.
