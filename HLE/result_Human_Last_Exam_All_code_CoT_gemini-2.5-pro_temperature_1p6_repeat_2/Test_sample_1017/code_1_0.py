# Step 1: Define the stable commutator lengths (scl) of the elements
# g_1 and h_2 based on the interpretation of the problem statement.
# The value for g_1 corresponds to the translation by 2/27.
# The value for h_2 corresponds to the translation by 16/27.
scl_g1 = Fraction(2, 27)
scl_h2 = Fraction(16, 27)

# Step 2: According to the theorem on scl in free products for elements
# in the commutator subgroups, the scl of the product is the sum of the scl's.
# scl_{G_1 * G_2}(g_1 * h_2) = scl_{G_1}(g_1) + scl_{G_2}(h_2)
result = scl_g1 + scl_h2

# Step 3: Print the equation with all the numbers and the final result.
# The result is simplified to an irreducible fraction.
