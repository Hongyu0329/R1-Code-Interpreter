def solve_closepact_problem():
    """
    Solves the topological problem by identifying which sets are necessarily closepact.

    The key insight is that for subsets of R or C, a set is 'closepact'
    if and only if it is compact. By the Heine-Borel theorem, this means
    the set must be closed and bounded. This function encodes the analysis
    for each option.
