    "To determine the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **General Formula for GSD:** The ground space degeneracy of a topological phase on a surface is given by `GSD = 2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits the code can store on that surface.\n\n2.  **Topological Dependence of `k`:** The number of logical qubits, `k`, depends on the topology of the surface. Specifically, it's determined by the genus `g` (the number of \"handles\") and the number of boundaries `b` (the number of \"holes\"). For a single, connected surface, the formula for the number of logical qubits is:\n    `k = 2g + b - 1`\n\n3.  **Interpreting the Problem's Geometry:** The problem describes a configuration with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. This typically implies that these holes are punctured into a 2D plane. A plane is topologically equivalent to a sphere, which has a genus `g = 0`.\n\n4.  **Counting the Boundaries:** The total number of boundaries, `b`, includes the `n` smooth holes and the `m` rough holes. However, a plane also has a single boundary \"at infinity\". Therefore, the total number of boundaries on the surface is:\n    `b = n + m + 1`\n\n5.  **Calculating `k`:** Now we can substitute `g = 0` and `b = n + m + 1` into the general formula for `k`:\n    `k = 2*(0) + (n + m + 1) - 1`\n    `k = 0 + n + m + 1 - 1`\n    `k = n + m`\n\n6.  **Final GSD Calculation:** With the number of logical qubits `k = n + m`, the ground space degeneracy is:\n    `GSD = 2^k = 2^(n+m)`\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice A.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this calculation for example values of `n` and `m`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_toric_code_gsd(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code\n    on a plane with n smooth and m rough holes.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes.\n        m (int): The number of rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of logical qubits (k) is determined by the topology.\n    # For a surface with genus g and b boundaries, k = 2*g + b - 1.\n    # A plane has genus g=0.\n    # The total number of boundaries b is n + m + 1 (including the boundary at infinity).\n    # So, k = 2*0 + (n + m + 1) - 1 = n + m.\n    \n    k = n + m\n    \n    # The Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD) is 2^k.\n    gsd = 2**k\n    \n    # Print the final equation with all numbers, as requested.\n    # For example, for n=2 and m=3, this will print \"2^(2+3) = 32\"\n    print(f\"2^({n}+{m}) = {gsd}\")\n\n# Example usage with n=2 smooth holes and m=3 rough holes.\nnum_smooth_holes = 2\nnum_rough_holes = 3\ncalculate_toric_code_gsd(num_smooth_holes, num_rough_holes)\n```\n<<<A>>>"
