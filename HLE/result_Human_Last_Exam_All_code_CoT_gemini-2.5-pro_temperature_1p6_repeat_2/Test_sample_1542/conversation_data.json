    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring `R = Z/8Z`.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Represent the objects**:\n    *   A quadratic form `Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2` over `Z/8Z` can be represented by a tuple of its coefficients `(a, b, c)`, where `a, b, c` are integers from 0 to 7. The total number of such forms is `8 * 8 * 8 = 512`.\n    *   An invertible linear transformation is represented by a 2x2 matrix `M` with entries in `Z/8Z` whose determinant `det(M)` is a unit in `Z/8Z`. The units in `Z/8Z` are {1, 3, 5, 7}. The group of these matrices is denoted `GL(2, Z/8Z)`.\n\n2.  **Define the equivalence relation**:\n    *   Two quadratic forms, `Q` and `Q'`, are equivalent if `Q'` can be obtained from `Q` by a change of variables defined by a transformation `T` from `GL(2, Z/8Z)`. If `T` is represented by matrix `M = [[p, q], [r, s]]`, applying the transformation `(x, y) -> (px+qy, rx+sy)` to `Q(x, y)` yields a new form `Q'(x, y) = a'x^2 + b'xy + c'y^2`. The new coefficients `(a', b', c')` can be calculated from `(a, b, c)` and `(p, q, r, s)`.\n    *   `a' = (a*p^2 + b*p*r + c*r^2) mod 8`\n    *   `b' = (2*a*p*q + b*(p*s + q*r) + 2*c*r*s) mod 8`\n    *   `c' = (a*q^2 + b*q*s + c*s^2) mod 8`\n\n3.  **Count the equivalence classes**:\n    *   The set of all 512 quadratic forms is partitioned into disjoint equivalence classes (orbits) by this relation. The task is to count these partitions.\n    *   I will write a Python script to perform this counting algorithmically:\n        1.  Generate all 512 forms `(a, b, c)`.\n        2.  Generate all matrices `M` in `GL(2, Z/8Z)`.\n        3.  Use a set `classified_forms` to keep track of forms that have already been assigned to a class.\n        4.  Iterate through all forms. If a form hasn't been classified yet, it represents a new class. Increment the class counter, and then find all other forms in its orbit by applying all possible transformations repeatedly. Add all forms found in the orbit to the `classified_forms` set.\n        5.  The final value of the counter is the answer.\n\nThis method ensures that every form is counted in exactly one class.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_quadratic_forms_z8():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring R = Z/8Z.\n\n    A quadratic form is ax^2 + bxy + cy^2.\n    Two forms are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an\n    invertible linear change of variables.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
