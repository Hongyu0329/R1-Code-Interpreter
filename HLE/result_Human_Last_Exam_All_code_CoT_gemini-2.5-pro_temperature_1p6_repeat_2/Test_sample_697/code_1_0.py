    # Scenario A Analysis
    print("--- Analyzing Scenario A ---")
    print("Scenario: A distribution of bonds without a prospectus by Bank of China (Canada) aimed at raising funds from retail investors.")
    print("Analysis: Bank of China (Canada) is a Schedule II bank. Under NI 45-106, distributions of any security by a Schedule I or II bank are exempt from the prospectus requirement. This distribution is compliant.")
    print("Result: Compliant\n")

    # Scenario B Analysis
    print("--- Analyzing Scenario B ---")
    print("Scenario: A distribution of bonds by JPMorgan Chase without a prospectus aimed at raising funds from a large number of investors in Canada.")
    print("Analysis: JPMorgan Chase operates as a Schedule III bank in Canada. The exemption for Schedule III banks is narrower and has specific conditions (e.g., for non-subordinated debt) that are not specified. Compliance is uncertain.")
    print("Result: Non-Compliant/Uncertain\n")

    # Scenario C Analysis
    print("--- Analyzing Scenario C ---")
    print("Scenario: A distribution of shares by a private issuer to an individual investor with a salary of 35,000, net assets of 10,000, and no connection to the company.")
    print("Analysis: The investor does not meet the financial thresholds to be an 'accredited investor'. With 'no connection', the 'private issuer' exemption is also unavailable. This distribution requires a prospectus.")
    print("Result: Non-Compliant. Financial details provided: salary = 35000, net_assets = 10000.\n")

    # Scenario D Analysis
    print("--- Analyzing Scenario D ---")
    print("Scenario: A distribution of shares without a prospectus by Fairstone Bank of Canada aimed at raising funds from a large number of retail investors, one of whom has zero dollars of net assets and is unemployed.")
    print("Analysis: Fairstone Bank of Canada is a Schedule I bank. The prospectus exemption for Schedule I banks is broad and does not depend on the investor's financial situation. The details about the investor with zero assets are irrelevant to this exemption.")
    print("Result: Compliant. The investor detail (net_assets = 0) does not change the compliant status.\n")

    # Scenario E Analysis
    print("--- Analyzing Scenario E ---")
    print("Scenario: A distribution of shares without a prospectus by Caisse populaire acadienne lt√©e aimed at raising funds from a large number of retail investors, one of whom has zero dollars of net assets and is unemployed.")
    print("Analysis: A prospectus exemption exists for credit unions if purchasers become members. However, this is an extra-provincial (New Brunswick) credit union distributing in Ontario, which may face additional regulatory hurdles under Ontario's credit union legislation, making compliance uncertain without more information.")
    print("Result: Non-Compliant/Uncertain\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Both A and D are compliant under the Bank Act exemption. However, D is the 'best' answer as it includes a common distractor (the investor's financial status) to explicitly test the rule that this status is irrelevant for this specific exemption. It represents the most well-defined compliant scenario.")
