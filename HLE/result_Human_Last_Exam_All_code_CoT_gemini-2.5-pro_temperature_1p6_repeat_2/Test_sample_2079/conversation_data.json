    "I will first identify the key entities from your question: the place, which is Bártfa (now known as Bardejov), and the specific year, 1461. Then, I will query historical data to find the name of the individual who held the position of judge in that town during that year. Finally, I will write a Python script to present this historical fact in a clear, readable sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_judge_of_bartfa_1461():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the name of the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n    \"\"\"\n    year = 1461\n    town_name_hungarian = \"Bártfa\"\n    town_name_modern = \"Bardejov\"\n    judge_name = \"Leonard Gál (Lénárt Gál)\"\n\n    print(f\"The judge of {town_name_hungarian} (now {town_name_modern}) in the year {year} was {judge_name}.\")\n\nfind_judge_of_bartfa_1461()\n```\n<<<Leonard Gál (Lénárt Gál)>>>"
