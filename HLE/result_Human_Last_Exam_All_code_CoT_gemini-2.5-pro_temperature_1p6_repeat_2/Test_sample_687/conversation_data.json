    "To find a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles of a knot, we can use a property of its HOMFLY polynomial, denoted as $P(a, z)$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the HOMFLY Polynomial:** First, we need the HOMFLY polynomial for the $9_{23}$ knot.\n2.  **Calculate the Span:** We will determine the span of this polynomial with respect to the variable 'a'. The span is the difference between the highest and lowest powers of 'a' in the polynomial. Let's call the maximum power `max_deg(a)` and the minimum power `min_deg(a)`. The span is `span_a = max_deg(a) - min_deg(a)`.\n3.  **Apply the Inequality:** There's a theorem that provides a relationship between the span of the HOMFLY polynomial and the number of Seifert circles, `s`, of any diagram of the knot: `span_a <= 2 * (s - 1)`.\n4.  **Find the Lower Bound:** By rearranging this inequality, we can find a lower bound for `s`: `s >= (span_a / 2) + 1`. We will calculate this value to get our answer.\n\nThe HOMFLY polynomial $P(a,z)$ for the $9_{23}$ knot is:\n$P(a,z) = -a^4 - a^4z^2 + 2a^2 + 3a^2z^2 + a^2z^4 + 2z^2 - a^{-2} - 3a^{-2}z^2 - 2a^{-4}$\n\nThe following Python code will perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_seifert_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a lower bound for the number of Seifert circles for the 9_23 knot\n    using its HOMFLY polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The HOMFLY polynomial P(a, z) for the 9_23 knot is known.
