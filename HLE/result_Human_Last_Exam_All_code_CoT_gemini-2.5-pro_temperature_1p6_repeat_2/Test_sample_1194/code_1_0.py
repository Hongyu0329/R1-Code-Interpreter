    print("Question: In the context of heterochromatin spreading in Drosophila, what is the primary molecular function of barrier elements that prevent the spread of heterochromatin?\n")

    print("Step 1: Define Heterochromatin Spreading")
    print("Heterochromatin spreads via a 'read-write' mechanism. A reader protein (HP1) binds to a repressive histone mark (H3K9 methylation) and recruits a writer enzyme (histone methyltransferase) to place the same mark on the next nucleosome.\n")

    print("Step 2: Define a Barrier Element's Goal")
    print("A barrier must interrupt this cycle. It must create a chromatin environment that is incompatible with the heterochromatin machinery.\n")

    print("Step 3: Evaluate the Choices\n")

    print("Choice A: They enhance the acetylation of DNA, thus promoting a euchromatic state.")
    print("Evaluation: Strong candidate. Barrier elements recruit Histone Acetyltransferases (HATs). Histone acetylation (especially H3K9ac) creates an active, euchromatic state and directly prevents the H3K9 methylation needed for heterochromatin. This is a primary, well-documented mechanism.\n")

    print("Choice B: They recruit enzymes that demethylate heterochromatin, converting it into a euchromatic state.")
    print("Evaluation: Plausible, but generally seen as secondary to preventing the repressive mark from being set in the first place.\n")

    print("Choice C: They insulate nucleosomes, preventing any acetylation or methylation.")
    print("Evaluation: Incorrect. Barriers are active regions that promote euchromatic marks like acetylation.\n")

    print("Choice D: They disrupt histone-DNA interactions, destabilizing heterochromatin structures.")
    print("Evaluation: Too vague. This is a downstream effect of the specific modifications, not the primary cause.\n")

    print("Choice E: They act as sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins that block heterochromatin spread through steric hindrance.")
    print("Evaluation: A possible contributing factor, but experiments show that the enzymatic activity (recruiting HATs) is the key function, not just the physical bulk of the proteins.\n")

    print("Conclusion: The most accurate description of the primary function is establishing a region of histone acetylation to create a robust euchromatic environment that blocks the spread of heterochromatin. Therefore, Choice A is the best answer, despite the common imprecision of referring to 'DNA acetylation' instead of 'histone acetylation'.")
