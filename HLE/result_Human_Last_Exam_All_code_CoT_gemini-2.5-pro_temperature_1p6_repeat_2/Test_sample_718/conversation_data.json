    "An $n$-resolvable functor is one that admits a projective resolution of length at most $n$. The question asks for the smallest integer $n$ such that any tame functor from an upper semilattice $J$ to the category of vector spaces, $\\text{Vect}_K$, is $n$-resolvable. This problem can be translated into the language of homological algebra for associative algebras.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Translate the Problem:** Rephrase the question in terms of the representation theory of posets. A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is a representation of the poset $J$. The category of such functors is equivalent to the category of modules over the **incidence algebra** $K(J)$. A functor is \"$n$-resolvable\" if its corresponding module has a projective dimension of at most $n$. The question is thus asking for the **global dimension** of the category, which is the maximum projective dimension over all modules.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Conditions:**\n    *   **Upper Semilattice (J):** An upper semilattice is a poset where any two elements have a least upper bound (a join). This is a strong structural property.\n    *   **Tame Functor:** This means the representation theory of $J$ is \"tame\". In representation theory, finite-dimensional algebras (like the incidence algebra $K(J)$ for a finite poset $J$) are classified as either finite, tame, or wild representation type. Tame means the indecomposable modules can be classified and occur in a finite number of discrete series and one-parameter families for each dimension. The condition that $J$ is an upper semilattice is strong enough to exclude the \"wild\" cases.\n\n3.  **Apply Known Theorems:** We need a theorem that bounds the global dimension of the incidence algebra $K(J)$ given these properties.\n    *   A key result by R. Bautista deals with lattices (posets with both joins and meets) of tame representation type. The theorem states that if a finite lattice $L$ is of tame representation type, then the global dimension of its incidence algebra, `gldim(K(L))`, is at most 2.\n    *   This result can be extended to finite upper semilattices. Any finite upper semilattice $J$ can be turned into a lattice $L$ by adding a single minimum element, and this does not increase the global dimension of the corresponding algebra.\n\n4.  **Find the Exact Bound:** To show that $n=2$ is the correct bound (and not a smaller number like 0 or 1), we need to show that a global dimension of 2 is achievable.\n    *   `gldim(K(J)) = 0` only if $J$ is an antichain (semisimple algebra).\n    *   `gldim(K(J)) = 1` if $K(J)$ is a hereditary algebra. This holds if every interval in the poset is a chain.\n    *   Consider the \"diamond poset\": $J = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$ with relations $a < b < d$ and $a < c < d$. This is an upper semilattice (e.g., $b \\lor c = d$). However, the interval $[a, d] = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$ is not a chain, so the algebra is not hereditary. This algebra is known to be of tame representation type, and its global dimension is exactly 2. For instance, the simple module corresponding to the element 'a' has a minimal projective resolution of length 2.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the global dimension is at most 2, but can be equal to 2, any tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is **2-resolvable**.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_functor_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning behind the resolvability of a tame functor\n    from an upper semilattice and provides the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The final answer is n=2.\n    n = 2\n    final_equation = f\"n = {n}\"\n\n    print(\"The question asks for a number 'n' such that a tame functor from an upper semilattice J to vector spaces is n-resolvable.\")\n    print(\"This is a question about the homological dimension of the category of representations of the poset J.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"1.
