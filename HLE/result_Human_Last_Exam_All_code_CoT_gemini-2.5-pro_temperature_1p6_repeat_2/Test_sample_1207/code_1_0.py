    **Analysis of the Clinical Case:**

    The patient, a 44-year-old woman, presents with a classic triad of symptoms highly suggestive of Susac's Syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder affecting the microvasculature of the brain, retina, and inner ear.

    1.  **Ophthalmologic Symptoms:** Transient monocular vision loss points to branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAO).
    2.  **Neurologic/Auditory Symptoms:** Pulsatile headaches and hearing loss indicate involvement of the central nervous system and the cochlea.
    3.  **Systemic Symptoms:** The presence of joint pain, dyspnea, and skin lesions confirms a multi-system inflammatory process.

    **Evaluation of Imaging Findings:**

    The most appropriate imaging modality to confirm Susac's Syndrome is a brain MRI. The expected findings are highly specific:

    *   **"Snowball" hyperintensities:** These are small, round, T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions (microinfarcts) located centrally within the corpus callosum. They are considered a pathognomonic finding for this syndrome.
    *   **Leptomeningeal enhancement:** This finding reflects inflammation of the brain's lining and is also commonly observed in Susac's Syndrome.

    Therefore, the combination of leptomeningeal enhancement and "snowball" hyperintensities on MRI is the expected finding. The other options are inconsistent with the full clinical picture.
