The least plausible explanation is H.

While options A through G represent well-understood and common reasons for missing information in historical texts—such as censorship, state-level redaction, physical decay, or secret communication methods—option H is comparatively weak for several reasons:

1. Overly Convoluted: It combines multiple distinct esoteric systems (Kujiho hand seals, chakras, Taoist rituals) into a single, highly speculative theory without strong historical evidence for such a specific synthesis in this context.
2. Logical Inconsistency: It posits that the circles were the original symbols, not placeholders. If true, it is improbable that generations of scribes would uniformly interpret them as markers for missing *text* (kanji). The problem would be framed as deciphering symbols, not filling in lost words.
3. Lack of Precedent: Compared to the other options, which are grounded in common manuscript transmission issues and historical practices, this theory is the most esoteric and least supported by practical or historical parallels.
