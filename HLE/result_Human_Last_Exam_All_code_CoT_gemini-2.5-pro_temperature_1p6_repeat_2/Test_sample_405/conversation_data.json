    "Here is my plan to solve the task:\n1.  I will identify the main allotropes of pure phosphorus.\n2.  I will list the distinct colors associated with these allotropes.\n3.  I will write a Python script that stores these colors in a list.\n4.  The script will then print the list of colors and output the total count.\n\n```python\n# The primary allotropes of pure phosphorus have distinct colors.\n# We will list these colors to find the total number.\n\n# List of colors for the main allotropes of phosphorus\ncolors_of_phosphorus = [\"white\", \"red\", \"violet\", \"black\"]\n\n# Calculate the number of distinct colors\ncount = len(colors_of_phosphorus)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"The distinct colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus are: {', '.join(colors_of_phosphorus)}.\")\nprint(f\"Based on this, the number of observable colors is {count}.\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
