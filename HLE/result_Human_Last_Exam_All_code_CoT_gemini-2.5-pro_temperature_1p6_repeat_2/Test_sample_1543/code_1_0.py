    This function solves the Capablanca chess mate puzzle.
    
    The position is given by the FEN: 9k/5c1pb1/10/10/10/3Q6/PP5A2/K9 w - - 0 1
    
    The solution involves a forced checkmate sequence.
    The problem asks for the minimal number of moves for White to win.
    
    The winning sequence is a mate in 3:
    1. Qj3   (White traps the black king and threatens Qj8#)
    2. ...    (Black must defend against the immediate mate, e.g., with Cf8)
    3. Ai4   (White sets up an unstoppable mate threat with the Archbishop)
    4. ...    (Black is helpless against the coming checkmate)
    5. Aj6#  (The Archbishop delivers an unblockable knight-check for mate)
    
    The first move by white is move 1.
    The second move by white is move 2.
    The third move by white is move 3, which delivers checkmate.
    
    Therefore, the minimal number of moves is 3.
