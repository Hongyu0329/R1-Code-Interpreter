    # Step 2: Analyze S4 and S3 together
    # S4: "The number of the males is equal to number of the females in my class."
    # S3: "The total number of my friend in my class is even."
    # If S4 is true, the total number of friends is M + M = 2M, which is always an even number.

    # S1: "My name is Fred; and if yesterday was after tomorrow, it would be Wednesday."
    # This is a compound statement (A and B).
    # Part A, "My name is Fred", is true according to the puzzle's premise.
    # Part B, "if yesterday was after tomorrow, it would be Wednesday", is a conditional with a false premise.
    # The premise "yesterday was after tomorrow" is a logical impossibility.
    # In logic, any conditional statement with a false premise is considered vacuously true.
    # Therefore, S1 is a conjunction of (TRUE and TRUE), making S1 itself TRUE.

    print("-" * 50)

    # Step 4: Determine the single true statement and the answer
    # We have determined that S1 is TRUE, and S4 and S5 are FALSE.
    # Since only one statement can be true, S1 must be it. This also means S3 must be false.
    # The puzzle states Fred said the true statement (S1) on the day he tells the truth.
    # The statement S1 is the only one that mentions a day of the week.
