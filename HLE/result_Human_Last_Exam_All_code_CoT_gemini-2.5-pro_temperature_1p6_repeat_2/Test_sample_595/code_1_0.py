# Plan: Calculate the number of grid line crossings for each side of the triangle
# when its legs are aligned with the coordinate axes.

# The triangle is a right-angled isosceles triangle with legs of length 18.
# We align the legs with the x and y axes to maximize grid crossings.
# The vertices are placed slightly off the integer grid to avoid lattice points,
# e.g., A=(18+e, e), B=(e, e), C=(e, 18+e) where e is small.

# 1. Calculate crossings for the first leg (e.g., placed horizontally).
# It spans from x=e to x=18+e, so it crosses vertical lines x=1, 2, ..., 18.
leg1_crossings = 18

# 2. Calculate crossings for the second leg (placed vertically).
# It spans from y=e to y=18+e, so it crosses horizontal lines y=1, 2, ..., 18.
leg2_crossings = 18

# 3. Calculate crossings for the hypotenuse.
# It connects the ends of the legs, spanning 18 units horizontally and 18 units vertically.
# It crosses vertical lines x=1, ..., 18 (18 crossings).
# It crosses horizontal lines y=1, ..., 18 (18 crossings).
hypotenuse_crossings = 18 + 18

# The total number of squares the perimeter passes through (k) is the total number of crossings.
k = leg1_crossings + leg2_crossings + hypotenuse_crossings

# Output the breakdown of the calculation.
