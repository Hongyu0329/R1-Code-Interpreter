Tagalog and Mongolian are two languages from distinct Asian cultures (the Philippines and Mongolia) that have highly similar words for "broom", "mom", and "dad" despite having no direct historical contact. The Tagalog words are Ama (dad), Ina (mom), and Walis (broom), which are coincidentally similar to the Mongolian words Aav (dad), Eej (mom), and Bilis (broom).
