    Solves the pattern puzzle by identifying the sequence of letters and their transformed values.
    
    The logic follows these steps:
    1. The letters in the sequence are composed of only straight lines.
    2. The letters, when arranged alphabetically, correspond to the numbers in the sequence.
    3. The number for a letter is the sum of the digits of its alphabet position (A=1, ..., Z=26).
    
    Through logical deduction, the sequence of letters is identified.
    The final equation shows the transformation for the missing letter.
