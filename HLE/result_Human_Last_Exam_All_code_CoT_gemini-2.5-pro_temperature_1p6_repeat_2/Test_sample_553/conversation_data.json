    "The user is asking a music theory question about the Beatles' discography. I need to identify a song that begins with a specific chord progression: from the tonic chord (the \"home\" chord of the key) to the minor fifth chord.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  I will first analyze the requested chord progression: Tonic to minor fifth (I -> v). This is an unusual progression because in a major key, the fifth chord is typically major (V). This progression is more characteristic of a minor key (i -> v) or modal mixture.\n2.  I will mentally scan through famous Beatles song intros to find a match.\n3.  The song \"I'll Be Back\" from the album \"A Hard Day's Night\" is a prime candidate. I will analyze its introduction.\n4.  The main key of \"I'll Be Back\" is A major. However, the song's introduction is famously in the parallel minor key, A minor.\n5.  In the key of A minor, the tonic chord (i) is A minor (Am). The fifth note of the A minor scale is E, and the chord built on it is an E minor chord (Em), which is the minor fifth (v).\n6.  The very first two chords of \"I'll Be Back\" are A minor followed by E minor.\n7.  This perfectly matches the user's request for a song starting with a jump from the tonic to the minor fifth.\n8.  I will write a Python script that explains this analysis and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the user's music theory question and provides the answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"I'll Be Back\"\n    album = \"A Hard Day's Night\"\n    key = \"A Major\"\n    intro_key = \"A Minor\"\n    \n    # Chord Analysis\n    tonic_chord_of_intro = \"A Minor (Am)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"E Minor (Em)\"\n    \n    # Explanation\n    print(\"Analyzing the chord progression: Tonic (I) to minor fifth (v).\")\n    print(\"This is an uncommon progression, often involving a shift between major and minor modes.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The song that fits this description is '{song_title}' from the album '{album}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Here is the step-by-step analysis:\")\n    print(f\"1.
