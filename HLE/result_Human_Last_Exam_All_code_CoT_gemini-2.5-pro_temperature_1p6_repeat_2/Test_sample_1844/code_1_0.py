# Step 1: Define the folding process.
# A square is folded 4 times: top-to-bottom, left-to-right, top-to-bottom, left-to-right.
# This is equivalent to two sets of (top-to-bottom, left-to-right) folds.

# Step 2: Determine the number of layers at each of the four corners of the final folded square.
# After the first two folds, the four corners have different layer thicknesses:
# - One corner is an original corner of the paper (1 layer).
# - Two corners are on a single fold line (2 layers each).
# - One corner is at the intersection of two folds, the center (4 layers).
base_layers = [1, 2, 2, 4]

# The next two folds repeat this process on the already folded piece.
# The number of layers at the final corners is the product of the layers
# from the first folding process and the multipliers from the second.
# - The final '1-layer' corner corresponds to the '1-layer' corner of the first folded piece. Layers = 1 * 1 = 1.
# - The two final '4-layer' corners correspond to the '2-layer' corners on the '2-layer' folds. Layers = 2 * 2 = 4.
# - The final '16-layer' corner corresponds to the '4-layer' center on the '4-layer' center. Layers = 4 * 4 = 16.

corner1_layers = base_layers[0] * base_layers[0]
corner2_layers = base_layers[1] * base_layers[1] # Using the 2-layer corner
corner3_layers = base_layers[2] * base_layers[2] # Using the other 2-layer corner
corner4_layers = base_layers[3] * base_layers[3]

# Step 3: Calculate the number of edges for the resulting shapes.
# The original square had 4 outer edges.
# The cut at the 1-layer corner clips a corner of the original square,
# increasing the outer edge count by 1.
original_edges = 4
outer_boundary_edges = original_edges + 1

# The other cuts create internal holes. The number of edges for each hole
# is equal to the number of layers at the corner where the cut was made.
hole1_edges = corner2_layers
hole2_edges = corner3_layers
hole3_edges = corner4_layers

# Step 4: Sum all edges to find the total.
# The total edges are the sum of the outer boundary edges and the edges of all internal holes.
total_edges = outer_boundary_edges + hole1_edges + hole2_edges + hole3_edges

# Print the final calculation, showing each component of the sum.
print(f"The resulting shape has a {outer_boundary_edges}-sided outer boundary.")
print(f"There are three holes with {hole1_edges}, {hole2_edges}, and {hole3_edges} edges respectively.")
print("The total number of edges is the sum of the outer boundary and all hole edges.")
print(f"Total Edges = {outer_boundary_edges} + {hole1_edges} + {hole2_edges} + {hole3_edges} = {total_edges}")
