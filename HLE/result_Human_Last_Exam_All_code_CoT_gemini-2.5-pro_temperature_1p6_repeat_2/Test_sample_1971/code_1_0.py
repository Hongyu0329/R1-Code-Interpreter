# Define symbols for the calculation
# R represents the scalar curvature of the vacuum spacetime.
# kappa_sq represents the square of the gravitational coupling constant kappa.
R, kappa_sq = sympy.symbols('R kappa_sq')

# Step 1: Determine the value of beta
# Based on the requirement that the S-independent variation of L_cos vanishes,
# we derived the algebraic condition (-1 - beta) = 0.
beta_eq = sympy.Eq(-1 - sympy.Symbol('beta'), 0)
beta_sol = sympy.solve(beta_eq)
beta = beta_sol[0]

# Step 2: Determine the value of alpha^2
# From the bosonic equations of motion in the vacuum, we derived the relation
# between the scalar curvature R and the parameter alpha.
# The relation is R = 3 * kappa^2 * alpha^2.
# We solve this for alpha^2.
alpha_sq_expr = R / (3 * kappa_sq)

# Print the results
# The problem asks for the number of beta and alpha^2.
# Since R and kappa are not given numerical values, we present the result for beta,
# and the formula for alpha^2.
