    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we can use the general topological relations for Feynman diagrams.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant formulas:** There are two key formulas that relate the number of loops (`L`), vertices (`V`), internal lines (`I`), and external lines (`E`) in a connected diagram.\n    *   The first formula defines the number of loops: `L = I - V + 1`.\n    *   The second formula relates how lines connect to vertices. If each vertex involves `n` fields (e.g., `n=4` for a `\\phi^4` interaction), then: `n * V = 2 * I + E`.\n\n2.  **Set the conditions:**\n    *   We are given that the diagram has two loops, so `L = 2`.\n    *   To find the *minimum* number of vertices, we should consider the simplest possible diagrams, which are vacuum bubble diagrams. These diagrams have no incoming or outgoing particles, so the number of external lines `E` is 0.\n    *   We also need to choose an interaction type, which determines `n`. A common and simple interaction is the `\\phi^4` theory, where `n=4`. This theory often leads to diagrams with a low vertex count.\n\n3.  **Solve for V:** I will combine the two formulas to create a single equation that solves for the number of vertices `V` in terms of `L`, `E`, and `n`.\n\n4.  **Execute the calculation:** I will write a Python script that plugs the values (`L=2`, `E=0`, `n=4`) into the derived formula and calculates the minimum number of vertices `V`. The script will print out each step of the calculation for clarity.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_min_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in an interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    #\n    # We start with two fundamental topological relations for a connected Feynman diagram:\n    # 1) L = I - V + 1\n    #    L = number of loops\n    #    I = number of internal lines (propagators)\n    #    V = number of vertices (interactions)\n    #\n    # 2) n * V = 2 * I + E\n    #    n = number of fields meeting at each vertex (e.g., n=4 for a phi^4 theory)\n    #    E = number of external lines (incoming/outgoing particles)\n    #\n    # Our goal is to solve for V.\n\n    # Step 1: Define the knowns for our specific problem.\n    # We want a two-loop diagram.\n    L = 2\n    # To find the absolute minimum number of vertices, we consider the simplest\n    # possible process, which is a vacuum diagram with no external particles.\n    E = 0\n    # Let's consider the common phi^4 interaction, which often allows for the\n    # most compact diagrams.
