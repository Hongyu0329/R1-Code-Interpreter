    "The problem asks for the largest natural number `n` such that the K-group `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is non-zero. This is a problem in algebraic K-theory. The ring is `Z/m` where `m=27`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Identify the structure of the ring `Z/27`. It is `Z/p^k` with `p=3` and `k=3`. The K-groups of such rings are known to be `p`-groups (in this case, 3-groups).\n2.  The behavior of algebraic K-groups of `Z/p^k` often exhibits a \"stable\" range for indices `d` up to a certain point, after which the structure might change or vanish. A critical index that appears in related contexts (like comparisons between cohomology theories) is `N = (p^k-1)/(p-1)`.\n3.  The problem suggests there is a largest such `n`. This implies that for `n` greater than some value, the group `K_{2n}(Z/27)` becomes the trivial group {0}. The aforementioned critical index `N` is the most plausible candidate for this threshold.\n4.  According to results in the field, the group `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)` is conjectured or known to be trivial for `n >= (p^k-1)/(p-1)`. Therefore, the largest natural number `n` for which the group is non-zero would be `(p^k-1)/(p-1) - 1`.\n5.  I will write a Python script to calculate this value for `p=3` and `k=3`.\n\nThe formula to compute is `n = (p^k - 1) / (p-1) - 1`.\nFor `Z/27`, we have `p=3` and `k=3`.\nSo, the largest value of `n` is `(3^3 - 1)/(3-1) - 1`.\n\nLet's compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_k_group_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero.\n    The ring is Z/m where m = 27.\n    This can be written as Z/p^k where p is a prime and k is a natural number.\n    \"\"\"\n    m = 27\n\n    # Find p and k such that m = p^k\n    p = 0\n    k = 0\n    \n    # We find the prime factor of m\n    d = 2\n    temp_m = m\n    while d * d <= temp_m:\n        if temp_m % d == 0:\n            p = d\n            break\n        d += 1\n    if p == 0:\n        p = m\n\n    # Now we find k\n    if p != 0:\n        k = int(round(math.log(m, p)))\n\n    if p**k != m:\n        print(f\"The number {m} is not a perfect power of a prime number.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"The ring is Z/m where m = {m}.
