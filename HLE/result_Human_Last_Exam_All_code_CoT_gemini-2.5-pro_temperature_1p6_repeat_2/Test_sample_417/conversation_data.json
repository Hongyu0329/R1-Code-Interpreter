    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we will analyze the molecule's structure for chemical equivalence.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Assess Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central benzene ring substituted at positions 1, 3, and 5 with identical, large groups, and at positions 2, 4, and 6 with methyl groups. This configuration gives the molecule C3 rotational symmetry.\n2.  **Identify Equivalent Groups:** Due to this C3 symmetry, the three large substituent \"arms\" are chemically equivalent, and the three methyl groups on the central ring are also chemically equivalent.\n3.  **Count Peaks:** We only need to count the number of unique proton environments in the central core and within a single substituent arm. The total number of peaks will be the sum of these two counts.\n4.  **Analyze the Arm's Protons:** The substituent arm is chiral and lacks internal symmetry. This means protons in CH2 groups or gem-dimethyl groups will be diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent, giving separate signals.\n5.  **Sum and Conclude:** We will sum the number of peaks from the core and one arm to find the total.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the structure of the given molecule to determine the number of expected 1H NMR peaks.\n    The molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation of 1H NMR peaks:\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the central core due to C3 symmetry.\n    # The three methyl groups on the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core are equivalent.\n    core_methyl_peaks = 1\n    print(f\"1.
