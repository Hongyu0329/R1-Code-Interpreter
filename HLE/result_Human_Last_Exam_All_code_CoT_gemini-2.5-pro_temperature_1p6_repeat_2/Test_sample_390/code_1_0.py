# Let's analyze the shape of S by considering a concrete 2D example.
# Suppose y1, y2 are vectors in R^2.
# Let y1 = [1, 0] and y2 = [1, 1]. These are linearly independent.
# Their span is the entire R^2 plane.
# The vector s is a unit vector in their span, so s = [cos(t), sin(t)] for t in [0, 2*pi).

# Define the symbols for our calculation
x1, x2, t = sympy.symbols('x1 x2 t')

# The components of a point in the set S are x_k = |<y_k, s>|^2.
# For our example:
# x1 = |<[1, 0], [cos(t), sin(t)]>|^2 = (cos(t))^2
# x2 = |<[1, 1], [cos(t), sin(t)]>|^2 = (cos(t) + sin(t))^2

print("\nTo find the shape, we eliminate the parameter 't' to get an implicit equation in x1 and x2.")

# We use trigonometric double-angle identities to relate x1 and x2.
# x1 = cos(t)^2  can be rewritten using cos(2t) = 2*cos(t)^2 - 1, which gives:
# cos(2t) = 2*x1 - 1
#
# x2 = cos(t)^2 + sin(t)^2 + 2*sin(t)*cos(t) = 1 + sin(2t), which gives:
# sin(2t) = x2 - 1

# Now we use the fundamental identity: (cos(2t))^2 + (sin(2t))^2 = 1.
# Substitute the expressions in terms of x1 and x2:
final_equation = (2*x1 - 1)**2 + (x2 - 1)**2 - 1

# Expand the equation to get the standard form of a conic section
expanded_eq = sympy.expand(final_equation)

# To robustly extract the coefficients, we can treat it as a polynomial
poly_eq = sympy.poly(expanded_eq, x1, x2)
# The coefficients are stored in a dictionary mapping monomial tuples to coefficients
coeffs_map = poly_eq.as_dict()

# The general form of a conic section is A*x1^2 + B*x1*x2 + C*x2^2 + D*x1 + E*x2 + F = 0
A = coeffs_map.get((2, 0), 0)  # Coefficient of x1^2
