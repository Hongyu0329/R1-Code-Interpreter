    "The pattern in this sequence is not a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. To find the next number, we need to uncover a hidden rule. The sequence appears to be generated based on a transformation of another, simpler sequence.\n\nLet's hypothesize a transformation `f(n)` that is applied to each number `n` in the sequence. A plausible transformation, given the nature of such puzzles, is to operate on the digits of the number. Let's define `f(n)` as the sum of the squares of the digits of `n`.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis on a few terms from the beginning of the sequence:\n*   `f(111)` = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3\n*   `f(142)` = 1² + 4² + 2² = 1 + 16 + 4 = 21\n*   `f(111)` = 1² + 1² + 1² = 3\n\nThe start of our original sequence `(111, 142, 111, ...)` becomes `(3, 21, 3, ...)` after the transformation. This `x, y, x` pattern suggests the transformation is meaningful.\n\nNow let's apply this transformation to the last few numbers of the sequence: `... 124, 124, 124, 36, 124`.\n*   `f(124)` = 1² + 2² + 4² = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21\n*   `f(36)` = 3² + 6² = 9 + 36 = 45\n\nThe end of the transformed sequence is `(..., 21, 21, 21, 45, 21)`. This reveals a clear structural pattern that was hidden in the original sequence.\n\nThe \"next number\" is therefore found by applying this transformation to the last number in the sequence, which is 124. The following Python code will calculate this for you and display the equation used to find the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the next number in the sequence by applying a transformation\n    to the last number. The transformation is the sum of the squares of the digits.\n    \"\"\"\n    last_number_str = \"124\"\n    \n    # Get the digits of the last number\n    digits = [int(d) for d in last_number_str]\n    \n    # Calculate the squares of the digits\n    squares = [d * d for d in digits]\n    \n    # Sum the squares to get the result\n    result = sum(squares)\n    \n    # Build the equation string part by part to meet the output requirement\n    equation_parts = []\n    for d in digits:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{d}*{d}\")\n    \n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    # Print the final equation with the result\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<21>>>"
