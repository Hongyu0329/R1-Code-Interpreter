# The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes for a space X with specific properties.

# Step 1: Analyze the properties of X.
# X is a metric space (and thus Hausdorff).
# X is locally compact.
# X is a one-to-one continuous image of the real line R.
# This implies there is a continuous bijection f: R -> X.

# Step 2: Conclude X is homeomorphic to R.
# A theorem in topology states that a continuous bijection from a locally compact
# Hausdorff space (like R) to a Hausdorff space (like X) is a homeomorphism.
# Therefore, any such space X must be homeomorphic to the real line R.
# This means there is at most one homeomorphism class.

# Step 3: Verify that such a space exists.
# We check if R itself satisfies the properties, especially the separation property:
# For distinct x, y in X, there is a closed, connected set K such that
# x is in the interior of K and y is not in K.

# Let X = R. Let x, y be in R, with x < y.
# We need to find a closed connected set K in R. These are closed intervals [a, b].
# Let's choose an interval K such that x is in its interior and y is not.
# For example, K = [x - 1, (x + y) / 2].
# The interior of K is (x - 1, (x + y) / 2).
# Clearly, x is in the interior of K.
# Also, since x < y, we have (x + y) / 2 < y, so y is not in K.
# Thus, R satisfies all the given properties.

# Step 4: Final Conclusion.
# Since any such space X must be homeomorphic to R, and R itself is such a space,
# there is exactly one such homeomorphism class.

number_of_homeomorphism_classes = 1

# Final Answer
