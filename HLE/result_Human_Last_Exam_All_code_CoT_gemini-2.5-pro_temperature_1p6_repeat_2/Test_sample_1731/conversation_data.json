    "Of course. Here is the python code to solve the task.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Conceptual Framework:** The problem asks for the equilibrium properties of a photon gas (the Bose case of light quanta) using principles from large deviation theory. The standard method in statistical mechanics to find this equilibrium is to maximize the system's entropy, which is a direct application of the large deviation principle. The macrostate with the highest entropy (the highest number of corresponding microstates) is overwhelmingly the most probable one. We will maximize the Boltzmann entropy `S = k * ln(W)` for a system of bosons, subject to a constraint on the total energy.\n2.  **Bose-Einstein Statistics:** The number of ways `W` to distribute `n_i` indistinguishable bosons into `g_i` states at energy level `e_i` is given by `W = Π_i (n_i + g_i - 1)! / (n_i! * (g_i - 1)!)`. For large numbers, we use Stirling's approximation (`ln(x!) ≈ x*ln(x) - x`) on `ln(W)` to find the entropy `S`.\n3.  **Maximization with Constraints:** We will use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize the entropy `S` subject to the constraint of a constant total energy, `Σ n_i * e_i = E`. A crucial point for photons (light quanta) is that their number is not conserved, so we do not need a constraint on the total particle number `N`. This is equivalent to setting the chemical potential, or its corresponding Lagrange multiplier, to zero.\n4.  **Implementation:** I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform the symbolic differentiation and solve for the equilibrium distribution `n_i`. From this distribution, I will derive and print the final equations for the mean energy per energy level `E_i` and the entropy per energy level `S_i`. The total energy and entropy of the system are the sums (or integrals) of these quantities over all levels.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef derive_bose_einstein_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives the equilibrium mean energy and entropy for a Bose gas of photons\n    by maximizing the Boltzmann entropy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
