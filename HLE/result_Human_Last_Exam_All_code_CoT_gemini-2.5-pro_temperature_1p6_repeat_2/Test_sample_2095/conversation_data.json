    "My plan is to first locate the specific text where the Song Dynasty scholar Liu Ban (刘攽) evaluates the poetry of the Tang Dynasty poet Zhang Ji (张籍). The most likely source for this is Liu Ban's collection of poetic criticism, *Zhongshan Shijia* (《中山诗话》). After finding the original text, I will analyze its meaning, focusing on the evaluation of the seven-character poems (七言诗).\n\nThe final answer will be presented in Chinese, as requested. To adhere to the specified output format, I will embed this answer within a Python script. The script will simply store the detailed explanation in a multi-line string and then use the `print()` function to display it to the user.\n\n```python\ndef get_evaluation_of_zhang_ji():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints Liu Ban's evaluation of Zhang Ji's seven-character poems.\n    The evaluation is taken from Liu Ban's \"Zhongshan Shijia\" (《中山诗话》).\n    \"\"\"\n    evaluation_text = \"\"\"北宋的刘攽在其著作《中山诗话》中对张籍的七言诗做出了具体的评价。\n\n他的评价可以概括为以下几点：\n\n1.  **指出不足**: 刘攽首先指出张籍的七言诗“情思稍凡，属对亦偶有不精者”。这句话的意思是说，这些诗在情感思想的表达上略显平凡普通，并且对仗的运用有时不够精炼。\n\n2.  **肯定核心优点**: 尽管指出了缺点，刘攽紧接着补充道：“但意与语佳，则一切可略耳。” 这意味着，只要诗歌的整体立意（意）和语言（语）是出色的，那么前面提到的那些不足之处就完全可以忽略不计。\n\n3.  **举例赞扬**: 为了证明自己的观点，他引用了张籍的名句“无数春风来海上，尽随明月到扬州”，并盛赞此句“语意宏放”（语言和意境气魄宏大），认为张籍正是因为能写出这样杰出的诗句，其崇高的声誉是名副其实的（“宜其名高也”）。\n\n综上所述，刘攽的评价是辩证且中肯的：他既指出了张籍七言诗在构思和对仗上的一些小瑕疵，但更推崇其在立意和语言上的宏大成就，并认为后者足以掩盖前者的不足。\"\"\"\n\n    print(evaluation_text)\n\nget_evaluation_of_zhang_ji()\n```\n<<<刘攽评价张籍的七言诗为：“情思稍凡，属对亦偶有不精者，但意与语佳，则一切可略耳。”>>>"
