    "The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is found by identifying all the continuous transformations of space, time, and the fields (velocity and pressure) that leave the form of the equations unchanged. These symmetries form a Lie group, and its dimension is the number of independent parameters needed to specify a transformation within that group.\n\nThe plan is to:\n1.  Identify each fundamental symmetry of the equations.\n2.  Determine the dimension (number of independent parameters) for each symmetry.\n3.  Sum these dimensions to get the total dimension of the Lie group.\n\nThe fundamental symmetries are:\n*   **Time translations:** Shifting the time origin ($t \\to t + \\tau$). This has 1 parameter.\n*   **Space translations:** Shifting the spatial origin ($x \\to x + a$). Since we are in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this has 3 parameters.\n*   **Rotations:** Rotating the spatial coordinate system. This is the special orthogonal group SO(3), which has 3 parameters (e.g., Euler angles).\n*   **Galilean boosts:** Shifting to a new reference frame moving at a constant velocity ($x \\to x + vt, u \\to u + v$). This has 3 parameters for the velocity vector.\n*   **Scaling:** A specific uniform scaling of time, space, velocity and pressure ($t \\to \\lambda^2 t, x \\to \\lambda x, u \\to \\lambda^{-1} u, p \\to \\lambda^{-2} p$). This transformation group is parameterized by a single scaling factor $\\lambda$, so it has 1 dimension.\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of these individual symmetries. The following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the\n    incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3.\n    \n    The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of the individual\n    symmetry transformations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
