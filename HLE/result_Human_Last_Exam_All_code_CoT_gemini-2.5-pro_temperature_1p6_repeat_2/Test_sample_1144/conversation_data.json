    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):** We'll use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. We will use the minimum uncertainty, so the formula becomes: Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx).\n2.  **Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p):** According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) is quantized and given by L = nħ. For the first orbit (n=1), L = ħ. Since angular momentum is also L = p * r (momentum times radius), the momentum is p = ħ / r₁. Here, r₁ is the radius of the first Bohr orbit, also known as the Bohr radius (a₀).\n3.  **Find the ratio (Δp / p):** We will divide the result from step 1 by the result from step 2. This simplifies to (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / r₁), which is equal to r₁ / (2 * Δx).\n4.  **Substitute the known values and compute:** We will use the standard values for the Bohr radius (r₁) and the given uncertainty in position (Δx) to calculate the final numerical ratio.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs these calculations:\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants as const\n\n# --- Given values and constants ---\n\n# Uncertainty in position (Δx) is 10 pm.
