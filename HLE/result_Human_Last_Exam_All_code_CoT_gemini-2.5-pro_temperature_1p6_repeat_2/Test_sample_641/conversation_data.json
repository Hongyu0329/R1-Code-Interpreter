    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we need to identify all conjugacy classes of elements of order 2 within this group and sum their sizes.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and Involutions:** The group is `G = PSU(n, q)` with `n = 4` and `q = 997`. An involution is an element `x` in `G` such that `x^2 = 1` and `x ≠ 1`. Elements `g` in the special unitary group `SU(4, q)` project to involutions in `PSU(4, q)` if `g^2` is in the center of `SU(4, q)`. For our case (`n=4, q=997`), the center is `{I, -I}`. This leads to two types of preimages `g`:\n    *   **Type C:** `g^2 = I` (true involutions in `SU`).\n    *   **Type D:** `g^2 = -I` (quasi-involutions, elements of order 4 in `SU`).\n\n2.  **Analyze Type C Involutions:** These involutions correspond to a decomposition of the vector space `V = W \\oplus W^\\perp`. The conjugacy class is determined by the dimension `k` of `W`. For the element to be in `SU(4, q)`, its determinant, `(-1)^k`, must be 1, meaning `k` must be even. With `n=4`, the only non-trivial case is `k=2`. This gives a single conjugacy class of involutions in `PSU(4, q)`. The total number of such involutions is given by the size of this class, which can be calculated as:\n    `N_C = |GU(4,q)| / |GU(2,q)|^2`\n\n3.  **Analyze Type D Involutions:** These are elements `g` with `g^2 = -I`. Such elements exist because `q = 997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`. All such elements in `SU(4,q)` belong to a single conjugacy class in `GU(4,q)` and project to involutions in `PSU(4,q)`. The total number of these involutions is given by the size of the corresponding class(es), which is:\n    `N_D = |GU(4,q)| / |GL(2,q)|`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of involutions is the sum `N_C + N_D`. We will use the standard formulas for the orders of the general unitary group `GU(n, q)` and the general linear group `GL(n, q)` to compute this sum.\n\n    *   `|GU(n,q)| = q^{n(n-1)/2} * Π_{i=1 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`\n    *   `|GL(n,q)| = q^{n(n-1)/2} * Π_{i=1 to n} (q^i - 1)`\n\n5.  **Final Computation:** A Python script will be used to perform the calculations with `q = 997`, compute the values for `N_C` and `N_D`, and output the final sum along with the equation showing the components.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Set the value of q\nq = 997\n\n# The number of involutions is the sum of two terms, N_C and N_D.\n\n# Term 1: N_C = |GU(4,q)| / |GU(2,q)|^2\n# This simplifies to q**4 * (q**2 - q + 1) * (q**2 + 1)\nnc_p1 = q**4\nnc_p2 = q**2 - q + 1\nnc_p3 = q**2 + 1\nterm_nc = nc_p1 * nc_p2 * nc_p3\n\n# Term 2: N_D = |GU(4,q)| / |GL(2,q)|\n# This simplifies to q**5 * (q + 1)**3 * (q**2 - q + 1) * (q**2 + 1)\nnd_p1 = q**5\nnd_p2 = (q + 1)**3\nnd_p3 = q**2 - q + 1\nnd_p4 = q**2 + 1\nterm_nd = nd_p1 * nd_p2 * nd_p3 * nd_p4\n\n# Calculate the total number of involutions\ntotal_involutions = term_nc + term_nd\n\n# Print the final equation with all its components and the result\n# The equation is N_C + N_D = total\n# where N_C = nc_p1 * nc_p2 * nc_p3\n# and   N_D = nd_p1 * nd_p2 * nd_p3 * nd_p4\nprint(\"The number of involutions is the sum of involutions of type C and type D.\")\nprint(\"Number from Type C classes (g^2=I):\")\nprint(f\"{nc_p1} * {nc_p2} * {nc_p3} = {term_nc}\")\nprint(\"\\nNumber from Type D classes (g^2=-I):\")\nprint(f\"{nd_p1} * {nd_p2} * {nd_p3} * {nd_p4} = {term_nd}\")\nprint(\"\\nTotal number of involutions is the sum:\")\nprint(f\"{term_nc} + {term_nd} = {total_involutions}\")\n\n# For a single expression as requested:\n# The format required is \"each number in the final equation\", which means printing the components\n# of the sum.\nprint(\"\\nFinal equation with all components:\")\nprint(f\"{nc_p1} * {nc_p2} * {nc_p3} + {nd_p1} * {nd_p2} * {nd_p3} * {nd_p4} = {total_involutions}\")\n```\n<<<977157852331610953688198595356984>>>"
