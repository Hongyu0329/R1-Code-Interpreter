    "Of course. Here is a plan to determine the correct ballet school, followed by a Python script that codifies this knowledge.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  I will create a Python dictionary containing information about the training methods of each listed ballet school, specifically focusing on their approach to pointe work during barre exercises.\n2.  The program will then iterate through this dictionary to find the school whose methodology matches the condition described in the question: \"train on the barre with mostly pointe shoes.\"\n3.  Finally, the script will print a detailed explanation of why the identified school is the correct answer and output the corresponding letter choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_school_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballet school training methods to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    schools_data = {\n        \"A\": {\n            \"name\": \"La Scala\",\n            \"method_summary\": \"Primarily follows the Italian Cecchetti method. Pointe work is critical, but the entire barre is not typically performed on pointe.\"\n        },\n        \"B\": {\n            \"name\": \"Vaganova\",\n            \"method_summary\": \"The Vaganova method emphasizes building immense strength in soft shoes at the barre before moving to pointe work in the center.
