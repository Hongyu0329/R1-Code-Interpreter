    "This problem requires us to determine the possible range for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 curve. Let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the objects:** We are given a genus $g=3$ curve $C$ and the variety $X = C^{(15)}$, its 15th symmetric power. We need to find the rank of its Néron-Severi group, $\\rho(X) = \\text{rank}(\\text{NS}(X))$.\n2.  **Use Macdonald's Formula:** There is a well-known formula by Macdonald for the Picard group of the symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ of a curve $C$ of genus $g$, which holds when $d \\ge 2g-1$. The formula relates the Néron-Severi group of $C^{(d)}$ to that of the curve $C$ and its Jacobian $J(C)$. Taking ranks, the formula is:\n    $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(C) + \\rho(J(C))$\n3.  **Check the condition:** We must verify that the condition $d \\ge 2g-1$ holds for our parameters.\n4.  **Determine $\\rho(C)$:** The rank of the Néron-Severi group of any smooth projective curve is a fixed constant.\n5.  **Find the range of $\\rho(J(C))$:** The key part of the problem is to find the minimum and maximum possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve. This depends on whether the curve $C$ is \"general\" or has special properties (like its Jacobian having complex multiplication).\n6.  **Calculate the final answer:** By combining the results, we can calculate the minimum and maximum values for $\\rho(X)$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of X = C^(15), the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface C.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define problem parameters\n    g = 3  # Genus of the curve C\n    d = 15 # Degree of the symmetric power X = C^(d)\n\n    print(\"The problem is to find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = C^(d).\")\n    print(f\"Given: Genus of the curve C is g = {g}.\")\n    print(f\"       The variety X is the d-th symmetric power, with d = {d}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: State the relevant formula and check its condition\n    print(\"For a symmetric power C^(d) of a curve C of genus g, there is a formula for the rank of its Neron-Severi group (the Picard number rho):\")\n    print(\"rho(C^(d)) = rho(C) + rho(J(C))\")\n    print(\"This formula is valid if d >= 2*g - 1.\")\n\n    condition_val = 2 * g - 1\n    print(f\"Checking the condition: We need d >= 2*g - 1.\")\n    print(f\"Here, d = {d} and 2*g - 1 = 2*{g} - 1 = {condition_val}.\")\n\n    if d < condition_val:\n        print(f\"Error: The condition {d} >= {condition_val} is not met.
