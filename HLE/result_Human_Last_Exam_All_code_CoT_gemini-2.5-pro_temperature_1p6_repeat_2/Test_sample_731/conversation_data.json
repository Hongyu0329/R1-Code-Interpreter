    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cyclic subgroups (also known as power subgroups) in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. In general, a semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ has an order of $2^n$. For size 512, we have $2^n = 512$, which gives $n = 9$.\n\n2.  **Understand \"Power Subgroup\":** A \"power subgroup\" is another term for a \"cyclic subgroup\". A subgroup is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element. Our goal is to count the number of unique subgroups $\\langle g \\rangle$ for every element $g$ in $SD_{512}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of $SD_{2^n}$:** The group $SD_{2^n}$ can be described by generators and relations:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = e, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    For $n=9$, this is:\n    $SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = e, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The group consists of two main parts:\n    *   A cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ of order $2^{n-1} = 256$.\n    *   A set of $2^{n-1} = 256$ elements of the form $sr^i$, which are not in $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Count the Cyclic Subgroups:** We can partition the cyclic subgroups into three distinct categories based on their generating elements:\n\n    a.  **Subgroups contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$**: The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_{256}$. The number of subgroups of a cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_m$ is equal to the number of divisors of $m$, denoted $\\tau(m)$. For $m=256=2^8$, the number of divisors is $\\tau(2^8) = 8+1 = 9$. These are all cyclic.\n\n    b.  **Subgroups generated by elements $sr^i$ of order 2**: An element $sr^i$ in $SD_{2^9}$ has order 2 if and only if $i$ is even. There are $256/2 = 128$ even values for $i$ in the range $0 \\le i < 256$. Each of these elements generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2 of the form $\\{e, sr^i\\}$. These subgroups are distinct from any subgroup within $\\langle r \\rangle$ (except for the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$, which is already counted). This gives us $2^{n-2} = 2^7 = 128$ new subgroups.\n\n    c.  **Subgroups generated by elements $sr^i$ of order 4**: An element $sr^i$ in $SD_{2^9}$ has order 4 if and only if $i$ is odd. There are 128 odd values for $i$. These elements generate cyclic subgroups of order 4. It can be shown that the elements $sr^i$ and $sr^{i+128}$ generate the same subgroup. This means the 128 elements of order 4 form $128/2=64$ distinct cyclic subgroups. None of these are contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$. This gives us $2^{n-3} = 2^6 = 64$ new subgroups.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from these three categories.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # A power subgroup is a cyclic subgroup.\n    # The semidihedral group of size 512 is SD_512, which is SD_{2^n} for n=9.\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(f\"Error: Group size {group_size} is not a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # 1. Cyclic subgroups contained within the main cyclic subgroup <r> of order 2^(n-1).\n    # The number of subgroups of a cyclic group C_m is the number of divisors of m, tau(m).\n    # For C_{2^(n-1)}, the number of subgroups is tau(2^(n-1)) = (n-1) + 1 = n.\n    c_r_subgroups = n\n\n    # 2. Cyclic subgroups of order 2 generated by elements of the form sr^i.\n    # These exist for even i, and there are 2^(n-2) such distinct subgroups.\n    order_2_subgroups = 2**(n - 2)\n\n    # 3. Cyclic subgroups of order 4 generated by elements of the form sr^i.\n    # These exist for odd i, and there are 2^(n-3) such distinct subgroups.\n    order_4_subgroups = 2**(n - 3)\n\n    # Total number of subgroups is the sum of these three values.\n    total_subgroups = c_r_subgroups + order_2_subgroups + order_4_subgroups\n\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_size} is denoted as SD_{2^n}, where n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"A power subgroup is a cyclic subgroup.\")\n    print(\"The total number of power subgroups is calculated by summing three components:\")\n    print(f\"1. Cyclic subgroups from the abelian subgroup C_{2**(n-1)}: {c_r_subgroups}\")\n    print(f\"2. Cyclic subgroups of order 2 from other elements: {order_2_subgroups}\")\n    print(f\"3. Cyclic subgroups of order 4 from other elements: {order_4_subgroups}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n    print(f\"Total number of power subgroups = {c_r_subgroups} + {order_2_subgroups} + {order_4_subgroups} = {total_subgroups}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<201>>>"
