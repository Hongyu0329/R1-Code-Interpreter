    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to understand the concept of color gamuts. A color gamut is the complete range of colors that can be represented by a specific color space.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Gamuts:** The ROMM RGB color space has a much wider gamut than the standard sRGB color space used for most displays and the web. This means ROMM RGB can represent more saturated colors, especially in the greens and blues, than sRGB can.\n2.  **Conversion:** To check if a ROMM RGB color can be represented in sRGB, we must perform a color space conversion. This is a precise mathematical process that transforms the coordinates from the source color space (ROMM RGB) to the destination space (sRGB).\n3.  **Check for Out-of-Gamut Colors:** After converting a color to the sRGB space, we check if its R, G, and B values fall within the valid range for sRGB, which is [0.0, 1.0] for each channel in floating-point representation. If any channel has a value less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the color is \"out of gamut\" and cannot be accurately represented in sRGB. An sRGB hex code can only be created for in-gamut colors.\n4.  **Implementation:** I will use a Python script with the `colour-science` library, which is a professional-grade tool for color science applications. The script will perform the following for each color:\n    *   Take the input non-linear ROMM RGB value.\n    *   Linearize it using the official ROMM RGB transfer function.\n    *   Convert the linear ROMM RGB value to the CIE XYZ color space.\n    *   Perform a chromatic adaptation from ROMM RGB's D50 white point to sRGB's D65 white point.\n    *   Convert the adapted CIE XYZ value to a linear sRGB value.\n    *   Check if the resulting linear sRGB values are all within the [0.0, 1.0] range.\n    *   Finally, collect and present the numbers of the colors that are out of gamut.\n\nThis process will accurately determine which of the provided colors lie outside the sRGB gamut. You may need to install the necessary library first by running `pip install colour-science`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport colour\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines which of a given set of ROMM RGB colors\n    cannot be represented in the sRGB color space.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the input colors in the ROMM RGB color space\n    colors_romm = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),      # Pure Blue in ROMM RGB\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),      # Pure Green in ROMM RGB\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1])       # White point\n    }\n\n    # Store the numbers of colors that are out of the sRGB gamut\n    out_of_gamut_colors = []\n\n    print(\"--- Checking ROMM RGB to sRGB Conversion ---\")\n\n    for number, rgb_romm in colors_romm.items():\n        # The colour-science library represents colourspaces with dedicated objects\n        # that contain all necessary information (primaries, whitepoint, matrices, etc.)\n        romm_cs = colour.models.ROMM_RGB_COLOURSPACE\n        srgb_cs = colour.models.sRGB_COLOURSPACE\n\n        # Step 1: Convert non-linear ROMM RGB to linear ROMM RGB\n        rgb_romm_linear = colour.cctf_decoding(rgb_romm, function='ROMM RGB')\n\n        # Step 2: Convert from linear ROMM RGB to CIE XYZ (under ROMM's D50 whitepoint)\n        xyz_d50 = colour.RGB_to_XYZ(\n            rgb_romm_linear, romm_cs.whitepoint, romm_cs.whitepoint, romm_cs.matrix_RGB_to_XYZ\n        )\n\n        # Step 3: Perform chromatic adaptation from D50 (ROMM) to D65 (sRGB)\n        xyz_d65 = colour.chromatic_adaptation(xyz_d50, romm_cs.whitepoint, srgb_cs.whitepoint)\n\n        # Step 4: Convert from CIE XYZ (D65) to linear sRGB\n        # These are the values we must check against the [0, 1] gamut.\n        rgb_srgb_linear = colour.XYZ_to_RGB(\n            xyz_d65, srgb_cs.whitepoint, srgb_cs.whitepoint, srgb_cs.matrix_XYZ_to_RGB\n        )\n        \n        # Step 5: Check if the resulting linear sRGB values are in the [0, 1] gamut\n        is_in_gamut = np.all(rgb_srgb_linear >= -1e-7) and np.all(rgb_srgb_linear <= 1 + 1e-7)\n        # We use a small tolerance for floating point inaccuracies\n\n        print(f\"\\nAnalyzing color {number}: ROMM RGB{tuple(np.round(rgb_romm, 3))}\")\n        print(f\"  -> Converted to linear sRGB: [{rgb_srgb_linear[0]:.4f}, {rgb_srgb_linear[1]:.4f}, {rgb_srgb_linear[2]:.4f}]\")\n\n        if not is_in_gamut:\n            out_of_gamut_colors.append(number)\n            print(\"  -> Result: OUT of sRGB gamut.
