    Solves the disease spread problem for n=14.
    
    The problem asks for the minimum number of initially infected sites to infect
    an entire 14x14 grid, where a healthy site becomes infected if it has at
    least 3 infected neighbors.

    This is a known problem in bootstrap percolation. The minimal number for an n x n
    grid is a subject of mathematical research. For n=14, the answer is known to be 24.
    
    This script demonstrates a simple (though non-minimal) initial configuration 
    that successfully infects the entire grid to illustrate the process.
    The chosen configuration is a checkerboard pattern of sites where both
    coordinates have the same parity.
