    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic calculation in statistical field theory and the renormalization group.\n\nHere is my plan to derive the expression:\n1.  We'll start with the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling `u` in `ϕ⁴` theory. This function, `β(u)`, describes how the coupling `u` changes with the energy scale. The theory is analyzed near four dimensions, specifically in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, where `ϵ` is a small parameter.\n2.  A fixed point `u*` is a special value of the coupling where `β(u*) = 0`. At a fixed point, the theory becomes scale-invariant.\n3.  We will set the beta function to zero and solve the resulting algebraic equation for `u*`. This will yield a non-trivial solution known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which is proportional to `ϵ`.\n4.  The Python script below will walk through these mathematical steps and print the final derived expression for `u*`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the derivation:\n```python\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and prints the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher\n    fixed point coupling u* in ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: State the one-loop beta function\n    print(\"Step 1: The starting point is the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling 'u'\")\n    print(\"in ϕ⁴ theory, dimensionally regularized in d = 4 - ε dimensions.\")\n    print(\"The beta function describes how the coupling changes with energy scale.\")\n    print(\"To leading order in u and ε, it is given by:\")\n    print(\"β(u) = -ε·u + (3 / (16·π²))·u²\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Define the fixed point condition\n    print(\"Step 2: A fixed point, denoted u*, is a point where the coupling ceases to change,\")\n    print(\"meaning the beta function is zero.
