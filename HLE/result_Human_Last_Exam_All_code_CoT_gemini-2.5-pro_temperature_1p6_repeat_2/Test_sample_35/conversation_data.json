    "To determine the optimal hand to shove all-in with in this poker scenario, we need to analyze the situation and consult established poker strategy, often represented by shove/fold charts.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Scenario:** The key factors are stack size (16 big blinds), position (UTG+1, an early position), and the game state (near the money bubble). The bubble situation means opponents are likely to play cautiously to avoid elimination, which gives our all-in shove more \"fold equity\" (a higher chance they will fold).\n2.  **Establish a Shoving Range:** Based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) play for this scenario, a player should shove a specific range of hands. A standard range for 16bb from UTG+1 is quite tight but includes strong pairs, strong aces, and some strong suited connectors/gappers. A typical range might be `77+, A9s+, KTs+, QJs, AJo+, KQo`.\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:** We will check each hand provided in the answer choices against this standard shoving range.\n4.  **Select the Best Option:** While multiple hands might fall within the correct shoving range, the question asks what hand you *should* jam. We will select the strongest hand that provides the best combination of equity when called and fold equity due to its blocker effects. `AKo` (Ace-King offsuit) is a premium hand that excels in both areas, making it the most robust and profitable shove among the choices.\n\nThe python code below will simulate this decision process by defining the shoving range and checking each option against it.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_poker_shove_scenario():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker scenario to determine the best hand to shove all-in.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
