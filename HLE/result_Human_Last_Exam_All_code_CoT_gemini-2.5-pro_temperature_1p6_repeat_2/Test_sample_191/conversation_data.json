    "The protein you are referring to is **Complement component 3 (C3)**.\n\nHere is the biological mechanism:\n\n1.  **Activation and Breakdown:** The complement system, a part of the innate immune system, can be activated near amyloid plaques. This activation leads to the cleavage (breakdown) of the C3 protein.\n2.  **Opsonization:** When C3 is broken down, its fragments, particularly **iC3b** and **C3b**, become covalently attached to the surface of the amyloid deposits. This process of tagging a target for destruction is called opsonization.\n3.  **Macrophage Recognition:** Macrophages (and microglia in the brain) have specific receptors on their surface, such as Complement Receptor 3 (CR3), that recognize and bind to these C3 fragments (like iC3b) coating the amyloid.\n4.  **Engulfment:** The binding of the macrophage's receptors to the C3-tagged amyloid triggers the process of phagocytosis, where the macrophage engulfs and breaks down the amyloid material.\n\nTherefore, the breakdown of C3 is a critical step that flags amyloid for removal by macrophages.\n\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"
