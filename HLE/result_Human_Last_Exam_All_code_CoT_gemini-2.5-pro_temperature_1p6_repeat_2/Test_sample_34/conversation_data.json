    "To determine the worst suited jack to open from the button, we need to consult a Game Theory Optimal (GTO) pre-flop opening range chart for a 100BB rake-free cash game.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Position and Action**: The button is the latest position to act pre-flop (before the blinds), allowing for the widest and most profitable opening range. The goal is often to steal the blinds.\n2.  **Consult GTO Ranges**: In a standard 100BB GTO model, the button's raising range is very wide, often including 40-50% of all possible hands.\n3.  **Identify Suited Jacks**: We will look at all suited jack combinations: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n4.  **Find the Cutoff**: Within this list, we need to find the weakest hand that is still considered a standard open-raise. A GTO strategy includes all hands that are profitable to raise. In a rake-free game, even marginally profitable hands are included.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Based on standard GTO solvers, all suited jacks, from JTs down to J2s, are considered profitable opens from the button. The hand with the lowest kicker, J2s, has the lowest expected value of the group while still being a profitable open. Therefore, it is the \"worst\" suited jack that you should still open.\n\nThe following Python code will define the components of this hand and print the final abbreviated hand name.\n\n```python\n# The hand in question is a suited Jack.\n# We are looking for the weakest one that is still a standard open-raise from the button.\n# According to GTO (Game Theory Optimal) charts for a 100BB rake-free cash game,\n# the button's opening range is very wide and includes all suited Jacks.\n\n# The highest card is a Jack.\nhigh_card = \"J\"\n\n# The lowest possible kicker that makes the hand a profitable open-raise is a 2.\nlow_card = \"2\"\n\n# The \"s\" indicates that the two cards are of the same suit.\nsuit_info = \"s\"\n\n# Combining these components gives us the abbreviated hand name.\nworst_suited_jack_to_open = high_card + low_card + suit_info\n\nprint(\"The worst suited jack you should open from the button is:\")\nprint(worst_suited_jack_to_open)\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
