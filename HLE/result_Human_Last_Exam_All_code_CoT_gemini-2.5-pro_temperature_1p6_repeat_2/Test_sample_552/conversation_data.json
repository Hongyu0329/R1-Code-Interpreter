    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the specific 1905 paper by Albert Einstein that discusses Brownian motion. The paper is titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat).\n2.  Next, I will consult my knowledge base to find the citations within this paper.\n3.  I will specifically look for references to \"lectures\" as requested by your question.\n4.  Historical records and analyses of this paper show that Einstein cited the work of the Austrian physicist who was a pioneer in statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of gases.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that declares this person's name as a variable and prints it in a clear, formatted string to answer your question.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n# Based on historical analysis of the paper, Einstein's work on the kinetic theory of heat\n# drew upon the foundational contributions of an Austrian physicist.\n# While Einstein hadn't read all of his papers, he was familiar with his ideas, citing his lectures\n# on the kinetic theory of gases.\n\ncited_scientist = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\nprint(f\"In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of: {cited_scientist}\")\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Whose lectures did Albert Einstein cite in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
