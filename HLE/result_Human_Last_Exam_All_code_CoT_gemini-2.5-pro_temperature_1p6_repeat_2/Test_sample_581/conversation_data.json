    "To determine the best-known lower bound for the size of cap sets in dimension 8, we will use a constructive method known as the product construction.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Problem**: A cap set is a collection of points in a vector space over a field of 3 elements, $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$, such that no three points lie on a line. The goal is to find the maximum size of such a set, denoted $r_3(n)$. Finding a \"lower bound\" means finding a specific construction of a cap set, the size of which proves that $r_3(n)$ is at least that large.\n\n2.  **Use the Product Construction**: A powerful method to find lower bounds is the product construction. If we have a cap set of size $S_1$ in dimension $n_1$ and another of size $S_2$ in dimension $n_2$, we can construct a cap set of size $S_1 \\times S_2$ in dimension $n_1 + n_2$. This gives us the inequality: $r_3(n_1 + n_2) \\ge r_3(n_1) \\times r_3(n_2)$.\n\n3.  **Apply to Dimension 8**: We want a lower bound for $r_3(8)$. We can achieve this by combining known records from smaller dimensions that sum to 8. A very effective combination is using dimensions 6 and 2 (since $6+2=8$).\n\n4.  **State Known Values**:\n    *   For dimension 2, the exact maximum size is known: $r_3(2) = 4$.\n    *   For dimension 6, the current record for the lower bound is $r_3(6) \\ge 124$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Bound**: By applying the product construction, we can calculate a strong lower bound for dimension 8: $r_3(8) \\ge r_3(6) \\times r_3(2) \\ge 124 \\times 4 = 496$. This result of 496 is, in fact, the current best-known lower bound for dimension 8.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and display the resulting equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cap_set_lower_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8\n    using the product construction method with known values for smaller dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A cap set is a set of points in (Z/3Z)^n with no three collinear points.\n    # The size of the largest possible cap set in dimension n is denoted r_3(n).\n    \n    # We use the product construction rule: r_3(n1 + n2) >= r_3(n1) * r_3(n2).\n    # To find the lower bound for r_3(8), we use the best records for n1=6 and n2=2.\n    \n    # For dimension 2, the maximum size is known exactly.\n    n2 = 2\n    size_n2 = 4\n    \n    # For dimension 6, the best known lower bound is 124, established by N.
