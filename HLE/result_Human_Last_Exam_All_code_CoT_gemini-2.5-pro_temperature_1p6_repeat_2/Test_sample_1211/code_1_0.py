    Analyzes the statements about the relative safety of Subutex and Suboxone.

    The analysis identifies the statements supported by evidence:
    - Statement II: Correct. Subutex is preferred for certain populations like pregnant women.
    - Statement III: Correct. When taken as prescribed orally/sublingually, their safety is similar due to the poor bioavailability of naloxone.
    - Statement V: This statement contains a likely typo ("lack of naloxone"). If corrected to "presence of naloxone," it provides an accurate summary that safety is route-dependent and Suboxone is designed to be safer against injection misuse. This interpretation is the most logical.
    - Statements I and IV are considered incorrect. Statement I presents a confusing and non-standard view of safety, while Statement IV falsely claims a lack of knowledge on the topic.

    The correct statements are therefore II, III, and V.

    print("Statement III is correct because when taken as prescribed (sublingually), the naloxone in Suboxone is poorly absorbed and has minimal effect, making the safety profiles of the two medications very similar.")
    print("Statement V is correct, assuming a likely typo is corrected (from 'lack of' to 'presence of' naloxone). The relative safety is dependent on the route of administration; Suboxone is designed to be safer by deterring injection, while both are similarly safe with prescribed oral use.")
