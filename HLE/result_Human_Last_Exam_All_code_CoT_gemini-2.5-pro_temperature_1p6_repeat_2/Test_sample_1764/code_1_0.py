# The problem is to find the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings
# of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B.
# We can choose X and B to minimize this number.

# Let's choose the simplest possible Banach space: the trivial space B = {0}.
# This space is a valid Banach space, and its cardinality is 1.

# An isometric embedding f: X -> B must satisfy d(x, y) = ||f(x) - f(y)||.
# For B = {0}, the right side is always ||0 - 0|| = 0.
# So, we need a space X where d(x, y) = 0 for all x, y in X.
# In a metric space, d(x, y) = 0 if and only if x = y.
# This means X must be a one-point space, let's say X = {x_0}.

# Now we count the number of isometric embeddings from X = {x_0} to B = {0}.
# There is only one possible function: f(x_0) = 0.
# Let's check if it's an isometric embedding.
# The defining equation is d(x_0, x_0) = ||f(x_0) - f(x_0)||.
distance_in_X = 0
distance_in_B = 0 # This represents ||0 - 0||

# Since distance_in_X equals distance_in_B, the mapping is isometric.
# There is only this single mapping, so the number of embeddings is 1.
# Since the number must be at least 1, this is the minimum possible number.
final_answer = 1

# The final equation is simply the result of our reasoning.
# Number of embeddings for X={x_0} and B={0} is 1.
