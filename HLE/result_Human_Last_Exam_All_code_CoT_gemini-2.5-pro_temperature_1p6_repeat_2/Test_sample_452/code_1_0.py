# The problem asks for the constant 'b' in the asymptotic formula for the expected
# cover time of a random walk on a random n-vertex tree, C(n) ~ b * n^(3/2).
# As explained in the reasoning above, we consider C(n) to be the standard cover
# time (not the cover-and-return time) to match the n^(3/2) asymptotic behavior.
#
# According to established results in probability theory (conjectured by Aldous and later proved),
# this constant 'b' is known to be the square root of (2 * pi).

# Define the numbers in the formula for b.
number_2 = 2
pi_constant = math.pi

# Calculate b
b_squared = number_2 * pi_constant
b = math.sqrt(b_squared)
