# The task is to find the number of isomorphism classes of automorphism groups
# for compact, connected Riemann surfaces of genus g=2, 3, and 4.
# This is a known result from the mathematical theory of Riemann surfaces.
# The numbers are based on classifications published in mathematical literature.

# For genus g=2, there are 12 such group classes.
num_groups_g2 = 12

# For genus g=3, there are 36 such group classes.
num_groups_g3 = 36

# For genus g=4, there are 23 such group classes.
num_groups_g4 = 23

# We will format the result as a list as requested.
result = [num_groups_g2, num_groups_g3, num_groups_g4]

# Print the final list.
