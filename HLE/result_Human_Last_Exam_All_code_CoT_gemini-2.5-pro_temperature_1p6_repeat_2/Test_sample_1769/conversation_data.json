    "To determine what the Modern English word for \"sister\" would be without Norse influence, we need to trace the evolution of the original Old English word for \"sister\".\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the current word's origin:** The modern word \"sister\" was borrowed from the Old Norse word \"systir\" during the Viking Age.\n2.  **Find the native Old English word:** The original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word for \"sister\" was \"sweoster\".\n3.  **Trace the likely phonetic evolution:** We will look at how other Old English words with similar sounds evolved into Modern English. The \"sweo-\" combination in \"sweoster\" would have undergone natural sound changes. In many cases, the `w` sound was lost, and the `eo` vowel sound often simplified to `u`.\n4.  **Examine historical evidence:** The form \"suster\" is actually found in Middle English texts and survived in some dialects for centuries. This provides strong evidence that this was the natural English evolution of the word before it was largely replaced by the Norse-derived \"sister\".\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on this linguistic path, the word \"suster\" is the most probable Modern English equivalent of the Old English \"sweoster\".\n\nI will now generate a Python script to print this explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the linguistic reasoning to determine what the word for \"sister\"\n    would be in Modern English without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: State the origin of the current word\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n    origin = \"Old Norse 'systir'\"\n    print(f\"The current English word '{current_word}' comes from the {origin}.\")\n    print(\"This was adopted during the period of Norse (Viking) invasions and settlement in England.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the original Old English word\n    old_english_word = \"sweoster\"\n    print(f\"The native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for sister was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Explain the likely linguistic evolution\n    hypothetical_word = \"suster\"\n    print(\"Without the Norse influence, 'sweoster' would have evolved naturally through sound changes:\")\n    print(\"1.
