    "In a quantum Prisoner's Dilemma game, the introduction of entanglement and quantum strategies can resolve the classical dilemma, leading to a more optimal equilibrium point. Here is the step-by-step plan to determine this equilibrium:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Quantum Game Setup**: The game uses the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. We assume the players' initial state is maximally entangled. This entanglement is the key that allows for outcomes not possible in the classical version of the game.\n2.  **Player Strategies**: The players can choose from their classical strategies, Cooperate (C) and Defect (D), but also from a new set of quantum strategies. There is a particularly effective quantum strategy, let's call it `Q`.\n3.  **New Equilibrium**: With maximal entanglement, the classical Nash Equilibrium of (Defect, Defect) with payoff (1, 1) is no longer stable. A new, unique Nash Equilibrium emerges where both players choose the quantum strategy `Q`. This strategy pair is denoted as `(Q, Q)`.\n4.  **Outcome of (Q, Q)**: A crucial feature of the `(Q, Q)` strategy pair is that it deterministically results in the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome. This means the probability of both players cooperating is 1, and all other outcomes have a probability of 0.\n    *   Probability (Cooperate, Cooperate), `P_CC` = 1\n    *   Probability (Cooperate, Defect), `P_CD` = 0\n    *   Probability (Defect, Cooperate), `P_DC` = 0\n    *   Probability (Defect, Defect), `P_DD` = 0\n5.  **Calculate Equilibrium Payoff**: Using these probabilities and the given payoff matrix values (R=5 for mutual cooperation, S=0 for being the sucker, T=7 for temptation, and P=1 for mutual defection), we will calculate the final payoff for each player at this `(Q, Q)` equilibrium. The script below will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Payoff values from the matrix\n# R is the Reward for mutual cooperation (C,C)\n# S is the Sucker's payoff for cooperating while the other defects (C,D)\n# T is the Temptation to defect while the other cooperates (D,C)\n# P is the Punishment for mutual defection (D,D)\nR = 5\nS = 0\nT = 7\nP = 1\n\n# In the quantum version with maximal entanglement, a new Nash Equilibrium (Q,Q) emerges.\n# When both players play the quantum strategy Q, the probability of the (Cooperate, Cooperate)\n# outcome becomes 1, and all other outcomes have a probability of 0.\nP_CC = 1.0\nP_CD = 0.0\nP_DC = 0.0\nP_DD = 0.0\n\n# Calculate the payoffs for each player (Alice and Bob)\n# Alice's payoff: R*P_CC + S*P_CD + T*P_DC + P*P_DD\n# Bob's payoff:   R*P_CC + T*P_CD + S*P_DC + P*P_DD\nalice_payoff = R * P_CC + S * P_CD + T * P_DC + P * P_DD\nbob_payoff = R * P_CC + T * P_CD + S * P_DC + P * P_DD\n\n# The equilibrium point is the pair of payoffs (Alice's Payoff, Bob's Payoff)\nprint(\"The quantum equilibrium resolves the dilemma, leading to the optimal outcome.\")\nprint(\"The calculation for the equilibrium point is as follows:\")\n\n# Print the equation for Alice's payoff\nprint(f\"Alice's Payoff = ({R} * {P_CC}) + ({S} * {P_CD}) + ({T} * {P_DC}) + ({P} * {P_DD}) = {alice_payoff}\")\n\n# Print the equation for Bob's payoff\nprint(f\"Bob's Payoff   = ({R} * {P_CC}) + ({T} * {P_CD}) + ({S} * {P_DC}) + ({P} * {P_DD}) = {bob_payoff}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe equilibrium point is ({int(alice_payoff)}, {int(bob_payoff)}).\")\n\n```\n<<<(5, 5)>>>"
