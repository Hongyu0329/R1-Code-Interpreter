# Step 1: Define the numerator and denominator of the constant factor in the relationship.
# Based on the theory of non-homogeneous binary quadratic forms, for a real quadratic
# field (derived from a squarefree natural number N), the Euclidean minimum (which we
# interpret as k_k,inf) is bounded above by sqrt(d_K) / 4.
# The covolume V is defined as sqrt(d_K).
# Therefore, the relationship is k_k,inf <= V / 4.
# The constant factor is 1/4.

numerator = 1
denominator = 4

# Step 2: Print the explanation and the final equation.
# The user requested that we output each number in the final equation.

# Step 3: Calculate the numerical value of the constant for the final answer.
