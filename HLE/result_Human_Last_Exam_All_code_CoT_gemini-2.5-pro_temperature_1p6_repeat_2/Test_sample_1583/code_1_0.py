x = 27

# Step 2: Identify the tram route number Y.
# Tram route number 2 used to pass through Kastryƒçnickaja st. before the line was removed.
y = 2

# Step 3: Calculate X to the power of Y.
result = math.pow(x, y)

# Print the final equation with the numbers and the result.
print(f"{x} ^ {y} = {int(result)}")
