    print("A. Mitotic Recombination:")
    print("   - Explanation: An exchange between homologous chromosomes during mitosis. This can result in daughter cells that receive two identical copies of a chromosome arm.")

    print("B. A deletion of a chromosomal region:")

    print("   - Result: This causes LOH, but it reduces the gene copy number from two to one. This is a copy number LOSS, not copy-neutral.")

    print("   - Explanation: A condition where a cell has two homologous chromosomes inherited from a single parent. In tumorigenesis, this is 'acquired UPD', often occurring when a cell loses one chromosome and then duplicates the remaining one.")
    print("   - Result: The cell has two identical chromosomes. This creates homozygosity (LOH) while maintaining the correct chromosome number (two). This is the exact definition of the state of copy-neutral LOH.")

    print("Both Mitotic Recombination (A) and Uniparental Disomy (D) are closely related to cnLOH.")
