# Plan:
# 1. Define the harmonic context for the end of the song's A-section in the key of A minor.
# 2. Identify the specific melodic note in that context.
# 3. Define the harmonic context for the start of the bridge (B-section) in the key of A minor.
# 4. Identify how the previously identified note is re-interpreted in the new context.
# 5. Conclude the note's name and print the final "equation" of the notes.

# Step 1 & 2: Analyze the end of the A-section ("...what you are") in A minor.
# The original key is Ab Major. When transposing to A minor (relative major C),
# the final chords of the A section modulate to Emaj7.
end_of_A_section_chord = "Emaj7"
# The notes in an Emaj7 chord are E, G#, B, D#.
# The melody lands on the major third, which defines the chord's quality.
melodic_note_in_A_section = "G sharp"
print(f"At the end of the first phrase, the harmony is {end_of_A_section_chord}.")
print(f"The important melodic note here is the major third of the chord: {melodic_note_in_A_section}.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3 & 4: Analyze the start of the Bridge ("Some day...") in A minor.
# The bridge in the original key starts on C#m7. Transposing this to the key of A minor
# results in the bridge starting on an Fm7 chord.
start_of_bridge_chord = "Fm7"
# The notes in an Fm7 chord are F, Ab, C, Eb.
# The same pitch as G# must now be spelled to fit the new harmony. In an F minor context,
# this note is the minor third, written as A-flat.
respelled_note_in_bridge = "A-flat"
print(f"At the start of the next phrase, the harmony changes to {start_of_bridge_chord}.")
print(f"The same pitch, G-sharp, is now re-contextualized as the minor third of the new chord.")
print(f"Its new name is: {respelled_note_in_bridge}.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 5: Conclude and print the final statement.
# The note G-sharp is enharmonically respelled as A-flat.
print("Conclusion: The melodic note that undergoes enharmonic respelling is G-sharp.")
print("\nThe final equation showing the enharmonic respelling is:")
print(f"{melodic_note_in_A_section} = {respelled_note_in_bridge}")
