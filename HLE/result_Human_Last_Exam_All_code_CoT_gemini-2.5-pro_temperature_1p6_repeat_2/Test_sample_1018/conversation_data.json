    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we need to use a key theorem from the theory of simplicial volume concerning product manifolds. The calculation depends on a property of the fundamental groups of the surfaces, known as amenability.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the manifolds:** We are given a product of two closed, oriented surfaces, $M = M_1 \\times M_2$, where $M_1 = \\Sigma_{31}$ (genus $g_1 = 31$) and $M_2 = \\Sigma_{17}$ (genus $g_2 = 17$).\n2.  **Analyze the fundamental groups:** The fundamental group of a surface $\\Sigma_g$ is non-amenable if its genus $g \\ge 2$. Otherwise, for $g=0$ or $g=1$, the group is amenable.\n3.  **Apply Gromov's Vanishing Theorem:** A major theorem by Gromov states that the simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented manifolds, $\\|M_1 \\times M_2\\|$, is zero if the fundamental group of at least one of the factors is non-amenable.\n4.  **Check the condition:** For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g_1 = 31$, which is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, its fundamental group, $\\pi_1(\\Sigma_{31})$, is non-amenable.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the condition of Gromov's theorem is met, the simplicial volume of the product $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ must be zero.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to derive the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_simplicial_volume_of_product(g1, g2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces Σ_g1 x Σ_g2.\n\n    The computation relies on properties of the fundamental groups of the surfaces.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(f\"Task: Compute the simplicial volume of the product manifold Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the fundamental groups of the factor surfaces.\")\n    print(f\"The first surface is Σ_{g1} with genus g1 = {g1}.\")\n    print(f\"The second surface is Σ_{g2} with genus g2 = {g2}.\")\n    \n    # A key property of the fundamental group of a surface Σ_g is its amenability.\n    # - If g >= 2, the group π₁(Σ_g) is non-amenable.\n    # - If g < 2 (i.e., g=0 or g=1), the group π₁(Σ_g) is amenable.\n\n    # We apply a theorem by Gromov regarding the simplicial volume of product manifolds.\n    # The theorem states: ||M₁ × M₂|| = 0 if the fundamental group of M₁ or M₂ is non-amenable.\n\n    if g1 >= 2 or g2 >= 2:\n        print(\"\\nStep 2: Check the condition for Gromov's Vanishing Theorem.\")\n        print(f\"The condition is that at least one genus must be 2 or greater.\")\n        print(f\"In this case, g1 = {g1} >= 2, so the condition is met.\")\n        print(\"This means the fundamental group π₁(Σ_{g1}) is non-amenable.\")\n        \n        print(\"\\nStep 3: Apply the theorem and state the result.\")\n        print(\"Because one of the factors has a non-amenable fundamental group, the simplicial\")\n        print(\"volume of the product manifold is zero.\")\n        \n        result = 0\n        print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n        print(f\"||Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}|| = {result}\")\n\n    else: # This block handles cases where both g1 < 2 and g2 < 2\n        print(\"\\nStep 2: Check the condition for Gromov's Vanishing Theorem.\")\n        print(f\"The condition that a genus is >= 2 is not met (g1={g1}, g2={g2}).\")\n        print(\"In this case, both fundamental groups π₁(Σ_{g1}) and π₁(Σ_{g2}) are amenable.\")\n        \n        print(\"\\nStep 3: Apply the theorem for amenable groups and state the result.\")\n        print(\"The fundamental group of the product, π₁(Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}), is therefore also amenable.\")\n        print(\"A different theorem states that any manifold with an amenable fundamental group\")\n        print(\"has a simplicial volume of zero.\")\n\n        result = 0\n        print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n        print(f\"||Σ_{g1} x Σ_{g2}|| = {result}\")\n\n# Set the genera from the problem\ngenus1 = 31\ngenus2 = 17\n\ncompute_simplicial_volume_of_product(genus1, genus2)\n\n```\n<<<0>>>"
