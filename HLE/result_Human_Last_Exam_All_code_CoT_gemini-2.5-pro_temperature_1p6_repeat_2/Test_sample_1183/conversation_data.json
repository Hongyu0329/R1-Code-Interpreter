    "To determine the symmetry group of the molecule, I will use a computational approach. First, I will use the RDKit library to interpret the provided SMILES string and generate a 3D model of the molecule. This process includes adding hydrogen atoms and then using a molecular mechanics force field (MMFF) to find a stable, low-energy 3D conformation. Next, I will pass this molecular structure to the PySCF library, a powerful tool for quantum chemistry calculations. PySCF has a built-in function to analyze the geometry of a molecule and determine its point group symmetry. The script will then print the identified point group.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport subprocess\n\n# The user needs to have rdkit and pyscf installed.\n# This helper function will try to install them if they are not found.\ndef install_packages():\n    \"\"\"Checks for and installs required packages.\"\"\"\n    required_packages = ['rdkit', 'pyscf']\n    for package in required_packages:\n        try:\n            __import__(package)\n        except ImportError:\n            print(f\"Installing {package}, please wait...\")\n            try:\n                subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, \"-m\", \"pip\", \"install\", package, \"--quiet\"])\n            except subprocess.CalledProcessError:\n                print(f\"ERROR: Could not install {package}.
