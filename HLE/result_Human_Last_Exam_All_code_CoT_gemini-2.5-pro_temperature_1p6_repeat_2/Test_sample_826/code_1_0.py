    Analyzes the algebraic properties of graphs with union and tensor product.
    
    A semi-ring (S, +, *) requires:
    1. (S, +) to be a commutative monoid (associative, commutative, has an identity '0').
    2. (S, *) to be a monoid (associative, has an identity '1').
    3. * must distribute over +.
    A semi-ring is commutative if * is commutative.
    A semi-ring is a ring if (S, +) is an abelian group (i.e., every element has an additive inverse).

    We will investigate the structure (G, U, x) where G is the class of simple graphs,
    U is disjoint union (+), and x is the tensor product (*).
