# This is a thinking process to arrive at the solution.
# The user's question requires identifying the correct statements about the influence
# of Wellington's military service in India on his later career and British imperial practices.

# 1. Evaluate Statement 1: "Wellington's mobile commissariat system ... was later successfully adapted for the Peninsular Campaign..."
# This is historically accurate. Wellington's experiences with logistics in India, where he had to rely on local procurement and mobile supply lines (using bullocks), were foundational to his successful logistical system in the Peninsular War, which contrasted sharply with the failing systems of his predecessors and opponents. This statement is CORRECT.

# 2. Evaluate Statement 2: "...intelligence using local informants that became the model for British colonial intelligence gathering ... but was never successfully implemented in European theaters."
# The first part is true. The second part is false. Wellington's intelligence network in the Peninsula, using local Spanish and Portuguese partisans and observers, was one of his greatest assets and a key reason for his victories. Therefore, the statement as a whole is INCORRECT.

# 3. Evaluate Statement 3: "The organizational structure ... in the Deccan region was later standardized across the British Army in 1815..."
# This is an overstatement and thus incorrect. While lessons were learned, the British Army's post-1815 organization was a complex evolution based on the Napoleonic Wars as a whole, not a direct standardization of a single colonial model. The regimental system remained the core. This is INCORRECT.

# 4. Evaluate Statement 4: "...his 1829 establishment of the Military Seminary at Sandhurst..."
# This contains a factual error. The Royal Military College, Sandhurst, was founded much earlier (warrant in 1802). The East India Company had its own seminary at Addiscombe. Therefore, the statement is INCORRECT.

# 5. Evaluate Statement 5: "The logistical systems developed during the Mysore campaigns had no significant impact on later British colonial administration..."
# This is a strong negative claim and is historically false. The principles of mobile logistics were highly relevant and adapted for other colonial campaigns (e.g., in Burma, Africa). This is INCORRECT.

# 6. Evaluate Statement 6: "Wellington's methods of integrating local auxiliary forces ... became standard practice in British colonial expansion..."
# This is accurate. The use of sepoy regiments in India under British officers was a model that was replicated across the empire (e.g., King's African Rifles, etc.). It was a cornerstone of British imperial rule and expansion. This statement is CORRECT.

# 7. Evaluate Statement 7: "The Duke's reforms of the commissariat during the Peninsular War were entirely based on European military theory..."
# This is false and contradicts statement 1. His reforms were heavily influenced by his practical experience in India, which taught him the limitations of traditional European supply systems in difficult terrain. This is INCORRECT.

# 8. Evaluate Statement 8: "Wellington's system of deploying flying columns, developed in India, was successfully adapted for use in both the Peninsular War and later colonial campaigns in Burma..."
# This is accurate. The tactic of using fast-moving, self-sufficient columns was perfected against the Marathas and was used in the Peninsula for raids and rapid deployments. It was also a key tactic in the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824-1826). This statement is CORRECT.

# 9. Evaluate Statement 9: "The East India Company's administrative reforms of 1813 were directly influenced by Wellington's military organizational principles..."
# The link is too tenuous and direct causation is not supported by mainstream historiography. The 1813 Charter Act was primarily about the Company's trading monopoly, finances, and governance, not an implementation of military command structures into civil administration. This is INCORRECT.

# 10. Evaluate Statement 10: "Wellington's approach to civilian administration during wartime... had no bearing on his later governance..."
# This is false. In India, he learned to manage civilian populations, prevent looting, and ensure order to maintain his supply lines and security. He applied these exact principles in Spain and Portugal, famously issuing strict orders against plunder to maintain the goodwill of the locals. This is INCORRECT.

# Final Compilation:
# The correct statements are 1, 6, and 8.
# The numbers should be sorted in ascending order.
correct_options = [1, 6, 8]
correct_options.sort()
