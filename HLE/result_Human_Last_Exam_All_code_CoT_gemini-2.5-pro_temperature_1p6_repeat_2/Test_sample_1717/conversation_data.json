    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Base Stats:** First, I'll find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode from the game's data.\n2.  **Find the Scaling Formula:** Next, I'll determine the formula Terraria uses to scale boss health based on the number of players in the game.\n3.  **Analyze the Limit:** The question asks for the health with an \"infinite number of players.\" I will analyze what happens to the health value as the number of players in the formula approaches infinity.\n4.  **Consider Technical Limitations:** Game variables are stored in specific data types which have maximum values. I will identify the data type used for NPC health in Terraria's source code and find its maximum possible value, as this creates a hard cap on the boss's health.\n5.  **Final Calculation and Code:** I will write a Python script that presents these values, explains the calculation, and prints the final theoretical maximum health.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_terraria_health_limit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define base stats for Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode\n    base_health_expert = 3640\n    # Step 2: Define the health scaling factor per player after the first\n    health_increase_per_player = 0.35  # 35% increase\n\n    # Explain the health scaling formula\n    print(\"In Terraria's Expert Mode, a boss's health scales with the number of players.\")\n    print(\"The formula is: Total Health = BaseHealth * (1 + HealthIncreasePerPlayer * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\")\n    print(\"\\nFor the Eye of Cthulhu, the numbers in this equation are:\")\n    print(f\"BaseHealth = {base_health_expert}\")\n    print(f\"HealthIncreasePerPlayer = {health_increase_per_player}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the formula for an infinite number of players\n    print(\"\\nAs the 'NumberOfPlayers' (n) in the equation approaches infinity, the calculated Total Health also approaches infinity.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Explain the technical limitation from the game's code\n    print(\"\\nHowever, the game's code stores NPC health in a 32-bit signed integer data type.\")\n    print(\"This data type has a hard-coded maximum value, which acts as a ceiling for any in-game stat.\")\n\n    # In Python, we can get this value, but for clarity, we will define it directly.\n    # On a 64-bit system, sys.maxsize is for 64-bit integers.\n    # The C# 'int' type in Terraria is a 32-bit signed integer.\n    max_int_32 = 2147483647\n\n    # Step 5: State the final theoretical maximum health\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, no matter how many players are present, the Eye of Cthulhu's health cannot exceed this limit.\")\n    print(f\"The theoretical maximum health is {max_int_32}.\")\n\nsolve_terraria_health_limit()\n<<<2147483647>>>\n```"
