    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function, which describes the correlation between neutron detection events at different positions and times, is a fundamental quantity in reactor noise analysis. In the frequency and wave-vector domain, this transform represents how the power of the neutron population fluctuations is distributed over different frequencies and spatial modes. In the nuclear criticality community, this quantity is commonly known as the **spatiotemporal Power Spectral Density (PSD) of neutron noise**.\n\nHere is a plan to provide a Python script that calculates a related and central quantity: the Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD) for a simple point-reactor model. The APSD is proportional to the magnitude squared of the reactor transfer function, `|G(ω)|²`. The script will:\n1.  Define typical physical parameters for a nuclear reactor (prompt neutron generation time, delayed neutron fraction and decay constant, and reactivity).\n2.  Define an angular frequency `ω` at which to evaluate the function.\n3.  Implement the formula for the reactor transfer function `G(ω)` based on the one-group point kinetics equations.\n4.  Calculate the magnitude squared `|G(ω)|²`.\n5.  Print out each step of the calculation, showing the parameters and intermediate values, to demonstrate how the final result is obtained.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_psd_component():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the magnitude squared of the point reactor transfer function,\n    which is proportional to the Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD) of neutron noise.\n\n    The reactor transfer function G(ω) for a one-group delayed neutron model is:\n    G(ω) = 1 / (i*ω*Λ + i*ω*β / (i*ω + λ) - ρ)\n    where:\n    - ω: angular frequency\n    - Λ: prompt neutron generation time\n    - β: effective delayed neutron fraction\n    - λ: effective delayed neutron precursor decay constant\n    - ρ: reactivity\n    - i: imaginary unit\n\n    The script calculates |G(ω)|² for a given set of parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
