# Step 1: Define the problem parameters based on the problem description.
# The height 'h' is given as 350 * g meters.
h_factor = 350

# Step 2: State the derived acceleration of the raindrop.
# Through analysis of the forces and mass accumulation, the raindrop's
# acceleration 'a' is found to be a constant fraction of gravity 'g'.
# The derivation involves:
#   1. Equation of motion: m*g = d(m*v)/dt
#   2. Mass accumulation rate: dm/dt = Rho * pi * r^2 * v
#   3. Mass of spherical raindrop: m = rho * (4/3) * pi * r^3
# Combining these equations shows that the densities (rho, Rho) and other
# terms cancel out, leading to a constant acceleration.
#
# The result of the derivation is: a = g / 7
acceleration_denominator = 7

# Step 3: Use the kinematic equation to find the time of fall.
# The distance 'h' an object falls from rest under constant acceleration 'a'
# is given by: h = (1/2) * a * t^2
# We can solve this equation for the time 't':
# t = sqrt(2 * h / a)

# Step 4: Substitute the specific values for 'h' and 'a' into the equation for 't'.
# We are given h = 350 * g and we derived a = g / 7.
#
# t = sqrt( (2 * (350 * g)) / (g / 7) )
# The 'g' term cancels from the numerator and denominator:
# t = sqrt( 2 * 350 * 7 )

# Perform the final calculation.
time_squared = 2 * h_factor * acceleration_denominator
time = math.sqrt(time_squared)

# Step 5: Print the steps of the final calculation and the result.
