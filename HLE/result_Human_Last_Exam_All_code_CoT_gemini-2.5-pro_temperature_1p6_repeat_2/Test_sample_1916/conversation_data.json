    "This is an interesting problem that sits at the intersection of abstract algebra and computer science. I will solve it by first translating the abstract mathematical concept into a concrete computational problem, and then writing a Python script to find the solution by exhaustive search.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Translate the Problem**: The user is asking about a specific type of mathematical structure, a \"category\". A category with one object and 3 morphisms is mathematically equivalent to a \"monoid\" of size 3. A monoid is a set of elements with an associative operation (like multiplication) and an identity element. The problem, therefore, is to find how many non-isomorphic monoids of size 3 exist.\n\n2.  **Define the Search Space**: Let's name the 3 morphisms (our monoid elements) `{id, a, b}`, where `id` is the identity morphism. The structure of the category is completely defined by the composition table of these elements. Since the `id` element's behavior is fixed (`id` composed with any morphism `x` is just `x`), we only need to define the 4 compositions involving the non-identity elements: `a∘a`, `a∘b`, `b∘a`, and `b∘b`. Each of these compositions can result in `id`, `a`, or `b`. This gives us `3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81` possible composition tables to check.\n\n3.  **Filter by Mathematical Law**: Not all 81 tables represent a valid category. The composition operation must be associative, meaning `(x∘y)∘z` must always equal `x∘(y∘z)`. My script will systematically check this property for each of the 81 potential tables.\n\n4.  **Account for \"Up to Isomorphism\"**: The question asks for the number of categories \"up to isomorphism\". This means we should treat categories that are structurally identical as being the same. In our case, a category defined by `{id, a, b}` is considered isomorphic to one where we simply swap the labels 'a' and 'b' everywhere. The script will find all valid monoids and then group them into these isomorphism classes. For each class, it will identify a single \"canonical\" representation to ensure we only count each unique structure once.\n\n5.  **Count and Display Results**: The final answer is the total number of these canonical classes. The script will print the representation for each unique class found and then output the final count.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_category_isomorphism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.\n    A monoid is defined by a set M = {id, a, b} and an associative binary operation 'o'.\n    We represent id as 0, 'a' as 1, and 'b' as 2.\n\n    The structure of the monoid is determined by the 4 products of non-identity elements:\n    a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b.\n    Each of these can be id, a, or b (0, 1, or 2).\n\n    This script iterates through all 3^4 = 81 possibilities, checks for associativity,\n    and then counts the number of unique structures up to isomorphism (swapping 'a' and 'b').\n    \"\"\"\n\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]\n    # Use a set to store the canonical representation of each isomorphism class\n    canonical_forms = set()\n    found_monoids = []\n\n    # Iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possible multiplication tables for the non-identity part\n    # p is a tuple (a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b)\n    for p in itertools.product(elements, repeat=4):\n        # Construct the full 3x3 multiplication table\n        table = [[0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0]]\n        table[1][1], table[1][2], table[2][1], table[2][2] = p[0], p[1], p[2], p[3]\n\n        # Check for associativity: (x*y)*z == x*(y*z) for all x, y, z\n        is_associative = True\n        for x in elements:\n            for y in elements:\n                for z in elements:\n                    if table[table[x][y]][z] != table[x][table[y][z]]:\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative:\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n        \n        # If the table is associative, it defines a valid monoid\n        if is_associative:\n            # This tuple `p` represents a valid monoid structure\n            found_monoids.append(p)\n            \n            # To handle isomorphism, we find the \"twin\" monoid by swapping elements 1 and 2\n            # Isomorphism permutes the non-identity elements: 1 <-> 2\n            perm_map = {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1}\n            \n            # Let the original table be T.
