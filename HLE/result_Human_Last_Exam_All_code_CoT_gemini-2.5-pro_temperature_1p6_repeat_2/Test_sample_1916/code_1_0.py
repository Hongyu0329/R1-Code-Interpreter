def solve_category_isomorphism():
    """
    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.

    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.
    A monoid is defined by a set M = {id, a, b} and an associative binary operation 'o'.
    We represent id as 0, 'a' as 1, and 'b' as 2.

    The structure of the monoid is determined by the 4 products of non-identity elements:
    a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b.
    Each of these can be id, a, or b (0, 1, or 2).

    This script iterates through all 3^4 = 81 possibilities, checks for associativity,
    and then counts the number of unique structures up to isomorphism (swapping 'a' and 'b').
