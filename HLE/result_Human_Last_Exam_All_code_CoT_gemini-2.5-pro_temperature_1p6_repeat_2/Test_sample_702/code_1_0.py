# This problem is from the field of algebraic topology.
# The question asks for the connectivity of the map
# f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).

# The connectivity of a map of the general form
# f: Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q) -> Omega(S^p wedge S^q)
# is given by the formula: p + q - 2.

# In this specific problem, the spheres are S^4 and S^6.
# So, we set p and q to be the dimensions of these spheres.
p = 4
q = 6

# Calculate the connectivity using the formula.
connectivity = p + q - 2

# Print the calculation and the final result.
# The problem asks to show each number in the final equation.
print(f"The connectivity is determined by the formula p + q - 2.")
print(f"For p={p} and q={q}, the calculation is: {p} + {q} - 2 = {connectivity}")
