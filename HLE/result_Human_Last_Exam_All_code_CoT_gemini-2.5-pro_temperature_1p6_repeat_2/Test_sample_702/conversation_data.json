    "To determine the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the spaces and the map:**\n    The domain is $D = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the codomain is $C = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n    The map is an example of a natural transformation in homotopy theory, often constructed from a map between fibrations or as a generalized commutator.\n\n2.  **Understand Connectivity:**\n    A map $f: D \\to C$ is $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(D) \\to \\pi_i(C)$, is an isomorphism for $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber of the map being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\n3.  **State the General Result:**\n    The specific map in the question is a well-studied object in algebraic topology. For a map of the form $j: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^p \\wedge \\Omega S^q) \\to \\Omega(S^p \\wedge S^q)$, there is a known result for its connectivity. The connectivity is given by the formula $p + q - 2$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula to the Specific Case:**\n    In our case, the spheres are $S^4$ and $S^6$, so we have $p=4$ and $q=6$.\n    We can substitute these values into the formula to find the connectivity.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Result:**\n    Using the values $p=4$ and $q=6$, the connectivity is $4 + 6 - 2 = 8$.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# This problem is from the field of algebraic topology.\n# The question asks for the connectivity of the map\n# f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n\n# The connectivity of a map of the general form\n# f: Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q) -> Omega(S^p wedge S^q)\n# is given by the formula: p + q - 2.\n\n# In this specific problem, the spheres are S^4 and S^6.\n# So, we set p and q to be the dimensions of these spheres.\np = 4\nq = 6\n\n# Calculate the connectivity using the formula.\nconnectivity = p + q - 2\n\n# Print the calculation and the final result.\n# The problem asks to show each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"The connectivity is determined by the formula p + q - 2.\")\nprint(f\"For p={p} and q={q}, the calculation is: {p} + {q} - 2 = {connectivity}\")\n```\n<<<8>>>"
