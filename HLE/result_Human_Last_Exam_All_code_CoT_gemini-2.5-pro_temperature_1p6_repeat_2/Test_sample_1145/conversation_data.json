    "Of course. Here is the plan and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Physics Principle**: The probability of finding a particle in a specific region is determined by integrating the probability density, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that region. The wave function for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is given by `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation**: For this problem, the quantum state is `n = 2`. The probability density is `|ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)`. The interval is from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a`. Therefore, the probability `P` is given by the integral:\n    P = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\n3.  **Execute the Calculation**: This integral can be solved analytically, but it is complex. A more straightforward and accurate method is to use numerical integration. I will use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function, a high-precision numerical quadrature tool, to calculate the definite integral. For the calculation, we can set the length of the box `a = 1`, as the probability is a dimensionless quantity and the '`a`' term will cancel out.\n\n4.  **Present the Output**: The Python script will define the probability density function, perform the integration over the specified limits, and print the final equation along with the calculated numerical probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef probability_density(x, n, a):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability density |ψ(x)|² for a particle in a 1D box.\n    \n    Args:\n        x (float): Position inside the box.\n        n (int): The principal quantum number.\n        a (float): The length of the box.\n        \n    Returns:\n        float: The probability density at position x.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (2 / a) * (np.sin(n * np.pi * x / a))**2\n\n# --- Problem Parameters ---\n# The quantum state\nn = 2\n# The interval of interest\nx_start_factor = 0.495\nx_end_factor = 0.505\n\n# For calculation purposes, we can set the length of the box 'a' to 1.0.\n# The probability is a dimensionless ratio, so 'a' will cancel out.\na = 1.0\nx1 = x_start_factor * a\nx2 = x_end_factor * a\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n# Use scipy.integrate.quad to perform the numerical integration.\n# The 'args' tuple passes the parameters n and a to the probability_density function.\nprobability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# --- Output ---\n# Print the final equation with the specific numbers for this problem, as requested.\nprint(\"The probability P is found by solving the integral of the probability density |ψₙ(x)|² over the interval.\")\nprint(\"The specific equation for this problem is:\")\nprint(f\"P = \\u222B [from {x_start_factor}a to {x_end_factor}a] (2/a) * sin\\u00b2({n}\\u03c0x/a) dx\\n\")\n\nprint(f\"The calculated probability for n={n} in the interval [{x1}, {x2}] is:\")\nprint(probability)\n\n```\n<<<6.579736267392633e-06>>>"
