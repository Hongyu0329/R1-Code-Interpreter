    """
    Analyzes mathematical models of neural networks to select the optimal one
    for neuromorphic computing.

    The analysis focuses on key principles of neuromorphic systems:
    1. Continuous-Time Dynamics: Biological processes are continuous.
       Differential equations (∂w/∂t) are more suitable than discrete updates (w(t+1)).
       This favors Models A, C, and D over B and E.
    2. Adaptive Homeostasis: Neural systems self-regulate. Dynamic thresholds
       based on recent (fatigue) and cumulative (homeostasis) activity are critical.
       This favors Models A, B, D, and E over C, which has a simple fixed threshold.
    3. Long-Term Memory: Synaptic strength depends on its entire history.
       An explicit term for historical influence is a powerful feature.
       This favors Models A, B, and E, which contain such a term.

    Conclusion: Model A is the only option that satisfies all the key criteria.
    It combines continuous-time dynamics with sophisticated, biologically plausible
    mechanisms for adaptation and memory, making it the most comprehensive and
    optimal choice for a neuromorphic computing solution.

    This script will now print the equation for Model A, substituting numeric
    placeholders for the descriptive terms to fulfill the request.
