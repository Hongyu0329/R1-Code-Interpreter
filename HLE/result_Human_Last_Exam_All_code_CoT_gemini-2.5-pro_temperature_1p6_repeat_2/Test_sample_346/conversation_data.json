    "An elegant way to solve this is to write a Python program that can understand and evaluate SKI combinator expressions. The program will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Parse the Expression**: First, the program needs to read the given string `S(I)(...)` and convert it into a data structure that represents the nested applications of combinators. I will use simple Python classes for `S`, `K`, `I`, and for applications (`App`).\n2.  **Reduce to Normal Form**: The core of the solution is a reduction engine. It will repeatedly apply the fundamental rules of SKI calculus to simplify the expression until no more reductions are possible. The rules are:\n    *   `S x y z` reduces to `x z (y z)`\n    *   `K x y` reduces to `x`\n    *   `I x` reduces to `x`\n    The program will use a standard reduction strategy (leftmost, outermost) to guarantee it finds the simplest form, known as the \"normal form\".\n3.  **Determine the Integer Value**: The problem states the resulting normal form is a Church numeral `n`. A Church numeral is a function that, when given a function `f` and a value `x`, applies `f` to `x` a total of `n` times, i.e., `f(f(...f(x)...))`. To find `n`, I will apply the reduced expression to special placeholder objects representing `f` and `x`, reduce this new expression, and then simply count how many times `f` was applied.\n4.  **Calculate the Logarithm**: Once the integer `n` is found, the final step is to calculate its base-2 logarithm.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\n# Increase Python's recursion limit to handle potentially deep\n# and complex expression trees that arise during reduction.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(20000)\n\nclass Combinator:\n    \"\"\"Represents a base combinator (S, K, I) or a placeholder (f, x).\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, name: str):\n        self.name = name\n\n    def __repr__(self) -> str:\n        return self.name\n\n    def __call__(self, arg):\n        \"\"\"Allows parsing 'S(K)(I)' by creating an App object.\"\"\"\n        return App(self, arg)\n\nclass App:\n    \"\"\"Represents an application of one expression (func) to another (arg).\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, func, arg):\n        self.func = func\n        self.arg = arg\n\n    def __repr__(self) -> str:\n        \"\"\"Creates a string representation, respecting left-associativity.\"\"\"\n        left = str(self.func)\n        # Parenthesize the function part if it's also an application for clarity.\n        if isinstance(self.func, App):\n            left = f\"({left})\"\n        right = str(self.arg)\n        return f\"{left} {right}\"\n\n    def __call__(self, arg):\n        \"\"\"Allows chaining applications, e.g., expr(new_arg).\"\"\"\n        return App(self, arg)\n\n# Create singleton instances for the three main combinators\nS_c = Combinator(\"S\")\nK_c = Combinator(\"K\")\nI_c = Combinator(\"I\")\n\ndef parse_expression(s: str):\n    \"\"\"Parses the input string into a tree of combinator objects.\"\"\"\n    # We can use eval() in a safely restricted context containing only S, K, and I.\n    # The __call__ methods on the classes handle the tree construction.\n    try:\n        return eval(s, {\"S\": S_c, \"K\": K_c, \"I\": I_c})\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Error parsing expression: {e}\")\n\ndef reduce_once(expr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs one step of leftmost-outermost reduction.\n    Returns the new expression and a boolean indicating if a reduction occurred.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(expr, App):\n        # Base combinators (S, K, I) are already in normal form.\n        return expr, False\n\n    # Check for redexes at the top level first (outermost strategy).\n    \n    # Rule: I x  ->  x\n    if expr.func == I_c:\n        return expr.arg, True\n\n    if isinstance(expr.func, App):\n        # Rule: K x y  ->  x\n        if expr.func.func == K_c:\n            # expr is App(App(K, x), y)\n            return expr.func.arg, True\n\n        if isinstance(expr.func.func, App):\n            # Rule: S x y z  ->  x z (y z)\n            if expr.func.func.func == S_c:\n                # expr is App(App(App(S, x), y), z)\n                x = expr.func.func.arg\n                y = expr.func.arg\n                z = expr.arg\n                # Result is App(App(x, z), App(y, z))\n                return App(App(x, z), App(y, z)), True\n\n    # If no top-level redex, recurse into sub-expressions (leftmost strategy).\n    # First, try to reduce the function part of the application.\n    new_func, was_changed = reduce_once(expr.func)\n    if was_changed:\n        return App(new_func, expr.arg), True\n\n    # If the function part is normal, try to reduce the argument part.\n    new_arg, was_changed = reduce_once(expr.arg)\n    if was_changed:\n        return App(expr.func, new_arg), True\n\n    # No reduction was possible in this expression or its sub-expressions.\n    return expr, False\n\ndef reduce_to_normal_form(expr):\n    \"\"\"Repeatedly applies reduction until the expression is in normal form.\"\"\"\n    is_reducible = True\n    max_steps = 750000 # Safety limit for very long, but finite, reductions.\n    step_count = 0\n    \n    while is_reducible:\n        if step_count > max_steps:\n            raise RuntimeError(f\"Reduction exceeded {max_steps} steps.
