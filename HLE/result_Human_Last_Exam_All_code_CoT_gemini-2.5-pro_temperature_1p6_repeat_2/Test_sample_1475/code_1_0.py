  This function provides the solution to the mathematical problem.
  The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of an intersection
  of countably many open dense subsets of a specific topological space P(X).

  The reasoning is as follows:
  1. The space P(X) is identified as a Baire space (it is a G-delta subset of the complete metric space 2^X).
  2. The Baire Category Theorem implies that a countable intersection of open dense subsets (a residual set) is dense in P(X).
  3. The space P(X) is shown to be a separable, perfect space (it has a countable dense subset and no isolated points).
  4. A dense G-delta subset of a separable, perfect, Baire space is itself a separable, perfect, Baire space.
  5. A key theorem of descriptive set theory states that any separable, perfect, Baire space has the cardinality of the continuum, 2^{\aleph_0}.

  This holds for any choice of X satisfying the conditions. Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is 2^{\aleph_0}.
