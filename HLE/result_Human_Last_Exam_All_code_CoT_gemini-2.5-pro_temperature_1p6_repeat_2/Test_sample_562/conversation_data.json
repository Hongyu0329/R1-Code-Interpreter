    "My plan is to first identify the radical (bushu) of the character 謄. The character is composed of the left-side component 言 and the right-side component 朕. The radical, which typically indicates the semantic category, is 言 (\"word\", \"speech\"). The Japanese name for this radical when it appears on the left is \"gonben\" (ごんべん). I will then provide the Hepburn transcription of this name, which is \"Gonben\".\n\nTo meet the requirement of providing a code-based solution, I will write a simple Python script that prints this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the radical name for a given Kanji.\n    The information is pre-determined as there is no simple algorithmic way\n    to determine a radical without a comprehensive Kanji database.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji_character = \"謄\"\n    \n    # The radical for 謄 is 言.\n    # The Japanese name for this radical on the left side is ごんべん.\n    # The Hepburn transcription is \"Gonben\".\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n    \n    print(f\"The bushu (radical) in the character '{kanji_character}' is called '{radical_name_hepburn}'.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
