    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the correct product, followed by a Python script to present the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a secondary alkyl halide. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong, bulky base. These conditions are ideal for an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction.\n\n2.  **E2 Stereochemical Requirement:** The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement. On a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (in this case, Bromine) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon (a β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** or **trans-diaxial** arrangement. This means both groups must be in axial positions, with one pointing up and the other pointing down.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Starting Material's Conformation:**\n    *   The stereochemistry (1S,2R) on adjacent carbons in a cyclohexane ring means the substituents (Bromo and methyl) are **trans** to each other.\n    *   A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations: one where both groups are equatorial (diequatorial) and one where both are axial (diaxial).\n    *   The **diequatorial conformation is far more stable** and is the predominant form of the molecule at equilibrium. However, in this stable form, the bromine leaving group is equatorial and cannot undergo an E2 reaction.\n    *   For the reaction to occur, the ring must flip to the much less stable **diaxial conformation**. Although this conformer is present in only a tiny amount, it is the only one that is reactive under E2 conditions.\n\n4.  **Identify Available β-Hydrogens in the Reactive Conformation:**\n    *   We must analyze the reactive **diaxial** conformer, where the Bromine on Carbon-1 (C1) is axial and the methyl group on Carbon-2 (C2) is also axial.\n    *   **β-hydrogen at C2:** Since the methyl group on C2 is axial, the hydrogen on C2 must be **equatorial**. This hydrogen is *not* anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 is **impossible**.\n    *   **β-hydrogen at C6:** Carbon-6 has two hydrogens. One is axial, and one is equatorial. The **axial hydrogen on C6 is anti-periplanar** to the axial bromine on C1.\n    *   Therefore, elimination can **only** occur by removing the axial hydrogen from C6.\n\n5.  **Determine the Product:**\n    *   The base (t-BuOK) will abstract the axial proton from C6, the C-H bond breaks, a double bond forms between C1 and C6, and the bromine leaves.\n    *   The methyl group on C2 remains untouched.\n    *   The final product has a double bond and a methyl group. According to IUPAC nomenclature, the double bond is given priority (positions 1 and 2), which places the methyl group at position 3.\n\nThe following Python script will print this logic and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the step-by-step reasoning to identify the product of the given E2 reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: The reaction is an E2 elimination.\")\n    print(\"         (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is treated with potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, bulky base, favoring E2 elimination.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The E2 reaction requires a trans-diaxial arrangement.\")\n    print(\"         For the elimination to occur on a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen must both be in axial positions.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Analyze the reactive conformation of the starting material.\")\n    print(\"         (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a 'trans' isomer.
