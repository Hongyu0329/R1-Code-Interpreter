def solve_integrability_question():
    """
    Analyzes a list of function types and determines which are necessarily Lebesgue integrable.

    The criteria for Lebesgue integrability are:
    1. The function must be measurable.
    2. The integral of its absolute value must be finite.

    Analysis Summary:
    F. Continuous on [a,b]: Always integrable. (Bounded and measurable on a finite measure set).
    L. Measurable with integrable absolute value: Always integrable. (This is the definition).
    M. Bounded continuous on (a,b): Always integrable. (Bounded and measurable on a finite measure set).

    All other options fail for reasons such as lack of guaranteed measurability,
    being on an infinite measure domain, or being potentially unbounded.
