The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence because they misinterpreted their own Quality Control (QC) results. The QC test used a bacterium (*Bacillus subtilis*) on an agar (Batch 3) that should have contained a bacterial inhibitor (chloramphenicol). The chloramphenicol was destroyed during autoclaving, so the bacterium grew on the QC plate. The lab staff incorrectly saw this growth as a successful or "expected" result, when it was actually definitive proof that the antibiotic in the media had failed and the batch was unsuitable for use.
