    "The theologian who first developed a specialized framework and terminology to explain changes or unique events within the laws of nature, such as the virgin birth and the effects of the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo** (354–430 AD).\n\nAugustine did not see miracles as God \"violating\" or \"breaking\" the natural laws He had created. Instead, he developed concepts to explain how such events were part of a deeper, pre-ordained order. His key ideas include:\n\n1.  **Seminal Reasons (*Rationes Seminales*):** Augustine proposed that God, at the moment of creation, embedded \"seminal reasons\" or latent potentialities into the fabric of the universe for everything that would ever come to be. Most things unfold according to the regular, observable patterns we call \"natural law.\" However, miracles like the virgin birth are not new creations or violations of the original order. Instead, they are the activation of a specific potentiality that God had placed within creation from the very beginning, a potentiality that lies outside the normal, everyday course of nature.\n\n2.  ***Contra Naturam* vs. *Praeter Naturam*:** He made a crucial distinction. He argued that a miracle is not *contra naturam* (against nature), because nothing can be against the nature that God Himself established. Rather, a miracle is *praeter naturam* or *supra naturam*—that is, beyond or above the course of nature *as we know it*.\n\nThis framework allowed Augustine to explain both the virgin birth (a unique activation of a seminal reason) and the changes in the natural world after the Fall (e.g., the introduction of death and decay) as part of God's overarching providential plan, rather than as arbitrary interruptions of it.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
