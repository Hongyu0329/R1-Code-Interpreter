    "To solve this problem, we need to find an intermediate binary sequence `?????????` and a single elementary cellular automaton rule (an integer from 0 to 255) that governs both transitions:\n\n1.  `01101001` -> `?????????`\n2.  `?????????` -> `10000111`\n\nMy plan is to systematically test every possible rule from 0 to 255. For each rule, I will simulate the two-step evolution and check if the final state matches the one given in the problem.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Iterate through each of the 256 elementary cellular automaton rules (numbered 0 to 255).\n2.  For each rule, determine its behavior. The rule's 8-bit binary representation defines the output for the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhoods (from `111` down to `000`).\n3.  Apply the current rule to the initial state `01101001` to generate a candidate for the intermediate state. This simulation will assume periodic boundary conditions, where the grid wraps around on itself, which is a standard convention.\n4.  Apply the same rule a second time to the candidate intermediate state.\n5.  Compare the result of this second step to the given final state `10000111`.\n6.  If they match, we have found a valid solution. Since the problem asks for the *only* valid solution, we expect to find exactly one such intermediate state across all 256 rules.\n7.  The script will then print the valid intermediate state that it finds.\n\nThis brute-force search is guaranteed to find the solution if one exists under these standard assumptions.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef apply_rule(state, rule_num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies an elementary cellular automaton rule to a state, assuming\n    periodic boundary conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # An elementary rule is defined by its 8-bit binary representation.\n    # The bits correspond to the output for neighborhoods 111, 110, ..., 000.\n    try:\n        rule_bin = format(rule_num, '08b')\n    except (ValueError, TypeError):\n        return None # Should not happen with integer rule_num\n\n    rule_map = {\n        '111': rule_bin[0], '110': rule_bin[1], '101': rule_bin[2],\n        '100': rule_bin[3], '011': rule_bin[4], '010': rule_bin[5],\n        '001': rule_bin[6], '000': rule_bin[7]\n    }\n    \n    n = len(state)\n    next_state = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell to calculate its next state.\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Periodic boundaries mean the grid wraps around.\n        # The left neighbor of the first cell is the last cell.\n        # The right neighbor of the last cell is the first cell.\n        left_neighbor = state[i - 1]\n        current_cell = state[i]\n        right_neighbor = state[(i + 1) % n]\n        \n        neighborhood = left_neighbor + current_cell + right_neighbor\n        \n        next_state.append(rule_map[neighborhood])\n        \n    return \"\".join(next_state)\n\ndef find_intermediate_step():\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches through all 256 elementary CA rules to find the unique\n    intermediate step between the two given generations.\n    \"\"\"\n    initial_state = \"01101001\"\n    final_state = \"10000111\"\n    \n    valid_solutions = []\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible elementary rules.\n    for rule in range(256):\n        # Step 1: Calculate the potential intermediate state.\n        intermediate_state = apply_rule(initial_state, rule)\n        \n        # Step 2: Calculate the next state from the intermediate one.\n        calculated_final_state = apply_rule(intermediate_state, rule)\n        \n        # Check if the result matches the given final state.\n        if calculated_final_state == final_state:\n            valid_solutions.append(intermediate_state)\n            \n    # Use a set to find the unique intermediate states found.\n    unique_solutions = set(valid_solutions)\n    \n    if len(unique_solutions) == 1:\n        # The problem statement implies there is only one valid solution.\n        print(unique_solutions.pop())\n    elif len(unique_solutions) == 0:\n        print(\"No valid solution found under standard periodic boundary conditions.\", file=sys.stderr)\n    else:\n        # This case is not expected based on the problem statement.\n        print(f\"Error: Found {len(unique_solutions)} unique solutions.\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nfind_intermediate_step()\n```\n<<<01100110>>>"
