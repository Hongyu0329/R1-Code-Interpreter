def perform_scansion():
    """
    This function prints the scansion for the line:
    "And in the letter, my cousin mentions a piece of advice"

    The scansion is determined by analyzing the natural stress pattern of the words.
    'x' represents an unstressed syllable.
    '/' represents a stressed syllable.

    The syllable-by-syllable analysis is as follows:
    - And(x) in(x) the(x) let(/)ter(x)
    - my(x) cou(/)sin(x)
    - men(/)tions(x)
    - a(x) piece(/)
    - of(x) ad(x)vice(/)
