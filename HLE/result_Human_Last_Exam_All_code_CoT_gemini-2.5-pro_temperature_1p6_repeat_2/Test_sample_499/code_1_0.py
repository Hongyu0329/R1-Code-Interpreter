    explanation = """
According to the perturbation theory of deep feedforward networks, the key to a network's trainability lies in its ability to propagate signals (forward pass) and gradients (backward pass) effectively without them vanishing or exploding. This optimal state is often referred to as being at the "edge of chaos."

The theory derives a criticality condition that a network must satisfy at initialization to be in this state. For a network with weights (W) and an activation function (phi), this condition (up to second order) relates the variance of the weights to the properties of the activation function. The equation is typically of the form:

Var(W) * E[(phi'(z))^2] = 1

Where:
- Var(W) is the variance of the weight initialization, which is determined by its magnitude.
- E[(phi'(z))^2] is the expected value of the squared derivative of the activation function.

To satisfy this equation for a chosen activation function (phi), one must carefully set the variance of the weights, Var(W). This directly corresponds to setting the magnitude of the weight initialization. Therefore, the magnitude of weight initialization is the crucial property that determines if the network is initialized in an optimal regime for training.

Based on this, the correct choice is D.
