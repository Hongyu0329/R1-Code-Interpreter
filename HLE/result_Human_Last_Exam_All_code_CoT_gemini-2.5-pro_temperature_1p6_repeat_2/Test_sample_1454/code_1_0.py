    Solves the problem by determining the number of connected components of the IFS graph.

    The set F is an attractor of an Iterated Function System (IFS) defined by the
    set of translations D. The number of connected components of such a fractal attractor
    is related to the number of connected components of a graph G.

    The vertices of G are the points in D. An edge exists between two points d1 and d2 in D
    if their corresponding subsquares touch. For a scaling factor of 1/4, the subsquares
    are axis-aligned and fill a 4x4 grid. Two squares with integer indices
    d1 = (x1, y1) and d2 = (x2, y2) touch if they are not the same square and the
    distance between their centers is small enough, which simplifies to:
    max(|x1 - x2|, |y1 - y2|) <= 1.

    This code builds the graph G and uses a graph traversal algorithm to count its
    connected components.
