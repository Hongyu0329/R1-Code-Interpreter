    "Answering this question requires calculating the Seeley-DeWitt coefficient `a_2` (often denoted `a_4` in the physics literature) for the square of the massless gauged Dirac operator, `D^2`. This is a well-established but highly non-trivial calculation in quantum field theory and noncommutative geometry.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Operator:** The operator is `P = D^2`, where `D = i\\gamma^\\mu(\\partial_\\mu + \\omega_\\mu + A_\\mu)` is the Dirac operator on a 4D curved manifold, coupled to a gauge field `A_\\mu`. `\\omega_\\mu` is the spin connection.\n2.  **Use the Lichnerowicz Formula:** The square of the Dirac operator can be expressed in the form of a generalized Laplacian `P = -\\nabla^2 - E`, where `\\nabla` is the full covariant derivative and `E` is an endomorphism term involving curvature and field strength.\n3.  **Apply Standard Heat Kernel Formulas:** The heat kernel coefficient `a_2(P)` for a generalized Laplacian is given by a standard (but complicated) formula involving traces of powers of `E`, the curvature of the connection `\\nabla` (denoted `\\Omega_{\\mu\\nu}`), and the Riemann curvature tensor of the manifold.\n4.  **Compute Traces:** The final step involves computing traces over both the spinor and gauge group representation spaces. This requires using gamma matrix trace identities and properties of the gauge group generators.\n5.  **Assemble the Result:** Combine all the pieces to get the final expression for the coefficient `a_2`. The result will be a linear combination of various geometric and gauge-invariant terms.\n\nThe calculation is quite lengthy and prone to errors in signs and numerical factors. Therefore, I will rely on well-established results from the literature (e.g., Iglewsias and Schaposnik, \"Heat-kernel coefficients for the gauged Laplace and Dirac operators,\" 2019).\n\nThe final expression for the traced coefficient density, which we need to integrate to get the full second coefficient of the heat kernel expansion, is a function of the spacetime curvature and the gauge field strength. The Python code below will print this expression, showing the numerical coefficients for each term. `N` represents the dimension of the gauge group representation for the spinor field.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef find_second_heat_kernel_coefficient():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays the second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient (a_2)\n    for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field in 4 dimensions.\n\n    The coefficient is an expression involving geometric and gauge field invariants.\n    N represents the dimension of the gauge group representation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The coefficients are derived from established results in the literature for the\n    # traced heat kernel density, tr(a_2(D^2)).
