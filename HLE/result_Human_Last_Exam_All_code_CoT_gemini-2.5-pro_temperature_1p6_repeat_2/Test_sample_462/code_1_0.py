# Define the side length of the large square
side_large_square = 20.0

# 1. Determine the radius of the circles.
# The side length of the square (20cm) is equal to 4 times the radius.
# 20 = 4r -> r = 5
radius = side_large_square / 4

# 2. Define the inner square formed by the centers of the circles.
# The side length of this square is the distance between centers, which is 2 * r.
side_inner_square = 2 * radius

# 3. Calculate the necessary areas.
# Area of the inner square
area_inner_square = side_inner_square**2

# Area of the four quarter-circles inside the inner square (equals one full circle)
area_of_circle_parts = math.pi * radius**2

# 4. Calculate the final area by subtraction.
final_area = area_inner_square - area_of_circle_parts

# 5. Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers.
