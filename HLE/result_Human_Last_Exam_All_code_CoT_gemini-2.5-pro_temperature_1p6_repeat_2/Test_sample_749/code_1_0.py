# The problem asks for the limit of a probability P(h) as h -> 0.
# Assuming continuity, this limit is equal to P(0).

# Let's define the system at h=0.
# h is the probability of a site being red. At h=0, all sites are blue.
# h is the probability of a particle branching. At h=0, no branching occurs.

# So, the system simplifies to a single particle starting at position x_0 = 3.
# At every site (which is blue), the particle moves left with probability 1/5
# and right with probability 4/5.

# This is a simple 1D biased random walk.
# The event E is "site 0 is visited by infinitely many different particles".
# Since there is only one particle at h=0, this becomes "site 0 is visited
# infinitely often by the single particle".

# A 1D random walk is recurrent if and only if it is unbiased.
# The bias (expected displacement per step) is:
p_left = 1/5
p_right = 4/5
expected_step = (-1) * p_left + (1) * p_right
# expected_step = -1/5 + 4/5 = 3/5

# Since the expected step is not 0, the random walk is transient.
# A transient random walk visits any given site only a finite number of times
# with probability 1.
# Therefore, the probability of visiting site 0 infinitely often is 0.
