    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted as $Q_{128}$. This group is a *p-group*, specifically a 2-group, as its order ($128 = 2^7$) is a power of a prime number (p=2).\n2.  **Find the Group Exponent:** The exponent of a group is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of all its elements. For the generalized quaternion group $Q_{2^n}$ (where $n \\ge 3$), the exponent is known to be $2^{n-1}$. For $Q_{128}$, we have $128 = 2^7$, so $n=7$. The exponent is $2^{7-1} = 2^6 = 64$.\n3.  **Use the Formula for Power Subgroups of a p-Group:** There is a known theorem for a finite p-group $G$, the number of its distinct power subgroups is given by the formula: $1 + \\log_p(\\exp(G))$, where $\\exp(G)$ is the exponent of the group.\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** I will apply this formula with $p=2$ and $\\exp(G) = 64$.\n    *   Number of subgroups = $1 + \\log_2(64)$\n    *   Since $2^6 = 64$, we have $\\log_2(64) = 6$.\n    *   Number of subgroups = $1 + 6 = 7$.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the size of the generalized quaternion group.\ngroup_size = 128\n\n# The size of a generalized quaternion group is N = 2^n. We find n.\n# n = log2(N)\nn = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n# For a generalized quaternion group Q_{2^n} (with n >= 3),\n# the exponent is 2^(n-1).\nexponent = 2**(n - 1)\nlog_of_exponent = n - 1\n\n# For a finite p-group G (where p is a prime), the number of power subgroups is\n# given by the formula: 1 + log_p(exp(G)).\n# In this case, the group is a 2-group, so p=2.\np = 2\nnum_power_subgroups = 1 + log_of_exponent\n\n# Print the final result, showing each number in the calculation.\nprint(f\"The number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size {group_size} is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"1 + log{p}({exponent}) = 1 + {log_of_exponent} = {num_power_subgroups}\")\n```\n<<<7>>>"
