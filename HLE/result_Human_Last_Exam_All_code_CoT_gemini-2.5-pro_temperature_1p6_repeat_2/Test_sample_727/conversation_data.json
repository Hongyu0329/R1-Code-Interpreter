    "My plan is to analyze the chess position right before black's 130th move and determine which of the provided queen moves would have resulted in a draw, instead of the loss that occurred in the actual game.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Position:** At move 130, White has a powerful attack brewing with their King on h3, Rook on f5, and Knight on h5. The white e-pawn at e5 is a major threat. Black's queen on a2 is far from their king on e8, which is in danger. Black's only hope is to use the queen to create immediate and decisive counterplay, specifically by checking the exposed white king.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Game Move:** In the game, Black played `130... Qe6`. This move was a fatal error because it allowed White's king to escape to h4 (`131. Kh4`), after which White's attack becomes unstoppable, as demonstrated by the subsequent moves of the game.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Alternatives:** I will now evaluate the given options to find a move that secures a draw. The key to drawing is to force a perpetual check. A perpetual check is a situation where one player can force a draw by an endless series of checks from which the opposing king cannot escape.\n\n4.  **Identify the Drawing Move:**\n    *   Many of the options (like Qa1, Qa7, Qb2) are too passive. They leave the queen far from the action and do not address White's crushing attack.\n    *   The correct idea is to start checking the white king immediately. Let's analyze move `C. Qg2`.\n    *   If Black plays `130... Qg2+`, it forces the white king to the only available square, h4 (`131. Kh4`).\n    *   From there, Black can continue with `131... Qh2+`. This again forces the white king to its only escape square, g4 (`132. Kg4`).\n    *   Now, Black can play `132... Qg2+`, forcing the king back to h4.\n    *   This creates an inescapable loop of checks for the white king (`...Qg2+ Kh4 Qh2+ Kg4 Qg2+...`). Since White cannot avoid repeating the same position three times to escape the checks, the game is declared a draw by repetition.\n\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that prints this explanation, including the specific sequence of moves that leads to the draw, and then outputs the final correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position at move 130 from Carlsen-Nepomniachtchi, Game 6, 2021,\n    and identifies the drawing move for Black.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    Step-by-step analysis to find the drawing move for Black:\n\n    1.  **Position Analysis (before Black's 130th move):**\n        White's pieces (King on h3, Rook on f5, Knight on h5) and the advanced pawn on e5 create a winning attack against Black's king on e8. Black's queen on a2 is too far away to defend conventionally. Black's only chance for survival is to create immediate counterplay with a perpetual check.\n\n    2.  **The Losing Blunder:**\n        In the actual game, Black played `130... Qe6`. This move fails because it allows White's king to improve its position with `131. Kh4`, after which White's attack is decisive, and Black cannot prevent the loss.\n\n    3.  **The Drawing Combination:**\n        The correct path to a draw is to initiate a perpetual check. Several queen checks can achieve this, but let's analyze option C, `130... Qg2`.\n\n        This move forces the following sequence:\n\n        -   Move 130 for Black: **Qg2+**\n            This puts the white king in check.\n        -   Move 131 for White: **Kh4**\n            This is the only legal move for White's king.\n        -   Move 131 for Black: **Qh2+**\n            Black continues the series of checks.\n        -   Move 132 for White: **Kg4**\n            Again, this is the only legal move for White's king.\n        -   Move 132 for Black: **Qg2+**\n            Black forces the king back to h4, and the sequence repeats.\n\n    4.  **The \"Final Equation\" of Moves:**\n        The drawing sequence demonstrates a forced repetition of moves from which White cannot escape. The sequence is:\n\n        130... Qg2+\n        131. Kh4\n        131... Qh2+\n        132. Kg4\n        132... Qg2+\n        ... leading to a draw.\n\n    5.  **Conclusion:**\n        Move `130... Qg2` successfully forces a draw by perpetual check. Other checks like `Qh2+` or `Qf2+` would also lead to a similar drawing pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n    # The final answer is the move that initiates this drawing sequence.\n    final_answer = \"C\"\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n```"
