    "Based on paleontological research, the lacrimal recess in the skull of *Irritator challengeri* is described as having two large pneumatic foramina (depressions). I will write a simple Python script to represent this fact as a sum. The script will assign a value of 1 to each depression and then add them together to find the total.\n\n```python\n# The task is to find the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri.\n# Based on the scientific literature (e.g., Sues et al., 2002), there are two.\n# We can represent this as a simple addition problem.\n\n# Each depression (foramen) is counted as one.\ndepression_1 = 1\ndepression_2 = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of depressions.\ntotal_depressions = depression_1 + depression_2\n\n# Print the final equation and the answer.\nprint(f\"Equation: {depression_1} + {depression_2} = {total_depressions}\")\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {total_depressions} depressions.\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
