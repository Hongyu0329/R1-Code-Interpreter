# The task is to find the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri.
# Based on the scientific literature (e.g., Sues et al., 2002), there are two.
# We can represent this as a simple addition problem.

# Each depression (foramen) is counted as one.
depression_1 = 1
depression_2 = 1

# Calculate the total number of depressions.
total_depressions = depression_1 + depression_2

# Print the final equation and the answer.
print(f"Equation: {depression_1} + {depression_2} = {total_depressions}")
print(f"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {total_depressions} depressions.")
