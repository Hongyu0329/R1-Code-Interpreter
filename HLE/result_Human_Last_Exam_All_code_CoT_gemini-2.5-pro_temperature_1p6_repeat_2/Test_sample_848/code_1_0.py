    """
    This function calculates the integer part of 10^4 * lim_{N->inf} (F(N) / ln(N)).
    The derivation is as follows:
    1. The problem is equivalent to finding integer pairs (a,b) where k = (a^2+b^2+5a+5b+1)/(ab) is an integer.
    2. We identify two families of solutions corresponding to k=13 and k=5.
    3. The number of solutions in each family grows asymptotically with ln(N).
    4. For k=13, the growth rate is determined by the dominant root of r^2 - 13r + 1 = 0, which is alpha1.
    5. For k=5, the growth rate is determined by the dominant root of r^2 - 5r + 1 = 0, which is alpha2.
    6. The limit is the sum of the coefficients from each family: 2/ln(alpha1) + 2/ln(alpha2).
    7. We calculate this value, multiply by 10^4, and find the integer part.
