# Goal: To solve the character riddle by analyzing its strokes.

# 1. Decode the riddle to count the strokes.
# "One horizontal stroke, another horizontal stroke..." clearly indicates two horizontal strokes.
num_horizontal = 2

# "...one vertical stroke, another vertical stroke..." clearly indicates two vertical strokes.
# The phrase "...one vertical on the left, one vertical on the right" confirms their grid-like arrangement.
num_vertical = 2

# 2. Identify the character based on the stroke count and arrangement.
# A character made of 2 horizontal and 2 vertical strokes in a grid is "井" (jǐng), which means "well".
final_character = "井"

# 3. Present the analysis and the "final equation" as requested.
print("Decoding the riddle based on its description of strokes:")
print(f"Number of horizontal strokes described: {num_horizontal}")
print(f"Number of vertical strokes described: {num_vertical}")

print("\nThe final 'equation' from the components is:")
# The instruction was: "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
print(f"{num_horizontal} horizontal strokes + {num_vertical} vertical strokes = {final_character}")
