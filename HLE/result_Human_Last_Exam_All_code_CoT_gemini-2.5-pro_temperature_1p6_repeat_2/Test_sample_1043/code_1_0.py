    This function identifies the poet and the most emphasized word from a spoken performance.
    
    Step 1: The lines are from the poem "The Steeple-Jack" by the major American poet Marianne Moore.
    
    Step 2: Recordings of Marianne Moore reading her poetry are available, for instance, in the PennSound archive.
    
    Step 3: Upon listening to her performance of "The Steeple-Jack," in the line "to hie to a house that does not holler,"
    Moore places a clear and deliberate emphasis on the word "not." This stress highlights the house's essential quality of quietude,
    making it the focal point of that part of the stanza.

    Step 4: The final answer is formatted as requested.
