    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Equation**: The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind: `u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ K(x, y) u(y) dy`.\n    *   `f(x) = 1`\n    *   The kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Kernel**: The kernel can be simplified using the formula for the difference of powers:\n    `K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n    This shows the kernel is a polynomial in `x` and `y`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Form of the Solution**: Since the kernel is a polynomial of degree `n-1` in `x`, the integral term `∫ K(x,y)u(y)dy` will also be a polynomial in `x` of at most degree `n-1`. Therefore, the solution `u(x)` must have the form of a polynomial of at most degree `n-1`:\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ * (polynomial in x)`.\n    Let's assume the solution is `u(x) = 1 + λ Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j x^{n-1-j}` where `c_j` are unknown coefficients.\n\n4.  **Derive a System of Linear Equations**: We define the coefficients `c_k` as moments of the solution `u(x)`: `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` for `k=0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n    Substitute the expression for `u(y)` into the definition of `c_k`:\n    `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k (1 + λ Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j y^{n-1-j}) dy`\n    `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k dy + λ Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j ∫₀¹ y^{k+n-1-j} dy`\n    `c_k = 1/(k+1) + λ Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j / (k+n-j)`\n\n    This can be rewritten as a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknown coefficients `c_0, ..., c_{n-1}`:\n    `c_k - λ Σ_{j=0}^{n-1} (1/(k+n-j)) c_j = 1/(k+1)`\n    In matrix form, this is `(I - λM)c = d`, where:\n    *   `c` is the column vector of coefficients `[c_0, ..., c_{n-1}]ᵀ`.\n    *   `d` is the column vector `[1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`.\n    *   `M` is an `n x n` matrix with elements `M_{kj} = 1/(n+k-j)` for `k,j = 0, ..., n-1`.\n\n5.  **Condition for No Solution**: According to the Fredholm alternative, this system of linear equations has no solution if `det(I - λM) = 0` and the vector `d` is not in the column space of `(I - λM)`.\n    *   The condition `det(I - λM) = 0` implies that `λ` must be the reciprocal of a non-zero eigenvalue `μ` of the matrix `M` (i.e., `λ = 1/μ`).\n    *   For these values of `λ`, it can be shown that the system is inconsistent, meaning no solution for the coefficients `c_k` exists.\n\n6.  **Solve with Python**: Since the problem is stated for a general integer `n`, but no specific value is provided, the solution involves finding the eigenvalues of an `n x n` matrix. I will provide a Python script that calculates these values for any given `n`. As a demonstration, the code will be run for `n=2`, a common non-trivial example. The script will:\n    a. Construct the matrix `M`.\n    b. Compute its eigenvalues `μ` using NumPy.\n    c. Calculate and print the values of `λ = 1/μ`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_lambda_for_no_solution(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solution.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The integer exponent in the kernel of the integral equation.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of values of λ.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to the derivation, the values of λ are the reciprocals of the\n    # eigenvalues of the matrix M, where M_kj = 1/(n+k-j) for k,j = 0..n-1.\n\n    # Step 1: Construct the matrix M.\n    M = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for k in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            M[k, j] = 1.0 / (n + k - j)\n\n    # Step 2: Find the eigenvalues of M.\n    try:\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(M)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        print(f\"Eigenvalue computation failed for n={n}.\")\n        return []\n\n    # Step 3: λ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues.\n    # We filter out eigenvalues close to zero to avoid division by zero errors.\n    lambda_values = []\n    for mu in eigenvalues:\n        if not np.isclose(mu, 0):\n            lambda_values.append(1.0 / mu)\n\n    return lambda_values\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to execute the solution.\n    The problem does not specify the integer n.
