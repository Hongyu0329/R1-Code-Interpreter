# Based on the mathematical analysis, the limit of the sequence g_n is g.
# The prime factors of g can only be 2, 3, and 5.
# The exponent of 2 in g is 10.
# The exponent of 3 in g is 2.
# The exponent of 5 in g is 1.

# These exponents are the minimum p-adic valuations of P(q)
# over all large primes q.

# Define the prime factors and their exponents
p1, e1 = 2, 10
p2, e2 = 3, 2
p3, e3 = 5, 1

# Calculate the final result
result = (p1**e1) * (p2**e2) * (p3**e3)

# Print the calculation and the final answer
print(f"The limit is the result of the calculation:")
print(f"{p1}^{e1} * {p2}^{e2} * {p3}^{e3} = {result}")

print(f"\nThe equation is {p1}^{e1} * {p2}^{e2} * {p3}^{e3} = {p1**e1} * {p2**e2} * {p3**e3} = {result}")
