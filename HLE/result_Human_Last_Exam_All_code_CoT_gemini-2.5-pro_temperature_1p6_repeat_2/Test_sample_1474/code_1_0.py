# This script analyzes film history to find a common element between two directors.

# Evidence from Fritz Lang's filmography
# We found 1 key film series: "Die Spinnen" ("The Spiders").
lang_evidence_count = 1

# Evidence from William Friedkin's filmography
# We found 2 key examples: the "spider walk" in "The Exorcist" and the movie "Bug".

# To satisfy the prompt's requirement for an equation, we can represent the
# accumulation of evidence as a simple sum.
# The equation shows the pieces of evidence found for the correct answer.
