# This script formalizes the reasoning for the multi-part question.

# (a) Logic: We check if the condition p > 2*(1+3*s)/(1+s) makes J_t unbounded below.
# We test a path u_t where u depends only on x.
# The kinetic energy exponent is 2*s. The potential energy exponent is (s+1)*(p/2 - 1).
# We need potential_exp > kinetic_exp => (s+1)*(p/2-1) > 2s.
# Solving for p gives p > 2*(3s+1)/(s+1). The statement is True.

# (b) Logic: For systems in R^N, existence of a critical point from MPT does not
# guarantee existence of a ground state due to possible loss of compactness. The answer is No.

# (c) Logic: Uniqueness for minimizers in coupled systems is rare. The condition
# on r1+r2 is likely for existence, not uniqueness. Bifurcations can create
# multiple solutions. The answer is No.

# Let's demonstrate the calculation for part (a) with a numerical example
# as requested by the prompt "output each number in the final equation".
# Let's choose a value for s.
s_val = 3

# The condition is p > 2 * (3*s + 1) / (s + 1)
# We calculate the critical value for p.
term1_num = 3
term2_num = s_val
numerator = 2 * (term1_num * term2_num + 1)

term1_den = s_val
term2_den = 1
denominator = term1_den + term2_den

critical_p = numerator / denominator

print("Demonstration for part (a) with s = 3:")
print("The inequality is p > 2 * (3 * s + 1) / (s + 1)")
print("Substituting s = 3, we get:")
print(f"p > 2 * ({term1_num} * {term2_num} + 1) / ({term1_den} + {term2_den})")
print(f"p > 2 * ({term1_num * term2_num + 1}) / ({term1_den + term2_den})")
print(f"p > {numerator} / {denominator}")
print(f"p > {critical_p}")

# Now, we provide the final answers in the requested format.
answer_a = "True"
answer_b = "No"
answer_c = "No"

# sys.stdout.write is used to avoid adding a newline, matching the format example precisely
# although the final newline is generally not an issue.
sys.stdout.write(f"(a) [{answer_a}]; (b) [{answer_b}]; (c) [{answer_c}].\n")
