def solve_group_topology_problem():
    """
    This function solves the problem of finding the largest possible number of
    non-open components of an open subset of a specific topological group G.

    Here is a summary of the reasoning:

    1. The problem specifies a Hausdorff topological group G with cardinality c
       (the cardinality of the continuum) and a certain property related to
       connected sets near the identity.

    2. This property does not make the group G locally connected. A lack of
       local connectedness is what allows for the existence of non-open
       components of an open set.

    3. We need to find an example of such a group G and an open subset O that
       maximizes the number of non-open components. Two such examples are:
       a) The solenoid group S. The open set O = S \\ {p} (S with one point removed)
          has c components, and it can be shown that none of them are open in S.
       b) The real numbers R with the density topology. The open set O = R \\ Q
          (the irrational numbers) has c components (the individual irrational
          points), none of which are open in this topology.

    4. In both cases, we find an open set with c non-open components.

    5. The number of components of a subset of G cannot exceed the cardinality of G,
       which is c.

    6. Therefore, the largest possible number is c, the cardinality of the continuum.
       This number is commonly denoted in set theory as 2 raised to the power of aleph_0.

    The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
    The final answer is c = 2^{\aleph_0}. The numbers are 2 and 0.
    """

    # The cardinality of the continuum, c, is also written as 2**aleph_0.
    # Aleph_0 represents the cardinality of the natural numbers.
    base = 2
    exponent_base_symbol = "aleph"
    exponent_index = 0

    # The final result is a symbolic representation.
    final_answer = f"{base}**{exponent_base_symbol}_{exponent_index}"

    print(f"The largest possible number of non-open components is the cardinality of the continuum, c.")
    print(f"This is commonly expressed by the equation: c = {final_answer}")
    print("The numbers in this final equation are:")
    print(base)
    print(exponent_index)
