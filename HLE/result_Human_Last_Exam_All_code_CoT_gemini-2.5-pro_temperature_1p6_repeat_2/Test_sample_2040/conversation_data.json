    "To determine if free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), we need to analyze their crystal symmetry.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Physical Principle:** Spontaneous parametric downconversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process. A fundamental requirement for a material to exhibit any second-order effect is that it must lack a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n2.  **Check Material Properties:** For materials with a center of symmetry (centrosymmetric), the second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾, is zero. If χ⁽²⁾ is zero, SPDC cannot occur. We need to determine the symmetry of common, stable boron nanosheet structures.\n3.  **Synthesize into a Script:** I will write a Python script that simulates this look-up process. The script will:\n    *   Store the symmetry property of boron nanosheets in a simple data structure.\n    *   Determine the value of χ⁽²⁾ based on this property (0 for centrosymmetric, non-zero otherwise).\n    *   Use a simplified symbolic equation for SPDC efficiency, which is proportional to |χ⁽²⁾|², to demonstrate the outcome.\n    *   Print the steps of the reasoning and the final conclusion based on the result of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef check_spdc_potential(material_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a material is expected to exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)\n    by analyzing its crystal symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A simplified database of material properties.\n    # Most common, stable forms of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene),\n    # such as the β12 and χ3 phases, are centrosymmetric (possess an inversion center).\n    material_database = {\n        'boron_nanosheet': {'is_centrosymmetric': True, 'chi_2_symbolic': 0},\n        'quartz': {'is_centrosymmetric': False, 'chi_2_symbolic': 'non-zero'},\n        'silicon': {'is_centrosymmetric': True, 'chi_2_symbolic': 0}\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing SPDC potential for: {material_name}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n    if material_name not in material_database:\n        print(f\"Error: Material '{material_name}' not found in the database.\")\n        return\n\n    properties = material_database[material_name]\n    is_symmetric = properties['is_centrosymmetric']\n    chi_2_val = properties['chi_2_symbolic']\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\")\n    print(\"Step 2: This process requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\")\n    print(\"Step 3: Materials with a center of inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric) have χ⁽²⁾ = 0.\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nStep 4: Checking the properties of '{material_name}'...\")\n    print(f\"Is the material centrosymmetric? {is_symmetric}\")\n\n    # Assign a numerical value for calculation. χ⁽²⁾ for centrosymmetric materials is 0.\n    chi_2_numeric = 0 if is_symmetric else 1 # Using 1 as a placeholder for non-zero\n\n    print(f\"\\nStep 5: Based on its symmetry, the second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) for {material_name} is {chi_2_val}.\")\n    \n    # Symbolic calculation for SPDC efficiency, which is proportional to |χ⁽²⁾|²\n    power = 2\n    result = math.pow(abs(chi_2_numeric), power)\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 6: Calculating the relative efficiency, which is proportional to |χ⁽²⁾|².\")\n    # The final equation as requested, printing each number\n    print(f\"Equation: |{chi_2_numeric}|**{power} = {result}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    if result == 0:\n        print(f\"The result is 0.
