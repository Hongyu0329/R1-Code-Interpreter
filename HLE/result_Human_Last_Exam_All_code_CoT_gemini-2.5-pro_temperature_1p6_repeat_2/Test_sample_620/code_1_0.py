    This function explains the reasoning for troubleshooting an enzyme assay
    with a non-linear Product vs. Time plot, given specific experimental conditions.

    print("--- Analysis of the Enzyme Kinetics Problem ---")

    # Step 1: Define the core observation
    print("\n[Problem Definition]")
    print("Observation: The Product vs. Time plot is not linear.")
    print("This means the reaction velocity is not constant, which prevents accurate measurement of the initial rate (V0).")

    # Step 2: Analyze the key experimental details
    print("\n[Key Information Analysis]")
    print("Clue 1: The enzyme is an 'obligate dimer'. It must be in a Dimer form to be active.")
    print("         Inactive Monomer + Inactive Monomer <=> Active Dimer")
    print("Clue 2: The assay is 'chilled on ice' before the reaction starts.")
    print("Implication: Low temperatures can cause certain multimeric proteins to dissociate into their subunits (cold denaturation).")

    # Step 3: Formulate the most likely hypothesis
    print("\n[Hypothesis Formulation]")
    print("The 'chilling on ice' step causes the active Dimer to break apart into inactive Monomers.")
    print("When the reaction is started (at a warmer temperature), the Monomers must re-associate into Dimers.")
    print("This re-association takes time, causing a 'lag phase' where the reaction rate starts slow and increases over time.")
    print("A lag phase results in an upward-curving, non-linear plot.")

    # Step 4: Evaluate potential solutions based on the hypothesis
    print("\n[Evaluating Answer Choices]")
    print("To fix the lag phase, we must promote the formation of the active Dimer.")
    print("Let's analyze the equilibrium: 2 * Monomer <=> 1 * Dimer")
    print("  - A (Increase Temperature): May speed up dimerization, but doesn't directly shift the equilibrium position as effectively as concentration changes.")
    print("  - B (Decrease Temperature): Would favor more Monomers, making the problem worse.")
    print("  - C (Increase Enzyme Concentration): According to Le Chatelier's Principle, increasing the total protein concentration will push the equilibrium to the right, favoring the formation of the active Dimer.")
    print("  - D (Decrease Enzyme Concentration): Would push the equilibrium to the left, favoring inactive Monomers and making the lag phase longer.")

    # Step 5: Conclude the best solution
    print("\n[Conclusion]")
    print("The most effective solution among the choices is to increase the enzyme concentration.")
    print("This will increase the proportion of the enzyme that is in the active dimer form at the start of the reaction, minimizing the lag phase and helping to achieve a linear initial rate.")
    print("\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.")
