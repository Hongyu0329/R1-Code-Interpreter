    "I will write a Python script to solve this task. My plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use the `requests` library to download the content of the Wikipedia page for the \"Pskov-Pechory Monastery,\" which is the English name for the Pskov-Caves Monastery. The Russian-language version of the page is often more detailed for this type of historical information, so I will target that one.\n2.  I will use the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML of the page.\n3.  I will search for the section on the page that lists the abbots or archimandrites (in Russian: \"Настоятели\").\n4.  Within that section, I will iterate through the list of individuals.\n5.  I will search each entry for the specific years \"1730–1731\" to find the person who served during that exact period.\n6.  Once found, I will print the line containing the name and the years of service.\n7.  Finally, I will compare the found name with the provided answer choices to determine the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport re\n\ndef find_archimandrite():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints the name of the archimandrite of the Pskov-Caves Monastery\n    for the period 1730-1731 by scraping a Wikipedia page.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Russian Wikipedia page is more likely to contain a detailed list of abbots.\n    url = \"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Псково-Печерский_монастырь\"\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an error for bad status codes\n\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n\n        # Find the header for the list of abbots (\"Настоятели\").\n        # The id 'Настоятели' corresponds to the \"Abbots\" section.\n        abbots_header = soup.find('span', id='Настоятели')\n\n        if not abbots_header:\n            print(\"Could not find the 'Abbots' (Настоятели) section on the page.\")\n            return\n\n        # The list of abbots is usually in a <ul> tag immediately following the header's parent.\n        # We will search for all list items (`<li>`) within the subsequent sibling elements.\n        current_element = abbots_header.find_parent()\n        found_archimandrite = False\n\n        while current_element and not found_archimandrite:\n            current_element = current_element.find_next_sibling()\n            if current_element and current_element.name == 'ul':\n                list_items = current_element.find_all('li')\n                for item in list_items:\n                    # We look for the exact year range \"1730—1731\".
