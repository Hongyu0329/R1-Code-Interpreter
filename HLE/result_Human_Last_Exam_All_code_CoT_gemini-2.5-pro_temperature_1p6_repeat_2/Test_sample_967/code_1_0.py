    Computes the first l2-Betti number for the given graph of groups G.

    The formula for the first l2-Betti number of a fundamental group G of a finite
    graph of infinite groups is:
    beta_1(G) = sum_{v in V} beta_1(G_v) - sum_{e in E} beta_1(G_e)

    Here's the breakdown of the calculation:

    1. Edge Group Contributions:
    Each edge group G_e is some N_k. The manifold M_k is a mapping torus of a
    pseudo-Anosov map, which is a hyperbolic 3-manifold. The first l2-Betti
    number of its fundamental group is 0. Since N_k is a finite-index subgroup
    of pi_1(M_k), its first l2-Betti number is also 0.
    Therefore, the sum over all 30 edges is 0.
    """
    
    # Sum of beta_1 for all edge groups
    sum_b1_ge = 0

    """
    2. Vertex Group Contributions:
    The underlying graph has 15 vertices, enumerated v_1, ..., v_15.

    - For v_1, the group is G_{v_1} = N_{100}. As noted in the explanation, this
      leads to a contradiction. We assume a typo and use N_10 instead. Like any
      other N_k, its beta_1 is 0.
    """
    b1_gv1 = 0
    
    """
    - For v_i where i is in {2, ..., 15}, the group is G_{v_i} = *_g=2^i N_g.
      This is a free product of i-1 infinite groups, each with beta_1 = 0.
      The formula for the first l2-Betti number of a free product of k infinite groups
      A_1, ..., A_k is:
      beta_1(*A_j) = sum(beta_1(A_j)) + k - 1
      For G_{v_i}, we have k=i-1 factors, and each beta_1(N_g)=0.
      So, beta_1(G_{v_i}) = 0 + (i-1) - 1 = i - 2.
    
    We sum these contributions for i from 2 to 15.
