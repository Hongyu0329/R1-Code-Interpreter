    "My plan is to simulate each of the three Turing Machines on an empty tape, starting from state 'A'. I will count the number of steps each machine takes until it reaches the halting state 'H'.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Represent the Turing Machine:** I will represent the machine's tape using a Python dictionary that can grow infinitely in both directions, with 0 as the default value for any unvisited cell. The machine's state, head position, and step count will be stored in variables.\n2.  **Parse the Rules:** The rules for each machine are provided as a single string. I will parse this string into a more usable format, a dictionary. The states are alphabetically ordered (A, B, C, D, E). The rules are provided in pairs: the first rule for a state is for reading a '0', and the second is for reading a '1'. For example, for Machine 1, the first two rules `B1L B0R` correspond to state 'A':\n    *   If in state 'A' and reading '0', change to state 'B', write '1', and move Left ('L').\n    *   If in state 'A' and reading '1', change to state 'B', write '0', and move Right ('R').\n3.  **Simulate Execution:** I will create a function that takes the rules as input and simulates the machine's execution step by step. The simulation will continue until the machine's state becomes 'H'.\n4.  **Find the Maximum:** I will run the simulation for all three machines, record the number of steps each one takes to halt, and then identify which machine ran for the longest and how many steps it took.\n5.  **Output the Result:** Finally, I will print the index of the winning machine and the total number of steps it executed.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_turing_machine_race():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates three Turing Machines to find which one halts after the most steps.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    machines = [\n        \"B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L\",\n        \"B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R\",\n        \"B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R\"\n    ]\n\n    def simulate(rule_string):\n        \"\"\"\n        Simulates a single Turing Machine based on its rule string.\n        \"\"\"\n        # --- 1.
