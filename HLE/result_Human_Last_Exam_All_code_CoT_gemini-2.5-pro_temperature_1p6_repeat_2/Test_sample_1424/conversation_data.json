    "In the Feynman path integral formalism of many-body quantum mechanics, the Green's function (or propagator) is a fundamental quantity that describes how a particle propagates through the system. The \"bare\" Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, specifically describes this propagation in a non-interacting system.\n\nThe functional dependence of $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is most clearly expressed in the frequency-momentum representation, $G_0(\\omega, k)$. To obtain this, one performs a Fourier transform from the time domain to the frequency domain.\n\nHere is the plan to derive and present this relationship:\n1.  **Define the Bare Propagator**: Start with the time-ordered Green's function for a non-interacting system.\n2.  **Fourier Transform**: Transform from time ($t$) to frequency ($\\omega$). The time-ordering requires the introduction of a small imaginary term, $i\\delta$, to ensure the convergence of the Fourier integral.\n3.  **Resulting Formula**: The final result, known as the Lehmann representation for the non-interacting Green's function, shows that $G_0$ has poles at the single-particle energies $\\epsilon_k$. The structure of the formula depends on whether the energy level $\\epsilon_k$ is occupied or empty in the ground state (i.e., whether it's below or above the Fermi energy, $\\mu$).\n\nThe resulting equation is:\n$G_0(\\omega, \\epsilon_k) = \\frac{\\theta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta} + \\frac{\\theta(\\mu - \\epsilon_k)}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\delta}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $\\omega$ is the frequency (representing energy).\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy for a state with quantum number $k$.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential (or Fermi energy at zero temperature).\n*   $\\theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function: it is 1 if $x > 0$ and 0 if $x < 0$.\n*   $\\delta$ is a positive infinitesimal.\n\nThe first term represents the propagation of a particle into an empty state ($\\epsilon_k > \\mu$), and the second term represents the propagation of a \"hole\" (i.e., the removal of a particle) from an occupied state ($\\epsilon_k < \\mu$).\n\nIn essence, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$, with a small imaginary shift that depends on the particle's occupation relative to the Fermi sea.\n\nThe following Python code will print this fundamental equation piece by piece.\n\n```python\ndef print_green_function_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the equation for the bare Green's function G_0\n    as a function of frequency (ω) and single-particle energy (ϵ_k).\n    The equation is constructed and printed part by part.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Using Unicode for better readability of Greek letters\n    omega = \"ω\"\n    epsilon_k = \"ϵₖ\"\n    mu = \"µ\"\n    delta = \"δ\"\n    theta = \"θ\"\n\n    # Print the equation part by part to meet the output requirements\n    # \"G₀(ω, ϵₖ) = \"\n    print(\"G₀({0}, {1}) = \".format(omega, epsilon_k), end=\"\")\n\n    # First term: Particle propagator (for states above the Fermi level)\n    # \"θ(ϵₖ - µ)\"\n    print(\"{0}({1} - {2})\".format(theta, epsilon_k, mu), end=\"\")\n    # \" / \"\n    print(\" / \", end=\"\")\n    # \"(ω - ϵₖ + iδ)\"\n    print(\"({0} - {1} + i{2})\".format(omega, epsilon_k, delta), end=\"\")\n\n    # Separator\n    # \" + \"\n    print(\" + \", end=\"\")\n\n    # Second term: Hole propagator (for states below the Fermi level)\n    # \"θ(µ - ϵₖ)\"\n    print(\"{0}({1} - {2})\".format(theta, mu, epsilon_k), end=\"\")\n    # \" / \"\n    print(\" / \", end=\"\")\n    # \"(ω - ϵₖ - iδ)\"\n    print(\"({0} - {1} - i{2})\".format(omega, epsilon_k, delta))\n\nprint_green_function_equation()\n```\n\n<<<$G_0(\\omega, \\epsilon_k) = \\frac{\\theta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta} + \\frac{\\theta(\\mu - \\epsilon_k)}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\delta}$>>>"
