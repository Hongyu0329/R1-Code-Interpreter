    "To solve this problem, we need to enumerate all possible category structures with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, and then count how many of them are non-isomorphic.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Category Structure**: A category with 2 objects, say A and B, is defined by the sets of morphisms `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)`, and the composition rules.\n2.  **Account for Identity Morphisms**: Any category must have identity morphisms `id_A` in `Hom(A, A)` and `id_B` in `Hom(B, B)`. This uses up 2 of the 4 available morphisms.\n3.  **Distribute Remaining Morphisms**: We have 2 non-identity morphisms left to distribute among the four `Hom` sets. We will find all possible ways to partition the number 2 into four non-negative integers, which correspond to the counts of non-identity morphisms in each `Hom` set.\n4.  **Analyze Each Distribution**: For each distribution of morphisms, we need to determine how many valid, non-isomorphic category structures can be defined. This involves:\n    *   Defining the composition of morphisms. The composition must be associative.\n    *   The number of structures depends on the number of ways to define composition tables (monoid structures for `Hom(X,X)`) and compositions between different `Hom` sets, while satisfying associativity.\n5.  **Group by Isomorphism**: An isomorphism between categories can swap the objects A and B. This means a distribution of morphisms `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)` might lead to categories that are isomorphic to those from the distribution `(n_BB, n_BA, n_AB, n_AA)`. We will group the distributions accordingly and count the unique categories from each group.\n6.  **Sum the results**: The total number of categories is the sum of the counts of non-isomorphic categories from each distribution group.\n\nThis counting process relies on some known results from algebra, specifically the number of non-isomorphic monoids of small orders:\n*   There is 1 non-isomorphic monoid of order 1.\n*   There are 2 non-isomorphic monoids of order 2.\n*   There are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nThe following Python script systematically implements this plan to calculate the total number of non-isomorphic categories.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of non-isomorphic monoids of a given order is a known mathematical result.\n    # We use these known values for our calculation.\n    # Order of Hom(X, X) determines the monoid structure.\n    num_monoids = {\n        1: 1,  # Trivial monoid {id}\n        2: 2,  # Z_2 group, and another where the non-identity element is idempotent\n        3: 7,\n    }\n\n    # We have 4 morphisms in total. 2 are identities (id_A, id_B).\n    # We need to distribute the 2 remaining non-identity morphisms.\n    # Let n_aa, n_ab, n_ba, n_bb be the counts of non-identity morphisms\n    # in Hom(A,A), Hom(A,B), Hom(B,A), Hom(B,B) respectively.\n    # We need to find non-negative integer solutions to n_aa + n_ab + n_ba + n_bb = 2.\n    \n    # Let's list the 10 solutions (distributions of non-identity morphisms):\n    distributions = [\n        (2, 0, 0, 0), (0, 2, 0, 0), (0, 0, 2, 0), (0, 0, 0, 2),\n        (1, 1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1, 0),\n        (0, 1, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1, 1)\n    ]\n    \n    # Group distributions by isomorphism (swapping objects A and B).\n    # A distribution d = (n_aa, n_ab, n_ba, n_bb) is in the same group as\n    # d_swap = (n_bb, n_ba, n_ab, n_aa).\n    # We use a sorted tuple of (d, d_swap) as a unique key for each group.\n    groups = collections.OrderedDict()\n    for dist in distributions:\n        swapped_dist = (dist[3], dist[2], dist[1], dist[0])\n        key = tuple(sorted((dist, swapped_dist)))\n        if key not in groups:\n            groups[key] = dist  # Store a representative for the group\n\n    # For each group, we calculate the number of non-isomorphic categories.\n    # This is done by analyzing the composition rules for the representative distribution.\n    # The comments explain the reasoning for each case.\n    \n    total_categories = 0\n    print(\"Calculating categories for each distribution group:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Case 1: dist=(2,0,0,0).
