# The problem is solved through symbolic derivation. The final answer is a constant.
# This code calculates the value of that constant.

# The minimum ratio is found to be 9 * pi * (3 + 2 * sqrt(3)).
# Here, we will calculate this value.

# Define the components of the equation
nine = 9
pi = math.pi
three = 3
two = 2
sqrt_3 = math.sqrt(3)

# Print the formula as requested
print("The formula for the minimum ratio is:")
print(f"{nine} * pi * ({three} + {two} * sqrt(3))")
print("-" * 30)

# Calculate the result
result = nine * pi * (three + two * sqrt_3)

# Print the final numerical answer
print("The calculated minimum ratio is:")
print(result)

# The result is approximately 182.78
# So we can output this answer in the required format.
# Rounding to 2 decimal places for clarity, although the exact value is what's calculated.
answer_val = 9 * math.pi * (3 + 2 * math.sqrt(3))
<<<round(answer_val, 2)>>>
