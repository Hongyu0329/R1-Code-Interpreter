    Solves the topology problem by logical deduction.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block
    points in an aposyndetic continuum X.

    Let's break down the logic:

    1. Definitions Recap:
        - Continuum (X): A compact, connected, Hausdorff space.
        - Aposyndetic (X): For any two distinct points x, y in X, there exists a
          subcontinuum K such that x is in the interior of K, and K does not contain y.
        - Non-block point (p): A point p in X such that X \\ {p} contains a dense
          continuum-connected subset.

    2. Key Insight: Relating Aposyndetic to Non-block Points.
        A key theorem in continuum theory (by F. B. Jones) states that if a continuum X
        is aposyndetic, then for any point p in X, the resulting subspace X \\ {p}
        is not just connected, but is continuum-connected.

    3. Consequence for Non-block Points:
        - If X \\ {p} is continuum-connected, it serves as its own dense subset.
        - Therefore, for any p in an aposyndetic continuum X, the condition for p being
          a non-block point is satisfied.
        - This means that *every* point in an aposyndetic continuum is a non-block point.
        - So, the set of non-block points is the entire space X itself.

    4. Reframing the Question:
        The problem is now reduced to finding the minimum possible cardinality of an
        aposyndetic continuum X.

    5. Finding the Minimum Cardinality:
        - A continuum, being a topological space, must be a non-empty set.
        - Thus, its cardinality must be at least 1.
        - Let's consider the smallest possible case: a space X with just one point, say X = {p}.

    6. Verifying the One-Point Space:
        a) Is X = {p} a continuum?
           - Compact: Yes, any finite space is compact.
           - Connected: Yes, it cannot be partitioned into two non-empty disjoint open sets.
           - Hausdorff: Yes, the condition is vacuously satisfied.
           So, a one-point space is a continuum.

        b) Is X = {p} aposyndetic?
           - The condition for being aposyndetic is: "for every two *distinct* points x, y...".
           - In a space with only one point, there are no distinct points.
           - Therefore, the condition is vacuously true. X = {p} is aposyndetic.

    7. Final Conclusion:
        - We have found an aposyndetic continuum, X = {p}, with cardinality 1.
        - The set of non-block points in this space is X itself, which is {p}.
        - The cardinality of this set is 1.
        - Since the cardinality cannot be less than 1, the smallest possible cardinality is 1.
