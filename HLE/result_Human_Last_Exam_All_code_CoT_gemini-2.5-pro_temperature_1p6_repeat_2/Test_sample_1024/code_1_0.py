# The final answer is determined by solving a three-part literary puzzle
# and adhering to a mathematical constraint.

# Part (A): The allusion is to "The Adventure of the Priory School,"
# where the key track-based deception involves fake cow tracks.
answer_A = 6

# Part (B): The theme highlighted by the inaccurate allusion is one of
# education vs mis-education, a central dynamic of "Pale Fire". This
# choice is confirmed by the mathematical constraint.
answer_B = 3

# Part (C): Nabokov's most intense experience with "intricate back-referencing"
# was his massive scholarly work on Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin".
answer_C = 7

# The sum of the answers must be a multiple of 8.
total = answer_A + answer_B + answer_C

# Print the final answer as three numbers, as requested.
print(f"{answer_A} {answer_B} {answer_C}")

# Also print the equation to show the fulfillment of the mathematical constraint.
print(f"The numbers add to a multiple of 8:")
print(f"{answer_A} + {answer_B} + {answer_C} = {total}")
