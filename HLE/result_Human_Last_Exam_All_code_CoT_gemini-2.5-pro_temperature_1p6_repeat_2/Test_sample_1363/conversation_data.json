    "My plan is to solve this knowledge-based question by encoding the technical rules of each dance into a data structure. The core of the question is about identifying which dance has a fundamental technique that stops rotation during a Reverse Turn, thereby making an \"overturn\" (turning more than the standard amount) a technical violation.\n\n1.  **Create a Data Structure:** I will use a Python dictionary to store information about each of the five standard ballroom dances listed in the options.\n2.  **Encode the Key Technique:** For each dance, I will store a \"violation score\". A score of `1` will represent that overturning a reverse turn is a technical violation, and `0` will mean it is technically allowed. The defining characteristic is whether the feet close (stopping rotation) or pass (allowing continuous rotation).\n3.  **Identify the Answer:** The code will iterate through this data structure to find the dance with a violation score of `1`.\n4.  **Provide Output:** The script will print the name of the dance, the reasoning behind the answer, and a final \"equation\" to satisfy the prompt's requirements by showing the violation score.\n\n```python\ndef find_dance_answer():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballroom dance techniques to answer a specific question about reverse turns.\n\n    The function encodes technical rules for each dance into a dictionary and then\n    searches for the dance where overturning a reverse turn is impossible\n    without violating its core technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Data structure with dance techniques.\n    # A score of '1' means overturning is a technical violation.\n    # A score of '0' means it is technically permissible.\n    dance_techniques = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Viennese Waltz',\n            'overturn_violation_score': 0,\n            'reasoning': \"This is a rotational dance, but its sway and continuous nature do not fundamentally prohibit overturning figures.\"\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'name': 'English Waltz',\n            'overturn_violation_score': 0,\n            'reasoning': \"This is a sway dance where the feet pass each other, allowing for continuous rotation.
