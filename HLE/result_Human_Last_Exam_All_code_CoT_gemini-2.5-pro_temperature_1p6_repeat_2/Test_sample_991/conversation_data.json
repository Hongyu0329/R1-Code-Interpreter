    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle. Let's solve it by deconstructing the visual clues provided.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **\"A wooden stick\"**: This directly points to the Chinese character or radical for wood/tree, which is **木** (mù).\n2.  **\"a square box\"**: This describes the character for mouth or an enclosure, which is **口** (kǒu).\n3.  **\"a ladder placed in the center\"**: A ladder has rungs. A simple representation of a ladder or a single rung inside the \"square box\" (口) would be a horizontal line (一). When you place a line inside the box, you get the character for sun, **日** (rì).\n4.  **\"hanging a square box\"**: Now we combine the parts. The phrase suggests that the \"box with the ladder\" (日) is placed in the middle of the \"wooden stick\" (木), as if it's hanging on its trunk.\n5.  **Assembly**: Placing 日 into the center of 木 gives us the character **東** (dōng). This character means \"East\" and is famously depicted as the sun (日) rising behind a tree (木).\n\nI will now write a Python script to print out this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_character_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution to the Chinese character riddle.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Riddle: A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Solving the Riddle Step-by-Step ---\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: The wooden stick\n    part1 = \"木\"\n    explanation1 = \"The 'wooden stick' refers to the character for wood/tree.\"\n    print(f\"Part 1: {explanation1} -> {part1}\")\n\n    # Step 2: The box with a ladder\n    part2 = \"日\"\n    explanation2 = \"A 'square box' (口) with a 'ladder' (a line inside) makes the character for sun.\"\n    print(f\"Part 2: {explanation2} -> {part2}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Combine the parts\n    final_character = \"東\"\n    explanation3 = f\"Placing the sun '{part2}' in the middle of the tree '{part1}' gives the final character.\"\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Assembly: {explanation3}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe full character is: \" + final_character)\n    print(\"\\nThis character, 東 (dōng), means East, depicting the sun rising through a tree.\")\n\nsolve_character_riddle()\n```\n<<<東>>>"
