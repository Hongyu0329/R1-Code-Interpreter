# The problem describes Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) attacks and potential mitigations.
# The MITRE ATT&CK framework assigns unique identifiers to these concepts.
# T1557 represents the AitM technique.
# M1041 represents a general cryptographic mitigation.
# The following code presents these identifiers in a simple equation format
# to fulfill the output requirements, using numbers directly from the problem description.

attack_id = 1557
mitigation_id = 1041

# This "equation" symbolically represents the relationship between the specific attack and a general mitigation category mentioned in the prompt.
print(f"Attack Technique ID: {attack_id}")
print(f"Mitigation Category ID: {mitigation_id}")
