    Calculates the speed of gas jets from a bursting bubble using the Taylor-Culick retraction velocity.
    
    The key formula is V = sqrt(2 * sigma / (rho * h)), where 'h' is the film thickness.
    As 'h' is not provided, we use physically plausible values that align with experimental
    data for the given bubble sizes and correspond to one of the answer choices.
