    print("The point p = (0,0) in L is a 'problem' point. Any neighborhood of p in L is not homeomorphic to an open interval of R (removing p disconnects it into two components, but removing any other point from the neighborhood does not).")
    print("Case 1: Let z = (0,0). The set L \\ {z} is the disjoint union of two open rays: {(x,x) | x > 0} and {(x,-x) | x < 0}. Each ray is homeomorphic to R, so their disjoint union is a smooth 1-manifold.")
