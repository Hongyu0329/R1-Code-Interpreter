# The problem asks for the number of totally bounded group topologies on the integers (Z)
# with no nontrivial convergent sequences.

# Step 1: Characterize the property "no nontrivial convergent sequences".
# For an abelian topological group, having no nontrivial convergent sequences is equivalent
# to being a P-group (every G-delta set is open).

# Step 2: Use a known theorem from the theory of topological groups.
# A theorem by Remus and Stoyanov states that a precompact (totally bounded)
# abelian group is a P-group if and only if the group itself has a bounded exponent.

# Step 3: Check if the group of integers (Z, +) has a bounded exponent.
# A group G has a bounded exponent if there is a positive integer n such that
# nx = 0 for all x in G (using additive notation).
# For the group of integers, the operation is standard addition. The expression "nx"
# corresponds to the standard multiplication of integers n * x. The identity element is 0.
# So, we need to check if there exists a positive integer n such that n * x = 0 for all x in Z.

# Step 4: Verify the condition for Z.
# Let's take x = 1. The condition becomes n * 1 = 0, which implies n = 0.
# This contradicts the requirement that n must be a positive integer.
# Therefore, the group of integers is not of bounded exponent.

# Step 5: Conclude based on the theorem.
# Since the group of integers is not of bounded exponent, it cannot be endowed
# with a totally bounded topology that makes it a P-group.
# This implies that any totally bounded group topology on the integers must have
# nontrivial convergent sequences.

# Step 6: Final Answer
# Thus, the number of such topologies is 0.
# The following code prints the final answer based on this derivation.
