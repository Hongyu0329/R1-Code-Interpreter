    explanation = """
    Let's analyze the properties of the compact topological space X.

    1.  X contains a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, \omega_1).
        This means that X is a compactification of R. A compactification of a
        topological space Y is a compact space K that contains a dense subspace
        homeomorphic to Y.

    2.  Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous
        function on X.
        This is a powerful universal property. It is, in fact, the defining
        property of the Stone-Čech compactification of R, which is denoted by βR.

        The Stone-Čech compactification βY of a Tychonoff space Y is a compact
        Hausdorff space containing Y as a dense subspace, and it is characterized
        by the following property: every continuous map from Y to any compact
        Hausdorff space K can be extended uniquely to a continuous map from βY to K.

        A key theorem states that this is equivalent to the property that every
        bounded continuous real-valued function on Y extends to a unique continuous
        function on βY. This is because any such function f: Y -> R can be seen
        as a map to its codomain's closure, which is a compact subset of R.

        Property (2) states that X satisfies this exact condition for R.
        This implies that the C*-algebra of continuous functions on X, denoted C(X),
        is isomorphic to the C*-algebra of bounded continuous functions on R, C_b(R).

        By the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, two compact Hausdorff spaces are homeomorphic
        if and only if their corresponding C*-algebras of continuous functions are
        isomorphic.

        Since C(X) is isomorphic to C_b(R), and by definition C(βR) is also isomorphic
        to C_b(R), it follows that C(X) is isomorphic to C(βR). Therefore, X must be
        homeomorphic to βR.

    Conclusion:
    Any space X that satisfies the given conditions must be homeomorphic to the
    Stone-Čech compactification of the long ray, βR. Since all such spaces are
    homeomorphic to this specific space, they all belong to the same homeomorphism class.

    Thus, there is only one such homeomorphism class.
