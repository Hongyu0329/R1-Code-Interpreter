    # The question concerns King Philip II Augustus.
    # The "morphing" of the monarchy's stylization refers to the change in title from
    # "King of the Franks" to "King of France", which started around 1190.
    # The source of the monarch's epithet, "Augustus", was his contemporary biographer, Rigord.
    
    # We evaluate the choices to find the one that fits these facts.
    # Choice C provides the year 1223 and the biographer Rigord.
    # 1223 is the year of Philip II's death, marking the end of his reign.
    # Rigord is the correct biographer.
    
    # In line with the prompt's request to "output each number in the final equation",
    # we will print the numerical and text components of the correct answer.
