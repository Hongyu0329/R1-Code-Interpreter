    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum possible density `c` for a set `A` subset of `{1, ..., N}` such that the sumset `A+A` contains no perfect squares.\n\n### Method\n\nThis type of problem in additive combinatorics is often approached using modular arithmetic. The strategy is as follows:\n1.  Choose a modulus `m`.\n2.  Identify the set of quadratic residues modulo `m`, which we'll call `S_m`. These are the values `k^2 mod m` for all integers `k`.\n3.  Construct our set `A` by picking elements that belong to a specific set of residue classes `R` modulo `m`. That is, `A = {n <= N | n mod m ∈ R}`.\n4.  If `a` and `b` are in `A`, then `a ≡ r1 (mod m)` and `b ≡ r2 (mod m)` for some `r1, r2 ∈ R`.\n5.  Their sum is `a+b ≡ r1+r2 (mod m)`. For `a+b` to never be a square number, we must ensure that `r1+r2 (mod m)` is never a quadratic residue for any pair `r1, r2` from `R`.\n6.  This gives the condition that the sumset `R+R = {r1+r2 mod m | r1,r2 ∈ R}` must not intersect with the set of squares `S_m`.\n7.  If we find such a set `R`, the density of our set `A` is `|A|/N ≈ |R|/m`. Our goal is to maximize this ratio `c = |R|/m`.\n\nThis problem now becomes a search for the best pair `(m, R)` that maximizes `|R|/m`. For a given `m`, finding the largest possible `R` is a variation of the maximum clique problem on a graph.\n\n*   The vertices of the graph are the residues `{0, 1, ..., m-1}`.\n*   We want to find a maximum subset of vertices `R` (a clique) where for every pair of vertices `u, v` in `R` (including `u=v`), the sum `u+v mod m` is not a quadratic residue.\n\n### Python Code\n\nThe following Python code implements this search. It iterates through moduli `m` up to 35. For each `m`, it calculates the set of quadratic residues and then uses a backtracking algorithm (a standard method for finding a maximum clique) to find the largest possible set `R`. It keeps track of the best ratio `c = |R|/m` found. The code will print the best values as it discovers them.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest c by searching for the best modulus m and residue set R.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a higher recursion limit for the backtracking search\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n    max_c = 0\n    best_m = 0\n    best_R_size = 0\n    best_R = []\n\n    # Search for the best modulus m up to 35\n    for m in range(3, 36):\n        squares = {(i * i) % m for i in range(m)}\n\n        # The max clique algorithm will be applied to a graph.\n        # Vertices: The residues {0, ..., m-1}.\n        # A set of vertices R is a clique if for all u, v in R (including u=v),\n        # the sum u+v (mod m) is not a square.\n\n        # Let's define the graph for the max clique algorithm.\n        # An edge exists between u and v if their sum is not a square.\n        # A clique also requires that each vertex has a \"self-loop\" (u+u is not a square).\n        \n        adj = [[False] * m for _ in range(m)]\n        nodes_with_self_loops = []\n\n        for i in range(m):\n            # Check for self-loop condition: i+i must not be a square\n            if (i + i) % m not in squares:\n                nodes_with_self_loops.append(i)\n\n        for i in range(len(nodes_with_self_loops)):\n            for j in range(i, len(nodes_with_self_loops)):\n                u = nodes_with_self_loops[i]\n                v = nodes_with_self_loops[j]\n                if (u + v) % m not in squares:\n                    # Graph is on the original indices {0..m-1}, but we only need\n                    # the adjacency info for the valid nodes.\n                    # Here, adj is just conceptual.
