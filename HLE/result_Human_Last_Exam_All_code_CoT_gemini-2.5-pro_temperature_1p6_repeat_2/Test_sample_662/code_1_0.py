# Define the known variables from the problem description
R0 = 3.0  # Basic Reproduction Number
breakthrough_infection_rate = 0.06  # 6% of vaccinated people get the infection

# --- Step 1: Calculate the vaccine's efficacy (VE) ---
# Efficacy is 100% minus the failure rate.
vaccine_efficacy = 1 - breakthrough_infection_rate

# --- Step 2: Calculate the required herd immunity threshold (H) ---
# This is the proportion of the population that must be immune.
herd_immunity_threshold = 1 - (1 / R0)

# --- Step 3: Calculate the required vaccine coverage (Vc) ---
# This adjusts the immunity threshold based on the vaccine's efficacy.
# Vc = H / VE
required_vaccine_coverage = herd_immunity_threshold / vaccine_efficacy

# --- Final Output ---
