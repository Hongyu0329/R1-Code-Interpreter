    "Of course, I can help you with this. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor ($d=53599$)**: First, find the prime factorization of the conductor $d$. This is crucial to understand the structure of the group of Dirichlet characters. The properties of primitive characters are simplest when the conductor is square-free (not divisible by any perfect square other than 1).\n2.  **Understand Primitive Characters**: For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is *primitive* if and only if its decomposition into characters for each prime factor, $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, consists of only non-trivial characters. This means the order of each component character $\\chi_i$ must be greater than 1.\n3.  **Relate Character Order to Component Orders**: The order of the composite character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$. We need this lcm to be 6.\n4.  **Count Component Characters**: For each prime factor $p_i$ of $d$, we need to count how many characters $\\chi_i$ exist for each possible order. The number of characters of order $k$ modulo a prime $p$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n5.  **Use Inclusion-Exclusion to Find the Final Count**: We need to find the number of combinations of component characters such that their orders are non-trivial divisors of 6, and their lcm is exactly 6.\n    *   First, we'll count all combinations of non-trivial component characters whose orders divide 6.\n    *   Then, we'll subtract the combinations where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., lcm divides 2 or lcm divides 3).\n    *   The final result gives us the number of valid combinations, which corresponds to the number of primitive characters of order 6.\n\nThis step-by-step process leads to the final answer. The following Python code implements this logic.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        if temp % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            while temp % d == 0:\n                temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors.append(temp)\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef solve_dirichlet_problem(d, g):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given square-free\n    conductor d and order g.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for conductor d = {d} and order g = {g}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the conductor d\n    prime_factors_d = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    print(f\"1.
