    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a breakdown of the steps to solve the integral, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Split the Integral**: The function `p(x)` is defined in two pieces. The integral from 0 to 4 must be split at the point where the function definition changes, which is at `x = 3`. This gives us two separate integrals to solve:\n    *   Part 1: $\\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{2x^3}{8} dx$\n    *   Part 2: $\\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x} dx$\n\n2.  **Analyze Part 1**: The first integral is a standard polynomial integral, which can be solved analytically and numerically.\n    *   $\\int \\frac{2x^3}{8} dx = \\int \\frac{x^3}{4} dx = \\frac{x^4}{16}$\n    *   Evaluating from 0 to 3 gives $\\frac{3^4}{16} - \\frac{0^4}{16} = \\frac{81}{16} = 5.0625$.\n\n3.  **Analyze Part 2**: The second integral is more complex. We need to check the integrand for any issues within the integration range [3, 4].\n    *   The denominator of the function is `1 + cos(x)`. This term becomes zero when `cos(x) = -1`, which occurs at `x = π, 3π, ...`.\n    *   The value `x = π` (approximately 3.14159) lies within the integration interval [3, 4].\n    *   At `x = π`, the function is undefined, creating a vertical asymptote. This means the integral is improper.\n    *   An analysis of the function's behavior near `x = π` shows that the integral does not converge to a finite value; it **diverges**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Since the second part of the integral diverges, the total integral from 0 to 4 also diverges and cannot be represented by a finite number.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will provide a Python script that calculates the value of the first integral and then demonstrates that the second integral is divergent using the `scipy.integrate.quad` function, which is the standard way to compute definite integrals numerically in Python. The code will print out a step-by-step explanation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\nimport warnings\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the definite integral of the piecewise function p(x) from 0 to 4.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Part 1: Integral from 0 to 3 ---\n    def p1(x):\n        return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\n    # Analytically, the integral of x^3/4 is x^4/16.\n    # From 0 to 3, this is (3^4)/16 - 0 = 81/16 = 5.0625\n    integral_part1, _ = quad(p1, 0, 3)\n    \n    print(\"The integral is split into two parts: from 0 to 3, and from 3 to 4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Part 1: Integral from x=0 to x=3\")\n    print(\"p(x) = (2 * x^3) / 8\")\n    print(f\"The value of the first integral is: (3^4 / 16) - (0^4 / 16) = {integral_part1:.4f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # --- Part 2: Integral from 3 to 4 ---\n    def p2(x):\n        return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n    print(\"Part 2: Integral from x=3 to x=4\")\n    print(\"p(x) = (e^x * (1 + sin(x))) / (1 + cos(x))\")\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis of Part 2:\")\n    print(\"The denominator (1 + cos(x)) is 0 when x = pi (approx. 3.14159).\")\n    print(\"Since pi is within the integration interval [3, 4], the function has a singularity.\")\n    print(\"We test for convergence.
