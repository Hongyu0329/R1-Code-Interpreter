    "To determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the weights and variables:** The ambient space is defined by the weights `w = (w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)` for the variables `z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, z_5`.\n2.  **Determine the degree `d` of the polynomial:** A Calabi-Yau manifold defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial has the property that the weighted degree, `d`, is the same for all its monomials. We can calculate this degree from any monomial. For instance, for the monomial `$z_5^3$`, the degree is `3 * w_5 = 3 * 75 = 225`. (We note that almost all monomials in the given equation have this degree, confirming `d=225`).\n3.  **Apply the Calabi-Yau condition:** For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the degree `d` must equal the sum of the weights `Σw_i`. Let's verify: `Σw_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`. Since `d=225`, the condition is met.\n4.  **Calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant `c`:** The invariant is defined by the formula `c = d - Σw_i`.\n5.  **Construct the final equation:** We will substitute the calculated values of `d`, `Σw_i`, and `c` into the formula and print the result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n    The invariant is given by c = d - sum(w_i), where d is the weighted degree\n    of the defining polynomial and w_i are the weights of the variables.\n    For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the condition d = sum(w_i) must hold.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
