# For the given problem, we analyze each part to determine the answer.

# (a) Can F and G contain multisets with disjoint supports if they are sum maximal cross 1-intersecting families?
# The definition of cross 1-intersecting is that for any F in F and G in G, |F \cap G| >= 1.
# If a multiset F and a multiset G have disjoint supports, they have no elements in common.
# This means their intersection is empty, so |F \cap G| = 0.
# This violates the cross 1-intersecting condition. Therefore, this is not possible.
answer_a = "No"

# (b) If k = 2 and m = 5, what is |F| + |G| for sum maximal cross 1-intersecting families?
# We use the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem for cross-intersecting multiset families.
# For m >= k+1, the maximum sum |F| + |G| is 2 * |S_i|, where S_i is a "star" family
# (the family of all k-multisets containing a fixed element i).
# The size of a star family is C(m + k - 2, k - 1).
m = 5
k = 2
if m >= k + 1:
    # Size of the star family S_i
    size_of_star = math.comb(m + k - 2, k - 1)
    # The maximum sum is 2 * |S_i|
    max_sum = 2 * size_of_star
    answer_b = max_sum

    print("Calculation for part (b):")
    print(f"Given m = {m} and k = {k}, we find the maximum sum |F| + |G|.")
    print("The maximum is achieved when F and G are identical 'star' families.")
    print(f"The size of a star family is C(m+k-2, k-1) = C({m}+{k}-2, {k}-1) = C({m+k-2}, {k-1}).")
    print(f"This evaluates to: {size_of_star}")
    print(f"The maximum sum is twice this size. The final equation is:")
    print(f"2 * {size_of_star} = {max_sum}")


# (c) Must F necessarily contain all k-multisets that include a fixed element to achieve maximality?
# The characterization of the extremal case of the theorem states that for m >= k+1,
# the maximum sum is achieved if and only if F = G = S_i for some fixed element i.
# S_i is the family of ALL k-multisets that contain element i.
# Thus, to achieve maximality, F must be exactly such a family.
