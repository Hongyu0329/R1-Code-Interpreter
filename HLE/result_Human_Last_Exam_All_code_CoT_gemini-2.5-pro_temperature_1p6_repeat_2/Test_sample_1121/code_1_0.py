# --- Plan Step 1: Define parameters for each scenario ---

# Scenario 1: "Simulation of implementation" with a distance-3 code.
# This is modeled as implementing a single logical Toffoli gate.
d1 = 3
# Number of logical T-gates (non-Clifford) for one Toffoli gate.
logical_gates_d1 = 7

# Scenario 2: "Implementation" with a distance-5 code.
# This is modeled as running Shor's algorithm for a 2048-bit integer.
d2 = 5
# Approximate number of logical T-gates for Shor's-2048.
logical_gates_d2 = 4 * (10**8)

# --- Plan Step 2 & 3: Calculate the number of physical non-Clifford gates ---

# The overhead (number of physical gates per logical gate) is assumed to scale with d^2.
# Formula: Total_Gates = Num_Logical_Gates * (d^2)

# Calculation for the distance-3 scenario
gates_d3 = logical_gates_d1 * (d1**2)

# Calculation for the distance-5 scenario
gates_d5 = logical_gates_d2 * (d2**2)

# The total number is the sum of gates from both scenarios.
total_gates = gates_d3 + gates_d5

# --- Final Output ---
# The problem asks for the approximate total number. We will show the components of the sum.
