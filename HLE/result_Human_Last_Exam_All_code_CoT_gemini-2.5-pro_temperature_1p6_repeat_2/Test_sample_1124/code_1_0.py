    Modifies the logistic map to create a stable equilibrium point at R=3.57.

    The standard logistic map X_n+1 = R * X_n * (1 - X_n) is chaotic at R=3.57.
    We propose a modified map: X_n+1 = (R/sqrt(3)) * X_n - X_n^2.

    This can be rewritten as X_n+1 = k * X_n - X_n^2, where k = R / sqrt(3).
    The equilibrium point X_eq is found by solving X = k*X - X^2, which
    yields the non-zero solution X_eq = k - 1.

    The stability of this point depends on the derivative f'(X) = k - 2X.
    At X_eq, the derivative is f'(X_eq) = k - 2(k-1) = 2 - k. The point is
    stable if |2 - k| < 1, which means 1 < k < 3.
