# The problem simplifies to the integral of (|2*sin(x)*cos(3x)|)^50 from 0 to pi.
# This evaluates to 2^50 * Integral(sin(x)^50 * cos(3x)^50) from 0 to pi.
# A known identity states that for an integer n >= 0:
# Integral(sin(x)^(2n) * cos(3x)^(2n)) dx from 0 to pi is pi * C(2n, n) / 2^(4n-1)
# where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient "n choose k".

# In our problem, 2n = 50, so n = 25.
n = 25
power_of_2_in_identity = 4 * n - 1
# The integral part is C(50, 25) * pi / 2**99

# The total integral is 2**50 times the above value.
initial_power_of_2 = 50
final_power_of_2 = power_of_2_in_identity - initial_power_of_2

# The final answer is C(50, 25) * pi / 2**(99-50) = C(50, 25) * pi / 2**49

# Since we need to output the equation's numbers, let's list them.
# The final equation for the integral value is (50! / (25! * 25!)) * pi / 2**49
