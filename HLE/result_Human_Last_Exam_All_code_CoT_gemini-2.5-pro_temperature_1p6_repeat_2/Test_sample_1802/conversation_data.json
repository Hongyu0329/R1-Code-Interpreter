    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n1.  **Relating the Channel and its Complement:** A fundamental theorem in quantum information theory states that the rank of any quantum channel is equal to the rank of its complementary channel. Therefore, the problem of finding the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is equivalent to finding the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ itself.\n\n2.  **Pauli Channel Definition:** A Pauli channel for a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit) is defined by its action on a density matrix $\\rho$ as:\n    $$\n    \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{j,k} U_{jk} \\rho U_{jk}^\\dagger\n    $$\n    Here, $\\{U_{jk} = X^j Z^k\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators), which form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $\\{p_{j,k}\\}$ form a probability distribution, meaning $p_{j,k} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{j,k} p_{j,k} = 1$.\n\n3.  **Rank of a Quantum Channel:** The rank of a quantum channel is defined as the number of linearly independent Kraus operators in any of its operational-sum representations. For the Pauli channel described above, the Kraus operators are $\\{ K_{jk} = \\sqrt{p_{j,k}} U_{jk} \\}$.\n\n4.  **Finding the Maximal Rank:** The set of $d^2$ operators $\\{U_{jk}\\}$ is linearly independent. This means that the linear independence of the Kraus operators $\\{K_{jk}\\}$ depends solely on whether the coefficients $\\sqrt{p_{j,k}}$ are zero or non-zero. The rank of the channel $\\Lambda$ is therefore equal to the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{j,k}$.\n\n5.  **Maximization:** To maximize the rank, we need to maximize the number of non-zero coefficients $p_{j,k}$. The total number of such coefficients is $d^2$. We can choose all $d^2$ coefficients to be positive while still satisfying the normalization condition $\\sum_{j,k} p_{j,k} = 1$. For example, we can choose $p_{j,k} = 1/d^2$ for all $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$. This choice corresponds to the completely depolarizing channel.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** With all $d^2$ probabilities $p_{j,k}$ being positive, we have $d^2$ non-zero Kraus operators. Since the underlying operators $\\{U_{jk}\\}$ are linearly independent, the $d^2$ Kraus operators are also linearly independent. Thus, the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$. Consequently, the maximal rank of its complementary channel is also $d^2$.\n\n### Python Implementation\nThe problem asks for the maximal rank for a \"qudit,\" which has a general dimension $d$. To provide a concrete numerical answer, the following Python code uses the dimension $d=3$ (a qutrit) as a representative example.\n\n```python\n# The dimension of the qudit is denoted by 'd'.\n# The problem is posed for a general qudit, so 'd' is not specified.\n# To provide a concrete numerical result, we will use d=3 (a qutrit)\n# as an illustrative example.\nd = 3\n\n# As derived in the explanation, the maximal rank of a Pauli channel\n# for a d-dimensional system is d^2.\n# The rank of a channel and its complementary channel are the same.\n# So, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is also d^2.\nmaximal_rank = d * d\n\nprint(f\"For a qudit of dimension d = {d}, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel is d^2.\")\nprint(\"The calculation for our example (d=3) is:\")\n\n# We print the final equation with each number.\n# The numbers in the equation d * d = maximal_rank are d, d, and maximal_rank.\nprint(f\"{d} * {d} = {maximal_rank}\")\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"
