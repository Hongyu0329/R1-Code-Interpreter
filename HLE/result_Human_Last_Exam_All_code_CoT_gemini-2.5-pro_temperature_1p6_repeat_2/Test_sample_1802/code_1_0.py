# The dimension of the qudit is denoted by 'd'.
# The problem is posed for a general qudit, so 'd' is not specified.

# as an illustrative example.
d = 3

# As derived in the explanation, the maximal rank of a Pauli channel
# for a d-dimensional system is d^2.
# The rank of a channel and its complementary channel are the same.
# So, the maximal rank of the complementary channel is also d^2.
maximal_rank = d * d
