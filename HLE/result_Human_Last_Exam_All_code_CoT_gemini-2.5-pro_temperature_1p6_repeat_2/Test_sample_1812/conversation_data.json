    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix. The context about the \"Markov quiver\" is additional information that specifies the origin of the matrix, but the core task remains the calculation of the determinant for the matrix A provided.\n\nI will use Python with the NumPy library for this purpose, as it is well-suited for matrix operations. To ensure clarity and fulfill the request to show the calculation, I will also print the step-by-step expansion of the determinant calculation formula with the values from the matrix.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  Define the matrix `A` using NumPy.\n2.  Use the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix to create a detailed output string. The formula is: `det = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n3.  Calculate the determinant using NumPy's `linalg.det` function for accuracy.\n4.  Print the given matrix, the formula with substituted values, the intermediate steps, and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The matrix is given as:\n    # A = [[2, -1, -1],\n    #      [-1, 2, -1],\n    #      [-1, -1, 2]]\n    # The reference to m_{1/2} = 13 is context for the origin of the matrix,\n    # and does not change the matrix itself.\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The given matrix A is:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]] is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n    # Calculate determinant using the formula to show the steps\n    term1_val = e * i - f * h\n    term2_val = d * i - f * g\n    term3_val = d * h - e * g\n\n    det_val = a * term1_val - b * term2_val + c * term3_val\n\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the values from matrix A into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * ({term1_val}) - ({b}) * ({term2_val}) + ({c}) * ({term3_val})\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = ({a * term1_val}) - ({b * term2_val}) + ({c * term3_val})\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {a * term1_val - b * term2_val + c * term3_val}\")\n    \n    # Also compute with numpy for verification\n    det_A_numpy = np.linalg.det(A)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe final computed determinant is: {int(round(det_A_numpy))}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
