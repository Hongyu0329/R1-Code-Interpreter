# The user wants to identify the false statement from a list of choices.
# Let's analyze the logic to find the incorrect statement.

# Premise 1: CA biotype is adapted to watermelon and does well on a raffinose-rich diet.
# Premise 2: MA biotype is adapted to cotton and does well on a sucrose-only diet.
# Premise 3: Galactosidase is the enzyme to metabolize raffinose.
# Premise 4: In a host transfer, CA moves to cotton (low raffinose, high sucrose) and MA moves to watermelon (high raffinose).

    # Choice A: CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.
    analysis_A = "Statement A is TRUE. The text states CA thrives on a raffinose-rich diet while MA thrives on a sucrose-only diet, indicating CA is better adapted to metabolize RFOs (like raffinose)."
    print("A. " + analysis_A)

    # Choice B: CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.
    analysis_B = "Statement B is TRUE. This is a direct restatement of the information given in the text, where 'did well on' implies preference or adaptation."
    print("B. " + analysis_B)

    # Choice C: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.
    analysis_C = "Statement C is TRUE. CA aphids move to cotton, which lacks their primary food source, raffinose. The absence of the substrate (raffinose) is the most direct cause for the organism to reduce the production of the enzyme (galactosidase) that digests it."
    print("C. " + analysis_C)

    # Choice D: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.
    analysis_D = "Statement D is NOT TRUE. While the outcome (decreased galactosidase activity) is correct, the reason provided ('owing to higher glucose levels') is a secondary and unconfirmed mechanism. The primary cause, as stated in C, is the lack of the enzyme's substrate (raffinose). The text does not provide evidence to support glucose-based repression as the cause, making this statement's reasoning flawed and unsubstantiated."
    print("D. " + analysis_D)
    
    # Choice E: Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.
    analysis_E = "Statement E is likely TRUE. When the MA biotype encounters a new potential food source (raffinose) in watermelon, a plausible adaptive response is to increase the production of the enzyme needed to digest it (enzyme induction). The text's mention of 'differentially affected' metabolism supports the idea that such changes occur."
