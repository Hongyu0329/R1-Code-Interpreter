    This function prints the formulas for the total DC steady-state free charges as given in the most plausible answer choice.
    
    The detailed derivation shows that the provided options are internally inconsistent, as they violate the charge neutrality principle (q_v + q_s(a) + q_s(b) should be 0).
    However, option B correctly identifies the charge on the outer electrode, q_s(r=b), which is a complex term, suggesting it is the intended answer despite likely typos in the other terms.
