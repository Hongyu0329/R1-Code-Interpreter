    "To find the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ above 2, we need to analyze the clustering of the curve's branch points under the 2-adic valuation $v$ (where $v(2)=1$).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Branch Points:** The branch points of the hyperelliptic curve $z^2 = f(x)$ are the roots of $f(x)=0$ and, if $\\deg(f)$ is odd, the point at infinity.\n2.  **Change of Coordinates:** To analyze the point at infinity along with the finite branch points, we use the coordinate change $x = 1/t$.\n3.  **Analyze Branch Point Valuations:** In the new coordinate system, we will find the valuations of all branch points. The way these valuations cluster determines the structure of the stable reduction.\n4.  **Partition Branch Points:** Based on their valuations, the branch points will be partitioned into sets. A partition into two sets suggests that the stable reduction has two components intersecting at a double point.\n5.  **Calculate Thickness:** The thickness of this double point is given by the 2-adic valuation of the resultant of the two polynomials corresponding to the partition of the branch points.\n6.  **Implement in Python:** Use Python's `sympy` library to perform the resultant calculation and then determine the 2-adic valuation of the result.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  The curve is given by $z^2 = f(x)$ where $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. Since the degree of $f(x)$ is 5 (odd), the point $x=\\infty$ is a branch point.\n2.  Let's change coordinates to $x=1/t$ to bring the point at infinity to $t=0$.\n    $z^2 = 2(1/t)^5 + 2(1/t)^3 + 1 = \\frac{2 + 2t^2 + t^5}{t^5}$.\n    To clear the denominator and get a polynomial model, we define a new variable $w = zt^3$.\n    Then $(w/t^3)^2 = \\frac{t^5 + 2t^2 + 2}{t^5}$, which simplifies to $w^2 = t(t^5 + 2t^2 + 2)$.\n3.  The branch points in the $t$-plane are the roots of $F(t) = t(t^5 + 2t^2 + 2) = 0$.\n    These roots are $t_0=0$ and the five roots of the polynomial $p(t) = t^5 + 2t^2 + 2 = 0$.\n4.  We analyze the 2-adic valuations of these roots.\n    - One root is $t_0=0$.\n    - For the roots of $p(t)$, we can use a Newton polygon. The points for the polygon are $(i, v(c_i))$ where $c_i$ are the coefficients: $(5, v(1)=0)$, $(2, v(2)=1)$, $(0, v(2)=1)$. Analysis of the Newton polygon shows that all five roots of $p(t)$ have a 2-adic valuation of $1/5$.\n5.  This gives a natural partition of the branch points into two sets based on their valuations:\n    -   $B_1 = \\{t_0 = 0\\}$\n    -   $B_2 = \\{t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5\\}$, the roots of $p(t)=0$.\n6.  This partition corresponds to a stable model with two components meeting at a double point. The thickness of this point is the valuation of the resultant of the polynomials defining the partitions.\n    -   $P_1(t) = t$ (for the set $B_1$)\n    -   $P_2(t) = t^5 + 2t^2 + 2$ (for the set $B_2$)\n7.  The thickness is $v(\\text{Res}(P_1, P_2))$. The resultant of $t-a$ and a polynomial $Q(t)$ is $Q(a)$. So, $\\text{Res}(t, t^5+2t^2+2) = (t^5+2t^2+2)|_{t=0} = 2$.\n8.  The final step is to calculate the valuation: thickness = $v(2)$. Given that the valuation is normalized to $v(2)=1$, the thickness is 1.\n\nThe following Python code confirms this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the variable t\n    t = sympy.Symbol('t')\n\n    # The stable reduction analysis leads to partitioning the branch points.\n    # The curve is z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\n    # At infinity (x=1/t), the model is w^2 = t*(t^5 + 2*t^2 + 2).\n    # The branch points are the roots of t*(t^5 + 2*t^2 + 2) = 0.\n    # The valuations of the roots partition the branch points into two sets.\n    # The polynomials for these partitions are:\n    P1 = sympy.Poly(t, t)\n    P2 = sympy.Poly(t**5 + 2*t**2 + 2, t)\n\n    # The thickness of the double point is the valuation of the resultant of these two polynomials.\n    # The valuation v is the 2-adic valuation, normalized so that v(2)=1.\n\n    # Calculate the resultant of P1 and P2\n    res = sympy.resultant(P1, P2)\n\n    # The resultant is an integer. We need to find its 2-adic valuation.\n    # v(n) is the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of n.\n    resultant_val = int(res)\n    \n    if resultant_val == 0:\n      valuation = \"infinity\" # Resultant is non-zero in this case\n    else:\n      temp_val = abs(resultant_val)\n      valuation = 0\n      if temp_val > 0:\n        while temp_val % 2 == 0:\n          valuation += 1\n          temp_val //= 2\n    \n    print(\"The stable reduction is analyzed via its branch points in the t=1/x coordinate.\")\n    print(\"The branch points partition into two sets, corresponding to the polynomials:\")\n    print(f\"P1(t) = {P1.as_expr()}\")\n    print(f\"P2(t) = {P2.as_expr()}\")\n    print(f\"The resultant of P1(t) and P2(t) is: {resultant_val}\")\n    print(\"The thickness of the double point is the 2-adic valuation of this resultant.\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the thickness is:\")\n    print(f\"thickness = v({resultant_val}) = {valuation}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers in the final equation are:\")\n    print(f\"Resultant: {resultant_val}\")\n    print(f\"Thickness (valuation): {valuation}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
