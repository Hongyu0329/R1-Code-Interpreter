    "To determine the VC dimension of the specified class of first-order logic formulas, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Schema and Logic:**\n    *   The schema $S$ contains $4$ unary predicates. Let's call them $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$.\n    *   The allowed logical connectives are existential quantification ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), true ($\\top$), and false ($\\bot$).\n    *   A concept is a set of elements from the domain, defined by a formula with one free variable, say $\\phi(x)$.\n\n2.  **Characterize the Hypothesis Space:**\n    *   The formulas $\\phi(x)$ we can construct must have $x$ as their only free variable.\n    *   The building blocks are the atomic formulas $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$.\n    *   Using conjunction ($\\land$), we can form formulas like $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$.\n    *   The existential quantifier $\\exists$ doesn't introduce new types of concepts depending on $x$. A formula like $\\exists y . P_i(y)$ is a sentence; its truth value is constant across the whole domain. It is either equivalent to $\\top$ (if there is some element satisfying $P_i$) or $\\bot$ (if no element satisfies $P_i$). Therefore, the existential quantifier doesn't increase the complexity of concepts depending on the variable $x$.\n    *   The formulas $\\top$ and $\\bot$ define the concepts that include all elements and no elements, respectively.\n    *   Therefore, the class of concepts we can define corresponds to conjunctions of the atomic predicates. These are known as **positive monomials**. For $n=4$ predicates, example concepts are defined by formulas like $P_2(x)$, $P_1(x) \\land P_4(x)$, and $P_1(x) \\land P_2(x) \\land P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$.\n\n3.  **Determine the VC Dimension:**\n    *   The problem is now reduced to finding the VC dimension of the class of positive monomials over 4 Boolean variables (where each variable corresponds to a predicate).\n    *   It is a standard result in computational learning theory that the VC dimension of the class of positive monomials over $n$ variables is exactly $n$.\n    *   In our case, we have $n=4$ unary predicates (our variables).\n    *   Thus, the VC dimension of this hypothesis space is 4.\n\nThe Python code below will formalize this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_vc_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the VC dimension for the specified First-Order logic fragment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the number of unary predicates in the schema S.\n    # This number is given in the problem statement.\n    num_predicates = 4\n\n    # Step 2: Characterize the hypothesis space.\n    # The logic FO[exists, and, top, bot] over n unary predicates defines\n    # a class of concepts (sets of elements) equivalent to the class of\n    # \"positive monomials\" over n boolean variables.\n    # For example, with predicates P1, P2, a concept could be defined by P1(x) AND P2(x).\n    \n    # Step 3: Use the known result for the VC dimension of positive monomials.\n    # The VC dimension of the class of positive monomials over n variables is n.\n    vc_dimension = num_predicates\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the VC Dimension ---\")\n    print(\"The logical schema S contains a number of unary predicates, denoted as 'n'.\")\n    print(f\"1. Number of predicates (n) = {num_predicates}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe concepts definable by the logic FO[exists, and, top, bot] correspond to the class of positive monomials.\")\n    print(\"2. It is a known result that the VC dimension of positive monomials over n variables is equal to n.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Final Equation ---\")\n    print(\"VC Dimension = n\")\n    print(f\"VC Dimension = {vc_dimension}\")\n\nsolve_vc_dimension()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
