# Given value for T
T = math.log(10**34)

# Calculate e^T, which is simpler as 10^34
e_to_T = 10.0**34

# The final solvability condition relates the initial values (x_0, y_0, z_0)
# to the parameters of the problem.
# The condition is x_0^2 + y_0^2 + z_0^2 = R^2,
# where R^2 can be expressed as 0.5 * (e^(2T) + e^T).

# Calculate each term of the equation for R^2
e_to_2T = e_to_T**2
R_squared = 0.5 * (e_to_2T + e_to_T)

# Calculate R by taking the square root
R = math.sqrt(R_squared)

# As requested, output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation for the initial values is x_0^2 + y_0^2 + z_0^2 = R^2
