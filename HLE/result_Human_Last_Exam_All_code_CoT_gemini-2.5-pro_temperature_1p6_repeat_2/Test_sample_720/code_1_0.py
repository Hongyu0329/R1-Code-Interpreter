    # Introduction to the problem and strategy

    print("This cost is for computing `(F + alpha*I)^(-1) * g`, where F is the d^2 x d^2 Fisher matrix.\n")

    print("Step 1: Analyzing the structure of the Fisher matrix F.")
    print("For a single-layer linear network (y = Wx) with a least-squares loss, F has an exact Kronecker product structure:")

    print("Here, A = (1/n) * sum(x_i * x_i^T) is the d x d input covariance matrix, and I_d is the d x d identity matrix.")
    print("The term 'A' can also be written as A = (1/n) * X * X^T, where X is the d x n data matrix containing the n input samples.")
    print("Because the number of samples n is less than the dimension d (n < d), the rank of matrix A is at most n.\n")

    print("The matrix `A + alpha*I_d` is equal to `(1/n)*X*X^T + alpha*I_d`. This is a sum of a low-rank matrix (rank n) and a scaled identity matrix.")
    print("The Woodbury identity allows us to compute the inverse of this d x d matrix by instead inverting a much smaller n x n matrix (`I_n + (1/(n*alpha)) * X^T*X`).")

    # Step 5: Final Result
    print("Step 5: Determining the dominant term under the given condition n < d.")
