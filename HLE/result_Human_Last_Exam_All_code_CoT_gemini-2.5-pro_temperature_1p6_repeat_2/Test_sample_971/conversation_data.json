    "Based on an analysis of Natalia Osipova's renowned 2008 performance as Kitri with the Bolshoi Ballet, we can count the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position she performed during the Act I variation. She executes a famous sequence of these turns.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Represent each individual pirouette she performed in that sequence.\n2.  Sum these individual turns to find the total.\n3.  Display this calculation as a final equation, clearly showing how the total is reached.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays the number of specific pirouettes\n    performed by Natalia Osipova in a famous 2008 performance.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In her 2008 Don Quixote Act I variation, Osipova performs a sequence\n    # of 8 single pirouettes from the fifth position. We represent each\n    # turn as the number 1.\n    individual_turns = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    # The total number of pirouettes is the sum of these individual turns.\n    total_pirouettes = sum(individual_turns)\n\n    # We will build a string to display the full equation.\n    # This fulfills the requirement to output each number in the final equation.\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(map(str, individual_turns))\n\n    print(\"The number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position performed by Osipova in the sequence is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total_pirouettes}\")\n\nsolve_ballet_riddle()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
