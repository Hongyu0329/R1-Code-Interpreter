As $t\rightarrow\infty$, the edges of the image are smoothed out, with the boundary's motion approximating motion by mean curvature. Convex parts of an edge erode, concave parts are filled in, and straight edges remain stable. Consequently, any shape with curvature will evolve to straighten its boundaries, and any closed shape will shrink and eventually disappear. The final image will either be monochromatic (all black or all white) or consist of regions separated by straight lines.
