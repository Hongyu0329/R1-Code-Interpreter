    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice, starting from the origin (0,0). A \"self-avoiding walk\" is a path on the lattice that never visits the same point more than once.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Algorithm Choice**: A direct calculation is difficult as there is no simple closed-form formula for a(n). The number of steps, n=10, is small enough to be solved computationally using a backtracking algorithm.\n2.  **Backtracking Logic**: I will write a recursive function that explores all possible paths step-by-step.\n    *   The function will keep track of the current position `(x, y)` and the set of all points visited so far in the current path.\n    *   At each step, it will try to move to all four neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n    *   A move is valid only if the neighbor has not been visited before.\n    *   If a move is valid, the function calls itself recursively for the next step.\n    *   The recursion stops when a path of 10 steps has been completed, at which point it counts as one valid walk.\n3.  **Symmetry Optimization**: The lattice is symmetric. The total number of walks is exactly 4 times the number of walks that start with a specific first step (e.g., moving right to (1,0)). This optimization reduces the computation time.\n4.  **Final Calculation**: My Python script will implement this optimized backtracking search. It will calculate the number of walks starting with a move to the right and then multiply this result by 4 to get the total number of 10-step walks, a(10). The code will print the components of this final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a higher recursion limit for safety, as the path is 10 steps deep.\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n    # The desired number of steps in the walk.\n    N = 10\n\n    def count_walks_recursive(x, y, steps_left, path):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts self-avoiding walks using backtracking.\n\n        Args:\n            x (int): The current x-coordinate.\n            y (int): The current y-coordinate.\n            steps_left (int): The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n            path (set): A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited points.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have successfully found one complete walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        # Explore the four possible directions (neighbors on a Manhattan lattice).\n        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n\n            # If the next point has not been visited, explore this path.\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in path:\n                # Add the new point to the path for the recursive call.\n                path.add((next_x, next_y))\n                # Recursively call the function for the remainder of the walk.\n                count += count_walks_recursive(next_x, next_y, steps_left - 1, path)\n                # Backtrack: remove the point to allow other paths to be explored.\n                path.remove((next_x, next_y))\n        return count\n\n    # By symmetry, the total number of walks is 4 times the number of walks\n    # that begin with a specific first step (e.g., moving right to (1, 0)).\n    \n    # We start the sub-problem from (1, 0), having already taken one step.\n    # The path already contains the origin (0,0) and the first step (1,0).\n    # The number of steps left to take is N - 1.\n    initial_path = {(0, 0), (1, 0)}\n    walks_starting_in_one_direction = count_walks_recursive(x=1, y=0, steps_left=N - 1, path=initial_path)\n    \n    # The total number of walks is 4 times this sub-problem result.\n    total_walks = 4 * walks_starting_in_one_direction\n\n    print(f\"The number of {N}-step self-avoiding walks, a({N}), can be found using an optimized search.\")\n    print(f\"By symmetry, we first calculate the number of walks that start by moving to (1, 0).\")\n    print(f\"Number of walks starting with a single direction: {walks_starting_in_one_direction}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is derived from multiplying this by the 4 possible starting directions:\")\n    print(f\"a(10) = 4 * {walks_starting_in_one_direction} = {total_walks}\")\n\nsolve()\n\n<<<470092>>>\n```"
