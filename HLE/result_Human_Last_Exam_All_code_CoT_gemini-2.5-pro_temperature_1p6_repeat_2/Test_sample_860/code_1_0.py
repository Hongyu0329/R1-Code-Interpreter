        "Age": 20,

        "Mental Status": "Disoriented with time and space",
        "Skin": "Cold and clammy",
        "Heart Rate": 160, # beats per minute (severe tachycardia)
        "Blood Pressure": "40/60", # mmHg (profound hypotension)
        "Hemoglobin": 6, # gm/dL (severe anemia)
        "BUN/Creatinine Ratio": 24 # elevated (suggests pre-renal failure from poor perfusion)
    }

    print("\nDiagnosis: The patient is in severe hemorrhagic (hypovolemic) shock due to massive blood loss from the femoral fracture.")
    print("-------------------------------")

    # Step 3: Evaluate each treatment option
    print("\nEvaluating Treatment Options:")
    print("---------------------------")

    # Option A
    print("A. Lay down the person and elevate legs along with CPR:")
    print("   - Rationale: Elevating legs is appropriate to increase blood return to the heart. However, CPR is only for cardiac arrest (no pulse). This patient has a pulse of 160. Therefore, this option is incorrect and potentially harmful.")

    # Option B
    print("\nB. Administer anticlotting medicine such as aspirin or heparin:")
    print("   - Rationale: The patient is bleeding profusely. Administering anticoagulants would worsen the hemorrhage. This is strongly contraindicated.")

    # Option C
    print("\nC. Intravenous resuscitation of normal saline or Ringer's lactate:")
    print("   - Rationale: The immediate goal in hemorrhagic shock is to restore intravascular volume to stabilize blood pressure and perfuse vital organs. Isotonic crystalloids like Normal Saline and Ringer's Lactate are the standard first-line treatment for this purpose. This option is the most appropriate initial step.")

    # Option D
    print("\nD. Intravenous resuscitation of normal saline:")
    print("   - Rationale: This is a correct action, but Option C is more comprehensive because Ringer's Lactate is also a standard, and often preferred, resuscitation fluid in trauma.")
    
    # Option E
    print("\nE. Intravenous resuscitation of normal saline with fructose:")
    print("   - Rationale: Adding sugar (fructose/dextrose) is not recommended for initial large-volume resuscitation as it can lead to hyperglycemia and other complications. Isotonic crystalloids are preferred.")

    # Step 4: Conclude the best answer
    print("\n---------------------------")
    print("Conclusion: The most critical and correct first-line treatment is to rapidly administer intravenous fluids to restore circulating volume.")
