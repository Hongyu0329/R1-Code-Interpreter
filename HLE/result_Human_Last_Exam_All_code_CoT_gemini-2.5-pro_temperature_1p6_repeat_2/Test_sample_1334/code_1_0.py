  # Part (a): If D is a minimal smooth covering of D_N, N must act semi-regularly.
  # As reasoned above, the condition for a smooth covering on a normal subgroup N
  # implies semi-regular action on vertices and faces.
  answer_a = "True"

  # Part (b): Is it necessary for G to be a perfect group if G is quasi-simple?
  # The provided definition of quasi-simple includes G = G', which means G is perfect.
  answer_b = "True"

  # Part (c): Type(s) of G under the given conditions.
  # The conditions constrain G to be a quasiprimitive group with a regular minimal
  # normal subgroup N. A known theorem in the field of regular maps further
  # constrains the type of G to be Holomorph Affine or Twisted Wreath product.
