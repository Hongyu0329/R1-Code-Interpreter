    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\nThe user is asking for the total number of players who have won the Triple Crown in MLB history. The \"Triple Crown\" most commonly refers to the batting award for leading a league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs in the same season.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Create a list of the American League players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n2.  Create a list of the National League players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n3.  Since some players won the award more than once, I will identify the unique players from each list to get the count of individual winners per league.\n4.  Add the counts from both leagues to get the total number of unique players who have won the Triple Crown.\n5.  Finally, I will print the lists of winners and the final calculation, showing how the total is derived.\n\n```python\ndef count_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates and displays the total number of unique MLB players\n    who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data for American League batting Triple Crown winners (Player, Year)\n    al_winners = [\n        (\"Nap Lajoie\", 1901),\n        (\"Ty Cobb\", 1909),\n        (\"Jimmie Foxx\", 1933),\n        (\"Lou Gehrig\", 1934),\n        (\"Ted Williams\", 1942),\n        (\"Ted Williams\", 1947),  # Won twice\n        (\"Mickey Mantle\", 1956),\n        (\"Frank Robinson\", 1966),\n        (\"Carl Yastrzemski\", 1967),\n        (\"Miguel Cabrera\", 2012)\n    ]\n\n    # Data for National League batting Triple Crown winners (Player, Year)\n    nl_winners = [\n        (\"Paul Hines\", 1878),\n        (\"Tip O'Neill\", 1887),\n        (\"Hugh Duffy\", 1894),\n        (\"Heinie Zimmerman\", 1912),\n        (\"Rogers Hornsby\", 1922),\n        (\"Rogers Hornsby\", 1925),  # Won twice\n        (\"Chuck Klein\", 1933),\n        (\"Joe Medwick\", 1937)\n    ]\n\n    # Get the unique player names from each league\n    al_unique_players = set(player for player, year in al_winners)\n    nl_unique_players = set(player for player, year in nl_winners)\n\n    # Count the number of unique winners in each league\n    num_al_winners = len(al_unique_players)\n    num_nl_winners = len(nl_unique_players)\n\n    # Total number of unique winners is the sum, as no player won in both leagues\n    total_unique_winners = num_al_winners + num_nl_winners\n\n    print(\"--- Unique MLB Batting Triple Crown Winners ---\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nAmerican League Winners ({num_al_winners} players):\")\n    for player in sorted(list(al_unique_players)):\n        print(f\"- {player}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nNational League Winners ({num_nl_winners} players):\")\n    for player in sorted(list(nl_unique_players)):\n        print(f\"- {player}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Calculation ---\")\n    print(\"To find the total number of unique winners, we add the counts from each league.\")\n    print(f\"Number of AL Winners + Number of NL Winners = Total Unique Winners\")\n    print(f\"{num_al_winners} + {num_nl_winners} = {total_unique_winners}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_triple_crown_winners()\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
