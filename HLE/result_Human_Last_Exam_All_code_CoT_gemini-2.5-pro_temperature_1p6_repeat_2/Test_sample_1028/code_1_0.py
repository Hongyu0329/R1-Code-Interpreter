### Analysis of the Identifiability Problem

The core problem is that when using a phylogeny of only extant (living) species, a time-varying birth-death model is unidentifiable. This means we cannot uniquely estimate the speciation rate λ(t) and the extinction rate μ(t) through time. An infinite number of different λ(t) and μ(t) function pairs can result in the exact same likelihood for the given tree. Essentially, the tree shape alone doesn't contain enough information to disentangle the birth of new lineages from the death of old ones.

### Evaluating the Strategies

Let's examine each option to see if it helps mitigate this issue:

*   **A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces:** This approach (piecewise-constant rates) simplifies the rate functions, which is a form of regularization. However, within each of the 10 pieces, the fundamental ambiguity between λ and μ remains. It doesn't solve the core problem, but by reducing model complexity, it could be argued it's a (weak) attempt at mitigation.

*   **B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework:** This is a classic and effective method. Priors add external information to the model (e.g., a belief that extinction rates are unlikely to be higher than speciation rates). This information constrains the possible parameter values, helping to produce a more stable and identifiable result. **This helps.**

*   **D. & F. Incorporating fossils:** Fossils (either as tips or sampled ancestors) provide direct evidence of extinct lineages and their timing. This information is precisely what is missing from extant-only phylogenies and is crucial for separating the signals of speciation and extinction. **This helps.**

*   **E. & G. Reparametrizing the model:** It has been shown that while λ(t) and μ(t) are not identifiable, certain combinations of them, such as the "pulled diversification rate" or "pulled speciation rate", are identifiable from extant phylogenies. By reformulating the model to estimate these identifiable parameters directly, we sidestep the unidentifiable parts. **This helps.**

*   **C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5:** This strategy does the opposite of mitigating the problem. It dramatically increases the complexity and number of free parameters in the model. If a simple time-varying model is already unidentifiable, making it vastly more flexible with high-degree polynomials across 10 different segments will only exacerbate the issue. This introduces extreme flexibility that cannot be constrained by the limited information in an extant-only tree. Therefore, this strategy does NOT help.

### Conclusion

The only strategy that does not help mitigate—and in fact, worsens—the identifiability issue is the one that introduces a massive amount of unconstrained complexity.
