No, polynucleotides, including homopolynucleotides, are not structurally polysaccharides. They represent two fundamentally different classes of biological macromolecules.

Here is a breakdown of their structural differences:

1.  **Monomers (Building Blocks):**
    *   **Polysaccharides:** These are polymers made from simple sugar monomers called **monosaccharides** (e.g., glucose).
    *   **Polynucleotides:** These are polymers made from **nucleotide** monomers. Each nucleotide is a more complex unit composed of three distinct parts: a five-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.

2.  **Chemical Composition:**
    *   **Polysaccharides** (like starch or cellulose) are primarily composed of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen (C, H, O).
    *   **Polynucleotides** (like DNA or RNA) contain Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, **Nitrogen**, and **Phosphorus** (C, H, O, N, P). The nitrogen is in the bases, and the phosphorus is in the phosphate groups.

3.  **Backbone and Linkages:**
    *   In **polysaccharides**, the monosaccharide monomers are linked directly to each other via **glycosidic bonds**.
    *   In **polynucleotides**, the nucleotide monomers are linked via **phosphodiester bonds** that create a repeating sugar-phosphate backbone. The nitrogenous bases are attached as side groups to this backbone.

**Conclusion:**
While both are polymers and both happen to contain sugar units, the fundamental differences in their monomers, overall chemical composition, and the type of bonds linking them mean they are structurally and functionally distinct. A polynucleotide cannot be classified as a polysaccharide.
