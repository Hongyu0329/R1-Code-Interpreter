    This function encapsulates the reasoning for solving the network transformation problem.
    
    The user is asked to solve a problem about transforming a Watts-Strogatz small-world network into an ultra-small world network.

    1.  **Goal:** Achieve an average path length of L ~ log(log(n)), which is a very strong connectivity requirement.
    2.  **Constraints:** Maintain high clustering (C >= 0.3) and limit the maximum degree (Delta <= log(n)).
    3.  **Analysis of Structures:** An ultra-small world property, especially under a maximum degree constraint, cannot be achieved by creating a few massive hubs. It requires a more sophisticated, distributed, and efficient network of shortcuts. Hierarchical networks are a prime example of such structures.
    4.  **Evaluating Option C:** The statement "The rewired edges must form a tree-like structure among high-degree vertices" describes the creation of an efficient, hierarchical backbone. The high-degree vertices act as hubs, and connecting them with a minimal, non-redundant set of links (a tree) is the most efficient way to build a global transport system for information. This new structure is what allows the path length to drop from log(n) to log(log(n)). While other options about the *cost* of the transformation (like m(n) = Theta(n)) are plausible consequences, the structural requirement described in C is the most fundamental design principle for achieving the target network properties under the given constraints. It describes the necessary *quality* and *architecture* of the transformation.
    5.  **Conclusion:** Option C provides the most insightful and correct description of the necessary change.
