    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Riddle:** I will break down the user's question into a set of key criteria the location must meet:\n    *   It must be an island town.\n    *   It must be extremely isolated (more than 500 km from the next inhabited island).\n    *   It must be situated on a bay.\n    *   The bay must be formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    *   Crucially, the town, the bay, and the caldera must all share the same name.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates:** I will consider famous remote, volcanic islands and check them against the criteria.\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha:** The world's most remote inhabited island. However, its only settlement is named \"Edinburgh of the Seven Seas,\" which does not match the island's name or any bay/caldera. This is not the answer.\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** This island is extremely remote, meeting the distance requirement. It is volcanic and has several calderas. Its capital town is **Hanga Roa**, which is located on **Hanga Roa Bay**. This is a perfect match for the \"town shares a name with the bay\" clue. While Hanga Roa Bay is not technically a caldera itself, the entire island is a volcanic complex whose formation is intrinsically linked to its calderas. This appears to be the most plausible fit for all parts of the riddle.\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion:** Hanga Roa is the only well-known candidate where the town and its bay share a name, while also being an extremely remote volcanic island town. The riddle's geological description likely refers to the town being on a bay of an island that was formed by volcanic caldera activity.\n\n4.  **Code Generation:** I will create a Python script that simply prints the name of the town.\n\n```python\n# This script will solve the riddle by printing the name of the island town.\n\n# The riddle's clues are:\n# 1. An island town.\n# 2. More than 500 km from another inhabited island (very remote).\n# 3. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n# 4. The bay shares the town's name.\n\n# Analysis points to Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui):\n# - It is the main town on the world's most isolated island with an airport.\n# - It is over 3,500 km from Chile and 2,000 km from Pitcairn Island.\n# - The town of \"Hanga Roa\" sits on \"Hanga Roa Bay\".\n# - Easter Island is a volcanic island with notable calderas, and the bay is a feature of this volcanic structure.\n\ntown_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\nprint(town_name)\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
