    # --- Part (a) Analysis ---
    # The Pohozaev identity P(u,v)=0 is a necessary condition for a function (u,v)
    # to be a solution (critical point of J), but it is not sufficient.

    # --- Part (b) Analysis ---
    # We analyze the existence and uniqueness of a scaling factor t.
    # Let's model P(u,v) = s*K(u,v) - N(u,v), where K is the kinetic term from the prompt
    # and N represents the nonlinear terms. With a scaling u_t = t*u, K scales as t^2
    # and N scales as t^p for some p > 2 (super-quadratic nonlinearity).
    # The equation P(u_t, v_t) = 0 becomes s * t^2 * K = t^p * N.
    # This leads to t^(p-2) = (s*K)/N, which has a unique positive solution for t.
    answer_b = "Yes"

    # Assume a power p for the nonlinearity and a value for s.

    # --- Part (c) Analysis ---
    # A minimizer (u,v) of J on the Pohozaev manifold P is a ground state solution.
    # As a solution, it must satisfy the Nehari identity, which for a potential homogeneous
    # of degree p, implies K = V (where J = K/2 - V/p and V is the potential energy term).
    # The term phi(t) = J(t*u, t*v) is the energy along the scaling fiber.
    # phi''(t) = K - (p-1)*t^(p-2)*V.
    # At t=1, phi''(1) = K - (p-1)V.
    # Substituting K=V gives phi''(1) = V - (p-1)V = V*(2-p).
    # For a physically interesting focusing problem, p > 2, which makes phi''(1) < 0.
    answer_c = "Yes"
    
    # Demonstrate with a sample calculation.
    # Assume the minimizer has been found and its potential energy V is positive.
    V_minimizer = 10.0 # Must be > 0
    # For p=4 (a typical value), we calculate the value of the second derivative.
