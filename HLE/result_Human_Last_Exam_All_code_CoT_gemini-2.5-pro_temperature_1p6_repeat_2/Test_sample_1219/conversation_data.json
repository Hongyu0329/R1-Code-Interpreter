    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **The Challenge**: The number `10^100`, also known as a googol, is astronomically large. Standard data types and math libraries (like Python's `math` module) cannot handle this calculation due to limitations in floating-point precision. They would produce an overflow error or a completely inaccurate result.\n2.  **The Solution**: We need to use a special library designed for arbitrary-precision mathematics. The `mpmath` library in Python is perfect for this. It can compute mathematical functions to any desired number of decimal places.\n3.  **The Mathematical Trick**: The `tan(x)` function is periodic, with a period of π (pi). This means that `tan(x) = tan(x - k*π)` for any integer `k`. Therefore, `tan(10^100)` is equivalent to `tan(10^100 mod π)`. The `mpmath` library can compute this modulo operation precisely.\n4.  **Required Precision**: To find `10^100 mod π` accurately, we need to perform the calculation with a precision significantly higher than 100 decimal places. This is because we are subtracting a very large multiple of π from `10^100`, which causes the first ~100 digits to cancel out. We'll set the precision to 120 decimal places to be safe.\n5.  **Execution**:\n    *   Set the `mpmath` precision.\n    *   Calculate `tan(10^100)` using `mpmath`.\n    *   Extract the first three digits from the fractional part of the result.\n    *   Print the final equation and the extracted digits.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\nimport sys\n# Make sure mpmath is installed, or provide an error message\ntry:\n    import mpmath\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Error: The 'mpmath' library is required. Please install it using 'pip install mpmath'\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n# Step 1: Set the precision for the calculation.\n# We are calculating a function of 10^100, a number with 101 digits.\n# To get an accurate remainder modulo pi, we need precision greater than 100.\n# We'll use 120 decimal places of precision (dps).\nmpmath.mp.dps = 120\n\n# Step 2: Define the input number x = 10^100 using mpmath's float type.\nx = mpmath.mpf(10)**100\n\n# Step 3: Calculate tan(x).\n# mpmath's tan function automatically handles the periodicity,\n# effectively calculating tan(x mod pi) with high precision.\nresult = mpmath.tan(x)\n\n# Step 4: Extract the first 3 digits after the comma.\n# To do this robustly for both positive and negative results, we can:\n# 1. Get the fractional part by subtracting the integer part: (result - int(result))\n# 2. Multiply by 1000 to shift the desired digits to the left of the decimal.\n# 3. Take the absolute value and then the integer part to get the three digits.\nthree_digits = abs(int((result - int(result)) * 1000))\n\n# Step 5: Print the results as requested.\n# We display the full equation and then the specific answer.\nprint(\"The final equation is: tan(10^100) = result\")\nprint(f\"The number 10^100 is a 1 followed by 100 zeros.\")\nprint(f\"The value of the result is: {result}\")\nprint(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are: {three_digits}\")\n```\n<<<334>>>"
