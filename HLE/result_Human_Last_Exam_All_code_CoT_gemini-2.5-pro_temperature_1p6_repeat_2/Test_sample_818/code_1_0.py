    # --- Plan Explanation ---
    # We need to find the smallest integer m (if it exists) for which a simple cubic
    # graph G with m vertices has N(G), the number of its slices, as a multiple
    # of n. We are asked to find M(0), M(3), and M(5).

    # M(n) = smallest m such that exists a cubic graph G with |V(G)|=m and N(G) % n == 0.

    # We will first write a function to calculate N(G) for a given graph G.
    # This will be used to test small graphs. For larger graphs or for cases like
    # M(0), the problem is computationally very hard and relies on known results
    # from graph theory literature, which we will cite.
