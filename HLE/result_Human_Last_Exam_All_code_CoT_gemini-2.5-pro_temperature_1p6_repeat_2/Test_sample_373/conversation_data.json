    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Graph:** I will first model the specified graph. A barbell graph with 10 nodes is most commonly interpreted as two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge, which is the \"bottleneck\".\n2.  **Understand the Process:** I will analyze the \"randomized uniform gossiping\" process. In this process, a node is selected uniformly at random from all nodes, and then one of its neighbors is selected, also uniformly at random.\n3.  **Identify Key Nodes and Degrees:** The crucial nodes are the two connected by the bottleneck edge. I will calculate their degrees (number of connections), as this is essential for the probability calculation. The degree of each of these two nodes is 4 (from their own clique) + 1 (from the bottleneck) = 5.\n4.  **Formulate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge is \"sampled\" if one of the two key nodes is chosen and it, in turn, chooses its partner across the bottleneck. I will write down the probability equation for this event, which is the sum of probabilities of two mutually exclusive events:\n    *   Node A is picked, and it chooses Node B.\n    *   Node B is picked, and it chooses Node A.\n5.  **Calculate and Present:** I will write a Python script that implements this logic. The script will define the parameters, perform the calculation, and print a clear, step-by-step explanation of the entire process, including the formula with all the numbers substituted in, as requested. The final result will be presented as both a fraction and a decimal.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node\n    barbell graph using randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the graph parameters.\n    # A barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two 5-node cliques (K5)\n    # connected by a single bottleneck edge.\n    total_nodes = 10\n    clique_size = 5\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the degrees of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge.\n    # Let the bottleneck edge connect node 'u' and node 'v'.\n    # The degree of a node is its number of connections.\n    # Each node is connected to (clique_size - 1) nodes within its own clique,\n    # plus 1 connection via the bottleneck edge.\n    degree_of_bridge_node = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n    # Step 3: Formulate and calculate the probability.\n    # The uniform gossiping process is:\n    # 1.
