    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar,\" we first need to establish a plausible chemical structure for a standard nanocar.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define a \"Nanocar\"**: A \"nanocar\" is not a single, formally defined chemical compound but rather a class of molecules. I will base this calculation on one of the original and most well-known nanocar precursors, the \"Nanoputian,\" developed by the research group of Professor James Tour.\n2.  **Determine its Chemical Formula**: The chassis and axle structure of this Nanoputian has the chemical formula `C38H44O4`. The \"wheels\" are typically four `C60` fullerene molecules, which contain only carbon and no hydrogen. Therefore, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the complete nanocar molecule is 44.\n3.  **Apply the \"Perfluoro-\" Rule**: The chemical prefix \"perfluoro-\" means that *all* hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon in the molecule are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n4.  **Calculate the Result**: The number of fluorine atoms in the \"perfluoronanocar\" will be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar. I will write a simple Python script to formalize this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n    This calculation is based on the structure of a well-known nanocar precursor,\n    the \"Nanoputian,\" which has a chassis/axle formula of C38H44O4.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
