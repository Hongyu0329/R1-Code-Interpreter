    print("  - Model Type: Transformer with a fixed number of layers (L) and dimensions (d).")
    print("  - Activations: Saturated activations, such as ReLU or hard-sigmoid, which prevent unbounded growth of values.")
    print("  - Attention Mechanism: 'Average-hard-attention', which relies on comparison and selection (e.g., finding top-k scores) rather than smooth functions like softmax.")
    print("  - Arithmetic Precision: 'Float activations' imply fixed-precision arithmetic (e.g., 64-bit floats).")

    print("\nStep 2: Mapping Computation to a Circuit Model")
    print("  - A fixed model architecture processing a variable-length input 'n' corresponds to a 'non-uniform' model of computation, specifically a family of boolean circuits {C_n}, one for each input length.")
    print("  - Our goal is to determine the size and depth of these circuits.")
    print("  - Key Insight: All arithmetic on fixed-precision floats (addition, multiplication, comparison) can be performed by boolean circuits of constant size and depth, as the number of bits is constant.")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyzing the Complexity of Core Transformer Operations")
    print("  - Matrix Multiplication: This involves many dot products (sums of products). For fixed-precision numbers, multiplication is in TC^0. The summation of 'n' numbers can be done with a tree of adders, which also fits within TC^0.")
    print("  - Saturated Activations: Functions like ReLU (max(0, x)) are based on comparison, which is a fundamental threshold operation.")
    print("  - Hard Attention: This mechanism involves calculating scores (dot products), comparing them, and selecting the maximum or top-k. Sorting and selection on 'n' items are known to be in TC^0.")

    print("\nStep 4: Introducing the Complexity Class TC^0")
    print("  - TC^0 is the class of problems solvable by circuit families of constant depth and polynomial size, using AND, OR, NOT, and unbounded fan-in Threshold gates.")
    print("  - A Threshold gate outputs 1 if the weighted sum of its inputs exceeds a certain threshold. This is a powerful primitive that captures the essence of the transformer's operations (weighted sums, comparisons).")
    print("  - Since all core operations (multiplication, addition, comparison, sorting) for fixed-precision numbers are in TC^0, a single transformer layer is also in TC^0.")
    
    print("\nStep 5: Assembling the Final Upper Bound")
    print("  - The transformer consists of a constant number of layers, L.")
    print("  - The composition of a constant number of TC^0 functions results in another TC^0 function.")
