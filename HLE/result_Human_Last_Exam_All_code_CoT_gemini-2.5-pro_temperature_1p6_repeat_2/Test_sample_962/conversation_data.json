    "To design a tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol, we can use the FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold) scheme. FROST is built upon the well-understood Schnorr signature scheme and is designed for high security and efficiency.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan of the FROST protocol, followed by a Python code demonstration.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Key Generation:** A trusted party (or a more complex Distributed Key Generation protocol) creates a secret polynomial of degree `t-1`. The main secret key is the constant term of this polynomial (`f(0)`). Each of the `n` participants receives a point on this polynomial as their private key share (`f(i)` for participant `i`). The group's public key is calculated from the main secret key.\n2.  **Signing Protocol (Two Rounds):** This phase requires a coordinator (one of the `t` signers) to manage the process.\n    *   **Round 1 (Commitment):** This round can be performed in advance, before the message is known. Each of the `t` participating signers generates two secret random numbers (nonces) and computes two public values from them (commitments). They send these commitments to the coordinator.\n    *   **Round 2 (Signing):** Once a message needs to be signed, the coordinator gathers the commitments from all `t` signers. The coordinator then creates a group commitment `R` and a challenge value `c` based on the message, the commitments, and the group public key. The coordinator sends this information to the participants. Each participant then uses their private key share, their nonces, and the information from the coordinator to compute a partial signature. They send this partial signature back to the coordinator.\n3.  **Aggregation & Verification:** The coordinator combines the `t` partial signatures into a single, final signature `(R, z)`. Anyone can then verify this signature using the group's public key, the message, and a final verification equation.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this entire process. It is simplified for educational purposes to demonstrate the mathematical flow and is **not cryptographically secure**.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# WARNING: This code is for educational purposes only.\n# It demonstrates the mathematical concepts of a threshold signature scheme\n# but is NOT cryptographically secure.
