def find_unlikely_tribes():
    """
    This function identifies the indices of insect tribes whose immatures are
    unlikely to be collected using a beat-sheet method.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    - 1) Apis: Immatures are in a hive, not on foliage. (Unlikely)
    - 2) Melipotini: Larvae are external leaf feeders. (Likely)
    - 3) Eupholini: Larvae are internal borers (wood, stem, root). (Unlikely)
    - 4) Acritini: Larvae live in decaying matter, not on plants. (Unlikely)
    - 5) Oxyptilini: Larvae are often internal borers (stems, flowers). (Unlikely)
    - 6) Dictyophorini: Nymphs live externally on plants. (Likely)
    - 7) Acanthocerini: Larvae live in rotting wood or social insect nests. (Unlikely)

    The function will print the indices of the unlikely tribes in ascending order,
    separated by commas.
