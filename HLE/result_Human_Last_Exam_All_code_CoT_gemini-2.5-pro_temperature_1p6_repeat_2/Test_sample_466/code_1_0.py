# The number of internal adjunctions is the number of automorphisms of the object.
# For the R-module V = F_11^3, this corresponds to the number of invertible
# 3x3 matrices with entries in the finite field F_11.
# This is the order of the general linear group GL(n, q) where n=3 and q=11.

# Parameters for the calculation
q = 11  # The size of the finite field (F_11)
n = 3   # The dimension of the vector space (F_11^3)
