    Explains the context of the name 'Azikiwe' in Goodluck Jonathan's full name.

    explanation = """
The premise that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan started publicly identifying as 'Azikiwe' in a specific year is based on a misunderstanding.

The name 'Azikiwe' is part of his full, official name: Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.

This is not a name he adopted later in life. It has been part of his identity on official documents throughout his academic and political career. For example, the name 'Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan' appeared on his official nomination forms submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for presidential elections, such as in 2011 and 2015.

Since the name has been part of his official public record for decades, there is no single year to cite.
