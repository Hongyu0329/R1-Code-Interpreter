    "Based on my research, the name \"Azikiwe\" is part of Goodluck Jonathan's full birth name (Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan), not a name he adopted or began using at a specific point in time. It has been present on his official documents, including his PhD thesis and his presidential candidacy forms for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in elections like 2011 and 2015.\n\nTherefore, there isn't a specific year when he \"publicly identified\" himself as Azikiwe for the first time; it has been part of his official name throughout his public career.\n\nI will write a Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jonathan_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the context of the name 'Azikiwe' in Goodluck Jonathan's full name.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThe premise that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan started publicly identifying as 'Azikiwe' in a specific year is based on a misunderstanding.\n\nThe name 'Azikiwe' is part of his full, official name: Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n\nThis is not a name he adopted later in life. It has been part of his identity on official documents throughout his academic and political career. For example, the name 'Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan' appeared on his official nomination forms submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for presidential elections, such as in 2011 and 2015.\n\nSince the name has been part of his official public record for decades, there is no single year to cite.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_jonathan_name()\n```\n<<<There is no specific year when Goodluck Jonathan began to publicly identify as 'Azikiwe' because it has been part of his official full name throughout his public life.>>>"
