    "Of course, I can help with that. This question involves a concept from mathematics, specifically in the area of fixed-point theory. I will first explain the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point and then provide a Python script that demonstrates these conditions by finding such a point for a sample system of functions.\n\n### **FGH-Tripled Fixed Point: The Conditions**\n\nAn FGH-tripled fixed point is a point `(x, y, z)` that is a simultaneous solution to a system of three equations defined by three functions. Based on your query, we are looking for a point `(x, y, z)` in a space `X × Y × Z` such that:\n\n1.  `x = F(x, y, z)`\n2.  `y = G(y, x, y)`\n3.  `z = H(z, y, x)`\n\nHere, `F: X×Y×Z → X`, `G: Y×X×Y → Y`, and `H: Z×Y×X → Z` are functions defined on non-empty sets X, Y, and Z. (Note: I am assuming the third function `G:Z*Y*X→Z` in the prompt was a typo and should be `H`, as is conventional and implied by the \"FGH\" name).\n\nThe conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point can be established using a generalization of the famous **Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**. Here is a step-by-step plan to derive the conditions:\n\n**Step 1: Reframe the Problem**\nWe can combine the three functions into a single operator `T` that acts on the product space `M = X × Y × Z`. This operator is defined as:\n`T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\nA fixed point of `T` is a point `p = (x, y, z)` such that `T(p) = p`. This is exactly the definition of our FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem states that if `(M, d)` is a complete metric space and an operator `T: M → M` is a **contraction mapping**, then `T` has a unique fixed point.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Conditions**\nThis leads us to the main conditions:\n\n1.  **Space Condition:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **complete metric spaces**. A metric space is a set with a notion of distance between elements, and \"complete\" means that any sequence of points that get progressively closer to each other will converge to a point within the space. The real numbers (`R`) are a common example.\n\n2.  **Function (Contraction) Condition:** The operator `T` must be a contraction. This means there must exist a constant `k < 1` such that the distance between the outputs of `T` is smaller than the distance between the inputs, scaled by `k`. A sufficient way to ensure this is to impose Lipschitz continuity conditions on the functions F, G, and H individually.\n\nLet `d_X`, `d_Y`, `d_Z` be the distance metrics for spaces X, Y, Z. Assume `F`, `G`, `H` satisfy:\n*   `d_X(F(x1, y1, z1), F(x2, y2, z2)) ≤ α1*d_X(x1, x2) + α2*d_Y(y1, y2) + α3*d_Z(z1, z2)`\n*   `d_Y(G(y1, x1, y1), G(y2, x2, y2)) ≤ β1*d_Y(y1, y2) + β2*d_X(x1, x2)`\n*   `d_Z(H(z1, y1, x1), H(z2, y2, x2)) ≤ γ1*d_Z(z1, z2) + γ2*d_Y(y1, y2) + γ3*d_X(x1, x2)`\n\nfor some non-negative constants `α_i, β_i, γ_i`.\n\nIf we combine these, the operator `T` is a contraction if the following condition on the constants holds:\n`max( (α1 + β2 + γ3), (α2 + β1 + γ2), (α3 + γ1) ) < 1`\n\nWhen these conditions are met, a unique FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist. Furthermore, it can be found by starting with any initial point `(x0, y0, z0)` and iterating the operator `T` repeatedly.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by defining a system that satisfies the contraction condition and then finding the unique fixed point.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_fgh_tripled_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point\n    by defining a system of functions that satisfies the contraction mapping principle\n    and finding the fixed point using iteration.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
