The primary conditions are that (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete metric spaces, and the functions F, G, H must satisfy Lipschitz-type conditions such that the associated operator T(x,y,z) = (F(x,y,z), G(y,x,y), H(z,y,x)) is a contraction on the product space M = X×Y×Z. A sufficient condition involving the Lipschitz constants (αi, βi, γi) is that max(α1+β2+γ3, α2+β1+γ2, α3+γ1) must be strictly less than 1.
