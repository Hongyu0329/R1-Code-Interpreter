The mathematical formulation for the vertical cross-sections of a Gaussian IT3 MF is given by a pair of piecewise functions, `μ_upper_slice(u|x)` and `μ_lower_slice(u|x)`, which define the bounds of the resulting IT2 MF's Footprint of Uncertainty. Each function has a value of 1 within an interval determined by the bounding IT2 sets (`A_upper` and `A_lower`) and decays with Gaussian tails outside this interval, with the decay rate controlled by standard deviations `σ_u_upper` and `σ_u_lower`.
