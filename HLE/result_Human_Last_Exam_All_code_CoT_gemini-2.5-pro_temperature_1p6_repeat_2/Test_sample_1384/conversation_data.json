    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we can analyze its base-10 logarithm.\n\nLet $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. This number is extremely small. To find its first non-zero digits, we can express it in scientific notation: $N = M \\times 10^I$, where $M$ is the mantissa (a number between 1 and 10) and $I$ is an integer exponent. The first digits of $N$ are the digits of $M$.\n\nWe can find $M$ and $I$ by taking the base-10 logarithm of $N$:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$\n$\\log_{10}(N) = -7^{13} \\times \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nLet's calculate this value. We can then separate it into its integer part, $I$, and its fractional part, $f$.\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\lfloor \\log_{10}(N) \\rfloor + \\{ \\log_{10}(N) \\} $\nHere, the integer part of the logarithm is $I' = \\lfloor \\log_{10}(N) \\rfloor$ and the fractional part is $f = \\{ \\log_{10}(N) \\}$.\nFrom the properties of logarithms, we have $N = 10^{\\log_{10}(N)} = 10^{I' + f} = 10^f \\times 10^{I'}$.\nThe mantissa of $N$ is $M = 10^f$, and the exponent is $I = I'$. Since $0 \\le f < 1$, the mantissa $M$ will be between $1$ and $10$. The first two non-zero digits of $N$ are the first two digits of $M$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_first_two_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Let N = e^(-7^13).
