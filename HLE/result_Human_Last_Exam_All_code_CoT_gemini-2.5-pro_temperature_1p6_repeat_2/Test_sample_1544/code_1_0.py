    Analyzes the given chess FEN and determines the best move for White.

    The position is a known chess study. The analysis shows that while many
    moves lead to a draw (like Qxc5+), there is a single, subtle move that
    forces a win for White.

    The move is 1. Qe1.

    This move prepares to enter a King and Pawn endgame where White's king is
    more actively placed than in other variations. For example:
    1. Qe1 Qc1+ 2. Qe1 Qxe1+ 3. Kxe1
    In this resulting endgame, White's king on e1 is close enough to support
    the passed d-pawn, leading to a victory. Other moves fail to achieve this.
