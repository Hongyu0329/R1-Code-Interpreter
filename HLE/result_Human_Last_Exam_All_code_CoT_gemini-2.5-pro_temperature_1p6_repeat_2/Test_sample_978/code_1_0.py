    # --- Part 1: Analysis of the incident involving Mark and the pool ---
    print("Step 1: Liability for the pool damage.")
    print(" - Mark's actions: Mark was an employee on the job. His distracted operation of the riding lawnmower was a breach of his duty to perform his work with reasonable care. This is negligence.")
    print(" - Mark's Liability: As the direct cause of the damage, Mark is personally liable for his negligence. We can represent his liability as '1'.")
    print(" - Evergreen's Liability: The principle of 'vicarious liability' holds an employer responsible for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of employment. Mark was on the job, so Evergreen is also liable. We can represent this as '2'.")
    print(" - Neighbours' Liability: The neighbours' short fence is a remote condition, but Mark's negligence is the direct and proximate cause of the damage. It is unlikely they would be found liable.")
    print(" - Conclusion for Incident 1: Mark and Evergreen are jointly and severally liable for the damage to the pool. This means the client, Bruce, can claim the full damages from either Mark or Evergreen.")

    # --- Part 2: Analysis of the incident involving Lincoln and the car ---
    print("Step 2: Liability for the car damage.")
    print(" - Lincoln's actions: Lincoln used a blower in a manner that he knew or should have known would propel rocks at the client's car. This is a negligent act.")
    print(" - Lincoln's Liability: He is personally liable for the damage he caused. The fact that the scratches were 'minimal' is relevant to the amount of damages owed, not to the existence of liability itself. We can represent his liability as '3'.")
    print(" - Evergreen's Liability: Just as with Mark, Evergreen is vicariously liable for Lincoln's actions, as they occurred within the scope of his employment. We can represent this as '4'.")
    print(" - Conclusion for Incident 2: Lincoln and Evergreen are jointly and severally liable for the damage to the Ferrari.")
    print("Final Equation for Incident 2: Lincoln (3) + Evergreen (4) => Joint and Several Liability for car damage.")

    # --- Part 3: Evaluating the final answer ---
    print("Step 3: Comparing the conclusions to the answer choices.")
    print(" - Choice A is incorrect because the neighbours are not liable, and Evergreen is liable for Lincoln's actions.")
    print(" - Choice B is incorrect because the parties are not all liable for all the damage; the liability is specific to each incident.")
    print(" - Choice C is incorrect because Evergreen is vicariously liable for Lincoln's actions.")
    print(" - Choice D is incorrect because minimal damage does not eliminate liability.")
    print(" - Choice E correctly states that Evergreen and Mark are jointly and severally liable for Mark's actions, AND that Evergreen and Lincoln are jointly and severally liable for Lincoln's actions.")
