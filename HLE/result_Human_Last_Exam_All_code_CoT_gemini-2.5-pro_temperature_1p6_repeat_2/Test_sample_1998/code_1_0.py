    Calculates the smallest natural number N for the given problem.

    The field K is a 2-dimensional local field of characteristic 2.
    Let d be the dimension of the local field.
    A key result in the theory of quadratic forms states that the general u-invariant
    of such a field is u_gen(K) = 2^d.
    The general u-invariant is the maximum dimension of an anisotropic quadratic form.
    This means any quadratic form in N > u_gen(K) variables is isotropic.

    The problem asks for the smallest N where every ANISOTROPIC form in N
    variables is surjective.
    For N = u_gen(K) + 1, the set of anisotropic forms is empty, so the condition
    is vacuously true.
    We need to show that for N = u_gen(K), there exists at least one anisotropic
    form that is not surjective. This is indeed the case, as shown in the derivation.

    Thus, the smallest such N is u_gen(K) + 1.
