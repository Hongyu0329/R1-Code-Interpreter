    Provides the symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 circles in a circle.

    The problem of finding the densest packing of N congruent circles in a circle is
    a famous mathematical problem. The solutions for large N are not proven to be
    optimal but are the "best-known" packings found through computational analysis.

    According to the extensive catalog of best-known packings by Eckard Specht,
    the configuration for N=1135 circles is asymmetric. An asymmetric object
    has only the trivial symmetry (the identity operation), which corresponds to
    the C1 symmetry group in Schoenflies notation.
