    # Step 1: Define the key structural difference.
    print("Step 1: Identify the key structural difference.")
    print(" - C16-dihydroceramide (d18:0/16:0): Contains two fully saturated hydrocarbon chains.")
    print(" - C16-ceramide (d18:1/16:0): Contains one saturated chain and one unsaturated chain with a trans double bond.\n")

    # Step 2: Relate the structure to how the molecules pack together.
    print("Step 2: Relate structure to molecular packing.")
    print(" - The fully saturated chains of C16-dihydroceramide are straight and flexible. They can pack together very tightly and efficiently, maximizing van der Waals interactions. This leads to the 'highly ordered domains' mentioned in the problem.")
    print(" - The trans double bond in the C16-ceramide's chain introduces a rigid kink. This kink prevents the molecules from packing as closely together, resulting in a looser, 'less ordered' arrangement.\n")

    # Step 3: Connect molecular packing to the area occupied in a monolayer.
    print("Step 3: Connect packing to surface area.")
    print(" - A monolayer is a single layer of molecules. When compressed, the area is minimized.")
    print(" - Tighter packing means each molecule occupies a smaller footprint on the surface.")
    print(" - Looser packing means each molecule occupies a larger footprint on the surface.\n")

    # Step 4: Conclude which lipid has a lower surface area.
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Because C16-dihydroceramide can pack more tightly due to its fully saturated chains, it will occupy less area per molecule.")
    print("\nTherefore, the C16-dihydroceramide will have a lower surface area when compressed in a monolayer.")
