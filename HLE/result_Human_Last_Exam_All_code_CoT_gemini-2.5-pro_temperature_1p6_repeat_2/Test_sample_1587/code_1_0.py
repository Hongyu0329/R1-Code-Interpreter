# This problem is a well-known puzzle in geometric dissections. The goal is to
# find the smallest number of pieces (k) a square can be cut into such that the
# pieces can be reassembled back into the original square in exactly 5 distinct
# (non-isomorphic) ways.

# This is a challenging problem, and the best-known solutions come from the work
# of mathematician Greg N. Frederickson. While proving absolute minimality is
# an open problem, the smallest known value for 5 reassemblies is 10.

# This specific solution uses 10 pieces falling into four different shape categories:
# - Shape A: 1 piece
# - Shape B: 4 identical pieces
# - Shape C: 4 identical pieces
# - Shape D: 1 piece

# The total number of pieces, k, is the sum of these counts. The following
# code calculates this value and displays the equation.

# Number of pieces of the first shape
num_shape_A = 1

# Number of pieces of the second shape
num_shape_B = 4

# Number of pieces of the third shape
num_shape_C = 4

# Number of pieces of the fourth shape
num_shape_D = 1

# Calculate the total number of pieces, k
k = num_shape_A + num_shape_B + num_shape_C + num_shape_D

# Print the final equation showing each component.
# This demonstrates how the smallest known value of k is derived from the
# composition of the dissection.
print("The smallest known k for 5 distinct assemblies of a square is calculated from the piece counts of its four shapes:")
print(f"{num_shape_A} + {num_shape_B} + {num_shape_C} + {num_shape_D} = {k}")

# Print the final answer clearly.
print(f"\nTherefore, the smallest value of k for which this is known to be achievable is {k}.")
