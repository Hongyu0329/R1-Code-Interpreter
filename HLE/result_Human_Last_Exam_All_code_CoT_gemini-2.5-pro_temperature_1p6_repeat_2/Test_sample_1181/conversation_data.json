    "My plan is to identify the correct character from the 1972 film *Solaris* based on their dialogue and thematic role in the movie. The question centers on a character who feels a specific kind of nostalgia for Earth, mixed with shame. I will analyze the motivations and key scenes of the main characters—Kris, Hari, Snaut, and Sartorius—to determine who expresses this feeling. After identifying the character, I will write a Python script that states the answer and its reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef find_solaris_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the characters in Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film 'Solaris'\n    to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The protagonist, Kris Kelvin, is sent to the space station orbiting the planet Solaris.\n    # Throughout the film, he is consumed by memories of Earth, his home, his father,\n    # and his late wife. His character arc is defined by this intense nostalgia and\n    # his struggle to reconcile his human emotions with the sterile, alien environment.\n    # It is Kris who reflects on humanity's misguided goals in space and feels a profound,\n    # almost shameful, longing for simple terrestrial experiences like the sound of rustling leaves.\n    \n    answer_choice = \"A\"\n    character_name = \"Kris\"\n\n    print(f\"The character from the 1972 movie Solaris who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth is {character_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the correct option is {answer_choice}.\")\n\nfind_solaris_character()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
