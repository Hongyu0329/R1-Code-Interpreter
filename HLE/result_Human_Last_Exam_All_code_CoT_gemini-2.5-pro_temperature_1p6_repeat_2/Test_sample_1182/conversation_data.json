    "To find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve, we need to analyze the geometry of its reduction modulo 2. This process can be quite involved, but it boils down to understanding how the branch points of the curve behave 2-adically.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Equation**: Start with the curve $y^2 = P(x)$, where $P(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. Reducing this equation modulo 2 gives $y^2 = x^2$, which is a \"double line\". This indicates a degenerate reduction, which is not stable. The stable model must be found through further analysis.\n2.  **Find Branch Points**: A hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 like this one is a double cover of the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$, with 6 branch points. These are the roots of the polynomial $P(x)$ and the point at infinity (since the degree of $P(x)$ is odd).\n3.  **Determine Valuations**: The key to finding the stable reduction is to compute the 2-adic valuations of these branch points. The valuations tell us how the branch points \"cluster\" together modulo 2. We can find the valuations of the roots of $P(x)$ using the Newton Polygon method.\n4.  **Cluster Branch Points**: We group the branch points into two sets: those that are 2-adic integers (valuation $\\ge 0$) and those that are not (valuation $< 0$). The sizes of these sets determine the structure of the stable reduction.\n5.  **Determine Stable Model Structure**: Based on the sizes of the clusters, a theorem from the theory of hyperelliptic curves tells us what the stable model looks like. Specifically, it tells us the components of the reduced curve and how many times they intersect.\n6.  **Count Double Points**: The number of intersection points between the components in the stable model is the number of double points (nodes).\n\nThe following Python script will walk through the numerical parts of this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef v2(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the 2-adic valuation of an integer n.\n    Returns infinity if n is 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        return 0\n    return (n & -n).bit_length() - 1\n\ndef print_polynomial(coeffs_dict, var='x'):\n    \"\"\"Prints a polynomial from a dictionary of coefficients.\"\"\"\n    terms = []\n    for power, coeff in sorted(coeffs_dict.items(), reverse=True):\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        if power == 0:\n            terms.append(f\"{coeff}\")\n        elif power == 1:\n            terms.append(f\"{coeff}*{var}\")\n        else:\n            terms.append(f\"{coeff}*{var}^{power}\")\n    return \" + \".join(terms)\n\ndef main():\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the curve and its branch points.\")\n    p_coeffs = {5: 8, 4: 4, 3: 4, 2: 1, 1: 8, 0: 0}\n    print(f\"The curve is y^2 = {print_polynomial(p_coeffs)}\")\n    print(\"The branch points are the roots of this polynomial and the point at infinity.\")\n    print(\"\\nOne root is clearly x=0.
