    Analyzes a legal ethics scenario regarding lawyer-client confidentiality

    # The fundamental rule in question is solicitor-client privilege, which mandates confidentiality.
    # However, this rule is not absolute. The most relevant exception here is the "public safety" exception.
    # In Ontario, Canada (where the scenario is set), this is covered by the Law Society of Ontario's
    # Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rule 3.3-3.

    # The exception allows a lawyer to disclose confidential information if three conditions are met:
    # 1. The lawyer has a reasonable belief of a threat.
    # 2. The threat involves an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.
    # 3. Disclosure is necessary to prevent that harm.
    # The rule also stipulates that the lawyer should disclose no more information than is necessary.

    print("Analyzing the scenario based on the public safety exception to client confidentiality:\n")

    # Step 1: Does James have a reasonable belief in a threat?
    # Eric's statement is specific: "I bought a gun... going to my wifeâ€™s apartment tonight to end things for both of us."
    # This, combined with Eric's recent emotional distress, makes the belief reasonable.
    print("1. Reasonable Belief: Yes. Eric made a specific, credible threat.")

    # Step 2: Is there an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm?
    # The threat is a murder-suicide ("end things for both of us") planned for "tonight".
    # This clearly meets the criteria of being both imminent and involving death/serious harm.
    print("2. Imminent Risk of Death/Harm: Yes. The threat was a murder-suicide planned for the same night.")

    # Step 3: Was disclosure necessary to prevent the harm?
    # Contacting the police is the appropriate and necessary action to intervene and prevent a violent crime.
    print("3. Necessity of Disclosure: Yes. Informing the police was necessary to prevent the violence.")

    # Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on this analysis.
    print("\n--- Evaluating the Answer Choices ---\n")

    # Choice A: Incorrect. The threat was for "tonight", which is the definition of imminent.
    print(textwrap.fill("Choice A states the threat was not imminent. This is factually incorrect based on the scenario.", 80))

    # Choice B: Incorrect. Confidentiality is a core duty, but not absolute. The public safety exception is well-established.
    print(textwrap.fill("\nChoice B claims confidentiality is absolute. This is legally incorrect; exceptions exist.", 80))

    # Choice C: Incorrect. This choice argues James disclosed too much information. While the scope of disclosure ("no more than necessary") is a real consideration, in a crisis involving imminent death, providing police with all information that could help locate the client (including addresses of other properties he might go to) is generally considered a reasonable judgment call. The fundamental decision to disclose was correct. This option wrongly invalidates the entire action based on a debatable point about the *amount* of information.
    print(textwrap.fill("\nChoice C argues that too much information was disclosed. While debatable, the core decision to disclose was correct, and in a crisis, providing extra locating information is arguably reasonable to prevent harm. This makes the overall action compliant.", 80))

    # Choice D: Incorrect. The rule states a lawyer *may* disclose, it is not mandatory ("must disclose"). The duty is discretionary and is triggered by the threat, not by a police request.
    print(textwrap.fill("\nChoice D incorrectly frames the disclosure as a mandatory response to a police request. The lawyer's duty to consider disclosure is discretionary and pre-dates any police request.", 80))

    # Choice E: Correct. This choice perfectly aligns with the three conditions of the public safety exception. James had a reasonable belief of an imminent threat of death, and disclosure was necessary to prevent it.
    print(textwrap.fill("\nChoice E accurately summarizes the legal and ethical justification for James's actions. He acted in accordance with the public safety exception to the rule of confidentiality.", 80))

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("James's actions were justified. He formed a reasonable belief of an imminent threat of death and disclosed information to the police, which was necessary to prevent the harm.")
