    "My plan is to identify the movie that matches the user's specific description. I will break down the user's query into key elements and use them to find the correct film.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Query:** The key elements are:\n    *   A Hollywood feature film from a major studio.\n    *   A character who is a teenager.\n    *   The teenager is riding a pink bike.\n    *   The teenager pedals directly toward an oncoming car in a game of \"chicken.\"\n\n2.  **Search and Identify:** Based on these very specific details, the scene in question occurs in the 1985 horror film *A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge*. In an early scene, the protagonist, teenager Jesse Walsh, is riding his little sister's pink Huffy bicycle and is goaded into a game of chicken by a bully in a car.\n\n3.  **Verify Details:**\n    *   **Studio:** The film was produced by New Line Cinema, a major studio and subsidiary of Warner Bros.\n    *   **Teenager:** The character Jesse Walsh is a high school student.\n    *   **Pink Bike:** The bike he rides is explicitly a pink Huffy.\n    *   **Oncoming Car:** He rides directly toward the bully's car.\n\n4.  **Code Generation:** I will now write a Python script that stores these facts and prints the name of the film as the solution. The script will also make sure to print the number \"2\" that is part of the movie's title.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_from_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a movie based on a specific scene description.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Scene criteria provided by the user\n    character_type = \"teenager\"\n    vehicle_type = \"pink bike\"\n    action = \"pedals directly toward an oncoming car\"\n    studio_type = \"major film studio\"\n\n    # This database contains the movie that matches the specific criteria\n    movie_database = {\n        (\"teenager\", \"pink bike\", \"oncoming car\"): {\n            \"title\": \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\",\n            \"year\": 1985,\n            \"studio\": \"New Line Cinema\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Find the movie matching the key scene elements\n    scene_key = (\"teenager\", \"pink bike\", \"oncoming car\")\n    movie_info = movie_database.get(scene_key)\n\n    if movie_info:\n        movie_title = movie_info[\"title\"]\n        # The prompt asked to be sure to output each number in the final result.\n        # The title of the movie is \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\".\n        # The number in this title is 2.\n        print(f\"The film where a teenager rides a pink bike towards an oncoming car is: {movie_title}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not identify the movie based on the provided scene.\")\n\nfind_movie_from_scene()\n```\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio does a teenager ride a pink bike and pedal directly toward an oncoming car?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
