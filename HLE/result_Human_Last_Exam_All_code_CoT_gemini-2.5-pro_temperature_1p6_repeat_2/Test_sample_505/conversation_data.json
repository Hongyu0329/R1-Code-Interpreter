    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded, we need to make an assumption about the distribution of the holes, as the phrasing \"two patches of surface code with two holes\" is ambiguous.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **State the Core Principle:** The number of logical qubits (`k`) that can be encoded in a single, simply connected planar patch of surface code is equal to the number of holes (`h`) created within it. The formula is `k = h`.\n2.  **Address Ambiguity:** The phrase \"two patches... with two holes\" could mean either:\n    *   a) Two holes in total, distributed between the two patches.\n    *   b) Two holes *in each* of the two patches.\n3.  **Maximize the Qubits:** The question asks for the maximum (\"at most\") number of logical qubits. To achieve the maximum, we will assume the most favorable configuration, which is interpretation (b).\n4.  **Calculate the Total:** Since the patches are separate systems, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each patch.\n5.  **Construct Code:** Write a Python script to perform and print this calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_qubit_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits in two surface code patches\n    with two holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: State the core principle for a single patch.\n    print(\"The number of logical qubits (k) that can be encoded in a single planar patch of surface code is equal to the number of holes (h) it contains.\")\n    print(\"Formula for a single patch: k = h\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define the configuration based on the goal of maximizing the count.\n    # The problem states \"two patches...with two holes\". To get the maximum number\n    # of qubits, we interpret this as each of the two patches having two holes.\n    num_patches = 2\n    holes_per_patch = 2\n    \n    print(f\"To find the maximum, we assume the configuration is:\")\n    print(f\"Number of independent patches = {num_patches}\")\n    print(f\"Number of holes in each patch = {holes_per_patch}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total number of logical qubits.\n    # For independent patches, the total logical qubits is the sum of qubits from each patch.\n    qubits_patch1 = holes_per_patch\n    qubits_patch2 = holes_per_patch\n    total_qubits = qubits_patch1 + qubits_patch2\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final calculation and result.\n    print(\"The total number of logical qubits is the sum from each patch.\")\n    print(f\"Total Logical Qubits = (Qubits in Patch 1) + (Qubits in Patch 2)\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {qubits_patch1} + {qubits_patch2} = {total_qubits}\")\n\nsolve_qubit_count()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
