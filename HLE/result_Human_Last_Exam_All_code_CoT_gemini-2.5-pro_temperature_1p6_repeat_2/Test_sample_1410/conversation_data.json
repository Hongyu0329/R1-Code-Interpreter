    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this chess puzzle.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the provided FEN `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20` to understand the position of all pieces on the board.\n\nThe key to solving such puzzles is to find a \"forcing sequence\" of moves for White, typically involving checks, that leaves Black with no good options. I will look for candidate moves for White and analyze Black's possible responses.\n\nSince the problem states that Black plays optimally, I need to consider all of Black's defensive tries. If White has multiple ways to deliver checkmate, Black will choose the path that makes the game last as long as possible. The final answer will be the number of White's moves in this longest path to a forced checkmate.\n\nMy analysis reveals the following critical line:\n1.  White's most powerful starting move is `Qxf7+`, forcing the Black king to `Kh8`.\n2.  White continues the attack with `Nxg6+`. Black has two captures (`hxg6` or `fxg6`).\n3.  If Black plays `hxg6`, it leads to a mate in 4 moves for White.\n4.  If Black plays `fxg6`, it leads to a mate in 5 moves for White.\n5.  Since Black plays optimally, they will choose the line that results in a mate in 5.\n\nTherefore, White can force a win in 5 moves. The python code below will print this specific sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the move-by-move solution to the chess puzzle.\n    The FEN for the position is: 4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20\n    It's a mate in 5 for White, assuming optimal play from Black.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # White plays optimally to force a checkmate.\n    # Black plays optimally to delay the checkmate as long as possible.\n    # The solution is a mate in 5 moves.\n\n    moves = [\n        (\"1.\", \"Qxf7+\", \"Kh8\"),\n        (\"2.\", \"Nxg6+\", \"fxg6\"),\n        (\"3.\", \"Bxg6+\", \"Kg8\"),\n        (\"4.\", \"Qe8+\", \"Rxe8\"),\n        (\"5.\", \"Rf8#\", \"\")\n    ]\n    \n    print(\"The solution is a forced mate in 5 moves for White.\")\n    print(\"The sequence, assuming optimal play from Black, is:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Move |  White  |  Black\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    for move in moves:\n        move_num, white_move, black_move = move\n        print(f\"{move_num:<4} | {white_move:<7} | {black_move}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
