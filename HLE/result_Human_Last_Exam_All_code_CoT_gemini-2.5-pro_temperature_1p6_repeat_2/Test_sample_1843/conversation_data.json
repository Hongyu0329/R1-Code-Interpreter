    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization:** First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n2.  **Dirichlet Character Decomposition:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is uniquely determined by a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where each $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a character modulo the corresponding prime power factor $p^k$.\n    -   The character $\\chi$ is **primitive** if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ is primitive.\n    -   The **order** of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\dots)$.\n\n3.  **Counting Component Characters:** We need to find the number of choices for each primitive component $\\chi_{p^k}$ such that their orders combine to an lcm of 6. This implies that the order of each component character must be a divisor of 6. We analyze each factor:\n\n    -   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$):** There is only one primitive character modulo 4. Its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this gives us 1 choice.\n\n    -   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$):** The group of characters modulo 9 is cyclic of order $\\phi(9) = 6$. The primitive characters are those not induced from modulo 3. Their orders must be divisors of 6 but not of $\\phi(3)=2$. Thus, the possible orders are 3 and 6. Both divide 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n    -   **Conductor 7:** The group of characters modulo 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. The primitive characters are the non-trivial ones. Their orders are divisors of 6 greater than 1, which are 2, 3, and 6. All these orders divide 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n    -   **Conductor 11:** The group of characters modulo 11 is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. The primitive characters have orders dividing 10 (and >1). We only need orders that divide 6. The only common divisor is 2. The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n\n    -   **Conductor 13:** The group of characters modulo 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. The primitive characters have orders dividing 12 (and >1). We only need orders that divide 6. These are 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** We need to form a character $\\chi$ where $\\text{lcm}(\\text{orders}) = 6$.\n    -   The order of $\\chi_4$ is 2, so the final lcm is a multiple of 2.\n    -   The order of $\\chi_9$ is 3 or 6, so the final lcm is a multiple of 3.\n    -   Therefore, the lcm of the orders of the components must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$.\n    -   Since we have already ensured that each component's order divides 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\n    -   The only number that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 is 6 itself.\n    -   So, any combination of the allowed characters will result in a character of order 6.\n\n    The total number is the product of the number of valid choices for each component:\n    Total = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\n# Step 1: Count the number of choices for each primitive component character\n# such that its order divides 6.\n\n# For conductor 4 (2^2): 1 primitive character of order 2. 2|6.\nnum_chi_4 = 1\n\n# For conductor 9 (3^2): primitive characters have orders 3 or 6.

All divide 6.\n# Number of choices = phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6)\nnum_chi_7 = phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6)\n\n# For conductor 11: primitive characters have orders 2, 5, or 10. Only 2 divides 6.\n# Number of choices = phi(2)\nnum_chi_11 = phi(2)\n\n# For conductor 13: primitive characters have orders 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n# Those dividing 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n# Number of choices = phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6)\nnum_chi_13 = phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6)\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the number of choices for each component.\n# As explained in the text, the lcm is guaranteed to be 6.\ntotal_characters = num_chi_4 * num_chi_9 * num_chi_7 * num_chi_11 * num_chi_13\n\nprint(\"The number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each primitive component:\")\nprint(f\"Choices for N=4: {num_chi_4}\")\nprint(f\"Choices for N=9: {phi(3)} + {phi(6)} = {num_chi_9}\")\nprint(f\"Choices for N=7: {phi(2)} + {phi(3)} + {phi(6)} = {num_chi_7}\")\nprint(f\"Choices for N=11: {phi(2)} = {num_chi_11}\")\nprint(f\"Choices for N=13: {phi(2)} + {phi(3)} + {phi(6)} = {num_chi_13}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{num_chi_4} * {num_chi_9} * {num_chi_7} * {num_chi_11} * {num_chi_13} = {total_characters}\")\n\n```\n<<<100>>>"
