        'B': "Incorrect. Periods of drought cause water stress. To conserve water, trees close their stomata (leaf pores). This reduces their ability to be selective, leading to an INCREASE in the 13C ratio, which is the opposite of the observed decline.",
        'C': "This relates to the tree's internal carbon allocation. Like 'A', it is a physiological factor and is unlikely to be the predominant driver of a long-term regional trend.",
        'D': "This is another physiological factor related to the seasonal growth pattern of the tree. It is not the main driver of the overall long-term trend in the source carbon's isotopic signature.",
        'E': "Plausible. The SE Asia monsoon is a major climate driver influencing precipitation. A stronger monsoon means more rainfall and less water stress. With ample water, trees keep their stomata open wider, allowing them to discriminate more effectively against the heavier 13C isotope. This leads to a LOWER (declining) 13C ratio in the wood. Of the choices given, this is the most likely large-scale environmental factor to cause the observed trend."
