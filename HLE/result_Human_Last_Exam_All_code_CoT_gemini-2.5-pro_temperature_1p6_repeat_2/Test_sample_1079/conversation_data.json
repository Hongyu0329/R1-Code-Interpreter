    "An element of a reflection group is called \"regular\" if it has an eigenvector that does not lie in any of the group's reflecting hyperplanes. The corresponding eigenvalue is called a \"regular eigenvalue\".\n\nThe problem asks for the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that have a regular eigenvalue of order 10. An element with such a property is, by definition, a regular element. The order of any eigenvalue must divide the order of the element itself. Therefore, we are looking for regular elements whose order is a multiple of 10.\n\nFor a finite irreducible Coxeter group, the orders of regular elements are constrained. They must be of the form `m_i + 1`, where the `m_i` are the group's \"exponents\".\nFor the H3 group:\n- The order `|W|` is 120.\n- The Coxeter number `h` is 10.\n- The exponents are `m_1 = 1`, `m_2 = 5`, and `m_3 = 9`.\n\nThe possible orders of regular elements in H3 are therefore `1+1=2`, `5+1=6`, and `9+1=10`.\nSince we are looking for elements with an eigenvalue of order 10, the element's order must be a multiple of 10. From the list of possible regular orders, the only option is 10.\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the number of regular elements of order 10 in H3.\n\nThe number of regular elements of a given order `d` can be calculated with the following formula:\n`N(d) = φ(d) * C(d) * |W| / h`\nWhere:\n- `φ(d)` is Euler's totient function, which counts the positive integers up to `d` that are relatively prime to `d`.\n- `C(d)` is the number of exponents `m_i` of the group for which `m_i + 1 = d`.\n- `|W|` is the order of the group.\n- `h` is the Coxeter number.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value for `d = 10`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef euler_totient(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Euler's totient function φ(n).\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    # Loop from 1 to n\n    for k in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Check if gcd(k, n) is 1\n        if math.gcd(k, n) == 1:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Define the parameters for the reflection group of type H3\ngroup_name = \"H3\"\nW_order = 120  # Order of the group |W|\nh = 10         # Coxeter number\nexponents = [1, 5, 9]\n\n# We are looking for elements with a regular eigenvalue of order 10.\n# This is equivalent to finding the number of \"regular elements\" of order 10.\nd = 10\n\n# The number of regular elements of order d is given by the formula:\n# N(d) = φ(d) * C(d) * |W| / h\n# where:\n#  - φ(d) is Euler's totient function.\n#  - |W| is the order of the group.\n#  - h is the Coxeter number.\n#  - C(d) is the number of exponents m_i of the group such that m_i + 1 = d.\n\n# Step 1: Calculate C(d)\nC_d = 0\nfor m in exponents:\n    if m + 1 == d:\n        C_d += 1\n\n# Step 2: Calculate φ(d)\nphi_d = euler_totient(d)\n\n# Step 3: Apply the formula\n# The result should be an integer, so we use integer division //\nnum_elements = (phi_d * C_d * W_order) // h\n\n# Output the explanation and final result\nprint(f\"The task is to find the number of elements in the reflection group {group_name}\")\nprint(f\"that have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order {d}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of regular elements of order d in the group.\")\nprint(\"The formula for this is N(d) = φ(d) * C(d) * |W| / h, where:\")\nprint(f\"  |W| = Order of the group = {W_order}\")\nprint(f\"  h   = Coxeter number = {h}\")\nprint(f\"  d   = Order of the element = {d}\")\nprint(f\"  φ(d) = Euler's totient function\")\nprint(f\"  C(d) = Number of exponents m_i such that m_i + 1 = d\")\nprint(\"\\nFirst, we find the parameters for the formula:\")\nprint(f\"1.
