def solve_lsm_entry_size():
    """
    Calculates the minimum size of an entry in an LSM tree.

    The problem provides the following parameters for an LSM tree:
    - Levels (L) = 5
    - Size Ratio (T) = 3
    - Number of Entries = 4096
    - Write Buffer Size = 16 KB

    The minimum size of an entry is determined by the capacity of the write buffer.
    The formula is: Entry Size = Buffer Size / Number of Entries in Buffer.

    The key is to correctly interpret "Number of Entries = 4096". If we assume this
    is the total number of entries in the tree, calculating the number of entries
    in the buffer (N_0) using the standard formula N_total = N_0 * (T^L - 1) / (T-1)
    results in a non-integer value for N_0 (4096 / 121 â‰ˆ 33.85).

    Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the number of entries provided (4096)
    refers directly to the number of entries that fit in the write buffer, and the
    details about levels and size ratio are extraneous to this specific question.
