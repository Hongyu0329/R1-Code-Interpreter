    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** First, we need to determine the chemical formula for toluene, which is C₇H₈. This means we have 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the basis set:** We'll analyze the 6-31G basis set to find out how many contracted Gaussian functions it assigns to each type of atom (C and H).\n    *   **For Carbon (C):** The 6-31G basis set assigns 1 function for the core orbital (1s), and it splits the valence orbitals (2s, 2p) into two sets. The inner valence set has 4 functions (one 2s and three 2p), and the outer valence set has another 4 functions. This gives a total of 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted functions per Carbon atom.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** Hydrogen only has a valence 1s orbital. The basis set splits this into two functions (an inner and an outer part). This gives a total of 2 contracted functions per Hydrogen atom.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** We will multiply the number of Carbon atoms by the functions per Carbon and the number of Hydrogen atoms by the functions per Hydrogen, and then sum these two values to get the total number of contracted functions for the entire molecule.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms for toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set.\n# For Carbon: 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9\nfuncs_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen: 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence) = 2\nfuncs_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total contributions from Carbon and Hydrogen atoms\ntotal_funcs_from_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * funcs_per_carbon\ntotal_funcs_from_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * funcs_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_funcs_from_carbon + total_funcs_from_hydrogen\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers\nprint(\"The calculation for the total number of contracted Gaussian functions is:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon_atoms} Carbon atoms * {funcs_per_carbon} functions/atom) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} Hydrogen atoms * {funcs_per_hydrogen} functions/atom)\")\nprint(f\"= {total_funcs_from_carbon} + {total_funcs_from_hydrogen}\")\nprint(f\"= {total_functions}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nFor a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), a total of {total_functions} contracted Gaussian functions are used.\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
