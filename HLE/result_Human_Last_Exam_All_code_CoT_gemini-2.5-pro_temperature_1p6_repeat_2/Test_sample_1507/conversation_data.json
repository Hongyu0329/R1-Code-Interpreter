    "To determine the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Outer-Hull:** The \"outer-hull\" of a star polyhedron, like the great icosahedron, refers to its convex hull. The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron. This is because both polyhedra share the same 12 vertices.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Outer-Hull's Structure:** A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces.\n\n3.  **Determine the Triangulation:** The problem asks for a \"triangulation,\" which means dividing a surface into a set of triangles. Since the surface of the regular icosahedron is already made up entirely of triangular faces, this surface itself constitutes a minimal triangulation.\n\n4.  **Count the Triangles:** Therefore, the minimal number of triangles required to triangulate the surface is simply the number of faces on a regular icosahedron, which is 20.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints this number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_triangulation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the minimal number of triangles needed for\n    triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n    # A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces.\n    num_faces_icosahedron = 20\n\n    # Step 2: The faces of a regular icosahedron are already triangles.\n    # Therefore, the minimal number of triangles for a triangulation of its surface\n    # is simply its number of faces.\n    \n    print(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\n    print(\"A regular icosahedron's surface is already composed of triangles.\")\n    print(f\"Number of triangular faces on a regular icosahedron = {num_faces_icosahedron}\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed is {num_faces_icosahedron}.\")\n\nsolve_triangulation()\n<<<20>>>"
