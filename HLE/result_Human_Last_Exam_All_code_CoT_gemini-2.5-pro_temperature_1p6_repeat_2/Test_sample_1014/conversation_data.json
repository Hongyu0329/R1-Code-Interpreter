    "Of course. My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  **Objective**: Find the largest prime factor of the number 8139881.\n2.  **Method**: I will use a trial division algorithm. This method attempts to divide the number by a sequence of prime numbers.\n3.  **Algorithm**:\n    *   Start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n    *   First, I'll handle the factor 2. I'll repeatedly divide `n` by 2 until it's odd, adding 2 to a list of factors each time.\n    *   Next, I'll iterate through odd numbers (`i = 3, 5, 7, ...`) up to the square root of the remaining `n`.\n    *   For each `i`, if it divides `n`, I'll add `i` to my list of factors and divide `n` by `i` until it's no longer divisible.\n    *   After the loop, if the remaining `n` is greater than 1, this means `n` itself is a prime factor, and it will be the largest one. I'll add it to the list.\n    *   Finally, I will print the full prime factorization equation as requested and then output the largest factor from my list.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the prime factors of a number, prints the factorization\n    equation, and returns the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_number = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor of 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors starting from 3\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n //= i\n\n    # This condition is crucial. If n is a prime number greater than 2,\n    # it would not have been touched by the loops above.\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # Print the results\n    if not factors or len(factors) == 1:\n        print(f\"{original_number} is a prime number.\")\n        largest_prime = original_number\n    else:\n        # Build and print the factorization equation\n        equation_str = \" * \".join(map(str, factors)) + f\" = {original_number}\"\n        print(f\"The prime factorization of {original_number} is: {equation_str}\")\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n\n    print(f\"The largest prime divisor is: {largest_prime}\")\n\n# The number from the problem\nnumber_to_factor = 8139881\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(number_to_factor)\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
