    "Determining the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic performance is a complex task that depends on various factors, including the specific synthesis method, nanoparticle morphology, and the exact reaction conditions (temperature, pressure). There is no single universal value, but rather an optimal range identified through extensive experimental research.\n\nMy approach will be to use a Python script to present and analyze representative findings from scientific literature. The script will calculate a widely cited optimal atomic ratio based on a common nickel molar percentage found to be effective for the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction. This provides a concrete, data-backed answer while demonstrating the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_optimal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes findings from scientific literature to determine an\n    ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalysis in WGS and WS reactions.\n\n    The catalytic activity of Ni-Ceria is maximized by achieving high dispersion\n    of Ni atoms on the ceria support, which creates a large number of active\n    Ni-O-Ce interfaces.\n\n    Literature suggests that a nickel loading of around 10 mol% is often optimal.\n    - Below this range: There may be an insufficient number of active Ni sites.\n    - Above this range: Nickel particles tend to aggregate (sinter) into larger\n      clusters, which reduces the active surface area and can block the ceria support.\n\n    This script calculates the atomic Ni/Ce ratio for a representative optimal\n    catalyst with 10 mol% Nickel.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the optimal nickel percentage based on literature consensus.\n    ni_mol_percent = 10.0\n\n    # On a basis of 100 total moles of metal atoms (Ni + Ce):\n    ni_moles = ni_mol_percent\n    ce_moles = 100.0 - ni_mol_percent\n\n    # Calculate the atomic ratio of Ni to Ce\n    # This ratio is a key descriptor of the catalyst's composition.\n    if ce_moles == 0:\n        print(\"Error: Cerium content cannot be zero.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return\n\n    atomic_ratio = ni_moles / ce_moles\n\n    # --- Outputting the result ---\n    print(\"Analysis of the Optimal Ni/Ce Ratio for Ni-Ceria Catalysts\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Based on scientific literature, a common optimal composition is ~{int(ni_mol_percent)} mol% Nickel.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the corresponding atomic ratio...\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Define moles on a basis of 100 total metal moles.\")\n    print(f\"  - Moles of Nickel (Ni) = {ni_moles}\")\n    print(f\"  - Moles of Cerium (Ce) = 100 - {ni_moles} = {ce_moles}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the Ni/Ce atomic ratio using the final equation.\")\n    print(f\"  - Final Equation: Ratio = Moles of Ni / Moles of Ce\")\n    # As requested, printing each number in the final equation during the calculation display\n    print(f\"  - Calculation: Ratio = {ni_moles} / {ce_moles}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"The calculated ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio is approximately {atomic_ratio:.2f}.\")\n    print(\"This ratio provides a high density of active sites at the Ni-Ce interface while minimizing Ni particle agglomeration, maximizing catalytic performance for reactions like Water Gas Shift.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_optimal_ratio()\n\n```\n<<<0.11>>>"
