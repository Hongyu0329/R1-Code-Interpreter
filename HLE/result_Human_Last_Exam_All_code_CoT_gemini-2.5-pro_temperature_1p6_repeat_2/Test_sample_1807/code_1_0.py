    explanation = """
The core of the question is to explain why specific genetic markers would show high differentiation (Fst) between males and females within the same population. This implies a fundamental genetic difference between the sexes, rather than a force that separates populations.

Let's analyze the most likely cause:

- **B. XY vs ZW sex determining systems:** This is the most direct explanation. Sex chromosomes are inherited differently and exist in different copy numbers between the sexes.
  - In an XY system (e.g., humans), markers on the Y chromosome are found only in males.
  - In a ZW system (e.g., birds), markers on the W chromosome are found only in females.
  - This exclusivity automatically results in a maximum Fst value of 1 between the sexes for these markers.
  - Markers on the X or Z chromosomes also have different inheritance patterns and copy numbers (one in the heterogametic sex, two in the homogametic sex), which leads to different allele frequencies and elevated Fst between males and females.

Why other options are less likely:
- **A, C, D, E:** Genetic load, reproductive isolation, local adaptation, and hybrid zone dynamics are concepts that primarily explain differentiation *between populations*, not systematic differentiation *between sexes* within a single interbreeding population. While sex-specific selection could occur (related to local adaptation), the most profound and guaranteed source of differentiation comes from the unique genetics of the sex chromosomes themselves.
