    "This problem requires identifying a specific class of finite groups based on a property called \"being filled\". This is a non-trivial problem in group theory. My approach is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the mathematical definitions**: I'll start by breaking down the properties of the group `G`: its order is `2q^m` (where `q` is an odd prime), it is nonabelian, and it is \"filled\".\n2.  **Apply a classification theorem**: The group `G` is solvable. There is a powerful theorem that provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a finite solvable group to be filled. I will apply these conditions to the specific structure of groups of order `2q^m`.\n3.  **Characterize the groups**: The conditions from the theorem will translate into a precise structural requirement for `G`. This will involve the commutator subgroup `G'` and the nature of the semidirect product structure that `G` must have.\n4.  **Formulate the final answer**: The result is a description of all such groups.\n5.  **Provide an illustrative code example**: As requested, I will provide a Python script that constructs an example of such a group and verifies that it satisfies the derived structural property. I will use the `sympy` library for group-theoretic computations.\n\n### Mathematical Derivation\n\nA finite group `G` is called **filled** if every maximal product-free subset of `G` generates `G`. We are looking for nonabelian filled groups of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m \\ge 1`.\n\n1.  **Solvability**: By Burnside's `p^a q^b` theorem, any group of order `p^a q^b` is solvable. Since `|G| = 2^1 q^m`, `G` is solvable.\n\n2.  **Theorem for Filled Solvable Groups**: A finite solvable group `G` is filled if and only if it satisfies the following three conditions:\n    a. `G` has no quotient group isomorphic to `Z_p` for any odd prime `p`.\n    b. `G` has no quotient group isomorphic to `D_{2n}` (the dihedral group of order `2n`) for any even integer `n > 1`.\n    c. Every normal subgroup of index 4 in `G` has a complement in `G`.\n\n3.  **Applying the Conditions to `G`**:\n    *   **Condition (b)**: If `D_{2n}` is a quotient of `G`, its order `2n` must divide `|G|=2q^m`. This implies `n` must divide `q^m`, so `n` must be of the form `q^k` for some `k \\ge 0`. Since `q` is an odd prime, `n=q^k` is always odd. The condition specifies `n` must be even, so this case never occurs. Thus, condition (b) is always satisfied.\n    *   **Condition (c)**: If `G` has a normal subgroup of index 4, then `G` must have a quotient group of order 4. However, `|G| = 2q^m` is not divisible by 4 (as `q` is odd). Therefore, `G` has no normal subgroups of index 4, and this condition is vacuously satisfied.\n    *   **Condition (a)**: The order `p` of a quotient `Z_p` must divide `|G|`. The only odd prime dividing `|G|` is `q`. So, this condition simplifies to: `G` must have no quotient group isomorphic to `Z_q`.\n\n4.  **The Commutator Subgroup**: A group `G` has a quotient isomorphic to `Z_q` if and only if its abelianization `G/G'` has a subgroup of order `q`, where `G'` is the commutator subgroup of `G`. Since `G/G'` is abelian, this is equivalent to `q` dividing the order of `G/G'`. So, for `G` to be filled, `|G/G'|` must not be divisible by `q`.\n    The order of `G/G'` must divide `|G|=2q^m`. Since it cannot be divisible by `q`, `|G/G'|` must be a power of 2.\n    By Sylow's theorems, `G` has a normal subgroup `P` of order `q^m` (the Sylow `q`-subgroup), and the quotient `G/P` is isomorphic to `Z_2`. This means `G` has a quotient of order 2, so `G/G'` is non-trivial and its order is divisible by 2.\n    The only possibility is `|G/G'|=2`.\n\n5.  **Group Structure**: The condition that `G` is a nonabelian filled group of order `2q^m` is equivalent to the condition that its commutator subgroup `G'` has index 2.\n    `G` is a semidirect product `G = P \\rtimes_\\alpha Z_2`, where `P` is a group of order `q^m` and `\\alpha` is an automorphism of `P` of order 2. The condition `|G:G'| = 2` implies `G'=P`.\n    The commutator subgroup of this semidirect product is `G' = [P, \\alpha] P'`, where `[P, \\alpha]` is the subgroup generated by elements of the form `p \\alpha(p)^{-1}` and `P'` is the commutator subgroup of `P`.\n    The condition `G' = P` is equivalent to `P = [P, \\alpha]P'`. This holds if and only if the induced automorphism `\\alpha` on the Frattini quotient `V = P/\\Phi(P)` is fixed-point-free (except for the identity). Since `\\alpha^2=id`, this means the induced automorphism must be the inversion map `v \\mapsto v^{-1}` for all `v \\in V`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are precisely the semidirect products `G = P \\rtimes_\\alpha Z_2` where:\n*   `P` is any group of order `q^m`.\n*   `\\alpha` is an automorphism of `P` of order 2.\n*   The induced action of `\\alpha` on the Frattini quotient `P/\\Phi(P)` is the inversion map (`x \\mapsto x^{-1}`).\n\nFor any `p`-group `P` with `p` odd, such an automorphism `\\alpha` is known to exist. Therefore, for every group `P` of order `q^m`, there exists at least one such filled group. Famous examples include the dihedral groups `D_{2n}` where `n` is an odd prime power.\n\n### Python Code Example\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to construct an example of such a group for `q=3`, `m=2`, with `P = Z_3 \\times Z_3`. It then verifies that the commutator subgroup has the required index of 2.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.perm_groups import PermutationGroup\n\ndef illustrate_filled_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function constructs a nonabelian filled group of order 18 (2 * 3^2)\n    and verifies it satisfies the derived property |G:G'|=2.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Constructing an example of a nonabelian filled group.\")\n    print(\"Let q=3, m=2.
