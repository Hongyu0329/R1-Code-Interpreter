    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root *seh₂g-* into its forms in Proto-Germanic, Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form**\n\n*   **PIE Form:** *seh₂gieti* ‘(s)he’s giving a sign’\n*   **Root:** *seh₂g-* 'to track, seek out'. The *h₂* is a laryngeal consonant which typically colors an adjacent *e* to an *a* sound and lengthens a preceding vowel when it is lost.\n*   **Suffix:** *-ie-*. This is a suffix used to form present tense verbs (a \"ye-present\").\n*   **Ending:** *-ti*. This is the standard 3rd person singular active indicative ending.\n\n### **Step 2: Trace the development from PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\nThe verb for 'to seek' in Germanic languages (*sōkijaną*) is the direct descendant of this root. However, Germanic languages inherited a different formation of the verb stem than the one in Latin or the specific form *seh₂gieti*. Germanic used an o-grade causative form, likely from PIE *sog(h₂)-éye-ti. This is a common pattern where different IE branches preserve different ablaut grades or formations of the same root.\n\n1.  **Vowel Change (Root):** The PIE o-grade (*sog-*) combines with the laryngeal (*h₂*) and the causative suffix to yield a long *ō* in Proto-Germanic. PIE *oH* > PGmc *ō*. So, the root becomes *sōk-*.\n2.  **Grimm's Law:** Voiced stops become voiceless. The PIE voiced velar stop *g* becomes the PGmc voiceless velar stop *k*.\n3.  **Verb Class:** The verb becomes a Class I weak verb in Germanic, formed with the suffix *-ja-*. The infinitive is reconstructed as **\\*sōkijaną**.\n4.  **3rd Person Singular Ending:** The PIE ending *-ti* undergoes Grimm's Law (*t* > *þ*). The full ending in PGmc for the 3rd person singular present indicative is **\\*-iþ** or **\\*-iþi**.\n\nCombining these elements, the Proto-Germanic form is **\\*sōkiþ**.\n\n### **Step 3: Trace from Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)**\n\n1.  **i-Umlaut:** The *i* in the ending (*-iþ*) causes the preceding root vowel *ō* to be fronted. PGmc *ō* > ON *œ*. The stem changes from *sōk-* to *sœk-*.\n2.  **Ending:** The PGmc 3rd person singular ending *-iþ* evolves into **-r** in Old Norse for most verbs in the present indicative.\n\nCombining the umlauted stem and the new ending gives the Old Norse form: **sœkir**.\n\n### **Step 4: Trace from Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)**\n\n1.  **i-Umlaut:** As in Old Norse, the *i* in the ending causes the root vowel *ō* to be fronted. PGmc *ō* > OE *ē*. The stem changes from *sōk-* to *sēk-*.\n2.  **Palatalization:** In Old English, the velar consonant *k* was palatalized to an affricate /tʃ/ (spelled <c> or <ċ>) when it came before a front vowel. The new vowel *ē* (from umlaut) is a front vowel, so this change occurs. The stem *sēk-* becomes *sēċ-*.\n3.  **Ending:** The PGmc ending *-iþ* becomes **-eþ** or **-þ** in Old English.\n\nCombining the changed stem and the ending gives the Old English form: **sēċeþ**.\n\n### **Step 5: Trace from Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)**\n\n1.  **High German Consonant Shift:** The PGmc voiceless stop *k* shifts to a fricative. After a vowel, it becomes a long fricative *hh* /xː/. So the stem *sōk-* becomes *sōhh-*.\n2.  **Vowel Change:** PGmc *ō* diphthongizes to **uo** in Old High German. The stem *sōhh-* becomes *suohh-*.\n3.  **i-Umlaut:** In this class of verbs (Class I weak with a long stem), the *i* that caused umlaut was lost before the sound change fully affected the vowel *uo*. Therefore, umlaut does not apply to this form. The stem remains *suohh-*.\n4.  **Ending:** The PGmc ending *-iþ* becomes **-it** in Old High German.\n\nCombining the shifted stem and the ending gives the Old High German form: **suohhit**.\n\n### **Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** *sōkiþ*\n*   **Old Norse:** *sœkir*\n*   **Old English:** *sēċeþ*\n*   **Old High German:** *suohhit*\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkiþ*; Old Norse: sœkir; Old English: sēċeþ; Old High German: suohhit>>>"
