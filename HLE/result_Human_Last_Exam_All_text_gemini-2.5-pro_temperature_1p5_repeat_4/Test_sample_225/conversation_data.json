    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of curve and its properties.**\nThe curve is a Lissajous curve. A self-intersection point occurs when the curve passes through the same physical point (x, y) at two different times, say t1 and t2. This means we are looking for the number of unique points (x, y) for which there exist at least two distinct time values t1 ≠ t2 within the primary period of the curve, such that:\nx(t1) = x(t2)\ny(t1) = y(t2)\n\n**Step 2: Determine the period of the curve.**\nThe period of x(t) = cos(9t) is T_x = 2π/9.\nThe period of y(t) = sin(5t) is T_y = 2π/5.\nThe period of the complete curve is the least common multiple (LCM) of T_x and T_y.\nT = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π * LCM(1/9, 1/5) = 2π * (1/GCD(9, 5)).\nSince the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 9 and 5 is 1, the period is T = 2π.\nSo, we need to find the number of self-intersections for t in the interval [0, 2π).\n\n**Step 3: Set up the equations for self-intersection.**\nWe need to find the number of solution pairs (t1, t2) with 0 ≤ t1 < t2 < 2π that satisfy:\n1)  cos(9t1) = cos(9t2)\n2)  sin(5t1) = sin(5t2)\n\n**Step 4: Use the standard formula for Lissajous curves.**\nLissajous curves are generally described by parametric equations of the form:\nx(t) = A sin(at + δ)\ny(t) = B sin(bt)\n\nThe given curve is x(t) = cos(9t), y(t) = sin(5t). We can rewrite x(t) using the trigonometric identity cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2):\nx(t) = sin(9t + π/2)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nThis matches the standard form with A=1, B=1, a=9, b=5, and phase shift δ = π/2.\n\nFor such curves, where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers (GCD(a, b) = 1), there is a well-established formula for the number of self-intersection points (N). The formula depends on the parity of 'a' and 'b' and the phase shift 'δ'.\n\nThe relevant formula for δ = π/2 is:\n*   If both 'a' and 'b' are odd, N = (ab - 1) / 2.\n*   If one of 'a' or 'b' is even, N = (ab - 2) / 2.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the formula to the specific curve.**\nIn our case, a = 9 and b = 5.\n*   Check conditions:\n    *   GCD(9, 5) = 1. They are coprime.\n    *   Both a=9 and b=5 are odd integers.\n*   The phase shift is δ = π/2.\n\nThe conditions for the first case of the formula are met. Therefore, we can calculate the number of self-intersection points N as:\nN = (9 * 5 - 1) / 2\nN = (45 - 1) / 2\nN = 44 / 2\nN = 22\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Curve Identification:** Correctly identifying the curve as a Lissajous curve is crucial.\n2.  **Standard Form:** The equations must be brought into the standard form `x=sin(at+δ), y=sin(bt)` to apply the formula correctly. A time shift in parameter `t` does not change the geometric shape of the curve, only how it is traced. The curve (cos(9t), sin(5t)) is geometrically identical to (sin(9t+π/2), sin(5t)).\n3.  **Formula Conditions:** The conditions for the formula (coprime integers, parity, and phase shift) must be verified. In this problem, a=9 and b=5 are odd and coprime, and the phase shift is π/2, so the formula is applicable.\n4.  **Counting Points, Not Pairs:** The formula directly gives the number of unique self-intersection points, not the number of pairs of time values (t1, t2) that generate them. A single point can be an intersection for multiple pairs of time values if its multiplicity is greater than 2. A direct calculation of time pairs is much more complex and prone to errors in counting the final number of unique points.\n\nThe analysis using the standard formula for Lissajous curves provides a direct and reliable method to find the number of self-intersection points.\n\n<<<22>>>"
