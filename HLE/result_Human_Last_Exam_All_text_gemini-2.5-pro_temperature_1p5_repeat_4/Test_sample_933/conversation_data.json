    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Synthesis of Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF₄)**\nThe primary and most common method for synthesizing Xenon tetrafluoride is the direct chemical reaction between Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine (F₂) gas. The chemical equation for this reaction is:\nXe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Factors Affecting the Reaction**\nThe synthesis of xenon fluorides is highly sensitive to the reaction conditions. The specific product obtained (XeF₂, XeF₄, or XeF₆) depends mainly on three factors:\n1.  **Molar Ratio of Reactants (Xe:F₂):** This is crucial for controlling which fluoride is formed.\n2.  **Temperature:** The reaction is not spontaneous at room temperature and has a high activation energy, meaning heat is required to initiate it and maintain an efficient rate.\n3.  **Pressure:** The total pressure of the gaseous reactants also influences the reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Specific Conditions for Efficient XeF₄ Production**\nTo produce Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) efficiently and as the primary product, specific conditions are well-established in chemical literature:\n*   **Reactant Ratio:** While the stoichiometric ratio is 1:2 (Xe:F₂), an excess of fluorine is used in practice to favor the formation of XeF₄ over the lower fluoride, XeF₂. A common experimental ratio is approximately 1 part Xenon to 5 parts Fluorine (1:5).\n*   **Temperature:** The mixture of gases is heated in a sealed nickel vessel. The reaction proceeds efficiently at a specific temperature that is high enough to overcome the activation energy but not so high that it favors the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) or causes the product to decompose. The standard, widely-cited temperature for this synthesis is **400 °C**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Other Temperatures and the meaning of \"Efficiently\"**\nThe term \"efficiently\" implies a method that provides a good yield in a reasonable amount of time and is a standard, reproducible process.\n*   **Temperatures below 400 °C (e.g., 200 °C):** At lower temperatures, the rate of the reaction becomes significantly slower. While some XeF₄ might form over a very long period, the process would not be considered \"efficient.\"\n*   **Temperatures above 400 °C (e.g., 600 °C):** At much higher temperatures, and especially with a large excess of fluorine, the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) becomes more likely, reducing the yield and purity of the desired XeF₄.\n*   **Very Low Temperatures (e.g., 0 °C or -78 °C):** At these temperatures, the thermal energy is insufficient to initiate the reaction between Xe and F₂ gas. While alternative, non-standard methods exist (e.g., reaction with O₂F₂ at -118 °C or photochemical activation), the direct heating of the elements is the most common and \"efficient\" method in a general context.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude by Comparing with the Answer Choices**\nBased on the analysis, 400 °C is the established temperature for the efficient synthesis of XeF₄. It represents the optimal balance for reaction rate and product selectivity.\n*   A. 600 C: Too high.\n*   **B. 400 C:** The correct and standard temperature for efficient production.\n*   C. 200 C: Too low for an efficient reaction rate.\n*   D. 78 C: Far too low.\n*   E. 0 C: Far too low.\n*   F. -78 C: Far too low.\n\nTherefore, 400 °C is the coldest temperature listed at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently using the standard method.\n\n<<<B>>>"
