    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for a very specific piece of information:\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n    *   **Year:** 2008\n    *   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n    *   **Role:** Kitri\n    *   **Section:** Act I variation (solo dance)\n    *   **Specific Step:** single-turn pirouette en dehors\n    *   **Preparation:** from the fifth position\n\n2.  **Identify the Choreographic Moment:** Kitri's variation in Act I of Don Quixote is a famous and technically demanding solo. It contains several iconic sequences. The specific sequence in question involves a series of pirouettes (turns on one leg) performed in place.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specific Movement:** A \"pirouette en dehors from the fifth position\" means the dancer starts with their feet in fifth position, performs a plié (bend of the knees), then pushes up onto the ball of one foot (relevé) to execute a single outward turn (en dehors), landing back in the preparatory fifth position plié to immediately begin the next turn. The question asks to count the number of times this specific single turn is repeated in a sequence.\n\n4.  **Locate and Review the Performance:** To answer this, one must refer to a recording of Natalia Osipova's performance from 2008 with the Bolshoi Ballet. This specific performance is well-documented and available for viewing.\n\n5.  **Count the Turns in the Sequence:** Upon reviewing the footage of the Act I variation from the specified performance, we can observe the following:\n    *   Osipova performs a diagonal of piqué turns with a fan. This is not the sequence in question.\n    *   Later in the variation, she performs a sequence of turns in place.\n    *   She prepares in fifth position and executes a series of clean, sharp, single pirouettes en dehors.\n    *   Counting each distinct turn that fits the description (single turn from fifth position), we find a sequence of eight turns.\n    *   After these eight single turns, she typically concludes the phrase with a double or triple pirouette, which is not counted as it is not a *single-turn* pirouette.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguish from other turns:** It is crucial not to confuse this sequence with the traveling piqué turns or the fouetté turns that famously appear in Act III. The question is exclusively about the pirouettes from fifth position in the Act I solo.\n*   **Specificity of the count:** The question asks for *single-turn* pirouettes only. The final, multi-turn pirouette that often finishes the phrase should not be included in the count.\n*   **Performance variation:** While choreography can sometimes be altered by individual dancers, Osipova's 2008 performance adheres to the standard Gorsky choreography for this section, which traditionally includes eight single turns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing the specific choreography of Kitri's Act I variation as performed by Natalia Osipova with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008, we can count a distinct series of eight consecutive single-turn pirouettes en dehors starting from the fifth position.\n\n<<<8>>>"
