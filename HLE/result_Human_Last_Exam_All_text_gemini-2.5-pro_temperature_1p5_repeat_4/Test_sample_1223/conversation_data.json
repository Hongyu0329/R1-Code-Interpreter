    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the Question\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Cech remainder of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Let's break down the key terms:\n*   **$X$ is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum:**\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space.\n    *   An **indecomposable continuum** is one that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   A **hereditary indecomposable continuum (HIC)** is a continuum where every subcontinuum is also indecomposable. This is a very strong structural property. Examples include the pseudo-arc.\n*   **$x \\in X$:** A single point in the space.\n*   **$X \\setminus \\{x\\}$:** The space $X$ with the point $x$ removed. This is a locally compact, non-compact metric space.\n*   **Stone-Cech compactification of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$:** This is the largest compact Hausdorff space, denoted $\\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\})$, that contains $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ as a dense subspace.\n*   **Stone-Cech remainder:** The set of points in the compactification that are not in the original space. Here, it is $R_x = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n*   **Composants of the remainder:** A **composant** of a point $p$ in an indecomposable continuum $K$ is the set of all points $q \\in K$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $K$ containing both $p$ and $q$. The composants partition the space. The question implies that the remainder $R_x$ is an indecomposable continuum itself.\n\nThe goal is to find the maximum value for the number of composants of $R_x$, considering all possible choices for the HIC $X$ and the point $x \\in X$.\n\n### Step 2: Analysis and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Topological Properties of the Remainder $R_x$:**\n    *   Since $X$ is a compact metric space, it is separable. The space $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is an open subset of $X$, so it is locally compact. As $X$ is a continuum (infinite), $Y$ is not compact.\n    *   Since $X$ is indecomposable, it has no cut-points. Therefore, removing a single point $x$ does not disconnect the space, so $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is connected.\n    *   For any connected, locally compact, non-compact space, its Stone-Cech remainder is a non-empty, compact, and connected set. Thus, $R_x$ is a continuum.\n    *   Since $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a subspace of a separable metric space, it is separable. The remainder of a locally compact separable metric space is a compact metrizable space. So, $R_x$ is a metric continuum.\n\n2.  **The Structure of the Remainder (Bellamy's Theorem):**\n    A crucial theorem in continuum theory, due to David P. Bellamy (1970), provides the structure of this specific type of remainder.\n    *   **Theorem (Bellamy):** If $K$ is any metric continuum and $k \\in K$, then the Stone-Cech remainder $\\beta(K \\setminus \\{k\\}) \\setminus (K \\setminus \\{k\\})$ is a hereditarily indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Applying this theorem to our situation (by letting $K=X$ and $k=x$), we find that the remainder $R_x$ is a hereditarily indecomposable continuum (HIC). This is true for any choice of $X$ and $x$. Note that the hypothesis of the theorem requires only that $X$ be a metric continuum, so the fact that $X$ is an HIC is more than needed but does not change the outcome.\n\n3.  **Number of Composants of an Indecomposable Continuum:**\n    *   Our remainder, $R_x$, is an HIC. By definition, any HIC is indecomposable (unless it is a single point).\n    *   Let's analyze the number of composants in an indecomposable metric continuum $K'$.\n    *   A classical result by Mazurkiewicz shows that each composant of an indecomposable metric continuum is a meager set (i.e., a set of the first category - a countable union of nowhere dense sets).\n    *   The continuum $K'$ itself, being a compact metric space, is a complete metric space. The Baire Category Theorem states that a non-empty complete metric space is a Baire space, meaning it is not meager (it is of the second category).\n    *   Since the composants partition the entire space $K'$, if there were only countably many composants, $K'$ would be a countable union of meager sets. This would contradict the Baire Category Theorem.\n    *   Therefore, any non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum must have uncountably many composants.\n    *   A more precise result is that the number of composants is exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum ($2^{\\aleph_0}$). This is because a separable metric space has cardinality at most $\\mathfrak{c}$, so the number of disjoint composants cannot exceed $\\mathfrak{c}$. Combined with the fact that the number must be uncountable, it is established to be precisely $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n4.  **Determining the Maximum:**\n    *   From the above points, for any HIC $X$ and any $x \\in X$, the remainder $R_x$ is an HIC.\n    *   An HIC is either a single point (degenerate) or a non-degenerate continuum.\n    *   Case 1: $R_x$ is a single point. A single point is technically an HIC. It has exactly 1 composant (itself).\n    *   Case 2: $R_x$ is a non-degenerate HIC. In this case, it is a non-degenerate indecomposable metric continuum and thus has exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$ composants.\n    *   The question asks for the *maximum possible* number of composants. We need to know if Case 2 is possible. It is well-known that remainders can be non-degenerate continua. For example, when $X$ is the pseudo-arc, its remainder $R_x$ is a non-degenerate HIC.\n    *   Since it is possible for the remainder to be a non-degenerate HIC, it is possible for the number of composants to be $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   The number of composants of a separable space cannot exceed its cardinality, which is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   Therefore, the set of possible numbers of composants is a subset of $\\{1, \\mathfrak{c}\\}$. Since $\\mathfrak{c}$ is an attainable value, the maximum possible number is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Let $X$ be a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum and $x \\in X$.\n2.  Consider the remainder $R_x = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$.\n3.  By a theorem of D.P. Bellamy, $R_x$ is a hereditarily indecomposable continuum.\n4.  As a continuum, $R_x$ can be degenerate (a single point) or non-degenerate.\n5.  If $R_x$ were a single point, it would have 1 composant.\n6.  If $R_x$ is a non-degenerate hereditarily indecomposable continuum, it has exactly $\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ composants.\n7.  There exist choices of $X$ (e.g., the pseudo-arc) for which the remainder $R_x$ is a non-degenerate hereditarily indecomposable continuum.\n8.  Thus, $\\mathfrak{c}$ is an attainable number of composants.\n9.  The number of composants cannot exceed the cardinality of the space, which is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n10. Therefore, the maximum possible number of composants is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nFinal answer is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
