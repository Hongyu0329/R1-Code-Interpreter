    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type and Governing Rules**\nThe reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. The formation of `cis` and `trans` isomers of a cyclic product indicates an electrocyclic ring closure reaction.\nThe reacting system is a conjugated tetraene, which has 8 π electrons. The number of π electrons, 8, fits the `4n` rule (where `n=2`).\nThe reaction is conducted under \"thermal conditions\".\nAccording to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, which are derived from Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, a `4n` π-electron system under thermal conditions undergoes a **conrotatory** ring closure. FMO theory rationalizes this by examining the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which is ψ₄ for an octatetraene. The terminal lobes of ψ₄ have opposite phases, requiring a conrotatory motion for constructive overlap to form the new σ-bond.\n\n**2. Determine the Stereochemistry of the Reactant Conformation**\nFor an electrocyclic reaction to occur, the linear polyene must adopt a U-shaped conformation. We need to determine the orientation of the substituents on the terminal carbons of the conjugated system, which are C2 and C9. We define substituents as pointing \"inward\" (into the 'U') or \"outward\".\n\n*   **At C2 (from the 2Z double bond):** The rule for a Z-alkene is that the high-priority groups are on the same side. The substituents on C2 are a methyl group and a hydrogen. The substituents on C3 are the rest of the carbon chain and a hydrogen. The high-priority group on C2 is the methyl. The high-priority group on C3 is the chain. To form the 'U', the C3-C4 bond must point \"inward\". Since the C2=C3 bond is Z, the high-priority methyl group on C2 must also be on the same side, i.e., pointing **\"inward\"**. Consequently, the hydrogen on C2 points **\"outward\"**.\n*   **At C9 (from the 8E double bond):** The rule for an E-alkene is that the high-priority groups are on opposite sides. The substituents on C8 are the rest of the chain and H. The substituents on C9 are a methyl group and H. The high-priority group on C8 is the chain. The high-priority group on C9 is the methyl. In the 'U' shape, the C7-C8 bond must point \"inward\". Since the C8=C9 bond is E, the high-priority methyl group on C9 must be on the opposite side, i.e., pointing **\"outward\"**. Consequently, the hydrogen on C9 points **\"inward\"**.\n\n**3. Predict the Product from the Conrotatory Closure of the Starting Material**\n*   **Summary of termini:** At C2, we have Me(in)/H(out). At C9, we have H(in)/Me(out).\n*   **Conrotatory Motion:** During conrotatory closure, both termini rotate in the same direction (e.g., both clockwise). This motion brings the two \"inward\" groups (Me from C2, H from C9) to one face of the newly formed ring, and the two \"outward\" groups (H from C2, Me from C9) to the other face.\n*   **Resulting Stereochemistry:** The final product has one methyl group on one face and the other methyl group on the opposite face. This is the **`trans`-isomer (B)**.\n\n**4. Account for the Formation of the `cis`-Isomer (A)**\nThe problem explicitly states that two isomers are formed. Since the thermally allowed (conrotatory) pathway for the given starting material is stereospecific and yields only the `trans` product, the `cis` product must be formed via a different pathway. Under thermal conditions, double bonds can undergo isomerization. The formation of the `cis` product (A) must proceed through the cyclization of an isomer of the starting material, specifically \\((2E,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, which is in thermal equilibrium with the original (2Z...) isomer.\n\n**5. Analyze the Pathway to the `cis`-Isomer (A)**\n*   **Reactant:** \\((2E,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\n*   **Termini Analysis:**\n    *   At C2 (from the 2E double bond): The H is **\"inward\"** and the Me is **\"outward\"**.\n    *   At C9 (from the 8E double bond): The H is **\"inward\"** and the Me is **\"outward\"**.\n*   **Conrotatory Motion:** Conrotation brings the two \"inward\" groups (H from C2, H from C9) to one face and the two \"outward\" groups (Me from C2, Me from C9) to the other.\n*   **Resulting Stereochemistry:** Both methyl groups end up on the same face of the ring. This is the **`cis`-isomer (A)**.\n\n**6. Use FMO/Torquoselectivity to Predict the Ratio of A:B**\nWe have two competing pathways under kinetic control. The ratio of products is determined by the relative rates of the two cyclization reactions, which in turn depend on the activation energies (ΔG‡) of their respective transition states.\n\n*   **Pathway to B (`trans`):** Proceeds from the (2Z...) isomer. The transition state involves an \"inward\" pointing **methyl group**, which leads to significant steric strain and a high activation energy.\n*   **Pathway to A (`cis`):** Proceeds from the (2E...) isomer. The transition state involves only \"inward\" pointing **hydrogen atoms**. This is sterically much less demanding, resulting in a much lower activation energy.\n\nThis preference for a reaction pathway that minimizes steric hindrance in the transition state by having the smaller substituent rotate inward is known as **torquoselectivity**.\n\nBecause the activation barrier to form product A is significantly lower than that to form product B, the formation of A is much faster. Therefore, the **`cis`-isomer (A) is the major product**, and the `trans`-isomer (B) is the minor product. The difference in activation energy for relieving a Me/H clash in a crowded transition state is typically 2-3 kcal/mol. An energy difference of ~2.7 kcal/mol corresponds to a product ratio of approximately 99:1.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe ratio of `cis`-isomer A to `trans`-isomer B is predicted to be heavily skewed in favor of the `cis`-isomer due to the lower steric hindrance in its conrotatory transition state. A quantitative prediction based on established principles of torquoselectivity suggests a ratio of **99:1**.\n\n<<<99:1>>>"
