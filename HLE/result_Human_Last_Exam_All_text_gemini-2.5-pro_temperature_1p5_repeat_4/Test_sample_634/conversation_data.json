    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe need to find the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\n\nP2 = [[s, 0],\n      [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n**2. Definition of GCRD**\n\nA polynomial matrix `G(s)` is a greatest common right divisor of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` if:\n1.  `G(s)` is a right divisor of both `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`. This means there exist polynomial matrices `Q1(s)` and `Q2(s)` such that `P1(s) = Q1(s)G(s)` and `P2(s) = Q2(s)G(s)`.\n2.  If `D(s)` is any other common right divisor of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`, then `D(s)` is also a right divisor of `G(s)`. This means there exists a polynomial matrix `U(s)` such that `G(s) = U(s)D(s)`.\n\nThe GCRD is unique up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a square polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant). We typically provide the answer in a simple form, such as row-reduced or the identity matrix if possible.\n\n**3. Method: Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomial Matrices**\n\nA standard method to find the GCRD is to use an extension of the Euclidean algorithm. This involves performing elementary row operations on a stacked matrix formed from P1 and P2.\n\n**Step 1: Form the stacked matrix M**\n\nWe stack `P1` on top of `P2` to form a 4x2 matrix `M`:\nM = [P1]\n    [P2]\n\nM = [[s^2 + s, -s],      (R1)\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2],      (R2)\n     [s,       0],      (R3)\n     [-s - 1,  1]]      (R4)\n\n**Step 2: Perform Elementary Row Operations**\n\nOur goal is to reduce this matrix to the form `[G; 0]`, where `G` is a 2x2 matrix and `0` is the 2x2 zero matrix. The resulting `G` will be a GCRD of P1 and P2. The allowed elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\nLet's begin the reduction process.\n\n*   **Operation 1:** Add Row 3 to Row 4 (R4 -> R4 + R3). This is a good first step because it creates a constant element, which is an excellent pivot.\n    [-s - 1 + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]\n    The matrix becomes:\n    M_1 = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n           [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n           [s,       0],\n           [-1,      1]]\n\n*   **Operation 2:** To make the pivot element '1' and move it to the top, we swap Row 1 and Row 4 (R1 <-> R4) and then multiply the new Row 1 by -1 (R1 -> -1 * R1).\n    M_2 = [[-1,      1],      (after swap)\n           [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n           [s,       0],\n           [s^2 + s, -s]]\n    \n    M_3 = [[1,       -1],      (after multiplication)\n           [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n           [s,       0],\n           [s^2 + s, -s]]\n\n*   **Operation 3:** Now, use the new Row 1 (`[1, -1]`) to eliminate the first element in all other rows.\n    *   R2 -> R2 + (s^2 + 1) * R1:\n        `[-s^2 - 1 + (s^2+1)*1, s^2 + (s^2+1)*(-1)] = [0, s^2 - s^2 - 1] = [0, -1]`\n    *   R3 -> R3 - s * R1:\n        `[s - s*1, 0 - s*(-1)] = [0, s]`\n    *   R4 -> R4 - (s^2 + s) * R1:\n        `[s^2 + s - (s^2+s)*1, -s - (s^2+s)*(-1)] = [0, -s + s^2 + s] = [0, s^2]`\n    The matrix now is:\n    M_4 = [[1, -1],\n           [0, -1],\n           [0,  s],\n           [0, s^2]]\n\n*   **Operation 4:** We now focus on the second column. The entry in Row 2 (`-1`) is a constant, making it a good pivot. Let's make it '1' by R2 -> -1 * R2.\n    M_5 = [[1, -1],\n           [0,  1],\n           [0,  s],\n           [0, s^2]]\n\n*   **Operation 5:** Use the new Row 2 (`[0, 1]`) to eliminate the second element in all other rows.\n    *   R1 -> R1 + R2:\n        `[1+0, -1+1] = [1, 0]`\n    *   R3 -> R3 - s * R2:\n        `[0-s*0, s-s*1] = [0, 0]`\n    *   R4 -> R4 - s^2 * R2:\n        `[0-s^2*0, s^2-s^2*1] = [0, 0]`\n    The final reduced matrix is:\n    M_final = [[1, 0],\n               [0, 1],\n               [0, 0],\n               [0, 0]]\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the Result**\n\nThe matrix has been reduced to the form `[G; 0]`, where `G` is the non-zero part of the resulting matrix.\nG = [[1, 0],\n     [0, 1]]\n\nThis is the identity matrix, `I`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe greatest common right divisor of the matrices P1 and P2 is the identity matrix. This also means that P1 and P2 are \"right coprime\".\n\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
