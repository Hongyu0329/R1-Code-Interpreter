    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecule is toluene.\n*   Its chemical formula is C7H8.\n*   This means the molecule consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Basis Set Notation (6-31G)**\nA basis set defines how atomic orbitals are mathematically represented in the calculation. The term \"basis function\" in this context refers to a **contracted Gaussian function (CGF)**. The 6-31G notation describes how these functions are constructed from primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   The hyphen (-) separates the description of the core atomic orbitals from the valence atomic orbitals.\n*   **Core Orbitals (the '6'):** Each core atomic orbital is represented by a single contracted Gaussian function (1 CGF), which is formed by a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n*   **Valence Orbitals (the '31'):** This is a \"split-valence\" basis set, meaning each valence atomic orbital is represented by two contracted Gaussian functions.\n    *   **Inner Valence (the '3'):** The first CGF is formed from a combination of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **Outer Valence (the '1'):** The second CGF is just a single primitive Gaussian function.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Number of Contracted Functions per Atom**\n\n**For a Carbon (C) atom:**\n*   Atomic number: 6. Electronic configuration: 1s², 2s²2p².\n*   **Core Orbital:** The 1s orbital is a core orbital. According to the '6' in 6-31G, it is represented by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence Orbitals:** The 2s and three 2p (2px, 2py, 2pz) orbitals are valence orbitals. There are 4 valence orbitals in total.\n*   According to the '31' (split-valence) part of the basis set name, each of these 4 valence orbitals is described by two CGFs (an inner and an outer part).\n*   Number of CGFs for valence orbitals = 4 valence orbitals × 2 CGFs/orbital = **8 CGFs**.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom** = 1 (for core 1s) + 8 (for valence 2s and 2p) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**For a Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n*   Atomic number: 1. Electronic configuration: 1s¹.\n*   **Core Orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons.\n*   **Valence Orbital:** The 1s orbital is the only valence orbital.\n*   According to the '31' part, this single valence orbital is split into two CGFs.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom** = 1 valence orbital × 2 CGFs/orbital = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Contracted Gaussian Functions for Toluene (C7H8)**\nNow, we sum the CGFs for all the atoms in the molecule.\n*   Contribution from the 7 Carbon atoms:\n    7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/C atom = 63 CGFs\n*   Contribution from the 8 Hydrogen atoms:\n    8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/H atom = 16 CGFs\n*   **Total Contracted Gaussian Functions:**\n    63 (from C) + 16 (from H) = 79 CGFs\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   Distinguish between contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs) and primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs). The question specifically asks for contracted functions.\n*   Correctly identify which electrons/orbitals are core and which are valence for each element.\n*   Understand that \"split-valence\" means each valence orbital is represented by more than one basis function. In the case of 6-31G, it's two.\n*   Accurately count the number of atoms of each element in the molecule.\n\n<<<79>>>"
