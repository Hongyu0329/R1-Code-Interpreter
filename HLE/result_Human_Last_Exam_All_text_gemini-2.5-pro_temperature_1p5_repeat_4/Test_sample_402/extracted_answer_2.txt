A command-line filtering strategy that leverages the differential contamination between the two groups. First, perform a differential gene expression analysis comparing CAR-only vs. CAR-IL15 samples, ensuring the paired donor design is accounted for. From the results, generate a list of genes with a very high positive log2 fold change (e.g., > 5), as these represent signals primarily present in the contaminated CAR-only group. Cross-reference this list against a pre-compiled list of genes known to be expressed in the contaminating cancer cell line to create a final, high-confidence list of contaminant genes. Finally, use this definitive list to filter out the corresponding genes from the full differential expression results table, yielding a clean dataset for downstream biological interpretation. This can be implemented using a series of `awk` and `grep` commands to identify, intersect, and remove the contaminant gene lists from the results file.
