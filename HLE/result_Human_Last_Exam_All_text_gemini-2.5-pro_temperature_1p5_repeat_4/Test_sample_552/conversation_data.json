    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks for a specific person whose *lectures* were *cited* by Albert Einstein in his *1905 paper on Brownian motion*.\n\n*   **Subject:** Albert Einstein\n*   **Document:** 1905 paper on Brownian motion (\"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\").\n*   **Action:** A citation within that paper.\n*   **Object of Citation:** A set of \"lectures\".\n\n**Step 2: Understand the context of Einstein's 1905 paper.**\nEinstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion was groundbreaking because it provided a theoretical framework, based on the kinetic theory of heat, to explain the random, observable motion of particles suspended in a fluid. This work offered strong evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules. The theoretical foundation for this paper rests heavily on the principles of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.\n\n**Step 3: Search for citations within the paper.**\nUnlike modern scientific papers with a formal bibliography, papers from that era often incorporated citations directly into the text. We need to look for phrases that credit another scientist's work. The key is to look for a reference not just to a person, but specifically to their \"lectures\".\n\n**Step 4: Locate the specific citation.**\nIn Section 4 of the paper, titled \"On Osmotic Pressure from the Standpoint of the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Einstein discusses the law governing osmotic pressure. He makes a direct reference to the work that clarified the physical foundations of this law.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the cited scientist and their work.**\nThe original German text reads: \"...Die physikalischen Grundlagen dieses dem Boyle-Gay-Lussacschen Gesetze entsprechenden Gesetzes sind, namentlich durch **Boltzmann** in seinen **Gastheorie-Vorlesungen**, im einzelnen klargelegt worden.\"\n\nThis translates to: \"The physical foundations of this law, which corresponds to the Boyle-Gay-Lussac law, have been clarified in detail, especially by **Boltzmann** in his **Lectures on Gas Theory**.\"\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Be specific:** The question is not about general influences (like Ernst Mach or Isaac Newton) but about a direct citation in a specific paper.\n*   **Focus on \"Lectures\":** The key term is \"lectures\" (\"Vorlesungen\" in German). This points to a published collection of lectures, not just a concept or a single paper. Boltzmann's \"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\" (\"Lectures on Gas Theory\") fits this description perfectly.\n*   **Verify the source:** The claim is directly verifiable by inspecting the text of Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n*   **Distinguish from other figures:** While others worked on the kinetic theory (like Maxwell), the explicit citation in this paper, referencing \"lectures,\" points specifically to Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the text of Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion, we can confirm that he explicitly cited Ludwig Boltzmann's \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" as having clarified the physical foundations of the laws of osmotic pressure, which was a key element of his argument.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
