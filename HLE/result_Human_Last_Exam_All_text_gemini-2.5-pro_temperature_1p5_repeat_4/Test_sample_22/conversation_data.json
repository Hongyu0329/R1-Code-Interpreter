    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n**Step 1: Define the core concepts.**\n\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a population parameter that represents the proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by the additive effects of all common Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) considered together. It represents the *theoretical maximum* variance that could be explained if we knew the true causal effect of every single SNP and could combine them perfectly in a linear model. It's the \"ceiling\" of predictability using these genetic markers. It is estimated using methods like GCTA-GREML or LD Score Regression.\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a practical tool. It's a score calculated for an individual by summing up their genotypes at many SNPs, with each SNP's contribution weighted by its *estimated* effect size. These effect size estimates are derived from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS:** This is a measure of how well the PGS can predict the actual phenotype in an independent sample of individuals (i.e., individuals not used to create the PGS). It is typically measured by R², the proportion of variance in the phenotype that is explained by the PGS.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the relationship between SNP heritability and PGS predictive ability.**\n\nThe core of the question is the relationship between a *theoretical maximum* (SNP heritability) and a *practical implementation* (PGS predictive ability).\n\n*   SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the target: It's the total amount of signal available in the SNPs.\n*   The predictive ability of a PGS (R²) is the attempt to capture that signal.\n\n**Step 3: Identify why the practical implementation (PGS) is necessarily less effective than the theoretical maximum (SNP heritability).**\n\nA PGS will not be able to capture the full SNP heritability for several key reasons:\n\n1.  **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** The effect sizes used to build a PGS are *estimates* from a GWAS with a finite number of participants. These estimates are not perfect; they contain statistical noise (sampling error). A PGS built with these noisy estimates will be less accurate than a hypothetical score built with the true, unknown effect sizes. This is the single largest reason for the discrepancy.\n2.  **Imperfect Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) Modeling:** SNPs are often correlated with each other (a phenomenon called LD). The GWAS may identify an SNP that is not causal itself but is simply correlated with the true causal SNP. PGS construction methods (like clumping and thresholding, or more advanced methods like LDpred) try to account for this complex correlation structure, but they are not perfect. This imperfect modeling reduces predictive accuracy.\n3.  **Mismatched Populations:** The LD structure and allele frequencies can differ between the population used for the GWAS and the population in which the PGS is being tested. This mismatch will lower the predictive ability of the PGS.\n4.  **\"Winner's Curse\":** SNP effects discovered in a GWAS are often overestimates of the true effect size, especially for those that just meet the threshold for statistical significance. Using these inflated estimates in a PGS will reduce its accuracy in a new sample.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the conclusion.**\n\nBecause a polygenic score is constructed using *estimated* information from a real-world study of finite size, it is subject to statistical noise and modeling imperfections. These imperfections mean that a PGS can only ever capture a fraction of the total heritable signal present in the SNPs. The SNP heritability represents the total available signal—the absolute upper bound on prediction accuracy. Therefore, the variance explained by a polygenic score (R²) is necessarily lower than the total SNP heritability (h²_SNP). The relationship is formally `R²_PGS ≤ h²_SNP`, where equality would only be reached in a hypothetical, impossible scenario of an infinitely large GWAS and a perfect PGS model.\n\nThe statement is correct.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
