    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Pauli Channel ($\\Lambda$)**\n\n*   A qudit is a quantum system of dimension $d$. Its state is described by a $d \\times d$ density matrix $\\rho$.\n*   The generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) $\\{U_{j,k}\\}_{j,k=0}^{d-1}$ form an orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$. There are $d^2$ such operators.\n*   A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel defined by its action on a density matrix $\\rho$ as:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{j,k} U_{j,k} \\rho U_{j,k}^\\dagger $$\n*   Here, $\\{p_{j,k}\\}$ represents a probability distribution, meaning $p_{j,k} \\ge 0$ for all $j, k$, and $\\sum_{j,k} p_{j,k} = 1$.\n*   The Kraus operators for this channel can be chosen as $A_{j,k} = \\sqrt{p_{j,k}} U_{j,k}$. The channel is completely positive and trace-preserving.\n\n**2. Defining the Channel Rank**\n\n*   The rank of a quantum channel is a measure of its complexity. There are several equivalent definitions.\n*   One definition is the minimum number of Kraus operators required in the operator-sum representation of the channel.\n*   Another equivalent definition is the rank of the channel's Choi matrix, $J(\\Lambda)$. The Choi matrix is defined by applying the channel to one half of a maximally entangled state:\n    $$ J(\\Lambda) = (\\text{id} \\otimes \\Lambda)(|\\Phi\\rangle\\langle\\Phi|) $$\n    where $|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} |i\\rangle \\otimes |i\\rangle$. The rank of this $d^2 \\times d^2$ matrix is the rank of the channel.\n*   **Careful Point:** For a Pauli channel, the Kraus operators $A_{j,k} = \\sqrt{p_{j,k}} U_{j,k}$ are built from the linearly independent Pauli basis operators $\\{U_{j,k}\\}$. Therefore, the number of linearly independent Kraus operators is simply the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{j,k}$. This number is the rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n**3. Understanding the Complementary Channel ($\\Lambda^c$)**\n\n*   Any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ can be described by a physical interaction with an environment, initially in a pure state $|e_0\\rangle$. This is the Stinespring dilation theorem. There exists a unitary operator $U$ acting on the system and environment combined, such that:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E [ U (\\rho \\otimes |e_0\\rangle\\langle e_0|) U^\\dagger ] $$\n*   The complementary channel, $\\Lambda^c$, describes the resulting state of the environment. It is obtained by tracing out the system instead of the environment:\n    $$ \\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_{\\text{sys}} [ U (\\rho \\otimes |e_0\\rangle\\langle e_0|) U^\\dagger ] $$\n*   **Careful Point:** The input to $\\Lambda^c$ is the original system's state $\\rho$, but its output is the environment's state. The dimension of the environment space must be at least the rank of the channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n**4. The Core Relationship: Rank($\\Lambda$) vs. Rank($\\Lambda^c$)**\n\n*   This is the most critical part of the analysis. There is a fundamental relationship between the rank of a channel and the rank of its complementary channel.\n*   Let's consider a tripartite pure state $|\\Psi\\rangle_{RBE}$ created by applying the channel's unitary $U$ to one part of a maximally entangled state shared between a reference system R and the original system A (which becomes B after the channel), plus the environment E.\n    $$ |\\Psi\\rangle_{RBE} = (I_R \\otimes U_{AE}) (|\\Phi\\rangle_{RA} \\otimes |e_0\\rangle_E) $$\n*   The Choi matrix of the original channel, $J(\\Lambda)$, is the state obtained by tracing out the environment E from $|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|_{RBE}$.\n    $$ J(\\Lambda) \\cong \\rho_{RB} = \\text{Tr}_E (|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|_{RBE}) $$\n*   The Choi matrix of the complementary channel, $J(\\Lambda^c)$, is the state obtained by tracing out the system B from $|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|_{RBE}$.\n    $$ J(\\Lambda^c) \\cong \\rho_{RE} = \\text{Tr}_B (|\\Psi\\rangle\\langle\\Psi|_{RBE}) $$\n*   A key result from quantum information theory (based on the properties of the Schmidt decomposition) states that the ranks of the partial traces of any pure state are equal. Therefore:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\rho_{RB}) = \\text{rank}(\\rho_{RE}) $$\n*   This directly implies that the ranks of the Choi matrices are equal, and thus the ranks of the channels are equal:\n    $$ \\text{rank}(\\Lambda) = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) $$\n*   **Careful Point:** This equality of ranks is a completely general property for any quantum channel, not just Pauli channels.\n\n**5. Maximizing the Rank**\n\n*   Based on the conclusion from Step 4, the problem of finding the maximal rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is equivalent to finding the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n*   From Step 2, the rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is the number of non-zero probabilities $\\{p_{j,k}\\}$ in its definition.\n*   The indices $(j,k)$ range from $(0,0)$ to $(d-1, d-1)$, giving a total of $d^2$ possible Pauli operations.\n*   To maximize the rank, we need to maximize the number of these probabilities that are non-zero. Since $\\{p_{j,k}\\}$ is a probability distribution over $d^2$ outcomes, it is possible for all $d^2$ probabilities to be non-zero.\n*   An example of such a channel is the **completely depolarizing channel**, where $p_{j,k} = 1/d^2$ for all $j,k$. In this case, all $d^2$ Kraus operators are non-zero and linearly independent.\n*   Therefore, the maximum possible rank for a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nThe maximal rank of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$. Since the rank of a channel is always equal to the rank of its complementary channel, the maximal rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is also $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
