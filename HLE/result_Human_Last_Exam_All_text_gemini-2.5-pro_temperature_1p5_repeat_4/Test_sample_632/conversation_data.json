    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome. This is the square directly in front of the Pantheon.\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\" located *within* the square. This rules out the Pantheon itself or the surrounding buildings.\n    *   **Action:** The feature was \"removed\".\n    *   **Agent of Removal:** \"the city administration\". This implies an official urban planning or public works decision.\n    *   **Timeframe:** It existed \"until 1950\", at which point it was removed.\n\n2.  **Listing Careful Points & Eliminating Possibilities:**\n    *   **The Pantheon:** This is the famous church *hosted* by the square, not a feature within it that was removed. It is still there.\n    *   **The Fontana del Pantheon (Fountain of the Pantheon):** This is the large fountain with the Egyptian obelisk in the center of the square. It was installed in stages between the 16th and 18th centuries and is still a central feature today. It was not removed in 1950.\n    *   **Surrounding Buildings:** While the facades of buildings have changed over centuries, the question points to a distinct \"feature\" rather than an entire building. A mass demolition in 1950 isn't documented as the key event.\n    *   **Market Stalls:** For centuries, the piazza hosted a market, but this was cleared in the late 19th century (around 1873), not 1950. Therefore, this doesn't fit the timeframe.\n\n3.  **Investigating Urban Changes around 1950:**\n    *   The period after World War II and leading up to the 1950 Jubilee Year saw significant changes in Rome's urban infrastructure. A major focus was on modernizing transportation.\n    *   During the first half of the 20th century, Rome had an extensive network of public tramways (streetcars). Historical photographs clearly show tram tracks circling the central fountain in the Piazza della Rotonda, passing directly in front of the Pantheon.\n    *   These tram lines, with their tracks embedded in the cobblestones and their overhead electrical wires, were a very prominent, man-made feature of the square's landscape.\n    *   In the late 1940s and into the 1950s, the city administration made a strategic decision to dismantle many tram lines in the historic center. They were considered noisy, slow, and visually obtrusive, obstructing views of ancient monuments. The city favored more flexible bus routes.\n    *   The removal of the tram line from the Piazza della Rotonda was part of this larger project to \"clean up\" the historic center and improve traffic flow for rubber-tired vehicles. This action and its timing perfectly match the parameters of the question.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe \"unique architectural feature\" (more accurately, an urban infrastructure feature) that was a defining characteristic of the Piazza della Rotonda for decades and was removed by the city administration around 1950 was the public tramway line.\n\n<<<The public tramway line>>>"
