    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the riddle's core elements.**\n*   **Source:** A Russian translation of an essay.\n*   **Subject:** A description of the wide boulevards of Vienna.\n*   **Clue:** In this description, the surname of an English poet appears.\n*   **Question:** What is the English surname?\n\nThis structure strongly suggests a wordplay or a homophone puzzle. The word that appears in the Russian text must sound like or be spelled identically to the Russian transliteration of an English poet's surname.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the context: \"wide boulevards of Vienna\".**\nVienna's most famous boulevard is the Ringstrasse, which is renowned for its grand, and often opulent, historicist architecture from the late 19th century. This style, which mixes elements from different historical periods (Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque), was viewed by some, particularly later modernist critics, as excessively ornate and sentimental.\n\n**Step 3: Identify a relevant descriptive word.**\nA key critical term used to describe art or architecture that is considered overly sentimental, garish, or in poor taste is the German word \"Kitsch\". This word is an international loanword and is used in many languages, including Russian. The Russian spelling for \"Kitsch\" is **китч**.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the descriptive word to an English poet.**\nNow we must find an English poet whose surname, when transliterated into Russian, sounds identical or nearly identical to \"китч\" (kitsch).\nLet's consider the famous English Romantic poet, John Keats.\nThe English surname \"Keats\" is transliterated into Russian as **Китс**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Russian words.**\n*   The Russian word for the aesthetic concept is **китч** (kitch).\n*   The Russian transliteration of the poet's surname is **Китс** (Kits).\n\nIn Russian, these two words are phonetically almost identical. A native speaker hearing or reading one could easily be reminded of the other.\n\n**Step 6: Formulate the final conclusion.**\nIt is highly plausible that a Russian essay describing the eclectic architecture along Vienna's boulevards would use the term \"китч\". In doing so, the surname of the poet \"Keats\" (\"Китс\") would phonetically appear in the text.\n\nTherefore, the surname of the English poet is Keats.\n\n<<<Keats>>>"
