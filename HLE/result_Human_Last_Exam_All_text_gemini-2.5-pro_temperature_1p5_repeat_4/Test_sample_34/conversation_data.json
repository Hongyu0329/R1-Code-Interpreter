    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button in the specified poker scenario.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:**\n    *   **Game:** 100BB rake-free cash game.\n        *   **100BB effective stacks:** This is a standard stack depth, meaning we will use standard, GTO-based (Game Theory Optimal) pre-flop strategies.\n        *   **Rake-free:** This is a critical detail. Rake is the fee taken by the house from a pot. Its absence means that marginal hands become more profitable to play because you get to keep the entire pot when you win. This incentivizes playing a wider, or \"looser,\" range of hands.\n        *   **Cash game:** The goal is to maximize chip EV (Expected Value) in every single hand, without tournament-specific considerations like ICM or survival.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN).\n        *   The button is the best and most profitable position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street (flop, turn, and river).\n        *   This positional advantage allows you to realize your hand's equity much more effectively than players out of position. Consequently, the button has the widest opening range of any position.\n    *   **Action:** Open to 2.5x.\n        *   This is a standard opening size. The strategy will be based on GTO solutions for this common scenario.\n\n2.  **Understand the Question:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"*worst suited jack you should open*.\"\n    *   This means we are looking for the suited jack hand (Jxs) with the lowest Expected Value (EV) that is still profitable (has a positive EV) to open-raise. Any suited jack weaker than this hand would be a fold.\n    *   The answer should be the hand at the very bottom of the suited jack section of a button opening range chart.\n\n3.  **Rank the Suited Jack Hands:**\n    *   Suited hands derive their value from high-card strength, flush potential, and straight potential.\n    *   All hands in question are suited, so they share the same flush potential.\n    *   Their value is therefore differentiated by their high-card strength (the kicker) and their connectivity (ability to make straights).\n    *   Ranking the non-premium suited jacks from best to worst:\n        *   **JTs:** Strongest. Good high card, excellent connectivity (connects up and down).\n        *   **J9s:** Very strong. One-gapper for straights.\n        *   **J8s:** Strong. Two-gapper.\n        *   **J7s:** Good.\n        *   **J6s:** Decent.\n        *   **J5s:** Playable.\n        *   **J4s:** Marginal.\n        *   **J3s:** Weaker.\n        *   **J2s:** The weakest. Lowest kicker and worst connectivity (largest gap for making straights).\n\n4.  **Determine the Opening Range:**\n    *   Combining the button's powerful position with the rake-free environment creates a very wide optimal opening range. A GTO-based opening range from the button in this scenario is approximately 50-52% of all possible hands.\n    *   We need to consult what a GTO pre-flop chart for this specific situation looks like.\n    *   According to GTO solvers, in a rake-free, 100BB cash game, the button's opening range is so wide that it includes **all** suited jack hands.\n    *   Hands like K2s, Q2s, T2s, and even 92s are typically considered profitable open-raises from the button in a rake-free game. It follows logically that J2s, which is stronger than T2s and 92s, is also a standard open.\n\n5.  **Identify the Target Hand:**\n    *   Since a GTO strategy advises opening all suited jacks from the button (JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s), we must find the weakest one on that list.\n    *   Based on the ranking in Step 3, the objectively weakest hand due to its low kicker and poor connectivity is J2s.\n    *   While it's the \"worst\" among the suited jacks, its profitability is still positive in this highly advantageous spot (on the button, in a rake-free game), making it a hand you *should open*.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe weakest suited Jack that remains a profitable open-raise from the button in a 100BB deep, rake-free game is the one with the lowest kicker, which is J2s. Any suited jack below this does not exist.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
