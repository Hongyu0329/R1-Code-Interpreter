    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core of the Question**\nThe question asks for the earliest *date* that was *recorded* by a pre-Columbian civilization using their own native (aboriginal) writing system. This requires identifying artifacts with decipherable dates and comparing them to find the oldest one.\n\n**Step 2: Differentiate Between Types of Calendrical Records**\nPre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations used several calendars. For this question, two are most important:\n*   **The 260-day Sacred Calendar (Tzolk'in in Maya):** A cycle of 20 day-names and 13 numbers (e.g., \"7 Deer,\" \"1 Earthquake\"). A date like \"7 Deer\" repeats every 260 days, so by itself, it does not specify a year.\n*   **The Long Count Calendar:** An absolute, non-repeating calendar that pinpoints a specific day in a grand cycle of roughly 5,125 years. This is the most precise system for recording a specific historical date. A Long Count date can be converted to a specific date in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the Evidence for the Earliest *Use* of Calendar Glyphs**\n*   **Artifact:** Monument 3 from San José Mogote (a Zapotec site).\n*   **Date of Artifact:** Stylistically dated to approximately **600 BCE**.\n*   **Record:** It features a glyph interpreted as \"1 Earthquake.\"\n*   **Careful Point:** While this is extremely early evidence of the 260-day calendar, scholars widely interpret this as the calendrical *name* of a sacrificed captive, not as a record of the date when an event occurred. Therefore, it's considered evidence of the calendar system's existence, but not the recording of a historical date.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the Evidence for the Earliest *Recorded Date* (from the 260-day calendar)**\n*   **Artifact:** Painted wall fragments from the Las Pinturas pyramid at San Bartolo, Guatemala (a Maya site).\n*   **Date of Artifact:** The fragments have been securely dated by radiocarbon analysis to between **300 BCE and 200 BCE**.\n*   **Record:** The fragments clearly depict the date \"7 Deer.\"\n*   **Careful Point:** This is currently the oldest *securely dated example of written calendrics* in the Americas. However, because it is a 260-day cycle date, it cannot be converted to a precise day and year in our calendar. We know the writing is from ~250 BCE, but not the exact day \"7 Deer\" referred to.\n\n**Step 5: Examine the Evidence for the Earliest *Long Count Date***\nThe Long Count system provides a specific, absolute date. This is the most precise answer to \"what date was recorded.\"\n*   **Artifact:** Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, a site in Chiapas, Mexico.\n*   **Date of Artifact:** Late Preclassic period.\n*   **Record:** The stela is inscribed with the Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Using the standard Goodman-Martínez-Thompson (GMT) correlation, this date corresponds directly to a single, non-repeating day in history. Another very early Long Count date from Tres Zapotes (32 BCE) is slightly later.\n\n**Step 6: Convert the Long Count Date and Conclude**\nThe Long Count date from Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (7.16.3.2.13) is translated to the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The result is the earliest *specific, absolute date* known to have been recorded. While the San Bartolo fragments contain older *writing* of a date, the Chiapa de Corzo stela records an earlier, chronologically fixed *point in time*.\n\nThe date recorded on the stela is **December 7, 36 BCE**.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe earliest known absolute date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in an aboriginal writing system is from Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico. The Long Count date inscribed, 7.16.3.2.13, correlates to **December 7, 36 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<December 7, 36 BCE>>>"
