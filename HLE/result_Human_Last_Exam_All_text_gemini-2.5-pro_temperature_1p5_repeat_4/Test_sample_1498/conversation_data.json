    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam that mention the names of the Prophets.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Poem and the Specific Section:** The poem is 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam (عقيدة العوام) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi. We are looking for the section that enumerates the 25 Prophets whose names are mentioned in the Qur'an and whose knowledge is considered obligatory for a Muslim according to the author.\n\n2.  **Locate the Introductory Verse:** The poem systematically introduces each topic. The section on the Prophets begins with a verse that states the number of prophets to be known. This is Bayt (verse) number 29:\n    *   **Bayt 29:**\n        > تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ\n        > كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding upon every responsible person, so verify and take this as a gain.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This verse serves as an introduction. It tells us that the following verses will detail these 25 prophets, but it does not list any names itself.\n\n3.  **Find the First Verse with Names:** The very next verse begins the enumeration of the Prophets.\n    *   **Bayt 30:**\n        > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودٌ مَعْ\n        > صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim; each is to be followed.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the starting point of the list of names.\n\n4.  **Trace the Continuation of the List:** We need to follow the subsequent verses that continue listing the names until the list is complete.\n    *   **Bayt 31:**\n        > لُوطٌ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ إِسْحَاقُ كَذَا\n        > يَعْقُوبُ يُوسُفُ وَأَيُّوبُ احْتَذَى\n    *   **Translation:** \"Lut and Isma'il, Ishaq as well, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub followed.\"\n    *   **Bayt 32:**\n        > شُعَيْبُ هَارُونُ وَمُوسَى وَالْيَسَعْ\n        > ذُو الْكِفْلِ دَاوُدُ سُلَيْمَانُ اتَّبَعْ\n    *   **Translation:** \"Shu'ayb, Harun, and Musa, and al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman followed.\"\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Verse of the List:** We look for the verse that contains the last of the 25 Prophets.\n    *   **Bayt 33:**\n        > إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\n        > عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *   **Translation:** \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), the Seal [of the Prophets], so leave misguidance.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This verse concludes the list with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, referred to as \"Taha\" and the \"Khatim\" (Seal).\n\n6.  **Examine the Concluding Verse:** The verse immediately following the list does not name any more prophets but sends blessings upon them, confirming the end of the section.\n    *   **Bayt 34:**\n        > عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ\n        > وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ\n    *   **Translation:** \"Upon them be peace and blessings, and upon their families, as long as the days endure.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguish Introduction from the List:** Bayt 29 is an introduction and not part of the enumeration itself. The question asks from which bayt the *names* are mentioned.\n*   **The Starting Point:** The list of names explicitly begins in Bayt 30.\n*   **The Ending Point:** The list of names is completed within Bayt 33.\n*   **Verse Numbering:** The numbering (29, 30, 31, 32, 33) is based on the most common and standard editions of the poem.\n*   **Name of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:** He is referred to as \"Taha\" (طه) in Bayt 33.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThe enumeration of the Prophets' names begins in Bayt 30 and concludes in Bayt 33. Therefore, the names are mentioned from Bayt 30 to Bayt 33, inclusive.\n\n<<<From Bayt 30 to Bayt 33.>>>"
