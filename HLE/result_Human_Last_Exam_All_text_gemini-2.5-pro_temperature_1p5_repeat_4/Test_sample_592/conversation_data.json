    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core question.**\nThe user wants to know the specific US city to which the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 movie *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 2: Break down the query into key information points.**\n*   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (Hard Boiled Egg)\n*   **Year:** 1997\n*   **Character:** Tommaso\n*   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n*   **Action:** Moves to a city in the United States.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the plot of the movie *Ovosodo*.**\nThe film follows the life of the protagonist, Piero Mansani, in Livorno, Italy. A key secondary character is his best friend, Tommaso Paladini, who is played by Marco Cocci.\n\n**Step 4: Trace the storyline of the character Tommaso.**\nTommaso comes from a wealthy but troubled family. He is portrayed as restless and searching for meaning, experimenting with various pursuits. In contrast to his friend Piero who remains in their hometown, Tommaso decides to leave Italy to find his own path.\n\n**Step 5: Pinpoint the destination of Tommaso's move.**\nIn the film's narrative, Tommaso decides to move to the United States to study philosophy. A search of detailed plot summaries and film analyses confirms his specific destination.\n\n**Step 6: Verify the city from multiple sources.**\nPlot summaries from film databases and Italian cinema websites consistently state that Tommaso moves to New York to pursue his university studies. This move serves as a significant contrast to the protagonist Piero's life, who stays in Livorno.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Character Distinction:** It is important not to confuse the character in question, Tommaso, with the film's main protagonist, Piero. The question is specifically about Tommaso's journey.\n*   **Fictional Narrative:** The question is about the events within the movie's plot, not the real-life travels of the actor.\n*   **Source Reliability:** Cross-referencing the information with multiple reliable sources (film databases, detailed reviews, encyclopedic entries) ensures accuracy.\n\nBased on this analysis, the US city Tommaso moves to is New York.\n\n<<<New York>>>"
