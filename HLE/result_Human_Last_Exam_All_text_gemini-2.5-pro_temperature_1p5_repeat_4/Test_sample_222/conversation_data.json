    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n*   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nWe need to find the 8-point DFT of a new sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n**2. Relate the New Sequence to the Original Sequences**\n\nLet's look at the structure of `y(n)`:\n*   The even-indexed samples of `y(n)` are the samples of `x(n)`. Let's define `g(n) = y(2n)`.\n    `g(n) = {y(0), y(2), y(4), y(6)} = {x(0), x(1), x(2), x(3)} = x(n)`\n*   The odd-indexed samples of `y(n)` are the samples of `h(n)`. Let's define `p(n) = y(2n+1)`.\n    `p(n) = {y(1), y(3), y(5), y(7)} = {h(0), h(1), h(2), h(3)} = h(n)`\n\n**3. Use the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) FFT Property**\n\nThe DFT of a sequence can be computed from the DFTs of its even and odd parts. This is the fundamental principle behind the Radix-2 DIT Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.\nIf `Y(k)` is the N-point DFT of `y(n)`, `G(k)` is the (N/2)-point DFT of its even part `g(n)`, and `P(k)` is the (N/2)-point DFT of its odd part `p(n)`, the relationship is:\n\n`Y(k) = G(k mod N/2) + W_N^k * P(k mod N/2)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., N-1`.\n\nIn our case:\n*   `N = 8`, so `N/2 = 4`.\n*   `g(n) = x(n)`, so its DFT `G(k)` is `X(k)`.\n*   `p(n) = h(n)`, so its DFT `P(k)` is `H(k)`.\n*   The twiddle factor is `W_8^k = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / 8) = exp(-j * pi * k / 4)`.\n\nThe formula becomes:\n`Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`\n\nThis can be split into two parts for easier computation (the \"butterfly\" structure):\n*   For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`: `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n*   For `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`: `Y(k+4) = X(k) + W_8^(k+4) * H(k) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` (since `W_8^4 = -1`)\n\n**4. Calculate Necessary Twiddle Factors**\n\nWe need `W_8^k` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   `W_8^0 = exp(0) = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = exp(-j*pi/4) = cos(pi/4) - j*sin(pi/4) = (1/√2) - j(1/√2)`\n*   `W_8^2 = exp(-j*pi/2) = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = exp(-j*3pi/4) = cos(3pi/4) - j*sin(3pi/4) = -(1/√2) - j(1/√2)`\n\n**5. Perform the Calculations**\n\n*   **For k = 0:**\n    *   `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + 1 * 0 = 1`\n    *   `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - 1 * 0 = 1`\n\n*   **For k = 1:**\n    *   `Term = W_8^1 * H(1) = [(1/√2) - j(1/√2)] * (1+j) = (1/√2) * (1-j)(1+j) = (1/√2) * (1 - j^2) = (1/√2) * 2 = √2`\n    *   `Y(1) = X(1) + Term = j + √2 = √2 + j`\n    *   `Y(5) = X(1) - Term = j - √2 = -√2 + j`\n\n*   **For k = 2:**\n    *   `Term = W_8^2 * H(2) = (-j) * 1 = -j`\n    *   `Y(2) = X(2) + Term = -1 + (-j) = -1 - j`\n    *   `Y(6) = X(2) - Term = -1 - (-j) = -1 + j`\n\n*   **For k = 3:**\n    *   `Term = W_8^3 * H(3) = [-(1/√2) - j(1/√2)] * (1-j) = -(1/√2) * (1+j)(1-j) = -(1/√2) * (1 - j^2) = -(1/√2) * 2 = -√2`\n    *   `Y(3) = X(3) + Term = -j + (-√2) = -√2 - j`\n    *   `Y(7) = X(3) - Term = -j - (-√2) = √2 - j`\n\n**6. Final Answer**\n\nCombine the calculated values for `Y(k)` from `k=0` to `k=7`.\n\n`Y(k) = [Y(0), Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), Y(4), Y(5), Y(6), Y(7)]`\n\n`Y(k) = [1,  √2 + j,  -1 - j,  -√2 - j,  1,  -√2 + j,  -1 + j,  √2 - j]`\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
