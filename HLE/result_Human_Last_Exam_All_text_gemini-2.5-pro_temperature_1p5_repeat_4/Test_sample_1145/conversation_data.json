    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of finding a particle in a specific small interval within a one-dimensional infinite potential well (a \"1D box\"). The key physical principles are from quantum mechanics.\n\n*   **System:** A particle in a 1D box of length `a`.\n*   **State:** The particle is in the `n=2` energy eigenstate.\n*   **Goal:** Calculate the probability of finding the particle in the interval `x` from `0.495a` to `0.505a`.\n\n**2. Recall the Relevant Equations**\n\n*   The normalized wave function for the n-th state of a particle in a 1D box is:\n    $ψ_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   The probability density, which is the probability per unit length of finding the particle at a position `x`, is given by the square of the magnitude of the wave function:\n    $P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2$\n*   The probability of finding the particle between two points, $x_1$ and $x_2$, is the integral of the probability density over that interval:\n    $Prob(x_1 < x < x_2) = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} |ψ_n(x)|^2 \\,dx$\n\n**3. Substitute the Specific Parameters**\n\n*   Quantum number, `n = 2`.\n*   Interval, $x_1 = 0.495a$ and $x_2 = 0.505a$.\n\nFirst, let's write the specific wave function and probability density for `n=2`:\n*   Wave function: $ψ_2(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n*   Probability density: $|ψ_2(x)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n\nNow, set up the integral for the probability:\n$Prob = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\,dx$\n\n**4. Careful Point: Analyzing the Interval and Integrand**\n\n*   The interval is very small: $\\Delta x = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a$.\n*   The interval is centered at $x = 0.5a$.\n*   Let's evaluate the probability density at the center of the interval, $x = 0.5a$:\n    $|ψ_2(0.5a)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\pi) = \\frac{2}{a} (0)^2 = 0$.\n*   For the `n=2` state, there is a node (zero probability) at the center of the box. Since our interval is centered on this node, we expect the probability to be very small, but not exactly zero because the interval has a finite width.\n\n**5. Solving the Integral using Approximation**\n\nBecause the interval $\\Delta x = 0.01a$ is very small, we can approximate the probability density function, $f(x) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$, using a Taylor series expansion around the midpoint, $x_{mid} = 0.5a$.\n\n*   **Step 5a: Taylor Expansion**\n    The Taylor expansion of a function $f(x)$ around $x_{mid}$ is:\n    $f(x) \\approx f(x_{mid}) + f'(x_{mid})(x-x_{mid}) + \\frac{f''(x_{mid})}{2!}(x-x_{mid})^2 + \\dots$\n    We already found $f(0.5a) = 0$.\n    Now find the first derivative, $f'(x)$:\n    $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{2}{a} \\cdot 2\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{a} = \\frac{8\\pi}{a^2} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n    $f'(0.5a) = \\frac{8\\pi}{a^2} \\sin(\\pi)\\cos(\\pi) = 0$.\n    Now find the second derivative, $f''(x)$:\n    $f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\frac{4\\pi}{a^2}\\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{4\\pi}{a^2} \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{4\\pi}{a} = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{a^3} \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n    $f''(0.5a) = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{a^3} \\cos(2\\pi) = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{a^3}$.\n    So, the approximation for the probability density is:\n    $|ψ_2(x)|^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{16\\pi^2}{a^3}\\right) (x - 0.5a)^2 = \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} (x - 0.5a)^2$.\n\n*   **Step 5b: Integrate the Approximated Function**\n    $Prob \\approx \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} (x - 0.5a)^2 \\,dx$\n    Let $u = x - 0.5a$, so $du = dx$. The new limits of integration are from $u_1 = 0.495a - 0.5a = -0.005a$ to $u_2 = 0.505a - 0.5a = 0.005a$.\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} u^2 \\,du$\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\left[ \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_{-0.005a}^{0.005a}$\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ (0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ 2 \\cdot (0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^3} (0.005)^3 a^3$\n\n*   **Step 5c: Final Calculation**\n    The $a^3$ terms cancel out.\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (0.005)^3$\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n    Using $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$:\n    $Prob \\approx \\frac{16 \\times 9.8696}{3} \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n    $Prob \\approx 52.638 \\times (1.25 \\times 10^{-7})$\n    $Prob \\approx 6.5797 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nThis value is the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe probability is approximately $6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
