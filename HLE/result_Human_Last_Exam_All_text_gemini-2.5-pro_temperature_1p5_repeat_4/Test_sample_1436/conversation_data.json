    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Diagram's Structure\n\n*   **Theory Context:** The problem is set in perturbative Green's function analysis, which is the language of Quantum Field Theory (QFT). We consider a generic interaction, which is typically a polynomial in a field, like $\\frac{\\lambda}{n!}\\phi^n$. For a vertex to have 4 field lines coming out of it, the most common choice is a $\\phi^4$ interaction from a Lagrangian term like $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$.\n*   **Vertices and Contractions:** The problem specifies:\n    1.  **Two vertices:** This means the diagram is of second order in the coupling constant ($\\lambda^2$). Let's label the vertices A and B.\n    2.  **Four field contractions:** A contraction is represented by a line (propagator) in the Feynman diagram. These lines connect the fields involved in the interactions.\n*   **Determining the Topology:** Each vertex from a $\\phi^4$ interaction has four \"legs\" or field lines associated with it. With two vertices, we have a total of 8 legs (4 at vertex A, 4 at vertex B). The four contractions (propagators) must connect these 8 legs. Since no external lines (representing particles in the initial or final state) are mentioned, we assume we are analyzing a vacuum diagram where all legs are contracted internally. To connect 8 legs with 4 propagators, each propagator must connect a leg from vertex A to a leg from vertex B. Therefore, the diagram consists of **two vertices connected to each other by four distinct lines**. This is sometimes called a \"figure-of-eight\" or \"double-scoop\" diagram.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Symmetry Factor\n\nThe symmetry factor, denoted by $S$, is a combinatorial number that corrects for the overcounting of topologically identical diagrams in the perturbative expansion. It is equal to the order of the automorphism group of the graph, which means it's the number of permutations of its lines and vertices that leave the diagram unchanged.\n\nWe can calculate this by considering the different types of symmetries in the diagram:\n\n1.  **Symmetry from permuting identical lines:** The four lines connecting vertex A and vertex B are identical propagators. We can swap any of these four lines with any other, and the diagram remains topologically the same. The number of ways to permute these four lines is $4!$.\n    *   Factor from line permutations = $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n\n2.  **Symmetry from permuting identical vertices:** The two vertices are of the same type (both are $\\phi^4$ interaction vertices). If we swap the position of vertex A with vertex B, the diagram remains unchanged because it's still just two vertices connected by four lines. The number of ways to permute these two vertices is $2!$.\n    *   Factor from vertex permutations = $2! = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\nThe total symmetry factor is the product of these individual symmetry factors.\n\n$S = (\\text{Factor from line permutations}) \\times (\\text{Factor from vertex permutations})$\n$S = 4! \\times 2!$\n$S = 24 \\times 2 = 48$\n\n### Step 3: Verification with Wick's Theorem (Alternative Method)\n\nWe can verify this result by explicitly calculating the numerical prefactor of the diagram from the perturbative series.\nThe second-order term in the expansion of $e^{iS_{int}}$ with $S_{int} = \\int d^4x \\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4(x)$ is:\n$\\frac{1}{2!} \\left( -i\\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\right)^2 \\int d^4x \\int d^4y \\langle T[\\phi(x)^4 \\phi(y)^4] \\rangle_c$\n\nWe need to count the number of Wick contractions ($N_c$) that produce the \"figure-of-eight\" topology.\n*   Pick one of the 4 fields at vertex $x$.\n*   Contract it with one of the 4 fields at vertex $y$. There are 4 choices.\n*   Pick one of the remaining 3 fields at $x$. Contract it with one of the 3 fields at $y$. There are 3 choices.\n*   Continue this process. The total number of ways to form the four propagators between $x$ and $y$ is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4! = 24$.\n\nThe numerical coefficient for this diagram is the product of all numerical factors:\nCoefficient = $\\frac{1}{2!} \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{4!} \\right)^2 \\times N_c = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{(24)^2} \\times 24 = \\frac{24}{2 \\times 576} = \\frac{1}{48}$.\n\nIn the standard Feynman rules, the contribution of a diagram is written as $\\frac{1}{S} \\times (\\text{Vertex factors}) \\times (\\text{Propagators})$. The vertex factor is $(-i\\lambda)$. So the diagram's value is $\\frac{1}{S}(-i\\lambda)^2 I_{diagram}$. The numerical part is $\\frac{1}{S}$.\nComparing this with our calculated coefficient, we get $\\frac{1}{S} = \\frac{1}{48}$, which confirms that $S=48$.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correctly Identify the Topology:** The description of \"two vertices and four field contractions\" must be correctly translated into a specific graph structure. The absence of external lines is a key assumption that leads to the figure-of-eight vacuum diagram.\n2.  **Distinguish between Symmetries:** One must account for all sources of symmetry. In this case, there are two distinct types: permutations of identical lines and permutations of identical vertices. Missing one would lead to an incorrect answer (e.g., just 24 or 2).\n3.  **Independence of Symmetries:** The vertex permutation and line permutations are independent operations, so their counts multiply. Swapping the vertices does not constrain how the lines can be permuted among themselves.\n4.  **Consistency in Definition:** Be consistent with the definition of the symmetry factor. The factor $S$ appears in the denominator ($1/S$). Different textbooks might absorb factors like $1/n!$ from the Lagrangian into the vertex rules differently, but the automorphism count is a robust definition of $S$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the symmetry factor is calculated by multiplying the number of permutations of the four identical lines connecting the vertices ($4!$) by the number of permutations of the two identical vertices ($2!$).\n\n$S = 4! \\times 2! = 24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n\n<<<48>>>"
