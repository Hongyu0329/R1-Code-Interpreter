    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Great Icosahedron:**\n    *   The great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra.\n    *   It is a star polyhedron, meaning its faces intersect each other. It is composed of 20 intersecting equilateral triangular faces.\n    *   Critically, it has 12 vertices, which are arranged in the same positions as the vertices of a regular (convex) icosahedron.\n\n2.  **Understand the \"Outer-Hull\":**\n    *   The \"outer-hull\" is another term for the convex hull.\n    *   The convex hull of a set of points (or a polyhedron) is the smallest convex shape that contains all the points. Imagine shrink-wrapping the object; the shape you get is the convex hull.\n    *   Since the vertices of the great icosahedron are located at the same positions as the vertices of a regular icosahedron, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\n3.  **Understand \"Triangulating the Outer-Hull\":**\n    *   This phrase asks for the number of triangular faces that make up the surface of the outer-hull.\n    *   We have established that the outer-hull is a regular icosahedron.\n    *   The faces of a regular icosahedron are, by definition, equilateral triangles.\n    *   Therefore, the task is to count the number of faces on a regular icosahedron. The surface is already perfectly triangulated by its own faces.\n\n4.  **Count the Faces of a Regular Icosahedron:**\n    *   A regular icosahedron is one of the five Platonic solids.\n    *   The name \"icosahedron\" is derived from the Ancient Greek words \"eíkosi\" (εἴκοσι), meaning 'twenty', and \"hédra\" (ἕδρα), meaning 'seat' or 'face'.\n    *   Thus, a regular icosahedron has exactly 20 faces.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Don't confuse the Great Icosahedron with the Regular Icosahedron:** The question is about the *outer-hull* of the great icosahedron, not the great icosahedron itself. The great icosahedron has 20 self-intersecting faces, but the question is about its visible, external, convex shape.\n*   **The vertices are key:** The fact that the vertex arrangement is identical for both the great and regular icosahedra is the crucial link. This directly determines that the convex hull of one is the other.\n*   **\"Minimal number of triangles\":** The faces of the convex hull (the regular icosahedron) are already triangles. Therefore, no further subdivision is needed, and the number of faces is the minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe problem is solved by identifying the convex hull of the great icosahedron and then counting its faces.\n\n1.  The outer-hull (convex hull) of the great icosahedron is a **regular icosahedron**.\n2.  A regular icosahedron has **20** triangular faces.\n3.  Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate this outer-hull is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
