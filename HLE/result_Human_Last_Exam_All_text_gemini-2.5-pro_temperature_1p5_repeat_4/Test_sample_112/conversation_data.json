    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the specific \"Sir Launfal\" in question.**\nThe question refers to a work preserved in a manuscript alongside another text. This points towards the Middle English romance poem *Sir Launfal*, written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century, rather than earlier French versions or later adaptations.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the manuscript where this poem is preserved.**\nThe poem *Sir Launfal* by Thomas Chestre survives in only one known manuscript. This manuscript is cataloged as **British Library MS Cotton Caligula A.ii**. This is a well-known miscellany, a collection of various texts bound together in a single volume.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the contents of MS Cotton Caligula A.ii.**\nTo find the book of manners preserved \"alongside\" *Sir Launfal*, we must examine the other texts included in this same manuscript. MS Cotton Caligula A.ii contains several important Middle English works, including *The Owl and the Nightingale* and *Layamon's Brut*.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the specific \"book of manners\" within the manuscript.**\nAmong the various texts in this manuscript is a poem on etiquette and social conduct. This genre of writing is known as a courtesy book or a \"book of manners.\" The specific text found in this manuscript is a short instructional poem on proper behavior, especially for a young person serving in a noble household.\n\n**Step 5: Name the book of manners.**\nThe title of this work, as it appears in the manuscript and is known by scholars, is ***A Book of Curtesye*** (or *A Boke of Curtasye* in Middle English spelling). It is sometimes also referred to as *Lytel Caton* (Little Cato).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Specificity of the source:** It is crucial to identify the correct manuscript, as different texts were often compiled together in medieval codices. *Sir Launfal* exists only in MS Cotton Caligula A.ii.\n*   **Genre identification:** Understanding that a \"book of manners\" is a historical genre, also known as a \"courtesy book,\" is key to identifying the correct text within the manuscript's contents.\n*   **Title variation:** Be aware that medieval texts can have variant titles or spellings. *A Book of Curtesye* is the most common scholarly name for this particular work.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the book of manners that was preserved in the same manuscript as Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal*.\n\n<<<A Book of Curtesye>>>"
