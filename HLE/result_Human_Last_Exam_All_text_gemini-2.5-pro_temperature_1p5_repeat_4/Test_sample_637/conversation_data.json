    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the observer gain matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to design an observer for a discrete-time system. The key requirement is that the observation error, `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)`, must become identically zero in the shortest possible time. This is known as designing a \"deadbeat observer\".\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Observer Error Dynamics\nThe state-space representation of the system is:\n`x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\n\nThe Luenberger observer is given by:\n`x_hat(k + 1) = A*x_hat(k) + B*u(k) + L*(y(k) - C*x_hat(k))`\nwhere `L` is the observer gain matrix to be designed.\n\nThe dynamics of the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` are derived as follows:\n`e(k + 1) = x(k + 1) - x_hat(k + 1)`\n`e(k + 1) = (Ax(k) + Bu(k)) - (A*x_hat(k) + B*u(k) + L*C*x(k) - L*C*x_hat(k))`\n`e(k + 1) = A(x(k) - x_hat(k)) - LC(x(k) - x_hat(k))`\n`e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n\nFor the error to become identically zero after a finite number of steps, say `v`, we need `e(k) = 0` for all `k >= v`. This is true for any initial error `e(0)` if and only if the matrix `(A - LC)` is nilpotent, i.e., `(A - LC)^v = 0` for some integer `v`. Such a system has all its eigenvalues at the origin (zero).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Shortest Possible Time (Observability Index)\nThe shortest possible time `v` for the error to converge to zero is equal to the observability index, `v_o`, of the system `(A, C)`. The observability index is the smallest integer such that the observability matrix `O_{v_o} = [C^T, (CA)^T, ..., (CA^{v_o-1})^T]^T` has full rank, which is `n=4` for this system.\n\nLet's compute the matrices `C`, `CA`, `CA^2`, ... and check the rank.\n`A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`\n`C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n\n`rank(C) = 2`, since its two rows are linearly independent.\n\n`CA = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * A = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\nThe observability matrix after 2 steps is `O_2 = [C; CA] = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`.\nThe rank of `O_2` is 3. Since `rank(O_2) < 4`, the observability index is greater than 2.\n\nLet's compute `CA^2`:\n`A^2 = A * A = [2 0 1 -2; -3 0 2 -1; 2 -1 1 3; 2 1 -1 1]`\n`CA^2 = C * A^2 = [2 0 1 -2; 4 1 0 -1]`\nThe observability matrix after 3 steps is `O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2]`.\nThe rows of `C` and `CA` span a 3-dimensional space. We check if the new rows from `CA^2` add a new dimension. The vector `[4, 1, 0, -1]` has a non-zero second component, which is not present in the basis vectors derived from the rows of `O_2`. Therefore, this vector is linearly independent of the previous rows.\nThis means `rank(O_3) = 4`.\nThe system is observable, and the observability index is `v_o = 3`.\nThe shortest possible number of steps for the error to be zero is 3.\n\n### Step 4: Design the Gain Matrix L\nWe need to find `L` such that the resulting error matrix `M = A - LC` satisfies `M^3 = 0`. A simple way to achieve this is to make `M` a matrix that is known to be nilpotent with index 3. For example, a block matrix of Jordan blocks. This implies that all eigenvalues of `M` must be zero, so its characteristic polynomial must be `Î»^4 = 0`.\n\nLet's find the structure of `A - LC`.\n`LC = L * C = [l11 l12; l21 l22; l31 l32; l41 l42] * [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n`LC = [l11+l12, 0, 0, l12; l21+l22, 0, 0, l22; l31+l32, 0, 0, l32; l41+l42, 0, 0, l42]`\n\nNow, `M = A - LC`:\n`M =`\n`[-1-(l11+l12)   0   0   1-l12]`\n`[1-(l21+l22)    0   0   2-l22]`\n`[-(l31+l32)     1   0   -1-l32]`\n`[-1-(l41+l42)   0   1   -1-l42]`\n\nWe want to choose the elements of `L` to make `M` a simple nilpotent matrix with index 3.\nLet's choose the target matrix `M_target = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0]]`.\nThis matrix `M_target` is nilpotent with index 3, since `(M_target)^2 = [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0]] != 0` and `(M_target)^3 = 0`.\n\nWe can find `L` by setting `A - LC = M_target`.\nComparing the elements of `A-LC` with `M_target`:\n\n- **Column 2:** `[0;0;1;0]` in `A-LC` matches `[0;0;1;0]` in `M_target`.\n- **Column 3:** `[0;0;0;1]` in `A-LC` matches `[0;0;0;1]` in `M_target`.\n- **Column 4:** Must be zero.\n  `1 - l12 = 0  => l12 = 1`\n  `2 - l22 = 0  => l22 = 2`\n  `-1 - l32 = 0 => l32 = -1`\n  `-1 - l42 = 0 => l42 = -1`\n- **Column 1:** Must be zero.\n  `-1 - (l11 + l12) = 0 => l11 = -1 - l12 = -1 - 1 = -2`\n  `1 - (l21 + l22) = 0  => l21 = 1 - l22 = 1 - 2 = -1`\n  `-(l31 + l32) = 0    => l31 = -l32 = -(-1) = 1`\n  `-1 - (l41 + l42) = 0 => l41 = -1 - l42 = -1 - (-1) = 0`\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\nBy assembling the calculated components, the observer gain matrix `L` is:\n`L = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]`"
