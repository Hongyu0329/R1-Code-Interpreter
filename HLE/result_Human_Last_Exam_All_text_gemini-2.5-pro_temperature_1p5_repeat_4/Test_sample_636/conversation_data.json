    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe are given a linear system defined by matrices A and B. Our goal is to find a state feedback gain matrix F such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix, `A_cl = A + BF`, are located at specified positions in the complex plane, specifically at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Define Unknowns**\n*   System matrix A:\n    `A = [-1, 1; 1, 0]`\n*   Input matrix B:\n    `B = [1, 2; 1, 0]`\n*   Desired eigenvalues: `p1 = -1 + j`, `p2 = -1 - j`\n*   The state feedback gain matrix F is unknown. Since the system has 2 states and 2 inputs, F will be a 2x2 matrix. Let's define it as:\n    `F = [f1, f2; f3, f4]`\n\n**3. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe characteristic polynomial of a system is what determines its eigenvalues. A system with eigenvalues `p1` and `p2` has a characteristic polynomial given by `(s - p1)(s - p2) = 0`.\n*   `(s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j)) = 0`\n*   `((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j) = 0`\n*   Using the difference of squares formula `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2`:\n    `(s + 1)^2 - j^2 = 0`\n*   Since `j^2 = -1`:\n    `(s^2 + 2s + 1) - (-1) = 0`\n*   **Desired Characteristic Polynomial:** `s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`\n\n**4. Form the Closed-Loop System Matrix `A_cl = A + BF`**\nFirst, we calculate the product `BF`:\n*   `BF = [1, 2; 1, 0] * [f1, f2; f3, f4]`\n*   `BF = [(1*f1 + 2*f3), (1*f2 + 2*f4); (1*f1 + 0*f3), (1*f2 + 0*f4)]`\n*   `BF = [f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4; f1, f2]`\n\nNow, we add this to matrix A to get `A_cl`:\n*   `A_cl = A + BF = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4; f1, f2]`\n*   `A_cl = [-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4; 1 + f1, f2]`\n\n**5. Determine the Actual Characteristic Polynomial of `A_cl`**\nThe characteristic polynomial for a 2x2 matrix `M = [a, b; c, d]` is given by `s^2 - tr(M)s + det(M) = 0`, where `tr(M)` is the trace (`a+d`) and `det(M)` is the determinant (`ad-bc`).\n*   **Trace of `A_cl`:**\n    `tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + (f2) = f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1`\n*   **Determinant of `A_cl`:**\n    `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n*   **Actual Characteristic Polynomial:**\n    `s^2 - (f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1)s + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4) = 0`\n\n**6. Equate Coefficients and Solve for F**\nWe now match the coefficients of our actual polynomial with the desired polynomial `s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\n*   **Matching the `s` coefficient:**\n    `-(f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1) = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1 = -2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1`  (Equation 1)\n*   **Matching the constant term:**\n    `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 3` (Equation 2)\n\n**Careful Point:** We have two equations but four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This is typical for multi-input systems and means there is no unique solution for F. We have extra degrees of freedom and can make simplifying choices to find *a* valid solution.\n\nA common approach is to set some elements of F to zero. Let's choose to simplify the system by setting `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. This is equivalent to only using the first input `u1` for feedback control.\n*   With `f3 = 0`, Equation 1 becomes: `f1 + f2 = -1`\n*   With `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`, Equation 2 becomes: `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n*   `(f1 + f2) + (-f1 - 2*f2) = -1 + 3`\n*   `-f2 = 2`\n*   `f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` back into the first equation:\n*   `f1 + (-2) = -1`\n*   `f1 = 1`\n\nSo, we have `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`.\n\n**7. Final Answer**\nThe resulting state feedback gain matrix is:\n`F = [1, -2; 0, 0]`\n\n**Verification (Optional but recommended):**\nLet's check our answer.\n*   `F = [1, -2; 0, 0]`\n*   `A_cl = A + BF = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [1, 2; 1, 0] * [1, -2; 0, 0]`\n*   `A_cl = [-1, 1; 1, 0] + [1, -2; 1, -2]`\n*   `A_cl = [0, -1; 2, -2]`\n*   The characteristic equation is `det(sI - A_cl) = det([s, 1; -2, s+2]) = s(s+2) - (1)(-2) = s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0`.\nThis matches our desired characteristic polynomial, confirming the eigenvalues are indeed `-1 Â± j`.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
