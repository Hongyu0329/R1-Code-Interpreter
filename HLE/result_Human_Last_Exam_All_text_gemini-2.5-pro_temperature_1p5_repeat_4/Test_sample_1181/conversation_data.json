    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*. The identifying detail is that this character expresses shame about missing a particular sound from Earth: the rustling of leaves.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Characters and Their Personalities**\nTo answer this, we need to consider the personalities and primary concerns of the main characters on the Solaris station.\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist psychologist. His connection to and longing for Earth is a central theme of the film, established in the long opening sequence at his father's dacha. However, his struggle is more focused on his guilt over his wife Hari and the nature of her return. While he clearly misses Earth, we must check if he is the one who speaks this specific line.\n*   **B. Hari:** She is not a human from Earth but a \"visitor\" or \"guest\" created by the Solaris ocean from Kris's memories. She has no first-hand experience of Earth to miss, other than the memories she has inherited from Kris. Therefore, it is highly unlikely she would be the one to express this sentiment.\n*   **C. Dr. Snaut:** A cyberneticist and one of the two surviving scientists Kris meets on the station. He is world-weary, cynical, but also deeply philosophical and introspective. He often acts as a guide for Kris, explaining the strange reality of their situation.\n*   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** A biologist, the other surviving scientist. He is cold, ruthlessly logical, and obsessed with the scientific study of Solaris. He views emotions and nostalgia as weaknesses and hindrances to his work. It is contrary to his character to admit to such a poetic and sentimental feeling.\n*   **E. Gibarian:** Kris's friend who was on the station but committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. We only see him in a video message he left for Kris. His message is filled with despair and warnings about the station's phenomena, but not this specific nostalgic reflection.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Scene and Dialogue**\nThe line in question is spoken during a key philosophical scene in the station's library. The crew (Kris, Snaut, Sartorius) and Hari are gathered for what Snaut jokingly calls his \"birthday.\" During a long, poignant, and somewhat drunken monologue, Snaut reflects on humanity, their purpose in space, and what they have lost. He confesses his own feelings of being disconnected from his humanity.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Speaker**\nIn this scene, it is Dr. Snaut who makes the confession. He tells Kris that he is tormented by the thought that they are losing their human form. He then says (with slight variations depending on the English translation/subtitle):\n\"I am ashamed to confess that I terribly miss... a very simple earthly feeling... Do you miss the sound of leaves? Yes! The sound of leaves rustling. I am ashamed of such a confession, Kris.\"\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Specificity of the Film:** The question specifies the 1972 Tarkovsky film. The characterizations and dialogue can differ from the original Stanislaw Lem novel or the 2002 American remake. The answer must come from Tarkovsky's version.\n*   **Speaker vs. Theme:** While Kris Kelvin is the character most thematically tied to a longing for Earth's nature, the character who *verbally expresses* shame about missing the rustling leaves is Snaut.\n*   **The Element of Shame:** The shame is crucial. Snaut, as a scientist on the frontier of human exploration, feels that such a simple, earthy longing is a weakness or a sentimental distraction from his grander, intellectual purpose, which is why he is \"ashamed\" to admit it.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on a direct analysis of the dialogue in the film, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
