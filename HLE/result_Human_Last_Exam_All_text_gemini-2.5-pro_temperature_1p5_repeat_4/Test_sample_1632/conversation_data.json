    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on a Manhattan (2D square) lattice, denoted by a(10).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Definition of a Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW)**\n*   **Lattice:** A 2D square grid.\n*   **Walk:** A sequence of steps starting from an origin point (0,0). Each step is one unit North, South, East, or West.\n*   **n-step walk:** The walk consists of exactly `n` steps and passes through `n+1` vertices.\n*   **Self-avoiding:** The path never visits the same vertex more than once. All `n+1` vertices in the walk must be distinct.\n\nThe function `a(n)` counts the total number of distinct n-step SAWs. Two walks are distinct if their sequence of moves is different. For example, the walk (Right, Up) is distinct from (Up, Right).\n\n**2. Careful Points to Consider**\n*   **No immediate reversal:** A step cannot be the reverse of the immediately preceding step (e.g., Right then Left), as this would revisit the previous vertex.\n*   **No other intersections:** The walk cannot intersect with *any* other previous vertex on its path, not just the immediately preceding one.\n*   **Symmetry:** The lattice is symmetrical. We can count the walks starting with one specific direction (e.g., Right) and then multiply the result by 4, as long as we correctly handle paths that might be rotations of each other (which is not an issue here as we count all distinct sequences).\n*   **Computational Complexity:** There is no simple combinatorial formula for `a(n)`. The number of walks grows exponentially, and for larger `n`, the calculation requires computational enumeration.\n\n### Calculating the first few terms `a(n)`\n\n*   **a(1):**\n    From the origin (0,0), we can take one step in any of 4 directions (Right, Left, Up, Down). All are valid 1-step SAWs.\n    *   `a(1) = 4`\n\n*   **a(2):**\n    We start with any of the 4 one-step walks. From the endpoint of a 1-step walk, we can take a second step. The only forbidden move is the one that returns to the origin.\n    *   For each of the 4 initial steps, there are 3 possible choices for the second step.\n    *   `a(2) = 4 * 3 = 12`\n\n*   **a(3):**\n    We extend the 12 two-step walks. For a 3-step walk, the path is (v0, v1, v2, v3). It's impossible for v3 to be the same as v0. The path would have to be, for example, Right-Up-Left, ending at (0,1). The endpoint v3 is not v0. Therefore, the only constraint is not to reverse the last step.\n    *   From each of the 12 two-step walks, there are 3 non-reversing moves for the third step.\n    *   `a(3) = 12 * 3 = 36`\n\n*   **a(4):**\n    Here, self-intersection becomes a possibility. We extend the 36 three-step walks. A walk of length 3 is (v0, v1, v2, v3). We add a fourth step to a new vertex, v4. We must ensure v4 is not v0, v1, or v2.\n    *   The move to v4 cannot be back to v2 (this is the standard non-reversing rule).\n    *   Could v4 be v1? Due to the parity of the lattice, this is impossible. A 4-step walk must end on a vertex (x,y) where x+y is even. The vertex v1 is reached in 1 step, so its coordinates (x1,y1) have an odd sum x1+y1. A vertex cannot have both an even and an odd coordinate sum.\n    *   Could v4 be v0? Yes. This occurs if the 3-step walk's endpoint is adjacent to the origin. Consider a path like Right-Up-Left (R-U-L). The vertices are (0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(0,1). From the endpoint (0,1), a valid move is Down, which would lead to (0,0), our starting point. This move is forbidden for a SAW.\n    *   We must count how many 3-step walks have an endpoint adjacent to the origin. These are the \"U-turn\" shapes like R-U-L.\n        *   Number of such paths: (4 choices for 1st step) * (2 choices for 2nd step, must be a turn) * (1 choice for 3rd step, turns back) = 4 * 2 * 1 = 8 paths.\n    *   These 8 \"restricted\" paths only have **2** valid extensions for the 4th step. (3 non-reversing moves minus 1 that hits the origin). This gives `8 * 2 = 16` walks.\n    *   The remaining `36 - 8 = 28` \"unrestricted\" paths have **3** valid extensions. This gives `28 * 3 = 84` walks.\n    *   `a(4) = 16 + 84 = 100`\n\n*   **a(5):**\n    This logic extends. We must count the 4-step walks whose endpoints are adjacent to a prior vertex on the path (other than the immediate predecessor).\n    *   A 5-step walk ends on a vertex v5 with an odd coordinate sum. By parity, it cannot be adjacent to v0, v2, or v4 (even sums). It can only be adjacent to v1 or v3.\n    *   Adjacency to v3 is handled by the non-reversing rule. So we only need to find 4-step walks where the endpoint v4 is adjacent to v1.\n    *   Through careful enumeration (as shown in the thought process), there are exactly **16** such 4-step walks.\n    *   These 16 restricted walks have only **2** valid extensions. (`16 * 2 = 32`).\n    *   The remaining `100 - 16 = 84` walks have **3** valid extensions. (`84 * 3 = 252`).\n    *   `a(5) = 32 + 252 = 284`\n\n**3. Finding a(10)**\nThe case-by-case analysis becomes prohibitively complex for higher `n`. The standard method to find these values is to use a computer program to perform the walk generation and counting recursively. The values of `a(n)` are well-known in mathematical literature. We list them here as the result of applying this exhaustive enumeration process.\n\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\nThe final answer is the result of this established computational method.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
