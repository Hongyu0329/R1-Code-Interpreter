    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe goal is to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ in the form $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$.\n\nThis means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that:\n1.  $D(s)$ is nonsingular, i.e., $\\det(D(s))$ is not identically zero.\n2.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, which is equivalent to $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$.\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$**\n\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. The equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$ becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix} = N(s)\n\\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, all its entries must be polynomials.\n\n**Step 2: Derive conditions on the elements of D(s)**\n\nFrom the structure of $N(s)$:\n*   $N_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ must be a polynomial.\n*   $N_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$ must be a polynomial.\n*   $N_{11}(s) = d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{d_{11}(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}}{(s-1)(s+1)}$ must be a polynomial. This requires the numerator to be divisible by the denominator. The numerator must be zero at the poles $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    *   At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1) = 0$.\n    *   At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n*   $N_{21}(s) = d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{d_{21}(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}}{(s-1)(s+1)}$ must be a polynomial. This leads to similar conditions for the second row of $D(s)$.\n    *   At $s=1$: $d_{21}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(1) = 0$.\n    *   At $s=-1$: $d_{21}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{21}(-1) + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n\n**Careful point:** We need to find the simplest possible polynomials for the entries of $D(s)$ that satisfy these conditions while ensuring $\\det(D(s))$ is not identically zero.\n\n**Step 3: Construct a minimal D(s)**\n\nLet's build $D(s)$ row by row.\n\n*   **For the first row $[d_{11}(s) \\quad d_{12}(s)]$**:\n    Let's choose the simplest possible polynomial for $d_{11}(s)$, which is a constant: $d_{11}(s) = 1$.\n    The conditions on $d_{12}(s)$ become:\n    1.  $d_{12}(1) = 0$\n    2.  $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 2(1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(-1) = -2$.\n    We need a polynomial $d_{12}(s)$ that passes through $(1, 0)$ and $(-1, -2)$. A simple choice is a linear polynomial $d_{12}(s) = as+b$.\n    *   $a(1) + b = 0 \\implies a+b=0$\n    *   $a(-1) + b = -2 \\implies -a+b=-2$\n    Adding the two equations gives $2b = -2 \\implies b=-1$. Substituting back gives $a=1$.\n    So, $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\n    The first row of $D(s)$ is $[1 \\quad s-1]$.\n\n*   **For the second row $[d_{21}(s) \\quad d_{22}(s)]$**:\n    To simplify $D(s)$, let's try to make it triangular. Let's choose $d_{21}(s) = 0$.\n    The conditions on $d_{22}(s)$ become:\n    1.  $d_{22}(1) = 0$\n    2.  $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 2(0) + d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n    So $d_{22}(s)$ must have roots at $s=1$ and $s=-1$. The simplest non-zero polynomial with these roots is $d_{22}(s) = (s-1)(s+1) = s^2-1$.\n    The second row of $D(s)$ is $[0 \\quad s^2-1]$.\n\nThis gives the matrix:\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nWe check if it is nonsingular: $\\det(D(s)) = 1(s^2-1) - 0 = s^2-1$. Since this is not identically zero, $D(s)$ is nonsingular.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate N(s)**\n\nNow we calculate $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{11} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1) \\cdot \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2}{s+1} = \\frac{s+1}{s+1} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{12} = 1 \\cdot 1 + (s-1) \\cdot 0 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{21} = 0 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s^2-1) \\cdot \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{22} = 0 \\cdot 1 + (s^2-1) \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\nSo, the numerator matrix is $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n**Step 5: Verify Left Coprimeness**\n\n**Careful point:** The final and most crucial step is to verify that $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. We do this by checking if the rank of the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is 2 (the number of rows) for all $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nTo check if the rank is always 2, we can find a $2 \\times 2$ minor whose determinant is a non-zero constant. Let's consider the minor formed by columns 1 and 3:\n\\[\n\\det \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} = 1 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 0 = 2\n\\]\nSince this minor is a non-zero constant, its value is 2 for all $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$. This proves that the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is 2 for all $s$. Thus, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\nThe found factorization is a valid left coprime factorization.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe left coprime factorization is $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ with\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}, N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
