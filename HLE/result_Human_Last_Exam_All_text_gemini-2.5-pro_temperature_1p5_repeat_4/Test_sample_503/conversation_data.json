    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ (viewed as a locally posetal 2-category) from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ is equivalent to a Galois connection between the posets $([m], \\leq)$ and $([n], \\leq)$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of an internal adjunction in this context.**\nAn internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ in this 2-category consists of a pair of order-preserving maps (morphisms):\n1.  A left adjoint, $L: [m] \\to [n]$.\n2.  A right adjoint, $R: [n] \\to [m]$.\n\nThese maps must satisfy the adjunction condition, which can be stated in several equivalent ways. For posets, the most common definition is:\nFor all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, we have $L(i) \\leq j \\iff i \\leq R(j)$.\n\nThis is equivalent to two inequalities involving the compositions, which correspond to the unit and counit 2-morphisms:\n1.  $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\leq R \\circ L$, which means $i \\leq R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n2.  $L \\circ R \\leq \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$, which means $L(R(j)) \\leq j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the adjoint maps.**\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint. Therefore, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of possible left adjoint maps (and also equal to the number of possible right adjoint maps).\n\nA map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ between two complete lattices is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). The objects $[k]$ are finite total orders, hence complete lattices. For an order-preserving map between total orders, preservation of all non-empty suprema is automatic. The crucial condition is the preservation of the supremum of the empty set, which is the bottom element.\n*   For $L: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint, it must be order-preserving and map the bottom element of $[m]$ to the bottom element of $[n]$. That is, $L(0) = 0$.\n\nDually, a map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). This requires $R$ to be order-preserving and to map the top element of $[n]$ to the top element of $[m]$. That is, $R(n) = m$.\n\nSo, counting the number of adjunctions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the counting problem.**\nWe need to find the number of adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$. Here, $m=23$ and $n=37$.\nWe count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ with $L(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map $L$ is determined by the sequence of values $(L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23))$.\nThe conditions on this sequence are:\n1.  $L(i) \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ for all $i$.\n2.  $L(0) \\leq L(1) \\leq L(2) \\leq \\dots \\leq L(23)$.\n3.  $L(0) = 0$.\n\nCombining these, we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $L(1), L(2), \\dots, L(23)$ where each element is from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nThe constraint is: $0 \\leq L(1) \\leq L(2) \\leq \\dots \\leq L(23) \\leq 37$.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the counting problem.**\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem of choosing items from a set with repetition, also known as \"stars and bars\".\nWe are choosing $k=23$ values (the values of $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from the set of possible outcomes $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. The size of this set of outcomes is $N = 37 - 0 + 1 = 38$. Since the sequence is non-decreasing, this is a combination with repetition problem.\n\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of size $N$ with repetition is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{N+k-1}{k} $$\nIn our case, $k=23$ and $N=38$. Plugging these values into the formula:\n$$ \\text{Number of adjunctions} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n**Step 5: Verification (optional).**\nWe can also count the right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$. These are order-preserving maps with $R(37)=23$. We need to count the non-decreasing sequences $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ where each element is from $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$.\nHere, we are choosing $k=37$ values from a set of size $N=23+1=24$.\nThe number is $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we see that $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$. The results match.\n\nThe final answer is the numerical value of this binomial coefficient.\n\n<<<(60!)/(23!37!)>>>"
