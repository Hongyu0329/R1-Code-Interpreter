    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the essential controls needed for your flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\n*   **Technique:** Flow Cytometry Sorting. The keyword \"sorting\" implies a high need for accuracy and purity, making certain controls that might be optional for analysis absolutely essential here.\n*   **Reagents:** Streptavidin beads are a key component. This means we need to account for their physical (scatter) and fluorescent properties.\n*   **Complexity:** Five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750). This is a multi-color experiment, so spectral overlap (spillover) is a major concern that must be addressed.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Breakdown of Essential Controls**\n\nWe can categorize the essential controls based on their purpose: (1) Instrument Setup & Compensation, (2) Accurate Gating & Quality, and (3) Reagent-Specific Checks.\n\n**Part 1: Instrument Setup and Compensation Controls (7 controls)**\n\nThese controls are the absolute minimum required to set up the cytometer correctly and to mathematically correct for the spectral overlap between the five different fluorophores.\n\n1.  **Unstained Cells/Sample of Interest:** This is the most fundamental control. It is used to determine the level of background fluorescence (autofluorescence) from your cells and to set the baseline voltage for each detector.\n2.  **Unstained Streptavidin Beads:** You must run a sample of the beads alone to understand their unique properties. This allows you to see their size (FSC), granularity (SSC), and autofluorescence signature across all five channels, ensuring you can distinguish them from cells or exclude their signal if necessary.\n3.  **Single-Stain Compensation Control (AF350):** A sample stained only with the AF350 fluorophore. This is required for the software to calculate how much of the AF350 signal spills over into the other four channels.\n4.  **Single-Stain Compensation Control (GFP):** A sample positive only for GFP.\n5.  **Single-Stain Compensation Control (PE):** A sample stained only with PE.\n6.  **Single-Stain Compensation Control (AF647):** A sample stained only with AF647.\n7.  **Single-Stain Compensation Control (AF750):** A sample stained only with AF750.\n\n**Careful Point:** For compensation controls, the fluorophore must be identical to the one in your experiment, and the signal should be at least as bright as what you expect in your fully stained sample. Using compensation beads is often the best practice.\n\n**Part 2: Gating and Quality Controls (6 controls)**\n\nFor a sorting experiment, correctly identifying your target population and ensuring you are sorting live, healthy cells is paramount.\n\n8.  **Viability Control (Dead Cells):** Dead cells can non-specifically bind antibodies, leading to false positives and contamination of your sorted sample. Therefore, a viability dye is essential. To properly set the gate to exclude dead cells, you need a positive control: a sample of cells that have been intentionally killed (e.g., by heat) and then stained with the viability dye.\n9.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Control for AF350:** This sample is stained with all fluorophores *except* for AF350 (i.e., stained with GFP, PE, AF647, AF750). This control reveals the spread of fluorescence from the other four colors into the AF350 channel, allowing you to set a precise gate for your AF350-positive population.\n10. **FMO Control for GFP:** Stained with all fluorophores except for GFP.\n11. **FMO Control for PE:** Stained with all fluorophores except for PE.\n12. **FMO Control for AF647:** Stained with all fluorophores except for AF647.\n13. **FMO Control for AF750:** Stained with all fluorophores except for AF750.\n\n**Careful Point:** While sometimes omitted in simple analyses, FMO controls are considered **essential** for multi-color sorting to ensure the purity of the final product. Without them, gating is based on guesswork, which can easily ruin a sorting experiment.\n\n### **Final Tally**\n\nBy summing the controls from each category, we get the total number of essential preparatory tubes:\n\n*   Setup & Compensation Controls: 2 (Unstained) + 5 (Single-Stains) = 7\n*   Gating & Quality Controls: 1 (Dead Cells) + 5 (FMOs) = 6\n*   **Total Essential Controls = 7 + 6 = 13**\n\n<<<13>>>"
