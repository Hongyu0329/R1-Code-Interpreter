    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain, after Mount Olympus, mentioned in the *Iliad*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify all mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*.**\nThe first step is to comb through the text of the *Iliad* to find all references to specific, named mountains. The most prominent mountains mentioned are:\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods, mentioned frequently throughout the epic.\n*   **Mount Ida:** A crucial location in the epic, from whose peak Zeus observes the Trojan War. This refers to the Mount Ida near Troy in modern-day Turkey.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** In Book 13, Poseidon sits atop the highest peak of \"wooded Samothrace\" to watch the battle.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, Hera, on her journey to Lemnos, travels \"over the snowy mountains of the Thracian horsemen,\" and steps from Mount Athos onto the sea.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Mentioned in Book 16 and elsewhere as the source of the ash wood for Achilles' famous spear, which was given to his father, Peleus.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** In the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2), the Maeonian contingent is described as being born \"under snow-headed Tmolos.\"\n\n**Step 2: Filter the list according to the question's criteria.**\nThe question asks for the tallest *historical* mountain *after Mount Olympus*.\n\n*   **Exclude Mount Olympus:** As per the question.\n*   **Verify candidates are historical:** All the mountains listed above (Ida, Samothrace, Athos, Pelion, Tmolus) are real, physical mountains that can be identified on a map today.\n\nThis leaves us with the following candidates: Mount Ida, Mount Samothrace, Mount Athos, Mount Pelion, and Mount Tmolus.\n\n**Step 3: Find the modern name and elevation of each candidate mountain.**\nTo compare them, we must find the modern geographical names for these ancient mountains and their current accepted elevations.\n\n*   **Mount Ida (Turkey):** Today known as Kaz Dağı. Its highest peak is **1,774 meters (5,820 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Greece):** The island of Samothrace's main peak is Mount Fengari (or Saos). Its elevation is **1,611 meters (5,285 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Athos (Greece):** This mountain retains its ancient name. Its elevation is **2,033 meters (6,670 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Pelion (Greece):** This mountain also retains its ancient name. Its highest peak is Pourianos Stavros, with an elevation of **1,624 meters (5,328 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Tmolus (Turkey):** This ancient mountain is part of the modern Bozdağlar mountain range, and its highest peak is also called Bozdağ. Its elevation is **2,159 meters (7,083 ft)**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the elevations to find the tallest.**\nNow we rank the mountains from Step 3 by height:\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağ):** 2,159 m\n2.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n3.  **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 m\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n5.  **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 m\n\nThe tallest mountain on this list is Mount Tmolus.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Verifying the \"Mention\":** It is crucial to ensure each mountain is actually named in the text of the *Iliad* and is not just a location from broader Greek mythology. All the mountains listed were confirmed to be explicitly mentioned.\n*   **Distinguishing between different mountains with the same name:** There is another famous Mount Ida on Crete associated with Zeus's birth. However, the *Iliad* focuses its narrative on the Mount Ida near Troy, and it is the only Mount Ida explicitly involved in the story's action.\n*   **Accuracy of Elevations:** Using accepted modern elevations for the corresponding geographical features is essential for an accurate comparison.\n*   **Historical vs. Mythological:** The question specifies *historical* mountains, which all these candidates are. This differentiates them from purely mythological locations that cannot be placed on a map.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nAfter excluding Mount Olympus (2,918 m), we are left with a list of historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*. By comparing their modern elevations, Mount Tmolus, with a height of 2,159 meters, is clearly the tallest.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
