    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is identifying the specific ballroom dance where \"overturning a reverse turn\" is considered a fundamental technical error. \"Overturning\" means rotating more than the prescribed amount for a figure. A \"reverse turn\" is a standard figure that turns to the left (anti-clockwise). The key phrase is \"without disregarding the technique,\" which implies that in some dances, overturning might be an accepted variation or even a necessity for floorcraft, while in one specific dance, it goes against the core principles of its technique.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reverse Turn in Each Dance Style:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** The dance consists of continuous left (reverse) and right (natural) turns. While the standard technique calls for a full 360-degree rotation over 6 steps (two bars of music), slight under- or over-turning is often used for floorcraft, especially to navigate the corners of the ballroom. It is not considered a gross violation of technique but rather a practical adjustment.\n\n    *   **B. English Waltz (Standard Waltz):** The Reverse Turn is a fundamental figure. It's very common and technically acceptable to overturn the Reverse Turn, often from the standard 3/4 rotation to a 7/8 or even a full rotation. This is a standard technique taught for navigating corners. Therefore, it is *not* impossible to overturn without disregarding technique; in fact, it is *part* of the technique.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** Tango has a unique character that distinguishes it from the other \"swing\" dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep). Its technique is characterized by:\n        *   **Staccato action:** Movements are sharp and distinct, not flowing.\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dancers maintain a constant level.\n        *   **Specific Footwork:** Many figures, including the basic Open Reverse Turn, end with the feet closing together (e.g., LF forward, RF to side, LF closes to RF).\n        *   **Lack of Continuous Rotation:** Turns are sharp and angular, not smooth and continuous. The rotation is initiated from the body but is checked and stopped abruptly.\n        Attempting to \"overturn\" a Tango reverse turn would require adding a continuous, flowing rotation that is antithetical to the dance's character. It would necessitate changing the footwork (e.g., not closing the feet) and abandoning the staccato action. Therefore, overturning a reverse turn in Tango is a fundamental break from its core technique.\n\n    *   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** This dance is defined by its smooth, continuous, and gliding motion. Like the Waltz, the Reverse Turn in Foxtrot is frequently and intentionally overturned for floorcraft and choreography, especially at corners. It is a well-established and accepted part of advanced Foxtrot technique.\n\n    *   **E. Quickstep:** This is a fast and dynamic dance. Due to the high speed and need for maneuverability, overturning turns (both Natural and Reverse) is a common and essential tool for navigation and floorcraft. It is not a violation of technique.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** In Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, overturning the reverse turn is a standard and accepted part of the dance technique used for floorcraft. In Viennese Waltz, slight variations in rotation are acceptable. However, in European Tango, the fundamental staccato nature, the specific footwork, and the non-continuous character of the turns make overturning a direct violation of the dance's established technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
