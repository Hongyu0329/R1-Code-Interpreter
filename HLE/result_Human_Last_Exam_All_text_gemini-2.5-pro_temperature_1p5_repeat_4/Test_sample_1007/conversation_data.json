    "Step-by-step analysis:\nThe question asks to identify the classical ballet step from the given options where the final leg position is identical to the initial leg position. This means that if a dancer starts in the fifth position with the right foot in front, they must end in the fifth position with the right foot in front.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**A. Entrechat six:**\n*   **Definition:** *Entrechat* refers to a jump where the dancer's legs beat against each other in the air. The number indicates the number of movements or crossings.\n*   **Starting Position:** Typically, the fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n*   **Execution:** In an *entrechat six*, the legs cross three times. Starting from the fifth position with the right foot in front, the dancer jumps. The back (left) leg beats in front of the right, then the right leg beats in front of the left, and finally, the left leg beats in front of the right again. This sequence returns the legs to their original fifth position.\n*   **Ending Position:** The rule for even-numbered *entrechats* (*deux*, *quatre*, *six*) is that they land on both feet in the same position they started from. Odd-numbered *entrechats* (*trois*, *cinq*) change feet and land on one foot. Therefore, an *entrechat six* ends in the same position it started.\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé:**\n*   **Definition:** *Échappé* means \"escaped,\" *battu* means \"beaten,\" and *changé* means \"changed.\"\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position.\n*   **Execution:** The dancer jumps from the fifth position to the second position (the \"escape\") and then returns to the fifth position. The *battu* means the legs beat together just before closing. The word *changé* explicitly indicates that the feet change places.\n*   **Ending Position:** The foot that was in front will end in the back, and the back foot will end in the front. The position is different from the start.\n\n**C. Assemblé:**\n*   **Definition:** *Assemblé* means \"assembled\" or \"joined together.\"\n*   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position.\n*   **Execution:** The working foot brushes out to the side, front, or back, and then the dancer jumps off the supporting leg to \"assemble\" both legs in the air before landing. In a standard *assemblé* (like *assemblé dessus*), the working leg (e.g., the back foot) will land in front.\n*   **Ending Position:** The feet have switched places. For example, in an *assemblé dessus*, the back foot moves to the front. The position is different.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière:**\n*   **Definition:** *Glissade* means \"to glide.\" *Derrière* means \"behind.\" It is a traveling step.\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position (e.g., right foot in front).\n*   **Execution:** From a plié, the back foot (left) glides to the side, and the dancer transfers weight onto it. The leading foot (right) then closes in the fifth position *behind* the other foot (as indicated by *derrière*).\n*   **Ending Position:** The foot that started in front is now in the back. The position has changed.\n\n**E. Gargouillade:**\n*   **Definition:** A complex, embellished step, often described as a *pas de chat* with a *rond de jambe* from each leg in the air.\n*   **Starting Position:** Fifth position.\n*   **Execution:** The dancer jumps, drawing up the front leg which performs a small circle outward (*rond de jambe en dehors*). The second leg is then drawn up and performs a small circle inward (*rond de jambe en dedans*). The dancer lands on the first foot, then the second, closing in the fifth position.\n*   **Ending Position:** In the standard execution of a *gargouillade*, the leg that started in front lands in the back. The feet change their position.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the only step among the choices that finishes with the legs in the same position as they started is the *entrechat six*.\n\n<<<A>>>"
