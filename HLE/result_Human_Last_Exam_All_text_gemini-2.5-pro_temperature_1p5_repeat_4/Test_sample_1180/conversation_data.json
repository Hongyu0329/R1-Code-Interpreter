    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the curve and the valuation**\n\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. This is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\nWe are working over a 2-adic field $K$, which we can take to be $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ or an extension. The valuation $v$ is normalized such that $v(2)=1$.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the branch points of the curve**\n\nThe branch points of a hyperelliptic curve $z^2 = f(x)$ are the roots of $f(x)$ plus the point at infinity if the degree of $f(x)$ is odd. Here, $\\deg(f)=5$, which is odd, so one of the branch points is at infinity. Let's denote it by $\\alpha_6 = \\infty$. The other five branch points are the roots of $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1 = 0$. Let's call them $\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_5$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the valuations of the branch points**\n\nWe use the Newton polygon method for the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ with respect to the valuation $v$. The coefficients are $a_5=2, a_3=2, a_0=1$. We plot the points $(i, v(a_i))$ for $i \\in \\{0,3,5\\}$, which are $(5, v(2)=1)$, $(3, v(2)=1)$, and $(0, v(1)=0)$.\n\nThe set of points is $S = \\{(0,0), (3,1), (5,1)\\}$. The lower convex hull of $S$ is the line segment connecting $(0,0)$ and $(5,1)$. The point $(3,1)$ lies above or on this segment (specifically, at $x=3$, the line is at height $y=3/5$, and $1>3/5$, so it's above).\nThe Newton polygon has a single segment with slope $m = (1-0)/(5-0) = 1/5$.\nThe valuations of the roots are given by the negative of the slopes. Thus, all five roots $\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_5$ have valuation $v(\\alpha_i) = -1/5$.\n\nThis implies that the roots lie in a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. Let $K$ be an extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ which contains all the roots and is endowed with the unique extension of the valuation $v$. The ramification index of any such extension must be a multiple of 5.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the stable reduction**\n\nThe structure of the special fiber of the stable model of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the clustering of its branch points, which in turn is determined by the pairwise valuations $v(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j)$.\n\nThe set of branch points is $B = \\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\alpha_5, \\infty\\}$.\nLet's compute the distances:\n1.  For $i, j \\in \\{1, \\dots, 5\\}$ with $i \\neq j$: $v(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j)$.\n    Since $v(\\alpha_i) = v(\\alpha_j) = -1/5$, we have $v(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j) \\ge -1/5$. To check if it's strictly greater, we examine the unit parts of the roots. Let $v(t)=-1/5$ (so $t$ is like $2^{-1/5}$). We write $\\alpha_i = t u_i$, where $v(u_i)=0$. Substituting $x=tu$ into the polynomial equation $2x^5+2x^3+1=0$ and choosing $t$ such that $2=t^{-5}$ (or rather $2=u_t t^{-5}$ for a unit $u_t$), the equation for the unit parts $u_i$ becomes $u^5+2t^2 u^3+t^5=0$. Let's assume we are in an extension with $\\pi^5=2$, so $v(\\pi)=1/5$. Let $\\alpha_i = \\pi^{-1} u_i$.\n    $2(\\pi^{-1}u)^5+2(\\pi^{-1}u)^3+1=0 \\implies \\pi^5\\pi^{-5}u^5+\\pi^5\\pi^{-3}u^3+1=0 \\implies u^5+\\pi^2u^3+1=0$.\n    The reduction of this equation modulo $\\pi$ is $\\bar{u}^5+1=0$ over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n    $\\bar{u}^5+1 = (\\bar{u}+1)(\\bar{u}^4+\\bar{u}^3+\\bar{u}^2+\\bar{u}+1)=0$.\n    The roots are distinct in $\\mathbb{F}_{16}$. By Hensel's lemma, the roots $u_i$ are distinct and $u_i-u_j$ are units for $i \\neq j$. Thus $v(u_i-u_j)=0$.\n    So, $v(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j) = v(\\pi^{-1}(u_i-u_j)) = v(\\pi^{-1}) + v(u_i-u_j) = -1/5 + 0 = -1/5$.\n2.  For distances involving infinity: the standard definition is $v(\\alpha_i - \\infty) = -v(\\alpha_i)$.\n    So, $v(\\alpha_i - \\infty) = -(-1/5) = 1/5$.\n\nThe set of distance values is $\\{-1/5, 1/5\\}$. This leads to a partition of the branch points into two clusters:\n$B_1 = \\{\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3, \\alpha_4, \\alpha_5\\}$. Intra-cluster distances are all $-1/5$.\n$B_2 = \\{\\infty\\}$. Intra-cluster distance is undefined (or $\\infty$).\nThe distance between any point in $B_1$ and the point in $B_2$ is $1/5$.\n\nThe stable reduction's special fiber consists of components corresponding to these clusters. The total arithmetic genus must be $g=2$.\nLet $C_1$ be the component for $B_1$ and $C_2$ for $B_2$. The genus of a component is $g_i = \\lfloor (\\#B_i - 1)/2 \\rfloor$.\n$g_1 = \\lfloor (5-1)/2 \\rfloor = 2$.\n$g_2 = \\lfloor (1-1)/2 \\rfloor = 0$.\nThe arithmetic genus of the union is $p_a = g_1+g_2+N-1$, where $N$ is the number of nodes connecting the components.\n$2 = 2+0+N-1 \\implies N=1$.\nSo the stable reduction's special fiber consists of a genus 2 curve and a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$) intersecting at a single node (double point).\n\n**Step 5: Compute the thickness of the double point**\n\nThe thickness of the node is the length of the edge connecting the vertices corresponding to $C_1$ and $C_2$ in the dual graph (or minimal skeleton). The length of an edge in the skeleton is the difference between the critical values of the valuation that separate and join the clusters.\nThe critical values are the distinct values in the set of distances, i.e., $-1/5$ and $1/5$.\nThe length (thickness) is the difference: $1/5 - (-1/5) = 2/5$.\n\nHowever, the thickness of a double point in the stable model is an integer when defined via intersection theory or resolution of singularities. The length calculated above is a length in the sense of metric graphs. This length needs to be properly normalized. The thickness $d$ of a node can be computed using a formula that relates it to the metric length $l$ of the corresponding edge in the minimal skeleton: $d = e \\cdot l$, where $e$ is the ramification index of the extension over which we are working.\n\nTo properly analyze the clustering, we need to work in a field where the roots are defined. This is a ramified extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}_2$ of ramification index $e=5$. Let $v_K$ be the valuation on $K$ normalized so that $v_K(\\pi)=1$ for a uniformizer $\\pi$ of $K$. Then $v_K(2)=e \\cdot v(2)=5$.\nLet's recompute the valuations with $v_K$:\n$v_K(\\alpha_i) = e \\cdot v(\\alpha_i) = 5 \\cdot (-1/5) = -1$.\n$v_K(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j) = 5 \\cdot (-1/5) = -1$ for $i,j \\le 5$.\n$-v_K(\\alpha_i) = 1$.\nThe critical distance values are now $-1$ and $1$. The length of the edge in the $v_K$-metric is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\nThe question asks for the thickness with respect to the original valuation $v$. The thickness is an absolute quantity related to the geometry of the model over the ring of integers of the base field, but its calculation is often performed over an extension. In this context, the thickness is an integer and corresponds to the length calculated in the appropriate metric that reveals the structure. The length calculated over the ramified extension where the model becomes \"unravelled\" is this integer.\n\nThe thickness of the double point is the integer value obtained from the length computation over the minimal ramified extension needed to separate the clusters of roots. This value is 2.\n\nAnother well-established formula for semistable curves states that the sum of thicknesses of the nodes $\\delta$ is given by $\\delta = v(\\Delta_{min})-(2g-2)$, where $\\Delta_{min}$ is the discriminant of a minimal Weierstrass model. Without carrying out the full, complicated minimization procedure, we rely on the skeleton method which is equivalent.\n\nFinal result based on skeleton length computation:\nThe set of valuations of pairwise distances between branch points is $\\{-1/5, 1/5\\}$ with respect to $v$. We pass to a ramified extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}_2$ of degree $e=5$ to analyze the geometry. The valuation $v_K$ is $e=5$ times the valuation $v$.\nThe distances become $v_K(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j)=-1$ and $-v_K(\\alpha_i)=1$.\nThe stable model has two components intersecting at one point. The thickness of this intersection point (the length of the corresponding edge in the dual graph) is the difference of the distance levels: $1 - (-1) = 2$."
