    "**Step-by-step analysis of the problem:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the polynomial structure.**\n    The polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n    The coefficients of the terms with variables, `1, -14, 56, -56`, are suggestive of a known family of polynomials. Let's consider the polynomials $P_n(x, a)$ defined by the recurrence relation $P_n(x, a) = x P_{n-1}(x, a) - a P_{n-2}(x, a)$ with $P_0(x, a) = 2$ and $P_1(x, a) = x$.\n    These polynomials satisfy the identity $P_n(u+a/u, a) = u^n + (a/u)^n$.\n    Let's compute the first few terms for $n=7$:\n    $P_2(x, a) = x^2 - 2a$\n    $P_3(x, a) = x^3 - 3ax$\n    $P_4(x, a) = x^4 - 4ax^2 + 2a^2$\n    $P_5(x, a) = x^5 - 5ax^3 + 5a^2x$\n    $P_6(x, a) = x^6 - 6ax^4 + 9a^2x^2 - 2a^3$\n    $P_7(x, a) = x^7 - 7ax^5 + 14a^2x^3 - 7a^3x$\n    Comparing the non-constant part of $f(x)$, which is $x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$, with $P_7(x, a)$:\n    *   $-7a = -14 \\implies a = 2$\n    *   $14a^2 = 14(2^2) = 14 \\cdot 4 = 56$ (This matches)\n    *   $-7a^3 = -7(2^3) = -7 \\cdot 8 = -56$ (This also matches)\n    So, the polynomial can be written as $f(x) = P_7(x, 2) + 22$.\n\n2.  **Relate the roots of f(x) to a simpler algebraic equation.**\n    A root $x$ of $f(x)=0$ satisfies $P_7(x, 2) = -22$. Let $x = u + 2/u$. Then $u^7 + (2/u)^7 = -22$.\n    Let $U = u^7$. Then $U + 128/U = -22$.\n    This gives a quadratic equation for $U$: $U^2 + 22U + 128 = 0$.\n    The roots of this quadratic equation are:\n    $U = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{22^2 - 4(1)(128)}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{484 - 512}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{-28}}{2} = -11 \\pm i\\sqrt{7}$.\n    So, the roots of $f(x)$ are of the form $x = u + 2/u$, where $u^7 = -11 + i\\sqrt{7}$ or $u^7 = -11 - i\\sqrt{7}$. This shows that the polynomial is solvable by radicals, which means its Galois group is a solvable group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Galois group of f(x) over Q.**\n    Let $G$ be the Galois group of $f(x)$. The polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (a fact we can assume from the nature of the problem, but it also follows from the structure of the Galois group). Since the degree is 7, $G$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_7$. The solvability of the polynomial implies that $G$ cannot be $A_7$ or $S_7$.\n    The structure of polynomials $P_n(x, a) - c$ has been studied. The Galois group is generally a subgroup of the affine group $AGL(1, n) = C_n \\rtimes C_{n-1}$. For our case ($n=7$), $G$ is a subgroup of $AGL(1, 7)$, which has order $7 \\cdot 6 = 42$.\n    The candidates for a transitive solvable group of degree 7 are $C_7$ (order 7), $D_7$ (the dihedral group of order 14), $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$ (order 21), and $AGL(1,7)$ (order 42).\n    A key observation comes from the quadratic equation for $U$. The discriminant is $-28$, so finding the roots requires adjoining $\\sqrt{-28} = 2i\\sqrt{7}$. The field extension involved is $\\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt{7})$.\n    The cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$ is of degree 6 over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and it contains a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$.\n    In the theory of these polynomials, the generic Galois group is $AGL(1,n)$. However, when the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{c^2 - 4a^n})$ coincides with the quadratic subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)$, the Galois group is known to be the smaller dihedral group $D_n$.\n    In our case, $n=7$, $a=2$, $c=22$. The field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{22^2 - 4 \\cdot 2^7}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-28}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$, which is indeed the quadratic subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$.\n    Therefore, the Galois group of $f(x)$ is $D_7$.\n\n4.  **Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem.**\n    The Chebotarev Density Theorem states that the natural density of the set of primes $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G$ that have the corresponding cycle structure.\n    For $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo $p$, its Frobenius element at $p$ (Frob$_p$) must act as a single cycle on the roots of $f(x)$. Since the degree of $f(x)$ is 7, this means Frob$_p$ must be a 7-cycle.\n    The required density is the proportion of elements in $G = D_7$ that are 7-cycles.\n\n5.  **Count the 7-cycles in the dihedral group D_7.**\n    The dihedral group $D_7$ is the group of symmetries of a regular heptagon. It has $2 \\times 7 = 14$ elements.\n    $D_7 = \\langle r, s \\mid r^7 = 1, s^2 = 1, srs^{-1} = r^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of $D_7$ are:\n    *   The identity element, $e$.\n    *   Six rotations: $r, r^2, r^3, r^4, r^5, r^6$. Each of these elements has order 7 and acts as a 7-cycle on the vertices of the heptagon.\n    *   Seven reflections: $s, sr, sr^2, \\dots, sr^6$. Each of these elements has order 2. In their action on the vertices, they fix one vertex and permute the remaining six in three pairs (3 transpositions). So they are not 7-cycles.\n    Thus, there are 6 elements in $D_7$ that are 7-cycles.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final density.**\n    The density is the number of 7-cycles divided by the total number of elements in the group:\n    Density = (Number of 7-cycles in $D_7$) / (Order of $D_7$) = $6 / 14 = 3/7$.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n*   Polynomial is identified as $f(x) = P_7(x, 2) + 22$.\n*   This structure implies a solvable Galois group, $G$.\n*   The parameter choice leads to an extension involving $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-7})$, the quadratic subfield of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_7)$.\n*   This specifies the Galois group to be $G = D_7$.\n*   The density of primes $p$ where $f(x)$ is irreducible mod $p$ is the ratio of 7-cycles in $G$.\n*   $D_7$ has 14 elements.\n*   The number of 7-cycles in $D_7$ is 6 (the non-identity rotations).\n*   The density is $6/14 = 3/7$.\n\n<<<3/7>>>"
