    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the system.\n\n**1. Understand the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given the system of differential equations:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\nLet's write it as:\n$$d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3$$\n$$u' = u^3 - u^2$$\nWe need to find the separatrix in the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$. A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of the phase space with different qualitative behaviors. Typically, the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices.\n\n**2. Find the Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points occur where $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\nFirst, solve $u' = 0$:\n$u^2(u - 1) = 0 \\implies u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute $u = 0$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n    So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute $u = 1$ into the equation for $d'$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5(1)^2 - 3(1))d + 1^4 - 1^3 = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d + 1) = 0 \\implies d = 0$ or $d = -1$.\n    So, $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the region $u \\geq 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Stability of the Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe linearize the system by finding the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d)$:\n$$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d + 4u^3 - 3u^2 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSince the Jacobian is a lower triangular matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries:\n$\\lambda_1 = 3u^2 - 2u$\n$\\lambda_2 = 4d + 5u^2 - 3u$\n\n*   **At (0, 0):** $\\lambda_1 = 0$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$. This is a non-hyperbolic point, and linearization is inconclusive.\n*   **At (1, 0):** $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$, $\\lambda_2 = 4(0) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) = 2$. Since both eigenvalues are positive, $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n*   **At (1, -1):** $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$, $\\lambda_2 = 4(-1) + 5(1)^2 - 3(1) = -4 + 5 - 3 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs (1 and -2), $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n**4. Identify the Separatrices**\n\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n\n*   **Stable Manifold:** The stable manifold corresponds to the negative eigenvalue $\\lambda_2 = -2$. The eigenvector is found by solving $(J - \\lambda_2 I)v = 0$ at $(1, -1)$.\n    $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 - (-2) & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 - (-2) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This gives $3v_u = 0 \\implies v_u = 0$. The eigenvector is in the direction $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is the vertical direction. The stable manifold is tangent to the line $u=1$ at the point $(1,-1)$.\n    In fact, the line $u=1$ is an invariant manifold of the system, since if $u=1$, $u' = (1-1)(1^2)=0$. Trajectories starting on this line stay on it. The dynamics on this line are governed by $d' = 2d(d+1)$. For $d<0$, trajectories move towards $d=-1$. Thus, the stable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$ is the line segment $\\{(u,d) | u=1, d<0\\}$.\n\n*   **Unstable Manifold:** The unstable manifold corresponds to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$. The eigenvector is found by solving $(J - \\lambda_1 I)v = 0$ at $(1, -1)$.\n    $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 - 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 - 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n    This gives $-6v_u - 3v_d = 0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector is in the direction $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The unstable manifold is tangent to the line with slope $dv_d/dv_u = -2$ at the point $(1, -1)$.\n\n**5. Find the Equation of the Unstable Manifold**\n\nWe look for an invariant curve of the form $d = f(u)$ that passes through the saddle point $(1, -1)$. Let's try to find a polynomial solution $d(u) = au^2 + bu + c$. If this curve is an invariant manifold, then a trajectory $(u(t), d(t))$ that starts on the curve remains on it. This means $d(t) = a u(t)^2 + b u(t) + c$ must satisfy the system for all time.\nDifferentiating with respect to $t$:\n$d'(t) = (2au(t) + b)u'(t) = (2au+b)(u^3-u^2)$.\n\nSubstituting $d = au^2+bu+c$ into the original equation for $d'$:\n$d' = 2(au^2+bu+c)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(au^2+bu+c) + u^4-u^3$.\n\nBy expanding and comparing the coefficients of the powers of $u$ in both expressions for $d'$, we can find the values of $a, b, c$.\nA detailed comparison of coefficients (as shown in the thought process) reveals two possible polynomial solutions:\n1.  $d = -u^2$ (corresponds to $a=-1, b=0, c=0$)\n2.  $d = u - u^2$ (corresponds to $a=-1, b=1, c=0$)\n\nNow we check which of these curves corresponds to the separatrix from the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n1.  For the curve $d = -u^2$: At $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. This curve passes through the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n2.  For the curve $d = u - u^2$: At $u=1$, $d = 1 - (1)^2 = 0$. This curve passes through the unstable node $(1, 0)$.\n\nTherefore, the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$ is the curve $d = -u^2$. Let's also check its slope at $(1, -1)$.\nFor $d = -u^2$, the slope is $\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2$. This matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$ that we found earlier.\n\nThis confirms that the curve $d = -u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe separatrices of the system are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n*   Stable manifold: The line $u=1$ (specifically for $d<0$).\n*   Unstable manifold: The parabola $d = -u^2$.\n\nThe question asks for \"the separatrix\", which typically refers to the most defining, non-trivial separating curve. The curve $d = -u^2$ connects the saddle point $(1,-1)$ to the equilibrium point $(0,0)$ and separates the phase plane into regions with distinct trajectory behaviors.\n\nThe separatrix is given by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
