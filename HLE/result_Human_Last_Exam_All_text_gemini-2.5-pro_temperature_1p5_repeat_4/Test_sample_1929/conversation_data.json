    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the type of reaction.**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene). Its structure is CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. This molecule is a conjugated diene, which means it has alternating double and single bonds. For the reaction to occur, it must adopt an s-cis conformation.\n*   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This molecule is a substituted alkene and will act as the \"dienophile\" (diene-loving component). The electron-withdrawing halogen atoms make it an excellent dienophile.\n*   **Type of Reaction:** The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a classic **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, where the 4 pi electrons from the diene and the 2 pi electrons from the dienophile combine to form a new six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 2: Predict the structure of the product.**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted process, meaning all bond-making and bond-breaking occurs in a single step through a cyclic transition state.\n1.  A new single bond forms between carbon 1 of the butadiene and one of the carbons of the dienophile's double bond.\n2.  A second new single bond forms between carbon 4 of the butadiene and the other carbon of the dienophile's double bond.\n3.  The double bond of the dienophile is consumed in this process.\n4.  The two double bonds of the butadiene are also consumed, and a new double bond is formed between carbon 2 and carbon 3 of the original diene.\n\nThe result is the formation of a six-membered ring, which is a derivative of cyclohexene. The substituents that were on the dienophile (two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms) are now attached to the two new saturated carbons in the ring.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the regiochemistry.**\n*   The diene, 1,3-butadiene, is symmetrical. Carbon 1 is equivalent to carbon 4.\n*   The dienophile, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene, is unsymmetrical. One carbon is bonded to two chlorine atoms (CCl₂) and the other to two fluorine atoms (CF₂).\n*   Because the diene is symmetrical, there is only one possible regioisomeric product. It does not matter whether the CCl₂ group adds to carbon 1 and the CF₂ group to carbon 4 of the butadiene, or vice-versa. The resulting molecule is identical.\n\nThe connectivity of the product is a six-membered ring containing the following sequence of atoms:\n`-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-CF₂-CCl₂-`\n\n**Step 4: Name the product using IUPAC nomenclature.**\n1.  **Identify the parent ring:** The product is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so the parent name is **cyclohexene**.\n2.  **Number the ring:** The double bond is assigned positions 1 and 2. The numbering must be done in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible locants (positions).\n    *   If we number the ring such that the double bond is C1-C2, the carbons bearing the halogens will be at positions 4 and 5. The locant set for the substituents is {4, 4, 5, 5}.\n3.  **Name the substituents:** The substituents are two chlorine atoms (dichloro) and two fluorine atoms (difluoro).\n4.  **Alphabetize and assign locants:** According to IUPAC rules, when there is a choice in numbering that results in the same locant set, the substituent that comes first alphabetically is given the lower number. \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically.\n5.  Therefore, the CCl₂ group is assigned to position 4, and the CF₂ group is assigned to position 5.\n6.  **Assemble the final name:** Combining all the parts gives the name **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   **Reaction Condition:** Diels-Alder reactions are typically promoted by heat. No other catalyst is usually required.\n*   **Conformation of Diene:** The 1,3-butadiene must be in the s-cis conformation to react. The s-trans conformation is more stable, but there is a low-energy barrier to rotation, allowing the reaction to proceed.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific, meaning the stereochemistry of the dienophile is retained in the product. In this case, the dienophile is planar, and no new chiral centers are formed in the product (the carbons with halogens have two identical substituents each), so there are no stereoisomers to consider.\n\nThe final product is a single compound with the following structure and name:\n\n**Structure:**\n```\n      Cl Cl\n       \\ /\n      4-C --- C-3-H₂\n       /       \\\n    5-C ------- C-2=H\n     / \\       /\n    F   F     H-C-1=\n             /\n          6-H₂\n```\n**Name:** 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
