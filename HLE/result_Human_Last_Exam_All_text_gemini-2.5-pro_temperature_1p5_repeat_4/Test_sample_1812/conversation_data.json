    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe primary goal is to compute the determinant of a given matrix. The matrix is provided explicitly.\n\n**2. Identify the Matrix in Question:**\nThe problem statement defines the matrix as:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nWhile the question uses the term \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\", it explicitly defines this matrix as `A`. Therefore, the task is to calculate the determinant of `A`.\n\n**3. List Careful Points:**\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The terms \"Markov quiver\" and \" \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) \" are specific to advanced mathematical topics (like cluster algebras). However, since the matrix `A` is given explicitly, this information appears to be context or a potential distraction (a \"red herring\"). The calculation of the determinant of `A` does not require this external knowledge.\n*   **Matrix Properties:** Before performing a full calculation, it's wise to inspect the matrix for any special properties that might simplify the process.\n\n**4. Analyze the Properties of Matrix A:**\nLet's examine the relationships between the rows and columns of `A`.\n\n*   **Sum of Rows:**\n    *   Row 1: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Row 2: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Row 3: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n    Each row sums to zero.\n\n*   **Sum of Columns:**\n    *   Column 1: \\(2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Column 2: \\(-1 + 2 + (-1) = 0\\)\n    *   Column 3: \\(-1 + (-1) + 2 = 0\\)\n    Each column also sums to zero.\n\n**5. Relate Matrix Properties to the Determinant:**\nA fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that the determinant of a square matrix is zero if and only if its column vectors (or row vectors) are linearly dependent.\n\n*   Let \\( \\mathbf{c_1}, \\mathbf{c_2}, \\mathbf{c_3} \\) be the column vectors of `A`.\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{c_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{c_2} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{c_3} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\]\n*   Let's check for linear dependence by summing them:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{c_1} + \\mathbf{c_2} + \\mathbf{c_3} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2-1-1 \\\\ -1+2-1 \\\\ -1-1+2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    \\]\n*   Since a non-trivial linear combination of the column vectors equals the zero vector, the columns are linearly dependent.\n*   Therefore, the matrix `A` is singular, and its determinant must be 0.\n\n**6. Verification by Direct Calculation (Optional):**\nWe can confirm this result by computing the determinant using the standard formula for a 3x3 matrix:\n\\[ \\det(A) = a(ei-fh) - b(di-fg) + c(dh-eg) \\]\nFor matrix `A`:\n\\begin{align*} \\det(A) &= 2 \\begin{vmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} - (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{vmatrix} + (-1) \\begin{vmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{vmatrix} \\\\ &= 2((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + 1((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - 1((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1)) \\\\ &= 2(4 - 1) + 1(-2 - 1) - 1(1 + 2) \\\\ &= 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3) \\\\ &= 6 - 3 - 3 \\\\ &= 0 \\end{align*}\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBoth methods (analysis of linear dependence and direct computation) yield the same result. The extraneous information regarding the Markov quiver is not needed for the calculation. The determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
