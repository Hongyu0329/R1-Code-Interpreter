    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the term \"Cambré Derrière\"**\n*   **Cambré:** This is a ballet term meaning \"arched\" or \"bent.\" It refers to a bend of the body from the waist in any direction: forward (en avant), backward (derrière), or to the side (à la seconde).\n*   **Derrière:** This means \"to the back.\"\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** Therefore, this is a bend of the upper body backwards from the waist. It is a common movement in all ballet training methods, used to develop flexibility and strength in the back and core.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Vaganova Method's approach to Cambré Derrière**\n*   The Vaganova method, developed in Russia by Agrippina Vaganova, emphasizes precision, strength, and purity of line.\n*   **Key Point:** In a Vaganova cambré derrière, the primary instruction is to keep the hips square and directly over the supporting legs. The dancer must not push the pelvis forward.\n*   The bend originates from the upper back (thoracic spine), creating a graceful arch while maintaining a strong, stable core and lower back.\n*   The head follows the line of the spine, lifting to look up and then arching back without collapsing the neck.\n*   The goal is to demonstrate control and spinal flexibility while maintaining a stable, aligned foundation in the hips and legs.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Balanchine Method's approach to Cambré Derrière**\n*   The Balanchine method, developed by George Balanchine in the United States, is known for its speed, musicality, and extended, often extreme, lines.\n*   **Key Point:** In a Balanchine cambré derrière, the dancer is typically encouraged to push the hips forward as the upper body bends back.\n*   This forward push of the hips creates a more extreme, dynamic arch throughout the entire body. It allows for a deeper and more visually dramatic backbend.\n*   The aesthetic is different; it's less about a \"pure\" spinal bend over a stable base and more about creating a single, sweeping curve from the feet through the torso and head. This often contributes to the \"off-balance\" quality seen in Balanchine's style.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the two methods and evaluate the answer choices**\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there might be subtle stylistic differences in arm pathways, the fundamental technical difference that defines the movement's shape is not the arm placement.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most significant and defining difference. Vaganova requires the hips to remain stationary and square, while Balanchine encourages the hips to push forward. This one change in instruction dramatically alters the entire shape, depth, and quality of the movement.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is generally faster, a cambré can be performed at any tempo in either method. Speed is a performance quality, not a core technical difference in the execution of the position itself.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the backbend is a *result* of the technique used. Pushing the hips forward in the Balanchine style *allows* for a deeper backbend. The foundational cause of this difference is the hip placement, not the degree of the bend itself.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** The head placement differs in accordance with the depth and shape of the backbend in each style. Like the degree of the bend, it is a consequence of the core technical instruction regarding the hips.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe primary, foundational difference in the technique of a cambré derrière between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the placement of the hips. Vaganova maintains stable hips, while Balanchine pushes the hips forward.\n\n<<<B>>>"
