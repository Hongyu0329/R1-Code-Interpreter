The two problems are (1) the Justification Demarcation Problem, where the JTB model fails to specify the necessary threshold for what counts as sufficient justification to elevate a True Belief to Knowledge, and (2) the Inadequate Categorization of Justified False Beliefs, where the model forces well-reasoned but false beliefs into the same category as arbitrary or irrational beliefs, erasing the important distinction between a reasonable error and a groundless opinion.
