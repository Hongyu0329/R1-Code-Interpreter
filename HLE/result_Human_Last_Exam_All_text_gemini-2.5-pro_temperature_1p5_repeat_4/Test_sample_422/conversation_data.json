    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question and Constraints**\n\n*   **Core Concept:** The Justified True Belief (JTB) theory of knowledge. This theory posits that for an individual (S) to know a proposition (P), three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P must be true (The Truth condition).\n    2.  S must believe P (The Belief condition).\n    3.  S must be justified in believing P (The Justification condition).\n*   **Primary Constraint:** We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems are specific counterexamples to JTB where a person has a justified true belief that, intuitively, still doesn't count as knowledge because luck plays a key role. We must find problems with JTB that are *not* Gettier cases.\n*   **Secondary Constraint:** The *only available epistemic states* are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This is a significant simplification. In standard epistemology, we have a richer set of states (e.g., doubt, justified false belief, unjustified true belief, etc.). This constraint forces a binary classification: any cognitive state regarding a proposition is either Knowledge or Belief.\n*   **Goal:** Identify two distinct problems that arise for the JTB model under these specific constraints.\n\n**2. Identifying the First Problem: The Justification Demarcation Problem**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The JTB formula (Knowledge = Justification + Truth + Belief) is deceptively simple. The component \"Justification\" is not self-defining.\n*   **Analysis:** The theory states that a belief must be \"justified,\" but it provides no metric for what counts as sufficient justification.\n    *   How much evidence is required?\n    *   What kind of evidence is acceptable (e.g., empirical, logical, testimonial)?\n    *   Does the justification need to be infallible (guarantee truth), or can it be fallible (make truth highly likely)?\n*   **Impact of the Constraints:** This ambiguity becomes a critical flaw under the forced binary of \"Knowledge\" vs. \"Belief\". Consider a true belief that is supported by some evidence, but perhaps not very strong evidence. Does it qualify as Knowledge? Or is it merely a Belief? The JTB model itself doesn't give us the rule to make this distinction. It fails to provide a clear demarcation line to separate a True Belief that is justified enough to be Knowledge from one that isn't. This vagueness about the threshold of justification is a fundamental internal problem, completely independent of Gettier cases.\n\n**3. Identifying the Second Problem: The Inadequate Categorization of Justified False Beliefs**\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must analyze what happens when a belief is justified but fails one of the other conditionsâ€”specifically, the truth condition.\n*   **Analysis:** Consider a \"Justified False Belief\" (JFB). For example:\n    *   You look at a highly reliable clock that has always been accurate, and it reads 3:00. You form the belief, \"It is 3:00.\"\n    *   Your belief is justified based on strong past evidence and current perception.\n    *   However, unknown to you, the clock stopped precisely one hour ago, and it is actually 4:00. Your belief is therefore false.\n*   **Impact of the Constraints:**\n    *   According to JTB, this cannot be Knowledge because it fails the Truth condition.\n    *   The question states that the only other available epistemic state is \"Belief\".\n    *   Therefore, your JFB must be categorized simply as a \"Belief\".\n    *   Now, compare this to an \"Unjustified False Belief.\" For instance, someone with no clock and no information guessing randomly that it is 3:00. This is also categorized as a \"Belief.\"\n    *   The problem is that the model collapses a crucial epistemic distinction. It places a belief formed through rational processes and strong evidence (but which happens to be wrong) in the very same category as a belief formed through whim, fantasy, or pure guessing. It fails to distinguish between a *reasonable mistake* and an *unreasonable opinion*, treating both as mere \"Belief\". This makes the category of \"Belief\" overly broad and epistemically uninformative.\n\n### Final Summary of the Problems\n\n1.  **The Justification Demarcation Problem:** JTB does not define the quality or quantity of justification required to turn a True Belief into Knowledge, leaving a critical ambiguity in its own definition, especially when forced into a binary choice between Knowledge and Belief.\n2.  **The Inadequate Categorization of Justified False Beliefs:** By requiring truth for Knowledge, the model relegates all false beliefs to the single category of \"Belief\". This fails to distinguish between justified, rational-but-false beliefs and unjustified, irrational beliefs, thereby losing a crucial distinction about epistemic reasonableness.\n\n<<<The two problems are (1) the Justification Demarcation Problem, where the JTB model fails to specify the necessary threshold for what counts as sufficient justification to elevate a True Belief to Knowledge, and (2) the Inadequate Categorization of Justified False Beliefs, where the model forces well-reasoned but false beliefs into the same category as arbitrary or irrational beliefs, erasing the important distinction between a reasonable error and a groundless opinion.>>>"
