The leading-order behavior of the generating function $H(s, s')$ for the planar Birkhoff billiard map in the limit $|s' - s| \to 0$ is given by the asymptotic expansion:
$H(s, s') = |s' - s| - \frac{\kappa(s)^2}{24}|s' - s|^3 + O(|s' - s|^5)$
Here, $|s' - s|$ is the arc-length separation between the two collision points, and $\kappa(s)$ is the local curvature of the boundary at the point $s$. The leading term, $|s'-s|$, represents the arc length, while the first correction term, $-\frac{\kappa(s)^2}{24}|s' - s|^3$, quantifies the deviation of the chord length from the arc length due to the boundary's curvature.
