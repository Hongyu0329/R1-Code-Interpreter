    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What:** The question asks for the Beyond-Use Date (BUD).\n    *   **For what item:** A single-dose container, specifically an ampule.\n    *   **What is the event:** The ampule is punctured (i.e., broken open).\n    *   **What is the environment:** A sterile environment, which typically refers to an ISO Class 5 Primary Engineering Control (PEC) like a laminar airflow workbench.\n\n2.  **Define Key Terms:**\n    *   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** As defined by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), a BUD is the date or time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) shall not be used, stored, or transported. It is determined from the time the preparation is compounded or the container is opened.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container:** A container holding a quantity of a sterile drug intended for single use. Crucially, these containers lack an antimicrobial preservative.\n    *   **Ampule:** A specific type of single-dose container made of glass. To access the contents, the neck of the ampule must be broken. Once opened, it cannot be resealed, creating an open system.\n\n3.  **Consult the Authoritative Standard:**\n    The governing standard for this practice is USP General Chapter <797> \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations\". This chapter provides specific rules for handling different types of sterile containers.\n\n4.  **Apply the Standard to the Specific Item (Ampule):**\n    *   USP <797> has very strict rules for ampules because they are open systems once broken.\n    *   When an ampule is opened, its contents are immediately exposed to the surrounding air, regardless of how sterile that air is. Because it cannot be sealed again, there is no way to protect the contents from potential contamination after the initial opening.\n    *   Therefore, the standard requires that the contents of an opened ampule must be used immediately.\n\n5.  **Conclude the BUD:**\n    *   The term \"immediate use\" means there is no allowable storage time. The medication must be withdrawn and administered as part of one continuous process.\n    *   Any unused portion of the medication in the ampule must be discarded immediately after use. It cannot be saved, stored, or used for another dose or another patient.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Distinguish Ampule vs. Vial:** This is the most critical point. A single-dose *vial* (with a rubber stopper) punctured in an ISO Class 5 environment has a BUD of up to 12 hours. An *ampule* does not have a stopper and cannot be resealed, which is why its BUD is \"immediate use\".\n2.  **\"Immediate Use\" is the Answer:** The BUD is not a specific number of hours. The official guidance is that it must be used immediately.\n3.  **No Storage Permitted:** The concept of storing the remaining contents of an ampule for later use is strictly prohibited.\n4.  **Environment Doesn't Extend BUD for Ampules:** While opening the ampule in a sterile environment is required for safe handling, it does not grant any storage time for the opened container. The risk of contamination in an open system is too high.\n5.  **Discard Remainder:** It is mandatory to discard any leftover drug in an opened ampule.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the USP <797> guidelines for sterile compounding, an ampule is a single-dose container that, once opened, becomes an open system that cannot be resealed. Due to the high risk of contamination, its contents must be used immediately. Any unused portion must be discarded and cannot be stored. Therefore, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is immediate use.\n\n<<<Immediate use. The opened ampule must be used right away, and any unused portion must be discarded. It cannot be stored for any length of time.>>>"
