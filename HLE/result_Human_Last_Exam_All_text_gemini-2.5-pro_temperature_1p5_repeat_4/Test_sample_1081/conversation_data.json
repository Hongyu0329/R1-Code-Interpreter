    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Interpreting the Question:** The question asks for \"the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori\". In the context of algebraic groups and finite groups of Lie type, this phrasing almost always refers to the number of **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes** of such tori. The total number of such tori as subgroups of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ would be a complicated polynomial in $q$, whereas the number of classes is often a constant integer independent of $q$.\n\n2.  **Classification of Rational Tori:** There is a fundamental theorem in the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields that classifies the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori. This theorem states that these classes are in a one-to-one correspondence with the **$F$-conjugacy classes** of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n    *   Let $G$ be a reductive group defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, let $F$ be the corresponding Frobenius endomorphism, and let $W$ be the Weyl group of $G$.\n    *   An $F$-conjugacy class in $W$ is an orbit of the action of $W$ on itself defined by $g \\cdot w = g w F(g)^{-1}$ for $g, w \\in W$.\n\n3.  **Determining the Frobenius Action on the Weyl Group:** The action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ is induced by the action of $F$ on the root datum of $G$. This action on the root datum corresponds to an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram of the group's root system.\n    *   The group $G$ is of type $E_8$. We need to examine the symmetries of the $E_8$ Dynkin diagram.\n    *   The $E_8$ Dynkin diagram is:\n        ```\n              o --- o --- o --- o --- o --- o --- o\n                          |\n                          o\n        ```\n    *   This diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. The automorphism group of the $E_8$ Dynkin diagram is the trivial group.\n\n4.  **Implication of Trivial Diagram Automorphism:** The fact that the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms means that any group of type $E_8$ must be **split** over its field of definition. In our case, $G$ is defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, so it must be a split group.\n    *   For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the root datum and, consequently, acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. So, for any $g \\in W$, we have $F(g) = g$.\n\n5.  **Simplifying $F$-conjugacy to ordinary conjugacy:** Since $F$ acts as the identity on $W$, the definition of an $F$-conjugacy class simplifies.\n    *   The orbit of an element $w \\in W$ is given by $\\{ g w F(g)^{-1} \\mid g \\in W \\} = \\{ g w g^{-1} \\mid g \\in W \\}$.\n    *   This is precisely the definition of a standard **conjugacy class** in the group $W$.\n    *   Therefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n6.  **Finding the Number of Conjugacy Classes of W(E8):** The problem is now reduced to a combinatorial question about the finite group $W(E_8)$. The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a well-known finite reflection group. Its properties, including the number of its conjugacy classes, have been computed and are standard results in the literature.\n    *   The order of $W(E_8)$ is $696,729,600$.\n    *   The number of conjugacy classes of a finite group is equal to the number of its distinct irreducible complex characters.\n    *   According to standard references in group theory and the theory of Lie algebras (e.g., N. Bourbaki's \"Groupes et alg√®bres de Lie\", R. Carter's \"Simple Groups of Lie Type\"), the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is **112**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Interpretation of \"number of tori\":** The distinction between the total count of subgroups versus the number of conjugacy classes is crucial. The standard interpretation leading to a constant is the most plausible.\n*   **Split vs. Quasi-split Groups:** We needed to establish that $G$ is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. This follows directly from the fact that the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no symmetries. If there were symmetries, quasi-split non-split forms could exist, and the Frobenius action on $W$ would be non-trivial, making the counting of $F$-conjugacy classes more complex.\n*   **The independence of q:** The result is independent of the specific finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, a remarkable feature that stems from the underlying algebraic and combinatorial structure.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that the question is equivalent to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This is a known value from the mathematical literature.\n\nNumber of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori (up to $\\mathbb{F}_q$-conjugacy)\n= Number of $F$-conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$\n= Number of ordinary conjugacy classes in $W(E_8)$ (since $G$ is split)\n= 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
