    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem, a list of careful points, and the derivation of the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Objective:** The core task is to perform a lexicographical comparison of two strings.\n2.  **Input:** Two strings are provided as input, each on a new line.\n3.  **Constraints:**\n    *   The strings have the same length, which is between 1 and 100 characters.\n    *   The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n4.  **Comparison Rule:** The comparison must be case-insensitive. This means 'a' is treated as equal to 'A', 'b' to 'B', and so on.\n5.  **Output:**\n    *   Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   Print \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   Print \"0\" if the two strings are equal (considering the case-insensitive rule).\n6.  **Efficiency Goal:** The main goal is to write the *most memory-efficient* C program. This requires minimizing the total memory allocated for variables.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Case-Insensitive Comparison:** To compare characters without regard to case, they must first be converted to a common case (either all uppercase or all lowercase). The `tolower()` or `toupper()` functions from the `<ctype.h>` library are suitable for this.\n2.  **Buffer Sizing:** Since the maximum string length is 100, a character array (string buffer) in C must be of size at least 101 to accommodate the 100 characters plus the null terminator (`\\0`).\n3.  **Input Handling:** The two strings are on separate lines. When reading the first string with a function like `scanf(\"%s\", ...)`, a newline character (`\\n`) is left in the input buffer. This must be handled correctly before reading the second string.\n4.  **Memory Optimization Strategy:** The key to memory efficiency is to avoid allocating unnecessary space. Since the two strings arrive sequentially in the input stream, it's impossible to compare them without storing at least the first string. The most efficient approach would be to store the first string in a buffer and then read the second string one character at a time, comparing it against the corresponding character of the stored first string. This avoids allocating a second large buffer for the second string.\n5.  **Data Type Selection:** To minimize memory, the smallest appropriate data types should be used for variables. For a loop counter that goes from 0 to 100, a `char` (1 byte) is sufficient instead of an `int` (typically 4 bytes).\n6.  **Immediate Exit:** The program can terminate as soon as a difference between the strings is found. This avoids the need for an extra variable to store the result, further saving memory.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nThe goal is to find the value of `m`, the total memory in bytes used by the variables in the most memory-efficient C program.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Minimum Required Buffering**\nTo compare `string1[i]` with `string2[i]`, we need access to `string1[i]` while reading `string2[i]`. Since `string2` comes after `string1` in the input, we must store `string1` in memory. The second string, however, does not need to be stored entirely; it can be read character by character.\n\n**Step 2: Allocate Memory for the First String**\nWe need a buffer to store the first string. Given the maximum length of 100, the buffer must be 101 bytes.\n`char s1[101];`\n*Memory used: 101 bytes.*\n\n**Step 3: Choose Variables for Iteration and Character Storage**\nWe need a loop index to iterate through `s1`. Since the length is at most 100, a `char` is sufficient.\n`char i;`\n*Memory used: 1 byte.*\n\nWe also need a variable to store each character read from the second string. A `char` is perfect for this.\n`char c2;`\n*Memory used: 1 byte.*\n\n**Step 4: Design the Reading and Comparison Logic**\nThe program will first read the entire first string into `s1` using `scanf(\"%s\", s1);`. Then, it will loop from `i = 0` up to the length of `s1`. Inside the loop, it will read a single character from the input stream for the second string. The format specifier `\" %c\"` for `scanf` is ideal here, as the leading space will consume the newline character left after reading the first string on the first iteration and will have no effect on subsequent iterations.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate Total Memory (`m`)**\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all declared variables:\n*   Memory for the first string's buffer: `sizeof(s1)` = 101 bytes.\n*   Memory for the loop counter: `sizeof(i)` = 1 byte.\n*   Memory for the character from the second string: `sizeof(c2)` = 1 byte.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n\nThis approach is more memory-efficient than the standard method of using two 101-byte buffers, which would use at least `101 + 101 + 1 = 203` bytes. Therefore, 103 bytes is the memory usage of the most efficient solution.\n\n<<<103>>>"
