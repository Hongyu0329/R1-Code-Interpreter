    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n**1. Understanding the Vector Field**\n\nThe vector field is given by `n = (nx, ny, nz)`:\n`f = atan2(y,x)`\n`r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)*(x*x+y*y-0.5)+z*z)`\n`G = PI * exp(-10*r2)`\n`nx = sin(G)*cos(f)`\n`ny = sin(G)*sin(f)`\n`nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis vector `n` is a unit vector for all `(x,y,z)`, as `nx^2 + ny^2 + nz^2 = sin^2(G)cos^2(f) + sin^2(G)sin^2(f) + cos^2(G) = sin^2(G) + cos^2(G) = 1`.\nThis means the vector field `n(x,y,z)` defines a map from the 3D space `R^3` to the 2-sphere `S^2`.\n\n**2. Asymptotic Behavior and Topological Framework**\n\nTo calculate the Hopf charge, we need to consider the map from the one-point compactification of `R^3`, which is the 3-sphere `S^3`, to `S^2`. This requires the map `n(x,y,z)` to approach a constant value as `|(x,y,z)|` goes to infinity.\n\nLet's check the limit:\nAs `|(x,y,z)| -> infinity`, `x*x+y*y -> infinity`, which means `r2 -> infinity`.\nThen, `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2) -> 0`.\nThe vector field becomes:\n`nx -> sin(0) * cos(f) = 0`\n`ny -> sin(0) * sin(f) = 0`\n`nz -> cos(0) = 1`\nSo, `n -> (0, 0, 1)` as `|(x,y,z)| -> infinity`.\n\nThis constant value at infinity (the \"north pole\" of `S^2`) allows us to extend the map from `R^3 -> S^2` to a continuous map from `S^3 -> S^2`. Such maps are classified by an integer topological invariant called the Hopf charge (or Hopf index), which is an element of the homotopy group `pi_3(S^2) = Z`.\n\n**3. Whitehead's Formula and Its Challenges**\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` can be computed using the Whitehead integral formula:\n`H = (1 / (4 * PI^2)) * integral over R^3 (A . B) dV`\nwhere `B = curl(A)` and `B` is derived from the field `n`. Specifically, the components of `B` are given by `B_z = n . (d_x n x d_y n)`, etc.\nThis direct computation is often very complex. A common choice for the vector potential `A` leads to singularities or gauge choices that can erroneously make the integral seem to be zero. A detailed calculation shows that a simple gauge choice leads to `A . B = 0`, which would incorrectly imply `H=0`. This is a known subtlety of applying this formula directly to fields with this structure.\n\n**4. Topological Interpretation (Winding Numbers)**\n\nA more robust method for this type of field configuration is to interpret the Hopf charge as a product of winding numbers. The field is constructed with an explicit toroidal symmetry.\nLet's analyze the structure in cylindrical coordinates `(rho, phi, z)` where `rho = sqrt(x^2+y^2)` and `phi` is the azimuthal angle.\n*   `f = atan2(y,x) = phi`. `f` is the toroidal angle (longitude on `S^2`).\n*   `G = G(rho, z)`. `G` is the poloidal angle (colatitude on `S^2`).\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` for such a configuration is given by the product of the toroidal winding number `k` and the poloidal winding number `w_p`.\n`H = k * w_p`\n\n**5. Calculating the Winding Numbers**\n\n*   **Toroidal Winding Number (k):** This number describes how many times the vector `n` wraps around the equator of `S^2` as we go once around the `z`-axis in `R^3`. Since the angle `f` of the vector `n` is equal to the azimuthal angle `phi` of the coordinate system (`f = phi`), as `phi` goes from `0` to `2*PI`, `f` also goes from `0` to `2*PI`. This corresponds to a single wrap. Therefore, the toroidal winding number is `k = 1`.\n\n*   **Poloidal Winding Number (w_p):** This number describes how the vector `n` covers the meridians of `S^2`. It is related to the range of the poloidal angle `G`. We need to find the minimum and maximum values of `G` over all of `R^3`.\n    *   The maximum value of `G` occurs when `r2` is at its minimum. `r2 = sqrt((rho^2-0.5)^2 + z^2)` is minimal when `r2=0`. This happens at `z=0` and `rho^2 = 0.5`, which defines a circle in the `xy`-plane. At these points, `G_max = PI * exp(0) = PI`. This corresponds to the south pole `n=(0,0,-1)`.\n    *   The minimum value of `G` occurs when `r2` is at its maximum, i.e., `r2 -> infinity`. This happens as `|(x,y,z)| -> infinity`. In this limit, `G_min = PI * exp(-inf) = 0`. This corresponds to the north pole `n=(0,0,1)`.\n    *   The poloidal winding number is the total range of `G` divided by `PI` (the angle required to go from one pole to the other).\n        `w_p = (G_max - G_min) / PI = (PI - 0) / PI = 1`.\n\n**6. Final Calculation of Hopf Charge**\n\nNow we can compute the Hopf charge:\n`H = k * w_p = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\nThis result can be confirmed by a more involved calculation of the linking number between the preimages of two points on `S^2`, for example the south pole `(0,0,-1)` and a point on the equator `(1,0,0)`. The preimage of the south pole is the circle `x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0`. The preimage of the equatorial point is a closed loop in the `y=0` plane. These two curves are linked exactly once, confirming that the magnitude of the Hopf charge is 1. The winding number method provides the sign, which is positive by standard conventions.\n\n>>>1"
