    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct film:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for a specific film with several key identifiers:\n*   It is a **Hollywood feature film**.\n*   It was produced by a **major film studio**.\n*   It features a **teenager**.\n*   The teenager rides a **pink bike**.\n*   The teenager **pedals directly toward an oncoming car**.\n\n**Step 2: Brainstorm and eliminate potential candidates.**\n*   ***Pretty in Pink* (1986):** While this film prominently features the color pink and a teenager, the protagonist Andie drives a pink car (a Volkswagen Karmann Ghia), not a bike. This does not fit.\n*   ***It* (2017):** This film features teenagers on bikes, including the female protagonist Beverly Marsh. However, there is no scene where a character on a pink bike pedals directly at an oncoming car. The confrontations with the bully's car are different.\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982):** This film has iconic bike scenes but doesn't feature a pink bike or this specific confrontation with a car.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the correct film by matching all elements.**\nThe film that matches all the specific details is **Now and Then (1995)**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify each element against the identified film.**\n*   **Hollywood feature film by a major studio?** Yes, *Now and Then* was produced by New Line Cinema, a major studio subsidiary of Warner Bros.\n*   **Teenager?** The film's main characters are 12-year-old girls. While technically \"pre-teens,\" they are in the adolescent age range, and the actresses who played them (like Thora Birch and Christina Ricci) were teenagers at the time of filming. In the context of a coming-of-age story, this aligns with the \"teenager\" query.\n*   **Pink bike?** Yes, the character Teeny Tercell (played by Thora Birch) has a very memorable pink Schwinn bicycle.\n*   **Pedals directly toward an oncoming car?** Yes, there is a distinct and memorable scene where the girls confront the local bullies, the Wormer brothers. To prove her courage, Teeny pedals her pink bike straight into the path of their oncoming car, forcing them to swerve away at the last moment in a game of chicken.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, every specific detail in the question points directly to a key scene in the movie *Now and Then*.\n\n<<<Now and Then>>>"
