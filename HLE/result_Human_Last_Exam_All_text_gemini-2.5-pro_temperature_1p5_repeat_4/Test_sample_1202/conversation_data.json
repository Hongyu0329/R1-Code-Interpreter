    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided answer choices.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"Duplicate genes\":** The starting point is a gene that has been copied, resulting in two identical or nearly identical gene sequences in the genome.\n    *   **\"Retention\":** This means that over evolutionary time, both copies of the gene are kept as functional genes, rather than one being lost or inactivated.\n    *   **\"Divergence\":** This means the two retained copies evolve to become different from each other, either in their sequence, their expression pattern, or their function.\n    *   **\"Most likely mechanism\":** The question asks for the evolutionary model that best and most frequently explains how both retention and divergence occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Fates of Duplicate Genes:**\n    Immediately after duplication, one gene copy is redundant. This redundancy means that it is not subject to strong purifying selection, so mutations can accumulate. The possible outcomes are:\n    *   **Loss (Nonfunctionalization/Pseudogenization):** One copy accumulates deleterious mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene. This is the most common fate.\n    *   **Retention:** Both copies are maintained. The question focuses on the mechanisms that lead to this outcome.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, essentially \"copy-pasting\" from one gene copy to the other. This mechanism causes the two duplicate genes to become more *similar* over time (homogenization or concerted evolution). It works *against* divergence and therefore does not explain how the two copies become different.\n\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a gene copy is inactivated by mutations. This leads to the *loss* of one functional copy, not the *retention* of two. Therefore, it is the opposite of the phenomenon described in the question. While it is a common fate for duplicate genes, it is not a mechanism for their retention and divergence.\n\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy retains the original, ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely *new* function. This new function is beneficial, so natural selection favors the retention of both copies. This model successfully explains both retention and divergence. However, it requires a rare beneficial, gain-of-function mutation to occur before the redundant copy is lost through pseudogenization.\n\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns (e.g., expressed in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, each copy accumulates different degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations, causing each to lose a different subset of the original functions. As a result, both copies are now required to carry out the complete set of functions of the ancestral gene. This partitioning of tasks (sub-functions) ensures that both copies are retained by selection. This mechanism also explains both retention and divergence.\n\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern concerning the rapid diversification of species to fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not a molecular mechanism that operates on genes within a single genome. It describes a pattern at the species level, not the gene level.\n\n4.  **Compare the Viable Mechanisms (C vs. D):**\n    Both neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. The question asks which is \"most likely\".\n    *   **Probability:** The key difference lies in the types of mutations they rely on. Neofunctionalization requires a rare gain-of-function mutation. Subfunctionalization, on the other hand, relies on much more common loss-of-function mutations.\n    *   **Selective pressure:** Subfunctionalization provides a neutral pathway to retention. It doesn't require immediate positive selection for a new function. Instead, both genes become necessary through a series of relatively common degenerative mutations, effectively \"rescuing\" the duplicate pair from the much more common fate of pseudogenization.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Because it relies on more probable mutational events (loss-of-function) and doesn't require a rare innovative mutation, **subfunctionalization is considered a more likely and common initial mechanism for the retention of duplicate genes.** It provides a stable intermediate stage where both genes are preserved, allowing them more evolutionary time to potentially diverge further, perhaps even eventually leading to neofunctionalization.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, subfunctionalization is the most probable mechanism because it depends on common degenerative mutations to partition ancestral functions, providing a passive and more frequent route for retaining both gene copies compared to the rare gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
