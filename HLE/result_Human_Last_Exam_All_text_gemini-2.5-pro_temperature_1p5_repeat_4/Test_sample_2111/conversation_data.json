    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific \"conceptual entity.\" We are given several clues to identify it:\n    *   **Source:** The idea is discussed by the historian Fernand Braudel.\n    *   **Method:** Braudel discusses this entity by quoting another person, Paul Morand.\n    *   **Perspective:** The context is Braudel's emphasis on a \"global historical perspective.\"\n    *   **The Quote's Content:** The quote asserts that something \"should be inscribed within a sphere.\"\n    *   **The Example:** This \"something\" is exemplified by \"the symbol of a nation.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Figures:**\n    *   **Fernand Braudel:** A leading figure of the Annales School of history, famous for his work on large-scale historical structures, the *longue durée* (long term), and a global approach. His major work, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*, is central to his thought.\n    *   **Paul Morand:** A French writer and diplomat whose words are being used by Braudel.\n\n3.  **Locate the Specific Reference:** The quotation is found in the introduction to the third volume of Braudel's *Civilization and Capitalism*. This volume is titled *The Perspective of the World* (*Le Temps du monde*).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Context of the Quote:** In this introduction, Braudel is setting the stage for the main concept he will explore in the book. He is looking for a way to define a complex idea that moves beyond the traditional focus on the nation-state. He finds a fitting description in a line from Paul Morand.\n\n5.  **Examine the Quote and Braudel's Interpretation:**\n    *   Braudel presents Morand's line: \"Paul Morand once said that 'a nation, that great sentimental and carnal reality, must now be inscribed within a sphere'.\"\n    *   Crucially, Braudel immediately follows this quote with his own commentary, which directly answers the question. He writes: \"A better definition could hardly be found for the difficult concept of the **world-economy** (*économie-monde*), a concept which I wish to make central to the present volume.\"\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Findings:**\n    *   Braudel uses Morand's assertion that a \"nation\" must be seen within a larger \"sphere.\"\n    *   He explicitly states that this idea of a sphere containing the nation is a perfect metaphor or definition for his own historical concept.\n    *   That concept, the \"conceptual entity\" the question is asking for, is the **world-economy**. A world-economy, in Braudel's framework, is a large, self-contained geographic and economic zone with a center, peripheries, and a specific set of rules, which transcends national boundaries.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The Subject of the Quote vs. The Concept Being Defined:** The quote itself is about the \"nation.\" However, the question asks for the conceptual entity that *Braudel* is emphasizing *using* the quote. Braudel uses the idea of placing the nation within a sphere to define his larger concept.\n*   **The Role of the \"Sphere\":** The \"sphere\" in the quote is a metaphor. For Braudel, it represents the boundaries and integrated nature of a world-economy.\n*   **Braudel's Terminology:** The specific term Braudel coins and defines is \"world-economy\" (in French, *économie-monde*). This is distinct from the \"world economy\" (singular), as Braudel argued that multiple, separate world-economies could co-exist at the same time in history.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that Braudel quotes Morand not to talk about nations per se, but to introduce and define his central concept for the book *The Perspective of the World*. He explicitly names this concept immediately after the quote. Therefore, the entity in question is the world-economy.\n\n<<<world-economy>>>"
