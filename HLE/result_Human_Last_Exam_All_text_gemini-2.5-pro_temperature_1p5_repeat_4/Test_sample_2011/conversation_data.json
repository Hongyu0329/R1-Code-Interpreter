    "This problem asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** A collection of 128 points (vertices) and some lines (edges) connecting pairs of vertices.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge). The \"size\" of the clique is the number of vertices in it.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a set of vertices `S`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` consists of the vertices `S` and *all* the edges from the original graph that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **A clique as an induced subgraph:** A clique of size `k` corresponds to a set of `k` vertices, let's call it `S`, such that the induced subgraph `G[S]` is a complete graph (`K_k`). This is equivalent to saying that `S` is a clique. The term \"induced\" here reinforces that we are looking for a complete subgraph on a specific set of vertices, not just a subgraph that happens to be a clique but might be part of a larger, non-clique structure on more vertices.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Question and Potential Interpretations\n\nThe question asks for the maximum number of *different* clique sizes. Let's analyze two possible interpretations of the word \"clique\".\n\n**Interpretation A: \"Clique\" refers to any set of fully connected vertices.**\n\nThis is the most direct and standard definition. Let's see where it leads.\n1.  Let the set of all possible clique sizes in a graph `G` be `C(G)`. We want to maximize the number of elements in this set, `|C(G)|`.\n2.  Consider the largest clique in the graph `G`. Let its size be `k_max`. This is known as the clique number of `G`, denoted `ω(G)`.\n3.  If a graph has a clique of size `k_max`, say on a vertex set `S`, then *any* subset of `S` is also a clique.\n4.  This means if there's a clique of size `k_max`, there are also cliques of sizes `1, 2, 3, ..., k_max - 1`.\n5.  Therefore, the set of all clique sizes in `G` is simply `{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`. The number of different sizes is `ω(G)`.\n6.  The problem is now reduced to: What is the maximum possible clique number `ω(G)` for a graph on `n=128` vertices?\n7.  The largest possible clique in a graph with 128 vertices is a clique of size 128. This is achieved by the **complete graph `K_128`**, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n8.  For `G = K_{128}`, `ω(G) = 128`. This graph contains cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n9.  Under this interpretation, the maximum number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\nThis answer is very simple and hinges only on understanding the definition of a clique. The phrasing of the question, asking for a careful, step-by-step analysis, suggests there might be a more subtle point.\n\n**Interpretation B: \"Clique\" is intended to mean \"Maximal Clique\".**\n\nIn graph theory problems, sometimes \"clique\" is used colloquially to mean a *maximal clique*. A clique is maximal if it cannot be extended by adding any other vertex from the graph. This interpretation leads to a more complex and interesting problem.\n1.  Let the question be: What is the maximum number of different sizes of *maximal* cliques a graph on 128 vertices can have?\n2.  Let's try to construct a graph `G` that has maximal cliques of `m` different sizes: `s_1, s_2, ..., s_m`.\n3.  To create a maximal clique of a specific size `s_i`, the most vertex-efficient method is to create a complete graph `K_{s_i}` as a separate component of the larger graph `G`. In a `K_{s_i}` component, the entire set of `s_i` vertices forms a maximal clique, and there are no others (besides those of size 1 if `s_i=1`).\n4.  To get `m` different maximal clique sizes, we can construct the graph `G` as a disjoint union of complete graphs: `G = K_{s_1} + K_{s_2} + ... + K_{s_m}`.\n5.  The total number of vertices in this construction is `s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_m`. This sum must be less than or equal to the total number of vertices available, which is `n = 128`.\n6.  Our goal is to maximize `m`, the number of different sizes. To have as many terms as possible in the sum while keeping the total low, we should choose the smallest distinct positive integers for the sizes `s_i`. So, we choose the sizes `{1, 2, 3, ..., m}`.\n7.  The problem becomes finding the maximum integer `m` such that the sum of the first `m` positive integers is at most 128.\n    The sum is given by the formula for triangular numbers: `1 + 2 + ... + m = m(m+1) / 2`.\n8.  We must solve the inequality: `m(m+1) / 2 <= 128`.\n    `m(m+1) <= 256`.\n9.  Let's test values of `m` near `sqrt(256) = 16`:\n    *   For `m = 15`: `15 * (15 + 1) = 15 * 16 = 240`. Since `240 <= 256`, `m=15` is possible.\n    *   For `m = 16`: `16 * (16 + 1) = 16 * 17 = 272`. Since `272 > 256`, `m=16` is not possible.\n10. The maximum possible value for `m` is 15.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\n\nThe construction for `m=15` involves taking disjoint cliques of sizes 1, 2, ..., 15. The total number of vertices used is `15 * 16 / 2 = 120`. We have `128 - 120 = 8` vertices remaining. We can add these as 8 isolated vertices (which are maximal cliques of size 1). The final graph would be `G = K_1 + K_2 + ... + K_{15} + 8K_1`. The set of maximal clique sizes in this graph is `{1, 2, 3, ..., 15}`. The number of different sizes is 15.\n\nComparing the two interpretations, the second one leads to a more substantial combinatorial problem, which is likely what is intended by a question that asks for a careful analysis. The ambiguity of the term \"clique\" is the central \"careful point\" to consider. Therefore, the most likely intended answer is 15."
