    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nIn quantum many-body physics, the single-particle Green's function describes the propagation of a particle added to the system or a hole (a particle removed from the system). The \"bare\" Green's function, denoted $G_0$, specifically describes this propagation in a simplified system where interactions between particles are ignored. The governing Hamiltonian is the non-interacting (or single-particle) Hamiltonian, $H_0$.\n\nThe time-ordered bare Green's function is formally defined as:\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = -i \\langle \\Phi_0 | T[\\hat{\\psi}(x, t) \\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(x', t')] | \\Phi_0 \\rangle$\nwhere:\n*   $|\\Phi_0\\rangle$ is the non-interacting ground state (e.g., the filled Fermi sea).\n*   $\\hat{\\psi}(x, t)$ and $\\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(x', t')$ are field operators in the Heisenberg picture, with their time evolution governed by $H_0$.\n*   $T$ is the time-ordering operator.\n\n**Step 2: The Feynman Path Integral and the Equation of Motion**\n\nThe Feynman path integral formalism provides a powerful way to calculate Green's functions. In this formalism, the Green's function is derived from a generating functional, which is a functional integral over all possible field configurations (paths). For a non-interacting system, the action $S_0$ is quadratic in the fields:\n\n$S_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int dt d^d x \\ \\mathcal{L}_0 = \\int dt d^d x \\ \\bar{\\psi}(x,t) (i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0) \\psi(x,t)$\n\nA key result of the path integral formulation is that the two-point Green's function ($G_0$) is the inverse of the operator appearing in the quadratic action. This means $G_0$ satisfies the following equation of motion:\n\n$(i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0) G_0(x, t; x', t') = \\delta(t-t')\\delta(x-x')$\n\nThis equation tells us that $G_0$ is the propagator corresponding to the single-particle Schrödinger equation.\n\n**Step 3: Introducing the Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$)**\n\nThe single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}_0$:\n$\\hat{H}_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$\n\nTo see the dependence of $G_0$ on $\\epsilon_k$, it is most convenient to work in the basis of these eigenstates $|k\\rangle$. This is equivalent to performing a Fourier transform from position-space to momentum-space (or whatever quantum number $k$ represents). We also Fourier transform from time to frequency, $\\omega$.\n\nIn this eigenstate-frequency basis $(k, \\omega)$, the differential operator $(i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} - \\hat{H}_0)$ becomes a simple algebraic expression.\n*   The time derivative $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ becomes $-i\\omega$.\n*   The Hamiltonian operator $\\hat{H}_0$ acts on its eigenstate and becomes the eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nSo, the operator becomes $(\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. The Green's function in this basis, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, is the inverse of this algebraic expression:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n**Step 4: Incorporating the Feynman Boundary Conditions (The $i\\eta$ Prescription)**\n\nThis is a critical point. The expression above has a singularity (a pole) when $\\hbar\\omega = \\epsilon_k$. The proper definition of the time-ordered Feynman propagator requires a specific prescription for handling this pole. This prescription is naturally embedded in the path integral formulation and ensures causality (that effects do not precede their causes).\n\nThe prescription involves adding an infinitesimally small imaginary part, denoted $i\\eta$ (or $i\\delta$, with $\\eta \\to 0^+$), to the denominator. The sign of this imaginary part depends on whether the energy level $\\epsilon_k$ is occupied or unoccupied in the ground state. Let $\\mu$ be the chemical potential (at T=0, this is the Fermi energy).\n\n*   **For Unoccupied States ($\\epsilon_k > \\mu$):** We are propagating a particle. Causality requires the pole to be in the lower half of the complex $\\omega$-plane.\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\n*   **For Occupied States ($\\epsilon_k < \\mu$):** We are propagating a hole (the absence of a particle). Causality requires the pole to be in the upper half of the complex $\\omega$-plane.\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\eta}$\n\nThese two cases can be combined into a single, compact expression using the signum function, $\\text{sgn}(x)$:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nThis final expression completely describes the functional dependence of the bare Green's function on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ in the frequency-momentum domain. It is an inverse linear function of $\\epsilon_k$, shifted by the frequency $\\omega$, with a small imaginary part whose sign depends on the energy level's position relative to the chemical potential.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<<<The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$, in the eigenstate-frequency representation $(k, \\omega)$, is given by the expression: $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\omega$ is the frequency, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal.>>>"
