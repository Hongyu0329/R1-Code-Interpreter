The functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$, in the eigenstate-frequency representation $(k, \omega)$, is given by the expression: $G_0(k, \omega) = \frac{1}{\hbar\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta \cdot \text{sgn}(\epsilon_k - \mu)}$, where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\omega$ is the frequency, $\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal.
