    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Core Terms of the Question\n*   **\"Historical Saints\"**: This term typically refers to individuals recognized for their holiness within Christian tradition who lived during or after the time of Jesus. This would include the Virgin Mary, the Apostles (like Peter and Paul), and later figures from Church history. This distinction is important because it separates them from Old Testament figures like Abraham, Moses, or David, who, while revered, are usually categorized as patriarchs or prophets. It also excludes celestial beings like angels (Michael, Raphael).\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: This is a strict criterion. An allusion or a description is not sufficient; the character's proper name must appear in the text of the poem.\n*   **\"In Milton's Paradise Lost\"**: The search must be confined strictly to the text of this specific epic poem, not including Milton's other works like *Paradise Regained* or his prose.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Likely Sections of the Poem\nThe narrative of *Paradise Lost* primarily concerns the fall of Satan and the fall of Man. The most logical place to find mentions of future historical figures would be in the final two books (XI and XII). In these books, the Archangel Michael shows Adam a prophetic vision of the future of mankind, from his immediate descendants all the way through biblical history to the time of Christ and the founding of the Church.\n\n### Step 3: Conduct a Careful Search of the Text\nWe will now examine the text, particularly Books XI and XII, for the names of prominent historical saints.\n\n*   **The Virgin Mary**: Michael describes the birth of Jesus from a virgin in Book XII: \"...a Virgin is his Mother, but his sire / The Power of the most High...\" (XII, 368-369). However, her name, **Mary**, is never used in the poem. She is only referred to as \"the Virgin\" or \"his Mother.\"\n\n*   **The Apostles**:\n    *   **St. Peter**: In Book XII, Milton includes a strong critique of the Papacy. Michael describes how the apostles' successors will corrupt the church: \"...and his successor he / Pretends, though holding but the keys of Hell...\" (XII, 516-522). This is a clear allusion to St. Peter, to whom Jesus gave the \"keys to the kingdom of heaven,\" but the name **Peter** is not mentioned.\n    *   **St. Paul**: Michael's description of the spiritual struggle of believers uses language directly from the Pauline Epistles (e.g., \"spiritual armour\" from Ephesians). He refers to \"the Apostle\" who gave commands to his followers. However, the name **Paul** is never explicitly stated.\n    *   **Other Apostles (John, James, etc.)**: A search of the text confirms that none of the other apostles are mentioned by their individual names. They are referred to collectively as \"the twelve\" or \"his Apostles.\"\n\n*   **Other Saints**: A thorough search for the names of other major saints (e.g., Augustine, Constantine, Stephen, etc.) reveals they are not present in the text of *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Findings and Draw a Conclusion\nThe complete absence of named saints from the Christian era is not an oversight but a deliberate theological choice by John Milton.\n\n*   **Milton's Puritanism**: As a devout Puritan, Milton rejected many of the traditions and hierarchies of the Catholic and Anglican churches. One of these was the veneration of saints, which Puritans often viewed as a form of idolatry that detracted from the singular worship of God.\n*   **Focus on Scripture**: Milton's focus is on the direct narrative of the Bible. His \"heroes\" of faith in Books XI and XII are the Old Testament figures: righteous **Enoch**, faithful **Noah**, obedient **Abraham**, and the law-giver **Moses**. He names these figures because they are central to the scriptural history leading to Christ.\n*   **Deliberate Omission**: By omitting the names of New Testament and later saints, Milton keeps the focus on Christ as the sole mediator and avoids any association with the hagiography (the writing of the lives of saints) he associated with a corrupt institutional church.\n\nTherefore, despite discussing the era of Christ and the early Church, Milton scrupulously avoids naming any historical Christian saints.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the text of *Paradise Lost* and an understanding of Milton's theological positions, the number of historical saints mentioned by name in the poem is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
