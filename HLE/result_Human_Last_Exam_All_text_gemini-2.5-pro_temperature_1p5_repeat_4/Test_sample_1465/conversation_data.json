    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand Coiled-Coil Structure:** Coiled coils are protein structures where alpha-helices twist around each other. Their formation is dictated by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the `a` and `d` positions form the hydrophobic core and are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state (how many helices assemble). Positions `e` and `g` are typically charged and contribute to specificity and stability through electrostatic interactions.\n\n2.  **Identify the Heptad Register:** We need to assign the `a, b, c, d, e, f, g` positions for each sequence. The sequences are all 28 amino acids long (4 heptad repeats). The `a` and `d` positions are usually occupied by hydrophobic residues like Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), or Alanine (A). Looking at the sequences, there is a recurring pattern of `E-X-X-X-X-L/I-K`, with Isoleucine (I) consistently at position 2 and another hydrophobic or key residue at position 5. This suggests a register where the heptad is shifted, starting with position `g`. Let's use the register `g-a-b-c-d-e-f`.\n    *   Position 1: `g`\n    *   Position 2: `a` (core)\n    *   Position 3: `b`\n    *   Position 4: `c`\n    *   Position 5: `d` (core)\n    *   Position 6: `e`\n    *   Position 7: `f`\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Sequence based on Core Residues (`a` and `d`):** We will use established rules from seminal studies (e.g., Harbury et al., 1993, Science) that link the identity of `a` and `d` residues to the oligomeric state.\n    *   `a=I, d=L`: Strong signal for **Dimers (2)**.\n    *   `a=L, d=L`: Signal for **Dimers (2)**.\n    *   `a=I, d=I`: Strong signal for **Trimers (3)**.\n    *   `a=L, d=I`: Strong signal for **Tetramers (4)**.\n    *   Polar residues (like N, Q) or beta-branched residues (like T, V) at core positions can also dictate the state.\n\n**Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n*   **`a` positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, I, I\n*   **`d` positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** A, A, W, A\n*   **Analysis:** The `a` positions are all Isoleucine (I), which is a very strong signal for a trimeric state. The `d` positions are mostly Alanine (A), which is small and can be accommodated in a trimer core. The single Tryptophan (W) is bulky, but a trimer core is more spacious than a dimer core and can often accommodate it.\n*   **Conclusion:** Trimer (3).\n\n**Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n*   **`a` positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, N, I\n*   **`d` positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** L, L, L, L\n*   **Analysis:** The core is predominantly `a=I, d=L`, which is the canonical motif for a dimer. The single Asparagine (N) at an `a` position also strongly promotes a dimeric state by forming a stabilizing inter-helical hydrogen bond.\n*   **Conclusion:** Dimer (2).\n\n**Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n*   **`a` positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, I, I\n*   **`d` positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** I, I, I, I\n*   **Analysis:** The core is `a=I, d=I`. This is the classic, canonical motif for a trimeric coiled coil. The packing of isoleucine knobs into isoleucine holes is most favorable with 3-fold symmetry.\n*   **Conclusion:** Trimer (3).\n\n**Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n*   **`a` positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, I, I\n*   **`d` positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** Q, Q, W, Q\n*   **Analysis:** This sequence presents a conflict. The `a=I` signal favors a trimer. However, the `d` position is mostly Glutamine (Q), a polar residue. Burying polar residues is generally unfavorable, but a \"polar zipper\" of Q residues in the core is a known motif that strongly promotes **tetramers**. In this case, there are competing signals. Looking at the answer choices, some list 3 and some list 4. If we assume the strong `a=I` signal dominates, it would be a trimer.\n*   **Conclusion:** Trimer (3) is a plausible outcome where the `a=I` signal overrides the `d=Q` signal.\n\n**Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n*   **`a` positions (2, 9, 16, 23):** I, I, I, I\n*   **`d` positions (5, 12, 19, 26):** T, T, W, T\n*   **Analysis:** This also presents a conflict. The `a=I` signal promotes a trimer. The `d` position is mostly Threonine (T), a beta-branched residue. Steric hindrance from beta-branching at the `d` position is known to favor dimers. A trimer is also possible if the `a=I` signal is dominant. A tetramer is unexpected as beta-branching at `d` would cause significant steric clashes. However, one answer choice proposes this outcome, possibly implying that a specific hydrogen-bonding network between four Threonine residues can form and stabilize a tetramer.\n\n**Synthesize and Select the Best Answer:**\nBased on our analysis, the sequence of oligomeric states is:\n1.  Trimer (3)\n2.  Dimer (2)\n3.  Trimer (3)\n4.  Trimer (3) (assuming `a=I` dominates)\n5.  Tetramer (4) (this assignment is unusual but required to match one of the answer choices)\n\nThis combination `3, 2, 3, 3, 4` corresponds to option E. Let's compare this to other options. Option D (`2,2,4,2,3`) contains multiple assignments that contradict fundamental principles (e.g., `a=I, d=I` leading to a tetramer). Option E is the most consistent with our step-by-step analysis, even with the unexpected assignment for the final sequence.\n\nFinal Answer Prediction: `3, 2, 3, 3, 4`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
