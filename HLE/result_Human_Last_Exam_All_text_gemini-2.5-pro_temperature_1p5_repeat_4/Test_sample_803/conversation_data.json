    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\nFirst, we need to clearly understand the terms used in the question.\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `a, b` in `S` (not necessarily distinct), their product `ab` is not in `S`. A key consequence is that the identity element `e` cannot be in any product-free set, as `ee = e`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (M.P.F.S.):** This is a product-free set `S` such that it cannot be extended by adding any element from `G \\ S`. That is, for any `g` in `G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **A set `S` fills `G`:** This means the subgroup generated by the elements of `S`, denoted `<S>`, is the entire group `G`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is called \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in `G` fills `G`. In other words, for every M.P.F.S. `S`, we must have `<S> = G`.\n*   **The Group in Question:** We are looking for groups `G` that are nonabelian and have an order of `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime number and `m` is a natural number (meaning `m ≥ 1`).\n\n### Step 2: Find a practical criterion for a filled group\n\nWorking directly with the definition of a filled group can be complex. Fortunately, there is a much simpler characterization, a theorem by P.P. Pálfy and László Pyber, which provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a group to be filled.\n\n**Criterion (Pálfy-Pyber Theorem):** A finite group `G` is filled if and only if for every non-trivial normal subgroup `N` of `G` (i.e., `N ≠ {e}` and `N` is normal in `G`), the quotient group `G/N` is **not** cyclic.\n\nThis theorem provides a powerful tool to test if a group is filled by examining its normal subgroups and corresponding quotients.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the structure of groups of order 2q^m\n\nLet `G` be any group of order `|G| = 2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m ≥ 1`. We can analyze its structure using Sylow's theorems.\n\n1.  **Sylow q-subgroup:** Let `P` be a Sylow `q`-subgroup of `G`. The order of `P` is `|P| = q^m`.\n2.  **Number of Sylow q-subgroups:** Let `n_q` be the number of Sylow `q`-subgroups in `G`. Sylow's theorems state two conditions for `n_q`:\n    *   `n_q` must divide the index of `P` in `G`, which is `|G|/|P| = (2q^m)/q^m = 2`. So, `n_q` can only be 1 or 2.\n    *   `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)`.\n3.  **Determining n_q:** We need to find `n_q` that satisfies both conditions.\n    *   If `n_q = 2`, then we must have `2 ≡ 1 (mod q)`. This implies that `q` divides `2 - 1 = 1`, which is impossible for any prime `q`.\n    *   Therefore, the only possibility is `n_q = 1`.\n4.  **Existence of a Normal Subgroup:** When there is only one Sylow `p`-subgroup for a prime `p`, that subgroup is normal in `G`. Thus, our Sylow `q`-subgroup `P` is a normal subgroup of `G`.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the filled group criterion\n\nNow we have all the pieces to apply the Pálfy-Pyber criterion to our group `G`.\n\n1.  **Identify a non-trivial normal subgroup:** We have established that the Sylow `q`-subgroup `P` is a normal subgroup of `G`. Since `m ≥ 1` and `q` is a prime, the order of `P` is `|P| = q^m ≥ q ≥ 3`. This means `P` is a non-trivial normal subgroup (`P ≠ {e}`). Let's set `N = P`.\n2.  **Examine the quotient group G/N:** The criterion states that for `G` to be filled, the quotient group `G/N = G/P` must not be cyclic.\n3.  **Calculate the order of the quotient group:** The order of `G/P` is `|G/P| = |G| / |P| = (2q^m) / q^m = 2`.\n4.  **Check if the quotient is cyclic:** Any group of order 2 is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 2, `Z_2`. Therefore, `G/P` is a cyclic group.\n\n### Step 5: Draw the final conclusion\n\nWe have found a non-trivial normal subgroup `P` in `G` such that the quotient group `G/P` is cyclic. According to the Pálfy-Pyber criterion, this means that the group `G` is **not** a filled group.\n\nThis argument holds for any group of order `2q^m` (where `q` is an odd prime and `m ≥ 1`), regardless of whether it is abelian or nonabelian. Since the question specifically asks for the **nonabelian** filled groups of this order, and our conclusion is that no group of this order can be filled, the set of such groups is empty.\n\nFor example, nonabelian groups like the dihedral group `D_6 = S_3` (order 6, `q=3, m=1`) or `D_{10}` (order 10, `q=5, m=1`) are not filled, as our analysis predicts. In `S_3`, the subgroup `A_3` is normal, and `S_3/A_3` is cyclic of order 2. In `D_{10}`, the subgroup of rotations `C_5` is normal, and `D_{10}/C_5` is cyclic of order 2.\n\nFinal Answer: There are no nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for any odd prime `q` and natural number `m`.\n\n<<<There are no such groups.>>>"
