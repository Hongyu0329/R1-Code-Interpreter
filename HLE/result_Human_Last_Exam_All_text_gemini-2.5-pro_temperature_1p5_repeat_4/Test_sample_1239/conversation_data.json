    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: State the Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, with velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$, where $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, the equations are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:**\n    $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:**\n    $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant positive kinematic viscosity. We have a system of 4 partial differential equations for the 4 scalar functions ($u_1, u_2, u_3, p$) in terms of 4 independent variables ($t, x_1, x_2, x_3$).\n\n### Step 2: Understand Lie Group Symmetries\n\nA Lie group of symmetries of a system of differential equations is a group of transformations of the independent and dependent variables that maps any solution of the system to another solution. The dimension of the Lie group is equal to the dimension of its Lie algebra, which is the vector space spanned by the infinitesimal generators of these symmetry transformations. We need to find all such linearly independent infinitesimal generators.\n\n### Step 3: List the Infinitesimal Generators\n\nThe calculation of the complete set of infinitesimal generators is a standard but lengthy procedure in symmetry analysis. The results are well-established in the literature. We list the generators for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations below.\n\n1.  **Time Translation:** The equations are invariant under a shift in time, $\\tilde{t} = t + \\epsilon$.\n    *   Generator: $X_t = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ (1 generator).\n\n2.  **Space Translations:** The equations are invariant under a shift in spatial coordinates, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon\\mathbf{a}$ for a constant vector $\\mathbf{a}$.\n    *   Generators: $X_i = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$ (3 generators).\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotations:** The equations are invariant under rotations of the spatial coordinates, which also rotate the velocity vector field.\n    *   Generators: $R_{ij} = x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} - x_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + u_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_j} - u_j \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}$ for $1 \\le i < j \\le 3$. (3 generators).\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts:** These correspond to changing to a frame of reference moving at a constant velocity, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}} = \\mathbf{x} + \\epsilon t \\mathbf{c}$, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} = \\mathbf{u} + \\epsilon \\mathbf{c}$.\n    *   Generators: $G_i = t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i}$ for $i=1, 2, 3$ (3 generators).\n\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation):** The equations admit a specific scaling symmetry.\n    *   Transformation: $\\tilde{t} = e^{2\\epsilon} t$, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{x}} = e^{\\epsilon} \\mathbf{x}$, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{u}} = e^{-\\epsilon} \\mathbf{u}$, $\\tilde{p} = e^{-2\\epsilon} p$.\n    *   Generator: $D = 2t \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\sum_i x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} - \\sum_i u_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} - 2p \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$ (1 generator).\n\n6.  **Pressure Symmetries:** The pressure term appears only as a gradient, $\\nabla p$. This leads to symmetries related to shifting the pressure.\n    *   **Constant Shift:** The transformation $\\tilde{p} = p + c$ (for a constant c) leaves $\\nabla p$ unchanged and is a symmetry.\n        *   Generator: $P = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$ (1 generator).\n    *   **Arbitrary Time Function Shift:** A more general symmetry is $\\tilde{p} = p + f(t)$ for any arbitrary smooth function $f(t)$, since $\\nabla f(t) = 0$. The infinitesimal generators for these are $h(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$ for any smooth function $h(t)$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Dimension\n\nThe existence of the symmetry involving an arbitrary function $h(t)$ means that the Lie algebra of symmetries is **infinite-dimensional**. The vector space of smooth functions $h(t)$ is infinite-dimensional.\n\nHowever, in many contexts, the question \"What is the dimension...\" implicitly asks for the dimension of the **maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra** of \"non-trivial\" or \"geometrical\" symmetries. The infinite-dimensional part related to the pressure is often treated as a \"gauge-like\" or \"trivial\" symmetry.\n\nFollowing the classic work of V. O. Bytev (1972) and subsequent literature, the \"fundamental\" or \"principal\" finite-dimensional symmetry algebra is the one generated by the transformations that affect the spacetime coordinates and the velocity field directly. This corresponds to the generators listed in points 1-6 above (specifically, the constant pressure shift generator from point 6).\n\nLet's sum the number of generators for this finite-dimensional subalgebra:\n*   Time translation: 1\n*   Space translations: 3\n*   Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n*   Constant pressure shift: 1\n\nTotal dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\nThis 12-dimensional Lie algebra, which contains the 10-dimensional Galilean algebra, a scaling symmetry, and a constant pressure shift, is the standard finite-dimensional algebra associated with the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe full Lie group of point symmetries is infinite-dimensional due to the gauge-like freedom in the pressure term ($p \\to p + f(t)$). However, the maximal finite-dimensional subalgebra of symmetries, often referred to as the fundamental or principal symmetry algebra, has a dimension of 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
