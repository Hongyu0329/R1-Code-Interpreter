    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's \"Symphony no. 2, Op. 4\".\n\n**Step 1: Identify the piece and the specific instrument section.**\nThe question concerns Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". We need to analyze the part for the first violins (Violino I) at the very end of the piece. The symphony has four movements, so we must look at the conclusion of the fourth and final movement, the \"Finale: Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n**Step 2: Consult the musical score.**\nTo find the exact notes, we must refer to the orchestral score. The final movement, although starting in D minor, ends triumphantly in D major. The key signature at the end is two sharps (F# and C#).\n\n**Step 3: Locate the final measures for the first violin part.**\nLooking at the Violino I line in the score in the final moments of the symphony, we need to identify the last three distinct notes played in sequence.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the pitches of the last three notes.**\n*   The very last measure of the symphony for the first violins is a single, sustained whole note. This note is a **D**, specifically the D two ledger lines above the treble clef staff (D6).\n*   In the measure immediately preceding the final note, the first violins play a two-note figure. The second note in that measure (the second-to-last note of the piece) is a **D**, specifically the D on the fourth line of the treble clef staff (D5).\n*   The first note in that same measure (the third-to-last note of the piece) is an **F#**, specifically the F# on the top line of the treble clef staff (F#5).\n\nSo, the sequence of the last three notes played by the first violin is F#5, followed by D5, and ending on D6.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the pitches to find the lowest one.**\nThe three notes are:\n1.  F#5 (F-sharp on the top line of the staff)\n2.  D5 (D on the fourth line of the staff)\n3.  D6 (D two ledger lines above the staff)\n\nBy comparing their positions on the musical staff, we can determine their relative pitch.\n*   D6 is the highest.\n*   F#5 is lower than D6.\n*   D5 is lower than F#5.\n\nTherefore, the lowest of these three notes is D5. The note name is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
