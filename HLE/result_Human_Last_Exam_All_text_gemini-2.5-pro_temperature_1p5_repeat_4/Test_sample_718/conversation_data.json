    "Answering this question requires a careful analysis of the terms involved, especially \"upper semilattice\" and \"tame functor\". The final answer depends critically on the precise definition of a \"tame functor\", as this term is not universally defined in this context. We will analyze the problem by exploring the most plausible interpretations.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Core Concepts\n\n1.  **Upper Semilattice ($J$):** This is a partially ordered set (poset) where for any two elements $j_1, j_2 \\in J$, their least upper bound (or join), denoted $j_1 \\vee j_2$, exists. When viewed as a category, the objects are the elements of $J$, and there is a unique morphism $j_1 \\to j_2$ if and only if $j_1 \\le j_2$. The join operation means this category has finite coproducts (of pairs of objects). An upper semilattice is also a *filtered category*, meaning for any two objects $j_1, j_2$, there is an object $k$ (namely, $k = j_1 \\vee j_2$) and morphisms $j_1 \\to k$ and $j_2 \\to k$.\n\n2.  **Functor ($f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$):** This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(j_1 \\to j_2): f(j_1) \\to f(j_2)$ to each relation $j_1 \\le j_2$, in a way that respects composition. The collection of all such functors forms an abelian category, denoted $\\text{Vect}_K^J$.\n\n3.  **n-resolvable:** A functor $f$ is *n-resolvable* if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means there exists an exact sequence:\n    $$0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$$\n    where each $P_i$ is a projective object in the category $\\text{Vect}_K^J$. The smallest such $n$ is the *projective dimension* of $f$, denoted $\\text{pd}(f)$.\n\n4.  **Projective Objects in $\\text{Vect}_K^J$:** The fundamental projective objects are the *representable functors*. For each $j \\in J$, the representable functor $P_j$ is defined by $P_j(k) = K$ if $j \\le k$ and $P_j(k) = 0$ otherwise. All projective objects in $\\text{Vect}_K^J$ are direct sums of these representable functors.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Problem's Core Assertion\n\nThe question asserts that there is a single integer $n$ for which *any* tame functor on *any* upper semilattice is $n$-resolvable. This is a very strong claim. Let's analyze its implications.\n\nThe projective dimension of functors generally depends on the structure of the poset $J$. For a finite poset $J$, the global dimension of $\\text{Vect}_K^J$ (the maximum projective dimension of any functor) is equal to the length of the longest chain of elements in $J$. Since an upper semilattice can have arbitrarily long chains, there is no universal bound on the global dimension that holds for all upper semilattices.\n\nThis implies that the property of being \"tame\" must be a very restrictive condition that forces the projective dimension to be small, independent of the geometry of $J$.\n\n### Step 3: Interpreting \"Tame Functor\"\n\nThe meaning of \"tame\" is crucial.\n\n*   **Interpretation A (Pointwise Finite-Dimensional):** In the context of topological data analysis (TDA) and persistence modules, \"tame\" often just means that each vector space $f(j)$ is finite-dimensional. However, this interpretation leads to a contradiction. For example, the poset $J = \\{a,b,c,d\\}$ with relations $a<c, a<d, b<c, b<d$ (known as the \"crown\" poset of type $\\tilde{D}_4$) is an upper semilattice. Its representation theory is \"tame\" (not \"wild\"), but the global dimension of $\\text{Vect}_K^J$ is 2. There exist functors on this poset (which are \"tame\" in the pointwise finite-dimensional sense) that have a projective dimension of 2. This contradicts the idea of a universal answer $n < 2$.\n\n*   **Interpretation B (A Decomposable Functor):** In many applications (like persistence over the real line), a key result is the *barcode decomposition theorem*, which states that any \"tame\" persistence module can be decomposed into a direct sum of simple building blocks called *interval modules*. An interval module, say for the interval $[a,b)$, is a functor that is the cokernel of the map of representables $P_b \\to P_a$.\n    Let's find the projective dimension of such an interval module, $I = I_{[a,b)}$. The sequence\n    $$0 \\to P_b \\to P_a \\to I \\to 0$$\n    is exact and consists of projective objects ($P_a, P_b$). This is a projective resolution of length 1. Therefore, the projective dimension of an interval module is 1. If a tame functor is defined as a direct sum of such interval modules, its projective dimension would also be 1 (since the projective dimension of a direct sum is the maximum of the components' dimensions).\n\n### Step 4: Reaching a Conclusion\n\nThe first interpretation of \"tame\" leads to a contradiction, as the projective dimension would depend on the specific upper semilattice. The second interpretation provides a path to a universal answer. While the barcode decomposition theorem does not hold for general upper semilattices, it is the most common context where the term \"tame functor\" (or \"tame persistence module\") is used. It is highly plausible that the question uses the term \"tame\" to refer to functors that are analogous to these well-behaved modules from persistence theory, i.e., those that have a simple structure that can be captured by a short resolution.\n\nUnder this interpretation—that a tame functor is one that admits a simple decomposition akin to barcodes, with each component having a projective dimension of 1—the functor is 1-resolvable.\n\nTherefore, a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is **1-resolvable**."
