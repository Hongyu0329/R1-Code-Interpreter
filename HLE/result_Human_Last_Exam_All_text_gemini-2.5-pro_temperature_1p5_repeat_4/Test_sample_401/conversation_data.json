    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Core Concepts\n\nFirst, we must have precise definitions for the terms used in the question.\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a compact, connected, non-empty Hausdorff space. The parenthetical remark \"(not necessarily metric)\" is crucial, as it tells us we must work within the framework of general topology, not just metric space theory.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subcontinua. A subcontinuum is a subspace that is also a continuum, and \"proper\" means it is not equal to the entire space $X$. In other words, if $X = A \\cup B$ where $A$ and $B$ are subcontinua of $X$, then either $A=X$ or $B=X$.\n*   **Composant:** For any point $x$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $x$, denoted $C(x)$, is the set of all points $y \\in X$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$. Equivalently, $C(x)$ is the union of all proper subcontinua of $X$ that contain the point $x$.\n\nThe question asks for the **smallest possible number** of composants that an indecomposable continuum can have.\n\n### Step 2: Establishing a Lower Bound on the Number of Composants\n\nThe set of all a continuum's a partition of the space. We want to find the minimum size of this partition for an indecomposable continuum.\n\n*   **Can the number be 1?**\n    If a continuum $X$ had only one composant, this would mean that for any point $p \\in X$, the composant $C(p)$ is the entire space $X$. This would imply that for any two points $x, y \\in X$, there exists a proper subcontinuum containing both $x$ and $y$.\n    There is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory (e.g., Theorem 11.7 in Nadler's \"Continuum Theory: An Introduction\") which states that **a continuum is decomposable if and only if it has only one composant**.\n    Since the question is about *indecomposable* continua, such a continuum must have more than one composant.\n\n*   **Conclusion of Step 2:** The number of composants must be at least 2.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Metric Case\n\nIt is instructive to consider the simpler, more familiar case of *metric* indecomposable continua first, to understand why the \"not necessarily metric\" clause is so important.\n\n*   For any indecomposable *metric* continuum, it is a classical theorem of S. Mazurkiewicz that the number of composants is at least $c$ (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., $2^{\\aleph_0}$). In fact, the number is exactly $c$.\n*   The proof relies on the Baire Category Theorem. One shows that in an indecomposable metric continuum, every composant is a *meager* set (a set of the first category). A complete metric space (which a compact metric space is) cannot be a countable union of meager sets. Therefore, the collection of composants must be uncountable.\n*   If we were restricted to metric continua, the answer would be $c$, which is uncountably infinite. The parenthetical remark in the question directs us away from this conclusion.\n\n### Step 4: Analyzing the General (Non-Metric) Case\n\nThe Baire Category Theorem argument holds for any compact Hausdorff space, not just metric spaces. A compact Hausdorff space is a Baire space. The argument goes as follows:\n\n1.  Assume a compact Hausdorff space $X$ is the union of a collection of its composants, $X = \\bigcup_{i \\in I} C_i$.\n2.  If one can show that every composant $C_i$ is a meager set, then the index set $I$ must be uncountable, otherwise $X$ would be a countable union of meager sets, contradicting the Baire Category Theorem.\n\nThe key question is whether every composant in a general indecomposable continuum is meager. In the metric case, this is true. However, the proofs of this fact for metric spaces rely on properties (like being a countable union of proper subcontinua) that do not necessarily hold for arbitrary non-metric continua.\n\nThe question of whether an indecomposable continuum can have a countable number of composants (known as **van Douwen's problem**) turns out to be independent of the standard axioms of set theory (ZFC). This means that within ZFC, one can neither prove that the number of composants must be uncountable nor prove that an example with a countable number exists. The answer depends on which model of set theory one is working in.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Smallest Possible Number\n\nSince the answer is independent of ZFC, we must consider what is *consistently* possible.\n\n*   In a 2000 paper, A. Dow and K.P. Hart showed that it is **consistent with ZFC** that there exists an indecomposable continuum with **exactly two** composants. Their construction requires an additional set-theoretic axiom, namely Martin's Axiom for countable posets (MA$_{countable}$).\n\nSince the question asks for the \"smallest number... an ... continuum can have,\" and it has been shown that such a continuum can (consistently) exist with 2 composants, this establishes 2 as a possible value.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n1.  An indecomposable continuum must have at least **two** composants.\n2.  It is consistent with the standard axioms of mathematics that an indecomposable continuum can have exactly **two** composants.\n\nCombining these two facts, the smallest possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
