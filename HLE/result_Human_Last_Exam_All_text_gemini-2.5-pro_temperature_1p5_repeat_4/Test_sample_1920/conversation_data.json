    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n\n**Question:** Let $d = 53599$. Find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Factor the conductor `d`:**\n    First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n    - Check for small prime divisors:\n        - $53599$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n        - $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$. So, $d = 7 \\times 7657$.\n        - Now, factor 7657. Let's try dividing by primes starting from 7.\n        - $7657 \\div 13 = 589$. So, $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 589$.\n        - Now, factor 589. The square root of 589 is approximately 24.2. We test primes up to 23.\n        - $589 \\div 19 = 31$. So, $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n    - The prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n    - We note that $d$ is a square-free integer.\n\n2.  **Understand Primitive Characters for a square-free conductor:**\n    A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $d$. Since $d = p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ is square-free, any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be written as:\n    $\\chi = \\chi_{7} \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where $\\chi_p$ is a character modulo the prime $p$.\n    For a square-free conductor $d$, the character $\\chi$ is *primitive* if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_p$ is primitive. For a prime modulus $p$, a character is primitive if and only if it is not the principal character (the trivial character that maps all values to 1). Therefore, each $\\chi_p$ must be a non-trivial character.\n\n3.  **Understand the Order of a Product Character:**\n    The order of the character $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31}))$.\n    We are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\n    So, $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\n4.  **Determine the possible orders for each component character:**\n    Let $o_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$. For the lcm to be 6, each $o_p$ must be a divisor of 6.\n    So, $o_p \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    From Step 2, we know that each $\\chi_p$ must be non-trivial, which means its order must be greater than 1. So, $o_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    Furthermore, the order of a character $\\chi_p$ must divide $\\phi(p) = p-1$. Let's check this condition for our primes:\n    - For $p=7$: $p-1 = 6$. The orders 2, 3, 6 are all divisors of 6.\n    - For $p=13$: $p-1 = 12$. The orders 2, 3, 6 are all divisors of 12.\n    - For $p=19$: $p-1 = 18$. The orders 2, 3, 6 are all divisors of 18.\n    - For $p=31$: $p-1 = 30$. The orders 2, 3, 6 are all divisors of 30.\n    Thus, for each prime factor $p$ of $d$, the order of $\\chi_p$ can be 2, 3, or 6.\n\n5.  **Count the number of component characters for each possible order:**\n    The number of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ having order $k$ (where $k$ divides $p-1$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n    - Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n    For each of the four primes ($7, 13, 19, 31$), these counts are the same.\n\n6.  **Calculate the total number of valid character combinations:**\n    We need to find the number of ways to choose the four characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n    Let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n    \n    *   **Total combinations where orders are in {2, 3, 6}:**\n        For each prime $p$, the number of possible non-trivial characters whose order divides 6 is the sum of the number of characters of order 2, 3, and 6.\n        Number of choices for each $\\chi_p$ = $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n        Since there are four primes, the total number of ways to choose a tuple of characters with orders from $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n    *   **Subtract combinations where the lcm is not 6:**\n        The total of 625 includes combinations where the lcm of orders is a proper divisor of 6, i.e., 2 or 3 (it cannot be 1 as all orders are > 1).\n        \n        *   **Case 1: lcm of orders is 2.**\n            This happens only if all component characters have an order that divides 2. Since the orders must be in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, this means all orders must be exactly 2.\n            For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2.\n            Number of such combinations = $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n        *   **Case 2: lcm of orders is 3.**\n            This happens only if all component characters have an order that divides 3. Since the orders must be in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$, this means all orders must be exactly 3.\n            For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3.\n            Number of such combinations = $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n    \n    *   **Final Calculation:**\n        The number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of combinations minus those where the lcm is not 6.\n        Number of characters = (Total combinations) - (Combinations with lcm 2) - (Combinations with lcm 3)\n        Number of characters = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\nFinal Answer Acquisition:\nThe analysis is complete. The steps logically lead to the final count.\n1. Factor conductor: $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n2. Condition for primitive character: $\\chi = \\prod \\chi_p$ with each $\\chi_p$ being non-trivial.\n3. Condition for order 6: $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)) = 6$.\n4. Possible orders for $\\chi_p$: $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ for all four primes.\n5. Count choices for each $\\chi_p$ with order in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$: $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$.\n6. Total combinations of such characters: $5^4 = 625$.\n7. Exclude combinations where lcm is a proper divisor of 6.\n    - lcm=2: requires all orders to be 2. Number of ways: $(\\phi(2))^4 = 1^4=1$.\n    - lcm=3: requires all orders to be 3. Number of ways: $(\\phi(3))^4 = 2^4=16$.\n8. Final answer: $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n<<<608>>>"
