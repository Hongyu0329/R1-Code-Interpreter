No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not radial, and for a physically accurate calculation of the magnetic helicity of Alfven Ion Cyclotron waves, it should not be treated as such. The correct procedure is to use the components of the wave's magnetic field that are perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field direction ($\mathbf{B}_0$), not the radial direction. Using components perpendicular to the radial direction is a simplifying approximation that is known to be inaccurate because the magnetic field at L1 follows the non-radial Parker Spiral. This approximation leads to a systematic underestimation of the true helicity.
