    "Answering this question involves two main parts: finding a lower bound for $c$ by constructing a valid set $A$, and proving that this is the best possible bound (the upper bound).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are looking for the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ with size $|A| \\approx cN$ where the sumset $A+A = \\{a_1 + a_2 : a_1, a_2 \\in A\\}$ contains no perfect squares. The notation $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ formalizes the asymptotic size of $A$, meaning $\\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{|A|}{N} = c$.\n\n### Step 2: Finding a Lower Bound for c\n\nWe can try to construct such a set $A$ by restricting its elements based on modular arithmetic. Let's consider the properties of square numbers modulo a small integer $m$.\n\n**Case 1: Modulo m=3**\nLet's analyze the squares modulo 3:\n*   $0^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$\n*   $1^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n*   $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$\n\nSo, any square number $k^2$ must be congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 3. A square number can never be congruent to 2 modulo 3.\n\nThis observation provides a powerful way to construct our set $A$. If we can ensure that every sum of two elements from $A$ is congruent to 2 modulo 3, then no such sum can be a square.\n\nLet's construct $A$ by only including numbers that are congruent to $r$ modulo 3. So, $A \\subseteq \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} : n \\equiv r \\pmod 3\\}$. For any two elements $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, their sum would be $a_1 + a_2 \\equiv r + r = 2r \\pmod 3$.\n\nWe need to choose $r$ such that $2r \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$.\n*   If $r=0$, $2r=0 \\pmod 3$. This can be a square residue.\n*   If $r=1$, $2r=2 \\pmod 3$. This can NOT be a square residue. This is a valid choice.\n*   If $r=2$, $2r=4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. This can be a square residue.\n\nSo, we must choose $r=1$. Let's define our set $A$ as:\n$A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\nExamples of elements in A are 1, 4, 7, 10, ...\n\nFor any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we have $a_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$ and $a_2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nTheir sum is $a_1 + a_2 \\equiv 1 + 1 = 2 \\pmod 3$.\nSince no square is congruent to 2 modulo 3, $a_1+a_2$ can never be a square number.\n\nNow let's find the size of this set $A$. The numbers are $1, 4, \\dots, 3k+1 \\le N$. The number of such elements is approximately $N/3$. More formally, $|A| = \\lfloor \\frac{N-1}{3} \\rfloor + 1 = \\frac{N}{3} + O(1)$.\nThe density of this set is $c = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{|A|}{N} = 1/3$.\n\nThis construction proves that there exists a set with density $1/3$ that satisfies the condition. Therefore, the largest possible value of $c$ must be at least $1/3$. So, $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nWe could also try other moduli. For example, modulo 4, squares are 0 and 1. We would need $2r \\equiv 2$ or $3 \\pmod 4$. For $r=1$, $2r=2$, giving the set of numbers $\\{n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\}$, with density $1/4$. For $r=3$, $2r=6 \\equiv 2$, giving $\\{n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4\\}$, density $1/4$. Both are smaller than $1/3$. The modulo 3 argument gives the best lower bound from this simple construction method.\n\n### Step 3: Proving the Upper Bound\n\nThe second part is to show that we cannot do better, i.e., $c \\le 1/3$.\nThis is a more complex part of the problem and is a known result in additive combinatorics. Proving it from first principles is significantly more involved than finding the lower bound. Here's a sketch of the argument:\n\n1.  Let $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ be a set such that $A+A$ is square-free, and assume its density $c = |A|/N$ is greater than $1/3$. So $|A| = (1/3 + \\epsilon)N$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$ and sufficiently large $N$.\n\n2.  We partition the set $A$ based on the residues modulo 3:\n    *   $A_0 = \\{a \\in A : a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3\\}$\n    *   $A_1 = \\{a \\in A : a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$\n    *   $A_2 = \\{a \\in A : a \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$\n    The total size is $|A| = |A_0| + |A_1| + |A_2|$.\n\n3.  The condition on $A+A$ being square-free imposes constraints on the sums of elements from these partitions:\n    *   Sums from $A_1+A_1$ are $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. They can never be squares.\n    *   Sums from $A_0+A_2$ are $\\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. They can never be squares.\n    *   Sums from $A_0+A_0$ are $\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. They must avoid squares of the form $(3k)^2 = 9k^2$.\n    *   Sums from $A_2+A_2$ are $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. They must avoid squares of the form $(3k \\pm 1)^2$.\n    *   Sums from $A_0+A_1$ are $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. They must also avoid squares.\n    *   Sums from $A_1+A_2$ are $\\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$. They must also avoid squares.\n\n4.  Since the density of $A$ is greater than $1/3$, $A$ cannot solely consist of elements from $A_1$. Thus, at least one of $A_0$ or $A_2$ must contain a significant number of elements.\n\n5.  Advanced results in additive number theory, such as Sárközy's theorem and its extensions, state that a sufficiently dense set of integers must contain certain arithmetic structures. For example, if a set $B$ has positive density, then the equation $x+y=k^2$ has solutions with $x,y \\in B$.\n    Applying these theorems to the sets $A_0$, $A_1$, $A_2$ (and their sumsets) shows that if their densities are too high, they are guaranteed to form a sum that is a square.\n\n6.  A careful analysis shows that maintaining the square-free sumset condition for all the pairs ($A_0+A_0$, $A_2+A_2$, etc.) forces the total density of $A$ to be no more than $1/3$. If we try to make $|A|$ larger than $N/3$, we are forced to populate $A_0$ or $A_2$ which leads to the formation of a square in $A+A$.\n\nThis establishes that $c \\le 1/3$.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, we have $c \\ge 1/3$ and $c \\le 1/3$. This forces the value of $c$ to be exactly $1/3$.\n\nThe largest number $c$ is $1/3$.\n\n<<<1/3>>>"
