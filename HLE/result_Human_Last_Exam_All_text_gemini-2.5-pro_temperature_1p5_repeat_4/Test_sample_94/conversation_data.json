    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for a specific person with several identifying characteristics:\n1.  **Profession:** A physicist.\n2.  **Primary Field:** Better known for work in microscopy.\n3.  **Discovery:** An optical effect related to real imagery.\n4.  **Origin of Discovery:** It was first observed by accident by a custodial worker.\n5.  **Equipment Involved:** The worker was cleaning concave mirrors.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Clues**\n*   **\"Physicist\" and \"Microscopy\":** This points to someone who applied physics principles to improve microscopes. This narrows the field to figures like Ernst Abbe (known for the diffraction limit) or Frits Zernike (known for phase-contrast microscopy), among others.\n*   **\"Concave mirrors\" and \"Custodial worker\":** This is the most specific and unusual detail. It describes a unique historical anecdote that is likely tied to only one specific discovery. This clue is the key to solving the puzzle.\n*   **\"Optical effect in real imagery\":** This confirms we are looking for a discovery in classical optics, not electron or scanning probe microscopy.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Potential Candidates Based on the Clues**\n*   **Ernst Abbe:** His work on the diffraction limit was highly theoretical and mathematical. There is no famous story involving a custodial worker in his discoveries.\n*   **Antonie van Leeuwenhoek / Robert Hooke:** They were pioneers, but the specific story about a concave mirror and a janitor is not associated with them.\n*   **Frits Zernike:** He was a Dutch physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953. His major contribution was the invention of the **phase-contrast microscope**. This fits the \"physicist known for microscopy\" clue. Now, let's check the anecdote.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Anecdote to the Correct Physicist**\nThe famous story behind the discovery of phase contrast perfectly matches the question's details.\n*   Frits Zernike was experimenting with diffraction gratings and using a telescope with a **concave mirror** to examine the results.\n*   He noticed faint, secondary \"ghost\" images created by imperfections in the grating.\n*   The story reports that a **custodial worker (janitor)** was cleaning the laboratory and either breathed on the concave mirror or blew dust from it.\n*   This act of condensation or dusting momentarily altered the reflective surface of the mirror, which accidentally changed the phase of the reflected light.\n*   When this happened, the faint, previously invisible ghost images became sharply and clearly visible.\n*   This accidental observation gave Zernike the crucial insight: by systematically shifting the phase of light, one could make transparent objects (like living cells, which are phase objects) visible under a microscope. This led to his invention of the phase-contrast microscope.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nAll the points in the question align perfectly with Frits Zernike.\n*   He was a physicist.\n*   He is best known for his contribution to microscopy (the phase-contrast microscope).\n*   He discovered the optical effect of phase contrast.\n*   The key insight was triggered by an accidental observation involving a custodial worker and a concave mirror.\n\nTherefore, the physicist in question is Frits Zernike.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
