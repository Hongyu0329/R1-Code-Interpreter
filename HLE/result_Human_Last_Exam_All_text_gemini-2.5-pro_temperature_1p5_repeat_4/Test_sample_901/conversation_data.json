    "This problem requires an analysis of an E2 elimination reaction on a substituted cyclohexane. The outcome of the reaction is determined by both stereochemistry (the arrangement of atoms in space) and regiochemistry (which of the possible products is formed).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide and a strong base strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Stereochemistry of the Substrate:**\n    *   The key stereochemical requirement for an E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring is that the leaving group (Br) and the proton being removed (a beta-proton) must be **trans-diaxial**. This means they must both be in axial positions on adjacent carbons, with one pointing up and the other down.\n    *   First, we determine the relative orientation of the substituents in (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. A careful assignment of R/S configurations reveals this to be the **cis** isomer (both groups can be drawn as wedges or dashes on a planar ring).\n    *   A cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane exists as an equilibrium of two chair conformations: one with an (axial, equatorial) arrangement and the other with an (equatorial, axial) arrangement.\n    *   The methyl group is sterically bulkier than the bromine atom. Therefore, the most stable conformation will be the one where the larger methyl group occupies the more spacious equatorial position.\n    *   This most stable conformation has the **bromine atom in the axial position** and the **methyl group in the equatorial position**. We can confirm that this (1a, 2e) conformation corresponds to the (1S, 2R) configuration.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Possible Elimination Pathways:**\n    *   The reaction proceeds from the most stable conformer, which conveniently has the leaving group (Br) in an axial position, a prerequisite for the E2 reaction.\n    *   We now look for beta-protons that are anti-periplanar (i.e., trans-diaxial) to the axial bromine. There are two adjacent carbons (beta-carbons): C2 and C6.\n    *   **Proton on C2:** The methyl group is equatorial, which means the proton on C2 is axial. This axial proton is trans-diaxial to the axial bromine on C1. Thus, elimination is stereochemically allowed. This pathway would lead to **1-methylcyclohexene**, the more substituted alkene (Zaitsev product).\n    *   **Proton on C6:** Carbon C6 has two protons, one axial and one equatorial. The axial proton on C6 is trans-diaxial to the axial bromine on C1. Thus, elimination is also stereochemically allowed on this side. This pathway would lead to **3-methylcyclohexene**, the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product).\n\n4.  **Determine the Major Product (Regioselectivity):**\n    *   Since there are two stereochemically possible elimination pathways, the major product is determined by the nature of the base.\n    *   The base is potassium tert-butoxide, which is very bulky. Sterically hindered bases have difficulty accessing hindered protons.\n    *   The axial proton on C2 is sterically hindered by the adjacent equatorial methyl group.\n    *   The axial proton on C6 is part of a -CH2- group and is much more sterically accessible.\n    *   The bulky t-butoxide base will preferentially remove the less hindered proton from C6.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction favors the formation of the Hofmann product over the Zaitsev product.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The major product of the reaction between (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide is the Hofmann elimination product, which is formed by removing a proton from C6.\n\nThe name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
