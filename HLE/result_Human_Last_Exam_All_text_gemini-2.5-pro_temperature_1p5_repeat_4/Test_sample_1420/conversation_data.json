    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Theoretical Framework**\n\nThe question asks for the specific heat scaling exponent, α, within the framework of the renormalization group (RG) theory, using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. This method is used to study critical phenomena near a continuous phase transition.\n\n*   **Specific Heat Scaling:** Near the critical temperature T_c, the singular part of the specific heat, C, scales with the reduced temperature, t = (T - T_c) / T_c, as C ∝ |t|⁻ᵃ. The exponent α is a universal critical exponent.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** This is the spatial dimension at and above which the critical exponents take on their simple, classical mean-field theory values. For systems described by the φ⁴ theory (which includes the Ising, XY, and Heisenberg universality classes), the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. Above this dimension, fluctuations are not strong enough to alter the mean-field behavior.\n*   **Epsilon (ϵ) Expansion:** This is a perturbative technique developed by Wilson and Fisher to calculate critical exponents for dimensions d < d_c. The calculation is performed as a power series in the small parameter ϵ = d_c - d.\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Parameters for the Specific Problem**\n\n*   **Spatial Dimension (d):** The problem specifies d = 3.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** As established, for this class of problems, d_c = 4.\n*   **Expansion Parameter (ϵ):** We can now calculate ϵ.\n    ϵ = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\n**Careful Point:** The epsilon expansion is technically an expansion for small ϵ. Here, we are applying it for ϵ = 1, which is not small. This is a common practice, and while it doesn't guarantee high precision, it provides a first reasonable estimate beyond mean-field theory. The leading-order term is usually what is expected in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n\n### **Step 3: Use Scaling Relations and RG Results**\n\nThe critical exponents are not all independent; they are connected by scaling relations. A key one is the **hyperscaling relation**:\n\nα = 2 - dν\n\nwhere ν is the critical exponent for the correlation length (ξ ∝ |t|⁻ᵛ).\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to use the actual dimension d = d_c - ϵ in the scaling relation, not d_c. So, we will use **α = 2 - (4 - ϵ)ν**.\n\nThe next step is to use the result for the exponent ν from the ϵ-expansion. The exponent ν is calculated directly from the RG flow equations. To first order in ϵ, for the general n-component vector model (or φ⁴ theory with an n-component field), the result is:\n\nν = (1/2) + [(n+2) / (4(n+8))]ϵ + O(ϵ²)\n\n### **Step 4: Derive the Expression for α**\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for ν into the hyperscaling relation.\n\nα = 2 - (4 - ϵ)ν\nα = 2 - (4 - ϵ) * [ (1/2) + ((n+2) / (4(n+8)))ϵ + O(ϵ²) ]\n\nWe expand this product and keep terms up to the first order in ϵ:\n\nα = 2 - [ 4 * (1/2) + 4 * ((n+2) / (4(n+8)))ϵ - ϵ * (1/2) + O(ϵ²) ]\nα = 2 - [ 2 + ((n+2) / (n+8))ϵ - (1/2)ϵ + O(ϵ²) ]\nα = - [ ((n+2) / (n+8)) - (1/2) ]ϵ + O(ϵ²)\n\nNow, simplify the term in the brackets:\n\nα = - [ (2(n+2) - 1(n+8)) / (2(n+8)) ]ϵ + O(ϵ²)\nα = - [ (2n + 4 - n - 8) / (2(n+8)) ]ϵ + O(ϵ²)\nα = - [ (n - 4) / (2(n+8)) ]ϵ + O(ϵ²)\nα = [ (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) ]ϵ + O(ϵ²)\n\n### **Step 5: Specialize to the Correct Universality Class and Calculate the Final Value**\n\nThe problem does not specify the number of components 'n' of the order parameter. In the absence of this information, the most standard and simplest case is assumed: the Ising universality class, where the order parameter is a scalar.\n\n*   For the Ising model: **n = 1**.\n\nSubstitute n = 1 into the expression for α:\n\nα = [ (4 - 1) / (2(1+8)) ]ϵ + O(ϵ²)\nα = [ 3 / (2 * 9) ]ϵ + O(ϵ²)\nα = [ 3 / 18 ]ϵ + O(ϵ²)\nα = (1/6)ϵ + O(ϵ²)\n\nFinally, substitute the value ϵ = 1 (for d = 3):\n\nα ≈ (1/6) * 1\nα = 1/6\n\n**Final Check:**\n*   The mean-field value for α is 0 (corresponding to ϵ = 0), which our formula correctly gives.\n*   For the 3D Ising model, the accepted numerical/experimental value for α is approximately 0.110. Our result, α = 1/6 ≈ 0.167, is a well-known first-order approximation from the ϵ-expansion. The difference is expected since ϵ=1 is not small.\n\nThe step-by-step analysis leads to the result that the scaling exponent α, to first order in the epsilon expansion for a 3D system in the Ising universality class, is 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
