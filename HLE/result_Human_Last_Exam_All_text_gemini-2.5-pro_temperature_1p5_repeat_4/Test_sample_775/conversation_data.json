    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Problem Statement\nLet `S` be the unit square, `S = [0, 1] x [0, 1]`.\nWe are given two sets, `A` and `B`, with the following properties:\n1.  `A` is a closed subset of the plane.\n2.  `B` is a closed subset of the plane.\n3.  `A` is connected.\n4.  `B` is connected.\n5.  `A U B = S`.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible number of connected components of the intersection `C = A ∩ B`.\n\n### 2. Initial Analysis and a Flawed Argument\nA first approach might involve the Mayer-Vietoris sequence from algebraic topology, which relates the homology groups (and thus the number of connected components) of `A`, `B`, `A U B`, and `A ∩ B`.\n\nThe sequence for the 0-th reduced homology group looks like:\n`... -> H_1(A U B) -> H_0(A ∩ B) -> H_0(A) ⊕ H_0(B) -> H_0(A U B) -> 0`\n\nLet `c(X)` denote the number of connected components of a space `X`. For the types of spaces we are considering, the rank of the 0-th homology group, `rank(H_0(X))`, is equal to `c(X)`.\nLet's substitute the known values:\n*   `A U B = S`. `S` is connected, so `c(S) = 1`.\n*   `A` is connected, so `c(A) = 1`.\n*   `B` is connected, so `c(B) = 1`.\n*   The unit square `S` is contractible, so its first homology group `H_1(S)` is trivial (`H_1(S) = 0`).\n*   Let `k = c(A ∩ B)` be the number we want to find.\n\nThe sequence of ranks becomes:\n`... -> 0 -> k -> 1 + 1 -> 1 -> 0`\n\nThis implies the existence of a short exact sequence:\n`0 -> Z^k -> Z ⊕ Z -> Z -> 0`\nFrom the rank-nullity theorem on this sequence, we find that the rank of `Z^k` must be `rank(Z ⊕ Z) - rank(Z) = 2 - 1 = 1`.\nThis would imply `k = 1`.\n\n**Crucial Point:** This argument is flawed. The standard Mayer-Vietoris sequence only holds for an \"excisive couple\", which for closed sets `A` and `B` requires that their interiors cover the union, i.e., `int(A) U int(B) = S`. This condition is not given in the problem and can be easily violated. For example, if `A` is the lower triangle of the square and `B` is the upper triangle, their intersection is the diagonal, which has an empty interior. `int(A) U int(B)` would be the square minus the diagonal, not the whole square. Thus, this argument is invalid.\n\n### 3. Argument via Embedding in the Sphere\nA more powerful tool is a more general version of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence that holds for any two closed sets `A'` and `B'` whose union is the sphere `S^2`.\n\n1.  We can view our square `S` as the northern hemisphere of `S^2`.\n2.  Let `A' = A` and `B' = B U (southern hemisphere)`.\n3.  `A'` and `B'` are closed sets whose union is `S^2`.\n4.  `A' = A` is given as connected.\n5.  `B'` is also connected. This is because `B` is connected, the southern hemisphere is connected, and their intersection is non-empty. The intersection `B ∩ (southern hemisphere)` corresponds to `B ∩ ∂S`, the part of `B` on the boundary of the square. Since `A U B = S` and `A` and `B` are closed, at least one of them must touch the boundary `∂S`. Let's assume `B` touches the boundary. Then `B'` is connected. (If `B` does not touch `∂S`, then `A` must contain all of `∂S`, so we can swap the roles of A and B).\n6.  The intersection is `C' = A' ∩ B' = A ∩ (B U southern_hemisphere) = (A ∩ B) U (A ∩ southern_hemisphere) = C U (A ∩ ∂S)`.\n\nNow, we can apply the sequence to `A'` and `B'` on `S^2`:\n`... -> H_1(S^2) -> H_0(C') -> H_0(A') ⊕ H_0(B') -> H_0(S^2) -> 0`\n\nSince `H_1(S^2) = 0`, this gives a short exact sequence, and as before, we deduce that `rank(H_0(C')) = 1`. This means `c(C') = 1`.\nSo, the set `C' = C U (A ∩ ∂S)` must be connected.\n\nThis provides a strong constraint: Each connected component of `C` must be connected to the set `A ∩ ∂S` via a path that lies entirely within `A`. By a symmetric argument (swapping A and B), each component of `C` must also be connected to `B ∩ ∂S` via a path in `B`.\n\n### 4. Constructive Approach and the Limit\nWhile the condition `c(C U (A ∩ ∂S)) = 1` is a strong constraint, it does not immediately give a finite number for `c(C)`. It is possible to construct examples where `c(C)` is any finite number `n`.\n\nImagine `n` small disjoint disks in the interior of the square. Their boundaries will be the `n` components of our intersection `C`. Let's call the region inside the disks \"land\" (`A`) and the region outside \"sea\" (`B`). To make all the land connected, we must build \"bridges\" between the islands. To make the sea connected, we might need to build \"canals\" or ensure the bridges don't cut it off. These constructions can become very intricate, resembling the \"Lakes of Wada\" phenomenon, where multiple disjoint open sets share a single, common boundary.\n\nSuch constructions show that for any integer `n`, one can construct sets `A` and `B` satisfying the conditions such that `A ∩ B` has `n` components. A similar construction can also produce a countably infinite number of components.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\nThe phrasing \"What is the largest number\" suggests a finite numerical answer. However, based on the known topological constructions (like the Lakes of Wada and similar examples), there is no finite upper bound on the number of components. For any integer `n`, it's possible to construct an example where the intersection has `n` components. Therefore, there is no \"largest number\".\n\nThe question may be intended as a trick question or is implicitly assuming some \"tameness\" condition on the sets `A` and `B` which is not stated (e.g., that they are polyhedra or submanifolds). Without such an assumption, we must conclude there is no finite maximum.\n\nSince the format requires a specific answer, this indicates a potential paradox in the question's premise. If a problem in this format must have a single numerical answer, there could be a deep, unstated convention or a theorem that applies which is not standard. However, within the realm of general topology, the answer is that the number is unbounded. As no finite number can be the \"largest,\" there is no such number.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, if we are forced to conclude based on the most rigorous argument that gives a *specific* number of components for *some* configuration (the sphere argument), it shows that `C U (A ∩ ∂S)` must have 1 component. This is a topological constraint but does not bound the number of components of `C` itself. As demonstrated by construction, this number can be arbitrarily large. There is no largest number.\n\nIf there were a hidden constraint forcing `A` and `B` to form an excisive couple, the answer would be 1. But this is not justified.\n\nSince constructions exist for any arbitrary `n`, there is no largest number. The problem is ill-posed if a finite numerical answer is expected. However, in some contexts, such a question is interpreted as asking whether the number of components is bounded or not. The answer is that it is not bounded.\n\nThere is no largest number.\n\n>>>There is no largest number."
