    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to Ming General Mu Sheng (Mộc Thạnh in Vietnamese) and his military campaigns in Vietnam. Mu Sheng was involved in two key periods of Ming intervention in Vietnam in the early 15th century:\n    *   The initial invasion to overthrow the Hồ dynasty (1406–1407).\n    *   The later campaigns to suppress the Lam Sơn Uprising led by Lê Lợi (1418–1427).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Mu Sheng's First Campaign (1406-1407):** In this initial campaign, Mu Sheng, alongside General Zhang Fu, led the Ming forces to a decisive victory. They successfully conquered Đại Ngu (Vietnam's name under the Hồ), captured the Hồ rulers, and established Ming rule. As this campaign was a success, Mu Sheng did not experience a \"major defeat\" during this time. Therefore, his defeat must have occurred during the later conflict.\n\n3.  **Focus on the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427):** This was a prolonged war of independence fought by the Vietnamese against Ming occupation. Mu Sheng was one of the Ming commanders tasked with crushing this rebellion. His most notable involvement was during the final Ming offensive in 1427.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Decisive Battle of 1427:** In a final attempt to end the war, the Ming court dispatched two large armies into Vietnam.\n    *   The main army, led by General Liu Sheng (Liễu Thăng), advanced from the north.\n    *   A relief army, led by **Mu Sheng**, advanced from the southwest (from Yunnan).\n\n    The Vietnamese strategy, devised by Lê Lợi and Nguyễn Trãi, was to ambush and destroy Liu Sheng's main army first. This was achieved in the decisive Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang, where Liu Sheng was killed and his army annihilated.\n\n5.  **Analyze Mu Sheng's Defeat:** Upon learning of the catastrophic destruction of Liu Sheng's army, Mu Sheng's forces, which were advancing towards the Red River Delta, were struck with panic. Mu Sheng immediately ordered a retreat back to Yunnan. The Vietnamese forces, however, did not allow a clean escape.\n\n6.  **Identify the Location of the Retreat and Defeat:** The Vietnamese commanders Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả were tasked with pursuing Mu Sheng's retreating army. They caught up with the Ming forces as they tried to cross the Red River (Sông Thao) and Clear River (Sông Lô). The pursuit culminated in attacks at strategic points named **Lãnh Câu** and **Khâu Ôn**. Here, Mu Sheng's army was routed, suffering heavy casualties and being forced to abandon vast amounts of weapons, supplies, and pack animals to flee for their lives. This rout in 1427 was Mu Sheng's first major and humiliating defeat in Vietnam.\n\n7.  **Connect Historical Locations to a Modern Province:** Historical and geographical research places the sites of Lãnh Câu and Khâu Ôn, where the decisive pursuit and rout occurred, within the territory of modern-day **Yên Bái Province**. This province lies along the traditional retreat path up the Red River valley from the delta towards Yunnan, China.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Distinguishing between two campaigns:** It's crucial to differentiate Mu Sheng's successful 1406-1407 campaign from his failed 1427 campaign. The defeat occurred in the latter.\n*   **Role in the 1427 campaign:** Mu Sheng was not defeated in a pitched head-on battle but was routed during a retreat after his fellow general's army was destroyed. However, this was still a major military defeat as his army was shattered as a fighting force.\n*   **Geographical accuracy:** Linking the historical names of battle sites like Khâu Ôn and Lãnh Câu to their modern provincial location is the final key step. These locations are historically associated with the mountainous region of Yên Bái along the Red River.\n\n<<<Yên Bái Province>>>"
