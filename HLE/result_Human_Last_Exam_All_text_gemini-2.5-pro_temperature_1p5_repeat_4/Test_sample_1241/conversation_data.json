    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nThe problem provides a system of Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, which are linear ordinary differential equations describing the probabilities $P_i(t)$ of a system being in state $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ at time $t$. This represents a continuous-time Markov chain. The goal is to find the value of $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$, which is the sum of the steady-state probabilities for states 0 and 1.\n\n**2. Formulate the Steady-State Equations**\nIn the steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ approach constant values, which we denote by $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. At this point, the rate of change of each probability is zero, so $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. The system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations, also known as the balance equations.\n\nThe given system of equations is:\n$$ P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t) $$\n$$ P_{1}'(t) = \\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) $$\n$$ P_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t) $$\n$$ P_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) $$\nAnd the conservation of probability:\n$$ P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1 $$\n\nSetting the derivatives to zero, we get the steady-state equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\n**3. Substitute the Numerical Values**\nThe given transition rates are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\nSubstitute these values into the steady-state equations:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 \\pi_0 + 0.65 \\pi_1 \\implies 0.019 \\pi_0 = 0.65 \\pi_1$\n2.  (We can skip this equation as the first four are linearly dependent, and we will use the simpler ones.)\n3.  $0 = 0.4 \\pi_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) \\pi_2 \\implies 0.4 \\pi_1 = 0.4 \\pi_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 \\pi_2 - 0.008 \\pi_3 \\implies 0.008 \\pi_2 = 0.008 \\pi_3$\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\n**Careful point:** The system of balance equations (1-4) is linearly dependent. Summing them up yields 0 = 0. Therefore, to find a unique solution for the probabilities, we must use the normalization condition (equation 5) in conjunction with any three independent equations from the set {1, 2, 3, 4}. We choose the simplest ones: 1, 3, and 4.\n\n**4. Solve the System of Linear Equations**\nWe will express $\\pi_0$, $\\pi_2$, and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 \\pi_1 = 0.4 \\pi_2 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\pi_1$\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 \\pi_2 = 0.008 \\pi_3 \\implies \\pi_3 = \\pi_2$\nCombining these, we get a key simplification: $\\pi_1 = \\pi_2 = \\pi_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 \\pi_0 = 0.65 \\pi_1 \\implies \\pi_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1$\n\nNow, substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1) + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) \\pi_1 = 1$\n\n**Careful point:** Perform the algebraic operations carefully.\n$(\\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019}) \\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019}) \\pi_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.707}{0.019}) \\pi_1 = 1$\nSo, we can solve for $\\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the sum $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = \\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\nUsing the expressions we found:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = (\\frac{0.65}{0.019} \\pi_1) + \\pi_1$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = (\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1) \\pi_1$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = (\\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.019}) \\pi_1$\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = (\\frac{0.669}{0.019}) \\pi_1$\n\nNow, substitute the value we found for $\\pi_1$:\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = (\\frac{0.669}{0.019}) \\times (\\frac{0.019}{0.707})$\n\nThe term $0.019$ cancels out, simplifying the calculation significantly.\n$\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\n\nFinally, compute the numerical value:\n$\\frac{0.669}{0.707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nRounding to six decimal places, the result is 0.946252."
