    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initialization (Step 1)**\n    *   `i := 0;`: This is a simple assignment operation. It takes constant time, which we denote as O(1).\n    *   `x := n;`: Another assignment operation, taking O(1) time.\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: This is an integer division. Assuming that `n` and `c` are of a size that fits within a standard machine word, this operation takes constant time, O(1).\n    *   `a_{0} := x — qc;`: This involves one multiplication and one subtraction. These are also considered basic arithmetic operations and take constant time, O(1).\n    *   **Conclusion for Step 1:** The entire initialization block consists of a fixed number of constant-time operations. Therefore, the time complexity of Step 1 is O(1).\n\n2.  **Analyze the `while` loop (Step 2)**\n    To find the complexity of the loop, we need to determine two things:\n    a) The cost of a single iteration of the loop.\n    b) The total number of times the loop will execute.\n\n    **a) Cost of a single iteration (Step 2.1)**\n    *   `i := i + 1;`: An increment operation, O(1).\n    *   `x := q;`: An assignment operation, O(1).\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;`: An integer division, O(1).\n    *   `a_{i} := x — qc;`: A multiplication and a subtraction, O(1).\n    *   **Conclusion for one iteration:** The body of the `while` loop consists of a fixed number of constant-time operations. Thus, each iteration of the loop takes O(1) time.\n\n    **b) Number of loop iterations**\n    *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. The value of `q` is what drives the loop.\n    *   Let's trace the value of the variable `q` that is tested in the `while` condition.\n    *   Before the first iteration, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   At the end of the first iteration, `x` becomes the old `q`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    *   At the end of the second iteration, the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c²⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c³⌋`.\n    *   After `k` iterations, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`.\n    *   This condition is met when `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, which can be rewritten as `n < c^(k+1)`.\n    *   Taking the logarithm to the base `c` on both sides gives `log_c(n) < k+1`, or `k > log_c(n) - 1`.\n    *   This means the number of iterations `k` is approximately `log_c(n)`. More formally, the number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋` for most cases. This is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n    *   **Conclusion for the number of iterations:** The loop runs a number of times that is proportional to the logarithm of `n` to the base `c`. So, the number of iterations is O(log_c(n)).\n\n    **Total time for the loop**\n    *   The total time for the `while` loop is (Number of iterations) × (Time per iteration).\n    *   Total loop time = O(log_c(n)) × O(1) = O(log_c(n)).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Return (Step 3)**\n    *   `return ($(a_{i}a_{i - 1}, …, a_{1}  a_{0})$)`: Returning the computed sequence of digits is typically an O(1) operation, as it just passes a reference to the result.\n\n4.  **Overall Computational Time Complexity**\n    *   The total time complexity of the algorithm is the sum of the complexities of its parts:\n        *   T(n) = Time(Step 1) + Time(Step 2) + Time(Step 3)\n        *   T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(1)\n        *   T(n) = O(log_c(n))\n\n    *   Using the change of base formula for logarithms, `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c ≥ 2` is a constant, `log(c)` is also a constant. In Big-O notation, we can ignore constant factors. Therefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Model of Computation:** The analysis relies on the standard Random Access Machine (RAM) model, where basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on numbers that fit in a machine word are assumed to take constant time, O(1).\n*   **Input Size vs. Input Value:** The complexity is expressed in terms of the value of the input `n`, not the size of the input (i.e., the number of bits required to represent `n`, which is `O(log n)`). The number of operations is a function of the magnitude of `n`.\n*   **Logarithm Base:** While `O(log_c n)` is the most precise answer based on the operations, it's standard practice in complexity theory to omit the constant base of the logarithm, making `O(log n)` a correct and common representation.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop. The variable `q` is divided by the base `c` in each iteration. This repeated division means the loop executes approximately `log_c(n)` times. Since each iteration takes constant time O(1), the total time complexity is O(log_c(n)).\n\n<<<O(log_c n)>>>"
