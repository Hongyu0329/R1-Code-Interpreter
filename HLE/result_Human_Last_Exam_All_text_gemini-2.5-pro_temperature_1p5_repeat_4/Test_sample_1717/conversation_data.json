    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Determine the Base Health:**\n    First, we need the starting health value for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode before any multiplayer scaling is applied. According to the game's code, the base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode (for a single player) is **3,640**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Health Scaling Formula:**\n    In Terraria's Expert Mode, boss health increases for each player present in the world. The health scaling formula is based on adding a percentage of health for each player after the first.\n    *   The health increase per additional player in Expert Mode is **35%**.\n    *   The formula can be written as:\n        `Total Health = Base Health × (1 + 0.35 × (Number of Players - 1))`\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula to the Eye of Cthulhu:**\n    We can plug the Eye of Cthulhu's base health into this formula, where `N` represents the number of players:\n    `Total Health = 3,640 × (1 + 0.35 × (N - 1))`\n    To better understand its behavior, we can simplify this expression:\n    `Total Health = 3,640 × (1 + 0.35N - 0.35)`\n    `Total Health = 3,640 × (0.65 + 0.35N)`\n    `Total Health = (3,640 × 0.65) + (3,640 × 0.35)N`\n    `Total Health = 2,366 + 1,274N`\n\n4.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. We must evaluate the limit of our simplified formula as `N` approaches infinity.\n    `lim (N→∞) [2,366 + 1,274N]`\n    As `N` grows infinitely large, the `1,274N` term also grows infinitely large, making the constant `2,366` irrelevant. Mathematically, the result is **infinity**.\n\n5.  **Consider Source Code Limitations:**\n    This is the most crucial step. The question specifically states \"According to the source code...\". This means we cannot just rely on the pure mathematical formula; we must consider the technical constraints of the game's engine.\n    *   In Terraria's source code (which is written in C#), an NPC's health (`life` and `lifeMax`) is stored in a 32-bit signed integer variable (`int`).\n    *   A 32-bit signed integer has a fixed maximum value. This value is 2³¹ - 1.\n    *   Therefore, the highest number that the game can possibly assign to the boss's health is **2,147,483,647**.\n    *   While our formula `2,366 + 1,274N` would eventually calculate a value far beyond this limit with enough players, the game engine cannot store a number higher than the integer's maximum value. The health would be capped at this limit.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe multiplayer health scaling formula indicates that health should increase indefinitely with the number of players. However, due to the technical limitations of the data type used to store health in Terraria's source code, the value is capped at the maximum possible value for a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
