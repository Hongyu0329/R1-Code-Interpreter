    "An elegant problem in convex geometry, let's analyze it step-by-step to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Condition**\n\nWe are looking for a convex domain, let's call it `K`, in the xy-plane. The crucial condition is that `K` must intersect every line `L` given by an equation of the form `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\nFor a convex set `K` to intersect a line `L`, it means `K` cannot lie entirely in either of the two open half-planes defined by `L`.\nLet `v` be the vector `(p, q)`. The line equation is `<x, v> = 1`, where `x = (x, y)`.\nThe intersection condition means that for any `v = (p, q)` with `gcd(p, q) = 1`:\n`sup_{x ∈ K} <x, v> ≥ 1` and `inf_{x ∈ K} <x, v> ≤ 1`\n\n**2. Deriving Constraints on the Domain's Dimensions**\n\nThe condition must hold for all valid pairs `(p, q)`. We can deduce fundamental properties of `K` by testing some of the simplest pairs.\n\n*   **Case 1: `(p, q) = (1, 0)`**\n    *   `gcd(1, 0) = 1`. The line is `x = 1`.\n    *   The condition implies `sup_{ (x,y)∈K } x ≥ 1` and `inf_{ (x,y)∈K } x ≤ 1`.\n\n*   **Case 2: `(p, q) = (-1, 0)`**\n    *   `gcd(-1, 0) = 1`. The line is `-x = 1`.\n    *   The condition implies `sup(-x) ≥ 1` and `inf(-x) ≤ 1`.\n    *   Using the properties `sup(-f) = -inf(f)` and `inf(-f) = -sup(f)`, this is equivalent to `inf(x) ≤ -1` and `sup(x) ≥ -1`.\n\n*   **Combining these two cases:** We must satisfy `sup(x) ≥ 1` and `inf(x) ≤ -1`. This means the \"width\" of the convex domain `K` in the x-direction, `w_x = sup(x) - inf(x)`, must be at least `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   `w_x ≥ 2`\n\n*   **Case 3 & 4: `(p, q) = (0, 1)` and `(0, -1)`**\n    *   A similar argument for the lines `y = 1` and `y = -1` leads to the conclusion that `sup(y) ≥ 1` and `inf(y) ≤ -1`.\n    *   This means the width of `K` in the y-direction, `w_y`, must also be at least 2.\n    *   `w_y ≥ 2`\n\n**3. Establishing a Lower Bound for the Area**\n\nWe now know that any valid convex domain `K` must have an x-width of at least 2 and a y-width of at least 2. We can use this to find a lower bound for its area.\n\nA well-known theorem in convex geometry states that the area of any convex body `K` is at least half the area of any of its bounding rectangles. Let `R_K` be the smallest bounding rectangle for `K` that is aligned with the coordinate axes. The dimensions of `R_K` are precisely the widths `w_x` and `w_y`.\n`Area(R_K) = w_x * w_y`\nThe theorem gives us:\n`Area(K) ≥ (1/2) * Area(R_K) = (1/2) * w_x * w_y`\nUsing our derived minimum widths:\n`Area(K) ≥ (1/2) * 2 * 2 = 2`\nThis proves that the minimal area of any such convex domain cannot be less than 2.\n\n**4. Finding a Candidate Domain and Verifying**\n\nThe next step is to find if there exists a convex domain with an area of 2 that satisfies all the conditions. If we can find one, we will have proven that 2 is the minimum possible area.\n\nLet's consider the square domain `K_s` defined by the inequality:\n`|x| + |y| ≤ 1`\nThis is a square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at `(1, 0)`, `(0, 1)`, `(-1, 0)`, and `(0, -1)`.\n\n*   **Area of `K_s`**: This square can be seen as two triangles with base 2 and height 1, so its area is `2 * (1/2 * 2 * 1) = 2`. This matches our lower bound.\n\n*   **Verification of the condition**: Now, we must check if `K_s` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` where `p` and `q` are coprime. Let `v = (p, q)`. We need to check if `inf_{x ∈ K_s} <x, v> ≤ 1 ≤ sup_{x ∈ K_s} <x, v>`.\n    Since `K_s` is a polygon, the supremum and infimum of the linear function `px + qy` will occur at its vertices.\n    `sup_{x ∈ K_s} (px + qy) = max( p(1)+q(0), p(0)+q(1), p(-1)+q(0), p(0)+q(-1) )`\n    `sup_{x ∈ K_s} (px + qy) = max(p, q, -p, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`\n    Since `K_s` is symmetric about the origin, `inf = -sup`.\n    `inf_{x ∈ K_s} (px + qy) = -max(|p|, |q|)`\n    The condition becomes: `-max(|p|, |q|) ≤ 1 ≤ max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    The left part `(-max ≤ 1)` is always true since `max` is non-negative.\n    The right part is `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`. Let's check if this is true for all coprime integers `p` and `q`.\n    The pair `(p, q)` cannot be `(0, 0)` because `gcd(0, 0)` is not 1. So at least one of `p` or `q` is a non-zero integer. The absolute value of any non-zero integer is at least 1. Therefore, `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1` is always true for our set of lines.\n\nThe domain `K_s = {(x, y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1}` satisfies all the required conditions and has an area of 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have shown that the minimal area must be at least 2, and we have found a convex domain with an area of exactly 2 that satisfies the problem's conditions. Therefore, the minimal area is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
