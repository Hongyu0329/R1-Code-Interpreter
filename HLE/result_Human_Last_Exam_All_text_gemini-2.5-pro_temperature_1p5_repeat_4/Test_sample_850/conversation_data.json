    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Criterion for Optical Activity\nThe first and most crucial point is to understand the symmetry requirement for optical activity in a crystal.\n\n*   **Common Misconception:** Optical activity is often equated with chirality (the property of an object being non-superimposable on its mirror image). While this is true for molecules in a fluid, the condition for crystals is different.\n*   **Correct Requirement for Crystals:** Optical activity in a crystal is described by the gyration tensor ($g_{ij}$). This tensor is identically zero if and only if the crystal's point group symmetry includes a **center of inversion** (also known as a center of symmetry, denoted by $\\overline{1}$).\n*   **Conclusion:** Therefore, for a crystal to have the correct symmetry for optical activity, its point group must be **non-centrosymmetric** (i.e., it must lack a center of inversion). There are 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes out of the total 32.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Criterion for being \"Achiral\"\n*   **Definition:** A crystal class is achiral if its symmetry includes at least one improper rotation operation. Improper rotations are operations that convert a right-handed object into a left-handed one. These include:\n    *   A center of inversion ($\\overline{1}$)\n    *   A mirror plane (m)\n    *   A rotoinversion axis ($\\overline{3}$, $\\overline{4}$, $\\overline{6}$)\n*   **Careful Point:** Since we are only considering non-centrosymmetric classes (from Step 1), we can immediately exclude any class with a center of inversion ($\\overline{1}$). This means we are looking for non-centrosymmetric classes that contain a mirror plane (m), or a $\\overline{4}$, or a $\\overline{6}$ axis. (The $\\overline{3}$ axis is only present in centrosymmetric groups $\\overline{3}$ and $\\overline{3}$m).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Criterion for being \"Non-polar\"\n*   **Definition:** A crystal class is polar if there is at least one direction in the crystal (a polar axis) whose two ends are not equivalent under any symmetry operation of the point group. Such crystals exhibit pyroelectricity.\n*   **Identification:** There are 10 specific polar crystal classes: **1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm**.\n*   **Conclusion:** A crystal class is non-polar if it is not one of these 10 polar classes.\n\n### Step 4: Filtering the 32 Crystal Classes\n\nWe will now apply these three criteria sequentially to find the solution.\n\n1.  **Start with all 32 crystal classes.**\n2.  **Apply \"Optically Active\" (Non-centrosymmetric) filter:** We eliminate the 11 centrosymmetric classes ($\\overline{1}$, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, $\\overline{3}$, 6/m, 4/mmm, $\\overline{3}$m, 6/mmm, m$\\overline{3}$, m$\\overline{3}$m). This leaves us with the 21 non-centrosymmetric classes.\n    *   *Remaining (21 classes):* 1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, $\\overline{4}$, 422, 4mm, $\\overline{4}$2m, 3, 32, 3m, 6, $\\overline{6}$, 622, 6mm, $\\overline{6}$m2, 23, 432, $\\overline{4}$3m.\n\n3.  **Apply \"Achiral\" filter:** From the 21 classes above, we eliminate the ones that are chiral (those containing only proper rotation axes).\n    *   *Chiral classes to remove:* 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432.\n    *   *Remaining (10 classes):* These are the classes that are both non-centrosymmetric and achiral.\n        m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, **$\\overline{4}$**, **$\\overline{6}$**, **$\\overline{4}$2m**, **$\\overline{6}$m2**, **$\\overline{4}$3m**.\n\n4.  **Apply \"Non-polar\" filter:** From the 10 classes remaining, we eliminate those that are polar. The polar classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n    *   *Polar classes to remove from our list:* m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\n    *   *Final remaining classes:* The classes left after this final filter satisfy all three conditions.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity are:\n\n*   **$\\overline{4}$**\n*   **$\\overline{6}$**\n*   **$\\overline{4}$2m**\n*   **$\\overline{6}$m2**\n*   **$\\overline{4}$3m**\n\nThese five crystal classes meet all the specified criteria.\n\n<<<The five crystal classes are $\\overline{4}$, $\\overline{6}$, $\\overline{4}$2m, $\\overline{6}$m2, and $\\overline{4}$3m.>>>"
