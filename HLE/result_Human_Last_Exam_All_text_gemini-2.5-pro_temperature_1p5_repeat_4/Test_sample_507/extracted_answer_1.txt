Turkish and Malay are two languages from two distinct Asian cultures (West Asian and Southeast Asian) with no direct linguistic relationship. Yet, they have highly similar words for "broom", "mom", and "dad".

1.  **Dad:** Turkish: **Baba** / Malay: **Bapa** (These are nearly identical).
2.  **Mom:** Turkish: **Ana** (the root for "mother") / Malay: **Mama** (A common term for "mom"). Both are phonetically similar nursery words.
3.  **Broom:** Turkish: **Süpürge** / Malay: **Sapu**. Both words derive from a similar-sounding root (**s-p**) meaning "to sweep".
