    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is in turn attached to a nitrogen atom.\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: The nitrogen atom of the amide group is bonded to two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃). This group is -C(=O)N(Et)₂.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is located at the C3 position (meta) relative to the benzamide group (which is at C1).\n\nThe structure is a benzene ring with a -C(=O)N(Et)₂ group at position 1 and a -N(Me)₂ group at position 3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction Step (Lithiation)**\n*   **Reagents**: `sec-BuLi` (sec-butyllithium) and `TMEDA` (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine).\n*   **Solvent**: `THF` (tetrahydrofuran).\n*   **Reaction Type**: This set of reagents is used for a **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)**, also known as lithiation. `sec-BuLi` is a very strong base that removes an acidic proton. `TMEDA` is a chelating agent that coordinates to the lithium ion, increasing the basicity of the organolithium reagent and helping to direct the deprotonation.\n\n**Careful Points for Step 2:**\n*   **Identifying Directed Metalation Groups (DMGs)**: The starting material has two functional groups that can direct the lithiation by coordinating to the lithium ion:\n    1.  **N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) at C1**: The carbonyl oxygen is an excellent Lewis base. This is one of the most powerful DMGs. It directs lithiation to the adjacent *ortho* positions (C2 and C6).\n    2.  **Dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at C3**: The nitrogen lone pair can also coordinate to lithium. This is also a good DMG. It directs lithiation to its *ortho* positions (C2 and C4).\n\n*   **Determining Regioselectivity**: We need to determine which proton will be removed.\n    *   The -CONEt₂ group directs to C2 and C6.\n    *   The -NMe₂ group directs to C2 and C4.\n    *   The directing power of the carboxamide group is significantly stronger than the dimethylamino group.\n    *   However, in this case, both groups direct the lithiation to the **C2 position**. This is called a **cooperative or reinforcing effect**. The proton at C2 is therefore the most acidic aromatic proton and will be selectively removed by the strong base (`sec-BuLi`).\n\n*   **Intermediate Formation**: `sec-BuLi` abstracts the proton from C2, forming butane as a byproduct. A lithium atom replaces the proton, forming an aryllithium intermediate. The intermediate is the lithium salt of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide at the 2-position.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Alkylation)**\n*   **Reagent**: Methyl iodide (CH₃I).\n*   **Reaction Type**: The aryllithium intermediate formed in Step 1 is a potent nucleophile (a carbanion equivalent at C2). Methyl iodide is an electrophile. The reaction is a nucleophilic attack by the carbanion on the methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion (I⁻) in an Sₙ2-type reaction.\n\n**Careful Points for Step 3:**\n*   **Reaction Site**: The nucleophilic carbon is C2, where the lithium atom is located.\n*   **Group Added**: A methyl group (-CH₃) from methyl iodide will attach to the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Product**\nBy combining the results of the two steps, we start with N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide and add a methyl group at the C2 position.\n\n*   The parent structure remains the same (N,N-diethylbenzamide).\n*   The dimethylamino group remains at C3.\n*   A new methyl group is introduced at C2.\n\nThe name of the final product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Summary of Transformations:**\n1.  **Start**: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n2.  **Lithiation**: Selective deprotonation at C2 due to the cooperative directing effect of the -CONEt₂ and -NMe₂ groups.\n3.  **Alkylation**: The resulting aryllithium attacks methyl iodide to add a methyl group at C2.\n4.  **Final Product**: N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
