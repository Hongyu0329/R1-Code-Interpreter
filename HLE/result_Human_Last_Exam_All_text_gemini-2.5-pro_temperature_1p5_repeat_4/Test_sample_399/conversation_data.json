    "This is an initial value problem involving a first-order ordinary differential equation. We will solve it step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of differential equation and separate variables.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can write $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis is a separable differential equation because we can group all terms involving $x$ and $dx$ on one side, and all terms involving $t$ and $dt$ on the other side.\n\n**Careful point:** When we separate the variables, we divide by $x^2$. This is permissible only if $x(t) \\neq 0$. We see that $x(t)=0$ is a constant solution to the differential equation. However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, so the solution we are looking for is not the trivial solution $x(t)=0$. Thus, we can proceed with the separation.\n\nSeparating the variables gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n\n**Step 2: Integrate both sides.**\nWe integrate the left side with respect to $x$ and the right side with respect to $t$:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$ \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\n**Careful point:** A common mistake is to forget the constant of integration, $C$, or to make a sign error when integrating $\\frac{1}{x^2}$. The integral is $-x^{-1}$, not $x^{-1}$.\n\n**Step 3: Use the initial condition to find the constant C.**\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our integrated equation:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = C $$\n**Careful point:** Be careful with the signs. $-\\frac{1}{-8}$ simplifies to $+\\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n**Step 4: Write the particular solution.**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into the equation from Step 2:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**Step 5: Solve for x(1).**\nWe need to find the value of $x$ when $t=1$. We can substitute $t=1$ into the equation we just found:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo combine the fractions on the right side, we find a common denominator, which is 8:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{4}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = -\\frac{3}{8} $$\nNow, we can solve for $x(1)$ by multiplying both sides by -1 and then taking the reciprocal:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nAlternatively, we could have first solved for $x(t)$ explicitly:\nFrom $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$, we multiply by -1 to get $\\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}$.\nTaking the reciprocal gives $x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}}$.\nNow, substitute $t=1$:\n$x(1) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{1}{2} + 1 - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{8}} = \\frac{8}{3}$.\nThe result is the same.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
