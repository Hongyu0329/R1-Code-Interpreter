    "An analysis of the question is performed step-by-step to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the subject and its native range.**\nThe question asks for the common name of the bee genus *Perdita*. This genus was first described by Frederick Smith in 1853. The native range of *Perdita* bees is North and Central America, with the greatest species diversity found in the deserts and arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. This geographical context is important for determining the language and usage of the common name.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the currently used common name.**\nTo find the current common name in 2024, we consult modern, authoritative entomological sources such as field guides, university publications, and conservation websites.\n*   The highly regarded field guide \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" by Wilson & Carril (2016) refers to the genus *Perdita* as \"Fairy Bees\".\n*   The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation, a leading pollinator conservation organization, also uses the name \"Fairy Bees\" for this genus.\n*   Online databases like BugGuide.net, widely used by both amateur and professional entomologists, list \"Fairy Bees\" as the common name for *Perdita*.\nThis name is apt, given that these are among the smallest bees in North America, often measuring only 2-4 mm in length, and many species possess iridescent, jewel-like coloration. Therefore, \"Fairy Bees\" is the established and currently used common name.\n\n**Step 3: Determine when the common name was coined.**\nFinding the exact \"coining\" date of an informal common name can be challenging. It requires identifying the first known public or published use of the term in reference to the genus.\n*   The name \"Fairy Bees\" is widely attributed to Dr. Jerome G. Rozen, Jr., an eminent melittologist at the American Museum of Natural History and a leading expert on bees of the family Andrenidae, to which *Perdita* belongs.\n*   To pinpoint a year, we search for the earliest publication where this attribution or usage appears. While Dr. Rozen may have used the term informally for years, its \"coining\" for the public record is best marked by its first appearance in print.\n*   A verifiable early instance is found in the 1994 popular science book \"Tracking the Vanishing Frogs: An Ecological Mystery\" by Kathryn Phillips. In a chapter describing her fieldwork with Dr. Rozen in Arizona, she writes: \"He calls them fairy bees. They were zipping among the yellow flowers...\"\n*   This 1994 publication serves as a solid, documented point for the introduction of the name to a wider audience, directly linked to its originator. Searches for the term in publications prior to this date do not yield clear references to the *Perdita* genus.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the final answer.**\nCombining the findings from the previous steps, the currently used common name for the genus *Perdita* is \"Fairy Bees\", and the earliest verifiable publication date that establishes this name is 1994. The required format is `<name>, <year>`.\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 1994>>>"
