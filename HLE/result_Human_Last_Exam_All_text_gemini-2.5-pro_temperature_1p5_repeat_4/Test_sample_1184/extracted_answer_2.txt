Based on the analysis of the human Cav2.3 (alpha-1E subunit) and beta-1 subunit (isoform beta-1b, UniProt: P54283) interaction, the hotspot residues are as follows:

**1) Hotspots for Interaction with alpha-1 subunit (Physical Binding):**
These residues are located in the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain of the beta-1 subunit and form the Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP) that directly binds the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the alpha-1E subunit.

*   **Key Hydrophobic Pocket Residues:**
    *   Tyrosine 347 (Y347)
    *   Tryptophan 391 (W391)
    *   Isoleucine 403 (I403)
    *   Valine 467 (V467)
    *   Leucine 470 (L470)
    *   Leucine 477 (L477)
    *   Isoleucine 480 (I480)
*   **Key Polar Interaction Residues:**
    *   Tyrosine 468 (Y468)
    *   Glutamate 473 (E473)

**2) Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties (Gating Modulation):**
These are residues or regions that functionally influence the alpha-1E subunit's behavior, often without being part of the primary binding pocket.

*   **The N-Terminal Region (Residues ~1-70):** The entire N-terminus of the beta-1b isoform acts as a critical modulatory domain, primarily affecting the kinetics and voltage-dependence of channel inactivation.
*   **Allosteric Modulatory Surface on the GK Domain:** These residues are located on the surface of the GK domain, separate from the binding pocket, and are crucial for transducing the binding event into a functional change.
    *   Aspartate 366 (D366)
    *   Glutamate 368 (E368)
*   **The C-Terminal Region (Residues ~480-500):** This region, extending beyond the core GK fold, also contributes to the fine-tuning of channel gating properties.
