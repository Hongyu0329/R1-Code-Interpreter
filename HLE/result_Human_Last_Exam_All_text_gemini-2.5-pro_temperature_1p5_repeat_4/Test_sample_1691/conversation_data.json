    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to develop the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$.\n\nThe integral is given by\n$I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$.\nWe want to find an approximation for $I(\\epsilon)$ for small positive $\\epsilon$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the integrand**\nLet the denominator be $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + f(x)$, where $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$.\nThe parameter $\\epsilon$ is small and positive. The integration interval is $[0, 15.00]$.\nThe function $f(x)$ is a sum of positive terms for $x>0$, so $f(x)>0$ for $x>0$. At the lower limit of integration, $x=0$, we have $f(0)=0$.\nAs $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$, the term $\\epsilon+f(x)$ in the denominator approaches zero when $f(x)$ is close to zero. This occurs near $x=0$.\nConsequently, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + f(x)}$ becomes very large in the neighborhood of $x=0$. This means the main contribution to the value of the integral will come from this small region near $x=0$.\n\n**Step 2: Approximate the function f(x) for small x**\nNear $x=0$, the term with the lowest power of $x$ in the polynomial $f(x)$ will be dominant.\n$f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$\nFor $x \\ll 1$, we have $x^5 \\gg x^6 \\gg x^8$.\nSo, we can approximate $f(x)$ by its leading term:\n$f(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$ for small $x$.\n\n**Step 3: Approximate the integral**\nUsing the approximation for $f(x)$, the integral $I(\\epsilon)$ can be approximated as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\nThe integrand is large only when $9x^5$ is of the order of $\\epsilon$, which means $x \\sim (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5}$. Since $\\epsilon$ is small, this region is indeed close to $x=0$.\nFor $x$ far from this region, for instance at the upper limit $x=15$, the integrand is very small. The contribution from the part of the integral far from $x=0$ is negligible compared to the contribution from the region near $x=0$ where the integrand peaks.\nTherefore, we can extend the upper limit of integration to $\\infty$ without introducing a significant error in the leading-order asymptotic behavior. This simplifies the calculation.\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the approximate integral**\nLet's compute the integral $J(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$. (We'll use integers for the coefficients for simplicity in the derivation).\nWe perform a substitution to make the integral dimensionless. Let $9x^5 = \\epsilon u^5$.\nThis implies $x^5 = \\frac{\\epsilon}{9} u^5$, so $x = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} u$.\nThen, the differential is $dx = \\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du$.\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n$J(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u^5}$.\nWe can factor out $\\epsilon$ from the denominator:\n$J(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon}{9}\\right)^{1/5} du}{\\epsilon(1 + u^5)} = \\frac{\\epsilon^{1/5}}{9^{1/5}\\epsilon} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du$.\nSimplifying the power of $\\epsilon$:\n$J(\\epsilon) = \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{9^{1/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the constant definite integral**\nThe remaining integral is a standard form of the Beta function, given by the general formula:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+t^n} dt = \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$.\nFor our case, $n=5$, so the value of the integral is:\n$\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du = \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n**Step 6: Assemble the final analytical formula**\nNow we substitute the value of the integral back into our expression for $J(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx J(\\epsilon) = \\frac{\\epsilon^{-4/5}}{9^{1/5}} \\left( \\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)} \\right)$.\nCombining the constants, we get the final analytical formula for $I(\\epsilon)$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\nWriting the numerical values from the problem statement:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot (9.0)^{1/5.0} \\sin(\\pi/5.0)} \\epsilon^{-4.0/5.0}$.\nThis can also be written as:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{0.2} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-0.8}$.\n\nThis formula describes the leading-order asymptotic behavior of the integral as $\\epsilon \\to 0^+$. The integral diverges as $\\epsilon^{-0.8}$. The coefficient is a constant determined by the behavior of $f(x)$ near $x=0$.\n\nFinal formula:\nThe analytical formula that approximates $I(\\epsilon)$ for small $\\epsilon$ is $C \\epsilon^p$, where the exponent is $p = -4/5 = -0.8$ and the coefficient is $C = \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\n<<<I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}>>>"
