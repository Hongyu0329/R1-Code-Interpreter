    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Context: Finite-Temperature Field Theory**\n\n*   In finite-temperature field theory, we calculate thermal averages using a path integral formalism. The central object is the partition function, $Z$.\n*   The theory is formulated in Euclidean spacetime by performing a Wick rotation from real time $t$ to imaginary time $\\tau$ ($t \\to -i\\tau$).\n*   The imaginary time dimension is compactified and has a length $\\beta = 1/T$, where $T$ is the temperature.\n*   For a bosonic field, like the neutral scalar field $\\phi$, the field configurations $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$ must be periodic in imaginary time: $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\tau+\\beta, \\vec{x})$.\n\n**2. The Partition Function and the Euclidean Action**\n\n*   The partition function for a neutral scalar field $\\phi$ is given by the functional integral:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n*   Here, $S_E[\\phi]$ is the Euclidean action. For a free (non-interacting) neutral scalar field with mass $m$, the action is:\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E[\\phi]$\n    where the Euclidean Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_E$ is:\n    $\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{\\nabla} \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2$\n    The integral is over Euclidean spacetime, with $x = (\\tau, \\vec{x})$.\n\n**3. Defining the Inner Product and the Operator D**\n\n*   The notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ suggests an inner product. In the context of functional integrals, the inner product of two functions (or a function and an operator acting on a function) is defined by integrating their product over the relevant spacetime. For two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, the inner product is $(f,g) = \\int d^{d+1}x \\, f(x)g(x)$.\n*   The action $S_E[\\phi]$ is a quadratic form in the field $\\phi$. We can rewrite it to identify the operator $D$ (which we assume is what is meant by $D_\\phi$). We use integration by parts on the kinetic term:\n    $\\int d^{d+1}x \\, (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 = \\int d^{d+1}x \\, [ \\partial_\\mu(\\phi \\partial^\\mu \\phi) - \\phi (\\partial_\\mu \\partial^\\mu \\phi) ]$\n*   The first term is a total derivative. The integral of a total derivative over all space is zero if the fields vanish at the boundary. For the time dimension, the periodicity ensures the boundary terms at $\\tau=0$ and $\\tau=\\beta$ cancel. For the spatial dimensions, we assume the fields vanish at infinity.\n*   This leaves us with $\\int d^{d+1}x \\, (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 = - \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi (\\partial_\\mu \\partial^\\mu \\phi) = \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi (-\\Box_E) \\phi$, where $\\Box_E = \\partial_\\mu \\partial^\\mu = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2$ is the Euclidean d'Alembertian operator.\n*   Substituting this back into the action gives:\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{d+1}x \\, [ \\phi (-\\Box_E) \\phi + m^2 \\phi^2 ] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi(x) (-\\Box_E + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n*   This expression is of the form $\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$. By comparison, we can identify the operator $D$ as the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n    $D = -\\Box_E + m^2 = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2$\n\n**4. Calculating the Inner Product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$**\n\n*   Following our identification of the operator $D$, the expression $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is interpreted as $(\\phi, D\\phi)$.\n*   Using the definition of the inner product from Step 3:\n    $(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi(x) D \\phi(x) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) [ -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2 ] \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n*   This expression is exactly twice the free Euclidean action, $2S_{E, \\text{free}}[\\phi]$.\n*   We can also write this in a more explicit form by reversing the integration by parts performed earlier:\n    $(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\vec{\\nabla} \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Imaginary Time Formalism:** The entire calculation relies on the imaginary time formalism for finite-temperature field theory. Key features are the Euclidean action and the periodicity of bosonic fields in the imaginary time direction.\n2.  **Inner Product Definition:** The notation $(A, B)$ must be correctly interpreted as a spacetime integral $\\int d^{d+1}x \\, A(x)B(x)$.\n3.  **Operator Identification:** The operator $D$ is not given but must be inferred from the quadratic part of the action. It is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator, $-\\Box_E + m^2$.\n4.  **Integration by Parts:** This is the key mathematical tool used to move derivatives from one field to the other, which allows the identification of the operator $D$. The vanishing of boundary terms is crucial and is guaranteed by the physical assumptions (periodicity in $\\tau$, fields vanishing at spatial infinity).\n5.  **Notation:** The notation $D_\\phi$ in the question is slightly ambiguous. The standard convention implies an operator $D$ that is independent of $\\phi$ (for a free theory) acting on the field $\\phi$. So, we interpret $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ as $(\\phi, D\\phi)$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ for a free, neutral scalar field at finite temperature represents the quadratic form that appears in the exponent of the partition function's functional integral. It is explicitly given by the integral of the field $\\phi$ multiplied by the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator acting on $\\phi$.\n\nIn position space, this is:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) [ -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2 ] \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\nThis expression is equivalent to twice the free Euclidean action, $2S_E[\\phi]$. After performing an integration by parts, it can be written as:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\vec{\\nabla} \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$\n\nIn momentum space, using the Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n / \\beta$, the expression becomes:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^d k}{(2\\pi)^d} \\, |\\tilde{\\phi}(i\\omega_n, \\vec{k})|^2 (\\omega_n^2 + |\\vec{k}|^2 + m^2)$\n\n<<<The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, interpreted as $(\\phi, D\\phi)$, is given by the integral $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\phi(x) [ -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2 ] \\phi(x)$. This is equal to twice the free Euclidean action, $2S_{E, \\text{free}}$, and can also be written as $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d x \\, \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\vec{\\nabla} \\phi)^2 + m^2 \\phi^2 \\right]$.>>>"
