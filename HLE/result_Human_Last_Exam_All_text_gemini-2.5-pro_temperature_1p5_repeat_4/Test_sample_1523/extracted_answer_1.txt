The inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$, interpreted as $(\phi, D\phi)$, is given by the integral $\int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^d x \, \phi(x) [ -(\partial_\tau^2 + \nabla^2) + m^2 ] \phi(x)$. This is equal to twice the free Euclidean action, $2S_{E, \text{free}}$, and can also be written as $\int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^d x \, \left[ (\partial_\tau \phi)^2 + (\vec{\nabla} \phi)^2 + m^2 \phi^2 \right]$.
