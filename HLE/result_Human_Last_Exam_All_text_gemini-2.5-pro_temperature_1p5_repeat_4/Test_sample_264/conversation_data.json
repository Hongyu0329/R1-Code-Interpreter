    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the initial position of the first cube.**\nLet's place the first cube, C1, in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. We can define C1 as the region where `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`. This cube has a side length of 1 and its volume is `1³ = 1`. One vertex is at the origin (0,0,0) and the opposite vertex is at (1,1,1).\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the shift.**\nThe problem states that the second cube, C2, is shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal relative to the first cube.\n*   The **main diagonal** of C1 connects the vertex at the origin (0,0,0) to the opposite vertex at (1,1,1). The direction of this diagonal can be represented by the vector **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   A shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most naturally interpreted as a translation by a vector where each component along the axes is 1/2. This means the shift vector is **v** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n**Step 3: Define the position of the second cube.**\nThe second cube, C2, is simply the first cube, C1, translated by the shift vector **v**. To find the boundaries of C2, we add the components of **v** to the boundaries of C1.\n*   For the x-coordinate: `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n*   For the y-coordinate: `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n*   For the z-coordinate: `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  => `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\nSo, C2 is the region defined by `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the region of intersection.**\nThe volume of the intersection is the volume of the region where a point (x,y,z) belongs to both C1 and C2. We need to find the overlapping interval for each coordinate.\n*   **x-coordinate:** The region for C1 is `[0, 1]` and for C2 is `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`. The length of this interval is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n*   **y-coordinate:** Similarly, the region for C1 is `[0, 1]` and for C2 is `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`. The length of this interval is `1/2`.\n*   **z-coordinate:** Again, the region for C1 is `[0, 1]` and for C2 is `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`. The length of this interval is `1/2`.\n\nThe intersection of the two cubes is a smaller cube defined by `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`, `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the volume of the intersection.**\nThe intersection is a cube with a side length of 1/2. The volume of a cube is calculated as `(side length)³`.\nVolume of intersection = `(1/2)³ = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Coordinate System Setup:** Choosing a simple coordinate system for the first cube (e.g., `[0, 1]³`) greatly simplifies the problem.\n2.  **Interpretation of \"Shift along the main diagonal\":** This is the most critical point. The phrase can be ambiguous.\n    *   **Interpretation A (Component-wise shift):** The shift vector is `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. This means the cube is moved by 1/2 unit in each of the x, y, and z directions. This is the most common interpretation in such geometry problems and leads to a clean, rational answer.\n    *   **Interpretation B (Magnitude of shift):** The total displacement *distance* is 1/2. The length of the main diagonal vector (1,1,1) is `√3`. A shift vector with a magnitude of 1/2 in this direction would be `(1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3))`. This would result in a more complex, irrational answer. Given the context of typical math competition problems, Interpretation A is the intended one.\n3.  **Finding the Intersection Region:** The intersection of two cuboids is found by finding the intersection of their corresponding intervals along each axis. For intervals `[a, b]` and `[c, d]`, the intersection is `[max(a, c), min(b, d)]`.\n4.  **Final Shape:** It is important to recognize that the intersection of two axis-aligned cubes is also an axis-aligned cuboid (in this case, a cube).\n\nThe analysis consistently leads to the conclusion that the intersection is a cube of side length 1/2.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
