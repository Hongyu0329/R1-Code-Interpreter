    "This problem asks for the conditions under which a system of three functions has a \"tripled fixed point\". This is a concept from the field of fixed-point theory, and the conditions are typically established by generalizing the well-known Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\"**\n\nFirst, let's clarify the setup and define the term. We are given:\n*   Three non-empty sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z`.\n*   Three functions with specified domains and codomains. There appears to be a typo in the question (`G` is defined twice). We will assume the standard convention and rename the second `G` to `H`.\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z` (Corrected from `G: Z*Y*X → Z`)\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triplet of elements `(x, y, z)`, where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z`, that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**Step 2: Establish the Mathematical Framework**\n\nTo guarantee the existence of a solution, we need more structure than just sets. The standard framework for this kind of problem is that of **complete metric spaces**. This framework allows us to measure \"distances\" between points and ensures that sequences that \"should\" converge actually have a limit within the space.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1 (The Spaces):** We must assume that `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces. Completeness is crucial; without it, an iterative process might lead to a \"hole\" in the space, failing to find a fixed point.\n\n**Step 3: Reformulate the Problem using a Single Operator**\n\nThe system of three equations can be simplified by defining a single operator `T` that acts on the product space `M = X × Y × Z`.\n\n*   First, we define a metric `d_M` on the product space `M`. A common choice is the \"sum metric\":\n    `d_M( (x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂) ) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n*   If `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are complete metric spaces, then the product space `(M, d_M)` is also a complete metric space.\n*   Now, we define the operator `T: M → M` based on the functions `F`, `G`, and `H`:\n    `T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x) )`\n\nFinding an FGH-tripled fixed point is now equivalent to finding a fixed point of `T`, i.e., finding a point `p = (x, y, z)` such that `T(p) = p`.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem states that if `(M, d_M)` is a complete metric space and `T: M → M` is a **contraction mapping**, then `T` has a unique fixed point.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2 (The Contraction):** The core of the conditions lies in making `T` a contraction mapping. A mapping `T` is a contraction if there exists a constant `k` with `0 ≤ k < 1` such that for any two points `p₁` and `p₂` in `M`:\n    `d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d_M(p₁, p₂)`\n\n**Step 5: Translate the Contraction Condition to F, G, and H**\n\nThe final step is to find conditions on the individual functions `F`, `G`, and `H` that are sufficient to make the combined operator `T` a contraction. We express this using Lipschitz-like conditions on `F`, `G`, and `H`.\n\nLet `p₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)`.\nWe need to bound `d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂))`. Let's expand this:\n`d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂)) = d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂))`\n\nWe assume `F`, `G`, and `H` satisfy the following inequalities for some non-negative constants:\n1.  `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α * d_X(x₁, x₂) + β * d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ * d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n2.  `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ δ * d_Y(y₁, y₂) + ε * d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n3.  `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ η * d_Z(z₁, z₂) + θ * d_Y(y₁, y₂) + ι * d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\nNow, we substitute these into the expansion for `d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂))`:\n`d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ (α d_X + β d_Y + γ d_Z) + (δ d_Y + ε d_X) + (η d_Z + θ d_Y + ι d_X)`\n\nGrouping terms by metric:\n`d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ (α+ε+ι)d_X(x₁,x₂) + (β+δ+θ)d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (γ+η)d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nTo satisfy the contraction condition `d_M(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * (d_X + d_Y + d_Z)` with `k < 1`, we can set `k = max( (α+ε+ι), (β+δ+θ), (γ+η) )`. The contraction condition is met if `k < 1`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3 (The Final Inequality):** This inequality on the sums of the constants is the most crucial part of the conditions on the functions `F`, `G`, and `H`. It ensures that the combined operator `T` \"shrinks\" distances in the product space, guaranteeing convergence to a unique fixed point.\n\n### Final Answer: Summary of Conditions\n\nFor the functions `F: X×Y×Z → X`, `G: Y×X×Y → Y`, and `H: Z×Y×X → Z` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point, the following conditions are sufficient:\n\n1.  **(Space Condition):** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **complete metric spaces**.\n\n2.  **(Function Contraction Condition):** There must exist non-negative constants `α, β, γ, δ, ε, η, θ, ι` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following inequalities hold:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α·d_X(x₁, x₂) + β·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ δ·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + ε·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ η·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + θ·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + ι·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\n3.  **(Overall Contraction Guarantee):** The constants from the function conditions must satisfy the following constraint:\n    `max( (α + ε + ι), (β + δ + θ), (γ + η) ) < 1`\n\nIf these three conditions are met, then there exists a unique tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` satisfying `F(x,y,z)=x`, `G(y,x,y)=y`, and `H(z,y,x)=z`.\n\n<<<Let `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be complete metric spaces. A sufficient set of conditions for the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point is that there exist non-negative constants `α, β, γ, δ, ε, η, θ, ι` that satisfy two requirements:\n1. For any points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in the space `X × Y × Z`, the functions must obey the following contractive inequalities:\n   - `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α·d_X(x₁, x₂) + β·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ·d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n   - `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ δ·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + ε·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n   - `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ η·d_Z(z₁, z₂) + θ·d_Y(y₁, y₂) + ι·d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n2. These constants must collectively ensure a contraction on the product space, which is guaranteed if they satisfy the condition:\n   `max( (α + ε + ι), (β + δ + θ), (γ + η) ) < 1`>>>"
