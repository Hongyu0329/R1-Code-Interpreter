    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n*   **Action:** A character visited a Roman city.\n*   **Description:** This character describes the religious practices of that city.\n*   **Specifics of the Description:** The description must contain details that a reader would recognize as referring to the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n*   **Goal:** Identify the name of this character.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Mythological Reference**\nThe myth of Romulus and Remus is the foundation myth of Rome. Its most iconic image is of the twin infants being suckled by a she-wolf (the Lupa Capitolina). Therefore, the character's description must mention:\n*   A she-wolf.\n*   Two male infants or children.\n*   The act of the wolf nursing the children.\n*   This image being treated as a religious or foundational symbol by the Romans.\n\n**Step 3: Recall or Research the Plot and Characters of *The House of the Wolfings***\nThe novel focuses on a Germanic Gothic tribe (the Wolfings) preparing to fight an invading Roman army. The perspective is entirely from the Goths' point of view. For a character to have been in a Roman city, they would likely have been a captive, a traveler from a distant past, or an envoy (which is unlikely given the state of war).\n\n*   **Thiodolf:** The war-leader, protagonist. He is of the Wolfings, and his story is primarily set in the Mark (the Wolfing lands).\n*   **The Hall-Sun:** A supernatural being, Thiodolf's foster-daughter. Her origins are divine, not Roman.\n*   **Arinbiorn, Oswald, and other Wolfings:** These characters are native to the Mark and defined by their opposition to the Romans.\n*   **Hildigund:** She is a key character introduced early in the book. She is not a Wolfing by birth but a \"Guest\" from the Laxing tribe. Crucially, her backstory is that she was captured by the Romans, held captive in one of their cities, and eventually escaped to find shelter with the Wolfings. This makes her the most logical candidate.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the Specific Passage in the Text**\nGiven that Hildigund is the character with firsthand experience of Roman life, we must look for the scene where she recounts her experiences. This occurs in Chapter VI, \"Tidings of the Host\". The Wolfing elders question her about the Roman army and their customs.\n\nIn her response to their questions, Hildigund says the following:\n> \"Moreover, in a certain place of their city, I saw the image of a she-wolf standing, and two male children that were little and new-born sucking her paps; and this, they told me, was a holy thing, and the beginning of their race, and that they held the wolf in great worship...\"\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude**\n*   The character is **Hildigund**.\n*   She visited a Roman city as a captive.\n*   She describes a Roman religious practice/image.\n*   Her description of \"a she-wolf standing, and two male children...sucking her paps\" is a clear and unmistakable reference to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\nTherefore, the character who fits all the criteria in the question is Hildigund.\n\n<<<Hildigund>>>"
