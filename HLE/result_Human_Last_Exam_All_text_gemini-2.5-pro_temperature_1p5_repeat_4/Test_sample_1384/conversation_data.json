    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nWe need to find the first two non-zero digits of the number $x = e^{-7^{13}}$. Since the exponent is a large negative number, $x$ will be very small, in the form $0.00...d_1d_2...$, where $d_1$ is the first non-zero digit and $d_2$ is the second.\n\n**Step 2: Use Scientific Notation and Logarithms**\nAny positive number $x$ can be written in scientific notation as $x = A \\times 10^k$, where $1 \\le A < 10$ and $k$ is an integer. The significant digits of $x$ are the digits of the mantissa $A$. We need to find the first two digits of $A$.\n\nTo find $A$ and $k$, we use the base-10 logarithm:\n$\\log_{10}(x) = \\log_{10}(A \\times 10^k) = \\log_{10}(A) + k$\n\nSince $1 \\le A < 10$, we have $0 \\le \\log_{10}(A) < 1$. This means $\\log_{10}(A)$ is the fractional part of $\\log_{10}(x)$, while $k$ is the integer part. Specifically, for any real number $L$, $\\lfloor L \\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $L$. Thus, $k = \\lfloor \\log_{10}(x) \\rfloor$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Value of $\\log_{10}(x)$**\nWe apply the logarithm to our specific number $x=e^{-7^{13}}$:\n$\\log_{10}(x) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}}) = -7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nLet's define $Y = 7^{13} \\log_{10}(e)$. Then $\\log_{10}(x) = -Y$.\nWe need to calculate the value of $Y$. This involves two parts:\n1.  Calculate $N = 7^{13}$.\n2.  Use a precise value for the constant $\\log_{10}(e)$.\n\nCalculation of $N=7^{13}$:\n$7^2 = 49$\n$7^4 = 49^2 = 2401$\n$7^8 = 2401^2 = 5,764,801$\n$7^{12} = 7^8 \\times 7^4 = 5,764,801 \\times 2401 = 13,841,287,201$\n$7^{13} = 7^{12} \\times 7 = 13,841,287,201 \\times 7 = 96,889,010,407$.\n\nValue of $\\log_{10}(e)$:\n$\\log_{10}(e) = \\frac{1}{\\ln(10)} \\approx 0.4342944819032518$. A high precision is needed here, as this value is multiplied by the large number $N=7^{13} \\approx 9.69 \\times 10^{10}$.\n\nNow, we multiply these values:\n$Y = 96,889,010,407 \\times 0.4342944819032518 \\dots$\nUsing a computational tool for accuracy, we get:\n$Y \\approx 42,085,202,450.93299041$\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Mantissa A**\nWe have $\\log_{10}(x) = -Y \\approx -42085202450.93299041$.\nThe integer part is $k = \\lfloor \\log_{10}(x) \\rfloor = \\lfloor -42085202450.93299041 \\rfloor = -42,085,202,451$.\nThis integer $k$ tells us that the first non-zero digit of $x$ is at the $42,085,202,451$-th decimal place.\n\nThe logarithm of the mantissa $A$ is:\n$\\log_{10}(A) = \\log_{10}(x) - k = (-Y) - \\lfloor-Y\\rfloor = -Y - (-\\lceil Y \\rceil) = \\lceil Y \\rceil - Y$.\n$\\lceil Y \\rceil = \\lceil 42085202450.93299041 \\rceil = 42,085,202,451$.\n$\\log_{10}(A) \\approx 42085202451 - 42085202450.93299041 = 0.06700959$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the First Two Digits of A**\nWe need to find $A = 10^{\\log_{10}(A)} \\approx 10^{0.06700959}$.\nLet the first digit of A be $d_1$. To find $d_1$, we can compare $\\log_{10}(A)$ with the logarithms of integers.\n$\\log_{10}(1) = 0$\n$\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.30103$\nSince $0 < 0.06700959 < 0.30103$, we have $\\log_{10}(1) < \\log_{10}(A) < \\log_{10}(2)$.\nThis implies $1 < A < 2$. So, the first non-zero digit is $d_1 = 1$.\n\nTo find the second digit, $d_2$, we compare $A$ with numbers like $1.1, 1.2, \\ldots$. This is equivalent to comparing $\\log_{10}(A)$ with $\\log_{10}(1.1), \\log_{10}(1.2), \\ldots$.\nLet's find the values of these logarithms:\n$\\log_{10}(1.1) \\approx 0.04139$\n$\\log_{10}(1.2) \\approx 0.07918$\n\nNow, we compare our value for $\\log_{10}(A)$:\n$0.04139 < 0.06700959 < 0.07918$\nThis inequality implies that $\\log_{10}(1.1) < \\log_{10}(A) < \\log_{10}(1.2)$.\nBecause the logarithm function is increasing, this means:\n$1.1 < A < 1.2$\n\nThe number $A$ therefore starts with $1.1\\ldots$. The first digit of $A$ is 1, and the second digit of $A$ is 1. These are the first two non-zero digits of $e^{-7^{13}}$.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$ are 1 and 1.\n\n<<<11>>>"
