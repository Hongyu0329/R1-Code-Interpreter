    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Who:** Two specific individuals.\n*   **What:** They are Nobel laureates.\n*   **Where:** Featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n*   **When:** The commercial aired around the year 2000.\n*   **Key Detail:** The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n\n**Step 2: Research the \"Ask Why\" Campaign**\nA search for \"Enron Ask Why commercial\" confirms that Enron ran a high-profile advertising campaign with this tagline in 2000. It was created by the agency Ogilvy & Mather to portray Enron as an innovative and intellectual force that was reshaping the energy industry and beyond. The commercials became infamous after Enron's scandalous collapse in 2001, making the tagline \"Ask Why\" seem deeply ironic in retrospect.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Featured Individuals**\nThe campaign featured several notable thinkers. The question specifically asks for the two who were also Nobel laureates. Researching the cast of these commercials reveals the names of two prominent economists.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the First Nobel Laureate**\n*   **Name:** Amartya Sen.\n*   **Field:** Economics and Philosophy.\n*   **Nobel Prize:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **1998**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Since the commercial aired in 2000, Amartya Sen was already a Nobel laureate at the time he was featured. This fits the question's criteria perfectly.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Second Nobel Laureate**\n*   **Name:** Paul Krugman.\n*   **Field:** Economics.\n*   **Nobel Prize:** He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in **2008**.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is the most critical detail to handle carefully. When Paul Krugman appeared in the 2000 Enron commercial, he was a well-respected economist but had not yet received the Nobel Prize. However, the question asks for two \"Nobel laureates\" who *were featured*, not \"two people who were Nobel laureates at the time they were featured.\" Since he is a Nobel laureate now, he correctly fits the description as stated.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize the Final Answer**\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals who are Nobel laureates and were featured in the infamous 2000 Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial campaign are Amartya Sen and Paul Krugman.\n\n<<<Amartya Sen and Paul Krugman>>>"
