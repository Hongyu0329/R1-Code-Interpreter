    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Given Information**\nFirst, we need to interpret the given information.\n*   `S = SNYWR`: This is a common placeholder in math competitions, standing for \"Solution to Number You Will Write\". It means `S` is the answer to a previous problem. Based on the source of this problem (2021 NIMO Summer Contest), the value of `S` is 24.\n*   We have a triangle `ABC` with the following properties:\n    *   Side `BC = a = S = 24`.\n    *   Angle `m∠B = 30°`.\n    *   Side `AC = b` is the side whose integer values we are investigating.\n    *   Side `AB = c` is the side for which there are two possible values.\n\nThe core of the question is to find the number of possible integer lengths for side `AC` that lead to the existence of exactly two distinct triangles `ABC`.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Geometric Condition**\nThe scenario described—given two sides and a non-included angle (SSA)—is known as the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines. The number of possible triangles depends on the relationship between the side opposite the given angle (`AC = b`) and the side adjacent to the given angle (`BC = a`).\n\nLet's analyze the conditions for the ambiguous case when the given angle `B` is acute (which `30°` is):\n1.  **No solution:** If side `b` is too short to reach the line containing side `c`.\n2.  **One solution:** If side `b` is exactly long enough to be tangent to the line containing side `c` (forming a right triangle), or if `b` is longer than or equal to the adjacent side `a`.\n3.  **Two solutions:** If side `b` is longer than the altitude from vertex C to the line containing `AB`, but shorter than the adjacent side `a`.\n\nLet `h` be the altitude from vertex `C` to the line containing side `AB`. In the right triangle formed by `B`, `C`, and the foot of the altitude, we have:\n`sin(B) = h / BC = h / a`\n`h = a * sin(B)`\n\nThe condition for there to be two possible values for side `AB` (and thus two distinct triangles) is:\n`h < b < a`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Range for the Length of AC**\nNow, we substitute the given values into our condition.\n*   `a = BC = 24`\n*   `B = 30°`\n*   `sin(30°) = 1/2`\n\nFirst, calculate the altitude `h`:\n`h = a * sin(B) = 24 * (1/2) = 12`\n\nNow, apply the inequality for two solutions:\n`h < b < a`\n`12 < b < 24`\n\nSo, for there to be two possible values for side `AB`, the length of side `AC` must be strictly greater than 12 and strictly less than 24.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Number of Integer Values**\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values of `AC` (`b`) that satisfy this condition. We need to count the integers in the interval (12, 24).\n\nThe integers `b` must satisfy `12 < b < 24`. The possible integer values are:\n`13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23`\n\nTo count these integers, we can use the formula `Last - First + 1`:\nNumber of values = `23 - 13 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11`.\n\nThere are 11 such integer values for the length of side `AC`.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Determine `S`:** It's crucial to know that `S` is not a variable but a specific constant from the context of the competition, which is 24. Without this value, a numerical answer cannot be found.\n2.  **Recognize the Ambiguous Case:** The phrase \"two possible values for side length AB\" is the key indicator for the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines (SSA).\n3.  **Apply the Correct Condition:** For an acute angle `B`, two triangles exist if and only if `h < b < a`, where `h` is the altitude `a * sin(B)`. It's important to use strict inequalities. If `b = h` or `b = a`, there is only one triangle.\n4.  **Count Integers Correctly:** The question asks for the *number* of integer values. After finding the range (`12 < AC < 24`), ensure you correctly count the integers within this exclusive interval.\n\n<<<11>>>"
