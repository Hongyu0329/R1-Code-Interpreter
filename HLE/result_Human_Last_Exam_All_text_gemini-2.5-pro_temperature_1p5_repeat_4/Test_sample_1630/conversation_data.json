    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Polynomials $f$ and $g$\n\nThe problem states that $f$ and $g$ are polynomials of degree 3. Let's write them in their general form:\n$f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$\n$g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$\nwhere $a, p \\neq 0$.\n\nThe crucial condition is that their derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$.\n$f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c$\n$g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$\n\nFor a quadratic function $Ax^2+Bx+C$ to be always positive, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The parabola must open upwards, which means the leading coefficient is positive ($A > 0$).\n2.  The parabola must not touch or cross the x-axis, which means its discriminant is negative ($B^2 - 4AC < 0$).\n\nApplying these conditions to $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$:\n*   For $f'(x)$: $3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$. And $(2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies 4b^2 - 12ac < 0 \\implies b^2 < 3ac$.\n*   For $g'(x)$: $3p > 0 \\implies p > 0$. And $(2q)^2 - 4(3p)(r) < 0 \\implies 4q^2 - 12pr < 0 \\implies q^2 < 3pr$.\n\nA direct consequence of the derivatives being always positive is that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all $x$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Composite Function $h(x) = f(g(x))$\n\nWe are looking for the fixed points of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point is a value of $x$ such that $h(x) = x$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the degree of $h(x)$. Since $f$ and $g$ are both degree 3 polynomials, the degree of their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is the product of their degrees:\n$\\text{deg}(h) = \\text{deg}(f) \\times \\text{deg}(g) = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n\nSo, $h(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n\nNext, let's check the derivative of $h(x)$ using the chain rule:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n\nWe know that $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\nWe also know that $f'(y) > 0$ for any input $y$. If we let $y = g(x)$, then $f'(g(x)) > 0$.\nTherefore, $h'(x)$ is a product of two positive numbers, which means $h'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\nThis tells us that the composite function $h(x)$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Number of Fixed Points\n\nThe fixed points are the solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$.\nThis can be rewritten as $h(x) - x = 0$.\n\nLet $H(x) = h(x) - x$. The fixed points of $h(x)$ are the roots of the polynomial $H(x)$.\nThe leading term of $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is found by composing the leading terms of $f$ and $g$:\n$f(y) \\approx ay^3$ and $g(x) \\approx px^3$.\n$h(x) \\approx a(px^3)^3 = ap^3 x^9$.\nSince $a>0$ and $p>0$, the leading coefficient $ap^3$ is positive.\n\nThe polynomial $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ has the same leading term, $ap^3 x^9$, because the term $-x$ does not affect the highest power.\nSo, $H(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. Therefore, the function $h(x)=f(g(x))$ can have at most 9 fixed points.\n\n### Step 4: Can the Maximum of 9 Fixed Points be Achieved?\n\nThe final question is whether it's actually possible to construct functions $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions and result in 9 distinct fixed points.\n\n1.  For $H(x)$ to have 9 distinct real roots, its graph must cross the x-axis 9 times. Since the leading coefficient is positive, $H(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$ and $H(x) \\to +\\infty$ as $x \\to +\\infty$.\n2.  To have 9 roots, $H(x)$ must have 8 local extrema (4 local maxima and 4 local minima), with the local maxima being positive and the local minima being negative.\n3.  This requires the derivative, $H'(x)$, to have 8 distinct real roots.\n    $H'(x) = h'(x) - 1$. So, the equation $h'(x) = 1$ must have 8 distinct real roots.\n4.  Let's examine $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$.\n    *   $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   $f'(y) = 3ay^2 + 2by + c$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n    *   $f'(g(x))$ is the composition of a degree 2 and a degree 3 polynomial, so its degree is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   $h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is the product of a degree 6 and a degree 2 polynomial. Its degree is $6+2=8$.\n5.  So, the equation $h'(x)=1$ is a polynomial equation of degree 8. It can have at most 8 real roots. This is consistent with what is required to get 9 fixed points.\n6.  To get 8 real roots for $h'(x)=1$, the graph of the 8th-degree polynomial $h'(x)$ must intersect the horizontal line $y=1$ eight times. This is possible if the polynomial $h'(x)$ has sufficient \"wiggles.\" An 8th-degree polynomial can have up to 7 local extrema. If we can arrange the parameters of $f$ and $g$ such that the 7 local extrema of $h'(x)$ exist and their values alternate between being less than 1 and greater than 1, then we will have 8 intersections.\n7.  The conditions $f'>0$ and $g'>0$ only impose inequality constraints on the coefficients of the polynomials ($b^2<3ac$ and $q^2<3pr$). These conditions define open sets in the space of coefficients, providing ample freedom to choose the parameters. There is no fundamental theorem or property that would prevent a suitable choice of coefficients from creating the required oscillatory behavior for $h'(x)$. In the field of dynamical systems and real algebraic geometry, it is a common principle that unless a specific constraint (like symmetry or a violation of Rolle's theorem conditions) limits the number of roots, the maximum number allowed by the degree is often achievable for a \"generic\" choice of parameters.\n\nTherefore, it is possible for the equation $f(g(x))=x$ to have 9 real roots.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$.\n1.  The function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n2.  The number of fixed points is the number of solutions to $h(x) = x$, which is a polynomial equation of degree 9.\n3.  A polynomial equation of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots.\n4.  The constraints on $f$ and $g$ are not restrictive enough to prevent the number of roots from reaching this maximum. It is possible to construct such polynomials that yield 9 distinct fixed points.\n\nThus, the maximum number of fixed points is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
