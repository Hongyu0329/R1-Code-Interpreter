    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal chromatic number of the graph G.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Graph G\n\nThe problem states that the graph \\( G \\) is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\". In graph theory, the \"sum\" of graphs, denoted by '+', typically refers to the **graph join** operation. Let the three cycles be \\( C_n^1, C_n^2, \\) and \\( C_n^3 \\).\n\nThe graph \\( G \\) is defined as \\( G = C_n^1 + C_n^2 + C_n^3 \\).\n\nLet's break down the structure of a graph join:\n*   **Vertex Set**: The vertex set of \\( G \\) is the disjoint union of the vertex sets of the three cycles. If each cycle has \\( n \\) vertices, then the total number of vertices in \\( G \\) is \\( n + n + n = 3n \\).\n*   **Edge Set**: The edge set of \\( G \\) consists of:\n    1.  All the edges that are originally in \\( C_n^1 \\), \\( C_n^2 \\), and \\( C_n^3 \\).\n    2.  All possible edges connecting a vertex from \\( C_n^1 \\) to a vertex from \\( C_n^2 \\).\n    3.  All possible edges connecting a vertex from \\( C_n^1 \\) to a vertex from \\( C_n^3 \\).\n    4.  All possible edges connecting a vertex from \\( C_n^2 \\) to a vertex from \\( C_n^3 \\).\n\nA key consequence of this structure is that every vertex in one cycle is adjacent to every vertex in the other two cycles.\n\n### Step 2: Relating the Chromatic Number of G to its Components\n\nA fundamental property of the graph join operation relates the chromatic number of the resulting graph to the chromatic numbers of the component graphs. For any two graphs \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), the chromatic number of their join is the sum of their individual chromatic numbers:\n\\[ \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\]\n\nThis rule extends to the join of multiple graphs. For our graph \\( G = C_n^1 + C_n^2 + C_n^3 \\), the chromatic number is:\n\\[ \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n^1) + \\chi(C_n^2) + \\chi(C_n^3) \\]\n\nSince \\( C_n^1, C_n^2, \\) and \\( C_n^3 \\) are all cycles of the same length \\( n \\), they have the same chromatic number, which we denote as \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n\\[ \\chi(G) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (Ï‡(C_n))\n\nThe next step is to find the chromatic number of a cycle of length \\( n \\). The value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) depends on the parity of \\( n \\). (We assume \\( n \\geq 3 \\), as a cycle requires at least 3 vertices).\n\n*   **Case A: n is even**\n    If \\( n \\) is an even number (\\( n \\geq 4 \\)), the cycle \\( C_n \\) is a **bipartite graph**. A bipartite graph can be colored with just two colors. For example, we can alternate colors as we go around the cycle (color 1, color 2, color 1, ..., color 2). Since \\( n \\) is even, the last vertex (colored with 2) will be adjacent to the first vertex (colored with 1), which is a valid coloring. Thus, for even \\( n \\):\n    \\[ \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\]\n\n*   **Case B: n is odd**\n    If \\( n \\) is an odd number (\\( n \\geq 3 \\)), the cycle \\( C_n \\) is not bipartite because it contains an odd-length cycle (itself). Therefore, it requires more than two colors. We can, however, color any odd cycle with three colors. For instance, color vertices \\( v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_{n-1} \\) by alternating two colors, and then use a third color for the final vertex \\( v_n \\). This is a valid 3-coloring. Thus, for odd \\( n \\):\n    \\[ \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Chromatic Number of G for each case\n\nNow we can substitute the value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) back into our formula for \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n\n*   **If n is even**:\n    \\[ \\chi(G) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\]\n\n*   **If n is odd**:\n    \\[ \\chi(G) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Maximal Chromatic Number\n\nThe question asks for the \"maximal chromatic number\" of \\( G \\). We have found that the chromatic number of \\( G \\) can be either 6 (when \\( n \\) is even) or 9 (when \\( n \\) is odd). The maximal value among these possibilities is 9.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number of a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 9. This maximum is achieved whenever \\( n \\) is an odd integer.\n\n<<<9>>>"
