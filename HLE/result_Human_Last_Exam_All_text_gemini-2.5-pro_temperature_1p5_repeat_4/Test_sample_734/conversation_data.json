    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** A Christian theologian.\n    *   **Action:** \"first developed specialized terminology\". This implies a specific, conceptual vocabulary created by a particular thinker, not just a general discussion of the topics. The \"first\" points to a historical origin.\n    *   **Purpose of Terminology:** To \"describe changes in the laws of nature\". This means the theologian had a concept of natural laws and a way to explain how they could be altered, suspended, or superseded.\n    *   **Applications (Case Studies):** The terminology must be applicable to two distinct theological events:\n        1.  **The Virgin Birth of Jesus:** A specific, singular miracle involving the suspension of normal biological laws.\n        2.  **The Fall:** A broader, more systemic change, suggesting the natural world itself (e.g., with respect to death, decay, suffering) began to operate under different principles after the sin of Adam and Eve.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates:**\n\n    *   **Early Church Fathers (pre-Augustine):** Figures like Irenaeus, Origen, or Athanasius wrote extensively about Christology (including the virgin birth) and creation/the Fall. However, they are not known for developing a specific, philosophical terminology to explain the *mechanism* of how natural laws could change. Their focus was more on the theological and soteriological (salvation-related) significance of these events.\n\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD):** Augustine is a prime candidate. He was a highly systematic and philosophical thinker who sought to harmonize Christian doctrine with intellectual inquiry.\n        *   **Specialized Terminology:** Augustine developed the concept of ***rationes seminales*** (in Latin), which can be translated as \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal principles\".\n        *   **How it Works:** He argued that in the initial act of creation, God embedded these *rationes seminales* within the fabric of the universe. These are latent potentialities or pre-programmed causes for everything that would ever come into being. Most unfold in the regular, predictable \"course of nature\" (*cursus naturae*). However, some are for exceptional events.\n        *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** Augustine argued the virgin birth was not contrary to nature (*contra naturam*) as God created it, but only contrary to the *usual course* of nature that we observe. God had embedded the potential for a virgin birth as a *ratio seminalis* from the beginning, which was then actualized at the specific time of Jesus's conception.\n        *   **Application to the Fall:** This framework also explains alterations in nature after the Fall. Augustine could posit that phenomena like death, disease, and the struggle for survival (e.g., \"thorns and thistles\") were the result of negative *rationes seminales* being \"activated\" by human sin. Thus, the laws governing the natural world were fundamentally altered, shifting from an idyllic state to the one we now experience.\n        *   **Conclusion on Augustine:** He fits all criteria perfectly. He was the *first* major theologian to develop such a systematic and specific terminology (*rationes seminales*) that could cohesively explain both a singular miracle and a systemic change in natural laws.\n\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274 AD):** Aquinas is another major systematic theologian.\n        *   **Specialized Terminology:** He famously distinguished between God's **Ordained Power** (*potentia ordinata*)—the power by which God works through the established natural order—and his **Absolute Power** (*potentia absoluta*)—the power to do anything that isn't a logical contradiction, including acting outside the established order.\n        *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** The virgin birth would be a clear example of God exercising his *potentia absoluta* to perform a miracle that suspends the ordained laws of biology.\n        *   **Application to the Fall:** This is a weaker fit. For Aquinas, humanity's original immortality was a *preternatural gift* added on top of human nature, which was naturally mortal. The Fall was the *removal* of this gift, causing humanity to revert to its natural, mortal state. This is less an \"alteration in the laws of nature\" and more the removal of a supernatural exception to them. Therefore, while Aquinas has specialized terminology, it doesn't apply to the Fall in the specific way the question describes as neatly as Augustine's framework does. Furthermore, Augustine predates Aquinas by over 800 years.\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Augustine of Hippo is the theologian who first developed a specialized vocabulary—the concept of *rationes seminales* (\"seminal reasons\")—to explain how the laws of nature could change. This single framework provided a mechanism applicable to both the singular miracle of the virgin birth and the systemic alterations to the natural world that were believed to have occurred as a consequence of the Fall.\n\n***\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
