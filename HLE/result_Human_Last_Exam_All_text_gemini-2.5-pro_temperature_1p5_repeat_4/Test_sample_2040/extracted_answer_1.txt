No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The reason is that the most common and stable phases of boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, possess a centrosymmetric crystal structure. Materials with inversion symmetry have a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is a fundamental requirement for the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion to occur.
