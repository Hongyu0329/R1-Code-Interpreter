    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core physical process: Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).**\nSPDC is a nonlinear optical process where one photon of higher energy (the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear crystal and spontaneously splits into two photons of lower energy (the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons). Energy and momentum must be conserved throughout this process. The key requirement for a material to facilitate SPDC is that it must possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the condition for a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).**\nThe second-order susceptibility, χ⁽²⁾, is a tensor that describes a material's second-order response to an applied electric field (like that from incident light). A fundamental rule in crystal optics dictates that χ⁽²⁾ is strictly zero for any material whose crystal structure possesses a center of inversion. In simpler terms, if the crystal lattice looks identical after being inverted through a central point, the material is called **centrosymmetric**. Centrosymmetric materials cannot exhibit bulk second-order nonlinear effects, including SPDC and second-harmonic generation (SHG).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the crystal structure and symmetry of boron nanosheets.**\nBoron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are two-dimensional (2D) materials made of boron atoms. Unlike graphene, which has one primary structure, borophene is highly polymorphic, meaning it can exist in many different stable or metastable structures (allotropes). The most widely studied and experimentally realized phases (typically grown on a silver substrate) are the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The specific structure matters.** We need to analyze the symmetry of these common borophene phases.\n*   The **β₁₂ borophene** phase has a rectangular unit cell with space group *Pmmn*.\n*   The **χ₃ borophene** phase has a rectangular unit cell with space group *Cmcm*.\n*   Both of these space groups, *Pmmn* and *Cmcm*, describe **centrosymmetric** crystal structures. They each contain an inversion center as a symmetry element.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the material property (symmetry) to the physical process (SPDC).**\nSince the common, stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric, their intrinsic bulk χ⁽²⁾ is zero. Because a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ is a prerequisite for SPDC, these ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets cannot support this process.\n\n**Step 5: Consider potential exceptions and nuances.**\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Distinguishing intrinsic properties from extrinsic effects.** While a perfect, infinite borophene sheet would not exhibit SPDC, real-world factors could technically induce a weak response. For instance, structural defects, applied strain, wrinkles, or interactions with a substrate can break the local inversion symmetry. However, the question asks about the property of \"free-standing boron nanosheets,\" which implies we should consider the intrinsic properties of the ideal material, not effects from external perturbations.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Comparison with other 2D materials.** This conclusion places borophene in the same category as graphene, which is also centrosymmetric and lacks a χ⁽²⁾ response. This is in sharp contrast to other 2D materials like monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g., MoS₂, WSe₂), which are non-centrosymmetric and are well-known for their strong second-order nonlinear optical effects, making them suitable candidates for SPDC.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the dominant and stable structures of borophene possess inversion symmetry. This fundamental structural property makes their intrinsic second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) equal to zero. As SPDC is a second-order nonlinear process that relies on a non-zero χ⁽²⁾, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit this phenomenon.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The reason is that the most common and stable phases of boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases, possess a centrosymmetric crystal structure. Materials with inversion symmetry have a zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is a fundamental requirement for the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion to occur."
