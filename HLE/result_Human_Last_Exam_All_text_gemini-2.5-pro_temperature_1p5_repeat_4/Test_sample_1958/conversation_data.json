    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"first book in the Bible\"**: This requires us to start with the beginning of the Bible.\n    *   **\"in canonical order\"**: We must proceed sequentially through the books as they are traditionally ordered: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and so on. We check the Old Testament books first before moving to the New Testament.\n    *   **\"to be mentioned by name\"**: The specific title of the biblical book must be present in the text of the play. Simple allusions to stories or characters from a book are not sufficient. For example, a character being called \"as patient as Job\" refers to the character, not explicitly to the \"Book of Job.\"\n    *   **\"in a Shakespeare play\"**: The mention must occur within the accepted Shakespearean canon.\n    *   **\"which play is it mentioned in?\"**: The final answer must include the title of the play where the mention is found.\n\n2.  **Sequential Search through the Bible (Old Testament):**\n\n    *   **Genesis:** A search of the complete works of Shakespeare shows that the word \"Genesis\" is never used to refer to the book of the Bible.\n    *   **Exodus:** Likewise, the title \"Exodus\" does not appear as a reference to the biblical book.\n    *   **Leviticus:** This book title is not mentioned by name in any of Shakespeare's plays.\n    *   **Numbers:** We search for the word \"Numbers.\" In *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act 4, Scene 1), the Welsh parson Sir Hugh Evans, while testing William Page on his Latin, says: \"It is a chapter come out of **Numbers**, Mistress Page.\" This is a direct and unambiguous mention of the biblical Book of Numbers by name.\n\n3.  **Confirming the \"First\" Mention:**\n    Since we found a clear mention of the fourth book of the Bible, **Numbers**, our search for the *first* one could potentially end here. However, to be thorough, it's worth noting other early mentions to confirm that none precede Numbers.\n\n    *   **Judges:** The seventh book of the Bible. In *Love's Labour's Lost* (Act 4, Scene 2), the schoolmaster Holofernes refers to \"...Samson in the book of **Judges**...\" This is a clear mention, but Judges comes after Numbers in the canonical order.\n    *   **Psalms:** The nineteenth book of the Bible. In *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act 2, Scene 1), Mistress Ford complains that two characters' stories don't match, saying they \"do no more adhere and keep pace together than the Hundredth **Psalm** to the tune of 'Green Sleeves.'\" This mention of a specific psalm is a reference to the Book of Psalms, but it comes much later in the Bible than Numbers.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The search confirmed that no books before Numbers (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are mentioned by name. The first book in the canonical order of the Bible to be explicitly named in a Shakespeare play is **Numbers**. The play in which this mention occurs is **The Merry Wives of Windsor**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Name vs. Allusion:** The distinction between mentioning a book *by name* and merely alluding to its content is crucial. Shakespeare's plays are filled with biblical allusions (e.g., to Cain and Abel from Genesis, or to Judas from the Gospels), but direct naming of the books is much rarer.\n*   **Common Nouns:** Some book titles are also common words (e.g., numbers, judges, kings). The context of the quote is essential to confirm it refers to the biblical book. The quote about \"Numbers\" clearly states it is a source for a \"chapter,\" confirming the reference is to the book.\n*   **Canonical Order:** The Protestant canonical order is the standard reference here, as it was for Shakespeare's England. Following this order strictly is key to finding the \"first\" book.\n\n***\n\n<<<The first book of the Bible mentioned by name is **Numbers**, which is mentioned in **The Merry Wives of Windsor**.>>>"
