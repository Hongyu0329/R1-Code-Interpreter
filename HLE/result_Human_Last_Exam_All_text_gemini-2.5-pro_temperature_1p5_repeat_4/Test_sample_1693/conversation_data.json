    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Vessel Type:** Any French ship (military or civilian).\n    *   **Nationality:** French.\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** A German U-boat.\n    *   **Timeframe:** From the start of World War II for France (September 3, 1939) until the Armistice of 22 June 1940.\n    *   **Metric for \"Largest\":** Displacement, which is the weight of the ship. For merchant ships, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a measure of volume, is more commonly listed. While not the same as displacement, it is a reliable proxy for comparing the size of similar civilian vessels. The ship with the highest GRT will almost certainly have the highest displacement.\n\n2.  **Examine French Warship Losses:**\n    *   First, we consider major French warships. In the period from September 1939 to June 22, 1940, the French Navy did not lose any battleships, aircraft carriers, or cruisers to U-boat attacks.\n    *   Several destroyers and smaller vessels were sunk, but their displacements were much lower than that of a large ocean liner. For example, the destroyer *Bison* (sunk by air attack, not a U-boat) had a displacement of about 2,436 tons. The submarine *Doris*, sunk by U-9, had a surface displacement of only 630 tons.\n    *   Therefore, the largest vessel is likely to be a merchant ship.\n\n3.  **Examine French Merchant Ship Losses:**\n    *   We need to review the list of French merchant ships sunk by U-boats in the specified timeframe and identify the one with the highest tonnage.\n    *   **Candidate 1: S.S. *Bretagne***: This passenger liner of 10,125 GRT was sunk by U-45 on October 14, 1939.\n    *   **Candidate 2: S.S. *Foch***: This cargo ship of 10,774 GRT was sunk by U-13 on February 2, 1940.\n    *   **Candidate 3: S.S. *Champollion***: This passenger liner of **12,546 GRT** was sunk by U-45 on October 2, 1939.\n\n4.  **Compare the Candidates:**\n    *   Comparing the three largest finds:\n        *   *Bretagne*: 10,125 GRT\n        *   *Foch*: 10,774 GRT\n        *   *Champollion*: 12,546 GRT\n    *   The S.S. *Champollion* has the highest Gross Register Tonnage by a significant margin. As it was a passenger liner, its displacement tonnage would also have been the highest among these candidates, estimated to be in the region of 16,000-18,000 tons.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Date:** The date of the sinking is critical. The sinking must occur before June 22, 1940. The sinking of the S.S. *Champollion* on October 2, 1939, falls well within this period. Another large liner, the *Mekn√®s* (10,142 GRT), was sunk later on July 24, 1940, which is *after* the armistice and thus invalid.\n*   **Sinking Agent:** The ship must have been sunk by a U-boat. Losses to mines, aircraft, or surface ships do not count. The *Champollion* was sunk by a torpedo from U-45.\n*   **Metric:** The question specifies \"displacement.\" While precise displacement figures for merchant ships from this era can be hard to find, GRT is a standard and reliable measure for comparison. The ship with the highest GRT (*Champollion*) would also have the largest displacement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the passenger liner **S.S. *Champollion***. It was sunk on October 2, 1939, by the German U-boat U-45.\n\n<<<S.S. Champollion>>>"
