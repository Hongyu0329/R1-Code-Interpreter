The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show a resonance peak on a VNA test is due to its **active decoupling circuitry**. This circuitry is a safety feature designed to protect the coil and patient from the scanner's high-power transmit pulse. It uses components like PIN diodes, which require a specific DC bias voltage from the MRI scanner to put the coil into its "receive," or resonant, mode. When the coil is on a bench and not connected to the scanner, it does not receive this bias voltage. By default, the decoupling circuit is engaged, intentionally making the coil non-resonant. Therefore, your VNA is correctly measuring a non-resonant circuit, even though the coil is fully functional when provided with the proper control signals from the scanner.
