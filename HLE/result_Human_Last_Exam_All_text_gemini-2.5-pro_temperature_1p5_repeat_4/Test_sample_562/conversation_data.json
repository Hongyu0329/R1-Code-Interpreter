    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Kanji Character:** The first step is to correctly break down the character 謄 into its constituent parts. Visually, this character can be confusing. One might see the components 月 and 朕, or perhaps other combinations. To be certain, we must refer to standard lexicographical sources.\n\n2.  **Identify the Correct Radical (Bushu):** According to standard kanji dictionaries, the character 謄 is classified under a specific radical.\n    *   The total stroke count of 謄 is 16.\n    *   Dictionaries list the radical of 謄 as **言**.\n    *   The radical 言 has 7 strokes. The other component of the character is 朕, which has 9 strokes.\n    *   The stroke counts add up correctly: 7 (言) + 9 (朕) = 16. This confirms that the parts are indeed 言 and 朕.\n    *   In this character's structure, the component 朕 sits on top of a modified 言 radical at the bottom. The 言 radical provides the meaning category (related to words, speech, or transcription), while 朕 provides the sound.\n\n3.  **Find the Name of the Radical:** Once the radical is identified as 言, the next step is to find its conventional name.\n    *   Radicals in Japanese have names, which can sometimes change based on their position in a character (e.g., left side, right side, top, bottom).\n    *   The radical 言 is most frequently found on the left side of a character. In this position, it is called **Gonben** (言偏). The \"gon\" is a reading of the character 言, and \"ben\" (from \"hen\") means \"left side\". This is the most common and widely known name for this radical.\n\n4.  **Consider the Radical's Position:** In the character 謄, the radical 言 is at the bottom (a position known as *ashi*), not on the left.\n    *   While the name \"Gonben\" technically means \"言 on the left side,\" it is so common that it's often used to refer to the 言 radical regardless of its position, especially when there isn't another specific common name.\n    *   The question provides the example of 媛, where the radical is 女 on the left, and the answer is \"Onnahen\". This confirms the expected format is the common name for the radical in its position.\n    *   Since there is no specific, widely-used name for 言 when it is at the bottom, the most appropriate and standard answer is its most common name.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The radical of 謄 is 言. Its most common and standard name in Japanese is \"Gonben\". We will use the Hepburn transcription of this name.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
