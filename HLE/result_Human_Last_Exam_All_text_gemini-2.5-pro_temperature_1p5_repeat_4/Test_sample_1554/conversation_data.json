    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct philosopher.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify a philosopher from a specific school (Lviv-Warsaw School) who made a particular conceptual distinction.\n*   **School:** Lviv-Warsaw School. This was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland during the interwar period. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Alfred Tarski, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n*   **Core Notion:** \"Hallmark.\" This is a general term for a distinguishing sign, mark, or characteristic. In the context of semiotics (the study of signs), this would be the general category of \"sign.\"\n*   **Decomposition:** \"Symptoms\" and \"Signals.\" This is the specific distinction made within the broader category of \"hallmark\" or \"sign.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the distinction between \"symptoms\" and \"signals.\"**\nThis distinction is fundamental in semiotics.\n*   **Symptom (or indication):** This is a natural sign. There is a causal or natural correlation between the sign and what it signifies. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire; a fever is a symptom of illness. The connection is not based on human agreement.\n*   **Signal:** This is a conventional sign. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is arbitrary and based on a rule, agreement, or convention. For example, the word \"tree\" is a signal for the concept of a tree; a red traffic light is a signal to stop.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the distinction to the philosophers of the Lviv-Warsaw School.**\nWe need to examine the works of the major figures of the Lviv-Warsaw School to see who focused on logic, language, and semiotics in a way that would lead to this specific analysis.\n*   Tadeusz Kotarbiński was known for his reism/concretism.\n*   Alfred Tarski was a paramount figure in logic and formal semantics (theory of truth).\n*   Jan Łukasiewicz was famous for his work on many-valued logic.\n*   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** was a central figure in the philosophy of language, logic, and semantics. He is particularly famous for his work on syntactic connection and the theory of meaning. A core part of his work involved a detailed analysis of the different functions and types of signs.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the connection with Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.**\nA review of Ajdukiewicz's work on semiotics and the philosophy of language confirms that he is the one who made this famous distinction. In his analyses, he categorized signs (*znaki* in Polish, which translates to signs/marks/hallmarks) into different types. His most well-known classification divides them into:\n1.  **Symptoms** (*oznaki*): Natural signs based on a causal link.\n2.  **Signals** (*sygnały*): Conventional signs based on an established rule or intention to communicate.\n\nHe further analyzed these categories, but this primary decomposition of signs into symptoms and signals is a cornerstone of his semiotic theory.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude.**\nBased on the analysis of the Lviv-Warsaw School and the specific philosophical concepts, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the philosopher who decomposed the general notion of a sign (or hallmark) into the categories of symptoms and signals.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
