    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the equilibrium points**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nEquilibrium points are the constant solutions, which occur when $x'(t) = 0$. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We need to find the roots of the equation $f(x) = 0$.\n$$ -x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0 $$\nWe can factor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe term inside the parentheses is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe solutions to this equation are the equilibrium points. By setting each factor to zero, we get:\n$x = 0$\n$(x-1)^2 = 0 \\implies x-1=0 \\implies x=1$\nThus, the equilibrium points are $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we can use the first derivative test. We analyze the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, denoted as $f'(x)$, at the equilibrium point.\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we need to analyze the sign of $f(x)$ around $x^*$.\n\nFirst, let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) = -1 < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method to determine the stability of $x=1$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stability of $x=1$ by examining the sign of $f(x)$**\n\nWe analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\n*   **For $x$ slightly less than 1** (e.g., $x=0.9$):\n    $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.9(0.01) = -0.009$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving away from $x=1$.\n*   **For $x$ slightly greater than 1** (e.g., $x=1.1$):\n    $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -1.1(0.01) = -0.011$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, the solution $x(t)$ decreases, moving towards $x=1$.\n\nBecause solutions starting from one side (the left side) of $x=1$ move away from it, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable. It is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium point, which is considered an unstable type.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the value of $m$**\n\nThe problem states that $m$ is the number of stable equilibrium points. Based on our analysis, only the equilibrium point $x=0$ is stable.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression**\n\nWe need to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
