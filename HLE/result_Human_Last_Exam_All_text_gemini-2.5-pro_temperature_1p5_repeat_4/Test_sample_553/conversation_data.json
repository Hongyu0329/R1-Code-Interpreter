    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terminology\n\n*   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord built on the first note of the scale. In musical notation, it's represented by the Roman numeral `I` in a major key or `i` in a minor key.\n*   **Fifth Chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. It's also called the dominant chord.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord:** This is the crucial part. In a major key, the standard fifth chord is a *major* chord (denoted as `V`). A \"minor fifth chord\" (denoted as `v`) is unconventional in a major key. It's typically \"borrowed\" from the parallel minor key. For example, in the key of F Major, the tonic (`I`) is F Major. The fifth note is C, so the standard fifth chord (`V`) is C Major. A *minor* fifth chord (`v`) would be C minor.\n*   **Chord Jump:** This implies a direct and often immediate transition from one chord to the next.\n*   **Starts with:** This means the progression should occur at the very beginning of the song, as part of its main introductory theme or the first line of the verse.\n\nSo, we are looking for a Beatles song in a major key that begins with the chord progression **I -> v**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs\n\nLet's examine the openings of famous Beatles songs to see if they fit this pattern.\n\n1.  **\"Help!\"**: The key is A Major. The tonic (`I`) is A Major. The minor fifth (`v`) would be E minor. The song's opening progression is A - F#m - D - E (or `I - vi - IV - V`). This is not correct.\n2.  **\"Let It Be\"**: The key is C Major. The tonic (`I`) is C Major. The minor fifth (`v`) would be G minor. The song's verse progression is C - G - Am - F (or `I - V - vi - IV`). This is not correct; it uses the standard major fifth (`V`).\n3.  **\"Hey Jude\"**: The key is F Major. The tonic (`I`) is F Major. The minor fifth (`v`) would be C minor. The song's verse progression is F - C - Dm - Bb (`I - V - vi - IV`). This is not correct; it also uses the standard major fifth (`V`).\n4.  **\"Michelle\"**: This song from the album *Rubber Soul* is the most promising candidate.\n    *   **Key:** The song is primarily in the key of F Major. Therefore, the tonic (`I`) chord is F Major.\n    *   **Fifth Chord Analysis:** The fifth note of the F Major scale is C. The standard dominant chord (`V`) is C Major. A *minor* fifth chord (`v`) in this key would be C minor.\n    *   **Opening Progression:** While the song has a brief instrumental introduction with a descending bassline, the very first vocal line (\"I love you, I love you, I love you...\") begins with a very distinct chord change. The progression for this line is **F Major -> C minor**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a perfect match. The song's verse starts with a \"jump\" from the tonic F Major (`I`) to the borrowed minor fifth C minor (`v`). This specific `I -> v` progression is one of the most musically distinctive and celebrated features of \"Michelle\".\n\n### Step 3: Final Verification\n\nNo other well-known Beatles song uses this specific `I -> v` progression as its opening statement. The harmonic device is rare and a key part of what makes the harmony of \"Michelle\" so unique. Therefore, it is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
