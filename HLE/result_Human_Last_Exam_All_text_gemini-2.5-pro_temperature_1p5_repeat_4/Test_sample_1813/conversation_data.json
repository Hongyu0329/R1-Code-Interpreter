    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept of Generalized Markov Numbers**\n\nThe generalized Markov numbers, denoted \\( m_{p/q} \\), are values in the Lagrange and Markov spectra associated with rational numbers \\(p/q\\). While the exact numerical value of \\(m_{p/q}\\) requires deep results from Diophantine approximation, its definition is intrinsically linked to a specific quadratic irrational number. The \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\)\" refers to the continued fraction of this defining quadratic irrational number.\n\n**2. The Construction Process**\n\nThe procedure to find the continued fraction associated with \\(m_{p/q}\\) for a rational number \\( p/q \\) in the interval (0, 1) is as follows:\n*   First, find the simple continued fraction of the rational number \\(p/q\\). It will have the form \\([0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]\\).\n*   Second, take the sequence of coefficients \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n) \\).\n*   Third, create a new sequence which is a palindrome formed by appending the reverse of the original sequence to itself. The new sequence is \\( (a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_2, a_1) \\).\n*   Finally, the continued fraction associated with \\(m_{p/q}\\) is the purely periodic continued fraction whose repeating block is this palindromic sequence.\n\n**3. Applying the Process to \\( m_{4/7} \\)**\n\n*   **Step 1: Find the continued fraction of \\( 4/7 \\).**\n    We use the Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients:\n    \\[ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} \\]\n    \\[ \\frac{7}{4} = 1 + \\frac{3}{4} \\]\n    \\[ \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}} \\]\n    \\[ \\frac{4}{3} = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n    Substituting back, we get:\n    \\[ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} \\]\n    So, the continued fraction expansion of \\( 4/7 \\) is \\([0; 1, 1, 3]\\).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the coefficients.**\n    The sequence of coefficients is \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3) \\).\n\n*   **Step 3: Form the palindromic sequence.**\n    The palindromic sequence is formed by \\( (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_3, a_2, a_1) \\).\n    Substituting the values, we get the sequence \\( (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1) \\).\n\n*   **Step 4: Write the final continued fraction.**\n    The continued fraction associated with \\( m_{4/7} \\) is the purely periodic continued fraction with the repeating block we found in the previous step.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe final result is the continued fraction with the periodic block (1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1).\n\n<<<\\([\\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]\\).>>>"
