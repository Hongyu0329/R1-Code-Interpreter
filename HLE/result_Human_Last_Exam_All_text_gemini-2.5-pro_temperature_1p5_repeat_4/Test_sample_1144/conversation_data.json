    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe problem requires us to calculate the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum ($\\Delta p$) to its classical momentum ($p$) as described in the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$). We are given a specific value for the uncertainty in the electron's position ($\\Delta x$).\n\nTo solve this, we will need to use two fundamental concepts from quantum mechanics and atomic physics:\n1.  **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in a particle's position to the uncertainty in its momentum.\n2.  **The Bohr Model of the Atom:** This model provides a value for the momentum of an electron in a specific orbit.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis and Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$).**\n\nHeisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is given by the formula:\n$\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$\nwhere:\n*   $\\Delta x$ is the uncertainty in position.\n*   $\\Delta p$ is the uncertainty in momentum.\n*   $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34}$ JÂ·s).\n\nTo find the minimum uncertainty in momentum, we use the equality:\n$\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\nWe are given $\\Delta x = 10$ pm. We must convert this to SI units (meters):\n$\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\nSo, the expression for the uncertainty in momentum is:\n$\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the momentum ($p$) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit.**\n\nIn the Bohr model, the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron is quantized:\n$L = n\\hbar$\nwhere $n$ is the principal quantum number. For the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$, so:\n$L = 1 \\cdot \\hbar = \\hbar$\n\nAngular momentum is also defined as $L = r \\times p$, which for a circular orbit simplifies to $L = r_n \\cdot p$, where $r_n$ is the radius of the orbit.\nFor the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$), the radius ($r_1$) is known as the Bohr radius ($a_0$).\n$r_1 = a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n\nFrom the angular momentum quantization, we have:\n$p \\cdot r_1 = \\hbar$\nTherefore, the momentum of the electron is:\n$p = \\frac{\\hbar}{r_1} = \\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}$\n\nSubstituting the value of the Bohr radius:\n$p = \\frac{\\hbar}{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}$\n\n**Step 3: Find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to its momentum ($\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$).**\n\nNow we can set up the ratio using the expressions we derived in the previous steps:\nRatio = $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{r_1}}$\n\nWe can simplify this expression by canceling out the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$):\nRatio = $\\frac{r_1}{2 \\Delta x}$\n\nNow, substitute the numerical values for $r_1$ and $\\Delta x$:\n*   $r_1 = a_0 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n*   $\\Delta x = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$\n\nRatio = $\\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})}$\n\nThe factor of $10^{-11}$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\nRatio = $\\frac{5.29}{2}$\n\nRatio = $2.645$\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Correct Formula for Uncertainty:** It is crucial to use the standard inequality $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$ and assume the minimum uncertainty for the calculation.\n*   **Unit Consistency:** All values must be in SI units before calculation. The position uncertainty was given in picometers (pm) and needed to be converted to meters (m).\n*   **Momentum in Bohr Model:** The momentum is not given directly but must be derived from the quantization of angular momentum ($L=n\\hbar$).\n*   **Symbolic Simplification:** Simplifying the ratio expression algebraically before plugging in numbers ($\\text{Ratio} = r_1 / (2 \\Delta x)$) makes the calculation easier and less prone to error, as the value of $\\hbar$ is not needed.\n\nThe final ratio is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
