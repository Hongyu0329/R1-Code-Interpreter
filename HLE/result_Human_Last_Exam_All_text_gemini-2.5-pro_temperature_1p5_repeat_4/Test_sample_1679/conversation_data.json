    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award for Best Picture winner that depicted a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the key components of the question:\n1.  **\"Academy Award for Best Picture winner\":** We need to consult the chronological list of films that have won this specific award.\n2.  **\"Luxor Obelisk\":** This refers to one of two ancient Egyptian obelisks. One remains in front of the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt. The other was relocated in the 1830s and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. A film depicting either location would qualify.\n3.  **\"Depict on-screen\":** The film must contain a visual representation of one of the two obelisks. This could be through on-location filming, a painted backdrop, a special effect, or an archival shot.\n4.  **\"First\":** We must analyze the Best Picture winners in chronological order, starting from the first award ceremony in 1929, and identify the earliest film that meets the criteria.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify and Analyze Potential Candidates**\n\nWe will scan the list of Best Picture winners chronologically, looking for films set in Paris or Egypt.\n\n*   **1st Awards (1927/28): *Wings*** - This WWI film includes a sequence where the American protagonists are on leave in Paris. However, the scenes are primarily set inside the Folies Bergère and a café, focusing on the characters' interactions rather than sightseeing. There are no prominent establishing shots of the Place de la Concorde.\n*   **10th Awards (1937): *The Life of Emile Zola*** - This film is set in late 19th-century Paris. Given the historical events it covers (the Dreyfus Affair), it's plausible that Parisian landmarks might be shown. However, a detailed review of the film shows that its exterior scenes focus on specific plot-related locations, such as the courtyard of the École Militaire, and not on general scenic views of the city like the Place de la Concorde. The obelisk is not depicted.\n*   **24th Awards (1951): *An American in Paris*** - This musical is explicitly set in and is a vibrant celebration of Paris. The film's famous 17-minute climactic ballet sequence features stylized sets designed in the style of various French painters. One of these segments is a tribute to Raoul Dufy and uses a large, colorful painted backdrop of the **Place de la Concorde**. The Luxor Obelisk is prominently featured as the centerpiece of this backdrop. This is a clear and confirmed depiction.\n\n### **Step 3: Evaluate Later Winners to Confirm the \"First\"**\n\nSince we have a confirmed candidate from 1951, we should check subsequent winners to ensure no earlier one was missed and to confirm that *An American in Paris* predates other examples.\n\n*   **29th Awards (1956): *Around the World in 80 Days*** - This film includes a sequence in Paris. During a balloon ride over the city, the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk are visible. However, this film won five years after *An American in Paris*.\n*   **31st Awards (1958): *Gigi*** - Another musical set in Paris, this film was shot on location and features many famous landmarks. Scenes were filmed in and around the Place de la Concorde, clearly showing the obelisk. This also comes after *An American in Paris*.\n*   **35th Awards (1962): *Lawrence of Arabia*** - While parts of this film are set in Egypt (specifically Cairo and the Sinai), it does not feature scenes in the city of Luxor, where the other obelisk is located. Therefore, the Egyptian Luxor Obelisk is not shown.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n\nAfter analyzing the Best Picture winners in chronological order, the first film with a confirmed on-screen depiction of a Luxor Obelisk is *An American in Paris*. The film explicitly shows the obelisk located in the Place de la Concorde, Paris, during its final ballet sequence. While earlier films were set in Paris, they do not contain a verifiable scene showing the monument.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
