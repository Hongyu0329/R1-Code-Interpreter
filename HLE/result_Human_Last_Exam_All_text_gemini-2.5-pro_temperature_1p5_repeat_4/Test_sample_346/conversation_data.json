    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression to find the value of `n` and then `log_2(n)`.\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Combinators and Church Numerals**\n\nFirst, let's define the behavior of the core combinators and the representation of Church numerals.\n\n*   **Combinators:**\n    *   `I x = x` (Identity)\n    *   `K x y = x` (Constant)\n    *   `S x y z = x z (y z)` (Substitution)\n\n*   **Derived Combinators:**\n    *   `B = S(K S) K`: This is the function composition combinator. `B f g x = f (g x)`.\n    *   `M = S I I`: This is the self-application or mockingbird combinator. `M x = x x`.\n\n*   **Church Numerals:** A Church numeral `n` is a higher-order function that applies a function `f` to a value `x`, `n` times. The general form is `n_c = λf.λx. f^n(x)`.\n    *   `0_c = λf.λx. x`\n    *   `1_c = λf.λx. f x`. In SKI, this is equivalent to `I`.\n    *   `2_c = λf.λx. f (f x)`.\n\n*   **Operations on Church Numerals:**\n    *   **Exponentiation (`m^n`):** Applying the numeral `n` to the numeral `m`, written as `n m`, results in the numeral for `m^n`. That is, `(m^n)_c = n_c m_c`.\n    *   **Multiplication (`m * n`):** Can be represented as `B m n` (composition).\n    *   **Addition (`m + n`):** Can be represented as `λf.λx. m f (n f x)`.\n    *   **Successor (`n + 1`):** `SUCC n_c = λf.λx. f (n_c f x)`. The expression `S B n_c` evaluates to the numeral `n+1`. `(S B n_c) f x = B f (n_c f) x = f((n_c f) x)`.\n\n**2. Analyzing Key Sub-expressions**\n\nLet's break down the given expression:\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`\n\nLet's identify the recurring complex parts:\n*   `Op = S(S(K(S))(K))`: This is the combinator `S B`.\n*   `M = S(I)(I)`: This is the self-application combinator `M`.\n\n**Crucial Insight: `Op` is a Church Numeral**\n\nThe expression `Op = S B` is not just an operator; it is the SKI representation of the Church numeral **2**.\nLet's verify this:\n`Op f x = (S B) f x = B f f x = f (f x)`.\nThis is precisely the definition of `2_c`. Therefore, `Op = 2_c`.\n\n**3. Parsing the Main Expression**\n\nThe expression has the form `S u v w`, which reduces as `u w (v w)`.\n*   `u = I`\n*   `v = S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))` where `A = Op I`.\n*   `w = S(Op)(M)`.\n\nThe reduction is `I w (v w)`, which simplifies to `w (v w)`.\n\nLet's analyze the inner function `v`. It has the form `λg. S(I)(S(I)(K A)) g`.\n`v g = I g (S(I)(K A) g)`\n`   = g (I g (K A g))`\n`   = g (g (A))`\nSo, `v = λg. g(g A)`.\n\nThe reduction `w (v w)` becomes `w ( (λg. g(g A)) w )`, which evaluates to `w(w(w A))`.\n\n**4. Evaluating the Components `A` and `w`**\n\nNow we need to determine the values of `A` and the function `w`.\n\n*   **Evaluating A:**\n    `A = Op I = 2_c 1_c`.\n    This is the application of numeral `2_c` to `1_c`, which corresponds to exponentiation `1^2`.\n    `1^2 = 1`.\n    So, `A = 1_c`.\n\n*   **Evaluating w:**\n    `w = S Op M = S 2_c M`.\n    `w` is a function that takes a Church numeral `n_c` and transforms it. Let's see its action:\n    `w n_c = (S 2_c M) n_c`\n    `     = (2_c n_c) (M n_c)` (by the rule of `S`)\n\n    Now we evaluate the two parts of this application:\n    1.  `2_c n_c`: Application of numeral `2_c` to `n_c`. This is exponentiation: `n^2`. So this term is `(n^2)_c`.\n    2.  `M n_c`: Application of the self-application combinator `M` to `n_c`. `M n_c = n_c n_c`. This is the application of numeral `n_c` to itself, which is exponentiation `n^n`. So this term is `(n^n)_c`.\n\n    Putting them together, `w n_c = (n^2)_c (n^n)_c`. This is another exponentiation:\n    `base = (n^n)_c`, `exponent = (n^2)_c`.\n    The result is `(n^n)^(n^2)`.\n    Using the exponent rule `(a^b)^c = a^(b*c)`, this simplifies to `n^(n * n^2) = n^(n^3)`.\n    So, `w` is a function that transforms a numeral `n` into `n^(n^3)`. Let's call this transformation `g(n) = n^(n^3)`.\n\n**5. Calculating the Final Value `n`**\n\nThe expression `E` represents the Church numeral `n`, which we found is `w(w(w(A)))`.\nLet `n_0 = A = 1_c`. We apply the function `w` (or `g`) three times.\n\n*   `n_1 = w(n_0) = g(1) = 1^(1^3) = 1^1 = 1`.\n*   `n_2 = w(n_1) = g(1) = 1^(1^3) = 1^1 = 1`.\n*   `n_3 = w(n_2) = g(1) = 1^(1^3) = 1^1 = 1`.\n\nThe resulting Church numeral `E` is `1_c`. Therefore, the integer `n` is 1.\n\n**6. Final Answer**\n\nThe question asks for the value of `log_2(n)`.\nSince `n = 1`, we need to calculate `log_2(1)`.\n\n`log_2(1) = 0`."
