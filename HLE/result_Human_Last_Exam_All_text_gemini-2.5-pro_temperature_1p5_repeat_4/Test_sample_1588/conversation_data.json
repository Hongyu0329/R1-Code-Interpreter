    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula\nThe BCH formula gives an expression for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$ where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables. The formula is an infinite series:\n$Z = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty Z_n(X, Y)$\nwhere $Z_n(X, Y)$ is a homogeneous Lie polynomial of degree $n$, meaning it's a linear combination of nested commutators involving a total of $n$ instances of $X$ and $Y$. The problem asks for the number of nonzero coefficients in the expression for $Z_{10}$.\n\n### Step 2: Symmetry Properties of the BCH series\nThe BCH series has several important symmetry properties. One crucial property is:\n$Z(X, Y) = -Z(-Y, -X)$\nLet's analyze the consequence of this property for the term of order $n$, $Z_n$.\nA Lie polynomial $P(X,Y)$ of degree $n$ satisfies $P(-Y, -X) = (-1)^n P(Y, X)$.\nSubstituting this into the symmetry relation for $Z_n$, we get:\n$Z_n(X, Y) = -Z_n(-Y, -X) = -(-1)^n Z_n(Y, X)$\nFor order $n=10$ (which is even), the relation becomes:\n$Z_{10}(X, Y) = -(-1)^{10} Z_{10}(Y, X) = -Z_{10}(Y, X)$\nThis equation shows that $Z_{10}$ is **anti-symmetric** with respect to the exchange of $X$ and $Y$.\n\n### Step 3: Basis of the Free Lie Algebra and Consequences of Symmetry\nThe space of all Lie polynomials of degree 10, denoted $L_{10}(X,Y)$, is a vector space. We can choose a basis for this space. Let $\\pi$ be the linear operator that swaps $X$ and $Y$, i.e., $\\pi(P(X,Y)) = P(Y,X)$. Since $\\pi^2$ is the identity, its eigenvalues are +1 and -1.\nWe can choose a basis for $L_{10}(X,Y)$ consisting of eigenvectors of $\\pi$.\n*   **Symmetric basis elements** $P_s$ satisfy $\\pi(P_s) = P_s$.\n*   **Anti-symmetric basis elements** $P_a$ satisfy $\\pi(P_a) = -P_a$.\n\nIf we express $Z_{10}$ in such a basis, $Z_{10} = \\sum c_s P_s + \\sum c_a P_a$. Applying the symmetry property from Step 2:\n$\\pi(Z_{10}) = \\sum c_s \\pi(P_s) + \\sum c_a \\pi(P_a) = \\sum c_s P_s - \\sum c_a P_a$\nBut we know $\\pi(Z_{10}) = -Z_{10} = -\\sum c_s P_s - \\sum c_a P_a$.\nComparing the two expressions, we must have $\\sum c_s P_s = -\\sum c_s P_s$, which implies that all coefficients $c_s$ of the symmetric basis elements are zero. The coefficients $c_a$ of the anti-symmetric elements are not constrained.\n\nA key result by A. Murua (2013) states that for a standard basis (e.g., a Hall basis constructed from Lyndon words), these are the only systematic zeros. That is, the coefficient of a basis element is zero if and only if $n$ is even and the element is symmetric.\nTherefore, the number of non-zero coefficients in $Z_{10}$ is equal to the number of anti-symmetric basis elements, which is the dimension of the anti-symmetric subspace of $L_{10}(X,Y)$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Dimension of the Anti-Symmetric Subspace\nLet $d_{10}$ be the total dimension of $L_{10}(X,Y)$. Let $S_{10}$ and $A_{10}$ be the dimensions of the symmetric and anti-symmetric subspaces, respectively. We have:\n$d_{10} = S_{10} + A_{10}$\nThe dimension of the anti-symmetric subspace is given by:\n$A_{10} = \\frac{1}{2} (d_{10} - \\text{Tr}(\\pi|_{L_{10}}))$\nwhere $\\text{Tr}(\\pi|_{L_{10}})$ is the trace of the swap operator $\\pi$ on the space $L_{10}$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Total Dimension $d_{10}$\nThe dimension of the free Lie algebra on two generators is given by Witt's formula:\n$d_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k|n} \\mu(k) 2^{n/k}$, where $\\mu$ is the Möbius function.\nFor $n=10$, the divisors are $k \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$. The Möbius function values are $\\mu(1)=1$, $\\mu(2)=-1$, $\\mu(5)=-1$, $\\mu(10)=1$.\n$d_{10} = \\frac{1}{10} (\\mu(1)2^{10/1} + \\mu(2)2^{10/2} + \\mu(5)2^{10/5} + \\mu(10)2^{10/10})$\n$d_{10} = \\frac{1}{10} (1 \\cdot 2^{10} - 1 \\cdot 2^5 - 1 \\cdot 2^2 + 1 \\cdot 2^1)$\n$d_{10} = \\frac{1}{10} (1024 - 32 - 4 + 2) = \\frac{990}{10} = 99$.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Trace Tr($\\pi|_{L_{10}}$)\nThe trace of a linear map $g$ on $L_n(V)$ is given by the formula $\\text{Tr}(g|_{L_n}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) p_d^{n/d}$, where $p_d = \\text{Tr}(g^d)$ on the underlying vector space $V$.\nIn our case, $g=\\pi$ and $V$ is the 2D space spanned by $X, Y$. The matrix of $\\pi$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe traces of the powers of $\\pi$ are:\n$p_d = \\text{Tr}(\\pi^d)$. Since $\\pi^2=I$, we have $\\pi^d=I$ for even $d$ and $\\pi^d=\\pi$ for odd $d$.\n$p_d = \\text{Tr}(\\pi) = 0$ if $d$ is odd.\n$p_d = \\text{Tr}(I) = 2$ if $d$ is even.\nFor $n=10$, the divisors are $d \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n$p_1=0$, $p_2=2$, $p_5=0$, $p_{10}=2$.\n$\\text{Tr}(\\pi|_{L_{10}}) = \\frac{1}{10} (\\mu(1)p_1^{10} + \\mu(2)p_2^5 + \\mu(5)p_5^2 + \\mu(10)p_{10}^1)$\n$\\text{Tr}(\\pi|_{L_{10}}) = \\frac{1}{10} (1 \\cdot 0^{10} - 1 \\cdot 2^5 - 1 \\cdot 0^2 + 1 \\cdot 2^1)$\n$\\text{Tr}(\\pi|_{L_{10}}) = \\frac{1}{10} (0 - 32 - 0 + 2) = \\frac{-30}{10} = -3$.\n\n### Step 7: Final Calculation\nNow we can find the dimension of the anti-symmetric subspace $A_{10}$.\n$A_{10} = \\frac{1}{2} (d_{10} - \\text{Tr}(\\pi|_{L_{10}}))$\n$A_{10} = \\frac{1}{2} (99 - (-3)) = \\frac{1}{2} (102) = 51$.\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is the dimension of the anti-symmetric subspace of $L_{10}(X,Y)$, which is 51."
