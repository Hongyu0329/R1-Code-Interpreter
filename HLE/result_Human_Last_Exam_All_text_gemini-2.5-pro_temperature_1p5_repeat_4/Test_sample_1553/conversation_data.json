    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Main Character:** The protagonist and main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) is Adam Zamoyski, a man from the 21st century who has been cryogenically frozen and resurrected in the distant future.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Concept of \"Marriage\" in the Novel's Context:** The world of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is a far-future, post-human civilization. Concepts like marriage are not the same as their 21st-century counterparts. In this context, \"marriage\" would refer to a deep, permanent, and transformative union between beings, often involving technological and biological integration.\n\n3.  **Identify the Main Character's Significant Relationship:** Throughout the novel, Adam Zamoyski is guided, protected, and educated by a powerful post-human entity. This character is his constant companion and their relationship is central to the plot.\n\n4.  **Identify the Name of the Character:** The name of this post-human entity who forms a deep bond with Adam Zamoyski is Angelina.\n\n5.  **Confirm the Union/Marriage:** Towards the climax of the novel, Adam and Angelina's relationship culminates in a profound union. They merge or integrate in a way that binds them together permanently. This event is the narrative's equivalent of a marriage, sealing their partnership and transforming them both.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **The Main Character's Identity:** It's crucial to correctly identify the protagonist as Adam Zamoyski.\n*   **The Nature of the \"Marriage\":** One must understand that the term \"marriage\" is used as an analogy for the unique, technologically-mediated union that occurs in the novel. It is not a traditional ceremony.\n*   **Character Names:** Accurately recalling the name of Adam's partner, Angelina, is key to answering the question. The relationship between Adam and Angelina is the core emotional arc of the story.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the main character, Adam Zamoyski, enters into a permanent union, which can be described as a marriage, with the post-human character named Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
