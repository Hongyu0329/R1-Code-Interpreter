    "An analysis of the question step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n1.  **Semidihedral Group:** The semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted as $SD_{2^n}$, is defined by the presentation:\n    $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    For this question, the group size is 512. So, $2^n = 512$, which implies $n=9$.\n    The group is $G = SD_{512}$, with the presentation:\n    $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i s^j$ where $0 \\le i < 256$ and $j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. There are $256 \\times 2 = 512$ elements.\n\n2.  **Power Subgroup:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it is the image of a power map, i.e., if there exists an integer $k \\ge 1$ such that $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct such subgroups.\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the Problem by Analyzing the Exponent `k`\nThe set of distinct power subgroups is given by $\\{G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. To simplify the problem, we analyze the structure of $G^k$. Let $k$ be any positive integer. We can write $k = 2^j \\cdot m$, where $m$ is an odd integer and $j \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the case when the exponent is an odd number, $m$. The elements of $G^m$ are $\\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We can split this into two parts based on the form of the elements in $G$:\n*   Powers of elements in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$: $\\{ (r^i)^m \\mid 0 \\le i < 256 \\}$. Since $m$ is odd, $\\gcd(m, 256) = 1$. Thus, the mapping $x \\mapsto x^m$ is a permutation of the cyclic group $\\langle r \\rangle \\cong C_{256}$. This means $\\{ (r^i)^m \\} = \\langle r \\rangle$.\n*   Powers of elements not in $\\langle r \\rangle$: $\\{ (r^i s)^m \\mid 0 \\le i < 256 \\}$. Since $m$ is odd, let $m=2l+1$. We first need a formula for powers of elements of the form $r^i s$.\n    *   Using the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we can derive $sr^i s = r^{127i}$.\n    *   $(r^i s)^2 = r^i s r^i s = r^i (sr^i s) = r^i r^{127i} = r^{128i}$.\n    *   $(r^i s)^m = (r^i s)^{2l+1} = ((r^i s)^2)^l (r^i s) = (r^{128i})^l (r^i s) = r^{128il} r^i s = r^{i(128l+1)}s$.\n    The set of exponents for $r$ is $\\{ i(128l+1) \\pmod{256} \\mid 0 \\le i < 256 \\}$. Since $128l+1$ is odd, $\\gcd(128l+1, 256) = 1$. Therefore, the mapping $i \\mapsto i(128l+1) \\pmod{256}$ is a permutation of $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 255\\}$. This means the set $\\{ (r^i s)^m \\}$ is equal to the set $\\{ r^j s \\mid 0 \\le j < 256 \\}$.\n\nCombining these two parts, for any odd $m$, $G^m = \\langle r \\rangle \\cup \\{ r^j s \\} = G$.\n\nNow, let's consider the general case $k=2^j \\cdot m$.\n$G^k = G^{m \\cdot 2^j} = \\{ g^{m \\cdot 2^j} \\mid g \\in G \\} = \\{ (g^m)^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G \\}$.\nSince the set $\\{ g^m \\mid g \\in G \\}$ is the entire group $G$, we can write:\n$G^k = \\{ h^{2^j} \\mid h \\in G \\} = G^{2^j}$.\n\nThis crucial result means that the set of all power subgroups is identical to the set of power subgroups where the exponent is a power of 2. That is, $\\{G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} = \\{G^{2^j} \\mid j \\in \\mathbb{N}_0\\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Distinct Power Subgroups $G^{2^j}$\nThe exponent of the group $G$ is $\\exp(G) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{orders of all elements})$. The orders of elements in $\\langle r \\rangle$ are divisors of 256. The orders of elements $r^i s$ are either 2 or 4. Thus, $\\exp(G) = 256 = 2^8$. This means $G^{256} = \\{1\\}$, and for any $j>8$, $G^{2^j}=\\{1\\}$. So we only need to consider $j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$.\n\nLet's compute $G^{2^j}$ for these values of $j$:\n*   **j=0 (k=1):** $G^1 = G = SD_{512}$.\n*   **j=1 (k=2):** $G^2 = \\{ g^2 \\mid g \\in G \\} = \\{ (r^i)^2 \\} \\cup \\{ (r^i s)^2 \\}$.\n    *   $\\{ (r^i)^2 \\} = \\{ r^{2i} \\} = \\langle r^2 \\rangle \\cong C_{128}$.\n    *   $\\{ (r^i s)^2 \\} = \\{ r^{128i} \\} = \\{1, r^{128}\\}$.\n    *   Since $r^{128} = (r^2)^{64}$, $r^{128}$ is in $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$. So, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n*   **j=2 (k=4):** $G^4 = \\{ g^4 \\mid g \\in G \\} = \\{ (r^i)^4 \\} \\cup \\{ (r^i s)^4 \\}$.\n    *   $\\{ (r^i)^4 \\} = \\{ r^{4i} \\} = \\langle r^4 \\rangle \\cong C_{64}$.\n    *   $(r^i s)^4 = ((r^i s)^2)^2 = (r^{128i})^2 = r^{256i} = 1$.\n    *   So, $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle \\cup \\{1\\} = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$.\n*   **j > 2 (k=$2^j$):** $G^{2^j} = \\{ g^{2^j} \\} = \\{ (r^i)^{2^j} \\} \\cup \\{ (r^i s)^{2^j} \\}$.\n    *   $\\{ (r^i)^{2^j} \\} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    *   $(r^i s)^{2^j} = ((r^i s)^2)^{2^{j-1}} = (r^{128i})^{2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 128 \\cdot 2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^7 \\cdot 2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{j+6}}$.\n    *   Since the order of $r$ is $256=2^8$, the term is 1 if the exponent is a multiple of 256. This is true if $j+6 \\ge 8$, which means $j \\ge 2$.\n    *   So for all $j \\ge 2$, $(r^i s)^{2^j} = 1$.\n    *   Therefore, for $j \\ge 2$, $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle \\cup \\{1\\} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n\n### Step 4: List and Count the Distinct Subgroups\nWe have found the following set of power subgroups:\n1.  $G^1 = G = SD_{512}$ (order 512)\n2.  $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (order 128)\n3.  $G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$ (order 64)\n4.  $G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n5.  $G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$ (order 16)\n6.  $G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$ (order 8)\n7.  $G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n8.  $G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n9.  $G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (order 1)\n\nAll these subgroups have different orders, so they are all distinct. There are 9 distinct power subgroups.\n\nFinal Answer Checklist:\n1.  Correctly identified the group $SD_{512}$.\n2.  Correctly reduced the problem to exponents of the form $2^j$.\n3.
