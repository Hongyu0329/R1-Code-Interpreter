    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **$X$ is a finite ultrametric space:** $X$ is a set with a finite number of points, let's say $|X|=n$. It is equipped with a distance function $d: X \\times X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the standard metric axioms plus the strong triangle inequality (ultrametric inequality): $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ for all $x, y, z \\in X$.\n    *   **$B$ is a Banach space of cardinality $K$:** $B$ is a complete normed vector space over a field (typically $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$). The distance in $B$ is given by $d_B(u, v) = \\|u-v\\|_B$. The cardinality of the set $B$ is $K$.\n    *   **Isometric Embedding:** A function $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding if it preserves distances, i.e., for all $x, y \\in X$, we have $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d(x, y)$.\n    *   **The Goal:** We need to find the *smallest possible number* of such isometric embeddings. The wording implies that we are free to choose the space $X$ (as long as it's a finite ultrametric space) and the Banach space $B$ to make the number of embeddings as small as possible. Let this number be $N$. We are looking for $\\min_{X, B} N$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Number of Embeddings:**\n    *   Let's assume we have found one isometric embedding, $f: X \\to B$.\n    *   Consider the structure of the Banach space $B$. Since it's a vector space, we can perform translations. For any vector $b_0 \\in B$, let's define a new function $f_{b_0}: X \\to B$ by $f_{b_0}(x) = f(x) + b_0$.\n    *   Let's check if $f_{b_0}$ is also an isometric embedding:\n        $\\|f_{b_0}(x) - f_{b_0}(y)\\|_B = \\|(f(x) + b_0) - (f(y) + b_0)\\|_B = \\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B$.\n    *   Since $f$ is an isometric embedding, $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d(x, y)$. Therefore, $\\|f_{b_0}(x) - f_{b_0}(y)\\|_B = d(x, y)$, which means $f_{b_0}$ is also an isometric embedding for any $b_0 \\in B$.\n    *   Each distinct choice of $b_0 \\in B$ gives a distinct function $f_{b_0}$ (since if $b_1 \\ne b_2$, then $f(x) + b_1 \\ne f(x) + b_2$).\n    *   This means that the number of isometric embeddings is at least the cardinality of the Banach space $B$, which is $K$.\n    *   So, if we find one embedding, we find $K$ embeddings.\n\n3.  **Consider the Cardinality K:**\n    *   A Banach space is typically defined over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$.\n    *   If a Banach space $B$ is non-trivial (i.e., $B \\neq \\{0\\}$), it must contain a non-zero vector $v$. Then the set $\\{\\lambda v \\mid \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$ (or $\\mathbb{C}$) is an infinite subset of $B$. Therefore, any non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ has infinite cardinality (in fact, at least the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$).\n    *   So, if we choose any $X$ that requires a non-trivial Banach space $B$ for an embedding (i.e., if $|X| > 1$), then $K$ must be infinite. In this case, the number of isometric embeddings would also be infinite.\n    *   This suggests that to get a finite number of embeddings, we must explore the case where $B$ is the trivial Banach space.\n\n4.  **The Trivial Case:**\n    *   Let's choose the simplest possible Banach space: the zero space $B = \\{0\\}$.\n    *   **Is $B=\\{0\\}$ a Banach space?** Yes. It's a vector space, the only possible norm is $\\|0\\|=0$, and it's complete (any sequence in it is the constant sequence $(0,0,\\dots)$, which converges to $0$). Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n    *   Now, if we embed a space $X$ into $B=\\{0\\}$, the embedding function $f$ must map every point $x \\in X$ to the zero vector, i.e., $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in X$.\n    *   **When is this map an isometry?** The condition for an isometric embedding is $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d(x, y)$ for all $x,y \\in X$.\n        *   Substituting $f(x)=0$ and $f(y)=0$, we get $\\|0 - 0\\|_B = d(x, y)$.\n        *   This simplifies to $0 = d(x, y)$ for all $x, y \\in X$.\n    *   The metric axiom $d(x,y)=0 \\iff x=y$ means that if the distance between any two points is zero, they must be the same point. This forces the space $X$ to have only one point.\n    *   Let's choose the simplest finite ultrametric space: a single-point space $X = \\{p\\}$.\n        *   **Is $X=\\{p\\}$ an ultrametric space?** The only distance is $d(p,p)=0$. This satisfies all metric axioms, and the ultrametric inequality $d(p,p) \\le \\max(d(p,p), d(p,p))$ holds since $0 \\le \\max(0,0)$. So, it is a valid choice.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Minimal Case:**\n    *   Let's choose $X = \\{p\\}$, a one-point space. This is a finite ultrametric space.\n    *   Let's choose $B = \\{0\\}$, the trivial Banach space. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n    *   How many isometric embeddings are there from $X$ to $B$?\n        *   An embedding is a function $f: \\{p\\} \\to \\{0\\}$. There is only one such function: the one that maps $p$ to $0$. Let's call it $f_0$. So $f_0(p)=0$.\n        *   We already verified that this function is an isometry because $\\|f_0(p) - f_0(p)\\|_B = \\|0-0\\|_B = 0$, and $d(p,p)=0$.\n    *   Therefore, for this specific choice of $X$ and $B$, there is exactly **one** isometric embedding.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   We have found a valid pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is 1.\n    *   Can the number be 0? No. For any finite ultrametric space $X$, an isometric embedding into some Banach space is known to exist (for example, into $\\ell_\\infty(|X|)$). So the number of embeddings is always at least 1 for a suitable choice of $B$.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 1. This minimum is achieved when the ultrametric space is a single point and the Banach space is the zero space. Any other choice of a non-trivial space $X$ (with more than one point) would require a non-trivial Banach space $B$, which would immediately lead to an infinite number of embeddings. The minimum of the set $\\{1, \\infty\\}$ is 1.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 1. This occurs when $X$ is a one-point space and $B$ is the trivial Banach space $\\{0\\}$. In this case, there is exactly one function from $X$ to $B$, and it is an isometric embedding.\n\n<<<1>>>"
