    "Answering this question requires analyzing how the rank of the Neron-Severi group of a symmetric power of a curve depends on the curve itself.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the object and the quantity of interest.**\n    *   The object is `X = C^(15)`, the 15th symmetric power of a curve `C`.\n    *   `C` is a Riemann surface (a smooth complex projective curve) of genus `g=3`.\n    *   We want to find the range of possible values for the rank of the Neron-Severi group of `X`, denoted `\\rho(X)`. This rank is also known as the Picard number of `X`.\n\n2.  **Relate the Neron-Severi group of `X` to properties of the curve `C`.**\n    *   The Neron-Severi group `NS(X)` consists of divisor classes on `X` modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank `\\rho(X)` is the dimension of the rational vector space `NS(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}`.\n    *   By the Lefschetz (1,1)-theorem, `NS(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}` can be identified with the space of Hodge classes of degree 2, i.e., `H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cap H^{1,1}(X)`. So `\\rho(X) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) \\cap H^{1,1}(X))`.\n    *   For the `n`-th symmetric power `C^(n)` of a curve `C`, there is a well-known isomorphism for the second cohomology group, due to Macdonald:\n        `H^2(C^(n), \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong H^2(C, \\mathbb{Q}) \\oplus \\Lambda^2 H^1(C, \\mathbb{Q})`\n        This isomorphism respects the Hodge structures. The dimension `n=15` is large enough for this to hold (`n \\ge 2` is sufficient).\n    *   We can analyze the Hodge classes in each component separately:\n        a.  The first component is `H^2(C, \\mathbb{Q})`. The complexification `H^2(C, \\mathbb{C})` is purely of type (1,1), meaning `H^2(C, \\mathbb{C}) = H^{1,1}(C)`. Therefore, the rational space `H^2(C, \\mathbb{Q})` consists entirely of Hodge classes. Its dimension is `b_2(C) = 1`. This component always contributes 1 to `\\rho(X)`.\n        b.  The second component is `\\Lambda^2 H^1(C, \\mathbb{Q})`. The Hodge structure on this space is the same as the Hodge structure on `H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})`, where `J(C)` is the Jacobian of `C`. The space of Hodge classes in `H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})` is precisely `NS(J(C)) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}`. The dimension of this space is `\\rho(J(C))`.\n    *   Combining these two parts, we get a key formula:\n        `\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^(15)) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))`\n\n3.  **Reduce the problem.**\n    The problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for `\\rho(J(C))`, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve `C`. The Jacobian `J(C)` is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety.\n\n4.  **Find the smallest possible rank `\\rho(J(C))`.**\n    *   For any abelian variety `A`, `\\rho(A) \\ge 1`, as it must contain at least the class of an ample divisor (the polarization).\n    *   For a *very general* curve `C` of genus `g`, its Jacobian `J(C)` is simple and has the smallest possible endomorphism ring, `End(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}`.\n    *   In this case, the Neron-Severi group `NS(J(C))` is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). Thus, `\\rho(J(C)) = 1`.\n    *   This is the minimum possible value.\n    *   So, the smallest possible rank for `\\rho(X)` is `1 + \\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\n5.  **Find the largest possible rank `\\rho(J(C))`.**\n    *   The Picard number `\\rho(A)` of a `g`-dimensional abelian variety `A` is bounded by its second Betti number `b_2(A)` and its Hodge number `h^{1,1}(A)`.\n    *   For `A=J(C)` with `g=3`, `b_2(J(C)) = \\binom{2g}{2} = \\binom{6}{2} = 15`.\n    *   `h^{1,1}(J(C)) = g^2 = 3^2 = 9`.\n    *   Since `NS(J(C)) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}` is a subspace of `H^{1,1}(J(C)) \\cap H^2(J(C), \\mathbb{Q})`, we must have `\\rho(J(C)) \\le h^{1,1}(J(C))`. Thus, `\\rho(J(C)) \\le 9`.\n    *   The rank `\\rho(J(C))` is larger than 1 when `J(C)` has \"extra\" endomorphisms, a condition known as Complex Multiplication (CM). The maximum value of `\\rho(J(C))=g^2=9` is achieved if `J(C)` is an abelian variety of CM-type for which all Hodge classes are algebraic.\n    *   We need to determine if there exists a genus 3 curve `C` for which `\\rho(J(C)) = 9`.\n    *   Consider the Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation `x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0`. Its genus is `g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3`.\n    *   The Jacobian of this curve, `J(C)`, is known to be isogenous to the product of three copies of an elliptic curve `E`, `J(C) \\sim E \\times E \\times E = E^3`. The elliptic curve `E` is the one with `j`-invariant 1728, which has Complex Multiplication by the Gaussian integers `\\mathbb{Z}[i]`.\n    *   Now we calculate `\\rho(E^3)`. For a self-product of an elliptic curve, the Picard number is given by `\\rho(E^n) = n\\rho(E) + \\binom{n}{2} \\text{rank}(\\text{End}(E))`.\n    *   For our elliptic curve `E` with CM by `\\mathbb{Z}[i]`:\n        *   `\\rho(E) = 1` (The Neron-Severi group is generated by the class of a point).\n        *   `\\text{End}(E) = \\mathbb{Z}[i]`, which has rank 2 as a `\\mathbb{Z}`-module.\n    *   Plugging these values in for `n=3`:\n        `\\rho(E^3) = 3 \\cdot \\rho(E) + \\binom{3}{2} \\cdot \\text{rank}(\\text{End}(E))`\n        `\\rho(E^3) = 3 \\cdot 1 + 3 \\cdot 2 = 3 + 6 = 9`.\n    *   So, for the Fermat quartic curve, `\\rho(J(C)) = 9`. This achieves the maximum possible value.\n    *   Therefore, the largest possible rank for `\\rho(X)` is `1 + \\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy relating the Picard number of the symmetric power `X` to the Picard number of the Jacobian `J(C)`, we found that `\\rho(X) = 1 + \\rho(J(C))`. The rank `\\rho(J(C))` for a genus 3 curve ranges from 1 (for a very general curve) to 9 (for special curves with complex multiplication, such as the Fermat quartic).\n\n*   **Smallest rank:** `1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   **Largest rank:** `1 + 9 = 10`."
