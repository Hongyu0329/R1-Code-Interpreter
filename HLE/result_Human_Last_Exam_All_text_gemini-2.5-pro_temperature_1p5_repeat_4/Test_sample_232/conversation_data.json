    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the complete set of crease lines created when folding a standard origami crane and then count the number of regions these lines divide the original square paper into.\n\nThe most reliable method is to treat the creases as a planar graph and count the regions (faces). We can do this by systematically adding the creases based on the folding process and counting the regions added at each step. An alternative is to use Euler's formula for planar graphs, F = E - V + 1, where F is the number of regions (faces), E is the number of crease segments (edges), and V is the number of intersection points or endpoints (vertices). We will use a step-by-step region-counting approach, which is more intuitive.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the regions created:**\n\n1.  **Initial State:** We start with a single square piece of paper.\n    *   **Regions: 1**\n\n2.  **Preliminary Base Folds:** A standard crane begins with a \"preliminary base\" (or \"preliminary fold\"). This requires creasing the paper along its two diagonals and its horizontal and vertical midlines.\n    *   The first diagonal divides the square into 2 regions.\n    *   The second diagonal crosses the first at the center, passing through both existing regions and splitting each one, adding 2 more regions. Total = 4.\n    *   The horizontal midline passes through the center, crossing two of the four large triangular regions. It splits these two regions, adding 2 more. Total = 6.\n    *   The vertical midline also passes through the center, crossing two regions not yet crossed by a midline. It splits them, adding another 2 regions. Total = 8.\n    *   These four lines, all meeting at the center, divide the square into 8 triangular regions.\n    *   **Regions after Preliminary Folds: 8**\n\n3.  **Bird Base Folds:** The next stage is creating the \"bird base\". This is done by performing a \"petal fold\" on all four flaps of the preliminary base. On the unfolded paper, each petal fold corresponds to adding two new crease lines.\n    *   Let's consider one of the four main quadrants of the paper (e.g., the top-left square). This quadrant already has a diagonal crease from the preliminary folds, dividing it into two triangles. The petal fold is performed on this structure.\n    *   Looking at the complete crease pattern, the petal folds add 8 new lines in total. Each of these 8 lines starts at an existing vertex on the paper's edge and ends at an existing vertex on a diagonal crease. Each of these new crease lines is contained entirely within one of the 8 regions from the previous step.\n    *   When a single line segment is drawn inside a region connecting two points on its boundary, it divides that region into two.\n    *   Since we add 8 such crease lines, each into a different one of the 8 regions, we add 8 new regions.\n    *   Total regions = 8 (from preliminary base) + 8 (from petal folds) = 16.\n    *   **Regions after Bird Base Folds: 16**\n\n4.  **Head and Tail Folds:** The crane's head and tail are formed using \"inside reverse folds\" on two opposite flaps of the bird base.\n    *   An inside reverse fold adds a V-shaped pair of creases to the flat pattern.\n    *   This V-shape is located near a corner of the paper. Its vertex lies on a main diagonal, and its two arms extend to meet two adjacent petal-fold creases.\n    *   Each arm of the 'V' crosses into a different region from our count of 16. The first arm splits one region into two (+1 region), and the second arm splits an adjacent region into two (+1 region).\n    *   Therefore, forming the head adds 2 regions to the total.\n    *   The tail is formed similarly on the opposite flap, adding another 2 regions.\n    *   Total regions = 16 + 2 (for the head) + 2 (for the tail) = 20.\n    *   **Regions after Head/Tail Folds: 20**\n\n5.  **Wing Folds:** Finally, a standard crane has a single crease on each of the two wings to give them shape and fold them down slightly.\n    *   This adds one new crease line for each wing.\n    *   This crease connects the crane's \"body\" (a main diagonal on the paper) to the wing's edge (one of the petal-fold creases).\n    *   This single crease line is drawn within one of the existing regions, splitting it into two. So, each wing fold adds 1 new region.\n    *   Since there are two wings, we add 2 regions in total.\n    *   Total regions = 20 + 1 (for the first wing) + 1 (for the second wing) = 22.\n    *   **Regions after Wing Folds: 22**\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\n*   Initial Paper: 1 region\n*   After Preliminary Folds (2 diagonals, 2 midlines): 8 regions\n*   After Bird Base Folds (8 petal fold creases): 16 regions\n*   After Head and Tail Folds (2 sets of reverse folds): 20 regions\n*   After Wing Folds (2 shaping creases): 22 regions\n\nThe final number of regions the fold lines divide the paper into is 22.\n\n<<<22>>>"
