    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe first clue is a quote from the poet Andrei Voznesensky: \"a joy-discovering sailor\". This points to a historical figure who was an explorer or navigator, and whose story has a poetic or romantic element that Voznesensky found compelling. The phrase \"joy-discovering\" is not a standard historical descriptor, suggesting a poetic interpretation of the man's achievements or life.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nVoznesensky also wondered, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". This is a very specific detail. It tells us that at the time Voznesensky wrote his work, the exact burial place of this \"sailor\" was unknown or had been lost to history. This significantly narrows down the possibilities.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the first two clues.**\nThe quotes from Voznesensky come from his famous poem that was adapted into the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\"). This work tells the story of the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Rezanov. The title refers to the two ships of his expedition. The opera romanticizes his journey to California and his love affair with Concepción Argüello, which fits the poetic description \"joy-discovering sailor.\"\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third clue and verify it with the candidate.**\nThe third clue states that the location of the grave was discovered in the late 1980s. Let's check if this fits the story of Nikolai Rezanov.\n*   **Rezanov's Death and Burial:** He died in 1807 in the city of Krasnoyarsk while traveling across Siberia. He was buried at the Voskresensky Cathedral.\n*   **Loss of the Grave:** The cathedral was demolished by the Soviet authorities in the 20th century, and the precise location of his grave was lost. This confirms why Voznesensky would ask, \"Where is your grave?\".\n*   **Rediscovery:** Spurred by the immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos,\" there was renewed interest in Rezanov's fate. In the late 1980s, researchers identified the presumed location of his burial at the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk, where some remains from the old cathedral had been moved. A memorial was subsequently erected on the site, symbolically providing the \"answer\" to the poet's question.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The key is linking the specific poetic quotes to their source, which is Voznesensky's \"Juno and Avos.\"\n*   One must understand that \"sailor\" is used in a broad sense for a commander of a naval expedition, and \"joy-discovering\" refers to the romanticized, adventurous nature of his story.\n*   The detail about the grave being lost and then its location being re-established in the late 1980s is the definitive clue that confirms the identity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll the clues point directly to Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov, the protagonist of Voznesensky's famous work. The question asks for this man's last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
