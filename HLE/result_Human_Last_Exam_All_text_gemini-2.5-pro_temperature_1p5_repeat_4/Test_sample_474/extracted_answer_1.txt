No, this approach is not valid. The ecological function of bumblebee mimicry depends on the perception of their main predators, which are birds. Birds can see ultraviolet (UV) light, which humans cannot. Since bumblebee color patterns include UV signals that are part of the mimicry complex, human-based visual similarity rankings will not accurately capture the full signal perceived by predators. Therefore, the resulting clusters may not reflect the true, functional mimicry syndromes.
