a) For negligible interaction between molecules, the absorption cross-section is given by the equation:
`σ(ω) = C * N * ω * |**μ** ⋅ **e**|² * δ(ħω - E_e)`
where `C` is a constant of proportionality, `N` is the number of molecules in the chain, `ω` is the photon frequency, `**μ**` is the single-molecule transition dipole moment, `**e**` is the light polarization vector, `E_e` is the single-molecule excitation energy, and `δ` is the Dirac delta function.

b) When the interaction between near-neighbors is considered (with coupling energy `J`), the equation becomes:
`σ(ω) = C * N * ω * |**μ** ⋅ **e**|² * δ(ħω - (E_e + 2J))`
This shows that the entire absorption strength is concentrated into a single transition whose energy is shifted from the monomer energy by `2J`.
