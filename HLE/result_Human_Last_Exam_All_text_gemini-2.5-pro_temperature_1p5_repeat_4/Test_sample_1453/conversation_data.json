    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils are characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeating pattern, known as a heptad repeat, designated by the letters `a-b-c-d-e-f-g`. The core of the coiled-coil structure is formed by hydrophobic residues at positions `a` and `d`. These positions are critical for the stability and oligomeric state of the protein.\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe need to identify the correct frame for the heptad repeat by looking for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues at positions `a` and `d`. Let's examine the sequence for potential hydrophobic core residues (like L, I, A, V, M, W, F). The sequence contains many A, I, and L residues.\n\nLet's test possible alignments. A common pattern is `(a=hydrophobic)-x-x-(d=hydrophobic)-x-x-x`.\nLet's test the alignment where position 4 (A) is `a` and position 7 (L) is `d`.\n\n*   Sequence: `G E I **A** Q S **L** K E I **A** K S **L** K E I **A** W S **L** K E I **A** Q S **L** K G`\n*   Positions: `e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f`\n\nLet's list the residues at the key positions based on this alignment:\n*   **`a` positions:** A, A, A, A\n*   **`d` positions:** L, L, L, L\n*   **`e` positions:** K, K, K, K\n*   **`g` positions:** I, I, I, I\n\nThis alignment is very regular and consistent with a coiled-coil structure. The core positions `a` and `d` are consistently occupied by hydrophobic residues (Alanine and Leucine), while the flanking `e` and `g` positions are also consistently occupied (Lysine and Isoleucine). This is the most likely heptad repeat assignment.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Core Residues (`a` and `d`) for Knobs-into-Holes Packing**\n\nThe oligomeric state is primarily determined by how efficiently the side chains from the `a` and `d` positions can pack together. This is known as \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\n*   Residues at `a` positions are all **Alanine (A)**, which has a small hydrophobic side chain (-CH₃).\n*   Residues at `d` positions are all **Leucine (L)**, which has a larger, bulky hydrophobic side chain (-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂).\n\n**Step 3: Relate Packing Efficiency to Oligomeric State**\n\nWe now evaluate how this specific `a=A, d=L` pattern fits into the packing geometries of different oligomers.\n\n*   **Dimer (Oligomeric state = 2):**\n    In a parallel dimer, the hydrophobic core is formed by the interdigitation of residues from both helices. The `a` residue from one helix packs against the `d'` residue of the partner helix. The combination of a small knob (Alanine at `a`) and a large knob (Leucine at `d`) is ideal for dimeric coiled-coils. The small alanine fits neatly into the \"hole\" created by the bulkier leucine on the opposite chain, and vice versa. This creates a complementary and tightly packed hydrophobic core, minimizing empty space and steric clashes. This is a classic motif for stable dimers.\n\n*   **Trimer (Oligomeric state = 3):**\n    In a trimer, the three `a` position side chains pack against each other in the center of the core. Having a small residue like Alanine at all `a` positions would create a significant hollow cavity in the center of the structure. This is energetically unfavorable. Trimers are typically stabilized by having large, bulky hydrophobic residues (like Isoleucine or Leucine) at the `a` position to completely fill the central core. Therefore, the `a=A` pattern makes a trimer very unlikely.\n\n*   **Tetramer (Oligomeric state = 4):**\n    While some tetrameric arrangements could accommodate an `a=A, d=L` pattern, it is not the most typical or stable arrangement. The packing in tetramers is more complex, but the simple, complementary nature of this sequence strongly favors the dimeric arrangement.\n\n*   **Pentamer and Higher-Order Oligomers (Oligomeric state ≥ 5):**\n    These structures require more acute angles between the helices. To avoid steric clashes from the backbone, this geometry is strongly favored when one of the core positions (typically `d`) is occupied by a very small residue (like Alanine). Our sequence has the opposite: a large Leucine at the `d` position. This bulky residue would cause severe steric clashes in a pentameric or hexameric assembly.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the knobs-into-holes packing strongly indicates that the sequence is designed to form a dimer. The alternation of small Alanine residues at the `a` position and large Leucine residues at the `d` position allows for perfect packing complementarity in a two-stranded coiled-coil, which is the most efficient and stable arrangement for this pattern.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Correct Heptad Repeat Identification:** The entire analysis hinges on correctly identifying the `a` and `d` positions. An incorrect assignment would lead to the wrong conclusion. The pattern `a=A, d=L` is extremely regular and a strong indicator.\n*   **Side Chain Size and Shape:** The relative sizes of the side chains at the `a` and `d` positions are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state. Small `a` (Ala) + Large `d` (Leu) is a classic dimer signature.\n*   **Packing Geometry:** Understanding how the packing of the core differs between dimers, trimers, and higher-order oligomers is essential. Dimers use `a-d'` packing, while trimers are dominated by `a-a'` packing in the central core.\n*   **Electrostatic Interactions:** While the `e` and `g` positions (K and I in this case) contribute to stability, the hydrophobic core packing is the dominant force in determining the oligomeric state.\n\nThe most probable oligomeric state is 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
