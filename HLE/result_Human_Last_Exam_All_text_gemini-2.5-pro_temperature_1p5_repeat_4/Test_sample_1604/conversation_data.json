    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Artist**\nThe artist in question is Elizabeth Southerden Thompson, more famously known as Lady Butler (1846–1933). She was one of the most celebrated British painters of military scenes, known for her realistic and empathetic portrayals of soldiers.\n\n**Step 2: List Lady Butler's Major Battle Paintings**\nTo answer the question, we must identify her paintings that depict specific historical battles and then find the dates of those battles. Her career was long, and her subjects covered conflicts from the Napoleonic Wars to World War I.\n\nHere is a list of some of her most famous works and the historical events they portray:\n*   ***Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which occurred on **June 16, 1815**.\n*   ***Scotland Forever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo on **June 18, 1815**.\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Shows a roll call of the Grenadier Guards after the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War. The battle took place on **November 5, 1854**.\n*   ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Portrays the survivors of the Charge of the Light Brigade, which was part of the Battle of Balaclava on **October 25, 1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Depicts the famous defence during the Anglo-Zulu War, which took place on **January 22–23, 1879**.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir*** (painted 1885): Illustrates the British dawn attack during the Battle of Tel El Kebir in the Anglo-Egyptian War on **September 13, 1882**.\n*   ***To the Front: French Cavalry Leading the Advance to Ghoain, 1914*** (painted c. 1916): A World War I scene depicting the French cavalry during the opening phase of the war, specifically the Retreat from Mons in **August 1914**.\n*   ***The Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26th February 1916*** (painted 1917): A later work depicting a cavalry charge by a British Yeomanry regiment against Senussi forces during the Senussi Campaign in Egypt, part of the First World War. The battle, known as the Affair of Agagia, took place on **February 26, 1916**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Dates of the Battles**\nNow, we compare the historical dates of the events depicted in the paintings:\n*   Battle of Quatre Bras: 1815\n*   Battle of Waterloo: 1815\n*   Battle of Balaclava: 1854\n*   Battle of Inkerman: 1854\n*   Battle of Rorke's Drift: 1879\n*   Battle of Tel El Kebir: 1882\n*   Advance to Ghlin (Mons): 1914\n*   Affair of Agagia: **1916**\n\n**Step 4: Conclude with the Latest Battle**\nBy comparing the dates, it is clear that the latest historical event depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **Affair of Agagia**, which occurred in 1916 during World War I.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n1.  **Date of Painting vs. Date of Battle**: It is crucial to distinguish between the year the painting was created and the year the historical event took place. The question asks for the latest *historical* battle.\n2.  **Scope of Work**: Lady Butler had a long career. While her most famous works are from the Victorian era depicting 19th-century conflicts, she continued to paint into the 20th century and covered World War I, which is essential for finding the correct answer.\n3.  **Explicit Titles**: Some titles, like *The Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, 26th February 1916*, directly state the battle and date, making identification straightforward. Others, like *The Roll Call*, require external knowledge to link the scene to a specific battle (Inkerman).\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe final answer is derived from the chronological comparison of the battles depicted. The latest battle is the one that occurred in 1916.\n\n<<<The Affair of Agagia"
