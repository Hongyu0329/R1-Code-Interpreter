    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Geometry and Orientation:**\n    *   The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangle faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. It is a highly symmetrical object.\n    *   The icosahedron is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means that one of its 20 triangular faces is positioned horizontally at the bottom, serving as the base.\n    *   Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, if one face is the horizontal base, there must be another face that is perfectly parallel to it and forms the horizontal top.\n\n2.  **Interpret \"Half-Filled\":**\n    *   The tank is \"half-filled with water\". This means the volume of the water is exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n    *   A key property of a regular icosahedron (like all Platonic solids) is that it possesses central symmetry. This means there is a central point such that any line drawn through this center connects two opposite points on the surface of the icosahedron.\n    *   For any centrally symmetric object, any plane passing through its center of symmetry will divide its volume into two equal halves.\n    *   Since gravity makes the water surface horizontal, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\n3.  **Determine the Shape of the Water Surface:**\n    *   The question asks for the shape of the water surface. This is equivalent to asking for the shape of the cross-section created by slicing the icosahedron with the horizontal plane passing through its center.\n    *   We need to determine which faces of the icosahedron this central plane intersects.\n    *   Let's analyze the vertical arrangement of the icosahedron's vertices when it stands on a face. The 12 vertices are arranged in four horizontal layers:\n        *   A layer of 3 vertices forming the bottom triangular face.\n        *   A layer of 3 vertices slightly above the bottom layer.\n        *   A layer of 3 vertices slightly below the top layer.\n        *   A layer of 3 vertices forming the top triangular face.\n    *   The central horizontal plane (the water surface) passes exactly between the two middle layers of vertices. It does not pass through any vertex.\n    *   Therefore, the plane must intersect the faces that connect the vertices of the lower-middle layer to the vertices of the upper-middle layer.\n    *   There are exactly 6 such faces arranged around the \"waist\" of the icosahedron.\n    *   The intersection of a plane (the water surface) with another plane (a face of the icosahedron) is a straight line segment.\n    *   Since the water surface plane intersects 6 faces, the boundary of the water surface will be a polygon with 6 sides, i.e., a hexagon.\n\n4.  **Determine the Properties of the Hexagon:**\n    *   We can use the symmetry of the setup to determine if the hexagon is regular.\n    *   **Rotational Symmetry:** When an icosahedron stands on a face, it has a 3-fold rotational symmetry axis that passes vertically through the center of the base and top faces. Since the cutting plane (water surface) is horizontal, it is perpendicular to this axis of symmetry. Consequently, the resulting cross-sectional shape must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **Central Symmetry:** As established, the icosahedron and the cutting plane both pass through the center of symmetry. Therefore, the resulting hexagon must also be centrally symmetric.\n    *   A hexagon that has both 3-fold rotational symmetry and central symmetry must be a **regular hexagon** (all sides are of equal length, and all internal angles are equal).\n\n**Careful Points to Note**\n\n*   **Symmetry is Key:** The solution relies heavily on the high degree of symmetry of the icosahedron. Without this symmetry, the problem would be much more difficult.\n*   **\"Half-Filled\" Implication:** Correctly understanding that \"half-filled\" for a centrally symmetric object means the dividing surface passes through the center is crucial.\n*   **Orientation Matters:** The shape of the cross-section depends on the orientation of the icosahedron and the slicing plane. If the icosahedron were standing on a vertex or an edge, the half-filled water surface would be a different shape (a decagon, in fact, for standing on a vertex).\n*   **No Vertices on the Plane:** It is important to realize that the central horizontal plane in this orientation does not pass through any vertices, which simplifies the analysis of the intersection. It cuts through the middle of a \"belt\" of 6 faces.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, when an icosahedron standing on a face is half-filled, the water surface forms a horizontal plane through the center. The intersection of this plane with the icosahedron is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
