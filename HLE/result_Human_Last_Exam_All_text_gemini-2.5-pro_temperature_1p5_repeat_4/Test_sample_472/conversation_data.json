    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\n**1. Identify the Meter**\nThe line is an **Iambic Senarius**, a common meter in Roman comedy (like Plautus, from whom this line is taken). This meter consists of six iambic feet. The basic foot is an iamb (S L), but various substitutions are permitted, especially in the first five feet.\n\n**2. Syllabification and Elision**\nFirst, we break the line into its component syllables. A crucial point here is **elision**, where a final vowel (or a vowel followed by 'm') is dropped before a word starting with a vowel.\n*   The words `bene esse` undergo elision. The final `-e` of `bene` is elided before the initial `e-` of `esse`.\n*   The line is phonetically treated as: `et tibi ben-esse soli quom sibi sit male`.\n*   Syllabification: `et | ti | bi | be | nes | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le`\n\n**3. Determining Syllable Quantity**\nWe now determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S). A syllable is long if it contains a long vowel or diphthong (**long by nature**), or if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (**long by position**). Otherwise, it is short.\n\n*   `et`: The vowel `e` is short, but it is followed by the consonant `t`, and the next word begins with `t` (`tibi`). This creates a consonant cluster, making the syllable **L** by position.\n*   `ti-bi`: Both `i` vowels are naturally short. `ti` is **S**, `bi` is **S**.\n*   `be-nes-se` (from `ben(e) esse`):\n    *   `be-`: The `e` is short and the syllable is open. **S**.\n    *   `-nes-`: The `e` is short, but the syllable is closed by `s` (and the next syllable starts with `s`), making it **L** by position.\n    *   `-se`: The `e` is short and the syllable is open. **S**.\n*   `so-li` (`sōlī`): The `o` in `sōlus` is long by nature, and the dative ending `-ī` is also long by nature. Therefore, `so` is **L** and `li` is **L**.\n*   `quom`: This is an archaic spelling of `cum`. The vowel `u` (written as `o` here) is short, but the syllable is closed by `m` and the next word starts with `s`. It is **L** by position.\n*   `si-bi`: Both `i` vowels are naturally short. `si` is **S**, `bi` is **S**.\n*   `sit`: The vowel `i` is short, but the syllable is closed by `t` and the next word starts with `m`. It is **L** by position.\n*   `ma-le`: Both vowels are naturally short. `ma` is **S**, `le` is **S**.\n\n**4. Assembling the Feet**\nNow we group the sequence of long and short syllables into six metrical feet, following the rules of the Iambic Senarius. Substitutions like spondees (L L), anapests (S S L), and trochees (L S, especially in the first foot) are common.\n\n*   **Sequence of syllables**: L S S S L S L L L S S L S S\n*   **Foot 6 (the final foot)**: This foot must be an iamb (S L). Our last word is `male` (`S S`). By the principle of *brevis in longo*, the final syllable of a line can be treated as long, regardless of its natural quantity. Thus, `male` scans as **S L**.\n*   **Foot 5**: Working backward, the syllables before `male` are `sibi sit`. The quantities are `S S L`. This forms a perfect **anapest (S S L)**, a common substitution.\n*   **Foot 4**: Before that are the syllables `-li` (from `soli`) and `quom`. The quantities are `L L`. This forms a **spondee (L L)**, another valid substitution.\n*   **Foot 3**: The syllables before that are `se` (from `benesse`) and `so-` (from `soli`). The quantities are `S L`. This is a perfect **iamb (S L)**. Note that a major pause, or **caesura**, naturally falls here (`...benesse so- || -li...`), which strengthens this scansion.\n*   **Foot 2**: The syllables before that are `bi` (from `tibi`) and `be-nes` (from `benesse`). The quantities are `S S L`. This forms another **anapest (S S L)**.\n*   **Foot 1 (the first foot)**: The remaining syllables are `et ti`. The quantities are `L S`. This forms a **trochee (L S)**, a very common substitution for the first foot of an iambic line.\n\n**5. Final Scansion**\nPutting all the feet together, we get the complete scansion of the line:\n\n*   **Foot 1**: `et ti` -> **L S** (Trochee)\n*   **Foot 2**: `bi be nes` -> **S S L** (Anapest)\n*   **Foot 3**: `se so` -> **S L** (Iamb)\n*   **Foot 4**: `li quom` -> **L L** (Spondee)\n*   **Foot 5**: `si bi sit` -> **S S L** (Anapest)\n*   **Foot 6**: `ma le` -> **S L** (Iamb)\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
