    "Answering this question requires combining concepts from fractal geometry and additive combinatorics. Let's break down the problem into clear steps.\n\n### Step 1: Defining a Sidon Set in the Reals\n\nFirst, we need to understand the definitions.\n\n*   **Sidon Set of Integers:** A set of integers, $D \\subset \\mathbb{Z}$, is called a Sidon set (or a $B_2$ set) if all pairwise sums of its elements are distinct, except for trivial reorderings. Formally, if $d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4 \\in D$ satisfy $d_1 + d_2 = d_3 + d_4$, then the multisets must be identical: $\\{d_1, d_2\\} = \\{d_3, d_4\\}$.\n*   **Sidon Set in the Reals:** The question asks about a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1. This concept is a direct extension of the integer definition. A set $A \\subset [0, 1]$ is a Sidon set if for any elements $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \\in A$, the equation $x_1 + x_2 = x_3 + x_4$ implies that $\\{x_1, x_2\\} = \\{x_3, x_4\\}$ as multisets.\n*   **Hausdorff Dimension:** This is a way of measuring the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of a set, particularly fractal sets. It generalizes the notion of dimension from integer values to any non-negative real number.\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension, $\\dim_H(A)$, that a Sidon set $A \\subset [0, 1]$ can have. We are looking for the value $\\sup \\{ \\dim_H(A) : A \\subset [0,1] \\text{ is a Sidon set} \\}$.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two main parts: establishing an upper bound and a lower bound for this value.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound\n\nThe Sidon property imposes a very strong restriction on the additive structure of a set. Intuitively, a set with high fractal dimension must be \"rich\" or \"dense\" in some sense, which tends to create additive patterns. This intuition turns out to be correct.\n\nA significant result in fractal geometry, proven by Christian Bluhm in 2002, provides the upper bound.\n\n**Theorem (Bluhm):** If $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is a Sidon set, then its Hausdorff dimension cannot exceed 1/2. That is, $\\dim_H(A) \\le 1/2$.\n\nThe proof of this theorem is quite advanced. It uses tools from Fourier analysis. The core idea is to show that if a set has a Hausdorff dimension greater than 1/2, it must possess a certain amount of \"additive energy\" or structure, which can be shown to violate the Sidon condition. Specifically, any measure supported on such a set has a Fourier transform that decays at a certain rate, and this can be used to show that there must be many non-trivial solutions to $x_1+x_2 \\approx x_3+x_4$, which ultimately contradicts the Sidon property of the set.\n\nFrom this theorem, we know that the maximum possible dimension is at most 1/2.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound (Construction)\n\nNow, we need to see if it's possible to construct Sidon sets whose dimension is actually close to 1/2. If we can construct Sidon sets with dimensions arbitrarily close to 1/2, then the maximum must be exactly 1/2.\n\nWe can achieve this using a Cantor-like construction that embeds the additive properties of a Sidon set of integers into a fractal set in $[0,1]$.\n\n1.  **Start with a Sidon set of integers.** From number theory, it is known that we can construct \"dense\" Sidon sets of integers. For any large integer $m$, there exists a Sidon set of integers, let's call it $D_m$, such that $|D_m| = m$ and all its elements lie in the interval $\\{0, 1, \\dots, N_m\\}$, where $N_m$ is on the order of $m^2$ (i.e., $N_m = O(m^2)$).\n\n2.  **Construct a self-similar set.** We use the elements of $D_m$ as \"digits\" to construct a set in $[0, 1]$. Choose a large integer base, $b$. The set $A_m$ is defined as all numbers in $[0,1]$ that can be written in base $b$ using only digits from $D_m$:\n    $A_m = \\left\\{ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{d_k}{b^k} : d_k \\in D_m \\text{ for all } k \\ge 1 \\right\\}$.\n\n3.  **Ensure the Sidon property for the fractal set.** To ensure that $A_m$ is a Sidon set, we must prevent the \"carries\" from interfering when we sum two numbers. The maximum value of a sum of two digits is at most $2N_m$. If we choose the base $b$ to be larger than this, i.e., $b > 2N_m$, then the base-$b$ representation of a sum is simply the sum of the digits in each position.\n    Suppose $x_1+x_2 = x_3+x_4$ for elements in $A_m$. This translates to:\n    $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{d_{1,k}+d_{2,k}}{b^k} = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{d_{3,k}+d_{4,k}}{b^k}$\n    Because of our choice of a large base $b$, this equality holds if and only if the \"digits\" are equal at each position:\n    $d_{1,k}+d_{2,k} = d_{3,k}+d_{4,k}$ for all $k \\ge 1$.\n    Since each $d_{i,k}$ is from the integer Sidon set $D_m$, this implies that $\\{d_{1,k}, d_{2,k}\\} = \\{d_{3,k}, d_{4,k}\\}$ for each $k$. A careful analysis shows that this is sufficient to guarantee that $\\{x_1, x_2\\} = \\{x_3, x_4\\}$, meaning $A_m$ is indeed a Sidon set.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Hausdorff dimension.** The set $A_m$ is a self-similar set. Its Hausdorff dimension is given by the formula:\n    $\\dim_H(A_m) = \\frac{\\log(\\text{number of digits})}{\\log(\\text{base})} = \\frac{\\log|D_m|}{\\log b}$.\n    Substituting our choices: $|D_m| = m$, and we can choose $b$ just large enough, for example $b = 2N_m+1$. Since $N_m \\approx C m^2$ for some constant $C$:\n    $\\dim_H(A_m) \\approx \\frac{\\log m}{\\log(2Cm^2)} = \\frac{\\log m}{\\log(2C) + 2\\log m} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\log(2C)}{\\log m} + 2}$.\n    As we let $m \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{\\log(2C)}{\\log m}$ goes to 0. Therefore, the dimension approaches $1/2$.\n\nThis construction shows that we can create Sidon sets with Hausdorff dimensions arbitrarily close to $1/2$. Thus, the maximum dimension must be at least $1/2$.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 2, we know the maximum Hausdorff dimension is at most $1/2$. From Step 3, we know the maximum Hausdorff dimension is at least $1/2$. Combining these two bounds, we find the exact value.\n\nThe maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1 is exactly $1/2$.\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
