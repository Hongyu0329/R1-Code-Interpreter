The ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio is highly dependent on the specific catalytic reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal ratio is typically in the range of **0.2 to 0.4** (e.g., ~0.25), which maximizes the synergistic Ni-Ceria interface for high activity and stability. For thermochemical Water Splitting (WS), where Ni acts as a bulk dopant, a much lower atomic ratio of approximately **0.05** is ideal to enhance the reducibility of ceria without causing phase separation.
