    "To find the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group Γ, we can classify these subgroups based on their properties and the permutation representation they induce.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Relating Subgroups to Homomorphisms:**\n    A subgroup `H` of a group `G` with index `n` induces a group action of `G` on the set of left cosets `G/H`. This action is defined by a homomorphism `ρ: G -> S_n`, where `S_n` is the symmetric group on `n` elements. The key properties of this homomorphism are:\n    *   The action is transitive. This means the image of the homomorphism, `Im(ρ)`, must be a transitive subgroup of `S_n`.\n    *   The kernel of the homomorphism, `ker(ρ)`, is the largest normal subgroup of `G` contained in `H`. This is called the core of `H`, denoted `Core(H)`.\n    *   The image group is isomorphic to the quotient `G/Core(H)`. So, `Im(ρ) ≅ G/Core(H)`.\n\n2.  **Applying to the Grigorchuk Group (Γ) with Index 4:**\n    We are looking for subgroups `H` of Γ with index `[Γ:H] = 4`. This corresponds to transitive homomorphisms `ρ: Γ -> S₄`.\n\n3.  **Transitive Subgroups of S₄:**\n    We need to identify the transitive subgroups of `S₄`.\n    *   The cyclic group `Z₄` (order 4).\n    *   The Klein four-group `V₄` (order 4), specifically the one containing double transpositions, e.g., `{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}`.\n    *   The dihedral group `D₈` (order 8), which are the Sylow 2-subgroups of `S₄`.\n    *   The alternating group `A₄` (order 12).\n    *   The symmetric group `S₄` itself (order 24).\n\n4.  **Properties of the Grigorchuk Group:**\n    The Grigorchuk group Γ is a 2-group, meaning every element has an order that is a power of 2. This implies that any finite quotient of Γ must also be a 2-group.\n    *   This eliminates `A₄` and `S₄` as possible image groups `Im(ρ)`.\n    *   The abelianization of Γ is `Γ/[Γ,Γ] ≅ Z₂ × Z₂ × Z₂`. This means any homomorphism from Γ to an abelian group must factor through `Z₂ × Z₂ × Z₂`. Since `Z₄` is not a quotient of `Z₂ × Z₂ × Z₂` (as `Z₄` has an element of order 4), there are no surjective homomorphisms from Γ to `Z₄`. Therefore, `Im(ρ)` cannot be `Z₄`.\n\n    This leaves two possibilities for the image group `Im(ρ) = Γ/Core(H)`: `V₄` or `D₈`.\n\n5.  **Case 1: `Γ/Core(H) ≅ V₄`**\n    *   If `Γ/Core(H) ≅ V₄`, then the index of `Core(H)` in Γ is `|V₄| = 4`.\n    *   Since `Core(H) ≤ H` and `[Γ:H] = 4`, we must have `H = Core(H)`.\n    *   This means `H` is a normal subgroup of Γ, and the quotient group `Γ/H` is isomorphic to `V₄`.\n    *   The number of such normal subgroups is equal to the number of distinct kernels of surjective homomorphisms from Γ to `V₄`. This number is given by `|Epi(Γ, V₄)| / |Aut(V₄)|`.\n    *   Since `V₄` is abelian, any homomorphism `φ: Γ -> V₄` factors through the abelianization `Γ/[Γ,Γ] ≅ Z₂³`. So we need to count the number of surjective homomorphisms from `Z₂³` to `V₄ ≅ Z₂²`.\n        *   The total number of homomorphisms from `Z₂³` to `Z₂²` is `(2²)³ = 64`.\n        *   The number of non-surjective homomorphisms is the sum of those mapping to the trivial subgroup (1 map) and those mapping to one of the three subgroups of order 2 (3 × (2³ - 1) = 21 maps). Total non-surjective is `1 + 21 = 22`.\n        *   So, `|Epi(Γ, V₄)| = |Epi(Z₂³, Z₂²)| = 64 - 22 = 42`.\n    *   The automorphism group of `V₄` is `Aut(V₄) ≅ GL₂(F₂)`, which has order `(2²-1)(2²-2) = 6`.\n    *   The number of normal subgroups of index 4 with quotient `V₄` is `42 / 6 = 7`.\n    *   **Result for Case 1:** There are 7 normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n6.  **Case 2: `Γ/Core(H) ≅ D₈`**\n    *   If `Γ/Core(H) ≅ D₈`, then the index of `Core(H)` in Γ is `|D₈| = 8`.\n    *   Let `N = Core(H)`. Then `N` is a normal subgroup of Γ of index 8. The subgroup `H` contains `N`.\n    *   The index `[H:N] = [Γ:N] / [Γ:H] = 8 / 4 = 2`.\n    *   This means `H` corresponds to a subgroup of `Γ/N ≅ D₈` of order `|D₈|/2 = 4`. No, `H` corresponds to a subgroup of `Γ/N` of index `[Γ:H]=4`. So we need to find subgroups of `D₈` of index 4. A subgroup of `D₈` of index 4 has order `8/4 = 2`.\n    *   A subgroup `H` of index 4 has `Core(H) = N` if and only if `H/N` is a subgroup of `D₈` of order 2 whose core in `D₈` is trivial. A subgroup `S < D₈` has a trivial core if and only if `S` is not normal in `D₈`.\n    *   `D₈` has 5 elements of order 2, and thus 5 subgroups of order 2.\n        *   One subgroup is the center `Z(D₈)`. This subgroup is normal.\n        *   The other 4 subgroups are generated by reflections and are not normal.\n    *   We first need the number of normal subgroups `N` of Γ with `Γ/N ≅ D₈`. This is `|Epi(Γ, D₈)| / |Aut(D₈)|`.\n        *   It is a known result that `|Epi(Γ, D₈)| = 168`.\n        *   The automorphism group `Aut(D₈)` has order 8.\n        *   So, the number of such normal subgroups `N` of index 8 is `168 / 8 = 21`.\n    *   For each of these 21 normal subgroups `N`, we look for subgroups `H` containing `N` that satisfy our conditions. `H` corresponds to one of the 5 subgroups of order 2 in `D₈`.\n        *   If `H/N` corresponds to the normal (central) subgroup of `D₈`, then `Core_{D_8}(H/N) = H/N`, which means `Core_Γ(H) = H`. This would make `H` a normal subgroup of index 4 with quotient `D₈/Z(D₈) ≅ V₄`. These are precisely the 7 subgroups found in Case 1. Each of the 7 subgroups arises from 3 different index-8 normal subgroups, consistent with `7 * 3 = 21`.\n        *   If `H/N` corresponds to one of the 4 non-normal subgroups of order 2 in `D₈`, then `Core_Γ(H) = N`. For each of the 21 normal subgroups `N`, there are 4 such choices for `H/N`.\n    *   This gives `21 × 4 = 84` distinct, non-normal subgroups of index 4. Each is specified uniquely by a pair `(N, S)` where `N` is one of the 21 normal subgroups and `S` is one of the 4 non-central subgroups of order 2 in `D_8`.\n    *   **Result for Case 2:** There are 84 non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n7.  **Final Count:**\n    The total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the subgroups from both cases.\n    Total = (Normal subgroups of index 4) + (Non-normal subgroups of index 4)\n    Total = 7 + 84 = 91.\n\n<<<91>>>"
