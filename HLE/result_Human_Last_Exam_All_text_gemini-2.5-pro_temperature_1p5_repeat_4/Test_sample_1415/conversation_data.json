    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Define the function F₃(x)**\n\nWe are given a sequence of functions. Let's write them out explicitly.\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Integrand**\n\nThe integral we need to evaluate is ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx.\n*   **Careful Point:** This form of the integrand, f'(x)/f(x), is a standard result from calculus. It is the derivative of ln(f(x)).\n*   Let's verify this. Let u = F₃(x). Using the chain rule, the derivative of ln(u) with respect to x is (d/du ln(u)) * (du/dx) = (1/u) * u' = u'/u.\n*   So, d/dx [ln(F₃(x))] = F₃'(x)/F₃(x).\n*   This means the antiderivative of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln(F₃(x)).\n*   ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = ln(F₃(x)) + C.\n    *   (Note: We should technically use ln|F₃(x)|, but since x is in [0, 1], sin(x) is between sin(0)=0 and sin(1)≈0.84. Thus e^(sin(x)) is positive, 1+e^(sin(x)) > 2, and F₃(x) = ln(1+e^(sin(x))) is always positive. So the absolute value is not needed).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Definite Integral**\n\nWe need to calculate the definite integral from 0 to 1. Let V be the value of the integral.\nV = ∫₀¹ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\nV = [ln(F₃(x))] evaluated from 0 to 1.\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Using the property of logarithms, ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b).\nV = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) )\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the values of F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\n\nFirst, let's find F₃(0):\n*   F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0\n*   F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e⁰ = 1\n*   F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\nNext, let's find F₃(1):\n*   **Careful Point:** The argument of the sine function is 1 radian, not 1 degree.\n*   F₁(1) = sin(1)\n*   F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))\n*   F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n**Step 5: Substitute to find the exact value of V**\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for F₃(0) and F₃(1) back into our equation for V.\nV = ln( [ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))] / [ln(2)] )\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the numerical value of V**\n\nWe will use a calculator to find the approximate value.\n1.  sin(1) ≈ 0.841471\n2.  e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^(0.841471) ≈ 2.319778\n3.  F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(1 + 2.319778) = ln(3.319778) ≈ 1.199855\n4.  F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693147\n5.  Ratio: F₃(1) / F₃(0) ≈ 1.199855 / 0.693147 ≈ 1.731034\n6.  V = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0)) ≈ ln(1.731034) ≈ 0.548713\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final requested value**\n\nThe question asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n*   10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548713 = 5487.13\n*   The closest integer to 5487.13 is 5487.\n\n<<<5487>>>"
