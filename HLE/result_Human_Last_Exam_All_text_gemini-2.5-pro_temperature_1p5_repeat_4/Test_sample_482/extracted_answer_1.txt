The critical amount of correlation is achieved when the covariance between the activities of corresponding neurons in the two input populations, v and s, is equal to the variance of the activity within each input population. Let C = Cov(v_k, s_k) be the covariance and σ^2 = Var(v_k) = Var(s_k) be the variance. The critical condition is C = σ^2.
