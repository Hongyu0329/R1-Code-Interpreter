The optimal combination is a **Zirconium (Zr)** active center, which is covalently bonded to a **partially dehydroxylated silica (SiO₂) support**. In this system, the surface **siloxy group (≡SiO-)** acts as the primary, stabilizing ligand, creating a thermally robust, single-site catalyst. The active species is a zirconium hydride formed by hydrogenating a grafted organozirconium precursor.
