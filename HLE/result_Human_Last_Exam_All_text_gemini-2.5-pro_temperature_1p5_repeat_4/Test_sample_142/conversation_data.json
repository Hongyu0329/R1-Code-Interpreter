    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a Full CI calculation of $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ using a 6-31G** basis set.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of electrons (N)**\n\nFirst, we need to find the total number of electrons in the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ by summing the electrons from each constituent atom.\n*   **Carbon (C):** Atomic number 6, so 6 electrons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Atomic number 1, so 1 electron. There are 3 H atoms.\n*   **Silicon (Si):** Atomic number 14, so 14 electrons.\n*   **Fluorine (F):** Atomic number 9, so 9 electrons.\n\nThe total number of electrons (N) is:\nN = (1 × e⁻ from C) + (3 × e⁻ from H) + (1 × e⁻ from Si) + (1 × e⁻ from F)\nN = (1 × 6) + (3 × 1) + (1 × 14) + (1 × 9)\nN = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32 electrons.\n\nFor a singlet state calculation (which is the ground state for this closed-shell molecule), the number of alpha-spin electrons ($N_\\alpha$) is equal to the number of beta-spin electrons ($N_\\beta$).\n$N_\\alpha = N_\\beta = N / 2 = 32 / 2 = 16$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the total number of basis functions (spatial orbitals, K)**\n\nNext, we determine the number of basis functions supplied by the 6-31G** basis set for each atom. The `**` notation indicates that polarization functions are added to both heavy atoms (first `*`) and hydrogen atoms (second `*`). We will use the standard number of Cartesian functions (e.g., 6 d-functions).\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The `6-31G` part splits the 1s orbital into an inner and outer part, giving 2 s-type basis functions.\n    *   The `**` part adds a set of p-polarization functions (px, py, pz), which is 3 functions.\n    *   Total per H atom = 2 (s) + 3 (p) = 5 basis functions.\n\n*   **For the Carbon (C) atom (2nd-row heavy atom):**\n    *   The `6-31G` part gives: 1 function for the core 1s orbital, 2 functions for the split-valence 2s orbital, and 2 sets of p-functions (2×3=6) for the split-valence 2p orbitals. Total = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 functions.\n    *   The `*` part adds a set of d-polarization functions, which is 6 functions.\n    *   Total for C atom = 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **For the Fluorine (F) atom (2nd-row heavy atom):**\n    *   The counting is the same as for Carbon.\n    *   Total for F atom = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **For the Silicon (Si) atom (3rd-row heavy atom):**\n    *   The `6-31G` part treats the 1s, 2s, and 2p orbitals as core. This gives 1 (for 1s) + 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = 5 core functions. The valence 3s and 3p orbitals are split. This gives 2 (for 3s) + 2×3 (for 3p) = 8 valence functions. Total = 5 + 8 = 13 functions.\n    *   The `*` part adds a set of d-polarization functions, which is 6 functions.\n    *   Total for Si atom = 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n\nNow, we sum the basis functions for all atoms in the molecule to find the total number of spatial orbitals (K):\nK = (1 × C) + (3 × H) + (1 × Si) + (1 × F)\nK = (1 × 15) + (3 × 5) + (1 × 19) + (1 × 15)\nK = 15 + 15 + 19 + 15 = 64 spatial orbitals.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Singlet CSFs**\n\nA Full CI calculation considers all possible ways to distribute the N electrons among the K spatial orbitals. The number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a singlet state (S=0) can be calculated using the following formula:\n$N_{CSF}(S=0) = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2 - 1} \\binom{K}{N/2 + 1}$\n\nPlugging in our values (K = 64, N/2 = 16):\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15} \\binom{64}{17}$\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Final Value**\n\nWe need to compute the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16!(64-16)!} = \\frac{64!}{16!48!} = 55,638,116,109,310$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15!(64-15)!} = \\frac{64!}{15!49!} = 18,211,637,954,840$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17!(64-17)!} = \\frac{64!}{17!47!} = 157,096,210,190,520$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the formula:\n$N_{CSF} = (55,638,116,109,310)^2 - (18,211,637,954,840) \\times (157,096,210,190,520)$\n$N_{CSF} = 3,095,604,113,038,626,498,428,276,100 - 2,862,419,403,863,483,981,881,776,800$\n$N_{CSF} = 233,184,709,175,142,516,546,499,300$\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Electron Count:** Ensure the total number of electrons is correctly calculated by summing up the atomic numbers of all atoms in the molecule.\n2.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** Correctly interpret the 6-31G** notation for all atom types. The `**` means polarization on both heavy atoms (like C, F, Si) and light atoms (H). The rules for 2nd-row and 3rd-row atoms are different in Pople basis sets.\n3.  **Number of Functions:** Be sure to use the correct number of functions for each orbital type (s=1, p=3, d=6 for Cartesian basis functions, which is standard for Pople sets).\n4.  **CSF Formula:** Use the correct formula for the number of singlet CSFs, which is different from the formula for the number of Slater determinants. The number of CSFs is generally smaller.\n5.  **High-Precision Arithmetic:** The numbers involved are extremely large. The calculation requires high-precision arithmetic to avoid rounding errors.\n\nThe final calculated number of CSFs is approximately $2.33 \\times 10^{26}$.\n\n<<<233184709175142516546499300>>>"
