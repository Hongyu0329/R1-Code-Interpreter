    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta (photons) using large deviation theorems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and Statistical Framework**\n\n*   **System:** The system consists of light quanta (photons). Photons are bosons, meaning they are indistinguishable particles that follow Bose-Einstein statistics. Any number of photons can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Key Property:** A crucial characteristic of a photon gas is that the total number of photons is not conserved; they can be created and annihilated. In the language of the grand canonical ensemble, this corresponds to a chemical potential of zero ($\\mu=0$).\n*   **Goal:** We need to find the equilibrium values for the mean energy ($E$) and the entropy ($S$). The equilibrium state is the most probable macroscopic state of the system.\n\n**Step 2: Connect with Large Deviation Theory (LDT)**\n\nLarge deviation theory provides the mathematical foundation for why the methods of statistical mechanics work.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** This theorem provides a large deviation principle for the empirical measure of a sequence of i.i.d. random variables. In statistical mechanics, it justifies the **Principle of Maximum Entropy**. The probability of observing a particular macroscopic state (defined by a set of occupation numbers $\\{n_i\\}$ for energy levels $\\{\\epsilon_i\\}$) is proportional to the number of microscopic configurations $W(\\{n_i\\})$ corresponding to it.\n    *   $P(\\{n_i\\}) \\propto W(\\{n_i\\})$\n    *   The entropy is defined by the Boltzmann relation: $S = k_B \\log W$.\n    *   Therefore, $P(\\{n_i\\}) \\propto e^{S(\\{n_i\\})/k_B}$.\n    This shows that the probability of a macrostate is exponentially related to its entropy. The equilibrium state is the one with the maximum entropy ($S_{max}$), and the probability of observing a state with entropy $S < S_{max}$ is exponentially small: $P(S) \\sim e^{-(S_{max}-S)/k_B}$. Thus, finding the equilibrium state is equivalent to maximizing the entropy subject to the system's constraints.\n\n*   **Cramér-Chernoff Theorem (Gärtner-Ellis Theorem):** This theorem relates the large deviation rate function for a sum of random variables to the Legendre-Fenchel transform of their cumulant generating function. In statistical mechanics, this establishes the equivalence of the microcanonical and canonical (or grand canonical) ensembles for large systems.\n    *   The log of the partition function (e.g., grand canonical partition function $Z_G$) acts as the cumulant generating function for the energy.\n    *   The Legendre transform of $\\log Z_G$ with respect to $\\beta=1/(k_B T)$ yields the negative of the entropy, which is the large deviation rate function for energy.\n    *   This justifies using the mathematically convenient grand canonical ensemble to derive the properties of the system. The values calculated will correspond to the equilibrium (most probable) values.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Properties using the Grand Canonical Ensemble**\n\nBased on the justification from LDT, we proceed by using the grand canonical ensemble for a Bose gas with $\\mu=0$.\n\n1.  **Grand Canonical Partition Function ($Z_G$):**\n    For bosons, the partition function for a single energy level $\\epsilon_i$ with degeneracy $g_i$ and chemical potential $\\mu$ is $Z_i = \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty e^{-n\\beta(\\epsilon_i-\\mu)}\\right)^{g_i} = (1-e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_i-\\mu)})^{-g_i}$. The total partition function is the product over all levels. For photons, $\\mu=0$:\n    $Z_G = \\prod_i (1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})^{-g_i}$\n\n2.  **Log of the Partition Function:**\n    $\\log Z_G = - \\sum_i g_i \\log(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})$\n\n**Step 4: Derive the Equilibrium Mean Energy (E)**\n\nThe mean energy is the expectation value in this ensemble:\n$E = \\langle E \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\log Z_G$\n$E = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left( - \\sum_i g_i \\log(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i}) \\right)$\n$E = \\sum_i g_i \\frac{1}{1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i}} \\cdot (-\\epsilon_i e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i}) \\cdot (-1)$\n$E = \\sum_i g_i \\frac{\\epsilon_i e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i}}{1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i}} = \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\epsilon_i}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i} - 1}$\n\nThis is the general formula for the mean energy. This expression is equivalent to $E = \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i$, where $n_i = g_i / (e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i}-1)$ is the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons.\n\n*   **Specific Case: Blackbody Radiation:** For photons in a 3D box of volume $V$, the sum can be converted to an integral using the density of states $g(\\epsilon) = \\frac{8\\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\epsilon^2 = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\epsilon^2$.\n    $E = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon \\cdot g(\\epsilon)}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2(\\hbar c)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\n    Using the standard integral $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$, we get the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy:\n    $E = \\frac{V \\pi^2 (k_B T)^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3}$\n\n**Step 5: Derive the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nThe most straightforward way to find the entropy is via the thermodynamic relation for the grand potential $\\Omega = -k_B T \\log Z_G$. For a system with $\\mu=0$, the fundamental relation is $\\Omega = E - TS$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Grand Potential ($\\Omega$):**\n    $\\Omega = -k_B T \\log Z_G = k_B T \\sum_i g_i \\log(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})$\n    For the specific case of blackbody radiation, we can show (via integration by parts) a simple relation between $\\Omega$ and $E$:\n    $\\Omega = -E/3$\n    This result, $P = -\\Omega/V = E/3V$, holds for any ultra-relativistic gas.\n\n2.  **Calculate Entropy (S):**\n    From $\\Omega = E - TS$, we have $S = (E - \\Omega) / T$.\n    $S = (E - (-E/3)) / T = \\frac{4E}{3T}$\n\nThis provides the equilibrium entropy in terms of the equilibrium energy.\n\n*   **General Formula:** We can express $S$ in a more fundamental form using the expression for $\\Omega$:\n    $S = \\frac{E}{T} - k_B \\sum_i g_i \\log(1 - e^{-\\beta\\epsilon_i})$\n    This can also be written in terms of the occupation numbers $n_i = g_i / (e^{\\beta\\epsilon_i}-1)$:\n    $S = k_B \\sum_i \\left[ (n_i+g_i)\\log(n_i+g_i) - n_i\\log n_i - g_i\\log g_i \\right]$\n\n*   **Specific Case: Blackbody Radiation:** Substitute the result for $E$:\n    $S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{V \\pi^2 (k_B T)^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} \\right) = \\frac{4 V \\pi^2 k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for a gas of light quanta (photons) at temperature $T$ are:\n\n**1. Equilibrium Mean Energy (E):**\nThe general expression in terms of discrete energy levels $\\epsilon_i$ with degeneracy $g_i$ is:\n$E = \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\epsilon_i}{e^{\\epsilon_i/k_B T} - 1}$\nFor the specific case of photons in a 3D volume V (blackbody radiation), the mean energy is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$E = \\frac{\\pi^2 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3}$\n\n**2. Equilibrium Entropy (S):**\nThe general expression is derived from the thermodynamic potential:\n$S = \\frac{E}{T} - k_B \\sum_i g_i \\log\\left(1 - e^{-\\epsilon_i/k_B T}\\right)$\nThis can also be expressed in terms of the energy as $S = 4E/(3T)$.\nFor the specific case of photons in a 3D volume V, substituting the expression for E gives:\n$S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$\n\n<<<\nEquilibrium Mean Energy:\nGeneral form: $E = \\sum_i \\frac{g_i \\epsilon_i}{e^{\\epsilon_i/k_B T} - 1}$\nFor blackbody radiation: $E = \\frac{\\pi^2 V (k_B T)^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3}$\n\nEquilibrium Entropy:\nGeneral form: $S = \\frac{E}{T} - k_B \\sum_i g_i \\log\\left(1 - e^{-\\epsilon_i/k_B T}\\right)$\nFor blackbody radiation: $S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$\n>>>"
