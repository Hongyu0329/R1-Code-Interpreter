    "Answering this question requires breaking it down into several logical steps: understanding the structure of the matrix, simplifying it using linear algebra, relating its rank to the pattern of the flag, and finally maximizing this rank by considering the possible representations of the flag's features.\n\n### Step 1: Define the matrix from the flag of Tonga\n\n1.  **Flag Structure:** The flag of Tonga consists of a red background (the field) and a white rectangle (the canton) in the top-left corner. Inside this white canton, there is a red couped cross. A \"couped\" cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the canton.\n2.  **Matrix Representation:** We are asked to create a matrix `A` from a pixelated image of the flag. Red pixels are assigned a value of `a`, and white pixels are assigned a value of `b`.\n3.  **Block Matrix Structure:** Let's assume the image has `M` rows and `N` columns, and the canton occupies the top-left `m` rows and `n` columns. The matrix `A` can be represented as a block matrix:\n    ```\n    A = [ B_{m,n}      | R1_{m, N-n}   ]\n        [----------------|---------------]\n        [ R2_{M-m, n}    | R3_{M-m, N-n} ]\n    ```\n    *   The blocks `R1`, `R2`, and `R3` correspond to the red field of the flag. Every element in these blocks is `a`. So, these blocks are `a*J`, where `J` is a matrix of all ones.\n    *   The block `B` corresponds to the canton. It has a white background (value `b`) with a red cross (value `a`).\n\n### Step 2: Simplify the matrix to determine its rank\n\nThe rank of a matrix is invariant under elementary row and column operations. We can use this property to simplify `A`.\n\n1.  **Identical Rows and Columns:**\n    *   Any row from `m+1` to `M` is `[a, a, ..., a]`. All these `M-m` rows are identical.\n    *   Any column from `n+1` to `N` consists entirely of `a`'s. All these `N-n` columns are identical.\n\n2.  **Row and Column Operations:**\n    *   We can subtract row `M` from rows `m+1` to `M-1`, making them all-zero rows. This means the bottom `M-m` rows contribute at most 1 to the total rank (from the single remaining non-zero row).\n    *   Similarly, we can subtract column `N` from columns `n+1` to `N-1`, making them all-zero columns. The rightmost `N-n` columns contribute at most 1 to the total rank.\n    *   After these operations, the rank of the matrix is determined by an `(m+1) x (n+1)` submatrix in the top-left, let's call it `A_sub`.\n\n3.  **Analyzing `A_sub`:**\n    This reduced matrix `A_sub` has the form:\n    ```\n    A_sub = [ B       | a*j_m   ]\n            [---------|---------]\n            [ a*j_n^T | a       ]\n    ```\n    where `j_k` is a column vector of `k` ones. To find its rank, we can perform another row operation. Assume `a ≠ 0`, we subtract the last row from each of the first `m` rows: `R_i' = R_i - R_{m+1}` for `i=1,...,m`.\n    *   The `i`-th row of `A_sub` is `[B_{i1}, ..., B_{in}, a]`.\n    *   The last row is `[a, a, ..., a]`.\n    *   The new `i`-th row becomes `[B_{i1}-a, ..., B_{in}-a, a-a]`. This is equivalent to the `i`-th row of the matrix `B - a*J`.\n    The resulting matrix is:\n    ```\n    [ B - a*J | 0_m ]\n    [---------|-----]\n    [ a*j_n^T | a   ]\n    ```\n    This is a block lower triangular matrix. Its rank is the sum of the ranks of the diagonal blocks: `rank(A) = rank(A_sub) = rank(B - a*J) + rank([a])`.\n\n4.  **Relating Rank to the Flag Pattern:**\n    *   Assuming `a ≠ 0`, `rank([a]) = 1`.\n    *   The matrix `B - a*J` has entries:\n        *   `a - a = 0` where the pixels in the canton are red (the cross).\n        *   `b - a` where the pixels are white (the canton background).\n    *   This matrix is `(b-a) * S`, where `S` is an indicator matrix with `1`s for the white background of the canton and `0`s for the red cross.\n    *   Assuming `a ≠ b`, `rank((b-a)S) = rank(S)`.\n    *   So, under the conditions `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`, the rank of the original matrix is `rank(A) = rank(S) + 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Maximize the rank of S\n\nTo find the maximal possible rank of `A`, we need to find the maximal possible rank of `S`. The rank of `S` depends on the shape of the cross.\n\n1.  **Modeling the Cross:** The red cross (`0`s in `S`) is the union of two overlapping rectangular regions: a vertical bar `R_v × C_v` and a horizontal bar `R_h × C_h`.\n2.  **Row Patterns in S:** The pattern of `0`s and `1`s in a row `i` of `S` depends on whether `i` falls into the row-set of the vertical bar (`R_v`) or the horizontal bar (`R_h`). There are four possibilities for a row index `i`:\n    *   **Type 1:** `i` is outside both `R_v` and `R_h`. The row is all `1`s.\n    *   **Type 2:** `i` is in `R_v` but not `R_h`. The row has `0`s at the columns defined by `C_v`.\n    *   **Type 3:** `i` is in `R_h` but not `R_v`. The row has `0`s at the columns defined by `C_h`.\n    *   **Type 4:** `i` is in both `R_v` and `R_h`. The row has `0`s at columns in `C_v U C_h`.\n    This means `S` can have at most 4 distinct types of rows. Thus, `rank(S) ≤ 4`.\n\n3.  **Achieving the Maximum Rank for S:** To achieve `rank(S) = 4`, we must be able to define a cross shape such that:\n    a. All four types of rows exist. This means the sets `R_v \\ R_h`, `R_h \\ R_v`, and `R_v ∩ R_h` must all be non-empty.\n    b. The four resulting row vectors are linearly independent. This can be achieved if the column sets `C_v \\ C_h`, `C_h \\ C_v`, and `C_v ∩ C_h` are also all non-empty.\n\n    We can construct such a cross. For example, in a `10x10` canton:\n    *   Let the vertical bar be defined by rows `R_v = {3,4,5,6}` and columns `C_v = {5,6,7,8}`.\n    *   Let the horizontal bar be defined by rows `R_h = {5,6,7,8}` and columns `C_h = {3,4,5,6}`.\n    This creates a valid, couped cross shape. With this construction, all the required row and column set partitions are non-empty, which makes the four distinct row vectors linearly independent. Therefore, a matrix `S` with `rank(S) = 4` can be constructed.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Final Maximal Rank\n\nThe question asks for the maximal *possible* rank. We are free to choose the parameters `a` and `b`, and the pixelation of the flag.\n\n*   If we choose `a ≠ 0` and `a ≠ b`, the rank of `A` is `rank(S) + 1`. Since the maximal rank of `S` is 4, the maximal rank of `A` would be `4 + 1 = 5`.\n*   Let's check other cases. If we choose `a=0` (red is 0) and `b ≠ 0` (white is non-zero), the matrix `A` would be non-zero only on the white parts of the flag. This means `A` would be a matrix with `b*S` in the canton block and zeros everywhere else. In this case, `rank(A) = rank(S)`, with a maximum of 4.\n*   Since we want to maximize the rank, we should choose `a` and `b` such that the formula `rank(S) + 1` applies (e.g., `a=1, b=0` or `a=2, b=1`).\n\nThe highest possible rank is achieved when `a` represents the \"live\" part of the matrix background, which adds an extra dimension to the rank contributed by the pattern in the canton.\n\nThus, the maximal possible rank of the matrix is `rank(S)_{max} + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5`."
