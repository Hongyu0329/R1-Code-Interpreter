Yes, changing the structure to incorporate a PEG group is a very effective and common strategy to solve solubility problems. The precipitation is caused by the high hydrophobicity of the thioxanthenone core and the 6-chlorohexyl chain. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains are highly hydrophilic and increase the aqueous solubility of molecules by forming hydrogen bonds with water. Replacing the hydrophobic parts of the linker with a PEG chain would make the entire probe more soluble, thus preventing precipitation in the cell culture medium.
