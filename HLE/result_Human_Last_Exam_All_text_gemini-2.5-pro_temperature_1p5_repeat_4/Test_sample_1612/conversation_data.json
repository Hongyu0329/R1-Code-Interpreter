    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Triple Crown\nFirst, we must understand what the \"Triple Crown\" in baseball refers to. For a batter, winning the Triple Crown means they led their respective league (American League or National League) in three specific statistical categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (BA)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\nThe question does not specify batting or pitching, but the \"Triple Crown\" without a qualifier almost universally refers to the batting achievement.\n\n### Step 2: List All Winners Chronologically\nTo find the total number of winners, we need to compile a complete list of every player who has accomplished this feat in Major League Baseball history. This includes the American League (AL), the National League (NL), and other leagues officially recognized as \"Major Leagues,\" such as the American Association (AA).\n\n**Pre-Modern Era (before 1901)**\n\n1.  **Paul Hines (1878, NL):** Playing for the Providence Grays, he led the National League with a .358 BA, 4 HR, and 50 RBI. *Careful Point: Some historical sources omit Hines because RBI was not an official statistic in 1878, but he is generally included in comprehensive lists.*\n2.  **Tip O'Neill (1887, AA):** Playing for the St. Louis Browns in the American Association, he led the league with a .435 BA, 14 HR, and 123 RBI.\n3.  **Hugh Duffy (1894, NL):** Playing for the Boston Beaneaters, he led the National League with a .440 BA, 18 HR, and 145 RBI.\n\n**Modern Era (1901-Present)**\n\n4.  **Nap Lajoie (1901, AL):** The first American League winner, he led the AL with a .426 BA, 14 HR, and 125 RBI for the Philadelphia Athletics.\n5.  **Ty Cobb (1909, AL):** For the Detroit Tigers, he led the AL with a .377 BA, 9 HR, and 107 RBI.\n6.  **Heinie Zimmerman (1912, NL):** For the Chicago Cubs, he led the NL with a .372 BA, 14 HR, and 104 RBI.\n7.  **Rogers Hornsby (1922, NL):** The first of his two Triple Crowns, he led the NL with a .401 BA, 42 HR, and 152 RBI for the St. Louis Cardinals.\n8.  **Rogers Hornsby (1925, NL):** He won his second Triple Crown with the Cardinals, leading the NL with a .403 BA, 39 HR, and 143 RBI. *Careful Point: Hornsby won twice, but is only one \"winner.\"*\n9.  **Chuck Klein (1933, NL):** For the Philadelphia Phillies, he led the NL with a .368 BA, 28 HR, and 120 RBI.\n10. **Jimmie Foxx (1933, AL):** In the same year as Klein, he won the AL Triple Crown for the Philadelphia Athletics with a .356 BA, 48 HR, and 163 RBI.\n11. **Lou Gehrig (1934, AL):** For the New York Yankees, he led the AL with a .363 BA, 49 HR, and 166 RBI.\n12. **Joe Medwick (1937, NL):** For the St. Louis Cardinals, he was the last NL player to win the Triple Crown, leading with a .374 BA, 31 HR, and 154 RBI.\n13. **Ted Williams (1942, AL):** For the Boston Red Sox, he won his first Triple Crown by leading the AL with a .356 BA, 36 HR, and 137 RBI.\n14. **Ted Williams (1947, AL):** He won his second Triple Crown with the Red Sox, leading the AL with a .343 BA, 32 HR, and 114 RBI. *Careful Point: Williams also won twice, but counts as one unique winner.*\n15. **Mickey Mantle (1956, AL):** For the New York Yankees, he led the AL with a .353 BA, 52 HR, and 130 RBI.\n16. **Frank Robinson (1966, AL):** For the Baltimore Orioles, he led the AL with a .316 BA, 49 HR, and 122 RBI.\n17. **Carl Yastrzemski (1967, AL):** The very next year, the Boston Red Sox player led the AL with a .326 BA, 44 HR, and 121 RBI.\n18. **Miguel Cabrera (2012, AL):** After a 45-year gap, the Detroit Tigers slugger won the most recent Triple Crown, leading the AL with a .330 BA, 44 HR, and 139 RBI.\n\n### Step 3: Tally the Final Count\nThe question asks, \"How many triple crowns winners are there?\". This phrasing asks for the number of unique players who have achieved the feat.\n\nBy reviewing the list, we can see that two players, Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams, won the Triple Crown twice. Therefore, while the feat has been accomplished 18 times, it has been done by fewer unique players.\n\nCounting the distinct names from the chronological list:\n1. Paul Hines\n2. Tip O'Neill\n3. Hugh Duffy\n4. Nap Lajoie\n5. Ty Cobb\n6. Heinie Zimmerman\n7. Rogers Hornsby\n8. Chuck Klein\n9. Jimmie Foxx\n10. Lou Gehrig\n11. Joe Medwick\n12. Ted Williams\n13. Mickey Mantle\n14. Frank Robinson\n15. Carl Yastrzemski\n16. Miguel Cabrera\n\nThe total number of unique players is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
