    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Request**\nThe user provides a haiku titled \"The Bays\". I need to solve the riddle posed by the haiku. The instructions are:\n1.  The title, \"The Bays\", is the question.\n2.  The haiku contains the clues to answer the question.\n3.  The final answer should be the letters of the solution word(s), sorted in alphabetical order.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Title/Question**\nThe question is \"The Bays\". This phrase is significant. In classical and literary contexts, \"the bays\" is a synonym for the victor's laurel wreath, a symbol of honor, victory, or poetic achievement. The word is plural, which is likely a key detail.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Haiku's Clues**\nThe haiku is structured in three lines (5-7-5 syllables), and each line provides a clue.\n\n*   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   This points to a significant, chaotic, or transformative event (\"tempest\") that occurred in the month of August. This suggests looking at major historical events in August.\n\n*   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" calculates to 30 (2 * 15 = 30).\n    *   \"Winds of change\" is a strong idiom for a major societal or political shift.\n    *   Combining these, the clue points to the year 30, likely 30 BC, given the classical feel of \"the bays\". The year 30 BC was a pivotal moment of change in the ancient world.\n\n*   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   \"A divine one\" refers to a person considered a god or goddess, or at least a ruler with divine status.\n    *   \"Yields\" means to give up, surrender, or die.\n    *   This line suggests the defeat or death of a deified ruler.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Solve the Riddle**\nLet's combine the clues into a single historical narrative:\n1.  The year is **30 BC** (\"Twice fifteen\").\n2.  In **August** of that year (\"An August tempest\"), a major conflict reached its conclusion. This was the end of the final war of the Roman Republic, when Octavian's forces captured Alexandria.\n3.  This event led to the suicide of Queen Cleopatra of Egypt. Cleopatra was worshipped as a living goddess (Isis), so she is the **\"divine one\"** who **\"yields\"**.\n4.  This series of events was a massive **\"wind of change\"**, marking the end of the Roman Republic and the Ptolemaic Kingdom, and the beginning of the Roman Empire under Octavian (soon to be Emperor Augustus).\n\nThe entire haiku describes the events that secured Octavian's ultimate victory. The question, \"The Bays,\" asks what was won or what these events represent. As established in Step 2, \"the bays\" are the laurel wreaths of a victor. Therefore, a direct synonym for \"the bays\" that fits this context is the answer.\n\nThe answer is **LAURELS**.\n\nThis word is plural, matching the question \"The Bays\". The haiku perfectly explains the context in which these \"laurels\" of victory were won.\n\n**Step 5: Final Formatting**\nThe final step is to take the answer, \"LAURELS\", and present its letters in alphabetical order as requested.\n*   Letters: L, A, U, R, E, L, S\n*   Alphabetical Order: A, E, L, L, R, S, U\n\nThe final string is AELLRSU.\n\n<<<AELLRSU>>>"
