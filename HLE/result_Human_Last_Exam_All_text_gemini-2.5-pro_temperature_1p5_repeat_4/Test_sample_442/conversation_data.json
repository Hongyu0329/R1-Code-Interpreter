    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Latin line to identify the poetic device in question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Translate the Line\n\nFirst, we must understand the meaning and grammatical structure of the line:\n*   **Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n*   **Source:** Vergil, *Eclogues* 8.17\n*   **Word-by-word breakdown:**\n    *   `Nascere`: \"Be born\" (imperative form of `nascor`, to be born; a poetic way of saying \"rise\").\n    *   `praeque`: `prae` (\"before\", \"in front\") + `-que` (the enclitic conjunction \"and\").\n    *   `diem`: \"the day\" (accusative case, object of the verb `age`).\n    *   `veniens`: \"coming\" (present participle, describing Lucifer).\n    *   `age`: \"lead on\" or \"bring on\" (imperative form of `ago`).\n    *   `Lucifer`: \"O Lucifer\" (vocative case; Lucifer is the morning star).\n    *   `almum`: \"nurturing\" or \"kindly\" (adjective agreeing with `diem`).\n*   **Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before, lead on the nurturing day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n### Step 2: Identify and Exclude Prohibited Devices\n\nThe question requires us to find a poetic device that is *not* one of the following:\n\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The line directly addresses the morning star (\"Lucifer\") and gives it human-like commands (`Nascere`, `age`). This device is present but is excluded from the answer.\n*   **Sound Effects (Alliteration, Assonance, Consonance):** The line features prominent **assonance** of the 'e' sound in \"Nascer**e**, praequ**e** di**e**m v**e**niens ag**e**\". This is a sound effect and is also excluded.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the intentional separation of words that normally go together. In the line, the noun `diem` (\"day\") is separated from its modifying adjective `almum` (\"nurturing\") by the phrase \"veniens age, Lucifer,\". This is a clear example of hyperbaton, which we must also exclude.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Line for Other Devices\n\nWith the prohibited devices set aside, we must look for another figure of speech. This involves looking closely at the meaning and the way ideas are expressed.\n\n*   Let's examine the core commands and descriptions given to Lucifer:\n    1.  `Nascere` (\"Be born\" / \"Rise\")\n    2.  `prae veniens` (\"coming before\")\n    3.  `age diem` (\"lead on the day\")\n\n*   **Careful Point:** A crucial point of analysis is to consider the relationship between these three phrases. Are they describing three separate actions, or are they different ways of describing the same essential phenomenon?\n\n*   For the morning star (Lucifer), its entire function is to rise before the sun, thereby heralding or \"leading on\" the new day. Therefore:\n    *   To \"be born\" (`Nascere`) *is* to \"come before\" the sun (`prae veniens`).\n    *   To \"come before\" the sun *is* to \"lead on the day\" (`age diem`).\n\n*   The poet is using multiple, nearly synonymous phrases to describe the single event of the morning star's appearance. This is a deliberate stylistic choice for emphasis.\n\n### Step 4: Name the Device\n\nThe use of more words than are strictly necessary to convey an idea, or the repetition of a single idea in different words, is a rhetorical device.\n\n*   This device is known as **Pleonasm** or **Tautology**.\n*   **Pleonasm** refers to the use of redundant words (e.g., \"a free gift\").\n*   **Tautology** refers to the repetition of an idea using different phrasing.\n*   In this context, the phrases `Nascere`, `prae veniens`, and `age diem` are tautological. They create a pleonastic expression that adds a solemn, emphatic, and almost incantatory quality to the command.\n\nThis figure of speech is distinct from those excluded by the question, as it is a device of meaning and thought, not of direct address, sound, or word order.\n\n<<<Pleonasm>>>"
