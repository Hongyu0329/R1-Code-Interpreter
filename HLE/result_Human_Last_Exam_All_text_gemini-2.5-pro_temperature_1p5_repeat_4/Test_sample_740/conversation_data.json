    "An analysis of the integral equation to find the values of λ for which there is no solution.\n\nThe integral equation is given by:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y} u(y) dy$, for $0 \\le x \\le 1$.\nHere, $n$ is assumed to be a positive integer.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the kernel of the integral equation.**\nThe kernel is $K(x, y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$.\nUsing the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can expand this expression:\n$x^n - y^n = (x - y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + x^{n-3}y^2 + \\dots + y^{n-1})$.\nSo, the kernel simplifies to a sum of $n$ terms:\n$K(x, y) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\nThis is a separable (or degenerate) kernel, which means the integral equation can be reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations. The kernel is also symmetric, i.e., $K(x, y) = K(y, x)$, which implies the integral operator is self-adjoint.\n\n**Step 2: Reduce the integral equation to a system of linear equations.**\nSubstitute the expanded kernel back into the equation:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k \\right) u(y) dy$.\nWe can swap the summation and integration:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$.\nThis shows that the solution $u(x)$ must be a polynomial in $x$ of degree at most $n-1$. Let's define the constants $c_k$:\n$c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k u(y) dy$, for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\nThen the expression for $u(x)$ becomes:\n$u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$.\nTo find the constants $c_k$, we substitute this expression for $u(y)$ back into the definitions of $c_j$:\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j \\left( 1 + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k y^{n-1-k} \\right) dy$\n$c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j dy + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\int_0^1 y^j y^{n-1-k} dy$\n$c_j = \\frac{1}{j+1} + \\lambda \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$.\nThis is a system of $n$ linear equations for the $n$ unknown constants $c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}$. It can be written in matrix form as $(I - \\lambda A)\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $A$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix with entries $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ (with $j,k$ from 0 to $n-1$), $\\mathbf{c} = [c_0, \\dots, c_{n-1}]^T$, and $\\mathbf{b} = [1, 1/2, \\dots, 1/n]^T$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the condition for no solution.**\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, this system of linear equations has no solution if:\n1. The determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero: $\\det(I - \\lambda A) = 0$. This implies that $1/\\lambda$ must be an eigenvalue of the matrix $A$.\n2. The vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is not in the column space of the matrix $(I - \\lambda A)$.\n\nThe problem now is to find the values of $\\lambda$ that satisfy these conditions. These values will depend on the parameter $n$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze for specific values of n.**\nLet's find the values of $\\lambda$ for $n=1$ and $n=2$ to see if a general pattern emerges.\n\n*   **Case n=1:**\n    The equation becomes $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda \\int_0^1 u(y) dy$.\n    Let $c_0 = \\int_0^1 u(y) dy$. Then $u(x) = 1 + \\lambda c_0$. The solution is a constant.\n    Substitute this back: $c_0 = \\int_0^1 (1 + \\lambda c_0) dy = 1 + \\lambda c_0$.\n    This gives the equation $c_0(1-\\lambda) = 1$.\n    If $\\lambda \\neq 1$, there is a unique solution for $c_0$ and thus for $u(x)$.\n    If $\\lambda = 1$, the equation becomes $0 \\cdot c_0 = 1$, which is impossible.\n    Thus, for $n=1$, the equation has no solution if and only if $\\lambda=1$.\n\n*   **Case n=2:**\n    The kernel is $K(x,y) = x+y$. The system of equations for $c_0, c_1$ is:\n    $c_0 = 1/1 + \\lambda (c_0/2 + c_1/1)$\n    $c_1 = 1/2 + \\lambda (c_0/3 + c_1/2)$\n    Rearranging gives:\n    $(1 - \\lambda/2) c_0 - \\lambda c_1 = 1$\n    $-\\frac{\\lambda}{3} c_0 + (1 - \\lambda/2) c_1 = 1/2$\n    The system has no unique solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero:\n    $\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\lambda/2 & -\\lambda \\\\ -\\lambda/3 & 1-\\lambda/2 \\end{pmatrix} = (1-\\lambda/2)^2 - \\frac{\\lambda^2}{3} = 1-\\lambda+\\frac{\\lambda^2}{4} - \\frac{\\lambda^2}{3} = 1 - \\lambda - \\frac{\\lambda^2}{12} = 0$.\n    This simplifies to the quadratic equation $\\lambda^2 + 12\\lambda - 12 = 0$.\n    The solutions are $\\lambda = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 4(1)(-12)}}{2} = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{192}}{2} = \\frac{-12 \\pm 8\\sqrt{3}}{2} = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\n    For these values of $\\lambda$, the determinant is zero. We must also check that the right-hand side vector $[1, 1/2]^T$ is not in the column space of the coefficient matrix. It can be verified that this condition holds, so for these two values of $\\lambda$, the equation has no solution.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the results.**\nFor $n=1$, the value of $\\lambda$ for which there is no solution is $\\lambda=1$.\nFor $n=2$, the values are $\\lambda = -6 \\pm 4\\sqrt{3}$.\nSince the values of $\\lambda$ for which no solution exists are different for different values of $n$, there is no single value of $\\lambda$ that works for all $n$.\n\nThe question \"For what values of λ does the equation have no solutions?\" is phrased in a way that suggests the answer should be independent of the parameter $n$. Based on our analysis, the set of such values $\\lambda$ that would work for all integers $n \\geq 1$ is the intersection of the sets of \"bad\" lambdas for each $n$.\nLet $\\Lambda_n$ be the set of $\\lambda$ values for which there is no solution for a given $n$.\nWe found $\\Lambda_1 = \\{1\\}$ and $\\Lambda_2 = \\{-6+4\\sqrt{3}, -6-4\\sqrt{3}\\}$.\nThe intersection $\\Lambda_1 \\cap \\Lambda_2$ is the empty set. Therefore, there is no value of $\\lambda$ for which the equation has no solution for both $n=1$ and $n=2$. This logic extends to all $n$, meaning the intersection of all $\\Lambda_n$ is empty.\n\nFinal conclusion: Interpreting the question as asking for values of $\\lambda$ that cause the equation to have no solution for *any* positive integer $n$, there are no such values.\n\n<<<No such values of lambda exist.>>>"
