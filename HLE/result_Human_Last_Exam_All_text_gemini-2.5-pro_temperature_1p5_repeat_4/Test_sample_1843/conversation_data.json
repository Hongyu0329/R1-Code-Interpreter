    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\n$N = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$\n\n### Step 2: Understand Primitive Characters and their Decomposition\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is uniquely determined by a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$, where $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a character modulo $p^k$.\nFor $\\chi$ to be a **primitive** character of conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ must be a **primitive** character of conductor $p^k$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$\n\nWe are looking for characters where this order is 6.\n\n### Step 3: Count the Primitive Characters for Each Conductor\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters of possible orders for each prime power conductor. The order of a component character must be a divisor of 6, since the lcm is 6. As primitive characters cannot have order 1, the possible orders are 2, 3, or 6.\n\nLet $C(p^k, d)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $p^k$ and order $d$.\n\n*   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$)**:\n    The group of characters mod 4 is of order $\\phi(4) = 2$. There is one principal character (conductor 1) and one primitive character. The primitive character has order 2.\n    $C(4, 2) = 1$.\n    $C(4, 3) = 0, C(4, 6) = 0$.\n\n*   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$)**:\n    The group of characters mod 9 is cyclic of order $\\phi(9) = 6$. The characters induced from mod 3 have orders dividing $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    The number of primitive characters of order $d$ is the total number of characters of order $d$ mod 9, minus those induced from mod 3.\n    - Order 2: Chars of order 2 mod 9 is $\\phi(2)=1$. Chars of order 2 mod 3 is $\\phi(2)=1$. So, $C(9, 2) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n    - Order 3: Chars of order 3 mod 9 is $\\phi(3)=2$. Chars of order 3 mod 3 is 0 (as 3 does not divide $\\phi(3)=2$). So, $C(9, 3) = 2 - 0 = 2$.\n    - Order 6: Chars of order 6 mod 9 is $\\phi(6)=2$. Chars of order 6 mod 3 is 0. So, $C(9, 6) = 2 - 0 = 2$.\n\n*   **Conductor 7**:\n    The group of characters mod 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7) = 6$. All non-principal characters are primitive.\n    - Order 2: $C(7, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Order 3: $C(7, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Order 6: $C(7, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n*   **Conductor 11**:\n    The group of characters mod 11 is cyclic of order $\\phi(11) = 10$. The order of a character must divide 10.\n    - Order 2: $C(11, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Order 3, 6: Not possible, as 3 and 6 do not divide 10. $C(11, 3) = 0, C(11, 6) = 0$.\n\n*   **Conductor 13**:\n    The group of characters mod 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13) = 12$.\n    - Order 2: $C(13, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    - Order 3: $C(13, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Order 6: $C(13, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nHere is a summary of the number of available primitive characters for each conductor and relevant order:\n\n| Conductor | Order 2 | Order 3 | Order 6 | Total Choices |\n|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------:|\n|     4     |    1    |    0    |    0    |       1       |\n|     9     |    0    |    2    |    2    |     2+2 = 4   |\n|     7     |    1    |    2    |    2    |     1+2+2 = 5 |\n|    11     |    1    |    0    |    0    |       1       |\n|    13     |    1    |    2    |    2    |     1+2+2 = 5 |\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Results\nWe need to select one primitive character for each conductor $p^k$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6. Let the orders be $(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13})$.\n\nFor the lcm to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n1.  At least one order must be divisible by 2.\n2.  At least one order must be divisible by 3.\n(Also, all orders must be divisors of 6, which is already true for our selection of possible orders).\n\nLet's check these conditions for any possible combination of primitive characters from our table:\n1.  **Divisibility by 2:** The character $\\chi_4$ must have order $o_4=2$. Since every combination includes this character, the lcm will always be divisible by 2.\n2.  **Divisibility by 3:** The character $\\chi_9$ must have order $o_9=3$ or $o_9=6$. In either case, its order is divisible by 3. Therefore, the lcm will always be divisible by 3.\n\nSince any valid combination of component primitive characters results in an lcm that is divisible by both 2 and 3, and all individual orders are divisors of 6, the lcm is always exactly 6.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Total Number\nThe total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component character.\nTotal choices = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\n\nUsing the totals from the table in Step 3:\nTotal = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal = $100$\n\nThus, there are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6."
