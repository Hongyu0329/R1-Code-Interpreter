    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of empty edge squares.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Edge Squares**\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has a perimeter of squares.\n*   The top row (rank 8) has 8 squares.\n*   The bottom row (rank 1) has 8 squares.\n*   The leftmost file (file 'a') has 8 squares, but the two corner squares (a1, a8) have already been counted. This adds 6 more squares.\n*   The rightmost file (file 'h') also has 8 squares, and its corners (h1, h8) have been counted. This adds another 6 squares.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Bishop's Attack and the Independence of Colors**\nA key characteristic of bishops is that they only move on diagonals of the same color. A bishop on a white square can only ever occupy or attack other white squares. A bishop on a black square can only ever occupy or attack other black squares.\n*   This means we can solve the problem for white edge squares and black edge squares independently and then combine the results.\n*   Of the 28 edge squares, exactly half are white and half are black. So, there are 14 white edge squares and 14 black edge squares.\n\n**Step 3: Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares**\nOur goal is to place as many bishops as possible on the 14 white edge squares without any two attacking each other.\n*   Let's try a systematic placement strategy. We can place bishops on all the white squares in the first row: **b1, d1, f1, h1**. This gives us 4 bishops that do not attack each other.\n*   Now, we must identify which of the other 10 white edge squares are attacked by these 4 bishops.\n    *   The bishop on **b1** attacks diagonally towards a2 and h7. So, squares `a2` and `h7` cannot have bishops.\n    *   The bishop on **d1** attacks diagonally towards a4 and h5. So, squares `a4` and `h5` cannot have bishops.\n    *   The bishop on **f1** attacks diagonally towards a6 and h3. So, squares `a6` and `h3` cannot have bishops.\n    *   The bishop on **h1** attacks diagonally towards a8. So, square `a8` cannot have a bishop.\n*   The squares eliminated by this placement are: `a2, h7, a4, h5, a6, h3, a8`. This is a total of 7 squares.\n*   The original 14 white edge squares are now accounted for as: 4 squares with bishops, 7 squares that are attacked and must be empty. This leaves 14 - 4 - 7 = 3 squares.\n*   These 3 remaining white edge squares are **c8, e8, g8**. We must check if they are attacked by the initial 4 bishops, or if they attack each other.\n    *   They do not attack each other as they are all in the same row.\n    *   They are not attacked by any of the bishops on the first row.\n*   Therefore, we can place bishops on these 3 squares as well.\n*   The maximum number of bishops we can place on white edge squares is 4 (on row 1) + 3 (on row 8) = **7 bishops**.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on Black Edge Squares**\nThe arrangement of black edge squares is symmetrical to the white ones. We can use the same logic.\n*   There are 14 black edge squares.\n*   Place bishops on all the black squares in the first row: **a1, c1, e1, g1**. This is 4 bishops.\n*   These 4 bishops will attack 7 other black edge squares (`a3, h6, a5, h4, a7, h2, h8`).\n*   This leaves 3 black edge squares available: **b8, d8, f8**. These are not mutually attacking and are not attacked by the bishops on the first row.\n*   We can place bishops on these 3 squares.\n*   The maximum number of bishops we can place on black edge squares is 4 + 3 = **7 bishops**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer**\n*   Total number of bishops placed = (Max on white squares) + (Max on black squares) = 7 + 7 = **14 bishops**.\n*   The question asks for the number of edge squares that would lack bishops (i.e., are empty).\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Number of occupied squares = 14.\n*   Number of empty squares = Total edge squares - Occupied squares.\n*   Number of empty squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
