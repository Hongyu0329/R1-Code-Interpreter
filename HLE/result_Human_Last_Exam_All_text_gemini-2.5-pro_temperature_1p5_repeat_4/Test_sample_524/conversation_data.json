    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes) of spaces that are simultaneously homogeneous, planar, and continua.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Definitions:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact and connected metric space. Since we are in the plane (a metric space), this means a closed, bounded, and connected subset of ℝ².\n    *   **Planar:** A space that can be embedded in the plane (ℝ²). This means it is homeomorphic to a subset of ℝ².\n    *   **Homogeneous:** A topological space X is homogeneous if for any two points x, y ∈ X, there exists a homeomorphism h: X → X such that h(x) = y. This implies the space has no special points; it \"looks the same\" everywhere.\n\n2.  **The Trivial Case: The Degenerate Continuum**\n    *   A continuum is called degenerate if it consists of a single point.\n    *   A **point** is compact, connected, and planar. It is also trivially homogeneous (for any two points x and y, they must be the same point, so the identity map works).\n    *   This gives us our first homeomorphism class: **the point**.\n\n3.  **Non-Degenerate Continua: Applying Classification Theorems**\n    Now, let's consider non-degenerate (not a single point) homogeneous planar continua. The classification of these objects is a deep result in topology. We can break down the problem by considering an important topological property: local connectivity.\n\n4.  **Case 1: Locally Connected Continua**\n    *   A space is locally connected if every point has a basis of connected neighborhoods. Intuitively, these are \"nice\" spaces without the strange local structure of fractals.\n    *   A famous theorem by R.H. Bing (1960), building on work by Mazurkiewicz, provides a complete classification for this case.\n    *   **Theorem (Bing):** Every non-degenerate, locally connected, homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to a simple closed curve.\n    *   A simple closed curve is, by definition, homeomorphic to a circle (S¹). The circle is indeed a non-degenerate, locally connected, homogeneous, planar continuum.\n    *   This gives us our second homeomorphism class: **the circle**.\n\n5.  **Case 2: Not Locally Connected Continua**\n    *   This is the more exotic case. These spaces are necessarily indecomposable, meaning they cannot be written as the union of two proper subcontinua.\n    *   To classify these, we use another key property: whether the space is tree-like. A continuum is tree-like if it does not contain any simple closed curve.\n\n6.  **Subcase 2a: Tree-like (and not locally connected)**\n    *   A fundamental theorem by J.T. Rogers, Jr. (1983) states that any non-degenerate, homogeneous, tree-like continuum is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc.\n    *   The **pseudo-arc** is a snake-like, indecomposable continuum that is famously homogeneous but not locally connected. It can be constructed in the plane, so it is planar.\n    *   The pseudo-arc is not homeomorphic to the point (it's non-degenerate) or the circle (it is tree-like, so it contains no circles).\n    *   This gives us our third homeomorphism class: **the pseudo-arc**.\n\n7.  **Subcase 2b: Not Tree-like (and not locally connected)**\n    *   This is the final possibility: a non-degenerate, homogeneous, planar continuum that is not locally connected and contains a simple closed curve.\n    *   For a long time, it was an open question what objects, if any, existed in this category. The complete classification of homogeneous planar continua was finalized in a 2011 paper by Janusz Prajs, James T. Rogers, Jr., and Lex G. Oversteegen.\n    *   **Theorem (Prajs, Rogers, Oversteegen):** There is exactly one such continuum, up to homeomorphism.\n    *   This unique object is known as the **circle of pseudo-arcs**. It can be visualized as a circle where each point has been replaced by a pseudo-arc. It is not locally connected and contains many simple closed curves, but it is not homeomorphic to the simple circle itself.\n    *   This gives us our fourth and final homeomorphism class: **the circle of pseudo-arcs**.\n\n**Conclusion and Final List**\n\nBy breaking down the problem using fundamental topological properties (degeneracy, local connectivity, and the tree-like property), we arrive at a complete list of all possible homeomorphism classes for homogeneous planar continua. These are:\n\n1.  **The Point** (degenerate)\n2.  **The Circle** (non-degenerate, locally connected)\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc** (non-degenerate, not locally connected, tree-like)\n4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs** (non-degenerate, not locally connected, not tree-like)\n\nThese four classes are topologically distinct from one another. Therefore, there are exactly four such classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
