To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its physical shape. When the sun rises, the UV light from the sun should cause the table to switch from its stable, extended *trans* form to a bent, more compact *cis* form. When the sun sets and the UV light is gone, the table must revert from its bent *cis* form back to the extended *trans* form through thermal relaxation.
