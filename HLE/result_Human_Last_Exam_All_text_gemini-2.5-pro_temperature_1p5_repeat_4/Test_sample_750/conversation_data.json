    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\n**Step 1: Set up the equation**\nLet the complex number $z$ be represented in its Cartesian form, $z = x + iy$, where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Left Hand Side (LHS)**\nThe left side of the equation is $z \\cdot i$.\n$z \\cdot i = (x + iy) \\cdot i = xi + i^2y = xi - y = -y + xi$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Right Hand Side (RHS)**\nThe right side of the equation is $i^z$. For complex numbers $a$ and $b$, $a^b$ is defined as $e^{b \\log a}$. The logarithm of a complex number is multi-valued.\nHere, $a=i$ and $b=z$.\nFirst, we find the logarithm of $i$. The general form is $\\log w = \\ln|w| + i(\\arg(w) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$.\nFor $w=i$, we have $|i| = 1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nSo, $\\log i = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nEach integer $k$ corresponds to a different branch of the logarithm.\n\nNow, we can write $i^z$:\n$i^z = e^{z \\log i} = e^{(x+iy) \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n$i^z = e^{(xi - y)(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\n$i^z = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) + ix(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\nThe equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ means that for a given $z$, there must be at least one integer $k$ for which the equality holds.\n\n**Step 4: Equate the LHS and RHS**\n$-y + xi = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} \\cdot e^{ix(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$\nThe term $e^{ix(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$ is a complex number with modulus 1. Thus, the modulus of the RHS is $e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\nThe modulus of the LHS is $|-y+xi| = \\sqrt{(-y)^2 + x^2} = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = |z|$.\n\n**Step 5: Equate the moduli and solve**\n$|z| = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\nWe can now look for solutions by considering specific cases.\n\n**Case 1: Real solutions ($y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, then $z=x$ is a real number.\nThe equation becomes $x \\cdot i = i^x$.\nTaking the modulus of both sides:\n$|xi| = |i^x|$\n$|x||i| = |e^{x \\log i}| = |e^{x \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}|$\n$|x| \\cdot 1 = 1$.\nSo, $|x|=1$, which means $x=1$ or $x=-1$.\n\n*   If $z=1$ ($x=1, y=0$):\n    LHS = $1 \\cdot i = i$.\n    RHS = $i^1 = e^{1 \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) + i\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = 0 + i(1) = i$.\n    This is true for all integers $k$. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n\n*   If $z=-1$ ($x=-1, y=0$):\n    LHS = $(-1) \\cdot i = -i$.\n    RHS = $i^{-1} = e^{-1 \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = \\cos(-\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2k\\pi) + i\\sin(-\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 2k\\pi) = 0 + i(-1) = -i$.\n    This is true for all integers $k$. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, then $z=iy$ is a purely imaginary number.\nThe equation becomes $(iy) \\cdot i = i^{iy}$.\n$-y = e^{iy \\log i} = e^{iy \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)} = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\nWe need to find real solutions $y$ to the equation $-y = e^{-y C_k}$ for some integer $k$, where $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)$.\n\n*   If $y>0$, the LHS ($-y$) is negative, while the RHS ($e^{\\dots}$) is always positive. No solution is possible.\n*   If $y=0$, we have $0=e^0=1$, which is false. $z=0$ is not a solution.\n*   If $y<0$, both sides are positive, so solutions may exist. Let $Y = -y > 0$. The equation becomes $Y = e^{Y C_k}$.\n\n    *   Subcase 2a: $k \\ge 0$.\n        Then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k) > 0$. Let's analyze the graphs of $f(Y)=Y$ and $g(Y)=e^{YC_k}$. The line $f(Y)$ passes through the origin with slope 1. The exponential curve $g(Y)$ starts at $(0,1)$. The initial slope of $g(Y)$ is $g'(0)=C_k$. For $k=0$, $C_0=\\pi/2 > 1$. For $k>0$, $C_k$ is even larger. Since $g(0)>f(0)$ and $g'(Y) > f'(Y)$ for $Y \\ge 0$, the graph of $g(Y)$ is always above the graph of $f(Y)$. Thus, there are no solutions for $Y>0$ when $k \\ge 0$.\n\n    *   Subcase 2b: $k \\le -1$.\n        Then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k) < 0$. Let $D_k = -C_k = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k) > 0$. The equation is $Y = e^{-Y D_k}$. Let's analyze $h(Y)=Y - e^{-YD_k}$. We are looking for roots of $h(Y)$ for $Y>0$.\n        $h(0) = -1$.\n        As $Y \\to \\infty$, $h(Y) \\to \\infty$.\n        The derivative is $h'(Y) = 1 + D_k e^{-YD_k} > 1$ for all $Y$.\n        Since $h(Y)$ is continuous and strictly increasing from a negative value to positive values, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists exactly one positive solution $Y_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$.\n        This corresponds to a solution $y_k = -Y_k$. So for each integer $k \\le -1$, we have a unique purely imaginary solution $z_k = iy_k$. These solutions can be expressed using the Lambert W function as $z_k = i\\frac{W(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n\n**Case 3: General complex solutions ($x \\ne 0$ and $y \\ne 0$)**\nA full analysis of the system of equations for $x$ and $y$ becomes extremely complicated:\n1.  $-y = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\cos(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$\n2.  $x = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\sin(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$\nIt can be shown that this system does not yield any other solutions that can be expressed in a closed form with elementary functions. The analysis confirms that the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$ are consistent with this system, but no further general solutions are found.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe set of all solutions for $z \\cdot i = i^z$ consists of two real numbers and an infinite series of purely imaginary numbers.\n\nThe solutions are:\n1.  $z = 1$\n2.  $z = -1$\n3.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = iy_k$ for each integer $k \\le -1$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative real number satisfying the equation $-y_k = \\exp(-y_k \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))$.\n\n<<<The solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and for each integer $k \\le -1$, a unique purely imaginary solution $z_k = iy_k$ where $y_k$ is the negative real number satisfying $-y = e^{-y\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$.>>>"
