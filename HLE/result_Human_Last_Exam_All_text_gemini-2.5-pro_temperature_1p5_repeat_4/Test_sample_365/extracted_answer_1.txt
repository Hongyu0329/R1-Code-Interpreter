The product is a tricyclic ketone. Its structure consists of a central six-membered ring fused to two separate five-membered rings. The molecular formula remains the same as the starting material. Key structural features are: 1. A ketone group at the original C2 position. 2. A new five-membered ring containing a double bond (C1=C6) and the gem-dimethoxy group at C7, which is fused to the central six-membered ring. 3. The original cyclopentyl ring (retaining the OTBS group) is now also fused to the central six-membered ring. This overall transformation is the result of a stereospecific anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement that opens the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene ring system.
