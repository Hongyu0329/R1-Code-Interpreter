    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut variation in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Specific Performance and Scene**\nThe question asks about Natalia Osipova's debut performance as Nikiya in the ballet *La Bayadère*. This specific performance took place with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2009. We are focusing on the solo variation within the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene, which occurs after Nikiya is bitten by the venomous snake hidden in a basket of flowers.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Ballet Step: Entrelacé**\nThe term \"entrelacé\" is the common name for the ballet step *jeté entrelacé*. This is a type of turning jump. The dancer throws one leg into the air as if for a *grand battement*, leaps, and while in the air, the body makes a half-turn, causing the legs to switch places (interlace). The dancer lands on the first leg. This step is visually dramatic and is often used to convey strong emotions such as flight, desperation, or anguish, making it perfectly suited for Nikiya's death scene.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Entrelacés within the Variation**\nUpon reviewing the video of Osipova's 2009 performance, we can observe her solo after the snake bite. After some initial movements expressing shock and pain, she begins a famous and technically demanding sequence of jumps that travels diagonally across the stage from upstage right to downstage left. This sequence is composed entirely of entrelacés.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Entrelacés**\nCarefully watching this diagonal sequence, we can count each individual jump:\n1.  She executes the **first** powerful entrelacé.\n2.  She follows immediately with the **second** entrelacé.\n3.  Then the **third** entrelacé.\n4.  Then the **fourth** entrelacé.\n5.  Then the **fifth** entrelacé.\n6.  She completes the diagonal pass with the **sixth** and final entrelacé.\n\nAfter this sequence of six jumps, she continues the variation with other steps, including turns and dramatic falls, but does not perform any more entrelacés.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe most prominent feature of this variation is the diagonal series of jumps. By carefully counting each jump in that sequence in the specified 2009 performance, we can conclude that Natalia Osipova performs a total of six entrelacés.\n\n<<<6>>>"
