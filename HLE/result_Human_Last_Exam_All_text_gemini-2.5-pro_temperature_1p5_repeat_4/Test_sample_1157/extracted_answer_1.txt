**Management Plan Summary:**
1.  **Immediate Medical Referral:** To manage uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%).
2.  **Emergency Dental Care:** Wound cleaning, suturing, prescription of antibiotics and analgesics, and fabrication of a temporary aesthetic partial denture.
3.  **Definitive Treatment (after healing and medical stabilization):** A Cast Metal Removable Partial Denture is a safe and appropriate choice.

**Cells of Interest:**
The primary cells of interest are the **non-viable Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells** on the avulsed teeth, which preclude replantation. In the healing process, the function of **osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and immune cells (neutrophils, macrophages)** is compromised by her uncontrolled diabetes, increasing risks of poor healing and infection.

**Denture Replacement Details:**
*   **Type:** Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD).
