    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the \"rule activation level\" of a fuzzy rule within an Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS) framework.\n\n### Step 2: Deconstruct the Terminology\n*   **Rule Activation Level (or Firing Strength):** In a fuzzy inference system, rules are typically in an \"IF-THEN\" format. The \"IF\" part is the antecedent, and the \"THEN\" part is the consequent. The rule activation level is a value that quantifies how well the current input matches the conditions in the antecedent. This value is determined solely from the \"IF\" part of the rule.\n*   **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS):** This specifies the type of fuzzy set being used. While IT3 FSs are complex and designed to handle high levels of uncertainty, the fundamental concept of rule activation remains the same: it's the firing strength of the antecedent.\n*   **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`:** In fuzzy logic notation, `Φ_k(x')` (or `τ_k(x')`, `w_k`) is the standard representation for the firing strength or activation level of the k-th rule for a specific input `x'`. This value is the result of evaluating the antecedent.\n*   **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`:** This represents a membership grade.\n    *   `μ` denotes a membership function.\n    *   `G_k` typically represents the fuzzy set in the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) of the k-th rule.\n    *   `y_j` is a point in the output universe of discourse.\n    *   This term signifies the degree of membership of an output value `y_j` in the consequent fuzzy set `G_k`. This information is used *after* the activation level has been determined to compute the rule's output.\n*   **t-norm operation:** A t-norm (e.g., minimum, product) is a mathematical operator used to model the logical \"AND\" conjunction. In fuzzy rules, if the antecedent has multiple conditions linked by \"AND\" (e.g., \"IF temperature is HIGH AND humidity is LOW\"), a t-norm is used to combine the membership values of each condition to get the single overall activation level for the rule.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Process\n1.  A fuzzy inference process begins by taking an input `x'`.\n2.  For each rule, the system calculates how well the input `x'` satisfies the antecedent (\"IF\" part). This calculation uses a t-norm if there are multiple conditions and results in a single value called the **rule activation level**.\n3.  The problem states that the result of this step for the k-th rule is `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n4.  The information `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9` pertains to the consequent (\"THEN\" part) of the rule. This value is not the activation level; rather, it is part of the output fuzzy set that gets modified *by* the activation level in the next stage of inference (implication).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion of Analysis\nThe question asks for the rule activation level. The problem explicitly provides this value through the variable `Phi_k(x′)`, which is defined as the firing strength of the rule's antecedent. The other pieces of information (`μG_k_j(y_j)` and the mention of a t-norm) are contextual details about other parts of the fuzzy inference process but are not the answer itself. The activation level is the result from the antecedent, which is given as 0.7.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe rule activation level is determined by the firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule. In this problem, the firing level of the antecedent is given by `Phi_k(x′)`.\n\nGiven: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
