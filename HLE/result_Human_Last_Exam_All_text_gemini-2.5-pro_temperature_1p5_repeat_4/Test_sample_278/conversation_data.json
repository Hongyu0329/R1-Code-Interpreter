    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Parametric Curve:**\n    The curve is defined by $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b \\sin t$, where the value of `b` depends on the interval of the parameter `t`. We need to analyze the shape of the curve in two parts.\n\n2.  **Part 1: t ∈ [0, π]**\n    *   For this interval, `b = 1`.\n    *   The parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n    *   We can see that $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of a unit circle.\n    *   As `t` goes from 0 to π, `sin t` is non-negative ($y \\ge 0$).\n    *   This part of the curve traces the upper semi-circle of the unit circle, starting from (1, 0), going through (0, 1), and ending at (-1, 0).\n    *   For this section, the range of x is [-1, 1] and the range of y is [0, 1].\n    *   $x_{max1} = 1$, $x_{min1} = -1$.\n    *   $y_{max1} = 1$, $y_{min1} = 0$.\n\n3.  **Part 2: t ∈ (π, 2π)**\n    *   For this interval, `b = 5`.\n    *   The parametric equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5 \\sin t$.\n    *   We can write this as $x = \\cos t$ and $y/5 = \\sin t$.\n    *   Squaring and adding gives $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 (along the x-axis) and a semi-major axis of 5 (along the y-axis).\n    *   As `t` goes from π to 2π, `sin t` is non-positive ($y \\le 0$).\n    *   This part of the curve traces the lower semi-ellipse, starting from just after (-1, 0), going through (0, -5), and ending just before (1, 0).\n    *   For this section, the range of x is (-1, 1) and the range of y is [-5, 0).\n    *   $x_{max2} \\to 1$, $x_{min2} \\to -1$.\n    *   $y_{max2} \\to 0$, $y_{min2} = -5$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Bounding Box of the Entire Figure:**\n    To find the smallest square that outcircles the figure, we first need to find the overall extent of the figure. We combine the ranges from both parts.\n    *   **Overall x-range:** The union of [-1, 1] and (-1, 1) is [-1, 1]. So, the minimum x-value is $x_{min} = -1$ and the maximum x-value is $x_{max} = 1$.\n    *   **Overall y-range:** The union of [0, 1] and [-5, 0) is [-5, 1]. So, the minimum y-value is $y_{min} = -5$ and the maximum y-value is $y_{max} = 1$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Dimensions of the Bounding Box:**\n    *   The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    *   The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n6.  **Find the Smallest Circumscribing Square:**\n    *   A square that outcircles (circumscribes) the figure must have a side length, `s`, that is large enough to contain both the width and the height of the figure.\n    *   This means the side length `s` must be at least as large as the maximum of the width and the height.\n    *   $s = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest possible square that can contain this figure has a side length of 6.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Area of the Square:**\n    *   The area of a square is the side length squared.\n    *   Area = $s^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognize that the parameter `b` changes, resulting in a composite figure made of two different curves (a semi-circle and a semi-ellipse).\n*   Correctly determine the range of x and y values for each part of the curve.\n*   Combine the ranges to find the overall maximum and minimum coordinates for the entire figure.\n*   Understand that the side length of the smallest circumscribing square is determined by the larger dimension (width or height) of the figure's bounding box.\n*   The final step is to calculate the area from this side length, not the area of the bounding rectangle."
