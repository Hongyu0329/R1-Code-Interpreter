Yes, the theory can fail. This happens if the birefringent medium violates the underlying assumptions of the theory. Two primary examples are: 1) The medium has polarizing properties (diattenuation), which can make the system's transmission matrix non-invertible. 2) The medium exhibits non-linear optical behavior (like the Kerr effect), where the birefringence itself depends on light intensity, invalidating the linear model upon which the theory is based.
