    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Roman Numerals and Convert to Modern Numbers**\nThe first step is to correctly interpret each Roman numeral and convert it into its modern (Arabic) number equivalent.\n\n*   **XXIV**:\n    *   `X` represents 10.\n    *   `IV` represents 4 (since `I` comes before `V`, it is subtracted: 5 - 1 = 4).\n    *   Therefore, `XXIV` = 10 + 10 + 4 = **24**.\n\n*   **CCC**:\n    *   `C` represents 100.\n    *   Therefore, `CCC` = 100 + 100 + 100 = **300**.\n\n*   **CXXXI**:\n    *   `C` represents 100.\n    *   `X` represents 10.\n    *   `I` represents 1.\n    *   Therefore, `CXXXI` = 100 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 1 = **131**.\n\n**Step 2: Rewrite the Equation with Modern Numbers**\nNow, substitute the converted numbers back into the original equation:\n`XXIV / CCC - CXXXI = ?`\nbecomes\n`24 / 300 - 131 = ?`\n\n**Step 3: Follow the Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)**\nTo solve the equation correctly, we must follow the mathematical order of operations. This means we perform Division before Subtraction.\n\n*   **Part 1: Division**\n    First, calculate the division part of the equation: `24 / 300`.\n    `24 ÷ 300 = 0.08`\n\n*   **Part 2: Subtraction**\n    Next, substitute the result of the division back into the equation and perform the subtraction:\n    `0.08 - 131`\n\n*   **Part 3: Final Calculation**\n    `0.08 - 131 = -130.92`\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Roman Numeral Rules:** Be careful with subtractive notation (e.g., `IV` is 4, not 6).\n2.  **Order of Operations:** The most critical point is to perform the division (`XXIV / CCC`) *before* the subtraction. A common mistake would be to calculate `CCC - CXXXI` first, which would be incorrect.\n3.  **Decimal and Negative Numbers:** The calculation involves a decimal (`0.08`) and results in a negative number.\n\nThe solution to the equation is **-130.92**.\n\n<<<-130.92>>>"
