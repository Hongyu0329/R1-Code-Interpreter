    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks to identify a specific novel based on two key pieces of information from a quote by the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n    *   **A description of the novel:** It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   **A description of the author:** He is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Clue 1: The Novel's Description.** The phrase \"intensity of a tiger\" suggests a work that is fierce, powerful, and primal in its emotional impact. The phrase \"the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" suggests a work with a highly structured, intricate plot where a limited set of elements (like chess pieces) are combined in complex and strategic ways. This points to a book that is both passionate and intellectually rigorous in its construction.\n    *   **Clue 2: The Author's Description.** The author is linked to the American novelist William Faulkner, known for his complex narrative structures, stream-of-consciousness style, and creation of the fictional Yoknapatawpha County.\n        *   \"**Continuator**\": This implies the author follows in the literary tradition of Faulkner, adopting similar themes or techniques. Many Latin American writers of the \"Boom\" period were heavily influenced by Faulkner.\n        *   \"**Simplifier**\": This is a crucial distinction. It means that while the author uses Faulknerian elements, they are presented in a more direct, concise, or accessible manner, rather than replicating Faulkner's famously dense and convoluted prose.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Hypothesize:**\n    We are looking for a major Latin American novel praised by Borges. The author must be one known for his connection to Faulkner, but with a style that is more pared-down. Let's consider potential candidates:\n    *   Gabriel García Márquez: Influenced by Faulkner, but his style in *One Hundred Years of Solitude* is more magical and expansive than \"simplified.\"\n    *   Mario Vargas Llosa: Also influenced by Faulkner, but his novels like *Conversation in the Cathedral* are known for their own structural complexity, not simplification.\n    *   Juan Rulfo: The Mexican author is famous for his novel *Pedro Páramo*. This novel is renowned for its fragmented structure and non-linear timeline, showing a clear Faulknerian influence. However, it is also very short, and its prose is famously stark, spare, and concise. Rulfo fits the description of a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" perfectly.\n\n4.  **Locate the Source:**\n    The quotes are from a specific text written by Borges. A search confirms that Borges wrote a prologue for the 1970 Seix Barral edition of Juan Rulfo's novel **_Pedro Páramo_**. In this prologue, Borges makes both of the statements mentioned in the question. He explicitly praises the novel's combination of raw power and intricate structure and defines Rulfo's relationship to his literary predecessor, Faulkner, in precisely those terms.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The novel Borges describes as having \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\" is *Pedro Páramo*. The author he describes as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is the novel's author, Juan Rulfo.\n\n***\n\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
