The best replacement would be to mutate all four amino acids—Serine (S) at position 47, Glutamate (E) at 48, Glutamate (E) at 49, and Aspartate (D) at 50—to Alanine (A). This S47A/E48A/E49A/D50A quadruple mutant directly removes the negative charges and the site of phosphorylation, providing the clearest test of the hypothesis that this negatively charged patch is autoinhibitory.
