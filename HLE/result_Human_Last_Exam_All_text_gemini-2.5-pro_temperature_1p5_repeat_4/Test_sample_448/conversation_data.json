    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring ones on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n*(Oganesson is a synthetic element and does not occur naturally, so it is not considered.)*\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the rarest noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\". This means we need to consider the total amount of each gas on the entire planet (atmosphere, crust, oceans, etc.). The year specified, 2002, does not significantly impact the result, as the natural abundances of these elements are stable over very long geological timescales.\n\n**Step 3: Gather and Compare Abundance Data**\nWhile concentrations vary in different parts of the Earth (e.g., atmosphere vs. crust), the primary reservoir for these gases in their elemental form is the atmosphere. We can use atmospheric concentrations as a strong proxy for their overall rarity as free elements.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** By far the most common noble gas. It makes up about 0.934% (or 9,340 parts per million, ppm) of the Earth's atmosphere. Its abundance comes from the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere, with a concentration of about 18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** The third most abundant, with an atmospheric concentration of about 5.2 ppm. Although it's produced by radioactive decay in the crust, its low mass allows it to escape into space, keeping its atmospheric concentration relatively low.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Significantly rarer than the previous three, with an atmospheric concentration of about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Even rarer than Krypton, with an atmospheric concentration of only about 0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion, ppb).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Special Case of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is different from the other noble gases because it is radioactive and has a very short half-life (the most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of just 3.8 days).\n*   **Source:** It is continuously generated from the radioactive decay of radium, which is part of the decay chain of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust.\n*   **Decay:** Because it decays so quickly, it never accumulates in the atmosphere or anywhere else in significant quantities. Its presence is transient.\n*   **Concentration:** Radon's concentration is extremely low and highly variable. It is typically measured not in ppm, but in terms of radioactivity (Becquerels per cubic meter) or as a mole fraction. Its average atmospheric concentration is on the order of 1 part per quintillion (10^21). This is roughly equivalent to 0.000000000001 ppm.\n\n**Step 5: Final Comparison and Conclusion**\nLet's compare the rarest of the stable noble gases, Xenon, with Radon.\n*   **Xenon (Xe) concentration:** ~0.087 ppm\n*   **Radon (Rn) concentration:** ~0.000000000001 ppm\n\nThe concentration of Radon is many millions of times lower than that of Xenon. Therefore, at any given moment, Radon is by far the rarest noble gas present on Earth.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The distinction between stable noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) and the radioactive noble gas (Rn) is crucial.\n*   Radon's rarity is a direct result of its short half-life, which prevents it from accumulating.\n*   The term \"all terrestrial matter\" reinforces this conclusion, as Radon's total mass across the entire planet (atmosphere and crust combined) at any one time is minuscule compared to any other noble gas.\n*   The year 2002 is not a relevant factor for changing the relative order of abundance.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
