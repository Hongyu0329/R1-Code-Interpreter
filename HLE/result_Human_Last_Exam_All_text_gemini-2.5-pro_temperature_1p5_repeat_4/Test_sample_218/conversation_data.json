    "An irreducible representation (irrep) of the symmetric group $S_n$ is uniquely determined, up to isomorphism, by a partition of $n$. A partition of a positive integer $n$ is a sequence of positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ such that $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i = n$. We need to find the number of partitions $\\lambda$ of $n=25$ for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep, denoted $d_\\lambda$, is strictly less than 500,000.\n\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is calculated using the hook-length formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h_{ij}}$,\nwhere the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$.\n\nThe general principle is that dimensions are smaller for partitions whose Young diagrams are \"long and thin\" or \"short and wide\". These correspond to partitions of the form $(n-k, \\mu)$, where $k$ is a small integer and $\\mu$ is a partition of $k$. For each such partition $\\lambda$, its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ has the same dimension, $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. Since for the partitions we will find, $\\lambda \\neq \\lambda'$, each successful find contributes two irreps to our count. We will therefore count the number of such partitions (or pairs of conjugate partitions).\n\nLet's systematically check partitions of the form $\\lambda = (25-k, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of $k$, for small values of $k$.\n\n**Case k=0:** $n=25$.\n*   The only partition of 0 is the empty partition. This gives the partition $\\lambda = (25)$.\n    *   $d_{(25)} = 1$. This is < 500,000.\n    *   Its conjugate is $\\lambda' = (1^{25})$, for which $d_{(1^{25})} = 1$.\n    *   This gives us 2 irreps. (1 pair)\n\n**Case k=1:** Partitions of 25 of the form $(24, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 1.\n*   The only partition of 1 is (1). This gives $\\lambda = (24, 1)$.\n    *   $d_{(24,1)} = n-1 = 24$. This is < 500,000.\n    *   Its conjugate is $(2, 1^{23})$.\n    *   This gives us another 2 irreps. (1 pair)\n\n**Case k=2:** Partitions of 25 of the form $(23, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 2.\n*   Partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2} - \\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$. This is < 500,000.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 1, 1)$: $d_{(23,1,1)} = \\binom{24}{2} = \\frac{24 \\times 23}{2} = 276$. This is < 500,000.\n    *   Both partitions and their conjugates have dimensions below the threshold. This gives 4 irreps. (2 pairs)\n\n**Case k=3:** Partitions of 25 of the form $(22, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 3.\n*   Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 3)$: $d_{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3} - \\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$. (< 500k)\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 1, 1, 1)$: $d_{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = \\frac{24 \\times 23 \\times 22}{6} = 2024$. (< 500k)\n    *   $\\lambda = (22, 2, 1)$: $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4025$. (< 500k)\n    *   All 3 partitions (and their conjugates) work. This gives 6 irreps. (3 pairs)\n\n**Case k=4:** Partitions of 25 of the form $(21, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 4.\n*   There are 5 partitions of 4: (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1,1,1,1).\n    *   $d_{(21,4)} = 10,350$.\n    *   $d_{(21,3,1)} = 31,350$.\n    *   $d_{(21,2,2)} = 21,000$.\n    *   $d_{(21,2,1,1)} = 31,625$.\n    *   $d_{(21,1^4)} = 10,626$.\n    *   All 5 partitions result in dimensions well below 500,000. This gives 10 irreps. (5 pairs)\n\n**Case k=5:** Partitions of 25 of the form $(20, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 5.\n*   There are 7 partitions of 5.\n    *   $d_{(20,5)} = 40,480$.\n    *   $d_{(20,4,1)} = 101,400$.\n    *   $d_{(20,3,2)} = 90,300$.\n    *   $d_{(20,3,1,1)} = 154,350$.\n    *   $d_{(20,2,2,1)} = 121,800$.\n    *   $d_{(20,2,1^3)} = 155,100$.\n    *   $d_{(20,1^5)} = 42,504$.\n    *   All 7 partitions yield dimensions below 500,000. This gives 14 irreps. (7 pairs)\n\n**Case k=6:** Partitions of 25 of the form $(19, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 6.\n*   There are 11 partitions of 6. We check the dimensions starting from the \"edge\" partitions.\n    *   $d_{(19,6)} = \\binom{25}{6} - \\binom{25}{5} = 177,100 - 53,130 = 123,970$. (< 500k)\n    *   $d_{(19,1^6)} = \\binom{24}{6} = 134,596$. (< 500k)\n    *   $d_{(19,5,1)} = 453,756$. (< 500k)\n    *   $d_{(19,4,2)} = 531,300$. (> 500k)\n    *   Other partitions of the form $(19,\\mu)$ which are \"more central\" than (19,4,2) will have even larger dimensions. So only 3 partitions of 6 work. This gives 6 irreps. (3 pairs)\n\n**Case k=7:** Partitions of 25 of the form $(18, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 7.\n*   There are 15 partitions of 7.\n    *   $d_{(18,7)} = \\binom{25}{7} - \\binom{25}{6} = 480,700 - 177,100 = 303,600$. (< 500k)\n    *   $d_{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104$. (< 500k)\n    *   $d_{(18,6,1)}$ can be calculated to be over 1,400,000, which is too large. Any other partitions will also have larger dimensions.\n    *   So, only 2 partitions of 7 work. This gives 4 irreps. (2 pairs)\n\n**Case k=8:** Partitions of 25 of the form $(17, \\mu)$ where $\\mu$ is a partition of 8.\n*   The dimension for the \"edge\" partition $\\lambda=(17,8)$ is $d_{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8} - \\binom{25}{7} = 1,081,575 - 480,700 = 600,875$. This is > 500,000.\n*   The dimension for the other \"edge\" partition $\\lambda=(17,1^8)$ is $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471$. This is > 500,000.\n*   Since the dimensions for the most extreme partitions for k=8 already exceed the threshold, no other partitions for k=8 will work, and the same holds for any $k > 8$.\n\n**Total Count:**\nWe sum the number of pairs found and multiply by 2 (since none of these partitions are self-conjugate).\n*   k=0: 1 pair\n*   k=1: 1 pair\n*   k=2: 2 pairs\n*   k=3: 3 pairs\n*   k=4: 5 pairs\n*   k=5: 7 pairs\n*   k=6: 3 pairs\n*   k=7: 2 pairs\n*   kâ‰¥8: 0 pairs\n\nTotal pairs = $1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 2 = 24$.\nTotal number of irreps = $24 \\times 2 = 48$."
