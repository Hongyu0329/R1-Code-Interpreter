    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing is a historical sound change in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it occurs in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of a word). For this rule to apply, two main conditions must be met:\n1.  The word must have at least three syllables.\n2.  The vowel in question must be in the antepenultimate syllable and must be tense in a related, shorter word.\n\nCommon Tense → Lax vowel pairs for TSL:\n*   /iː/ (as in *ser**ee**ne*) → /ɛ/ (as in *ser**e**nity*)\n*   /eɪ/ (as in *s**a**ne*) → /æ/ (as in *s**a**nity*)\n*   /aɪ/ (as in *div**i**ne*) → /ɪ/ (as in *div**i**nity*)\n*   /uː/ (as in *prof**ou**nd*) → /ʌ/ (as in *prof**u**ndity*)\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Word**\n\n*   **southern**:\n    *   **Syllables**: Two (`south-ern`).\n    *   **Analysis**: This word does not have three syllables, so it cannot undergo trisyllabic laxing. The vowel change from the root word `south` (/aʊ/) to `southern` (/ʌ/) is a different type of historical shortening, but it is not TSL.\n\n*   **derivative**:\n    *   **Syllables**: Four (`de-riv-a-tive`). The antepenultimate syllable is `-riv-`.\n    *   **Related Word**: `derive` (/dɪˈraɪv/). The vowel is the tense diphthong /aɪ/.\n    *   **Analysis**: In `derivative`, the tense /aɪ/ vowel from `derive` is in the antepenultimate syllable and becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/. This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**:\n    *   **Syllables**: Four (`se-ren-i-ty`). The antepenultimate syllable is `-ren-`.\n    *   **Related Word**: `serene` (/səˈriːn/). The vowel is the tense /iː/.\n    *   **Analysis**: In `serenity`, the tense /iː/ vowel from `serene` is in the antepenultimate syllable and becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/. This is another clear example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**:\n    *   **Syllables**: Two (`pleas-ant`).\n    *   **Analysis**: This word only has two syllables, so it cannot undergo trisyllabic laxing. The change from the tense vowel /iː/ in the root word `please` to the lax vowel /ɛ/ in `pleasant` is a different historical process called pre-cluster shortening (shortening before a consonant cluster). It is not TSL.\n\n*   **gratitude**:\n    *   **Syllables**: Three (`grat-i-tude`). The antepenultimate syllable is `grat-`.\n    *   **Related Word**: `grateful` (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/). The vowel is the tense diphthong /eɪ/.\n    *   **Analysis**: In `gratitude`, the vowel corresponding to the /eɪ/ in `grateful` is in the antepenultimate syllable and becomes the lax vowel /æ/. This fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**:\n    *   **Syllables**: Two (`shad-ow`).\n    *   **Analysis**: This word has only two syllables, so the condition for trisyllabic laxing is not met. Furthermore, its vowel does not result from the shortening of a long vowel in a related word. The word comes from Old English *sceadu*, where the first vowel was already short. It has not undergone any laxing process because its vowel was never tense to begin with.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\n*   `derivative`, `serenity`, and `gratitude` all show clear evidence of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   `southern` and `pleasant` do not undergo TSL because they are only two syllables long, although they do exhibit a different type of vowel shortening from their root words.\n*   `shadow` does not undergo TSL because it is only two syllables long, and more importantly, its root vowel was historically short and never underwent any kind of laxing from a tense state.\n\nOf the options that did not undergo TSL (`southern`, `pleasant`, `shadow`), **shadow** is the most definitive answer because not only does it fail the syllable count, but its vowel history involves no laxing from a tense vowel at all.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
