    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the User's Question:** The user wants to know the specific year that Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan started to \"publicly identify himself as Azikiwe.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Premise:** The question assumes that \"Azikiwe\" is a name that he either adopted, added, or began emphasizing at a certain point in his public life. This implies there was a time before that year when he was not publicly known by or did not use the name \"Azikiwe.\"\n\n3.  **Fact-Check the Name:** The first and most critical step is to verify Goodluck Jonathan's full and legal name. His official name is **Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan**. \"Azikiwe\" is one of his given middle names.\n\n4.  **Investigate the Name's Origin:** It is important to understand where the name came from. \"Azikiwe\" is not a name he chose for political reasons (e.g., to associate with Nigeria's first president, Nnamdi Azikiwe). It is a family name, given to him at birth in honor of his paternal grandfather.\n\n5.  **Evaluate \"Publicly Identify\":** Since \"Azikiwe\" has been part of his legal name since birth, he has been \"publicly identified\" with it on all official documents throughout his entire life. This includes his birth certificate, school records, and all documents related to his political career, from his time as Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State onwards.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The premise of the question is flawed. There was no single year or event where Goodluck Jonathan began to \"publicly identify himself as Azikiwe\" because the name has always been part of his identity. As he rose to national prominence, his full name simply became more widely known to the public. There is no record of him ever being known officially by another name and then adding \"Azikiwe.\"\n\nTherefore, the question cannot be answered with a specific year because the event it describes never happened.\n\n<<<There is no specific year when this occurred because \"Azikiwe\" has been part of Goodluck Jonathan's legal name since his birth. He did not adopt the name or begin using it at a specific point in time; it has always been his official name."
