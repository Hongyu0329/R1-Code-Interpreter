    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function $f$.**\n\nLet the given equation be $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity of $f$**:\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ for some $x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. Using the given equation, this means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is injective (one-to-one), it follows that $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of $f$**:\n    A continuous and injective function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n    *   **Case 1: $f$ is strictly increasing.** If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$. Applying the increasing function $f$ again preserves the inequality: $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means $\\exp(x_1) < \\exp(x_2)$, which is true since $\\exp(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. This case is consistent.\n    *   **Case 2: $f$ is strictly decreasing.** If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$. Applying the decreasing function $f$ again reverses the inequality: $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$. This means $\\exp(x_1) < \\exp(x_2)$, which is also consistent with the properties of $\\exp(x)$.\n    However, if $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, it must have a unique fixed point. That is, there exists a unique $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. To see this, consider the function $h(x) = f(x) - x$. Since $f$ is decreasing, $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} h(x) = -\\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} h(x) = +\\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a point $x_0$ where $h(x_0)=0$.\n    If such a fixed point $x_0$ exists, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$. But from the original equation, $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$. So we must have $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$. The equation $\\exp(x) = x$ has no real solutions (since $\\exp(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$). Therefore, $f$ cannot have a fixed point, and thus cannot be strictly decreasing.\n\n    **Conclusion:** Any solution $f$ must be a strictly increasing continuous function.\n\n3.  **Behavior of $f(x)$ relative to $x$**:\n    Since $f$ is continuous, the function $f(x) - x$ is also continuous. As we've shown $f(x) - x$ can never be zero, it must be either always positive or always negative.\n    *   If $f(x) < x$ for all $x$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining these, we get $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. However, we need $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$, and we know $\\exp(x) > x$ for all $x$. This is a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This is consistent with $f(f(x)) > f(x) > x$, and $\\exp(x)>x$.\n\n**Step 2: Constructing the solutions.**\n\nThe problem of finding a function $f$ such that $f(f(x)) = g(x)$ (where $g$ is a given function, here $\\exp(x)$) is a classic functional equation problem. For a strictly increasing function $g$ with $g(x) > x$, we can construct solutions. The number of solutions depends on the number of ways we can \"seed\" the construction.\n\nThe construction proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Choose a starting point.** Let's pick $x_0 = 0$.\n2.  **Determine initial values.** We need to define $f(0)$. Let $f(0) = y_0$. From $f(x) > x$, we must have $y_0 = f(0) > 0$.\n    Now consider $f(f(0)) = \\exp(0) = 1$. This means $f(y_0) = 1$.\n    Since $f$ is strictly increasing and $y_0 > 0$, we must have $f(y_0) > f(0)$, which means $1 > y_0$.\n    So, any choice for the value of $f(0)$ must be a constant $y_0$ in the interval $(0, 1)$.\n\n3.  **Define $f$ on a fundamental interval.** For any choice of $y_0 \\in (0,1)$, we have fixed the values of $f$ at two points: $f(0) = y_0$ and $f(y_0) = 1$. Since $f$ must be strictly increasing, we can define $f$ on the interval $[0, y_0]$ as any strictly increasing continuous function $h(x)$ that maps $[0, y_0]$ to $[y_0, 1]$. That is, we choose a function $h$ such that:\n    *   $h:[0, y_0] \\to [y_0, 1]$\n    *   $h(0) = y_0$ and $h(y_0) = 1$.\n    *   $h$ is continuous and strictly increasing.\n    Let's set $f(x) = h(x)$ for $x \\in [0, y_0]$.\n\n4.  **Extend the definition of $f$ to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.**\n    Once $f$ is defined on $[0, y_0]$, its definition on the rest of $\\mathbb{R}$ is determined by the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ and the property that $f$ commutes with $\\exp$ (i.e., $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$).\n    *   For $x \\in [y_0, 1]$, $x$ can be written as $x=f(z)$ for a unique $z \\in [0, y_0]$ (since $f$ on $[0,y_0]$ is a bijection to $[y_0,1]$). We then define $f(x) = f(f(z)) = \\exp(z) = \\exp(f^{-1}(x))$.\n    *   This process can be continued to define $f$ on a sequence of intervals that covers $[0, \\infty)$.\n    *   A similar process using $f^{-1}(x) = \\ln(f(x))$ (which requires $f(x)>0$, a condition satisfied by our construction) allows extending the definition to $(-\\infty, 0)$.\n    This construction yields a single, well-defined, continuous, and strictly increasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfies the original equation.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of possible solutions.**\n\nThe set of solutions is determined by the possible choices we can make during the construction. The choices were:\n1.  The value of $y_0 = f(0)$, which can be any real number in $(0, 1)$.\n2.  For a *fixed* $y_0$, the choice of the function $h: [0, y_0] \\to [y_0, 1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the cardinality of these choices.\n1.  The set of possible values for $y_0$ is the interval $(0, 1)$. The cardinality of this set is $c$ (the cardinality of the continuum, i.e., $|\\mathbb{R}|$).\n2.  For any fixed $y_0 \\in (0, 1)$, we need to count the number of strictly increasing continuous functions $h$ from $[0, y_0]$ to $[y_0, 1]$. This is equivalent to counting the number of strictly increasing homeomorphisms from a closed interval to another. By a simple linear transformation of the domain and range, this is equivalent to counting the number of strictly increasing homeomorphisms from $[0, 1]$ to $[0, 1]$.\n    There are infinitely many such functions. For example, for any real number $a > 0$, the function $\\phi(t) = t^a$ is a valid homeomorphism from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$. Since there are $c$ choices for $a$, there are at least $c$ such functions. The set of all continuous functions from $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$ has cardinality $c$, so there are at most $c$ such homeomorphisms. Thus, for each fixed $y_0$, there are $c$ choices for the function $h$.\n\nTwo different choices lead to two different solution functions $f$.\n*   If we choose different values for $y_0$, say $y_A \\ne y_B$, the resulting functions $f_A$ and $f_B$ will be different because $f_A(0) = y_A \\ne y_B = f_B(0)$.\n*   If we fix $y_0$ but choose two different functions $h_1$ and $h_2$, the resulting solutions $f_1$ and $f_2$ will differ on the interval $[0, y_0]$ and thus will be different functions.\n\nThe total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices at each step.\nTotal cardinality = (Number of choices for $y_0$) $\\times$ (Number of choices for $h$ for each $y_0$).\nTotal cardinality = $c \\times c = c$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $c$."
