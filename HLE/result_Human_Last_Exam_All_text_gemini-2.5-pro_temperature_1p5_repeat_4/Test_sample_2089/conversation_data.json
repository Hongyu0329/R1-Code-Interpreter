    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nFirst, let's break down the key elements required by the question:\n1.  **Oscar-nominated film:** The movie must have received at least one Academy Award nomination.\n2.  **A specific character:** The action is performed by one character.\n3.  **A specific action:** The character says the words \"Thank you\".\n4.  **A specific location/context:** This occurs while the character is boarding a bus.\n5.  **A specific consequence:** This act \"seals his fate,\" which strongly implies it leads to his death or downfall.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate Potential Films\nBased on these specific clues, we can analyze several well-known Oscar-nominated films that feature fateful moments.\n\n*   **Possibility 1: *No Country for Old Men* (2007)**\n    *   **Oscar-nominated?** Yes, it won Best Picture.\n    *   **Analysis:** This film has scenes involving buses and fateful encounters. Llewelyn Moss takes a bus while on the run. In one scene, a man gets off the bus and says \"Thank you\" to the driver, but this is an unnamed character and not the one whose fate is sealed. Llewelyn's fate is sealed by the transponder in the case of money, not by anything said on a bus. Therefore, this film does not match the specific details.\n\n*   **Possibility 2: *The Departed* (2006)**\n    *   **Oscar-nominated?** Yes, it won Best Picture.\n    *   **Analysis:** This film is filled with characters whose fates are sealed in dramatic fashion (e.g., Captain Queenan on the rooftop, Billy Costigan in the elevator). However, none of these pivotal scenes involve a character boarding a bus and saying \"Thank you.\" The key events happen in other locations. Therefore, this film is not a match.\n\n*   **Possibility 3: *L.A. Confidential* (1997)**\n    *   **Oscar-nominated?** Yes, it was nominated for nine Oscars, including Best Picture, and won two.\n    *   **Analysis:** Let's examine a key scene early in the film.\n        *   **Character:** The character is Dick Stensland, the corrupt ex-partner of detective Bud White.\n        *   **Context:** Having been fired from the police force (partly due to Bud White's actions), Stensland is disgraced and leaving Los Angeles.\n        *   **The Scene:** Bud White watches as Stensland boards a bus to leave town. Just as he gets on, Stensland turns to White and says a bitter, sarcastic \"Thank you.\"\n        *   **Sealing his fate:** This is the last time Stensland is seen alive. His decision to stay in town just a little longer leads him to the Nite Owl coffee shop that very night, where he becomes a victim of the \"Nite Owl Massacre,\" the central crime of the film. Boarding the bus and saying that line is his final act before walking into his doom. All the elements from the question align perfectly with this scene.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe film that features a character sealing his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is *L.A. Confidential*. The character is Dick Stensland, and his sarcastic remark to Bud White is his final appearance before he is murdered, setting the main plot in motion.\n\n<<<L.A. Confidential>>>"
