    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Generalized Quaternion Group**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted as $Q_{4n}$, has the presentation:\n$Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFor the generalized quaternion group of size 128, we have $|G| = 4n = 128$, which implies $n = 32$.\nSo, we are analyzing the group $G = Q_{128}$, with the presentation:\n$G = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nThe elements of $G$ are of the form $x^i$ for $0 \\le i < 64$ and $x^j y$ for $0 \\le j < 64$. The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Power Subgroups**\n\nA power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup of the form $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ for some positive integer $k$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups of this form for $G = Q_{128}$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the $k$-th Powers of Elements in $G$**\n\nWe need to compute the $k$-th power of every element $g \\in G$. There are two types of elements.\n1.  For elements of the form $x^i$, the $k$-th power is simply $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$.\n2.  For elements of the form $x^j y$, the calculation depends on the parity of $k$.\n    *   $(x^j y)^2 = x^j y x^j y = x^j (y x^j y^{-1}) y^2 = x^j (x^{-j}) y^2 = y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    *   If $k$ is even, let $k = 2m$. Then $(x^j y)^k = (x^j y)^{2m} = ((x^j y)^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$. Note that $m=k/2$, so this is $x^{16k}$.\n    *   If $k$ is odd, let $k = 2m+1$. Then $(x^j y)^k = (x^j y)^{2m+1} = ((x^j y)^{2m})(x^j y) = x^{32m} x^j y$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Structure of $G^k$ based on the parity of $k$**\n\nWe now determine the subgroup $G^k$ generated by all these $k$-th powers.\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is odd**\nLet $k=2m+1$. The generators of $G^k$ are:\n*   The set $\\{ (x^i)^k = x^{ik} \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\}$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64) = 1$. This means the subgroup generated by these elements is $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k,64)} \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle$. Thus, $\\langle x \\rangle \\subseteq G^k$.\n*   The set $\\{ (x^j y)^k = x^{32m} x^j y \\mid 0 \\le j < 64 \\}$.\nSince $\\langle x \\rangle \\subseteq G^k$, the element $x$ is in $G^k$. This implies $x^{32m}$ is also in $G^k$.\nConsider one of the generators from the second set, for instance, $g_0 = x^{32m} y$ (when $j=0$).\nSince $x^{32m} \\in G^k$, we can form the element $(x^{32m})^{-1} g_0 = (x^{32m})^{-1} (x^{32m} y) = y$.\nSo, $y$ must be in $G^k$.\nSince both $x$ and $y$ are in $G^k$, $G^k$ must be the entire group $G = \\langle x, y \\rangle = Q_{128}$.\n**Conclusion for odd k:** For any odd integer $k$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is $Q_{128}$. This gives us **1** unique power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is even**\nLet $k=2m$. The generators of $G^k$ are:\n*   The set $\\{ (x^i)^k = x^{ik} \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\}$. This set generates the subgroup $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n*   The set $\\{ (x^j y)^k = x^{32m} = x^{16k} \\mid 0 \\le j < 64 \\}$. This is just a single element, $x^{16k}$.\nSo, $G^k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)}, x^{16k} \\rangle$.\nThe generated subgroup is $\\langle x^{\\gcd(\\gcd(k, 64), 16k)} \\rangle = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64, 16k)} \\rangle$.\nSince $k$ is a divisor of $16k$, $\\gcd(k, 64, 16k) = \\gcd(k, 64)$.\n**Conclusion for even k:** For any even integer $k$, the power subgroup is $G^k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Number of Distinct Subgroups from the Even Case**\n\nWe need to find how many distinct subgroups of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ exist, where $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ for some even integer $k > 0$.\n1.  **Properties of d:** Since $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$, $d$ must be a divisor of 64. The divisors of $64=2^6$ are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n2.  Since $k$ is even, $k$ is a multiple of 2. Therefore, $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ must also be a multiple of $\\gcd(2, 64) = 2$. So $d$ must be an even divisor of 64.\n3.  The even divisors of 64 are $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n4.  **Achievability:** For each even divisor $d$ from this set, can we find an even $k$ such that $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$? Yes, we can simply choose $k=d$. Since $d$ is even, this choice is valid.\n    *   $k=2 \\implies d=\\gcd(2,64)=2$. Subgroup is $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$.\n    *   $k=4 \\implies d=\\gcd(4,64)=4$. Subgroup is $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$.\n    *   $k=8 \\implies d=\\gcd(8,64)=8$. Subgroup is $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$.\n    *   $k=16 \\implies d=\\gcd(16,64)=16$. Subgroup is $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$.\n    *   $k=32 \\implies d=\\gcd(32,64)=32$. Subgroup is $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$.\n    *   $k=64 \\implies d=\\gcd(64,64)=64$. Subgroup is $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$.\n5.  These 6 subgroups are all distinct, as they are cyclic subgroups of $\\langle x \\rangle$ with different orders (32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, respectively).\n**Conclusion for even k:** There are **6** unique power subgroups that arise from even values of $k$.\n\n**Step 6: Final Count**\n\nThe set of all power subgroups of $Q_{128}$ is the union of the subgroups found in the two cases:\n*   From odd $k$: $\\{Q_{128}\\}$\n*   From even $k$: $\\{\\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}\\}$\n\nThese two sets of subgroups are disjoint because $Q_{128}$ is non-abelian, while all the subgroups from the even case are cyclic (and thus abelian).\n\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is the sum of the counts from each case: $1 + 6 = 7$.\n\n<<<7>>>"
