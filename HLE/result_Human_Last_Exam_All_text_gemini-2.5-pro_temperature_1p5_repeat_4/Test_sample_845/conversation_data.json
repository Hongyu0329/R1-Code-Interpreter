    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Topic:** Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measurement.\n    *   **Technology:** Photoplethysmography (PPG).\n    *   **Process:** Capturing \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **Core Question:** What is the specific name for the value (the interval) computed between heartbeats?\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physiology and Technology:**\n    *   A heartbeat causes a pulse of blood to travel through the arteries.\n    *   **ECG (Electrocardiogram)** measures the heart's electrical activity. The most prominent spike in this signal is the \"R-wave\". The time between two consecutive R-waves is the most common way to measure the time between heartbeats.\n    *   **PPG (Photoplethysmography)**, as mentioned in the question, uses light to measure changes in blood volume in the capillaries. Each pulse of blood creates a peak in the PPG waveform.\n    *   The time measured between consecutive peaks in the PPG signal corresponds to the time between consecutive heartbeats.\n\n3.  **Identify the Terminology:**\n    *   The time interval between two consecutive heartbeats is the fundamental data point for HRV analysis.\n    *   If measured using an ECG, this interval is called the **R-R interval** (or RRi), named after the R-waves.\n    *   If measured using a PPG, it is technically called a **Peak-to-Peak interval** (PPi) or more generally, an **Inter-beat Interval** (IBI).\n    *   However, because ECG was the original gold standard, the term \"R-R interval\" is very often used as a general term for the beat-to-beat interval, even when the data is collected via PPG.\n\n4.  **Refine the Answer (Filtering):**\n    *   For accurate HRV analysis, not all heartbeats are considered equal. Beats that are not generated by the heart's natural pacemaker (the sinus node), such as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or artifacts from motion, are usually filtered out.\n    *   The R-R intervals that remain after filtering out these abnormal beats are called **Normal-to-Normal intervals** (or NN intervals).\n    *   HRV is most accurately calculated from this series of NN intervals.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Select the Best Term:**\n    *   The question asks for the name of the *value* computed between heartbeats.\n    *   \"R-R interval\" is the most widely recognized and standard term for this value in the context of HRV, even when the source is PPG.\n    *   \"Inter-beat Interval\" (IBI) is a correct and more general term.\n    *   \"Normal-to-Normal interval\" (NN interval) is the term for the *filtered* value used in high-quality analysis.\n    *   Given the common parlance in both clinical and consumer-wearable fields, **R-R interval** is the most direct and common answer.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Source Dependency:** The technical name for the interval can depend on the sensor (R-R for ECG, Peak-to-Peak for PPG). However, \"R-R interval\" is often used as a catch-all term.\n*   **Raw vs. Processed Data:** The raw interval is the R-R interval or IBI. The cleaned, analysis-ready interval is the NN interval.\n*   **The Value vs. the Variability:** The R-R interval is a single value (a duration in milliseconds). HRV is not a single value but a set of statistical metrics (like SDNN or RMSSD) that describe the *variability* of a whole series of R-R intervals. The question asks for the name of the base value, not the final HRV metric.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most common and standard name for the value measured between heartbeats to compute HRV is the R-R interval.\n\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
