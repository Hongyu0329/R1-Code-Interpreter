No, homopolynucleotides are not, structurally, polysaccharides. They are two fundamentally different classes of biological macromolecules with distinct monomers, backbone structures, and chemical bonds. While both are polymers, a polysaccharide is a chain of monosaccharides linked by glycosidic bonds, whereas a polynucleotide is a chain of nucleotides (composed of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base) linked by a sugar-phosphate backbone with phosphodiester bonds.
