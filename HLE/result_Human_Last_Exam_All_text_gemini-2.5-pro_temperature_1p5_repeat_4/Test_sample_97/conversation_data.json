    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria.**\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is added to pure water, it dissolves and participates in multiple simultaneous equilibria:\n1.  **Dissolution of the solid:** Al(OH)₃ dissolves to produce aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this process is the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷\n\n2.  **Formation of a complex ion:** The dissolved aluminum ions (Al³⁺) can react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, K_f.\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹\n\n3.  **Autoionization of water:** Water itself establishes an equilibrium between hydronium ions (H⁺ or H₃O⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    The ion product for water is K_w.\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25°C)\n\n**Careful Point:** Because both dissolution and complex formation occur, the solubility is not simply calculated from K_sp alone. We must account for both aluminum-containing species in the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Molar Solubility (S).**\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the total concentration of dissolved aluminum in all its forms in a saturated solution.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Step 3: Set up the governing equation using charge balance.**\nFor any solution to be electrically neutral, the total positive charge must equal the total negative charge. The ions in the solution are Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\nCharge Balance Equation: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Careful Point:** The charge balance equation is the most rigorous way to relate all the species concentrations and is crucial for solving this type of complex equilibria problem.\n\n**Step 4: Express all concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻].**\nWe can use the equilibrium constant expressions to relate the concentration of each ion to the concentration of OH⁻.\n*   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   From K_w: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n*   To find [Al(OH)₄⁻], we can combine the K_sp and K_f expressions:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻]\n\n**Step 5: Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation.**\nReplacing each concentration in the charge balance equation with its equivalent expression in terms of [OH⁻]:\n3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻])\n\n**Step 6: Solve the equation for [OH⁻].**\nTo simplify, multiply the entire equation by [OH⁻]³:\n3 * K_sp + K_w * [OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻]⁴\nRearrange this into a polynomial form:\n(1 + K_f * K_sp) * [OH⁻]⁴ - K_w * [OH⁻]² - 3 * K_sp = 0\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of [OH⁻]². Let Y = [OH⁻]².\n(1 + K_f * K_sp) * Y² - K_w * Y - 3 * K_sp = 0\nNow, let's plug in the numerical values:\n*   A = 1 + K_f * K_sp = 1 + (1.1 * 10³¹) * (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) = 1 + 5.83 * 10⁴ = 58301\n*   B = -K_w = -1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴\n*   C = -3 * K_sp = -3 * (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) = -1.59 * 10⁻²⁶\n\nSolve the quadratic equation AY² + BY + C = 0 for Y:\nY = [ -B ± sqrt(B² - 4AC) ] / 2A\nY = [ 1.0*10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt((-1.0*10⁻¹⁴)² - 4 * (58301) * (-1.59*10⁻²⁶)) ] / (2 * 58301)\nY = [ 1.0*10⁻¹⁴ ± sqrt(1.0*10⁻²⁸ + 3.7057*10⁻²¹) ] / (116602)\nSince the second term under the square root is much larger than the first, we have:\nY ≈ [ 1.0*10⁻¹⁴ + sqrt(3.7057*10⁻²¹) ] / 116602\nY ≈ [ 1.0*10⁻¹⁴ + 6.087*10⁻¹¹ ] / 116602\nY ≈ (6.088 * 10⁻¹¹) / 116602 ≈ 5.221 * 10⁻¹⁶ M²\nNow, find [OH⁻]:\n[OH⁻] = sqrt(Y) = sqrt(5.221 * 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 * 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the final solubility, S.**\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of hydroxide, we can find the concentrations of the aluminum species and sum them to get the solubility.\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.44 * 10⁻⁴ M\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻] = (5.83 * 10⁴) * (2.285 * 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 * 10⁻³ M\n\nNow, calculate the total solubility S:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = 4.44 * 10⁻⁴ M + 1.33 * 10⁻³ M\nS = 0.444 * 10⁻³ M + 1.33 * 10⁻³ M\nS = 1.774 * 10⁻³ M\n\n**Final Answer:**\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants.\nS ≈ 1.8 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8E-3>>>"
