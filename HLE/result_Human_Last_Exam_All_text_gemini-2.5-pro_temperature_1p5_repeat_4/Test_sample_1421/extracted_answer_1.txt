The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by the functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields $\psi(\tau)$ and $\bar{\psi}(\tau)$:
$Z = \int_{\text{A.P.B.C.}} \mathcal{D}\bar{\psi} \mathcal{D}\psi \, e^{-S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi]}$
where the Euclidean action $S_E$ is:
$S_E[\bar{\psi}, \psi] = \int_0^\beta d\tau \left( \sum_i \bar{\psi}_i(\tau) \partial_\tau \psi_i(\tau) + H(\{\bar{\psi}_i(\tau)\}, \{\psi_i(\tau)\}) \right)$
The integral is subject to Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions (A.P.B.C.) in imaginary time $\tau$:
$\psi_i(\beta) = -\psi_i(0)$ and $\bar{\psi}_i(\beta) = -\bar{\psi}_i(0)$
Here, $\beta$ is the inverse temperature, and $H(\bar{\psi}, \psi)$ is the classical symbol corresponding to the normal-ordered Hamiltonian operator.
