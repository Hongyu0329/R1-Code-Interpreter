    "The problem asks for the formula of the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation, derived using Feynman's path integral formalism. This involves transitioning from the operator-based definition in quantum statistical mechanics to a functional integral over classical anti-commuting fields.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Starting Point - The Partition Function in Statistical Mechanics**\n\nThe canonical partition function (Z) for a quantum system in thermal equilibrium at temperature T is defined as the trace of the statistical operator, $\\hat{\\rho} = e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the inverse temperature ($k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant) and $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator of the system.\n$Z = \\text{Tr}\\left(e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}\\right)$\nThe trace (Tr) operation means summing over the diagonal elements in any complete orthonormal basis $\\{|n\\rangle\\}$: $Z = \\sum_n \\langle n | e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}} | n \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 2: Introducing the Path Integral - Imaginary Time Slicing**\n\nThe core idea of the path integral is to express the operator $e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}}$ as a product of operators for infinitesimal imaginary time steps. We slice the total imaginary time interval $\\beta$ into $N$ small steps of duration $\\Delta\\tau = \\beta/N$.\n$e^{-\\beta \\hat{H}} = e^{-\\Delta\\tau \\hat{H}} \\cdot e^{-\\Delta\\tau \\hat{H}} \\cdots e^{-\\Delta\\tau \\hat{H}} \\quad (N \\text{ times})$\nWe then insert a complete set of states between each of these factors.\n\n**Step 3: The Challenge with Fermions and the Solution using Grassmann Variables**\n\nFor standard bosonic particles, we can insert position eigenstates. However, for fermions, which obey the Pauli exclusion principle, the wavefunction must be anti-symmetric. This anti-symmetry is naturally handled in the path integral formalism by using **Grassmann numbers** (anti-commuting variables).\n\n*   We introduce a set of Grassmann variables, $\\psi_i$ and $\\bar{\\psi}_i$, corresponding to the fermionic annihilation ($\\hat{c}_i$) and creation ($\\hat{c}^\\dagger_i$) operators. These variables anti-commute with each other:\n    $\\psi_i \\psi_j = -\\psi_j \\psi_i$,  $\\bar{\\psi}_i \\bar{\\psi}_j = -\\bar{\\psi}_j \\bar{\\psi}_i$, $\\psi_i \\bar{\\psi}_j = -\\bar{\\psi}_j \\psi_i$.\n*   We use a basis of fermionic **coherent states**, $|\\psi\\rangle$, which are eigenstates of the annihilation operators: $\\hat{c}_i |\\psi\\rangle = \\psi_i |\\psi\\rangle$.\n*   The identity operator is expressed as an integral over these coherent states: $\\hat{1} = \\int d\\bar{\\psi} d\\psi \\, e^{-\\sum_i \\bar{\\psi}_i \\psi_i} |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\bar{\\psi}|$. The integration is a Berezin integral, defined for Grassmann variables.\n\n**Step 4: The Trace and the Origin of Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions**\n\nA crucial step is evaluating the trace using the coherent state basis. The trace of an operator $\\hat{A}$ is given by:\n$\\text{Tr}(\\hat{A}) = \\int d\\bar{\\psi} d\\psi \\, e^{-\\sum_i \\bar{\\psi}_i \\psi_i} \\langle-\\psi|\\hat{A}|\\psi\\rangle$\nNotice the minus sign in $\\langle-\\psi|$. This property arises from the anti-commuting nature of the Grassmann variables when calculating the trace. When we apply this to the full partition function and insert resolutions of identity at each time slice, this minus sign translates directly into the boundary condition. The field at the end of the imaginary time interval, $\\tau = \\beta$, must be the negative of the field at the beginning, $\\tau=0$. This is the **anti-periodic boundary condition (A.P.B.C.)**, a hallmark of fermionic path integrals.\n\n**Step 5: The Continuum Limit and the Euclidean Action**\n\nAfter inserting the identity operator at each time slice and evaluating the matrix element of the infinitesimal time evolution operator $e^{-\\Delta\\tau \\hat{H}}$, we take the continuum limit where $N \\to \\infty$ and $\\Delta\\tau \\to 0$. In this limit:\n*   The product of integrals over the Grassmann variables at each time slice becomes a functional integral, denoted by $\\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi}\\mathcal{D}\\psi$.\n*   The sum over the discrete time steps in the exponent becomes an integral over the continuous imaginary time variable $\\tau$: $\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\Delta\\tau \\to \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau$.\n*   The finite differences in the fields become time derivatives: $(\\psi_{k+1}-\\psi_k)/\\Delta\\tau \\to \\partial_\\tau\\psi(\\tau)$.\n\nThe resulting expression for the partition function is a functional integral weighted by the exponential of the negative of the **Euclidean Action**, $S_E$.\n\n### Final Formula and Careful Points\n\nThe fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by:\n\n$Z = \\int_{\\text{A.P.B.C.}} \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\n\nwhere:\n\n1.  **Functional Integral:** $\\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi$ denotes the integration over all possible paths of the independent Grassmann-valued fields $\\psi(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau)$.\n\n2.  **Euclidean Action ($S_E$):** The action in the exponent is given by:\n    $S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left[ \\sum_i \\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi_i(\\tau) + H(\\{\\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau)\\}, \\{\\psi_i(\\tau)\\}) \\right]$\n    *   $\\int_0^\\beta d\\tau$ is the integral over imaginary time, from 0 to the inverse temperature $\\beta$.\n    *   $\\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi_i(\\tau)$ is the kinetic term. A key feature is that it is first-order in the time derivative, unlike the second-order derivative found in bosonic systems.\n    *   $H(\\{\\bar{\\psi}_i\\}, \\{\\psi_i\\})$ is the Hamiltonian function (or symbol) obtained from the normal-ordered operator Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}(\\{\\hat{c}^\\dagger_i\\}, \\{\\hat{c}_i\\})$ by replacing creation operators $\\hat{c}^\\dagger_i$ with $\\bar{\\psi}_i$ and annihilation operators $\\hat{c}_i$ with $\\psi_i$. If a chemical potential $\\mu$ is included, this term is typically replaced by $H - \\mu N$, where $N$ is the number operator symbol $\\sum_i \\bar{\\psi}_i\\psi_i$.\n\n3.  **Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions (A.P.B.C.):** The integral is restricted to paths that satisfy these boundary conditions, which are a direct consequence of Fermi-Dirac statistics:\n    $\\psi_i(\\tau = \\beta) = -\\psi_i(\\tau = 0)$\n    $\\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau = \\beta) = -\\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau = 0)$\n\nThis formula is a cornerstone of many-body quantum theory, allowing for the application of field-theoretic methods to problems in condensed matter and nuclear physics.\n\n<<<The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is given by the functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields $\\psi(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\tau)$:\n$Z = \\int_{\\text{A.P.B.C.}} \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, e^{-S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}$\nwhere the Euclidean action $S_E$ is:\n$S_E[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\left( \\sum_i \\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau) \\partial_\\tau \\psi_i(\\tau) + H(\\{\\bar{\\psi}_i(\\tau)\\}, \\{\\psi_i(\\tau)\\}) \\right)$\nThe integral is subject to Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions (A.P.B.C.) in imaginary time $\\tau$:\n$\\psi_i(\\beta) = -\\psi_i(0)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}_i(\\beta) = -\\bar{\\psi}_i(0)$\nHere, $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature, and $H(\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi)$ is the classical symbol corresponding to the normal-ordered Hamiltonian operator.>>>"
