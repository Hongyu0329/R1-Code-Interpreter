    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the \"Second Great War\":** The Second Great War is the primary conflict depicted in the *StarCraft II* trilogy. It begins with the initial Zerg invasion of the Terran Dominion in *Wings of Liberty* and concludes with the final defeat of the dark god Amon in the *Legacy of the Void* epilogue.\n\n2.  **Identify the Start Year:** The conflict begins in the year **2504**. This is four years after the end of the Brood War and marks the start of the *Wings of Liberty* campaign, when the Zerg Swarm, under the new Queen of Blades, launches a full-scale invasion of Dominion space starting with Mar Sara.\n\n3.  **Identify the End Year:** The conflict ends in the year **2506**. This year sees the culmination of the Protoss campaign in *Legacy of the Void*, including the reclamation of their homeworld, Aiur. The war officially concludes after the joint Terran, Protoss, and Zerg forces venture into the Void to defeat Amon once and for all in the epilogue, *Into the Void*, which also takes place in 2506.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration:**\n    *   The war begins sometime in 2504.\n    *   The events of *Heart of the Swarm* span from late 2504 into 2505.\n    *   The war against Amon and the events of *Legacy of the Void* take place across 2505 and 2506.\n    *   The final battle and end of the war occur in 2506.\n\n    This means the war spanned across a portion of 2504, the entire calendar year of 2505, and a portion of 2506.\n\n5.  **Consider the \"Rounded Up\" Requirement:**\n    *   The total duration covers parts of three different calendar years (2504, 2505, 2506).\n    *   The elapsed time is therefore guaranteed to be more than one full year (as it includes all of 2505).\n    *   Considering the scale of the events—Kerrigan's de-infestation and re-empowerment, her campaign to reunite the Swarm, Artanis uniting the scattered Protoss tribes and rebuilding the Golden Armada—the total time elapsed is certainly more than two full years.\n    *   For example, if the war started in March 2504 and ended in April 2506, the duration would be 2 years and 1 month.\n    *   Since the total duration is greater than 2 years but less than 3 years, rounding this value **up** to the nearest whole number gives a final answer of 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **\"How long\" vs. \"Years spanned\":** The question asks \"how long,\" which refers to the total elapsed time, not just the difference in the start and end year numbers (2506 - 2504 = 2).\n*   **Lore Gaps:** There are periods between the campaigns where significant time passes (e.g., Artanis rebuilding the Golden Armada). These gaps contribute to the total duration, pushing it over two full years.\n*   **Rounding Rule:** The instruction to \"round up\" is crucial. Any duration that is not an exact integer must be rounded to the next highest integer. Since the war's duration is between 2 and 3 years, rounding up results in 3.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis of the StarCraft lore timeline, the Second Great War started in 2504 and ended in 2506, with a total elapsed time of over two years. Rounding this duration up to the nearest year gives us the final answer.\n\n<<<3>>>"
