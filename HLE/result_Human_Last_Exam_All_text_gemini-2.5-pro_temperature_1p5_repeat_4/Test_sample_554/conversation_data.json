    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\n\n*   **Nanocar:** This is not a standard IUPAC name but a trivial name for a molecule designed to resemble a car, typically having a chassis, axles, and four wheels. Since the question is hypothetical, we must choose a reasonable and representative chemical structure.\n*   **Perfluoro-:** This is a standard chemical prefix meaning that all hydrogen (H) atoms on the parent hydrocarbon structure have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Identify a Representative Structure for a \"Nanocar\"**\n\nThe original, famous nanocar from Rice University has fullerene (C₆₀) \"wheels.\" However, fullerenes contain no hydrogen atoms, so the \"perfluoro-\" prefix wouldn't apply to them in the intended way (H -> F replacement). For the term \"perfluoronanocar\" to be meaningful for the entire structure, we should assume a model built entirely from a hydrocarbon framework where all parts have hydrogens that can be substituted.\n\nA plausible and commonly depicted structure for a conceptual nanocar consists of:\n*   A **chassis:** A central planar group. A `1,2,4,5`-substituted benzene ring is an excellent candidate.\n*   **Axles:** Linkers between the chassis and wheels. Ethynyl groups (`-C≡C-`) are perfect for this role.\n*   **Wheels:** A simple, planar, wheel-like hydrocarbon group. Phenyl groups (`-C₆H₅`) are a logical choice.\n\nCombining these parts, we get the molecule **1,2,4,5-tetrakis(phenylethynyl)benzene**. This structure is chemically sound and visually resembles a car.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Hydrogen Atoms in the Parent Nanocar Structure**\n\nWe need to count every hydrogen atom in `1,2,4,5-tetrakis(phenylethynyl)benzene`. Let's break the molecule down into its components:\n\n1.  **The Chassis:** The chassis is a central benzene ring (`C₆H₆`) that is substituted at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. This means four of its hydrogen atoms have been replaced by the axle groups, leaving **2 hydrogen atoms** on the chassis itself (at positions 3 and 6).\n2.  **The Wheels:** There are four wheels, and each is a phenyl group (`-C₆H₅`). A phenyl group has **5 hydrogen atoms**.\n3.  **The Axles:** The axles are ethynyl groups (`-C≡C-`). They do not contain any hydrogen atoms.\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   Hydrogens on the central chassis: 2\n*   Hydrogens on the four wheels: 4 wheels × 5 hydrogens/wheel = 20\n*   **Total Hydrogens:** 2 + 20 = **22 hydrogen atoms**\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Number of Fluorine Atoms in the Perfluoronanocar**\n\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" means we replace every one of the 22 hydrogen atoms in the parent molecule with a fluorine atom.\n\nTherefore, the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar is equal to the total number of hydrogen atoms in the parent hydrocarbon nanocar.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nNumber of Fluorine atoms = Total number of Hydrogen atoms = **22**\n\n<<<22>>>"
