    "This problem asks for the number of distinct elements in the homology cobordism group, $\\Theta^3_H$, that can be obtained by performing integral surgery on knots with four or fewer crossings.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Preliminaries\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta^3_H$):** This is the set of oriented homology 3-spheres, where two spheres $M_1$ and $M_2$ are considered equivalent if there exists a smooth, oriented 4-manifold $W$ with boundary $\\partial W = M_1 \\cup (-M_2)$ such that the homology groups of $M_1$ and $M_2$ are isomorphic to the homology groups of $W$. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** For a knot $K \\subset S^3$, an integral surgery produces a manifold $S^3_n(K)$ for some integer $n$. For the resulting manifold to be a homology sphere (i.e., having the same integral homology as $S^3$), the first homology group $H_1(S^3_n(K); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$ must be trivial. This requires $|n|=1$. Therefore, we only need to consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on each knot.\n*   **Knots with at most 4 crossings:** We use the standard Alexander-Briggs notation.\n    *   0 crossings: The unknot ($0_1$).\n    *   3 crossings: The right-handed trefoil knot ($3_1$). We must also consider its mirror image, the left-handed trefoil, as it is a distinct knot (it is chiral).\n    *   4 crossings: The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is amphicheiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n*   **Invariants:** To distinguish elements in $\\Theta^3_H$, we use homology cobordism invariants. The two primary classical invariants are:\n    1.  The **Casson invariant**, $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. It is a homomorphism $\\lambda: \\Theta^3_H \\to \\mathbb{Z}$. For a surgery manifold, $\\lambda(S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)) = \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\Delta_K''(1)$, where $\\Delta_K(t)$ is the Alexander polynomial of $K$.\n    2.  The **Rokhlin invariant**, $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. It is a homomorphism $\\mu: \\Theta^3_H \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    These two are not always sufficient to distinguish all elements; finer invariants from Heegaard-Floer theory (like the d-invariants) are sometimes needed.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Knot\n\nWe now examine the homology spheres obtained from surgery on each knot.\n\n1.  **The Unknot ($0_1$)**\n    *   Surgery on the unknot yields the standard 3-sphere: $S^3_{\\pm 1}(0_1) = S^3$.\n    *   This represents the identity element in $\\Theta^3_H$.\n    *   **Contribution: 1 element.**\n\n2.  **The Trefoil Knot ($3_1$)**\n    *   **Right-handed trefoil ($3_1$):**\n        *   $+1$ surgery: $S^3_1(3_1)$ is the famous Poincaré homology sphere, $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. Its Casson invariant is $\\lambda=1$ and its Rokhlin invariant is $\\mu=0$. This is a non-trivial element of infinite order.\n        *   $-1$ surgery: $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$ is the Poincaré sphere with the opposite orientation, $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. Its invariants are $\\lambda=-1$ and $\\mu=0$. This is the inverse of the element above and is distinct from it.\n    *   **Left-handed trefoil (mirror of $3_1$):**\n        *   $+1$ surgery: $S^3_1(-3_1)$ is the Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$. It also has invariants $\\lambda=1$ and $\\mu=0$. Although its classical invariants match those of $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$, it is known to be a distinct element in $\\Theta^3_H$ (distinguished by Heegaard-Floer invariants).\n        *   $-1$ surgery: $S^3_{-1}(-3_1)$ is $-\\Sigma(2,3,7)$. Its invariants are $\\lambda=-1$ and $\\mu=0$. This is the inverse of $[\\Sigma(2,3,7)]$ and is distinct from the other three trefoil-derived spheres.\n    *   **Contribution: 4 distinct, non-trivial elements.**\n\n3.  **The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n    *   The figure-eight knot is amphicheiral, so we only need to analyze surgery on $4_1$.\n    *   The Alexander polynomial is $\\Delta_{4_1}(t) = -t + 3 - t^{-1}$, so $\\Delta_{4_1}''(1) = -2$.\n    *   $+1$ surgery: The manifold $M = S^3_1(4_1)$ has Casson invariant $\\lambda(M) = \\frac{1}{2}(-2) = -1$. It is a well-known result that its Rokhlin invariant is $\\mu(M)=1$.\n    *   $-1$ surgery: The manifold $S^3_{-1}(4_1)$ is orientation-reversely diffeomorphic to $S^3_1(4_1)$, i.e., it is $-M$. Its invariants are $\\lambda(-M) = -(-1)=1$ and $\\mu(-M) = \\mu(M) = 1$.\n    *   The Rokhlin invariant for these two spheres is 1, while it is 0 for all the spheres derived from the trefoil knots. Therefore, these two new elements are distinct from the previous ones. They are also distinct from each other as their Casson invariants differ.\n    *   **Contribution: 2 distinct, non-trivial elements.**\n\n### Step 3: Summarize and Count the Elements\n\nLet's list all the distinct elements we have found in the homology cobordism group $\\Theta^3_H$:\n\n1.  **$[S^3]$**: The identity element (from the unknot).\n2.  **$[\\Sigma(2,3,5)]$**: From $+1$ surgery on the right-handed trefoil. $(\\lambda=1, \\mu=0)$.\n3.  **$[-\\Sigma(2,3,5)]$**: From $-1$ surgery on the right-handed trefoil. $(\\lambda=-1, \\mu=0)$.\n4.  **$[\\Sigma(2,3,7)]$**: From $+1$ surgery on the left-handed trefoil. $(\\lambda=1, \\mu=0)$.\n5.  **$[-\\Sigma(2,3,7)]$**: From $-1$ surgery on the left-handed trefoil. $(\\lambda=-1, \\mu=0)$.\n6.  **$[S^3_1(4_1)]$**: From $+1$ surgery on the figure-eight knot. $(\\lambda=-1, \\mu=1)$.\n7.  **$[S^3_{-1}(4_1)]$**: From $-1$ surgery on the figure-eight knot. $(\\lambda=1, \\mu=1)$.\n\nThese 7 elements are all distinct. Therefore, the total number of elements is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
