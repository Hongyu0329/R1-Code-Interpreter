    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **System:** We are working with the surface code, a type of topological quantum error-correcting code.\n    *   **Components:** The system is composed of \"two patches\". This means we have two separate, disconnected regions of the surface code lattice.\n    *   **Features:** We are allowed to create \"two holes\" in total, distributed across these two patches. Holes (also known as defects or punctures) are a standard way to encode multiple logical qubits in a surface code.\n    *   **Objective:** We need to find the *maximum* number of logical qubits that can be encoded in this specific configuration.\n\n2.  **Principle of Encoding in Surface Codes:**\n    *   A single, simple planar patch of surface code (topologically a disk) with specific boundary conditions can encode one logical qubit.\n    *   However, a more general and scalable method for encoding multiple qubits involves creating holes within the surface code lattice.\n    *   In this paradigm, a logical qubit is associated with a pair of boundaries. These can be two separate holes, or one hole and the external boundary of the patch.\n    *   The established relationship for a single planar patch is that the number of logical qubits (`k`) you can encode is equal to the number of holes (`h`) you create in it.\n    *   Formula for a single patch: `k = h`.\n\n3.  **Formulating the Problem:**\n    *   Let the two patches be Patch 1 and Patch 2.\n    *   Let `h_1` be the number of holes in Patch 1 and `h_2` be the number of holes in Patch 2.\n    *   The total number of holes is given as 2, so we have the constraint: `h_1 + h_2 = 2`. (Note: `h_1` and `h_2` must be non-negative integers).\n    *   The number of logical qubits in Patch 1 is `k_1 = h_1`.\n    *   The number of logical qubits in Patch 2 is `k_2 = h_2`.\n    *   Since the patches are separate, the total number of logical qubits (`k_total`) is the sum of the logical qubits in each patch: `k_total = k_1 + k_2`.\n\n4.  **Solving for the Number of Logical Qubits:**\n    *   By substituting the expressions for `k_1` and `k_2`, we get: `k_total = h_1 + h_2`.\n    *   Using the constraint `h_1 + h_2 = 2`, we find: `k_total = 2`.\n\n5.  **Verifying the Maximum:**\n    *   The question asks for the *maximum* number of logical qubits. We need to check if the distribution of holes affects the total. There are two possible ways to distribute the two holes:\n        *   **Case A:** Both holes are in one patch. For example, `h_1 = 2` and `h_2 = 0`.\n            *   Qubits in Patch 1: `k_1 = h_1 = 2`.\n            *   Qubits in Patch 2: `k_2 = h_2 = 0`.\n            *   Total Qubits: `k_total = 2 + 0 = 2`.\n        *   **Case B:** One hole is in each patch. So, `h_1 = 1` and `h_2 = 1`.\n            *   Qubits in Patch 1: `k_1 = h_1 = 1`.\n            *   Qubits in Patch 2: `k_2 = h_2 = 1`.\n            *   Total Qubits: `k_total = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Both possible configurations yield the same total of 2 logical qubits. Therefore, the maximum number is 2.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Interpretation of \"Patch\":** It is crucial to understand that in the context of creating qubits with holes, a patch with zero holes is considered to encode zero logical qubits. The baseline `k=1` for a simple planar code relies on special boundary conditions not implied here. The question's focus is on the qubits encoded *with* the holes.\n*   **Encoding Mechanism:** The number of logical qubits scales linearly with the number of holes (`k=h`) for a single planar region. This is because each new hole provides a new boundary that can be paired with existing boundaries to define an additional logical qubit.\n*   **Additivity:** For disconnected components (separate patches), the total capacity for storing logical qubits is the sum of the capacities of the individual components.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the standard model of encoding logical qubits using holes in a surface code, we have two patches and two holes. The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the holes in each patch (`k_total = h_1 + h_2`). Since the total number of holes is fixed at 2, the total number of logical qubits is also 2, regardless of how the holes are distributed between the two patches.\n\n<<<2>>>"
