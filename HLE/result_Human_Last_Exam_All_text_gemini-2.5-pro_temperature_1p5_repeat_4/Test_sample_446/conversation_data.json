    "*   **Step 1: Identify the core recognition motif.**\n    The question asks about peptides binding to integrin receptors. The most famous and widely studied recognition motif for a large family of integrins is the tripeptide sequence RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic Acid). All five answer choices contain this core RGD motif.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the importance of flanking residues.**\n    While the RGD sequence is essential, it is not sufficient for high-affinity and specific binding on its own. The amino acids surrounding the RGD motif play a critical role. They contribute to the overall three-dimensional structure (conformation) of the peptide, presenting the RGD loop in a way that is optimal for docking into the binding pocket of a specific integrin receptor. Different flanking sequences lead to binding to different types of integrins or affect the strength (affinity) of the binding.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the source of known high-affinity RGD sequences.**\n    The RGD motif was first identified in fibronectin, a major protein of the extracellular matrix that mediates cell adhesion. The specific sequence in the tenth type III domain of human fibronectin that binds to the α5β1 integrin is `...TGRGDSPAS...`. This sequence is a natural, high-affinity ligand. Peptides derived from this natural sequence are often used in laboratory (*in vitro*) assays to study integrin binding.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare the answer choices to the known high-affinity sequence.**\n    Let's examine each peptide in light of the natural fibronectin sequence (`...RGDSP...`):\n    *   A. RGDMAA: The flanking `MAA` sequence does not resemble the fibronectin sequence.\n    *   B. RGDSPSS: The flanking `SPSS` sequence is extremely similar to the natural fibronectin sequence (`SPAS`). The `SP` (Serine-Proline) part immediately following the RGD is known to be particularly important. The proline helps to create a specific type of turn (β-turn) that presents the RGD motif favorably for binding to integrins like α5β1 and αvβ3. Peptides containing `RGDSP` are standard tools in cell biology research for this reason.\n    *   C. RGDLTTP: The flanking `LTTP` sequence is not characteristic of the fibronectin binding site.\n    *   D. RGDQVSK: The flanking `QVSK` sequence is not characteristic of the fibronectin binding site.\n    *   E. RGDARGG: The flanking `ARGG` sequence is not characteristic of the fibronectin binding site.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude based on the evidence.**\n    The peptide `RGDSPSS` is the only option that contains the `RGDSP` motif, which closely mimics the natural high-affinity binding site for integrins found in fibronectin. Due to this similarity, it is highly likely to bind strongly to an integrin receptor in an *in vitro* assay. The other peptides lack the key flanking residues known to promote high-affinity binding.\n\n<<<B>>>"
