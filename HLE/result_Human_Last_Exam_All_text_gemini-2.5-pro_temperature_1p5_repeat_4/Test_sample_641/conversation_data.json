    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We want to find the number of involutions in the group `G = PSU(4, 997)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group structure**\n\nThe Projective Special Unitary group `PSU(n, q)` is defined as the quotient group:\n`PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`\nwhere `SU(n, q)` is the Special Unitary Group and `Z(SU(n, q))` is its center.\n\nIn our case, `n = 4` and `q = 997`.\n\nThe center `Z(SU(n, q))` consists of scalar matrices `cI` where `c` is in the field `F_{q^2}` and satisfies `c^n = 1` and `c^{q+1} = 1`. The order of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\nFor our group `PSU(4, 997)`:\n*   `n = 4`\n*   `q = 997`\n*   `d = gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998)`\n*   `998 = 2 * 499`. `499` is a prime number.\n*   `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nSo, the center `Z(SU(4, 997))` has order 2. It consists of the identity matrix `I` and `-I`. We denote it `Z = {I, -I}`.\n\n**Step 2: Relate involutions in PSU to elements in SU**\n\nAn element `gZ` in `PSU(4, 997)` is an involution if `(gZ)^2` is the identity coset `Z`, and `gZ` is not the identity coset `Z`.\n*   `(gZ)^2 = g^2Z = Z` implies `g^2 \\in Z`. So, `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n*   `gZ \\neq Z` implies `g \\notin Z`. So, `g \\neq I` and `g \\neq -I`.\n\nLet `P` be the set of these elements in `SU(4, 997)`:\n`P = {g \\in SU(4, 997) | (g^2 = I \\text{ or } g^2 = -I) \\text{ and } g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}}`\n\nThe number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is the number of cosets `gZ` for `g \\in P`. Since `g \\notin Z`, the coset `gZ = {g, -g}` has two distinct elements. Therefore, the number of involutions is `|P| / 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the condition `g^2 = -I`**\n\nLet's determine the number of elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = -I`.\n1.  Any such element `g` is in the larger group `U(4, 997)`.\n2.  In `U(n, q)`, an element `g` is diagonalizable (semisimple) over `F_{q^2}`, and its eigenvalues `\\lambda` must satisfy `\\lambda^{q+1} = 1`.\n3.  If `g^2 = -I`, then the eigenvalues of `g` must satisfy `\\lambda^2 = -1`.\n4.  We must find if there exists `\\lambda \\in F_{997^2}` satisfying both `\\lambda^2 = -1` and `\\lambda^{998} = 1`.\n5.  From `\\lambda^2 = -1`, we can raise it to the power `(q+1)/2 = 998/2 = 499`. This gives:\n    `(\\lambda^2)^{499} = (-1)^{499}`\n    `\\lambda^{998} = -1`\n6.  This leads to the contradiction `1 = -1`. This is impossible as the field characteristic is 997 (an odd prime).\n7.  A more rigorous argument involving the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition confirms this result for all elements, not just semisimple ones.\nTherefore, there are no elements `g` in `SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 = -I`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the condition `g^2 = I`**\n\nWe are now looking for the number of elements `g` such that `g^2 = I` and `g \\notin \\{I, -I}`. This is precisely the set of non-central involutions in `SU(4, 997)`.\n\nThe conjugacy classes of involutions in `SU(n, q)` are determined by the dimension `k` of the `-1`-eigenspace. For an involution to be in `SU(n, q)`, its determinant must be 1, which means `(-1)^k = 1`, so `k` must be even.\nFor `n=4`, the possible non-zero values for `k` are 2 and 4.\n*   `k=4`: This corresponds to the involution `t_4 = -I`. This is a central element, so we exclude it based on the condition `g \\notin Z`.\n*   `k=2`: This corresponds to involutions `t_2` which are conjugate to `diag(-1, -1, 1, 1)`. These are the non-central involutions.\n\nThe set of all non-central involutions forms a single conjugacy class `C_2` in `SU(4, 997)`. The size of this class is given by the formula:\n`|C_2| = |SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU(4, q)}(t_2)|`\nThis simplifies to `|C_2| = q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final number**\n\nThe set of preimages is `P = C_2`. The number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` is `|P|/2 = |C_2|/2`.\nNumber of involutions = `(q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)) / 2`.\n\nSubstituting `q = 997`:\n*   `q^2 = 997^2 = 994009`\n*   `q^2 - q + 1 = 994009 - 997 + 1 = 993013`\n*   `q^2 + 1 = 994009 + 1 = 994010`\n\nNumber of involutions = `(997^4 * 993013 * 994010) / 2`\n= `997^4 * 993013 * 497005`\n\nThis is a very large integer. The formula provides the most concise answer.\n\nFinal Answer is `(q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1))/2`, with `q=997`.\n\n<<<`997^4 * (997^2 - 997 + 1) * (997^2 + 1) / 2`>>>"
