    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the Python code that outlines the derivation and provides the final equations for equilibrium entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta, framed within the concepts of large deviation theory.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will start from the statistical definition of entropy for a system of bosons (like photons).\n2.  I will explain that finding the equilibrium state corresponds to finding the most probable macroscopic configuration, a principle derived from large deviation theorems like Boltzmann-Sanov. This is achieved by maximizing the entropy under the constraint of a fixed average energy.\n3.  I will use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the particle distribution that maximizes this entropy.\n4.  This maximization process is mathematically equivalent to the Legendre-Fenchel transform used in the Cramer-Chernoff theorem, which relates the entropy (as a rate function) to the partition function.\n5.  Finally, I will substitute the resulting equilibrium distribution back into the formulas for energy and entropy to present the final equations.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_statistical_mechanics():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and prints the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for a\n    photon gas using principles of statistical mechanics and large deviation theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Use a raw string for the explanation to handle backslashes and special chars.\n    explanation = r\"\"\"\nDerivation of Equilibrium Entropy and Mean Energy for a Photon Gas\n=====================================================================\nThis script derives the equilibrium properties of a gas of light quanta (photons)\nusing principles from statistical mechanics. These principles, such as maximizing\nentropy, are deeply connected to large deviation theorems.\n\n*   The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem states that the probability of observing an empirical\n    distribution is exponentially related to its \"distance\" (KL divergence) from the\n    true distribution. Maximizing entropy is equivalent to finding the most probable\n    macrostate, which minimizes this divergence.\n\n*   The Cramer-Chernoff theorem relates probabilities of large deviations of a sum\n    of random variables to a rate function. In physics, entropy acts as this rate\n    function for energy, and it's related to the partition function via a\n    Legendre transform.\n\nOur plan follows these ideas:\n1. Define the entropy (S) for a system of bosons (photons).\n2. Maximize S with a fixed mean energy (E) to find the most probable, i.e.,\n   equilibrium, distribution of photons across energy levels.\n3. Use this equilibrium distribution to state the final equations for mean energy\n   and entropy.\n\n---------------------------------\nStep 1: Entropy of a Bose Gas\n---------------------------------\nLet's define our terms:\n - epsilon_i : The energy of the i-th energy level.\n - g_i       : The number of states (degeneracy) at energy level epsilon_i.\n - N_i       : The number of photons occupying the energy level epsilon_i.\n - k_B       : The Boltzmann constant.\n - beta      : The inverse temperature, beta = 1 / (k_B * T).\n\nThe statistical entropy (S) for bosons, after applying Stirling's approximation, is:\nS / k_B = sum_i [ (N_i + g_i)*ln(N_i + g_i) - N_i*ln(N_i) - g_i*ln(g_i) ]\n\n-------------------------------------------\nStep 2: Maximizing Entropy (Finding Equilibrium)\n-------------------------------------------\nWe maximize S under the constraint of a fixed total energy E = sum_i (N_i * epsilon_i).\nSince photons can be created and destroyed, their total number is not conserved (which\nis equivalent to setting their chemical potential to zero).\n\nUsing the method of Lagrange multipliers, we maximize L = S/k_B - beta * (sum_i(N_i*epsilon_i) - E).\nSetting the derivative dL/dN_i = 0 gives:\nd(S/k_B)/dN_i = beta * epsilon_i\nln( (N_i + g_i) / N_i ) = beta * epsilon_i\n\nSolving for N_i gives the equilibrium occupation number, denoted as <N_i>:\n<N_i> = g_i / (exp(beta * epsilon_i) - 1)\n\nThis is the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons.\n\n------------------------------------------\nStep 3: Equilibrium Mean Energy and Entropy\n------------------------------------------\nNow we substitute the equilibrium distribution <N_i> back into the formulas for\nthe total energy and entropy to get their equilibrium values.\n\n*** EQUILIBRIUM MEAN ENERGY (U) ***\nThe mean energy U is the sum of energies of all photons at equilibrium.\n\nFinal Equation:\nU = sum_over_i [ (g_i * epsilon_i) / (exp(beta * epsilon_i) - 1) ]\n\nwhere:\n  U           = Equilibrium Mean Energy\n  sum_over_i  = Sum over all energy levels i\n  g_i         = Degeneracy of energy level i\n  epsilon_i   = Energy of level i\n  beta        = 1 / (k_B * T)\n  exp()       = The exponential function\n\n*** EQUILIBRIUM ENTROPY (S) ***\nThe entropy is found by substituting <N_i> back into the entropy formula or by using\nthe thermodynamic relation S = (U + P*V)/T = U/T + k_B * ln(Z), where Z is the partition\nfunction. Both methods yield the same result.\n\nFinal Equation:\nS / k_B = sum_over_i [ (g_i * beta * epsilon_i) / (exp(beta * epsilon_i) - 1) - g_i * ln(1 - exp(-beta * epsilon_i)) ]\n\nwhere:\n  S           = Equilibrium Entropy\n  k_B         = Boltzmann constant\n  ln()        = The natural logarithm\n  All other symbols are as defined above.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_statistical_mechanics()\n\n# Final Answer Check.
