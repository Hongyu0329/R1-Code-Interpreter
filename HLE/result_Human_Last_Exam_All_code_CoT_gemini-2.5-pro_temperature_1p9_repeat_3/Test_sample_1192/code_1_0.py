The most significant life-threatening risk following heart valve surgery is a thromboembolic event, such as a stroke, caused by a blood clot forming on the new valve. Even though the patient is currently stable and asymptomatic, this underlying risk must be proactively managed.

Standard medical practice requires prophylactic (preventative) treatment to mitigate this risk. The most direct and effective method is the prescription of anticoagulant medication.

While other measures like physical therapy, dietary advice, and follow-up appointments are essential for long-term recovery, they do not address the immediate and severe danger of thrombosis. Therefore, prescribing anticoagulants is the most critical next step to prevent adverse post-operative complications.
