    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine if free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC):\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Physical Requirement for SPDC**: SPDC is a nonlinear optical process. We must first identify the key material property that enables it. This property is the second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\n2.  **Determine the Symmetry Condition**: There is a fundamental rule in physics that links a material's crystal structure to its optical properties. We need to state the symmetry condition required for a material to have a non-zero χ⁽²⁾. This condition is the lack of inversion symmetry (the material must be non-centrosymmetric).\n3.  **Analyze the Crystal Structure of Boron Nanosheets**: We will look at the known crystal structures of common, stable, free-standing boron nanosheet phases (also known as borophene). We need to determine if these structures are centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric.\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: Based on whether boron nanosheets meet the symmetry requirement, we can conclude if they are expected to exhibit SPDC.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: A Python script will be created to print out this chain of reasoning and present the final answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_spdc_in_borophene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains whether free-standing boron nanosheets\n    are expected to exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the physical principle behind SPDC.\n    principle = \"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process. The efficiency of this process is governed by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, χ⁽²⁾.\"\n\n    # Step 2: State the symmetry requirement for a non-zero χ⁽²⁾.\n    symmetry_rule = \"A fundamental requirement for a material to possess a non-zero χ⁽²⁾ is that its crystal structure must lack a center of inversion. Materials with a center of inversion (centrosymmetric materials) have χ⁽²⁾ = 0 by symmetry.\"\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the crystal structure of free-standing boron nanosheets.\n    borophene_analysis = \"The most commonly studied and stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene), such as the β12 and χ3 phases, are known to be centrosymmetric. Their crystal lattices possess a center of inversion.\"\n\n    # Step 4: Formulate the conclusion based on the analysis.\n    conclusion = \"Since the intrinsic structure of these common boron nanosheets is centrosymmetric, their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero. Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\"\n\n    # Print the step-by-step reasoning\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis:\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"1.
