    "My plan is to address the user's question by first clarifying the name of the individual in question. The user asks about \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan,\" but the former Nigerian President's name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name.\n\nTherefore, the premise of the question is incorrect. He has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe.\"\n\nI will write a Python script to print a clear statement explaining this fact.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_and_provide_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks the premise of the user's question and provides a factual clarification.\n    \"\"\"\n    full_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    name_in_question = \"Azikiwe\"\n    \n    # The user's question contains a name that is not part of the public figure's actual name.\n    # Therefore, we print an explanation.\n    \n    explanation = (\n        f\"The premise of the question is based on incorrect information. \"\n        f\"The former Nigerian President's full name is {full_name}.\\n\"\n        f\"The name '{name_in_question}' is not part of his name.\\n\"\n        f\"Therefore, there is no record or year of him publicly identifying himself as '{name_in_question}'.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(explanation)\n\ncheck_name_and_provide_info()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as 'Azikiwe', as this is not part of his name.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
