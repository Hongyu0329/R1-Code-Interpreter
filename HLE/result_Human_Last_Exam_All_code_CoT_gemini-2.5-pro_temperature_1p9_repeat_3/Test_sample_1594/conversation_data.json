    "To determine the letter formed by the buildings of Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa, one must consult an aerial or satellite view of the location.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the geographical location of the two high schools in Pisa, which are situated next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce.\n2.  Examine the satellite imagery of this location using a map service.\n3.  Observe the combined shape, or footprint, of the school buildings. The main long building, which acts as a spine, and the several wings that extend perpendicularly from it, form a clear shape.\n4.  This shape corresponds to a specific letter of the alphabet.\n5.  I will provide a Python script that prints this letter as the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The buildings of the \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\" and \"Istituto Ulisse Dini\"\n# high schools in Pisa are adjacent to one another.\n# When viewed from a satellite or aerial perspective, their combined\n# architectural layout forms a distinct shape.\n\n# This script will print the letter that their buildings form.\nthe_letter = 'E'\n\nprint(f\"The letter formed by the combined buildings of the two high schools is: {the_letter}\")\n```\n<<<E>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In Pisa there are multiple highschools.
