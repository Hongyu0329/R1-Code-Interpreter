    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the relationship between the number of loops, vertices, and lines in a Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory. The most common and simplest such theory is the $\\phi^4$ theory, where each interaction vertex connects four lines.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Establish the topological rules.** We will use two fundamental formulas for Feynman diagrams:\n    *   The formula for the number of loops (L) in a connected diagram: `L = I - V + 1`, where `I` is the number of internal lines (propagators) and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   The relationship based on line counting for a $\\phi^4$ theory (where each vertex has 4 lines): `4 * V = 2 * I + E`, where `E` is the number of external lines (representing initial/final state particles).\n\n2.  **Solve for the number of vertices (V).** We are given that the number of loops is two (`L=2`). We can use the two formulas above to derive an equation for `V` that depends only on the known value of `L` and the variable `E`.\n\n3.  **Find the minimum.** The number of external lines `E` must be a non-negative integer. To find the minimum number of vertices `V`, we will find the minimum possible value for `E`. In a $\\phi^4$ theory, `E` must be an even number. The smallest possible value is `E=0`, which corresponds to a vacuum bubble diagram (a process with no external particles).\n\n4.  **Calculate the result.** By substituting `L=2` and the minimum value for `E` into our derived equation, we will find the minimum number of vertices `V`.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan and prints the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_min_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in an interacting scalar field theory (phi^4).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Parameters for the problem\n    num_loops = 2           # L, given as \"two-loop\"\n    lines_per_vertex = 4    # n, for a standard phi^4 interaction\n\n    print(\"To find the minimum number of vertices (V), we use two standard relations for connected Feynman diagrams:\")\n    print(\"1.
