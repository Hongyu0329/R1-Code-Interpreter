    "To solve this, we first need to convert the cuneiform numerals into modern numbers.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Numerals:** The script used is Babylonian cuneiform, which uses a base-60 system. The symbols are combined to form numbers.\n    *   `𒁹` represents 1.\n    *   `𒌋` represents 10.\n2.  **Decode Each Number:**\n    *   `പ്പെ`: This character combines two `𒌋` symbols (2 x 10) and four `𒁹` symbols (4 x 1), so it represents `20 + 4 = 24`.\n    *   `𒌋𒌋𒌋`: This is three `𒌋` symbols, so it represents `10 + 10 + 10 = 30`.\n    *   `𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹`: This combines two `𒌋` symbols (2 x 10) and three `𒁹` symbols (3 x 1), so it represents `20 + 3 = 23`.\n3.  **Form the Equation:** The equation translates to `24 / 30 - 23`.\n4.  **Solve the Equation:**\n    *   `24 / 30 = 0.8`\n    *   `0.8 - 23 = -22.2`\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\n# Assign the modern numbers to variables\nnum1 = 24\nnum2 = 30\nnum3 = 23\n\n# Perform the calculation\nresult = (num1 / num2) - num3\n\n# Print the full equation with the solution\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-22.2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
