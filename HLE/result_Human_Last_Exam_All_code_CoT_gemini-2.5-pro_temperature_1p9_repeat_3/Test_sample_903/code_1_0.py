    # Step 1: Analyze the ligand to find its donor atoms.
    # The ligand is 1,3-Di[3-(2â€™-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-ylmethyl]-2,4,6-triethylbenzene.
    # It has two arms ("Di[...]").
    # Each arm contains one pyridine ring and one pyrazole ring.
    # The pyridine nitrogen is a donor.
    # The pyrazole ring has two nitrogens; one has a lone pair available for coordination.
    # Thus, each arm provides two Nitrogen (N) donor atoms.
    num_arms = 2
    n_donors_per_arm = 2
    total_n_donors = num_arms * n_donors_per_arm  # The ligand is tetradentate (N4).

    # Step 2: Analyze the metal salt.
    # The salt is ZnBr2.
    # It provides the Zn(II) metal center and two Bromide (Br-) ions.
    num_br_ligands = 2

    # Step 3: Predict the final complex.
    # The N4 ligand will bind to the Zn(II) center, occupying 4 coordination sites.
    # Zn(II) commonly has a coordination number of 4, 5, or 6.
    # The two Br- ions are available and are good ligands. They will likely bind to the Zn(II) center as well.
    # This results in a stable, neutral, 6-coordinate complex.
    # Coordinated N atoms = 4
    # Coordinated Br atoms = 2
    # The solvent, methanol (containing O), is a weak ligand and is unlikely to coordinate
    # when stronger ligands like Br- are available.

    # Step 4: Output the number of each coordinated atom.
    # The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted
    # as listing the counts of each type of atom bonded to the Zinc center.
