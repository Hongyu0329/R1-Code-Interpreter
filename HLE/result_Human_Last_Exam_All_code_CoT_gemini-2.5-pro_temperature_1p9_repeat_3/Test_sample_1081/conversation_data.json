    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step thinking process that leads to the solution.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the question:** The user is asking for the total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n2.  **Recall the relevant mathematical theorem:** A key result in the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields, established by Steinberg, states that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in such a group $G$ is exactly the order of its Weyl group, $|W|$. This number is, remarkably, independent of the field size $q$.\n3.  **Identify the specific Weyl group:** For a group of type $E_8$, the relevant Weyl group is $W(E_8)$.\n4.  **Find the order of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$:** The order of the Weyl group for any given simple Lie type is a well-known combinatorial constant. For $E_8$, the order is a very large integer. I will use its known prime factorization to calculate it. The prime factorization of $|W(E_8)|$ is:\n    $|W(E_8)| = 2^{14} \\cdot 3^5 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$\n5.  **Develop the code:** I will write a Python script to compute this value from its prime factors. As requested, the script will print the full equation, including the values of each term, to show how the final result is obtained.\n\nNow, I will proceed with generating the Python code based on this plan.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_e8_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori\n    of a reductive group of type E_8 over a finite field F_q.\n\n    The number of such tori is equal to the order of the Weyl group W(E_8).\n    This function computes |W(E_8)| from its prime factorization.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The prime factorization of the order of the Weyl group of type E_8\n    # is |W(E_8)| = 2^14 * 3^5 * 5^2 * 7^1.\n    factors = {\n        2: 14,\n        3: 5,\n        5: 2,\n        7: 1\n    }\n\n    # Calculate each term in the product\n    term_values = {base: base**exp for base, exp in factors.items()}\n    \n    # Calculate the total order\n    total_order = 1\n    for val in term_values.values():\n        total_order *= val\n\n    # Print the explanation and the step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a group of type E_8 is given by the order of its Weyl group, |W(E_8)|.\")\n    print(\"The order is calculated from its known prime factorization.\\n\")\n    \n    equation_str = \" * \".join([f\"{base}^{exp}\" for base, exp in factors.items()])\n    print(f\"|W(E_8)| = {equation_str}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Calculating each term:\")\n    value_str_list = []\n    for base, exp in factors.items():\n        value = term_values[base]\n        print(f\"{base}^{exp} = {value}\")\n        value_str_list.append(str(value))\n    \n    print(\"\\nPutting it all together:\")\n    final_equation_str = \" * \".join(value_str_list)\n    print(f\"|W(E_8)| = {final_equation_str} = {total_order}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result\ncalculate_e8_tori_count()\n```\n<<<696729600>>>"
