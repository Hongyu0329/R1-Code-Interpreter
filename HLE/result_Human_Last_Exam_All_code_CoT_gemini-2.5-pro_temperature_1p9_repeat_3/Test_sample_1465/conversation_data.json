    "Determining the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein from its sequence is a classic problem in bioinformatics. The key lies in the \"heptad repeat,\" a recurring seven-amino-acid pattern labeled `abcdefg`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions form the hydrophobic core where the helices pack together. The specific combination of amino acids at these core positions dictates whether the helices will favorably form a dimer (2 chains), trimer (3 chains), tetramer (4 chains), or other oligomer.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this:\n1.  **Heptad Phasing:** For each protein sequence, we must first identify the correct 'a' through 'g' positions. Since the sequences are designed to be coiled-coils, one of the seven possible \"phasings\" (or \"frames\") will be chemically favorable. The best frame is the one that places the most hydrophobic residues (like I, L, A, W, V) at the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\n2.  **Core Residue Analysis:** Once the correct frame is identified for a sequence, we extract all the amino acids at the 'a' positions and all those at the 'd' positions.\n3.  **Oligomeric State Prediction:** We will apply a set of established rules based on the types of amino acids found in the core:\n    *   **Dimer (2):** The presence of a polar residue like Asparagine (N) in the core is a very strong indicator of a dimer, as it can form a stabilizing hydrogen bond across the interface that doesn't fit in a trimer or tetramer.\n    *   **Trimer (3):** Cores containing Glutamine (Q) or patterns like Alanine (A) at 'a' and Leucine (L) or Isoleucine (I) at 'd' are often indicative of trimers.\n    *   **Tetramer (4):** A combination of a small residue like Alanine (A) at 'a' and a beta-branched residue like Threonine (T) at 'd' is a known motif for promoting tetramers.\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to automate this process for all five sequences. The script will first find the optimal heptad phasing for each sequence and then apply the prediction rules to determine its oligomeric state.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil sequences based on their\n    hydrophobic core composition.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequences = [\n        \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\",\n        \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\",\n        \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\",\n        \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\",\n        \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\",\n    ]\n\n    # Simplified hydrophobicity scale for phasing\n    # (higher value = more hydrophobic)\n    hydrophobicity = collections.defaultdict(int, {\n        'I': 3, 'L': 3, 'V': 3, 'W': 3, 'F': 3,\n        'A': 2, 'M': 2, 'T': 1\n    })\n\n    def find_best_frame(sequence):\n        \"\"\"\n        Finds the best heptad repeat frame by maximizing the hydrophobicity\n        of the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\n        \"\"\"\n        best_frame = None\n        max_score = -1\n\n        for frame_start in range(7):\n            a_pos_residues = []\n            d_pos_residues = []\n            current_score = 0\n\n            for i, residue in enumerate(sequence):\n                pos = (i - frame_start) % 7\n                if pos == 0:  # 'a' position\n                    a_pos_residues.append(residue)\n                    current_score += hydrophobicity[residue]\n                elif pos == 3:  # 'd' position\n                    d_pos_residues.append(residue)\n                    current_score += hydrophobicity[residue]\n\n            if current_score > max_score:\n                max_score = current_score\n                best_frame = (a_pos_residues, d_pos_residues)\n        return best_frame\n\n    def predict_oligomer(a_res, d_res):\n        \"\"\"\n        Predicts oligomeric state based on core residue composition rules.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Rule 1: Asparagine (N) at a core position is a strong dimer signal.\n        if 'N' in a_res or 'N' in d_res:\n            return 2\n\n        a_counts = collections.Counter(a_res)\n        d_counts = collections.Counter(d_res)\n\n        # Rule 2: Alanine (A) at 'a' and Threonine (T) at 'd' signals a tetramer.\n        # This handles imperfect repeats by checking if the majority of residues match.\n        if a_counts.get('A', 0) >= len(a_res) * 0.75 and d_counts.get('T', 0) >= len(d_res) * 0.75:\n            return 4\n        \n        # Rule 3: Glutamine (Q) in the core is often found in trimers.\n        if 'Q' in a_res or 'Q' in d_res:\n            return 3\n\n        # Rule 4: Alanine at 'a' with other large hydrophobes (I, L, W) at 'd' is trimeric.\n        # Also Alanine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd' can be a trimer.\n        if a_counts.get('A', 0) >= len(a_res) * 0.75:\n            if d_counts.get('L',0) > 0 or d_counts.get('W',0) > 0 or d_counts.get('I',0) > 0:\n                 return 3\n\n        # Default prediction: Trimer is a common state for coiled-coils.\n        return 3\n\n    results = []\n    for seq in sequences:\n        a_residues, d_residues = find_best_frame(seq)\n        state = predict_oligomer(a_residues, d_residues)\n        results.append(state)\n        \n    # The problem asks to output the final \"equation\" showing each number.\n    # We will format the output string as requested.\n    result_str = \", \".join(map(str, results))\n    print(f\"The predicted oligomeric states for the sequences are:\")\n    print(result_str)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
