    "I will answer your question by providing a Python script. My plan is to first find the answer to the factual question using my knowledge base and then write a simple Python script to print this information as requested.\n\nThe steps are:\n1.  Identify the key entities in the question: \"The Radionist\", \"Kurt Günther\", \"1927\", \"1967\", \"museum\".\n2.  Search my knowledge base for the museum that acquired this specific painting in the specified year.\n3.  The information points to the Lindenau-Museum in Altenburg, Germany.\n4.  Create a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints a clear, complete sentence answering the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_museum():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the acquisition of Kurt Günther's painting.\n    The information is based on art historical records.\n    \"\"\"\n    painting_title = \"The Radionist\"\n    artist = \"Kurt Günther\"\n    year_created = 1927\n    year_acquired = 1967\n    museum = \"Lindenau-Museum Altenburg\"\n\n    print(f\"The museum that acquired the {year_created} tempera painting \\\"{painting_title}\\\" by {artist} in {year_acquired} is:\")\n    print(museum)\n\nfind_museum()\n```\n<<<Lindenau-Museum Altenburg>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which museum acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
