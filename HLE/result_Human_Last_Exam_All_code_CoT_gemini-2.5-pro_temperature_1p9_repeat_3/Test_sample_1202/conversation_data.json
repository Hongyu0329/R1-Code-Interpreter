    "Here is my plan to arrive at the correct answer.\n1.  First, I will analyze the user's request, which is a multiple-choice question about the fate of duplicated genes.\n2.  The goal is to identify the mechanism that explains both the *retention* (keeping both copies) and the *divergence* (the copies becoming different) of these genes.\n3.  I will create a Python script to evaluate each answer choice against these two criteria: \"promotes retention\" and \"promotes divergence\".\n4.  For each option, I will assign a score of 1 if it meets a criterion and 0 if it doesn't.\n5.  The script will then analyze the scores to find the options that satisfy both conditions.\n6.  Finally, based on the analysis and established evolutionary models, the script will explain why one of the correct options is considered \"most likely\" and print the final conclusion. The script will also satisfy the unusual constraint of printing out an \"equation\" for the score.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes mechanisms of gene duplication to answer the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The answer choices provided by the user.\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    # Explanations for each mechanism.\n    explanations = {\n        'A': \"A process that homogenizes gene copies, making them more similar.
