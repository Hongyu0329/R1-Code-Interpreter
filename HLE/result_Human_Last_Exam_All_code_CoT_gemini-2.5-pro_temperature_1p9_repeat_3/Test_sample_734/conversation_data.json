    "My plan is to answer the user's question by identifying the specific theologian and the key concepts they developed.\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The user is asking for a Christian theologian who created a specific vocabulary to discuss changes in the laws of nature. The two key examples given are the virgin birth (a miracle) and the changes to nature after the Fall (a fundamental shift in the world's operation).\n2.  **Identify the theologian:** The theologian who most famously fits this description is Augustine of Hippo.\n3.  **Identify the terminology:** Augustine developed the concept of *rationes seminales*, which can be translated as \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal principles.\"\n4.  **Explain the concept:** Augustine argued that God did not create the world in a static state but embedded these *rationes seminales* within creation from the beginning. These are the latent potentialities for all things that would ever come to be.\n5.  **Apply to the examples:**\n    *   **The Fall:** According to this view, the \"laws of nature\" didn't so much change as the conditions for their operation did. The potentialities for death, toil, and decay, which were latent *rationes seminales* before the Fall, were activated as a consequence of human sin.\n    *   **The Virgin Birth:** This is not seen as a violation of a natural law by God, but rather the activation of a *ratio seminalis* that was always present as a potentiality within creation. God, as the ultimate author, can bring forth these potentialities in ways that are outside the normal, observable course of nature.\n6.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script that prints the name of the theologian who developed this terminology.\n\n```python\ndef solve_theological_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the theologian who developed specialized\n    terminology for changes in natural laws applicable to the virgin birth and the Fall.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    concept = \"rationes seminales (seminal reasons)\"\n\n    print(f\"The theologian who developed specialized terminology for these concepts is: {theologian_name}.\")\n    print(f\"He proposed the concept of '{concept}' to explain how God embedded all future potentialities into creation from the beginning.\")\n    print(\"According to Augustine, miracles like the virgin birth or changes at the Fall were not violations of natural order, but the actualization of these pre-existing, latent principles outside of the usual causal chain.\")\n\nsolve_theological_query()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.

You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which Christian theologian first developed specialized terminology that can describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
