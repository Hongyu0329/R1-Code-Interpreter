    "This is a knowledge-based question about ballet technique. To answer it, I will use a Python script to logically compare the key characteristics of the cambré derrière in both the Vaganova and Balanchine methods. The script will store the defining features of each style in a dictionary and then iterate through them to identify the primary distinction, which will then be mapped to the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef find_ballet_technique_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares the characteristics of a cambré derrière in Vaganova and Balanchine methods\n    to find the primary difference.\n    \"\"\"\n    vaganova_style = {\n        'hip_placement': 'Hips are kept square and stable over the supporting leg.',\n        'backbend': 'Originates from the upper back, maintaining a long spine.',\n        'head_placement': 'Head follows the line of the arm, looking out and slightly up.'\n    }\n\n    balanchine_style = {\n        'hip_placement': 'The hip of the working leg is allowed to lift and open.',\n        'backbend': 'Often more extreme, facilitated by the release of the hip.',\n        'head_placement': 'Often thrown back with more freedom and abandon.'\n    }\n    \n    answer_choices = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the differences between Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière:\\n\")\n    \n    primary_difference_key = None\n    \n    for characteristic in vaganova_style:\n        if vaganova_style[characteristic] != balanchine_style[characteristic]:\n            print(f\"- Characteristic: {characteristic.replace('_', ' ').title()}\")\n            print(f\"  - Vaganova: {vaganova_style[characteristic]}\")\n            print(f\"  - Balanchine: {balanchine_style[characteristic]}\\n\")\n            # The most fundamental, biomechanical difference is the hip placement.\n            if characteristic == 'hip_placement':\n                primary_difference_key = 'B'\n\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"While there are differences in head placement and the resulting degree of the backbend, the most fundamental and defining technical difference is the treatment of the hips.\")\n    print(\"Vaganova insists on maintaining a square pelvis, whereas Balanchine allows the hip to open.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis corresponds to answer choice: {primary_difference_key}. {answer_choices[primary_difference_key]}\")\n\n\nfind_ballet_technique_difference()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
