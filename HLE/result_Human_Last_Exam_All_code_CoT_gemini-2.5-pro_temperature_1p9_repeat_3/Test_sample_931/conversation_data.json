    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) feed on, I will follow these steps:\n1.  Access information on the diet of adult Raphidioptera. My knowledge base indicates they are primarily predators but also consume other food sources.\n2.  Analyze the specific food items listed in the answer choices.\n3.  Evaluate each choice:\n    *   **A. Nectar:** Adult snakeflies are known to supplement their predatory diet with nectar and pollen. This is a plausible food source.\n    *   **B. Māhoe pollen:** While they eat pollen, Māhoe is a tree native to New Zealand, where snakeflies are not naturally found. This makes the specific source unlikely, serving as a distractor.\n    *   **C. Fungus:** This is not a known food source for snakeflies.\n    *   **D. Karamū leaf tissue:** Snakeflies are not herbivorous; they do not eat leaf tissue. Karamū is also a New Zealand native plant.\n    *   **E. Totara Aphids:** Snakeflies are well-documented predators of aphids. Aphids are a primary food source. The specific type of aphid is less important than the general food category.\n4.  Based on this evaluation, both nectar (A) and aphids (E) are correct food sources. Therefore, the combined choice (F) is the most accurate and comprehensive answer.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to present this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_snakefly_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)\n    to determine the correct answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known facts about adult snakefly diet\n    known_foods = {\n        \"predatory\": \"Small, soft-bodied insects like aphids\",\n        \"supplemental\": \"Pollen and nectar\"\n    }\n\n    # Answer choices provided\n    choices = {\n        'A': \"Nectar\",\n        'B': \"Māhoe pollen\",\n        'C': \"Fungus\",\n        'D': \"Karamū leaf tissue\",\n        'E': \"Totara Aphids\",\n        'F': \"A and E\",\n        'G': \"D and E\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Evaluation of each choice\n    print(\"Choice A (Nectar): Correct.
