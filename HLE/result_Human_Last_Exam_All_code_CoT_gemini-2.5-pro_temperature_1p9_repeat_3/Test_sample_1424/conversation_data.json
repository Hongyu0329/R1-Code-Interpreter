    "To determine the functional dependence of the bare Green's function, $G_0$, on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the System**: We start with a non-interacting system, which is described by a simple Hamiltonian, $H_0$. This Hamiltonian is just the sum of the energies of all single-particle states.\n2.  **Use the Equation of Motion**: We will consider the equation of motion for the Green's function. For a non-interacting system, this equation is straightforward.\n3.  **Fourier Transform**: The relationship is clearest in the frequency-momentum domain. By performing a Fourier transform from time to frequency, the differential equation of motion becomes a simple algebraic equation.\n4.  **Solve for the Green's function**: Solving this algebraic equation gives us the explicit formula for the bare Green's function, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, clearly showing its dependence on $\\epsilon_k$.\n5.  **Create Python Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that programmatically constructs and prints this final formula to clearly illustrate the relationship and satisfy the prompt's requirements.\n\nThe resulting relationship shows that $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the particle's energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n```python\ndef display_bare_greens_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function programmatically constructs and prints the formula for the\n    bare Green's function, G_0, to demonstrate its functional dependence on\n    the single-particle energy eigenvalue, epsilon_k.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Define the components of the formula ---\n    \n    # The left side of the equation\n    green_function_symbol = \"G_0(k, omega)\"\n    \n    # The numerator of the fraction.
