    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with $12345$ vertices that is not a complete graph. We can solve this by establishing an upper bound for $\\chi(G)$ and then showing that this bound is achievable.\n\n### My Plan\n1.  **Identify the core graph theory principle:** The problem is about finding the maximum chromatic number ($\\chi(G)$) for a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not the complete graph $K_n$.\n2.  **Establish the upper bound:** I will use a known theorem from graph theory. For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not complete, its chromatic number is at most $n-1$. That is, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$. This can be proven by noting that since $G$ is not complete, there must be at least two vertices, say $u$ and $v$, that are not connected. We can then assign $u$ and $v$ the same color and color the remaining $n-2$ vertices. A more formal proof involves contracting the two non-adjacent vertices. The resulting graph has $n-1$ vertices and can be colored with at most $n-1$ colors. This coloring can be extended back to the original graph $G$.\n3.  **Prove the bound is tight:** To show that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, I need to provide an example of a non-complete graph on $n$ vertices that requires exactly $n-1$ colors. The graph consisting of a clique of size $n-1$ and one isolated vertex ($K_{n-1} \\cup K_1$) serves as a perfect example. The clique part requires $n-1$ colors, making the whole graph require $n-1$ colors.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that formalizes this reasoning. The script will define the number of vertices, state the theorem, describe the example graph, and compute the final answer ($n-1$). The final output will clearly show the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_graph_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph G\n    with 12345 vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n    \n    # The problem concerns the chromatic number, chi(G), of a graph G.\n    # The graph G has n vertices and is not the complete graph K_n.\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the upper bound for the chromatic number.\n    # A standard theorem in graph theory states that any graph G with n vertices\n    # that is not a complete graph can be colored with at most n-1 colors.\n    # Proof idea: Since G is not complete, there exist two non-adjacent vertices.\n    # These two vertices can be identified (or merged), resulting in a graph with n-1 vertices.\n    # A graph with n-1 vertices can be colored with at most n-1 colors.\n    # This coloring can be mapped back to the original graph G, showing chi(G) <= n-1.\n    \n    upper_bound = n - 1\n\n    # Step 2: Show that this upper bound is achievable.\n    # To do this, we need to construct a graph G' on n vertices that is not complete\n    # and has a chromatic number of exactly n-1.\n    \n    # Consider the graph G' formed by the disjoint union of a complete graph on (n-1)\n    # vertices (a clique K_{n-1}) and a single isolated vertex (K_1).\n    # This graph has (n-1) + 1 = n vertices.\n    # It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex.\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the chromatic number of this example graph.\n    # The chromatic number of a disjoint union of graphs is the maximum of the\n    # chromatic numbers of its components.\n    # chi(G') = max(chi(K_{n-1}), chi(K_1))\n    \n    # The chromatic number of a complete graph K_k is k.\n    chi_K_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    \n    # The chromatic number of a graph with one vertex K_1 is 1.\n    chi_K_1 = 1\n    \n    # Calculate chi(G')\n    chi_G_prime = max(chi_K_n_minus_1, chi_K_1)\n    \n    # Since we found a non-complete graph G' on n vertices with chi(G') = n-1,\n    # the maximum possible chromatic number is indeed n-1.\n    \n    max_colors = n - 1\n\n    print(f\"The number of vertices is n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The graph is not complete, so its chromatic number chi(G) is at most n-1.\")\n    print(f\"To show this maximum is achievable, consider the graph K_({n}-1) + K_1.\")\n    print(f\"This graph has a clique of size {n-1}, so it requires at least {n-1} colors.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the maximum number of colors needed is {n} - 1 = {max_colors}.\")\n\nsolve_graph_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
