    Calculates the numerical value of the dimensionless Lindhard polarization function
    at zero frequency and in the limit of zero momentum transfer.

    The full expression for the dimensionless static Lindhard function is:
    χ₀(x) = -[1/2 + (1-x²)/(4*x) * ln|(1+x)/(1-x)|]
    where x = q / (2*k_F).

    We need to evaluate this in the limit x → 0. The analytical result is -1.
