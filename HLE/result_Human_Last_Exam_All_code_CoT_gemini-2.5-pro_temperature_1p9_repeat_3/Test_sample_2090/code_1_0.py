    This function determines and prints the IAU boundary that the Vernal Equinox
    most recently crossed to enter the constellation Pisces.
    
    The logic is based on the fact that due to an intrusion of the constellation Cetus,
    the precessing Vernal Equinox first crossed from Aries into Cetus, and then later
    crossed from Cetus into Pisces. This latter boundary is the one we need.
    
    This boundary is a line of constant Right Ascension in the B1875.0 epoch.
