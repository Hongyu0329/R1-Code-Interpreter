def solve_pauli_channel_rank():
    """
    This function determines and prints the maximal rank of the complementary
    channel of a Pauli channel on a d-dimensional quantum system.

    The derivation is as follows:
    1. The rank of the complementary channel (Lambda^c) is equal to the rank of the
       Gram matrix (G) of the Kraus operators {E_k} of the original channel (Lambda).
       The Gram matrix is defined as G_kl = Tr(E_k^dag * E_l).

    2. For a Pauli channel on a d-dimensional system, there are d^2 Kraus operators,
       one for each generalized Pauli operator P_i. They have the form E_i = sqrt(p_i) * P_i,
       where sum(p_i) = 1 and p_i >= 0.

    3. The generalized Pauli operators {P_i} form an orthogonal basis for the space of
       d x d matrices, with the property Tr(P_i^dag * P_j) = d * delta_ij.

    4. Substituting the Kraus operators into the Gram matrix formula gives:
       G_ij = Tr((sqrt(p_i) * P_i)^dag * (sqrt(p_j) * P_j))
            = sqrt(p_i * p_j) * Tr(P_i^dag * P_j)
            = sqrt(p_i * p_j) * d * delta_ij
       This shows that G is a diagonal d^2 x d^2 matrix. The diagonal entries are G_ii = p_i * d.

    5. The rank of a diagonal matrix is the count of its non-zero diagonal elements.
       The rank of G is the number of probabilities p_i that are strictly greater than zero.

    6. To find the maximal rank, we must choose the channel that has the maximum
       number of non-zero probabilities p_i. We can choose a channel where all d^2
       probabilities are non-zero (e.g., the depolarizing channel).

    7. Therefore, the maximal number of non-zero entries is d^2, and the maximal
       rank of the complementary channel is d^2.
