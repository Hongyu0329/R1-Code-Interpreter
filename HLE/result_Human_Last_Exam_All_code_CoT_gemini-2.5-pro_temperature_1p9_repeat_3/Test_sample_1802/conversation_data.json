    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Define the Pauli Channel**: I will start by defining a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ for a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit). This involves specifying its Kraus operators, which are based on the generalized Pauli operators $P_{ab} = X^a Z^b$ and a set of probabilities $\\{p_{ab}\\}$.\n\n2.  **Use the Gram Matrix Method**: A key theorem in quantum information theory states that the rank of a complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is equal to the rank of the Gram matrix of the Kraus operators of the original channel $\\Lambda$. The Gram matrix $G$ is defined by its elements $G_{ij} = \\text{tr}(E_i^\\dagger E_j)$, where $\\{E_i\\}$ are the Kraus operators.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Gram Matrix**: I will compute the elements of the Gram matrix for the Pauli channel. This calculation will rely on the orthogonality property of the generalized Pauli operators, which states that $\\text{tr}(P_{ab}^\\dagger P_{cd}) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ac}\\delta_{bd}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Gram Matrix Rank**: The result of the calculation will show that the Gram matrix is diagonal. The rank of a diagonal matrix is the number of its non-zero diagonal entries. These entries will depend directly on the probabilities $\\{p_{ab}\\}$ defining the channel.\n\n5.  **Maximize the Rank**: The problem asks for the *maximal* rank. This corresponds to choosing a Pauli channel (i.e., choosing the probabilities $\\{p_{ab}\\}$) that maximizes the number of non-zero diagonal entries in the Gram matrix. This is achieved when all possible Pauli errors have a non-zero probability.\n\n6.  **Provide the Final Code**: Based on this derivation, I will provide a Python script that states the final result. Since the dimension $d$ is not specified, the answer will be a formula in terms of $d$. The code will print this formula, explicitly identifying the components of the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pauli_channel_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the maximal rank of the complementary\n    channel of a Pauli channel on a d-dimensional quantum system.\n\n    The derivation is as follows:\n    1. The rank of the complementary channel (Lambda^c) is equal to the rank of the\n       Gram matrix (G) of the Kraus operators {E_k} of the original channel (Lambda).\n       The Gram matrix is defined as G_kl = Tr(E_k^dag * E_l).\n\n    2. For a Pauli channel on a d-dimensional system, there are d^2 Kraus operators,\n       one for each generalized Pauli operator P_i. They have the form E_i = sqrt(p_i) * P_i,\n       where sum(p_i) = 1 and p_i >= 0.\n\n    3. The generalized Pauli operators {P_i} form an orthogonal basis for the space of\n       d x d matrices, with the property Tr(P_i^dag * P_j) = d * delta_ij.\n\n    4. Substituting the Kraus operators into the Gram matrix formula gives:\n       G_ij = Tr((sqrt(p_i) * P_i)^dag * (sqrt(p_j) * P_j))\n            = sqrt(p_i * p_j) * Tr(P_i^dag * P_j)\n            = sqrt(p_i * p_j) * d * delta_ij\n       This shows that G is a diagonal d^2 x d^2 matrix. The diagonal entries are G_ii = p_i * d.\n\n    5. The rank of a diagonal matrix is the count of its non-zero diagonal elements.\n       The rank of G is the number of probabilities p_i that are strictly greater than zero.\n\n    6. To find the maximal rank, we must choose the channel that has the maximum\n       number of non-zero probabilities p_i. We can choose a channel where all d^2\n       probabilities are non-zero (e.g., the depolarizing channel).\n\n    7. Therefore, the maximal number of non-zero entries is d^2, and the maximal\n       rank of the complementary channel is d^2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The dimension 'd' of the qudit system is a variable.\n    # We express the final answer as a formula in terms of 'd'.\n    \n    # In the formula 'd^2', the base is 'd' and the exponent is 2.\n    base = \"d\"\n    exponent = 2\n\n    print(\"For a Pauli channel acting on a qudit of dimension d:\")\n    print(\"The final equation for the maximal rank of the complementary channel is:\")\n    print(f\"Maximal Rank = {base}^{exponent}\")\n\nsolve_pauli_channel_rank()\n```\n<<<d^2>>>"
