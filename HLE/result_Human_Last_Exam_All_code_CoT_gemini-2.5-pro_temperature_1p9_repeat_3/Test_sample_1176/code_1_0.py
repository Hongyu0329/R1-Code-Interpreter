    # Statement 1: Morrison formation as a foredeep deposit. (D - Debated/Incorrect timing)
    # Statement 2: Metamorphic core complexes from a slab window. (D - Debated, one of many hypotheses)
    # Statement 3: "Nevadaplano" existence by end of Cretaceous. (D - Strong but debated hypothesis)
    # Statement 4: "Arizonaplano" via magmatic thickening. (D - Strong but debated hypothesis)
    # Statement 5: Laramide structures are inboard of Sevier structures. (C - Consensus, fundamental concept)
    # Statement 6: Sierra/Idaho batholiths from Cordilleran arc. (C - Consensus, textbook geology)
    # Statement 7: Eocene ignimbrite propagation to the southwest. (D - Factually incorrect direction)
    # Statement 8: Colorado Plateau uplift history. (D - Classic, long-standing debate)
    # Statement 9: Cascades arc elevation history. (D - Incorrect timing for "modern elevation")
    # Statement 10: Laramide deformation caused by Shatsky conjugate. (D - A specific, debated mechanism)
