    This function determines the parameter groups associated with violin playing variations.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  'sul ponticello': Playing near the bridge excites more high harmonics. The parameter 'nu' (Group ii) controls the strength of high harmonics.
    2.  'bridge mute': A mute adds mass to the bridge, damping and lowering the frequency of body resonances, especially the higher ones responsible for brilliance (Group iv). Adding mass lowers a resonant frequency, so f2 goes 'down'.
    3.  'helium room': The speed of sound in helium drastically changes the instrument's air resonances. The principal air resonance corresponds to the lowest body resonance, f1 (Group iii).
    4.  'on the E string': Playing on a different string changes the open string's fundamental frequency, F (Group i).
    
    The final answer is a concatenation of these findings.
