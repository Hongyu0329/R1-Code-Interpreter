    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The task is to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 chessboard that wraps around both horizontally and vertically (a torus).\n\n2.  **Define \"Non-Attacking\" on a Toroidal Board:**\n    *   **Standard Attacks:** No two queens can share the same row or column.\n    *   **Toroidal Diagonal Attacks:** The diagonals also wrap around the edges of the board. For two queens at positions `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` on an `n x n` board, they are on a wrapping diagonal if `(r1 - c1) % n == (r2 - c2) % n` or `(r1 + c1) % n == (r2 + c2) % n`. For our 5x5 board, `n=5`.\n\n3.  **Choose an Algorithm:** The problem is a combinatorial search problem. A brute-force check of all possible placements of 4 queens (`C(25, 4) = 12,650`) is possible, but a more systematic and efficient approach is backtracking. Backtracking will build solutions one queen at a time and abandon a path as soon as a conflict is found, pruning the search space.\n\n4.  **Develop the Backtracking Strategy:**\n    *   We can represent the board as a grid and each square by a linear index from 0 to 24.\n    *   We will write a recursive function, let's call it `backtrack(k, start_index, placements)`, that tries to place the `k`-th queen.\n    *   `k`: The number of queens already placed. The recursion starts with `k=0` and ends when `k=4`.\n    *   `start_index`: To avoid counting the same placement multiple times (e.g., placing queens on squares {A, B} is the same as {B, A}), we will only search for new positions starting from the index after the previously placed queen.\n    *   `placements`: A list of coordinates `(r, c)` of the queens placed so far.\n    *   **Base Case:** When `k` reaches 4, we have successfully placed 4 non-attacking queens. We increment a counter for a valid solution.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** The function will loop through the available squares. For each square, it checks if placing a queen there would conflict with any of the queens already in `placements` using the toroidal attack rules. If it's a safe square, it places the queen and calls itself recursively to place the next queen. After the recursive call returns, it \"un-places\" the queen (this is the backtracking step) to explore other possibilities.\n\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that implements this backtracking algorithm. It will set up the board size (`n=5`) and the number of queens (`num_queens=4`), run the search, and print the final count of valid arrangements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens\n    on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Board dimensions and number of queens\n    N = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n    \n    # Using a list to hold the count, so it's mutable across recursive calls\n    solution_count = [0]\n\n    def is_safe(r, c, queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if placing a queen at (r, c) is safe with respect to the\n        list of queens already placed on the toroidal board.\n        \"\"\"\n        for qr, qc in queens:\n            # Check for same row or column (standard attack)\n            if r == qr or c == qc:\n                return False\n            # Check for toroidal diagonals\n            if (r - c) % N == (qr - qc) % N:\n                return False\n            if (r + c) % N == (qr + qc) % N:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def find_placements(k, start_idx, queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively finds valid placements using backtracking.\n        k: number of queens currently placed.\n        start_idx: linear board index to start searching from (avoids duplicates).\n        queens: a list of (row, col) tuples for placed queens.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: if all queens are placed, we found a solution.\n        if k == NUM_QUEENS:\n            solution_count[0] += 1\n            return\n\n        # Iterate through all possible squares from the start index.\n        # The board is treated as a 1D array of size N*N.\n        for i in range(start_idx, N * N):\n            r = i // N\n            c = i % N\n\n            # Check if placing a queen at (r, c) is safe.\n            if is_safe(r, c, queens):\n                # If safe, add the queen to the list of placements.\n                queens.append((r, c))\n                # Recurse to place the next queen.\n                # Start the search for the next queen from the next index (i + 1).\n                find_placements(k + 1, i + 1, queens)\n                # Backtrack: remove the queen to explore other configurations.\n                queens.pop()\n\n    # Initial call to start the backtracking process.\n    # Start with 0 queens placed, from index 0, with an empty list of queens.\n    find_placements(0, 0, [])\n\n    # The problem asks for the total number of ways.\n    # The variable solution_count[0] holds this number.\n    print(solution_count[0])\n\nsolve_toroidal_queens()\n<<<200>>>\n```"
