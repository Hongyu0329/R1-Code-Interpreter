Thinking Process:
1. The poem begins with "Naked, cold," which immediately establishes a theme of low temperature and exposure.
2. The core of the poem describes a creative act: "She knits a veil from starwort, grass and meadowsweet." This creator, "she," makes something delicate on top of plants.
3. The description "Sheâ€™s lace and glass" is a powerful clue. "Lace" refers to an intricate, web-like pattern. "Glass" suggests something crystalline, transparent, and fragile. This combination strongly points to frost.
4. The poem describes the creation as temporary, waiting for "pelted Autumn and his echoed roar to fray each feather stitch." This means the harsh weather of Autumn (wind, rain, or sun) will destroy the delicate structure. This is true of frost, which melts or is blown away.
5. The final image, "to slip into a star-mirrored bewitchment," beautifully describes the process of melting into shimmering droplets of water that reflect the sky.
6. Comparing this to the options, "The intricate, lace-like patterns of frost during Autumn" (A) aligns perfectly with every piece of imagery in the poem. A spider's web (C) is a plausible alternative, but the direct description as "cold" and "glass" makes frost a much stronger fit.
