    # Choice A: Aboriginal masks
    print("Choice A: Aboriginal masks")
    print("Analysis: William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' opens with the discovery of a Pazuzu statue, which is Mesopotamian, not Aboriginal. This motif is not prominent in Fritz Lang's work. Therefore, A is incorrect.")

    # Choice B: Magic wands
    print("Choice B: Magic wands")
    print("Analysis: Neither director's filmography is characterized by the use of magic wands. Their themes are generally darker, focusing on crime, fate, or psychological horror rather than fantasy. Therefore, B is incorrect.")

    # Choice C: The first ever cyborgs on screen
    print("Choice C: The first ever cyborgs on screen")
    print("Analysis: Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' (1927) features the iconic 'Maschinenmensch', a pioneering cinematic robot/cyborg. However, cyborgs are not a feature in William Friedkin's films. To be a 'common' element, it must appear in the works of both. Therefore, C is incorrect.")

    # Choice D: Bugs
    print("Choice D: Bugs")
    print("Analysis: Bugs are a distinct motif for William Friedkin, who directed the film 'Bug' (2006) and featured locusts prominently in 'The Exorcist' (1973). However, bug imagery is not a known or significant recurring element in Fritz Lang's major works. Therefore, D is incorrect.")
