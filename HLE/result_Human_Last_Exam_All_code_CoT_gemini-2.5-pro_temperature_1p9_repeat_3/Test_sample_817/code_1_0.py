    # Choice A: It is an interactor of the actin assembly factor ADF3.
    # Reasoning: There is no strong evidence in major studies for a direct interaction
    # between HR4/RPW8.2 and ADF3. This is likely false.
    print("Choice A analysis:")
    print(" - The statement claims HR4 interacts with the actin factor ADF3.")
    print(" - Evaluation: This is not a well-documented interaction. So, A is likely false.")
    print("-"*70)

    # Choice B: It contributes to the defense against the broad spectrum of powdery mildew pathogens.
    # Reasoning: This is a known function. The RPW8 locus (containing HR4/RPW8.2) is famous
    # for conferring broad-spectrum resistance to different isolates of powdery mildew. This is a true statement.
    print("Choice B analysis:")
    print(" - The statement claims HR4 contributes to broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance.")
    print(" - Evaluation: This is correct. The RPW8 locus is known for this function. So, B is a true statement.")
    print("-"*70)

    # Choice C: It is targeted to the Extrahaustorial membrane during infection by the powdery mildew pathogen.
    # Reasoning: This is the specific cellular mechanism of HR4/RPW8.2. Key research has shown that
    # the protein is specifically localized to the extrahaustorial membrane (EHM), the interface
    # between the plant cell and the pathogen's feeding structure, to enact defense. This is also a true statement.
    print("Choice C analysis:")
    print(" - The statement claims HR4 is targeted to the Extrahaustorial membrane (EHM).")
    print(" - Evaluation: This is correct. It describes the key mechanism of HR4's function at the cellular level. So, C is a true statement.")
    print("-"*70)

    # Choice D: It regulates the defense modulator PAD4 in plant defense against the Psm.
    # Reasoning: The relationship is the other way around. HR4/RPW8.2-mediated resistance
    # is partially dependent on PAD4, meaning PAD4 is required for its function. HR4 does not regulate PAD4. This is false.
    print("Choice D analysis:")
    print(" - The statement claims HR4 regulates PAD4.")
    print(" - Evaluation: This is incorrect. The function of HR4 is dependent on PAD4, not the other way around. So, D is false.")
    print("-"*70)

    # Choice E: HR4 is one of the interactors of the PAD4.
    # Reasoning: While their functions are linked, a direct physical interaction is not
    # the primary reported mechanism. They are functionally related components in a signaling pathway. This is likely false.
    print("Choice E analysis:")
    print(" - The statement claims HR4 is a direct interactor of PAD4.")
    print(" - Evaluation: Though functionally related, they are not typically cited as direct physical interactors. So, E is false.")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Both statements B and C are correct. However, C describes the specific molecular and cellular mechanism (WHERE and HOW HR4 acts),")

    print("The targeting to the EHM (C) is the action that results in broad-spectrum resistance (B).")
