# The problem describes the Stone-Čech compactification of the long ray, X = βR.
# For any Tychonoff space R, its Stone-Čech compactification is unique up to a
# homeomorphism that fixes R.
# Therefore, all spaces X satisfying the given properties are homeomorphic to each other.
# This means they all belong to a single homeomorphism class.

# The number of distinct homeomorphism classes for such X.
number_of_classes = 1

# Print the final answer.
