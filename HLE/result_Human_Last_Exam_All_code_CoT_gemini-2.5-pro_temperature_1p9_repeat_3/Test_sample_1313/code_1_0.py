    Historical sources on the film's restoration, including the provided Le Monde article,
    reveal key differences in the ending. The original 1924 German version contained a
    powerful sequence at the end where Etzel, devastated, lifts his infant son up,
    showing him the carnage of the burning hall. This entire scene was often cut
    from international export versions of the film to shorten the runtime. The 2010
    Murnau Foundation restoration, being the most complete version, re-integrated this
    missing scene. Therefore, a viewer of the common shorter version (like the 2007 DVD)
    would see this moment for the first time in the restored cut.
