    "My plan is to solve this puzzle by connecting the colors mentioned to Isaac Newton's specific mapping of the color spectrum to the musical scale.\n\n1.  **Identify the Colors:** The question specifies a range between two colors.\n    *   The first color is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue,\" which is **Green** (in subtractive color mixing, as with paints).\n    *   The second color is **Blue**.\n    *   Therefore, the query concerns the boundary between Green and Blue.\n\n2.  **Recall Newton's Mapping:** Isaac Newton associated the seven colors of the spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet) with the seven notes of a musical scale. The notes were not placed in the middle of the color bands, but rather at the divisions *between* them. A common interpretation of his system uses the Dorian mode starting on D.\n\n3.  **Find the Dividing Note:** I will establish the mapping of these divisions. The note that divides the Green color sector from the Blue color sector is the answer.\n\n4.  **Code and Execution:** The Python code will print this logic, identify the specific note at the boundary of Green and Blue, and display the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the relationship between Newton's color circle and musical notes\n    to find the note at the boundary of green and blue.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determining the colors from the user's question.\")\n    print(\"The first color is the combination of yellow and blue.
