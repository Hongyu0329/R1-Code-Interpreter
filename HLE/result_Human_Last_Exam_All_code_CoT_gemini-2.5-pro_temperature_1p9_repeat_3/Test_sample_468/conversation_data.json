    "My plan is to answer the user's question, which requires specific entomological knowledge. The question asks for the common name of the bee genus *Perdita* and the year this common name was coined. I have identified this information through my knowledge base. To adhere to the output format requirements, I will create a simple Python script that stores the name and the year in separate variables and then uses the `print()` function to display them in the requested \"<name>, <year>\" format.\n\n```python\n# This script provides the common name for the bee genus Perdita and the year it was coined.\n\n# The common name for the genus Perdita.\ncommon_name = \"Fairy bees\"\n\n# The year the common name was coined by entomologist Joseph S. Wilson in a blog post.\nyear_coined = 2013\n\n# Print the final answer in the format \"<name>, <year>\"\nprint(f\"{common_name}, {year_coined}\")\n```\n<<<Fairy bees, 2013>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In 2024, what is the currently used common name for the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\" in their native range, and when was it coined?
