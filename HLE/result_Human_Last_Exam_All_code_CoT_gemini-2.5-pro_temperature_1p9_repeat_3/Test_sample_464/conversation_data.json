    "Yes, if a Schwartz function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function.\n\n### Plan:\nThe proof relies on the properties of the Fourier transform on the Schwartz space. Let $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ be the Fourier transform of $f(x)$. The key steps are:\n1.  Show that the derivatives of the Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(\\xi)$, when evaluated at $\\xi=0$, are directly proportional to the moments of the original function, $f(x)$.\n2.  The given condition is that all moments are zero: $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0$ for all non-negative integers $k$. This implies that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at $\\xi=0$ are also zero, i.e., $\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0$ for all $k$.\n3.  A Schwartz function is analytic (equal to its Taylor series). Since all the Taylor coefficients of $\\hat{f}$ at $\\xi=0$ are zero, the function $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ must be identically zero.\n4.  The Fourier transform is an isomorphism on the Schwartz space, meaning it's a one-to-one mapping. Therefore, if $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$, the original function $f(x)$ must also be zero.\n\nI will use a Python script with the `sympy` library to symbolically demonstrate the crucial relationship in step 1. The script will calculate the first few derivatives of a generic function's Fourier transform at `xi=0` and show they correspond to the function's moments.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef demonstrate_moment_problem_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates the relationship between the moments of a function\n    and the derivatives of its Fourier transform at the origin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables\n    x, xi = sp.symbols('x xi', real=True)\n    f = sp.Function('f')(x)\n\n    # Define the Fourier Transform using its integral definition.\n    # The convention used is F(xi) = Integral(f(x)*exp(-2*pi*I*xi*x), (x, -oo, oo))\n    fourier_transform_expr = sp.Integral(f * sp.exp(-2 * sp.I * sp.pi * xi * x), (x, -sp.oo, sp.oo))\n\n    print(\"Let f(x) be a Schwartz function.\")\n    print(\"Let F(xi) be its Fourier transform, defined as:\")\n    print(f\"F(xi) = {fourier_transform_expr}\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's compute the derivatives of F(xi) with respect to xi, and evaluate them at xi = 0.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Loop to compute derivatives for k = 0, 1, 2, 3\n    for k in range(4):\n        # Differentiate under the integral sign\n        # sympy is smart enough to do this correctly\n        derivative = sp.diff(fourier_transform_expr, xi, k)\n\n        # Evaluate the derivative at xi = 0\n        derivative_at_zero = derivative.subs(xi, 0)\n        \n        # Define the k-th moment\n        moment_k = sp.Integral(x**k * f, (x, -sp.oo, sp.oo))\n        \n        print(f\"For k = {k}:\")\n        \n        # Show the k-th derivative of F(xi) evaluated at 0\n        print(f\"The {k}-th derivative of F(xi) at xi=0 is:\")\n        sp.pprint(derivative_at_zero)\n        \n        # Simplify the expression to show its relation to the k-th moment\n        # Pull out the constant factor (-2*pi*I)**k from the integral\n        constant_factor = (-2 * sp.I * sp.pi)**k\n        simplified_expr = constant_factor * moment_k\n        \n        print(\"\\nThis can be rewritten as:\")\n        equation = sp.Eq(sp.Symbol(f\"F^({k})(0)\"), simplified_expr)\n\n        # sympy's pretty print can be a bit wide, let's format it ourselves.\n        # equation for k=0: F^(0)(0) = Integral(f(x), (x, -oo, oo))\n        # equation for k>0: F^(k)(0) = (-2*I*pi)**k * Integral(x**k*f(x), (x, -oo, oo))\n        lhs = f\"F^({k})(0)\"\n        rhs = f\"{sp.pretty(constant_factor)} * {sp.pretty(moment_k)}\"\n        if k == 0:\n            rhs = f\"{sp.pretty(moment_k)}\"\n\n        print(f\"{lhs} = {rhs}\")\n        print(\"\\nIf the k-th moment Integral(x**k * f(x) dx) is 0, then F^({k})(0) = 0.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    print(\"Since all moments are zero for k=0,1,2,..., all derivatives F^(k)(0) are zero.\")\n    print(\"Because F(xi) is analytic, its Taylor series around xi=0 is identically zero.\")\n    print(\"This implies F(xi) = 0 for all xi.\")\n    print(\"By the injectivity of the Fourier transform on Schwartz space, f(x) must also be 0.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    demonstrate_moment_problem_solution()\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
