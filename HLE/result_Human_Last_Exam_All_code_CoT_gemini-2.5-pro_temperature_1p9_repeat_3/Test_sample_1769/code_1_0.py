# The task is to determine what the Modern English word for "sister" would be
# if the Old Norse language had not influenced Old English.

# Step 1: Analyze the origin of the current word "sister".
# Our current word "sister" comes directly from the Old Norse word "systir".
# This was adopted into English during the period of Viking raids and settlement
# in England between the 8th and 11th centuries.

# Step 2: Identify the native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word.
# The original word for sister in Old English, which was spoken before the
# Norse influence became widespread, was "sweostor".
# This word shares a common Germanic root with the Norse version.

# Step 3: Project the evolution of "sweostor" into Modern English.
# Languages evolve with predictable sound shifts. If "sweostor" had developed
# naturally without being replaced, it would have followed a path similar to
# other native words.
# - The "eo" diphthong in "sweostor" would likely have smoothed to a simple "e".
# - The unstressed "-or" at the end of the word would have softened to "-er",
#   much like Old English "modor" became "mother" and "f√¶der" became "father".
# Combining these changes, "sweostor" would have become "swester".

# Step 4: Present the final result.
# In fact, the word "swester" did exist in Middle English, but it was
# eventually out-competed and replaced by the Norse-derived "sister".
# Therefore, had the Norse never invaded, we would likely use this native form today.
