    "This is a fascinating question that sits at the intersection of history and linguistics. To figure this out, we need to trace the etymological roots of the word.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  First, I will establish the origin of our modern word \"sister\" to confirm it is indeed from a Norse source.\n2.  Next, I will identify the original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word for the same concept.\n3.  Then, by applying the known rules of linguistic sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English, I will project how the native Anglo-Saxon word would have evolved without any outside influence.\n4.  Finally, I will present this projected word as the answer.\n\n```python\n# The task is to determine what the Modern English word for \"sister\" would be\n# if the Old Norse language had not influenced Old English.\n\n# Step 1: Analyze the origin of the current word \"sister\".\n# Our current word \"sister\" comes directly from the Old Norse word \"systir\".\n# This was adopted into English during the period of Viking raids and settlement\n# in England between the 8th and 11th centuries.\n\n# Step 2: Identify the native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word.\n# The original word for sister in Old English, which was spoken before the\n# Norse influence became widespread, was \"sweostor\".\n# This word shares a common Germanic root with the Norse version.\n\n# Step 3: Project the evolution of \"sweostor\" into Modern English.\n# Languages evolve with predictable sound shifts. If \"sweostor\" had developed\n# naturally without being replaced, it would have followed a path similar to\n# other native words.\n# - The \"eo\" diphthong in \"sweostor\" would likely have smoothed to a simple \"e\".\n# - The unstressed \"-or\" at the end of the word would have softened to \"-er\",\n#   much like Old English \"modor\" became \"mother\" and \"f√¶der\" became \"father\".\n# Combining these changes, \"sweostor\" would have become \"swester\".\n\n# Step 4: Present the final result.\n# In fact, the word \"swester\" did exist in Middle English, but it was\n# eventually out-competed and replaced by the Norse-derived \"sister\".\n# Therefore, had the Norse never invaded, we would likely use this native form today.\n\nprint(\"If the Norse had never invaded, the Modern English word for 'sister', derived from the Old English 'sweostor', would most likely be 'swester'.\")\n```\n<<<swester>>>"
