The direct answer to the question "Does there exist a program P that computes def_superfast(10000)?" is NO.
Such a program is impossible to create due to the fundamental limits of computation, a concept proven by Alan Turing.

Here is the reasoning:

1. THE TASK:
   The function `def_superfast(10000)` requires finding a value `Huge_int`, which is the largest integer
   produced by any halting Python program whose source code is less than 10000 symbols. The function
   is supposed to return `Huge_int + 1`.

2. THE OBSTACLE - THE HALTING PROBLEM:
   To find `Huge_int`, one would need to generate, run, and inspect the output of all possible
   Python programs with length < 10000. The issue is that some of these programs will never
   halt (e.g., a program containing `while True: pass`). The Halting Problem proves that no
   single program can exist that can look at another program and decide correctly in all cases
   whether it will halt or run forever. A program attempting to compute `def_superfast` would
   get stuck forever on the first non-halting program it tries to run.

3. THE PROOF BY CONTRADICTION:
   Let's assume for a moment that a program `P` that correctly computes `def_superfast(10000)` *does* exist.

   a. We can run this program `P`. It would eventually halt and output a number.
      Let's call this number `S`. According to the definition, this final equation holds:
      S = Huge_int + 1
      where we output the numbers in the equation: `S`, `Huge_int`, `1`.

   b. Now, we can create a new, very simple Python program, let's call it `Q`.
      Program Q's source code would be: `print({S})`
      This program simply prints the number `S` that we got from our hypothetical program `P`.

   c. The source code of program `Q` is very short. It's just a print statement plus the digits of S.
      It's safe to assume its length would be far less than 10000 characters.

   d. Herein lies the paradox:
      - Program `Q` has a length less than 10000 characters.
      - The integer it returns is `S`.
      - We know that `S` is equal to `Huge_int + 1`.
      - This means `Q` produces an output that is *greater than* `Huge_int`.
      - This contradicts the very definition of `Huge_int`, which is supposed to be the *largest* integer
        producible by any program shorter than 10000 characters.

4. CONCLUSION:
   The assumption that program `P` exists leads to a logical contradiction (`Huge_int + 1 > Huge_int`).
   Therefore, the initial assumption must be false. No such program `P` can exist.
