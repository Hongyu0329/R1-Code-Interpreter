The patient's initial symptoms are classic for a manic episode.
Given the symptoms and family history, the prescribed medication was almost certainly a mood stabilizer like Lithium.
A major side effect of Lithium is its potential to cause hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).
A common clinical symptom of hypothyroidism is decreased libido or sexual dysfunction.
Therefore, the most direct and complete explanation for the series of events is that the treatment for the mood disorder led to hypothyroidism, which in turn caused sexual dysfunction.
