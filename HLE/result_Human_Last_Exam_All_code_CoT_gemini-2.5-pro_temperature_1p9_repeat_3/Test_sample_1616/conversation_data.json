    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify the word that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing:\n\n1.  **Define Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL):** First, I will clarify the linguistic rule. TSL is a sound change in the history of English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable (third from the end) of a word. For this rule to apply, a word must have at least three syllables.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Word:** I will examine each word from the list based on this rule. For each word, I'll identify a related word with a tense vowel and check two conditions:\n    a. Does the word have three or more syllables?\n    b. If so, has the tense vowel in the root been laxed (shortened)?\n\n3.  **Structure the Analysis:** I will present the analysis in a clear format, showing the \"equation\" of the sound change for each word, including the original and derived words, their syllable counts, and whether TSL applied.\n\n4.  **Identify Candidates:** Based on the analysis, I will group the words into two categories: those that underwent TSL and those that did not. The words that did not undergo the change because they don't meet the syllable count condition will be my candidates.\n\n5.  **Select the Final Answer:** From the candidates that did not undergo TSL, I will select the most distinct example. In this case, there are multiple words that did not undergo the process because they are not trisyllabic. I will select the one that is a classic textbook counter-example to TSL.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef analyze_trisyllabic_laxing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to determine which has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing (TSL)\")\n    print(\"TSL is a rule where a tense vowel (like in 'sane') becomes lax (like in 'sanity').\")\n    print(\"This happens when the vowel is in the third syllable from the end of a word.\\n\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the word must have at least 3 syllables for TSL to apply.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing each word from the list.\\n\")\n    \n    data = {\n        'Word': ['southern', 'derivative', 'serenity', 'pleasant', 'gratitude', 'shadow'],\n        'Syllables': [2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 2],\n        'Related Word (Tense Vowel)': ['south (/aʊ/)', 'derive (/aɪ/)', 'serene (/iː/)', 'please (/iː/)', 'grate(ful) (/eɪ/)', 'shade (/eɪ/)'],\n        'Resulting Vowel': ['/ʌ/', '/ɪ/', '/ɛ/', '/ɛ/', '/æ/', '/æ/'],\n        'TSL Applied?': ['No', 'Yes', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes', 'No']\n    }\n    \n    df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n    \n    print(\"Here is the breakdown for each word:\")\n    for index, row in df.iterrows():\n        print(\"--------------------\")\n        print(f\"Word: {row['Word']}\")\n        print(f\"Analysis: Compared to the root word '{row['Related Word']}', the vowel changes to {row['Resulting Vowel']}.\")\n        \n        # This section simulates the 'output each number' part of the prompt by showing the key numbers/facts\n        print(f\"Final Equation Components:\")\n        print(f\"  - Syllable count: {row['Syllables']}\")\n        \n        if row['TSL Applied?'] == 'Yes':\n            print(\"  - Conclusion: The word has 3 or more syllables and the vowel has laxed.
