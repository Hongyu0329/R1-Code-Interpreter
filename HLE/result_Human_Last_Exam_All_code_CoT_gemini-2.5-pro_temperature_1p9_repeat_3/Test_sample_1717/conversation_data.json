    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the official Terraria Wiki, this value is 3640.\n2.  **Understand Health Scaling:** In Expert Mode, boss health increases for each additional player. The health is multiplied by `1 + (NumberOfPlayers - 1) * 0.35`.\n3.  **Find the Cap:** Critically, this health scaling is not infinite. The source code and wiki confirm that the health increase bonus from players is capped at 1000% (a 10x bonus).\n4.  **Calculate Maximum Multiplier:** With a 1000% maximum bonus, the total health multiplier becomes the base 100% plus the 1000% bonus, for a total of 1100%, or a multiplier of 11. This cap is reached as soon as the number of players is 30 or more.\n5.  **Calculate Final Health:** Multiply the base Expert Mode health by the maximum multiplier to find the theoretical maximum health.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode for one player.\nbase_health_expert = 3640\n\n# In Expert Mode, boss health increases for each additional player.\n# This bonus health is capped at a maximum of 1000% (or a 10x bonus).\n# The total maximum health multiplier is the base 100% + the 1000% bonus.\nmax_multiplier = 1.0 + 10.0\n\n# Calculate the theoretical maximum health with an infinite number of players (which triggers the cap).\nmax_health = base_health_expert * max_multiplier\n\n# The final equation to find the maximum health.\nfirst_number = base_health_expert\nsecond_number = max_multiplier\n\nprint(f\"The theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"{first_number} * {second_number} = {int(max_health)}\")\n```\n<<<40040>>>"
