    print("Question: Which antioxidants are initially activated in Microcystis aeruginosa CAAT 2005-3 to counteract oxidative stress in response to high temperature exposure (29ÂºC)?")
    print("\nAnalysis:")
    print("1. High temperature stress on cyanobacteria leads to the increased production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are harmful to the cell.")
    print("2. To protect itself from this 'oxidative stress', the cell must activate its antioxidant defense systems.")
    print("3. The most immediate and primary response to a sudden increase in ROS is the activation of the enzymatic antioxidant system.")
    print("4. This system includes enzymes like Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT). SOD is the first enzyme to act, converting the superoxide radical (a major ROS) into a less harmful substance (hydrogen peroxide), which is then neutralized by CAT or other peroxidases.")
    print("5. While other antioxidants (liposoluble, hydrosoluble) also play a role, the rapid upregulation of enzymatic activity is considered the initial and principal response.")
    print("\nConclusion: Based on the analysis, the Enzymatic antioxidants are the ones initially activated.")
