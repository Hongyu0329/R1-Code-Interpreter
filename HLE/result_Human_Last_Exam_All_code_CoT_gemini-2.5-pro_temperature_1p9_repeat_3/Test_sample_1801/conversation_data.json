    "Of course. Here is a plan to answer your question using a Python script.\n\n1.  Identify the two Nobel laureates who were in the 2000 Enron commercial.\n2.  Store their names in variables.\n3.  Store other key details like the company name (\"Enron\"), the year (2000), and the tagline (\"Ask Why\") in variables.\n4.  Use `print()` statements to construct and display a sentence that answers the user's question, including all the retrieved information.\n\n```python\ndef solve_enron_commercial_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of the two Nobel laureates\n    featured in a 2000 Enron commercial.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Details of the commercial\n    company = \"Enron\"\n    year = 2000\n    tagline = \"Ask Why\"\n\n    # The two Nobel laureates\n    laureate_1 = \"Paul Krugman\"\n    laureate_2 = \"Merton Miller\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a structured way\n    print(f\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous {year} commercial for {company} were:\")\n    print(f\"1. {laureate_1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {laureate_2}\")\n    print(f\"The tagline for the commercial was \\\"{tagline}\\\".\")\n\nsolve_enron_commercial_question()\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
