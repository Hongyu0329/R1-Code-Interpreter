    This function determines the necessary assumptions and formats them
    in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) as requested.

    The problem requires identifying the necessary assumptions from a given list
    to prove that the expected information gain for a Bayesian agent converges to zero.

    Analysis:
    1.  (a) The prior has finite entropy: Necessary. It ensures the total information
        to be gained is finite, which is a precondition for the sum of information
        gains to converge.
    2.  (b) The agent interacts with a regular MDP (e.g., finite): Necessary. In an
        active learning setting (non-i.i.d. data), regularity conditions on the
        environment are needed to prevent the agent from getting stuck in
        uninformative loops, ensuring the learning process can proceed.
    3.  (c) The state occupancy limit exists: This is a consequence of learning, not a
        prerequisite assumption.
    4.  (d) Observations are i.i.d.: This simplifies the problem but contradicts the
        premise of an "agent acting in the world." Assumption (b) is needed
        precisely because data is not i.i.d.
    5.  (e) Posterior entropy approaches zero: This is a possible outcome of
        learning, not an assumption.

    Therefore, assumptions (a) and (b) are both necessary. In Conjunctive Normal
    Form, the statement "a AND b" is represented as a conjunction of clauses, where
    each clause contains one literal. The clauses and literals must be sorted
    alphabetically.
    """

    # The logical statement is "a AND b".
    # In the specified CNF format, this is "[(a) AND (b)]".
    
    # Define the literals
    literal_a = "a"
    literal_b = "b"

    # Create clauses. Since it's a simple conjunction, each clause has one literal.
    clause_1 = f"({literal_a})"
    clause_2 = f"({literal_b})"

    # Order the clauses alphabetically. '(a)' comes before '(b)'.
    clauses = [clause_1, clause_2]
    
    # Join clauses with ' AND '
    conjunction = " AND ".join(clauses)

    # Surround the whole expression with '[]'
    final_cnf = f"[{conjunction}]"
