purchase_price = 1000
date_of_agreement = datetime.date(2022, 6, 2)

# The core of this issue rests on determining when the "risk of loss" passed from the seller (Jake) to the buyer (Luke).
# In contracts for the sale of specific goods where the seller must perform an action to make the goods deliverable
# (like replacing the MacBook screen), the property and risk do not pass until two conditions are met:
# 1. The seller has completed the action, putting the goods in a deliverable state.
# 2. The buyer has received notice that the goods are in a deliverable state.

# Let's check the conditions based on the timeline.
# Action completed? Yes, Jake finished the screen replacement before the flood on the night of June 5.
# Notice given? Yes, on June 5, Jake notified Luke that the laptop would be ready for pickup on June 6.

# Since both conditions were met before the flood destroyed the laptop, the risk of loss had already transferred to Luke.
# Therefore, Jake is not legally required to return the money.

# The prompt requires an equation using the numbers. We can calculate the duration between the agreement and the notice.
days_until_notice = date_of_notice - date_of_agreement

print("Based on the analysis, the correct option is B because risk passed to Luke once the repairs were completed and he was notified that the laptop was ready.")
print("\nFinal Answer Choice: B. Jake is not required to return the money paid to him by Luke because risk of loss passed from Jake to Luke as a result of Jake completing the repairs, and thereby putting the laptop in a deliverable state, and notifying Luke of a precise date on which the laptop will be ready.")
