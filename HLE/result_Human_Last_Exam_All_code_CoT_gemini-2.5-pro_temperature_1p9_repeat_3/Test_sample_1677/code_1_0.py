    This function identifies the incorrect or inappropriate explanations for the trends
    in university entrant numbers in Japan.

    - A is incorrect: The decline of the 18-year-old population was not smaller than
      predicted; it was a well-documented, sharp decline.
    - D is inappropriate/incorrect: Other higher education institutions like two-year
      colleges have declined, and while transfers exist, it is a mischaracterization
      to say they are increasingly acting as "prep schools" to a degree that it
      significantly pushed up the total number of 4-year university entrants.

    The correct options are B, C, and E.
    The function will return the incorrect options in alphabetical order,
    separated by a comma.
