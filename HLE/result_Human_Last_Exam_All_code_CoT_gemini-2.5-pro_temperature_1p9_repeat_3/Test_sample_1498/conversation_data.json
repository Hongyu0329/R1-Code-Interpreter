    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this request:\n1.  First, I will identify the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam and the section that deals with the belief in the prophets.\n2.  I will then locate the specific verses (bayt) where the author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, begins enumerating the prophets that a Muslim should know.\n3.  The poem is clever in its structure. It first states the obligation to know the prophets (Bayt 35), then it refers to a group of 18 prophets mentioned together in the Qur'an (Bayt 36), and finally, it lists the remaining 7 prophets by name to complete the list of 25 (Bayt 37).\n4.  Therefore, the entire section dedicated to mentioning the prophets spans from the introductory verse to the final verse listing them.\n5.  I will write a Python script that stores the starting and ending verse numbers in variables and then prints a clear statement indicating this range.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt) in\n    'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' where the prophets of Islam are mentioned.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The section on the prophets begins at verse 35,\n    # which introduces the obligation to know them.\n    start_bayt = 35\n\n    # The list is completed in verse 37, where the final\n    # seven prophets are named explicitly.\n    end_bayt = 37\n\n    # Print the final answer, showing each number in the result.\n    print(\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names and mention of the Prophets are found from bayt:\")\n    print(f\"{start_bayt} to {end_bayt}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_prophets_verses()\n```\n<<<35-37>>>"
