# The user's question describes a scenario where a bacterium with a stable genome (Bacterium 2)
# acquires drug resistance as quickly as a bacterium with frequent lateral gene transfer (Bacterium 1).

# Let's break down the evolutionary dynamics.

# Bacterium 1: Acquires resistance via Lateral Gene Transfer (e.g., plasmids).
# This is a fast mechanism because pre-existing, optimized resistance genes can be shared rapidly among the population.
pace_bacterium_1 = "Fast due to horizontal sharing of genes."

# Bacterium 2: Acquires resistance via de novo mutation.
# The initial mutation event is rare. For the population to become resistant quickly,
# the mutated strain must spread extremely fast.

# Evaluating the options:
# A. "Rare mutations occurred..." - This explains the origin, but not the speed of spread. Incomplete.
# C. "Contamination..." - This dismisses the biological question instead of answering it.
# D. "...mutations that did not have compensatory mutations..." - Without compensatory mutations, the likely fitness cost of the resistance mutation would prevent the strain from spreading rapidly.
# E. "...acquired compensatory mutations that followed the rare resistance mutations." - This is a good explanation. Compensatory mutations reduce the fitness cost of the resistance, allowing the strain to proliferate.
# B. "...acquired compensatory mutations that increased the fitness to a great extent and also led to cross-resistance..." - This is the most complete answer.
#    - It includes the initial rare mutation.
#    - It includes compensatory mutations.
#    - Crucially, it specifies these mutations "increased the fitness to a great extent," which is what allows the new strain to rapidly outcompete the old one and take over the population.
#    - It adds "cross-resistance" as another factor that makes this mutational pathway exceptionally advantageous, helping to explain why it could rival the speed of lateral transfer.

# Conclusion: The combination of a rare but highly effective (cross-resistance) mutation, followed by
# powerful compensatory mutations that eliminate fitness costs and boost proliferation, provides a complete
# mechanism for rapid, population-wide resistance acquisition without lateral gene transfer.

print(f"The most comprehensive explanation is that the second bacterial population acquired an initial rare resistance mutation.")
print(f"This was followed by compensatory mutations. These secondary mutations are crucial because they alleviate the fitness cost often associated with resistance.")
print(f"As stated in the correct option, these mutations not only compensated but 'increased the fitness to a great extent', allowing the new resistant strain to rapidly proliferate and dominate the population.")
print(f"The addition of 'cross-resistance' makes the initial mutation even more powerful, further explaining how this 'slow' mutational pathway could match the pace of the 'fast' lateral transfer pathway.")
print(f"Therefore, the best explanation is provided in option {final_answer}.")
