    "To find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, we first need to understand the group's structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Group**: The generalized quaternion group of order 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$, is defined by the presentation $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups**: A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. We denote this set as $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. We need to find the number of distinct sets $G^k$ for $G=Q_{128}$.\n\n3.  **Analyze Powers of Elements**: We analyze the sets $Q_{128}^k$ based on whether the exponent $k$ is odd or even.\n    *   **If $k$ is odd**: It can be shown that for any odd integer $k$, the set of $k$-th powers of elements in $Q_{128}$ is the group $Q_{128}$ itself. This gives us one power subgroup.\n    *   **If $k$ is even**: For any even integer $k$, the power set $Q_{128}^k$ is a cyclic subgroup of the subgroup generated by $x$, which is $\\langle x \\rangle$. Specifically, $Q_{128}^k = \\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups**: We need to count how many unique subgroups arise from these two cases.\n    *   The first case gives us 1 subgroup: $Q_{128}$.\n    *   The second case gives us a collection of cyclic subgroups, $\\{\\langle x^k \\rangle \\mid k \\text{ is even}\\}$. A subgroup of $\\langle x \\rangle$ (which is cyclic of order 64) is uniquely defined by a divisor $d$ of 64, written as $\\langle x^d \\rangle$. The number of distinct subgroups from the even powers is the number of distinct values of $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$ where $k$ is an even integer.\n    *   Let $k = 2m$. Then $d = \\gcd(2m, 64) = 2 \\cdot \\gcd(m, 32)$. As $m$ varies, $\\gcd(m, 32)$ takes on all possible values that are divisors of 32.\n    *   Therefore, the number of distinct cyclic power subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of 32.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The total number of power subgroups is $1$ (from the odd exponents) plus the number of divisors of 32 (from the even exponents). The python code will calculate the number of divisors of 32, add 1, and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef count_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \n    The total number is 1 (from the group itself, generated by any odd power k)\n    plus the number of distinct cyclic subgroups generated by even powers k.\n    \n    The number of distinct cyclic power subgroups is equal to the number of divisors of 32.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # For Q_128, the cyclic subgroup <x> has order 64.
