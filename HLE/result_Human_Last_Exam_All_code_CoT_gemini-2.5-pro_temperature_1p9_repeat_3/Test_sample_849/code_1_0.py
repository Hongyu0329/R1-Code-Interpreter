# The problem asks for a safe goal for an AI model M when its primary success
# metric is uncomputable. This is a classic AI safety problem.
# The core idea is to replace an external, uncomputable goal (predictive success)
# with an internal, computable one (adherence to verifiable safety rules).

# The template to complete is: {_______ learning} from {_______}
# I am interpreting this template as the "equation" to be solved, as mentioned
# in the user prompt. The "numbers" in this "equation" are the phrases that
# complete the blanks.

# Part 1: Define the type of learning for the first blank: {_______ learning}
# The goal should be to seek approval from a verifiable, computable process,
# rather than pursuing an unprovable external outcome.
# "Approval-based" is a fitting hyphenated term.
part1 = "Approval-based learning"

# Part 2: Define the source of the learning signal for the second blank: from {_______}
# The approval signal must come from a rigorous, computable process.
# "formal verification" is the standard term for this process. It consists of
# two words and is not hyphenated, which adheres to the given constraints.
part2 = "formal verification"

# Construct the final goal by combining the two parts.
# This represents the solution to the "equation".
safe_goal = f"{part1} from {part2}"

# Print the final, completed template string.
print(safe_goal)
