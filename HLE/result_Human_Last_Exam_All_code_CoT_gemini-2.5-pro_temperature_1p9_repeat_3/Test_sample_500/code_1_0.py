# Problem parameters
lam = 3 # arrival rate
# The problem specifies that for some positive integer m, the service time S has a tail probability
# P(S > u) = 1/(3*u) + m/(u*ln(u)) for large u.

# We are asked to calculate liminf_{t->inf} X_t, where X_t is the number of customers at time t.

# Step 1: Identify the queueing model as M/G/infinity.
# Step 2: Analyze the service time distribution. The mean service time E[S] is infinite
# because the integral of P(S > u) diverges.
# Step 3: Check the criticality condition. The critical parameter rho is defined as:
# rho = lambda * lim_{u->inf} (u * P(S > u))
# c = lim_{u->inf} (u * (1/(3*u) + m/(u*ln(u)))) = 1/3.
# rho = lam * c = 3 * (1/3) = 1.
# This is the critical case rho = 1.
# Step 4: Apply the specific theorem for this critical case.
# A result in queueing theory states that for an M/G/infinity queue
# with P(S > u) = 1/(lambda*u) + m/(u*ln(u)) + o(1/(u*ln(u))),
# the limit inferior of the number of customers is equal to m.
# liminf_{t->inf} X_t = m

# The problem states 'm' is a positive integer, but does not provide a value.
# The answer is therefore the variable 'm'.
# To fulfill the requirement of showing a calculation, we state the final equation.
# The numbers in the equation are the variable 'm'.
# Let's use an example value, say m=2, to demonstrate the output.
m = 2

# The final equation is Result = m.
final_answer = m
