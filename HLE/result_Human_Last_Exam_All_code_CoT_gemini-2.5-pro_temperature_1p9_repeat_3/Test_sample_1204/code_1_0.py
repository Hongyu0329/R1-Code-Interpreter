    # Step 1: Analyze the rationale for each option.
    # I: High Priority. Heavy cannabis use is likely worsening anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD,
    #    and interfering with medication efficacy. Counseling is the appropriate first step.
    # III: High Priority. Objective data is crucial. A UDS confirms substance use and screens
    #      for others, informing safe and effective treatment planning. It's a foundational step.
    # IV: Medium-High Priority. This directly addresses a chief complaint (insomnia) with a
    #     low-risk intervention. It helps build rapport while bigger issues are tackled.
    # II: Low Priority. Hospitalization is a drastic measure and not an immediate first step.
    # V: Low Priority. AUD is in remission; there's no urgent need to change this regimen.
    # VI: Invalid Option. The patient is already on atomoxetine, so it cannot be "started."

    # Based on the analysis, the most appropriate and urgent actions are I, III, and IV.
