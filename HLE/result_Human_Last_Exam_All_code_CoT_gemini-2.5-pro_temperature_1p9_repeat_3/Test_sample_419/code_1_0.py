    # Step 1: Define the core purpose of the experiment.
    # The goal is to show that a specific antibody's binding is inhibited by free sugar.
    # The comparison is: (Antibody binding with PBS) vs (Antibody binding with inhibitor).
    print("Experimental Goal: Show that free GalNAc inhibits antibody binding to glycosylated MUC1.")
    
    # Step 2: Identify the critical confounding variable.
    # A high concentration of an additive can have unintended side effects.
    print(f"\nPotential Issue: The high inhibitor concentration of {inhibitor_concentration} mM GalNAc might affect the cells themselves.")
    print("Specifically, it could cause the MUC1 protein to be removed from the cell surface.")
    
    # Step 3: Determine the role of the anti-flag antibody as a control.
    # The anti-flag antibody binds to the MUC1 protein itself, not the sugar.
    # Therefore, its signal measures the total amount of MUC1 on the surface.
    print("\nRole of Anti-Flag Control: To verify that the amount of MUC1 on the cell surface is unchanged by the inhibitor.")
    
    # Step 4: Determine the correct experimental step for the anti-flag antibody.
    # It binds directly to the target protein (via the tag), so it is a primary antibody.
    print("\nTiming: As an antibody that binds the main target, it is a primary antibody and should be added with other primary antibodies.")

    # Step 5: Synthesize the conclusion.
    # The anti-flag antibody is added with the primary antibodies to verify that the
    # inhibitor has not caused a decrease in MUC1 surface expression.
    # This matches choice C.
    print("\nConclusion: The anti-flag antibody is added with the primaries to verify surface expression of MUC1 is not altered.")
