    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** The chemical formula for toluene is C7H8, which means we have 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set:** This notation tells us how many functions are used for each atom.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** It's a split-valence basis set. The single valence orbital (1s) is represented by two contracted functions.\n    *   **For Carbon (C):** It's also split-valence. The core orbital (1s) is described by one contracted function. The valence orbitals (2s, 2p) are split into two parts (an inner and an outer set). Each part consists of one s-function and one set of p-functions (px, py, pz). This results in 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted functions per Carbon atom.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** We multiply the number of each type of atom by the number of functions it contributes and then sum the results.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (a second-row atom): 1 for core (1s) + 4 for inner valence (2s, 2p) + 4 for outer valence (2s, 2p) = 9\nfuncs_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (a first-row atom): 1 for inner valence (1s) + 1 for outer valence (1s) = 2\nfuncs_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from carbon and hydrogen atoms\ntotal_funcs_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * funcs_per_carbon\ntotal_funcs_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * funcs_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the grand total\ntotal_contracted_functions = total_funcs_carbon + total_funcs_hydrogen\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final answer\nprint(\"Calculation for toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = ({num_carbon_atoms} C atoms * {funcs_per_carbon} functions/C) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} H atoms * {funcs_per_hydrogen} functions/H)\")\nprint(f\"Total functions = {total_funcs_carbon} + {total_funcs_hydrogen}\")\nprint(f\"Total number of contracted Gaussian functions = {total_contracted_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
