    "I will determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n### My plan:\n1.  First, I will identify the source space $LHS = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and the target space $RHS = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n2.  Then, I'll calculate the connectivity of both the source and target spaces using standard formulas from algebraic topology:\n    *   Connectivity of an n-sphere $S^n$ is $n-1$.\n    *   Connectivity of a loop space $\\Omega X$ is one less than the connectivity of $X$.\n    *   Connectivity of a suspension $\\Sigma X$ is one more than the connectivity of $X$.\n    *   Connectivity of a smash product $X \\wedge Y$ is one more than the sum of the connectivities of $X$ and $Y$.\n3.  Based on the connectivities of the spaces, I'll find a lower bound on the connectivity of the map $f$.\n4.  To find the precise connectivity, I will examine the homomorphism $f_*$ induced by the map $f$ on the first non-trivial homotopy groups. I will cite known results from homotopy theory for the properties of this homomorphism.\n5.  I will continue this analysis for the next homotopy group until the condition for connectivity (surjectivity) is not met, which will determine the final answer.\n6.  The Python code below will perform these calculations step-by-step and print the reasoning along with the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map:\n    f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # In algebraic topology, the connectivity of a space X, denoted conn(X),\n    # is the largest integer k such that all homotopy groups pi_i(X) are trivial for i <= k.\n    \n    # Let's define the connectivity of the building blocks.\n    # The connectivity of an n-sphere S^n is n-1.\n    conn_S4 = 4 - 1\n    conn_S6 = 6 - 1\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the connectivity of the source space LHS = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6).\")\n    \n    # The connectivity of a loop space Omega X is conn(X) - 1.\n    conn_Omega_S4 = conn_S4 - 1\n    conn_Omega_S6 = conn_S6 - 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of Omega S^4 is conn(S^4) - 1 = {conn_S4} - 1 = {conn_Omega_S4}.\")\n    print(f\"Connectivity of Omega S^6 is conn(S^6) - 1 = {conn_S6} - 1 = {conn_Omega_S6}.\")\n\n    # The connectivity of a smash product X wedge Y is conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1.\n    conn_wedge = conn_Omega_S4 + conn_Omega_S6 + 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of (Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) is conn(Omega S^4) + conn(Omega S^6) + 1 = {conn_Omega_S4} + {conn_Omega_S6} + 1 = {conn_wedge}.\")\n    \n    # The connectivity of a suspension Sigma X is conn(X) + 1.\n    conn_LHS = conn_wedge + 1\n    print(f\"Connectivity of LHS = Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) is conn(wedge product) + 1 = {conn_wedge} + 1 = {conn_LHS}.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the connectivity of the target space RHS = Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\")\n    # S^4 wedge S^6 is homotopy equivalent to S^(4+6) = S^10.\n    conn_S10 = 10 - 1\n    conn_RHS = conn_S10 - 1\n    print(f\"The target space is Omega(S^4 wedge S^6), which is Omega(S^10).\")\n    print(f\"Connectivity of RHS = Omega(S^10) is conn(S^10) - 1 = {conn_S10} - 1 = {conn_RHS}.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Analyze the map's connectivity based on the space connectivities.\")\n    print(f\"Both LHS and RHS are {conn_LHS}-connected.
