    print("Step 1: Understanding Ammonia Tunneling")
    print("------------------------------------------")
    print("The phenomenon of tunneling in ammonia (NH3) arises from its molecular structure.")
    print("The nitrogen (N) atom can be on one of two sides of the plane formed by the three hydrogen (H) atoms.")
    print("This creates a double-well potential energy profile. According to quantum mechanics,")
    print("the nitrogen atom's wavefunction can 'tunnel' through the energy barrier between these two wells.")
    print("This tunneling splits the ground vibrational state into two closely spaced energy levels:")
    print("a lower-energy symmetric state and a higher-energy antisymmetric state.")
    print("This fundamental potential energy structure is determined by the masses and charges of the nuclei and electrons, not by nuclear spin.\n")
    
    print("Step 2: The Role of Particle Statistics (Symmetry)")
    print("-----------------------------------------------------")
    print("When a molecule contains identical particles (like the three H atoms), the total wavefunction")
    print("of the molecule must obey specific symmetry rules upon the exchange of any two of these particles.")
    print("The total wavefunction is approximately Ψ_total = Ψ_rotational * Ψ_vibrational * Ψ_nuclear_spin.")
    print("- Ordinary Hydrogen (Proton): Spin 1/2. It is a fermion. The total wavefunction must be ANTI-SYMMETRIC upon exchange.")
    print("- Exotic Hydrogen: Spin 0. It is a boson. The total wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC upon exchange.\n")

    print("Step 3: Analyzing Exotic Ammonia (Spin-0 Hydrogens)")
    print("-----------------------------------------------------")
    print("For exotic ammonia, the total wavefunction must be SYMMETRIC.")
    print("- The nuclear spin for a spin-0 particle is just one state, so the combined nuclear spin wavefunction (Ψ_nuclear_spin) for the three hydrogens is always SYMMETRIC.")
    print("- Therefore, for the total wavefunction to be symmetric, the product (Ψ_rotational * Ψ_vibrational) must also be SYMMETRIC.\n")

    print("Step 4: Are the Tunneling States Allowed?")
    print("-------------------------------------------")
    print("The two vibrational states involved in tunneling have different symmetries. One is symmetric, and one is antisymmetric.")
    print("The rotational states of the molecule also have various symmetries.")
    print("To satisfy the overall symmetry requirement, we need (Ψ_rotational * Ψ_vibrational) to be symmetric. This can be achieved in two ways:")
    print("1. (Symmetric Ψ_rotational) * (Symmetric Ψ_vibrational)")
    print("2. (Antisymmetric Ψ_rotational) * (Antisymmetric Ψ_vibrational)")
    print("\nBecause combinations exist for BOTH the symmetric and the antisymmetric vibrational states, both energy levels of the tunneling doublet are allowed by the symmetry rules.")
    print("The symmetry constraint does not forbid tunneling; it only restricts which rotational states can be associated with each level of the tunneling pair.\n")

    print("Conclusion")
    print("----------")
    print("The fundamental potential energy surface that allows for tunneling still exists.")
    print("The symmetry requirements for bosons (spin-0 hydrogens) still permit the existence of both the lower and upper energy levels of the tunneling doublet.")
    print("Therefore, the energy splitting due to tunneling would still exist.")
