    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to handle a very large number. Standard calculators and programming language data types lack the precision for this.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **High-Precision Arithmetic**: The number 10^100, also known as a googol, is a 1 followed by 100 zeros. We must use a library capable of arbitrary-precision arithmetic. The `mpmath` library in Python is an excellent tool for this.\n2.  **Periodicity of Tangent**: The tangent function is periodic with a period of π. This means that tan(x) = tan(x - nπ) for any integer n. The core of the problem is to find the value of `10^100 mod π` with high accuracy. The `mpmath` library's `tan` function handles this argument reduction automatically and correctly.\n3.  **Required Precision**: To get an accurate result for `tan(10^100)`, the precision used for the calculation must be greater than the number of digits in the input. Since 10^100 has 101 digits, we will set the precision in `mpmath` to a slightly higher value, like 110 decimal places, to ensure correctness.\n4.  **Extraction**: After calculating the value of tan(10^100), the result will be a high-precision number. We will convert this number to a string and extract the first three digits that appear after the decimal point.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. Please note that you need to have the `mpmath` library installed. If you don't have it, you can install it by running `pip install mpmath` in your shell.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\ndef find_tan_googol_digits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set the precision (dps = decimal places) for the calculation.\n    # 10^100 is a 101-digit number. To accurately calculate its tangent,\n    # which involves finding its value modulo pi, we need more precision.\n    # A value of 110 is sufficient.\n    mpmath.mp.dps = 110\n\n    # The number we are working with is 10^100. We represent it as '1e100'\n    # in a string to avoid any floating-point limitations.\n    number_str = '10^100'\n    argument = mpmath.mpf('1e100')\n\n    # Calculate tan(10^100). mpmath handles the large number and\n    # the periodic reduction (mod pi) automatically.\n    result = mpmath.tan(argument)\n\n    # The final equation is tan(10^100) = result.\n    # As requested, we will output each number in this final equation.\n    print(f\"The equation we are solving is tan(x) = y\")\n    print(f\"The value for x is {number_str}.\")\n    print(f\"The value for y (the result) is: {result}\")\n    \n    # Convert the high-precision result to a string to extract the digits.\n    result_str = str(result)\n    \n    # Find the position of the decimal point (the \"comma\").\n    try:\n        decimal_point_index = result_str.index('.')\n        # Extract the 3 digits immediately following the decimal point.\n        first_three_digits = result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n        \n        # Print the final answer.\n        print(f\"\\nThe first 3 digits after the comma of tan({number_str}) are: {first_three_digits}\")\n\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"\\nThe result did not contain a decimal point.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_tan_googol_digits()\n```\n<<<579>>>"
