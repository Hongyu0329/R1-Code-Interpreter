# Step 1: Define the values for 'a' and 'b' based on our derivation.
# a represents the result of operation P (DOUBLE) on Church numeral 1.
# b represents the result of operation P (DOUBLE) on Church numeral 2.
p_of_1 = 2 * 1
p_of_2 = 2 * 2

a = p_of_1
b = p_of_2

# Step 2: Calculate n using the formula n = b^3 * a.
n = (b**3) * a

# Step 3: Calculate the final result, log_2(n).
result = math.log2(n)

# Step 4: Print the components of the calculation.
# As requested, each number in the final equation must be outputted.
print(f"The integer n is calculated as b^3 * a")
print(f"The value of a is: {a}")
print(f"The value of b is: {b}")
print(f"The value of n = {b}^3 * {a} = {n}")
print(f"The value of log_2(n) = log_2({n}) is:")
print(result)
