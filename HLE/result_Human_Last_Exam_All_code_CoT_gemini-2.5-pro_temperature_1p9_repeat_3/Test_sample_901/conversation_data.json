    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve this organic chemistry problem, followed by a Python script that provides the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**:\n    *   **Substrate**: `(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane`. This is a secondary alkyl halide.\n    *   **Reagent**: `Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK)` in `tert-butyl alcohol`. This is a strong, sterically bulky (hindered) base.\n    *   The combination of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction.\n\n2.  **Determine the Stereochemistry and Conformation of the Substrate**:\n    *   The stereodescriptors for a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, `(1S,2R)`, indicate a `cis` relationship between the two substituents (bromo and methyl groups).\n    *   A cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane exists as two interconverting chair conformations, one with (axial/equatorial) substituents and the other with (equatorial/axial).\n    *   The methyl group (-CH3) is sterically bulkier than the bromine atom (-Br). To achieve the most stable conformation, the larger group (methyl) will prefer the equatorial position to minimize steric strain.\n    *   Therefore, the major, most stable conformation of the starting material is the one where the **methyl group is equatorial** and the **bromine atom is axial**.\n\n3.  **Apply the E2 Mechanism Rule**:\n    *   The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Br) and the proton (H) being removed must be in an **anti-periplanar** configuration. In a cyclohexane chair, this means they must both be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one up, one down).\n    *   Since the reactant's most stable conformation has an axial bromine, it is already perfectly set up to undergo the E2 reaction without needing to flip into a less stable state.\n\n4.  **Identify Possible Products (Regiochemistry)**:\n    *   With the bromine atom being axial on carbon 1 (C1), we look for axial protons on the adjacent carbons, C2 and C6.\n    *   **Path A (Zaitsev elimination)**: There is an axial proton on C2. Removing this proton would create a double bond between C1 and C2, forming **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted (thermodynamically more stable) alkene.\n    *   **Path B (Hofmann elimination)**: There is an axial proton on C6. Removing this proton would create a double bond between C1 and C6, forming **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted (thermodynamically less stable) alkene.\n\n5.  **Determine the Major Product (Hofmann's Rule)**:\n    *   The choice between the Zaitsev and Hofmann products depends on the base.\n    *   Potassium tert-butoxide is a **bulky base**. Due to its large size, it has difficulty accessing sterically hindered protons.\n    *   The axial proton on C2 is sterically shielded by the nearby equatorial methyl group. The axial proton on C6 is much more accessible.\n    *   Therefore, the bulky t-BuOK base will preferentially remove the less hindered proton from C6. This selective formation of the less-substituted alkene when using a bulky base is known as **Hofmann's Rule**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   The reaction follows the E2 pathway, and due to the bulky base, Hofmann's rule dictates the outcome. The major product will be **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef identify_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the E2 reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    with potassium tert-butoxide and identifies the major product based on\n    stereochemistry and regioselectivity rules.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Reasoning Summary ---\n    # 1. Reaction Type: E2 Elimination due to a strong, bulky base (t-BuOK) on a secondary halide.\n    # 2. Reactant Conformation: The (1S,2R) isomer is cis. Its most stable chair form has Br in the axial position and the CH3 group in the equatorial position. This is the reactive conformation for E2.\n    # 3. Regioselectivity: The bulky base t-BuOK follows Hofmann's rule, preferentially abstracting the least sterically hindered proton.\n    #    - The proton on C2 is hindered by the methyl group, leading to the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).\n    #    - The proton on C6 is unhindered, leading to the Hofmann product (3-methylcyclohexene).\n    # 4.
