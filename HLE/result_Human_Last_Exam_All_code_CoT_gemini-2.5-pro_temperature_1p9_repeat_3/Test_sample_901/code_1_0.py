    # --- Reasoning Summary ---
    # 1. Reaction Type: E2 Elimination due to a strong, bulky base (t-BuOK) on a secondary halide.
    # 2. Reactant Conformation: The (1S,2R) isomer is cis. Its most stable chair form has Br in the axial position and the CH3 group in the equatorial position. This is the reactive conformation for E2.
    # 3. Regioselectivity: The bulky base t-BuOK follows Hofmann's rule, preferentially abstracting the least sterically hindered proton.
    #    - The proton on C2 is hindered by the methyl group, leading to the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).
    #    - The proton on C6 is unhindered, leading to the Hofmann product (3-methylcyclohexene).
    # 4. Conclusion: The Hofmann product is the major product.
