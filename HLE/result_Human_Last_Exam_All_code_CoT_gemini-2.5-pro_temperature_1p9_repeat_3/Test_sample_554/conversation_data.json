    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar,\" we first need to define a standard \"nanocar\" molecule. I will base this calculation on a well-documented nanocar synthesized by the group of Professor James Tour at Rice University, first reported in 2005.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the Base Molecule**: The chosen nanocar consists of a chassis and four C60 fullerene \"wheels\". The \"perfluoro-\" prefix implies replacing hydrogens with fluorines. Since the C60 wheels are all-carbon, we only need to consider the hydrogen atoms on the chassis.\n2.  **Determine the Chassis Structure**: The chassis is 2,2',5,5'-tetra(4-tert-butylphenylethynyl)-1,1'-biphenyl.\n3.  **Count the Hydrogen Atoms**: I will systematically count the hydrogen atoms on each part of the chassis.\n    *   **Central Core**: The 1,1'-biphenyl core has hydrogens at the positions not occupied by substituents (positions 3, 3', 4, 4', 6, and 6').\n    *   **Axle Groups**: There are four phenylene groups in the axles. We count the hydrogens on these.\n    *   **End Groups**: There are four tert-butyl groups at the ends of the axles. We count their hydrogens.\n4.  **Calculate Total Atoms**: The total number of hydrogens is the sum from all parts. For a \"perfluoronanocar,\" this total number will be equal to the number of fluorine atoms.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: The Python script will perform this calculation, showing each step of the summation clearly in the output.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fluorine_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n    The calculation is based on the structure of a real nanocar from the Tour group.\n    A \"perfluorinated\" molecule has all its hydrogen atoms replaced by fluorine atoms.\n    We need to count the total number of hydrogen atoms on the nanocar's chassis.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
