    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Graph Structure:**\n*   A barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two identical, fully connected graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each.\n*   A single edge, known as the \"bottleneck\" or \"bridge\", connects one node from the first clique to one node from the second.\n\n**2. Understand Randomized Uniform Gossiping:**\n*   This is a two-step process for activating or \"sampling\" an edge in a graph:\n    1.  First, a node `i` is selected uniformly at random from all `N` nodes in the graph. The probability of selecting any specific node is `1/N`.\n    2.  Second, node `i` selects one of its neighbors `j` uniformly at random to interact with. The probability of selecting a specific neighbor `j` is `1/degree(i)`, where `degree(i)` is the number of edges connected to node `i`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Probability:**\n*   The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` can be sampled in two ways:\n    *   We pick node `u` first, and then `u` picks its neighbor `v`.\n    *   We pick node `v` first, and then `v` picks its neighbor `u`.\n*   The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events:\n    `P(sample edge (u,v)) = P(pick u) * P(u picks v) + P(pick v) * P(v picks u)`\n*   We can write this using the formula:\n    `P(sample edge (u,v)) = (1/N) * (1/degree(u)) + (1/N) * (1/degree(v))`\n    `P(sample edge (u,v)) = (1/N) * (1/degree(u) + 1/degree(v))`\n\n**4. Determine the Node Degrees:**\n*   Let's find the degree for the two nodes `u` and `v` connected by the bottleneck.\n*   Node `u` is in a clique of 5 nodes, so it is connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique. It is also connected to node `v` via the bottleneck.\n*   Therefore, `degree(u) = 4 (clique) + 1 (bottleneck) = 5`.\n*   By symmetry, `degree(v)` is also 5.\n\n**5. Final Calculation:**\n*   Now we can plug all the numbers into the formula:\n    *   `N` (total nodes) = 10\n    *   `degree(u)` = 5\n    *   `degree(v)` = 5\n*   The Python code below will perform this final calculation and present the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bottleneck_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph\n    with 10 nodes using randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
