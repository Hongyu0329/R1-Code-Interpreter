# This script provides the missing Old Church Slavonic verb form.
# The request asks for the "3rd person singular plural, imperative" form of the verb "to be".
# Assuming "singular plural" is a typo for "plural", the target is the 3rd person plural imperative.
# In Old Church Slavonic, this is the form "бѫдѫтъ" (bǫdǫtъ), which means "let them be".
