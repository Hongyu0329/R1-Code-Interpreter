    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the final python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the concept**: The Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk electronic structure of a 2D material. A key property of such invariants is that they are additive.\n2.  **Formulate the rule**: When two topological systems (like Chern insulators) are brought into contact without closing the bulk energy gap, the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n3.  **Identify the given values**:\n    *   Chern number of the first insulator, C1 = 1.\n    *   Chern number of the second insulator, C2 = 1.\n4.  **Calculate the total Chern number**: The total Chern number of the junction, C_total, will be C1 + C2.\n5.  **Write the Python script**: Create a script that defines the individual Chern numbers, calculates their sum, and prints the result in a clear equation format as requested.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers for the two insulators\nchern_insulator_1 = 1\nchern_insulator_2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers\n# because the Chern number is an additive topological invariant.\nchern_junction = chern_insulator_1 + chern_insulator_2\n\n# Print the final equation showing the calculation\nprint(\"The Chern number of the first insulator is: 1\")\nprint(\"The Chern number of the second insulator is: 1\")\nprint(f\"The total Chern number of the junction is the sum of the two: {chern_insulator_1} + {chern_insulator_2} = {chern_junction}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider two Chern insulators with Chern number 1 that connects laterally and have negligible tunneling barrier, what is the Chern number of this junction. \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
