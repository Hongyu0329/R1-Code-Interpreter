    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will follow these steps:\n1.  First, identify the equilibrium points of the system. These are points where the derivatives of both variables are zero, representing states where the system is stationary.\n2.  Next, we analyze the stability of these equilibrium points by linearizing the system, which involves calculating the Jacobian matrix and its eigenvalues at each point. This helps classify them as nodes, saddles, spirals, etc.\n3.  Separatrices are special trajectories that often originate from or lead to saddle points, acting as boundaries between regions of different dynamic behaviors. We will focus on the saddle point(s) to find its stable and unstable manifolds, which are the separatrices.\n4.  We will search for an exact analytical solution for a trajectory in the phase plane. This is done by forming a single differential equation for $d$ as a function of $u$, i.e., $dd/du$.\n5.  By guessing a simple form for the solution, specifically a power function $d = au^k$, we can solve for the constants $a$ and $k$. This will give us the equation of an invariant curve.\n6.  Finally, we will confirm that this invariant curve is indeed one of the manifolds of the saddle point, solidifying its status as the principal separatrix of the system.\n\nLet's start the analysis.\n\nThe system is:\n$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Equilibrium Points and Stability**\nSetting $u'(t)=0$ gives $u^2(u-1)=0$, which yields $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n*   If $u=0$, the equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point $(0,0)$.\n*   If $u=1$, the equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, so $2d^2+2d=0$, which gives $2d(d+1)=0$. This yields $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives two equilibrium points: $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$.\n\nBy analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the system at these points, we find that $(1,0)$ is an unstable node (a source) and $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point. The point $(0,0)$ is a more complex, non-hyperbolic point.\n\n**Step 3 & 4: Finding the Separatrix**\nSaddle points are critical for finding separatrices. The separatrix is often the stable or unstable manifold of a saddle point. We look for an invariant curve passing through the saddle $(1,-1)$. To do this, we form the ODE for the trajectories in the phase plane $(u,d)$:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} $$\n\n**Step 5: Guessing a Solution**\nThis is a Riccati differential equation, which is generally difficult to solve. However, we can test for a simple polynomial solution of the form $d=au^k$. After some trials, let's test the form $d=au^2$.\nThen, $\\frac{dd}{du} = 2au$. Substituting $d=au^2$ into the ODE and simplifying leads to:\n$ 2au^4 - 2au^3 = (2a^2+5a+1)u^4 + (-3a-1)u^3 $\nFor this equality to hold for all $u$, the coefficients of the powers of $u$ must be equal.\n*   Coefficients of $u^3$: $-2a = -3a-1 \\implies a=-1$.\n*   Coefficients of $u^4$: $2a = 2a^2+5a+1 \\implies 2a^2+3a+1=0$.\n\nPlugging $a=-1$ into the second equation: $2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) + 1 = 2-3+1=0$. The equation holds.\nThus, $d=-u^2$ is an exact solution curve of the system.\n\n**Step 6: Confirmation**\nThe curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the origin $(0,0)$ (since $d=-(0)^2=0$) and the saddle point $(1,-1)$ (since $d=-(1)^2=-1$). The unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$ must be tangent to its corresponding eigenvector. An analysis of the Jacobian at $(1,-1)$ shows the unstable eigenvector direction has a slope of $-2$. The derivative of our curve is $dd/du = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is indeed $-2$. This confirms that the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$, and therefore it is the key separatrix for this system.\n\n```python\n# The separatrix is an invariant curve of the system.\n# Through analysis, we found this curve has the form d = a * u**b.\n# The coefficient 'a' and the exponent 'b' are determined by solving the system's\n# differential equation in the phase plane.\n\n# The coefficient of the separatrix equation\na = -1\n# The exponent of u in the separatrix equation\nb = 2\n\n# Print the equation of the separatrix, explicitly showing the numbers.\nprint(f\"The equation of the separatrix is d = {a} * u**{b}\")\n\n```\n<<<The equation of the separatrix is d = -1 * u**2>>>"
