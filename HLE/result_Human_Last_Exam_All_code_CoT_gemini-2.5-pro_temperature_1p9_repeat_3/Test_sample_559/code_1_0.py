# The separatrix is an invariant curve of the system.
# Through analysis, we found this curve has the form d = a * u**b.
# The coefficient 'a' and the exponent 'b' are determined by solving the system's
# differential equation in the phase plane.

# The coefficient of the separatrix equation
a = -1
# The exponent of u in the separatrix equation
b = 2

# Print the equation of the separatrix, explicitly showing the numbers.
