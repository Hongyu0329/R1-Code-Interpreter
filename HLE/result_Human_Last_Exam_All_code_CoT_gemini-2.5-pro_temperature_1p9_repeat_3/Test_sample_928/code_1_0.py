# The sentences are from Noam Chomsky's "Syntactic Structures".
# He uses several examples to show the difference between syntactically correct
# and incorrect sentences. The question asks for the nouns in the last correct
# and last incorrect sentences he provides in this context.

# The last syntactically correct sentence given is:
# "the boy may admire sincerity"

# The last syntactically incorrect sentence given is:
# "sincerity may admire the boy"

# The two nouns used in this final pair of sentences are:
noun1 = "boy"
noun2 = "sincerity"

print(f"The two nouns are:")
