    print("""Analysis of the Security Premise:
The question proposes a scenario where an adversary has complete knowledge of a cryptographic system, including the protocol, architecture, AND the encryption keys. This premise violates the most fundamental requirement of any secure encryption scheme.

Let's break down why the proposed solutions are not viable under this condition:

A. Quantum Encryption: While advanced, it still uses keys (qubit keys). If an adversary knows the key, they can break the encryption.

B. Fast Key Rotation: This strategy minimizes the *duration* of a key's usefulness. However, if the adversary has knowledge of each *new* key as it is generated, then communication is never secure.

C. Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS): This ensures that if a long-term key is compromised, *past* sessions remain secure. It does not protect the *current* session if its specific ephemeral key is known to the adversary.

D. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD): This is a secure method for *transmitting* a key. It's designed to prevent eavesdropping during key exchange but provides no protection if the key is already compromised.

E. Quantum Random One-Time-Pad (OTP): The OTP is perfectly secure *only if* the key (the pad) remains a perfect secret. If the adversary knows the pad, the cipher is broken.

Conclusion:
The secrecy of the key is the cornerstone of cryptography, as established by Kerckhoffs's Principle. If the key is known to the adversary, the system is, by definition, compromised. No amount of protocol or architectural cleverness can restore security once the key is lost. Therefore, maintaining security is theoretically impossible.""")
