    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Verify Quasi-Homogeneity and Determine Degree (d):** A polynomial is quasi-homogeneous if all its monomials have the same weighted degree. I will calculate the weighted degree for each term of the polynomial $f = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$ using the weights $w=(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$. The weighted degree of a monomial $z_1^{a_1}z_2^{a_2}z_3^{a_3}z_4^{a_4}z_5^{a_5}$ is $a_1w_1+a_2w_2+a_3w_3+a_4w_4+a_5w_5$. The degree of the polynomial, $d$, will be this common value. If there's an inconsistent term, I will assume it's a typo and use the degree shared by the majority of the terms.\n2.  **Calculate the Sum of Weights ($\\sum w_i$):** I will sum the given weights of the ambient space.\n3.  **Apply the Crawley-Nordström Invariant Formula:** The invariant is calculated using the formula $cn(f) = \\frac{d - \\sum w_i}{d}$. For a Calabi-Yau link, it is expected that $d = \\sum w_i$, which would make the invariant 0. I will perform the calculation to confirm this.\n4.  **Present the Final Result:** The script will print all calculation steps and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef calculate_crawley_nordstrom_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a given Calabi-Yau link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define weights and polynomial terms\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n    # Polynomial: z_1^8z_3 + z_1^4z_2^3z_3 + z_1z_2^7 + z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5 + z_2z_3^4 + z_4^3z_5 + z_5^3\n    # Each inner list represents the exponents [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5] for a term.\n    terms_exponents = [\n        [8, 0, 1, 0, 0],  # z_1^8*z_3\n        [4, 3, 1, 0, 0],  # z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3\n        [1, 7, 0, 0, 0],  # z_1*z_2^7\n        [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],  # z_1*z_2*z_3*z_4*z_5\n        [0, 1, 4, 0, 0],  # z_2*z_3^4\n        [0, 0, 0, 3, 1],  # z_4^3*z_5\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 3],  # z_5^3\n    ]\n    term_strings = [\n        \"z_1^8*z_3\",\n        \"z_1^4*z_2^3*z_3\",\n        \"z_1*z_2^7\",\n        \"z_1*z_2*z_3*z_4*z_5\",\n        \"z_2*z_3^4\",\n        \"z_4^3*z_5\",\n        \"z_5^3\"\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Verify quasi-homogeneity and find the polynomial's degree (d).\")\n    print(f\"Weights (w1, w2, w3, w4, w5) = {tuple(weights)}\")\n    \n    degrees = []\n    # Calculate the weighted degree for each term\n    for i, exponents in enumerate(terms_exponents):\n        degree = sum(e * w for e, w in zip(exponents, weights))\n        degrees.append(degree)\n        calculation_parts = [f\"{exp}*{w}\" for exp, w in zip(exponents, weights) if exp > 0]\n        calculation_str = \" + \".join(calculation_parts)\n        print(f\"Degree of term '{term_strings[i]}': {calculation_str} = {degree}\")\n\n    # Determine the polynomial's degree d\n    # Check if all degrees are the same\n    degree_counts = collections.Counter(degrees)\n    d, count = degree_counts.most_common(1)[0]\n    \n    if len(degree_counts) > 1:\n        print(f\"\\nWarning: The polynomial is not quasi-homogeneous as given.\")\n        print(f\"Most terms ({count}/{len(degrees)}) have a degree of {d}.
