# Plan:
# 1. State the core physical principle of the apparatus: It relies on the random motion of gas molecules to work.
# 2. Identify the physical parameter that represents this random motion. This is Temperature.
# 3. Use the formula for the average kinetic energy of a gas molecule to formally link motion and temperature. This will also satisfy the requirement to output numbers from an equation.
# 4. Consider the critical case: what happens if the temperature is absolute zero? Explain why the apparatus would fail.
# 5. Conclude that Temperature is the single required parameter from the list for the apparatus to function.
# 6. Print the final answer choice.
