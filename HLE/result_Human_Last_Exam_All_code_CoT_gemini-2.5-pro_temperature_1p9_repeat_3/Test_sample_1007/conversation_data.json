    "Of the ballet steps provided, we need to determine which one concludes in the exact same leg position it began in. This requires analyzing the mechanics of each movement.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the starting and ending positions for each ballet step.** I will treat \"position\" as not just the shape (e.g., fifth position) but also which foot is in front.\n2.  **Compare the starting position to the ending position** for each of the five options.\n3.  **Identify the step** where the start and end positions are identical.\n4.  **Create a Python script** that programmatically represents this logic, iterates through the options, and prints the analysis and the correct answer.\n\nHere is the analysis of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** An entrechat with an even number (two, four, six) lands on two feet in the same position it started from. For an entrechat six, the dancer starts in fifth position (e.g., right foot front), jumps, beats the legs three times in the air (back-front-back), and lands back in fifth position with the same foot in front (right foot front). Thus, the start and end positions are identical.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** The term \"changé\" (changed) is key. The step starts in a closed position (e.g., fifth with right foot front), opens to second position, and closes back to fifth with the *opposite* foot now in front (left foot front). The position has changed.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step means \"to assemble.\" Typically, a leg brushes from the back (in fifth position) to the side and then closes in the front in fifth position upon landing. This changes which foot is in front.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** This is a \"gliding step to the back.\" The dancer starts in fifth position, the front foot glides to the side, and the other foot closes *behind* it. This action reverses which foot is in front.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex decorative jump. While variations exist, a standard gargouillade involves movements that result in the feet changing their front/back placement upon landing in fifth position.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Entrechat six is the only step that starts and ends in the identical position.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ballet_steps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which has the same start and end position.\n    A position is defined by both the foot placement (e.g., fifth) and which foot is in front.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    steps_data = {\n        'A.
