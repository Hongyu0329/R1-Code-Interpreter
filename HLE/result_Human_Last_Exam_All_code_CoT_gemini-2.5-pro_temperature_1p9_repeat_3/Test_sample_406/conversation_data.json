    "An (F, G, H)-tripled fixed point refers to a point `(x, y, z)` that remains unchanged after the application of three distinct functions, F, G, and H, in a specific coupled manner. The existence and uniqueness of such a point can be guaranteed under certain conditions, which are a generalization of the famous Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n\nMy plan is to outline these conditions formally. I will provide a Python script that prints:\n1.  A precise definition of an (F, G, H)-tripled fixed point based on the function signatures you provided.\n2.  The set of conditions that guarantee the existence and uniqueness of such a point. These conditions involve assumptions about the underlying spaces (they must be complete metric spaces) and the functions themselves (they must satisfy a set of \"contraction\" inequalities).\n\nThe script will clearly present the mathematical definitions and the final equations with all their coefficients, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef explain_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the definition and conditions for the existence of\n    an (F,G,H)-tripled fixed point.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"\"\"\nAn (F, G, H)-tripled fixed point is a point (x, y, z) that satisfies a system of equations\ninvolving three functions F, G, and H. Here are the conditions for its existence and uniqueness,\nderived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem applied to a product space.\n\n**Definition: (F,G,H)-Tripled Fixed Point**\n\nLet X, Y, Z be non-empty sets and F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z be three functions.\nA point (x, y, z) from X × Y × Z is an (F, G, H)-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following system of equations:\n\n  1. F(x, y, z) = x\n  2. G(y, x, y) = y\n  3. H(z, y, x) = z\n\n**Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness**\n\nLet (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) be complete metric spaces. The system of equations above has\na unique (F, G, H)-tripled fixed point if the following conditions are met:\n\n1. The functions F, G, and H are contractive. This means there exist non-negative constants\n   k1, k2, k3, l1, l2, l3, m1, m2, m3 such that for all x, u in X, y, v in Y, and z, w in Z,\n   the following inequalities hold:\n\n   * For F:\n     d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) <= (k1 * d_X(x, u)) + (k2 * d_Y(y, v)) + (k3 * d_Z(z, w))\n\n   * For G:\n     d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) <= (l1 * d_Y(y, v)) + (l2 * d_X(x, u)) + (l3 * d_Y(y, v))\n\n   * For H:\n     d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) <= (m1 * d_Z(z, w)) + (m2 * d_Y(y, v)) + (m3 * d_X(x, u))\n\n2. The sum of these constants must satisfy a specific criterion to ensure the combined\n   mapping is a contraction on the product space X x Y x Z.\n\n   The final condition, which combines all the constants into one final equation, is that the\n   contraction coefficient for the overall system must be less than 1.\n   The final equation with each number (constant) is:\n\n   max((k1 + l2 + m3), (k2 + l1 + l3 + m2), (k3 + m1)) < 1\n\"\"\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    explain_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions()\n```\n<<<The conditions are that (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) must be complete metric spaces, and the functions F, G, and H must jointly satisfy a contraction mapping condition on the product space X×Y×Z, specifically that max((k1 + l2 + m3), (k2 + l1 + l3 + m2), (k3 + m1)) < 1.>>>"
