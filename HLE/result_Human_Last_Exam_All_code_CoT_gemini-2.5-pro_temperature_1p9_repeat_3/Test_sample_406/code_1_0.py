An (F, G, H)-tripled fixed point is a point (x, y, z) that satisfies a system of equations
involving three functions F, G, and H. Here are the conditions for its existence and uniqueness,
derived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem applied to a product space.

**Definition: (F,G,H)-Tripled Fixed Point**

Let X, Y, Z be non-empty sets and F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z be three functions.
A point (x, y, z) from X × Y × Z is an (F, G, H)-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following system of equations:

  1. F(x, y, z) = x
  2. G(y, x, y) = y
  3. H(z, y, x) = z

**Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness**

Let (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) be complete metric spaces. The system of equations above has
a unique (F, G, H)-tripled fixed point if the following conditions are met:

1. The functions F, G, and H are contractive. This means there exist non-negative constants
   k1, k2, k3, l1, l2, l3, m1, m2, m3 such that for all x, u in X, y, v in Y, and z, w in Z,
   the following inequalities hold:

   * For F:
     d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) <= (k1 * d_X(x, u)) + (k2 * d_Y(y, v)) + (k3 * d_Z(z, w))

   * For G:
     d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) <= (l1 * d_Y(y, v)) + (l2 * d_X(x, u)) + (l3 * d_Y(y, v))

   * For H:
     d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) <= (m1 * d_Z(z, w)) + (m2 * d_Y(y, v)) + (m3 * d_X(x, u))

2. The sum of these constants must satisfy a specific criterion to ensure the combined
   mapping is a contraction on the product space X x Y x Z.

   The final condition, which combines all the constants into one final equation, is that the
   contraction coefficient for the overall system must be less than 1.
   The final equation with each number (constant) is:

   max((k1 + l2 + m3), (k2 + l1 + l3 + m2), (k3 + m1)) < 1
