    Thinking Process:
    1. A 'bulk' experiment, like calorimetry or UV-Vis spectroscopy on a solution in a cuvette, measures the average behavior of all molecules in the sample.
    2. This averaging process is the key. If the molecules in the sample are not all identical or do not all behave identically, these differences are smoothed out in the final measurement.
    3. This phenomenon is called 'heterogeneity'. Examples in a DNA sample could include molecules with different end-fraying states, different local salt concentrations, or even sequence impurities.
    4. A bulk experiment cannot distinguish between a smooth, two-state transition of a perfectly homogeneous sample and the smeared-out average of many slightly different transitions from a heterogeneous sample. This is an inherent limitation.
    5. Let's review the other options:
        - A and B (zero heat capacity change, T-independent parameters) are simplifications of the *thermodynamic model* used to analyze the data, not fundamental limitations of the *experimental method* itself.
        - D and E (poor temperature control) are factually incorrect for modern, well-conducted calorimetric experiments.
    6. Therefore, the impossibility of capturing molecular heterogeneity is the fundamental limitation of the bulk experimental technique.
