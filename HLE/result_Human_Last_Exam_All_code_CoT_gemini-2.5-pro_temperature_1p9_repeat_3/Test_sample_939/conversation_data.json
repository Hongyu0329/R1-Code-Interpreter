    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to identify which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented in the sRGB color space. A color is \"out of gamut\" (cannot be represented) if, after converting from ROMM RGB to sRGB, any of its R, G, or B components fall outside the valid range of [0, 1].\n\n2.  **Color Space Conversion:** The conversion from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB requires a specific 3x3 transformation matrix. This matrix accounts for the differences in primary colors (the specific shades of red, green, and blue that define the space) and the white point (the color of white, which is D50 for ROMM and D65 for sRGB).\n\n3.  **The Matrix:** We will use a standard, pre-calculated matrix for converting from linear ROMM RGB (with a D50 white point) to linear sRGB (with a D65 white point). The matrix is:\n    ```\n    [[ 2.0413690, -0.5649464, -0.3446944],\n     [-0.9692660,  1.8760108,  0.0415560],\n     [ 0.0134474, -0.1183897,  1.0154096]]\n    ```\n\n4.  **Execution Plan:**\n    *   Create a Python script that uses the `numpy` library for efficient matrix and vector operations.\n    *   For each of the five given ROMM RGB colors:\n        a.  Represent the color as a vector.\n        b.  Multiply the conversion matrix by the color vector to get the new linear sRGB vector.\n        c.  Check if all three values in the resulting sRGB vector are between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive).\n        d.  If any value is outside this range, the color is out of gamut.\n    *   Keep track of the numbers of the colors that are out of gamut.\n    *   Finally, print these numbers in ascending order, separated by a comma and a space.\n\nThe following Python script will perform these calculations and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Matrix to convert from linear ROMM RGB (D50) to linear sRGB (D65)\n    # This matrix accounts for both primary rotation and chromatic adaptation.\n    PROPHOTO_TO_SRGB_MATRIX = np.array([\n        [ 2.0413690, -0.5649464, -0.3446944],\n        [-0.9692660,  1.8760108,  0.0415560],\n        [ 0.0134474, -0.1183897,  1.0154096]\n    ])\n\n    # List of ROMM RGB colors to test\n    colors = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1])\n    }\n\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors can be represented in sRGB...\\n\")\n\n    for i in sorted(colors.keys()):\n        romm_rgb = colors[i]\n        \n        # Convert ROMM RGB to linear sRGB\n        srgb_linear = PROPHOTO_TO_SRGB_MATRIX @ romm_rgb\n        \n        # Check if the converted sRGB values are in the gamut [0, 1]\n        is_in_gamut = np.all(srgb_linear >= 0) and np.all(srgb_linear <= 1)\n        \n        print(f\"Color {i}: ROMM RGB({romm_rgb[0]}, {romm_rgb[1]}, {romm_rgb[2]})\")\n        print(f\" -> Converted to sRGB({srgb_linear[0]:.4f}, {srgb_linear[1]:.4f}, {srgb_linear[2]:.4f})\")\n\n        if not is_in_gamut:\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(i)\n            print(\" -> Result: Cannot be represented (Out of sRGB gamut)\\n\")\n        else:\n            print(\" -> Result: Can be represented (In sRGB gamut)\\n\")\n\n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        answer = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        answer = \", \".join(map(str, sorted(out_of_gamut_indices)))\n        \n    print(f\"Final Answer: The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are:\")\n    print(answer)\n    print(f\"<<<{answer}>>>\")\n\nsolve()\n```"
