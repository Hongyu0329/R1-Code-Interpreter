    # Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the Soviet dissolution.
    # A map of countries is a planar graph. The Four-Color Theorem states its chromatic number is at most 4.
    # Due to its complexity, the chromatic number for the graph of Asian countries before 1991 was 4.
    chromatic_number_before = 4
    print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian sovereign nation state graph before the Soviet dissolution was {chromatic_number_before}.")

    # Step 2: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian country graph after the Soviet dissolution.
    # The dissolution created new countries and borders (e.g., Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, etc.),
    # but the resulting map is still a planar graph. Adding complexity does not reduce the chromatic number.
    chromatic_number_after = 4
    print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian sovereign nation state graph after the Soviet dissolution is {chromatic_number_after}.")

    # Step 3: Calculate delta_soviet, the incremental change in the chromatic number.
    delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
    print(f"The incremental change, delta_soviet, is calculated as: {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

    # Step 4: Determine beta, representing the change in planarity.
    # The graph of a country map is always planar. The dissolution of a country into smaller ones
    # results in a new planar graph. The property of planarity did not change.
    # Therefore, beta is 1.
    beta = 1
    print(f"The planarity of the graph did not change, so beta is {beta}.")

    # Step 5: Calculate the final answer.
    final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
    print(f"The final result is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
