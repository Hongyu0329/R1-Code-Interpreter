    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group**: The group in question is the semidihedral group, let's call it `G`. Its size (or order) is given as 512. The semidihedral group of order `2^n` is denoted as `SD_2^n`. We first need to determine the value of `n`.\n    *   `2^n = 512`\n    *   `n = log2(512) = 9`\n    So, we are dealing with the group `SD_2^9`.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups**: A subgroup `H` of `G` is called a power subgroup if there exists an integer `k` such that `H` is the set of all `k`-th powers of elements of `G`. This subgroup is denoted `G^k`. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n3.  **Analyze Power Subgroups of SD_2^n**: The structure of the power subgroups `G^k` of `SD_2^n` depends on whether the exponent `k` is odd or even.\n    *   **Case 1: `k` is odd.** For any odd `k`, the set `G^k` is the group `G` itself. This gives us one power subgroup.\n    *   **Case 2: `k` is even.** For any even `k`, the power subgroup `G^k` is always a cyclic subgroup of the maximal cyclic subgroup of `SD_2^n`. Specifically, if the group presentation is `<r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = e, srs = r^(2^(n-2)-1)>`, then for any even `k`, `G^k` is one of the subgroups generated by a power of `r`. The analysis shows that these power subgroups are precisely the set `{<r^2>, <r^4>, ..., <r^(2^(n-1))>}`.\n        *   The subgroup `<r^(2^(n-1))>` is just the trivial subgroup `{e}` (the identity element).\n        *   The number of these distinct cyclic subgroups generated by even `k` is `n-1`.\n\n4.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups**: By combining the results from both cases, the set of all distinct power subgroups of `SD_2^n` is:\n    *   `G` (from odd `k`)\n    *   `<r^2>`, `<r^4>`, ..., `<r^(2^(n-1))>` (from even `k`)\n    The total number of these subgroups is `1 + (n-1) = n`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: For our group `SD_512`, we found that `n = 9`. Therefore, the number of power subgroups is 9.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs the calculation and summarizes the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 512\n\n    # Step 1: Find the parameter 'n' for the semidihedral group SD_2^n.\n    # The order of SD_2^n is 2^n.\n    # 2^n = 512\n    n = int(math.log2(group_order))\n\n    # Step 2: Use the known result for the number of power subgroups of SD_2^n.\n    # For n >= 3, the number of power subgroups is n.\n    # The set of power subgroups consists of:\n    # 1. The group G itself (from k being odd).\n    # 2. n-1 cyclic subgroups (from k being even).\n    num_power_subgroups = n\n\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_order} is denoted as SD_{group_order} or SD_2^n.\")\n    print(f\"To find 'n', we solve the equation 2^n = {group_order}.\")\n    print(f\"n = log2({group_order}) = {n}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The number of distinct power subgroups in SD_2^n (for n>=3) is n.\")\n    print(\"This comes from two cases for the exponent k in G^k:\")\n    \n    count_from_odd_k = 1\n    print(f\"1. If k is odd, there is {count_from_odd_k} power subgroup, which is the group itself.\")\n    \n    count_from_even_k = n - 1\n    print(f\"2. If k is even, there are {count_from_even_k} distinct power subgroups.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"The total number of power subgroups is the sum from both cases.\")\n    print(f\"Total = (subgroups from odd k) + (subgroups from even k)\")\n    print(f\"Total = {count_from_odd_k} + {count_from_even_k} = {num_power_subgroups}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
