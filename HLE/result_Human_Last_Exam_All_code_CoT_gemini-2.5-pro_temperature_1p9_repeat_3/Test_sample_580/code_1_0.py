# The clinical vignette describes a scenario highly suggestive of piriformis syndrome.
# The piriformis muscle is a primary external rotator of the hip.
# When this muscle is inflamed or in spasm, it can compress the sciatic nerve, causing pain in the L4-S1 distribution (sciatica).
# A common provocative test for piriformis syndrome involves having the patient contract the muscle against resistance to see if it reproduces their pain.
# The patient is positioned on their left side (left decubitus) to test the right leg.
# To make the right piriformis muscle contract, the patient must perform its primary action.
# The primary action of the piriformis is external rotation of the hip.
# Therefore, applying resistance while the patient attempts to externally rotate their right leg is the maneuver that would confirm the diagnosis.

# Mapping actions to choices:
# A. Abduction
# B. Adduction
# C. Internal Rotation
# D. External Rotation
# E. Flexion
# F. Extension

# The correct action to test the piriformis via resisted contraction is External Rotation.

explanation = "The patient's symptoms (sciatica with a normal X-ray) point towards Piriformis Syndrome. The piriformis muscle's main function is the external rotation of the hip. A diagnostic physical exam maneuver involves resisting this action. If the patient's pain is reproduced upon resisted external rotation, it confirms the diagnosis by showing that the contracting piriformis muscle is compressing the sciatic nerve. The patient is placed in the left decubitus position to isolate and test the right hip muscles."
