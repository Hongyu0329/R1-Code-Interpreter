# A python script to calculate the total number of equivalence classes.

# Step 1: Determine the number of equivalence classes for each component space.
# A space is homogeneous if for any two points x, y, there exists a
# homeomorphism of the space that maps x to y. Homogeneous spaces have
# only one equivalence class.

# The torus is a homogeneous space. For instance, as a Lie group, it acts on
# itself by translation, which are homeomorphisms.
num_classes_torus = 1

# The sphere is a homogeneous space. The group of rotations SO(3) is a group
# of homeomorphisms that acts transitively on the sphere.
num_classes_sphere = 1

# The real line is a homogeneous space. The group of translations x -> x + a
# are homeomorphisms that act transitively.
num_classes_real_line = 1

# A discrete space with n points has the permutation group S_n as its
# group of homeomorphisms. This group acts transitively on the points.
# Thus, a three-point discrete space is homogeneous.
num_classes_3_point = 1

# Similarly, a five-point discrete space is homogeneous.
num_classes_5_point = 1

# Step 2: Sum the number of equivalence classes.
# The five component spaces are topologically distinct (based on properties like
# connectedness, compactness, and fundamental group). This means any
# auto-homeomorphism of the total space X must map each component to itself.
# Therefore, the total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the
# number of classes in each component.
total_classes = (num_classes_torus +
                 num_classes_sphere +
                 num_classes_real_line +
                 num_classes_3_point +
                 num_classes_5_point)

# Step 3: Print the result.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
print("The total number of equivalence classes is the sum from each component space:")
print(f"{num_classes_torus} (from Torus) + "
      f"{num_classes_sphere} (from Sphere) + "
      f"{num_classes_real_line} (from Real Line) + "
      f"{num_classes_3_point} (from 3-Point Space) + "
      f"{num_classes_5_point} (from 5-Point Space) = "
      f"{total_classes}")

# The final answer in a simplified equation form
print("\nFinal Equation:")
print(f"{num_classes_torus} + {num_classes_sphere} + {num_classes_real_line} + {num_classes_3_point} + {num_classes_5_point} = {total_classes}")
