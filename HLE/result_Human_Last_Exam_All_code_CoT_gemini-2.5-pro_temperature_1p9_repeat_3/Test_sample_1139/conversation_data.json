    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimension of the bosonic sector of the relevant supersymmetric sigma-model manifold. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the appropriate supersymmetric manifold:** For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the supersymmetric sigma-model for `n` replicas is formulated on the symmetric superspace `M = O(2n|2n) / (O(n|n) x O(n|n))`.\n\n2.  **Determine the bosonic submanifold:** The non-Grassman (bosonic) variables parametrize the bosonic part of this superspace, `M_B`. This is found by taking the quotient of the maximal bosonic subgroups of the supergroups involved.\n    *   The bosonic subgroup of the supergroup `O(p|q)` is `O(p) x O(q)`.\n    *   Therefore, the bosonic submanifold for `M` is `M_B = (O(2n) x O(2n)) / ((O(n) x O(n)) x (O(n) x O(n)))`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the dimension of the bosonic submanifold:** The number of bosonic variables is the dimension of `M_B`. The dimension of a quotient space `G/H` is given by `dim(G) - dim(H)`.\n    *   The dimension of the orthogonal group `O(k)` is `k * (k - 1) / 2`.\n    *   The dimension of the numerator group `O(2n) x O(2n)` is `2 * dim(O(2n))`.\n    *   The dimension of the denominator group `(O(n) x O(n)) x (O(n) x O(n))` is `4 * dim(O(n))`.\n    *   The total dimension is `2 * dim(O(2n)) - 4 * dim(O(n))`.\n\n4.  **Substitute the given number of replicas:** We are given `n = 2`. We will plug this value into our dimension formula and calculate the result using a Python script. The script will show each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef dim_O(k):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the dimension of the orthogonal group O(k).\"\"\"\n  if k < 0:\n    return 0\n  return k * (k - 1) // 2\n\n# Number of replicas\nn = 2\n\n# Calculate the dimensions of the component groups O(2n) and O(n)\ndim_O_2n = dim_O(2 * n)\ndim_O_n = dim_O(n)\n\n# Calculate the dimension of the numerator and denominator bosonic subgroups\ndim_numerator = 2 * dim_O_2n\ndim_denominator = 4 * dim_O_n\n\n# Calculate the final result\nnum_variables = dim_numerator - dim_denominator\n\n# Print the calculation steps as an equation\nprint(\"The number of non-Grassman variables is the dimension of the bosonic manifold M_B.\")\nprint(\"dim(M_B) = dim(O(2n) x O(2n)) - dim((O(n) x O(n)) x (O(n) x O(n)))\")\nprint(f\"For n = {n}:\")\nprint(f\"dim(M_B) = (2 * dim(O({2*n}))) - (4 * dim(O({n})))\")\nprint(f\"           = (2 * {dim_O_2n}) - (4 * {dim_O_n})\")\nprint(f\"           = {dim_numerator} - {dim_denominator}\")\nprint(f\"           = {num_variables}\")\n\n```\n<<<8>>>"
