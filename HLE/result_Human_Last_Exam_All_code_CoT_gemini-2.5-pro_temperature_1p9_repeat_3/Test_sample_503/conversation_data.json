    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ (viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$) from an object $[n]$ to an object $[m]$ is equivalent to a pair of order-preserving maps $(f, g)$, where $f: [n] \\to [m]$ and $g: [m] \\to [n]$, such that $f$ is the left adjoint to $g$ ($f \\dashv g$). The objects $[n]$ and $[m]$ are the totally ordered sets $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ and $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$ respectively.\n\nThe condition for $f \\dashv g$ to be an adjunction between these posets is that for all $i \\in [n]$ and $j \\in [m]$, the relation $f(i) \\le j$ is equivalent to $i \\le g(j)$.\n\nAn order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a left adjoint if and only if it has a right adjoint $g$. This is the case if and only if $f$ preserves all existing joins (suprema). In the context of the poset $[n]$, which is a complete lattice, this condition is equivalent to a more straightforward property. Specifically, a map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ gives rise to a well-defined right adjoint $g(j) = \\max\\{i \\in [n] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$ if and only if the set $\\{i \\in [n] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$ is non-empty for all $j \\in [m]$.\nThis is satisfied if there is an element $i_0 \\in [n]$ such that $f(i_0) = 0$, because then for any $j \\ge 0$, we have $f(i_0) \\le j$, guaranteeing the set is non-empty. Since $f$ is order-preserving, if any $f(i_0)=0$, then $f(0)=0$. Conversely, if $f(0)=0$, the condition holds. Thus, an order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: [n] \\to [m]$ such that $f(0) = 0$.\nAn order-preserving map is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values. We need to count the number of sequences:\n$f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(n)$\nsuch that\n$0 \\le f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(n) \\le m$.\nWith the condition $f(0)=0$, we are looking for non-decreasing sequences:\n$0 \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(n) \\le m$.\n\nThis is a classic stars and bars problem. We are choosing $n$ values for $f(1), \\dots, f(n)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$, which has $m+1$ elements, with replacement, and the order of selection does not matter as the values will be sorted into a non-decreasing sequence. The number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{k+N-1}{N} $$\nwhere $N=n=23$ is the number of items to choose, and $k=m+1=38$ is the number of categories to choose from.\nThe number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{n + (m+1) - 1}{n} = \\binom{n+m}{n} $$\nFor this specific problem, we have $n=23$ and $m=37$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n$$ \\binom{23+37}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the parameters of the problem\nn = 23\nm = 37\n\n# An internal adjunction from [n] to [m] corresponds to an order-preserving\n# map f: [n] -> [m] such that f(0) = 0.\n# The number of such maps is given by the combination formula C(n+m, n).\ntotal = n + m\nk = n\n\n# Calculate the binomial coefficient C(total, k)\nnum_adjunctions = math.comb(total, k)\n\n# The final equation's numbers are n, m, total, k.\n# Print the explanation and the result.\nprint(f\"The number of internal adjunctions from [{n}] to [{m}] is given by the binomial coefficient C({n} + {m}, {n}).\")\nprint(f\"This is equal to C({total}, {k}).\")\nprint(f\"C({total}, {k}) = {num_adjunctions}\")\n\n```\n<<<3944116538133333400>>>"
