    "The user wants to determine the product of a specific Wittig reaction. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants**: The reaction is between `pivalaldehyde` and `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane`.\n    *   **Pivalaldehyde**: An aldehyde with a tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl. Its structure is `(CH₃)₃C-CHO`.\n    *   **Ylide**: `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane`. This is a phosphonium ylide. The structure is `(2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=P(C₆H₅)₃`. The reactive part is the `C=P` double bond.\n\n2.  **Understand the Reaction**: The Wittig reaction forms a new carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`). It replaces the `C=O` bond of the aldehyde and the `C=P` bond of the ylide. The oxygen from the aldehyde combines with the phosphorus from the ylide to form a stable byproduct, triphenylphosphine oxide (`O=P(C₆H₅)₃`).\n\n3.  **Construct the Product**:\n    *   The pivalaldehyde contributes the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` fragment.\n    *   The ylide contributes the `=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)` fragment.\n    *   Combining these fragments at the double bond gives the final structure: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-Cl-C₆H₄)`.\n\n4.  **Characterize the Product**:\n    *   **IUPAC Name**: Following the naming rules, the longest carbon chain containing the double bond is identified and numbered. The product is named `1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene`.\n    *   **Chemical Formula**: By counting the atoms (13 Carbon, 17 Hydrogen, 1 Chlorine), the formula is `C₁₃H₁₇Cl`.\n    *   **SMILES**: A standard chemical representation for the structure is `CC(C)(C)C=CHCH2c1c(Cl)cccc1`.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Code**: A Python script will be created to present the full chemical equation, including the stoichiometric coefficients (all are 1), and to detail the properties of the main organic product.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step 1: Define the reactants and products of the Wittig reaction.\n# Reactants\nreactant_aldehyde = {\n    \"name\": \"Pivalaldehyde\",\n    \"formula\": \"C5H10O\"\n}\nreactant_ylide = {\n    \"name\": \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\",\n    \"formula\": \"C26H22ClP\"\n}\n\n# Products\n# The main organic product is an alkene.\nproduct_alkene = {\n    \"name\": \"1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\",\n    \"formula\": \"C13H17Cl\",\n    \"smiles\": \"CC(C)(C)C=CHCH2c1c(Cl)cccc1\"\n}\n# The byproduct is triphenylphosphine oxide.\nproduct_byproduct = {\n    \"name\": \"Triphenylphosphine oxide\",\n    \"formula\": \"C18H15OP\"\n}\n\n# The stoichiometric coefficients are all 1 for this reaction.\nstoichiometry = collections.defaultdict(lambda: 1)\n\n# Step 2: Display the balanced chemical equation.\n# The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation,\n# which refers to the stoichiometric coefficients.\nprint(\"--- Wittig Reaction Equation ---\\n\")\nequation = (\n    f\"{stoichiometry['aldehyde']} {reactant_aldehyde['name']} + \"\n    f\"{stoichiometry['ylide']} {reactant_ylide['name']} -> \"\n    f\"{stoichiometry['alkene']} {product_alkene['name']} + \"\n    f\"{stoichiometry['byproduct']} {product_byproduct['name']}\"\n)\nprint(equation)\n\n# Step 3: Provide details about the main organic product.\nprint(\"\\n--- Main Organic Product Details ---\\n\")\nprint(f\"Product Name: {product_alkene['name']}\")\nprint(f\"Chemical Formula: {product_alkene['formula']}\")\nprint(f\"SMILES String: {product_alkene['smiles']}\")\n```\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
