        'A': "A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2: The ribosome's physical presence blocking region 2 is the key event in high tryptophan, not the formation of a 1-2 stem loop. This mutation would likely have no effect on termination.",
        'B': "A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3: If region 2 cannot bind to region 3, the 2-3 anti-terminator loop can never form. This means region 3 will always be available to form the 3-4 terminator loop, causing termination even in LOW tryptophan. This is the opposite of the desired effect.",
        'C': "A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence: The 3-4 terminator stem-loop is part of a rho-independent terminator, which requires both the hairpin and the downstream U-rich sequence. The U-rich sequence creates weak RNA-DNA bonds that help release the RNA polymerase. Changing this to a G-C rich sequence would create very strong bonds, preventing the polymerase from dissociating even when it pauses at the 3-4 hairpin. This would prevent termination and lead to continued transcription.",
        'D': "A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide: Attenuation is controlled by the *rate* of translation, not the total amount of peptide. More ribosomes moving quickly across the leader sequence would still allow the 3-4 terminator to form and cause termination.",
        'E': "A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase: This would reduce the overall rate of transcription initiation for the entire operon, regardless of tryptophan levels. It doesn't specifically prevent termination."
