    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat using the epsilon expansion, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Upper Critical Dimension (d_c):** For systems like the Ising, XY, or Heisenberg models, the upper critical dimension, above which mean-field theory is valid, is `d_c = 4`.\n2.  **Define Epsilon (ϵ):** The epsilon expansion is a perturbative method that calculates critical exponents as a power series in the small parameter `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **State the Formula for α:** The first-order epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent α in a model with an `n`-component order parameter is given by the formula:\n    α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\n4.  **Assume the Model:** Since the model is not specified, we will use the most common case, the Ising model, where the order parameter is a scalar. This corresponds to `n = 1`.\n5.  **Calculate:** We will substitute the values `d = 3`, `d_c = 4`, and `n = 1` into the formulas to calculate `ϵ` and then `α`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print out each step.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the variables\nn = sympy.Integer(1)  # Number of components of the order parameter (n=1 for Ising model)\nd = sympy.Integer(3)  # Spatial dimension\nd_c = sympy.Integer(4)  # Upper critical dimension\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate epsilon ---\nprint(f\"The epsilon parameter (ϵ) is defined as d_c - d.\")\nepsilon = d_c - d\nprint(f\"ϵ = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the scaling exponent alpha (α) ---\nprint(f\"The first-order epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent α is:\")\nprint(f\"α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\nprint(f\"Substituting the values n = {n}, and ϵ = {epsilon}:\")\n\n# Perform the calculation using symbolic math for a precise fraction\nnumerator = 4 - n\ndenominator = 2 * (n + 8)\nalpha_expr = sympy.Rational(numerator, denominator) * epsilon\nalpha_decimal = float(alpha_expr)\n\n# Print the full equation with numbers\nprint(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / ({2} * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α = {numerator} / ({2} * {n + 8}) * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\nprint(f\"α = {alpha_expr}\")\nprint(f\"α ≈ {alpha_decimal:.4f}\")\n\nfinal_answer = alpha_expr\n```\n<<<1/6>>>"
