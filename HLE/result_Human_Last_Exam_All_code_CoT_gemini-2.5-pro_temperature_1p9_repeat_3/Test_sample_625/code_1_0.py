# Plan:
# 1. Identify which pieces of information from the list are essential for a standard 13C MFA.
# 2. These essential pieces are: the metabolic network map (stoichiometry), the metabolic outputs for growth (biomass composition), and the core experimental data (isotope labeling patterns).
# 3. Create a list of the numbers corresponding to these essential items.
# 4. Calculate the total count of these items.
# 5. Print the reasoning and the final calculation clearly.

# List of numbers for the required information
required_items_indices = [1, 3, 6]

# Total number of required items
count = len(required_items_indices)

# Construct the equation string
# Since we know the count is 3, the equation is always 1 + 1 + 1
equation_string = " + ".join(["1"] * count)

print("The following pieces of information from the list are required for 13C-MFA at steady state:")
print(f"Item {required_items_indices[0]}: Metabolic reaction stoichiometry")
print(f"Item {required_items_indices[1]}: Biomass composition of the organism")
print(f"Item {required_items_indices[2]}: Isotope labeling patterns of metabolic intermediates")
print("\nTherefore, the total number of required items is:")
# Output the final equation
print(f"{equation_string} = {count}")
