# Explain the role of LIG1
role_of_LIG1 = "LIG1 is a DNA ligase essential for joining DNA fragments (Okazaki fragments) during replication and in DNA repair pathways. It seals the final nick in the DNA backbone."

# Explain the mechanism of instability in DM1
instability_mechanism = f"In {disease_context}, the {genetic_feature} can form hairpin structures during DNA replication. The processing of these hairpins by replication and repair machinery leads to an increase in the number of repeats ({observed_phenomenon})."

# Logically connect LIG1 to the mechanism
connection = f"For the expanded repeat to be permanently incorporated into the genome, the newly synthesized DNA strand must be ligated. This is a key function of {gene_of_interest}."

# Determine the impact of LIG1 knockout
impact_of_knockout = f"Therefore, if {gene_of_interest} is knocked out or its function is reduced, the final ligation step of the expansion pathway is inhibited."

# State the final conclusion
conclusion = "This inhibition of a critical step disrupts the entire expansion process, leading to a significant decrease in the rate of repeat expansion."
