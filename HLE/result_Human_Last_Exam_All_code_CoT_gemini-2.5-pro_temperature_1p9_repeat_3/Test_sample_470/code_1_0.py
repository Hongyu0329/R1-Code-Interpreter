    Solves the given problem in block theory.

    Let F be a large enough field with characteristic 2, let G be a finite group,
    let D=(C_2)^5 and let B be a block of FG with defect group D.
    Given that the inertial quotient of B has order 5, compute the value of k(B)-l(B).

    # l(B) is the number of irreducible Brauer characters.
    # This equals the number of irreducible representations of the inertial quotient E
    # over the field F. Since char(F) = 2 does not divide |E| = 5, and F is a
    # splitting field, this number is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of E.

    # conjugacy classes.

    # --- Step 2: Calculate k(B) ---
    # For a block with an abelian defect group D, k(B) is the number of E-orbits
    # on the set of irreducible characters of D, Irr(D).
    # We use Burnside's Orbit-Counting Lemma:
    # Number of orbits = (1/|E|) * sum_{g in E} |fix(g)|

    # For any non-identity element g in E, we determined the number of fixed points.
    # The action on D (a 5-dim vector space over F_2) must decompose into
    # a 1-dim trivial and a 4-dim irreducible submodule. The fixed-point subspace
    # has dimension 1, so it contains 2^1 = 2 elements.
    num_fixed_by_non_id = 2**1

    # Number of non-identity elements in E is |E| - 1.
