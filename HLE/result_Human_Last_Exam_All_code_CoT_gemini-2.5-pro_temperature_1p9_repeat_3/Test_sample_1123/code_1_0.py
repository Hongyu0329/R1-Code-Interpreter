    Step 1: The photosensitizer (thioxanthenone) absorbs 417 nm light.
    Step 2: The excited photosensitizer abstracts a hydrogen atom from the -OH group of the phenol on Probe 1.
    Step 3: This H-atom abstraction creates a highly reactive 'phenoxyl radical'.
    Step 4: This phenoxyl radical, being short-lived, rapidly reacts with a nearby protein, covalently labeling it.
    Step 5: The benzyl alcohol on Probe 2 is much less reactive in this H-atom abstraction step, so very little radical is formed.
