    "Of course. Here is the formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will start with the definition of the partition function `Z` as a functional integral over anti-commuting Grassmann fields (`ψ` and `ψ̄`).\n2.  I will define the Euclidean action `S` that appears in the exponent of the integrand.\n3.  The action `S` will be expressed as an integral of the Lagrangian density `L` over imaginary time `τ` and space.\n4.  I will provide a common form for the Lagrangian density `L` for a non-interacting system.\n5.  Finally, I will state the crucial anti-periodic boundary conditions that the fermionic fields must satisfy in the imaginary time dimension.\n\nI will print each part of the formula with explanations using Python code.\n\n```python\ndef print_fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the components of the formula for the fermionic\n    partition function in the path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism is:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    # 1.
