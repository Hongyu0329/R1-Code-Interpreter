    "My plan is to find all the minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot and then count how many unique diagrams exist after accounting for translational and rotational symmetries.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Define a Grid Diagram:** A grid diagram on an n x n grid can be represented by two permutations, `p_x` and `p_o`, of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`. `p_x[r] = c` means there is an 'X' marker at row `r`, column `c`. `p_o[r] = c` means there is an 'O' marker at row `r`, column `c`.\n\n2.  **Minimal Grid Number:** For a trefoil knot, the minimal grid number `n` is 3.\n\n3.  **Identify Left-Hand Trefoils:** A key result in knot theory states that the knot type of a grid diagram `(p_x, p_o)` is determined by the permutation `p = p_o * p_x^{-1}` (where `*` denotes permutation composition). For `n=3`:\n    *   If `p` is a 3-cycle of the form `(0 2 1)` (represented by the permutation `(2, 0, 1)`), the diagram is a **left-hand trefoil**.\n    *   If `p` is a 3-cycle of the form `(0 1 2)` (represented by `(1, 2, 0)`), it's a right-hand trefoil.\n    *   Otherwise, it's an unknot.\n\n4.  **Generate All Left-Hand Trefoil Diagrams:** I will generate all possible permutations `p_x` for the 'X' markers. For each `p_x`, I will calculate the corresponding `p_o` that makes the diagram a left-hand trefoil using the formula `p_o = p * p_x`, with `p = (2, 0, 1)`. This will give me a complete list of all `3! = 6` minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil.\n\n5.  **Define Symmetries:** The problem asks to count diagrams up to translation and rotation. I will implement functions that apply these geometric transformations to the `(p_x, p_o)` representation.\n    *   **Translation:** Shifting the grid by `dr` rows and `dc` columns.\n    *   **Rotation:** Rotating the grid by 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees.\n\n6.  **Find Equivalence Classes:** To count the unique diagrams, I'll group them into equivalence classes. Two diagrams are in the same class if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of rotations and translations. An efficient way to do this is to define a \"canonical representative\" for each class. For any given diagram, I'll generate all its symmetric versions and choose the lexicographically smallest `(p_x, p_o)` pair as the canonical form.\n\n7.  **Count the Classes:** I will iterate through my list of 6 left-hand trefoil diagrams, compute the canonical form for each, and count the number of unique canonical forms. This final count will be the answer.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef inverse_perm(p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the inverse of a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inv = [0] * len(p)\n    for i, val in enumerate(p):\n        inv[val] = i\n    return tuple(inv)\n\ndef compose_perms(p2, p1):\n    \"\"\"Computes the composition of two permutations (p2 o p1).\"\"\"\n    return tuple(p2[p1[i]] for i in range(len(p1)))\n\ndef get_initial_left_trefoils(n):\n    \"\"\"Generates all minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil.\"\"\"\n    all_perms_x = list(itertools.permutations(range(n)))\n    left_trefoil_p = (2, 0, 1) # This corresponds to the (0 2 1) cycle for n=3\n    \n    left_trefoil_diagrams = []\n    for p_x in all_perms_x:\n        # We need p_o * p_x^-1 = left_trefoil_p  =>  p_o = left_trefoil_p * p_x\n        p_o = compose_perms(left_trefoil_p, p_x)\n        left_trefoil_diagrams.append((p_x, p_o))\n        \n    return left_trefoil_diagrams\n\ndef apply_translation(p_x, p_o, dr, dc):\n    \"\"\"Applies a translation to the grid diagram.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p_x)\n    p_x_new = [0] * n\n    p_o_new = [0] * n\n    for r_old in range(n):\n        r_new = (r_old + dr) % n\n        p_x_new[r_new] = (p_x[r_old] + dc) % n\n        p_o_new[r_new] = (p_o[r_old] + dc) % n\n    return (tuple(p_x_new), tuple(p_o_new))\n\ndef apply_rotation(p_x, p_o, deg):\n    \"\"\"Applies a rotation to the grid diagram.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p_x)\n    if deg == 0:\n        return (p_x, p_o)\n\n    if deg == 90:\n        p_x_inv = inverse_perm(p_x)\n        p_o_inv = inverse_perm(p_o)\n        new_p_x = tuple(n - 1 - p_x_inv[c] for c in range(n))\n        new_p_o = tuple(n - 1 - p_o_inv[c] for c in range(n))\n        return new_p_x, new_p_o\n        \n    # Other rotations can be composed of 90-degree rotations\n    if deg == 180:\n        p_x90, p_o90 = apply_rotation(p_x, p_o, 90)\n        return apply_rotation(p_x90, p_o90, 90)\n    if deg == 270:\n        p_x180, p_o180 = apply_rotation(p_x, p_o, 180)\n        return apply_rotation(p_x180, p_o180, 90)\n        \ndef get_canonical_form(diagram):\n    \"\"\"Finds the canonical representative of a diagram's equivalence class.\"\"\"\n    n = len(diagram[0])\n    p_x, p_o = diagram\n    \n    # Generate all symmetric versions of the diagram\n    symmetries = set()\n    for deg in [0, 90, 180, 270]:\n        rot_p_x, rot_p_o = apply_rotation(p_x, p_o, deg)\n        for dr in range(n):\n            for dc in range(n):\n                symmetries.add(apply_translation(rot_p_x, rot_p_o, dr, dc))\n    \n    # The canonical form is the lexicographically smallest diagram in the class\n    return min(symmetries)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of distinct minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand\n    trefoil knot up to translation and rotation.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    \n    # 1.
