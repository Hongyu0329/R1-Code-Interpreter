    "Kurt Vonnegut wrote about many historical figures, often with vivid descriptions. While he famously described the abolitionist John Brown as a \"porcupine,\" that name does not fit the alliterative constraint of your question.\n\nA more likely answer that fits all the criteria is a man Vonnegut mentioned in his novel *Slapstick*.

His two-word name starts with the same letter.\n\n<<<Howard Hughes>>>"
