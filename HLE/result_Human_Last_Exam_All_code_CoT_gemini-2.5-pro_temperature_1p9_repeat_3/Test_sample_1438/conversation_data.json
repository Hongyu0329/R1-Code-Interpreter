    "To answer this question, we will delve into the properties of Grassmann variables, which are essential for representing fermions in the path integral formalism. The Pauli exclusion principle is naturally encoded in the algebraic properties of these variables. The \"value\" of the integration measure is established by a standard normalization convention.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  First, I will explain that fermionic systems are described using special anticommuting numbers called Grassmann variables. The anticommutation property is the key to enforcing the Pauli exclusion principle.\n2.  Next, I will introduce the rules of integration for these variables, known as Berezin integration.\n3.  The \"value\" or normalization of the integral measure is not a constant in the usual sense but is defined by a conventional rule. I will present the fundamental equation that defines this normalization.\n4.  Finally, the Python code will print out this explanation, display the defining equation, and explicitly output the numerical value involved in that equation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef explain_fermionic_measure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the concept of the integration measure for Grassmann variables\n    in the context of fermionic path integrals.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the Pauli exclusion principle is mathematically encoded using anticommuting numbers called Grassmann variables (e.g., η).\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Key Property ---\")\n    print(\"The defining algebraic rule for Grassmann variables is that they anticommute: η_i * η_j = -η_j * η_i.\")\n    print(\"A direct consequence of this is that the square of any Grassmann variable is zero: η^2 = 0.\")\n    print(\"This property, η^2 = 0, directly mirrors the Pauli exclusion principle: you cannot have two identical fermions in the same quantum state.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Integration and the Measure ---\")\n    print(\"Integration over Grassmann variables (Berezin integration) is defined by a set of linear rules.
