    """
    This function provides the solution to the three-part puzzle.
    Part A: The Sherlock Holmes allusion is to "The Priory School," where a horse's tracks were faked to look like a cow's. So the answer is 6.
    Part C: Nabokov's most intense work of "intricate back-referencing" was his translation and commentary on "Eugene Onegin." So the answer is 7.
    Part B: The numbers must add up to a multiple of 8. With A=6 and C=7, the sum is 13 + B. For the total to be 16 (a multiple of 8), B must be 3. The theme "education vs mis-education" (3) fits perfectly, as the allusion to deception mirrors Kinbote's misleading commentary.
