    "To determine the worst suited jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game, we need to consult a Game Theory Optimal (GTO) preflop chart for this specific scenario.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The situation is a 100BB deep, rake-free No-Limit Hold'em cash game. We are in the most advantageous position, the button (BTN), and are the first to enter the pot (making an \"open-raise\").\n2.  **Understand the Action:** An open-raise to 2.5x the big blind is a standard size from this position. The rake-free environment encourages playing a slightly wider range of hands compared to a raked game, as even small pots are more profitable.\n3.  **Consult GTO Strategy:** GTO solvers have determined optimal preflop ranges. From the button, the opening range is very wide (typically around 45-50% of hands) because of the positional advantage. This range includes all suited Jack-X hands (JAs, JKs, JQs, ..., J3s, J2s).\n4.  **Identify the \"Worst\" Hand:** The \"worst\" hand in a category that is still recommended to be played is the one with the lowest raw equity or playability. Within the suited Jack-X hands, the strength is determined by the kicker. J2s (Jack-Two suited) is the weakest hand in this group. Since all suited Jacks are considered a standard open-raise in this scenario, J2s is the correct answer as it's the least profitable hand of that specific group that is still a clear open.\n\nThe following Python script will define and print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the worst suited Jack to open from the button in a 100BB rake-free cash game based on standard GTO charts.\n\n    In GTO (Game Theory Optimal) poker strategy for a 100BB, rake-free game,\n    the button's opening range is very wide. This range includes all suited Jack-X combinations,\n    from JAs down to J2s.\n\n    The \"worst\" hand in this context is the one with the lowest kicker that is still\n    considered a profitable, standard open-raise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The suited Jack hands, in descending order of strength, are:\n    # JAs, JKs, JQs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n    # The worst among these that is still a standard open is J2s.\n    worst_suited_jack = \"J2s\"\n\n    print(f\"Based on GTO preflop charts for a 100BB rake-free cash game, the worst suited jack you should open from the button is: {worst_suited_jack}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_worst_suited_jack_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
