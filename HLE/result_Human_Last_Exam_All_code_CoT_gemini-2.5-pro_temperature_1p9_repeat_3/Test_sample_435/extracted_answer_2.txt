Based on the evidence that interleukin-15 promotes the generation of a less-differentiated, more persistent memory T cell phenotype, one would predict that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit an **increase** in cytokine release (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α) upon antigen stimulation compared to T cells manufactured without it. The enhanced survival and proliferative capacity of these IL-15-cultured cells would lead to a more robust and sustained effector response.
