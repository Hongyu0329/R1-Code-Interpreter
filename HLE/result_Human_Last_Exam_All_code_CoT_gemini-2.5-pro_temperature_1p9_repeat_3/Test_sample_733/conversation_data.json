    "This is a problem from combinatorial group theory. To solve it, we first need to understand the definitions.\n\n*   A **product-free set** `S` in a group `G` is a subset where the product of any two elements in `S` (including an element with itself) is never in `S`.\n*   A product-free set is **maximal by inclusion** if it cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group without losing the product-free property.\n\nThe question asks for the number of distinct (non-isomorphic) finite groups that have a maximal product-free set containing exactly two elements.\n\nThis specific question was answered in a 1969 paper by P.H. Diananda and H.P. Yap. Their theorem provides a complete list of all such groups. Deriving this from first principles is a complex mathematical task, so we rely on this established result.\n\nThe groups are:\n1.  Five cyclic groups: `Z_4, Z_5, Z_6, Z_7, Z_9`\n2.  Two direct product groups: `Z_2 x Z_2` and `Z_3 x Z_3`\n3.  The symmetric group on 3 elements: `S_3`\n4.  The quaternion group: `Q_8`\n\nThere are a total of 9 such groups.\n\nThe following Python code lists these groups and calculates the total number, displaying the result as a sum as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_theory_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the user's question by referencing a known theorem\n    in group theory and presenting the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to a theorem by Diananda and Yap (1969), the finite groups\n    # containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are known.\n    # The following is the complete list of these non-isomorphic groups.\n    groups = [\n        \"Z_4 (cyclic group of order 4)\",\n        \"Z_5 (cyclic group of order 5)\",\n        \"Z_6 (cyclic group of order 6)\",\n        \"Z_7 (cyclic group of order 7)\",\n        \"Z_9 (cyclic group of order 9)\",\n        \"Z_2 x Z_2 (Klein four-group)\",\n        \"Z_3 x Z_3 (direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3)\",\n        \"S_3 (symmetric group of order 6)\",\n        \"Q_8 (quaternion group of order 8)\"\n    ]\n\n    print(\"The finite groups containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 are:\")\n    for group in groups:\n        print(f\"- {group}\")\n\n    # Calculate the total count\n    count = len(groups)\n    \n    # Create the equation string: 1 + 1 + ... + 1 = count\n    sum_parts = [\"1\"] * count\n    equation = \" + \".join(sum_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nIn total, there are {count} such groups.\")\n    print(\"The final count is derived from this list:\")\n    print(f\"{equation} = {count}\")\n\nsolve_group_theory_question()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
