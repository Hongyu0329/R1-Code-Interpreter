def solve_log_blowup_dimension():
    """
    Calculates the dimension of the log blowup of a point P.

    The problem is translated into a standard algebraic geometry calculation.
    1. The log point P with log structure N^3 is interpreted as the origin
       of the 3D affine space, A^3. The dimension of this ambient space is n.
    2. The log ideal I generated by (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) corresponds to the
       algebraic ideal (x,y), which defines the z-axis in A^3. This is the
       center of the blowup, and its dimension is d.
    3. The "log blowup of P" refers to the fiber over the point P in the
       blowup of A^3 along the z-axis.
    4. The dimension of this fiber is given by the formula: dim = n - d - 1.
