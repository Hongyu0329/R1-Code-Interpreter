    "To determine the number of depressions the lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains, we need to consult the scientific literature that describes its anatomy. This is not a value that can be calculated, but rather a fact that must be retrieved from paleontological research.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will consult the primary scientific paper describing the skull of *Irritator challengeri*. The key reference is the 2002 paper by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott.\n2.  I will extract the specific description of the lacrimal bone from this paper. The paper notes that the large lacrimal recess (a depression itself) contains smaller, accessory openings within it.\n3.  The question asks what the recess *contains*, so I will count these internal openings. According to the description, there are two such openings.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this number in a variable and prints the answer in the requested equation format.\n\n```python\n# This script presents a known anatomical fact about the dinosaur Irritator challengeri.\n# The information is based on the scientific paper: Sues et al. (2002), \"On the skull of Irritator challengeri\".\n\n# According to the scientific literature, the large depression on the lacrimal bone,\n# known as the lacrimal recess, contains a specific number of smaller, accessory openings.\nnumber_of_depressions_in_recess = 2\n\n# Print the result as a descriptive equation, including the final number.\nprint(f\"Number of depressions contained in the lacrimal recess = {number_of_depressions_in_recess}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
