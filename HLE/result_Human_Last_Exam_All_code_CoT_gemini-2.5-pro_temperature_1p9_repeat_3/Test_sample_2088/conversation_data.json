    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will simplify the expression inside the main parentheses. This involves combining the two integrals, $\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$ and $\\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$, which have the same limits and denominator.\n2.  After combining them, I'll perform a substitution $u=1-x$ to simplify the resulting integrand. This will make the expression easier to work with.\n3.  The crucial step is to recognize that the new integrand is the derivative of a specific function, up to a constant factor. I will find this function, which is the antiderivative of the integrand. This allows me to use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to solve the definite integral.\n4.  I will identify that the antiderivative has the form $F(x) = C \\cdot x^2(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$ for some constant C.\n5.  I'll evaluate the definite integral, which I'll call $I$, using this antiderivative over the limits from 0 to 1.\n6.  Finally, I will substitute the calculated value of the integral $I$ back into the original expression $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$ to compute the final numerical result.\n7.  I will use a Python script to lay out these calculation steps and print the final answer and the equation leading to it.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step analytical solution to the given mathematical expression\n    and prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The problem is to compute the value of the expression:\")\n    print(\"(12)^4 * (I_1 - I_2)^4\")\n    print(\"where I_1 and I_2 are the two given integrals.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Combine the two integrals.\")\n    print(\"Let I = I_1 - I_2.
