    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry to count the number of chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the core structure**: The central part of the molecule is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring.\n2.  **Evaluate symmetry**: The molecule has a C3 rotational symmetry axis passing through the center of the benzene ring. This means the three large substituent groups attached at positions 1, 3, and 5 are chemically equivalent, as are the three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6. We only need to count the unique protons on the central core and within *one* of the substituent arms.\n3.  **Analyze the central core protons**: Count the signals from the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core.\n4.  **Analyze the substituent arm protons**: The arm consists of a `-CH2-` linker and a complex chiral group `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)`. We will count the unique signals from each part of this arm.\n5.  **Sum the signals**: Add up the number of signals from all unique parts to get the total number of expected peaks.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule\n    by analyzing its symmetry and counting chemically non-equivalent protons.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step-by-step analysis ---\n\n    # 1. Central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core\n    # Due to C3 symmetry, the three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6\n    # are chemically equivalent.

The -CH2- linker group\n    # Each of the three equivalent arms has a -CH2- group connecting the\n    # benzene ring to the chiral indazole substituent.
