def check_neutrino_asymmetry():
    """
    Analyzes whether a net neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry can be generated
    from the decay of a particle into an equal number of kaons and antikaons.

    The analysis relies on two key principles:
    1. The initial state is CP-symmetric: The number of kaons produced equals the
       number of antikaons produced.
    2. CPT Conservation: This fundamental symmetry of nature dictates that the
       lepton asymmetry generated from a particle's decay chain is equal and
       opposite to that from its antiparticle's decay chain.
