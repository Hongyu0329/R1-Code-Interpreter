    print("\nStep 1: The Basic CARS Process")
    print("Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) is a nonlinear optical process. In its basic form:")
    print(" - A pump beam (frequency ω_p) and a Stokes beam (frequency ω_s) are focused on a sample.")
    print(" - If the frequency difference (ω_p - ω_s) matches a natural vibrational frequency (Ω) of a molecule, that vibration is coherently driven.")
    print(" - A probe beam (frequency ω_pr, often same as the pump) interacts with this coherent vibration.")
    print(" - This interaction generates a new signal beam, the anti-Stokes beam, at a higher frequency.")

    print("\nStep 2: The 'Broadband' Aspect")
    print("The innovation in 'Broadband CARS' (B-CARS) is to use a laser pulse with a very broad spectrum for one of the beams (conventionally, the Stokes beam).")
    print(" - This broadband Stokes beam contains a continuum of frequencies (ω_s).")
    print(" - Therefore, a single narrowband pump pulse can excite an entire range of vibrational modes (Ω) simultaneously, not just one.")

    print("\nStep 3: The Resulting Anti-Stokes Signal and its Equation")
    print("The probe beam scatters off this entire collection of coherently excited vibrations.")
    print("The final equation for the anti-Stokes signal frequency (ω_as) generated from each vibration is:")
    # Printing the components of the final equation as requested by the prompt.
    print(f"ω_as (Anti-Stokes) = ω_p (Pump) - ω_s (Stokes) + ω_pr (Probe)")
    print("Since a wide range of vibrational frequencies (Ω = ω_p - ω_s) are excited, the resulting anti-Stokes signal (ω_as) is also a broadband spectrum.")

    print("\nStep 4: Information Content")
    print("This broadband anti-Stokes signal is not just noise; it is information-rich. When this light is directed into a spectrometer, it is dispersed into its constituent frequencies.")
    print("The resulting spectrum shows distinct peaks, where each peak's position corresponds to a specific molecular vibrational frequency (Ω).")
    print("Therefore, one can obtain a full Raman-like spectrum from a single laser pulse, providing distinguishable information about the sample's chemical makeup.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Based on this analysis, an anti-Stokes beam is generated, and it contains a wealth of distinguishable spectral information.")
    print("This corresponds to answer choice C.")
