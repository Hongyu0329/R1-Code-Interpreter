    Solves the user's complex matrix problem by logical deduction.

    The problem asks for a value obtained through a series of matrix operations.
    One crucial step is to compute the "tridiagonal matrix of the Parlett-Reid
    decomposition of the antisymmetric part of the cofactor matrix".

    Let A be the antisymmetric part of the cofactor matrix. By definition, A is
    skew-symmetric, meaning A^T = -A.

    The Parlett-Reid decomposition algorithm is defined for symmetric matrices,
    which must satisfy the property M^T = M.

    For the problem to be well-defined, the matrix A must therefore be both
    symmetric and antisymmetric. The only matrix that satisfies both A^T = A and
    A^T = -A is the zero matrix (A = -A implies 2A = 0, so A = 0).

    If the matrix A is the zero matrix, any subsequent operations will also result
    in zero.
