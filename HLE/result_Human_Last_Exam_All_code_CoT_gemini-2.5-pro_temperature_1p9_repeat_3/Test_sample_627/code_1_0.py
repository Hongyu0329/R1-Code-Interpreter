# Step 1: Define the properties of the three-twist knot (5_2).
# The genus of a knot is a fundamental invariant used in the calculation.
# From standard knot tables, the genus (g) of the three-twist knot is 1.
g = 1

# Step 2: Use the formula for the upper bound on the braid index (b) from Vogel's algorithm.
# The formula is b = 2g + 1.
b = 2 * g + 1

# Step 3: Print the calculation and the result.
# The final equation shows how the values are used.
print("The formula for the upper bound from Vogel's algorithm is b = 2 * g + 1")

print(f"Calculation: b = 2 * {g} + 1 = {b}")
