    "To find the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma, we will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) scheme, which is a common model for quantizing games.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Establish the Quantum Game Framework:**\n    *   The game starts with an initial state `|00>`, representing both players choosing to Cooperate initially.\n    *   As the \"designer\" of the game for an optimal outcome, we will apply a maximal entangling operator `J` to this state. This operator `J = exp(i * (π/2) * (σ_y ⊗ σ_y) / 2)` links the players' fates, which is the key to resolving the dilemma. The entanglement is set to its maximum value (`γ = π/2`). The initial state for the players' moves is thus `|ψ_initial> = J|00>`.\n    *   Players' strategies are represented by unitary operators. We will consider the classical strategies Cooperate (`C`), represented by the Identity matrix `I`, and Defect (`D`), represented by `i` times the Pauli-X matrix `σ_x`.\n    *   After players apply their strategy operators (`U_A ⊗ U_B`), a disentangling operator `J†` is applied.\n    *   The final state `|ψ_final> = J†(U_A ⊗ U_B)J|00>` is then measured in the classical basis (`|00>`, `|01>`, `|10>`, `|11>`) to determine the probabilities of each outcome.\n\n2.  **Identify the Nash Equilibrium:**\n    *   A Nash Equilibrium is a set of strategies where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n    *   We will hypothesize that the mutual cooperation strategy `(C, C)` is a Nash Equilibrium in this quantum version.\n    *   We will calculate the expected payoffs for the `(C, C)` strategy profile.\n    *   Then, we will calculate the payoff for a player who unilaterally deviates from `C` to `D` (e.g., player A defects, resulting in a `(D, C)` profile).\n    *   By comparing the payoffs, we can determine if `(C, C)` is a stable equilibrium.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   The Python code will use `numpy` to perform the quantum calculations with matrices and state vectors.\n    *   It will define all the necessary operators (`I`, `σ_x`, `σ_y`, `J`), strategies (`C`, `D`), and the initial state.\n    *   It will calculate the final probabilities and expected payoffs for both the `(C, C)` equilibrium state and a `(D, C)` deviation.\n    *   The output will explicitly show the calculation, demonstrating that the payoff for deviating is lower than the payoff at the `(C, C)` equilibrium, thus confirming it is the equilibrium point.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef run_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    #
