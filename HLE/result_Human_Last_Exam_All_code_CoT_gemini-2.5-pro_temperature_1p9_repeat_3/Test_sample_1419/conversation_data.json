    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in the `ϕ^4` theory near four dimensions, we use the Renormalization Group (RG) and the epsilon expansion.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **State the Beta Function**: The core of this analysis is the RG beta function, `β(u)`, which describes how the coupling constant `u` changes with the energy scale. In `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the `ϕ^4` theory is:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + (3u²) / (8π²)`\n    - The `-ϵu` term arises from the canonical scaling of the coupling constant `u` in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions.\n    - The `3u² / (8π²)` term is the one-loop quantum correction.\n\n2.  **Find the Fixed Point**: A fixed point `u*` of the RG flow is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero, i.e., `β(u*) = 0`. This means the coupling no longer changes with the energy scale. We are interested in the non-trivial \"Wilson-Fisher\" fixed point, where `u* ≠ 0`.\n\n3.  **Solve for `u*`**: We set the beta function to zero and solve for `u*`:\n    ` -ϵu* + (3(u*)²) / (8π²) = 0 `\n    ` (3(u*)²) / (8π²) = ϵu* `\n    Since we are looking for the `u* ≠ 0` solution, we can divide by `u*`:\n    ` 3u* / (8π²) = ϵ `\n    ` u* = (8π² / 3)ϵ `\n\n4.  **Execute the Code**: The following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform this derivation symbolically and print the resulting equation for the fixed point `u*`.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_wilson_fisher_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically derives the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Define the one-loop beta function for the phi^4 theory\n    # beta(u) = -epsilon*u + 3*u^2 / (8*pi^2)\n    beta_function = -epsilon * u + (3 * u**2) / (8 * pi**2)\n\n    # 3. Solve for the fixed points where beta(u) = 0\n    fixed_points = sympy.solve(beta_function, u)\n\n    # 4.

Print the final result as a formatted equation,\n    # highlighting the numbers involved as requested.\n    if wilson_fisher_fp is not None:\n        # The expression is (8/3)*pi**2*epsilon\n        eight = 8\n        three = 3\n        two = 2\n        print(\"The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling is:\")\n        print(f\"{u_star} = ({eight} * {pi}**{two} / {three}) * {epsilon}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not find the non-trivial fixed point.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_wilson_fisher_fixed_point()\n\n```\n<<<(8*pi**2/3)*epsilon>>>"
