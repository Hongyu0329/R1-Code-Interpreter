    # I. Transcreation: Creates a new, analogous pun in the target language. This is a valid and effective solution.
    # II. Embedded audio links: Allows the reader to hear the original English pun. This overcomes the challenge by providing the necessary clue.
    # III. Changing the setting: This is insufficient by itself. A French setting doesn't magically create a French pun.
    # IV. Foreigner character: Creates a narrative reason to include the original English words, preserving the puzzle. This is a valid solution.
    # V. Pictorial illustration: Cannot convey a phonetic ambiguity. This is not a valid solution.
    # VI. Phonetic footnotes: Explains the pun to the reader, giving them the necessary information. This overcomes the challenge.
