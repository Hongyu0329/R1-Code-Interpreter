    Explains why the existence of a god is not a decidable problem

    explanation = """
Step 1: Understanding "Decidability"
In computer science, a problem is called 'decidable' if there is an algorithm that can
take any instance of the problem as input, run for a finite amount of time, and
correctly output a 'yes' or 'no' answer.

Step 2: Formalizing the Problem
For an algorithm to work, the problem must be stated in a formal, unambiguous
language. An algorithm needs precise definitions and rules to operate on.
For example, the problem 'is the number X prime?' is decidable because 'number',
'prime', and the rules of division are all formally defined in mathematics.

Step 3: Analyzing the Question "Does a god exist?"
The core of this question revolves around the term 'god'. This term does not have
a single, formal, universally accepted definition that an algorithm can use.
It is a concept from philosophy, theology, and metaphysics, not mathematics
or computer science.

Step 4: The Conclusion
An algorithm cannot be constructed to answer a question that is not formally defined.
Since there is no way to represent 'god' and the rules for proving its existence
in a format that a computer program can process, no such algorithm can exist.

Therefore, the problem is not decidable.
