    # The answer lies in the unique surface chemistry that occurs during the phase transition.

Here is a step-by-step analysis of the process:

Step 1: The initial state involves a solid ammonium sulfate, (NH₄)₂SO₄, aerosol particle. The sulphate-reducing ammonium oxidation reaction is energetically unfavorable in bulk conditions and does not proceed on its own.

Step 2: When the aerosol is exposed to sufficient humidity, it undergoes a phase transition known as deliquescence, transforming from a solid particle into a concentrated aqueous droplet.

Step 3: This physical transformation is critical. As the crystal lattice of the solid breaks down, the ammonium (NH₄⁺) and sulfate (SO₄²⁻) ions become mobile and redistribute themselves at the air-water interface of the newly formed droplet.

Step 4: This process of redistributing local positive and negative charges at the surface creates a highly reactive environment. This enhanced surface reactivity fundamentally changes the reaction pathway, significantly lowering the energy barrier and allowing the oxidation reaction to proceed spontaneously, without the need for an external energy source like heat or light.

This description directly corresponds to the mechanism outlined in one of the choices.
