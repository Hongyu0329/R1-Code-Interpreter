    "To determine the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, we need to consider the additional symmetries imposed by the Kähler structure on top of the usual Riemannian symmetries.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Complex Structure and Dimensions**: A Kähler manifold has a real dimension, say `n`, which must be even. We can describe it by its complex dimension, `m`, where `n = 2m`.\n\n2.  **Symmetries of the Riemann Tensor**: On a generic Riemannian manifold, the tensor $R_{ijkl}$ has certain symmetries. On a Kähler manifold, there's an additional structure (the complex structure `J`) that is covariantly constant. This leads to a major simplification: the only non-zero components of the Riemann tensor (in a holomorphic coordinate system) are of the type $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$, where unbarred indices ($\\alpha, \\gamma$) range from 1 to `m`, and barred indices ($\\bar{\\beta}, \\bar{\\delta}$) correspond to the complex conjugate coordinates.\n\n3.  **Component Symmetries**: These non-zero components $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$ have the following symmetries:\n    *   $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\gamma\\bar{\\beta}\\alpha\\bar{\\delta}}$ (Symmetry in the two unbarred indices)\n    *   $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}} = R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\delta}\\gamma\\bar{\\beta}}$ (Symmetry in the two barred indices)\n    *   $\\overline{R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}} = R_{\\beta\\bar{\\alpha}\\delta\\bar{\\gamma}}$ (A Hermitian-like symmetry)\n\n4.  **Counting the Components**:\n    *   Because of the symmetry in the unbarred indices ($\\alpha, \\gamma$) and the barred indices ($\\beta, \\delta$), we can group them into symmetric pairs. The number of distinct symmetric pairs of indices from a set of `m` is `d = m(m+1)/2`.\n    *   We can think of the components $R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}$ as forming a `d x d` complex matrix, let's call it `M`, where the rows are indexed by the symmetric pair `I = (α, γ)` and the columns by the symmetric pair `J = (β, δ)`.\n    *   The Hermitian symmetry rule ($\\overline{R_{\\alpha\\bar{\\beta}\\gamma\\bar{\\delta}}} = R_{\\beta\\bar{\\alpha}\\delta\\bar{\\gamma}}$) translates to $\\overline{M_{IJ}} = M_{JI}$. This is the definition of a Hermitian matrix.\n    *   We need to find the number of independent real numbers needed to define a `d x d` Hermitian matrix. This is equal to `d^2`. The diagonal elements are real (`d` of them), and the upper triangle has `d(d-1)/2` complex numbers (which is `d(d-1)` real numbers). Total: `d + d(d-1) = d^2`.\n\n5.  **Final Formula**: Substituting `d = m(m+1)/2`, the total number of independent real components for the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` is:\n    \n    $N = \\left(\\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\\right)^2$\n\nThe following Python code calculates this number for a given complex dimension `m`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_riemann_components_kahler():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of a given complex dimension.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        m_str = input(\"Enter the complex dimension of the Kähler manifold (m): \")\n        m = int(m_str)\n        if m < 0:\n            print(\"Dimension cannot be negative.\")\n            return\n        if m == 0:\n            print(\"For a 0-dimensional manifold, there is 1 component (a single point).\")\n            return\n\n        # The number of independent entries in a symmetric pair of indices from 1 to m.\n        d = m * (m + 1) // 2\n\n        # For a Kähler manifold, the Riemann tensor components form a d x d Hermitian matrix.\n        # The number of independent real components in such a matrix is d^2.\n        num_components = d * d\n\n        print(f\"\\nFor a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m = {m} (real dimension n = {2*m}):\")\n        print(\"The number of independent components of the Riemann tensor is given by the formula (m*(m+1)/2)^2.\")\n        \n        # Displaying the calculation step-by-step as requested\n        print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n        print(f\"Number of components = ({m} * ({m} + 1) / 2)^2\")\n        print(f\"                     = ({m} * {m+1} / 2)^2\")\n        print(f\"                     = ({m * (m+1)} / 2)^2\")\n        print(f\"                     = ({d})^2\")\n        print(f\"                     = {num_components}\")\n\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input.
