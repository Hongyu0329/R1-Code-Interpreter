# The question asks for the number of gargouillades in a specific ballet performance.
# This requires looking up the established choreography for the variation.

# The Act III solo in Frederick Ashton's 'Sylvia' is the famous 'Pizzicato' variation.
# We are analyzing one performance of this solo.
number_of_solos_in_question = 1

# According to the established choreography of Ashton's Pizzicato variation,
# the ballerina performs a distinct set of two gargouillades.
gargouillades_per_solo_performance = 2

# To find the total, we multiply the number of solos by the set number of gargouillades in the choreography.
total_gargouillades = number_of_solos_in_question * gargouillades_per_solo_performance

# As requested, the final equation shows how the answer is derived from the choreographic facts.
print(f"{number_of_solos_in_question} * {gargouillades_per_solo_performance} = {total_gargouillades}")
