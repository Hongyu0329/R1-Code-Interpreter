    "To calculate the rule activation level of a fuzzy rule using a t-norm operation, we combine the membership degrees of the rule's antecedent parts. A t-norm generalizes the logical `AND` operation for fuzzy logic. While there are several types of t-norms (e.g., product, Łukasiewicz), the most commonly used one is the **minimum t-norm**.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define variables for the given membership values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these values, which involves finding the minimum of the two numbers.\n3.  The result will be the rule activation level.\n4.  Print the full calculation to show how the result was obtained.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given membership values\nphi_k = 0.7\nmu_G_k_j = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm operation is a fuzzy logic AND. The most common t-norm is the minimum operator.\n# We will calculate the rule activation level using the minimum t-norm.\nactivation_level = np.minimum(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers.\nprint(f\"The rule activation level (τ) is calculated using the minimum t-norm:\")\nprint(f\"τ = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"τ = min({phi_k}, {mu_G_k_j}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
