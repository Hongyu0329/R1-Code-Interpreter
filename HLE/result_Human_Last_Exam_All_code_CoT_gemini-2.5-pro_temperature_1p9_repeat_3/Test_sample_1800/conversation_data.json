    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe \"ideal\" Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is not a single universal value but depends heavily on the specific reaction (Water Gas Shift vs. Water Splitting), synthesis method, and operating conditions. The goal is typically to maximize the interface between Ni and Ceria, which creates highly active catalytic sites. Research in scientific literature points to different optimal ranges for these two applications.\n\nHere is my plan to provide the answer:\n1.  I will create a Python script that acts as a small knowledge base.\n2.  This script will store the recommended optimal molar ratios for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting (WS) reactions based on published research data.\n3.  The script will then iterate through this data and print a clear, human-readable summary for each application, explicitly stating the ratio of Ni to Ce parts.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_optimal_ratios():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function retrieves and displays the optimal Ni/Ce molar ratios \n    for different catalytic reactions based on scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Data based on experimental findings in scientific literature.\n    # The 'ideal' ratio is often a range and depends on synthesis and conditions.\n    # These values represent commonly cited optima.\n    data = {\n        'Water Gas Shift (WGS)': {\n            'Ni_part': 1,\n            'Ce_part': 9,\n            'comment': 'A lower Ni ratio maximizes Ni dispersion and the crucial Ni-CeO2 interface, boosting low-temperature activity.'\n        },\n        'Water Splitting (WS)': {\n            'Ni_part': 1,\n            'Ce_part': 5,\n            'comment': 'A slightly higher Ni concentration can be beneficial for the electronic properties required for water splitting.'\n        }\n    }\n    \n    print(\"Finding optimal Ni/Ce molar ratios for catalytic performance...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    for reaction, details in data.items():\n        ni = details['Ni_part']\n        ce = details['Ce_part']\n        \n        print(f\"For the {reaction} reaction:\")\n        # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation. Here we format the ratio clearly.\n        print(f\"  - The ideal molar ratio is approximately Ni : Ce = {ni} : {ce}\")\n        print(f\"  - This means for every {ni} atom of Nickel, you would have {ce} atoms of Cerium.\")\n        print(f\"  - Comment: {details['comment']}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 60)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_optimal_ratios()\n```\n<<<For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, an ideal Ni/Ce molar ratio is around 1/9. For water splitting (WS), a ratio of around 1/5 is often optimal.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
