    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that analyzes the technical characteristics of each dance to determine the correct answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will create a data structure (a dictionary) to hold information about each dance style mentioned in the answer choices.\n2.  For each dance, I will include a technical note explaining how overturning a reverse turn relates to its core principles.\n3.  The script will then iterate through this data, searching for the dance where overturning a turn is described as a fundamental violation of its technique.\n4.  Finally, it will print the reasoning and the correct answer based on this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_correct_dance():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes dance techniques to determine in which dance overturning a reverse turn\n    is impossible without disregarding the technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    dance_techniques = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Viennese Waltz',\n            'analysis': 'A highly rotational dance.
