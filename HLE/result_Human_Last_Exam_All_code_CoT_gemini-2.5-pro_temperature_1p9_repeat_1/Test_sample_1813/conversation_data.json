    "This problem requires a multi-step computation. Here is the plan to find the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\):\n\n1.  **Find the continued fraction of the rational number \\( r = 4/7 \\).**\n    We use the Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients \\( [a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_n] \\).\n    $$ \\frac{4}{7} = 0 + \\frac{1}{7/4} = 0 + \\frac{1}{1 + 3/4} = 0 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{4/3}} = 0 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + 1/3}} $$\n    This gives the coefficients \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\). So, \\( a_0=0, a_1=1, a_2=1, a_3=3 \\).\n\n2.  **Determine the formula for the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).**\n    For a rational number \\( r = [a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_n] \\), the associated Markov number \\( m_r \\) is the larger root of the quadratic equation:\n    $$ x^2 - (\\alpha + \\beta)x + (\\alpha\\beta - 1) = 0 $$\n    where \\(\\alpha = [a_n; a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_1]\\) and \\(\\beta = [a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}]\\).\n\n3.  **Calculate the values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\).**\n    *   For \\(\\alpha\\), we use \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\):\n        $$ \\alpha = [3; 1, 1] = 3 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1}} = 3 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{7}{2} $$\n    *   For \\(\\beta\\), we use \\(a_0, a_1, a_2\\):\n        $$ \\beta = [0; 1, 1] = 0 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1}} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\n4.  **Solve the quadratic equation for \\( m_{4/7} \\).**\n    Substituting \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) into the equation:\n    $$ x^2 - \\left(\\frac{7}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)x + \\left(\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 1\\right) = 0 \\\\ x^2 - 4x + \\left(\\frac{7}{4} - 1\\right) = 0 \\\\ x^2 - 4x + \\frac{3}{4} = 0 $$\n    Using the quadratic formula, the roots are \\( x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(3/4)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-3}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\).\n    The Markov number is the larger root, so \\( m_{4/7} = \\frac{4 + \\sqrt{13}}{2} \\).\n\n5.  **Compute the continued fraction of \\( m_{4/7} \\).**\n    The final step is to apply the standard algorithm for finding the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational number, which will be implemented in the Python code below.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_markov_cf():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the details of the generalized Markov number m_4/7\n    and its associated continued fraction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The generalized Markov number m_4/7 is given by the expression:\n    # m = (A + sqrt(B)) / C\n    A = 4\n    B = 13\n    C = 2\n\n    print(f\"The generalized Markov number m_4/7 is given by the equation m = (A + sqrt(B)) / C.\")\n    print(f\"For this problem, the values are:\")\n    print(f\"A = {A}\")\n    print(f\"B = {B}\")\n    print(f\"C = {C}\")\n    print(f\"So, m_4/7 = ({A} + sqrt({B})) / {C}\")\n    \n    # --- Compute the continued fraction of m_4/7 ---\n    # We will represent our number as (num_a + num_b*sqrt(d))/den\n    d = B\n    num_a = A\n    num_b = 1\n    den = C\n\n    coeffs = []\n    \n    # Compute enough terms to see the repeating pattern. 15 is sufficient.\n    for _ in range(15):\n        # Calculate the integer part of the current number\n        a_i = math.floor((num_a + num_b * math.sqrt(d)) / den)\n        coeffs.append(a_i)\n        \n        # Subtract the integer part\n        # xi_new = 1 / (xi - a_i)\n        # 1. temp = xi - a_i = ((num_a - a_i*den) + num_b*sqrt(d))/den\n        temp_num_a = num_a - a_i * den\n        \n        # 2.
