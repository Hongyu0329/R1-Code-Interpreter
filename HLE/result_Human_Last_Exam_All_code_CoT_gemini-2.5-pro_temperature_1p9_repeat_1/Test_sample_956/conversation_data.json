    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the given group $G$. The group is specified by three generators acting on a set of 12 elements. I will use Python's `sympy` library to construct the group from these generators and verify its identity by checking its order and comparing it to known finite groups, specifically the Mathieu group $M_{12}$.\n2.  Next, I will find the Schur multiplier $A$ of $G$. The Schur multiplier depends only on the isomorphism class of the group. The Schur multipliers for the finite simple groups are well-documented results in group theory. I will state the known Schur multiplier for the group identified in step 1.\n3.  The problem asks for the number of proper subgroups of $A$, up to isomorphism. Since the Schur multiplier is an abelian group, I will analyze its subgroup structure.\n4.  Finally, I will determine which of these subgroups are proper (i.e., not equal to $A$ itself), group them by isomorphism class, and count the number of such classes. The Python code will perform the group identification and then print out the reasoning for the subsequent steps to arrive at the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport sympy.combin.permutations as perms\nfrom sympy.combin.perm_groups import PermutationGroup\nfrom sympy.combin.named_groups import MathieuGroup\n\ndef solve_subgroup_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by identifying the group G, its Schur multiplier A,\n    and counting the proper subgroups of A up to isomorphism.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the group G from its generators and identify its structure.\")\n    # The set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z}.
