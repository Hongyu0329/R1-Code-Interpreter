# The problem asks for the partial derivative D_x \rho(a,b) at a point (alpha, beta)
# whose nearest point on the curve y = t^5 is (1,1).
# Our derivation shows that the formula for the derivative is (-5*t^4) / (1 + 5*t^4),
# where t is the x-coordinate of the nearest point on the curve.

# For the point (alpha, beta), the nearest point on the curve has x-coordinate t=1.
t = 1

# Calculate the numerator and the denominator of the fraction.
# According to the derivation, the formula for the derivative is:
# Dx(rho) = (-5 * t^4) / (1 + 5 * t^4)

numerator = -5 * (t**4)
denominator = 1 + 5 * (t**4)

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation for the derivative is numerator / denominator.

# To be explicit, the final answer as a fraction of two integers.
# We use the fractions module for a clean representation, though it's simple enough here.
