    This function determines the true statements about chromatic and orbital chromatic roots
    and prints the answer as a sorted string.
    
    The analysis is as follows:
    A. True: A proven conjecture by Cameron and Jackson.
    B. True: Chromatic polynomials can have complex roots (e.g., C4).
    C. False: Chromatic roots cannot be negative real numbers.
    D. True: Chromatic roots can be non-integer real numbers (e.g., related to the golden ratio).
    E. False: Chromatic polynomials have no roots in the interval (0, 1).
