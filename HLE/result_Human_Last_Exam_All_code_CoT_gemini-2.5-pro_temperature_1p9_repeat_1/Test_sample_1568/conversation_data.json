    "Here is the step-by-step derivation for the infinite product followed by the Python code to present the final result.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Rewrite the Product:** Express the product starting from $n=3$ in terms of a product starting from $n=1$. This isolates the general infinite product from the specific starting point.\n2.  **Factorize the Term:** Use the cube roots of unity to factor the term $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$ into a product of three simpler terms.\n3.  **Use the Gamma Function Identity:** Relate the resulting infinite products to the Weierstrass product representation for the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z)$. Multiplying the expressions for the three roots will yield a compact formula for the product from $n=1$.\n4.  **Combine and Simplify:** Substitute the result from step 3 back into the expression from step 1 and simplify to obtain the final closed-form expression.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Write a Python script to print the final equation. The code will define variables for each number in the formula, then construct and print the result as a string, fulfilling the user's request.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  The product is given by $\\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$. We can express this by dividing the product from $n=1$ by the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n2.  The term $1-x^3$ can be factored as $(1-x)(1-x\\omega)(1-x\\omega^2)$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/3}$ and $\\omega^2 = e^{4\\pi i/3}$ are the complex cube roots of unity. So, we can write:\n    $$ 1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right) $$\n\n3.  The infinite product from $n=1$ is related to the Gamma function. The Weierstrass product representation of the Gamma function leads to the identity:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)\\Gamma(1-x\\omega)\\Gamma(1-x\\omega^2)} $$\n    This works because the convergence factors $e^{x/n}, e^{x\\omega/n}, e^{x\\omega^2/n}$ in the individual Gamma product definitions multiply to $e^{x(1+\\omega+\\omega^2)/n} = e^0 = 1$.\n\n4.  Substituting this back into the expression from the first step:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n    Simplifying the denominator gives the final formula:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{8}{(1-z^3)(8-z^3)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z e^{2\\pi i/3})\\Gamma(1-z e^{4\\pi i/3})} $$\n\n```python\ndef solve_and_print_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates and prints the symbolic result for the infinite product:\n    Product_{n=3 to infinity} (1 - z^3 / n^3)\n\n    The code constructs the final equation from its numerical components as requested.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the numbers present in the problem statement and the final equation.\n    n_start = 3\n    power = 3\n    term1_n = 1\n    term2_n = 2\n    term2_denominator = term2_n**power\n\n    # Build the Left Hand Side (LHS) of the equation.\n    lhs_product_symbol = \"\\u220F\"\n    infinity_symbol = \"\\u221E\"\n    lhs = f\"{lhs_product_symbol}_{{n={n_start}}}^{infinity_symbol}(1 - z^{power}/n^{power})\"\n\n    # Build the Right Hand Side (RHS) of the equation.\n    numerator = term2_denominator\n\n    # Denominator components\n    denominator_factor1 = f\"(1 - z^{power})\"\n    denominator_factor2 = f\"({term2_denominator} - z^{power})\"\n    \n    # Gamma function components\n    gamma_symbol = \"\\u0393\"\n    pi_symbol = \"\\u03C0\"\n    \n    # Arguments of the Gamma functions\n    gamma_arg1 = \"1 - z\"\n    gamma_arg2 = f\"1 - z*exp(2{pi_symbol}i/{power})\"\n    gamma_arg3 = f\"1 - z*exp(4{pi_symbol}i/{power})\"\n\n    gamma_part = f\"{gamma_symbol}({gamma_arg1}){gamma_symbol}({gamma_arg2}){gamma_symbol}({gamma_arg3})\"\n    \n    rhs = f\"{numerator} / ({denominator_factor1}{denominator_factor2}{gamma_part})\"\n\n    # Print the final, fully assembled equation.\n    print(\"The final expression for the infinite product is:\")\n    print(f\"{lhs} = {rhs}\")\n\nsolve_and_print_product_formula()\n```\n<<<The final expression for the infinite product is:\n∏_{n=3}^{∞}(1 - z^3/n^3) = 8 / ((1 - z^3)(8 - z^3)Γ(1 - z)Γ(1 - z*exp(2πi/3))Γ(1 - z*exp(4πi/3)))>>>"
