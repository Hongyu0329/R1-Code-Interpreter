    "To solve this problem, I will use a fundamental theorem from the theory of integral lattices. This theorem provides a necessary condition for the existence of a certain type of lattice, which will allow us to determine if such lattices can exist at all.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **State the Theorem:** I will start by stating the necessary condition for the existence of a definite even lattice of a given dimension and determinant. The theorem states that for a definite even lattice of dimension `n` and determinant `d`, the value of `(-1)^(n(n-1)/2) * d` must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4.\n2.  **Apply the Theorem:** I will substitute the given values, dimension `n = 17` and determinant `d = 2`, into this formula.\n3.  **Calculate the Result:** I will perform the calculations step-by-step to check if the condition holds.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on whether the condition is met, I will conclude how many such lattices exist. If the condition is not met, no such lattices can exist, and the answer is 0.\n\nThe python code below will carry out these steps and print the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_lattices(n, det):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the number of positive definite even lattices with a given dimension and determinant\n    by checking a necessary mathematical condition for their existence.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Investigating the existence of positive definite even lattices of dimension {n} and determinant {det}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # Step 1: Explain the governing theorem.\n    print(\"Step 1: Use the theorem on determinants of even lattices.\")\n    print(\"For a positive definite even lattice of dimension 'n' and determinant 'd', a necessary condition is that the following expression holds:\")\n    print(\"    (-1)^(n * (n - 1) / 2) * d \\u2261 0 (mod 4)  OR  1 (mod 4)\")\n    print()\n\n    # Step 2: Plug in the specific values.\n    print(\"Step 2: Substitute the given values into the formula.\")\n    print(f\"    n = {n}\")\n    print(f\"    d = {det}\")\n    print()\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate each part of the formula.\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the left side of the congruence.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the exponent\n    exponent_numerator = n * (n - 1)\n    exponent = exponent_numerator // 2\n    print(f\"    The exponent is n*(n-1)/2 = {n}*({n}-1)/2 = {exponent_numerator}/2 = {exponent}\")\n    \n    # Calculate the sign term\n    sign_term = (-1)**exponent\n    print(f\"    The sign term (-1)^({exponent}) is {sign_term}\")\n    \n    # Calculate the final value on the left-hand side (LHS)\n    lhs_value = sign_term * det\n    print(f\"    The expression (-1)^(n*(n-1)/2) * d evaluates to {sign_term} * {det} = {lhs_value}\")\n    print()\n    \n    # Step 4: Check the condition modulo 4.\n    print(\"Step 4: Check if the condition is met.\")\n    lhs_mod_4 = lhs_value % 4\n    print(f\"    We must check if {lhs_value} is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4.\")\n    print(f\"    Calculating {lhs_value} mod 4 gives {lhs_mod_4}.\")\n    \n    if lhs_mod_4 == 0 or lhs_mod_4 == 1:\n        # This case is not reached for the given inputs.\n        print(f\"\\nResult: The condition is met.
