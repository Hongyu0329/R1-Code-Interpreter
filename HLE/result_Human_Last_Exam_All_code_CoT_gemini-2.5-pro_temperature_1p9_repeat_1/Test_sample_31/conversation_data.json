    "To determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify any of the 21 PLL cases, we need to find the smallest number of sticker observations, `k`, that guarantees a unique signature for each case.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Model the Cube:** We are interested in the 12 non-top-facing stickers of the last layer. There are 4 edge pieces (each with 1 side sticker) and 4 corner pieces (each with 2 side stickers), for a total of `4*1 + 4*2 = 12` stickers. We can assign a reference color to each of these stickers in the solved state. For example, using the standard Western color scheme (Yellow top, Green front), the sticker on the front face of the front-left corner would be Green.\n\n2.  **Define PLLs as Permutations:** Each of the 21 PLL algorithms permutes the last layer pieces. When a piece moves from a source slot to a destination slot, its orientation is adjusted by the algorithm to keep all top-facing stickers Yellow. This rotation changes which of the piece's original side stickers are visible on the destination slot's faces. For example, if the front-left corner piece (with Green and Orange stickers) moves to the front-right slot, its Green sticker might now be on the right face, and its Orange sticker on the front face.\n\n3.  **Computational Search:** We can solve this problem by simulating this process and performing a computational search:\n    *   Theoretically, since there are 21 possible outcomes (the PLL cases), we need enough \"information\" to distinguish them. Observing one sticker gives us one of four possible colors (assuming it's not the correct one). Two stickers give `4*4 = 16` combinations, which is less than 21, so the minimum must be at least 3.\n    *   We can write a program to check `k=3`. We generate every possible combination of 3 stickers to observe out of the 12 available. For each combination, we check if the colors of these 3 stickers create a unique signature for all 21 PLLs.\n    *   If no combination of 3 stickers works, we proceed to check `k=4`. The first value of `k` for which we find a working combination is our answer.\n\n4.  **Implement the Solution:** The Python code below performs this search. To make the code self-contained, it includes a pre-computed data structure, `PLL_DATA`. This table maps each of the 21 PLLs to the resulting colors of the 12 side stickers. The code then iterates through combinations of sticker positions to find the smallest set that can serve as a unique identifier for any case.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_pll_sticker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers\n    required to uniquely identify any of the 21 PLL cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Data Setup ---\n    # The 12 non-top-facing stickers of the last layer.\n    # We assign an index to each sticker position for reference.\n    # cUFR_F = 0, cUFR_R = 1,  cUFL_F = 2, cUFL_L = 3,\n    # cULB_L = 4, cULB_B = 5,  cUBR_B = 6, cUBR_R = 7,\n    # eUF_F  = 8, eUL_L  = 9, eUB_B  = 10, eUR_R  = 11\n    # F=0(Green), R=1(Red), L=2(Orange), B=3(Blue) -
