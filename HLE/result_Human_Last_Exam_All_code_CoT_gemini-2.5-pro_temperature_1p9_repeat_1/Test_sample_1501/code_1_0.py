    Solves the theoretical questions about the doubling construction for nested SQS.

    formal derivation is impossible without knowing the exact construction assumed.

    # is contained in exactly v - 1 ND-pairs.

    # If the resulting design were a standard nested SQS(2v), the number of pairs
    # containing a point would be (2v-1) * mu_prime = (2v-1)*(v-1)/3.
    # (2v-1)(v-1)/3 == v-1  => (2v-1)/3 == 1 => 2v = 4 => v = 2.
