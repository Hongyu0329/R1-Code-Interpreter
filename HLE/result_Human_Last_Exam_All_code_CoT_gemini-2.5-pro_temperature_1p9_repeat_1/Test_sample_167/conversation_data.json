    "The problem asks for the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$. I will solve this by establishing matching upper and lower bounds for this number.\n\n### My plan:\n1.  **Define the Alon-Tarsi Number**: I will start with the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number, denoted $AT(G)$. For a graph $G$, $AT(G)$ is the smallest integer $k$ for which there is an orientation of the edges, $D$, such that:\n    a. The maximum out-degree of any vertex is at most $k-1$.\n    b. The number of even Eulerian subgraphs does not equal the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs.\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound**: I will use a known theorem by Jaeger and Tarsi concerning regular graphs. The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is a 1000-regular graph. The theorem guarantees the existence of an orientation with the non-equal Eulerian subgraph property and a specific maximum out-degree. This will provide an upper bound for the Alon-Tarsi number.\n3.  **Establish a Lower Bound**: For any orientation of a graph, the maximum out-degree must be at least as large as the average out-degree. I will calculate the average out-degree for $K_{1000,1000}$. This fundamental property provides a lower bound on the maximum out-degree for any possible orientation, which in turn gives a lower bound for the Alon-Tarsi number.\n4.  **Conclude**: By comparing the upper and lower bounds, I will determine the exact value of the Alon-Tarsi number for $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\nI will now proceed with the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_alon_tarsi_k1000_1000():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Alon-Tarsi number of K_1000,1000 by finding matching\n    upper and lower bounds.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 1000\n\n    # Basic properties of the graph K_n,n\n    num_vertices = 2 * n\n    num_edges = n * n\n    degree = n\n\n    print(f\"To find the Alon-Tarsi number of K_{n},{n}, we will establish its properties and apply relevant theorems.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"Graph Properties for K_{n},{n}:\")\n    print(f\"1.
