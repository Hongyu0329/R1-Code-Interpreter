    "This is a sophisticated question from abstract algebra concerning the classification of a specific type of finite group. I will break down the problem and use established (and debated) results from group theory research to provide the most accurate answer possible.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request**: The user wants to identify all nonabelian \"filled groups\" of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number.\n    *   A **product-free set** `S` in a group `G` is a subset where for any two elements `a, b` in `S`, their product `ab` is not in `S`.\n    *   A **maximal product-free set** is a product-free set that cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group.\n    *   A group `G` is **filled** if *every* one of its maximal product-free sets generates the entire group `G` (i.e., `<S> = G`).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Group Structure**: A group `G` of order `2q^m` has a normal Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` (order `q^m`) and a Sylow 2-subgroup `P` (order 2). `G` is a semidirect product `Q ⋊ P`. For `G` to be nonabelian, this either has to be a non-trivial semidirect product, or a direct product `Q × P` where `Q` itself is nonabelian.\n\n3.  **Consult Group Theory Literature**: This problem requires knowledge from research papers on filled groups.\n    *   A key result from Street and Whitehead states that a direct product of two non-trivial groups is *not* filled. This immediately rules out the case where `P` is normal and `Q` is nonabelian (since `G ≅ Q × P`).\n    *   This leaves us with non-trivial semidirect products `G = Q ⋊ C₂`, where `C₂` (the group of order 2) acts on `Q` in a non-trivial way.\n    *   For the case where `m=1`, the group is the dihedral group `D_{2q}`. A widely cited result by De Medts and Dietrich shows that `D_{2q}` is filled if and only if `q` is a **Fermat prime** (a prime number of the form `2^(2^n) + 1`).\n    *   For the general case, research strongly suggests that the conditions for being a filled group are very restrictive. It is conjectured (but not fully proven for all cases) that for a group `G = A ⋊ C₂` where `A` is an abelian group of odd order, `G` is filled only if `A` is cyclic of order `p` (`A ≅ C_p`) where `p` is a Fermat prime.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Conclusion**: Based on the available evidence, the only known nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are the dihedral groups `D_{2q}` where `q` is a Fermat prime. This corresponds to the case where `m=1`. The known Fermat primes are 3, 5, 17, 257, and 65537.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Code**: I will write a Python script that finds these specific groups. The script will:\n    a. Iterate through odd numbers `q` up to a certain limit.\n    b. Check if `q` is prime.\n    c. Check if `q` is a Fermat prime. A prime `p` is a Fermat prime if and only if `p-1` is a power of two.\n    d. If `q` is a Fermat prime, print the details of the corresponding filled group `D_{2q}`.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_power_of_two(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a number is a power of two.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False\n    # A power of two in binary has only one bit set to 1.\n    # n & (n - 1) will be 0 if n is a power of two.\n    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0\n\ndef find_filled_groups(limit):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m, which are conjectured\n    to only exist for m=1 and q being a Fermat prime.\n    The function searches for odd primes q up to the specified limit.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Searching for nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q up to an order of {2*limit}:\")\n    print(\"Based on current research, these are expected to be dihedral groups D_{2q} where q is a Fermat prime.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    found_any = False\n    # We test odd primes q starting from 3.\n    for q in range(3, limit + 1, 2):\n        if is_prime(q):\n            # A prime q is a Fermat prime if (q-1) is a power of two.\n            if is_power_of_two(q - 1):\n                found_any = True\n                order = 2 * q\n                m = 1\n                # In the final print statement, we explicitly show each number.\n                print(\n                    f\"Found: Group D_{{{2}*{q}}} is a nonabelian filled group of order {order}.\\n\"\n                    f\"       This fits the form 2*q^m with q={q}, m={m}.\\n\"\n                )\n\n    if not found_any:\n        print(\"No such groups found within the search limit.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # We set a search limit for the prime q. The order of the group will be 2*q.\n    search_limit_for_q = 70000\n    find_filled_groups(search_limit_for_q)\n```\n<<<The only known nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` are the dihedral groups `D_{2q}` where `q` is a Fermat prime.
