# Step 1: Define the total number of distinct knot types with 7 crossings.
# According to the standard Rolfsen knot table, there are 7 such knots (7_1 to 7_7).
total_knots = 7

# Step 2: Identify the number of non-hyperbolic knots.
# A prime knot is either a torus knot or a hyperbolic knot. All 7-crossing knots are prime.
# The knot 7_1 is the (7,2)-torus knot and is not hyperbolic.
# The other 6 knots are hyperbolic.
num_non_hyperbolic = 1

# Step 3: Calculate the number of hyperbolic knots.
num_hyperbolic = total_knots - num_non_hyperbolic

# Step 4: Calculate the proportion.
proportion = num_hyperbolic / total_knots

# Step 5: Print the explanation and the final equation.
