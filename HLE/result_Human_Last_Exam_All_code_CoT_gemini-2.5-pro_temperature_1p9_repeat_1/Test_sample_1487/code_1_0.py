# Based on the analytical derivation, the squared norm of the vector alpha is:
# ||alpha||^2 = 0.5 * (pi^2 / 6 - 1)

# The expression to evaluate is:
# 2 * ||alpha||^2 / (pi^2 / 6 - 1) + 10^15

# Let's define the components of the expression
pi = math.pi
constant_term = 10**15

# Calculate the denominator of the fraction in the expression
denominator_val = (pi**2 / 6) - 1

# Calculate the squared norm of alpha
norm_alpha_sq = 0.5 * denominator_val

# Calculate the numerator of the fraction in the expression
numerator_val = 2 * norm_alpha_sq

# To fulfill the requirement of showing each number in the final equation,
# we will print the calculated values for the numerator, denominator, and constant term.
