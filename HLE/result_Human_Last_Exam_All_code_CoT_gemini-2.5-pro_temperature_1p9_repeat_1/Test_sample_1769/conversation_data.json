    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the hypothetical modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence:\n\n1.  **Identify the Source of the Current Word:** First, we confirm the origin of the current word \"sister\". It comes from the Old Norse word \"systir\", which replaced the native Old English term due to the significant linguistic interaction during the Viking Age.\n2.  **Find the Original Old English Word:** We will identify the word that the Anglo-Saxons used before the Norse influence. This word was \"sweoster\".\n3.  **Trace the Natural Linguistic Evolution:** Next, we will trace how \"sweoster\" would have likely evolved through Middle English and into Modern English by applying known patterns of sound change observed in other native English words. The Old English diphthong \"eo\" typically smoothed into a simple \"e\" vowel, and the unstressed final syllable would have likely reduced.\n4.  **Construct the Final Word:** Based on these changes, we can construct the hypothetical modern version of \"sweoster\".\n\nThis process will be encapsulated in a Python script that prints out the explanation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and explains what the modern English word for 'sister'\n    would likely be without the historical influence of the Old Norse language.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Explain the origin of the current word.\n    print(\"The modern English word 'sister' is a loanword.\")\n    print(\"It was borrowed from the Old Norse word 'systir' during the Viking Age.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the original Old English word.\n    old_english_word = \"sweoster\"\n    print(f\"Before the Norse influence, the native Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word was '{old_english_word}'.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Explain the likely linguistic evolution.\n    hypothetical_modern_word = \"swester\"\n    print(\"If the word 'sweoster' had evolved naturally into Modern English, it would have followed typical sound changes:\")\n    print(\" - The 'eo' vowel diphthong would likely have simplified to a simple 'e' sound.\")\n    print(\" - This would have resulted in the Middle English form 'swester'.\")\n    print(\" - This form would likely have been stable into the Modern English period.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Present the final conclusion.\n    print(\"Therefore, if the Norse had never invaded, the Modern English word for 'sister' would most likely be:\")\n    print(hypothetical_modern_word)\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<swester>>>"
