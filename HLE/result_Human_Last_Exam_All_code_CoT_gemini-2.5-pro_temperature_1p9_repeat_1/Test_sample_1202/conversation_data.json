    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script designed to analyze the provided multiple-choice question about gene duplication and determine the most likely answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will define the biological mechanisms listed in the answer choices.\n2.  Next, I will analyze each mechanism based on two key criteria from the question: whether it promotes the **retention** of both gene copies and whether it promotes their **divergence** (becoming different).\n3.  Based on this analysis, I will evaluate which mechanism(s) best fit both criteria.\n4.  Finally, I will identify and print the most suitable answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_fates():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the mechanisms responsible for the retention and divergence of\n    duplicate genes and prints the most likely answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n\n    # A dictionary to hold the answer choices and their detailed explanations.\n    choices = {\n        'A': {\n            'term': \"Gene conversion\",\n            'explanation': \"A process that makes two duplicate genes more similar by copying a sequence from one to the other.
