    "To find the central pixel of the line from (1,1) to (11,5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Implement Bresenham's Algorithm**: First, I will generate all the integer coordinates of the pixels that lie on the line. The algorithm starts at the first point (1,1) and iteratively determines the next pixel by evaluating a decision parameter, which is based on the line's slope. Since the slope `m = (5-1)/(11-1) = 4/10 = 0.4` is between 0 and 1, for each step in the x-direction, we will decide whether to also step in the y-direction.\n\n2.  **Store the Pixels**: As the algorithm generates each pixel coordinate, I will store them in a list.\n\n3.  **Identify the Central Pixel**: After generating all the pixels on the line, I will count the total number of pixels. A line drawn by this algorithm between two integer points will have a specific number of pixels. If this number is odd, there is a single central pixel. The central pixel's position can be found at the middle index of the list (e.g., for 11 pixels, the 6th one is the center).\n\n4.  **Output the Result**: The code will print the full list of pixels on the line to show the result of the \"equation\", and then it will explicitly state the coordinates of the central pixel.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\ndef find_central_pixel():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the central pixel of a line using Bresenham's algorithm\n    and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    x1, y1 = 1, 1\n    x2, y2 = 11, 5\n\n    # Calculate differences and initialize variables for Bresenham's algorithm.\n    # This implementation is simplified for the case where the slope is between 0 and 1.\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n    p = 2 * dy - dx\n    x, y = x1, y1\n\n    pixels = []\n\n    # The 'equation' for the line is the set of pixels it's composed of.\n    # We will generate and store each pixel coordinate.\n    while x <= x2:\n        pixels.append((x, y))\n        if p < 0:\n            # Move to the next x, keep y the same.
