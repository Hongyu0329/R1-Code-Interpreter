    This function demonstrates a key step in the proof that f(x) = x^2 + 1
    has only one fixed point in the Stone-Cech remainder.

    The proof shows that any potential fixed point 'p' cannot contain an
    interval of the form (-infinity, M), because if it did, it would
    also have to contain all its preimages under f. This function shows
    that for any M, the sequence of preimages eventually becomes the empty set,
    which cannot be an element of an ultrafilter. This is a contradiction.

    The preimage of (-infinity, c) under f(x) = x^2 + 1 is the set
    {x | x^2 + 1 < c} = {x | x^2 < c - 1}.
    This is the interval (-sqrt(c-1), sqrt(c-1)) if c > 1, and empty otherwise.
    So, we just need to track the upper bound 'c' of the interval.
