# The three explanations describe the same event at different levels of scientific analysis:
# 1. Folk Psychology (everyday experience)
# 2. Behavioral Psychology (learning mechanism)
# 3. Neuroscience (physical brain changes)
# These explanations are not independent or contradictory; they are nested and complementary.
# The physical brain changes (3) are the basis for the learned response (2),
# which is the scientific explanation for the subjective fear (1).
# Therefore, if one explanation is correct, the others must also be correct as they describe
# different facets of the same reality. This matches choice D.
