    "Here is a step-by-step plan to derive the analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon)$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the integrand:** The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + p(x)} dx$, with $p(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$. For small positive $\\epsilon$, the integrand becomes very large where the denominator is very small. In the integration interval $[0, 15.00]$, the denominator is smallest when $p(x)$ is smallest. $p(x)$ is non-negative and its only zero in this interval is at $x=0$. Therefore, the dominant contribution to the integral comes from a small region near $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Approximate the integrand:** For small $x$, the polynomial $p(x)$ can be accurately approximated by its lowest power term, which is $9.0 x^{5.0}$. This is the most significant term when $x$ is close to 0. Thus, we can approximate the integral as:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the integration limits:** Since the value of the integral is dominated by the region near $x=0$ and the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}}$ decreases rapidly as $x$ increases, extending the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to $\\infty$ will introduce a negligible error for small $\\epsilon$. This simplifies the problem to an analytically solvable integral:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n4.  **Solve the integral:** We can solve this integral using a substitution. Let $9.0 x^{5.0} = \\epsilon u^{5.0}$, which means $x = u \\cdot (\\epsilon/9.0)^{1/5.0}$. Then the differential is $dx = du \\cdot (\\epsilon/9.0)^{1/5.0}$. Substituting these into the integral gives:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + \\epsilon u^{5.0}} (\\epsilon/9.0)^{1/5.0} du$\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} (\\epsilon/9.0)^{1/5.0} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^{5.0}} du$\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9.0^{-1/5.0} \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5.0} \\cdot \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^{5.0}} du$.\n    The definite integral $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^n} du$ has a known solution: $\\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$. For $n=5.0$, this evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi/5.0}{\\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$.\n\n5.  **Assemble the final formula:** By combining the parts, we obtain the analytical formula:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx 9.0^{-1/5.0} \\cdot \\epsilon^{-4/5.0} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi/5.0}{\\sin(\\pi/5.0)}$.\n    This is of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\cdot \\epsilon^p$, where the exponent is $p = -4.0/5.0 = -0.8$ and the coefficient is $C = \\frac{\\pi}{5.0 \\cdot \\sin(\\pi/5.0) \\cdot 9.0^{1/5.0}}$.\n\n6.  **Provide Python Code:** The following Python script calculates the numerical values of $C$ and $p$ and prints the final analytical formula.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# This script calculates the parameters for the analytical approximation\n# of the integral I(epsilon) for small epsilon.\n# The approximation has the form: I(epsilon) ≈ C * epsilon^p.\n\n# From the problem, the integrand is 1/(epsilon + 9.0*x^5.0 + 5.0*x^6.0 + 9.0*x^8.0).\n# For small x, the dominant term in the denominator is a*x^n.\na = 9.0\nn = 5.0\n\n# ===== Calculation =====\n# The exponent 'p' in the approximation formula is p = (1/n) - 1.\np_val = (1.0 / n) - 1.0\n\n# The coefficient 'C' is given by C = (a**(-1/n)) * (pi / (n * sin(pi/n))).\nC_val = (a**(-1.0 / n)) * (np.pi / (n * np.sin(np.pi / n)))\n\n\n# ===== Output =====\n# The prompt requests that we output each number in the final equation.\n# The final equation is I(epsilon) ≈ C * epsilon^p\n\n# We will print the equation with its numerical coefficients.\nprint(\"The analytical formula that approximates the integral is:\")\nprint(f\"I(epsilon) ≈ {C_val} * epsilon^({p_val})\")\nprint(\"\\nWhere each number in the final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient C = {C_val}\")\nprint(f\"The exponent p = {p_val}\")\n```\n<<<I(epsilon) approx 0.6888339023419041 * epsilon**(-0.8)>>>"
