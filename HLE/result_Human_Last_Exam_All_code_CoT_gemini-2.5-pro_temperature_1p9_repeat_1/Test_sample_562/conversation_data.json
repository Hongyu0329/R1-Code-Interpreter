    "To find the radical of the character 謄, we need to break it down into its constituent parts.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Character**: The character 謄 can be split into a left part and a right part.\n2.  **Identify the Radical**: The left part is 言. This component means \"word\" or \"speech\" and is a common radical (Radical 149). When it appears on the left side of a character, it is the radical.\n3.  **Find the Radical's Name**: In Japanese, radicals are often named based on their meaning, appearance, and position. The radical 言, when positioned on the left side (a position known as *hen* or *ben*), is called \"ごんべん\" (gonben).\n4.  **Transcribe to Hepburn**: The Hepburn transcription of ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n\nTherefore, the radical in 謄 is 言, and its name is Gonben. I will provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the radical (bushu) for the kanji '謄' and prints its name in Hepburn transcription.\n# The character 謄 is composed of the radical 言 (word) on the left and the component 朕 on the right.\n# The radical 言 on the left side of a character is called \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n\nradical_name = \"Gonben\"\nprint(radical_name)\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
