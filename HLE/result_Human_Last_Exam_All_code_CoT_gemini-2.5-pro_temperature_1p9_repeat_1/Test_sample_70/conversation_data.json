    "My plan is to solve this problem by first determining the linear algebraic rank of the Danish flag and then finding African national flags that share the same rank.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Danish Flag's Structure:** I will represent the Danish flag as a matrix. The flag has a simple geometric structure: a white Nordic cross on a red field. To ensure the rank is maximal, I'll assign distinct numerical values to the different colors (e.g., Red=1, White=2).\n2.  **Calculate the Rank:** I will determine the rank of the resulting matrix. The rank is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). This will give us a target rank number. Based on the cross structure, the rank will be 2, because not all rows/columns are simple multiples of each other, but there is dependency (e.g., some rows are identical).\n3.  **Identify Geometric Structures with the Same Rank:** A rank of 2 arises from specific geometric patterns. I'll identify what these patterns are. Besides the Nordic cross, a common pattern that yields a rank of 2 is a flag with a triangle at the hoist superimposed on a field of horizontal stripes. The \"Y\" shape (pall) on the South African flag also results in this rank.\n4.  **Find Matching African Flags:** I will then identify all African national flags that feature these specific rank-2 geometric structures.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that explains this logic, demonstrates the rank calculation for both the Danish flag and an example African flag, and prints the final list of countries. The code will explicitly show the equation `rank(Flag) = 2` as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_flags_with_same_rank_as_denmark():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies African national flags that have the same\n    linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n    The analysis assumes that when converting a flag to a matrix, distinct\n    colors are assigned values that are linearly independent to ensure the\n    rank is maximal and determined purely by the flag's geometric structure.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze and calculate the rank of the Danish flag.\n    # The flag has a red field (R) and a white cross (W).\n    # We can simplify its structure into a 3x3 matrix.\n    # Let's assign R=1, W=2.
