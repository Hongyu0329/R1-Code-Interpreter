    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic linguistic riddle. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  The key to the riddle is a pun that works in the Russian language. It relies on how a Russian speaker might describe the scene.\n2.  The \"wide boulevards of Vienna\" are beautiful and impressive. A common Russian exclamation for something marvelous or \"divine\" is \"О, дивный!\" (pronounced \"O, divnyy!\").\n3.  Phonetically, the beginning of this phrase, \"О, дивн...\" (\"O, divn...\"), sounds very similar to \"Оден\" (\"Oden\").\n4.  \"Оден\" is the standard Russian transliteration for the surname of the 20th-century English poet W. H. Auden.\n5.  Fittingly, Auden actually spent a significant part of his later life living in Austria, not far from Vienna.\n\nThe Python code below will print out the parts of this pun to demonstrate the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves a linguistic riddle about an English poet's name\n    appearing in a Russian description of Vienna's boulevards.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the components of the pun.\n    russian_exclamation = \"О, дивные!\"\n    phonetic_part = \"О, дивн...\"\n    russian_surname_transliteration = \"Оден\"\n    english_surname = \"Auden\"\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the logic of the pun step-by-step.\n    print(\"The solution is a linguistic pun based on the Russian language.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    print(f\"1.
