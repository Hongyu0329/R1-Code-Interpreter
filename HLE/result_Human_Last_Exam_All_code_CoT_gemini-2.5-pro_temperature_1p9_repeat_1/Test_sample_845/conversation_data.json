    "This is a knowledge-based question rather than a coding task, so a direct explanation is the most suitable answer. I will identify the term you are looking for.\n\nThe value computed as the time interval between consecutive heartbeats, which is used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV), is called the **R-R interval**.\n\nWhile the term **R-R interval** technically refers to the time between the R-waves on an ECG (electrocardiogram), it has become the standard and most common term in HRV research and literature, even when the data is collected via PPG (photoplethysmography). For PPG, the more specific term is **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)**, but R-R interval is used more widely.\n\n<<<R-R interval"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
