    Step 1: Understand the Reaction
    The reaction between a fluorine atom and deuterated methane (F + CHDâ‚ƒ) is highly exothermic. Such reactions typically have an 'early' transition state, which means the energy barrier to reaction resembles the reactants.

    Step 2: Effect of Vibrational Excitation
    An infrared laser is used to selectively deposit energy into the C-H bond's vibrational mode. This makes the C-H bond 'hot' and highly excited, while the C-D bonds remain 'cold'.

    Step 3: Principle of Bond-Selective Chemistry
    Even though translational energy is generally more effective for early-barrier reactions, placing a large quantum of energy directly into the specific bond that will be broken (the C-H bond) dramatically increases its reactivity. The vibrational energy is effectively channeled into breaking that specific bond.

    Step 4: Conclusion
    As a result, the fluorine atom is far more likely to react with the energized C-H bond than with the unexcited C-D bonds. This accelerates the reaction pathway that involves removing the H atom, enhancing its likelihood significantly over the removal of D atoms.

    This leads to the following evaluation of the choices:
    A. True, but not the most complete answer.
    B. Incorrect. Reactivity is increased, not decreased.
    C. Incorrect. The excitation is bond-specific, so the bonds do not react equally.
    D. Correct. This choice accurately describes the key outcome: enhanced selectivity for H atom removal.
    E. Incorrect. Experiments show a very strong effect.
