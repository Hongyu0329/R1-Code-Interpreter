    Analyzes strategies for mitigating identifiability issues in birth-death models

    explanation = """
The core issue is that for a phylogeny of only extant species, a birth-death model with arbitrarily time-varying speciation (λ(t)) and extinction (μ(t)) rates is unidentifiable. This means that an infinite number of different {λ(t), μ(t)} pairs can result in the exact same likelihood for the tree. To solve this, one must either add more data, constrain the model, or reparametrize it to focus on identifiable quantities.

Let's analyze the options based on these solutions:

*   **A, B (Strategies that Constrain the Model):**
    *   **(A) Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces:** This constrains the infinitely flexible λ(t) and μ(t) functions to be simple step-functions. This simplification drastically reduces the model's flexibility and makes the parameters identifiable. This strategy HELPS.
    *   **(B) Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework:** Priors add information to the model, effectively constraining the parameter space to plausible values. This helps prevent the analysis from wandering through equivalent but biologically unrealistic solutions. This strategy HELPS.

*   **D, F (Strategies that Add Data):**
    *   **(D, F) Incorporating fossils:** Fossils provide direct evidence of extinct lineages and their timing. This is new, crucial information that is not present in an extant-only phylogeny. This data allows the model to distinguish between speciation and extinction events, breaking the ambiguity. Both methods of incorporating fossils (with or without removal) provide the necessary data to make λ(t) and μ(t) identifiable. These strategies HELP.

*   **E, G (Strategies that Reparametrize):**
    *   **(E) Inferring the pulled diversification rate** and **(G) Inferring the pulled speciation rate:** Research (Louca & Pennell, 2020) has shown that while λ(t) and μ(t) are not individually identifiable from extant data, certain combinations of them are. The pulled diversification rate and pulled speciation rate are two such identifiable parameters. By changing the model to estimate these quantities directly, you are focusing on what the data can actually tell you. These strategies HELP.

*   **C (Strategy that does NOT help):**
    *   **(C) Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5:** This strategy does the opposite of constraining the model. A 5th-degree polynomial is a very flexible function. Using a series of 10 such polynomials makes the potential shapes for λ(t) and μ(t) extremely flexible and complex. This high degree of flexibility, without any new data or meaningful constraints, only exacerbates the identifiability problem. It makes it easier, not harder, for the model to find an infinite set of parameter combinations that fit the data equally well. Therefore, this strategy does **NOT** help mitigate the issue.
