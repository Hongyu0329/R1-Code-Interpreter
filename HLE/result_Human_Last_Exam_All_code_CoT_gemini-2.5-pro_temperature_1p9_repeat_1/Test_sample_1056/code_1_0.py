# Based on the mathematical derivation, the structure of the abelianization of G, Ab(G), is determined.

# The rank corresponds to the number of Z factors.
# The formula for the abelianization yields Ab(G) isomorphic to Z.
# Z = Z^1. So the rank is 1.
r = 1

# The torsion order t is the order of the torsion subgroup of Ab(G).
# The torsion subgroup of Z is the trivial group {0}, which has order 1.
t = 1

# The pair (r, t) is computed.
result = (r, t)
