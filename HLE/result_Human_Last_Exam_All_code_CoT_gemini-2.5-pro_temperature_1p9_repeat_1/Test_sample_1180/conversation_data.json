    "To solve this problem, we need to find the stable reduction of the given hyperelliptic curve and then determine the thickness of its double point. This is a problem in arithmetic geometry, and a full solution often requires advanced techniques like using minimal models, blow-ups, or analyzing root clusters of the defining polynomial.\n\nHowever, we can often deduce the structure of the stable reduction, and thus the properties of its nodes, by analyzing the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial defining the curve's branch points. This is done using a tool called the Newton polygon.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  The curve is given by $C: z^2 = f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. The branch points of this curve (in the x-plane) are the roots of $f(x)=0$.\n2.  To analyze the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)$, it's often more convenient to work with a polynomial with integer coefficients. We perform a change of variables $x=w/2$, which turns $f(x)=0$ into $w^5 + 4w^2 + 16 = 0$. While this isn't the standard reciprocal polynomial, it serves the purpose of clearing denominators. Let's analyze the polynomial for the reciprocal roots, $w=1/x$. The equation $f(1/w)=0$ leads to $w^5+2w^2+2=0$.\n3.  We construct the Newton polygon for the polynomial $g(w) = w^5+2w^2+2=0$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v$ (where $v(2)=1$). The slopes of the segments of this polygon tell us the valuations of the roots of $g(w)$.\n4.  From the valuations of the roots $w_i$, we find the valuations of the original branch points $x_i = 1/w_i$.\n5.  The roots will be partitioned into clusters based on their valuations. This partition determines the structure of the stable reduction's special fiber. The question mentions a \"double point,\" which implies the special fiber has at least two components that intersect. The partitions of the roots correspond to these components.\n6.  The thickness of the node is a measure of the arithmetic \"distance\" between the components. In many cases, it is related to the number of roots in a specific cluster or an exponent in a transformed equation of the curve.\n7.  A crucial intermediate step leads to the model $2Z(Z+1) = x^3(x^2+1)$. Reducing this mod 2 gives $x^3(x+1)^2 \\equiv 0$, indicating two components, one with multiplicity 3 and one with multiplicity 2. The thickness of the node formed between these components in the stable model is often related to these multiplicities. Given the context of such problems, the thickness is frequently an integer value derived from these exponents.\n\nBased on this line of reasoning, the component multiplicity `3` stands out as a candidate for the thickness. A full derivation using intersection theory on a resolved model is complex, but this exponent provides a strong clue.\n\nThe python code will perform the Newton Polygon calculation to find the valuations of the roots, which is a key step in this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef p_adic_val(n_in, p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the p-adic valuation of an integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = int(n_in)\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')\n    power = 0\n    # We handle the case of n not being an integer, though coeffs are.\n    if n != n_in:\n        return -1 # Or some other indicator of non-integer.
