    "My plan is to determine the transformation rule by analyzing the input-output grid pairs. After examining the relationship between each cell's output value and its neighbors in the input grid, I've deduced the underlying rule. I will then implement this rule in Python to process the sixth test grid and generate the required output.\n\nHere are the thinking steps:\n1.  **Hypothesize the Rule:** The transformation of each cell seems to depend on its local environment. I'll test several hypotheses, such as flipping the cell's value, Conway's Game of Life rules, and other cellular automata rules.\n2.  **Gather Evidence:** I will systematically check the output value of a cell against its original value (`in`) and the sum of its 8 neighbors (`S`) across multiple examples to find a consistent pattern.\n3.  **Refine the Hypothesis:** My initial tests showed that simple rules like `output = 1 - input` or standard Game of Life rules have inconsistencies. After carefully recalculating neighbor sums for several cells across different grids, I collected the following data for `(input_value, neighbor_sum) -> output_value`:\n    *   `in=1, S=0 -> out=0` (from Grid 4, cell [2,2])\n    *   `in=1, S=2 -> out=1` (from Grid 1, cell [1,3])\n    *   `in=1, S=3 -> out=1` (from Grid 2, cell [1,2])\n    *   `in=0, S=1 -> out=0` (from Grid 5, cell [0,0])\n    *   `in=0, S=2 -> out=1` (from Grid 1, cell [0,0])\n    *   `in=0, S=3 -> out=1` (from Grid 1, cell [1,1])\n    *   `in=0, S=4 -> out=0` (from Grid 2, cell [2,2])\n4.  **Identify the Final Rule:** The evidence strongly suggests that the output value of a cell is independent of its own original value. The rule is solely based on the number of its live neighbors (`S`):\n    *   A new cell at `[r, c]` will be `1` if its number of live neighbors in the input grid is exactly `2` or `3`.\n    *   Otherwise, the new cell will be `0`.\n    This rule is consistent across all provided examples. The numbers in this rule are `2` and `3`.\n5.  **Implement and Solve:** I will write a Python script to apply this rule to the sixth test grid. The script will iterate through each cell, count its live neighbors, determine the new cell value, and construct the final output grid. Finally, it will print the result as a 25-digit binary string.\n\n```python\ndef solve_grid_puzzle(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to a grid.\n    The rule is: A cell's new state is 1 if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors,\n    and 0 otherwise.
