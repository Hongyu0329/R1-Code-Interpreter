    "In a film's dance scene, the sound elements are layered to create the desired emotional and narrative impact. Here is my plan to determine the hierarchy and present it using a Python script:\n\n1.  **Analyze the role of each sound element in a dance scene:**\n    *   **Music:** This is the core component. The choreography, rhythm, and emotional tone of the scene are all dictated by the music. It is the primary reason for the dance.\n    *   **Sound Effects (SFX):** These include sounds like footsteps, tapping shoes, the swish of clothing, or environmental sounds. They ground the dance in a physical space, add a layer of realism and texture, and can enhance the rhythm.\n    *   **Speech (Dialogue):** Dialogue is typically minimal or absent during a dance sequence. The storytelling is conveyed through movement and music. If speech is present, it's usually secondary to the music and action.\n\n2.  **Establish the hierarchy:** Based on the analysis, the most important element is Music, followed by Sound Effects to add realism and texture, and lastly Speech, which is the least crucial during the dance itself.\n\n3.  **Write a Python script:** I will create a Python script that stores this hierarchy in a list and then prints it in the requested comma-separated format.\n\n```python\ndef get_sound_hierarchy():\n  \"\"\"\n  Determines and prints the hierarchy of sound importance in a dance scene.\n  \n  In a dance scene, music is the foundational element that drives the action and emotion.\n  Sound effects provide texture and realism (e.g., footsteps, rustling clothes).\n  Speech is typically the least important element as the focus is on movement and music.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  # The hierarchy is Music > Sound Effects > Speech.\n  # We list them in this order.\n  hierarchy_list = [\"Music\", \"Sound Effects\", \"Speech\"]\n  \n  # Format the list into a string separated by a comma and a space.\n  result_string = \", \".join(hierarchy_list)\n  \n  # Print the final formatted string.\n  print(result_string)\n\nget_sound_hierarchy()\n```\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"
