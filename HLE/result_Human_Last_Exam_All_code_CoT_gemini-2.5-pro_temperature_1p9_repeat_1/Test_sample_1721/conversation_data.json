    "This problem asks for the maximum density `c` of a set `A` of integers such that `A+A` contains no perfect squares. This is a problem in additive combinatorics. A powerful method to construct such sets is to use modular arithmetic.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Strategy**: We will construct the set `A` by selecting numbers that belong to a specific set of residue classes modulo some integer `m`. Let `R` be a subset of `{0, 1, ..., m-1}`. We can define our set `A` as `{n ∈ {1, ..., N} | n mod m ∈ R}`. For large `N`, the density of this set `A` is `|R|/m`.\n\n2.  **Condition**: For the sumset `A+A` to contain no squares, the sum of any two elements `a1, a2 ∈ A` must not be a perfect square. If we build `A` from residue classes `R` modulo `m`, then for any `a1, a2 ∈ A`, we have `a1 ≡ r1 (mod m)` and `a2 ≡ r2 (mod m)` for some `r1, r2 ∈ R`. Their sum is `a1 + a2 ≡ r1 + r2 (mod m)`. If we can ensure that `r1 + r2 (mod m)` is never a residue class that a square can belong to, then `a1 + a2` can never be a square.\n\n3.  **Formalizing the condition**: Let `S_m = {k^2 mod m | k ∈ Z}` be the set of quadratic residues modulo `m`. We need to find a set of residues `R ⊂ {0, ..., m-1}` such that for any `r1, r2 ∈ R` (including `r1=r2`), the sum `(r1 + r2) mod m` is not in `S_m`.\n\n4.  **Optimization**: Our goal is to find the maximum possible density, `c = |R|/m`. We need to search for a modulus `m` and a corresponding set `R` that maximizes this ratio. This is equivalent to finding a special type of clique in a graph defined on the residues modulo `m`.\n\n5.  **Algorithm**:\n    a. Iterate through different moduli `m = 3, 4, 5, ...` up to a reasonable limit.\n    b. For each `m`, calculate the set of quadratic residues `S_m`.\n    c. Find the largest possible subset `R` of `{0, ..., m-1}` satisfying the condition `(R+R) mod m ∩ S_m = ∅`.\n    d. This can be found using a backtracking search algorithm. The search will find the largest set of \"compatible\" residues.\n    e. For each `m`, we get a potential density `c_m = |R|/m`. We keep track of the maximum `c` found.\n\n6.  **Implementation**: The Python code below implements this search. It will iterate through moduli `m` from 3 to 40, find the largest possible set `R` for each, compute the density `|R|/m`, and report the maximum density found. The backtracking algorithm is designed to find the maximum clique in the \"compatibility graph\" where vertices are residues and edges connect residues whose sums are not quadratic residues.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Store the details of the best result found\nbest_c = 0\nbest_m = 0\nbest_R = []\n\n# This is a global variable to be updated by the recursive search\n# It will store the largest compatible set R found for a given m\n_m_best_R = []\n\ndef find_largest_R_recursive(m, S_m, current_R, candidates):\n    \"\"\"\n    A recursive backtracking search to find the largest set R such that\n    R+R has no elements in S_m.\n    - m: the modulus\n    - S_m: the set of quadratic residues mod m\n    - current_R: the compatible set being built in the current recursion path\n    - candidates: the list of remaining candidates to try adding to current_R\n    \"\"\"\n    global _m_best_R\n    \n    # Pruning: if the current set plus all remaining candidates can't beat\n    # the best found so far, we can stop searching this path.\n    if len(current_R) + len(candidates) <= len(_m_best_R):\n        return\n\n    # If we are at a leaf of the search (no more candidates)\n    # or just found a better solution, update the best one.\n    if len(current_R) > len(_m_best_R):\n        _m_best_R = list(current_R)\n\n    # Iterate through remaining candidates\n    for i in range(len(candidates)):\n        node = candidates[i]\n        \n        # Check if this new node is compatible with the current_R set\n        is_compatible = True\n        for member in current_R:\n            if (member + node) % m in S_m:\n                is_compatible = False\n                break\n        \n        if is_compatible:\n            # If compatible, recurse deeper with the new node added\n            new_candidates = candidates[i+1:]\n            find_largest_R_recursive(m, S_m, current_R + [node], new_candidates)\n\n\ndef solve_for_modulus(m):\n    \"\"\"\n    For a given modulus m, finds the largest c = |R|/m.\n    \"\"\"\n    global _m_best_R\n    \n    # Step 1: Calculate the quadratic residues S_m\n    S_m = {x*x % m for x in range(m)}\n    \n    # Step 2: Pre-filter candidates.
