    "This is an interesting and complex line of Latin, often quoted by Cicero. It is not a dactylic hexameter but an iambic senarius (or iambic trimeter), which consists of six iambic feet. Scanning this line correctly requires handling multiple elisions (where a final vowel sound is dropped before an initial vowel sound) and metrical substitutions.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Elision:** The line contains two elisions which reduce its syllable count. First, the `-i` in `tibi` is elided before `bene`. Second, the `-e` in `bene` is elided before `esse`. This reduces the line to a rhythm of 13 syllables.\n2.  **Syllable Analysis:** I will determine the length of each of the 13 syllables. A syllable is long (L) if its vowel is naturally long, if it's a diphthong, or if it's \"long by position\" (the vowel is followed by two or more consonants). Otherwise, it is short (S). The final syllable of the line is always treated as long.\n3.  **Grouping into Feet:** I will group the resulting sequence of longs and shorts into six metrical feet. The standard foot in this meter is the iamb (S L), but substitutions like a spondee (L L) or an anapest (S S L) are common.\n4.  **Code Generation:** I will create a Python script that contains this analysis and prints the final scansion, with each syllable's length shown and a space separating each of the six feet.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Scans the provided Latin line, an iambic senarius, and prints the result.\n    The scansion is based on expert analysis, including elisions and metrical substitutions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The line is \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n    # After elision (tib(i) bene and ben(e) esse), the pronounced syllables and their quantities are:\n    \n    # Syllables with their determined quantities (L=long, S=short)\n    syllables = [\n        # Word: et\n        ('et', 'L'),  # Long by position before 't' of tibi\n        # Word: tibi (elided to tib)\n        ('tib', 'L'), # Long by position before 'b' of bene\n        # Word: bene (elided to ben)\n        ('ben', 'L'), # Long by position before 's' of esse\n        # Word: esse\n        ('es', 'L'),  # Long by position (ss)\n        ('se', 'S'),  # Naturally short\n        # Word: soli\n        ('so', 'L'),  # Naturally long 'o'\n        ('li', 'S'),  # Short 'i'\n        # Word: quom\n        ('quom', 'L'), # Long by position before 's' of sibi\n        # Word: sibi\n        ('si', 'S'),  # Naturally short\n        ('bi', 'S'),  # Naturally short (via iambic shortening)\n        # Word: sit\n        ('sit', 'L'), # Long by position before 'm' of male\n        # Word: male\n        ('ma', 'S'),  # Naturally short\n        ('le', 'L')   # Final syllable of the line, treated as long\n    ]\n    \n    # The meter is Iambic Senarius (6 feet).\n    # The 13 syllables are grouped into feet with metrical substitutions.\n    # Feet: Spondee | Spondee | Iamb | Iamb | Anapest | Iamb\n    foot_structure = [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n    \n    # Print the scansion with original words and foot breaks\n    print(\"Scansion of the line:\")\n    print(\"\\\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\\\"\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    syllable_pointer = 0\n    full_scansion_string = \"\"\n    # We still need to print the full equation as requested\n    final_equation_parts = []\n    \n    # 1.
