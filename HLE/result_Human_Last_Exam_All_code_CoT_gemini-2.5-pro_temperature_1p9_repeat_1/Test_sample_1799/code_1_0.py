    # Step 1: Explain the implication of Postulate 1
    print_wrapped("1. If we take Postulate 1 as our starting point, we must accept that *all* laws of physics work the same everywhere. This includes the laws of electromagnetism, which were summarized by Maxwell's equations.")

    # Step 2: Connect Postulate 1 to Maxwell's Equations
    print_wrapped("\n2. A key prediction that comes directly from solving Maxwell's equations is that electromagnetic waves (like light) travel at a constant speed in a vacuum. Let's call this speed 'c'. The value of 'c' is determined by two fundamental constants of nature: the vacuum permittivity and the vacuum permeability.")

    # Step 3: The "Derivation"
    print_wrapped("\n3. Therefore, if we assume Postulate 1 is true AND we assume Maxwell's equations are a correct law of physics, then it follows that the speed of light 'c' must be the same for all inertial observers. This seems to derive Postulate 2.")

    # Step 4: The Conclusion - Why it is NOT superfluous
    print("\nCONCLUSION: Why Postulate 2 is NOT superfluous")
    print("-" * 70)
    print_wrapped("Despite the logic above, Postulate 2 is not considered superfluous for several crucial reasons:")

    print_wrapped("\na) Logical Independence: Einstein's theory of relativity is more fundamental than Maxwell's theory. Einstein built his theory on two simple, independent kinematic principles. By postulating the constancy of 'c' directly, he made it clear that relativity would hold even if Maxwell's equations were later found to be only an approximation. It elevates the speed of light to a fundamental feature of spacetime itself.")

    print_wrapped("\nb) Resolving a Contradiction: In the context of 1905, physics was at a crossroads. Either the principle of relativity (Postulate 1) applied only to mechanics and not electromagnetism, OR our fundamental understanding of space and time (Galilean transformations) was wrong. By stating both postulates, Einstein made a clear and bold choice: the principle of relativity is universal AND the speed of light is constant, which forces us to abandon classical notions of space and time.")

    print_wrapped("\nc) Modern View: Later work showed that if you assume Postulate 1 plus general principles like the homogeneity and isotropy of space, you can derive that there must be a single, invariant speed for all observers. This speed could be infinite (leading to Galilean physics) or finite. Postulate 2 is the statement that this universal speed is finite and is, in fact, the speed of light.")

    print("\nFinal Answer: It is not true that the 2nd postulate is superfluous.")
