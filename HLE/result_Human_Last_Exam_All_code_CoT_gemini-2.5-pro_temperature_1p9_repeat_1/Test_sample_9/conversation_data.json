    "Answering this question involves identifying the topological space corresponding to the moduli space of lattices and then computing its first homology group.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the space X**: I will show that the moduli space $X$ of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area is topologically equivalent to the orbifold $\\mathbb{H} / PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, where $\\mathbb{H}$ is the upper half-plane and $PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the projective general linear group of 2x2 integer matrices.\n2.  **Relate Homology to Fundamental Group**: Since $\\mathbb{H}$ is contractible, $X$ is a classifying space for the group $PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This implies that the first homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X) \\cong PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n3.  **Compute the Abelianization**: I will compute the abelianization of $PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ by using its known semidirect product structure, $PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The abelianization of this semidirect product can be calculated from the abelianizations of its constituent groups and the action between them.\n4.  **Final Code**: The calculation involves finding the order of group of coinvariants which is a greatest common divisor (GCD) computation. I'll provide a Python script that walks through and prints the steps of this group-theoretic calculation.\n\n### Calculation Steps:\n\n1.  **The Space X**: A lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is determined by its \"shape\" and a scaling factor. The shape can be represented by a point $\\tau$ in the upper half-plane $\\mathbb{H}$. Two points $\\tau_1, \\tau_2 \\in \\mathbb{H}$ define the same lattice shape if and only if $\\tau_2 = g(\\tau_1)$ for some $g \\in PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The unit area constraint fixes the scaling factor for each shape but does not alter the topology of the space of shapes. Therefore, $X \\cong \\mathbb{H} / PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n2.  **First Homology Group**: For an orbifold like $X=\\mathbb{H}/G$ where $\\mathbb{H}$ is contractible, the first singular homology group is the abelianization of the orbifold fundamental group, which is $G$. Thus, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(X)^{\\text{ab}} = PGL(2, \\mathbb{Z})^{\\text{ab}}$.\n\n3.  **Abelianization of PGL(2,Z)**: We use the semidirect product decomposition $G = A \\rtimes B$ where $A = PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ and $B = \\mathbb{Z}_2$. The abelianization is given by $(A \\rtimes B)^{\\text{ab}} \\cong (A^{\\text{ab}})_B \\oplus B^{\\text{ab}}$.\n    *   The abelianization of $A=PSL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 * \\mathbb{Z}_3$ is $A^{\\text{ab}} = \\mathbb{Z}_6$.\n    *   The abelianization of $B=\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is $B^{\\text{ab}} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   The action of the non-trivial element of $B$ on $A^{\\text{ab}}=\\mathbb{Z}_6$ is multiplication by -1.\n    *   The group of coinvariants, $(A^{\\text{ab}})_B$, is the quotient of $\\mathbb{Z}_6$ by the subgroup generated by elements of the form $\\{k - (-k) | k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_6\\}$, which is the subgroup $2\\mathbb{Z}_6$.\n    *   Therefore, $(\\mathbb{Z}_6)_B = \\mathbb{Z}_6 / 2\\mathbb{Z}_6 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{\\text{gcd}(6,2)} = \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    *   Combining these parts, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe following Python code explains this final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Recap the problem's setup.\n# The moduli space X is H/PGL(2,Z).\n# The first homology group H_1(X, Z) is the abelianization of PGL(2, Z).\n\n# Step 2: Use the semidirect product structure.\n# PGL(2, Z) can be expressed as a semidirect product:\n# PGL(2, Z) = A ⋊ B, where A = PSL(2, Z) and B = Z_2.\n# The abelianization of a semidirect product is given by the formula:\n# (A ⋊ B)^ab = (A^ab)_B ⊕ B^ab\n\n# Step 3: Compute the components for the formula.\n# The abelianization of A = PSL(2, Z) is Z_6.\nn = 6\nprint(f\"The abelianization of A = PSL(2, Z) is Z_{n}.\")\n\n# The abelianization of B = Z_2 is Z_2 itself.\nm = 2\nprint(f\"The abelianization of B = Z_2 is Z_{m}.\")\n\n# Step 4: Compute the group of coinvariants, (A^ab)_B.\n# The action of B on A^ab = Z_n (where n=6) is by multiplication by -1.\n# The group of coinvariants (Z_n)_B is Z_n / (k - (-k) for k in Z_n)\n# which simplifies to Z_n / 2*Z_n.\n# The order of this quotient group is gcd(n, 2).\n\ncoinvariants_order = math.gcd(n, 2)\nprint(f\"The group of coinvariants (Z_{n})_B is Z_n / 2*Z_n, which is Z_{{{coinvariants_order}}}.\")\n\n# Step 5: Combine the results to get the final answer.\n# H_1(X, Z) = PGL(2, Z)^ab = (Z_6)_B ⊕ Z_2 = Z_2 ⊕ Z_2.\nprint(f\"\\nPutting it all together, the first homology group is:\")\nprint(f\"H_1(X, Z) = Z_{coinvariants_order} ⊕ Z_{m}\")\nfinal_answer = \"Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z\"\nprint(f\"So, H_1(X, Z) = {final_answer}\")\n\n```\n<<<Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z>>>"
