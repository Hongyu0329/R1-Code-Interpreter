# Step 1: Recap the problem's setup.
# The moduli space X is H/PGL(2,Z).
# The first homology group H_1(X, Z) is the abelianization of PGL(2, Z).

# Step 2: Use the semidirect product structure.
# PGL(2, Z) can be expressed as a semidirect product:
# PGL(2, Z) = A ⋊ B, where A = PSL(2, Z) and B = Z_2.
# The abelianization of a semidirect product is given by the formula:
# (A ⋊ B)^ab = (A^ab)_B ⊕ B^ab

# Step 3: Compute the components for the formula.
# The abelianization of A = PSL(2, Z) is Z_6.
n = 6
print(f"The abelianization of A = PSL(2, Z) is Z_{n}.")

# The abelianization of B = Z_2 is Z_2 itself.
m = 2
print(f"The abelianization of B = Z_2 is Z_{m}.")

# Step 4: Compute the group of coinvariants, (A^ab)_B.
# The action of B on A^ab = Z_n (where n=6) is by multiplication by -1.
# The group of coinvariants (Z_n)_B is Z_n / (k - (-k) for k in Z_n)
# which simplifies to Z_n / 2*Z_n.
# The order of this quotient group is gcd(n, 2).

coinvariants_order = math.gcd(n, 2)
print(f"The group of coinvariants (Z_{n})_B is Z_n / 2*Z_n, which is Z_{{{coinvariants_order}}}.")

# Step 5: Combine the results to get the final answer.
# H_1(X, Z) = PGL(2, Z)^ab = (Z_6)_B ⊕ Z_2 = Z_2 ⊕ Z_2.
print(f"\nPutting it all together, the first homology group is:")
print(f"H_1(X, Z) = Z_{coinvariants_order} ⊕ Z_{m}")
final_answer = "Z/2Z ⊕ Z/2Z"
print(f"So, H_1(X, Z) = {final_answer}")
