    "Of course. Here is the plan to construct the formula and then present it using a Python script.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Start with the fundamental definition:** The partition function `Z` in statistical mechanics is defined as the trace of the statistical operator, `Z = Tr(exp(-βH))`, where `β` is the inverse temperature and `H` is the Hamiltonian.\n2.  **Introduce Path Integrals:** Feynman's path integral formalism provides a way to rewrite this trace. The core idea is to express the time evolution operator `exp(-βH)` as an integral over all possible \"paths\" or field configurations in imaginary time `τ`.\n3.  **Account for Fermions:** Unlike bosons, fermions are described by anti-commuting numbers called Grassmann variables. This is essential to enforce the Pauli exclusion principle. The fields will be denoted by `ψ` and `ψ_bar`. The path integral is therefore an integral over these Grassmann fields.\n4.  **Impose Boundary Conditions:** The trace operation (`Tr`) in the original definition imposes specific boundary conditions on the fields in the imaginary time direction. For fermions, these are anti-periodic boundary conditions: `ψ(x, τ = β) = -ψ(x, τ = 0)`.\n5.  **Define the Euclidean Action (S_E):** The \"weight\" of each path in the integral is given by `exp(-S_E)`, where `S_E` is the Euclidean action. The action is derived from the system's Lagrangian by performing a Wick rotation to imaginary time (`t → -iτ`). For a general fermionic system, the action takes the form `S_E = ∫ dτ ∫ d³x ψ_bar * (∂_τ + H) * ψ`.\n6.  **Assemble the Final Formula:** By combining these elements, we arrive at the full expression for the fermionic partition function `Z`.\n7.  **Create a Python Script:** I will write a Python script that uses `print()` statements to display the complete formula, including definitions for all its components, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef print_fermionic_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The formula for the fermionic partition function Z using the path integral formalism in imaginary time is:\")\n    print(\"\\n    Z = ∫ D[ψ_bar] D[ψ] * exp(-S_E[ψ_bar, ψ])\\n\")\n    print(\"This equation can be broken down as follows:\")\n\n    print(\"\\n1.
