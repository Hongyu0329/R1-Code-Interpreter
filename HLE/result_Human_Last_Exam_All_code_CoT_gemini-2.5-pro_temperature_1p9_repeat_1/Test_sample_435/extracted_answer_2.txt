Given its role in promoting T cell survival, proliferation, and fitness, interleukin-15 would be predicted to increase cytokine release in CAR T cells upon antigen stimulation when compared to T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is because IL-15 culture yields a more persistent and functionally potent CAR T cell product.
