    "To solve this problem, we can visualize the two cubes in a 3D coordinate system.\n\n### My Plan\n1.  **Define the First Cube:** I will place the first unit cube (side length 1) in a standard position in the coordinate system, with one corner at the origin (0,0,0). This cube, let's call it C1, occupies the space where `0 <= x <= 1`, `0 <= y <= 1`, and `0 <= z <= 1`.\n2.  **Define the Shift:** The problem states a shift of 1/2 \"along the main diagonal\". For a unit cube positioned as described, the main diagonal connects (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). A shift of 1/2 along this diagonal can be interpreted as a displacement vector of `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`.\n3.  **Define the Second Cube:** Applying this shift to the first cube gives us the second cube, C2. It occupies the space where `0 + 1/2 <= x <= 1 + 1/2`, `0 + 1/2 <= y <= 1 + 1/2`, and `0 + 1/2 <= z <= 1 + 1/2`. So, C2's coordinates are in the range `[1/2, 3/2]` for all three axes.\n4.  **Find the Intersection:** The intersection is the volume that is part of both C1 and C2. To find this, we find the overlap in the coordinate ranges for each axis:\n    *   **x-axis:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`. The length is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n    *   **y-axis:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`. The length is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n    *   **z-axis:** The overlap between `[0, 1]` and `[1/2, 3/2]` is `[1/2, 1]`. The length is `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n5.  **Calculate the Volume:** The intersection is a smaller cube with a side length of 1/2. The volume of this cube is `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2)`. I will write a Python script to formalize this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cube_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two unit cubes\n    shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The side length of each original cube.\n    side_length = 1.0\n\n    # We interpret the shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" as a shift\n    # of 1/2 along each of the x, y, and z axes.\n    shift_along_axis = 0.5\n\n    # The first cube (C1) can be defined in the region:\n    # 0 <= x <= 1, 0 <= y <= 1, 0 <= z <= 1.\n    \n    # The second cube (C2) is shifted from C1 and occupies the region:\n    # 0.5 <= x <= 1.5, 0.5 <= y <= 1.5, 0.5 <= z <= 1.5.\n\n    # The intersection is a smaller cube. Its side length is determined\n    # by the overlap of the cubes' ranges on any axis.\n    # The overlap of [0, 1] and [0.5, 1.5] is [0.5, 1].\n    # The length of this overlapping interval is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.\n    intersection_side_length = side_length - shift_along_axis\n\n    # The volume of the intersection is the cube of its side length.\n    volume = intersection_side_length ** 3\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the problem.\")\n    print(f\"Two cubes of side length {side_length} are shifted relative to each other.\")\n    print(f\"The shift along each axis is {shift_along_axis}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Find the dimensions of the intersection.\")\n    print(f\"The intersection forms a smaller cube.
