    "Of course. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using a backtracking algorithm. Here is my plan to find a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D Manhattan lattice.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Model the Lattice Walk**: A walk can be represented as a sequence of coordinates `(x, y)` on a 2D grid. We can start the walk at a fixed origin, say `(0, 0)`, without loss of generality, as the lattice is infinite and symmetrical.\n2.  **Self-Avoiding Constraint**: The key constraint is that the walk cannot visit the same coordinate more than once. We'll need an efficient way to keep track of the points visited in the current path. A `set` is ideal for this, as it provides fast O(1) average time complexity for checking if a point has been visited.\n3.  **Recursive Backtracking Algorithm**: I will implement a recursive function to explore all possible paths.\n    *   The function will take the number of steps remaining, the current position, and the set of visited points as arguments.\n    *   **Base Case**: If the number of remaining steps is 0, it means we have successfully found a complete 10-step walk. We count this as one valid walk and return `1`.\n    *   **Recursive Step**: From the current position, the function will look at the four possible neighbors (North, East, South, West). For each neighbor, it checks if it has already been visited.\n        *   If the neighbor is a new point, the function will:\n            1.  Add the neighbor to the `visited` set.\n            2.  Make a recursive call for a walk with one less step from this new position.\n            3.  Add the result of the recursive call to a running total.\n            4.  **Backtrack**: Remove the neighbor from the `visited` set. This is a crucial step to allow other paths to explore that point.\n4.  **Final Calculation**: The initial call to the recursive function will start with `n=10`, position `(0, 0)`, and a `visited` set containing only `(0, 0)`. The value returned by this top-level call will be the answer, a(10).\n5.  **Output**: The final code will calculate the value for n=10 and print it in the format `a(10) = <result>`.\n\nThis approach systematically explores every possible self-avoiding walk of length 10 and counts them. For n=10, this is computationally feasible.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_a_n():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints a(n), the number of n-step self-avoiding walks \n    on a 2D square lattice (Manhattan lattice).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of steps for the walk.\n    n = 10\n    \n    # We use a set to keep track of visited coordinates for efficient lookups.\n    # The walk starts at the origin (0, 0).\n    visited = {(0, 0)}\n    \n    # Start the recursive counting process from the origin.\n    result = _count_recursive(n, (0, 0), visited)\n    \n    # As requested, the script prints the final result.
