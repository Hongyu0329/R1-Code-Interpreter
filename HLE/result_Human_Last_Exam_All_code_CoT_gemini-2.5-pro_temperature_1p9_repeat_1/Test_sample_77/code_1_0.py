    print("  - Domain: You've described it as a large container that also acts as a barrier. This is the correct and essential function of a domain object. It defines the simulation space and contains the fluid.
    - Inflow (Fluid Emitter): A small sphere suspended in the center is a standard way to introduce fluid into a scene. Its role is to continuously generate fluid particles. This is a correct setup.
    - Obstacle (Plane): A plane in midair to interact with the fluid is a classic effector object. Its purpose is to collide with the fluid, altering its path. This is also a correct setup.

    print("\n2. Expected Interaction (Simulation Flow):")
    print("  - The Inflow sphere will begin emitting fluid.")
    print("  - Standard gravity will pull the generated fluid downwards.")
    print("  - The falling fluid will collide with the Obstacle plane, causing it to splash and flow across the plane's surface and off its edges.")
    print("  - The fluid will continue to fall until it reaches the bottom boundary of the Domain, where it will collect and pool.")

    print("\n3. Conclusion:")
    print("  Yes, all components are described with their correct functions and the setup is completely valid.")
    print("  This configuration will create a functioning simulation where a stream of fluid falls, hits an obstacle, and is contained within a box.")
