    This function analyzes the topological space X and determines the number of
    connected components after the origin is removed.

    The space is defined by points and the line segments connecting them to the origin:
    - p = (1, 0)
    - p_n = (1, 1/n) for n = 1, 2, ...
    - L is the segment from p to (0,0).
    - L_n is the segment from p_n to (0,0).
    - X = L U L_1 U L_2 U ...

    When the origin (0,0) is removed from X, the resulting space X' is analyzed.

    - Each punctured segment L_n' = L_n - {(0,0)} can be shown to be both open and
      closed in the subspace topology of X'. Since each L_n' is connected,
      it forms its own connected component.

    - This gives a sequence of components: L_1', L_2', L_3', ... which is
      an infinite number of components.

    - The remaining set, L' = L - {(0,0)}, is also connected and forms its
      own component.

    Thus, the total number of connected components is infinite.
    """
    # The number of components from the L_n' segments is infinite.
