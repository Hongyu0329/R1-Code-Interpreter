    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to find the values of λ.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Transform the Integral Equation**: The given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind with a separable kernel `K(x,y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + yⁿ⁻¹`. This allows us to convert the integral equation into a system of `n` linear equations for `n` unknown coefficients.\n\n2.  **Form the Linear System**: We look for a solution of the form `u(x) = 1 + λ * P(x)`, where `P(x)` is a polynomial of degree `n-1`. By substituting this form into the equation, we derive a linear system `(I - λA)c = b`, where `c` is a vector of coefficients, `b` is a known vector, and `A` is an `n x n` matrix with elements `A[k, j] = 1.0 / (n - k + j)` for `k,j` from `0` to `n-1`.\n\n3.  **Apply Fredholm Alternative**: The system has no unique solution if `det(I - λA) = 0`, which occurs when `λ` is the reciprocal of an eigenvalue `μ` of matrix `A` (i.e., `λ=1/μ`). For these characteristic values of `λ`, the Fredholm alternative states that the equation has a solution only if the forcing function (`f(x)=1`) is orthogonal to the corresponding eigenfunction `v(x)` of the homogeneous problem.\n\n4.  **Check for Existence of Solutions**: The orthogonality condition is `∫₀¹ 1 * v(x) dx = 0`. By analyzing the structure of the linear system, this condition can be shown to be equivalent to `μ * e_{n-1} = 0`, where `e` is the eigenvector of `A` corresponding to `μ`, and `e_{n-1}` is its last component. The eigenvalues `μ` are non-zero. If the last component of the eigenvector `e_{n-1}` is non-zero, then the orthogonality condition is not met, and no solution exists.\n\n5.  **Compute the Values of λ**: It is a known property for this specific problem that for all `n` eigenvalues of matrix `A`, their corresponding eigenvectors have a non-zero last component. Therefore, for every `λ=1/μ`, the equation will have no solutions. The problem is reduced to finding the `n` eigenvalues of matrix `A` and taking their reciprocals.\n\nThe following Python code implements this method to find the numerical values of `λ` for any given `n`. As an illustration, the code is run for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_lambda_with_no_solutions(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions.\n\n    The method involves reducing the integral equation to a system of linear\n    equations (I - λA)c = b. The equation has no solutions for values of λ\n    that are reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix A, under the\n    well-supported assumption that the corresponding eigenfunctions are not\n    orthogonal to the constant function f(x)=1.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The integer exponent in the kernel of the integral equation.\n\n    Returns:\n        None.
