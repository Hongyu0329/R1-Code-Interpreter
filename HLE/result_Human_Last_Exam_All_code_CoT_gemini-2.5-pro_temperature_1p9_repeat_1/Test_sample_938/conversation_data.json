    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Limit**: The problem asks for the value of $L = 10^{4}\\cdot\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n}$. The behavior of $s_n$ for large $n$ is dictated by its fastest-growing terms.\n2.  **Asymptotic Behavior**: The sequence $a_n$ is a linear recurrence, so for large $n$, its value is approximated by $a_n \\approx C \\cdot \\lambda^n$, where $\\lambda$ is the root of the characteristic equation with the largest absolute value (the dominant root) and $C$ is a constant. The terms within the sum $s_n$ involve $a_k$ and products like $a_k a_j$. A term like $a_{k+p}a_{k+q}$ will grow approximately as $(C\\lambda^{k+p})(C\\lambda^{k+q}) = C^2 \\lambda^{2k+p+q}$. This growth is much faster than terms like $a_{2k-3}$, which grows as $C\\lambda^{2k-3}$. The entire sum $s_n$ will be dominated by the product terms, and its overall growth will be of the order $\\lambda^{2n}$.\n3.  **Evaluate the Limit**: Based on the asymptotic behavior $s_n \\sim K \\cdot (\\lambda^2)^n = K \\cdot \\lambda^{2n}$ for some constant $K$, the limit is:\n    $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(K \\cdot \\lambda^{2n})}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(K) + 2n \\ln(\\lambda)}{n} = 2\\ln(\\lambda)$.\n4.  **Find the Dominant Root**: The main task is to find the dominant root of the characteristic equation corresponding to the recurrence $a_{n}=88a_{n-3}+57a_{n-4}$. The characteristic equation is $r^4 - 88r - 57 = 0$.\n5.  **Solve the Equation**: I will factor this polynomial to find its roots.\n    The polynomial $r^4 - 88r - 57$ can be factored into $(r^2 - 4r - 3)(r^2 + 4r + 19) = 0$.\n    The roots of these two quadratic equations are:\n    *   For $r^2 - 4r - 3 = 0$, the roots are $r = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-4(-3)}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\n    *   For $r^2 + 4r + 19 = 0$, the roots are $r = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-4(19)}}{2} = -2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}$.\n6.  **Identify the Dominant Root**: Now, I will compare the magnitudes of these roots:\n    *   $|2 + \\sqrt{7}| \\approx 2 + 2.646 = 4.646$.\n    *   $|2 - \\sqrt{7}| = \\sqrt{7} - 2 \\approx 0.646$.\n    *   $|-2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}| = \\sqrt{(-2)^2 + (\\sqrt{15})^2} = \\sqrt{4 + 15} = \\sqrt{19} \\approx 4.359$.\n    The root with the largest magnitude is $\\lambda = 2 + \\sqrt{7}$.\n7.  **Final Calculation**: With the dominant root found, I can compute the final value. The problem asks for the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot 2 \\ln(2 + \\sqrt{7})$. I will use Python to perform this calculation with high precision.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the integer part of 10^4 * lim(ln(s_n)/n).\n    The limit is determined by the dominant root of the characteristic equation\n    of the recurrence relation for a_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The value of the dominant root, lambda = 2 + sqrt(7).\n    dominant_root = 2 + math.sqrt(7)\n    \n    # The limit is 2 * ln(lambda).\n    limit_value = 2 * math.log(dominant_root)\n    \n    # The quantity we need to evaluate.\n    final_value = 10000 * limit_value\n    \n    # The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.\n    # The final equation is 10000 * 2 * ln(2 + sqrt(7)).\n    val_10000 = 10000\n    val_2 = 2\n    sqrt_7 = math.sqrt(7)\n    \n    print(f\"The equation to be calculated is: {val_10000} * {val_2} * ln(2 + {sqrt_7})\")\n    print(f\"The result of the calculation is: {final_value}\")\n    \n    integer_part = int(final_value)\n    print(f\"The integer part of the result is: {integer_part}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<30719>>>"
