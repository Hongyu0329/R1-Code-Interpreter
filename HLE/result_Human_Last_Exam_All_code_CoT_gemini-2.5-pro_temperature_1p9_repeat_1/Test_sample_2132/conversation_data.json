    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** The Favorskii rearrangement of an α-halo ketone like 2-chlorocyclohexanone in the presence of a base results in a ring contraction. The 6-membered cyclohexanone ring rearranges to form a 5-membered ring with a carboxylic acid group. Therefore, the product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (molecular formula C₆H₁₀O₂).\n2.  **Understand Böttcher Molecular Complexity:** We will use the Böttcher Molecular Complexity formula:\n    `Complexity = (N_A * N_B * log₂(N_A * N_B)) / N_stereo`\n3.  **Calculate the Parameters for the Product:**\n    *   `N_A` (Number of non-hydrogen atoms): Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C₆H₁₀O₂) has 6 carbon atoms and 2 oxygen atoms. So, `N_A = 8`.\n    *   `N_B` (Number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms): We count the bonds in the hydrogen-suppressed graph. This includes 5 C-C bonds in the cyclopentane ring, 1 C-C bond connecting the ring to the carboxyl group, and 2 bonds within the carboxyl group (C-O and C=O). So, `N_B = 8`.\n    *   `N_stereo` (Number of stereoisomers): The carbon atom on the cyclopentane ring that is attached to the carboxylic acid group is a chiral center. This means there are `2¹ = 2` possible stereoisomers (R and S). So, `N_stereo = 2`.\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** We will substitute these values into the formula and compute the final complexity value using a Python script. The script will also display the final equation with all the calculated numbers.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script calculates the Böttcher Molecular Complexity for the product of the\n# Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the product and its properties\nproduct_name = \"cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\"\n# N_A: Number of non-hydrogen atoms (6 Carbons + 2 Oxygens)\nN_A = 8\n# N_B: Number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms (5 in ring + 1 link + 2 in COOH)\nN_B = 8\n# N_stereo: Number of stereoisomers (1 chiral center -> 2^1 stereoisomers)\nN_stereo = 2\n\n# Print an explanation of the process\nprint(f\"The product is {product_name}.\")\nprint(\"To find its Böttcher Molecular Complexity, we use the formula:\")\nprint(\"Complexity = (N_A * N_B * log₂(N_A * N_B)) / N_stereo\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Calculating the parameters:\")\nprint(f\"Number of non-hydrogen atoms (N_A) = {N_A}\")\nprint(f\"Number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms (N_B) = {N_B}\")\nprint(f\"Number of stereoisomers (N_stereo) = {N_stereo}\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Perform the calculation\nN_A_times_N_B = N_A * N_B\nlog_value = math.log2(N_A_times_N_B)\ncomplexity = (N_A_times_N_B * log_value) / N_stereo\n\n# Step 3: Display the final equation and result\n# We use int() to show clean integer values where appropriate\nprint(\"Final equation with values:\")\nprint(f\"({N_A} * {N_B} * log₂({N_A_times_N_B})) / {N_stereo} = ({N_A_times_N_B} * {int(log_value)}) / {N_stereo} = {int(complexity)}\")\n\n```\n<<<192>>>"
