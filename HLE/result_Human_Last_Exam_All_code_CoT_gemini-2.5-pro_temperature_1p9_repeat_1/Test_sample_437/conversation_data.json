    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to evaluate the given quantum mechanical integral, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Orbital:** The integral involves a $1s$ Slater-type orbital (STO). The mathematical form of this orbital, centered at the origin, is $\\phi_{1s}(r) = N e^{-\\zeta r}$, where $r$ is the radial distance, $\\zeta$ is the orbital exponent, and $N$ is the normalization constant.\n2.  **Determine the Normalization Constant:** Before evaluating the main integral, we must first normalize the orbital. The normalization condition is $\\int |\\phi_{1s}|^2 d\\tau = 1$, where the integral is taken over all space. I will solve this integral in spherical coordinates ($d\\tau = r^2 \\sin\\theta \\, dr \\, d\\theta \\, d\\phi$) to find the expression for $N$ in terms of $\\zeta$.\n3.  **Set Up the Expectation Value Integral:** The integral to evaluate is $\\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle$. In its explicit form, this is $\\int \\phi_{1s}^* \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\phi_{1s} \\, d\\tau$. Since the orbital is real, this is equivalent to $\\int (\\phi_{1s})^2 \\frac{1}{r} \\, d\\tau$.\n4.  **Symbolic Calculation:** I will use Python's `sympy` library to carry out the integration symbolically. This allows us to get a general result in terms of the orbital exponent $\\zeta$. The code will perform the integrations for both normalization and the final expectation value by separating them into their radial and angular parts.\n5.  **Display the Result:** The script will print the components of the final calculation—the squared normalization constant ($N^2$), the radial part of the integral, and the angular part of the integral—before showing the final simplified result, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef evaluate_slater_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically evaluates the integral <phi_1s | 1/r | phi_1s>\n    for a normalized 1s Slater-Type Orbital (STO).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define symbolic variables\n    # r: radial distance\n    # zeta: orbital exponent\n    r = sp.symbols('r', real=True, positive=True)\n    zeta = sp.symbols('zeta', real=True, positive=True, nonzero=True)\n    \n    # We work in spherical coordinates.
