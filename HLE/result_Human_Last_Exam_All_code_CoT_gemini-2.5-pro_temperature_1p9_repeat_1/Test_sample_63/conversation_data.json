    "My plan is to solve this riddle by first identifying the person described by Kurt Vonnegut. I will use the key phrase \"looks like a porcupine\" and its connection to the author to find the subject. Once the person is identified, I will verify that their name consists of two words that begin with the same letter. Finally, I will provide a Python script that prints the full name as the answer.\n\n```python\n# The person Kurt Vonnegut described as looking like a porcupine\n# in all his pictures is the composer Burt Bacharach.\n# The two words in his name, \"Burt\" and \"Bacharach,\" both start with the letter 'B'.\n\nfirst_name = \"Burt\"\nlast_name = \"Bacharach\"\n\n# Printing the final answer\nprint(first_name + \" \" + last_name)\n```\n<<<Burt Bacharach>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    As Kurt Vonnegut noted, this man looks like a porcupine in all the pictures.
