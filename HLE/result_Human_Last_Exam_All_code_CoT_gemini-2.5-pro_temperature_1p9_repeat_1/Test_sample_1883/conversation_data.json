    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory:** The reaction is an electrocyclization of a conjugated polyene. The reactant, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene, has a conjugated system of 8 π-electrons. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, derived from FMO theory, a system with 4n π-electrons (where n=2) under thermal conditions undergoes a **conrotatory** ring closure.\n\n2.  **Analyze Product Formation:** The stereochemistry of the product depends on the starting positions of the substituents on the terminal carbons (C2 and C9) and the mode of ring closure (conrotatory).\n    *   The configuration of a double bond determines if a substituent is on the \"inside\" or \"outside\" of the helical coil needed for cyclization. A `(Z)`-bond places the main chain substituent \"in\", while an `(E)`-bond places it \"out\".\n    *   In the reactant, the methyl group at C2 is on a `(Z)`-double bond, so it is **in**. The methyl group at C9 is on an `(E)`-double bond, so it is **out**.\n    *   For a conrotatory closure, substituents starting in an `(in, out)` configuration result in a **cis** product. Thus, the reactant directly yields the *cis*-isomer **A**.\n\n3.  **Account for the *trans*-Isomer B:** The formation of the *trans*-isomer **B** implies another pathway. The allowed conrotatory closure can only produce a *trans* product if the methyl groups start in an `(in, in)` configuration. This would require the reactant to first isomerize to the \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8Z)\\)-isomer. We assume a rapid thermal equilibrium between the `8E` and `8Z` isomers.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio:** According to the Curtin-Hammett principle, the product ratio depends on the difference in the free energies of the transition states leading to A and B (`ΔΔG‡ = G‡(B) - G‡(A)`). This energy difference is dominated by steric strain.\n    *   The transition state to form **A** has one \"in\" methyl group, which causes some steric strain.\n    *   The transition state to form **B** has two \"in\" methyl groups, causing significantly more steric strain.\n    *   The energy difference, `ΔΔG‡`, is therefore approximately the steric penalty of one \"in\" methyl group clashing with the polyene chain. A standard literature value for this strain is about **7.0 kJ/mol**.\n\n5.  **Use the Boltzmann Distribution:** The ratio of the products A/B is given by `exp(ΔΔG‡ / RT)`. We will assume a standard temperature for \"thermal conditions\" of 100°C (373.15 K) and use the ideal gas constant R. The code below will carry out this final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Calculation of the Product Ratio A/B ---\n\n# This script calculates the ratio of cis-isomer A to trans-isomer B\n# based on the principles of FMO theory and the Curtin-Hammett principle.\n\n# Define the constants for the calculation.\n# ΔΔG‡: The difference in activation free energy between the pathways leading to\n# products A and B.
