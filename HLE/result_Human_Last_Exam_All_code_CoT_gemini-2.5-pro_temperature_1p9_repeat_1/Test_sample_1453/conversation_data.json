    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence, we will analyze its primary sequence to identify the characteristic heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The identity of the amino acids at the core `a` and `d` positions, which are responsible for the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, is the primary determinant of the number of helices in the coiled-coil.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Register:** We'll analyze the sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` to find the correct `abcdefg` assignment. The most stable arrangement is the one that places hydrophobic residues (like L, I, V, A, M, W) at the core `a` and `d` positions.\n2.  **Assign and Extract Residues:** Once the register is found, we will programmatically assign each amino acid to its heptad position and extract the residues at the key `a`, `d`, `e`, and `g` positions.\n3.  **Analyze Core Residues:** We will examine the residues at the `a` and `d` positions. The size and hydrophobicity of these residues dictate the packing efficiency for different oligomeric states:\n    *   **Dimers (2 helices):** Favor large, bulky hydrophobic residues (like L, I) at both `a` and `d` positions for optimal knobs-into-holes packing.\n    *   **Trimers (3 helices):** The core is more crowded, so they often have a large hydrophobic residue at `d` but require a smaller residue (like A, V) at the `a` position.\n    *   **Tetramers (4 helices):** The core is even more crowded, typically requiring small hydrophobic residues (like A) at both positions, or utilizing charged residues for stabilization.\n4.  **Conclude:** Based on the analysis, we will determine the most likely oligomeric state.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_coiled_coil(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state.\n\n    The prediction is based on the identity of amino acids at the core 'a' and 'd'\n    positions of the heptad repeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Identify the Heptad Register ---\n    # The key to coiled-coils is the heptad repeat (a-b-c-d-e-f-g).\n    # 'a' and 'd' positions are typically hydrophobic and form the core.\n    # We must find the register that maximizes this hydrophobicity.\n    # By inspection, the sequence has Leucines (L) and Isoleucines (I) repeating\n    # at regular intervals.
