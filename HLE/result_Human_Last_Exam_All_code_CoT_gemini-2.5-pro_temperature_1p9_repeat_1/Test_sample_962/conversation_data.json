    "Of course. Designing a secure and efficient threshold signature scheme is a complex task in cryptography. The current state-of-the-art approach for a two-round scheme is based on the **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold)** protocol.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Introduce the Scheme**: I will describe the FROST protocol, which is specifically designed to be a tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a signing protocol that consists of only two rounds. It's an enhancement of the standard Schnorr signature algorithm.\n\n2.  **Explain the Phases**: I will break down the design into its three main phases:\n    *   **Key Generation (Trusted Dealer Setup)**: A one-time setup where a central dealer creates a master secret and distributes secret shares to `n` participants. For a truly decentralized system, this can be replaced by a more complex Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol.\n    *   **Signing (Two Rounds)**: This is the core of your request.\n        *   **Round 1 (Commitment)**: Before a message is known, participants generate and exchange nonces (random numbers) and their commitments. This \"pre-processing\" round makes the actual signing very fast.\n        *   **Round 2 (Signature Share Generation)**: Once a message needs to be signed, participants use their nonces and secret shares to compute a final partial signature.\n    *   **Aggregation and Verification**: The partial signatures are combined into a single, standard Schnorr signature, which can be verified by anyone using the group's single public key.\n\n3.  **Provide a Python Demonstration**: I will write a Python script to simulate this process.\n    *   **Important Note**: This code is a simplified demonstration for educational purposes. It uses small numbers and a trusted dealer for clarity. **It is not cryptographically secure and must not be used in a production environment.** Real-world implementations require large prime numbers and secure elliptic curve cryptography libraries.\n    *   The code will simulate a **2-out-of-3** scheme (`t=2, n=3`), where participants 1 and 3 collaborate to sign a message.\n    *   It will print all the numerical values involved in the key generation, signing, and final verification steps, as you requested.\n\nHere is the Python code demonstrating the process.\n\n```python\nimport hashlib\nimport random\n\n# WARNING: This is a simplified educational demonstration.\n# DO NOT USE THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION.\n# Real-world cryptography requires large primes, secure random number\n# generation, and elliptic curve groups.\n\n# --- 1.
