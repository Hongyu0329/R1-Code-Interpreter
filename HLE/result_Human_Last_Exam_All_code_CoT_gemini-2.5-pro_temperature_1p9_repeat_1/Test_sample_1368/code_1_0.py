# The final sequence is constructed by following the geometric steps outlined above.
# 1. Draw a line to find the opposite point C: L
# 2. Draw two circles to define the perpendicular bisector: C, C
# 3. Draw the perpendicular bisector to find vertices B and D: L
# 4. Draw the four sides of the square: L, L, L, L
# The full sequence is the concatenation of these commands.

# Print the final construction sequence.
# The user prompt mentions "output each number in the final equation",
# which seems to be a mistake. We will print the sequence characters.
