# We need to calculate the value of x(t) at t = 2*sqrt(3).
# Based on the analysis, the trajectory is given by x(t) = x(0) - t^2 / 4.
t = 2 * np.sqrt(3)

# The initial condition x(0) is given by a complex expression.
# x(0) = 3 + (6**(1/3)) * ((3 - 3**(1/2))**(1/3) + (3 + 3**(1/2))**(1/3))
# Let's calculate x(t) step by step, showing all the numbers.

# First, calculate x(0)
sqrt3 = np.sqrt(3)
# Part of the expression for x(0)
term_in_x0 = np.cbrt(6) * (np.cbrt(3 - sqrt3) + np.cbrt(3 + sqrt3))
x0 = 3 + term_in_x0

# Now, calculate the value of t^2 / 4
t_squared_over_4 = t**2 / 4

# The final position is x(t) = x(0) - t^2 / 4
xt = x0 - t_squared_over_4

# The problem can be simplified as x(2*sqrt(3)) = y, where
# y = (18 - 6*sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (18 + 6*sqrt(3))^(1/3).
# Let's verify that our xt is equal to y.
term1_y = 18 - 6 * sqrt3
term2_y = 18 + 6 * sqrt3
y1 = np.cbrt(term1_y)
y2 = np.cbrt(term2_y)
y = y1 + y2

# We print the final equation with all its components.
print("The final position x(t) is calculated from the equation: x(t) = x(0) - t^2 / 4")
print(f"Given t = 2*sqrt(3), the term t^2 / 4 evaluates to: {t_squared_over_4:.1f}")
print(f"The initial position x(0) is: {x0:.15f}")
print(f"So the equation is: x(2*sqrt(3)) = {x0:.15f} - {t_squared_over_4:.1f}")
print(f"The result is: {xt:.15f}")
print("\nThis simplifies to calculating y = (18 - 6*sqrt(3))^(1/3) + (18 + 6*sqrt(3))^(1/3)")
print(f"The first term is ({term1_y:.15f})^(1/3) = {y1:.15f}")
print(f"The second term is ({term2_y:.15f})^(1/3) = {y2:.15f}")
print(f"The final answer is the sum: {y1:.15f} + {y2:.15f} = {y:.15f}")
