def solve_for_R():
    """
    Calculates the value of R based on the derived solvability condition.

    The solvability condition for the given boundary value problem leads to a
    constraint on the initial values (c1, c2, c3) of the zeroth-order solution:
    c1^2 + c2^2 + c3^2 = R^2

    where R^2 is given by:
    R^2 = alpha / (1 - exp(-T))

    Given:
    T = ln(10^34)
    alpha = (1/2) * (exp(2*T) - 1)

    Substituting these values and simplifying gives the expression:
    R^2 = 0.5 * (10^34 + 1) * 10^34

    Standard floating-point arithmetic is not precise enough for this calculation,
    as numbers of the magnitude 10^34 would lead to rounding errors.
    For example, float(10**34 + 1) is indistinguishable from float(10**34).
    Therefore, we use the `decimal` module for high-precision arithmetic.
