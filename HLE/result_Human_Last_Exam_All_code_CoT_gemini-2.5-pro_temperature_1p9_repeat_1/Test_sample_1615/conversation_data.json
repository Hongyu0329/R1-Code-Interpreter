    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, with the condition that $G$ is not a complete graph.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Chromatic Number:** The chromatic number of a graph, $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring, where no two adjacent vertices share the same color. For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$. This upper bound is achieved by the complete graph $K_n$, for which $\\chi(K_n) = n$.\n\n2.  **Incorporate the Constraint:** The problem states that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. Let $n = 12345$. We are given that $G \\neq K_{12345}$. We need to find the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$.\n\n3.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** A key theorem in graph theory states that if a graph $G$ has a chromatic number of $n$, then $G$ must be the complete graph $K_n$ (more formally, it must contain a $K_n$ minor, which for an n-vertex graph implies being $K_n$). Since we are given that $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number cannot be $n$. Therefore, $\\chi(G)$ must be strictly less than $n$. The highest integer value less than $n$ is $n-1$. So, we have the upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le n - 1$. For our case, $\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n4.  **Show the Bound is Achievable (Tightness):** To prove that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we must demonstrate that there exists at least one graph with $n$ vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of exactly $n-1$.\n    Consider the following construction: Take a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, $K_{n-1}$, and add a single, separate vertex.\n    *   This graph has $(n-1) + 1 = n$ vertices.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the single vertex is not connected to the other $n-1$ vertices.\n    *   The subgraph $K_{n-1}$ requires $n-1$ colors. The single vertex can be colored with one of these colors as it is not adjacent to any of them. Thus, the chromatic number of the entire graph is $n-1$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We have shown that the chromatic number for any non-complete graph with $n$ vertices cannot exceed $n-1$, and we have constructed a graph that achieves this bound. Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$.\n\nNow, let's write a simple Python script to calculate this for $n=12345$.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors for a non-complete graph with n vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n\n    # According to graph theory, for any graph G with n vertices that is not a\n    # complete graph, the chromatic number chi(G) is at most n-1.\n    # This bound is tight, as a graph consisting of a complete graph on n-1\n    # vertices and one isolated vertex requires n-1 colors.\n    #\n    # So, the maximum number of colors is n - 1.\n\n    max_colors = n - 1\n\n    print(f\"Let n be the number of vertices, n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The graph is not a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"The maximum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of such a graph is n - 1.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n    print(f\"So, the maximum number of colours is {max_colors}.\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
