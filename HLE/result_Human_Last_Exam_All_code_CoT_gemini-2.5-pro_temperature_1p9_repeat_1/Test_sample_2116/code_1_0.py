# The problem is to find the expected maximum earthquake magnitude.
# Through mathematical derivation, the final expression for this expectation is found to be:
# E[Max Magnitude] = pi / (2 * ln(2))

# Here, we will calculate this value.

# Define the constants from the derived formula.
pi_val = math.pi
ln2_val = math.log(2)

# Calculate the final value based on the formula.
expected_max_magnitude = pi_val / (2 * ln2_val)

# Print the components of the equation and the final result.
print("The analytical solution for the expected maximum earthquake magnitude is pi / (2 * ln(2)).")
