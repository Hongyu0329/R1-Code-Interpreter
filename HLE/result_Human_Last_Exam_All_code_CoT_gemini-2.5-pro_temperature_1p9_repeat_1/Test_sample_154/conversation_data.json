    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we can follow a systematic approach using Python's `networkx` library.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Generate a base set of graphs:** We need all unique (nonisomorphic) simple graphs with 5 vertices. The `networkx` library provides a \"graph atlas\" which contains all connected nonisomorphic graphs with up to 7 vertices. This is a perfect starting point, as any 2-vertex-connected graph must also be connected.\n2.  **Filter for 5-vertex graphs:** We will select only the graphs from the atlas that have exactly 5 vertices.\n3.  **Check for 2-vertex-connectivity:** A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. The `networkx` function `nx.node_connectivity(G)` calculates the minimum number of vertices that must be removed to disconnect a graph `G`. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if this value is 2 or greater.\n4.  **Group and count:** To provide a detailed answer, we will group the graphs that pass the test by their number of edges.\n5.  **Format the output:** We will sum the counts for each group and present the result as an equation, as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve_graph_counting():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of 2-vertex-connected simple\n    nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary to store the counts of biconnected graphs, keyed by their number of edges.\n    biconnected_counts_by_edges = defaultdict(int)\n\n    # 1. & 2. Get all nonisomorphic connected graphs with 5 vertices from the networkx atlas.\n    # The atlas contains all connected simple graphs with 3 to 7 vertices.\n    all_atlas_graphs = nx.graph_atlas_g()\n    graphs_n5 = [g for g in all_atlas_graphs if g.number_of_nodes() == 5]\n\n    # 3. Iterate through the 5-vertex graphs and check for 2-vertex-connectivity.\n    for g in graphs_n5:\n        # A graph is k-vertex-connected if its node connectivity is >= k.\n        # We need 2-vertex-connectivity.\n        # The check also implicitly handles the requirement that the graph must have > k vertices.\n        if nx.node_connectivity(g) >= 2:\n            # 4. If the graph is biconnected, count it based on its number of edges.\n            num_edges = g.number_of_edges()\n            biconnected_counts_by_edges[num_edges] += 1\n\n    # 5. Format and print the final output as a detailed breakdown and an equation.\n    # Sort the counts by the number of edges for a clean, ordered result.\n    sorted_edge_keys = sorted(biconnected_counts_by_edges.keys())\n    count_values = [biconnected_counts_by_edges[k] for k in sorted_edge_keys]\n\n    print(\"The number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is the sum of counts for each possible number of edges:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    for num_edges, count in zip(sorted_edge_keys, count_values):\n        print(f\"Graphs with {num_edges} edges: {count}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Build the string for the final equation.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, count_values))\n\n    # Calculate the total sum.\n    total_count = sum(count_values)\n\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n\nsolve_graph_counting()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
