    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I will break down the user's request into key characteristics:\n    *   An island town.\n    *   Extremely remote (more than 500 km from the next inhabited island).\n    *   Located on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    *   The town and the bay share the same name.\n\n2.  **Identify Candidates:** The remoteness clue points to a few locations on Earth, such as Easter Island, Tristan da Cunha, or the Pitcairn Islands.\n\n3.  **Evaluate and Conclude:** I will evaluate these candidates against the other clues. The requirement that the town and bay share a name is a critical filter. My analysis points to Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui). It sits on Hanga Roa Bay, and Easter Island is an extremely remote volcanic island. While its bay isn't a perfect, symmetrical caldera like Santorini, it is a harbor on a volcanic island famous for its craters (calderas), making it the best fit for all the clues combined.\n\n4.  **Code Formulation:** Finally, I will write a Python script to present the answer and the logic clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the answer to the geographical riddle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key clues from the riddle\n    clue_remoteness_km = 500\n    clue_geography = \"bay formed by a volcanic caldera\"\n    clue_naming = \"town and bay share a name\"\n\n    # The identified location and its details\n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    island_name = \"Easter Island (Rapa Nui)\"\n    bay_name = \"Hanga Roa Bay\"\n    distance_to_nearest_inhabited_land_km = 2075 # to Pitcairn Islands\n\n    # Print the reasoning and the answer\n    print(\"Searching for an island town with the following properties:\")\n    print(f\"- More than {clue_remoteness_km} kilometers from another inhabited island.\")\n    print(f\"- Sits on a {clue_geography}.\")\n    print(f\"- The {clue_naming}.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Solution ---\")\n    print(f\"The town is: {town_name}\")\n    print(f\"It is located on: {island_name}\")\n    print(f\"It sits on a bay named: {bay_name}\")\n    print(f\"Fact check: The nearest inhabited land is over {distance_to_nearest_inhabited_land_km} km away.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: Hanga Roa is the correct answer.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
