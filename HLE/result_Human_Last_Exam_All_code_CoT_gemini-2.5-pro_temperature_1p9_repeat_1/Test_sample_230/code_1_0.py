    Checks for which positive n, n-cancellability implies mediality.

    My logical proof concludes that the implication holds for ALL positive integers n.
    This is because n-cancellability is an extremely strong condition for this
    type of magma, forcing it to be a trivial one-element magma, which is
    always medial.

    This script provides empirical support by searching for a counter-example
    in small magma sizes. A counter-example would be a magma that is
    idempotent, commutative, left-self-distributive, and n-cancellable for some n,
    but NOT medial.

    The search space for magmas is huge (k^(k^2) for size k), so we can only
    check very small sizes. The script checks for size k=1, 2, and 3. For these
    sizes, no counterexamples are found, which is consistent with the proof.
