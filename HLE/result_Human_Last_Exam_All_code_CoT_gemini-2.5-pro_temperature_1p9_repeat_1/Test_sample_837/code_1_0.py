    This function represents a potential algorithm for the problem.
    It takes no input and always halts, returning a "yes" or "no" answer.

    However, for the problem to be decidable, we would need to *know*
    that this algorithm returns the *correct* answer. The question
    "does a god exist?" is not one with a computationally verifiable answer.
    It is a metaphysical question.

    Because we cannot algorithmically prove the correctness of any such
    program, the problem is considered undecidable in the context of
