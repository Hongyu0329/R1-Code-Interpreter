def solve_boundary_value_problem():
    """
    Analyzes the solvability of the given boundary-value problem.

    The problem is for a countable system of differential equations:
        x'(t) = A(t)x(t) + f(t)
        x(2024) - x(2023) = alpha
    where A(t) is a diagonal matrix:
        A(t) = diag(th(t), ..., th(t), -th(t), -th(t), ...)

    The problem decouples into scalar equations:
        x_k'(t) = lambda_k(t) * x_k(t) + f_k(t)
        x_k(2024) - x_k(2023) = alpha_k

    A solvability condition arises when a solution does not exist for arbitrary
    f_k and alpha_k. This happens when the homogeneous ODE x_k'=lambda_k(t)x_k has
    no non-trivial bounded solutions, leaving no free parameters to satisfy the
    boundary condition.
