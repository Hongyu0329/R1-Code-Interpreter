print(f"The probability of measuring |0> in the output state is given as: {p_out_0}")

# Step 2: Since the circuit is unitary, the output state is normalized.
# The probability of measuring |1> is 1 minus the probability of measuring |0>.
p_out_1 = 1 - p_out_0
print(f"From normalization, the probability of measuring |1> in the output state is: 1 - {p_out_0} = {p_out_1}")

# Step 3: Apply the reinterpreted Property 1.
# We interpret the property "P(1) is the square of P(0)" as connecting the output to the input.
# Let's assume P_out(1) = (P_in(0))^2, where P_in(0) = |alpha|^2.
# So, p_out_1 = (|alpha|^2)^2
print(f"Using the interpretation that P_out(1) = (P_in(0))^2, we have the equation: {p_out_1} = (|alpha|^2)^2")

# Step 4: Solve for |alpha|^2.
# This means |alpha|^2 is the square root of p_out_1.
alpha_squared = math.sqrt(p_out_1)
