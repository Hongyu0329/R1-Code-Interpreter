    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the fundamental principle of Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Understand CTIS:** CTIS works by using a dispersive element (a diffraction grating) to project a scene's spectral information onto a 2D sensor (like a camera). The sensor captures a single image containing multiple, overlapping, spectrally-smeared copies of the original scene. These copies are the different diffraction orders.\n2.  **Relate to Tomography:** The process of recovering the original 3D data cube (2 spatial dimensions + 1 spectral dimension) from the 2D sensor image is a tomographic reconstruction problem. A successful tomographic reconstruction requires multiple \"projections\" of the object taken from different, non-collinear angles.\n3.  **Analyze Projections from Gratings:**\n    *   A single **1D** diffraction grating disperses light along only one axis. This creates diffraction orders (projections) that are all arranged in a line on the sensor. These are collinear projections and do not contain enough information to uniquely reconstruct the spectral volume.\n    *   To get non-collinear projections, we must disperse the light in at least a second, independent direction. This requires a second 1D grating, typically oriented perpendicularly to the first one.\n4.  **Determine the Minimum:** The combination of two perpendicular 1D gratings (often fabricated as a single \"2D crossed grating\") creates a 2D grid of diffraction orders on the sensor. This set of non-collinear projections is sufficient to perform the tomographic reconstruction. Therefore, the minimum number of fundamental grating structures required is two.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_minimum_gratings():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of diffraction gratings for CTIS.\n\n    The logic is based on the principles of computed tomography.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In CTIS, to reconstruct the 2D spatial-spectral data for each point in the scene,\n    # we need projections at various angles.\n    # Projections along a single line (collinear) are insufficient.\n    # We need projections along at least two independent axes to perform\n    # a tomographic reconstruction.\n    required_dispersion_axes = 2\n\n    # A single 1D diffraction grating provides dispersion along one axis.\n    gratings_per_axis = 1\n\n    # The total minimum number of gratings is the product of the required\n    # dispersion axes and the number of gratings needed per axis.\n    minimum_gratings = required_dispersion_axes * gratings_per_axis\n\n    print(\"The principle of computed tomography requires projections from multiple, non-collinear angles.\")\n    print(\"In CTIS, a 1D grating only provides collinear projections (along one axis).\")\n    print(\"To enable reconstruction, we must disperse light along a second, independent axis.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation of the minimum required gratings:\")\n    print(f\"Required dispersion axes for tomography = {required_dispersion_axes}\")\n    print(f\"1D gratings needed per axis = {gratings_per_axis}\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: {required_dispersion_axes} * {gratings_per_axis} = {minimum_gratings}\")\n\ncalculate_minimum_gratings()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
