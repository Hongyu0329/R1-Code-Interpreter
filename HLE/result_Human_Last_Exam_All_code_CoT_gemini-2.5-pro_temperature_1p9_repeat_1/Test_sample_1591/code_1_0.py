# Step 1: Define the components of the initial vector x_0 based on the derivation.
# From the third boundary condition and periodicity, x_0^2 = 10^20.
x0_2 = 10**20

# From the second boundary condition (with a likely typo correction), x_0^1 = sqrt(3) * x_0^2.
x0_1 = math.sqrt(3) * x0_2

# Step 2: The value to be computed simplifies to (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.
val1_sq = x0_1**2
val2_sq = x0_2**2

result = val1_sq + val2_sq

# Step 3: Print the details of the final calculation as requested.
