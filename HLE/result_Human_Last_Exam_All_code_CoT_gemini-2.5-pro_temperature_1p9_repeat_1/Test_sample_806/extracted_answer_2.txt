The specific biochemical reaction that initiated the process that eventually resulted in the development of skin blisters is the direct, non-covalent binding of the drug molecule to a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) protein, leading to the activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and the subsequent release of granulysin, which causes widespread death of skin cells.
