    explanation = """
The specific biochemical event that initiated the process resulting in skin blisters is a Type IV delayed-hypersensitivity reaction. The key initiating step is the **direct, non-covalent binding of the drug molecule (or its metabolite) to a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) protein, a type of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecule, on antigen-presenting cells.**

This binding alters the shape of the HLA protein, causing it to be recognized as foreign by the immune system's T-cell receptors (TCRs). This interaction triggers the activation and rapid expansion of drug-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).

These activated T-cells then migrate to the skin and mucous membranes where they release cytotoxic proteins, most notably **granulysin**. Granulysin induces widespread apoptosis (programmed cell death) of the body's own skin cells (keratinocytes), causing the epidermis to detach from the dermis, which manifests as the characteristic severe blisters and skin sloughing.
