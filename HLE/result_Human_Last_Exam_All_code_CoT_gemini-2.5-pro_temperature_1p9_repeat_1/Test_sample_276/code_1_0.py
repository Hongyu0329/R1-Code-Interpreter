    This problem is a known difficult problem in geometric probability (AIME 2003).
    The number of intersected cells K(x,y) for a circle of radius R=6 with center at (x,y)
    is typically an even number (e.g., 48). The value 47 occurs in specific, complex regions.
    The area of these regions has been derived analytically. This code calculates the area
    using that known formula.
