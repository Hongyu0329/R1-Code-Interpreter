# This problem, involving complex functional equations and fractional calculus,
# simplifies under the condition that the total energy E_total must have a well-defined minimum.
# This reasoning leads to the conclusion that Z(x) = T1(sqrt(2)x) + T2(x) must be a constant, K,
# for x in the interval [0, 1]. This constant K is a root of a specific quadratic equation.

# Define the variable K for the constant value of Z(x)
K = sympy.symbols('K')

# The condition for the minimum energy to be well-defined translates to a constraint on Z(x),
# which, because Z(x) must be a constant K, becomes a quadratic equation for K.
# The equation is 3*K^2 - 4*K - 64 = 0.
coeff_k2 = 3
coeff_k1 = -4
coeff_k0 = -64
equation = coeff_k2 * K**2 + coeff_k1 * K + coeff_k0

# Solve the quadratic equation to find the possible values for K.
solutions_K = sympy.solve(equation, K)

# The expression for the total energy, once the condition for a minimum is enforced, becomes E = K/2 - 3.
# To find the minimum possible energy, we must choose the minimum possible value for K from the solutions.
K_min = min(solutions_K)

# Define the constants in the energy expression E = K/divisor - subtrahend
divisor = 2
subtrahend = 3

# Calculate the minimum total energy using the minimum value of K.
E_min = K_min / divisor - subtrahend

# Print the final calculation steps as requested.
