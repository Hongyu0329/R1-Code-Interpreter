    "Of course. I can help with that.\n\nFirst, I will lay out my plan.\n1.  I will find the specific numerical imprints for Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and 20mg capsules.\n2.  I will write a Python script that stores these two numbers as strings.\n3.  The script will then programmatically compare the two strings to identify which digits are different.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the full imprint for each capsule and also list the specific digits that are different.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\n# The numerical imprint on Teva's 10mg fluoxetine capsule is 3105.\n# The numerical imprint on Teva's 20mg fluoxetine capsule is 3106.\n# Note: The text \"TEVA\" is also imprinted on the capsules but is excluded per the prompt.\n\nimprint_10mg = \"3105\"\nimprint_20mg = \"3106\"\n\n# Find the digits that are not shared between the two imprints\n# by converting the strings to sets and finding the symmetric difference.\ndiff_set = set(imprint_10mg).symmetric_difference(set(imprint_20mg))\n\n# Convert the set of differing digits to a sorted list for consistent output.\ndifferent_digits = sorted(list(diff_set))\n\n# Print the full numbers and then the digits that differ.\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is: {imprint_10mg}\")\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is: {imprint_20mg}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe digits that are different between these two numbers are: {', '.join(different_digits)}\")\n```\n<<<5, 6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
