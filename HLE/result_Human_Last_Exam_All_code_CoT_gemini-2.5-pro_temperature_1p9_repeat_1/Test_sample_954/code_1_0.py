    This function provides the three-digit number based on the analysis of the graph process.
    The analysis relies on the hypothesis that the maximum number of steps T is proportional to the maximum degree Delta.
    
    Case 1: Forest with max degree at most sqrt(log n)
    - T = Theta(Delta) = Theta(sqrt(log n)).
