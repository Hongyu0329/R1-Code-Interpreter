# This problem is a matter of topological deduction rather than numerical calculation.
# The step-by-step reasoning leads to a unique topological structure.
# Let N be the number of topologically distinct continua that satisfy the given properties.

# 1. The continuum must be an arc (homeomorphic to [0,1]).
# All arcs are topologically equivalent.
# Therefore, there is only one such type.

N = 1

# We are asked to present the result.
# Let's state the final count as a result of an equation.
print("Based on the topological analysis, the number of distinct continua is calculated.")
