        "A": "Correct. Natural selection is the primary force that maintains the genomic mutation rate. A rate that is too high creates a high deleterious 'mutational load', while a rate that is too low can be energetically costly and limit adaptation. Selection favors an 'optimal' rate that balances these trade-offs, thus maintaining relative constancy.",
        "B": "Incorrect. Genetic drift is a random process and causes fluctuations. While it plays a role in the evolution of the mutation rate (as described by the drift-barrier hypothesis), it is not the primary force that *maintains* a constant rate; natural selection is the directional force.",
        "C": "Incorrect. This describes a consequence of a given mutation rate and selection, not the cause of the rate's constancy. The mutation rate itself is the trait being maintained.",
        "D": "Incorrect. The distribution of mutations within a genome is not uniform and does not explain the maintenance of the overall rate per genome.",
        "E": "Incorrect. The stochastic (random) nature of mutation explains the source of variation, not the maintenance of a stable average rate over evolutionary time."
