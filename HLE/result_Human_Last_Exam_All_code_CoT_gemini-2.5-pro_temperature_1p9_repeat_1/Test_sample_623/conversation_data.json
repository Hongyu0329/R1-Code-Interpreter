    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Glucose Molecule**: I will start by representing the 1,4-13C glucose molecule, identifying that its first and fourth carbons are labeled with the 13C isotope.\n2.  **Trace Carbons through Glycolysis**: I will simulate the process of glycolysis. In this pathway, the 6-carbon glucose is split into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules. The crucial part is to correctly track the positions of the 13C labels from glucose to see where they end up in the two resulting pyruvate molecules.\n3.  **Identify the CO2-Producing Step**: While glycolysis itself doesn't release CO2, the most common subsequent step, pyruvate decarboxylation (e.g., via the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex), does. This reaction specifically removes the first carbon (the carboxyl group) of pyruvate as a molecule of CO2.\n4.  **Count the Labeled CO2**: Finally, my script will examine the two pyruvate molecules produced. By checking if their carboxyl carbons are 13C-labeled, it will count how many molecules of 13CO2 are released and display the result.\n\n```python\ndef trace_glycolysis_co2_release():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script traces the 13C labels from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis\n    and subsequent decarboxylation to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the 1,4-13C glucose molecule.\n    # We represent the 6 carbons of glucose in a list.
