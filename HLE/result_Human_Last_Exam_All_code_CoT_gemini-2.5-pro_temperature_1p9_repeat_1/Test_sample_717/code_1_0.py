    This function solves for n by reasoning about the properties of tame representation theory

    # Step 1: Interpretation of the problem's premises.
    # The problem describes a setup analogous to the classification of representations of tame algebras,
    # where a complicated category of representations (of P) is studied by relating it to a simpler one (of I).
    # 'F' is a "tame functor", meaning it is an indecomposable representation in a category of tame type.
    # We interpret "F is n-resolvable" to mean the projective dimension of F is n.
    # projective_dimension(F) = n
    
    # Step 2: Characterize the "simpler" category Fun(I, Vect_K).
    # In tame representation theory, one-parameter families of modules are constructed using base categories
    # that are hereditary and have global dimension 1, such as the module category of K[x].
    # We infer that the category Fun(I, Vect_K) has these properties.
    global_dimension_of_Fun_I = 1
    
    # This implies that for any functor G in Fun(I, Vect_K), its projective dimension is at most 1.
    # projective_dimension(G) <= 1
    
    # Step 3: Use homological algebra on the functor f^k.
    # The functor f^k is given as exact. We assume f^k is the left Kan extension functor, Lan_f.
    # Lan_f is left adjoint to the restriction functor f*.
    # f* is always an exact functor.
    # A standard theorem states that a left adjoint to an exact functor between abelian categories
    # (with enough projectives) preserves projective objects.
    # Therefore, f^k maps projective objects in Fun(I, Vect_K) to projective objects in Fun(P, Vect_K).

    # Step 4: Bound the projective dimension of F.
    # Since f^k is exact and preserves projectives, it can be shown that the projective dimension of F
    # is less than or equal to the projective dimension of G.
    # pd(F) <= pd(G).
    # Combining with Step 2, we get:
    # pd(F) <= 1.
    # So, n <= 1.
    n_is_less_than_or_equal_to = 1

    # Step 5: Use the nature of the "tame functor" F.
    # A "tame functor" F is typically one of the indecomposable objects in a one-parameter family,
    # distinguishing it from the simpler, often finite, set of projective modules.
    # As such, F is not projective.
    # The projective dimension of any non-projective object is greater than 0.
    # pd(F) > 0.
    # So, n > 0.
    n_is_greater_than = 0
    
    # Step 6: Conclude the value of n.
    # From n <= 1 and n > 0, and since n must be an integer, we find the value of n.
    # n = 1
    n = 1

    # Print the result and the equation.

    print(f"Since F is a non-projective tame functor, its projective dimension must be positive: n > {n_is_greater_than}.")
