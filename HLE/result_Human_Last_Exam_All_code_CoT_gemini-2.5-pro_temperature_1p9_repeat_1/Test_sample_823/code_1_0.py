    print("The Problem Statement:")
    print("Let C be a class of graphs of degree at most d for some constant d > 0.")
    print("Assume that C has unbounded treewidth.")
    print("Which of the following must be true for C?\n")

    print("Analysis of Options:")
    print("A. For each k, there is a graph in C containing an induced cycle of length k.")
    print("   -> False. A counterexample is the class of grid graphs, which are bipartite and have no odd cycles.\n")

    print("B. For each k, there is a graph in C containing the k-by-k-grid as a subgraph.")
    print("   -> False. A counterexample is the class of subdivided grids. They have unbounded treewidth but don't contain even a 2x2 grid as a subgraph.\n")

    print("C. C is a family of expander graphs.")
    print("   -> False. The class of grid graphs is not an expander family, as its Cheeger constant approaches 0.\n")
    
    print("D. For each k, there is a graph in C containing an induced matching of size k.")
    print("   -> This is also a true statement. It follows from theorems stating that for bounded-degree graphs, treewidth is polynomially bounded by the induced matching size. Unbounded treewidth thus implies unbounded induced matching size.\n")

    print("E. The graphs in C contain clique-minors of unbounded size.")
    print("   -> True. This is a fundamental result in graph theory. The Grid Minor Theorem of Robertson and Seymour states that a graph has large treewidth if and only if it contains a large grid minor. A large grid minor, in turn, contains a large clique minor. Since the treewidth in C is unbounded, for any size m, we can find a graph in C with a large enough treewidth to guarantee a K_m minor.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Both D and E are technically correct consequences. However, the relationship between treewidth and grid/clique minors is a cornerstone of graph minor theory and provides the fundamental structural reason for a graph to have high treewidth.")
    print("Therefore, E is considered the most direct and fundamental consequence.\n")
    
    # Final Answer
    print("The correct answer is E.")
