    "To determine which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches, we need to analyze the sound produced by muscle twitches and compare it to the hearing capabilities of the animals listed.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  Establish the characteristics of the sound produced by a human muscle twitch. These are known to be very low-frequency (infrasound or near-infrasound) and very low-amplitude (quiet) sounds. The typical frequency is around 25 Hz.\n2.  Review the documented hearing ranges and special sensitivities of each animal in the answer choices (Dog, Bat, Herring, Whale, Human).\n3.  Write a Python script that methodically compares the sound of a muscle twitch to the hearing abilities of each animal.\n4.  The script will print the analysis for each animal, explaining why it is or is not a likely candidate.\n5.  The analysis will highlight not just the frequency range but also any special auditory adaptations, as sensitivity is key for hearing such a faint sound. The herring, in particular, has a unique adaptation connecting its swim bladder to its inner ear, making it exceptionally sensitive to low-frequency sounds and pressure waves.\n6.  The script will conclude which animal is the most plausible candidate based on this comparison.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_animal_hearing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which animal from a given list is most likely to hear\n    a human muscle twitch based on their hearing capabilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the sound source's characteristics.\n    # A human muscle twitch produces a very faint sound at a low frequency.\n    muscle_twitch_frequency = 25  # Approximate frequency in Hz\n    print(f\"Investigating: Ability to hear a human muscle twitch.\")\n    print(f\"The sound source is a muscle twitch, which occurs at a very low amplitude and at a low frequency of about {muscle_twitch_frequency} Hz.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define the hearing characteristics of each animal.\n    # Data is based on general scientific knowledge.\n    # Format: {Animal: [Lower Freq (Hz), Upper Freq (Hz), \"Note about sensitivity\"]}\n    hearing_data = {\n        \"A.
