# Based on the reaction analysis, the final product is an unsaturated aldehyde.
# Let's define the components of its IUPAC name based on the structure.

# The locants for the two methyl groups.
locants_substituents = "5,5"
substituents = "dimethyl"

# The parent chain is a 5-carbon chain.
parent_name = "pent"

# The locant for the double bond (alkene).
locant_unsaturation = "4"
unsaturation_type = "en"

# The suffix for the principal functional group (aldehyde).
functional_group_suffix = "al"

# Assemble the final IUPAC name according to nomenclature rules.
final_iupac_name = f"{locants_substituents}-{substituents}{parent_name}-{locant_unsaturation}-{unsaturation_type}{functional_group_suffix}"

# Print the final answer.
