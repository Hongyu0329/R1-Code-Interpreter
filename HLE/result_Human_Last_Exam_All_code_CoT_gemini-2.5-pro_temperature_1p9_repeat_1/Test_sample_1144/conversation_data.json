    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Knowns and Constants:**\n    *   Uncertainty in position, Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m.\n    *   Principal quantum number, n = 1 (for the first Bohr orbit).\n    *   Reduced Planck's constant, ħ ≈ 1.05457 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n    *   Bohr radius (radius of the first orbit), a₀ ≈ 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp):**\n    *   Use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2.\n    *   For the minimum uncertainty, we use the equality: Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Momentum of the Electron (p):**\n    *   According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum (L) is quantized: L = mvr = nħ.\n    *   Since linear momentum p = mv, we can write L = pr.\n    *   For the first orbit (n=1), the momentum is p = (1 * ħ) / r, where r is the radius of the first orbit (the Bohr radius, a₀).\n    *   So, p = ħ / a₀.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio (Δp / p):**\n    *   The required ratio is Δp divided by p.\n    *   Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)\n    *   This simplifies to: Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx).\n    *   Substitute the known values to find the final numerical answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_momentum_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its\n    momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Constants\n    hbar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck constant in J·s\n    a0 = 5.29177210903e-11  # Bohr radius in meters\n    delta_x = 10e-12        # Uncertainty in position in meters (10 pm)\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (delta_p) using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle\n    # Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n    delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the momentum (p) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (n=1)\n    # p = n * ħ / r = 1 * ħ / a₀\n    p = hbar / a0\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the ratio of delta_p to p\n    ratio = delta_p / p\n    \n    # Alternatively, using the simplified formula: ratio = a0 / (2 * delta_x)\n    # This avoids calculating hbar and provides a more direct result.\n    # ratio_simplified = a0 / (2 * delta_x)\n    # The results from both methods are identical.\n\n    print(\"Problem: Find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit.\")\n    print(f\"Given uncertainty in position (Δx) = {delta_x:.1e} m\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Calculation Steps:\")\n    print(f\"1.
