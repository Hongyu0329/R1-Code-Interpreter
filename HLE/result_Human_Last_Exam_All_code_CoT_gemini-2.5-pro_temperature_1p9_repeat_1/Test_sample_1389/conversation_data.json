    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the relationship between the observed vaccine efficacy from an incidence rate ratio and the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define \"All-or-Nothing\" Vaccine Efficacy:** An all-or-nothing vaccine provides complete protection to a fraction of the vaccinated population (let's call this fraction `VE_s`, for efficacy against susceptibility) and provides zero protection to the remaining fraction (`1 - VE_s`).\n2.  **Define \"Per-Exposure\" Vaccine Efficacy (`VE_p`):** This is the average reduction in the probability of infection per single exposure, averaged across the entire vaccinated group.\n    *   For the protected fraction (`VE_s`), the reduction is 100% (or 1.0).\n    *   For the unprotected fraction (`1 - VE_s`), the reduction is 0%.\n    *   The average per-exposure efficacy is the weighted average: `VE_p = (VE_s * 1.0) + ((1 - VE_s) * 0.0) = VE_s`.\n    *   So, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, the true per-exposure efficacy `VE_p` is equal to `VE_s`.\n3.  **Model Incidence Rates:** We will model the incidence rate (IR) for both unvaccinated (`IR_u`) and vaccinated (`IR_v`) groups. Let `h` be the baseline hazard of infection for any susceptible person.\n    *   `IR_u = h`\n    *   The vaccinated group is a mix. The `VE_s` fraction has a hazard of 0, and the `1 - VE_s` fraction has a hazard of `h`. The average hazard, and thus the incidence rate, is the weighted average: `IR_v = (VE_s * 0) + ((1 - VE_s) * h) = (1 - VE_s) * h`.\n4.  **Calculate Vaccine Efficacy from Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** The standard formula for vaccine efficacy based on observed rates is `VE = 1 - IRR`.\n    *   `IRR = IR_v / IR_u = ((1 - VE_s) * h) / h = 1 - VE_s`.\n    *   `VE = 1 - IRR = 1 - (1 - VE_s) = VE_s`.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** We will compare the calculated `VE` from step 4 with the true per-exposure efficacy `VE_p` from step 2. Since both are equal to `VE_s`, the formula `1 - IRR` correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy.\n6.  **Code Demonstration:** The python code will simulate this scenario with specific numbers to provide a concrete example of this conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_vaccine_efficacy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains if 1-IRR overestimates, underestimates, or correctly\n    estimates per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define parameters for our hypothetical scenario.\n    # VE_s is the fraction of vaccinated people who are fully protected (susceptibility is zero).\n    # This is the defining parameter of an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine.\n    ve_s_true = 0.90\n\n    # h is the baseline hazard or incidence rate of infection for any susceptible person.\n    # We can use a representative value, e.g., 5 cases per 100 person-years.\n    # Let's use cases per person-day for simplicity. h = 0.05 / 365 = 0.000137\n    h_unvaccinated = 0.005 # Base incidence rate for susceptible individuals\n\n    # Step 2: Define the 'true' per-exposure vaccine efficacy (VE_p) for this model.\n    # For the VE_s fraction, protection is 100%.
