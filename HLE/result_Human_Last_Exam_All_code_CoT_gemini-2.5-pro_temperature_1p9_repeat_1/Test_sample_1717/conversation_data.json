    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Establish the Health Scaling Formula:** First, I will determine the correct formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode. This involves finding its base health for a single player in Expert Mode and the additional health scaling factor for each subsequent player.\n2.  **Analyze the Formula for Infinite Players:** The problem specifies an \"infinite number of players.\" I will analyze the health formula as the number of players (N) approaches infinity. This will show that the health value increases without a mathematical bound.\n3.  **Identify the Technical Limitation:** Since the formula itself does not have a maximum, the true theoretical limit must be a technical one within the game's code. I will identify the data type used to store NPC health in Terraria.\n4.  **Calculate the Maximum Value:** Finally, I will determine the maximum possible value for that data type. This value represents the highest possible health the game's engine can assign to the boss.\n5.  **Code the Solution:** I will write a Python script that explains and performs this final calculation, making sure to show the numbers used in the equation as requested.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Establish the Health Scaling Formula\n# According to the official Terraria Wiki, the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode\n# for a single player is 3640. For each additional player, health increases by 35%.\n# The formula is: Health(N) = BaseExpertHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (N - 1))\n# where N is the number of players.\n\n# Let's simplify the formula:\n# Health(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35*N - 0.35)\n# Health(N) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35*N)\n# Health(N) = 2366 + 1274*N\n\n# Step 2: Analyze the Formula for Infinite Players\n# The formula Health(N) = 2366 + 1274*N is a linear function.\n# As the number of players N approaches infinity, the health value also approaches infinity.\n\n# Step 3: Identify the Technical Limitation\n# Given the mathematical formula tends to infinity, the theoretical maximum health is limited\n# by the game's technical implementation. In Terraria's source code, an NPC's health\n# (lifeMax) is stored as a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the Maximum Value\n# The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2^31 - 1.\n\n# Base for the exponentiation\nbase = 2\n# Power for the exponentiation\npower = 31\n# Value to subtract\nsubtrahend = 1\n\n# Final calculation\nmax_health = (base ** power) - subtrahend\n\nprint(\"The health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is a linear function of the number of players (N):\")\nprint(\"Health = 2366 + 1274 * N\")\nprint(\"\\nAs N approaches infinity, the health is limited by the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\")\nprint(\"This technical limit is calculated as follows:\")\n# The format f-string with commas makes the large number readable.\nprint(f\"({base}^{power}) - {subtrahend} = {max_health:,}\")\n\n```\n<<<2147483647>>>"
