def solve():
    """
    This function solves the logical puzzle about parenthesis strings and prints the result.

    The reasoning for the answer is as follows:
    1. False. Counterexample: s = '(()_k...())'. LHS includes k*log(2), RHS is constant log(2).
    2. False. Same counterexample. LHS includes log(log(2k+2)), RHS is constant.
    3. False. Same counterexample. LHS includes k*(log(2))^5, RHS is constant.
    4. True. For bushy trees, sums are dominated by leaf contributions (k vs k*c). For deep chains, ratio of terms is ~1.
    5. True. The relationship holds for both bushy trees (since 0.1 < 1) and deep chains (since 0.1 < 0.11).
    6. True. The relationship holds for both bushy trees (since 0.25 < 1) and deep chains (since 0.25 < 0.5).

    The resulting string of T/F values is "FFFTTT".
