# This is a well-established result from the mathematical field of topology.
# The classification of homogeneous planar continua is a famous theorem.
# It states that every such object is topologically equivalent (homeomorphic)
# to exactly one of the following three spaces:

# 1. The Circle (or simple closed curve)
# 2. The Pseudo-arc (a pathological but fascinating object)
# 3. The Circle of Pseudo-arcs (a solenoid-like object made of pseudo-arcs)

# Since this list is exhaustive and its members are distinct, we can count them.
