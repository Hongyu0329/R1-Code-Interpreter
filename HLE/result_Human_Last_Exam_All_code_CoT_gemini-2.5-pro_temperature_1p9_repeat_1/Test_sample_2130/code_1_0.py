    """
    Solves the physics problem of minimizing the surface area cubed to volume squared ratio
    for a particle emitter.

    The problem can be solved analytically. The region traversed by the particles is a
    paraboloid of revolution segment. The ratio R = A^3 / V^2, where A is the surface area
    and V is the volume, can be expressed in terms of a single dimensionless parameter.
    Minimizing this ratio using calculus yields a fixed numerical value.

    The final analytical expression for the minimum ratio is:
    Minimum Ratio = 27 * pi * (1 + 2 / sqrt(3))
