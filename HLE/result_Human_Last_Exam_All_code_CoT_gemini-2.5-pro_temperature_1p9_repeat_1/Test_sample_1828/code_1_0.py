    # To maximize this, we consider a model where c is maximal, i.e., c = omega_3.
    # The possible cardinalities in X are then from the set {omega_1, omega_2, omega_3}.
    # Consistency results by Shelah show that it is possible to have a model where
    # MAD families of all regular cardinalities between omega_1 and c exist.
    # For c = omega_3, this means we can have X = {omega_1, omega_2, omega_3}.
