    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n`, denoted as `a(n)`, for electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics, is given by the double factorial formula: `a(n) = (2n-1)!!`.\n\nA double factorial, `k!!`, is the product of all integers from `k` down to 1 with the same parity as `k`. For an odd number like `(2n-1)`, the formula is:\n`a(n) = (2n-1)!! = (2n-1) * (2n-3) * ... * 3 * 1`\n\nTo find `a(3)`, we set `n=3`:\n`a(3) = (2 * 3 - 1)!! = (6 - 1)!! = 5!!`\n\nWe can calculate this as `5 * 3 * 1`. The Python code below will compute this result and display the full calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_a(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n.\n    The formula is a(n) = (2n-1)!!.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return \"n must be a positive integer.\"\n\n    # Calculate the base for the double factorial\n    base = 2 * n - 1\n\n    # Calculate the double factorial using a loop\n    result = 1\n    terms = []\n    current_term = base\n    while current_term > 0:\n        result *= current_term\n        terms.append(str(current_term))\n        current_term -= 2\n\n    # Format the equation string showing all the numbers\n    equation_str = \" * \".join(terms)\n\n    # Print the final result in the desired format\n    print(f\"a({n}) = ({2*n-1})!! = {equation_str} = {result}\")\n    return result\n\n# Calculate and print a(3)\nfinal_answer = calculate_a(3)\n```\n<<<15>>>"
