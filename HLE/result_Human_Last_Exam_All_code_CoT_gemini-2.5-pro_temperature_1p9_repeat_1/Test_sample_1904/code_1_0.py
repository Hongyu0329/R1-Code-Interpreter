# The reasoning for the number of components is based on a classification of closed sets
# in an ultrametric space according to two fundamental dichotomies.

# Dichotomy 1: Bounded vs. Unbounded
# A closed set A can have a finite diameter (bounded) or an infinite diameter (unbounded).
# This gives 2 categories.
dichotomy_1_options = 2

# Dichotomy 2: "Ball-like" vs. "Non-ball-like"
# In ultrametric spaces, balls have very specific properties (e.g., any point in a ball is a center).
# We can distinguish between sets that are balls and sets that are not (e.g., spheres).
# This gives another 2 categories.
dichotomy_2_options = 2

# Assuming these two properties are independent and characterize the connected components of CL(X)
# for a suitably chosen space X, the total number of components would be the product of the options.
# By constructing a space that exhibits non-empty examples of all 4 types of closed sets,
# and for which these classes form the connected components, we arrive at this number.
number_of_components = dichotomy_1_options * dichotomy_2_options
