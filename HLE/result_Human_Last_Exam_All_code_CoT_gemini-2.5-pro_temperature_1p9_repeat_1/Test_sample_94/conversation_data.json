    "My plan is to first identify the physicist from the description provided. The story about a custodial worker noticing an optical distortion in a concave mirror and reporting it to a physicist, who then developed a new type of X-ray microscope, is a well-known anecdote in the field of X-ray optics. This physicist, along with a colleague, developed what is now known as the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system. After identifying the specific physicist to whom the story is most often attributed, I will write a Python script to print his name as the final output.\n\n```python\n# The physicist better known for work in X-ray microscopy who developed a focusing system\n# based on an accidental observation by a custodial worker cleaning a long,\n# cylindrically concave mirror is Paul Kirkpatrick.\n# This script will print his name.\n\nphysicist_name = \"Paul Kirkpatrick\"\nprint(physicist_name)\n```\n<<<Paul Kirkpatrick>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which physicist better known for work in the microscopy field discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
