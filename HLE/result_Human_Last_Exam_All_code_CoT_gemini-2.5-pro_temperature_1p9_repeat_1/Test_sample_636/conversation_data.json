    "This is a pole placement problem from control theory. We need to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system `A + BF` are at the desired locations `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial:** The eigenvalues determine the characteristic polynomial of the desired closed-loop system. For a second-order system with eigenvalues `λ₁` and `λ₂`, the polynomial is `(λ - λ₁)(λ - λ₂) = λ² - (λ₁ + λ₂)λ + λ₁λ₂ = 0`.\n2.  **Construct a Target Closed-Loop Matrix `A_cl`:** We will create a matrix `A_cl` that has this characteristic polynomial. A simple choice is the controller companion form. Any matrix with the correct eigenvalues will lead to a valid solution for `F`.\n3.  **Calculate the Feedback Gain `F`:** The closed-loop matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`. Since the given matrix `B` is invertible, we can rearrange this equation to solve for `F` directly: `F = B⁻¹(A_cl - A)`.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** We will use the `numpy` library to define the matrices, perform the inverse and multiplication operations, and verify the final result by calculating the eigenvalues of `A + BF`.\n5.  **Display the Full Equation:** As requested, the final output will show the complete equation `A + B * F = A_cl` with all the numerical matrices.\n\nLet's execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_and_print_pole_placement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the state feedback gain F for a given system so that\n    the closed-loop system A + BF has specified eigenvalues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 0: Define the system matrices and desired eigenvalues (poles)\n    A = np.array([[-1, 1], [1, 0]])\n    B = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 0]])\n    desired_poles = np.array([-1 + 1j, -1 - 1j])\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the desired characteristic polynomial\n    # For poles p1, p2, the polynomial is (s-p1)(s-p2) = s^2 - (p1+p2)s + p1*p2\n    # Sum of poles: (-1 + 1j) + (-1 - 1j) = -2\n    # Product of poles: (-1 + 1j) * (-1 - 1j) = (-1)^2 - (1j)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2\n    # Desired characteristic polynomial: s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0\n    poly_coeffs = [1, 2, 2] # Coefficients for s^2, s^1, s^0\n\n    # Step 2: Construct a target closed-loop matrix A_cl (in companion form)\n    # The controller companion form for s^2 + a1*s + a0 = 0 is [[0, 1], [-a0, -a1]]\n    a1 = poly_coeffs[1]\n    a0 = poly_coeffs[2]\n    A_cl = np.array([[0, 1], [-a0, -a1]])\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the feedback gain F using F = B_inv * (A_cl - A)\n    try:\n        B_inv = np.linalg.inv(B)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        print(\"Matrix B is singular, cannot compute a unique F with this method.\")\n        return\n\n    F = B_inv @ (A_cl - A)\n\n    # Step 4: Print the results and verification\n    print(\"Given system matrices:\")\n    print(f\"A =\\n{A}\")\n    print(f\"B =\\n{B}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Desired eigenvalues: [-1 + j, -1 - j]\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Calculated state feedback gain matrix F:\")\n    print(f\"F =\\n{np.round(F, 4)}\\n\")\n    \n    # Verify the result by calculating A + B*F\n    result_A_cl = A + B @ F\n\n    print(\"The final equation A + B * F is:\")\n    print(f\"{A} +\\n\\n{B} @\\n\\n{np.round(F, 4)} =\\n\\n{np.round(result_A_cl, 4)}\\n\")\n\n    # Final check: Calculate eigenvalues of the resulting closed-loop system\n    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(result_A_cl)\n    print(\"Verification: Eigenvalues of the resulting matrix A + BF are:\")\n    print(np.round(eigenvalues, 4))\n\nsolve_and_print_pole_placement()\n<<<[[-3.0, -2.0], [2.0, 1.0]]>>>\n```"
