    "To prevent the degradation of the produced p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you need to disrupt its native catabolic pathway. The first and committed step in this degradation pathway is the activation of p-coumaric acid to p-coumaroyl-CoA, which is then further metabolized. The enzyme responsible for this reaction is coumarate-CoA ligase (also known as feruloyl-CoA synthetase, or Fcs).\n\nBy knocking out the gene that codes for this enzyme, you will block the entry of p-coumaric acid into the degradation pathway, thus promoting its accumulation. The gene is commonly referred to as `fcs`.\n\nThe following Python script simulates a database lookup to identify the specific gene locus tag for this enzyme in *C. glutamicum* and explains why it is the correct target for knockout.\n\n```python\ndef find_knockout_target_for_p_coumaric_acid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the gene knockout target to prevent p-coumaric acid\n    degradation in Corynebacterium glutamicum.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # This data is based on published research and bioinformatics databases\n    # for C. glutamicum ATCC 13032.\n    gene_info = {\n        \"product\": \"p-Coumaric Acid\",\n        \"problem\": \"Product is being degraded by a native catabolic pathway.\",\n        \"key_enzyme\": \"Coumarate-CoA ligase / Feruloyl-CoA synthetase (Fcs)\",\n        \"reaction\": \"p-Coumaric Acid + CoA -> p-Coumaroyl-CoA\",\n        \"gene_symbol\": \"fcs\",\n        \"locus_tag\": \"NCgl2544\", # For C. glutamicum ATCC 13032\n        \"reasoning\": \"This is the first committed step in the degradation pathway.
