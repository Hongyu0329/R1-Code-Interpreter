# Number of pirates corresponds to the number of vertices (V) in a graph.
V = 9

# Number of pairs at gunpoint corresponds to the number of edges (E).
E = 16

# The problem describes a connected, planar graph.
# V = Number of Vertices
# E = Number of Edges
# F = Number of Faces (which represent the Mexican standoffs of >= 3 pirates)
# We can use Euler's formula for planar graphs: V - E + F = 2.
# To find the number of faces (F), we can rearrange the formula to: F = 2 - V + E.

# Calculate the number of faces.
F = 2 - V + E
