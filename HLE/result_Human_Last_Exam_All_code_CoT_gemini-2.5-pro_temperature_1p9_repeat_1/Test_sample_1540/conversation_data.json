    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Task:** The goal is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two input strings. If the first string is smaller, the output is -1; if larger, 1; if equal, 0.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Python Solution:** Python provides simple tools for this. My script will:\n    *   Read the two lines of input.\n    *   Convert both strings to a consistent case (lowercase) using the `.lower()` method.\n    *   Directly compare the two lowercase strings. Python's comparison operators (`<`, `>`) work lexicographically.\n    *   Print the appropriate result (-1, 1, or 0) based on the outcome of the comparison.\n\n3.  **Determine Memory Usage for an Efficient C Program:** The prompt also requires calculating the memory (`m`) used by variables in the *most memory-efficient* C implementation.\n    *   To be maximally memory-efficient, we should avoid storing both full strings in memory if possible.\n    *   The optimal C program would read the first string into a character array buffer (size 101 to accommodate the maximum length of 100 plus the null terminator).\n    *   Then, it would read the second string one character at a time in a loop, comparing it on-the-fly against the corresponding character from the first string's buffer.\n    *   The variables needed are: a `char` array for the first string, a loop counter (which can be a `char` since the index won't exceed 100), and an `int` variable to store the character returned by `getchar()`.\n    *   I will calculate `m` by summing the memory for these variables: `m = 101` bytes for the string buffer + `1` byte for the loop index + `4` bytes for the character input variable.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function reads two strings, compares them lexicographically ignoring case,\n    and prints -1, 1, or 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the first string from standard input and remove leading/trailing whitespace.\n    s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Read the second string from standard input and remove leading/trailing whitespace.\n    s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    # Convert both strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n    s1_lower = s1.lower()\n    s2_lower = s2.lower()\n\n    # Perform the lexicographical comparison and print the result.\n    if s1_lower < s2_lower:\n        print(\"-1\")\n    elif s1_lower > s2_lower:\n        print(\"1\")\n    else:\n        print(\"0\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<106>>>"
