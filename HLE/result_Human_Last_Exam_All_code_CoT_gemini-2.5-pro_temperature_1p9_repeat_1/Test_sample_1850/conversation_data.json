    "To determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*, a careful analysis of the text is required. The poem's scope is primarily the biblical Book of Genesis, but it includes prophetic visions of future history (in Books XI and XII) and satirical asides (in Book III) where later figures are named.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define \"historical saint\" for this context. I will include major Old Testament figures revered as saints in the Christian tradition (Patriarchs, Prophets) as well as New Testament and post-biblical saints.\n2.  Systematically search the text of *Paradise Lost* for the names of these figures.\n3.  Confirm that the mention refers to the correct historical person. For example, some names could refer to demons or other characters.\n4.  Compile a list of the confirmed names.\n5.  Create a Python script that lists these saints and calculates the total, displaying the final count and the equation used to reach it.\n\nAfter a thorough review of the epic poem, I have identified seven such figures:\n\n*   **Enoch:** (Book XI) Mentioned in the vision of future history shown to Adam.\n*   **Noah:** (Book XI) Also seen in the vision of the future.\n*   **Abraham:** (Book XII) Named as a \"famous Patriarch.\"\n*   **Moses:** (Book XII) Mentioned by name in a simile comparing his experience on the Mount of God.\n*   **David:** (Book XII) His throne and lineage are mentioned in the prophecy of the Messiah.\n*   **Peter:** (Book III) Mentioned as \"Saint Peter\" with his keys at \"Heavens Wicket\" in a satirical passage about the follies of those seeking entry to Heaven.\n*   **Dominic:** (Book III) Mentioned by his eponymous order, the Dominicans (\"weeds of Dominic\"), in the same satirical passage. This counts as a mention by name in a classic poetic style.\n\nThe following Python code lists these saints and provides the final count.\n\n```python\ndef count_saints_in_paradise_lost():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the historical saints mentioned by name in\n    John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\".\n\n    The analysis includes Old Testament patriarchs, New Testament apostles, and\n    post-biblical saints whose names appear directly in the text.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # List of historical saints identified by name in the text\n    saints_in_paradise_lost = [\n        \"Enoch\",      # Book XI\n        \"Noah\",       # Book XI\n        \"Abraham\",    # Book XII\n        \"Moses\",      # Book XII\n        \"David\",      # Book XII\n        \"Peter\",      # Book III (as \"Saint Peter\")\n        \"Dominic\"     # Book III (via \"weeds of Dominic\")\n    ]\n\n    print(\"The historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's 'Paradise Lost' are:\")\n    for saint in saints_in_paradise_lost:\n        print(f\"- {saint}\")\n    \n    count = len(saints_in_paradise_lost)\n    \n    # Building the equation string with each number\n    equation_parts = [\"1\" for _ in saints_in_paradise_lost]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is based on a count of each saint mentioned:\")\n    # Printing the equation and the final result\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {count}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, there are {count} historical saints mentioned by name.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the result\ncount_saints_in_paradise_lost()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
