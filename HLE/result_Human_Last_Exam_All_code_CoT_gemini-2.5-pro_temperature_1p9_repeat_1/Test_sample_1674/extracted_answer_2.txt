Yes, the theory can fail if the birefringent medium is non-reciprocal. A standard birefringent element like a wave plate is reciprocal, and the theory of reversing the system to perfectly reconstruct the input holds. However, if the element is non-reciprocal (e.g., a Faraday rotator, which induces birefringence via a magnetic field), it breaks the time-reversal symmetry of the optical system. In this case, sending the phase-conjugated output back through the system will not recover the original input signal, and thus the theory fails. The provided simulation demonstrates this failure.
