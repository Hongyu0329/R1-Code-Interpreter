    "Of course. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution.\n\nThis is a question from the field of point-set topology. A direct computation is not possible as it concerns abstract mathematical spaces. The Python script will therefore serve to explain the reasoning and print the final answer based on established mathematical theorems.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Define the key terms: an **indecomposable continuum** and a **composant**.\n2.  Consider the trivial case: a continuum consisting of a single point. This space is indecomposable. I will determine how many composants it has.\n3.  Consider the non-trivial case: an indecomposable continuum containing more than one point (e.g., the pseudo-arc).\n4.  State the relevant theorem from continuum theory regarding the number of composants in a non-trivial indecomposable continuum.\n5.  Combine the findings from the trivial and non-trivial cases to determine the absolute \"smallest number\" of composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n6.  The Python code will print this explanation and the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_continuum_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and provides the answer to the number of composants\n    in an indecomposable continuum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the terms\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------\")\n    print(\"An 'indecomposable continuum' is a compact, connected space that cannot be split into two smaller, proper subcontinua.\")\n    print(\"A 'composant' of a point 'p' in such a space is the set of all points that can be connected to 'p' within a proper subcontinuum.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of composants in any such space.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the possibilities\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------\")\n    print(\"We consider two cases based on the 'size' of the continuum.\")\n    print(\"\\nCase A: The Trivial Continuum\")\n    print(\"Consider a continuum that consists of only a single point.
