    # 1. State the definitions and the problem's premise.
    # omega is the first infinite cardinal (countably infinite).
    # omega_1 is the first uncountable cardinal.
    # Premise: The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) holds, which states 2^omega = omega_1.
    premise = "2^omega = omega_1"
    
    # X is the set of possible cardinalities of maximal almost disjoint (MAD) families.
    # A family of infinite subsets of omega is MAD if any two sets have finite
    # intersection, and the family cannot be extended.
    
    # 2. Bound the cardinality of a MAD family.
    # Let kappa be the cardinality of any MAD family.
    # Since a MAD family is a subset of the power set of omega, its cardinality
    # kappa must be less than or equal to the cardinality of the power set, 2^omega.
    # So, kappa <= 2^omega.
    # Given the premise, this means kappa <= omega_1.
    
    # The minimum cardinality of a MAD family is a cardinal characteristic denoted by 'a'.
    # So, for any MAD family, kappa >= a.
    # This gives us the inequality: a <= kappa <= 2^omega.
    
    # 3. Apply the Continuum Hypothesis.
    # A key result in set theory is that CH implies that all the "small" cardinal
    # characteristics of the continuum are equal to omega_1. This includes 'a'.
    # A proof sketch for this:
    # It is a theorem in ZFC that b <= a, where 'b' is the bounding number.
    # It is also provable that b > omega, so b >= omega_1.
    # Thus, under CH (2^omega = omega_1), we have:
    # omega_1 <= b <= a <= 2^omega = omega_1.
    # This forces a = omega_1.
    
    # 4. Determine the set X.
    # Now our inequality for kappa, the cardinality of any MAD family, becomes:
    # omega_1 <= kappa <= omega_1.
    # This implies that kappa must be exactly omega_1.
    
    # Therefore, every MAD family has cardinality omega_1 under CH.
    # The set X of all possible cardinalities is a singleton set.
    X = "{omega_1}"
    
    # 5. Determine the order type of X.
    # The set X = {omega_1} has only one element.
    # A linearly ordered set with a single element is order-isomorphic to the
    # ordinal number 1 (which is the set {0}).
    # The order type of a well-ordered set is the unique ordinal it is isomorphic to.
    
    order_type = 1
    
    # 6. Print the result.
