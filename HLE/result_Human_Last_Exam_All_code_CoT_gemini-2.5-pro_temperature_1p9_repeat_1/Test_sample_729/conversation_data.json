    "A power subgroup is another name for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element. To find the total number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 ($Q_{128}$), we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the group structure:** The group $Q_{128}$ has a presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{64}=1, x^{32}=y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}\\rangle$. It contains a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64. The remaining 64 elements are of the form $yx^k$.\n\n2.  **Count cyclic subgroups within $\\langle x \\rangle$**: A cyclic group of order $n$ has exactly one cyclic subgroup for each divisor of $n$. Since $\\langle x \\rangle$ has order 64, the number of cyclic subgroups it contains is equal to the number of divisors of 64. The number of divisors of $64 = 2^6$ is $6+1=7$.\n\n3.  **Count cyclic subgroups generated by elements outside $\\langle x \\rangle$**: We need to analyze the subgroups generated by elements of the form $yx^k$. All 64 of these elements can be shown to have order 4. Each distinct cyclic subgroup of order 4 is generated by two elements. For example, the subgroup $\\langle yx^k \\rangle$ is the same as $\\langle yx^{k+32} \\rangle$. Therefore, the 64 elements of this form generate $64 \\div 2 = 32$ distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\n4.  **Sum the counts**: The two sets of subgroups are disjoint. The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the subgroups from inside $\\langle x \\rangle$ and those generated by elements outside $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of divisors of an integer n.\n    For n = p^a, the number of divisors is a+1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    p, a = 0, 0\n    temp_n = n\n    # Find the prime factorization for powers of 2\n    if temp_n > 0 and (temp_n & (temp_n - 1)) == 0:\n         p = 2\n         a = int(math.log2(temp_n))\n    # A simple general method if not a power of 2\n    else:\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                if n / i == i:\n                    count += 1\n                else:\n                    count += 2\n        return count\n    return a + 1\n\ndef solve_quaternion_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 128\n    \n    # The group Q_128 has a cyclic subgroup <x> of order 64.\n    cyclic_subgroup_order = group_order // 2\n    \n    # 1.
