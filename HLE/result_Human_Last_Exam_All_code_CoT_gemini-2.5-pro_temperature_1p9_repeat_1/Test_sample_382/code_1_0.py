    # The problem asks for the greatest possible rank of a matrix E,
    # where E is a minimum-Frobenius-norm perturbation to a matrix A,
    # such that a given nonzero vector x is an exact solution to the
    # least-squares problem: min ||(A+E)y - b||_2.

    # Step 1: Formulate the least-squares condition.
    # A vector x is a solution to the least-squares problem min ||Cy - b||_2
    # if and only if the residual vector (Cx - b) is orthogonal to the
    # column space of C. This is expressed by the normal equations:
    # C^T (Cx - b) = 0.
    # In our case, C = A+E, so the condition on E is:
    # (A+E)^T ((A+E)x - b) = 0.

    # Step 2: Express the problem as a constrained minimization.
    # We want to find E that satisfies the condition above and minimizes ||E||_F.
    # Let's define two vectors:
    # r = b - Ax  (the residual of the original unperturbed problem)
    # r_E = b - (A+E)x (the residual of the new perturbed problem)
    #
    # We can rewrite r_E as:
    # r_E = b - Ax - Ex = r - Ex.
    # The condition becomes (A+E)^T r_E = 0.
    #
    # The equation `Ex = r - r_E` relates E, r, and r_E.
    # For any given new residual vector r_E, we want to find the E
    # with the minimum Frobenius norm that satisfies Ex = r - r_E.

    # Step 3: Find the minimum norm E for a fixed right-hand side.
    # This is a standard problem: find `min ||E||_F` subject to `Ex = y`.
    # The solution is given by `E = yx^+`, where `x^+` is the Moore-Penrose
    # pseudoinverse of the vector x. For a column vector `x`, `x^+ = x^T / (x^T x)`.
    #
    # In our case, y = r - r_E.
    # So, for a given `r_E`, the minimum norm E must have the form:
    # E = (r - r_E) @ x.T / (x.T @ x)

    # Step 4: Analyze the rank of the resulting E.
    # The expression for E is an outer product of two vectors:
    # u = r - r_E
    # v = x^T / (x^T @ x)
    #
    # So, E = u @ v. The rank of an outer product of two vectors is at most 1.
    # The rank is 1 if and only if both vectors are non-zero.
    # The rank is 0 if at least one of the vectors is zero.
    #
    # We are given that x is a *nonzero* vector, so the vector v is always non-zero.
    # Therefore, the rank of E depends only on the vector u = r - r_E.
    # rank(E) = rank(u)

    # Step 5: Consider the two possible cases for the rank.
    #
    # Case 1: rank(E) = 0.
    # This happens if u = r - r_E = 0.
    # If u = 0, then E = 0. The perturbation is zero.
    # This occurs if the original vector x is already a least-squares solution
    # to the unperturbed problem `min ||Ay - b||_2`.
    # In this specific scenario, E=0 is the minimal perturbation, and its rank is 0.
    #
    # Case 2: rank(E) = 1.
    # This happens if u = r - r_E != 0.
    # This will be the case whenever x is not a least-squares solution to the
    # original problem. In this situation, a non-zero perturbation E is required,
    # and the minimal norm E will have rank 1.
    # We can always construct A, b, x such that this is the case.
    #
    # Conclusion:
    # The rank of the minimal Frobenius norm perturbation E can be either 0 or 1.
    # The question asks for the *greatest possible rank*.
    # Since we can have cases where the rank is 1, the greatest possible rank is 1.

    greatest_rank = 1
    # The final equation is rank(E) = 1. We print the number in the equation.
