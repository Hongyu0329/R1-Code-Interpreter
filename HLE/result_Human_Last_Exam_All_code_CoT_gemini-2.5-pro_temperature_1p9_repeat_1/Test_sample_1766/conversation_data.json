    "For a spin-orbit coupling problem involving a p-electron, we need to find the common eigenvalues of the total angular momentum squared operator, $J^2$, and its z-component, $J_z$.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers**: A p-electron is characterized by the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$. As an electron, its spin quantum number is $s=1/2$.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum**: The total angular momentum, $\\vec{J}$, is the sum of the orbital and spin angular momenta, $\\vec{J} = \\vec{L} + \\vec{S}$. The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, $j$, are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan series, which ranges from $|l-s|$ to $l+s$.\n3.  **Calculate Eigenvalues**:\n    *   For each value of $j$, the eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n    *   For each value of $j$, the possible values for the magnetic quantum number $m_j$ range from $-j$ to $+j$ in integer steps.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by $\\hbar m_j$.\n4.  **Present Results**: I will write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints out the results in a clear and organized manner, showing the states (defined by $j$ and $m_j$) and their corresponding common eigenvalues. The script will use the `fractions` module for a more readable output of the fractional quantum numbers and eigenvalues. For clarity in the code and its output, I will express the eigenvalues in terms of $\\hbar$ (h-bar).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling_eigenvalues():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    The eigenvalues are expressed in units of h-bar (ħ).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1  # orbital quantum number for a p-electron\n    s = 0.5  # spin quantum number for an electron\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with orbital quantum number l = {l} and spin quantum number s = {s}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j, are: {', '.join(str(Fraction(j)) for j in j_values)}\\n\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 3: For each value of j, calculate the eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z\n    for j in j_values:\n        j_frac = Fraction(j)\n        \n        # Calculate the eigenvalue of J^2: j(j+1)ħ²\n        j_sq_eigenvalue_val = j * (j + 1)\n        j_sq_eigenvalue_frac = Fraction(j_sq_eigenvalue_val)\n        \n        print(f\"For the state with j = {j_frac}:\")\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue of J^2 is calculated as j(j+1)ħ².\")\n        # Show the numbers in the final equation\n        print(f\"  J^2 eigenvalue = {j_frac} * ({j_frac} + 1) ħ² = {j_frac} * ({j_frac + 1}) ħ² = {j_sq_eigenvalue_frac} ħ²\\n\")\n\n        # Determine the possible m_j values and the corresponding J_z eigenvalues\n        m_j_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        print(f\"For j = {j_frac}, the possible m_j values are: {', '.join(str(Fraction(m)) for m in m_j_values)}.\")\n        print(f\"The common eigenvalues (J^2 eigenvalue, J_z eigenvalue) are:\")\n        \n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            m_j_frac = Fraction(m_j)\n            # The eigenvalue of J_z is m_j * ħ\n            print(f\"  For state |j, m_j> = |{j_frac}, {m_j_frac}>:  ({j_sq_eigenvalue_frac} ħ², {m_j_frac} ħ)\")\n            \n        print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the solutions\nsolve_spin_orbit_coupling_eigenvalues()\n<<<J^2 eigenvalues: {15/4, 3/4} ħ^2; J_z eigenvalues: {3/2, 1/2, -1/2, -3/2} ħ>>>"
