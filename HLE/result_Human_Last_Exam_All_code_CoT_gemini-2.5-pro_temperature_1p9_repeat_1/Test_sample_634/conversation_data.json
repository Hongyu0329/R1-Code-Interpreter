    "Of course, I can help you solve this. Finding the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices can be done using an extension of the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Form a stacked matrix `M(s)` by placing the matrix `P1` on top of `P2`.\n2.  Apply a series of elementary polynomial row operations to `M(s)`. These operations do not change the GCRD of the original matrices.\n3.  The goal is to transform `M(s)` into an upper block triangular form `[G(s); 0]`, where `G(s)` has the same dimensions as `P1` and `P2`, and `0` is a zero matrix.\n4.  The resulting non-zero matrix `G(s)` is a greatest common right divisor of `P1` and `P2`.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan using the `sympy` library to handle the polynomial algebra.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD)\n    of two given polynomial matrices P1 and P2 using the extended\n    Euclidean algorithm (row reduction method).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sp.symbols('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sp.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sp.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"Given polynomial matrices:\")\n    print(\"P1(s) =\")\n    sp.pprint(P1)\n    print(\"\\nP2(s) =\")\n    sp.pprint(P2)\n\n    # --- Method Explanation ---\n    print(\"\\nTo find the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD), we use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices.\")\n    print(\"We form a stacked matrix M(s) = [P1(s); P2(s)] and apply elementary polynomial row operations to reduce it to the form [G(s); 0].\")\n    print(\"The resulting matrix G(s) will be a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s).\\n\")\n\n    # Form the stacked matrix\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n    print(\"Initial stacked matrix M(s):\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n    \n    # --- Row Operations ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Applying Elementary Row Operations ---\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Create a pivot with a constant leading term by adding row 3 to row 4 (R4 -> R4 + R3).\")\n    # M[3,:] corresponds to the 4th row (0-indexed)\n    M[3,:] = M[3,:] + M[2,:]\n    print(\"M(s) after Step 1:\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Use the new row 4 (which is [-1, 1]) as a pivot to eliminate the first element in all other rows.\")\n    # R1 -> R1 + (s^2+s)*R4\n    M[0,:] = M[0,:] + (s**2+s)*M[3,:]\n    # R2 -> R2 - (s^2+1)*R4\n    M[1,:] = M[1,:] - (s**2+1)*M[3,:]\n    # R3 -> R3 + s*R4\n    M[2,:] = M[2,:] + s*M[3,:]\n    print(\"M(s) after Step 2:\")\n    sp.pprint(M)\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Reorder the rows to get an upper triangular form for clarity.\")\n    # The current matrix M has been modified in place.
