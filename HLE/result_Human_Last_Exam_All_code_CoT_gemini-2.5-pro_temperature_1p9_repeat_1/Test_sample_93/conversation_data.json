    "Of course, I can help you with this problem.\n\nTo find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$, we need to find the number of ordered 5-tuples of non-negative integers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that satisfy the condition.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem computationally:\n1.  **Efficient Search:** A naive brute-force search checking every combination of five numbers would be computationally expensive. A more efficient strategy is to first find all the unique *sets* of five numbers whose squares sum to 2024.\n2.  **Ordered Search:** To find these unique sets without overcounting, I will search for solutions under an ordering constraint, specifically $x_1 \\ge x_2 \\ge x_3 \\ge x_4 \\ge x_5 \\ge 0$. This significantly prunes the search space. The code uses a series of nested loops with dynamically calculated upper bounds to enforce this ordering, making the search fast.\n3.  **Calculate Permutations:** For each unique set of numbers found, I will then calculate how many distinct ordered arrangements (permutations) it can form. For a set of 5 numbers where some might be repeated, the number of permutations is given by the formula for permutations of a multiset: $\\frac{5!}{n_1! n_2! \\dots n_k!}$, where $n_i$ is the count of each distinct number in the set.\n4.  **Summation:** The total number of solutions is the sum of these permutation counts over all the unique sets discovered.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan. It will print each unique solution set (representing the numbers in the equation), the number of permutations for that set, and a running total.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_diophantine_sum_of_squares():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation\n    x₁² + x₂² + x₃² + x₄² + x₅² = 2024.\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    total_solutions = 0\n    solution_sets = []\n\n    def count_permutations(numbers):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the number of permutations for a multiset of numbers.\"\"\"\n        counts = Counter(numbers)\n        denominator = 1\n        for count in counts.values():\n            denominator *= math.factorial(count)\n        return math.factorial(len(numbers)) // denominator\n\n    limit = int(math.sqrt(target))\n\n    # Search for solution sets {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5} with x1 >= x2 >= x3 >= x4 >= x5 >= 0\n    for x1 in range(limit, -1, -1):\n        s1 = x1 * x1\n        \n        limit2 = int(math.sqrt(target - s1))\n        if limit2 > x1: limit2 = x1\n\n        for x2 in range(limit2, -1, -1):\n            s2 = s1 + x2 * x2\n\n            limit3 = int(math.sqrt(target - s2))\n            if limit3 > x2: limit3 = x2\n            \n            for x3 in range(limit3, -1, -1):\n                s3 = s2 + x3 * x3\n                \n                limit4 = int(math.sqrt(target - s3))\n                if limit4 > x3: limit4 = x3\n\n                for x4 in range(limit4, -1, -1):\n                    s4 = s3 + x4 * x4\n                        \n                    x5_squared = target - s4\n                    \n                    if x5_squared < 0:\n                        continue\n                    \n                    x5 = int(math.sqrt(x5_squared))\n\n                    if x5 * x5 == x5_squared and x5 <= x4:\n                        solution_sets.append([x1, x2, x3, x4, x5])\n                            \n    print(f\"Finding non-negative integer solutions for: x₁² + x₂² + x₃² + x₄² + x₅² = {target}\\n\")\n    print(\"Found unique solution sets {x₁,x₂,x₃,x₄,x₅}, their permutations, and the cumulative total:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    # Sort the sets for a more organized output, then calculate and print results\n    for solution_set in sorted(solution_sets, reverse=True):\n        perms = count_permutations(solution_set)\n        total_solutions += perms\n        x1, x2, x3, x4, x5 = solution_set\n        \n        # Outputting the numbers for the equation as requested\n        equation_str = f\"{x1}² + {x2}² + {x3}² + {x4}² + {x5}² = 2024\"\n        \n        print(f\"Set: {str(solution_set):<28} Permutations: {perms:<6} Cumulative Total: {total_solutions:<6}\")\n        print(f\"  └─ Equation with these numbers: {equation_str}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of non-negative integer solutions is {total_solutions}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_diophantine_sum_of_squares()\n```\n<<<4600>>>"
