    # The problem describes a population that meets the conditions for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE):
    # - Infinitely large (no genetic drift)
    # - Random mating
    # - No mutation
    # - No gene flow
    # - No selection

    # --- Statement 1 Analysis ---
    print("1. Analysis of 'There is no selection occurring on the phenotype measured.'")
    # The prompt explicitly states two key facts:
    # a) The trait has "no bearing on fitness".
    # b) "all genotypes have equal fitness".
    # These are the definitions of no natural selection acting on the population or the trait.
    is_statement_1_true = True

    # --- Statement 2 Analysis ---
    print("2. Analysis of 'Parents will not raise their offspring.'")
    # The prompt states the population has "discrete and non-overlapping generations".
    # This means the parental generation dies before the offspring generation reproduces.
    # While this often implies no parental care, it is not a logical necessity. For example,
    # parents could care for their young and then die before the young reach sexual maturity.
    # The information given is about the genetic model, not necessarily specific parenting behaviors.

    print("   Result: This statement does not have to be true. It is a possible scenario but not a required one.\n")

    # --- Statement 3 Analysis ---
    print("3. Analysis of 'The population will never speciate even in future generations.'")
    # Speciation requires evolutionary change to create reproductive isolation.
    # Evolution is defined as a change in allele frequencies over time.
    # The conditions provided (no selection, no mutation, no gene flow, no drift) describe
    # a population in HWE, which by definition is not evolving.
    # As long as the conditions of the model hold, speciation cannot occur.
    is_statement_3_true = True
    print("   Result: This statement MUST be true. The conditions for evolution, and thus speciation, are absent.\n")

    # --- Statement 4 Analysis ---
    print("4. Analysis of 'The researcher will not find a substantial difference in the phenotype measured between the west and east groups of individuals.'")
    # Phenotype (P) is a result of Genotype (G) and Environment (E).
    # The broad-sense heritability (H^2) is 0.7.
    # This relationship can be expressed with variances: V(P) = V(G) + V(E).
    # H^2 = V(G) / V(P) = 0.7.
    # This means that the environmental variance V(E) is responsible for 1.0 - 0.7 = 0.3, or 30%, of the total phenotypic variance.
    # While random mating across the whole region ensures that the genetic makeup is uniform (the west and east are genetically identical),
    # the problem does not state that the environment is uniform.
    # If the environment in the west differs from the east (e.g., temperature, resources), this could cause a substantial difference in the average phenotype.
    is_statement_4_true = False
    print("   Result: This statement does not have to be true. An environmental difference between the two halves could create a phenotypic difference.\n")
