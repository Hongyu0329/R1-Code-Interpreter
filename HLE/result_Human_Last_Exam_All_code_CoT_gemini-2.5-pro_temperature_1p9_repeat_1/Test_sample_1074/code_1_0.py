# The problem asks for the minimum value of y = n_5 (number of Sylow 5-subgroups)
# such that for a finite group G, if n_3 <= 9 and n_5 = y, then G is nonsolvable.

# By Sylow's theorems, n_p must be congruent to 1 mod p.
# For p=5, n_5 can be 1, 6, 11, 16, ...
# For p=3, n_3 can be 1, 4, 7, 10, ... The condition n_3 <= 9 restricts n_3 to {1, 4, 7}.

# We test the possible values of y, starting from the smallest.
# y = 1: A solvable group G = A_4 x C_5 exists with n_3(G) = 4 and n_5(G) = 1.
# So y=1 does not guarantee nonsolvability.

# The next possible value for y is 6.
# A non-trivial theorem in group theory states that if a group G has n_5 = 6,
# it must have the alternating group A_5 as a composition factor, which implies G is nonsolvable.
# Since this holds for any group with n_5 = 6, it holds for groups that also satisfy n_3 <= 9.
# Therefore, y=6 is the minimum value that guarantees nonsolvability.

# We can find this value with a simple equation.
# y is the smallest integer > 1 such that y % 5 == 1.
k = 1
y = 5 * k + 1

# The "equation" is based on finding the next candidate for y after 1.
# It can be represented as finding the first step in the arithmetic progression.
