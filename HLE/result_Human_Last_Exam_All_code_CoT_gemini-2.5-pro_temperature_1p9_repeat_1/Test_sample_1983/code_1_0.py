def solve_difference_equation_problem():
    """
    Solves the problem based on the provided difference equation and its parameters.

    The solution proceeds as follows:
    1. Define the given constants.
    2. Determine the values of lambda_1 and lambda_2 from the expression "lambda_2 = 0.5 * lambda_1 = 0.5".
    3. State the formulas for the asymptotic bounds on ||x_n||. For the n -> -infinity limit, this is given by Theorem 2 of the reference. For the n -> +infinity limit, which corresponds to the resonant case lambda_1 = 1, we hypothesize a symmetric formula based on the patterns in the reference paper.
    4. Assume the bounds are achieved with equality and that limsup equals liminf to find a definite value.
    5. Calculate the two terms of the expression and the final result.
    6. Print all calculations step-by-step.
