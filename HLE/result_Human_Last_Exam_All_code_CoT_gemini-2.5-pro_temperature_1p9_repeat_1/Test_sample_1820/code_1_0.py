    """
    Calculates the theoretical completeness bound for an ontology mapping scenario.

    The problem describes a mapping from ontology O1 to O2.
    - O1 has a branching factor 'b' and depth 'd'.
    - O2 has a strict categorical structure.
    - O1 contains 'mergeable sibling classes', which creates logical conflicts when
      mapping to O2's strict (disjoint) sibling structure.

    According to information-theoretic models of ontology alignment, the
    theoretical completeness of such a mapping is bounded by ln(b)/d. This formula
    quantifies the structural information that is inevitably lost.
