    "To answer this question, I will write a Python script that demonstrates how critical-level views violate one of the listed conditions.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will explain the \"critical-level view\" of population ethics. This view posits that adding a new person to a population is good only if their welfare is above a certain positive \"critical level.\"\n2.  Next, I will define the \"Non-Elitism\" condition. This condition states that for any population of very happy people, there exists some larger population of people with a lower (but still positive) level of welfare that is considered better.\n3.  I will then set up a simulation with two hypothetical populations to test this condition:\n    *   **Population A:** A small population where each individual has a very high welfare level.\n    *   **Population B:** A very large population where each individual has a welfare level that is positive but *below* the critical level.\n4.  The script will calculate the total value of each population based on the critical-level view's formula: `Total Value = Î£ (welfare - critical_level)`.\n5.  Finally, by comparing the total values, the script will show that Population A is always considered better than Population B, no matter how large Population B becomes. This directly violates the Non-Elitism condition.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates how critical-level views violate the Non-Elitism condition.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
