# This script lays out the reasoning and calculation for the ordinal expression.

# Part 1: Determination of γ
# The set X is determined to be {0, 1, 2, ..., ℵ_0}.
# This set, when its elements (cardinals) are ordered by size,
# has the same order structure as the natural numbers followed by one limit point.
# Therefore, its order type, γ, is ω + 1.
gamma = "ω+1"

print(f"The set X is {{0, 1, 2, ..., ℵ₀}}.")

# Part 2: The Ordinal Calculation

print(f"Substituting γ = {gamma}, we get: ({gamma}) * {omega_1} + ({gamma})")
