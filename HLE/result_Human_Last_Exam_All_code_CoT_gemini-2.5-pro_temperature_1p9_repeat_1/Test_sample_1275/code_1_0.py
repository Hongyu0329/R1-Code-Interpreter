    # Part A: Must every geodesic word representing an element in alpha(K) be fully quasireduced if K is rational?
    # No. A counterexample can be constructed if the group G has torsion.
    # Let k be a torsion element. K = {k} is a rational set. alpha(K) contains k.
    # Geodesics representing torsion elements are not fully quasireduced.
    answer_A = "No"

    # Part B: Is there a finite bound for epsilon such that a fully (1, epsilon)-quasireduced word in alpha(K) exists for a rational K?
    # No. For a bound to exist, a fully (1, epsilon)-quasireduced word must first exist.
    # Such a word must represent a loxodromic element.
    # If K consists only of torsion elements, alpha(K) will also only contain torsion elements.
    # In this case, no such word exists, so a universal bound cannot be given.
    answer_B = "No"

    # Part C: Is it true that alpha(K) contains only quasigeodesic words if K is context-free?
    # No. A word is quasigeodesic only if it represents a loxodromic element.
    # The same counterexample from A applies. Let K = {k} where k is a torsion element.
    # K is finite and thus context-free. alpha(K) contains k, which is not represented by quasigeodesic words.
    answer_C = "No"
