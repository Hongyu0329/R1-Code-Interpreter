    Solves the problem by identifying the true statements among the given options.
    
    The reasoning for each statement is as follows:
    A) False. Generator spectra can be continuous (e.g., momentum).
    B1) False. The commutator [Ĥ, τ̂] is non-zero for V ~ 1/r^2 potentials.
    B2) False. The scaling factor is incorrect.
    C) False. The condition is necessary and sufficient.
    D) True. This is a direct result of [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0.
    E) True. This is the definition of the rotation operator.
    F) True. A consequence of the Heisenberg equation of motion.
    G) False. The condition given is always true and does not imply Hermiticity.
    H) False. A counterexample is L̂_z, which is unbounded but has a discrete spectrum.
    I) True. From the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for non-commuting operators.
    J) True. A fundamental consequence of a symmetry commuting with the Hamiltonian.
    
    The true statements are D, E, F, I, J.
    The final answer is the concatenation of these letters in alphabetical order.
