  reason_c = "The conditions imply that G acts quasiprimitively on the faces, and has the structure G = N x H where H is cyclic and the action is on a set of size |N|. This forces the socle of G to be N itself and to be regular. The types of quasiprimitive groups with a regular socle are Holomorph Affine (HA), Almost Simple (AS, in regular representation), and Twisted Wreath (TW). Other types are ruled out either because their socle is not regular or because the point stabilizer (H) would need to have a non-cyclic structure."
