    "To solve this problem, we first need to determine the overall shape and dimensions of the figure described by the parametric equations. We can analyze the curve in two parts as defined.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the curve for t in [0, π]**\n*   The equations are `x = cos(t)` and `y = sin(t)`.\n*   This is the standard parameterization for the upper half of a unit circle (since `x^2 + y^2 = cos^2(t) + sin^2(t) = 1` and `sin(t) >= 0` for this interval).\n*   The range of `x` is from `cos(π) = -1` to `cos(0) = 1`.\n*   The range of `y` is from `0` to `sin(π/2) = 1`.\n*   So, for this part, the figure occupies the space where `x` is in `[-1, 1]` and `y` is in `[0, 1]`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the curve for t in (π, 2π)**\n*   The equations are `x = cos(t)` and `y = 5*sin(t)`.\n*   This represents the lower half of an ellipse (since `x^2 + (y/5)^2 = cos^2(t) + sin^2(t) = 1` and `sin(t) < 0` for this interval).\n*   The range of `x` is from `cos(π) = -1` to `cos(2π) = 1`.\n*   The range of `y` is from `0` to `5*sin(3π/2) = -5`.\n*   So, for this part, the figure occupies the space where `x` is in `[-1, 1]` and `y` is in `[-5, 0)`.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the overall bounding box**\n*   To find the bounding box for the entire figure, we take the minimum and maximum values for `x` and `y` across both parts.\n*   Overall x-range: `min(-1, -1)` to `max(1, 1)`, which is `[-1, 1]`. The width is `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n*   Overall y-range: `min(-5, 0)` to `max(0, 1)`, which is `[-5, 1]`. The height is `1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the smallest enclosing square**\n*   The smallest square that can outcircle (enclose) this figure must have a side length equal to the larger of the figure's width and height.\n*   Side length = `max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the area**\n*   The area of this square is `side_length^2`.\n*   Area = `6 * 6 = 36`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints these values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the boundaries for the two parts of the curve\n# Part 1: t in [0, pi], x=cos(t), y=sin(t)\nx_min1 = -1.0\nx_max1 = 1.0\ny_min1 = 0.0\ny_max1 = 1.0\n\n# Part 2: t in (pi, 2pi), x=cos(t), y=5*sin(t)\nx_min2 = -1.0\nx_max2 = 1.0\ny_min2 = -5.0\ny_max2 = 0.0\n\n# Determine the overall minimum and maximum coordinates for the entire figure\nx_min_total = min(x_min1, x_min2)\nx_max_total = max(x_max1, x_max2)\ny_min_total = min(y_min1, y_min2)\ny_max_total = max(y_max1, y_max2)\n\n# Calculate the width and height of the figure's bounding box\nwidth = x_max_total - x_min_total\nheight = y_max_total - y_min_total\n\n# The side length of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the width and height\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\n# Calculate the area of the square\narea = side_length ** 2\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation\nprint(f\"The total width of the figure is {x_max_total} - ({x_min_total}) = {width}\")\nprint(f\"The total height of the figure is {y_max_total} - ({y_min_total}) = {height}\")\nprint(f\"The side of the smallest square that outcircles the figure must be the maximum of its width and height.\")\nprint(f\"Side length = max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}\")\nprint(f\"The area of the square is {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}\")\n```\n<<<36.0>>>"
