    "My plan is to find the pattern in the given sequence.\n1.  I'll first test for a simple arithmetic or geometric progression. If that fails, I'll look for a more complex recurrence relation.\n2.  I will test the hypothesis that each term is related to the previous term by the formula: `next_term = 2 * previous_term + residual`.\n3.  I will calculate the sequence of these `residual` values.\n4.  Then, I will analyze the sequence of residuals to find its underlying pattern. It seems the differences between the residuals follow a geometric progression.\n5.  Using the pattern found in the residuals, I will calculate the next residual needed.\n6.  Finally, I will use this next residual value to compute the missing term in the original sequence and present the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_term():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the sequence to find the next term.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    s = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the relationship between consecutive terms:\")\n    print(\"The pattern appears to be next_term = 2 * current_term + residual.\\n\")\n    \n    residuals = []\n    # Loop to find the residual for each step\n    for i in range(len(s) - 1):\n        current_term = s[i]\n        next_term = s[i+1]\n        residual = next_term - 2 * current_term\n        residuals.append(residual)\n        print(f\"{next_term} = 2 * {current_term} + {residual}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe sequence of residuals is:\", residuals)\n    \n    # We observe that the pattern in the residuals starts from the second residual.\n    # Let's analyze the sub-sequence of residuals starting from the second one.\n    sub_residuals = residuals[1:]\n    print(\"\\nAnalyzing the pattern in the residuals, starting from the second one:\", sub_residuals)\n    \n    # Calculate the differences between these residuals\n    residual_diffs = []\n    for i in range(len(sub_residuals) - 1):\n        diff = sub_residuals[i+1] - sub_residuals[i]\n        residual_diffs.append(diff)\n    \n    print(f\"The differences between these residuals are {residual_diffs[0]} and {residual_diffs[1]}.\")\n    print(\"The sequence of differences [4, 12] is a geometric progression with a ratio of 3 (12 / 4 = 3).\")\n    \n    # Calculate the next difference and the next residual\n    next_diff = residual_diffs[-1] * 3\n    print(f\"\\nThe next difference should be 12 * 3 = {next_diff}.\")\n    \n    next_residual = sub_residuals[-1] + next_diff\n    print(f\"The next residual should be 17 + {next_diff} = {next_residual}.\")\n    \n    # Calculate the final term in the main sequence\n    last_known_term = s[-1]\n    next_term_in_sequence = 2 * last_known_term + next_residual\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{int(next_term_in_sequence)} = 2 * {last_known_term} + {next_residual}\")\n\nfind_next_term()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
