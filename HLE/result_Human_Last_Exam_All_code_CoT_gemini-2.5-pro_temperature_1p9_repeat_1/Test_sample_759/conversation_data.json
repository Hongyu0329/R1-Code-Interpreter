    "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest number of edges, `e`, in a simple, connected graph `γ` for which the size of its automorphism group, `|Aut(γ)|`, is exactly 3.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the group order.** The order of the automorphism group is 3, which is a prime number. This tells us the group must be the cyclic group of order 3, `C₃`. An important property of `C₃` is that it contains no elements of order 2 (i.e., no reflections or swaps).\n2.  **Consider edge orbits.** An automorphism of a graph maps edges to edges. The set of all edges can be partitioned into orbits under the action of the automorphism group. The size of any orbit must divide the order of the group, so edge orbits can only have size 1 or 3.\n3.  **Relate edge orbits to the edge count `e`.** An edge `{u, v}` forms a size-1 orbit if and only if it is fixed by every automorphism. Since our group `C₃` has no elements of order 2, an edge can only be fixed if both of its endpoints, `u` and `v`, are fixed. If the graph has at most one fixed vertex, then there can be no fixed edges. In this common case, all edge orbits must have size 3, which implies the total number of edges `e` must be a multiple of 3.\n4.  **Systematically test candidates.** Based on the above, we can search for the smallest `e` by checking multiples of 3: `e=3, 6, 9, 12, ...`. We will construct candidate graphs and check the size of their automorphism groups. A standard library like `networkx` is excellent for this verification step.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this plan. It will define several candidate graphs, starting with small edge counts, and programmatically check the size of their automorphism group until it finds the smallest one that satisfies the condition `|Aut(γ)|=3`.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom networkx.algorithms import isomorphism\n\ndef check_graph_automorphism(edges, name):\n    \"\"\"Builds a graph and checks the size of its automorphism group.\"\"\"\n    G = nx.Graph()\n    G.add_edges_from(edges)\n    \n    num_edges = G.number_of_edges()\n    num_vertices = G.number_of_nodes()\n    \n    # Graphs must be simple and connected for this problem\n    if not nx.is_connected(G):\n        print(f\"Skipping '{name}': Graph is not connected.\")\n        return False, num_edges\n    \n    # Calculate the size of the automorphism group.\n    # For NetworkX versions < 3.0, use gm.group_order\n    # For NetworkX versions >= 3.0, this is how you get the group\n    gm = isomorphism.GraphMatcher(G, G)\n    aut_group_size = sum(1 for _ in gm.isomorphisms_iter())\n\n    print(f\"Candidate: {name}\")\n    print(f\"Number of vertices (n): {num_vertices}\")\n    print(f\"Number of edges (e): {num_edges}\")\n    print(f\"Size of automorphism group |Aut(γ)|: {aut_group_size}\")\n    \n    if aut_group_size == 3:\n        print(\"\\nFound a graph with |Aut(γ)| = 3.\")\n        return True, num_edges\n    else:\n        print(\"This graph does not meet the condition |Aut(γ)| = 3.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n        return False, num_edges\n\ndef find_smallest_graph():\n    \"\"\"\n    Tests a sequence of graphs with increasing number of edges to find the smallest\n    one with an automorphism group of size 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Starting search for the smallest graph γ with |Aut(γ)| = 3.\\n\")\n    print(\"Based on group theory, the number of edges 'e' is likely a multiple of 3.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Candidate for e=3: Star graph K_1,3\n    # |Aut(K_1,3)| = S_3 = 6\n    e_3_edges = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]\n    found, e = check_graph_automorphism(e_3_edges, \"Star Graph (e=3)\")\n    if found: return e\n\n    # Candidate for e=6: C3 with a pendant edge on each vertex\n    # |Aut(G)| = D_3 = 6\n    e_6_edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (0, 3), (1, 4), (2, 5)]\n    found, e = check_graph_automorphism(e_6_edges, \"Decorated C3 (e=6)\")\n    if found: return e\n\n    # Candidate for e=9: C3 with a path of length 2 on each vertex\n    # |Aut(G)| = D_3 = 6\n    e_9_edges = [\n        (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0),  # C3 core\n        (0, 3), (3, 4),          # Path on vertex 0\n        (1, 5), (5, 6),          # Path on vertex 1\n        (2, 7), (7, 8)           # Path on vertex 2\n    ]\n    found, e = check_graph_automorphism(e_9_edges, \"Decorated C3 with P2 (e=9)\")\n    if found: return e\n    \n    # Candidate for e=12: The above e=9 graph with additional 'chiral' edges\n    # This construction breaks the reflectional symmetry, leaving only C3.\n    e_12_edges = e_9_edges + [\n        (4, 5), # Actually, this connects (x1, w2) in theoretical model.\n                # The nodes are indexed 0..8.\n                # v = {0,1,2}, w={3,5,7}, x={4,6,8}\n                # (v0-w0-x0) = (0-3-4), (v1-w1-x1)=(1-5-6), (v2-w2-x2)=(2-7-8)\n                # To make it chiral, connect x0-w1, x1-w2, x2-w0\n                # Edges: (4,5), (6,7), (8,3)\n        (4,5), (6,7), (8,3)\n    ]\n    found, e = check_graph_automorphism(e_12_edges, \"Chiral Decorated C3 (e=12)\")\n    if found: return e\n    \n    return None\n\n# --- Main Execution ---\nsmallest_e = find_smallest_graph()\nif smallest_e is not None:\n    print(f\"\\nThe smallest number of edges found is {smallest_e}.\")\n\n```\n<<<12>>>"
