# This problem is a mathematical question about topological groups.
# The solution is derived through a logical proof rather than a calculation.
# The proof, as outlined in the steps above, demonstrates that no topology
# on the integers can satisfy both of the given conditions simultaneously.
#
# In the Hausdorff case, the conditions force the topology to be discrete, which
# is not totally bounded.
# In the non-Hausdorff case, the conditions allow for the construction of a
# sequence like (m, 2m, 3m, ...), which is a nontrivial convergent sequence,
# violating the premise.
#
# Since both cases lead to a contradiction, we can conclude that there are no such topologies.

number_of_topologies = 0

# The reasoning leads to the conclusion that there are 0 such topologies.
# No equation is needed to find this number.
