    "To answer whether polynucleotides are structurally polysaccharides, we need to compare their fundamental building blocks (monomers) and the way these blocks are linked together.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  Define the monomer for a polysaccharide. It's a simple sugar (a monosaccharide).\n2.  Define the monomer for a polynucleotide. It's a nucleotide, which is more complex, consisting of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\n3.  Define the chemical bonds that link these monomers. Polysaccharides use glycosidic bonds, while polynucleotides use phosphodiester bonds.\n4.  Write a Python script that visually represents these two different types of polymers by \"building\" a short chain of each.\n5.  The script will print out these representative structures and a concluding statement that directly answers the question based on the clear structural differences.\n\n```python\ndef explain_polymer_structures():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script compares the structures of polysaccharides and polynucleotides\n    to answer whether they are structurally similar.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define the building blocks (monomers) ---\n    # A polysaccharide is made of simple sugar units (monosaccharides).\n    monosaccharide = \"(Sugar)\"\n    \n    # A polynucleotide is made of nucleotide units.\n    # Each nucleotide has three parts: a phosphate, a sugar, and a base.\n    nucleotide = \"(Phosphate-Sugar-Base)\"\n\n    # --- Step 2: Define the bonds linking the monomers ---\n    polysaccharide_bond = \"-[Glycosidic Bond]-\"\n    polynucleotide_bond = \"-[Phosphodiester Bond]-\"\n\n    # --- Step 3: \"Build\" a small polymer of each type to visualize ---\n    # A chain of 3 units for clarity.\n    \n    # Equation for a polysaccharide (e.g., starch, cellulose)\n    polysaccharide_chain = (\n        monosaccharide + polysaccharide_bond +\n        monosaccharide + polysaccharide_bond +\n        monosaccharide\n    )\n\n    # Equation for a homopolynucleotide (e.g., Poly-A tail of mRNA)\n    # Even in a \"homo-\" polynucleotide, the repeating unit is still the complex nucleotide.\n    polynucleotide_chain = (\n        nucleotide + polynucleotide_bond +\n        nucleotide + polynucleotide_bond +\n        nucleotide\n    )\n\n    # --- Step 4: Print the comparison and conclusion ---\n    print(\"Let's compare the structure of a Polysaccharide and a Polynucleotide.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Structural Equation of a Polysaccharide:\")\n    print(polysaccharide_chain)\n    print(f\"Its repeating monomer is a {monosaccharide}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Structural Equation of a Polynucleotide:\")\n    print(polynucleotide_chain)\n    print(f\"Its repeating monomer is a {nucleotide}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"As the structures show, these two polymers are fundamentally different:\")\n    print(\"1.
