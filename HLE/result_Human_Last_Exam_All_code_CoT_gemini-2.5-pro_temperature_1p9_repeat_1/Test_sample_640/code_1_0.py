    Analyzes the statements about quantum scattering and identifies the correct ones.
    
    The relationships are as follows:
    1. V(r) nontrivially coupled <=> F(E) nontrivially coupled.
    2. F(E) trivially coupled => S(E) trivially coupled.
    3. S(E) trivially coupled =/=> F(E) trivially coupled (due to accidental decoupling).

    This leads to the following conclusions about the statements:
    1. Correct: S_nontrivial => F_nontrivial => V_nontrivial.
    2. Incorrect: S_diagonal (trivial) can come from F_nontrivial, which comes from V_nontrivial.
    3. Correct: Follows directly from relationship 1.
    4. Incorrect: F_nontrivial can lead to S_trivial (accidental decoupling).
    5. Incorrect: Contradicts relationship 1. A diagonal F is trivial, so V must be trivial.
