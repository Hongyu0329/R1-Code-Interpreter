    print("\nC. ... the polygenic score ... will not approach a variance explained of 50% due to gene-gene interactions...")
    print(f"This is not necessarily true because it assumes that non-additive variance must exist. It is theoretically possible that all genetic variance is additive, in which case the PGS could approach a variance explained of {H_sq}.")
    print("\nD. The existence of any epigenetic effects would limit the narrow-sense heritability to less than 0.5.")
    print(f"This is not true. Epigenetic effects contribute to environmental variance (Ve), not genetic variance (Vg). Their existence does not prevent a scenario where all genetic variance is additive (h^2 = H^2 = {H_sq}).")
