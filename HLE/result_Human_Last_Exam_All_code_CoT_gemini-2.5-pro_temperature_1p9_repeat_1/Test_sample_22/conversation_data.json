    "The user is asking a conceptual question about genetics and wants me to determine if the following statement is true or false: \"The predictive ability of a polygenic score, measured by variance explained, is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability for the phenotype.\"\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define Key Terms**:\n    *   **SNP heritability (h²_snp)**: This is the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by all common SNPs combined. It represents the *theoretical upper limit* of predictive power from a linear model using these SNPs, assuming their true effects are known.\n    *   **Polygenic Score (PGS)**: This is a practical tool. It's a score for an individual, calculated by summing their alleles weighted by *estimated* effect sizes from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n    *   **Predictive Ability (R²)**: This is the proportion of variance in the phenotype (in an independent sample) that is actually explained by the calculated PGS.\n\n2.  **Compare the Concepts**: The core difference is between a *theoretical maximum* (SNP heritability with true effects) and a *practical implementation* (PGS with estimated effects). A PGS's accuracy is limited by real-world factors, primarily the fact that the effect sizes are estimated from a finite GWAS sample, which introduces statistical noise and error.\n\n3.  **Illustrate with Code**: I will write a Python script to illustrate this principle quantitatively. The script will use a well-established formula that approximates the expected maximum R² of a PGS based on the SNP heritability (h²_snp), the GWAS sample size (N), and the effective number of causal SNPs (M). This formula is:\n    *   `Expected PGS R² = h²_snp / (1 + M / (N * h²_snp))`\n    By plugging in plausible numbers, the script will show that the expected R² from the PGS is always less than the SNP heritability, h²_snp, for any finite sample size N.\n\n4.  **Final Answer**: Based on this reasoning, the statement is true. The script will provide a concrete demonstration, and I will conclude with the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef demonstrate_pgs_limitations():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates why the predictive ability of a Polygenic Score (PGS)\n    is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability of a trait.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # SNP heritability (h²_snp): The theoretical maximum variance explained by all SNPs.\n    # This is a property of the trait itself.\n    h2_snp = 0.50\n\n    # GWAS sample size (N): The number of individuals in the study used to estimate SNP effects.\n    N = 150000\n\n    # Effective number of causal variants (M): A measure of the genetic complexity of the trait.\n    M = 10000\n\n    print(\"This script illustrates the relationship between SNP heritability and Polygenic Score (PGS) predictive ability.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"1.
