    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding the particle within a specific interval in a 1D potential box.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Wavefunction and Probability Density:** The state of a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is described by its wavefunction `ψ_n(x)`. The probability of finding the particle at a given position is proportional to the square of the wavefunction, `|ψ_n(x)|^2`, known as the probability density function.\n    The normalized probability density is: `P(x) = (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a)`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Probability over an Interval:** The probability of finding the particle in the interval from `x1` to `x2` is the definite integral of the probability density function over that interval:\n    `P(x1 < x < x2) = ∫[from x1 to x2] (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a) dx`.\n\n3.  **Numerical Integration:** This integral can be solved analytically, but it's often more practical and less error-prone to use a numerical method, especially for well-established libraries. We will use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function, which is a highly reliable tool for numerical integration.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:**\n    *   Set the given parameters: `n=2`, `x1=0.495a`, `x2=0.505a`. For simplicity in the code, we can set the box length `a=1`, as the 'a' cancels out in the final probability calculation.\n    *   Define the probability density function in Python.\n    *   Call `scipy.integrate.quad` to compute the integral.\n    *   Print the parameters used in the calculation and the final result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# 1. Define the parameters of the problem.\nn = 2\n# We can set the box length 'a' to 1.0, as the probability is a relative measure\n# and the 'a' variable cancels out in the definite integral.\na = 1.0\nx1_factor = 0.495\nx2_factor = 0.505\nx1 = x1_factor * a\nx2 = x2_factor * a\n\n# 2. Define the probability density function |ψ(x)|² for a particle in a 1D box.\ndef probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability density for a particle in a 1D box.\n    P(x) = (2/a) * sin^2(n*π*x/a)\n    \"\"\"\n    return (2.0 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n# 3. Integrate the probability density function from x1 to x2.\n# The result is a tuple: (integral_value, estimated_error)\nprobability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# 4. Output the final equation and its result.\n# The probability is calculated by the equation: P = ∫ |ψ(x)|² dx\nprint(\"The final equation for the probability (P) is:\")\nprint(f\"P = Integral from {x1_factor}a to {x2_factor}a of (2/a) * sin^2({n}*π*x/a) dx\")\nprint(\"\\nPlugging in the numbers, this gives:\")\n# We format the probability in scientific notation for clarity.\nprint(f\"P = {probability:.4e}\")\n<<<6.5796e-05>>>"
