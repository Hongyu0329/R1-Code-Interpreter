    "My plan to solve this problem involves these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the function `F₃(x)`**: First, I will determine the explicit formula for `F₃(x)` by substituting the previous function definitions.\n    *   `F₀(x) = x`\n    *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n    *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n2.  **Analyze the Integral**: The integral to evaluate is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`. This is a standard logarithmic derivative form. The antiderivative of `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln|f(x)|`. In this case, the antiderivative is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:\n    `[ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1 = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)| = ln(|F₃(1) / F₃(0)|)`\n\n4.  **Calculate Endpoint Values**: I will calculate the values of `F₃(x)` at the endpoints `x=0` and `x=1`.\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(2)`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Answer**:\n    *   First, calculate the value of the integral, `V = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))`.\n    *   Then, compute `10000 * V`.\n    *   Finally, round this result to the nearest integer as requested.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to perform these calculations and print the required values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the values of F₃(x) at x=0 and x=1\n# The function is F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\n# At x=0: F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^sin(0)) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(2)\nf3_at_0 = math.log(2)\n\n# At x=1: F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^sin(1))\nf3_at_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\n\n# Step 2: Evaluate the definite integral V\n# ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 = [ln(F₃(x))] from 0 to 1\n# V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0))\nV = math.log(f3_at_1 / f3_at_0)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final required value\n# Find the closest integer to 10000 * V\nfinal_result = round(10000 * V)\n\n# Print the final equation with all its numerical components\nprint(\"The definite integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 evaluates to ln(F₃(1) / F₃(0)).\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = {f3_at_0}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(\"The final equation for the integral's value V is:\")\nprint(f\"V = ln({f3_at_1} / {f3_at_0})\")\nprint(f\"V ≈ {V}\")\nprint(\"\\nWe need to find the closest integer to 10000 * V:\")\nprint(f\"10000 * V ≈ {10000 * V}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {final_result}\")\n\n```\n<<<5488>>>"
