# The user wants to find the value of [X] for the space X = [0,1]^3.

# Definition of [X]:
# The space X is called n-compact if it has an open sub-basis S such that
# every cover of X by elements from S has a subcover with n or fewer elements.
# The value [X] is the minimum such n.

# [X] is a topological invariant, also known as the subbase covering number of X.

# A key theorem in dimension theory connects this number to the Lebesgue
# covering dimension of the space. For a compact metric space X with
# covering dimension `dim(X)`, it is known that [X] is bounded by the dimension.
# For many "well-behaved" spaces, including the D-dimensional cube ([0,1]^D),
# the relationship is an equality:
# [X] = dim(X) + 1

# Let's apply this theorem to the given space X = [0,1]^3.

# 1. Identify the space and its dimension.
# The space is the unit cube in 3 dimensions.
# The covering dimension of [0,1]^3 is D.
D = 3

# 2. Apply the theorem to calculate [X].
# [X] = D + 1
one = 1
result = D + one

# 3. Print the result and the reasoning.
# The final code needs to output each number in the final equation.
print("The space is X = [0,1]^3, the 3-dimensional unit cube.")
print(f"The covering dimension of this space is D = {D}.")
print("For a D-dimensional cube, the value [X] is given by the formula: [X] = D + 1.")
print("Therefore, for X = [0,1]^3:")
print(f"[{'X'}] = {D} + {one} = {result}")
