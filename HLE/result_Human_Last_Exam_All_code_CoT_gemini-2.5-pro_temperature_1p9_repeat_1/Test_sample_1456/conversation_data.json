    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible value for the number of composants of the product space `Z = X x Y`, where `X` and `Y` are any two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify possible numbers of composants for a single continuum:** First, we need to know what values are possible for the number of composants of a single continuum `K`, let's denote this `n(K)`. It is a known result in continuum theory that `n(K)` can be 1, `aleph_0` (countably infinite), or `c` (the cardinality of the continuum).\n2.  **Find the rule for the number of composants of a product:** Next, we need a rule to calculate `n(X x Y)` based on `n(X)` and `n(Y)`. Theorems by Luttmann and Bellamy (1975) provide this:\n    *   If `n(X) = 1`, then `n(X x Y) = n(Y)`.\n    *   If `n(Y) = 1`, then `n(X x Y) = n(X)`.\n    *   If `n(X) > 1` and `n(Y) > 1`, then `n(X x Y) = n(X) * n(Y)`.\n3.  **Systematically find the maximum:** We can combine these facts to find the maximum possible value. We can consider all combinations of possible values for `n(X)` and `n(Y)` and calculate `n(X x Y)` for each case. The maximum among these results will be our answer.\n\nI will write a Python script to formalize this process. The script will:\n*   Represent the possible cardinalities for the number of composants (`1`, `aleph_0`, `c`).\n*   Implement the rules for cardinal arithmetic (e.g., `aleph_0 * c = c`).\n*   Implement the rules for calculating the number of composants of a product space.\n*   Iterate through all possibilities for `n(X)` and `n(Y)` to find the maximum possible `n(X x Y)`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_composants_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest possible number of composants of the product of two \n    nondegenerate continua by analyzing the possible cardinalities.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the possible numbers of composants for a single continuum.\n    # These are 1, aleph_0 (countably infinite), and c (cardinality of the continuum).\n    # We represent these as strings for clarity.\n    possible_n_K = ['1', 'aleph_0', 'c']\n    \n    # Define a simple ordering for these cardinals to find the maximum.\n    cardinal_order = {'1': 1, 'aleph_0': 2, 'c': 3}\n\n    def cardinal_multiply(c1, c2):\n        \"\"\"Multiplies two cardinals represented as strings.\"\"\"\n        if c1 == '1':\n            return c2\n        if c2 == '1':\n            return c1\n        # Any product involving 'c' (and not '1') results in 'c'.\n        if c1 == 'c' or c2 == 'c':\n            return 'c'\n        # The product of two countably infinite sets is countably infinite.\n        if c1 == 'aleph_0' and c2 == 'aleph_0':\n            return 'aleph_0'\n        # This part should not be reached with the given inputs.\n        raise ValueError(f\"Unknown cardinal multiplication: {c1} * {c2}\")\n\n    def num_composants_product(nx, ny):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates n(X x Y) given n(X) and n(Y), based on theorems from continuum theory.\n        \"\"\"\n        if nx == '1':\n            return ny\n        if ny == '1':\n            return nx\n        # Case where both continua have more than one composant.\n        return cardinal_multiply(nx, ny)\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the number of composants n(X x Y) for all possible cases of n(X) and n(Y):\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    max_num_composants_str = '1'\n\n    # Step 3: Iterate through all possibilities to find the maximum.\n    for nx in possible_n_K:\n        for ny in possible_n_K:\n            # For each combination of n(X) and n(Y), calculate n(X x Y).\n            n_prod = num_composants_product(nx, ny)\n            \n            # This follows the request to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n            print(f\"If n(X) = {nx:<7} and n(Y) = {ny:<7}, then n(X x Y) = {n_prod}\")\n\n            # Keep track of the maximum value found so far.\n            if cardinal_order[n_prod] > cardinal_order[max_num_composants_str]:\n                max_num_composants_str = n_prod\n\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(f\"The largest possible number of composants found is {max_num_composants_str}.\")\n\nsolve_composants_problem()\n\n```\n<<<c>>>"
