    Analyzes the function of bypass notches in sheet metal forming and selects the best explanation.

    In sheet metal forming, the goal is to stretch and shape a flat blank into a 3D part
    without defects like tears, wrinkles, or excessive thinning. The material for the
    final part must come from the initial blank, a process called "material flow" or "inflow".

    Complex part geometries, such as sharp corners or small radii, can act like anchors,
    pinching the sheet and preventing material from flowing smoothly into the die cavity.
    This restricted flow is a primary cause of forming failures:
    - If material cannot flow in, the part will stretch excessively, leading to thinning and tearing.
    - If material is restricted in one area, it may pile up in another, causing wrinkles.

    "Bypass notches" are strategically placed cuts or additions along the blank's contour.
    They serve as a controlled way to "un-lock" the material flow around these restrictive
    geometries. By adding a notch, a tool designer allows material to move more freely,
    ensuring it can get to where it's needed in the die.

    Therefore, the most fundamental scientific reason for bypass notches is to manage
    and facilitate proper material inflow.

    Choice (D) correctly identifies this core principle.
