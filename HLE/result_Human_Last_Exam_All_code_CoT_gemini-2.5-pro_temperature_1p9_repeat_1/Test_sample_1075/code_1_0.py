    # Explanation of the legal reasoning
    explanation = """
    A lawyer would advise Lewis that his understanding of the Sale of Goods Act (SGA) is correct and that he is entitled to a refund. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

    1.  **Applicability of the Sale of Goods Act (SGA):** The contract between Lewis and Marcel is for a painting, which is a tangible, movable item ("good"). Although it requires Marcel's skill ("service") to create, the ultimate object of the contract is the transfer of the finished good. Therefore, this is considered a contract for the sale of goods, and the SGA applies. This eliminates options B and A.

    2.  **Implied Conditions in the SGA:** The SGA automatically includes certain "implied conditions" into contracts for the sale of goods, unless the parties explicitly agree to exclude them. These conditions do not need to be written or spoken to be part of the contract. This eliminates option E, which incorrectly suggests the conditions must be expressly included.

    3.  **Breach of Implied Conditions:** Two key conditions were breached:
        *   **Fitness for a Particular Purpose:** Lewis expressly told Marcel the purpose: a "very detailed and large" painting to serve as a "centrepiece," depicting a specific location ("Algonquin Park or Hudson Bay"). He relied on Marcel's skill as a "highly regarded artist" to fulfill this. The small, hasty painting of a local creek is clearly not fit for this specified purpose.
        *   **Correspondence with Description:** The painting was sold by description. The goods delivered must match that description. The painting delivered did not match the description of being "large," "detailed," or of "Algonquin Park or Hudson Bay."

    4.  **Remedy:** The failure to meet these conditions constitutes a major breach of the contract. This breach of condition gives Lewis the right to reject the goods (the painting) and repudiate the contract, which means he is entitled to have his money returned.

    Conclusion: Option D is the only choice that accurately reflects this legal reality. Marcel failed to deliver a painting that was fit for the stated purpose or that matched its description, breaching fundamental conditions of the sale agreement.
