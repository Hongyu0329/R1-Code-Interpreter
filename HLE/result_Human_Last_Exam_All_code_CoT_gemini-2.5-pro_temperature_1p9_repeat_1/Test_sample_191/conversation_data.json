    "My plan is to identify the key protein from the immune system that is involved in tagging amyloid deposits for clearance by phagocytic cells like macrophages. This process is known as opsonization and is a major function of the complement system. I will identify the central protein in this pathway and then use a Python script to print its name and a brief explanation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_protein():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the protein involved in\n    macrophage engulfment of amyloid through the complement system.\n    \"\"\"\n    protein_name = \"Complement component 3 (C3)\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"When the complement immune system is activated by amyloid deposits, \"\n        \"the protein C3 is broken down into fragments, primarily C3b. \"\n        \"This C3b fragment then coats the amyloid (a process called opsonization), \"\n        \"acting as a tag or an 'eat me' signal.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
