    Analyzes which types of functions are necessarily Lebesgue integrable.

    A function f is Lebesgue integrable over a domain D if:
    1. f is a measurable function on D.
    2. The Lebesgue integral of its absolute value is finite, i.e., ∫|f|dμ < ∞.

    # Option A: A bounded function
    # Verdict: No. It may not be measurable. A function must be measurable to be integrable.
    # A standard counterexample involves a non-measurable set, like a Vitali set.
    answers['A'] = "NO. It might not be measurable."

    # Option B: A bounded measurable function
    # Verdict: No. The domain is not specified. If the domain has infinite measure (like the real line R),
    # the integral of a non-zero bounded function will be infinite. Counterexample: f(x) = 1 on R.
    answers['B'] = "NO. The domain could have infinite measure (e.g., f(x)=1 on R)."

    # Option C: A measurable function
    # Verdict: No. The integral of its absolute value can be infinite. Counterexample: f(x) = x on R.
    answers['C'] = "NO. The integral can be infinite (e.g., f(x)=x on R)."

    # Option D: A continuous function
    # Verdict: No. Continuous functions are measurable, but the same reasoning as C applies.
    # Counterexample: f(x) = x on R.
    answers['D'] = "NO. The integral can be infinite (e.g., f(x)=x on R)."

    # Option E: A measurable function on [a,b]
    # Verdict: No. Even on a finite interval, the function can be unbounded in a way that its integral is infinite.
    # Counterexample: f(x) = 1/x on (0, 1] with f(0)=0. The integral from 0 to 1 diverges.
    answers['E'] = "NO. Can be unbounded with an infinite integral (e.g., f(x)=1/x on [0,1])."

    # Option F: A continuous function on [a,b]
    # Verdict: Yes. A continuous function on a closed, bounded interval [a,b] is bounded.
    # A bounded, measurable function on a set of finite measure ([a,b]) is integrable.
    # Specifically, ∫|f|dx <= M*(b-a) < ∞, where M is the maximum value of |f|.

    # Option H: A function whose absolute value is integrable
    # Verdict: Yes. By definition, a function f is Lebesgue integrable if ∫|f|dμ is finite
    # (this also implies f is measurable in standard measure theory). This is a definitional truth.
    answers['H'] = "YES. This is true by definition."

    # Option I: A function whose absolute value is integrable on [a,b]
    # Verdict: Yes. This is a specific case of H on a defined interval.
    answers['I'] = "YES. A specific case of H."

    # Option J: A continuous function on (a,b)
    # Verdict: No. The function can be unbounded near the interval's endpoints.

    answers['J'] = "NO. Can be unbounded near endpoints (e.g., 1/(x-a) on (a,b))."
    
    # NOTE: The prompt included a duplicate "H. A bounded function on (a,b)". This would be NO,
    # because the function may not be measurable. We will proceed with the unique letters A-M.

    # Option K: A measurable function on (a,b)
    # Verdict: No. Same reason as E. It can be unbounded with an infinite integral.
    # Counterexample: f(x) = 1/(x-a) on (a,b).

    # Verdict: Yes. This is the complete and explicit definition of a Lebesgue integrable function.
