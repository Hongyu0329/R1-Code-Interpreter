    The problem, as written, is to find the largest x for which the sum
    S(x) = sum(1 / ((x + i - 1)! * i!)) for i=0 to infinity, is zero.
    This sum is equivalent to the modified Bessel function I_{x-1}(2).
    However, I_nu(z) is always positive for real nu and z > 0, so there is no real solution.

    It is highly likely that there is a typo in the problem statement.
    A common, related sum is S_corr(x) = sum((-1)^i / ((x+i)! * i!)),
    which is equivalent to the Bessel function of the first kind, J_x(2).
    This function does have real roots for x. We will solve J_x(2) = 0 for the largest x.

    By inspecting the function J_x(2), the roots for x are all negative.
    The largest root is the one closest to 0.
    We can see from a plot or by testing values that this root lies between -1 and 0.
    J_0(2) is positive, and J_{-1}(2) is negative.
