1. The problem describes a physical apparatus mimicking Maxwell's demon, using a one-way door (a Brownian ratchet) to separate two compartments of gas. The goal is to find the parameter required to trap all the gas on one side.

2. Initially, the system has equal amounts of gas in each compartment, implying it starts in a state of thermal equilibrium, with uniform temperature and pressure throughout.

3. According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the entropy of an isolated system cannot decrease. Moving all gas to one side would be a spontaneous decrease in the gas's entropy. This cannot happen without some external influence or energy flow.

4. The key insight, famously analyzed by Richard Feynman, is that if the entire system (gas on both sides and the door itself) is at one single, uniform temperature, the door itself will be subject to random thermal motion (Brownian motion).

5. This thermal jiggling of the door will cause it to occasionally open spontaneously, allowing molecules to pass back in the 'wrong' direction. In a state of complete thermal equilibrium, the rate of molecules passing through the door 'correctly' is exactly balanced by the rate of molecules passing 'incorrectly' due to the door's own thermal motion. Therefore, no net accumulation of gas will occur.

6. To make the ratchet work and actually sort the molecules, one must break this thermal equilibrium. This requires a temperature difference. For example, if the door mechanism was actively cooled to a lower temperature than the gas, its random jiggling would be reduced, allowing it to function as a one-way valve. This process would be driven by the flow of heat from the hot gas to the cold door, thereby satisfying the Second Law of Thermodynamics for the entire system.

7. Therefore, Temperature (specifically, a non-uniform temperature or temperature gradient) is the critical experimental parameter required for the 'demon' to successfully trap gas on one side.
