    "Of course! I can help with that. Here is a Python script to solve the problem, followed by the analysis for the memory-efficient C program.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Read Input**: Read the entire line of input, which represents the sum (e.g., \"3+2+1\").\n2.  **Extract Numbers**: The numbers are separated by the \"+\" symbol. I will split the input string by \"+\" to get a list of the numbers as strings (e.g., `['3', '2', '1']`).\n3.  **Sort Numbers**: Sort this list. Since the numbers are all single digits, a standard string sort works correctly (e.g., `['1', '2', '3']`).\n4.  **Reconstruct Sum**: Join the sorted list of numbers back into a single string, using \"+\" as the separator (e.g., \"1+2+3\").\n5.  **Print Output**: Print the final reconstructed sum string.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a string representing a sum of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4,\n    rearranges the numbers in non-decreasing order, and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the input string, for example \"3+2+1\"\n    s = input()\n\n    # Split the string by the '+' character to get a list of the numbers.\n    # For \"3+2+1\", this results in ['3', '2', '1']\n    numbers = s.split('+')\n\n    # Sort the list of numbers.\n    # For ['3', '2', '1'], this becomes ['1', '2', '3']\n    numbers.sort()\n\n    # Join the sorted list back into a string with '+' as the separator.\n    # For ['1', '2', '3'], this becomes \"1+2+3\"\n    output_sum = \"+\".join(numbers)\n\n    # Print the final result. The output needs to be the full equation.\n    print(output_sum)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\n### Memory-Efficiency Analysis for C Program\n\nFor the second part of your request, here is the analysis for the most memory-efficient C program to solve this task.\n\n**Approach:**\nInstead of reading the entire string into a large buffer, a more memory-efficient method is to read the input character by character using `getchar()`. We can count the occurrences of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) without storing the whole string. This approach is a form of Counting Sort. After counting, we can construct and print the sorted sum directly.\n\n**Variable Memory Calculation:**\nWe will choose the smallest standard C data type that can safely hold the required values for each variable. We assume a standard system where `sizeof(int)=4`, `sizeof(short)=2`, and `sizeof(char)=1`.\n\n1.  **Counts Array (`counts`)**: To store the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The maximum number of terms is about 500 (for a 1000-character string like \"1+1+...+1\"). A `short` (max value 32,767) is sufficient. We can use a 4-element array.\n    *   `short counts[4];` -> `4 * sizeof(short)` = `4 * 2` = **8 bytes**.\n2.  **Input Character (`c`)**: The `getchar()` function returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` value. Thus, this variable must be an `int`.\n    *   `int c;` -> `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n3.  **Printing Flag (`first`)**: A small flag variable is needed to correctly handle the '+' separators (i.e., not printing a '+' before the very first number). A `char` is sufficient for this boolean-like flag.\n    *   `char first = 1;` -> `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n4.  **Outer Loop Counter (`i`)**: This loop iterates four times (for numbers 1, 2, 3, 4). A `char` is sufficient.\n    *   `char i;` -> `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n5.  **Inner Loop Counter (`j`)**: This loop prints a number `counts[i]` times. As `counts[i]` can be up to ~500, a `short` is required.\n    *   `short j;` -> `sizeof(short)` = **2 bytes**.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables.\nm = 8 (counts) + 4 (c) + 1 (first) + 1 (i) + 2 (j) = 16 bytes.\n\n<<<16>>>"
