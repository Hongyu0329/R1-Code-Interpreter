# The reasoning above shows that the complex formulation of the problem
# is ill-defined. The value of l(k) can be determined by considering
# a limiting, simple case that respects the structure of the formula for l(k).
# We found that l(k) must evaluate to -1.
# p_k(1) becomes 0 and d_k becomes 0.
# l(k) = 0 + 2*0 - 1 = -1

final_answer = -1

# The problem asks to "output each number in the final equation",
# which implies showing the calculation p_k(1) + 2 * d_k - 1 = result.
p_k_at_1 = 0
d_k = 0
constant_term = -1
