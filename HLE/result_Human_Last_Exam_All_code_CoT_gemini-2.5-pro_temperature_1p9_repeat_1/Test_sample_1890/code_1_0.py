# Problem Analysis:
# We need to determine the effect of a higher mutation rate (from hypermutator strains)
# on mucoid variants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, specifically regarding the mucA gene.

# Step 1: Analyze the impact on frequency.
# A higher overall mutation rate increases the probability of mutations occurring in any gene.
# Since mucA mutations are the most common cause of the mucoid phenotype, a higher mutation
# rate will lead to more frequent mutations in mucA.
# Conclusion 1: This results in an "Increased frequency" of mucoid variants.

# Step 2: Analyze the impact on the spectrum of mutations.
# Hypermutation is generally a random process, increasing the rate of various types of mutations
# across the genome. This randomness means that a more diverse set of mutations
# (e.g., different substitutions, insertions, deletions at various sites) will be generated
# within the mucA gene, compared to the few that might arise at a normal mutation rate.
# Conclusion 2: This results in a "wider spectrum" of mucA mutations.

# Step 3: Combine conclusions to find the correct answer.
# The correct answer must state both an increased frequency and a wider spectrum.
# Option B: "Increased frequency of mucoid variants with a wider spectrum of mucA mutations"
# This matches our logical deductions.

final_answer = 'B'
