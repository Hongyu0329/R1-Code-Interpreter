def find_nullifiable_propositions():
    """
    Identifies and lists the San Francisco Nov 2024 propositions that
    could be nullified by a competing measure.

    Based on the official voter guide:
    - Propositions J and K are competing measures. If both pass, the one with more
      'yes' votes is enacted, and the other is nullified.
    - Propositions L and M are competing measures. If both pass, the one with more
      'yes' votes is enacted, and the other is nullified.
    
    This function returns a sorted, comma-separated string of these proposition letters.
