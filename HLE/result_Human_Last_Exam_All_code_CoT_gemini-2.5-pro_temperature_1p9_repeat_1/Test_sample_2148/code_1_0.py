# Step 1: Define the values for X1 and X2 based on our derivation.
# X1 = (8 * sqrt(2)) / 3
# X2 = 1 / (24 * sqrt(2) * pi)

# The values used in the equation for X1 * X2 are 8*sqrt(2)/3 and 1/(24*sqrt(2)*pi)
# Let's show the calculation explicitly.
val1_num = 8 * math.sqrt(2)
val1_den = 3
x1 = val1_num / val1_den

val2_num = 1
val2_den = 24 * math.sqrt(2) * math.pi
x2 = val2_num / val2_den

# Step 2: Calculate the product X1 * X2
# (8*sqrt(2)/3) * (1 / (24*sqrt(2)*pi)) = 8 / (3 * 24 * pi) = 8 / (72 * pi) = 1 / (9 * pi)
product = x1 * x2

# Step 3: Calculate the inverse of the product
inverse_product = 1 / product
# This will be 9 * pi

# Let's show the product first
