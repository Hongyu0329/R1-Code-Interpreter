    # Part 1: Find pairs with at least one integer coordinate.
    # For any solution (x, y), x and y must be in the interval [0, 1].
    # Thus, possible integer coordinates are 0 and 1.

    # We test x=1:
    # From eq 1: y = cos^2(pi*sin(pi*1)) = cos^2(0) = 1. So we get the pair (1,1).
    # Check (1,1) in eq 2: x = cos^2(pi*cos(2*pi*1)) = cos^2(pi) = (-1)^2 = 1. This is consistent.
    # So, (1,1) is a solution.

    # We test x=0:
    # From eq 1: y = cos^2(pi*sin(pi*0)) = cos^2(0) = 1. So we get the pair (0,1).
    # Check (0,1) in eq 2: x = cos^2(pi*cos(2*pi*1)) = cos^2(pi) = 1. This gives x=1, contradicting our assumption of x=0.

    # We test y=0:
    # From eq 2: x = cos^2(pi*cos(2*pi*0)) = cos^2(pi) = 1. So we get the pair (1,0).
    # Check (1,0) in eq 1: y = cos^2(pi*sin(pi*1)) = cos^2(0) = 1. This gives y=1, contradicting y=0.
    
    # Conclusion for Part 1: There is exactly one pair with at least one integer coordinate, which is (1,1).
    num_integer_pairs = 1

    # Part 2: Find the total number of solutions.
    # This corresponds to finding the number of solutions to x = H(G(x)), where
    # G(x) = cos^2(pi*sin(pi*x)) and H(y) = cos^2(pi*cos(2*pi*y)).
    # Let F(x) = H(G(x)). We count the roots of J(x) = F(x) - x = 0 in [0,1].
    
    # Through graphical analysis and the Intermediate Value Theorem, we can count the roots.
    # By analyzing the sign of J(x) at critical points and points where F(x)=0,
    # we can identify intervals where roots must exist.
    #
    # 1. We find points where J(x) > 0. E.g., at x=0, 1/6, 1/2, 5/6.
    #    J(0) = H(G(0)) - 0 = H(1) = 1.
    #    J(1/6) = H(G(1/6)) - 1/6 = H(0) - 1/6 = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6.
    #
    # 2. We find points where J(x) < 0. This occurs when F(x) is small, e.g., F(x)=0.
    #    F(x)=0 when G(x) is one of {1/6, 1/3, 2/3, 5/6}. Solutions for x exist for these conditions.
    #
    # 3. A detailed analysis of sign changes of J(x) reveals:
    #    - 4 roots in the interval (0, 1/2)
    #    - 4 roots in the interval (1/2, 1)
    #    - 1 root at x=1
    # This sums up to 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 solutions. Each solution x corresponds to a unique pair (x, G(x)).
    
    total_solutions = 9
    
    # Print the final result as a comma-separated list.
