    "This problem describes a two-step organic synthesis reaction. Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the final product:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Reagents:** The starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. The first step involves `sec-BuLi` and `TMEDA`, which are reagents for a **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction. This is a powerful technique to deprotonate a specific C-H bond on an aromatic ring. The second step uses `methyl iodide` (`CH3I`), an electrophile used to add a methyl group.\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Metalation (Lithiation):**\n    *   The starting molecule has two functional groups that can direct the deprotonation by `sec-BuLi`: the N,N-diethylamide (`-CONEt2`) group at position C1 and the dimethylamino (`-NMe2`) group at position C3.\n    *   In Directed ortho-Metalation, the functional group's ability to coordinate with the lithium ion determines where the deprotonation occurs. The hierarchy of directing ability is well-established, and the amide group (`-CONR2`) is a significantly stronger directing group than an amino group (`-NR2`).\n    *   Therefore, the lithiation will happen at a position *ortho* to the stronger directing group, the N,N-diethylamide. The positions ortho to C1 are C2 and C6.\n    *   Between C2 and C6, the C2 position is the most acidic and reactive site. This is because it is not only *ortho* to the primary director (the amide at C1) but also *ortho* to the secondary director (the amino group at C3). This synergistic effect makes the proton at C2 the one that is selectively removed.\n    *   The intermediate formed is N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n3.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   The highly nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate generated in the first step reacts with the electrophile, methyl iodide.\n    *   The lithium atom at C2 is replaced by a methyl group (`-CH3`).\n    *   The final product is therefore **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThe following Python code uses the RDKit library to represent the final product and print its name and molecular formula.\n\n```python\n# RDKit is a cheminformatics toolkit. If you don't have it, you can install it:\n# pip install rdkit\n\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Descriptors, AllChem\n\ndef get_product_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the product of the described reaction\n    and prints its information.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Reasoning (as explained above)\n    # The reaction is a directed ortho-metalation at C2, followed by methylation.\n    # Starting Material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n    # SMILES: CCN(CC)C(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(C)C\n    # Product: N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n\n    # Step 2: Define the product using its SMILES string\n    product_smiles = \"CCN(CC)C(=O)c1c(C)c(N(C)C)ccc1\"\n    \n    # Create a molecule object from the SMILES string\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(product_smiles)\n\n    if mol is None:\n        print(\"Error: Could not generate molecule from SMILES string.\")\n        return\n\n    # To get a reasonable IUPAC-like name, we can try to generate it,\n    # but for complex molecules, manual naming is more reliable.\n    # The systematic name is derived from the chemical reasoning above.\n    product_name = \"N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n\n    # Calculate molecular formula, including all numbers for atoms\n    molecular_formula = Descriptors.rdMolDescriptors.CalcMolFormula(mol)\n    \n    print(\"Final Product Information:\")\n    print(f\"IUPAC Name: {product_name}\")\n    print(f\"SMILES String: {product_smiles}\")\n    print(f\"Molecular Formula: {molecular_formula}\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer\nget_product_info()\n\n```\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
