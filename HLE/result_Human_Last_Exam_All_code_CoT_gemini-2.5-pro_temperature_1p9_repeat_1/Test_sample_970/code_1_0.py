def solve_bayesian_assumptions():
    """
    Determines the necessary assumptions for the expected information gain of a Bayesian agent
    to converge to zero and formats the answer in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).

    The necessary assumptions are:
    a. The prior has finite entropy.
    b. The environment (e.g., MDP) has regularity properties ensuring model identifiability.
    c. The agent's data-gathering process stabilizes (e.g., limiting state occupancy distribution exists).

    These correspond to choices a, b, and c.

    In CNF, "a AND b AND c" is represented as a conjunction of clauses, where each
    clause contains one literal. The clauses and literals are ordered alphabetically.
