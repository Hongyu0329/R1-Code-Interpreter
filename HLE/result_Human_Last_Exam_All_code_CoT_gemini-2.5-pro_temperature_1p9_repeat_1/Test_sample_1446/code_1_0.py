def solve_critical_exponent_nu():
    """
    Determines the critical exponent ν for a G₄-theory in the mean-field approximation.

    The problem describes a G₄-theoretical framework, which is the standard φ⁴ theory
    of critical phenomena. The critical exponent ν governs the divergence of the
    correlation length (ξ) near the critical temperature (T_c).

    The scaling law is defined as:
    ξ ∝ |T - T_c|⁻ν

    The value of ν depends on the spatial dimensionality 'd'. Since 'd' is not
    specified, we use the mean-field approximation, which is exact for dimensions
    d > 4 (the upper critical dimension for this theory).

    In mean-field theory, we find that:
    ξ² ∝ |T - T_c|⁻¹

    By taking the square root, we get:
    ξ ∝ |T - T_c|⁻¹/²

    Comparing this result to the defining scaling law allows us to identify ν.
