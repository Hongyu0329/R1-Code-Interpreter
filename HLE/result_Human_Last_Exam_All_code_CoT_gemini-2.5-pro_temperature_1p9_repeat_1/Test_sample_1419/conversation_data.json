    "To determine the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, we follow the principles of the renormalization group.\n\n**Our Plan:**\n\n1.  **Start with the Beta Function:** The first step is to write down the one-loop beta function, `β(u)`, for the coupling constant `u` in ϕ⁴ theory. This function describes how the coupling changes with the energy scale. We will work in `d = 4 - ε` dimensions, where `ε` is a small parameter.\n2.  **Find the Fixed Point:** A fixed point, denoted as `u*`, represents a scale-invariant point where the coupling constant ceases to evolve. Mathematically, this corresponds to the point where the beta function is zero, i.e., `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **Solve for u*:** We will solve the equation `β(u*) = 0` for `u*`. This equation will yield two solutions: a trivial one (`u* = 0`, the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial one (`u* > 0`, the Wilson-Fisher fixed point). We are interested in the non-trivial solution.\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will programmatically display the derived expression for `u*`, explicitly showing all the numerical components and symbols involved as requested.\n\n**Derivation:**\n\nThe one-loop beta function for ϕ⁴ theory in the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme is:\n`β(u) = -εu + (3 * u²) / (16 * π²)`\n\nTo find the fixed point `u*`, we set `β(u*) = 0`:\n`-εu* + (3 * (u*)²) / (16 * π²) = 0`\n\nWe are looking for the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point, so we assume `u* ≠ 0` and divide the equation by `u*`:\n`-ε + (3 * u*) / (16 * π²) = 0`\n\nSolving for `u*` gives the leading order expression:\n`u* = (16 * π² / 3) * ε`\n\nThe following Python script will print this final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_fixed_point_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and prints the leading order expression for the\n    fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # In d = 4 - ε dimensions, the one-loop beta function is:\n    # β(u) = -εu + (3u²) / (16π²)\n    \n    # A fixed point u* is found by solving β(u*) = 0.\n    # We are interested in the non-trivial (Wilson-Fisher) fixed point.\n    # -εu* + (3(u*)²) / (16π²) = 0\n    #  => u* = (16π²ε) / 3\n    \n    # Constants in the expression\n    numerator = 16\n    denominator = 3\n    pi_symbol = \"π\"\n    epsilon_symbol = \"ε\"\n    \n    print(\"The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* is derived from the beta function β(u).\")\n    print(\"The one-loop beta function in d = 4 - ε dimensions is: β(u) = -εu + (3u²)/(16π²)\")\n    print(\"\\nThe non-trivial fixed point u* (Wilson-Fisher fixed point) is found by solving β(u*) = 0:\")\n    \n    # Output the final equation, showing each number.\n    print(f\"u* = ({numerator} * {pi_symbol}² / {denominator}) * {epsilon_symbol}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_fixed_point_expression()\n```\n<<<u* = (16 * π² / 3) * ε>>>"
