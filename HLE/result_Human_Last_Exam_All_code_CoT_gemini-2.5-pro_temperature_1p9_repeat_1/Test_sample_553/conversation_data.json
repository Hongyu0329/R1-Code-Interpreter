    "The question asks for a song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord. This is a very specific musical question.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the music theory:**\n    *   The \"tonic\" is the home chord of a song's key. We'll call it chord 'i' if the key is minor or 'I' if the key is major.\n    *   The \"fifth chord\" is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In a minor key, this is often a minor chord (a 'v' chord). In a major key, this would be a borrowed chord.\n    *   The progression is i -> v (in a minor key).\n\n2.  **Identify the song:** I need to find a Beatles song where one of the first chord changes follows this pattern. After reviewing their catalog, the song \"Michelle\" is the strongest candidate.\n\n3.  **Explain the reasoning:**\n    *   \"Michelle\" is primarily in the key of F minor for the verses.\n    *   The tonic chord (i) is therefore F minor (Fm).\n    *   The minor fifth chord (v) in this key is C minor (Cm).\n    *   While not the absolute first chord change, very early in the first verse, on the French lyric *\"Sont les mots qui vont très bien ensemble\"*, the chords change directly from F minor to C minor.\n    *   This \"i -> v\" jump is a perfect match for the \"tonic to the minor fifth chord\" description.\n\n4.  **Generate the code:** I will write a Python script that explains these steps and prints the name of the song as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_beatles_song_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains which Beatles song fits the\n    description of starting with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Explanation of the music theory concepts\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    The user is asking for a Beatles song with a specific opening chord progression: from the tonic chord to the minor fifth chord.\n\n    1.  Tonic Chord: This is the 'home' chord of the song's key. For a song in a minor key, this is the 'i' chord.\n    2.  Minor Fifth Chord: This is a minor chord built on the fifth note of the key's scale. In a minor key, this is the 'v' chord.\n    3.  The Progression: The request describes the chord change i -> v.\n\n    The song that most clearly features this progression near its start is \"Michelle\".\n    - The verses of \"Michelle\" are in the key of F minor.\n    - The tonic chord (i) is F minor (Fm).\n    - The minor fifth chord (v) is C minor (Cm).\n\n    In the first verse, during the French lyric \"Sont les mots qui vont très bien ensemble\", the chord progression is a direct jump from Fm to Cm.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the musical query...\")\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation))\n    print(\"This jump from F minor to C minor perfectly matches the 'tonic to the minor fifth chord' description.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The song is: {song_title}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n\nsolve_beatles_song_query()\n\n# Final Answer\nprint(\"<<<Michelle>>>\")\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
