    The user is asking for a Beatles song with a specific opening chord progression: from the tonic chord to the minor fifth chord.

    1.  Tonic Chord: This is the 'home' chord of the song's key. For a song in a minor key, this is the 'i' chord.
    2.  Minor Fifth Chord: This is a minor chord built on the fifth note of the key's scale. In a minor key, this is the 'v' chord.
    3.  The Progression: The request describes the chord change i -> v.

    The song that most clearly features this progression near its start is "Michelle".
    - The verses of "Michelle" are in the key of F minor.
    - The tonic chord (i) is F minor (Fm).
    - The minor fifth chord (v) is C minor (Cm).

    In the first verse, during the French lyric "Sont les mots qui vont tr√®s bien ensemble", the chord progression is a direct jump from Fm to Cm.
