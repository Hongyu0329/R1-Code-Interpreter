    print("Reasoning:")
    print("The Pohozaev identity, P(u, v) = 0, is a property that any solution (i.e., a critical point of J) must satisfy. It is a necessary condition derived from the Euler-Lagrange equations associated with J.")
    print("However, the converse is not true. P(u, v) = 0 represents a single scalar constraint, while being a critical point (J'(u,v) = 0) represents a system of equations. A function can lie on the Pohozaev manifold (where P=0) without satisfying the full system of equations.")
    answer_a = "False"

    # --- Part (b) Analysis ---
    print("\n(b) Is it true that for any (u, v) in H^{1,s}(R^2), there exists a unique t > 0 such that (u_t, v_t) belongs to the set where P=0?")
    print("Reasoning:")
    print("This question asks if we can always project a function onto the Pohozaev manifold via some scaling u -> u_t.")
    print("Let's assume a scaling where the kinetic term K(u,v) scales as t^A and the nonlinear term N(u,v) scales as t^B. The condition P(u_t, v_t) = 0 becomes: s * t^A * K(u,v) - t^B * N(u,v) = 0.")
    print("This leads to an equation for t, typically of the form t^(B-A) = (s * K(u,v)) / N(u,v).")
    print("For a unique positive solution for t to exist, the right-hand side must be positive. Since K(u,v) involves squared norms, it is non-negative. However, the 'nonlinear terms' are unspecified. It is possible to choose a function (u,v) for which N(u,v) is zero or negative. In such a case, no positive t would exist.")
    print("Since the statement must hold for *any* (u,v), the answer is no.")
    answer_b = "No"
    print(f"Conclusion: The answer is {answer_b}.")

    # --- Part (c) Analysis ---
    print("\n(c) Must the minimiser of J on the manifold P=0 satisfy the condition phi''(u,v)(1) < 0?")
    print("Reasoning:")
    print("Here, phi(t) = J(u_t, v_t), and we are considering a minimizer (u,v) of J on the manifold defined by P=0. By definition, for a solution on this manifold, P(u,v) = 0, which corresponds to phi'(1) = 0.")
    print("The method of minimizing J on the P=0 manifold is a variational technique to find ground states. These ground states are often saddle points of the energy J. They are minimal with respect to variations that preserve the constraint P=0, but are maximal with respect to the scaling that defines P.")
    print("This means that for the solution (u,v), the function phi(t) must have a local maximum at t=1. A necessary condition for a non-degenerate maximum is phi''(1) < 0.")
