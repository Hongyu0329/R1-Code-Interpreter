    "To find the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols, I will write a Python script to systematically generate and test all possibilities.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Generate All Possibilities:** I'll create every possible 5-symbol string using the allowed symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}. Since repetition is allowed, there are 7^5 = 16,807 possible strings to check.\n2.  **Filter and Evaluate:** For each generated string, I'll attempt to evaluate it as a boolean expression.\n    *   First, the string will be translated into a Python-compatible format (e.g., 'T' becomes 'True', '&' becomes 'and').\n    *   Then, I'll use Python's `eval()` function inside a `try-except` block. This block will safely handle syntactically invalid expressions (like \"T(&F)\" or \"FF!T|\") by catching errors.\n3.  **Count True Expressions:** If a string represents a valid expression and evaluates to `True`, I will add it to a list of solutions.\n4.  **Display Results:** Finally, the script will print each of the valid true expressions it found, followed by the total count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_true_boolean_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates all possible 5-symbol boolean expressions from a given\n    set of symbols, evaluates them, and prints those that result in True.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The set of allowed symbols\n    symbols = ['T', 'F', '!', '&', '|', '(', ')']\n    \n    true_expressions = []\n    \n    # 1. Generate all possible combinations of 5 symbols\n    total_combinations = itertools.product(symbols, repeat=5)\n    \n    for combo in total_combinations:\n        # A quick check for unbalanced parentheses, which are always invalid\n        if combo.count('(') != combo.count(')'):\n            continue\n\n        original_expr = \"\".join(combo)\n        \n        # 2. Translate the expression into a Python-evaluable string.\n        # Spacing around operators is crucial for Python's parser.\n        py_expr = original_expr.replace('!', 'not ') \\\n                               .replace('&', ' and ') \\\n                               .replace('|', ' or ') \\\n                               .replace('T', 'True') \\\n                               .replace('F', 'False')\n        \n        # 3. Use a try-except block to safely evaluate the string\n        try:\n            # The 'eval' function will parse and compute the result.\n            # It will raise an error for malformed expressions (e.g., \"T&&F\").\n            # We explicitly check for `is True` to ensure the result is a boolean True.\n            if eval(py_expr) is True:\n                true_expressions.append(original_expr)\n        except Exception:\n            # This catches SyntaxError, TypeError, etc. for invalid expressions.\n            # We simply ignore them and move to the next combination.\n            pass\n\n    # 4. Print all the valid true expressions found, sorted for consistency.\n    print(\"Found the following true boolean expressions of length 5:\")\n    for expr in sorted(true_expressions):\n        print(expr)\n        \n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of true expressions: {len(true_expressions)}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_true_boolean_expressions()\n```\n<<<64>>>"
