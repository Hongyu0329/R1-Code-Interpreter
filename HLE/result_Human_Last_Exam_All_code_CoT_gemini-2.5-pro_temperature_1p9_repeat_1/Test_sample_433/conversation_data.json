    "I will provide the answer based on the guidelines from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797> for sterile compounding.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the key terms in the user's request: \"single dose container ampule,\" \"time of puncture,\" and \"sterile environment.\"\n2.  Reference the specific USP <797> guideline that defines the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for this scenario.\n3.  The sterile environment is assumed to be an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment.\n4.  Create a Python script that states this guideline and prints the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters based on the question\ncontainer_type = \"single dose container ampule\"\nenvironment_condition = \"sterile environment (ISO Class 5 or better)\"\ntime_period_unit = \"hours\"\n\n# According to USP General Chapter <797>, once a single-dose container\n# is punctured or opened within an ISO Class 5 or better environment,\n# it must be used within the following timeframe.\nbud_in_hours = 12\n\n# Print the explanation and the final answer\nprint(f\"The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a {container_type} from the time of puncture in a {environment_condition} is {bud_in_hours} {time_period_unit}.\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
