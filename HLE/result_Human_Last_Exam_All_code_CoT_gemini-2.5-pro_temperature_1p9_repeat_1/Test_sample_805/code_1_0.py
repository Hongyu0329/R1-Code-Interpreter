    explanation = """
1.  In their default state, Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) are pluripotent. To maintain this state, they actively repress or keep genes for specific cell types (like heart cells) at very low expression levels. So, the expression of the heart-specific regulator 'Braveheart' is kept low or is actively repressed ('decreased') in ESCs.

2.  When an ESC receives the signal to become a heart cell, it begins the process of differentiation. This requires turning on a specific set of genes. 'Braveheart' is a key regulator that helps activate this cardiac program.

3.  Therefore, as the cell differentiates into a heart cell, the expression of 'Braveheart' must increase from its previously low level to drive the cell towards its new fate.

4.  This matches the description where expression is low/repressed in the embryonic stem cell state and increases during the differentiation process.
