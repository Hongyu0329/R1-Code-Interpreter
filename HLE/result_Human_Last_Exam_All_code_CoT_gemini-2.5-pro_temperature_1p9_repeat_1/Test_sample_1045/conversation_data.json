    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set:** This notation tells us how many functions are used for each atom.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** It has no core electrons. The valence '31G' means the 1s orbital is represented by two contracted basis functions (one is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, the other is a single primitive Gaussian). So, each H atom has **2** basis functions.\n    *   **For Carbon (C):** It's a second-row element.\n        *   The '6' describes the core 1s orbital, which is represented by a single contracted function.\n        *   The '31G' describes the valence orbitals (2s and 2p). They are split into two sets of functions. The first set (inner) consists of one S function and one P function (px, py, pz) for a total of 4 functions. The second set (outer) also has one S and one P function, adding another 4 functions.\n        *   Total for each C atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9** basis functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Sum the functions for all atoms in the molecule.\n    *   Total = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\n    *   Total = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2) = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_C_atoms = 7\nnum_H_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom type in the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon: 1 (core 1s) + 4 (inner valence 2s, 2p) + 4 (outer valence 2s, 2p) = 9\nfuncs_per_C = 9\n# For Hydrogen: 1 (inner valence 1s) + 1 (outer valence 1s) = 2\nfuncs_per_H = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions contributed by each element\ntotal_funcs_C = num_C_atoms * funcs_per_C\ntotal_funcs_H = num_H_atoms * funcs_per_H\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions for the molecule\ntotal_funcs = total_funcs_C + total_funcs_H\n\n# Print the final calculation and result\nprint(f\"To calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Total = (Number of C atoms * Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms * Functions per H)\")\nprint(f\"Total = ({num_C_atoms} * {funcs_per_C}) + ({num_H_atoms} * {funcs_per_H})\")\nprint(f\"Total = {total_funcs_C} + {total_funcs_H}\")\nprint(f\"Total = {total_funcs}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
