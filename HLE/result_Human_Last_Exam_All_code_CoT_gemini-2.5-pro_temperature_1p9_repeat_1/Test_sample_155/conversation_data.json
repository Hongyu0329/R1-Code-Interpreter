    "Here is my plan to solve this puzzle:\n1.  First, I'll analyze the input structure. The encoded message seems to be a form of ASCII art, where different lines of the `verbatim` block represent different parts of large letters (top, middle, bottom bars, and vertical stems).\n2.  The word appears to consist of three letters. I'll create a 7-row canvas to reconstruct these letters. The `t` characters represent \"ink\" (`#`) and the `b` characters represent blank space (` `).\n3.  I'll write a Python script to \"render\" the letters onto this canvas based on the following mapping, where `L1` is the first line of the input, `L2` is the second, and so on:\n    *   **Row 0 (Top)**: Formed by the characters in `L1`.\n    *   **Row 3 (Middle)**: Formed by the characters in `L7`.\n    *   **Row 6 (Bottom)**: Formed by the characters in `L13`.\n    *   **Left Vertical Stems (Column 0)**: Formed by `L2` through `L6` which map to canvas rows 1 through 5.\n    *   **Right Vertical Stems (Column 18)**: Formed by `L8` through `L12` which also map to canvas rows 1 through 5.\n    *   When a horizontal bar (like the middle bar on `L7`) and a stem character occupy the same position, the `t` (ink) will take precedence.\n4.  After rendering the image, the script will recognize the word. Based on the shapes, the word appears to be \"FOR\".\n5.  Finally, as requested by the prompt to \"output each number in the final equation\", I will convert each letter of the word to its corresponding position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, ...).\n6.  The script will then print an equation by summing these numbers and display the result. This satisfies all parts of the request: using Python, deriving the word, and presenting an equation with numbers.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by reconstructing the word from the encoded layout\n    and then creating an equation from the decoded word.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
