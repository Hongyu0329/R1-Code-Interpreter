# Step 1: Define the given constants.
# n is the number of subsystems.
n = 2025
# A_j and B_j are parameters in the system. They are constant for all j.
A = 10**15
B = 10**20

# Step 2: Formulate the result based on the analytical derivation.
# The solvability condition for the nonlinear boundary value problem leads to
# a condition on the initial values (x_i^0, y_i^0):
# (x_i^0 / A_i)^2 + (y_i^0 / B_i)^2 = (1 - exp(-T)) / (n - 1)
# This describes an ellipse for each i.

# The area of the i-th ellipse is Area_i = pi * a_i * b_i, where
# a_i = A_i * sqrt((1 - exp(-T)) / (n - 1))
# b_i = B_i * sqrt((1 - exp(-T)) / (n - 1))
# So, Area_i = pi * A_i * B_i * (1 - exp(-T)) / (n - 1)

# S is the sum of these areas from i = 1 to n. Since A_i and B_i are constant,
# S = n * pi * A * B * (1 - exp(-T)) / (n - 1)

# Step 3: Handle the parameter T.
# The problem asks for a specific numerical value, which suggests that the T dependency
# should be resolved. We assume a large time interval T, where T -> infinity.
# In this limit, exp(-T) -> 0.
# So, (1 - exp(-T)) -> 1.
# The expression for S simplifies to:
# S = n * pi * A * B / (n - 1)

# Step 4: Calculate the required value S / (2025 * pi).
# Since n = 2025, this is S / (n * pi).
# Value = (n * pi * A * B / (n - 1)) / (n * pi)
# Value = A * B / (n - 1)

# Step 5: Perform the calculation and print the results.
