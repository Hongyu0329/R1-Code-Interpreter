# Based on the analysis, the supremum of alpha is found by the formula (1 + 4*c)/2.
# To provide a single numerical answer valid for any c > 0, we must find the
# infimum of this expression for c > 0.
# The infimum occurs as c approaches 0 from the right.
# So, sup(alpha) = lim_{c->0+} (1 + 4*c) / 2 = 1/2.
# The final equation to calculate the supremum is thus:

numerator = 1
denominator = 2
result = numerator / denominator

print("The supremum is given by the final equation:")
print(f"{numerator} / {denominator} = {result}")
