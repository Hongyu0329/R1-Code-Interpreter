def solve_limit_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the specified limit based on logical deduction.
    
    Let f(k) be the minimum number of states for a Turing Machine to recognize
    the language L_k = {w in {0,1}* : |w|_1 = 0 (mod k)}.
    We want to compute L = lim_{k -> inf} [f(k+1) - f(k)].

    1. The problem states that the limit L exists and is an integer.
    2. Since f(k) is an integer for all k, the difference f(k+1) - f(k) is a sequence
       of integers. For a sequence of integers to converge to a limit, it must
       eventually become constant.
    3. This means there exists an N such that for all k > N, f(k+1) - f(k) = L.
       This implies that f(k) must be an asymptotically linear function of k,
       i.e., f(k) ≈ L*k + C for some constant C.
    4. We can recognize the language L_k with a k-state Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA),
       which is a restricted form of a Turing Machine. Thus, the minimum number of
       states f(k) must be less than or equal to k. So, f(k) <= k.
    5. Combining these facts: L*k + C <= k for all large k. This inequality can only
       hold if the coefficient L <= 1.
    6. Also, the complexity f(k) must grow as k grows. This means L cannot be 0. Since
       L is an integer, we must have L >= 1.
    7. The only integer L that satisfies both L >= 1 and L <= 1 is L = 1.
