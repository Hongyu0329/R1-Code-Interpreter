    "To solve this problem, we need to find the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which represents the number of permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nFor a fixed small number of inversions (k=3), the number of permutations of length n avoiding a specific pattern (like 1324) becomes constant for all n greater than a certain small value. This is because permutations with few inversions are \"close\" to the identity permutation, meaning most elements are in or near their sorted positions. For a 1324-pattern to exist, it requires four elements at indices \\(i<j<k<l\\) such that \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k < \\pi_j < \\pi_l\\). In a permutation of great length (like 333) with only 3 inversions, the handful of elements that are out of place must be located very close to each other (or at the absolute ends of the permutation). If they were far apart, the numerous correctly-sorted elements between them would make it easy to form a 1324 pattern.\n\nConsequently, for large n, all such avoiding permutations must have their \"action\" (the elements not in their sorted place) confined to a small prefix or a small suffix of the permutation. This makes the count independent of n, once n is large enough for this effect to take hold (e.g., n > 6 for k=3).\n\nSo, the problem simplifies to finding the value of \\(av_n^3(1324)\\) for a sufficiently large n, such as n=6 or n=7. We can write a Python script to find this value by generating all permutations, counting their inversions, and checking for the 1324 pattern. By computing this for n=6 and observing that the value for n=7 is the same, we can be confident this is the stable value.\n\nThe following Python code calculates \\(av_6^3(1324)\\) to determine the answer for n=333.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_av_nk(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates av_n^k(1324) by enumerating and checking all permutations of length n.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The length of the permutation.\n        k (int): The number of inversions.\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: The number of n-permutations with k inversions avoiding 1324.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Initialize a counter for the permutations that satisfy the conditions\n    avoiding_perms_count = 0\n    \n    # Generate all permutations of the numbers {0, 1, ..., n-1}\n    # Using {0...n-1} instead of {1...n} has no effect on the combinatorial result\n    # but simplifies indexing.\n    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(n)):\n        \n        # 1.
