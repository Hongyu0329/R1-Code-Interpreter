# Step 1: Calculate the total number of distinct instruction types.
stop_commands = 1
turn_commands = 2 + 2  # 2 for left, 2 for right
forward_commands = 4
backward_commands = 2
total_instruction_types = stop_commands + turn_commands + forward_commands + backward_commands

# Step 2: Calculate the minimum bits needed to store one instruction.
# This is the ceiling of log base 2 of the number of instruction types.
# 2^3 = 8 (not enough), 2^4 = 16 (enough). So, 4 bits are needed.
bits_per_instruction = math.ceil(math.log2(total_instruction_types))

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of instructions for one Martian day.
# A Martian day (sol) is ~24.6597 Earth hours long.
# Instructions are sent each Earth minute.
# Total minutes = 24.6597 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1479.582 minutes.
# We must be able to store an instruction for each minute, so we round up.
total_instructions_per_day = math.ceil(24.6597 * 60)

# Step 4: Calculate the total required memory in bytes.
# Total bits = total_instructions_per_day * bits_per_instruction
# Total bytes = total_bits / 8
total_memory_in_bytes = (total_instructions_per_day * bits_per_instruction) / 8

# Print the breakdown of the calculation
print(f"1. Total unique instructions: {stop_commands} (Stop) + {turn_commands} (Turn) + {forward_commands} (Forward) + {backward_commands} (Backward) = {total_instruction_types} types")

print("-" * 30)
print("Final Calculation:")
print(f"({total_instructions_per_day} instructions * {bits_per_instruction} bits/instruction) / 8 bits/byte")
print(f"The final calculation is ({total_instructions_per_day} * {bits_per_instruction}) / 8 = {int(total_memory_in_bytes)}")
