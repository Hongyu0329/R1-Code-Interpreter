    print("\nStep 4: The Spiral Effect")
    print("As light travels down the tube, the polarization plane for each color rotates continuously.")
    print("This means the position on the tube's circumference that appears brightest for a certain color traces a helical path.")
    print("Because each color rotates at a different rate, they create a set of nested helices with different pitches.")
    print("The combined effect is a beautiful rainbow that appears to spiral down the tube.")

    print("Conclusion: The appearance will be a tube with a rainbow gradient progressing in a spiral.")
