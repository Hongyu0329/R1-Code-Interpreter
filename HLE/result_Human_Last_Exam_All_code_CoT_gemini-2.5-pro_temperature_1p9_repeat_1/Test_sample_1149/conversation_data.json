    "Based on paleontological analysis of the holotype skull of *Irritator challengeri* (specimen SMNS 58022), the answer can be determined. My plan is to retrieve this specific anatomical fact from scientific literature describing the dinosaur's cranial morphology. The key feature to examine is the lacrimal bone and the recess located on its surface. According to studies, this lacrimal recess contains a specific number of small openings (foramina), which are a type of depression.\n\nI will write a Python script that stores this number in a variable and then prints the answer in a clear, descriptive sentence that forms a simple equation.\n\n```python\n# The number of depressions (foramina) in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri\n# is based on descriptions from paleontological studies.\nnum_depressions = 2\n\n# Print the result as a simple equation.\nprint(f\"The number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri = {num_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
