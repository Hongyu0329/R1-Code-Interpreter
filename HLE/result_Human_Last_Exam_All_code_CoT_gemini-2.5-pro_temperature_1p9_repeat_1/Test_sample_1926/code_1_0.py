    Solves the theoretical problem based on an interpretation using the Chebotarev Density Theorem.
    
    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Acknowledge the ambiguity in the problem's phrasing, specifically "irreducible degree d points".
    2.  Hypothesize that this phrase is a misstatement for "completely split fibers", as this interpretation aligns with the structure of the provided answer choices (specifically the presence of 1/|G|).
    3.  A "completely split fiber" of the map C -> P^1 is a fiber that consists of d distinct points rational over the base field k.
    4.  Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem for function fields. This theorem relates the density of rational points on the base space (P^1) with specific splitting behaviors in the fibers to the structure of the Galois group G.
    5.  The condition of a fiber being "completely split" corresponds to its specialized Galois group (or Frobenius) being the trivial element in G.
    6.  The density of points with this property is the size of the conjugacy class of the trivial element (which is 1) divided by the size of the whole group G.
    7.  Therefore, the ratio approaches 1/|G|. The other information given (like the rank R) is considered extraneous to this specific question.
