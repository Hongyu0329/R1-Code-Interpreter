    "Of course. I can help with that.\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, we are often interested in the system's response in the energy-frequency domain. The bare Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single particle in a non-interacting system.\n\nThe functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is an inverse relationship. Specifically, the Green's function has a pole when the probe energy, let's call it $E$, is equal to the energy of the particle's state, $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe standard form for the (retarded) bare Green's function in the energy domain is given by the formula:\n\n$G_0(k, E) = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n\nWhere:\n*   $G_0(k, E)$ is the bare Green's function for a particle with quantum number $k$ (e.g., momentum) at energy $E$.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the energy eigenvalue of that single-particle state.\n*   $E$ is the energy at which we are probing the system.\n*   $i\\delta$ is a crucial term with an infinitesimally small positive $\\delta$. This term ensures causality by moving the pole slightly into the lower half of the complex energy plane.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that calculates the value of the bare Green's function for a given set of parameters, demonstrating this relationship. The script will first print the equation with the specific values used, and then it will print the calculated result.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(energy_probe, energy_eigenvalue, delta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0 in the energy domain.\n\n    The formula is G_0 = 1 / (E - epsilon_k + i*delta)\n\n    Args:\n        energy_probe (float): The energy 'E' at which the system is probed.\n        energy_eigenvalue (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue 'epsilon_k'.\n        delta (float): A small positive infinitesimal.\n\n    Returns:\n        complex: The value of the bare Green's function G_0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In Python, the imaginary unit 'i' is represented as '1j'\n    denominator = (energy_probe - energy_eigenvalue) + 1j * delta\n    g0 = 1 / denominator\n    return g0\n\n# --- Parameters for the calculation ---\n# Let's assume the particle has a single-particle energy eigenvalue of 2.0 eV.\nepsilon_k = 2.0\n\n# Let's probe the system at an energy of 2.1 eV, slightly off resonance.\nE = 2.1\n\n# We use a small positive value for delta.\ndelta = 0.05\n\n# --- Perform the calculation ---\ng0_result = calculate_bare_greens_function(E, epsilon_k, delta)\n\n# --- Print the results ---\nprint(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy eigenvalue epsilon_k is:\")\nprint(\"G_0(E) = 1 / (E - epsilon_k + i*delta)\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Calculating for the given values:\")\nprint(f\"E = {E}\")\nprint(f\"epsilon_k = {epsilon_k}\")\nprint(f\"delta = {delta}\\n\")\n\n# Display the final equation with numbers substituted\n# The '.2f' formats the numbers to two decimal places for clarity.\nprint(\"Final Equation:\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({E:.2f} - {epsilon_k:.2f} + i*{delta:.2f})\")\nprint(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({(E - epsilon_k):.2f} + {delta:.2f}i)\")\n\n\n# Print the final numerical answer\n# We print the real and imaginary parts for clarity.\nprint(f\"\\nResult: G_0 = {g0_result:.4f}\")\n\n```\n<<<$G_0(k, E) = \\frac{1}{E - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$>>>"
