    Solves the three Yes/No questions based on principles of geometric group theory and formal languages.

    Thinking Process:
    1.  For (a), we rely on the known theorem that the conjugacy closure of a rational (regular) subset in a free group is context-free. This makes the answer 'Yes'.
    2.  For (b), the definition of a 'context-free subset' S of a group is that its language of geodesics, Geo(S), is a context-free language. The question is a direct application of this definition. This makes the answer 'Yes'.
    3.  For (c), we test if the conjugacy closure of a context-free set is always context-free. We use a counterexample: K corresponding to the CFL L = {a^n b^n}. Its conjugacy closure α(K) contains a set of words {b^m a^{m+p} b^p}, which is not a context-free language. Therefore, α(K) is not necessarily context-free. The choice of generators does not change this property. This makes the answer 'No'.
