    This function analyzes different pond characteristics to determine which
    poses the greatest medical threat from a specific mosquito species.

    The logic is based on two key principles:
    1. Larger Surface Area: A larger pond can support more mosquito larvae.
    2. Older Age: An older pond has a more established ecosystem, which is
       more suitable for insect communities to thrive.

    A 'Threat Index' is calculated as: Surface Area * Age
    The pond with the highest index is the most likely to host the largest
    mosquito population.
