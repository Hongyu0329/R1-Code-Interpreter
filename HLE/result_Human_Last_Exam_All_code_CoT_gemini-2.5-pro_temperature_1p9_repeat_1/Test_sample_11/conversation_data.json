    "My plan is to first identify the correct Israeli statute that was the first to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\". Based on legal scholarship, this principle was famously codified as a general, overarching duty in a specific 1973 law. Then, I will create a simple Python script to print the name of this law, as requested. The script will contain the name of the statute as a string and use the `print()` function to output it. I will ensure the final output string does not include \"the\" or the year of the statute, as per the instructions.\n\n```python\ndef get_statute_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the name of the first statute in modern Israel\n    to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973 is widely cited by legal scholars\n    # as the landmark legislation that introduced the \"good faith\" principle\n    # (Tom Lev) as a fundamental concept into Israeli law.\n    statute = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\n    return statute\n\n# Print the name of the statute\nprint(get_statute_name())\n\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
