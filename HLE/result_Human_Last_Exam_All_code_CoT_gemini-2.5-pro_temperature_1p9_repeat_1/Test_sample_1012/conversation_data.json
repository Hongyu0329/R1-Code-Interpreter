    "To answer this question, we need to understand how a quantum computer affects symmetric key encryption.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Threat:** The primary threat from quantum computers against symmetric encryption is Grover's algorithm.\n2.  **Explain Grover's Algorithm:** This algorithm provides a quadratic speedup on unstructured search problems, which includes brute-forcing a symmetric key.\n3.  **Calculate the Impact:** A classical brute-force attack on a key of length *n* takes roughly 2^n operations. With Grover's algorithm, a quantum computer can do it in roughly sqrt(2^n) = 2^(n/2) operations. This effectively halves the security level in bits.\n4.  **Determine the Required Security Level:** The current industry standard for strong, long-term security is a 128-bit security level. This means an attacker would need to perform about 2^128 operations to break the encryption.\n5.  **Calculate the Post-Quantum Key Length:** To maintain a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, we need a key of length *k* such that the effort to break it is at least 2^128. Using the formula from step 3, we set up the equation: k/2 = 128.\n6.  **Solve for k:** Solving for *k*, we find k = 256. Therefore, a 256-bit key is required to provide a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer.\n\nThe following Python code will demonstrate this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_post_quantum_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure\n    against a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The industry standard target for classical security is 128 bits.\n    # This means an attacker would need to perform approximately 2^128 operations.\n    target_security_level = 128\n\n    # Grover's algorithm from quantum computing provides a quadratic speedup.\n    # This means the effective security of a key of length 'k' is k/2 bits.\n    # To maintain our target security level, the effective quantum security (k/2)\n    # must be equal to our target classical security level.\n    # Equation: k / 2 = target_security_level\n    quantum_impact_factor = 2\n    required_key_length = target_security_level * quantum_impact_factor\n\n    print(f\"The target security level against classical computers is {target_security_level} bits.\")\n    print(\"A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm reduces a key's effective strength by a square root, which is equivalent to halving the bit length for security calculations.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the required key length 'k', we set up the equation:\")\n    print(f\"k / {quantum_impact_factor} = {target_security_level}\")\n    print(\"\\nSolving for k:\")\n    print(f\"k = {target_security_level} * {quantum_impact_factor}\")\n    print(f\"k = {required_key_length}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, a symmetric key must be at least {required_key_length} bits long to be considered secure against a quantum computer.\")\n\ncalculate_post_quantum_key_length()\n<<<A>>>"
