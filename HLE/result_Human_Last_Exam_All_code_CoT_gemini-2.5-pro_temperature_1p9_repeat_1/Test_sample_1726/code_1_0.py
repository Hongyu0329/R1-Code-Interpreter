    print("1. Is the relativity of simultaneity still true?")
    print("   Answer: YES.")
    print("   Explanation: Events that are simultaneous in one frame (t1 = t2) but occur at different locations (x1 != x2) will occur at different times in a moving frame because of the 'vx' term in the time transformation (t' = (vx + t)/sqrt(1+v^2)).\n")

    print("2. Is the relativity of lengths still true?")
    print("   Answer: YES.")
    print("   Explanation: Yes, but it manifests as length *expansion*, not contraction. A moving object appears longer than its proper length.\n")

    print("3. Is the relativity of time still true?")
    print("   Answer: YES.")
    print("   Explanation: Yes, but it manifests as time *contraction*, not dilation. A moving clock appears to tick faster than a stationary clock.\n")

    print("4. Is the invariance of the speed of light still true?")
    print("   Answer: NO.")
    print("   Explanation: There is no special, real speed that is invariant under these transformations. The only invariant speed is the imaginary number 'i'. The speed of light would change from one frame to another.\n")

    print("5. Is the non-Newtonian addition of speeds still true?")
    print("   Answer: YES.")
    print("   Explanation: The formula for adding velocities is different from the simple Newtonian u = u' + v. It is non-linear.\n")
