    Calculates the number of equivalence classes for the given topological space.

    The equivalence relation x ~ y holds if there is an auto-homeomorphism of the space
    sending x to y. The total space is a disjoint union of five components.
    An auto-homeomorphism must map components to homeomorphic components. Since all
    five components are topologically distinct, any auto-homeomorphism maps each
    component to itself.
    Therefore, the total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the number of
    equivalence classes in each component.
