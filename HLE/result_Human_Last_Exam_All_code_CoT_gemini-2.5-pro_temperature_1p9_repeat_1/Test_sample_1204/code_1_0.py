    # Analysis of each option based on the clinical scenario.
    # I. Counsel patient on stopping cannabis: HIGHLY appropriate. The heavy use is likely causing/worsening insomnia and anxiety.
    # II. Hospitalize for med detox: INAPPROPRIATE. Abruptly stopping all meds is dangerous.
    # III. Order a urine drug test: HIGH_LY appropriate. Standard of care for substance use history and before considering stimulants.
    # IV. Prescribe melatonin for insomnia: APPROPRIATE. Safe, non-addictive option for a major distressing symptom.
    # V. Change AUD meds: INAPPROPRIATE. AUD is in remission; no reason to change a working regimen.
    # VI. Start atomoxetine: INCORRECT. Patient is already on this medication.
    
    # The three highest priority actions are I, III, and IV.
    # Option I addresses the root cause of the current problems.
    # Option III is an essential diagnostic and safety measure.
    # Option IV provides safe, supportive care for a primary complaint (insomnia).
