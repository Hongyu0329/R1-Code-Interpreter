  # (a) Can V(p) decompose as a direct sum of simple modules? If not, does another decomposition exist?

  # However, a decomposition into indecomposable modules exists.

  # By definition, the top-level is rho_n, which is (n+1)-dimensional.

  # (c) What is the minimal conformal weight in the decomposition for p=2?
  # Any VOA contains the vacuum vector with conformal weight 0. This is the minimum possible weight.
