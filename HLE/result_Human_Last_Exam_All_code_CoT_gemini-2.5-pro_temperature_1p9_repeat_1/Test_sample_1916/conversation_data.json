    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic categories that have exactly one object and three morphisms.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Rephrasing the problem:** A category with a single object is completely defined by its set of morphisms and their composition. The morphisms form a monoid under composition, with the identity morphism acting as the identity element of the monoid. The problem states there are three morphisms, so we are looking for the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n2.  **Monoid Structure:** Let the three morphisms be $\\{e, a, b\\}$, where `e` is the identity morphism. The composition operation must satisfy two main properties:\n    *   **Identity:** For any morphism `x`, `e ∘ x = x` and `x ∘ e = x`.\n    *   **Associativity:** For any morphisms `x, y, z`, `(x ∘ y) ∘ z = x ∘ (y ∘ z)`.\n\n3.  **Systematic Search:** The composition rules are fixed for the identity element `e`. The structure of the monoid is determined by the four products involving non-identity elements: `a ∘ a`, `a ∘ b`, `b ∘ a`, and `b ∘ b`. Each of these products can be `e`, `a`, or `b`. This gives $3^4 = 81$ possible multiplication tables.\n\n4.  **Implementation:** We can write a script to perform the following steps:\n    a. **Generate all possibilities:** Create all 81 potential multiplication tables.\n    b. **Check for associativity:** For each table, verify if the associativity law holds for all combinations of morphisms.\n    c. **Filter for isomorphism:** The valid (associative) monoids are then grouped into isomorphism classes. Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by renaming the non-identity elements `a` and `b`.\n    d. **Count and display:** The final count of these isomorphism classes is the answer. The script will also display the multiplication tables for each unique category found.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = (0, 1, 2)  # 0: identity 'e', 1: 'a', 2: 'b'\n    non_identity = (1, 2)\n\n    # Step 1: Find all associative multiplication tables\n    valid_monoids_prods = []\n    # prods represents the results of (a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b)\n    for prods in itertools.product(elements, repeat=4):\n        \n        table = [\n            [0, 1, 2],\n            [1, prods[0], prods[1]],\n            [2, prods[2], prods[3]]\n        ]\n\n        def op(x, y):\n            return table[x][y]\n\n        # Step 2: Check associativity law\n        # It's sufficient to check for non-identity elements since the identity element 'e' (0) always satisfies the law.\n        is_associative = True\n        for x in non_identity:\n            for y in non_identity:\n                for z in non_identity:\n                    if op(op(x, y), z) != op(x, op(y, z)):\n                        is_associative = False\n                        break\n                if not is_associative:\n                    break\n            if not is_associative:\n                break\n        \n        if is_associative:\n            valid_monoids_prods.append(prods)\n\n    # Step 3: Filter for non-isomorphic monoids\n    representatives = []\n    for prods1 in valid_monoids_prods:\n        is_isomorphic_to_existing = False\n        for prods2 in representatives:\n            # Two monoids are isomorphic if we can remap their non-identity elements\n            # to make their multiplication tables identical.
