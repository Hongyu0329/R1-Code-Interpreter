    "The theologian you're looking for is Augustine of Hippo.\n\nMy plan is to explain the key concept he developed and how it applies to the user's specific examples.\n1.  **Identify the theologian:** Augustine of Hippo (354â€“430 AD).\n2.  **Identify the specialized terminology:** The key concept is *rationes seminales*, which translates to \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal principles.\"\n3.  **Explain the concept:** Augustine proposed that at the moment of creation, God embedded these latent \"seeds\" or potentials for everything that would ever come into being. The normal, predictable operation of the world, which we call the laws of nature, is the gradual unfolding of these principles in their typical sequence.\n4.  **Apply to the Fall:** From this perspective, the alteration of natural laws at the Fall was not a rewriting of cosmic rules, but a change in how these embedded principles manifested. For example, the ground now bringing forth \"thorns and thistles\" or the introduction of decay and death could be seen as the activation or corruption of these seminal reasons due to sin.\n5.  **Apply to the Virgin Birth:** Miracles, including the Virgin Birth, are not violations of nature as God created it, but rather an activation of a seminal reason outside of its normal, expected course. In this view, the potential for a virgin to conceive was a *ratio seminalis* embedded within human nature from the beginning, which God chose to activate at a specific moment in history. Thus, it was contrary to the *course* of nature as we experience it, but not contrary to the deeper potential *of* nature itself.\n\nThis framework allowed Augustine to describe significant changes and unique events within the natural order without portraying God as arbitrarily breaking His own laws.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
