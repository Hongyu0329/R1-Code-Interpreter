    "To determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we need to count the unique players who have achieved this feat. The Triple Crown can be won by either a batter (leading the league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs) or a pitcher (leading in wins, ERA, and strikeouts). I will count the unique players in each category and then add them together.\n\n```python\ndef count_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the total number of unique MLB Triple Crown winners.\n    It lists the batting and pitching winners separately, counts each group,\n    and then sums the counts to find the total.\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown\n    batting_winners = [\n        \"Paul Hines\", \"Tip O'Neill\", \"Nap Lajoie\", \"Ty Cobb\", \"Heinie Zimmerman\",\n        \"Rogers Hornsby\", \"Chuck Klein\", \"Jimmie Foxx\", \"Lou Gehrig\", \"Joe Medwick\",\n        \"Ted Williams\", \"Mickey Mantle\", \"Frank Robinson\", \"Carl Yastrzemski\", \"Miguel Cabrera\"\n    ]\n\n    # List of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown\n    pitching_winners = [\n        \"Tommy Bond\", \"Old Hoss Radbourn\", \"Tim Keefe\", \"John Clarkson\", \"Amos Rusie\",\n        \"Cy Young\", \"Rube Waddell\", \"Christy Mathewson\", \"Walter Johnson\", \"Pete Alexander\",\n        \"Dazzy Vance\", \"Lefty Grove\", \"Lefty Gomez\", \"Bob Feller\", \"Hal Newhouser\",\n        \"Sandy Koufax\", \"Jake Peavy\", \"Clayton Kershaw\", \"Justin Verlander\", \"Shane Bieber\"\n    ]\n\n    num_batting_winners = len(batting_winners)\n    num_pitching_winners = len(pitching_winners)\n    total_winners = num_batting_winners + num_pitching_winners\n\n    print(\"List of Unique Batting Triple Crown Winners:\")\n    for winner in batting_winners:\n        print(f\"- {winner}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"List of Unique Pitching Triple Crown Winners:\")\n    for winner in pitching_winners:\n        print(f\"- {winner}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Calculating the total number of unique Triple Crown winners:\")\n    print(f\"Number of Batting Winners + Number of Pitching Winners = Total Winners\")\n    print(f\"{num_batting_winners} + {num_pitching_winners} = {total_winners}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    print(f\"There are a total of {total_winners} unique Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<35>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
