    print("1. Charles is struggling to keep up with the demands he placed on himself within the first couple of weeks.")
    print("2. His diet is extremely restrictive. Limiting protein, fat, AND carbohydrates simultaneously is not a balanced or sustainable approach for long-term health and energy levels.")
    print("3. While exercise is a good goal and psychotherapy is already helping, the immediate difficulty is most likely stemming from the demanding and low-energy nature of his diet plan.")
    print("4. To make his lifestyle change sustainable, especially with a job that requires travel, Charles should first adjust the most challenging and unsustainable part of his plan.")
    print("\nConclusion: Charles needs to adjust his diet first to be more balanced and sustainable.")
