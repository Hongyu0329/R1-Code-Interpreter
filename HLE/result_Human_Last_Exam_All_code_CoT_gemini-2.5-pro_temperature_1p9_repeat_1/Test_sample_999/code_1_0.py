# The user wants me to identify the incorrect statement about neural network quantization.
# I have analyzed each option and determined that statement B is incorrect.
# The reasoning is that the described quantization scheme (per-token activations and per-channel weights)
# is known to be inefficient to implement on GPUs because the dequantization step involves an
# outer-product of scaling vectors, which is not natively supported by high-performance GEMM routines
# and the overhead often cancels out the benefits of INT8 computation.
# Therefore, the claim of achieving runtime speed-up is false in the general case.

# There is no calculation to perform, I just need to output the final answer letter.

answer = 'B'
print(f"The incorrect statement is B.")
print("Explanation:")
print("Statement B claims that a combination of per-token quantization for activations (scaling from T dimension) and per-output-channel quantization for weights (scaling from Co dimension) leads to speed-up using INT8 GEMM kernels. This is generally false.")
print("The dequantization step for this scheme requires scaling the output matrix element-wise with an outer product of the two scaling vectors (one for tokens, one for channels).")
print("This operation is not natively accelerated by standard GPU GEMM hardware/libraries, and the overhead of implementing it in a custom kernel often makes it slower than performing the original computation in FP16 or FP32. Therefore, the claim of achieving a runtime speed-up is incorrect.")
