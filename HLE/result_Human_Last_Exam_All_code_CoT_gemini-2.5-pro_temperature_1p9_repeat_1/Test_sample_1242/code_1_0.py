    The question asks to identify a group of linguistic features that are strong predictors of the complexity of individual words.

    Step 1: Evaluate the options based on whether they describe individual words or entire texts.
    - 'Word length', 'syllable count', 'word familiarity rating', 'concreteness rating', and 'imageability rating' are all properties that can be measured for a single word.
    - 'Number of unique words' and 'number of word categories' are properties of a text or a collection of words, not an individual word. Therefore, they are not direct predictors of the complexity of a single word.

    Step 2: Eliminate options containing text-level features.
    - Option A contains 'number of unique words'.
    - Option B contains 'number of word categories'.
    - Option C contains 'number of unique words'.
    - Option E contains 'number of word categories'.
    - These options (A, B, C, E) are therefore less suitable for predicting the complexity of *individual words*.

    Step 3: Analyze the remaining option.
    - Option D consists of: 'word length', 'word familiarity rating', 'syllable count', and 'concreteness rating'.
    - All four of these are well-established, word-level features in psycholinguistics and readability research.
        *   Word Length & Syllable Count: Classic, structural measures of complexity. Longer, polysyllabic words are generally harder to process.
        *   Word Familiarity Rating: A powerful psycholinguistic predictor. Words that are more familiar are processed more quickly and easily.
        *   Concreteness Rating: A semantic predictor. Concrete words (e.g., 'table') are easier to process and understand than abstract words (e.g., 'justice').

    Conclusion: The set of features in option D provides a comprehensive and widely accepted model for predicting the complexity of individual words, combining both structural and psycholinguistic aspects.
