    "To determine which peptide is most likely to bind an integrin receptor, we need to analyze the amino acid sequence of each option. The \"RGD\" (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) motif is the core recognition sequence for many integrins. However, the amino acids flanking this motif play a critical role in determining binding affinity and specificity for different integrin subtypes.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to simulate a search against a small database of well-documented integrin-binding sequences found in scientific literature. The script will check each answer choice against this database to find the most established binder. The 'RGDSP' sequence, derived from the cell-adhesion protein fibronectin, is a classic and potent integrin-binding motif frequently used in *in vitro* studies.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define the list of peptide choices.\n2.  Create a small \"database\" of known, well-characterized integrin-binding motifs.\n3.  Iterate through each choice and check if it contains a motif from the database.\n4.  Print the findings and conclude which peptide is the most likely binder based on the established evidence.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_integrin_binder():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the most likely integrin-binding peptide from a list of candidates\n    by searching against a database of known motifs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # List of candidate peptides from the user's query\n    peptides = {\n        'A': 'RGDMAA',\n        'B': 'RGDSPSS',\n        'C': 'RGDLTTP',\n        'D': 'RGDQVSK',\n        'E': 'RGDARGG'\n    }\n\n    # A small database of well-characterized integrin-binding motifs.\n    # The RGDSP sequence from fibronectin is a classic example known for its\n    # high affinity and frequent use in in vitro assays.\n    known_motifs_db = {\n        'RGDSP': 'This motif is from fibronectin, a major extracellular matrix protein and a primary ligand for many integrins (e.g., a5b1).
