    print("1. Understanding the Function `def_superfast(10000)`")
    print("The function is defined as returning `Huge_int + 1`.")
    print("`Huge_int` is the largest integer returned by any halting Python program with a source code shorter than 10000 characters.\n")

    print("2. The Link to the Halting Problem")
    print("To calculate `Huge_int`, one must first identify all Python programs shorter than 10000 characters that are guaranteed to halt.")
    print("However, the problem of determining whether an arbitrary program will halt or run forever is the famous 'Halting Problem'.")
    print("Alan Turing proved that the Halting Problem is undecidable, meaning no general algorithm can exist to solve it.")
    print("Since `Huge_int`'s calculation requires solving the Halting Problem, `Huge_int` is an uncomputable number.\n")

    print("3. Proof by Contradiction")
    print("Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that a Python program `P` *could* exist to compute `def_superfast(10000)`.")
    print("Let `C` be the value that `P` computes. By definition, `C = Huge_int + 1`.")
    print("Every program has a source code with a certain length. Let the length of `P`'s source code be `L` characters.")
    print("\nNow, consider the case where the program P is short, i.e., `L < 10000`:\n")
    print("- If `L < 10000`, then program `P` itself is in the set of programs used to define `Huge_int`.")
    print("- Program `P` must halt (by our assumption) and returns the integer `C`.")
    print("- By definition, `Huge_int` is the LARGEST integer returned by any program in this set. Therefore, `Huge_int` must be greater than or equal to the output of `P`.")
    print("- This gives us the inequality: `Huge_int >= C`.")
    print("- Since we started with `C = Huge_int + 1`, we can substitute this into the inequality.\n")
    
    print("4. The Final Contradictory Equation")
    print("The assumption leads to a mathematical contradiction. If we substitute C, the inequality becomes:")
    print("`Huge_int >= Huge_int + 1`")
    print("This can be simplified to a clear falsehood:")

    inequality_right_side = 1
    
    # Print each number in the final equation
    print(f"    {inequality_left_side} >= {inequality_right_side}\n")
    
    print("This statement is impossible, which proves that our initial assumption—that a program `P` with length less than 10000 could exist—is false.")
    print("While this proof focuses on a short program P, the uncomputability of the Halting Problem means that no algorithm, and thus no program of *any* length, can be created to compute `def_superfast(10000)`.\n")
