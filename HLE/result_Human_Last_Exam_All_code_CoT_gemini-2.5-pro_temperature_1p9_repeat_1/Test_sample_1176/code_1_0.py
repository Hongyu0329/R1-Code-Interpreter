  This function provides the solution to the geology quiz.

  The statements are analyzed as follows:
  (1) The Morrison formation represents a foredeep deposit. -> C (Consensus)
  (2) Metamorphic core complexes formed in response to a slab window. -> D (Debated)
  (3) An orogenic plateau ("Nevadaplano") existed in Nevada by end of Cretaceous. -> D (Debated)
  (4) An "Arizonaplano" was constructed via magmatic thickening. -> D (Debated)
  (5) Laramide-style structures are generally inboard of Sevier-style structures. -> C (Consensus)
  (6) The Sierra Nevada/Idaho Batholith were formed by the Cordilleran arc. -> C (Consensus)
  (7) Ignimbrite eruptions began in Eocene and propagated southwest (Yellowstone track). -> C (Consensus)
  (8) Colorado Plateau reached modern elevations by the late Cretaceous. -> D (Debated)
  (9) Cascades arc reached modern elevation by late Oligocene. -> D (Debated)
  (10) Laramide deformation was caused by subduction of Shatsky conjugate. -> D (Debated)

  The final answer is the concatenation of these results.
