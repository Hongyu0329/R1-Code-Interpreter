    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform a calculation with very high precision. The number 10^100, also known as a googol, is far too large for standard computer floating-point arithmetic.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Acknowledge Periodicity**: The tangent function `tan(x)` is periodic with a period of π. This means that `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding `tan(10^100 mod π)`.\n2.  **Use High-Precision Math**: To calculate the remainder of `10^100` divided by `π`, we need to know the value of `π` to a high degree of accuracy. The number `10^100` has 101 digits, so we need a library that can handle numbers and `π` with more than 101 digits of precision.\n3.  **Employ `mpmath` Library**: Python's `mpmath` library is perfectly suited for this task. It provides arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic and includes mathematical functions that operate on these high-precision numbers.\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**:\n    *   We will set the precision (`dps`, or decimal places) in `mpmath` to a value safely above 101, for instance, 120.\n    *   We will then use `mpmath` to calculate `tan(10^100)`. The `mpmath.tan()` function will automatically and correctly handle the large argument by reducing it modulo `π`.\n    *   Finally, we will convert the numerical result into a string and extract the first three characters that appear after the decimal point.\n\nFollowing this plan, here is the Python code to find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we must use\n# high-precision arithmetic because 10^100 is an extremely large number.\n# We will use the 'mpmath' library for this purpose.\n\n# The tangent function is periodic with period π. The mpmath library's\n# tan function correctly handles large arguments by reducing them modulo π.\n\n# We set the working decimal precision (dps). Since 10^100 has 101 digits,\n# we need a precision greater than that to get an accurate result.\n# We choose 120 decimal places for a safe margin.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 120\n\n# Define the number 10^100 as a high-precision number.\nbase = 10\nexponent = 100\nnumber = mpmath.mpf(base)**exponent\n\n# Calculate tan(10^100).\nresult = mpmath.tan(number)\n\n# To fulfill the requirement of outputting each number in the final equation,\n# we will print the elements of the equation tan(10^100) = result.\nprint(f\"Calculating tan({base}^{exponent})\")\nprint(f\"Result: {result}\")\n\n# To extract the required digits, we convert the result to a string.\nresult_str = str(result)\n\n# Find the position of the decimal point.\ndecimal_point_index = result_str.find('.')\n\n# The first three digits after the comma are the three characters\n# immediately following the decimal point.\nfirst_three_digits = result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n\nprint(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma are: {first_three_digits}\")\n```\n<<<603>>>"
