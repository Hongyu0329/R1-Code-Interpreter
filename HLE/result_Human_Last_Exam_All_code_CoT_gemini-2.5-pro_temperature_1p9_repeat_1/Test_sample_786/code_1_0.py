    Calculates the approximation factor for the Multicut problem.

    The Multicut problem on general graphs is NP-hard. The best-known polynomial-time
    approximation algorithm, by Garg, Vazirani, and Yannakakis, achieves an
    approximation ratio of O(log k), where k is the number of terminal pairs.
    Hardness results, particularly under the Unique Games Conjecture, show that
    improving this factor to o(log k) is not possible in polynomial time.

    Given answer choices, the expression "log k" is best interpreted as the natural
    logarithm (ln k), which matches the value provided in one of the options.

    We calculate the value for k = 10^6.

    # Using the natural logarithm (base e), as is common in the analysis of these algorithms.
