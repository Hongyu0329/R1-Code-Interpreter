def solve_clique_number():
    """
    This function explains the reasoning and computes the clique number of the graph X.
    
    The problem defines a sequence of mathematical objects:
    1. D: The poset of real numbers (R, <=).
    2. P: The nerve of D. Since D is a total order, any finite subset of R is a simplex in P.
    3. 1-skeleton of P: This is the graph where vertices are R and an edge connects any two distinct vertices. This is the complete graph K_R.
    4. G (1-skeleton of P as a directed graph): We orient the edges of K_R using the order from D. An edge (u, v) exists if and only if u < v. This graph G is acyclic.
    5. X (Line graph of G): The vertices of X are the directed edges of G. Let X' be the underlying undirected graph of X. Two vertices in X', e1 = (u1, v1) and e2 = (u2, v2), are adjacent if the head of one is the tail of the other (v1 = u2 or v2 = u1).
    
    We need to find the clique number of X', which is the size of the largest complete subgraph in X'.
    
    Let C be a clique in X'.
    
    Analysis for a clique of size 3:
    Let C = {e1, e2, e3} be a clique, where e1=(u1, v1), e2=(u2, v2), e3=(u3, v3).
    For these to be vertices of X', we must have u1 < v1, u2 < v2, and u3 < v3.
    
    For C to be a clique, every pair must be adjacent.
    - Adjacency(e1, e2) => (v1 = u2) or (v2 = u1)
    - Adjacency(e1, e3) => (v1 = u3) or (v3 = u1)
    - Adjacency(e2, e3) => (v2 = u3) or (v3 = u2)
    
    Let's assume v1 = u2. This implies a path u1 -> v1 -> v2 in G, so u1 < v1 < v2.
    This assumption, combined with the other adjacency conditions and the fact that all tails and all heads in a clique must be distinct, forces a single structure for a 3-clique:
    - e1 = (u1, v1)
    - e2 = (v1, v2)
    - e3 = (v2, u1)
    
    For these to be valid edges in G, their tails must be less than their heads:
    1. u1 < v1
    2. v1 < v2
    3. v2 < u1
    
    Combining these inequalities gives: u1 < v1 < v2 < u1. This is a contradiction.
    Therefore, a clique of size 3 cannot exist.
    
    Analysis for a clique of size 2:
    Let's check if a clique of size 2 can exist.
    Consider the vertices e1 = (1, 2) and e2 = (2, 3).
    These are valid vertices because 1 < 2 and 2 < 3.
    Adjacency condition: Is (v1 = u2) or (v2 = u1)?
    - v1 is the head of e1, which is 2.
    - u2 is the tail of e2, which is 2.
    Since v1 = u2 (2 = 2), the vertices are adjacent.
    The set {e1, e2} forms a clique of size 2.
    
    Conclusion:
    The maximum clique size is not 3 or more, but it is at least 2.
    Thus, the clique number of X is 2.
