def solve_set_theory_problem():
    """
    This function solves the given set theory problem and prints the result.

    The problem analysis leads to the following conclusions:
    1. The definition of a "tower" in the problem is a maximal tower in the sense of set-theoretic cardinal invariants.
    2. The length of such a tower, lambda, must be a regular cardinal.
    3. The minimum length of a maximal tower on omega_1 is the tower number t(omega_1).
    4. A theorem in set theory states that if 2^omega_1 = omega_2, then t(omega_1) = omega_2.
       Therefore, any valid tower length lambda must be >= omega_2.
    5. A tower is a strictly decreasing sequence of sets modulo countable subsets. The elements of this sequence correspond to distinct elements in the Boolean algebra P(omega_1)/countable.
    6. The size of this algebra is |P(omega_1)| = 2^omega_1 = omega_2. A strict chain cannot be longer than the size of the set it is drawn from.
       Therefore, lambda <= omega_2.
    7. Combining the conditions, lambda must be exactly omega_2.
    8. The set X contains all regular cardinals lambda for which such a tower exists. This means X = {omega_2}.
    9. delta_1, the supremum of X, is omega_2.
    10. delta_2, the infimum of X, is omega_2.
    11. The final sum is delta_1 + delta_2 (using cardinal arithmetic).
