    "Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Solve the Differential Equation**: The given equation, $x_{3}'(t) + \\tanh(t) x_{3}(t) = e^{-\\frac{t}{3}}$, is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it using an integrating factor, which is $I(t) = e^{\\int \\tanh(t) dt} = \\cosh(t)$. Multiplying the equation by the integrating factor gives $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\cosh(t) x_3(t)) = \\cosh(t)e^{-t/3}$. Integrating both sides and using the initial condition $x_3(0) = 5$, we find the particular solution:\n    $$ \\cosh(t) x_3(t) = \\frac{3}{4} e^{\\frac{2t}{3}} - \\frac{3}{8} e^{-\\frac{4t}{3}} + \\frac{37}{8} $$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Expression to Evaluate**: We need to find the value of $(10^{5} + 10^{-5})x_{3}(\\ln10^{5}) + \\frac{3}{4}10^{\\frac{-20}{3}}$.\n    Let's set $t_0 = \\ln(10^5)$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Expression**:\n    *   First, notice that the term $(10^5 + 10^{-5})$ can be rewritten using the definition of $\\cosh(t)$. Since $t_0 = \\ln(10^5)$, we have $e^{t_0} = 10^5$ and $e^{-t_0} = 10^{-5}$. Therefore, $10^5 + 10^{-5} = e^{t_0} + e^{-t_0} = 2\\cosh(t_0)$.\n    *   The first part of the expression becomes $2\\cosh(t_0) x_3(t_0)$.\n    *   From our solution to the ODE, we can substitute the value of $\\cosh(t_0)x_3(t_0)$:\n        $$ 2\\cosh(t_0) x_3(t_0) = 2 \\left( \\frac{3}{4} e^{\\frac{2t_0}{3}} - \\frac{3}{8} e^{-\\frac{4t_0}{3}} + \\frac{37}{8} \\right) = \\frac{3}{2}e^{\\frac{2t_0}{3}} - \\frac{3}{4}e^{-\\frac{4t_0}{3}} + \\frac{37}{4} $$\n    *   Now, we substitute $t_0 = \\ln(10^5)$ into the exponential terms:\n        *   $e^{\\frac{2t_0}{3}} = (e^{\\ln(10^5)})^{2/3} = (10^5)^{2/3} = 10^{10/3}$\n        *   $e^{-\\frac{4t_0}{3}} = (e^{\\ln(10^5)})^{-4/3} = (10^5)^{-4/3} = 10^{-20/3}$\n    *   The full expression is now:\n        $$ \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10^{\\frac{10}{3}} - \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 10^{-\\frac{20}{3}} + \\frac{37}{4} \\right) + \\frac{3}{4}10^{-\\frac{20}{3}} $$\n    *   The terms involving $10^{-20/3}$ cancel out, leaving a simplified expression:\n        $$ \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10^{\\frac{10}{3}} + \\frac{37}{4} $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Value**: A Python script can now be used to compute the numerical value of this simplified expression.\n\n```python\n# The final simplified expression to calculate is (3/2) * 10**(10/3) + 37/4.\n\n# Define the components of the expression\ncoefficient1 = 3/2\nbase = 10\nexponent = 10/3\nterm1 = coefficient1 * (base ** exponent)\n\nterm2 = 37/4\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = term1 + term2\n\n# Print the final equation with the computed values\nprint(f\"The calculation is based on the simplified expression: (3/2) * 10**(10/3) + 37/4\")\nprint(f\"The value of the first term is: {term1}\")\nprint(f\"The value of the second term is: {term2}\")\nprint(f\"The final equation is: {term1} + {term2} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<3240.903932303028>>>"
