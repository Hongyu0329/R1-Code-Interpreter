# The final simplified expression to calculate is (3/2) * 10**(10/3) + 37/4.

# Define the components of the expression
coefficient1 = 3/2
base = 10
exponent = 10/3
term1 = coefficient1 * (base ** exponent)

term2 = 37/4

# Calculate the final result
result = term1 + term2

# Print the final equation with the computed values
