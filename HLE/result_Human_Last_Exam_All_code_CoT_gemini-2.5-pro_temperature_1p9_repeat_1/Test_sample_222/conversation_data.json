    "To solve this problem, we need to find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence. An N-point DFT is typically defined for an N-point sequence. When we compute an M-point DFT of an N-point sequence where M < N, it implies that the sequence is first aliased in the time domain.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the sequence:** The new 8-point sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n    `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n2.  **Time-Domain Aliasing:** To compute a 4-point DFT of this 8-point sequence, we create a 4-point aliased sequence, let's call it `y_a(n)`, by wrapping `y(n)` every 4 points and summing:\n    `y_a(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for n = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n3.  **DFT Property (Decimation in Frequency):** A key property of the DFT states that the DFT of this time-aliased sequence `y_a(n)` is equivalent to taking the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of the original sequence `y(n)`.\n4.  **Relate to `X(k)` and `H(k)`:** The 8-point DFT of the interleaved sequence `y(n)`, denoted `Y(k)`, can be found directly from the given 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` using a formula derived from the decimation-in-time FFT algorithm:\n    `Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)`, where `W_N^k = exp(-j*2*pi*k/N)`.\n5.  **Combine and Simplify:** Combining these properties, the desired 4-point DFT, let's call it `Y_final(k)`, is:\n    `Y_final(k) = Y(2k) = X(2k mod 4) + W_8^(2k) * H(2k mod 4)`\n    Since `W_8^(2k) = exp(-j*2*pi*2k/8) = exp(-j*2*pi*k/4) = W_4^k`, the final formula is:\n    `Y_final(k) = X(2k mod 4) + W_4^k * H(2k mod 4)` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n6.  **Execute:** We will use a Python script to apply this formula for k=0, 1, 2, and 3, printing each step of the calculation.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef format_complex(c):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to format complex numbers nicely for printing.\"\"\"\n    r, i = np.round(c.real, 2), np.round(c.imag, 2)\n    \n    if abs(i) < 1e-9:\n        return f\"{r:.0f}\"\n    \n    if abs(r) < 1e-9:\n        if abs(abs(i) - 1) < 1e-9:\n            return f\"j\" if i > 0 else f\"-j\"\n        else:\n            return f\"{i:.0f}j\"\n\n    op = \"+\" if i > 0 else \"-\"\n    i_abs = abs(i)\n\n    if abs(i_abs - 1) < 1e-9:\n        return f\"({r:.0f}{op}j)\"\n    else:\n        return f\"({r:.0f}{op}{i_abs:.0f}j)\"\n\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 4-point DFT of the interleaved sequence and prints the steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j], dtype=complex)\n    H = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j], dtype=complex)\n\n    # Let Y_final(k) be the 4-point DFT of the interleaved sequence.\n    Y_final = []\n\n    print(\"To find the 4-point DFT for the 8-point sequence {x(0),h(0),...,x(3),h(3)},\")\n    print(\"we use the formula: Y(k) = X(2k mod 4) + (W_4^k) * H(2k mod 4)\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate for k = 0, 1, 2, 3\n    for k in range(4):\n        # Calculate the twiddle factor W_4^k = exp(-j*2*pi*k/4)\n        w_factor = np.exp(-1j * 2 * np.pi * k / 4)\n        \n        # Get the index for X and H, which is (2*k mod 4)\n        idx = (2 * k) % 4\n        \n        # Get the corresponding values from the input DFTs\n        x_val = X[idx]\n        h_val = H[idx]\n        \n        # Calculate the final DFT value for the current k\n        y_val = x_val + w_factor * h_val\n        Y_final.append(y_val)\n        \n        print(f\"For k={k}:\")\n        print(f\"Y({k}) = X({idx}) + W_4^{k} * H({idx})\")\n        print(f\"    = {format_complex(x_val)} + {format_complex(w_factor)} * {format_complex(h_val)}\")\n        print(f\"    = {format_complex(y_val)}\\n\")\n\n    # Format the final list for display\n    final_result_list = [format_complex(c).replace('(','').replace(')','') for c in Y_final]\n    print(f\"The final 4-point DFT is Y(k) = [{','.join(final_result_list)}]\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<[1,-1-j,1,-1+j]>>>"
