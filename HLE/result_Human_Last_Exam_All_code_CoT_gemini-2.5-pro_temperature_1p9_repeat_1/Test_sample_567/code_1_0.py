# The value 'a' where the volume constraint becomes the only obstruction for the symplectic embedding
# of the ellipsoid E(1,a) into a 4-ball is given by the fourth power of the golden ratio, tau.
# This script calculates this value.
# Formula: a = tau^4 = ((1 + sqrt(5)) / 2)^4

# Define the components of the equation
one = 1
two = 2
four = 4
five = 5

# Perform the calculation step-by-step
sqrt_five = math.sqrt(five)
numerator = one + sqrt_five
golden_ratio = numerator / two
a_value = golden_ratio**four

# Print the final equation with all the numbers involved
print(f"The threshold value 'a' is calculated from the equation: (({one} + sqrt({five})) / {two}) ** {four}")
print(f"Step 1: The square root of {five} is {sqrt_five}")
print(f"Step 2: {one} plus the square root of {five} is {numerator}")
print(f"Step 3: The golden ratio (the result of Step 2 divided by {two}) is {golden_ratio}")
print(f"Step 4: The final value 'a' (the golden ratio raised to the power of {four}) is {a_value}")
