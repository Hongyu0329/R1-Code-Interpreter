    "The problem asks for the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ for a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit). I will solve this step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Pauli Channel Definition**: A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional system is defined by its action on a density matrix $\\rho$:\n    $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{jk} P_{jk} \\rho P_{jk}^\\dagger$\n    Here, $\\{P_{jk}\\}_{j,k=0}^{d-1}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, which are unitary and form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $\\{p_{jk}\\}$ form a probability distribution, meaning $p_{jk} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{j,k} p_{jk} = 1$. The operators $K_{jk} = \\sqrt{p_{jk}} P_{jk}$ are the Kraus operators for this channel.\n\n2.  **Rank of a Complementary Channel**: For any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{K_i\\}$, its complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ describes the information that leaks to the environment. A fundamental result in quantum information theory states that the rank of the complementary channel, $\\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c)$, is equal to the rank of the Gram matrix $G$ formed by the Kraus operators. The entries of this matrix are given by $G_{il} = \\text{Tr}(K_i^\\dagger K_l)$.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Gram Matrix for a Pauli Channel**: Let's apply this to our Pauli channel. We only need to consider the Kraus operators for which $p_{jk} > 0$. Let's say there are $r$ such terms, and we index them with a single index $i=1, \\dots, r$. The Kraus operators are $K_i = \\sqrt{p_i} U_i$, where each $U_i$ is a distinct Pauli operator $P_{jk}$. The entries of the Gram matrix are:\n    $G_{il} = \\text{Tr}(K_i^\\dagger K_l) = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_i} U_i)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_l} U_l)) = \\sqrt{p_i p_l} \\text{Tr}(U_i^\\dagger U_l)$\n\n4.  **Using Orthogonality**: The generalized Pauli operators are orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product: $\\text{Tr}(U_i^\\dagger U_l) = d \\cdot \\delta_{il}$. This means the trace is $d$ if $i=l$ and $0$ if $i \\neq l$. Substituting this into our expression for $G_{il}$:\n    $G_{il} = \\sqrt{p_i p_l} \\cdot d \\cdot \\delta_{il} = d \\cdot p_i \\cdot \\delta_{il}$\n    This shows that the Gram matrix $G$ is a diagonal matrix of size $r \\times r$. Its diagonal entries are $\\{d \\cdot p_1, d \\cdot p_2, \\dots, d \\cdot p_r\\}$.\n\n5.  **Determining the Rank**: The rank of a diagonal matrix is the number of its non-zero diagonal entries. Since we constructed our set of Kraus operators from the terms where $p_i > 0$, all the diagonal entries $d \\cdot p_i$ are non-zero. Therefore, the rank of the Gram matrix $G$ is $r$. This means the rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is $r$, which is exactly the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{jk}$ in the definition of the Pauli channel.\n\n6.  **Maximizing the Rank**: To find the maximal possible rank for $\\Lambda^c$, we need to maximize $r$, the number of non-zero $p_{jk}$. The total number of distinct Pauli operators is $d^2$. We can define a valid channel where all $d^2$ probabilities are non-zero. A prime example is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_{jk} = 1/d^2$ for all $j,k=0,\\dots,d-1$. In this case, $r = d^2$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: The maximal number of non-zero terms is $d^2$, and therefore the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a $d$-dimensional Pauli channel is $d^2$.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this result. You can change the value of `dimension_d` to see the maximal rank for different system sizes.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_rank_pauli_complementary():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a\n    Pauli channel for a qudit of a given dimension 'd'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Set the dimension 'd' of the qudit system.\n    # For a qubit, d=2.
