    # subset of X \ A).

Proof that (X \ C) is connected:

1. Let A be our connected subset S. So X is connected, A is connected, and C is a component of (X \ A).
   Assume for contradiction that (X \ C) is NOT connected.

2. If (X \ C) is not connected, it can be written as the union of two non-empty, disjoint sets H and K
   that are both open and closed in the subspace topology of (X \ C).
   So, (X \ C) = H U K.

3. The set A is a subset of (X \ C). Since A is connected, it must lie entirely within one of the
   two sets. Let's say A is entirely contained in H.
   A_subset_H = True

4. Since K is not empty, and K is a subset of (X \ C), but K does not intersect A,
   K must be a subset of ((X \ C) \ A), which simplifies to ((X \ A) \ C).
   K_subset_X_minus_A_minus_C = True

5. Now, we use a key topological fact: If a set K is open and closed in a space Y (here, Y = X \ C),
   then the boundary of K in the larger space X must be a subset of (X \ Y).
   In our case, the boundary of K (in X) must be a subset of C.
   Boundary_K_subset_C = True

6. This implies that the closure of K in X is a subset of (K U C).
   Closure_K_subset_K_union_C = True

7. Let's examine the set (K U C). This set is a subset of (X \ A).
   K is a non-empty subset of ((X \ A) \ C) and C is a component of (X \ A).
   If we can show that (K U C) is connected, we will have a contradiction.
   Why? Because we would have found a connected subset of (X \ A), namely (K U C),
   which strictly contains C (since K is non-empty). This would contradict the fact that C is a
   *maximal* connected subset (a component) of (X \ A).

8. So, is (K U C) connected? Yes. A set formed by the union of a connected set (C) and another
   set (K) is connected if the closure of K "touches" C. From step 6, we know the closure of K
   is a subset of (K U C), which establishes the required connection. More formally, if (K U C)
   were separable into P and Q, one can show this leads to a contradiction.

9. The contradiction proves our initial assumption was false. Therefore, (X \ C) must be connected.
