    "This is a tricky question as it likely refers to a scene that is commonly misremembered. While no major Hollywood film contains this exact sequence of events, the scene that most closely matches the description and is widely believed to be the source of this query is from the horror film *A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child*.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  Identify the movie that contains a scene closely matching the user's description.\n2.  Point out the specific details of the actual scene, noting the small differences from the prompt (e.g., motorcycle instead of a bicycle).\n3.  Create a Python script that prints the name of the movie and, to satisfy the unusual prompt constraint, also isolates and prints the number from the movie's title.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and describes the movie scene that best matches the user's query.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child\"\n    number_in_title = 5\n    scene_description = (\n        \"In this 1989 film, the character Dan has a dream sequence where \"\n        \"he merges with his motorcycle. He then rides recklessly and \"\n        \"crashes head-on into an oncoming truck. While the vehicle is a \"\n        \"motorcycle, not a pink bike, this surreal and memorable crash \"\n        \"is the scene most commonly associated with this specific question.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"The film you are likely thinking of is: '{movie_title}'\")\n    print(\"\\nScene Description:\")\n    print(scene_description)\n    print(\"\\nAs requested, here is the number from the film's title:\")\n    print(number_in_title)\n\nfind_movie_scene()\n```\n<<<A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
