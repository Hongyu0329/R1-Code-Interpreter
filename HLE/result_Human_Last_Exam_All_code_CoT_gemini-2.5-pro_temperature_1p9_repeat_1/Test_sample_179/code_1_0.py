# Define the constants from the problem
A = 10**10
B = 1/100000 - 1
T = 10**20

# As derived in the reasoning, the solution for X0(t) is a constant value.
# X0(t) = A / (B + 1)
# The value is independent of t.

# Calculate the terms of the final equation for X0
numerator = A
denominator = B + 1

# Calculate the value of X0
X0_value = numerator / denominator

# The question asks for the value of X0 at t = T
X0_at_T = X0_value
