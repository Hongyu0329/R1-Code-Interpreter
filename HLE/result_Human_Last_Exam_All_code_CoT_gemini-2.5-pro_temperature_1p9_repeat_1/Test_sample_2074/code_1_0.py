# Step 1: Establish the values of the key parameters based on the problem analysis.
# The analysis shows that the complicated problem structure simplifies considerably.
# The integrals I1 and I2 defining matrices A and B_orig evaluate to 0.5 and -0.5.
# This leads to the conclusion that the space L consists of all real symmetric matrices.
# The image of L under the function f is the set of all symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices.

# Step 2: Formulate the expression for l(b).
# l(b) is the infimum over all SPD matrices S of an expression involving eigenvalues
# of S * C^{-1} * S + I, where C depends on b.
# Let mu_i be the positive eigenvalues of S * C^{-1} * S.
# The expression to be minimized simplifies to:
# min_k (k*mu_k + sum(mu_i for i > k)) + 101

# Step 3: Evaluate the infimum.
# The set of SPD matrices allows for scaling. By choosing S to be an SPD matrix
# with a very small norm (e.g., S = epsilon * I where epsilon is small), the
# eigenvalues mu_i can be made arbitrarily close to zero.
# Therefore, the term min_k(...) can be made arbitrarily close to 0.
# The infimum of this term is 0.
infimum_part = 0

# Step 4: Determine the value of l(b).
# l(b) is the value of the infimum part plus 101.
# This value is independent of the parameter b.
l_b_value = infimum_part + 101

# Step 5: Compute the specific values required.
l_half = l_b_value
l_neg_half = l_b_value

# Step 6: Calculate the final result.
# The problem asks for 6 * (l(1/2) + l(-1/2)).
val1 = 6
val2 = l_half
val3 = l_neg_half
final_result = val1 * (val2 + val3)

print("Based on the analysis, the function l(b) is a constant.")
print(f"l(1/2) = {val2}")
print(f"l(-1/2) = {val3}")
print("The final expression is 6 * (l(1/2) + l(-1/2))")
print(f"So we compute: {val1} * ({val2} + {val3}) = {final_result}")

# Final Answer
# print(f"<<<{final_result}>>>")
