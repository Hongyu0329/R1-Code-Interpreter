    print("4. To save the B1 stone, White's only option is to play at A1, connecting the two stones.")
    print("5. We must check if White's move at A1 is legal. Under standard Go rules, a 'suicide' move is illegal. A move is suicide if it leaves the newly placed stone's group with zero liberties, unless the move simultaneously captures one or more opponent stones.")
    print("6. If White plays at A1, the new White group at {A1, B1} is immediately surrounded by Black stones at A2, B2, and C1. This White group has zero liberties.")
    print("7. Does this move capture any Black stones? No. The large Black group still has an external liberty at A3, so it is not captured.")
    print("8. Conclusion for W@B1: Since the necessary follow-up move at A1 is an illegal suicide, White cannot save the B1 stone. Black will capture the B1 stone on the next turn, securing life. Therefore, the attack at B1 fails.")

    print("\nOther candidate moves (like A1 or B2) also fail for similar reasons.")
    print("  - W at B2 is immediately captured by B at B1.")
    print("  - W at A1 leads to the same illegal suicide situation as the W at B1 line.")
