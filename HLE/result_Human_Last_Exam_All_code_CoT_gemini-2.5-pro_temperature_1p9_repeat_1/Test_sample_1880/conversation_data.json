    "I will determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ by following a standard procedure from Galois theory. The steps involve checking for irreducibility, calculating the discriminant, analyzing the resolvent cubic polynomial, and finally performing a test to distinguish between the remaining possible Galois groups.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Check for irreducibility:** I will use Eisenstein's criterion to determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. An irreducible polynomial has a transitive Galois group.\n2.  **Calculate the discriminant:** For a quartic polynomial, the discriminant $\\Delta$ determines whether the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Analyze the resolvent cubic:** The factorability of a related cubic polynomial, the resolvent cubic, further narrows down the possible Galois groups. I will find its coefficients and test for rational roots.\n4.  **Distinguish the final case:** The results from the previous steps will reduce the possibilities to either the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) or the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4). A final test, based on the reducibility of the original polynomial over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, will determine the correct group.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the identified Galois group, I will state its order.\n\nThe following Python code carries out the necessary calculations for these steps and explains the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a non-negative integer is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    x = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return x * x == n\n\n# The polynomial is P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n# This is a depressed quartic of the form x^4 + px + q.\np = 8\nq = 14\n\nprint(f\"The polynomial is P(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 1: Check irreducibility.\")\nprint(\"We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2:\")\nprint(\"- The prime 2 divides the non-leading coefficients (the coefficients of x^2 and x^3 are 0, which are divisible by 2), the coefficient of x (8), and the constant term (14).\")\nprint(\"- The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient (1).\")\nprint(\"- The square of the prime, 2^2=4, does not divide the constant term 14.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers Q.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial.\")\n# For a quartic of the form x^4 + px + q, the discriminant is Delta = 256*q^3 - 27*p^4.\ndiscriminant = 256 * (q**3) - 27 * (p**4)\nprint(f\"The discriminant is Delta = 256 * ({q})^3 - 27 * ({p})^4\")\nprint(f\"Delta = 256 * {q**3} - 27 * {p**4} = {256 * q**3} - {27 * p**4} = {discriminant}.\")\n\nif is_perfect_square(discriminant):\n    print(\"The discriminant is a perfect square, so the Galois group is a subgroup of A_4.\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"The discriminant {discriminant} is not a perfect square of a rational number.\")\n    print(\"This means the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group A_4.\")\n    print(\"The possible transitive groups are S_4 (order 24), D_4 (dihedral group of order 8), or C_4 (cyclic group of order 4).\")\n\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 3: Form the resolvent cubic and check its reducibility.\")\n# The resolvent cubic for x^4 + px + q is y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0.\nrc_coeff_y = -4 * q\nrc_const = -(p**2)\nprint(f\"The resolvent cubic is g(y) = y^3 - 4*({q})y - ({p})^2 = 0\")\nprint(f\"This simplifies to g(y) = y^3 + ({rc_coeff_y})y + ({rc_const}) = 0.\")\n\n# We search for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.\n# Any rational root must be an integer divisor of the constant term -64.\nrational_root = None\ndivisors_of_rc_const = [i for i in range(1, abs(rc_const) + 1) if rc_const % i == 0]\npossible_roots = sorted(list(set(divisors_of_rc_const + [-x for x in divisors_of_rc_const])))\n\nfor r in possible_roots:\n    if r**3 + rc_coeff_y * r + rc_const == 0:\n        rational_root = r\n        break\n\nif rational_root is not None:\n    print(f\"The resolvent cubic has a rational root at y = {rational_root}.\")\n    print(\"The other two roots can be found to be irrational.
