# Step 1: Define the functions for the trajectory and entanglement echo.
# Based on the analysis of the physical system, the trajectory z1(t) and the
# entanglement echo y(t) have been determined to be:
# z1(t) = cos(t)
# y(t) = tan(2t) * sqrt(sec(2t))

# We need to evaluate (z1(t) / y(t))^2 at t = pi/8.

# Step 2: Define the specific time t.
t_val = np.pi / 8

# Step 3: Calculate the value of z1(t) at t = pi/8.
# The expression is z1(pi/8) = cos(pi/8).
z1_at_t = np.cos(t_val)

# Step 4: Calculate the value of y(t) at t = pi/8.
# The expression is y(pi/8) = tan(2*pi/8) * sqrt(sec(2*pi/8))
# y(pi/8) = tan(pi/4) * sqrt(sec(pi/4))
# tan(pi/4) = 1 and sec(pi/4) = sqrt(2)
# y(pi/8) = 1 * sqrt(sqrt(2)) = 2^(1/4)
y_at_t = np.tan(2 * t_val) * np.sqrt(1 / np.cos(2 * t_val))

# Step 5: Compute the final expression (z1(pi/8) / y(pi/8))^2
final_result = (z1_at_t / y_at_t)**2

# Step 6: Print the components of the equation and the final answer.
# This follows the request to output each number in the final equation.
print("The final result is obtained by calculating (z1(π/8) / y(π/8))^2.")
print(f"The value for the numerator, z1(π/8), is: {z1_at_t}")
print(f"The value for the denominator, y(π/8), is: {y_at_t}")
print(f"The final result is: {final_result}")

# For completeness, the exact symbolic answer is (√2 + 1)/4.
# The numerical value printed above is the evaluation of this expression.
exact_result = (np.sqrt(2) + 1) / 4
print(f"Note: The exact symbolic form of the answer is (√2 + 1)/4 ≈ {exact_result}")
