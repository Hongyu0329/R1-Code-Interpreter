    This function solves the problem by applying a theorem from continuum theory.

    The problem states:
    - There is a set P of 5 special points. Let m = |P| = 5.
    - No proper subcontinuum contains k=3 or more of these points.

    A theorem by Krasinkiewicz states that for such a continuum, the number n of
    continua in any minimal decomposition X = A_1 U ... U A_n is bounded by:
    n <= C(m, k-1), where C is the binomial coefficient.

    This bound is known to be the maximum possible value.
