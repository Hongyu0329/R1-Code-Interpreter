    Solves the user's request for a specific n=3 Mercer matrix.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Defines a known 3x3 3-nilpotent matrix with all non-zero integer entries.
    2. Calculates its "Popov Normal Form", interpreted as the Column Reduced Echelon Form.
    3. Computes the ratio of its logarithmic mu-infinity norm to its Frobenius norm.
    4. Calculates its largest immanant, assumed to be the permanent.
    5. Prints all results in a clear format.
