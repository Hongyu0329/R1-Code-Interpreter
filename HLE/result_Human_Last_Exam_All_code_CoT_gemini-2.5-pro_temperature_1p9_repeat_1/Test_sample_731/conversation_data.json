    "This problem requires finding the number of distinct subgroups of the form $G^k = \\{g^k | g \\in G\\}$ for the semidihedral group $G = SD_{512}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The group is the semidihedral group of order 512. The semidihedral group of order $2^n$ is denoted $SD_{2^n}$. Here, $2^n = 512$, so we can find $n$ by taking the logarithm base 2: $n = \\log_2(512) = 9$. The group is $SD_{2^9}$. The group has a presentation $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = e, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$. For $n=9$, the generator $r$ has an order of $2^{9-1} = 256$.\n\n2.  **Analyze Power Subgroups based on Exponent Parity:** The structure of the power subgroup $G^k$ depends critically on whether the integer exponent $k$ is even or odd.\n\n3.  **Case 1: $k$ is odd.** For any semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ where $n \\ge 3$, it is a known group-theoretic result that if the exponent $k$ is odd, the set of $k$-th powers of all elements is the group itself. That is, $G^k = G$. This means that all odd values of $k$ (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...) produce the same, single power subgroup: the group $G$ itself.\n\n4.  **Case 2: $k$ is even.** If the exponent $k$ is even, the power subgroup $G^k$ collapses into a cyclic subgroup generated by a power of $r$. Specifically, $G^k = \\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 2^{n-1})} \\rangle$. We need to find how many unique subgroups this formula can generate.\n    *   Since $k$ is even, the greatest common divisor (gcd) with $2^{n-1}$ must be an even number.\n    *   For $n=9$, $2^{n-1}=256$. We are looking for subgroups $\\langle r^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$ and $k$ is even.\n    *   This means $d$ must be an even divisor of 256. The divisors of 256 are powers of 2: $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$.\n    *   The even divisors are $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\\}$. Each of these values of $d$ gives a distinct cyclic subgroup: $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{e\\}$.\n    *   There are 8 such distinct subgroups. In general, for $SD_{2^n}$, there are $n-1$ such subgroups.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** By summing the number of unique subgroups from both cases, we get the total number of power subgroups.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_order = 512\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the group parameter n for SD_{2^n}\n    n = int(math.log2(group_order))\n    order_of_r = 2**(n - 1)\n\n    print(f\"The group is the semidihedral group G = SD_{group_order}, which is of the form SD_{{2^n}} with n = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The cyclic generator 'r' in this group has order 2^({n}-1) = {order_of_r}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Count subgroups from odd exponents\n    print(\"Case 1: The exponent k is odd.\")\n    print(\"For any odd k, the power subgroup G^k is the entire group G.\")\n    num_from_odd_k = 1\n    print(f\"This gives {num_from_odd_k} unique subgroup (G itself).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Count subgroups from even exponents\n    print(\"Case 2: The exponent k is even.\")\n    print(\"For any even k, G^k is a cyclic subgroup <r^d>, where d is an even divisor of\", order_of_r)\n    # The number of such subgroups is the number of even divisors of 2^(n-1).\n    # These are 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^(n-1).\n    num_from_even_k = n - 1\n    print(f\"The distinct subgroups correspond to d = 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^({n-1}).\")\n    print(f\"This gives {num_from_even_k} unique cyclic subgroups.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the total\n    total = num_from_odd_k + num_from_even_k\n    print(\"The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases:\")\n    print(f\"Total = {num_from_odd_k} (from odd exponents) + {num_from_even_k} (from even exponents) = {total}\")\n\ncount_power_subgroups()\n<<<9>>>\n```"
