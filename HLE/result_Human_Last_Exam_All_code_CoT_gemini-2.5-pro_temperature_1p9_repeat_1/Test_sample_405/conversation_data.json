    "Here is my plan to solve the problem.\nFirst, I will identify the common allotropes of phosphorus and their distinct observable colors. Scientific sources indicate the following:\n1.  **White Phosphorus:** A waxy solid that is typically white but often appears pale **yellow** due to impurities or conversion to red phosphorus upon exposure to light. So we have two colors here: **white** and **yellow**.\n2.  **Red Phosphorus:** An amorphous or crystalline solid that is **red** in color.\n3.  **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this is a crystalline form that is **violet**.\n4.  **Black Phosphorus:** The most stable form, which has a layered structure similar to graphite and appears **black**.\n\nThis gives a total of five distinct colors (white, yellow, red, violet, and black).\n\nNext, I will write a Python script to present this information. The script will:\n1.  Define a list containing the names of these five colors.\n2.  Count the number of items in the list.\n3.  Construct and print a simple summation equation, as requested, to show how the final count is derived. Each color will be represented by the number 1 in the sum.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the number of observable colors \n    in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The distinct observable colors are derived from the main allotropes:\n    # - White Phosphorus (can appear white or yellow)\n    # - Red Phosphorus (is red)\n    # - Violet Phosphorus (is violet)\n    # - Black Phosphorus (is black)\n    colors = [\"White\", \"Yellow\", \"Red\", \"Violet\", \"Black\"]\n    \n    # Get the total count of the colors.\n    total_count = len(colors)\n    \n    print(f\"The distinct colors that can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus are: {', '.join(colors)}.\")\n    \n    # Create the left side of the equation, representing each color as '1'.\n    equation_left_side = \" + \".join(['1'] * total_count)\n    \n    # Print the final equation showing each number being added to get the total.\n    print(\"The summation to find the total number of colors is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_left_side} = {total_count}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<5>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
