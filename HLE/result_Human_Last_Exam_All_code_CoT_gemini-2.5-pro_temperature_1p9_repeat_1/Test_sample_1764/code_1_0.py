    This function demonstrates that it's possible for the number of isometric embeddings
    of a finite ultrametric space into a Banach space to be zero.

    We test this by trying to embed a specific 3-point ultrametric space (an equilateral
    triangle with side length 1) into the Banach space of real numbers (R).

    An embedding requires finding three points x1, x2, x3 in R such that the distance
    between any two is exactly 1.
