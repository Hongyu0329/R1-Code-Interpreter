    "Of course. Since you did not specify a coding task, I will provide a sample script that adheres to your formatting requirements.\n\nMy plan is to create a simple Python script that demonstrates the requested functionality. I will define two variables with numeric values, perform a simple calculation (addition), and then print the complete equation, showing each number involved, as you've instructed.\n\nAfter providing the code, I will answer your question about Curt Querner's self-portrait.\n\n```python\n# Define two numbers for a sample equation.\n# Let's use the year from your question and another number.\nyear = 1933\nanother_number = 25\n\n# Perform a simple addition\nresult = year + another_number\n\n# Print the final equation, showing each number as requested.\nprint(f\"A sample equation: {year} + {another_number} = {result}\")\n\n# Now, for the answer to your question:\n# In his 1933 self-portrait painted after escaping the Gestapo,\n# Curt Querner holds a spatula (or palette knife).\n# This object, a simple tool of his trade, symbolizes his defiance\n# and insistence on his identity as a painter,\n# a profession the Nazis had labeled as \"degenerate.\"\n# It represents his resistance through art.\n\nprint(\"\\nAnswer to the trivia question: In the painting, he holds a spatula.\")\n```\n<<<A spatula (or palette knife)>>>"
