# Define two numbers for a sample equation.
# Let's use the year from your question and another number.
year = 1933
another_number = 25

# Perform a simple addition
result = year + another_number

# Print the final equation, showing each number as requested.
print(f"A sample equation: {year} + {another_number} = {result}")

# Now, for the answer to your question:
# In his 1933 self-portrait painted after escaping the Gestapo,
# Curt Querner holds a spatula (or palette knife).
# This object, a simple tool of his trade, symbolizes his defiance
# and insistence on his identity as a painter,
# a profession the Nazis had labeled as "degenerate."
# It represents his resistance through art.
