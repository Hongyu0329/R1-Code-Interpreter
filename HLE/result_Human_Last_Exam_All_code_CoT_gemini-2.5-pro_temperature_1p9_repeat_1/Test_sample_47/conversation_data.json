    "To solve this problem, we can use a well-established formula for finding the expected number of trials to see a specific sequence for the first time. This method relies on analyzing the \"overlaps\" within the sequence, where a prefix of the sequence is also a suffix.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Problem:** We have an alphabet of `n = 26` letters. We want to find the expected number of letters drawn until the sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"` appears.\n2.  **Identify the Formula:** The expected time `E` can be calculated as the sum of `n^k` for all values of `k` (from 1 to the length of the sequence `L`) where the prefix of length `k` is identical to the suffix of length `k`.\n    `E = Î£ (n^k)` for `k` in `{1, ..., L}` where `S[1...k] == S[L-k+1...L]`.\n3.  **Find Overlaps in \"TENETENET\":** We will systematically check for overlaps in the target sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"` (`L=9`, `n=26`).\n    *   **k=1**: Prefix \"T\" == Suffix \"T\". This is an overlap.\n    *   **k=2**: Prefix \"TE\" != Suffix \"ET\". No overlap.\n    *   **k=3**: Prefix \"TEN\" != Suffix \"NET\". No overlap.\n    *   **k=4**: Prefix \"TENE\" != Suffix \"ENET\". No overlap.\n    *   **k=5**: Prefix \"TENET\" == Suffix \"TENET\". This is an overlap.\n    *   **k=6**: Prefix \"TENETE\" != Suffix \"ETENET\". No overlap.\n    *   **k=7**: Prefix \"TENETEN\" == Suffix \"TENETEN\". This is an overlap.\n    *   **k=8**: Prefix \"TENETENE\" != Suffix \"ENETENET\". No overlap.\n    *   **k=9**: The full sequence \"TENETENET\" is always an overlap with itself.\n4.  **Calculate the Expected Time:** Based on the overlaps found, the formula for the expected time `E` is:\n    `E = 26^9 + 26^7 + 26^5 + 26^1`.\n5.  **Write Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation. The script will find the overlapping lengths, construct the equation as a string, and then compute the final numerical result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time until a sequence appears from a random source.\n\n    The method is based on identifying overlaps between prefixes and suffixes\n    of the target sequence.
