    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to understand the properties of the conductor $d=53599$. I will start by finding its prime factorization.\n2.  The problem asks for the number of *primitive* Dirichlet characters of a specific *conductor* $d$ and *order* 6. For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$, a character $\\chi$ is a primitive character with conductor $d$ if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-trivial character modulo the prime factor $p_i$.\n3.  The order of the composite character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_i$. Let $g_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$. We need to find the number of character tuples $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_k)$ such that all $\\chi_i$ are non-trivial and $\\text{lcm}(g_1, \\dots, g_k) = 6$.\n4.  For the lcm to be 6, each individual order $g_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Since the characters $\\chi_i$ must be non-trivial, their orders $g_i$ must be greater than 1. So, the possible orders for each component are $g_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n5.  The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of a specific order $g$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(g)$, provided that $g$ divides $p-1$. I will check this condition for each prime factor of $d$ and for each potential order $g_i \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n6.  The total number of characters is the sum of the products of the number of choices for each component. Specifically, it's $\\sum \\prod_{i=1}^k \\phi(g_i)$, summed over all tuples of orders $(g_1, \\dots, g_k)$ that satisfy the conditions.\n7.  I will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to simplify the counting. The total number of primitive characters with order 6 will be:\n    (Total primitive characters with order dividing 6) - (Total primitive characters with order strictly dividing 6).\n    The orders that strictly divide 6 are 1, 2, and 3. Since the characters are non-trivial, the order cannot be 1. So, we subtract the counts for characters of order 2 and 3.\n8.  I will implement the necessary helper functions in Python: one for prime factorization and one for Euler's totient function, $\\phi$.\n9.  Finally, I will combine all these steps in a Python script to calculate and print the final answer, showing the values used in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factorize(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a list of prime factors of a positive integer n.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            while temp_n % d == 0:\n                temp_n //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        factors.append(temp_n)\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p_factors = set(prime_factorize(n))\n    for p in p_factors:\n        result -= result // p\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d and order g.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"The conductor is d = {d} and the required order is g = {g}.\\n\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Factorize the conductor d.\")\n    prime_factors = prime_factorize(d)\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of d = {d} is: {' * '.join(map(str, prime_factors))}.\")\n    print(\"Since d is square-free, a primitive character of conductor d is a product of non-trivial characters modulo each prime factor.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Determine the constraints on the orders of component characters.\")\n    print(f\"Let chi = chi_1 * chi_2 * chi_3 * chi_4 be the character, where chi_i is a character mod {prime_factors[i-1]}.\")\n    print(f\"The order of chi is lcm(ord(chi_1), ord(chi_2), ord(chi_3), ord(chi_4)), which must be {g}.\")\n    print(f\"This implies that for each i, ord(chi_i) must be a divisor of {g}.
