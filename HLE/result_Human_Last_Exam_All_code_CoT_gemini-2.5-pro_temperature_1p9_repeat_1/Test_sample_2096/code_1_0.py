# The solution to the riddle is the word "illiterate".
# This is derived from two key clues:
#
# 1. "being X was considered shameful for the Pope": Pope Paul II was
#    criticized by his contemporary enemies as being uncultured and
#    poorly educated, so being "illiterate" would have been considered shameful.
#
# 2. "'X' was written in the 1960s": This is a reference to Joseph Heller's
#    1961 novel "Catch-22". In the book, there is a famous joke where
#    it is stated that the historical figure Washington Irving was "illiterate".
#    Thus, the word 'illiterate' was famously 'written' in a work from the 1960s.
