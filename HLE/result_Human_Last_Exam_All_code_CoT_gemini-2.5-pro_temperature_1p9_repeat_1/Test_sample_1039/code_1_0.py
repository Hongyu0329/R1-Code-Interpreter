    The calculation is based on the properties of the Poincare polynomial for B_n,

    The variance of the length distribution can be found by summing the variances
    of the distributions associated with each factor [2i]_q.
    The variance for a uniform distribution on {0, 1, ..., k-1} is (k^2-1)/12.
