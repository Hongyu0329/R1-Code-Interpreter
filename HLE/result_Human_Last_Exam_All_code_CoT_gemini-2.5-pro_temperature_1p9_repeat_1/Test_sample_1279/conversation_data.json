    "Of course. Here is the solution to calculate the sum of symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Diagrams**: First, we need to determine the distinct, connected, second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory. A second-order diagram has two vertices, and each vertex corresponds to a $\\phi^4$ interaction, meaning it has four lines (legs) attached.\n    *   **Diagram 1 (The \"Dumbbell\" diagram)**: This diagram features a loop at each of the two vertices, with two propagators connecting the vertices.\n    *   **Diagram 2 (The \"Setting Sun\" diagram)**: This diagram consists of the two vertices connected by four distinct propagators.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Symmetry Factor (S)**: The symmetry factor of a Feynman diagram is the order of its automorphism group. It represents the number of permutations of its internal vertices and propagators that leave the diagram topologically unchanged. We will calculate this for each diagram.\n\n3.  **Sum the Factors**: Finally, we will sum the individual symmetry factors to get the total.\n\n### Calculation:\n\n*   **For the \"Dumbbell\" Diagram (S₁):**\n    *   We can swap the two identical vertices: factor of 2.\n    *   We can swap the two identical propagators connecting the vertices: factor of 2.\n    *   Each loop (a propagator connecting a vertex to itself) has a symmetry from swapping its two connections to the vertex: factor of 2 for each loop.\n    *   Thus, $S_1 = 2 (\\text{vertices}) \\times 2 (\\text{propagators}) \\times 2 (\\text{loop 1}) \\times 2 (\\text{loop 2}) = 16$.\n\n*   **For the \"Setting Sun\" Diagram (S₂):**\n    *   We can swap the two identical vertices: factor of 2.\n    *   We can permute the four identical propagators connecting the vertices in any way: factor of $4! = 24$.\n    *   Thus, $S_2 = 2 (\\text{vertices}) \\times 4! (\\text{propagators}) = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n*   **Total Sum:**\n    *   $S_{total} = S_1 + S_2 = 16 + 48 = 64$.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations and prints the result step by step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factors for the two second-order vacuum bubble diagrams\n    in phi^4 theory and prints the sum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Diagram 1: The \"Dumbbell\" diagram ---\n    # Symmetries:\n    # 1.
