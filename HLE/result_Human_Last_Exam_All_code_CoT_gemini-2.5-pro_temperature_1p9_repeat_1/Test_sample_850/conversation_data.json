    "This is an interesting question that touches on the fundamental principles of crystal optics and symmetry. Let's break down the logic.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Define the Key Terms:**\n    *   **Optical Activity:** The ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. A fundamental requirement for a crystal to be optically active is that it must be **chiral**.\n    *   **Chiral Crystal Class:** A crystal class is chiral if it lacks any improper rotation axes (Symmetry elements of the second kind). This includes a center of inversion (i or -1) and mirror planes (m). There are 11 chiral crystal classes.\n    *   **Achiral Crystal Class:** A crystal class that is *not* chiral. It must contain at least one mirror plane or a center of inversion. There are 21 achiral crystal classes.\n    *   **Non-Polar Crystal Class:** A crystal class that has a center of inversion (centrosymmetric). The presence of an inversion center means the crystal cannot have a net dipole moment and is therefore non-polar. There are 11 such centrosymmetric (and thus non-polar) classes.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Conditions:**\n    *   The question asks for crystal classes that are **achiral** AND **optically active**.\n    *   As defined above, optical activity requires chirality. Achirality is the opposite of chirality.\n    *   Therefore, these two conditions are mutually exclusive. A crystal cannot be both chiral and achiral at the same time.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   There are no crystal classes that are achiral and optically active. The premise of the question contains a contradiction.\n\nI will provide a Python script that defines the sets for each property (achiral, non-polar, optically active) and demonstrates that there is no intersection between them, explaining the reason.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the 32 crystal classes to find those that are achiral, non-polar,\n    and optically active, and explains the crystallographic principles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 11 Chiral (and therefore Optically Active) crystal classes\n    # They lack mirror planes and an inversion center.\n    optically_active_classes = {\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"6\", \"222\", \"32\", \"422\", \"622\", \"23\", \"432\"}\n\n    # The 21 Achiral crystal classes are all other classes.\n    # They have at least one mirror plane or an inversion center.\n    achiral_classes = {\n        \"-1\", \"m\", \"2/m\", \"mm2\", \"mmm\",\n        \"-4\", \"4/m\", \"4mm\", \"-42m\", \"4/mmm\",\n        \"-3\", \"3m\", \"-3m\",\n        \"-6\", \"6/m\", \"6mm\", \"-6m2\", \"6/mmm\",\n        \"m-3\", \"-43m\", \"m-3m\"\n    }\n\n    # The 11 Non-Polar (centrosymmetric) classes have a center of inversion.\n    non_polar_classes = {\"-1\", \"2/m\", \"mmm\", \"4/m\", \"-3\", \"-3m\", \"6/m\", \"4/mmm\", \"6/mmm\", \"m-3\", \"m-3m\"}\n\n    # Find the intersection of all three requested properties\n    result_set = achiral_classes.intersection(non_polar_classes, optically_active_classes)\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the crystal classes based on the following principles:\")\n    print(\"1.
