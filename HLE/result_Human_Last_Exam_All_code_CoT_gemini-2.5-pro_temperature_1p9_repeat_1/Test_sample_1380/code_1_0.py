    # The question is about the physical process Louis Bachelier, a student of Henri Poincaré,
    # found to be mathematically identical to how stock option probabilities spread over time.
    # His 1900 thesis, "Théorie de la spéculation" (Theory of Speculation), modeled price
    # fluctuations using a random walk.

    # This mathematical model is identical to the one describing the random movement of
    # particles suspended in a fluid (e.g., pollen in water or smoke in air), a
    # phenomenon observed by Robert Brown.

    # Bachelier's discovery of this mathematical equivalence for finance was groundbreaking.
    # He did not name his financial model *after* the phenomenon, as his work on the
    # mathematics of random walks in finance (1900) predated Albert Einstein's famous
    # physical explanation of Brownian motion (1905). However, the physical process
    # is indeed Brownian motion.
