    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that calculates the index of the given boundary-value problem.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the system dimension (n):** The dimension of the system, `n`, is the number of unknown functions in the vector `x(t)`. Based on the problem description `x(t) = (x_{1}(t), ..., x_{2024}(t))`, we can determine that `n = 2024`.\n2.  **Identify the number of independent boundary conditions (m):** The problem provides six boundary conditions. To find the number of linearly independent conditions, we can represent them as rows in a matrix and then calculate the rank of that matrix. The rank will give us `m`. By simple observation, several conditions related to `x_2` are just multiples of each other (`x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`). The distinct conditions involve `x_1`, `x_2`, and `x_{2024}`. We expect `m = 3`. We will use Python's `numpy` library to confirm this programmatically.\n3.  **Calculate the Index:** The index of a linear boundary-value problem is defined as the dimension of the system minus the number of independent boundary conditions. The formula is `index = n - m`.\n4.  **Output the result:** The final script will print the values for `n` and `m`, the calculation `n - m = index`, and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_bvp_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the index of the given boundary-value problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system, n.\n    # The system is defined by x(t) = (x_1(t), ..., x_2024(t)).\n    # This means the system has 2024 unknown functions.\n    # The value 202000 in the matrix A is a distractor and inconsistent with the rest of the problem.\n    n = 2024\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions, m.\n    # We represent the 6 given conditions as rows in a matrix K of size 6x(2*n).\n    # The rank of this matrix gives the number of linearly independent conditions.\n    # Columns 0 to n-1 correspond to x_i(0)\n    # Columns n to 2n-1 correspond to x_i(T)\n    \n    # Initialize a 6 x (2*n) zero matrix\n    K = np.zeros((6, 2 * n))\n    \n    # Condition 1: x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0\n    # Affects x_1(0) (col 0) and x_1(T) (col n)\n    K[0, 0] = -1\n    K[0, n] = 1\n    \n    # Condition 2: x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0\n    # Affects x_2(0) (col 1) and x_2(T) (col n+1)\n    K[1, 1] = -1\n    K[1, n + 1] = 1\n    \n    # Condition 3: 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0\n    K[2, 1] = -5\n    K[2, n + 1] = 5\n    \n    # Condition 4: 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0\n    K[3, 1] = -100\n    K[3, n + 1] = 100\n    \n    # Condition 5: 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0\n    K[4, 1] = 1000\n    K[4, n + 1] = -1000\n    \n    # Condition 6: 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0\n    # Affects x_2024(0) (col n-1) and x_2024(T) (col 2n-1)\n    K[5, n - 1] = -100\n    K[5, 2 * n - 1] = 100\n    \n    # Calculate the rank of the coefficient matrix K\n    m = np.linalg.matrix_rank(K)\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the index of the problem.\n    # The index is n - m.\n    index = n - int(m)\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final equation.\n    print(\"Finding the index of the boundary-value problem:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"1.
