    This function calculates the number of distinct paths from one end of the line
    segment to the other based on a combinatorial interpretation.

    The core of the problem is determining the number of ways to travel between
    the two intersection points (I1 and I2) of the line and the circle.
    There are three fundamental segments connecting I1 and I2: the line segment (L),
    the upper arc (U), and the lower arc (D).

    We count the number of 'trails' (paths that don't reuse segments) from I1 to I2.
    To get from I1 to I2, the path must consist of an odd number of segments.
