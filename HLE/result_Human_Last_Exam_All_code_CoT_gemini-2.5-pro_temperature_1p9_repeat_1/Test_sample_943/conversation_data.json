    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the specific tensor given in the problem. The formula for the tensor is a known one in the field of combinatorics and theoretical computer science.\n2.  I will then state the known result for the slice rank of this tensor. A key theorem by Kopparty, Lovett, and Wang provides an exact formula for the slice rank.\n3.  Next, I will analyze the asymptotic behavior of this slice rank formula for large values of $n$. This involves identifying the dominant term that dictates the exponential growth rate.\n4.  I will compare this derived growth rate with the expression provided in the problem statement, which is $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$.\n5.  By equating the bases of the exponential growth from the known formula and the given expression, I will form an equation in terms of $K$.\n6.  Finally, I will solve this equation to find the value of $K$. The final python code will walk through the mathematical reasoning and print the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks to find the value of K in the expression for the slice rank of a specific tensor.\n# Let's break down the reasoning.\n\n# Step 1: Identify the tensor and its slice rank.\n# The tensor is a function T from {0, 1}^n x {0, 1}^n x {0, 1}^n to C, defined as:\n# T(x, y, z) = product_{i=1 to n}(x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1\n# A significant result in combinatorics, from a paper by Kopparty, Lovett, and Wang (2017),\n# states that the slice rank of this tensor over any field with characteristic not equal to 2 or 3\n# (which includes the complex numbers C) is exactly 3^n - 2^n.\n\n# Step 2: Determine the asymptotic growth of the slice rank.\n# The slice rank is SR = 3^n - 2^n.\n# For large n, we can analyze the behavior of this expression.\n# We can factor out the dominant term, 3^n:\n# SR = 3^n * (1 - (2/3)^n)\n# As n approaches infinity, the term (2/3)^n approaches 0, so (1 - (2/3)^n) approaches 1.\n# This means the expression grows asymptotically as 3^n. The (1 - (2/3)^n) factor\n# is absorbed by the sub-exponential term e^{o(n)} in the given formula.\n\n# Step 3: Compare with the given slice rank expression.\n# The problem states that the slice rank is given by the formula (3 / 2^K)^n * e^{o(n)}.\n# The base of the exponential growth in this formula is (3 / 2^K).\n\n# Step 4: Formulate and solve the equation for K.\n# By equating the base of the exponential growth from our analysis with the one from the problem statement,\n# we get the following equation.\n# The left-hand side is the base from our analysis of the known formula.\n# The right-hand side is the base from the problem's formula.\nbase_from_analysis = 3\nnumerator_from_problem = 3\ndenominator_base_from_problem = 2\n\nprint(\"The asymptotic growth rate of the slice rank (3^n - 2^n) is 3^n.\")\nprint(\"The problem states the slice rank's growth rate is (3 / 2^K)^n.\")\nprint(\"By equating the bases of the exponential growth, we get the equation:\")\nprint(f\"{base_from_analysis} = {numerator_from_problem} / ({denominator_base_from_problem}^K)\")\n\n# Step 5: Solve for K.\n# From the equation 3 = 3 / (2^K), we can solve for K.\n# Multiplying both sides by 2^K gives:\n# 3 * 2^K = 3\n# Dividing by 3 gives:\n# 2^K = 1\n# The only real number K for which 2^K = 1 is 0.\nK = 0\nprint(\"\\nSolving the equation for K:\")\nprint(f\"  {denominator_base_from_problem}^K = {numerator_from_problem} / {base_from_analysis}\")\nprint(f\"  {denominator_base_from_problem}^K = 1\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, K must be {K}.\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe final value found for K is:\")\nprint(K)\n```\n<<<0>>>"
