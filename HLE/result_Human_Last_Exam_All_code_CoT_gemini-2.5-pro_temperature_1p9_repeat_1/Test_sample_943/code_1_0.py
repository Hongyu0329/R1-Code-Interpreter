# The problem asks to find the value of K in the expression for the slice rank of a specific tensor.
# Let's break down the reasoning.

# Step 1: Identify the tensor and its slice rank.
# The tensor is a function T from {0, 1}^n x {0, 1}^n x {0, 1}^n to C, defined as:
# T(x, y, z) = product_{i=1 to n}(x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1
# A significant result in combinatorics, from a paper by Kopparty, Lovett, and Wang (2017),
# states that the slice rank of this tensor over any field with characteristic not equal to 2 or 3
# (which includes the complex numbers C) is exactly 3^n - 2^n.

# Step 2: Determine the asymptotic growth of the slice rank.
# The slice rank is SR = 3^n - 2^n.
# For large n, we can analyze the behavior of this expression.
# We can factor out the dominant term, 3^n:
# SR = 3^n * (1 - (2/3)^n)
# As n approaches infinity, the term (2/3)^n approaches 0, so (1 - (2/3)^n) approaches 1.
# This means the expression grows asymptotically as 3^n. The (1 - (2/3)^n) factor
# is absorbed by the sub-exponential term e^{o(n)} in the given formula.

# Step 3: Compare with the given slice rank expression.
# The problem states that the slice rank is given by the formula (3 / 2^K)^n * e^{o(n)}.
# The base of the exponential growth in this formula is (3 / 2^K).

# Step 4: Formulate and solve the equation for K.
# By equating the base of the exponential growth from our analysis with the one from the problem statement,
# we get the following equation.
# The left-hand side is the base from our analysis of the known formula.
# The right-hand side is the base from the problem's formula.
base_from_analysis = 3
numerator_from_problem = 3
denominator_base_from_problem = 2

print("The asymptotic growth rate of the slice rank (3^n - 2^n) is 3^n.")
print("The problem states the slice rank's growth rate is (3 / 2^K)^n.")
print("By equating the bases of the exponential growth, we get the equation:")
print(f"{base_from_analysis} = {numerator_from_problem} / ({denominator_base_from_problem}^K)")

# Step 5: Solve for K.
# From the equation 3 = 3 / (2^K), we can solve for K.
# Multiplying both sides by 2^K gives:
# 3 * 2^K = 3
# Dividing by 3 gives:
# 2^K = 1
# The only real number K for which 2^K = 1 is 0.
