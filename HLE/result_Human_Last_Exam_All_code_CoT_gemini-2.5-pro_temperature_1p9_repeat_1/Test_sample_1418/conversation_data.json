    "To determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, we will first construct the field extension $L$ and then use a computational algebra system (SageMath) to compute its Galois group.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Define the base field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a standard biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$, and its Galois group over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the Klein four-group, $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n2.  Define the element $\\gamma = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$, which lies in $K$.\n3.  Construct the field $L$ by adjoining the square root of $\\gamma$ to $K$. This means $L = K(\\sqrt{\\gamma})$.\n4.  We must check if $\\gamma$ is a perfect square in $K$. If it is, then $L=K$ and the Galois group is $C_2 \\times C_2$. A calculation shows it is not a square, so $[L:K]=2$ and $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]=[L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}]=2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n5.  We will determine the structure of the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$, which is a group of order 8. The possible groups are $C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, the dihedral group $D_4$, and the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n6.  The field $L$ is a Galois extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can compute its Galois group using SageMath.\n\nThe Python code below uses SageMath to perform these steps.\n\n```python\n# This code is intended to be run in a SageMath environment.\nfrom sage.all import *\n\n# 1. Define the base field K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) as a tower of extensions.\n# K1 = Q(sqrt(2))\nK1.<r2> = NumberField(x^2 - 2, 'r2')\n# K = K1(sqrt(3)) = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\nK.<r3> = K1.extension(x^2 - 3, 'r3')\n\n# 2. Define the element gamma in K\ngamma = (2 + r2) * (3 + r3)\n\n# 3. Check if gamma is a square in K.\n# If it were, the extension would be of degree 4, not 8.\nis_sq = gamma.is_square()\nprint(f\"Is gamma = (2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3)) a square in Q(sqrt(2),sqrt(3))? {is_sq}\")\nif is_sq:\n    # This part should not be executed based on manual verification\n    G = K.galois_group()\n    print(f\"The Galois Group of Q(sqrt(2),sqrt(3))/Q is: {G.structure_description()}\")\nelse:\n    # 4. Construct the field L by adjoining sqrt(gamma) to K\n    L.<alpha> = K.extension(x^2 - gamma, 'alpha')\n    print(f\"The degree of the extension L/Q is: {L.absolute_degree()}\")\n\n    # 5. Compute the Galois group of the absolute field L over Q.\n    G = L.galois_group()\n\n    # 6. Print the structure of the Galois Group\n    # The group is identified by its ID in the PARI/GAP database of small groups.\n    # For order 8: [8,1]=C8, [8,2]=C4xC2, [8,3]=C2x C2xC2, [8,4]=D4, [8,5]=Q8\n    group_id = G.group_id()\n    description = G.structure_description()\n    \n    print(f\"The Galois group G = Gal(L/Q) has order {G.order()}.\")\n    print(f\"Its PARI/GAP ID is: [{G.order()}, {group_id[1]}]\")\n    print(f\"The structure of the group is: {description}\")\n\n    if description == 'D(4)': # D(4) is Dihedral group of order 8\n      group_name = \"the Dihedral group D_4\"\n    elif description == 'Q_8': # For Quaternion group\n      group_name = \"the Quaternion group Q_8\"\n    else:\n      group_name = description\n      \n    print(f\"Conclusion: The Galois Group is isomorphic to {group_name}.\")\n\n```\n<<<the Dihedral group D_4>>>"
