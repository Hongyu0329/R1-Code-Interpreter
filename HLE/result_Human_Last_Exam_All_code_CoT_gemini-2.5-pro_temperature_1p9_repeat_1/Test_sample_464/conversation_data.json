    "Yes, if a Schwartz function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has all its moments $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx$ equal to zero for all non-negative integers $k$, then the function $f$ must be identically zero.\n\nMy plan is to prove this using the properties of the Fourier transform. The core of the argument is to establish a connection between the moments of a function $f(x)$ and the derivatives of its Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, evaluated at the origin ($\\xi=0$). Once this relationship is established, I will argue that the condition of all moments being zero implies that the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ must be the zero function. Finally, by the properties of the Fourier transform, if $\\hat{f}$ is zero, then $f$ must also be zero.\n\nThe following Python script uses the symbolic mathematics library `sympy` to derive and display the crucial relationship between moments and the Fourier transform. It then prints a step-by-step summary of the logical proof that leads to the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import Function, Symbol, integrate, oo, pi, I, diff\n\ndef solve_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the mathematical relationship at the heart of the problem.\n    It shows that the k-th derivative of the Fourier Transform at the origin\n    is proportional to the k-th moment of the original function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define mathematical symbols\n    x = Symbol('x')\n    xi = Symbol('xi')\n\n    # The Fourier Transform of a function f(x) is defined as:\n    # F(xi) = Integral from -inf to inf of f(x) * exp(-2*pi*i*x*xi) dx\n    #\n    # The k-th moment of a function f(x) is defined as:\n    # M_k   = Integral from -inf to inf of x^k * f(x) dx\n\n    # By differentiating the Fourier transform expression with respect to xi,\n    # we can establish a relationship.\n    # d^k/d(xi)^k [F(xi)] = Integral( d^k/d(xi)^k [f(x) * exp(-2*pi*i*x*xi)] dx )\n    #                     = Integral( f(x) * (-2*pi*i*x)^k * exp(-2*pi*i*x*xi) dx )\n    #\n    # Evaluating at xi = 0, the exponential term becomes 1:\n    # d^k/d(xi)^k [F(xi)] |_(xi=0) = Integral( f(x) * (-2*pi*i*x)^k dx )\n    #                              = (-2*pi*i)^k * Integral( x^k * f(x) dx )\n    #                              = (-2*pi*i)^k * M_k\n\n    print(\"This script explains why a Schwartz function with all zero moments must be zero.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"The key is the relationship between a function's moments (M_k) and the derivatives\")\n    print(\"of its Fourier transform (F(xi)) at the origin.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe general relationship for the k-th derivative is:\")\n\n    # Print the final equation clearly, showing the numbers involved.\n    print(\"\\n  d^k/d(xi)^k [F(xi)] |_(xi=0)  =  (-2*pi*i)^k * M_k\\n\")\n\n    print(\"where:\")\n    print(\"  F(xi) = The Fourier Transform of f(x)\")\n    print(\"  M_k   = The k-th moment of f(x)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(\"\\nArgument for why f(x) must be zero:\")\n    print(\"1.
