    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  I will start by identifying the properties of the Feynman diagrams for the specified theory, which is an interacting scalar field theory. I will assume the most common type, a **ϕ⁴ (phi-four) theory**, where each interaction vertex connects four lines.\n2.  I will use two fundamental formulas that relate the key components of a Feynman diagram:\n    *   The number of vertices (V)\n    *   The number of internal lines (I, also called propagators)\n    *   The number of external lines (E, for incoming/outgoing particles)\n    *   The number of loops (L)\n3.  The first formula is a general topological relation: `L = I - V + 1`.\n4.  The second formula relates the number of lines to the number of vertices for a ϕ⁴ theory: `4 * V = 2 * I + E`.\n5.  I will set the number of loops `L = 2` as required by the question and solve these two equations algebraically to express the number of vertices `V` in terms of the number of external lines `E`.\n6.  To find the *minimum* number of vertices, I will determine the minimum possible value for `E`. Feynman diagrams can have zero external lines (`E=0`); these are known as \"vacuum diagrams.\"\n7.  By substituting `E=0` into the derived equation, I will calculate the minimum value for `V`. The Python code will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for a phi-4 interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The number of loops (L) is given.\n    L = 2\n    \n    print(\"This program calculates the minimum number of vertices (V) for a two-loop Feynman diagram.\")\n    print(\"We assume a phi-4 scalar field theory, where each vertex has 4 lines.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Explain the two fundamental equations\n    print(\"We start with two key equations:\")\n    print(\"1.
