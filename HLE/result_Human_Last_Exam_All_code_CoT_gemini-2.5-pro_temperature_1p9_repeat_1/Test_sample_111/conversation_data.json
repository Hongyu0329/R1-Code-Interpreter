    "To answer this question, we need to correlate the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death with the known whereabouts of Geoffrey Chaucer during that time.\n\n1.  **Find the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death:** Historical records show she died on September 12, 1368, likely from the plague.\n2.  **Determine Chaucer's location in 1368:** By 1367, Chaucer was an esquire (`valettus` or `esquier`) in the household of King Edward III of England. Records from this period, including royal annuities and liveries, place him in England, serving the crown. His famous elegy, *The Book of the Duchess*, was written in her memory, strongly suggesting he was part of the English court circle at the time of her death. His major diplomatic trips to the continent, particularly Italy, occurred a few years later (starting in 1372).\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on historical records of his service to the English king, Chaucer was in England when Blanche of Lancaster died in 1368.\n\nHere is a Python script to present these facts.\n\n```python\ndef find_chaucers_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines Geoffrey Chaucer's location at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Establish the key date.\n    year_of_death_blanche = 1368\n\n    # Step 2: Establish Chaucer's known status and location during that period.\n    chaucers_role = \"Esquire in the royal household of King Edward III\"\n    chaucers_location = \"England\"\n    supporting_evidence_1 = \"Records show Chaucer receiving an annuity from the crown in 1367.\"\n    supporting_evidence_2 = \"He was a member of the English court during this period.\"\n    supporting_evidence_3 = \"His first major diplomatic journey to Italy was in 1372, years after Blanche's death.\"\n    conclusive_work = \"The Book of the Duchess, an elegy for Blanche, commissioned by her husband John of Gaunt.\"\n\n    # Step 3: Print the conclusion.\n    print(f\"To determine where Geoffrey Chaucer was when Blanche of Lancaster died, we look at the year of her death: {year_of_death_blanche}.\")\n    print(f\"During this time, Chaucer was serving as an {chaucers_role}.\")\n    print(f\"Biographical and historical records place him firmly in {chaucers_location}.\")\n    print(f\"He later wrote '{conclusive_work}' in her memory, which further connects him to the English court at the time.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, Geoffrey Chaucer was in England when Blanche of Lancaster died.\")\n\nfind_chaucers_location()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
