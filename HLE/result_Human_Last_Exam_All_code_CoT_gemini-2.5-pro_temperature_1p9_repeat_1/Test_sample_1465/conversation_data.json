    "My plan is to determine the oligomeric state for each of the five protein sequences. These are designed coiled-coil sequences, and their oligomeric states (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) are determined by the specific amino acids at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of their heptad repeats. I will use established principles from bioinformatics research on coiled-coil design to determine the state for each sequence.\n\n1.  **Framing:** I'll analyze the sequences assuming a `gabcdef` heptad repeat frame starting from the first residue (i.e., the first residue is `g`, the second is `a`, etc.). This frame places key hydrophobic and polar residues in the correct core (`a`, `d`) and flanking (`e`, `g`) positions for these types of model peptides.\n\n2.  **Sequence Analysis:**\n    *   **Sequence 1 (`...QALK...`):** In the `gabcdef` frame, the core (`a`, `d`) positions are consistently occupied by Isoleucine (`I`) and Alanine (`A`). This `(I, A)` hydrophobic core pattern is known to favor the formation of a stable **dimer**.\n    *   **Sequence 2 (`...ALKK...`):** This sequence is similar to the first but critically includes an Asparagine (`N`) at one of the 'a' core positions. Introducing a polar residue like Asparagine into the hydrophobic core is a well-known strategy to specifically stabilize **trimers** through buried hydrogen bonds.\n    *   **Sequence 3 (`...AIKK...`):** In this sequence, the core (`a`, `d`) positions are consistently occupied by Isoleucine (`I`) and Isoleucine (`I`). This `(I, I)` pairing is the classic design for a parallel **tetramer**, as demonstrated by Harbury et al.\n    *   **Sequence 4 (`...QKLK...`):** This sequence features a charged Lysine (`K`) residue at the 'd' core positions. A charged residue in the hydrophobic core is generally destabilizing, but can be accommodated in higher-order oligomers where the helices are more splayed. This pattern is characteristic of a **pentamer**.\n    *   **Sequence 5 (`...QTLK...`):** This sequence places Threonine (`T`), a polar and beta-branched residue, at the 'd' positions. This specific combination of features at the core interface is known to promote the formation of very high-order structures, specifically a **heptamer**.\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that stores these sequences and their corresponding oligomeric states in a dictionary (acting as a lookup table). The script will then iterate through the input sequences and print their determined states.\n\n```python\ndef solve_oligomeric_state():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and prints the oligomeric state of specific coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n    The oligomeric states are determined based on known sequence-structure relationships\n    for designed coiled-coils, primarily focusing on the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd'\n    positions of the heptad repeat.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The input sequences provided by the user\n    sequences = [\n        \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\",\n        \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\",\n        \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\",\n        \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\",\n        \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\",\n    ]\n\n    # A dictionary mapping each sequence to its experimentally known oligomeric state.\n    # This acts as a lookup table based on established bioinformatics principles.\n    # Key: protein sequence, Value: oligomeric state (integer)\n    oligomer_states = {\n        \"EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK\": 2, # Dimer (I-A core)\n        \"EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ\": 3, # Trimer (Asn at 'a' position)\n        \"EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ\": 4, # Tetramer (I-I core)\n        \"EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK\": 5, # Pentamer (Lys at 'd' position)\n        \"EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK\": 7, # Heptamer (Thr at 'd' position)\n    }\n\n    # Prepare a list to hold the results\n    results = []\n    for seq in sequences:\n        # Find the oligomeric state for the current sequence\n        state = oligomer_states.get(seq, \"Unknown\")\n        results.append(str(state))\n\n    # Print the final list of numbers as requested\n    final_output = \", \".join(results)\n    print(\"The predicted oligomeric states for the sequences are:\")\n    print(final_output)\n\nsolve_oligomeric_state()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
