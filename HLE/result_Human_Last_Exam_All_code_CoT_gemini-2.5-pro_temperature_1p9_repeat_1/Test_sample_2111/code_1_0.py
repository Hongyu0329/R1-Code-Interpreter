# The task is to identify the conceptual entity described by Fernand Braudel,
# based on a quote from Paul Morand.
# The quote discusses placing this entity within a sphere, representing the globe,
# for a proper historical perspective.

# Braudel quotes Morand defining this entity as "an uninterrupted history".
# Braudel himself then elaborates that it is also a "space" that must be
# inscribed within a sphere. This entity is "civilization".

conceptual_entity = "civilization"

# We will now print the identified entity.
