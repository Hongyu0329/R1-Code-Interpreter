    "To compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Matrix**: I will represent the 3x3 matrix `A` using the NumPy library in Python, which is ideal for matrix operations.\n2.  **Apply the Determinant Formula**: The determinant of a 3x3 matrix `[[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]` is calculated using the formula: `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n3.  **Show the Calculation**: I will print out each step of this calculation, substituting the numerical values from the matrix `A` into the formula. This will fulfill the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n4.  **Compute the Final Result**: I will calculate the final value of the determinant and print it.\n\nThe information about the \"Markov quiver\" and \"m_{1/2} = 13\" appears to be contextual and is not needed for the requested computation of the determinant of the explicitly provided matrix `A`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_determinant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix and shows the calculation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given adjacency matrix A\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The given matrix is:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\nTo compute the determinant, we use the formula for a 3x3 matrix:\")\n    print(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n\n    # Extract elements for clarity in the equation\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n    # Step 1: Substitute the numbers from the matrix into the formula\n    equation_step1 = (f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h}))\"\n                      f\" - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g}))\"\n                      f\" + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Substituting the numbers into the formula gives:\")\n    print(equation_step1)\n\n    # Step 2: Simplify the expressions inside the parentheses\n    minor1 = e*i - f*h\n    minor2 = d*i - f*g\n    minor3 = d*h - e*g\n    \n    equation_step2 = f\"det(A) = ({a})*({minor1}) - ({b})*({minor2}) + ({c})*({minor3})\"\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Simplifying the 2x2 determinants inside the parentheses:\")\n    print(equation_step2)\n\n    # Step 3: Perform the multiplications\n    term1 = a * minor1\n    term2 = -b * minor2\n    term3 = c * minor3\n    \n    equation_step3 = f\"det(A) = {term1} + ({term2}) + ({term3})\"\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Performing the multiplications:\")\n    print(equation_step3)\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the final determinant\n    determinant = np.linalg.det(A)\n    \n    # We use round() to handle potential floating point inaccuracies for a result that should be an integer\n    final_determinant = round(determinant)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nStep 4: Summing the terms gives the final determinant:\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {final_determinant}\")\n\ncompute_determinant()\n<<<0>>>\n```"
