# Plan:
# 1. Define the answer for each capability based on the analysis of the visual cliff and swinging room experiments.
#    I. Goal-driven locomotion -> Necessary for the cliff (to move towards a goal) but not the room (task is to stand still).
#    II. MST analogue (optic flow processing) -> The core mechanism of the swinging room. Not essential for the cliff, which can rely on static depth cues.
#    III. Relative size evaluation -> A classic monocular depth cue, essential for perceiving the cliff. Not relevant to the room illusion.
#    IV. Binocular disparity -> A primary binocular depth cue, essential for perceiving the cliff. Not relevant to the room illusion.
#    V. Postural control mechanism -> The direct output being measured in the room experiment. Not the primary system tested by the cliff.
# 2. Combine the individual answers into a single hyphen-separated string.
# 3. Print the final string.

# Step 1: Determine the answer for each item.
answer_I = "cliff"
answer_II = "room"
answer_III = "cliff"
answer_IV = "cliff"
answer_V = "room"

# Step 2: Combine the answers.
final_answer = f"{answer_I}-{answer_II}-{answer_III}-{answer_IV}-{answer_V}"

# Step 3: Print the final answer.
print(final_answer)

# The final output needs to be wrapped in the special <<<>>> format.
print(f"<<<{final_answer}>>>")
