It reflects inflammation of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord, which can cause cranial nerve palsies (leading to vision and hearing loss) and headaches. Parenchymal lesions ('snowball' hyperintensities) are also seen.",
        'C': "Incorrect. 'Pleural effusion' on chest x-ray can be seen in pulmonary sarcoidosis, but it does not explain the significant neurological symptoms which are a central part of the patient's presentation.",
        'D': "Incorrect. 'Vascular hemorrhage' is less likely. The vision loss is described as transient, which points more towards an ischemic process (like from vasculitis) rather than a completed hemorrhage.",
        'E': "Incorrect. An 'intrasellar mass' would typically cause specific visual field deficits (like bitemporal hemianopsia) and hormonal issues, not the broad multisystem symptoms described here."
