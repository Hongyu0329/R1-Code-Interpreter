    This function calculates the upper bounds for d based on the condition
    that must be met to transition from step n-1 to step n.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. At step n-1, the points {a_1, ..., a_{n-1}} divide [0, d] into n segments.
       Let their lengths be g_1, ..., g_n. Each g_i <= 1/(n-1). The sum is d.
    2. At step n, we add point a_n. It splits one segment, say g_k. The other n-1 segments
       remain, but now they must conform to the new rule: length <= 1/n.
    3. This means that at step n-1, at most one segment (g_k) could have been longer than 1/n.
       g_k has a maximum length of 1/(n-1).
       The other n-1 segments must have a length of at most 1/n.
    4. The total length d is the sum of these lengths. So, d <= (1/(n-1)) + (n-1)*(1/n).
    5. This must hold for every n >= 2.
