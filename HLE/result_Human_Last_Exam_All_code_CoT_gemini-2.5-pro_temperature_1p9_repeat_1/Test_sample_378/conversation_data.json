    "Based on my research, there appears to be a misunderstanding in the question. The former President of Nigeria is named Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. Nnamdi Azikiwe was a separate, prominent Nigerian statesman who served as the first President of Nigeria.\n\nThere is no public record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identifying himself with the name \"Azikiwe\". The query seems to conflate these two different historical figures.\n\nTherefore, I will provide a Python script that clarifies this point. The script will print out an explanation addressing the names and the lack of a year for the event described.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_and_provide_explanation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the user's query about Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\n    It clarifies the names of the individuals involved and explains why a specific year cannot be provided.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    former_president_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    first_president_name = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n\n    print(\"There seems to be a confusion of names in the query.\")\n    print(f\"The 14th President of Nigeria was {former_president_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The first President of Nigeria was {first_president_name}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThere is no public record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever using the name 'Azikiwe'.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, a year for him publicly identifying as 'Azikiwe' does not exist.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    check_name_and_provide_explanation()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever using the name 'Azikiwe', as this seems to be a confusion with Nnamdi Azikiwe, a different Nigerian president. Therefore, no such year exists.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
