    "This is a problem of enumerating small categories up to isomorphism. I will break down the problem into different cases based on the domains and codomains of the morphisms. For each case, I will determine the number of non-isomorphic categories. Finally, I will sum up the counts from all cases to get the total.\n\nA category with 2 objects, let's call them A and B, must have two identity morphisms, `id_A` and `id_B`. We are given a total of 4 morphisms, which means there are 2 non-identity morphisms, let's call them `f` and `g`.\n\nThe structure of the category is determined by:\n1.  The domain and codomain of `f` and `g`.\n2.  The composition rules for all morphisms, which must be associative and respect the identity morphisms.\n\nThe possible `Hom-sets` for any morphism are `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(A,B)`, `Hom(B,A)`, and `Hom(B,B)`. The two non-identity morphisms `f` and `g` must be distributed among these sets.\n\nI will analyze the following exhaustive and mutually exclusive cases for the distribution of `f` and `g`, up to isomorphism (which includes swapping the roles of A and B):\n\n1.  **Both morphisms are endomorphisms of A**: `f, g` are in `Hom(A,A)`.\n2.  **Both morphisms are from A to B**: `f, g` are in `Hom(A,B)`.\n3.  **One endomorphism on A, one from A to B**: `f` in `Hom(A,A)`, `g` in `Hom(A,B)`.\n4.  **One endomorphism on A, one from B to A**: `f` in `Hom(A,A)`, `g` in `Hom(B,A)`.\n5.  **One endomorphism on A, one on B**: `f` in `Hom(A,A)`, `g` in `Hom(B,B)`.\n6.  **One morphism from A to B, one from B to A**: `f` in `Hom(A,B)`, `g` in `Hom(B,A)`.\n\nThe following Python script will detail the analysis for each case and compute the total number of categories.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms,\n    up to isomorphism.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\\n\")\n    print(\"Let the objects be A and B.
