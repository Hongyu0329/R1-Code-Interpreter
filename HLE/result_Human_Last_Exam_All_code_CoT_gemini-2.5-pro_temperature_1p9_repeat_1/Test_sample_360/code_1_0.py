    # Due to the strong chelate effect, the tetradentate dptt ligand will replace
    # one bidentate bpy ligand and the two monodentate Cl⁻ ligands.

    # The complex has an octahedral geometry with a linear tetradentate ligand (dptt)
    # and a bidentate ligand (bpy).
    # A linear tetradentate ligand can wrap around the metal center in different ways.
    # This leads to different topological isomers (diastereomers).
    # For a complex of the type [M(linear-tetradentate)(bidentate)], there are two
    # possible ways the tetradentate ligand can arrange itself.

    # Each of these diastereomers lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion,
    # making them chiral.
    # Each chiral molecule exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers.
