    "To determine the number of isomers formed in the reaction, we need to analyze the structure of the reactants and the likely product, and then systematically enumerate all possible stereoisomers of the product.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Product:** Analyze the starting complex, `cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)`, and the reacting ligand, `2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole` (dptt). Determine the most likely product complex formed from their reaction. The strong chelating nature of the tetradentate dptt ligand suggests it will replace one bidentate bipyridine (bpy) ligand and the two monodentate chloro (Cl⁻) ligands, resulting in the complex `[Ru(bpy)(dptt)]²⁺`.\n\n2.  **Analyze Product Geometry:** The product complex has a Ruthenium(II) center, which will have an octahedral coordination geometry. It is coordinated by one tetradentate `dptt` ligand and one bidentate `bpy` ligand.\n\n3.  **Identify Diastereomers:** A \"linear\" tetradentate ligand like `dptt` can wrap around an octahedral center in topologically distinct ways. These different wrapping modes create different geometric isomers, specifically diastereomers. For this type of complex, `[M(linear-L₄)(L₂)]`, there are two such possible arrangements.\n\n4.  **Analyze Chirality:** For each diastereomer identified, we must determine if it is chiral. A complex is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image (i.e., it lacks a mirror plane or a center of inversion). Both possible diastereomers of `[Ru(bpy)(dptt)]²⁺` are chiral.\n\n5.  **Calculate Total Isomers:** The total number of isomers is the sum of isomers from each type. Since we have two diastereomers and each is chiral (existing as a pair of enantiomers), the total number of isomers is the product of the number of diastereomers and the number of enantiomers per diastereomer (which is 2).\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan to calculate and explain the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_isomer_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the number of isomers formed from the reaction of\n    cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) and 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the reaction and product\n    # The tetradentate ligand dptt reacts with cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂].\n    # Due to the strong chelate effect, the tetradentate dptt ligand will replace\n    # one bidentate bpy ligand and the two monodentate Cl⁻ ligands.\n    # The resulting product is an octahedral complex [Ru(bpy)(dptt)]²⁺.\n    print(\"Step 1: Reaction Analysis\")\n    print(\"Reactants: cis-[Ru(bpy)₂(Cl)₂] and dptt (tetradentate ligand)\")\n    print(\"Product: [Ru(bpy)(dptt)]²⁺\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the stereochemistry\n    # The complex has an octahedral geometry with a linear tetradentate ligand (dptt)\n    # and a bidentate ligand (bpy).\n    # A linear tetradentate ligand can wrap around the metal center in different ways.\n    # This leads to different topological isomers (diastereomers).\n    # For a complex of the type [M(linear-tetradentate)(bidentate)], there are two\n    # possible ways the tetradentate ligand can arrange itself.\n    num_diastereomers = 2\n    print(\"Step 2: Stereochemical Analysis\")\n    print(f\"The linear tetradentate dptt ligand can wrap around the octahedral Ru(II) center in two distinct ways, leading to {num_diastereomers} diastereomers.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Check for chirality\n    # Each of these diastereomers lacks a plane of symmetry or a center of inversion,\n    # making them chiral.\n    # Each chiral molecule exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers.\n    num_enantiomers_per_chiral_diastereomer = 2\n    print(f\"Both diastereomers are chiral.
