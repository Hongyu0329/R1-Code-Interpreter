# 1. Analyze the function of Al1
kcat_control = experiments["Control"]
kcat_al1 = experiments["4. Plus 5 mM Al1"]
print("1. Function of Al1:")
print(f"The baseline kcat of the enzyme is {kcat_control}/second.")
print(f"When Al1 is added, the kcat increases significantly. The equation is: New kcat = {kcat_al1}/second.")
print("Conclusion: Since kcat increases, Al1 functions as an activator for enzyme Zma1. As it's not the substrate, it is considered an allosteric activator.")

# 2. Analyze the function of Rga1

print(f"When Rga1 is added, the kcat drops drastically. The equation is: New kcat = {kcat_rga1}/second.")
print("This indicates that Rga1 is a strong inhibitor.")
print(f"To determine the type of inhibition, excess substrate was added. The kcat remains unchanged. The equation is: New kcat = {kcat_rga1_substrate}/second.")
print("Conclusion: Since adding excess substrate does not reverse the inhibition, Rga1 is an irreversible inhibitor (or a non-competitive/uncompetitive inhibitor).")

# 3. Evaluation of Answer Choice C
print("3. Evaluating Answer Choice C: 'Al1 and Al2 function as allosteric modulators for Zma1. Al1 and Al2 bind to the same site on Zma1. Rga1 is an irreversible inhibitor.'")

# Point A: Al1 and Al2 as allosteric modulators
kcat_al2 = experiments["5. Plus 5 mM Al2"]
print("\n- Checkpoint A (Al1/Al2 function):")
print(f"Al1 increases kcat (from {kcat_control} to {kcat_al1}), making it an activator.")
print(f"Al2 decreases kcat (from {kcat_control} to {kcat_al2}), making it an inhibitor.")
print("The term 'allosteric modulators' is appropriate for both.")

# Point B: Binding site of Al1 and Al2
kcat_al1_al2 = experiments["6. Plus 5mM Al1 and 5mM Al2"]
print("\n- Checkpoint B (Binding Site):")
print(f"When both Al1 and Al2 are present, the kcat is {kcat_al1_al2}/second.")
print(f"This rate is identical to the rate with Al2 alone ({kcat_al2}/second). This suggests they compete for the same allosteric site, with the inhibitor Al2's effect being dominant.")

# Point C: Rga1 as an irreversible inhibitor
print("\n- Checkpoint C (Rga1 function):")
print(f"Rga1 reduces kcat to {kcat_rga1}/second. This effect is not reversed by adding excess substrate (kcat remains at {kcat_rga1_substrate}/second).")
