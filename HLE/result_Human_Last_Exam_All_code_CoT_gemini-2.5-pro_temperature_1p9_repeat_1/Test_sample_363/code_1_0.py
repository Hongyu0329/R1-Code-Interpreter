    This function determines the IUPAC name of the product from the specified reaction.
    
    The reaction is a stereoselective Ireland-Claisen rearrangement.
    1. The starting material is N-(((S)-5-methylcyclopent-1-en-1-yl)methyl)-N-((S)-1-phenylethyl)propionamide.
    2. LiHMDS creates the (Z)-enolate.
    3. Heating causes a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. The allylic group migrates from N to the alpha-carbon of the propionyl group.
    4. A new stereocenter is formed at C2 of the new acyl chain. Its configuration is (R) due to the influence of the (S)-phenylethyl auxiliary.
    5. The final product, after an implicit workup, is a new amide.
