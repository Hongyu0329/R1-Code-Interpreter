# Step 1: Define the given values.
# Phi_k(x') is the firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule.
phi_k = 0.7
# muG_k_j(y_j) is the membership degree in the consequent fuzzy set.
mu_g = 0.9

# Step 2: Apply the t-norm operation.
# We will use the minimum t-norm, as it's the most common for fuzzy implication.
# The activation level is the result of clipping the consequent membership by the antecedent firing strength.
activation_level = np.minimum(phi_k, mu_g)

# Step 3: Print the result in a descriptive equation.
# The final output shows each number used in the calculation.
