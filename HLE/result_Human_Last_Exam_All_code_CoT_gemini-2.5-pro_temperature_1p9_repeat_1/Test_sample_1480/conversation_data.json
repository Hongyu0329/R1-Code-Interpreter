    "To determine the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm, we need to combine the firing strength of the rule's antecedent with the membership function of the consequent. The problem can be broken down as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the Inputs**: We are given two values:\n    *   `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`: This represents the firing strength of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part of the fuzzy rule).\n    *   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`: This is the membership degree of a value in the consequent fuzzy set (the \"THEN\" part).\n\n2.  **Choose the T-norm Operation**: A t-norm is a function that models the logical \"AND\" operation in fuzzy logic. Since the specific t-norm is not mentioned, I will use the most common one, which is the **minimum t-norm**. The formula is `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`. This operation calculates the resulting membership value after the rule's consequent is \"clipped\" by the antecedent's firing strength.\n\n3.  **Note on \"Interval Type-3\"**: While the problem mentions \"interval type-3\", the provided inputs (`0.7` and `0.9`) are single, crisp numbers. A full calculation for an IT3 FS would involve complex operations on interval type-2 fuzzy sets. The provided values allow us to demonstrate the fundamental t-norm operation which is a building block within all types of fuzzy systems.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation**: I will calculate the minimum of the two given values to find the rule activation level.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values.\n# Phi_k(x') is the firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule.\nphi_k = 0.7\n# muG_k_j(y_j) is the membership degree in the consequent fuzzy set.\nmu_g = 0.9\n\n# Step 2: Apply the t-norm operation.\n# We will use the minimum t-norm, as it's the most common for fuzzy implication.\n# The activation level is the result of clipping the consequent membership by the antecedent firing strength.\nactivation_level = np.minimum(phi_k, mu_g)\n\n# Step 3: Print the result in a descriptive equation.\n# The final output shows each number used in the calculation.\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is found by applying a t-norm (minimum) to the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership degree.\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_g}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
