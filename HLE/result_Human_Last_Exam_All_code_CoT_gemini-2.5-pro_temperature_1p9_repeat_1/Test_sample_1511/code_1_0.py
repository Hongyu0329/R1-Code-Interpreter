# Part (a): Theoretical result
# For a sum maximal cross 1-intersecting family pair (F, G), under the given conditions,
# both F and G must be the family of all k-multisets containing a single fixed element.
# Therefore, any two multisets from these families will have a non-empty intersection of supports.

# The maximal sum is given by the formula 2 * C(m + k - 2, k - 1).
# Here, m=5, k=2, so we calculate 2 * C(5 + 2 - 2, 2 - 1) = 2 * C(5, 1).
