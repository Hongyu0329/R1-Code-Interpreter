    Solves the problem of finding the smallest possible number of elements in a subset Y of X.

    The problem can be solved by reformulating it as a dual problem concerning
    intersections of subspaces. Let n = 2023 be the dimension of the ambient space,
    and k = 2000 be the dimension of the subspaces in X.

    The original problem is:
    Find the smallest m such that for a set of k-dim subspaces {W_1, ..., W_m},
    for any k-dim subspace V, we have: sum(V intersect W_i) = V.

    The dual problem is:
    Let d = n - k. Find the smallest m such that for a set of d-dim subspaces {U_1, ..., U_m},
    for any d-dim subspace U, we have: intersect(U + U_i) = U.

    The solution to this dual problem is m = d + 1.

    Step 1: Define the dimensions.
    n is the dimension of the total vector space.
    k is the dimension of the subspaces in the set X.

    # Step 2: Calculate the codimension 'd'.

    # Step 3: The minimum number of subspaces 'm' is d + 1.
    m = d + 1
    
    # Final step: Print the calculation.
