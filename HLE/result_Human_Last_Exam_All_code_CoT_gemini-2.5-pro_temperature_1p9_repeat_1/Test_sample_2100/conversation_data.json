    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to identify the person and then generate the code.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I will deconstruct the information provided in the riddle.\n    *   The subject was called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by the poet Andrei Voznesensky.\n    *   Voznesensky wrote a poem asking about the location of this man's grave.\n    *   The grave's location was discovered or at least memorialized in the late 1980s.\n2.  **Identify the Connection:** The clues strongly point to Nikolai Rezanov (1764-1807), a Russian nobleman and explorer. Voznesensky wrote the libretto for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" which immortalized the story of Rezanov's journey to California and his romance with Concepción Argüello. This context perfectly fits the description of a \"joy-discovering sailor.\"\n3.  **Verify the Grave Story:** Rezanov died and was buried in Krasnoyarsk, Russia. His grave at the Voskresensky Cathedral was destroyed during the Soviet era, losing its location. In the late 1980s, a memorial was finally erected at the supposed site of the grave, matching the final clue.\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that states the conclusion. To satisfy the unusual instruction to create an \"equation,\" the script will also convert each letter of the last name \"Rezanov\" into its corresponding numerical position in the English alphabet (A=1, B=2, etc.) and print this out as a demonstrative equation.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the historical riddle based on the provided clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The clues point to Nikolai Rezanov.\n    # 1. Voznesensky's rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" is about Rezanov's voyage.\n    # 2. Rezanov's grave in Krasnoyarsk was lost and then memorialized in the late 1980s.\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n\n    print(f\"The man described by Andrei Voznesensky is Nikolai Rezanov.\")\n    print(f\"His last name is: {last_name}\")\n\n    # As requested, here is a representation of the name as a 'final equation'\n    # where each letter is assigned its value based on its position in the alphabet.\n    print(\"\\nA numerical equation for the name:\")\n\n    equation_parts = []\n    # Create a string like \"R(18) + E(5) + ...\"\n    for char in last_name.upper():\n        # ord(char) gets the ASCII value. We subtract the value for 'A' and add 1.\n        numerical_value = ord(char) - ord('A') + 1\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{char}({numerical_value})\")\n\n    # The final equation string showing each letter and its number\n    final_equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(final_equation)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
