    Analyzes the existence of a function f with specific properties in set theory.

    The problem asks:
    Let kappa be an infinite cardinal. Does there exist a function f: [kappa^+]^2 -> kappa,
    such that for every subset x of kappa^+ with order type kappa+1, the image of pairs
    from x under f has cardinality kappa?

    The equation in question is: |f''[x]^2| = kappa.
    Here, the number 2 is the size of the sets in the domain of f, i.e., pairs of ordinals.
