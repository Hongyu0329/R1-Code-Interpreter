    "This is a problem in abstract algebra, specifically group theory. The solution relies on combining known theorems about the structures of \"filled groups\" and \"nilpotent groups\". I will outline the definitions, state the main theorem for classifying filled groups, and then determine which of those groups also satisfy the nilpotent property. My final response will be a Python script that prints this logical deduction step-by-step.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Define the key terms**: A \"filled group\" and a \"nilpotent group\".\n2.  **State the classification theorem**: There is a known theorem that fully characterizes all finite filled groups.\n3.  **Analyze the intersection**: I will examine the two types of filled groups from the theorem and check which of them are also nilpotent.\n4.  **Synthesize the final answer**: I will combine the results to give a complete description of all finite filled nilpotent groups.\n5.  **Present as a Python script**: The explanation will be presented through `print` statements in a Python script as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_theory_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the solution to the question:\n    'What are the finite filled nilpotent groups?'\n    It lays out the definitions, relevant theorems, and logical steps to arrive at the final characterization.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"To find the finite filled nilpotent groups, we must understand the properties 'filled' and 'nilpotent' and then find the groups that satisfy both.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: Definitions ---\")\n    print(\"1.
