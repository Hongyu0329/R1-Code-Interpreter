    "Of course. I will help you with this physics problem. The calculation of a partition function using path integrals is a cornerstone of quantum field theory and statistical mechanics. Here is a step-by-step derivation followed by a Python script to illustrate the result.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Define the Goal**: We want to find the grand canonical partition function `Z` for a system described by the operator `exp(-β(H - μN))`. The question specifies a Hamiltonian `H' = -μN`. This is ambiguous, but the most standard interpretation is that the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian `H` (containing kinetic and potential energy) is zero, and we are interested in the partition function `Z = Tr(e^(-β(0 - μN))) = Tr(e^(βμN))`. This describes a system of particles whose presence is governed only by the chemical potential, not by any intrinsic energy.\n\n2.  **Path Integral Formalism**: The partition function `Z` can be written as a functional integral (or path integral) over quantum fields `ψ(x,τ)` and `ψ*(x,τ)`, where `τ` is imaginary time.\n    `Z = ∫ D[ψ*, ψ] e^(-S[ψ*, ψ])`\n    The action `S` is the integral of the Lagrangian density over imaginary time (from 0 to `β = 1/kT`) and space. For a general Hamiltonian `H`, the action is `S = ∫dτ∫dx ψ*(∂/∂τ + H - μ)ψ`. Since our system's intrinsic Hamiltonian `H` is zero, the action simplifies to:\n    `S = ∫dτ∫dx ψ*(x,τ)(∂/∂τ - μ)ψ(x,τ)`\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integral**: The path integral with this action is a standard Gaussian integral over fields. Its evaluation depends on the nature of the fields:\n    *   **Bosons**: The fields are complex-valued functions.\n    *   **Fermions**: The fields are anti-commuting Grassmann numbers.\n\n    Evaluating these integrals over all space-time modes `{k, ω_n}` yields a product over the contribution from each mode.\n\n4.  **Operator Formalism (A More Intuitive Approach)**: We can confirm the path integral result more simply using the operator definition of the trace. The trace can be calculated in the basis of occupation numbers `|n_1, n_2, ..., n_k, ...>`, where `n_k` is the number of particles in the single-particle quantum state `k`.\n\n    *   `Z = Tr(e^(βμN)) = ∑_{{n_k}} <n_1, n_2, ...| e^(βμN) |n_1, n_2, ...>`\n    *   The particle number operator `N` acting on a state gives the total number of particles: `N|{n_k}> = (∑_k n_k) |{n_k}>`.\n    *   Substituting this in, we get:\n        `Z = ∑_{{n_k}} e^(βμ ∑_k n_k) = ∑_{{n_k}} ∏_k e^(βμn_k)`\n    *   We can swap the sum and the product:\n        `Z = ∏_k [ ∑_{n_k} (e^(βμ))^n_k ]`\n\n5.  **Final Formulas (Bosons vs. Fermions)**: The final step depends on the allowed occupation numbers `n_k` for each state `k`.\n\n    *   **For Bosons**: Any number of particles can occupy a single state (`n_k = 0, 1, 2, ...`). The sum `∑_{n_k}` becomes a geometric series:\n        `∑_{n=0 to ∞} (e^(βμ))^n = 1 + x + x^2 + ... = 1 / (1 - x)` where `x = e^(βμ)`.\n        This series only converges if `|x| < 1`, which requires `μ < 0`.\n        The total partition function is the product over all states: `Z_Boson = ∏_k [ 1 / (1 - e^(βμ)) ]`.\n\n    *   **For Fermions**: The Pauli exclusion principle dictates that a state can either be empty or occupied by a single particle (`n_k = 0` or `1`). The sum `∑_{n_k}` is much simpler:\n        `∑_{n=0 to 1} (e^(βμ))^n = (e^(βμ))^0 + (e^(βμ))^1 = 1 + e^(βμ)`.\n        The total partition function is the product over all states: `Z_Fermion = ∏_k [ 1 + e^(βμ) ]`.\n\n### Python Implementation\n\nThe following Python code calculates the partition function `Z` for a system of `M` degenerate states (i.e., the product `∏_k` over `M` identical terms becomes a power `(...)**M`). It handles both the boson and fermion cases.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_partition_function(mu, beta, M, particle_type):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the grand canonical partition function Z for a system with H=0.\n    This corresponds to the derived formulas for non-interacting particles.\n\n    Args:\n        mu (float): Chemical potential.
