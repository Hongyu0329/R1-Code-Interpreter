def solve():
    """
    Solves the two-part problem based on the theory of tensor-triangulated categories.

    The problem asks to identify which of a list of 20 objects generate a prime tt-ideal
    and to count how many prime tt-ideals are not generated by any of these objects.
    The solution requires interpreting the problem statement and applying known classification
    theorems for the Balmer spectrum of the given category.
    """

    # Step 1: Assume a specific context for p and k.
    # The problem is posed in a way that suggests a single numerical answer is expected.
    # This requires fixing the parameters p and k. The most fundamental non-trivial case
    # in this context is p=2 (the smallest prime characteristic) and k=F_2 (the smallest field).
    p = 2
    # k = F_2

    # Step 2: Identify which objects on the list are duplicates for p=2.
    # When p=2, p-1=1. This creates several identical objects in the list.
    # 3 ([p-1]=k) is identical to 1.
    # 6 (gap^{p-1}) is identical to 5.
    # 9 (cone^{p-1}) is identical to 7.
    # 10 (cone^p) is identical to 8 (cone^2).
    # 14 (gap^{p-1}) is identical to 13.
    # 20 (S otimes gap^{p-1}) is identical to 19.
    
    # Step 3: Analyze the objects to find the prime ideal generators.
    # The prime ideals of K are P_star and P_v for v in P^{p-1}_k.
    # - rad(kC_p) (Object 4) is the canonical generator for P_star.
    # - cone(tau) (Object 7) is the canonical generator for a geometric prime P_v.
    # - An object G that generates the whole category K (i.e., <G>=K) implies that
    #   <G tensor X> = <X>. This helps find other generators for the same prime ideals.
    # - Generators of K include k(0), kC_p(0), [p-1](0), gap^i(rad(kC_p)), and S.
    # - Powers (n>1) or products of distinct prime generators do not generate prime ideals.
