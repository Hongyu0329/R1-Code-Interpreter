# --- Catalyst Component Selection ---
# This script outlines the components of a state-of-the-art, single-site catalyst system
# designed for the dual functions of olefin polymerization and polyolefin hydrogenolysis.
# The selection is based on leading research in organometallic and materials chemistry.

# 1. The Group IV Metal Center
# The metal is the heart of the catalyst. Zirconium is chosen for its well-documented
# high activity in both Ziegler-Natta type polymerization and C-H/C-C bond activation.
metal = "Zirconium (Zr)"

# 2. The Ligand Framework
# The ligand modulates the metal's reactivity. A constrained-geometry catalyst (CGC) ligand
# is ideal. It forces an open coordination site for monomer approach (for polymerization)
# and is robust enough to withstand the conditions required for hydrogenolysis.
ligand_family = "Constrained-Geometry Ligand"
ligand_example = "Bridged Cyclopentadienyl-Amido, e.g., [Me2Si(Cp''')(N-tBu)] where Cp''' is a heavily substituted cyclopentadienyl ring."

# 3. The Support Material
# Immobilizing the active complex on a support turns it into a practical, heterogenous catalyst.
# The support can also participate in the reaction. Sulfated alumina provides high surface
# area, thermal stability, and surface Lewis acidity, which helps activate C-C bonds for cleavage.
support = "Partially Dehydroxylated Sulfated Alumina (Î³-Al2O3-SO4)"

# --- Output the Final Catalyst Combination ---
