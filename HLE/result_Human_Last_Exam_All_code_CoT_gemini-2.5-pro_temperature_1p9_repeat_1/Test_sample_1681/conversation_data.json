    "In a classical Prisoner's Dilemma game, the rational choice for both players is to defect, leading to a suboptimal Nash Equilibrium of (1, 1). However, when the game is played in a quantum setting, this dilemma can be resolved. By introducing quantum phenomena like entanglement and superposition, a new, superior equilibrium point can be reached.\n\n### My Plan:\n\n1.  **Quantum Game Setup**: I will model the Prisoner's Dilemma using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. This involves:\n    *   An initial quantum state which is a maximally entangled pair of qubits. This is crucial for breaking the classical dilemma. I will design this state using an entangling operator `J`.\n    *   Players' strategies are represented by unitary transformations (quantum gates) applied to their respective qubits.\n    *   A final measurement of the quantum state determines the probabilities of the classical outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD).\n\n2.  **Identify the Optimal Strategy**: I will identify a special quantum strategy, often called the \"Quantum\" or \"Miracle\" move `Q`, which is not accessible in the classical game. This strategy corresponds to the quantum gate `Q = iσ_z`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Equilibrium**: I will write a Python script to calculate the game's outcome when both players choose the optimal strategy `Q`. The script will:\n    *   Define the payoff matrix and all necessary quantum operators (`I`, `σ_x`, `J`, `Q`).\n    *   Simulate the game's evolution: initial state -> entanglement -> players' moves -> disentanglement -> final state.\n    *   Calculate the probabilities of the four classical outcomes.\n    *   Compute the final payoff for each player based on these probabilities.\n\n4.  **Verification**: The pair of strategies `(Q, Q)` constitutes a Nash Equilibrium if neither player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy. Analytical proofs show that when one player chooses `Q`, the other player's best possible response is also `Q`, which results in a payoff of 5. Any other strategy yields a lower payoff. Therefore, `(Q, Q)` is a stable equilibrium.\n\n5.  **Final Output**: The code will print the step-by-step calculation of the equilibrium payoff, showing how the probabilities of each outcome contribute to the final result, as requested. The final equilibrium payoff value will be presented in the specified format.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the equilibrium point of the Prisoner's Dilemma in a quantum setting.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
