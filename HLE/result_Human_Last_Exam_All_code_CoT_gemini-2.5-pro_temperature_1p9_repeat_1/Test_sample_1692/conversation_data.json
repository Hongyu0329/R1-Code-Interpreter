    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this puzzle.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the System:** The problem describes an Elementary Cellular Automaton (ECA). In an ECA, the state of a cell (0 or 1) at a given time step is determined by the states of its left neighbor, itself, and its right neighbor from the previous time step. This update is governed by a specific \"rule\". There are 256 possible rules in total, numbered 0 to 255.\n2.  **The Goal:** We are given the first state (`t`) and the third state (`t+2`) of an 8-cell automaton with wrap-around (periodic) boundaries. We need to find the unknown intermediate state (`t+1`). The key insight is that the same rule must govern the transition from `t` to `t+1` and from `t+1` to `t+2`.\n3.  **Strategy:** Since we don't know which of the 256 rules is being used, I will write a script to test every single one.\n    *   The script will loop through each rule from 0 to 255.\n    *   For each rule, it will first compute a *candidate* intermediate state by applying the rule to the given initial state (`01101001`).\n    *   Then, it will apply the *same rule* to this candidate intermediate state to generate a final state.\n    *   Finally, it will compare this generated final state to the given final state (`10000111`).\n4.  **Find the Solution:** If the states match, the candidate intermediate state is the correct one. Since the problem asks for the \"only valid solution\", I expect to find exactly one rule that satisfies this condition. The script will print the intermediate state that leads to the correct final state.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cellular_automaton():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 2-step evolution of an elementary cellular automaton.\n    \n    This function iterates through all 256 possible ECA rules to find the one that\n    correctly transforms the initial state to the final state in two steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    initial_state_str = '01101001'\n    final_state_str = '10000111'\n    num_cells = len(initial_state_str)\n    \n    solutions = []\n\n    def apply_rule(state, rule_binary):\n        \"\"\"\n        Applies a given ECA rule to a state string and returns the next state.\n        Handles periodic (wrap-around) boundary conditions.\n        \n        The rule_binary is an 8-bit string corresponding to the outputs for\n        neighborhoods '111', '110', '101', '100', '011', '010', '001', '000'.\n        \"\"\"\n        next_state = []\n        # Create a mapping from neighborhood pattern to its index in the rule binary string.\n        # This is equivalent to mapping '111' to bit 0, '110' to bit 1, ..., '000' to bit 7.\n        rule_map = {format(i, '03b'): rule_binary[7 - i] for i in range(8)}\n\n        for i in range(num_cells):\n            # Get neighborhood with periodic boundaries.\n            # In Python, state[-1] correctly accesses the last element.\n            left = state[i - 1]\n            center = state[i]\n            # The modulo operator handles the wrap-around for the right neighbor.\n            right = state[(i + 1) % num_cells]\n            \n            neighborhood = left + center + right\n            \n            # Look up the new cell state from the rule map and append it.\n            next_state.append(rule_map[neighborhood])\n            \n        return \"\".join(next_state)\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible ECA rules.\n    for rule_number in range(256):\n        # Convert the rule number to its 8-bit binary representation.\n        rule_binary_str = format(rule_number, '08b')\n        \n        # Step 1: Generate the candidate intermediate state from the initial state.\n        intermediate_state = apply_rule(initial_state_str, rule_binary_str)\n        \n        # Step 2: Generate the final state from the candidate intermediate state.\n        calculated_final_state = apply_rule(intermediate_state, rule_binary_str)\n        \n        # Step 3: Compare with the known final state.\n        if calculated_final_state == final_state_str:\n            solutions.append(intermediate_state)\n            # You could break here if you assume there is only one solution,\n            # but we'll continue to ensure it's unique.\n\n    # Output the result.\n    if len(solutions) == 1:\n        # As requested, format the output with spaces between each digit.\n        result = \" \".join(solutions[0])\n        print(f\"Initial state:    { ' '.join(initial_state_str) }\")\n        print(f\"Intermediate state: {result}\")\n        print(f\"Final state:        { ' '.join(final_state_str) }\")\n    elif len(solutions) == 0:\n        print(\"No valid solution found.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Multiple ({len(solutions)}) solutions found:\")\n        for sol in solutions:\n            print(\" \".join(sol))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_cellular_automaton()\n<<<01101100>>>\n```"
