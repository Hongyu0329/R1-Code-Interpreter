    "To determine the number of unique minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot up to rotation and translation, we can follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### My Plan\n1.  **Determine Minimal Grid Number**: The trefoil knot is the simplest non-trivial knot. Its minimal grid number, which is the smallest square grid `n x n` required to represent it, is known to be `n=3`.\n2.  **Represent Grid Diagrams**: A grid diagram on an `n x n` grid can be defined by two permutations, `σ_X` and `σ_O`, of `(0, 1, ..., n-1)`. These permutations specify the row for the 'X' and 'O' marker in each column.\n3.  **Identify Trefoil Diagrams**: A diagram represents a single-component knot if the composite permutation `P = σ_O * σ_X⁻¹` is a single cycle involving all `n` elements. For `n=3`, there are two such cyclic permutations: `c1 = (1,2,0)` and `c2 = (2,0,1)`. These correspond to the right-hand and left-hand trefoil knots, respectively.\n4.  **Generate All Left-Hand Trefoil Diagrams**: We will focus on the left-hand trefoil, where `σ_O * σ_X⁻¹ = (2,0,1)`. This implies `σ_O = (2,0,1) * σ_X`. Since there are `3! = 6` possible permutations for `σ_X`, there are exactly 6 grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil.\n5.  **Check for Rotational Equivalence**: The problem asks for the number of diagrams \"up to translation and rotation\". Our representation using permutations already accounts for translations. We need to check for rotational equivalence. Two diagrams are rotationally equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by a 90, 180, or 270-degree rotation of the grid.\n6.  **Code the Solution**: I will write a Python script to perform the following steps:\n    a. Generate the 6 permutations (`σ_X`) for a 3x3 grid.\n    b. For each `σ_X`, calculate the corresponding `σ_O` for the left-hand trefoil.\n    c. Convert each diagram `(σ_X, σ_O)` into a 3x3 matrix for easier manipulation.\n    d. Group these 6 matrices into equivalence classes based on rotation. Two matrices are in the same class if one can be rotated to become the other.\n    e. The number of equivalence classes will be our final answer.\n\nThis method will systematically count all diagrams and then find the unique ones under the specified geometric transformations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport itertools\n\ndef perm_multiply(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Multiplies two permutations p1 and p2 (p1 after p2).\"\"\"\n    n = len(p2)\n    result = [0] * n\n    for i in range(n):\n        result[i] = p1[p2[i]]\n    return tuple(result)\n\ndef get_matrix(sigma_x, sigma_o):\n    \"\"\"Converts a diagram (sigma_x, sigma_o) to a matrix representation.\"\"\"\n    n = len(sigma_x)\n    M = np.zeros((n, n), dtype=int)\n    for j in range(n):\n        M[sigma_x[j], j] = 1  # 'X' marker\n        M[sigma_o[j], j] = -1 # 'O' marker\n    return M\n\ndef find_unique_diagrams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of unique minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil\n    knot up to rotation.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    # The cyclic permutation for the left-hand trefoil\n    lh_trefoil_cycle = (2, 0, 1)\n\n    # 1.
