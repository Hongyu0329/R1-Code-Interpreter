    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the phonological changes from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) form to the descendant Germanic languages.\n\n### Plan and Derivation Steps:\n\n1.  **PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc):**\n    *   **Initial Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n    *   **Laryngeal Rule:** The laryngeal `*h₂` colors the preceding `*e` vowel to `*a` and then vanishes. This gives the root `*sag-`.\n    *   **Grimm's Law:** This major sound shift affects consonants. The voiced stop `*g` becomes a voiceless stop `*k`. The `*s` remains unaffected, and the stop `*t` becomes a voiceless fricative `*þ`.\n    *   **Verb Formation:** The PIE present tense suffix `*-ie-` typically forms Class 1 weak verbs in Germanic, with a stem in `*-ja-`. The 3rd person singular ending `*-ti` becomes `*-iþ`.\n    *   **Combining these changes:** `*seh₂gieti` -> `*sag-` + `*-j(a)-` + `*-iþ` -> **`*sakjiþ`**.\n\n2.  **PGmc to Old Norse (ON):**\n    *   **Initial Form:** `*sakjiþ`\n    *   **i-Umlaut:** The `j` in the suffix causes the root vowel `*a` to be fronted to `*e`. `*sakj-` -> `*sekj-`.\n    *   **Ending Change:** The 3rd person singular ending `*-iþ` is eventually replaced by `-ir` or `-r` in Old Norse for this verb class. The `j` is preserved after a short syllable.\n    *   **Result:** **`sekir`**.\n\n3.  **PGmc to Old English (OE):**\n    *   **Initial Form:** `*sakjiþ`\n    *   **i-Umlaut:** The `j` fronts the root vowel `*a`. In early Old English this sound was `æ`, which later smoothed to `e`. `*sakj-` -> `*secj-`.\n    *   **Palatalization:** The `*k` before the front glide `*j` becomes a palatal affricate `*ċ` (pronounced as \"ch\" in \"church\"). The `*j` is then lost.\n    *   **Ending Change:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` becomes `-eþ` in Old English. In this verb class, a vowel `-e-` is inserted.\n    *   **Result:** **`seċeþ`**. For ASCII representation in the code, I will write this as `secheth`.\n\n4.  **PGmc to Old High German (OHG):**\n    *   **Initial Form:** `*sakjiþ`\n    *   **West Germanic Gemination:** In West Germanic, consonants (except `r`) were doubled before a `*j`. This turns `*kj` into `*kk`. This gemination blocks the High German Consonant Shift from applying to the `k`. `*sakj-` -> `*sakk-`. The `j` is lost after causing gemination and umlaut.\n    *   **i-Umlaut:** The original `*a` is fronted to `e` by the lost `*j`. `*sakk-` -> `*seck-`.\n    *   **High German Consonant Shift:** This shift affects the ending. `*þ` becomes `d`.\n    *   **Final Devoicing:** The word-final `d` becomes an unvoiced `t`.\n    *   **Result:** **`seckit`**.\n\n*(Note: The actually attested cognates for 'to seek', like Old English `sēċan` and Old High German `suohhen`, derive from an `o`-grade variant of the PIE root, `*soh₂g-`, which leads to a long vowel in Proto-Germanic `*sōkijaną`. The following code correctly traces the specific `e`-grade form `*seh₂gieti` provided in the prompt.)*\n\n```python\ndef trace_pie_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the phonological development of a PIE word into several Germanic languages\n    based on established sound laws.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The starting PIE word and its components\n    pie_form = \"*seh₂gieti\"\n    pie_explanation = \"PIE *seh₂gieti '(s)he’s giving a sign'\"\n\n    # 1.
