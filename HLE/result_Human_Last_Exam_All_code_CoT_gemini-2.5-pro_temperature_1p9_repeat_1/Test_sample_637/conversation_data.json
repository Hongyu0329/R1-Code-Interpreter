    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to design a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system. A deadbeat observer is one where the error between the true state and the estimated state converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps.\n\n2.  **Observer Dynamics:** The observer's state estimate `x_hat(k)` evolves according to:\n    `x_hat(k + 1) = A*x_hat(k) + B*u(k) + L*(y(k) - C*x_hat(k))`\n    The observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` dynamics are given by `e(k + 1) = (A - L*C)*e(k)`.\n\n3.  **Deadbeat Condition:** To make the error `e(k)` vanish as quickly as possible, we need to place all the eigenvalues (poles) of the error dynamics matrix `(A - L*C)` at the origin (z=0). This makes the matrix `(A - L*C)` nilpotent, meaning `(A - L*C)^n = 0` where `n` is the state dimension (`n=4` in this case). This guarantees the error will be zero after at most `n` steps.\n\n4.  **Pole Placement Strategy:** This is a pole placement problem. We need to find the observer gain matrix `L` that achieves the desired pole locations. A standard technique is to use the concept of duality between observer design and controller design.\n    *   The problem of finding an observer gain `L` for the system `(A, C)` is mathematically equivalent (dual) to finding a state-feedback controller gain `K` for a system with matrices `A_controller = A.T` (transpose of A) and `B_controller = C.T` (transpose of C).\n    *   The relationship between the gains is `K = L.T`.\n\n5.  **Implementation using Python:** We will use the `scipy.signal.place_poles` function, a powerful tool for solving pole placement problems.\n    *   We will define the system matrices `A` and `C`.\n    *   We will define the desired poles as `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n    *   We will call `place_poles` on the dual system, i.e., with `A.T` and `C.T`. The function will calculate the controller gain `K` for the dual system.\n    *   Finally, we will take the transpose of the resulting gain `K` to find our desired observer gain `L`.\n    *   The code will print the resulting `L` matrix.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps and find the observer gain matrix `L`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.signal import place_poles\n\ndef solve_observer_design():\n    \"\"\"\n    Designs a deadbeat observer for the given discrete-time system\n    and prints the observer gain matrix L.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the system matrices\n    A = np.array([[-1, 0, 0, 1],\n                  [1, 0, 0, 2],\n                  [0, 1, 0, -1],\n                  [-1, 0, 1, -1]])\n\n    C = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0],\n                  [1, 0, 0, 1]])\n\n    # For a deadbeat observer, all n eigenvalues (poles) of the error dynamics\n    # matrix (A - LC) should be placed at the origin.\n    n = A.shape[0]\n    desired_poles = np.zeros(n)\n\n    # We can find the observer gain L by solving the dual pole placement problem\n    # for a controller.
