    "When an icosahedron is positioned to stand on one of its triangular faces, that face becomes the horizontal base. The face on the exact opposite side of the icosahedron will also be a horizontal triangle, parallel to the base.\n\nThe tank is half-filled with water. The surface of a liquid at rest under gravity is always a horizontal plane. To contain exactly half the volume of the tank, this plane must pass through the geometric center of the icosahedron.\n\nThis central, horizontal cross-section intersects six of the icosahedron's other faces and six of its edges. The resulting shape of the water's surface is a polygon with six vertices. Due to the perfect symmetry of the icosahedron, this cross-section is not just any hexagon but is a **regular hexagon**, meaning all its sides have equal length and all its internal angles are equal (120 degrees).\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the properties of this regular hexagon shape by defining its vertices and then calculating its side lengths and internal angles to verify its regularity.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef describe_water_surface():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function describes the shape of the water surface and verifies its properties.\n    The shape is a regular hexagon, which is the cross-section of the icosahedron\n    at its center when it's resting on a face.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The shape of the water surface will be a regular hexagon.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Verifying the properties of a regular hexagon computationally:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # For demonstration, we define the vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 1.\n    # The exact size depends on the icosahedron's size, but the shape is always a regular hexagon.\n    # The radius `R` would be `(side_length / 2) / sin(pi/6) = side_length` for this setup.\n    R = 1.0 # Radius of the hexagon's circumcircle\n    vertices = []\n    for i in range(6):\n        angle = np.deg2rad(60 * i)\n        x = R * np.cos(angle)\n        y = R * np.sin(angle)\n        vertices.append(np.array([x, y]))\n\n    print(\"The vertices of the hexagonal water surface (for a hexagon of radius 1.0) are:\")\n    for i, v in enumerate(vertices):\n        print(f\"Vertex {i+1}: ({v[0]:.4f}, {v[1]:.4f})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculating side lengths:\")\n    side_lengths = []\n    for i in range(6):\n        p1 = vertices[i]\n        p2 = vertices[(i + 1) % 6]  # Wrap around to the first vertex\n        distance = np.linalg.norm(p2 - p1)\n        side_lengths.append(distance)\n        print(f\"Side {i+1} (between Vertex {i+1} and Vertex {(i + 1) % 6 + 1}): {distance:.4f}\")\n    \n    # Check if all side lengths are equal\n    if np.allclose(side_lengths, side_lengths[0]):\n        print(\"\\nConclusion: All side lengths are equal.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nConclusion: Side lengths are not equal.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculating internal angles:\")\n    angles = []\n    for i in range(6):\n        p_prev = vertices[i-1] \n        p_curr = vertices[i]\n        p_next = vertices[(i + 1) % 6]\n        \n        # Create vectors for the two edges meeting at p_curr\n        v1 = p_prev - p_curr\n        v2 = p_next - p_curr\n        \n        # Calculate the angle between the vectors\n        cosine_angle = np.dot(v1, v2) / (np.linalg.norm(v1) * np.linalg.norm(v2))\n        angle = np.arccos(cosine_angle)\n        angle_deg = np.rad2deg(angle)\n        angles.append(angle_deg)\n        print(f\"Angle at Vertex {i+1}: {angle_deg:.4f} degrees\")\n        \n    # Check if all angles are equal\n    if np.allclose(angles, angles[0]):\n        print(\"\\nConclusion: All internal angles are equal.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nConclusion: Internal angles are not equal.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nSince all sides and angles are equal, the shape is a regular hexagon.\")\n\n# Run the function\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    describe_water_surface()\n```\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
