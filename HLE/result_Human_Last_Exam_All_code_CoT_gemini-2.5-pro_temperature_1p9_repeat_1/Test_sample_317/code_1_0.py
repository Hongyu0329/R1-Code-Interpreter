    # Step 2: Locate 'The Negative' within Burke's Action/Motion dichotomy.
    # Burke famously argues that the negative is a purely symbolic, linguistic invention.
    # The physical world (Motion) has no 'no'; it only 'is'.
    premise_3 = "Burke posits that 'The Negative' exists only in the realm of symbols and language, not in nature."

        "made possible by language. While social rules can be rationalized, their "
