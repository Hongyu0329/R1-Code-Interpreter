    This function solves the set theory problem.
    The problem asks for the order type of a set X of infinite cardinals.
    The cardinals are those for which a "free set" of that cardinality exists.

    Step 1: Understand the setup. We work with subsets of kappa = omega_7.
    We are guaranteed the existence of a special combinatorial structure (a head tail weak Delta-system) in any large enough collection of sets.

    Step 2: A free set 'x' has the property that for any two elements (alpha, beta) in x, alpha is not in the set a_beta.

    Step 3: Using the properties of kappa (regularity) and the given combinatorial properties,
    we can show that it is possible to construct a free set of any size mu up to and including kappa.
    The argument relies on a transfinite induction. At each step of the induction (for stages less than kappa),
    the number of "forbidden" choices for the next element of the free set is less than kappa.
    Since the total number of choices is kappa, a choice can always be made.

    Step 4: This means free sets exist for all infinite cardinalities mu <= kappa.
    kappa = omega_7 = aleph_7.
    The infinite cardinals less than or equal to aleph_7 are:
    aleph_0, aleph_1, aleph_2, aleph_3, aleph_4, aleph_5, aleph_6, aleph_7.

    Step 5: The set X is {aleph_0, aleph_1, aleph_2, aleph_3, aleph_4, aleph_5, aleph_6, aleph_7}.
    The order type of this set is its cardinality (the number of elements).

    Step 6: Counting the elements in the set X.
