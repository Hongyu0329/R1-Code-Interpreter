# The problem asks to identify which parameter group is primarily affected by each of four variations in playing a violin,
# and the direction of change for a parameter in the second variation.

# 1. 'sul ponticello' playing: Corresponds to bowing near the bridge, which emphasizes higher harmonics.
# This changes the harmonic envelope, controlled by ν. This is group ii.
group_1 = 'ii'

# 2. Bridge mute: Adds mass to the bridge, damping vibrations and lowering resonance frequencies,
# especially higher ones. This affects the higher-order body resonances. This is group iv (μ, a₂, f₂).
group_2 = 'iv'

# 3. Helium-filled room: Changes the speed of sound for the internal air resonance (Helmholtz resonance),
# which is the primary, low-frequency air mode, f₁. This is group iii.
group_3 = 'iii'

# 4. Playing on the E-string instead of the A-string: This changes the fundamental frequency of the open string, F.
# This is group i.
group_4 = 'i'

# For variation (2), adding mass (the mute) lowers the resonance frequencies of the violin body.
# The last parameter of group iv is f₂. Thus, f₂ decreases.
direction_for_2 = 'down'

# The final answer is the comma-separated list of these identifiers.
final_answer = f"{group_1},{group_2},{group_3},{group_4},{direction_for_2}"
