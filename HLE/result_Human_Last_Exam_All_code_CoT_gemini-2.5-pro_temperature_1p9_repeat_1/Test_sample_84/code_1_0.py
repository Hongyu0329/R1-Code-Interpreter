    Solves for the asymptotic growth rate exponent alpha.

    The problem asks for the exponent alpha in the relation d_n = Theta(n^alpha).
    The set of points S_1 is {1, ..., n^2}.
    The set of points S_2 is {n^2+1, ..., n^{10}}.
    Based on the analysis using Markov's inequality, the degree d_n must scale
    as the square root of the length of the entire interval of points.
    The entire interval is [1, n^10], with a length of n^10 - 1.
    The exponent of n in the length is beta = 10.
    The exponent alpha is beta / 2.
