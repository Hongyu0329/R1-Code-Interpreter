    # The riddle uses numbers from the Cumbrian sheep-counting dialect.
    # We need to find the value of "tyaan'eboon", which was the original amount.

    # Step 1: Decode the components of 'tyaan'eboon'.
    # 'Tyaan' is a variant of 'Tan'.
    tan_value = 2
    # 'eboon' is a variant of 'Bumfit'.

    # Step 3: Print the explanation and the final equation.
    # The question asks "how many" he had, which is the numerical value.
    # The fact that he is now a Derbyshireman doesn't change the original quantity,
    # only the word he might use to describe it.
