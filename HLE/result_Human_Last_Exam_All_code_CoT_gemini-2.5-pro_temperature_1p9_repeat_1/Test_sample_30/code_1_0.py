# The user wants to identify the correct statement regarding interactive proof systems.
# Based on a step-by-step analysis of each option against established principles
# in complexity theory, statement D is the correct one.

# A is wrong because interactive proofs are defined by interaction.
# B is wrong because Graph Non-Isomorphism is a key example.
# C is wrong because entanglement is a very powerful verification tool (MIP*=RE).
# E is wrong about the effect of amplification.
# F is wrong because two provers are more powerful than one (MIP = NEXP vs IP = PSPACE).
# G is wrong because IP = PSPACE, which is much larger than NP.
# H is imprecise, using a non-standard alphabet.
# I gives an incorrect definition for the soundness of NP.
# J is an obscure technical definition, not a fundamental statement.

# Statement D correctly describes the fundamental asymmetry in computational power
# between a polynomial-time verifier and a computationally unbounded prover.
