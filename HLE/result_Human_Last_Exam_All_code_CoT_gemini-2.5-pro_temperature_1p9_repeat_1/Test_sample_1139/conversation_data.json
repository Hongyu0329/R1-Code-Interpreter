    "This problem requires us to determine a parameter count from the theory of supersymmetric non-linear sigma models applied to disordered systems. The number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables corresponds to the dimensionality of the bosonic sector of the relevant supersymmetric manifold.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Identify the appropriate mathematical space.** For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the corresponding supersymmetric sigma model is defined on a target manifold that is a symmetric superspace. For a model with `n` \"flavors\" (where flavors can be interpreted as replicas), the literature indicates this space is `O(2n|2n) / O(n|n) x O(n|n)`. The problem specifies two replicas, so we set `n=2`. The manifold is `G/H = O(4|4) / (O(2|2) x O(2|2))`.\n\n2.  **Determine the bosonic submanifold.** The non-Grassman variables parametrize the purely bosonic part of this superspace, `M_b = G_b / H_b`.\n    *   The bosonic subgroup `G_b` of the supergroup `O(p|q)` is `O(p) x Sp(q,R)`. So for `G = O(4|4)`, we have `G_b = O(4) x Sp(4,R)`.\n    *   Similarly, for `H = O(2|2) x O(2|2)`, the bosonic subgroup is `H_b = (O(2) x Sp(2,R)) x (O(2) x Sp(2,R))`.\n    *   The resulting bosonic manifold `M_b` decomposes into a product of two classical symmetric spaces: `M_b = [O(4) / (O(2)xO(2))] x [Sp(4,R) / (Sp(2,R)xSp(2,R))]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the dimension.** The total number of bosonic variables is the dimension of `M_b`, which is the sum of the dimensions of its two component spaces. We use the standard formulas for the dimensions of Lie groups:\n    *   `dim(O(k)) = k(k-1)/2`\n    *   `dim(Sp(2m,R)) = m(2m+1)`\n    The dimension of a coset space `A/B` is `dim(A) - dim(B)`.\n\n4.  **Sum the results.** The final answer is the sum of the dimensions calculated for the two component spaces.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan to find the final number.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector\n    of the supersymmetric sigma-model with two replicas for disordered systems of symmetry class D.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def dim_O(k):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the dimension of the orthogonal group O(k).\"\"\"\n        return k * (k - 1) // 2\n\n    def dim_Sp2mR(m):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the dimension of the real symplectic group Sp(2m, R).\"\"\"\n        return m * (2 * m + 1)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the manifold for symmetry class D with 2 replicas.\")\n    print(\"The supersymmetric sigma-model is defined on the superspace G/H = O(4|4) / (O(2|2) x O(2|2)).\")\n    print(\"The number of non-Grassman variables is the dimension of the bosonic part of this space,\")\n    print(\"which is M_b = [O(4)/(O(2)xO(2))] x [Sp(4,R)/(Sp(2,R)xSp(2,R))].\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculating the dimension of the first component space M_O = O(4) / (O(2) x O(2)).\")\n    k_numerator = 4\n    k_denominator = 2\n    dim_O_num = dim_O(k_numerator)\n    dim_O_den = 2 * dim_O(k_denominator)\n    dim_M_O = dim_O_num - dim_O_den\n    print(f\"Dimension of O({k_numerator}) = {k_numerator}({k_numerator}-1)/2 = {dim_O_num}\")\n    print(f\"Dimension of O({k_denominator}) x O({k_denominator}) = 2 * [{k_denominator}({k_denominator}-1)/2] = {dim_O_den}\")\n    print(f\"Dimension of M_O = {dim_O_num} - {dim_O_den} = {dim_M_O}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculating the dimension of the second component space M_Sp = Sp(4,R) / (Sp(2,R) x Sp(2,R)).\")\n    m_numerator = 2  # for Sp(2m,R) = Sp(4,R)\n    m_denominator = 1  # for Sp(2m,R) = Sp(2,R)\n    dim_Sp_num = dim_Sp2mR(m_numerator)\n    dim_Sp_den = 2 * dim_Sp2mR(m_denominator)\n    dim_M_Sp = dim_Sp_num - dim_Sp_den\n    print(f\"For Sp(4,R), m={m_numerator}.
