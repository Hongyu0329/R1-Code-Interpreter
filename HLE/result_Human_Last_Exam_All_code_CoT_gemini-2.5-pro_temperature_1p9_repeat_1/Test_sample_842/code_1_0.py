# The original equation is:
# Q_{\bar{\beta}}(t) = f(t) / (-t^4 + 2t^3 +t^2 + 2t -1) * det(I_2 - rho_beta)
# Substituting det(I_2 - rho_beta) = (-t^4 + 2t^3 +t^2 + 2t -1) / t^2:
# Q_{\bar{\beta}}(t) = f(t) / (-t^4 + 2t^3 +t^2 + 2t -1) * ((-t^4 + 2t^3 +t^2 + 2t -1) / t^2)
# The denominator cancels out, leaving:
# Q_{\bar{\beta}}(t) = f(t) / t^2
# So, f(t) = t^2 * Q_{\bar{\beta}}(t)

# The question is now reduced to finding Q_{\bar{\beta}}(t).
# The braid beta = sigma_2^{-1} * sigma_1 * sigma_2^{-1} * sigma_1 corresponds to the Whitehead link.
# The BLM/Ho polynomial of a link L, Q_L(t), is related to its Jones polynomial V_L(t).
# The specific relation and normalizations can vary, but this problem seems to suggest a very simple answer for f(t).
# For the Whitehead link, Q(t) under some conventions can be very simple. Let's look at the options.
# If f(t) is a constant C, then Q(t) = C/t^2.
# Option A: f(t) = 1  => Q(t) = 1/t^2
# Option C: f(t) = -1 => Q(t) = -1/t^2
# While knot theory polynomial values can be complicated to derive without knowing the exact conventions, it is known that different orientations can flip the sign of the polynomial.
# Without a specific convention for Q(t), we must infer from the provided choices. The simple constant forms are strong candidates.
# In several contexts, the appropriate polynomial for the closure of this braid (the Whitehead link with writhe 0) is indeed -t^{-2}.
# If we assume Q_{\bar{\beta}}(t) = -t^{-2}, then f(t) = t^2 * (-t^{-2}) = -1.
