# The problem is to find the smallest integer M such that for any sequence a_i,
# we can find x_i satisfying the conditions.
# This boils down to the inequality W_max <= 2 - 2 * 10**(-M),
# where W_max is the supremum of the minimal range of partial sums.
# For large N, W_max can be approximated by 2 - 1/N.

# So we have the inequality: 2 - 1/N <= 2 - 2 * 10**(-M)
# Which simplifies to: 2 * 10**(-M) <= 1/N
# 10**(-M) <= 1 / (2 * N)
# Taking log10 on both sides: -M <= log10(1 / (2 * N))
# -M <= -log10(2 * N)
# M >= log10(2 * N)
# M >= log10(2) + log10(N)
