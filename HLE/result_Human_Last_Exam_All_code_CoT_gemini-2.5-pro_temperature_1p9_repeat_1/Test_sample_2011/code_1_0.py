def solve_max_clique_sizes(n):
    """
    Determines and explains the maximum possible number of different clique sizes
    that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph on n vertices.

    The problem can be solved by a logical argument rather than a complex computation.

    Step 1: Find the theoretical upper bound.
    A graph with 'n' vertices can only have cliques of size 'k', where 1 <= k <= n.
    This is because a clique is a set of vertices, and its size cannot exceed the total
    number of vertices available in the graph.
    Therefore, the set of possible clique sizes is a subset of {1, 2, ..., n}.
    This means the number of *different* clique sizes cannot be more than n.

    Step 2: Show that this upper bound is achievable.
    We need to demonstrate the existence of a graph on 'n' vertices that contains
    induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to n.
    Consider the complete graph K_n, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.

    In K_n, any subset of k vertices (for 1 <= k <= n) will have all possible edges
    between them. Therefore, the subgraph induced by these k vertices is a clique of size k.
    
    Since we can pick a subset of any size k from 1 to n, the complete graph K_n
    contains induced cliques of all n possible sizes.

    Conclusion: The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is n.
