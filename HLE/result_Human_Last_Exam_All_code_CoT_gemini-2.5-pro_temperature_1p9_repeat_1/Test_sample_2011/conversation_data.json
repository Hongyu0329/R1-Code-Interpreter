    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Constraints:** A graph on `n` vertices can't have an induced clique of size larger than `n`. The smallest possible clique size is 1. This means the set of all possible distinct clique sizes is a subset of `{1, 2, ..., n}`. Therefore, the number of different clique sizes can be at most `n`.\n\n2.  **Establish an Upper Bound:** Based on the analysis, for `n = 128`, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is at most 128.\n\n3.  **Prove Achievability:** I will demonstrate that this upper bound is achievable. I will propose a specific graph construction on `n` vertices that contains induced cliques of all integer sizes from 1 to `n`. The complete graph, `K_n`, is the perfect candidate for this.\n\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that implements this logic. The script will take `n = 128` as input, explain the reasoning step-by-step using `print` statements, and finally, print the determined maximum number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_max_clique_sizes(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph on n vertices.\n\n    The problem can be solved by a logical argument rather than a complex computation.\n\n    Step 1: Find the theoretical upper bound.\n    A graph with 'n' vertices can only have cliques of size 'k', where 1 <= k <= n.\n    This is because a clique is a set of vertices, and its size cannot exceed the total\n    number of vertices available in the graph.\n    Therefore, the set of possible clique sizes is a subset of {1, 2, ..., n}.\n    This means the number of *different* clique sizes cannot be more than n.\n\n    Step 2: Show that this upper bound is achievable.\n    We need to demonstrate the existence of a graph on 'n' vertices that contains\n    induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to n.\n    Consider the complete graph K_n, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n    In K_n, any subset of k vertices (for 1 <= k <= n) will have all possible edges\n    between them. Therefore, the subgraph induced by these k vertices is a clique of size k.\n    \n    Since we can pick a subset of any size k from 1 to n, the complete graph K_n\n    contains induced cliques of all n possible sizes.\n\n    Conclusion: The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step reasoning:\")\n    print(\"1. Let G be a graph on n vertices. Let k be the size of any clique that is an induced subgraph of G.\")\n    print(f\"2. By definition, the number of vertices in an induced subgraph cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph. So, k <= n.\")\n    print(f\"3. This sets an upper bound on the number of different clique sizes. We can have at most n different sizes, which would correspond to the set {{1, 2, ..., {n}}}.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo show this upper bound is achievable, we present a graph construction:\")\n    print(f\"4.

For any integer k from 1 to {n}, we can choose any subset of k vertices.\")\n    print(\"7. The subgraph induced by this subset of k vertices is a clique of size k (a K_k).\")\n    print(f\"8. Therefore, the graph K_{n} contains induced cliques of all sizes: 1, 2, 3, ..., {n}.\")\n    print(f\"9. The total count of these different sizes is {n}.\")\n\n    # The \"final equation\" in this context is simply the result of this logical deduction.\n    # Maximum number of sizes = n\n    max_sizes = n\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal equation:\")\n    print(f\"Maximum_Possible_Clique_Sizes = {n}\")\n    \n    return max_sizes\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = 128\n    final_answer = solve_max_clique_sizes(n)\n    # The final answer is wrapped as requested.\n    # The print statements inside the function already provide the explanation.\n    # This format matches the <<<answer content>>> format requirement.\n    # print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```\n<<<128>>>"
