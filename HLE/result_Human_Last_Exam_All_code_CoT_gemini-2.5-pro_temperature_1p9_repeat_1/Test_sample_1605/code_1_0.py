# The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes of compact metric
# spaces with a disconnection number of four.
# Based on topological analysis, there are two primary, structurally distinct
# classes of topological graphs that satisfy this condition.

# Class 1: The Tripod Graph (a tree with 3 endpoints).
# Its disconnection number D is e+1 where e is the number of endpoints.
# D = 3 + 1 = 4.
num_tree_classes = 1

# Class 2: The Complete Graph on 4 Vertices (K4).
# It can be shown that its disconnection number is 4.
# A set of 3 vertices can be removed, leaving the graph connected.
# D - 1 >= 3, so D >= 4. It can also be shown any 4 points disconnect it.
num_cyclic_classes = 1 # Representing K4 as the fundamental example.

# The total number of such classes we have identified.
total_classes = num_tree_classes + num_cyclic_classes
