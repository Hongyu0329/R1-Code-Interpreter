    # --- Clue 1 ---
    # The clue refers to Irving Wallace's novel "The Miracle".
    # The plot of this book is centered around the Marian apparitions to Bernadette Soubirous,
    # which occurred in a grotto in a specific French town. The "lady in white" is the Virgin Mary.
    city1 = "Lourdes"
    print(f"1. The scene from 'The Miracle' takes place in {city1}, France, the site of the famous Marian apparitions.")

    # --- Clue 2 ---
    # The clue refers to a line from a poem by the Russian poet Yuri Krasnokutsky.
    # The line "Течет река — холодная струя — По венам кровью города большого" translates to
    # "The river flows - a cold stream - Through the veins with the blood of the big city."
    # The poem is about the Moskva River, and 'X', the "big city," is Moscow.
    city2 = "Moscow"
    print(f"2. The 'cold stream' is the Moskva River, and 'X' is the city it flows through: {city2}.")

    # --- Clue 3 ---
    # The Dolac market is in Zagreb, Croatia, and is nicknamed "Trbuh Zagreba" or "The Belly of Zagreb".
    # This style of nickname is a direct reference to Émile Zola's novel "Le Ventre de Paris"
    # ("The Belly of Paris"), which was about the central market Les Halles.
    # Thus, the "main analogue" was in Paris.
    city3 = "Paris"
    print(f"3. The nickname 'Belly of Zagreb' for the Dolac market is an analogue of 'The Belly of Paris', making the city {city3}.")

    # --- Final Answer ---
    print("\nThe final trilogy is:")
    # Printing the final answer in the requested format {City 1, City 2, City 3}
    final_trilogy = f"{{{city1}, {city2}, {city3}}}"
