# Parameters of the problem
N = 15  # Number of points
d = 8   # Dimension of the hypersphere

# This problem is a known problem in combinatorial geometry.
# We are trying to find the value h(N, d), which is the minimized maximum number of points
# that can be found in any single closed hyper-hemisphere.
# A plausible formula that fits known values for this problem (for N > d) is:
# h(N, d) = d + floor((N - d - 1) / 2)

# Calculate the terms
term_N_minus_d_minus_1 = N - d - 1
term_division_by_2 = term_N_minus_d_minus_1 / 2
term_floor = math.floor(term_division_by_2)

# Calculate the final result using the formula
result = d + term_floor

# We are asked to output each number in the final equation
# The equation is: result = d + floor((N - d - 1) / 2)
# Substituting the values: result = 8 + floor((15 - 8 - 1) / 2)
# which simplifies to result = 8 + floor(6 / 2) = 8 + 3 = 11
